ABSTRACT

Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) was significantly related to a variety of work 

outcomes in the present study.  Further, the efficacy of organization-based self-esteem over global 

self-esteem in the prediction of work outcomes was illustrated.  The inclusion of OBSE in 

regression equations which included global self-esteem as a predictor of work outcomes resulted 

in a significant increase in the proportion of variance accounted for in job satisfaction, 

organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, and turnover 

intent.

The findings of the present study support the value of an organization-based measure of 

self-esteem in the prediction of work attitudes.  Organization-based self-esteem is a new measure 

which adds a degree of sensitivity to the understanding of organizational attitudes.  It is also 

evident from the present research results that a different set of organizational and demographic 

correlates is associated with perceived sacrifice, perceived alternatives, and affective commitment.

The present research also explored age-related differences in work outcomes (e.g., job 

satisfaction, affective commitment) ,  The positive relationships hypothesized between age and 

these variables did not emerge in the present research, however.  Initially, age was significantly 

and positively related to organizational commitment, perceived alternatives commitment, and 

global self-esteem.  These relationships were no longer significant after the effects of job and 

organizational tenure were taken into account, with the exception of the global self-esteem by age 

relationship.  Individuals aged 51 and up had significantly higher levels of global self-esteem than 

did their co-workers aged 20-35 years and 36-50 years.  The employees aged 20-35 years and 

26-50 years did not differ significantly from each other in their level of global self-esteem. 

Implications of these findings as well as suggestions for future research are delineated.

CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTION

Population trends and demographic changes pose a unique challenge to researchers and 

decision makers on work force issues. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of 

older individuals will increase between now and the year 2000 while the pool of potential younger 

workers will decline (United States Department of Labor, 1989).  Modifications within an 

organization’s recruiting, selection, training and reward systems may be necessary to 

accommodate the influences of demographic changes (Klein & Hall,  1988; Sterns & Alexander, 

1988).  The dramatic growth in the number of older people, combined with the recent trend 

toward the acceptance of early retirement, has made the retention of older workers a more 

salient issue than it had been in past years.

The present research addressed the issue of an aging work force in terms of age 

differences in work-related attitudes.  Specifically, the research emphasized the importance of a 

worker’s self concept to the understanding of work-related attitudes and behaviors (e.g., 

satisfaction, commitment).  It examined the influence of organization-based self-esteem (Pierce, 

Gardner, Cummings, & Dunham, 1989)  on job satisfaction, organization satisfaction, and 

organizational commitment using a developmental framework to identify any age-related 

differences in these factors.  Further, no research to date had addressed age differences in 

organization-based self-esteem.  The present research searched for any such differences.

In general, job satisfaction and organizational commitment have been shown to be 

negatively related with absenteeism and turnover (Mowday, Porter, & Steers, 1982).  However, 

age-related issues may also be relevant to understanding the decisions of workers to continue in, 

or leave, their jobs.  Specifically, there may be some age differences in commitment, satisfaction

and other attitudes that make older workers more or less likely to leave an organization.  A large 

number of studies using both bivariate and multivariate analyses have shown consistent and 

positive relationships between overall job satisfaction and age (Rhodes, 1983).  A recent 

investigation of the age-job satisfaction relationship found that job congruence, work locus of 

control, organization tenure and salary accounted for the majority of the variance in this 

relationship in a sample of 496 managers.  The higher satisfaction of older workers in this sample 

was likely because of their greater congruence, higher salary, longer tenure, and greater internal 

locus of control (White & Spector, 1987).

Similar results are evident with age and organizational commitment.  Rhodes’ (1983) 

review of age differences in work attitudes and behaviors indicated overall support for a positive 

relationship between age and attitudinal organizational commitment.

Meyer and Allen (1984) studied the impact of age and tenure on both affective and 

continuance commitment.  These two views of commitment have been prevalent in research on 

organizational attitudes.  Affective commitment reflects an individual’s identification with the 

organization.  Continuance commitment, also termed behavioral commitment, reflects an 

individual’s connection with the organization through increasing investment.  Meyer and Allen’s 

(1984)  continuance commitment scale includes commitment through perceived high sacrifice 

associated with leaving as well as low perceived alternatives to the present job.  Age and tenure 

were positively related with affective commitment but unrelated with continuance commitment. 

The authors speculated that older employees might have felt increased sacrifice due to seniority 

and other investments while younger workers perceived that fewer alternatives were available to 

them due to lower levels of work experience.  Older workers may also perceive themselves as 

having fewer work and mobility options than their middle-aged counterparts.  Research on actual 

mobility rates indicated that age was significantly and negatively correlated with propensity to 

move (Veiga, 1983)  and perceived ease of movement (Landau & Hammer, 1986).  The present 

research explored possible age differences in perceived alternatives and hypothesized a curvilinear

relationship with younger and older workers perceiving fewer alternatives than workers in the 

other age ranges.

Along with age, other organizationally relevant variables may be related to an 

individual’s propensity to continue in, or to leave his or her job.  Self-esteem is one such 

individual difference variable which has not been viewed within a developmental framework in 

the organizational literature.  Recent work on organization-based self-esteem ties this construct to 

satisfaction and commitment (Pierce et al., 1989).  Pierce et al. (1989) hypothesized that the way 

individuals react to life experiences would vary as a function of their level of self-esteem and that 

individuals would develop attitudes and behave so as to maintain this level of esteem.

Different levels of self-esteem have been identified (Piece et al.,  1989) including:  (1) 

global, (2) role-specific, and (3) task-specific. Researchers have expressed the need to utilize a 

measure of self-esteem consonant with the context of the research.  A measure of 

organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) was developed to study associations between self-esteem 

and the other variables traditionally employed in organizational paradigms (Pierce et al.,  1989). 

Pierce et al. (1989) operationalized OBSE as the degree to which organizational members 

believed they could satisfy their needs through their participation in roles within the 

organizational context.  The focus was on individuals’ assessments of their own organizational 

worth.

Swann’s (1985) self-verification formulation to human behavior provided a theoretical 

basis for the present research.  Lecky (1945) first introduced the notion that individuals engage in 

behaviors and cognitive activities that verify, validate, and sustain their self-concepts.  An 

implication of this view was that people should strive to confirm and verify those self-views that 

have become relatively certain (Swann, 1985).  Applying this theory to the present research, 

individuals with high levels of OBSE were hypothesized to perceive themselves as valuable and to 

attempt to engage in behaviors valued in their organization.  Low OBSE employees were 

predicted to do the opposite in order to preserve their self-views (Pierce et al.,  1989).

Testing the links between OBSE and specified consequences within a developmental 

framework was a useful means of exploring any age-related differences in these linkages.  No 

research to date has focused on variations in OBSE by age.  What has been evident, however, is 

the importance of the self-esteem construct in developmental and career theory research.  A 

major area of research among life span developmental psychologists concerns the stability or 

change in an individual’s personality over time (Costa & McCrae,  1988).  Many researchers point 

to the importance of studying well-defined areas of personality because broad conceptualizations 

may not be amenable to definition, while testing with narrow concepts may be trivial (Bengtson, 

Reedy, & Gordon, 1985).  Research on self and self-conceptions has enabled the study of stability 

and change within a more focused framework.

Bengtson et al. (1985) reviewed the literature regarding self-esteem.  Self-esteem can be 

divided into two aspects, one based on a sense of personal competence and the other reflecting a 

sense of personal worth.  The majority of the studies in their review showed either no age 

differences or found higher self-esteem in older cohorts.

Positive relationships have been found between intrinsic job characteristics (e.g., job 

complexity) and self-esteem (Brockner, 1988; Tharenou,  1979; Tharenou & Harker, 1982) and, to 

a lesser magnitude, between extrinsic job characteristics (e.g., pay and job level) and self-esteem 

(Brockner,  1988).  Self-esteem has also been significantly and positively linked with job 

satisfaction (Pierce et al., 1989; Tharenou, 1979), organizational satisfaction, and commitment 

(Pierce et al., 1989).

Tharenou’s (1979) review of employee self-esteem significantly linked job satisfaction 

with both global self-esteem and sense of competence.  Further, job satisfaction accounted for a 

large amount of the variance in sense of competence even with the addition of other explanatory 

variables (Tharenou & Harker,  1982).  No such relationship was evident with the measure of 

global self-esteem.

Pierce et al. (1989)  found similar relationships with OBSE.  Organization-based 

self-esteem was highly correlated (r =  .77) with organizational satisfaction.  This correlation was

larger than the correlation between organizational satisfaction and global self-esteem  (r  =  .39). 

This provided further evidence for the usefulness of OBSE when studying organization based 

outcomes and attitudes.

Similarly to job satisfaction, organizational commitment has been useful to 

organizations in terms of its relationship with absenteeism and turnover (Mowday, Steers, & 

Porter, 1979).  Two views of commitment have been recently identified in the literature:  affective 

and continuance commitment (McGee & Ford, 1987).  Affective commitment is defined as the 

level of identification with, and involvement in, an organization (Curry, Wakefield, Price, & 

Mueller, 1986).  Continuance commitment is reflected in Becker’s (1960) side bet theory which 

describes an individual as bound to the organization through increasing investment (e.g., pension 

or seniority).

Continuance commitment has been measured with scales developed by Ritzer and Trice 

(1969) and modified by Hrebiniak and Alluto (1972).  Recently, however, researchers have 

provided evidence that these scales instead reflect affective commitment (McGee & Ford, 1987; 

Meyer & Allen, 1984).  Meyer and Allen (1984) developed a single scale to better assess 

continuance commitment.  McGee and Ford (1987) re-evaluated this continuance commitment 

scale and found support for two distinct dimensions:  one reflecting high personal sacrifice 

associated with leaving (similar to Becker’s side bet) and the other reflecting perceptions of few 

employment alternatives.  The authors suggested exploration of the scale and the addition of 

items to further develop the two-pronged approach to continuance commitment.

The present research explored the different facets of commitment with the use of 

McGee and Ford’s (1987) modification of Meyer and Allen’s (1984)  affective and two-prong 

continuance commitment indicators.  McGee and Ford (1987) suggested the refinement of the 

continuance commitment indicators through the generation of supplemental items.  Additional 

items were generated for the continuance commitment subscales based upon research on 

occupational mobility.  Perceptions of marketability (Veiga, 1983) and job market conditions 

(Noe, Steffy, & Barber, 1988) have been linked with propensity to move.  These factors reflect

perceptions of the availability of alternatives and were included as items for the perceived 

alternatives commitment scale.  The perceived sacrifice commitment scale reflects commitment 

based upon personal sacrifice associated with leaving.  Factors such as job security, company 

benefits and tenure or seniority may be sacrificed if an individual leaves his/her organization. 

These factors have been linked with occupational mobility attitudes (Veiga, 1983).

The relationship with regard to age and perceived alternatives may not be linear but 

rather curvilinear with younger and older (dose to retirement age) workers perceiving fewer 

alternatives than workers in the other age ranges.  Younger workers’ perceptions may reflect lack 

of experience.  On the other hand, the older workers’ perceptions of few alternatives may be 

consistent with the research on mobility which finds a negative relationship between age and 

propensity to move (Veiga, 1983) and perceived ease of movement (Landau & Hammer, 1986).

Further, the present research addressed the level of analysis issue by assessing 

self-esteem at the organizational level.  This is more consistent with the outcome variables in 

question than is a global measure of self-esteem.

The links between OBSE and job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, and 

organizational commitment were studied along with any age differences in these variables.  Pierce 

et al.  (1989) hypothesized and found positive relationships between OBSE and organizational 

satisfaction, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.  The present research attempted to 

replicate the Pierce et al. (1989) findings with regard to job and organizational satisfaction using 

a more reliable index for organizational satisfaction.

This study makes several contributions to the literature.  It was the first known study to 

explore age differences in OBSE.  Along with this, the present research reflects the importance 

of level of analysis in organizational research.  The strength of predictions concerning work 

outcomes may be enhanced when there is a consonance between predictor and outcome 

measures.  Finally, the present research provided a unique approach to the issue of older adult 

labor force exit patterns.  The importance of this type of knowledge should not be understated in

CHAPTER n  

LITERATURE REVIEW

A major purpose of this study was to explore the factors that relate to an older worker’s 

continuance in his or her job.  This type of research has been approached in many ways, 

including the exploration of job/career mobility as well as the extent to which an individual is 

committed to his/her organization.  The present research explored the importance of a worker’s 

organization-based self-esteem on the understanding of work-related attitudes such as job 

satisfaction, organization satisfaction, and organizational commitment using a developmental 

framework to identify any age-related differences.

This study placed a new slant on previous research regarding the older adult in the 

work force as well as work attitude research, in general.  For instance, only recently has research 

begun to refocus on the different facets of organizational commitment and few studies trace the 

influence that an employee’s age might have on continuance commitment.  Further, although the 

relationship between self-esteem and both work-related characteristics and attitudinal outcomes 

has been explored, no known research to date has synthesized the industrial/organizational 

research regarding work attitudes with developmental and other research regarding age 

differences in self-esteem.  The present research pulls together these literatures in order to assess 

the hypothesized mediating effect that organization-based self-esteem has on the relationship 

between age and work-related attitudes.

The rationale for this study will be traced in the sections that follow by reviewing each 

of these areas as well as the theoretical basis for the use of both self-esteem and the choice of an 

organizational level of this construct.  First, however, a brief review of the literature regarding the 

link between turnover and both satisfaction and commitment will be presented in order to

illustrate the usefulness of these variables in the exploration of factors associated with an older 

9

worker’s continuance in his or her job.

Work Attitudes and Turnover

Research on employee turnover is a continuing issue in the industrial/organizational 

psychology literature (Mowday, Porter, & Steers, 1982).  Theoretical models of turnover have 

linked level of job satisfaction with turnover either directly (March & Simon, 1958) or as an 

intermediate step in the turnover decision process (Mobley, 1977).  Further, the literature on the 

link between employee turnover and job satisfaction has reported consistently negative 

relationships (Mobley, Griffeth, Hand, & Meglino, 1979; Porter & Steers, 1973; Price,  1977). 

These correlations have not been especially high, however, (usually less than r  =  -.40), implying 

the importance of other variables in this relationship (Mobley, 1977).

Although historically models of employee turnover have concentrated on relationships 

with job satisfaction, research indicates the importance of organizational commitment to the 

prediction of turnover (Horn, Katerberg, & Hulin,  1979; Mowday et al.,  1979; Porter, Steers, 

Mowday, & Boulian, 1974).  Further, an employee’s perceptions of employment alternatives 

might impact upon a worker’s decision to continue in a given organization.  For example, 

according to March and Simon (1958), dissatisfied employees will explore alternative work 

situations and will likely leave their present work situations if they see that alternatives exist.  If, 

however, perceived ease of movement is low due to the lack of available alternatives, employees 

may adjust their goals or organizational contributions downward.

There are ambiguities surrounding both conceptual and operational definitions of 

perceived alternatives (Griffeth & Horn, 1988).  Griffeth and Horn point to this as a reason for 

consistently weak empirical effects between perceived alternatives and termination decision or 

behavior.  The authors compared the relative predictive validity of the different formulations of 

perceived alternatives defined in turnover models.  They found that general availability of 

alternatives was a superior predictor of turnover criteria as compared to more specific indices 

such as expected utility of alternatives and/or job offers.  However, no measure of perceived

alternatives made a significant independent contribution to turnover prediction.  Further, 

consistent with Mobley’s (1977) theory, job satisfaction and expected utility of the present job 

10

were negatively related with intention to quit.

Work Attitudes

Organizational Commitment.  There have been diverse definitions of organizational 

commitment.  Mowday et al. (1979) noted trends in the classification of organizational 

commitment.  Two types of commitment have emerged:  attitudinal and behavioral.  Attitudinal 

commitment reflects an individual’s identification with the goals and values of an organization 

while behavioral commitment reflects the process by which the individual’s past behaviors serve 

to bind him/her to the organization.  According to Mowday et al. (1979), attitudinal 

commitment involves:  (1) a strong belief in and acceptance of the goals and values of the 

organization, (2) a willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of the organization, and (3)  a 

desire to maintain membership in the organization.  DeCotiis and Summers (1987) more 

narrowly defined attitudinal commitment to involve organizational goal and value internalization 

and the resulting role involvement in terms of these goals and values.

Much of the research in this area measures attitudinal commitment to the organization 

(Curry et al., 1986; Farkas & Tetrick, 1989; Mowday et al., 1979; Porter et al., 1974; Steers, 1977; 

Williams & Hazer, 1986).  This approach has typically been operationalized with the 

Organizational Commitment Questionnaire developed by Porter and his associates (Mowday et 

al., 1979; Porter et al., 1974).

Meyer and Allen (1984) utilized the terms affective and continuance to reflect the 

attitudinal and behavioral aspects of commitment defined previously.  These authors developed a 

scale of affective commitment based upon an individual’s identification with his or her 

organization and his or her commitment to maintain membership in order to pursue its goals. 

Their Affective Commitment Scale correlated highly with the Organizational Commitment 

Questionnaire in a series of studies.  These consistently high and significant correlations between 

the Affective Commitment Scale and the well-established Organizational Commitment

Questionnaire (.78 and .86; Meyer & Allen, 1984) provides consistent evidence of the validity of 

the Affective Commitment Scale for measuring attitudinal commitment.

Meyer and Allen (1984) trace continuance commitment to Becker’s (1960) side-bet 

theory in which an individual is bound to the organization through the accumulation of side bets. 

such as time, effort, or money investments, which would be lost to the individual if he or she 

were to leave the organization.  Hence, this type of commitment does not reflect favorable affect 

toward the organization.

Ritzer and Trice (1969)  developed the original measure used to test Becker’s side-bet 

theory; the scale was later modified by Hrebiniak and Alutto (1972).  Meyer and Allen (1984) 

questioned the validity of these scales for the measurement of Becker’s side-bet theory of 

commitment.  According to them, Ritzer and Trice (1969) had viewed age (or tenure) as the best 

predictor of the accumulation of side-bets and, consequently, interpreted a positive relationship 

between scores on their scale and age as support for Becker’s theory.  Meyer and Allen (1984) 

questioned this interpretation on several grounds.  First, they stated that an examination of the 

measure indicated that both the Ritzer-Trice Scale and the Hrebiniak-Alluto Scale reflect 

affective rather than continuance commitment.  Further, they questioned the use of age or tenure 

as an index of accumulated investments without the consideration of other age-related variables.

Thus, Meyer and Allen (1984) developed and tested alternative scales to measure both 

affective and continuance commitment (the Affective Commitment Scale and Continuance 

Commitment Scale, respectively).  These measures were utilized in the present research.  Two 

independent studies were conducted by Meyer and Allen (1984) in the development of these 

measures.  In the first study, subjects read scenarios in which an employee was described as being 

high or low in continuance commitment and high or low in affective commitment.  Subjects then 

responded to the Ritzer-Trice Scale, Hrebiniak-Alluto Scale, Affective Commitment Scale, 

Continuance Commitment Scale, and Organizational Commitment Questionnaire as they felt the 

fictional employee would respond.  Results supported the view that the Ritzer-Trice Scale and 

Hrebiniak-Alluto Scale actually tapped affective and not continuance commitment.  In study two,

both the Ritzer-Trice Scale and Hrebiniak-Alluto Scale correlated significantly with measures of 

affective commitment but not with continuance commitment.  Further, age and tenure correlated 

with the Ritzer-Trice and Hrebiniak-Alluto scales and with the affective commitment measures 

but not with the Continuance Commitment Scale, lending support for the relationship between 

age and affective commitment.  Coefficient alpha internal consistency reliability estimates of .83 

and .84 were found for the Affective Commitment Scale and .73 and .74 for the Continuance 

Commitment Scale.

McGee and Ford (1987) re-examined the psychometric properties of the Meyer and 

Allen scales with a sample of 350 faculty members from four-year colleges and universities.

Their research provided further support for the conceptual distinction between affective and 

continuance commitment as well as evidence for the usefulness of the Meyer and Allen scales. 

Internal consistency reliability for the Affective Commitment Scale was .88. The Continuance 

Commitment Scale was not found to be unidimensional, however.  Instead, it reflected two 

components:  perceptions that few employment alternatives exist (perceived alternatives 

commitment) and high personal sacrifice associated with leaving (perceived sacrifice 

commitment).  Internal consistency reliability estimates were slightly higher for the continuance 

commitment subscales (.72 and .71, respectively) than for the original Continuance Commitment 

Scale (.70) despite the fact that the subscale correlations involve only three items each while the 

original Continuance Commitment Scale is an eight item scale.  Further, the absence of a 

significant relationship between affective and continuance commitment found in the studies 

described may be due to the fact that affective commitment was significantly and negatively 

related to perceived alternatives commitment but significantly and positively related to perceived 

sacrifice commitment, thus cancelling out any relationship between continuance and affective 

commitment.  The negligible relationship between age and continuance commitment was 

explained by Meyer and Allen (1984).  They speculated that older employees may have felt 

increased sacrifice due to seniority and other investments while younger workers perceived that 

fewer alternatives were available to them due to lower levels of work experience.  Any age

differences in continuance commitment may have been masked since both sacrifice and perceived 

alternatives were reflected in the continuance commitment scale.

The present researcher offered an alternative explanation of these findings.  It may also 

be the case that older workers perceive themselves as having fewer work and mobility options 

than their middle-aged counterparts.  Research on actual mobility rates indicates that age is 

significantly and negatively correlated with propensity to move (Veiga, 1983) and perceived ease 

of movement (Landau & Hammer, 1986).  Other research suggests that individuals in later career 

stages may have lowered expectations with regard to mobility opportunities and be less 

promotion-oriented.  These orientations result in a decreased propensity to accept 

intraorganizational movement opportunities (Noe et al.,  1988).  The present research explored 

possible age differences in perceived alternatives and hypothesized a curvilinear relationship with 

younger and older workers perceiving fewer alternatives than workers in the other age ranges.  In 

accordance with McGee and Ford’s (1987) recommendations, items were added to both the 

perceived alternatives commitment and perceived sacrifice commitment scales in order to 

strengthen and refine the three item subscales.

The importance of measuring both types of commitment cannot be understated 

(Mowday et al., 1982; Meyer, Paunonom, Gellatly, Goffin, & Jackson, 1989).  The nature of 

commitment has implications for policies which are implemented to increase commitment.  For 

instance, companies offering policies which would bind employees to the organization (e.g., rapid 

promotion, organization-specific skills training) may foster continuance commitment but not 

positive affect toward the organization.

Aside from the definitional component of organizational commitment, another 

important line of research concerns its antecedents and consequences.  Most such research has 

investigated correlates of attitudinal commitment.  Based upon previous research, Steers (1977) 

classified antecedents to attitudinal commitment and found significant relationships between 

commitment and the following:  (1) personal factors, such as age, tenure, education, gender, and 

personality factors; (2) job characteristics, such as job scope, role conflict, and role ambiguity;

and (3) work experiences, such as organizational dependability and perceived pay equity.  This list 

was expanded by Mowday et al. (1982) to include structural characteristics of the organization 

(e.g., formalization, decentralization).  Mowday et aL (1982) discuss a series of unpublished 

studies which examine commitment differences across occupational groupings.  Interestingly, no 

significant differences in mean commitment level were found across occupational levels for either 

state university or hospital samples, although commitment levels did differ significantly across the 

organizations studied.

Age and tenure are two personal correlates relevant to the present research.  Overall, 

age and tenure have been linked positively and directly with commitment (Meyer & Allen,  1984; 

Mowday et al., 1982; Rhodes, 1983; Steers, 1977; Bluedom, 1982; Michaels & Spector, 1982). 

Other researchers have found age to be only indirectly related to commitment through its effect 

on job satisfaction (Williams & Hazer, 1986).

Researchers have also treated organizational commitment as an independent variable 

useful in the prediction of work outcomes including job performance, turnover, and absenteeism 

(Mowday et al., 1982).  A highly significant inverse relationship has been found between 

commitment and turnover (Mowday et al., 1982).  The relationship between commitment and job 

performance at both the individual and group levels was only weakly supported, however.  Only 

one known study examined the relationship between job performance and both affective and 

continuance commitment (Meyer et al., 1989).  These researchers found a positive relationship 

between affective commitment and job performance and a negative relationship between 

continuance commitment and job performance.  Finally, Mowday et al. (1982) reported studies 

which reflect cither a negative or no relationship between commitment and absenteeism.

Job Satisfaction.  Locke (1976) views job satisfaction as an individual response reflecting 

a positive emotional state.  This state results from an employee’s appraisal of his or her job or 

job experiences.  Job satisfaction has been assessed globally as well as in terms of specific job 

facets (Locke,  1976).  Many theories attempt to define the causes of job satisfaction by specifying 

the needs, values, expectancies, or perceptions relevant to job satisfaction.  For instance,

expectancy theories of job satisfaction have hypothesized that job satisfaction is related to the 

discrepancy between current job experiences and expected levels of these same experiences 

(Locke, 1976).  A common thread among all of these theories is that satisfaction results from the 

degree to which workers attain the things they most desire from their jobs (Phillips, Barrett, & 

Rush,  1978).  For example, Phillips et al. (1978) proposed and found support for a congruence 

model of job satisfaction in which worker satisfaction occurs when perceived level of certain task 

characteristics was consistent with the employee’s preferred level.

Similarly to organizational commitment, researchers have investigated the antecedents 

and consequences of job satisfaction.  A correlate relevant to the present research is age.  The 

aging of the work force points toward the importance of studying the relationship between age 

and job satisfaction (White & Spector,  1987).  Rhodes (1983) reviewed the literature involving 

age and overall job satisfaction.  Twenty-eight samples were analyzed and a positive linear 

relationship between age and overall job satisfaction was found in 22 samples.

Research on age and facet satisfaction is equivocal, however.  In Rhodes’ (1983) review, 

the only facet showing a consistently positive relation with age is satisfaction with work itself.

The relationship between age and the other facets is variable across studies.

Theorists have proposed several explanations for the age - job satisfaction link.  Glenn, 

Taylor, and Weaver (1977) tested aging (with increased age comes increased extrinsic rewards for 

work) and cohort (higher education among the young results in less satisfaction at routine jobs) 

explanations for the positive relationship between age and job satisfaction.  Neither explanation 

was supported and the authors speculated that the wrong variables were tapped to test these 

explanations.

White and Spector (1987) criticized previous age - satisfaction research in terms of the 

following;  (1) failure to provide data on sample age distributions, (2) inadequate age 

distributions, (3) arbitrary age categorizations, (4) inadequate sample sizes, (5)  inadequate 

measures of job satisfaction, and (6) failure to control for important relevant variables.  They 

dealt with these issues in their own research by:  (1) providing for an adequate age distribution

16

which was not arbitrarily reduced to categories, (2) obtaining an adequate sample size, and (3) 

including relevant variables from previous research.  White and Spector (1987) were testing 

Wright and Hamilton’s (1978) job change hypothesis which speculated that older workers are 

more satisfied with their jobs than are younger workers because over the years, experience and 

seniority may lead to better jobs.

Their results supported Phillips et aL (1978) findings with regard to job congruence.

The more that managers perceived they had what they preferred, the more satisfied they were 

with their jobs.  Results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of age on job 

satisfaction were indirect and that older workers’ higher satisfaction in the sample was a result of 

their greater congruence, higher salary, longer tenure, and more internal locus of control.

As was the case with commitment, job satisfaction has been linked with a variety of 

work outcomes.  Although these findings have been discussed previously, it is important to note 

that the role of job satisfaction in turnover decisions is sometimes viewed as indirect (Mobley, 

1977).  Mobley (1977) views intent to quit as a more direct predictor of turnover than job 

satisfaction.

Another issue is the causal ordering of relationship between job satisfaction and 

commitment.  Research in this area is equivocal and is not seen as directly relevant to the present 

literature review.  The assumption that job satisfaction influences commitment may not be true 

(Curry et al., 1986).  Some researchers have found no basis for asserting that satisfaction has a 

causal effect on commitment or vice versa (Curry et al., 1986; Dougherty, Bluedom & Keon, 

1985).  Dougherty et al. (1985) compared two models of precursors to turnover.  Support was 

found for a fit between model and data when satisfaction and commitment were treated as 

independent predictors of intent.  Conversely, no support was found for the model where 

satisfaction influenced commitment which, in turn, influenced intent.  This research casts doubt 

on the satisfaction-commitment-intent sequence in the turnover process.

On the other hand, Williams and Hazer (1986) found evidence of a causal relationship 

between job satisfaction and commitment.  Farkas and Tetrick (1989) tested the William and

Hazer models with longitudinal data.  Although the importance of a link between satisfaction and 

commitment was evident the direction of causation changed over time.  Satisfaction influenced 

commitment during times one and three while commitment influenced satisfaction at time two. 

Finally, several researchers have found organizational commitment to be an antecedent to job 

satisfaction rather than an outcome of it (Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Dossett & Suskzko, 1989).

Research with regard to age and both commitment and job satisfaction raise questions 

as to whether age only indirectly affects these attitudes, through its relationship with other 

relevant variables.  For instance, Williams and Hazer (1986) found age to be only indirectly 

related to commitment through its effects on job satisfaction.

What is needed is a theoretical structure with which to deal with these inconsistencies. 

The next section will develop the importance of self-esteem as a framework for the understanding 

of work outcomes such as satisfaction and commitment as well as its possible mediating role in 

the age-outcome relationship.

Self-Esteem

In past years, the use of personality constructs in industrial/organizational research has 

fallen from favor.  Recently, however, there has been a renewed interest in the use of personality 

variables in industrial/organizational psychology (e.g., Weiss & Adler,  1984).  Examples of this 

have been the recent investigations into the influence of self-esteem with regard to a number of 

organizational phenomena.  Recent work on organization-based self-esteem links this construct to 

both satisfaction and commitment (Pierce et al., 1989).

Several types of self-esteem have been identified and they reflect different levels of 

specificity.  Pierce et al. (1989)  discuss the following definitions:  (1) global - referring to overall 

evaluations of self-worth, (2) role-specific - indicating the self-evaluation of one of the individuals’ 

roles in society, and (3) task-specific - representing an individual’s competence in a particular 

task.  Although many global and task-specific measures of self-esteem have been developed, the 

validity of these measures has been questioned.  Many researchers have developed their own

scales and have begun to address research issues without assessing the construct validity of the 

measures (Schwab, 1980; Tharenou, 1979).

A related issue involves the appropriateness of the type of self-esteem measured in a 

given situation (Tharenou, 1979). Researchers have recognized the importance of utilizing 

measures of self-esteem which are congruous with the context of the research.  According to 

Tharenou (1979), task-specific behaviors are best assessed with task-specific measures of 

self-esteem while global self-esteem is more appropriate when studying individuals within the 

context of total life events.  A measure of organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) was developed 

to study relationships between self-esteem and variables traditionally employed in organizational 

paradigms.  Organization-based self-esteem focuses on an individual’s assessment of his or her 

organizational worth.  This construct has been operationalized as the degree to which 

organizational members believe they can satisfy their needs through their participation in roles 

within the organizational context (Pierce et al., 1989).

Swann’s (1985) self-verification formulation of human behavior provides a theoretical 

basis for the present research.  Lecky (1945) first introduced the notion that individuals engage in 

behaviors and cognitive activities that verify, validate, and sustain their self-concepts.  An 

implication of this view is that people will strive to confirm and verify those self-views that have 

become relatively certain (Swann, 1985).  Applying this theory to the present research, individuals 

with high levels of OBSE will perceive themselves as valuable and will attempt to engage in 

behaviors valued in their organization.  Low OBSE employees are predicted to do the opposite in 

order to preserve their self views (Pierce et al.,  1989).

The construct validity of OBSE was demonstrated in a series of seven studies described 

by Pierce et al.  (1989).  Results of their research highlighted the internal consistency and 

test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, incremental, predictive, and concurrent validity of 

OBSE.  Based upon evidence of a significant relationship with OBSE, managerial respect, job 

complexity, and mechanistic design were identified as important to its development.  Further, 

OBSE was hypothesized and found to be significantly related to several outcome variables such

19

as:  (1) intrinsic work motivation; (2) job performance; (3) general job satisfaction;  (4) 

organizational satisfaction; (5)  organizational citizenship; and (6)  organizational commitment. 

Finally, the seven studies used as a basis for testing the OBSE construct varied in the nature of 

the respondents.  The nature of the respondents did not affect the relationships between OBSE 

and the hypothesized organizational outcomes, thus providing evidence of external validity.

Testing the links between OBSE and specified antecedents and consequences within a 

developmental framework was a useful means of exploring any age-related differences in these 

linkages.  However, no research to date has focused on variations in OBSE by age.

Developmental literature which focuses on age and global or task specific self-esteem reveals 

mixed results which will be discussed below.  What is evident, however, is the importance of the 

self-esteem construct in developmental and career theory research.  A major area of research 

among life span developmental psychologists concerns the stability or change in an individual’s 

personality over time (Costa & McCrae, 1988).  Research on self and self-conceptions enables 

the study of stability and change within a focused framework (Bengtson et al., 1985).

Bengtson et al. (1985) reviewed seventeen studies of age differences in self-esteem.  The 

majority of the studies showed either higher self-esteem in older cohorts or no age differences. 

These findings are likely to be somewhat confounded due to the variability of the measuring 

instruments.  Ten different instruments were used to assess self-esteem within the seventeen 

studies.

Bengtson et al. (1985) drew some generalizations based upon the reviewed research. 

First, although global self-esteem may be as high or higher for older adults than younger adults, 

specific competence-related dimensions of self-esteem may show decreases with age.  Second, a 

number of studies suggest that social, situational, and personal life changes are as important as 

chronological age in the description of self-esteem.

The importance of self-concept is also evident in the area of vocational development. 

Super (1984) proposed a developmental self-concept theory of career development which 

assumed that over the lifespan individuals try to integrate their self-concept with what they do on

the job.  This fixed sequence stage theory posits five life stages and developmental tasks implicit 

to each stage.

Sterns and Patchett (1984) proposed a non-age-specific model of career progression 

that assumes that work life transitions may occur many times throughout a career (Stems & 

Alexander, 1988; Sterns & Patchett, 1984; Stems, 1986).  According to this model, the decision to 

change jobs is directly influenced by an individual’s mobility attitudes and propensity to move as 

well as level of commitment to career development activities.  Mobility attitudes are directly 

influenced by a number of factors including:  (1) age-related variables, (2) personality variables, 

(3) motives for moving, (4) individual barriers to moving,  (5) system constraints on mobility, (6) 

chance encounters, and (7) perceived organizational constraints on mobility.  The decision to 

change jobs can also influence one’s attitudes toward entering or re-entering the work force.

The model also discusses the process of career planning in terms of Hall’s (1971) 

goal-setting conceptualization of career growth.  Career development activities, such as training 

and continuing education, may lead to increased self-esteem if the goal is attained.  This esteem 

enhancement may lead to greater self-efficacy (Bandura, 1982) and to increased commitment to 

future career development goals.  Negative experiences with regard to goal attainment may result 

in decreased self-efficacy and decreased commitment to career development and planning 

Finally, this increased or decreased commitment as well as mobility attitudes may influence the 

decision to change jobs.

Pierce et al. (1989) suggest the link between OBSE and organization-related 

behaviors/attitudes.  The present research combines this organizational finding with the 

importance of self-concept throughout life to assess age differences in OBSE as well as with 

regard to organizational commitment and satisfaction.  This will enable a better understanding of 

a worker’s commitment to an organization as well as his/her perceptions of movement 

opportunities.

Consistent with the importance of self-esteem in developmental and career theory 

research are findings relating self-esteem with organizational variables.  Significant relationships

have been found between global and task-specific measures of self-esteem and several 

organizational variables.  These will be reviewed below.

Antecedents to Self-Esteem.  Although variables are grouped according to hypothesized 

antecedents and consequences, much of the research is correlational and thus directional 

relationships can only be inferred.  Both work and non-work factors are predictive of self-esteem 

but the present review will focus on work-related determinants.

Intrinsic Job Characteristics.  A recent review and subsequent research indicate that job 

characteristics such as autonomy, participation in decision making, job variety, skilled content, 

and low role overload have consistently shown a significant positive relationship with self-esteem 

(Brockner, 1988; Tharenou, 1979; Tharenou & Harker, 1982).  Research exhibiting this 

relationship reflects global and work role self-esteem as well as sense of competence.  Although 

the results are consistent, correlations are low and researchers suggest a more appropriate design 

would involve multivariate analysis of several variables (Tharenou & Harker,  1982).  Tharenou 

and Harker (1982) investigated the association of job complexity, job level, job performance, and 

job satisfaction with both global self-esteem and sense of competence.  Results support the 

importance of the organizational variables of job complexity and job satisfaction in accounting for 

substantial variance in competence but not global self-esteem.  This reflects the differential 

nature of the relationship between organizational variables and different types of self-esteem and 

magnifies the importance of using an organizational level of self-esteem in this type of research.

Extrinsic Job Characteristics.  Contextual variables including economic and 

interpersonal aspects of the work situation also show a significant relationship with self-esteem. 

These variables include pay and job level (economic) along with the social relationship between 

employees and their coworkers and supervisors (interpersonal).

Research with regard to the relationship between self-esteem and extrinsic 

characteristics results in a positive relationship less often than does research assessing the 

relationship between self-esteem and intrinsic factors.  However, Pierce et al.  (1989)  did find a 

significant relationship between organization type (mechanistic versus organic) and OBSE.

22

Finally, Pierce et al. (1989) found that perceptions  of managerial respect for 

organization members was positively related with OBSE.  This is consistent with the notion that 

self-esteem is related to perceptions of personal value and worth.

Consequences of Self-Esteem.  Self-esteem has been related to work attitudes and 

behaviors (Brockner, 1988) including job satisfaction.  Further, job satisfaction has been linked 

with lower turnover and absenteeism (Mobley et al., 1979; Mowday et al.,  1982).  Job satisfaction 

has been assessed globally as well as in terms of specific facets of an employee’s job (Locke, 

1976).

Job Satisfaction and Organization Commitment.  Tharenou’s (1979) review of employee 

self-esteem reveals many studies which indicate significant positive relationships between job 

satisfaction and global self-esteem as well as job satisfaction and sense of competence.  Further, 

job satisfaction accounted for a large amount of the variance in sense of competence even with 

the addition of other explanatory variables (Tharenou & Harker,  1982).  No such relationship was 

evident with the measure of global self-esteem.  Pierce et al. (1989) found OBSE to be 

significantly and positively correlated with both job and organizational satisfaction.  OBSE was 

significantly and highly correlated (r  =  .77) with organizational satisfaction.  This correlation was 

larger than the correlation between organizational satisfaction and global self-esteem (r  =  .39). 

This provides further evidence for the usefulness of OBSE when studying organization based 

outcomes and attitudes.  Pierce et al., (1989)  hypothesized that increased self-acceptance within 

an organizational context would be associated with increased attachment to the organization 

(affective commitment).  They tested and found support for this hypothesis in a series of studies 

involving five separate samples.

The hypotheses proposed in the present research follow from  the materials presented 

previously.  To summarize, the present research explored the different facets of commitment with 

the use of McGee and Ford’s (1987) modification of Meyer and Allen’s (1984) affective and 

two-prong continuance commitment indicators.  Additional items have been generated for the 

continuance commitment subscales based upon research on occupational mobility.

The relationship with regard to age and perceived alternatives may not be linear but 

rather curvilinear with younger and older (close to retirement age) workers perceiving fewer 

alternatives than workers in the other age ranges.  Younger workers’ perceptions may reflect lack 

of experience.  On the other hand, the older worker’s perceptions of few alternatives may be 

consistent with the research on mobility which finds a negative relationship between age and 

propensity to move (Veiga, 1983) and perceived ease of movement (Landau & Hammer, 1986), 

Further, the present research addressed the level of analysis issue by assessing 

self-esteem at the organizational level.  This is more consistent with the outcome variables in 

question than is a global measure of self-esteem.  Although research indicates increases or 

stability in global self-esteem with age, no research to date had addressed age differences in 

OBSE.

The links between OBSE and job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, and 

organizational commitment were studied along with any age differences in these variables.  Pierce 

et aL (1989) hypothesized and found positive relationships between OBSE and organizational 

satisfaction, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.  Consistent with Swann’s (1985) 

self-verification view, employees high in OBSE will engage in behaviors valued in their 

organization.  The opposite will be true for low OBSE employees in order to preserve self-views. 

One goal of the present research was to replicate Pierce et al’s. (1989) findings with regard to job 

and organizational satisfaction:

HI. 

There will be a significant  positive relationship between organizational satisfaction and

OBSE.

H2. 

There will be a significant  positive relationship between job satisfaction and OBSE.

24

H3b. 

The relationship between OBSE and perceived sacrifice commitment is not expected to

be significant.

H3c. 

There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived alternatives

commitment and OBSE due to the differential perceptions of alternatives.

Age and job satisfaction often show a consistent positive relationship and the present 

research expects to replicate this finding.  The research with regard to age and organizational 

commitment is less definitive and the exploration of age and continuance commitment is limited. 

Although strong relationships exist between age and affective commitment, the present research 

also hypothesized age differences in the two dimensions of continuance commitment with older 

employees experiencing higher perceived sacrifice commitment due to increased investment in the 

organization.  Further, a curvilinear relationship was hypothesized between age and perceived 

alternatives commitment with younger and older employees perceiving fewer alternatives than 

other employees and therefore experiencing higher levels of this type of commitment.

will increase with increases in age.

CHAPTER III 

METHOD

Sutisflts

One hundred and two employees from a northeastern investment company were used in 

the present research.  Power analyses were conducted to define ideal sample sizes for the 

analyses (Cohen,  1988).  Sample sizes of 62 and 90 were needed for the regression analyses and 

MANOVA, respectively.  These figures were based upon a power analysis with an alpha level set 

at .05, power level set at .80, and the estimated effect size set at r  =  .50 (regression analyses)  and 

r  =  .10 (MANOVA).  Three age groups were formed for the age analyses:  21-35 years, 36-50 

years, and 51 years and up.  The age ranges were chosen in an attempt to assess any age 

differences for individuals until the traditional retirement age of 65.  These age groups roughly 

encompass Levinson’s formulation of adult development with several methodological constraints. 

For instance, the total age range was subject to the availability at the company tested in the 

present research.  Further, equal age intervals were provided (Krauss, 1980).

Materials

This section describes all the measures utilized as a part of the present research.  A 

copy of individual scales and items is included in the Appendix A.

Global Self-Esteem.  Global self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg’s (1965)  10-item 

scale.  This scale is a well established measurement of global self-esteem (Pierce et al.,  1989).

The scale requires respondents to indicate their agreement or disagreement with statements 

about their perceived worth/confidence.  Responses to each item fall on a four point scale 

ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (4) and individual’s scores were summed

27

across the ten items.  The internal consistency reliability of this measure is well established.  Two 

items in this scale were reverse scored prior to analysis.

Organization-Based Self-Esteem (OBSEl.  The Pierce et al. (1989) measure of OBSE 

was used in the present research to tap the extent to which employees perceive that they are 

valuable as organization members acting within an organizational context.  The scale consists of 

ten items generated by Pierce et al. (1989) to reflect what employees consider when making 

judgments of themselves as “...valuable, worthwhile, and effectual members of their employing 

organizations” (p. 634).  Respondents indicated their agreement with each item based upon a five 

point Likert response scale ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5).  All ten items 

were reverse scored prior to analysis.

The internal consistency of this scale ranged from alpha  =  .86 to .96 in the seven 

studies done to validate the measure.  The average coefficient alpha was .91.  Test-retest 

reliability was measured in one study and the resulting coefficient was .87 after controlling for 

perceived organizational change.  Further, the OBSE correlated more highly with global and task 

specific measures of self-esteem than with non self-esteem measures providing evidence for the 

convergent validity of the OBSE scale.  Finally, initial evidence of discriminant, incremental, 

predictive and concurrent validity were also obtained in a series of studies (Pierce et al.,  1989).

Affective Commitment.  Meyer and Allen’s (1984) eight-item Affective Commitment 

Scale was utilized to measure affective commitment.  This type of commitment involves an 

individual’s identification and involvement in the organization.  Responses to each Likert type 

item fall on a seven point continuum ranging from strongly disagree  (1)  to strongly agree  (7).

Four items were reverse scored prior to analysis.  Examples of the items include:  “I do not feel 

a strong sense of belonging to my organization” and “I enjoy discussing my organization with 

people outside it.”  Internal consistency reliability estimates were calculated in two studies by 

Meyer and Allen (1984).  The coefficient alpha’s were .88 and .84.  McGee and Ford (1987)  also 

found a coefficient alpha of .88.  The affective commitment scale correlated highly with the

Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, a measure of affective orientation to an organization 

(Meyer & Allen, 1984).

Continuance Commitment.  A revised version of Meyer and Allen’s (1984) continuance 

commitment measure was utilized in the present study.  This facet of commitment reflects the 

extent to which an employee feels committed to their organization due to costs they perceive to 

be associated with leaving.  An assessment of the psychometric properties of this scale resulted in 

a revised measure with two distinct dimensions (McGee & Ford, 1987).  The resultant scales 

tapped commitment based on few existing employment alternatives (perceived alternatives 

commitment) and commitment based on personal sacrifice involved with leaving the organization 

(perceived sacrifice commitment).  Each scale contains three items derived from the original 

measure and two new items.  Responses were coded according to a seven point Likert type 

response format ranging from strongly disagree (1)  to strongly agree (7).  Internal consistency 

reliability estimates (Cronbach’s alpha) for the unmodified perceived alternatives commitment 

and perceived sacrifice commitment scales were .72 and .71, respectively.

Although Meyer and Allen (1984) found the original continuance commitment scale to 

be uncorrelated with two affective measures of commitment, analyses involving perceived 

alternatives and perceived sacrifice commitment indicated a significant positive relationship 

between affective commitment and perceived sacrifice commitment and a significant negative 

relationship between affective commitment and perceived alternatives commitment (McGee & 

Ford,  1987).  Sample items for the original perceived alternatives and perceived sacrifice 

commitment scales include:  “I feel I have too few options to consider leaving this organization” 

and “It would be very hard for me to leave my organization right now, even if I wanted to”, 

respectively.  The following items were generated and added to the existing perceived sacrifice 

commitment scale:  “A major reason that I continue to work for this organization is that it is 

unlikely that I could find the job security that I now have if I leave” and “The investment I have 

in this organization in terms of seniority is a major reason for my not leaving”.  The following 

items were added to the existing perceived alternatives commitment scale:  “I cannot leave this

organization if I wanted to because I lack the necessary skills to find a comparable job” and “I 

cannot leave this organization because job market conditions limit any available alternatives”.

General Job Satisfaction.  General job satisfaction was measured with Hackman and 

Oldham’s (1975) five-item job satisfaction instrument.  Responses to the Likert type items range 

from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).  Two items in this scale were reverse scored 

prior to analysis.  Many researchers have utilized this scale and reliability estimates include 

Spearman-Brown reliabilities of .80 (Feldman, 1976) and .76 (Hackman & Oldham, 1975). 

Significant relationships between general job satisfaction and specific facet satisfactions were 

found by Oldham, Hackman, and Stepina (1978).

Organizational Satisfaction.  Organizational satisfaction was measured with the five-item 

Company Identification subscale of Smith’s (1976) Index of Organizational Reactions.  This scale 

taps an employee’s attitude about his/her organization in general.  There are five possible 

responses to each item.  Two items in this scale were reverse scored prior to analysis.  Dunham, 

Smith and Blackburn (1977) report a median internal reliability across five samples of .82 for the 

Company Identification scale.

Turnover Intent.  Intent to turnover was measured by a two-item scale developed by 

Jones (1986):  “I will probably look for a new job in the coming year,” and “I scan the 

newspapers and other sources for prospective jobs.”  Responses to the Likert type items range 

from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5).  Both of the scale items were reverse scored 

prior to analysis.

Demographic Items.  Demographic information was collected through a series of items 

preceding the study scales.  These demographic variables included age, gender, general job 

category, job and organization tenure, and education level.  Respondents were asked to supply 

their age, job tenure, and organizational tenure in years.  They were also given an open-ended 

item which requested that they classify their general job category.  This item caused confusion 

among employees so the following general job category classifications were verbally supplied to 

all employees as a basis for responding:  general operations (clerks), supervisor, executive,

accountant, computer programmer, other professional, service representatives, other clerical, and 

secretarial.  These categories were combined to form overall managerial (supervisor, executive) 

and clerical (general operations, other clerical, secretarial) categories.  The remaining employees 

were tested in order to provide complete feedback to the organization but were not included in 

the present research analyses.

Next, respondents indicated gender by checking either male or female.  Finally, 

employees were asked to indicate their highest level of education completed from the following 

list:  grade school, high school, two year college degree, four year college degree, masters degree, 

doctoral degree, and other.  Both job and organizational tenure were employed as covariates to 

the hypothesized age-work outcome relationships.

Procedure

Questionnaires were distributed to employees of a northeastern investment company. 

Although all employees were surveyed, initial analyses were completed to search for any job-type 

differences on the variables of interest.  Details of these analyses will be reported in the Results 

section of this report.  All participants were assured of the confidentiality of their responses both 

by the cover sheet explaining the nature of the project and by an organization-wide voice message 

sent by an organization administrator prior to the initiation of the research.  The cover sheet 

described the project as an effort to assess the workers’ perceptions of the organization, its 

practices, and some work experiences.

Further, respondents were informed that any information fed back to the organization 

would be in aggregated form to insure individual confidentiality.  Respondents were given a 

choice of several time slots in which to complete the survey materials.  Data were gathered and 

collected within the organization in a group format.

CHAPTER IV 

RESULTS

This chapter is divided into several sections.  First, sample descriptive data are 

discussed.  The results of a MANOVA performed to search for job category differences in 

work-related attitudes is included in this section.  Second, reliability data are presented.  Included 

in this section is a comparison of the original and revised continuance commitment subscales. 

Results relevant to the major focus of the research follow.  Specifically, the relationships between 

self-esteem and work-related attitudes (e.g., satisfaction, commitment) are examined.  Next, any 

age differences in these attitudes are analyzed.  Finally, supplementary analyses and their 

implications are detailed.  The raw data for the present research is found in Appendix B.

Sample Characteristics

For purposes of analyses, age was measured as a continuous variable and later classified 

into three age groups for use in the MANOVA:  (1) 20-35 years (n  =  40); (2) 36-50 years 

(n  =  30); and (3) 51 years and up (n  =  30).  The present study utilized 102 employees from a 

northeastern investment company.  Thirty-two were male (323%), 67 were female (67.7%), and 3 

employees did not specify gender.  The percentages reported have been corrected to account for 

those individuals who did not specify gender when responding to the survey.  See Table 1 for a 

breakdown of age by gender.  The average age of the employees was 40.5 years, with a standard 

deviation of 13.8.  All of the respondents had received a high school education or above, with a 

range from high school to Masters level education (see Table 2).  Correlations between the 

demographic variables of age, job tenure, organizational tenure, gender, and education as well as 

the correlations between these demographic variables and the work outcomes (e.g., job 

satisfaction, affective commitment) are found in Appendix C.

Both job and organizational tenure data were gathered.  The average job tenure for 

employees responding to the survey was 3.9 years while the average organizational tenure was 7.4 

years.  The employees fell into two main job categories:  managerial and clerical.  Thirty-nine 

managerial (38.2%) and 63 clerical (61.8%) workers were the basis for the present research.  See 

Table 2 for additional demographic information.

A MANOVA was done in order to uncover any possible job category differences on the 

following list of outcome variables relevant to the present research:  job satisfaction, affective 

commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, perceived alternatives commitment, organizational 

satisfaction, turnover intent, organization-based self-esteem, and global self-esteem.  The overall 

MANOVA reflecting job category and work attitudes was significant F(8, 86)  =  2.32, p < .05. 

However, none of the univariate F-tests were significant atp<.05. Organizational satisfaction was 

the only variable which approached significance F(l, 93)  =  3.80, p  < .054.  Subsequently, subjects 

were combined across job categories for all analyses.

An ANOVA was also performed to test for any age differences in job category which 

might complicate the interpretation of other analyses.  No significant age differences by job 

category emerged, F(2, 96)  =  2.26, p  =  .11.

Psychometric Properties of the Scales

Reliability analyses were performed on all of the scales used in the present research.

Part of the present research involved the addition of items to the perceived sacrifice and 

perceived alternatives commitment subscales.  A description of these items is found in the 

Method section.  The internal consistency reliability estimates for the perceived sacrifice 

commitment subscale increased from Cronbach’s alpha  =  .68 to .73 with the addition of two 

items.  Thus, the revised scale was used for all analysis purposes.  The practical increase in 

reliability associated with the five-item revised scale warrants its use in future analyses.

There was no noticeable improvement in internal consistency reliability when items 

were added to the perceived alternatives commitment subscale, however.  Cronbach’s alpha  =  .79 

for both the original and the revised scale.  Consequently, the use of the revised perceived

alternatives commitment subscale is unjustified.  The original perceived alternatives commitment 

and revised perceived sacrifice commitment scales were utilized in all subsequent analyses 

involving continuance commitment.

Table 3 presents means, standard deviations, and  correlations for each scale used in 

the study.  Cronbach’s coefficient alpha (internal consistency reliability) estimates are presented 

in parentheses along the diagonal of the table.  The scales used in the present research all had 

satisfactory internal consistency reliability values ranging from .73 (for revised perceived sacrifice 

commitment) to .92 (for OBSE).

It was hypothesized that OBSE would be significantly and positively correlated with 

global self-esteem.  The convergent validity of OBSE was demonstrated in the present research. 

The correlation between OBSE and global self-esteem  (r  =  .46, p  < .001) was stronger in 

magnitude than were the correlations between OBSE and study variables representing different 

constructs (e.g., organizational satisfaction, affective commitment; r’s  =  .27 and 39, respectively). 

Replicating the findings of Pierce et al. (1989), the magnitude of the correlations presented 

provide evidence for the convergent validity of the OBSE measure.

Self-Esteem and Work-Related Attitudes

Correlational analyses were used to test for the presence of significant, positive 

relationships between OBSE and each of the following four work-related attitudes:  (1) job 

satisfaction, (2) organizational satisfaction, (3) affective commitment, and  (4) perceived 

alternatives commitment.  A nonsignificant relationship was hypothesized between OBSE and 

perceived sacrifice commitment.  In general, the data suggest that OBSE is significantly related to 

a worker’s satisfaction and affective commitment to the organization; all attitudes except 

perceived alternatives commitment showed a positive, statistically significant relationship with 

OBSE.

As hypothesized, OBSE was significantly and positively related to organizational 

satisfaction (HI).  The Pearson correlation coefficient was .27.  The results also indicated that 

higher levels of OBSE among employees were associated with higher levels of job satisfaction

Note:  Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency reliability estimates for scales are found along the
diagonal.  Possible values for the affective commitment, continuance commitments, and 
job satisfaction scales range from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree.  Possible 
values for the global self-esteem, organization-based self-esteem, and turnover intent 
scales range from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree.  The organizational 
satisfaction scale was scored on a five point continuum with (1) reflecting low 
organizational satisfaction and (5) reflecting high organizational satisfaction.

(H2).  The Pearson correlation coefficient between OBSE and job satisfaction was .41.  The 

present research supports the previously observed link between OBSE and affective commitment; 

OBSE was significantly and positively associated with the affective commitment held by 

employees toward their employing organization (H3a).  The Pearson correlation coefficient 

between OBSE and affective commitment was 39.

The hypotheses with regard to continuance commitment and OBSE were exploratory.

It was suggested that persons with higher OBSE would perceive fewer viable alternatives outside 

of their present work situation since by the very nature of OBSE, they would feel that they were 

valuable in their present work environment.  Therefore, they might perceive that few alternatives 

could compare to their present situation.  This would result in a positive correlation between 

OBSE and perceived alternatives commitment (H3c).  This hypothesis was not supported in the 

present research, however.  The correlation coefficient was not significant atpc.Q5 level 

(r  =  -.08).  Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be no relationship between OBSE and 

perceived sacrifice commitment (H3b).  A significant positive relationship was found, however 

(r =  .23; p  < .01).

In summary, three of five initial hypotheses relating OBSE with work-related attitudes 

were supported in the present research (HI, H2, and H3a).  The two exploratory hypotheses 

were not supported; no relationship was found between OBSE and perceived alternatives 

commitment (contrary to H3b) and a significant positive relationship was found between OBSE 

and perceived sacrifice commitment (contrary to H3c).

Age-Related Hypotheses

Age and job satisfaction often show a consistent positive relationship.  Further, a 

positive association has also been evident between age and other variables such as affective 

commitment and global measures of self-esteem.  Hypotheses 4-8 explore possible age differences 

in OBSE (H4), job satisfaction (H5), organizational satisfaction (H6), affective commitment 

(H7), and perceived sacrifice commitment (H8).  A MANOVA was performed with the 

independent variable of age and eight dependent variables consisting of OBSE, global

self-esteem, affective commitment, perceived alternatives commitment, perceived sacrifice 

commitment, organizational satisfaction, job satisfaction, and turnover intent.  The MANOVA 

was used in order to control for experimentwise Type I and II error rates which escalate with the 

introduction of multiple dependent variables (Haase & Ellis, 1987).

The overall results of the MANOVA were statistically significant, based upon the Wilks 

Lambda multivariate test statistic, F(16,176)  =  233,p <.01.  Univariate F-tests for the variables 

of global self-esteem, organizational satisfaction and perceived alternatives commitment were 

significant at an alpha level of .05.  Support was not found for the hypotheses concerning 

significant increases in OBSE, job satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived sacrifice 

commitment with age.  Table 4 presents univariate F-tests corresponding to age and the work 

attitudes.  Age was also entered into regression analyses as an alternative way of exploring the 

age-work attitude relationship.  Results were consistent with those of the MANOVA and are 

found in Appendix D.  Other factors might have confounded the age-work attitude relationships 

and will be detailed in the discussion section.

The Student Newman-Keuls procedure was performed in order to identify where among 

the age groups any significant differences in global self-esteem, organizational satisfaction, and 

perceived alternatives commitment may exist.  Results of the first Student Newman-Keuls analysis 

indicate that individuals in the 51 and up age group have significantly higher global self-esteem 

than do individuals in either the 20-35 or 36-50 year old age groups.  Employees aged 20-35 and 

36-50 years did not differ significantly from each other in their levels of global self-esteem.  Table 

4 reports mean global self-esteem by age group.  Although age differences exist, the mean values 

of global self-esteem indicate that all employees had high levels of perceived overall worth (high 

global self-esteem).

The results with regard to organizational satisfaction were not in the hypothesized 

direction.  Employees aged 20-35 had significantly higher levels of organizational satisfaction than 

did either the employees in the 36-50 years or 51 and up years age group.  Employees aged 36-50 

and 51 and up did not differ significantly from each other in their levels of organizational

satisfaction.  Finally, individuals in the 51 years and up age group have significantly higher levels 

of perceived alternatives commitment than do individuals aged 20-35.  No significant differences 

in perceived alternatives commitment emerged with the other age categories.

A MANCOVA was performed with age and OBSE, global self-esteem, affective 

commitment, perceived alternatives commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, job satisfaction, 

organizational satisfaction, and turnover intent in order to control for the influence of job and 

organizational tenure on the age-work outcome relationships.  Even after controlling for job and 

organizational tenure influences, the overall MANOVA was found to be significant based upon 

the Wilks Lambda test statistic, F(16,160)  =  1.75,p<:05.  However, global self-esteem was the 

only variable significantly related with age after the effects of tenure were partialled out, F(2,

87)  =  3.28,p <.05.  The relationship between age and both organizational satisfaction and 

perceived alternatives commitment was eliminated when tenure was introduced as a covariate.

The assumption of equality of regression slopes necessary for the interpretation of 

MANCOVA results was violated with the above set of variables and covariates.  Consequently, 

full and reduced model regression analyses were performed regressing global self-esteem on age 

while including job and organizational tenure as covariates.  These regression analyses were 

performed only with global self-esteem since it was the only statistically significant variable in the 

MANCOVA described previously.  The age ranges were represented by two dummy-coded age 

variables (G1 and G2).  G1 represents a contrast in which the “20-35 year” age range is coded as 

one and the “26-50” and “51 and up” age ranges are represented by zeros.  G2 represents a 

contrast in which the “36-50 year” age range is coded as one and the other two age ranges are 

represented by zeros.  The reduced model included the dummy-coded age variab!es(Gl and G2) 

and the two covariates, job and organizational tenure (CV1 and CV2, respectively).  The full 

model included the variables mentioned previously as well as the G1 X CV1, G1 X CV2, G2 X 

CV1, and G2 X CV2 interactions.  The lack of significant interactions, as well as a nonsignificant 

overall full model, F(8, 83)  =  1.84, p > .05, indicates that the violation of equality of regression 

slopes found in the original MANCOVA was not a result of the global self-esteem variable.

41

Rather, it may have reflected slope differences in the original model variables which did not show 

univariate significance, such as OBSE, affective commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, 

perceived alternatives commitment, job satisfaction, or organizational satisfaction.  In this case, 

the integrity of the analysis remains intact and the age differences in global self-esteem 

mentioned previously can be interpreted.

A curvilinear relationship was hypothesized between age and perceived alternatives 

commitment such that the youngest and oldest age groups would have higher perceived 

alternatives commitment than would the middle age group.  This relationship was tested within a 

regression framework through the addition of a quadratic model term to the original age variable 

followed by an assessment of the incremental R2 with the addition of the quadratic model term. 

Results do not support the existence of a curvilinear relationship.  Age was a significant predictor 

of perceived alternatives commitment in the reduced model, R 2  =  .04; F(l, 97)  =  4.08, p < .05. 

The addition of the quadratic age term did not result in a significant increase in the R2 of the 

model (R2 change  =  .02; F(l, 97)  =  2.11,p>.05).

Exploratory Analyses

Supplementary analyses were performed to explore other possible variables beyond 

OBSE which might account for significant portions of unexplained variance in job satisfaction, 

organizational satisfaction, affective and continuance commitment.  An assumption of the present 

research was that OBSE would be more predictive of each work-related attitude than would the 

individual level construct of global self-esteem because both OBSE and the attitude reflect an 

individual’s assessment of a facet of the organizational situation.  For this reason, both 

organization-based and global self-esteem were entered as predictors in another series of 

regression analyses in order to assess whether the inclusion of OBSE in models of work-related 

attitudes would add significantly to the R2 value of the model.  Tests for significant incremental 

changes in R2 with the addition of OBSE to the regression equations including global self-esteem 

were performed to indicate what role OBSE might play in an optimal equation.

Table 5 reports the R2 values for the one variable model (including global self-esteem) 

as well as the incremental R2 with the addition of OBSE.  The inclusion of OBSE resulted in 

significant incremental R2 change values for job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, affective 

commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, and turnover intent.  It appears, then, that the 

addition of OBSE adds significantly to the prediction of selected work attitudes.

When OBSE and global self-esteem are evaluated as potential predictors of perceived 

alternatives commitment, global self-esteem is the only significant predictor, R2  =  .04; F( 1,

100)  =  435, p  < .05.  Higher levels of global self-esteem are accompanied by lower levels of 

perceived alternatives commitment.  The addition of OBSE does not add significantly to the 

prediction of perceived alternatives commitment.

To further support the efficacy of OBSE over global self-esteem in relation to other 

organization-based constructs (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, commitment), the 

correlations between OBSE and these constructs were contrasted with the correlations between 

global self-esteem and these work-related attitudes (see Table 6).  Tests for the equality of 

dependent correlations were applied to each of the correlation pairs.  Steiger (1980) recommends 

accounting for the correlation between the predictors when comparing the equality of these types 

of correlation coefficients.  All of the contrasting correlation pairs were significantly different 

from each other except for the correlation coefficients relating to perceived alternatives 

commitment.

Along with this, organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived 

sacrifice commitment have significant positive correlations with OBSE (r’s  =  .27, 39, and .23, 

respectively) and are not significantly correlated with global self-esteem (r’s  =  -.05, .02, and -.13, 

respectively).  Further, although job satisfaction is significantly and positively correlated with both 

the global and organizational level measures of self-esteem, the correlation between OBSE and 

job satisfaction (r  =  .41) is significantly higher than is the correlation between global self-esteem 

and job satisfaction (r =  .22).  Consistent with the results of the regression analyses, OBSE is not 

significantly correlated with perceived alternatives commitment.  On the other hand, global

self-esteem does exhibit a significant, negative correlation with perceived alternatives commitment 

(r =  -.20).  Overall, these findings support the notion that organizational specific self-esteem is 

more strongly associated with the organization-related phenomena measured in the present 

research than is global self-esteem, with the exception of perceived alternatives commitment.

Next, job satisfaction, affective commitment, organizational satisfaction, perceived 

sacrifice commitment, and perceived alternatives commitment were regressed on OBSE, global 

self-esteem, and their interaction in a series of regression analyses.  A significant global 

self-esteem by OBSE interaction was found with the measure of affective commitment.  With 

these two variables, the interaction term was a significant predictor in the regression equation at 

p <.05 level.

Figure 1 illustrates the nature of this interaction.  In the present sample of employees, 

the high global self-esteem group has a steeper slope, followed by the moderate and low groups, 

respectively.  This indicates that the relationship between affective commitment and OBSE is 

strongest for individuals in the high global self-esteem group, followed by individuals in the 

moderate global self-esteem group.  Finally, the relationship between affective commitment and 

OBSE is weakest for low global self-esteem individuals.

Although not the main focus of the present research, turnover intent was measured due 

to its conceptual and empirical links with a number of the present study variables such as job 

satisfaction and affective commitment (e.g., Curry et al.,  1986; Dougherty et al.,  1985; Farkas & 

Tetrick,  1989; Lee & Mowday,  1987; Michaels & Spector, 1982; Mowday et al., 1982; Porter & 

Steers, 1973; Williams & Hazer, 1986).  Further, its relationship with OBSE was assessed since 

turnover intent is an organizationally-related attitude.  Organization-based self-esteem is 

significantly end negatively associated with turnover intent in the present research (r  =  -.24;

p<.01).

Interestingly, although OBSE is significantly and negatively correlated with an 

employee’s intent to turnover, global self-esteem is unrelated to turnover intent (r  =  .01).  This 

finding lends further support to the efficacy of OBSE over global self-esteem in the prediction of

work-related attitudes.  This trend is also evident in tests for incremental R2 with the inclusion of 

OBSE as a predictor of work attitudes (see Table 5).  Similar to the results for job satisfaction, 

organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived sacrifice commitment, the 

addition of OBSE to a regression equation which includes global self-esteem as a predictor is 

accompanied by a significant increase in the proportion of variance accounted for in turnover 

intent.

CHAPTER V 

DISCUSSION

The discussion will be divided into several sections.  First, some general comments are 

offered.  Second, the relationships between self-esteem and work-related attitudes are discussed 

along with the implications of the supplemental analyses.  Third, any age differences in these 

attitudes are detailed.  Limitations of the present research as well as suggestions for future 

research accompany the above-mentioned discussions.

General Discussion

Several decisions were made during the course of the research which are relevant to 

discussions of obtained results.  First, all analyses were based upon a data set which was 

collapsed across job category (managerial and clerical).  Although the MANOVA with job 

category and study variables was significant, none of the univariate F-tests were significant at 

p < .05.  Some researchers have shown that combining samples across organizations is more 

problematic than combining data from across occupational levels within an organization  (Mowday 

et al., 1982).  However, it is important to experimentally control or account for as many 

extraneous influences as possible, especially with field research.  Future research should focus on 

attaining adequate sample sizes of employees in a number of occupational classifications to 

explore whether job category differences in work attitudes is a viable concern.

Next, the possible influences of job and organizational tenure on the results of 

age-related hypotheses were addressed by treating the tenure variables as covariates in covariance 

analyses.  Finally, possible age differences in job category were explored.  The ANOVA was n 

significant, F(2, 96)  =  2.26, p > .05.

Items were created for the perceived sacrifice and perceived alternatives commitment 

scales in order to improve the reliability of these measures and are found in the Method section. 

The addition of two items to the perceived sacrifice commitment scale increased its internal 

consistency reliability from .68 to .73.  The addition of two items to the perceived alternatives 

commitment scale did not result in an improvement to that scale’s internal consistency reliability. 

Cronbach’s alpha was .79 for both the original and the revised scale.  On the basis of this data, 

the original perceived alternatives and revised perceived sacrifice commitment scales were used 

for all research analyses.

Self-Esteem

The results of this study generally support the predictions concerning self-esteem.  An 

employee’s organization-based self-esteem was significantly and positively related to job 

satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, and affective commitment and negatively related to 

turnover intent.  Organization-based self-esteem was also significantly and positively related to 

perceived sacrifice commitment, contrary to predictions.  An in-depth exploration of the nature of 

the perceived sacrifice commitment scale uncovers the personal sacrifice in terms of life 

disruption, loss of job security, and seniority associated with leaving the organization.  Individuals 

with higher levels of OBSE may be more likely to stay at an organization long enough to 

establish job security and a degree of seniority.  This tendency may underlie the positive 

relationship between OBSE and perceived sacrifice commitment that was revealed in the present 

research.

Contrary to what was predicted, no significant relationship emerged between 

organization-based self-esteem and perceived alternatives commitment.  Overall, these findings 

confirm earlier research on the role of organization-based self-esteem in the prediction of work 

outcomes (Pierce et al., 1989) and extend the exploration of the relationship of this construct with 

perceived alternatives commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, and turnover intent.

The present research strongly supports the value of a situation or context-specific 

measure of self-esteem in the prediction of work outcomes.  Supplementary analyses were

performed in the present research to explore the predictive power of a context-consistent 

measure of self-esteem (OBSE) above that of a context-neutral measure (global self-esteem) in 

the prediction of organizational attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, 

affective commitment).

Organization-based self-esteem added significantly to the proportion of variance 

accounted for in job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, perceived sacrifice commitment, 

affective commitment, and turnover intent by global self-esteem (see Table 5).  Further, OBSE 

was significantly more strongly correlated with job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, 

affective commitment, and perceived sacrifice commitment than was global self-esteem.  The 

correlations between global self-esteem and organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, and 

perceived sacrifice commitment were not even significance at p < .05.  On the other hand, 

organization-based self-esteem was not significantly correlated with perceived alternatives 

commitment.  Global self-esteem was significantly and negatively correlated with the latter.

McGee and Ford (1987) suggested that commitment to an organization due to lack of 

perceived alternatives reflected an entirely different form of “commitment” than either the 

affective or the side-bet view (reflected in perceived sacrifice commitment).  It is this distinction 

that may explain the absence of a significant relationship between organization-based self-esteem 

and perceived alternatives commitment.  Lack of perceived alternatives reflects a number of 

conditions (e.g., lack of necessary skills, job market conditions), none of which are directly tied to 

decisions made by the employing organization.  Instead, they reflect influences primarily outside 

of the organizational setting.  These general factors are more tied to total life events than they 

are to specific organizational policies.  Therefore, it follows that global self-esteem would be 

more associated with perceived alternatives commitment than would OBSE since, according to 

Tharenou (1979), measures of global self-esteem are most appropriate when studying individuals 

in the context of total fife eveDK

A significant global self-esteem by OBSE interaction was found on the measure of 

affective commitment (see Figure 1).  The nature of the interaction indicates that the relationship

between affective commitment and OBSE is stronger for the high global self-esteem group than it 

is for the other global self-esteem groups.  High global self-esteem individuals apparently attend 

more closely to OBSE when judging their affective commitment than do low global self-esteem 

individuals.  This finding is important from an organizational point of view and is interpreted as 

follows.  If an employee feels valued by the organization (high OBSE), they tend to be more 

committed to the organization, overall, as opposed to their counterparts who have low OBSE. 

Further, global self-esteem makes no difference to the affective commitment of individuals who 

feel valued by their organization.

Conversely, overall affective commitment will be lower if an employee feels that the 

company does not value him or her.  In the case of low OBSE, the employee’s level of 

commitment will be more dependent on his or her own global self-esteem (see Figure 1).  When 

OBSE is low, individuals with higher global self-esteem are less committed to their organization 

than are individuals low in global self-esteem.  This can be explained in terms of cognitive 

discrepancy.  High global self-esteem individuals are experiencing a discrepancy between their 

overall feelings of self worth and their perceptions that the organization does not share this sense 

of worth.  Employees may react to this discrepancy through lack of organizational commitment. 

Individuals whose global self-esteem is congruent with their organization-based perceptions 

experience less of a discrepancy and, hence, tend to be more committed than their counterparts 

with higher levels of global self-esteem.

Ape and Work Attitudes

Rhodes (1983) summarized the literature involving age and a number of organizational 

variables.  She found evidence for a significant positive relationship between age and both overall 

job satisfaction and attitudinal commitment.  In the present research, age was hypothesized to be 

positively related to a number of work-related attitudes and personality characteristics, including 

job and organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, 

organization-based self-esteem, and global self-esteem.

52

A MANOVA testing relationships between age and seven work attitude variables was 

statistically significant.  Global self-esteem, organizational satisfaction, and perceived alternatives 

commitment were the only variables to reach significance on the basis of univariate F-tests. 

Contrary to the present hypothesis and Rhodes’ (1983) findings, the relationship between age and 

organizational satisfaction was negative in direction (r =  -.20;p<.05).  However, these results 

may reflect a confounding of age with tenure, as will be discussed shortly.

Also contrary to previous findings and to the present hypotheses, no significant 

relationship was found between age and either job satisfaction, affective commitment, perceived 

sacrifice commitment, or organization-based self-esteem.  A correlational analysis of these same 

relationships yields consistent results (see Appendix C).  Appendix C lists the correlations 

between demographic variables (e.g., age, tenure) and study scales.

In order to make a more informed interpretation of these findings, steps were taken to 

control for tenure, a variable which often covariates with age.  Kacmar and Ferris (1989) studied 

the age-job satisfaction relationship while controlling for the effects of several types of tenure.

The authors noted the failure of many past researchers to control for tenure or to control for 

only one type, with no reason as to why that type was chosen.

A MANCOVA was performed in the present research to uncover the existence of any 

relationship between age and the study variables after the effects of job and organizational tenure 

were controlled.  After the effects of tenure were partialled out, age was no longer significantly 

related to organizational satisfaction or perceived alternatives commitment.  Organizational 

satisfaction was, however, significantly and negatively correlated with both job and organizational 

tenure (r =  -.21, -.42; p < .05,  .01, respectively).  Perceived alternatives commitment was 

significantly and positively related to organizational tenure (/•  =  .23;p<.05).  Only global 

self-esteem remained significantly related to age after accounting for the influence of the 

covariates.  Theoretically, job and organizational tenure should have a minimal impact on the 

relationship between age and global self-esteem since global self-esteem is not tied directly to the 

organizational setting.

53

The findings that age, and subsequently tenure, were negatively associated with 

organizational satisfaction are counter to what was hypothesized.  The generalizability of these 

results are questionable in light of the fact that marginal job category differences emerged in 

organizational satisfaction.  The present sample consisted of a combination of managerial and 

clerical employees and the managerial subsample was marginally more satisfied with the 

organization than was the clerical subsample.

Contrary to my prediction, perceived sacrifice commitment was not significantly 

associated with age.  However, it was significantly and positively correlated with both job and 

organizational tenure (r =  35 and .28;p<.01, respectively).  As was the case with organizational 

satisfaction and perceived alternatives commitment, tenure and not age is the variable of interest 

in understanding perceived sacrifice commitment.  Conceptually, length of time at a job or as a 

member of an organization may be more directly tied to the accumulation of side bets and, thus, 

perceived sacrifice commitment than is age.  Results of the present research illustrate that tenure 

may be a more useful explanatory variable in the prediction of organizational satisfaction, 

perceived sacrifice, and perceived alternatives commitment than is age, per se.

Tenure has been recognized as an important predictor of a variety of work outcomes 

including job satisfaction (e.g., Kacmar & Ferris, 1989; White & Spector, 1987), affective 

commitment (e.g., Meyer & Allen, 1984), and occupational mobility (e.g., Landau & Hammer, 

1986; Veiga, 1983).  It may be a more important predictor of work-related attitudes than is age, 

as is evidenced by the present research results.  The importance of age in predicting important 

attitudes should not be discounted, however.  Even after controlling for tenure, age was 

significantly associated with global self-esteem.  Future research should address the value of age 

as a predictor in a variety of circumstances.  Perhaps age is more strongly related to variables 

outside of the organizational context.

Regardless of the importance of tenure to the understanding of the age-work attitude 

relationship, the present research did not support the previously held links between age and 

either job satisfaction or affective commitment or the hypothesized relationships between age and

54

either OBSE or perceived sacrifice commitment.  Several plausible explanations for the lack of 

significant relationships exist.  For instance, range restriction on the OBSE variable may have 

impacted upon the power needed to detect the existence of a significant relationship.  Overall, all 

of the employees sampled had high levels of OBSE.  The average OBSE of the present set of 

respondents was 4.23 out of a possible five with a standard deviation of .68.  This explanation is 

unlikely, however, since OBSE was significantly related to a number of other variables.

Further, the mean levels of OBSE by age group do show a nonsignificant tendency in 

the hypothesized direction; higher levels of OBSE occur in the oldest age group as compared 

with the younger and middle age groups.  The tendency is not significant, however.  This is not 

unexpected in light of the nonsignificant correlation between age and OBSE (r =  .18).

Finally it is possible that, unlike global self-esteem, OBSE is not significantly associated 

with age.  Bengtson et al. (1985) reviewed 17 studies that examined age differences in self-esteem 

and concluded that although the global self-esteem of older adults may be the same or higher 

than that of younger cohorts, specific competence-related dimensions (e.g., self-rated work skills, 

leisure competence)  may decline in older age groups.  Age related trends in organization-based 

self-esteem have not been comprehensively explored and may not mimic the relationships evident 

between age and the more widely researched self-esteem measures.

Contrary to predictions, neither job satisfaction nor affective commitment were 

significantly related to age in the present sample.  Further, these variables were not significantly 

correlated with either job or organizational tenure.  Although previous research and reviews 

(Rhodes, 1983) often conclude that a positive relationship exists between age and both job 

satisfaction and attitudinal organizational commitment, this finding is not unequivocal.  For 

example, Phillips, Barrett, and Rush (1978) found no relationship between age and job 

satisfaction in a sample of blue-collar employees from a large automotive plant.  They suggested 

that congruence between preferred and perceived job attributes contributed to job satisfaction 

and any association between age and job satisfaction was indirect.  In the present sample, the 

mean level of job satisfaction for each age group was between 5.35 (36-50 years)  to 5.67 (51 years

55

and over).  These values indicate that on the average ail employees, regardless of age, were 

satisfied with their jobs.

Still other researchers state that the form of the age-job satisfaction relationship 

depends upon the type of job satisfaction measured (Kacmar & Ferris,  1989).  Kacmar and Ferris 

(1989) found a U-shaped relationship between age and specific facets of job satisfaction (e.g., 

pay, promotions) and a linear relationship between age and satisfaction with work itself.  The 

authors concluded that specific facets of the job such as pay, promotions, supervisors, and 

co-workers (U-shaped relationship) measure extrinsic satisfaction while the satisfaction with work 

itself (linear form) may reflect intrinsic job satisfaction.  The job satisfaction measure utilized in 

the present research taps global satisfaction rather than satisfaction with a specific facet of the 

job.  Perhaps any relationship between age and facets of the job tapping intrinsic or extrinsic 

satisfaction is obscured when global satisfaction is the focus.

Finally, a significant curvilinear relationship was hypothesized between age and 

perceived alternatives commitment but was not found.  As was noted previously, age accounted 

for 4% of the variance in perceived alternatives commitment and the addition of the quadratic 

age term did not add to its incremental prediction.  Workers aged 51 and up were significantly 

more committed to their organization due to perceptions of few alternatives than were the 20-35 

year age group.  This finding is consistent with the occupational mobility literature which often 

uncovers a negative relationship between age and perceived ease of movement (Landau & 

Hammer, 1986).

The results of the present research are inconsistent with Meyer and Allen’s (1984) 

explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between age and continuance commitment in 

their research.  The authors’ measure of continuance commitment combined perceived sacrifice 

and perceived alternatives commitment into a single commitment value.  They speculated that 

older employees might have felt increased sacrifice due to seniority and other investments while 

younger employees perceived that fewer alternatives were available to them due to lower levels of 

work experience.  Hence, any age differences were cancelled out by combining these different

56

facets of commitment into one scale.  Contrary to Meyer and Allen’s (1984) speculation, no 

significant age differences in perceived sacrifice commitment emerged in the present research. 

Further, age differences in perceived alternatives commitment were evident but not in the 

direction hypothesized by Meyer and Allen (1984).  Instead, the present research found that older 

workers were more committed to their employing organization because they perceived that fewer 

alternatives were available to them than did their counterparts aged 20-35.  The reason behind 

these perceptions was not explored in the present research but would be an interesting focus for 

future research.

Future research might also address the stability of the relationship between self-esteem 

and work attitudes over time.  The cross-sectional nature of the present research precludes any 

such exploration.  Another limitation of the present research is the degree to which obtained 

results can be generalized to different types of organizations and jobs.  The present sample is 

small (n  =  102) and represents only two work categories (managerial and clerical).  Take, as an 

example, the results with regard to perceived alternatives commitment and age.  Perceived 

alternatives commitment is a negative response to the organizational situation.  Individuals are 

committed because they perceive no other choice.  In the present sample, those employees aged 

51 and up did perceive fewer employment alternatives than did their younger counterparts.  It 

would be interesting to explore this type of commitment in a variety of organizations and with a 

variety of jobs.  The present sample was employed in an organization whose success is highly 

dependent on market and investment forces.  Perhaps a different pattern of perceived alternatives 

commitment would emerge in an older, established company or in a job where the career ladder 

and movement opportunities is either very narrow or wide.  One must take into account a variety 

of influences, such as the history of the organization, economic constraints, and changes and/or 

attitudes of management when exploring an individual’s perceptions of work alternatives.  For 

example, employees of all ages who are locked into an organization because of generous 

retirement plans or strong unions might have higher levels of perceived alternatives commitment 

than those employees whose circumstances are less regulated.

57

Another limitation of the present research is the confounding of gender with job 

category in the present sample.  A chi-square analysis exploring gender differences in job 

category was significant atpc.OOl.  In the present sample, females are more likely to be clerical 

employees and males are more likely to be managerial staff members.  This confound must be 

taken into account when interpreting research results.  For instance, the marginal job category 

differences in organizational satisfaction (managers were more satisfied than clerical staff) may 

actually reflect gender differences.  The correlation between gender and organizational 

satisfaction was -39 (p < .001) indicating that males were more highly satisfied than were females.

It is evident from the findings of the present research that explorations of organizational 

commitment should focus on both the perceived sacrifice and perceived alternatives prongs of 

continuance commitment as well as on affective commitment as these facets of commitment are 

often differentially related to relevant organizational and demographic variables.

However, much of the previous research explored either affective or behavioral 

commitment.  Meyer et al. (1989) highlighted the importance of measuring both types of 

commitment.  They noted that the value of commitment to the organization depends upon the 

nature of the commitment and that the nature of commitment has implications for policies which 

are implemented to increase commitment.  Employees with high levels of affective commitment 

will remain with the organization because they choose to while those with high continuance 

commitment remain out of necessity.  Meyer et al. (1989) also found that commitment reflecting 

identification with and involvement in the organization was significantly and positively related to a 

number of performance dimensions, including promotability, composite performance, and overall 

performance.

Although researchers have recognized that continuance commitment is two-pronged 

(McGee & Ford, 1987; Meyer & Allen,  1987; Meyer et al.,  1989), these researchers combine the 

items to form a composite measure of the construct.  This obscures the distinct relationship that 

each of these prongs of continuance commitment share with other work attitudes.  Results of the 

present research indicate that a different set of organizational and demographic correlates is

58

associated with both perceived sacrifice commitment and perceived alternatives commitment. 

Perceived sacrifice commitment is significantly and positively related to OBSE and is significantly 

and negatively related to turnover intent.  Perceived alternatives commitment is unrelated to 

OBSE and turnover intent but significantly and negatively related with global self-esteem and 

affective commitment.

It is evident from the present research that perceived alternatives commitment may not 

be directly tied to organizational decisions.  As was mentioned previously, this type of 

commitment reflects influences primarily outside of the organizational setting, such as job market 

conditions or lack of necessary skills.  The nature of this perceived alternatives commitment 

might explain its lack of a significant relationship with work outcomes such as job satisfaction, 

organizational satisfaction, and OBSE.

The present research findings support the renewed interest in personality variables in 

industrial organizational psychology recognized by Weiss and Adler (1984).  The often low and 

occasional nonsignificant correlations between measures of self-esteem and work outcomes 

reported by Tharenou (1979) may reflect the use of scales with low levels of reliability and 

validity.  In his review of 55 studies tapping the organizational correlates of self-esteem, only six 

utilized measures of self-esteem which were considered sufficiently reliable or valid (Tharenou, 

1979).  Further, researchers often used self-esteem instruments that were inappropriate to the 

context of the research.  The measure of organization-based self-esteem adopted in the present 

research addressed the major problems of past research.  Organization-based self-esteem is a 

valid, reliable, and context-consistent alternative to the global and task-specific measures of 

self-esteem previously adopted in organizational settings.  Pierce et al. (1989) validated this scale 

in a series of studies and the present research further supports its efficacy in the prediction of 

work-related attitudes.

Organization-based self-esteem is a new measure which adds a degree of sensitivity to 

the understanding of organizational attitudes.  Employees who perceive that they are valuable as 

organizational members are also more satisfied with their jobs and organizations, are committed

to the organization both affectively and in terms of perceived sacrifice, and are less likely to 

intend to turnover.  This finding brings to light the importance of understanding an employee’s 

perceptions and interpretations of organizational policies, procedures, and behaviors.

In light of the significant relationship between OBSE and a number of important work 

attitudes, researchers should address the issue of self-esteem enhancement.  Organization-based 

self-esteem is significantly and positively related to job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, 

affective commitment, perceived sacrifice commitment, and significantly and negatively related to 

turnover intent.  A logical step for employers whose employees experience low organization-based 

self-esteem might be the adoption of measures designed to enhance self-esteem.  This issue might 

be first addressed by exploring the antecedents of OBSE through longitudinal analyses.  A 

number of correlates to self-esteem have been identified, including intrinsic (e.g., job variety, job 

complexity) and extrinsic job characteristics (e.g., pay, job level)  (Tharenou, 1979; Tharenou & 

Harker,  1982).  Pierce et al. (1989)  identified managerial respect, job complexity, and mechanistic 

design as important to the development of OBSE, although only the existence of a mechanistic 

organizational design was tested longitudinally.

CHAPTER VI 

SUMMARY

The present research explored the role of organization-based self-esteem in the 

prediction of work-related attitudes.  In the past, positive relationships have been found between 

intrinsic job characteristics (e.g., job complexity) and self-esteem and, to a lesser magnitude, 

between extrinsic job characteristics (e.g., pay) and self-esteem (Brockner,  1988; Tharenou,  1979; 

Thareaou & Harker, 1982).  Self-esteem has also been significantly correlated with a variety of 

work outcomes including job satisfaction (Pierce et al., 1989; Tharenou,  1979), organizational 

satisfaction, and affective commitment (Pierce et al.,  1989).  The present research addressed 

some inconsistencies of past research by utilizing a reliable, valid, organizationally-based measure 

of self-esteem for predicting organizational outcomes.  Organization-based self-esteem was 

significantly related to a variety of work outcomes in the present research.  As was hypothesized, 

an employee’s OBSE was significantly and positively related to job satisfaction, organizational 

satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived sacrifice commitment.  Organization-based 

self-esteem was unrelated to perceived alternatives commitment.

The efficacy of OBSE over global self-esteem in the prediction of work outcomes was 

also illustrated.  The addition of OBSE to regression equations which included global self-esteem 

as a predictor of work outcomes resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of variance 

accounted for in job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, affective commitment, perceived 

sacrifice commitment, and turnover intent.  Further, OBSE was significantly more highly 

correlated with these variables than was global self-esteem.  Along with this, organizational 

satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived sacrifice commitment were not even 

significantly correlated with global self-esteem.  It is evident, then, that an employee’s OBSE

offers insight into his or her satisfaction with job and employing organization along with his or 

her affective and perceived alternatives commitment.  In turn, these outcome variables have been 

linked either directly or indirectly to turnover (Mowday et al., 1982).

Unexpectedly, a significant global self-esteem by OBSE interaction was found with 

affective commitment.  In the present sample of employees, the relationship between affective 

commitment and OBSE is stronger for individuals in the high global self-esteem group than it is 

for both the moderate and low self-esteem groups.  Consistent with this trend, the relationship 

between affective commitment and OBSE is stronger for the moderate global self-esteem group 

than it is for the low global self-esteem group.

The present research explored different facets of commitment with the use of McGee 

and Fords’ (1987) modification of Meyer and Aliens’ (1984) affective and two-prong continuance 

commitment indicators.  Items were added to the continuance commitment scales in the present 

study in an attempt to increase the reliability of the three-item indicators.  The addition of items 

increased the reliability of the perceived sacrifice commitment subscale but not the perceived 

alternatives subscale.  Thus, the modified perceived sacrifice and original perceived alternatives 

commitment scales were the basis for all analyses.

It is evident from the present research results that a different set of organizational and 

demographic correlates is associated with perceived sacrifice commitment, perceived alternatives 

commitment, and affective commitment.  Perceived sacrifice commitment is significantly and 

positively related to OBSE and is significantly and negatively related to turnover intent.

Perceived alternatives commitment is unrelated to OBSE and turnover intent but significantly and 

negatively related to global self-esteem and affective commitment.  Further, affective commitment 

is significantly and positively correlated with OBSE, job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction 

and significantly and negatively correlated with perceived alternatives commitment and turnover 

intent.  Finally, the relationship between age and perceived alternatives commitment was not 

curvilinear as was hypothesized.

The present research also explored age-related differences in work outcomes.  It was 

hypothesized that age would show a significant and positive relationship with affective 

commitment, job satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, and perceived sacrifice commitment. 

Many of these relationships did not emerge, however.  Initially, age was significantly and 

positively related to organizational satisfaction, perceived alternatives commitment, and global 

self-esteem.  After controlling for job and organizational tenure, two variables which often covary 

with age, global self-esteem was the only variable significantly associated with age.  Individuals 

aged SI and up had significantly higher global self-esteem than did individuals in either the 20-35 

or 36-50 year old age groups.  Employees aged 20-35 and 36-50 years did not differ significantly 

from each other in their levels of global self-esteem.
