Abstract
Purpose – Although the negative consequences of conﬂict in work settings have long been
recognized, it is only in recent years that researchers have examined its positive effects, and the
majority of this research has been conducted at the group level. This paper aims to examine the
positive effects of conﬂict on individual work behaviors by differentiating between task and
relationship conﬂicts, as well as the moderating inﬂuence of two contextual variables.
Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted with 166 pairs of supervisors and
subordinates in China.
Findings – Results supported the hypotheses that task conﬂict is positively related to both
innovative behaviors and knowledge sharing behaviors while relationship conﬂict is negatively
related to both individual-directed organizational citizenship and knowledge sharing behaviors.
Support for innovation and reward system for relationship-building functioned as contextual factors
to moderate the relationships between task and relationship conﬂicts and the workplace behaviors
studied.
Originality/value – The hypotheses proposed and most of the ﬁndings are original.

Most early research on conﬂict focused primarily on the negative effects of conﬂict
such as reduced productivity and lowered job satisfaction (e.g. Brown, 1983; Hackman
and Morris, 1975), and it is only recently that researchers have started to examine its
positive effects (e.g. Leung, 1997; Tjosvold, 1991). The focus of this emerging area has
been on how the nature of conﬂict shapes conﬂict outcomes, with task conﬂict leading
to positive outcomes and relationship conﬂict leading to negative ones. It has been
suggested, however, that this research needs to be broadened to include the inﬂuence of
the organizational context (De Dreu, 2008; Jehn, 1995). The present study takes both of
these two concerns into consideration by examining the inﬂuence of task and
