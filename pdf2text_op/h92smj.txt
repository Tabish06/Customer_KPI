 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE
 STRATEGIC LOCUS OF CONTROL SCALE

 GERARD P. HODGKINSON
 Sheffield University Management School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K.

 Previous studies investigating the role of locus of control beliefs in relation to strategy-
 making behavior, organizational structure, performance and environment have employed
 the well known Rotter (1966) I-E scale. Unfortunately, however, this scale is beset by a
 number of problems which render it unsuitable for studies of business organizations, namely,
 that the items comprising the scale lack context-specificity and its well known tendency to
 correlate with measures of social desirability response set. This paper describes the
 development of a new measure designed to overcome these limitations. The measure,
 intended specifically for investigating locus of control beliefs in relation to issues of strategic
 management, assesses the extent to which respondents regard their own and other
 organizations' strategic issues to be resolved by the systematic application of strategic
 management techniques (e.g. environmental analysis, strategic planning, etc) or through
 external environmental forces (e.g. the actions of powerful competitors, unforeseen chance
 events, etc) largely beyond the control of organizations. Data is presented from two samples
 which indicate that the measure demonstrates acceptable reliability and construct validity.

 INTRODUCTION

 Within recent years a number of strategic
 management researchers and organization theo-
 rists have devoted considerable attention to the
 role of managerial locus of control beliefs in the
 formulation of business strategy and organi-
 zational structure-environment relationships
 (Miller et al., 1982; Miller, 1983; Miller and
 Toulouse, 1986; Miller, 1987; Boone, 1988;
 Govindarajan, 1988). However, there are a
 number of problems associated with the way in
 which this construct has been operationalized in
 previous strategic management studies, to be
 described shortly. The purpose of this paper is
 to describe the development of a new locus
 of control scale designed to overcome these
 limitations.

 Key words: locus of control

 The concept of locus of control originates with
 the work of Rotter (1966) and reflects the belief
 individuals have about who controls the key
 events in their lives, themselves or various
 external factors such as other people, chance
 events, or the Government. Those people who
 perceive their lives to be controlled by their own
 actions, skills and abilities are said to be
 'internals'. Conversely, those who perceive their
 lives to be controlled by external forces, are said
 to be 'externals'.

 Previous research has shown that externally
 oriented Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are
 less likely to belong to organizations which
 engage in long-term strategic planning or seek
 information about the business environment.
 Internal CEOs, by contrast, are more likely to
 belong to firms which plan ahead (often for a
 period of several years hence), actively seek
 information about the business environment, and
 have a tendency to lead rather than follow

 competitors. Moreover, these organizations are
 more likely to inhabit dynamic and hostile
 environments, to consult specialist technical
 staff in decision making and have a relatively
 differentiated organizational structure, than those
 organizations led by executives with a relatively
 external locus of control (for reviews of these
 findings and related studies, see Miller, 1987;
 Boone, 1988).

 In all the studies cited above, the researchers
 have employed the well known Rotter I-E scale
 (Rotter, 1966). This measure comprises some 29
 items, 23 of which are designed to assess the
 respondents' locus of control beliefs, the others
 being 'filler' items. Respondents are required to
 complete the questionnaire by choosing from a
 series of two alternatives, the statements that
 more closely reflect their own beliefs. The scale
 is arranged such that the respondent receives a
 point each time he or she selects a statement
 which is designed to reflect external locus of
 control beliefs. The scale is scored by simply
 totalling the number of externally worded items
 so endorsed. Thus the higher the score, the more
 external the respondent, and vice versa.

 Unfortunately, however, this measure is beset
 by a number of limitations which, in the present
 author's view, render it unsuitable for the study
 of strategic management problems (see also
 Spector, 1982; Boone, 1988). Firstly, as Phares
 (1976) notes, the I-E scale is only a rough
 measure of the construct and researchers should
 develop their own context-specific scales (c.f.
 Adler and Weiss, 1988:315). In line with this
 recommendation a number of domain-specific
 scales have been devised by researchers in recent
 years, in order to investigate generalized control
 beliefs in contexts as varied as health (e.g. Lau
 and Ware, 1981; Wood and Letak, 1982), politics
 (Davis, 1983), economics (Furnham, 1986) and
 work settings (Spector, 1988).

 A second limitation of Rotter's general measure
 concerns its tendency to correlate with social
 desirability response set (Spector, 1982). As
 Boone (1988) observes, unfortunately, strategy
 researchers investigating the role of locus of
 control beliefs have not generally controlled for
 social desirability response set in their studies
 and so it is possible that some, or all, of the
 relationships previously observed between locus
 of control, strategy-making, structure and
 environment, are a function of respondents

 attempting to present themselves in a socially
 desirable manner. The objective of the present
 study, therefore, was to develop an instrument
 that was domain-specific and not prone to
 correlate with social desirability.

 METHOD

 Participants

 Two separate groups of participants were
 employed in order to develop and validate the
 Strategic Locus of Control Scale. Both groups
 participated in the research on an unpaid
 voluntary basis.

 Sample 1 comprised a total of 100 personnel,
 mainly owner-managers of small businesses from
 Sheffield, England, of whom 94 returned usable
 data. Sample 2 comprised a group of 208 real
 estate brokers/estate agents (various grades) from
 58 organizations dispersed throughout the North-
 East Midlands area of the UK. This sample
 completed a number of measures, in addition to
 the measures reported here, as part of a wider
 investigation, beyond the scope of the present
 paper.

 Research instruments

 Strategic locus of control

 Strategic Locus of Control was assessed via the
 16-item scale shown in the Appendix. This scale
 was created from an initial item pool comprising
 a total of 36 questions derived from a conceptual
 analysis of the locus of control construct as it
 relates to the strategic management field.

 The questions comprising the initial item pool
 were balanced in terms of the extent to which
 they were intended to reflect locus of control
 beliefs about the strategic management of organi-
 zations in general and the strategic management
 of the respondents' own particular firms. The
 rationale for this design of the item pool, follows
 directly from an analysis of Rotter's (1966)
 original conception of the construct.

 The I-E Scale contains several items of a
 personal nature (e.g. 'I have often found that
 what is going to happen will happen'; 'When I
 make plans, I am almost certain that I can make
 them work.') Other items within the scale,
 however, are of a more general nature (e.g.

 'Most students don't realize the extent to which
 their grades are influenced by accidental hap-
 penings'; 'In the long run the people are
 responsible for bad government on a national as
 well as on a local level.')

 Given that the aim was to develop a domain-
 specific scale reflecting, as closely as possible,
 the underlying rationale of the original concept
 of locus of control as conceived by Rotter, it was
 deemed appropriate to develop a set of items
 which were balanced, in terms of their content,
 between statements relating to Strategic Locus
 of Control beliefs about organizations in general
 and belief statements pertaining to the respon-
 dents' own particular organization. The items
 were also balanced with respect to the number
 of internally and externally worded items.
 Respondents were required to indicate the extent
 to which they agree with statements on a five-
 point Likert Scale ranging from 1 ('strongly
 disagree'), through 3 ('unsure') to 5 ('strongly
 agree'). Internally worded items were reverse-
 scored in order to render the scoring system
 compatible with the Rotter I-E and Work Locus
 of Control scales.

 Four criteria were employed in order to select
 items for the final scale, namely, acceptable item-
 total correlations, lack of correlation with social
 desirability, and that the scale should be balanced
 with respect to the number of general and specific
 items on the one hand, and, on the other,
 internally and externally worded items, thus
 following the rationale adopted in the design of
 the initial item pool, as discussed above. As
 noted previously, a 16-item scale emerged from
 the application of these criteria.

 General I-E and work locus of control

 General and Work Locus of Control were
 assessed using the Rotter I-E scale (Rotter, 1966)
 and Spector's (1988) Work Locus of Control
 scales, respectively. These measures were incor-
 porated in the study in order to assess the
 convergent validity of the Strategic Locus of
 Control Scale. It was predicted that the Strategic,
 Work and Rotter I-E locus of control scales
 would all be positively intercorrelated with one
 another, but that the Strategic Locus of Control
 Scale would be more strongly related to the
 Work Locus of Control Scale than the Rotter.

 Research Notes and Communications 313

 Social desirability

 Social desirability was assessed using the Crowne
 and Marlowe (1964) social desirability scale.
 Following Spector's work (Spector, 1982, 1988),
 it was predicted that the Marlowe-Crowne social
 desirability scale would correlate negatively with
 the Rotter I-E scale, but not with the Work
 Locus of Control Scale.

 Strategy making, organizational structure and
 environment

 Perceptions of various aspects of strategy making,
 organizational structure and environment were
 assessed using slightly modified versions of the
 scales initially devised and employed by Miller
 and his associates in their studies of chief
 executive locus of control (Miller et al., 1982).
 These measures were selected for the present
 exercise because they are known to correlate
 negatively with the Rotter I-E scale. Following
 Miller's work, it was predicted that the various
 strategy making, structure and environment
 measures would all correlate negatively with the
 Strategic Locus of Control Scale.

 Environmental scanning

 Previous studies by Miller and his associates have
 demonstrated that organizations with internal
 CEOs tend to scan the environment more
 frequently than organizations with external
 CEOs. However, in these studies environmental
 scanning has been operationalized at the organi-
 zational level. It is not clear from previous
 research how locus of control beliefs relate to
 individual scanning strategies. From the work
 reviewed earlier, we would expect to find
 that strategic internals generally seek more
 information on a more frequent basis than their
 external counterparts in an effort to retain control
 of their environment. On the other hand, it is
 also likely that the type of information internals
 seek is of a qualitatively different nature. Given
 our earlier observations, we would expect to find
 that internals on balance more actively seek
 information relating to opportunities rather than
 threats and vice versa (cf. Dutton, Walton and
 Abrahamson, 1989).

 The extent to which the individual scans the

 environment for pertinent information (frequency)

 was assessed via a 13-item Likert scale devised
 by the present author. Respondents are required
 to indicate the extent to which they seek
 information through a variety of sources, includ-
 ing relevant industry reports, personal contacts,
 clients and the like. A second scale comprising
 four bipolar items, was designed to assess
 the extent to which the respondent scans the
 environment primarily in order to learn of threats
 which they must defend their business against
 (low score), vs. opportunistic scanning (high
 score), i.e. scanning with a view to spotting new
 business opportunities. It was predicted that both
 these scales would correlate negatively with the
 Strategic Locus of Control Scale.

 presented was randomized so as to minimize the
 possibility of order effects.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

 Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results relating to
 samples 1 and 2, respectively. Corrected item-
 total correlations for the Strategic Locus of
 Control Scale arising from both samples are
 shown in the Appendix.

 All the scales were generally found to have good
 reliabilities, with coefficient alphas (Cronbach,
 1951) ranging between 0.70 and 0.88. One notable
 exception was the technocratization scale, which
 had a coefficient alpha of 0.53. However, in view
 of the relatively small number of items forming
 this scale, it was deemed to be sufficiently reliable
 for use in the study.

 Organizational performance

 Five aspects of organizational performance
 (wealth, market position, adaptability to changing
 circumstances, working climate and future pros-
 pects for the immediate year ahead) were assessed
 using slightly modified versions of the scales
 developed by Nicholson (1991). Multiple items
 with a Likert type response format were devised
 in order to assess respondents' perceptions of
 the relative performance of the part of their
 organization for which they have responsibility,
 or belong to, (section, branch or entire company)
 in relation to its main external competitor(s). On
 the basis of the underlying theory of locus of
 control, outlined earlier, it was predicted that
 significant negative correlations would emerge
 between the various performance indicators and
 the Strategic Locus of Control Scale.

 Procedure

 Sample 1 completed the entire 36-item pool of
 Strategic Locus of Control items. In addition
 they also completed the original Rotter (1966)
 I-E scale and Spector's (1988) Work Locus of
 Control Scale, described above, together with
 the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale
 (Crowne and Marlowe, 1964). Sample 2 com-
 pleted the final 16-item version of the Strategic
 Locus of Control Scale together with the various
 strategy making, organizational structure,
 environment, performance and environmental
 scanning scales outlined above. In each case, the
 order in which the various measures were

 The data indicate that the Strategic Locus of
 Control scale demonstrates acceptable convergent
 validity with respect to the other measures used
 in the study. As expected, the Strategic Locus
 of Control Scale shows significant positive corre-
 lations with the Rotter and Work Locus of
 Control scales, and (with one exception) signifi-
 cant negative correlations with the various strat-
 egy, structure, scanning and performance scales.
 Moreover, there is a very low and nonsignificant
 correlation between the Strategic Locus of
 Control Scale and the Marlowe-Crowne Social
 Desirability Scale. The Rotter I-E Scale, by
 contrast, correlated significantly with the
 Marlowe-Crowne scale (r = -0.26, d.f. = 89,
 p < 0.01), thus suggesting that the previous
 studies which have investigated locus of control
 and strategy as outlined earlier, may be con-
 founded by lack of control for social desirability.
 Given the overall pattern of these results it would
 appear that the Strategic Locus of Control Scale
 is sufficiently reliable and valid, for use in future
 strategic management studies.

 CONCLUSIONS

 Previous strategic management studies investigat-
 ing locus of control beliefs have tended to use
 Rotter's (1966) I-E scale. However, this measure
 suffers from a number of limitations which
 render it unsuitable for research in strategic
 management, namely, its lack of context-speci-

 ficity and its tendency to correlate with social
 desirability. This paper has reported the develop-
 ment of an alternative measure of locus of
 control, a measure designed specifically for use
 in strategic management studies. The Strategic
 Locus of Control Scale, is relatively context-
 specific and, unlike the Rotter I-E scale, does
 not correlate with social desirability. The measure
 has been demonstrated to be both reliable and
 valid, in terms of its relationship to other
 theoretically meaningful constructs.
