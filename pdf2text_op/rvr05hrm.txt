This study empirically examines the relationship between the perceived em-
ployee involvement (EI) climate and organizational effectiveness. Using a
sample of insurance companies, results indicate that organizations with high
levels of perceived EI climate lead to organizational effectiveness as meas-
ured through financial performance, turnover rate, and workforce morale.

R esearchers  have  argued  that  today’s

organizations  operate  in  hypercom-
petitive  markets  characterized  by
continuous  technological  change,
shortened  product  life-cycles,  and
competitors  who  compete  in  aggressive
ways  (D’Aveni,  1998;  Volberda,  1996).  Al-
though  the  exact  processes  that  generate
profitability  in  such  environments  remain
unclear,  there  is  some  agreement  that  suc-
cessful  organizations  are  flexible  and  re-
sponsive and react quickly to and anticipate
changes  in  the  competitive  landscape
(Miles, Snow, Matthews, & Coleman, 1997;
Volberda,  1996).  Taking  this  argument  a
step  further,  some  authors  (e.g.,  Huselid,
1995;  Lawler,  1996)  specifically  argue  that
employee  involvement  (EI)  is  one  way  in

which organizations can achieve the respon-
siveness needed in a hypercompetitve world. 
Lawler  and  his  colleagues,  for  example,
suggest that EI taps into employees’ capabil-
ities  in  a  way  that  traditional,  top-down
management  cannot  (Lawler,  1996;  Lawler,
Mohrman, & Ledford, 1995). By helping or-
ganizations  to  actively  develop  and  utilize
their human resources, EI should enable or-
ganizations  to  produce  high-quality  prod-
ucts/services, increase the speed of work op-
erations  and  innovation,  and  improve
employee performance, motivation, and at-
titudes.  Empirical  research  indicates  that
successful employee involvement efforts can
substantially  impact  organizational  finan-
cial  productivity  (e.g.,  Huselid,  1995;  Os-
troff, 1995).

The purpose of the

present article is to

empirically examine

the relationship of a

perceived EI climate

to organizational

effectiveness. 

To  date,  most  existing  research  examin-
ing  the  link  between  EI  and  desirable  out-
comes  has  focused  specifically  on  involve-
ment-related organizational practices such as
quality  circles  and  suggestion  systems.  Re-
searchers have recently argued, however, that
an  exclusive  focus  on  practices  is  of  limited
value  to  researchers  and  practitioners  inter-
ested  in  understanding  and  successfully  im-
plementing EI. As Bowen and Ostroff (2004)
point out, it is unlikely that there is a single
most  appropriate  set  of  practices  for  an  ob-
jective such as EI. Further, there is often a dis-
connect between an intended pro-
gram  of  involvement  and  how
that  program  actually  is  imple-
mented 
(Glew,  O’Leary-Kelly,
Griffin,  &  Van  Fleet,  1995;  Truss,
2001).  Whereas  examining  the
presence  or  absence  of  involve-
ment practices may provide a rea-
sonably accurate picture of an in-
tended  involvement  program,  it
may  not  accurately  represent  the
extent to which employees really
are  involved.  Related  to  this  last
issue, practice-oriented EI research
has been criticized for relying on
single respondents to describe organizations’
EI  efforts  (Gerhart,  Wright,  McMahan,  &
Snell, 2000; Purcell, 1999). Not only are sin-
gle  respondents  unlikely  to  capture  impor-
tant process issues (Purcell, 1999), but there is
also concern that this approach may result in
both over- and underestimates of EI’s effects
on performance (Gerhart et al., 2000).

In response to these concerns, there has
been a call to consider the role of organiza-
tional  climate  in  understanding  how  EI
might be associated with organization-level
employee  and  performance  outcomes
(Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Organizational cli-
mates  are  shared  perceptions  among  em-
ployees  about  their  organizational  context
(such  as  might  be  defined  by  the  organiza-
tion’s practices and policies), and they serve
to  mediate  the  relationship  between  the
context  itself  and  responses  to  the  context
such as behaviors or affect (Schneider & Re-
ichers, 1983). In other words, the climate lit-
erature  suggests  that  an  organization’s  in-

tention to use a program of EI to stimulate
effectiveness gains and the presence of prac-
tices associated with EI will be meaningless
unless  employees  behave  in  ways  that  are
supportive  of  EI.  Citing  Argyris  (1964)  and
Likert (1961), Bowen and Ostroff (2004; Os-
troff & Bowen, 2000) argue that, when em-
ployees perceive positive organizational cli-
mates,  they  will  be  more  satisfied  and
committed  to  the  organization  and  more
willing to work toward its goals. They go on
to  suggest  that  the  strongest  climates  are
those in which employees within the organ-
ization have consistent expectancies regard-
ing appropriate response patterns, that pro-
vide  incentives  for  performance  of  the
response patterns, and instill the skills nec-
essary  for  the  appropriate  execution  of  the
response patterns (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004).
To  the  extent  that  an  organization  has  a
strong  climate  for  EI,  employees  should  be
more  likely  to  demonstrate  the  patterns  of
behavior  suggested  by  EI  (e.g.,  engaging  in
decision-making  activities),  and  EI’s  desir-
able organization-level outcomes should be
more likely to materialize.

The  purpose  of  the  present  article  is  to
empirically examine the relationship of a per-
ceived EI climate to organizational effective-
ness.  Based  on  the  logic  that  organizational
climates tell employees “the kinds of behav-
iors that management expects, supports, and
rewards” (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004, p. 205) and
that  climates  motivate  employees  to  engage
in those behaviors, we suggest that a climate
in  which  employees  perceive  they  are  in-
volved  will  be  positively  associated  with  or-
ganizational  effectiveness,  as  defined  by
strong  financial  performance,  positive  em-
ployee attitudes, and low turnover rates. 

A Climate of Employee Involvement

We define a climate of involvement in terms
of  employee  perceptions  of  four  attributes
described  by  Lawler  and  his  colleagues
(Lawler, 1996; Lawler et al., 1995). These au-
thors propose that EI can be characterized by
a  work  environment  where  all employees
recognize  that  (a)  they  have  the  power  to
make  decisions  (participative  decision  mak-

ing);  (b)  information  is  shared  throughout
the  organization  (information  sharing);  (c)
they  are  provided  with  the  necessary  train-
ing  to  do  the  work  (training);  and  (d)  they
will be rewarded for using their participation
in  decision  making,  information  sharing,
and  training  to  positively  influence  organi-
zational  outcomes  (performance-based  re-
wards) (Dachler & Wilpert, 1978; Galbraith,
1973; Guzzo, Jette, & Katzell, 1985; Harrison,
1985;  Ledford  &  Lawler,  1994;  Randolph,
1995; Sashkin, 1984). 

Such  an  approach  to  involvement  fits
with  the  Bowen  and  Ostroff  (2004)  notion
that  climates  will  produce  their  intended
outcomes when employees consistently rec-
ognize  what  behaviors  are  expected,  have
the knowledge and skills necessary to appro-
priately exhibit the expected behaviors, and
are rewarded for exhibiting the behaviors. It
is also important to point out that involve-
ment  researchers  indicate  that  employees
must  perceive  high  levels  of  all  four  attrib-
utes  for  an  optimal  EI  climate  to  exist.  As
Lawler (1986) explains: 

Power  without  knowledge,  informa-
tion,  and  rewards  is  likely  to  lead  to
poor  decisions. 
Information  and
knowledge without power leads to frus-
tration because people cannot use their
expertise.  Rewards  for  organizational
performance  without  power,  knowl-
edge, and information can lead to frus-
tration and lack of motivation because
people cannot influence their rewards.
Information,  knowledge,  and  power
without rewards for organizational per-
formance are dangerous because noth-
ing will ensure that people will exercise
their power in ways that will contribute
to organizational effectiveness. (p. 42) 

In  the  sections  that  follow,  we  discuss
each of the four attributes of perceived EI cli-
mate in more detail.

Participative Decision Making

Participative  decision  making  is  the  percep-
tion  among  employees  that  they  have  con-

trol over or say in decisions that affect their
work. Much research has traditionally exam-
ined EI by narrowly operationalizing it only
as  participative  decision  making.  However,
reviews and meta-analyses considering both
the practice and perceptions of participative
decision making have concluded that, when
examined in isolation, participative decision
making does not strongly affect the perform-
ance or morale of individuals. For example,
in their meta-analysis, Wagner and Gooding
(1987;  see  also  Wagner,  Leana,  Locke,  &
Schweiger, 1997) found that participation in
decision making was not strongly
related  to  increased  individual
task performance (r = .11). While
such findings suggest that partici-
pation  by  itself  does  not  lead  to
desired  outcomes,  several  studies
indicate  that  participation  may
have a stronger effect when it co-
exists  with  organizational  attrib-
utes  that  support  it  (Dachler  &
Wilpert,  1978;  Guzzo  et  al.,
1985).  For  example,  Guzzo  et  al.
(1985)  found  that  productivity
increased  when  participative  de-
cision  making  was  accompanied
by  changes  in  the  compensation
system and job design. 

Participative

decision making is

the perception

among employees

that they have

control over or say

in decisions that

affect their work. 

Information Sharing

Information  sharing  exists  when  employees
perceive that information about the organiza-
tion,  its  goals,  and  its  plans  are  shared  with
them.  Researchers  consistently  argue  that
open  communication  is  necessary  for  em-
ployees to receive the information needed to
participate  and  make  quality  decisions  (Ar-
gyris, 1964; Hackman & Oldham, 1980; Harri-
son, 1985; Likert, 1961; McGregor, 1960; Pas-
more  &  Fagan,  1992;  Randolph,  1995).  As
noted by Randolph (1995), “without informa-
tion, people cannot act responsibly; informed
they are almost compelled to act with respon-
sibility” (p. 22). Individuals who do not per-
ceive  that  they  have  the  necessary  informa-
tion  to  make  decisions  will  also  find  such
tasks frustrating and demotivating (Hackman
& Oldham, 1980; Pasmore & Fagan, 1992).

Training

Appropriate,

ongoing training

enables employees

to develop the

knowledge required

for effective

performance.

Appropriate,  ongoing  training  enables  em-
ployees  to  develop  the  knowledge  required
for effective performance (Cohen, Ledford, &
Spreitzer,  1996;  Lawler,  1992).  Training  also
is  integrally  linked  to  participation  and  in-
formation  in  that  employees  need  to  per-
ceive  that  they  have  opportunities  to  de-
velop  the  skills  that  accompany  increased
information  processing  and  effective  deci-
sion making (Randolph, 1995). Training also
provides employees with a basis for selecting
a  particular  course  of  action  and
for  understanding  why 
that
course of action is more desirable
than  others  (Galbraith,  1973;
James, James, & Ashe, 1990; Katz
& Kahn, 1966). 

Performance-Based
Rewards

Finally,  employees  in  an  EI  cli-
mate perceive that incentives link
their  behaviors 
to  outcomes
within  the  organization.  Perfor-
mance-based rewards have a pow-
erful influence on the strength of
attitudes and the frequency of employee be-
haviors  (Porter,  Lawler,  &  Hackman,  1975).
When employees recognize that their behav-
iors  determine  their  rewards,  they  will  be
more likely to alter their behaviors to be con-
sistent  with  organizational  goals  (Wright  &
McMahan,  1992).  Thus,  employees  should
believe  that  the  reward  system  fits  with  key
organizational factors, such as goals and ob-
jectives, organizational structure, and the de-
sign of the work (Lawler, 1992). Making the
performance-reward  link  obvious  within  a
climate  of  EI  ensures  that  organizations  are
reinforcing performance standards associated
with increased use of information and knowl-
edge and with effective decision making.

Hypotheses

Our  main  research  question  is  whether  or-
ganizations  with  varying  levels  of  a  per-
ceived  EI  climate  differ  in  overall  effective-

ness. We hypothesize that high levels of an
EI  climate  are  positively  associated  with  fi-
nancial  performance  and  workforce  morale
and  negatively  associated  with  corporate
turnover.

Human Capital Perspective

Linking  a  perceived  EI  climate  to  organiza-
tional effectiveness is consistent with human
capital theory, which states that people pos-
sess  skills,  experience,  and  knowledge  that
add  economic  value  to  firms  (Cascio,  1991;
Parnes,  1984).  As  noted  by  Parnes  (1984),
worker skills and knowledge represent capi-
tal  to  an  organization  because  they  directly
enhance  productivity.  That  is,  people  add
value  to  a  firm  to  the  extent  that  they  per-
form services. 

Following  from  the  human  capital  per-
spective, it is expected that a perceived EI cli-
mate  will  significantly  affect  two  indicators
of organizational effectiveness: financial per-
formance  and  organizational  employee
turnover  rates.  If  employees  perceive  an  EI
climate,  then  they  should  also  believe  that
they can and do control their own work ac-
tivities  (Manz,  1992;  Manz  &  Sims,  1980).
Thus,  employee  perceptions  of  a  climate  of
EI suggest that they believe their knowledge,
creativity,  and  perspective  are  brought  to
bear directly on work-related issues. As such,
employees  who  perceive  a  climate  of  EI
should engage in the knowledgeable and in-
formed application of creativity and relevant
perspectives in their day-to-day work activi-
ties. When there is a collective effort to use
this  application  to  enhance  products  and
services,  organizational  financial  perform-
ance  also  should  improve  (Ichniowski,
Kochan,  Levine,  Olson,  &  Strauss,  1996;
Leana & Florkowski, 1992; Miller & Monge,
1986). 

Supporting  this  notion,  in  a  study  of  a
paper  mill,  Ichniowski  (1992)  found  that
profitability increased after the implementa-
tion of a system of practices that supported
EI  (e.g.,  employee  participation  in  decision
making,  performance-based  rewards,  and
communication). The main reason noted by
Ichniowski  (1992)  for  the  increase  in  prof-


Employee Involvement Climate and Organizational Effectiveness

475

itability was that workers were offering sug-
gestions  for  improving  operations,  some-
thing  they  had  not  done  previously.  Simi-
larly, in a study of the apparel industry, Berg,
Appelbaum,  Bailey,  and  Kalleberg  (1996)
found that allowing workers to self-regulate
resulted  in  cost  savings  and  reductions  in
turnaround times. As the practices within an
organization  are  believed  to  shape  the
process  by  which  involvement  is  enacted
(e.g.,  the  climate;  Ostroff  &  Bowen,  2000),
the  link  between  involvement-related  prac-
tices  and  outcomes  found  in  these  studies
may  indicate  that  a  perceived  climate  of  EI
existed in these organizations.

The rationale for a relationship between
a perceived climate of EI and turnover is that
employees can provide a competitive advan-
tage that is not easy to replicate (Schuler &
MacMillan,  1984;  Ulrich,  1991;  Wright  &
McMahan,  1992).  The  costs  of  replacing
human capital can be quite extensive due to
recruitment,  selection,  training  costs,  pro-
ductivity  losses,  and  the  organization’s  loss
of talent (Baysinger & Mobley, 1983; Hom &
Griffith,  1995).  Organizations  seeking  a  cli-
mate of EI have an incentive to minimize the
turnover rate in order to minimize associated
costs and to maintain a competitive advan-
tage (Arthur, 1994). Further, employees who
perceive a climate of EI are also likely to per-
ceive  that  the  organization  invests  in  its
human  capital  and  cares  about  employee
well-being.  Some  suggest  that,  when  such
perceptions  exist,  the  resulting  organiza-
tional  setting  is  likely  to  attract,  socialize,
and  retain  similar  employees  who  have  or
develop  the  skills  necessary  to  function  ef-
fectively  in  the  given  environment  (Ko-
zlowski & Doherty, 1989; Lawler, 1986, 1992;
Ostroff & Bowen, 2000). Not only are these
the  types  of  employees  that  organizations
most  want  to  keep,  but  these  organizations
may  be  the  companies  at  which  employees
most want to remain. Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 1: The greater the presence of a per-
ceived EI climate within an organization, the
higher  will  be  the  corporate  financial  per-
formance  and  the  lower  the  corporate  em-
ployee turnover rate. 

Human Relations Perspective

in 

Human  relations  theorists  argue  that  in-
volvement-oriented work environments will
affect employee attitudes (Argyris, 1964; Lik-
ert,  1961;  McGregor,  1960).  These  theorists
suggest that a perceived EI climate meaning-
fully  improves  employee  work  environ-
ments,  and  research  indicates  that  employ-
ees will respond with positive emotions to an
environment that is perceived as personally
beneficial (James et al., 1990). A perceived EI
climate  characterized  by  Lawler’s  four  attri-
butes should be positively mean-
ingful  to  employees:  the  partici-
pation 
decision-making
attribute  suggests  employees  be-
lieve  they  have  challenges,  inde-
pendence, and responsibility; the
training  and  information  attrib-
utes imply that employees believe
work  is  facilitated  because  they
have  access  to  the  necessary
knowledge and information; and
the performance-reward attribute
suggests  that  employees  believe
positive  behaviors  are  supported
and  recognized  (Hackman  &
Lawler,  1979;  James  et  al.,  1990;
Locke,  1976;  Miller  &  Monge,  1986).  The
more that each of these elements permeates
the organization to create a perceived EI cli-
mate, the greater the chance that employees
will be satisfied with their jobs and commit-
ted to their organizations (Ichniowski et al.,
1996). Thus, we propose the following:

Human relations

theorists argue that

involvement-

oriented work

environments will

affect employee

attitudes.

Hypothesis 2: The greater the presence of a per-
ceived EI climate within an organization, the
higher  will  be  the  employee  morale  as  as-
sessed  through  organizational  commitment
and job satisfaction. 

The human relations perspective suggests
that  an  EI  climate  can  indirectly  affect  the
performance of an organization by increasing
the  workforce  morale  of  its  employees
(French, Israel, & As, 1960; Miller & Monge,
1986). If work conditions can be arranged so
that  employees  satisfy  their  own  needs  by
working  toward  organizational  goals,  they


476

HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Winter 2005

will  work  hard  toward  the  achievement  of
these  goals  (McGregor,  1960).  In  short,  the
human  relations  perspective  suggests  that,
because of increased morale associated with a
perceived climate of EI, employees are more
likely to engage in behaviors that contribute
to the achievement of organizational goals as
well as positive, discretionary-type behaviors
that  go  beyond  formally  specified  duties
(Organ,  1990).  Additionally,  because  experi-
encing  a  climate  of  EI  increases  employee
commitment  and  satisfaction,  they  may  be
less likely to leave the organization (Leana &
Florkowski,  1992;  Miller  &
Monge, 1986). Thus, we propose: 

Previous research

demonstrates that

organizational size

is related to indices

of organizational

effectiveness.

Hypothesis  3:  The  greater  the  pres-
ence of a perceived EI climate within
an  organization,  the  higher  the
workforce  morale,  which  will,  in
turn,  increase  corporate  financial
performance and lower the corporate
employee  turnover  rate.  In  other
words,  workforce  morale  will  medi-
ate  the  relationship  between  a  per-
ceived climate of EI and corporate fi-
nancial  performance  and  corporate
employee turnover rate.

Method

Sample 

Ninety-two  insurance  companies  in  the
United  States  and  Canada  comprised  the
sample for this study. Data were collected as
part of a large survey administered to the em-
ployees  of  these  companies.  Ten  percent  of
the available employees at each job level were
randomly selected within each organization.
The number of respondents ranged from 14
to 123 across the 92 organizations, resulting
in a total of 4,828 respondents. The response
rate  was  approximately  90%  of  those  em-
ployees originally contacted. The characteris-
tics of the sample are presented in Table I.

Control Variables

Three controls were included in the tests of
the  hypotheses.  The  number  of  employees

and reported assets were used as indicators of
organizational 
research
demonstrates  that  organizational  size  is  re-
lated  to  indices  of  organizational  effective-
ness, such as financial performance (Arthur,
1994;  Huselid,  1995;  Snell  &  Dean,  1992)
and  employee  turnover  (Hom  &  Griffith,
1995). The heads of human resources in each
organization provided these values. 

The number of full-time, head/home of-
fice  employees  was  estimated  by  having
them  choose  from:  (a)  less  than  200;  (b)
200–499;  (c)  500–999;  (d)  1,000–4,999;  and
(e) 5,000 or more. Similarly, admitted corpo-
rate  assets  were  estimated  using  the  follow-
ing  format:  (a)  less  than  $100  million;  (b)
$100  million–$499.9  million;  (c)  $500  mil-
lion–$1.499  billion;  (d)  $1.5  billion–$4.999
billion; (e) $5 billion–$14.999 billion; and (f)
$15  billion  or  more.  Organization  type was
also  included  in  the  analysis  because  insur-
ance companies can be categorized based on
their  financial  policies  as  well  as  the  insur-
ance  codes  under  which  they  operate.  The
corporate  heads  of  human  resources  were
asked to identify their companies as mutual,
stock, or “other” type. 

Dependent Variables

Financial Performance 

Three  measures  assessed  company  financial
performance.  The  first  was  return  on  assets
(ROA),  defined  as  the  net  operating  gain
(after taxes) as a percentage of prior-year ad-
mitted  assets.  This  measure  assesses  insur-
ance  earnings  in  relation  to  the  company’s
total asset base (Best’s Insurance Reports: Life-
Health  Insurance  Edition, 1993,  p.  xix).  The
second measure was an index of how well an
insurance  company  extracts  higher  returns
on  income  relative  to  companies  with  the
same  financial  leverage  (better-performing
companies  extract  higher  returns).  This
index  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income
(total after-tax earnings from operations and
capital  gains)  by  net  premiums  written
(NPW; gross premiums written minus premi-
ums ceded). This index is referred to as gain
from NPW. The third measure was return on

forming companies. All data for the financial
performance  measures  were  obtained  di-
rectly from the Best’s Insurance Reports for the
one-year  period  following  the  collection  of
the  workforce  morale  and  the  EI  climate
measures.

Employee Turnover Rate 

The overall organizational turnover rate was
collected  from  the  head  of  the  human  re-
sources department. Human resources direc-
tors  were  asked  to  provide  the  yearly

turnover  rate  in  percentages  relative  to  the
total organizational employee population. 

Workforce Morale 

The two measures of workforce morale were
organizational commitment and job satisfac-
tion.  Commitment  was  measured  with  five
items  from  Mowday,  Steers,  and  Porter’s
(1979)  Organizational  Commitment  Question-
naire. Sample items include: “If I had to do it
all over again, I would still go to work for this
company” and “I feel a high level of loyalty
to this company.” Responses were scored on
a  four-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from
strongly  disagree (1)  to  strongly  agree (4).  The
scale  score  for  commitment  was  calculated
by averaging the five items (α = .87). Job sat-
isfaction was assessed using two items from
Cammann,  Fichman,  Jenkins,  and  Klesh
(1979):  “Considering  everything,  how  satis-
fied are you with your job?” and “Please in-


478

dicate  the  amount  of  personal  satisfaction
you receive from doing your job.” Responses
for  job  satisfaction  were  based  on  a  four-
point scale ranging from very satisfied (1) to
very dissatisfied (4). The scale score for job sat-
isfaction  was  the  average  of  the  items  (α =
.68). 

Independent Variables

Perceived Participative Decision Making,
Information Sharing, Training, and

Performance-Based Rewards 

Individuals should

exhibit agreement

about the presence

or absence of EI

within their

organization. 

Based  on  the  work  of  several  re-
searchers (e.g., Cohen et al., 1996;
Vandenberg,  Richardson,  &  East-
man, 1999), we used 20 items to
operationalize  the  four  perceived
EI  attributes  (participative  deci-
sion making: four items; informa-
tion sharing: four items; training:
four items; performance-based re-
wards:  six  items).  The  validity  of
these  measures  was  assessed  in
three  phases: 
ex-
ploratory  factor,  and  confirma-

content, 

tory factor analyses.

Phase  I: Content Analysis. Ten  subject-mat-
ter  experts  (SMEs)  were  used  to  verify  that
the items in the scale actually reflect the con-
struct  definitions  of  participative  decision
making,  information  sharing,  training,  and
performance-based  rewards.  Following  the
procedures  outlined  by  Hinkin  (1995), the
SMEs  were  asked  to  sort  the  items  by  con-
struct.  Eighteen  of  the  20  items  were  as-
signed to the correct a priori category more
than  80%  of  the  time,  and  thus  were  re-
tained  for  use  (McKenzie,  Podsakoff,  &  Fet-
ter, 1991). 

Phase  II: Exploratory  Factor  Analysis. The
total sample was randomly split in half such
that  one  subsample  was  used  for  the  ex-
ploratory  factor  analysis  and  the  other  sub-
sample for the confirmatory factor analysis.
Thus, using a subsample of 1,792, a principal
components  analysis  with  orthogonal  rota-

tion  was  conducted  to  examine  the  factor
structure of the 18 remaining items. Overall,
four  factors  emerged  with  eigenvalues
greater than 1, which together accounted for
58.2% of the variance in the data. Addition-
ally, all items loaded on their respective fac-
tors, with relatively small coefficients on the
other factors (< .40). 

Phase III: Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Con-
firmatory  factor  analyses  using  LISREL  8
(Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993) were conducted to
determine  how  well  the  model  developed
through  exploratory  analysis  would  fit  the
second subsample (N = 1,791). We examined
a four-factor model and found strong support
(χ2 [127] = 464.63, p < .001; TLI = .96; CFI =
.97; RMSEA = .04). The factor loadings and the
interfactor correlations from the latter analy-
sis are presented in Table II. Based on both the
exploratory  and  confirmatory  findings,  we
concluded that the 18 items were clearly op-
erationalizing  the  four  constructs  that  we
used to define perceived EI climate, and were
doing  so  with  minimal  overlap.  Thus,  the
scale  score  for  overall  perceived  EI  climate,
which was used in tests of all hypotheses, was
created  by  averaging  all  18  items.  The  scale
scores  for  the  individual  attribute  variables,
which were used in supplemental analysis for
testing  Hypotheses  1  and  2,  were  created  by
averaging items by attribute.

RESULTS

Data Aggregation

A  central  characteristic  of  a  climate  is  that
employees  throughout  the  organization
have similar perceptions regarding the attrib-
utes  defining  that  climate.  Therefore,  indi-
viduals should exhibit agreement about the
presence or absence of EI within their organ-
ization.  Following  this  logic,  the  James,
Demaree, and Wolf (1984) procedure for as-
sessing within-organization interrater agree-
ment (rwg) was calculated on each of the four
EI  attributes.  Using  .70  as  a  lower-bound
limit on agreement, three organizations that
did  not  demonstrate  sufficient  agreement
were eliminated from the sample. Thus, the

effective sample size for the remaining analy-
ses  was  89  and  not  92.  The  levels  of  agree-
ment among the 89 organizations ranged as
follows:  (a)  participative  decision  making  =
.74  to  .92;  (b)  information  sharing  =  .84  to
.95;  (c)  training  =  .72  to  .95;  and  (d)  per-
formance-based  rewards  =  .72  to  .92.  Addi-
tionally,  the  levels  of  agreement  for  organi-
zational commitment ranged from .83 to .96
and for job satisfaction, from .70 to .93. 

cal  regression  analysis  with  the  control
variables  entered  as  a  block  in  Step  1,  the
mediating  variables  (organizational  com-
mitment and job satisfaction) entered as a
block in Step 2, and the independent vari-
able (perceived EI climate) entered in Step
3.  The  resulting  coefficients  from  Step  3
were  compared  to  those  from  the  tests  of
Hypothesis  1  to  determine  whether  any
mediation took place. 

Tests of Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1 

Evidence supported

the presence of

skewness for all

variables except

turnover. 

Table III presents the means, stan-
dard  deviation,  and  correlations
for  the  variables  in  this  study.
Prior  to  the  main  analyses,  the
distributions of the four objective
measures were examined for non-
normality.  Evidence  supported
the  presence  of  skewness  for  all
variables  except  turnover.  As
such,  the  primary  analyses  were
conducted using the logarithm of
returns on assets, gains in net pre-
miums  written,  and  returns  on
surplus.  Hierarchical  regression  analyses
were  conducted  to  test  the  three  main  hy-
potheses (Cohen et al., 1996). For Hypothe-
ses  1  and  2,  the  control  variables  were  en-
tered in Step 1, and the perceived EI climate
variable was entered in Step 2.

With  respect  to  the  mediational  hy-
pothesis,  Hypothesis  3,  the  procedures  of
Baron and Kenny (1986) were followed. As
specified  by  them,  the  first  condition  for
mediation is that the independent variable
should be related to the mediators. The rea-
sonableness of this condition would be in-
ferred  from  the  test  of  Hypothesis  2.  The
second condition for mediation is that the
independent  variable  be  related  to  the
main  outcomes.  This  condition  would  be
inferred  from  the  test  of  Hypothesis  1
above.  Assuming  the  latter  conditions  are
met, the third condition would be observ-
ing a reduction in the regression coefficient
from  the  independent  variable  to  the  out-
comes after including the mediators in the
regression analysis. To test the latter condi-
tion, the final analysis was also a hierarchi-

Hypothesis 1 proposed that higher levels of
perceived EI climate would be positively as-
sociated  with  the  financial  performance  in-
dices  and  negatively  related  to  turnover.  As
presented in Table IV, Hypothesis 1 was com-
pletely  supported.  The  perceived  EI  climate
had positive and statistically significant asso-
ciations  with  the  financial  performance  in-
dices  (ROA,  β =  .24;  Gain  in  NPW,  β =  .31;
ROS,  β =  .34),  and  a  negative  association
with turnover (β = –.28). 

Hypothesis 2 

Hypothesis 2 proposed that higher levels of
perceived EI climate would be positively as-
sociated  with  organizational  commitment
and job satisfaction. As presented in Table IV,
Hypothesis  2  was  partially  supported,  with
perceived  EI  climate  significantly  related  to
commitment (β = .50). The overall F-score for
job  satisfaction  was  not  statistically  signifi-
cant. This latter result means that we did not
include job satisfaction as a mediator in the
tests of Hypothesis 3.

To  determine  the  relative  importance  of
the  EI  climate  relative  to  the  four  attributes
underlying it, the hierarchical regression was
again undertaken using the four attributes as
independent variables. These results are pre-
sented  in  Table  V.  While  the  four  attributes
had some association with some of the out-
comes,  particularly  organizational  commit-
ment, they did not have a consistent impact
across the range of outcomes. In contrast, the
overall perceived EI climate had a much more
consistent  pattern  of  statistically  significant
associations  across  the  objective  measures

and organizational commitment. If “relative
importance,”  as  stated  earlier,  is  defined  as
identifying influences across a broad range of
indices  that  collectively  embody  organiza-
tional effectiveness, then the perceived EI cli-
mate variable, and not the individual attrib-
utes,  are  more  important.  The  pattern  of
findings for the individual attributes on the
attitudinal  measures  suggest,  however,  that
individual attributes may play a role in inde-
pendently shaping some workplace attitudes. 

Hypothesis 3

The planned

creation of a climate

is one of the most

difficult challenges

an organization can

Hypothesis  3  predicted  that  em-
ployee morale would mediate the
relationships  between  the  per-
ceived EI climate and the four ob-
jective  measures.  Using  Baron
and  Kenny’s  (1986)  approach  to
mediation,  organizational  com-
mitment  was  found  to  com-
pletely  mediate  the  relationship
between perceived EI climate and
turnover. It did not, however, me-
diate  the  relationship  between
perceived  EI  climate  and  the  fi-
nancial  performance  measures.
Additionally,  job  satisfaction  was  not  a  me-
diator for any of the relationships. Thus, Hy-
pothesis 3 was only minimally supported.

undertake.

Discussion

A common belief about EI is that it is a pow-
erful management philosophy that has mul-
tiple positive effects for both employees and
overall  firm  performance  (Lawler,  1992;
Lawler, Ledford, & Mohrman, 1989; Leana &
Florkowski, 1992). The results of the present
study  support  this  common  belief  by
demonstrating  that  the  presence  of  a  per-
ceived multi-attribute climate of EI within an
organization is related to high levels of orga-
nizational effectiveness. More specifically, re-
sults  indicate  that  a  perceived  EI  climate  is
related  to  increased  financial  performance
and  reduced  turnover.  Additionally,  per-
ceived EI climate is related to increased em-
ployee  loyalty  or  organizational  commit-
ment. Such a combination of effects implies

that creating an EI climate is a potent inter-
vention,  which  could  provide  competitive
advantage to a firm. 

Specifically, while the current study sup-
ported a direct link between perceived EI cli-
mate (consisting of the four attributes of par-
ticipative  decision  making,  information
sharing, training, and performance-based re-
wards)  and  organizational  effectiveness,  an
earlier  study  (Vandenberg  et  al.,  1999)
demonstrated  which  business  practices  and
policies  of  the  organization  have  the
strongest influence on promoting an involve-
ment  climate.  Namely,  an  involvement  cli-
mate  appeared  strongest  in  organizations
with business practices that (a) directly linked
incentives to involvement-like behaviors; (b)
promoted  flexible  work  practices;  (c)  de-
signed jobs to be controlled more by the em-
ployee than by managers; (d) devoted exten-
sive resources to continuous learning; and (e)
provided clear direction to employees. 

Similarly,  another  study  (Richardson  &
Vandenberg, 2005) demonstrated that man-
agers’ transformational leadership behaviors
are also an important component of promot-
ing  a  climate  for  involvement.  Together,
these and the present study offer compelling
evidence that the stronger the perceived cli-
mate  for  involvement,  the  stronger  the  fi-
nancial performance of the organization, the
lower the turnover rate, and the higher the
morale  of  the  employees.  The  main  point,
therefore,  is  that  organizations  that  imple-
ment practices aimed at increasing employee
perceptions of all four attributes of EI should
enjoy  the  greatest  increases  in  overall  per-
formance. 

The planned creation of a climate is one
of the most difficult challenges an organiza-
tion can undertake (Schein, 1992). However,
because  they  are  so  difficult  to  imitate,  cer-
tain  climates  can  be  a  significant  source  of
competitive advantage for a company (Neal
& Tromley, 1995; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990).
Thus, it would be worth the effort for a com-
pany to create a climate of EI. As part of this
effort,  managers  should  recognize  that  the
company is most likely to succeed when em-
ployees have the appropriate tools, training,
and knowledge to do their best work. Addi-

tionally,  it  is  important  to  give  employees
appropriate  authority  and  decision-making
power  to  do  their  jobs  effectively.  Informa-
tion about company goals and performance
should be shared with employees—informa-
tion  is  vital  to  understanding  the  business.
Finally, rewards that are tied to the perform-
ance  standards  desired  by  the  organization
are  fundamental  for  reinforcing  desired  be-
haviors that contribute to the long-term ef-
fectiveness of the organization.

Additionally, because perceptions of em-
ployees about an EI climate appear to be so
crucial to achieving the desired effects, com-
panies should regularly monitor employees’
beliefs  about  the  EI  attributes  to  make  sure
that they are being recognized and favorably
received. It is important for employees at all
levels  of  the  organization  to  recognize  that
an EI climate exists if the organization is to
achieve maximum benefits. 

Limitations of Study 

Three limitations of this study provide oppor-
tunities for future research. First, the number
of organizations in the sample was relatively
small.  Additionally,  the  standard  deviations
on some of the measures such as EI, job satis-
faction, and organizational commitment indi-
cated  minimal  variance.  Although  the  hy-
potheses  were  supported,  future  research  on
this  topic  should  use  a  larger  number  and
broader  range  of  organizations  to  increase
variability  and  potentially  produce  stronger
results (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). 

Second,  the  sample  was  obtained  from
the insurance industry. By sampling one in-
dustry, we were able to avoid controlling for

industry  effects  on  financial  performance
(e.g.,  Huselid,  1995).  However,  to  increase
the generalizability of our results, additional
research should be conducted in a variety of
industries. Also, Lawler (1992) noted that an
EI climate might not be effective in all types
of  industries.  Indeed,  EI  actually  may  be
counterproductive in organizations or indus-
tries in which rigid adherence to standards is
required and in which employees have little
job discretion. Future research should exam-
ine  whether  the  positive  associations  be-
tween  an  EI  climate  and  organizational  ef-
fectiveness are moderated by industry type.
Third, the cross-sectional nature of the EI
climate and morale data did not allow us to
fully  test  for  causality.  Although  the  meas-
ures of financial performance were collected
one year after the practice data, future longi-
tudinal  research  should  directly  address  the
causal relationship between EI and all effec-
tiveness criteria. 

Conclusion

Overall,  this  study  demonstrated  empirical
support for the link between a perceived cli-
mate  of  EI  and  organizational  effectiveness.
Both  employees  and  organizations  benefit
from the presence of an EI climate in that it
is  associated  with 
increased  employee
morale, lower turnover rates, and stronger fi-
nancial  performance.  As  noted  by  Ledford
and Lawler (1994), “it is time to gain a richer,
more  context-dependent  understanding  of
employee  involvement”  (p.  635).  The  pres-
ent  study  charts  new  ground  by  providing
one of the first tests of EI from this organiza-
tional climate perspective.
