 An Investigation of the Information

 Content of (Certain) Social
 Responsibility Disclosures

 ROBERT W. INGRAM*

 This study addresses the relevance of certain social responsibility
 disclosures of firms to investors by empirically assessing their impact
 on security returns. The results of this investigation of the information
 content of voluntary disclosures may provide some insight into the
 possible effect of signals derived from a formal measurement and
 reporting system. 1

 Two related empirical tests of information content were conducted.
 The first analyzed returns for portfolios of securities selected from a
 broad spectrum of the market, whereas the second investigated the
 return performance of specific market segments. The next section of
 this paper discusses the social responsibility issue and reviews the
 literature. The following sections delineate the theoretical framework
 and methodology employed, depict the results of the tests, and draw
 conclusions and implications from the study.

 The Social Accountability Issue

 Several proposals for reporting social accountability data have been
 made (e.g., see American Accounting Association [1973], Beams and
 Fertig [1971], Bedford [1973], and Estes [1972]), but few empirical
 studies of such disclosures exist.

 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY DISCLOSURES 271

 Longstreth and Rosenbloom (L&R) [1973] and Belkaoui [1972] con-
 ducted field studies to determine the extent to which certain social
 disclosures might influence investment decisions. L&R surveyed insti-
 tutional investors and found that approximately 57 percent of the
 respondents indicated that they did consider social factors in addition
 to economic factors. Belkaoui presented financial statements, some of
 which contained pollution control data, to groups of bank officers,
 practicing accountants, and students. He concluded that the disclosure
 of pollution costs had an influence on investment decisions.

 Market based studies were conducted by Spicer [1978] and Belkaoui
 [1976]. Spicer tested the association between pollution performance
 indexes and firm characteristics in the pulp and paper industry. He
 concluded that pollution control records are useful for assessing firms'
 total and systematic risks. Belkaoui investigated security price
 changes in the months surrounding the date of disclosure of firms'
 pollution expenditures and concluded that the price behavior of the
 group of firms which made disclosures was different from the price
 behavior of firms which did not make disclosures.

 Hence, empirical studies on the actual impact of social accountabil-
 ity data have been limited to pollution control disclosures. In this
 study, I examine the impact of additional disclosure categories on
 security returns. The categories are listed in table 1.

 Theoretical Framework

 This study relies on the assumption that capital markets are
 efficient, in which case the information content of news announce-

 ments will be immediately and unbiasedly impounded into security
 prices. Let Rit be a random variable representing the rate of return on
 security i in period t, and 6it a random variable representing a
 potential source of information about security i in period t. (Tildes
 denote random variables.) If 6it does in fact have information content,
 the conditional distribution function of Rit should not be the same for
 all values of Git:

 G(RR1t) # G t (1)

 where G represents the distribution function, and the superscripts
 represent different signals from the information source which become
 available after capital market equilibrium is established at time t.
 Furthermore, if we assume the distribution function of security
 returns is normal, the inequality is implied by:

 E (RUtI61I) # E(R1 t026), or (2)
 Var (Rt|I6lt) # Var (Rit602), (3)
 where E represents expected value and Var represents variance (for
 further elaboration see Gonedes [1975]).2 The information source of
 concern for this study is firms' social responsibility disclosures con-
 tained in annual reports.

 Data Selection

 The sample consisted of annual reports of Fortune 500 companies
 issued for fiscal years ending between May 1, 1970 and April 30, 1976.3
 The specific firms which compose the Fortune 500 change from year to
 year, and only those firms which were listed for the entire time period
 covered by the study were included in the sample. This restriction was
 necessary to insure that disclosure data would be available for all
 sample firms each year. The second test discussed below involved a
 longitudinal study and used all five years of data for each firm.

 The sample was further constrained to those firms for -which
 monthly prices and dividends were available continuously from Janu-
 ary 1964 to August 1976. The Compustat Price, Dividends, Earnings
 (PDE) tape was used for these data. A total of 287 firms satisfied both
 conditions.

 2 I assume the return-generating function of all equity securities is expressed by the

 capital asset pricing model:

 E (Rit) = E (Rzt) + kit [E (Rmt) -E(R )],

 where E is the expected value operator, Rit is the return on security i in period t, RPt is
 the return on portfolio z in period t, with f8zt = 0, Rmt is the return on the market
 portfolio in period t, and kit is the systematic risk of security i in period t.

 3 The summary of firms' disclosures prepared by Ernst & Ernst [1971-76] was used to
 identify specific firms making disclosures. The period used in the study coincides with
 the periods used by Ernst & Ernst.

 The techniques used to select the sample limit the generalization of
 results. Firms included in the study tend to be among the larger, more
 stable firms in the market and all are listed on the New York Stock
 Exchange. Since these firms' securities constitute a large portion of
 the total value of all securities traded in the market, conclusions
 drawn from the study appropriately relate to investment decisions of a
 wide spectrum of market agents.

 Table 1 specifies the number of firms making disclosures in each of
 the five categories used in the study. The disclosures were partitioned
 into two groups (monetary and nonmonetary) for each category.
 Monetary disclosures possess the inherent quality of being cross-
 sectionally comparable, whereas nonmonetary disclosures, even if
 quantified in other terms, frequently lack a common denominator.
 Consequently, these two groups of disclosures may differ with respect
 to information content.

 Disclosures listed in table 1 are further partitioned according to the
 closing date of the firms' fiscal years.4 Note that both the number of
 firms making disclosures and the ratio of monetary to nonmonetary
 disclosures (for most categories) have increased over this time period.
 For example, in 1971, 127 sampled firms made environmental disclo-
 sures and only thirty-three of these were monetary. In 1975, 189 firms
 made environmental disclosures and over half, ninety-nine, were
 monetary.

 The environmental category includes disclosures related to such
 activities as pollution control, repair or protection of the environment,
 and conservation of natural resources. Fair business practices refer to
 employment and advancement of minorities (based on race and sex)
 and support for minority businesses. The personnel category involves
 activities related to employee health and safety and employee train-
 ing. Community involvement consists of donations of cash, products,
 and services to the community and support of employee involvement
 in the community. The product category includes such activities as
 product safety and improvement for consumer welfare. Examples of
 typical disclosures for the various categories are reproduced in the
 Appendix.

 Methodology: Test 1

 If a perfectly controlled experiment were possible, one could test for
 inequality of return functions by using the same securities and
 altering only the signal produced by the information source. Unfortu-
 nately, only one unique signal is possible for a specific firm in a given
 time period. If one relies on the empirical validity of the Capital Asset
 Pricing Model, this problem may be solved by aggregating firm data

 4Firms with closing dates from April 30, 1970 to May 1, 1971 are identified as 1971

 firms, and so forth.

 into homogeneous groups. The method used consists of building
 portfolios of firms according to the particular signals to be tested. The
 general mechanics and advantages of this approach are discussed in
 Gonedes [1974, 1975].

 Firms were first grouped according to the type and category of
 disclosure made. In the rest of this paper, these partitions will be
 represented as group 1 (monetary) and 2 (nonmonetary), and category
 E (environmental), F (fair business), Pe (personnel), C (community),
 and Pr (product). Firms in the sample which did not make disclosures
 were further partitioned by industry into group 3 (firms from indus-
 tries represented in groups 1 and 2) and group 4 (firms from all other
 industries). This partition was considered useful because various
 disclosures may be related to underlying economic or institutional
 conditions in some industries, but not in others. The Compustat four-
 digit industry classification was used to partition the firms.

 The actual construction of the portfolios proceeded in the following
 manner. (1) For the environmental category, thirty firms which made
 monetary disclosures in 1971 were selected at random, and the portfo-
 lio beta was computed as the arithmetic mean of the individual
 securities' betas.5 The simple market model was used to compute
 individual beta values. The monetary return series for each firm was
 computed for sixty months prior to the first portfolio formation month
 using the natural logarithm of the price relative adjusted for divi-
 dends. Fisher's arithmetic index was used as a proxy for the market
 portfolio (see Fisher [1966] for derivation of the index).

 (2) The monthly return series for the portfolio was computed as the
 arithmetic mean of the monthly returns for each component security:

 Rpt= YwRit (4)

 n

 where Rpt is the return on portfolio p in month t and n is the number of
 securities in the portfolio (n 30). The period used to compute the
 monthly return series consisted of the nine months prior to the end of
 each firm's fiscal year and three months subsequent to the end of the
 fiscal year.

 The use of the twelve-month period beginning with the ninth month
 prior to the close of the firms' fiscal years seems logical, since nearly
 all firms issue their annual reports before the end of the third month
 following the close of the fiscal year. Since alternative and more
 timely sources of information exist in addition to annual reports, it is
 reasonable to assume that the information content of the reports will
 be impounded in security prices in the months prior to the release of
 the annual reports (for additional discussion, see Gonedes [1975]).

 4 The procedure used to compute portfolio betas is one of several possible methods.
 This method was selected because it has been tested in previous research (Gonedes
 [1975]) and because it facilitates the creation of equal beta portfolios.

 (3) Identical procedures were used to produce a portfolio of thirty
 firms which made monetary disclosures for each of the four periods
 1972-75, except that thirty-six firms were randomly selected and-six
 firms were subsequently removed to produce a portfolio with the same
 beta value as the 1971 portfolio.6

 (4) Steps 1-3 resulted in a portfolio return series of sixty months for
 the years 1971 through 1975. The-procedure produced returns for firms
 which made environmental monetary disclosures, although any one
 firm may not have been a part of the portfolio for the entire sixty
 months. Reconstruction of the portfolio each period was necessary to
 ensure beta stability, since the parameters of the regression model
 may not be stable over time (see Gonedes [1973a]).

 (5) Steps 1-4 were repeated for firms in groups 2-4. The same
 techniques were used to ensure a portfolio return series of sixty
 months with a beta value equal to that of the monetary disclosure
 portfolio.

 These same steps were also repeated for each of the other categories,
 with two exceptions. First, portfolios were not constructed for group 1
 in each category because of the small number of firms making
 monetary disclosures in these categories. Second, the small numbers
 of firms making any disclosures in category C in 1971 and Pr in 1973
 forced their elimination in constructing the portfolios for these cate-
 gories. Therefore, the portfolio return series for each of these catego-
 ries consisted of only forty-eight months.

 This portfolio construction process yielded sixteen portfolios distrib-
 uted among the five social responsibility disclosures, as shown in table
 2. The portfolios will be referred to in the remainder of this study as
 E1-4, F1-4, etc., as listed in the table. The estimated portfolio betas
 (,3) are also indicated.

 HYPOTHESES

 The null hypothesis of no information content for each of the

 disclosure category-group combinations may be represented as:

 Ho: G(RP4Oi) = G(Rjl~j) (5)

 where Pi(j, is the return on the i(j)th portfolio of each category, O6(j) is
 the disclosure associated with the i (j)th portfolio, i r/j, and either i or
 j is a disclosure portfolio.

 RESULTS

 The estimated portfolio means and variances are presented in table
 2. The average monthly returns for the period tested are all close to

 6 This procedure results in a strictly nonrandom sample. However, the portfolios
 should still be representative of the population, since the selection process should not
 bias the portfolio returns.

 for the test period. Three of the disclosure categories (E, F, and C) had
 the same rankings within categories, with the disclosure portfolio(s)
 demonstrating the highest return(s) and the last portfolio the lowest
 return. In the personnel category, the second portfolio had the highest
 return, and in the product category, the last portfolio had the highest.
 A series of t-tests were conducted on all paired differences between
 portfolio means for each category. A series of tests were conducted on
 all paired variance ratios for each category as well, using the F-ratio
 as the test statistic. The results of these tests are presented in table 3.
 The results of the t-tests indicate that no significant differences are
 evident between the portfolio means at a = .40. The probability
 associated with the t-tests is at or below .40 in fifteen of the sixteen
 tests.

 The tests of variances also indicate that the ratios are insignificant
 at a = .10 in all but one case, and this case involves two no-disclosure
 portfolios. Consequently, the portfolio analyses did not produce evi-
 dence to warrant rejection of the null hypotheses. That is, there was
 no evidence that social responsibility disclosures possess information
 content for the firms used in this investigation.

 These results are consistent with either of two explanations. First,
 the disclosures may possess no information content. Investors may

 betas only when the portfolios are minimum variance portfolios.

 discount the disclosures as being of no predictive value. Alternatively,
 the aggregation process used in this approach may have averaged out
 effects on specific subsets of disclosure firms. Individual returns may
 be conditional upon disclosures and additional factors associated with
 various market segments.

 Methodology: Test 2

 A second examination of security returns was conducted to test
 these alternative explanations. Three factors which were considered
 to have potential impact on responses to social disclosures were
 selected for inclusion in the study. These factors were the industry to
 which the firm belonged, the sign of the firm's excess earnings in the
 year of the disclosure, and the year the disclosure was made.

 Industry is an important attribute for consideration, since the
 nature of and motivation for disclosures vary according to the produc-
 tion-investment alternatives available to individual firms. These
 alternatives are likely to be more similar among firms in one industry
 than between firms in different industries.

 Similarly, previous research (e.g., Ball and Brown [1968] and
 Gonedes [1974]) has shown that earnings numbers possess significant
 information content in that positive excess earnings tend to be associ-
 ated with positive abnormal returns and vice versa.

 Another variable of potential importance for the analysis is the
 relevance of the disclosure over time. The time period used in the

 present study (1971-75) represents a relatively lengthy period, given
 the dynamic nature of the social responsibility environment. Investor
 assessments of the usefulness of information may not have been
 uniform across years.

 The segmentation process did not use portfolios, because the large
 number of possible segments which would result from partitioning the
 firms according to industry (I), excess earnings (EE), fiscal year (Y),
 and five disclosure categories would necessitate numerous portfolios of
 few securities. Instead, a technique reported by Sonquist, Baker, and
 Morgan [1971] was used. This technique is particularly suited to the
 present study, since it is designed for an intervally scaled dependent
 variable and nominally or ordinally scaled independent variables.
 Furthermore, it does not assume additivity.

 The procedure is an iterative process which partitions a group,
 through a series of binary splits, into subgroups. At each iteration,
 the subgroup with the largest sum of squares is selected for splitting.
 This group is split into two mutually exclusive subgroups according to
 the categories of the independent variable which maximize the be-
 tween sum of squares.

 Excess returns, computed via the simple market model, were used
 as the dependent variable in order to control for systematic risk. The
 same return data used in the portfolio analysis were used for this
 analysis.

 The excess return series for each firm-year (1971-75) was computed
 using the regression parameters determined in the portfolio study. For
 each month included in the analysis, the excess return was computed
 as:

 ji = Rit-ai - 8iRmt (6)

 where Rit is the return on security i in month t, a and ,3 are regression
 parameters computed over the sixty months prior to the firm-year being
 analyzed, Rmt is the return on the market portfolio in month t, and ji is
 the excess return on security i. The excess monthly returns for each
 firm were next summed over the twelve months beginning with the
 ninth month prior to the close of each fiscal year used in the study to
 form the cumulative excess return for that year:

 CER = 2it (7)

 t=1

 Social responsibility disclosures, industry, fiscal year, and excess
 earnings were independent variables. Social responsibility disclosures
 were classified by disclosure type - (1) no disclosure, (2) nonmonetary,
 (3) monetary. Fiscal years were classified 1-5 (1971-75). Industries were
 classified into four groups according to the Compustat two-digit code of
 those industries which were represented by at least twenty-five firms in
 the study. The four industries were (1) foods -2200, (2) chemicals -

 2800, (3) industrial manufacturing- 3500, and (4) transportation manu-
 facturing- 3700.

 Specification of a firm's excess earnings requires a model of the
 process generating earnings. One model which has produced successful
 results when compared with others is a market-index model using first
 differences:

 AEit = ai + /3iAEmt + eit, (8)

 where AEit is the first difference in the income of firm i in year t, ai and
 ,3i are regression parameters, AEmt is the first difference in the income
 of the market portfolio in period t, and eit is the excess earnings of firm
 i in period t.

 Tests of this model have shown that the model is descriptive of firms'
 earnings processes (Gonedes [1973b]). The model is more descriptive if
 the income numbers are weighted by the value of the firm's common
 equity. Accordingly, the value of AEi was computed for each firm-year
 using the first-difference of the ratio of income available for common to
 common equity:

 AEit = (itlCi t-1) - (Is t_11Ci t-2) (9)

 where Iit is the income available for common for firm i in period t, and
 Cia, is' the common equity of firm i at the end of period t-1. The
 Compustat Annual Industrial tape was used to determine the value of
 each variable.

 The market index was computed as:

 AEmt = [it(ciltil/ct-1) -Ii,t-l(Ci,t-21Ct-2)1, (10)

 where the summation is across all NYSE firms on the Compustat tape
 for year t. The values of AEit were regressed against the values of AEmt
 for the fourteen years prior to the beginning of each year of the analysis
 period. The resulting regression parameters were then used to deter-
 mine the excess earnings for each firm for the years under examination.
 The sign of the excess earnings - (1) negative or (2) positive - was used
 as the independent variable.

 The intuitive explanation for the validity of the model is that cross-
 section dependencies exist in the economy which affect earnings just as
 they affect security prices. Changes in production, technology, govern-
 ment policy, and the general price level are some examples of factors
 which may affect the earnings numbers of all firms in the economy
 (Gonedes [1973b]).

 HYPOTHESES

 The null hypothesis of no information content for social responsibility

 disclosures for each market segment may be represented as:

 Ho: E(CERiO0i) = E(CERjlOj), (11)

 where CERi(j) is the cumulative excess return for the i (j)th group of a
 market segment, ei(j, is the disclosure associated with the i (j)th group of
 a market segment, and iij.8

 RESULTS

 The iteration process resulted in eighteen splits which partitioned the
 sampled firms into various market segments (illustrated in fig. 1). The
 sequence of splits denotes the relative importance of the independent
 variables for explaining the variation in the combined group. Excess
 earnings was the most important variable, with positive earnings being
 associated with positive excess returns. These results are consistent
 with earlier findings (e.g., Ball and Brown [1968] and Gonedes [1973b]).
 Subsequent splits occurred on the year and industry variables. These
 factors were, in most cases, of more importance in explaining the excess
 return variations than were the disclosure variables.9 In only one case
 (split 7) did a disclosure category precede a split on a nondisclosure
 variable which had not previously entered into the model. The order of
 splits suggests that the disclosure variables are of secondary impor-
 tance, but may be significant for certain segments of the market in
 specific years. The nonsymmetrical shape of the tree diagram indicates
 nonuniform assessments of information content for the disclosures
 across all firms and/or time periods. 10

 The statistical significance of each split was examined via a t-test of
 the difference between the means of the subgroups resulting from each
 split. Results are presented in table 4. All of the splits in figure 1 are
 statistically significant for explaining the variation in the excess
 returns of the preceding group at a ? .10.

 Table 4 indicates the classification of the variables and the estimated
 means of each subgroup. Several of the variables had more than two
 classes, and thus the binary splits combined classes for these variables.
 The class(es) with the lowest excess returns is always listed first in the
 table. In most cases, the firms which made social responsibility disclo-
 sures outperformed those which did not. Splits 12, 13, and 15 demon-
 strated results opposite to the other splits, and splits involving environ-
 mental disclosures indicate that monetary disclosure firms outper-
 formed both no-disclosure and nonmonetary disclosure firms.

 8 Information content could also be evaluated by comparing group variances. The
 ratios of the group variances of the splits derived in the study were not significant at a

 .20, and discussion is omitted to conserve space.
 9 The splitting procedure identifies multicollinearity by analysis of changes in the
 ratio of between sum of squares to total sum of squares for each independent variable at
 each iteration. Multicollinearity did not appear to be present among any of the variables
 used in this study.

 10 The procedure can also be used as input for a multiple regression program designed
 for categorical variables (see Andrews et al. [1973]). Since the present study is
 descriptive in nature, the determination of a predictive model was not considered of
 primary importance.

 All of the disclosure categories used in this study were significant for
 a specific market segment, in spite of the fact that monetary disclosures
 were not considered in four of the five categories. The specific market
 segments which revealed significant responses are summarized in table

 tion content was demonstrated in environmental disclosures for firms
 with positive excess earnings in 1971, 1973, and 1974, regardless of
 industry or other social responsibility disclosures. Industry attributes
 were important, along with excess earnings and year, for nearly all
 significant disclosures, and other social disclosures were important in
 three cases.

 These results suggest that the information content of the disclosures
 varies across firms, once industry classification, the sign of the excess
 earnings of the firm, and the fiscal year in which the disclosures were
 made are taken into account. In comparing these results with those of

 the first test, note that the sample of firms had to be partitioned into
 segments before the disclosures were observed to be significant. Appar-
 ently, combining the segments, as in the first test, washes out the
 effects of the disclosures on security returns. "I

 The findings are logical in light of (1) the differences in production-
 investment alternatives of firms in various industries, (2) the differ-
 ences in motivation for disclosure by firms with differing performance
 records, and (3) the dynamic nature of the legal and social environment
 in which disclosures are made.

 Summary

 This study was an investigation of the information content of firms'
 voluntary social responsibility disclosures. Two tests were performed
 involving various groupings of firms according to the nature of the
 disclosures made in five disclosure categories. These tests permitted
 analysis of the information content of the disclosures for an unseg-
 mented sample of Fortune 500 firms and for market segments parti-
 tioned by the sign of firms' excess earnings, by industry, and by fiscal
 year.

 The results of the tests are consistent with the statement that the
 information content of firms' social responsibility disclosures is condi-
 tional upon the market segment with which the firm is identified. These
 findings suggest that it may be important to evaluate information
 content by analyzing the impact of the signals on market segments (or
 segments identified by firm-specific characteristics), rather than on a
 general cross-section of firms.

 11 Factors used in the present study to segment the market are obviously a selection
 of numerous possible factors. The results of tests using alternative factors might be
 more or less significant than the results of the present study. Identification of specific
 factors was not as important in this research as identification of information content.
 Analysis of factors which may affect the information content of disclosures remains a
 topic for future research.

 APPENDIX

 Examples of Social Responsibility Disclosures

 Examples of typical disclosures for the various categories are reproduced
 below to enable the reader better to grasp the nature of the information
 reported. These disclosures were selected from 1975 annual reports as reported
 by Ernst & Ernst [1975].

 Environmental. . . collecting mains at the coke oven complex were
 replaced at a cost of $2.6 million, resulting in a reduction of air emissions ....
 The company also completed a $2.7 million biological water treatment plant as
 part of an overall water pollution abatement system." (Jim Walter Corporation)
 Fair business. "The company now has approximately 17,200 employees from
 minority groups and 26,850 women, representing 10.9 percent and 16.9 percent
 respectively of the total IBM population in the U.S." (IBM)

 Personnel. "Olin's determined safety drive produced a new safety record for
 the company in 1975; an accident frequency rate of only 0.82 compared with the
 previous record of 1.39 set in 1974." (Olin)

 Community. "In 1975 Firestone Scholarships with a potential value of nearly
 $500,000 were awarded to 44 sons and daughters of Firestone employees."
 (Firestone)

 Product. "Along with programs to increase consumer satisfaction with
 product quality and performance, Celanese maintains programs designed to
 reduce safety problems arising from the use or handling of its products."
