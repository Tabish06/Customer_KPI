In recent years, more and more consumer goods ﬁrms have started to tap into the creative potential of their
user communities to fuel their new product development pipelines. Although many have hailed this para-
digm shift as a highly promising development for ﬁrms, hardly any research has systematically compared
the actual market performance of user-generated products with designer-generated ones. We ﬁll this void
by presenting a unique data set gathered from the Japanese consumer goods brand Muji, which has drawn
on both sources of ideas in parallel in recent years. We demonstrate that user-generated products, which
are found to generally contain higher novelty, outperformed their designer-generated counterparts on key
market performance metrics. Speciﬁcally,
in the ﬁrst year after introduction, sales revenues from
user-generated products were three times higher and gross margins were four times greater than those of
designer-generated products. These effects also increased over time: after three years, the aggregate sales
revenues of user-generated products were, on average, 1.25 billion yen (approximately 16 million dollars)
higher, or ﬁve times greater, than the sales of designer-generated products. The corresponding average mar-
gin was an impressive 619 million yen (approximately 8 million dollars) higher, or six times greater, than the
margin for designer-generated products. Finally, user-generated products were more likely to survive the
three-year observation period than designer-generated products (i.e., were still on the market three years
after introduction). These ﬁndings clearly favor the paradigm shift identiﬁed in marketing research and ap-
peal to managers considering the integration of user ideas into the process of new product development.
We discuss our study's limitations and identify important avenues for future research.

1. Introduction

For decades (if not for much longer), professional marketers,
designers, and engineers rather than consumers or users have been
the dominant agents in the development of new consumer products.
Although it has always been imperative to listen to customers to dis-
cern emerging market trends and unmet consumer needs, design
professionals employed by ﬁrms (or their subcontractors) are usually
responsible for translating the resulting opportunities into new prod-
uct ideas and market offerings (Cooper, 2001; Crawford & Di
Benedetto, 2000; Ulrich & Eppinger, 1995; Urban & Hauser, 1993).
Until very recently, ﬁrms did not consider user involvement in the
process of generating ideas for new product development (NPD) to

be particularly promising. For example, as Schulze and Hoegl (2008,
p. 1744) note, “relying on the method of asking buyers to describe
potential future products, big leaps to novel product ideas are generally
not likely.” One of the key assumptions underlying this dominant idea
generation paradigm is that a ﬁrm's professionals, unlike customers or
users, have the requisite expertise to invent new and useful product
concepts (e.g., Amabile, 1998; Weisberg, 1993). A ﬁrm's professionals
“have acquired skills and capabilities that allow them to perform most
design tasks more effectively and at a higher level of quality” (Ulrich,
2007, Chapter 3, 5ff) and they “often have a signiﬁcant advantage […]
over consumers, in terms of their knowledge, training, and experience”
(Moreau & Herd, 2010, p. 807).

However, research on the sources of innovation (Von Hippel, 1988)
has long challenged this fundamental assumption and the related,
widely held view that users are of little value to ﬁrms in providing
ideas to solve their unmet consumer problems (as opposed to merely
pointing out such problems to ﬁrms in the ﬁrst place). In particular,
this line of research has found that many major and minor innovations
across various industries were originally developed by users rather than
professionals in ﬁrms (cf. Von Hippel, 2005). In their seminal work,

Lilien, Morrison, Searls, Sonnack, and von Hippel (2002) provide further
evidence that active user involvement in idea generation might beneﬁt
a ﬁrm's NPD efforts, at least in industrial markets. Speciﬁcally, Lilien et
al. (2002) compare the potential value of several new industrial product
concepts jointly developed by 3 M personnel and selected lead users to
those developed by more conventional means (i.e., internal developers
only). They found that the former outperformed the latter on key inno-
vation indicators that were assessed by 3 M managers (e.g., the product
concept's novelty compared to the competition or its potential to create
an entire new product family). Furthermore, they found that the sales
forecasts for concepts developed by lead users were eight times higher
than those of internally developed ideas.

One might plausibly argue that working with knowledgeable indus-
trial users is one thing, while working with potential end consumers is
another. However, in various consumer goods domains as well, users
are frequently found to innovate for themselves, and many of their
innovations are commercially attractive (Franke, von Hippel, & Schreier,
2006). For example, a recent survey of a representative sample of UK con-
sumers revealed that six percent, or nearly three million consumers, inno-
vated in the domain of household products. Similar national user
innovation statistics have been reported for other countries, including
the US (5%, or almost 12 million consumers) and Japan (4%, or almost
4 million consumers) (Von Hippel, Ogawa, & de Jong, 2011).

Thus, user innovation has come of age as many consumer goods
ﬁrms are challenging the traditional paradigm and experimenting
with new ways to more actively integrate users into the idea genera-
tion process. In extreme cases, ﬁrms like Threadless no longer employ
designers but rely exclusively on their user communities to generate
new products (Ogawa & Piller, 2006). Many established ﬁrms and
brands, such as LEGO, Dell, and Muji, have followed suit and now
complement their in-house efforts with public idea contests known
as “crowdsourcing” initiatives, where idea generation is outsourced
to a potentially large, unknown population (the crowd) in the form
of an open call (Bayus, 2010; Howe, 2008; Surowiecki, 2004). Thus,
crowdsourcing relies on a self-selection process among users who
are willing and able to respond to widely broadcast idea generation
competitions (Jeppesen & Lakhani, 2010; Piller & Walcher, 2006;
Poetz & Schreier, 2012).

Conceptually, the key insight is that some (but, of course, not all)
ideas generated by these self-selected users might outperform the
ones generated by ﬁrm designers (Poetz & Schreier, 2012; Schreier,
Fuchs, & Dahl, 2012). Users may have a competitive edge in idea gen-
eration over designers through their experience as consumers.
Leading-edge users, in particular, may have tried to solve consump-
tion problems themselves, and their ideas may be commercially
attractive because they foreshadow what other consumers will demand
in the future (cf. Von Hippel, 2005). The respective user population that
might be activated via crowdsourcing is also naturally much larger and
more diverse compared to the team of designers employed by a given
ﬁrm; a ﬁrm's user community may comprise thousands of talented
users from highly diverse backgrounds. It follows that the generation
of more (and more diverse) ideas increases the odds of generating a
few truly exceptional ones (e.g., Gross, 1972; Schreier et al., 2012;
Surowiecki, 2004; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2009).

Empirically, researchers have recently begun to address important
questions like what motivates users to participate (e.g., Hertel,
Niedner, & Herrmann, 2003), how idea contests should be organized
(e.g., Boudreau, Lacetera, & Lakhani, 2011), how user ideas can be
screened effectively (e.g., Toubia & Flores, 2007), or how consumers
perceive user-driven ﬁrms (e.g., Fuchs & Schreier, 2011). In a recent
study, for example, Schreier et al. (2012) ﬁnd that consumers associ-
ate user-driven ﬁrms with higher innovation abilities, that is, they
perceive such ﬁrms as being better able to generate innovative new
products. In a series of experimental studies, they further ﬁnd that
this innovation inference prompts consumers to demand one and
the same set of products more strongly. This ﬁnding is especially

interesting because objective product properties were kept constant
between experimental conditions.

From an NPD perspective, however, the important question is not
if the design mode affects consumer perceptions of innovation ability,
but rather if it affects the objective quality of new product ideas actu-
ally generated. This question has recently been addressed by Poetz
and Schreier (2012), who compared the quality of ideas for new
baby products generated by a ﬁrm's designers to those generated by
users in a public idea contest. Ideas from both sources were judged
by company executives (who were blind to the source of ideas), and
the key ﬁnding was that user ideas were characterized by higher nov-
elty and higher customer beneﬁt, but also by lower feasibility.

Although these ﬁndings are promising, it has yet to be explored
whether the best of these user ideas, if realized, would eventually
perform better on the market. There are several reasons that make
this extrapolation non-obvious. First and foremost,
it should be
noted that in most cases ﬁrms still have to translate user ideas into
marketable products; a process that demands much effort and
involves many decisions that may or may not lead to ultimate market
success. More speciﬁcally, lower feasibility scores of user ideas point
to the possibility that the related promise might never be realized.
Second, and on a related note, it could be that high innovativeness
and low feasibility eventually boost development and production
costs and thereby reduce any potential margin. Third, it is always an
empirical question how well managers' perceptions of ideas match
consumer reactions to new products once they reach the shelves.
Even if this match is strikingly high (i.e., no judgment and translation
errors are involved), it remains unclear how a certain increment in
innovativeness (e.g., 10%) will translate into incremental market perfor-
mance (e.g., X% more sales). Finally, it is worth noting that ﬁrms can
only market a very limited number of new products at a given point
in time. As such, what matters is not the entire distribution and the
average idea quality, but rather the extreme values: the very best
ideas available (e.g., Fleming, 2007; Singh & Fleming, 2010). It remains
unclear whether the very best ideas from both sources would differ to
such an extent that one could observe managerially meaningful differ-
ences in the ultimate consumer reactions.

Against this backdrop, it is surprising that a systematic, empirical
market performance assessment of user- vs. designer-generated con-
sumer products is still missing in the literature, despite the broad and
growing interest in this topical phenomenon. This is most likely due
to the difﬁculty of obtaining reliable quantitative market data from
real-world practice. Such research is important because the market
performance of user-driven initiatives will guide marketers in decid-
ing whether to follow the paradigm shift and involve users in gener-
ating new product ideas. Drawing on a unique data set gathered from
the Japanese consumer goods brand Muji, we address this important
gap in the literature. In short, our study reveals that user-generated
products systematically outperform designer-generated ones in terms
of important outcome variables, including actual sales revenues. Most
importantly, we see our study as “initial evidence” in favor of user-
generated products and as a contribution to a more critical reﬂection
on the dominant NPD paradigm. As such, this paper makes a second
contribution in its conceptual discussion of the generalizability of our
ﬁndings.

2. Study method

2.1. New product development at Muji

Muji began experimenting with idea contests ten years ago; thus,
it is a forerunner among ﬁrms that market user-generated products
on a broad scale. Muji has also recently marketed a number of user-
generated products alongside products generated by the ﬁrm's
designers, which allows us to empirically assess the performance of
the two approaches. In addition to granting us access to sensitive


162

data (e.g., sales data, gross margins), the ﬁrm provided us with
substantial support to complement and validate performance data
(e.g., interviews with executives, coding of ideas).

Muji is an established Japanese manufacturer and retailer brand of a
broad range of consumer goods of Ryohin Keikaku Co., Ltd, with a par-
ticular focus on interior and household products. Muji's products are
sold in almost 500 Muji stores in 22 countries including Japan, China,
the US, the UK, France, Italy, and Germany. In 2010, Muji generated
approximately 170 billion yen in sales revenue (approximately
2.2 billion dollars), producing net proﬁts of almost 8 billion yen
(approximately 100 million dollars). Over the last few decades,
Muji has become known for developing and marketing innovative
consumer solutions, which is reﬂected in their receipt of more than
90 design and innovation prizes (e.g., two international Design
Oscars awarded by iF International Forum Design, two Good Design
Award Gold awards from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion,
one Michael E. Porter Prize for innovation). Their ability to generate
successful
innovations sets a high standard of performance for
user-generated products.

For the purposes of our research, we focus on Muji's furniture
division. By focusing on one product type, we minimize the potential
of confounding effects that arise from comparing different product
categories. The furniture division is strategically important to Muji
because it accounts for nearly 20 percent of their total sales. We
also selected Muji's furniture division because it has experimented
more with user-generated products in recent years than other divi-
sions; in other words, data for the furniture division contained the
largest number of observations for user-generated products. One
might argue that this method of sample selection may bias our results
because the furniture division began to rely on user input due to the
underperformance of designers, thereby lowering the performance
standard that user-generated products must exceed. In our inter-
views at Muji, however, we found no evidence for such selection bias.
In 2002, Muji launched the ﬁrst user-driven piece of furniture, the
“Floor Sofa,” which is a large cushion that sits on the ﬂoor and adjusts
to the body. Because of the novelty and experimental nature of this
project, Muji collected binding customer pre-orders before investing
in ﬁnal product development to minimize the risk of failure. The
Floor Sofa was a great success. Within the ﬁrst year, it generated
almost 500 million yen in sales, a record that was not exceeded by
any of Muji's designer-generated products until the beginning of
our observation period (2005). Prior to 2005, the ﬁrm carried out
another crowdsourcing experiment that led to the production of a
new piece of furniture in 2003 (a small, movable wall shelf) that gen-
erated ﬁrst-year sales of 71 million yen (ranking it sixth among the
15 new furniture products introduced in 2003).

Based on the success of these products, the ﬁrm decided to use
crowdsourcing on a more systematic basis. During our observation
period (February 2005 to July 2009), 43 new products were developed,
produced, and introduced to the Japanese market. Thirty-seven prod-
ucts were designer-generated, and six were user-generated. We
excluded the two previous user-generated products from our analysis
because they differed from the other products in terms of the idea selec-
tion process (binding customer pre-orders compared to selection by the
ﬁrm). However, the results do not change if the observation period is
extended to include these two early user-generated products, as well
as the respective designer-generated products (results available from
the authors upon request). In what follows, we describe the develop-
ment of designer- and user-generated products in greater detail.

2.1.1. Designer-generated new products

Muji's conventional approach to NPD adheres closely to the recom-
mendations made in the traditional literature on marketing and innova-
tion. The active agents in idea generation are the ﬁrm's designers,
engineers, and marketers, who work in teams organized around specif-
ic, new product development projects. Based on established market

research (e.g., market trend studies, focus groups with target con-
sumers), the team identiﬁes and selects important consumption prob-
lems to be addressed by a new product (referred to as new product
“themes”). In one product development project, for example, the
theme was limited storage capacity in consumers' bedrooms due to
small room sizes. Based on insight from market research, members of
the project team generate new product ideas (e.g., a ﬂat-panel shelf
matching the ﬁrms' line of beds). The best ideas enter the next phase
of product development, where designers propose more detailed
design concepts and product speciﬁcations based on the product's
intended functionality (e.g., a speciﬁc design of a ﬂat-panel shelf that is
as thin as possible yet large enough to guarantee proper use and stabili-
ty). The team then decides what concept to move to the next stage. Final-
ly, a new product is introduced to the market. The key characteristic for
our study is that it is the internal employees who generate new product
ideas aimed to address the selected consumer problem (i.e., the new
product theme).

2.1.2. User-generated products

In a second development track, Muji invites users to generate ideas
for new products. Anyone who registers on their website can partici-
pate. Similar to the internal development of designer-generated prod-
ucts, idea generation follows a speciﬁc theme for which solutions can
be proposed. Users can also strongly inﬂuence the selection of the
theme by participating in online discussion boards (as is the case in
the designer-generated track). The theme “Suwaru Seikatsu” (“Sit
Down Life”), which aimed to generate ideas for better and more com-
fortable sitting solutions in consumers' homes, was one of the ﬁrst
themes to be successfully outsourced to users. The theme was broadcast
to users, who responded with many new product ideas, including the
eventual winner: the Floor Sofa. After the ﬁrst stage of idea generation,
users can also comment, vote, and improve on each other's ideas. The
best idea is adopted by a Muji project team, which deﬁnes the product
characteristics in more detail (e.g., external fabrics, cushion ﬁlling),
seeks further feedback from the user community, and ﬁnally moves
the new product to the full production stage. Thus, Muji employees
are also heavily involved in the development process for new products
in this second track. In contrast to the ﬁrst track, however, new product
ideas are generated by users rather than the ﬁrm's designers.

Adopted user ideas in our observation period included the follow-
ing: a sofa-bed (a sofa that can easily be changed to a bed and vice
versa); a wooden cupboard with a movable wagon to increase ﬂexi-
bility of use; a small sofa chair with slim arms to ﬁt in small rooms;
a highly versatile stacking shelf; a bed with a thin, yet robust, wooden
frame to provide more storage space under the bed; and a sofa with
arm rests that are comfortable for both sitting (arms) and lying
down (head and legs).

A series of in-depth interviews with senior managers and project
members revealed that the two design tracks did not differ substantially
on other important dimensions. In particular, projects centered around
designer-generated vs. user-generated products did not differ in terms
of the human resources invested by the ﬁrm (e.g., the quantity and
quality of project staff). Furthermore, it is unlikely that employee moti-
vation differed substantially between the two development processes
because the ﬁrm's employees usually work on several projects at once
(including designer- and user-generated products), and both individual
and team incentives are identical across projects. Finally, the ﬁrm's idea
and concept selection criteria are identical in both tracks; a minimum
threshold of expected sales and gross margins must be met before a
project moves to full production. Interviews with managers further
refuted the argument that adopted user-generated ideas “survived a
tougher screening” process. Therefore, it is unlikely that any differences
in performance between designer- and user-generated products are
attributable to these alternative factors.

Nonetheless, the number of ideas generated differed systematically
between the two processes, which is consistent with the theoretical


H. Nishikawa et al. / Intern. J. of Research in Marketing 30 (2013) 160–167

163

work on user involvement and crowdsourcing (Poetz & Schreier, 2012;
Schreier et al., 2012). The average estimated number of ideas per theme
was approximately ten in the designer condition (this number did not
vary much across projects because teams are expected to come up
with at least ten good ideas before a choice is made), whereas the lowest
number of ideas per theme was over 400 in the user condition (the
observed maximum was over 2000). Any random user idea, therefore,
has clearly lower odds of being selected, ceteris paribus. However, this
does not bias our results. If both distributions empirically ended at the
same right-hand point and these top ideas were selected, there should
still be no difference in market performance, as there were no differ-
ences in the selection criteria employed. If, however, extreme values
of the user distribution stretched farther to the right (e.g., because
having more ideas increases the likelihood of generating some extreme
values; e.g., Gross, 1972; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2009), the best user-
generated ideas may very well perform better. Such a scenario is consis-
tent with the theoretical arguments that favor user involvement.

2.2. Measures

2.2.1. Independent variable

The independent variable is the source of idea generation: profes-
sional designers vs. users (i.e., user-generated vs. designer-generated
products).

2.2.2. Dependent variables

Our key outcome variable is the products' actual market perfor-
mance, measured as aggregate unit sales generated in the ﬁrst year
after market introduction. In addition, we capture proﬁtability by
measuring the products' monetary value of sales and gross margins.
Because the ﬁrm does not allocate ﬁxed costs to individual products,
we cannot assess the ﬁrst-year proﬁts of products, but only their
gross margins. Data from the ﬁrst year that a product is on the market
form the most important basis for a product's performance assess-
ment by Muji because furniture products are characterized by short
product life cycles (i.e., the ﬁrst year usually produces the highest
sales). To check the robustness of our results, we also gathered aggre-
gate sales data three years after a product was introduced to the mar-
ket (the average product life cycle of Muji products is approximately
three years), as well as product survival information (i.e., information
about which products survived our observation period and were still
on the market three years after introduction).

In addition to performance data, we coded all new products (in
random order) based on important innovation indicators to gain in-
sight into the nature of the underlying product ideas (e.g., Lilien et
al., 2002). First, we asked the general manager of the furniture divi-
sion and the person in charge of each new product development pro-
ject to rate the products' novelty relative to competing products and
its novelty based on customer needs addressed (measured on a
10-point scale where 1=low and 10=high). Because both measures
of novelty were highly correlated for both raters (rRater 1=.52,
p b.001, rRater 2=.84, p b.001), we averaged these measures to create
a novelty index. The high correlation between raters (rBetween raters=
.51, p b.001) suggests that novelty is captured by this index in a valid
way (e.g., Franke et al., 2006). We also captured the products' strate-
gic impact on the ﬁrm's product portfolio, which we measured using
two items: the strategic importance of the product to the business
unit's future and the potential of the product to generate a new prod-
uct line (measured on a 10-point scale where 1=low and 10=high).
Because both measures were highly correlated for both raters (rRater 1=
.50, p b.01, rRater 2=.43, p b.01), we averaged them to create a strategic
impact index. The high correlation between raters (rBetween raters=.47,
p b.01) suggests that this variable captures a product's strategic impact
in a valid way.

2.2.3. Control variables

We considered the products' price and their year of market intro-
duction as control variables. We re-ran our main analysis (reported
below) and controlled for these variables in OLS regressions. As we
ﬁnd that neither price nor inter-year variations in sales, etc. account
for our ﬁndings (all reported effects remain signiﬁcant), we do not
report the resulting statistics due to space constraints (results are
available upon request).

3. Findings

To compare the market performance of user-generated and
designer-generated products, we compared the means of market per-
formance measures for both types of products and tested their statis-
tical signiﬁcance using t-tests. Given the small sample size of the user
design condition (n=6), we also performed Mann–Whitney U-tests
to assess the robustness of our results. The results indicate that both
tests lead to the same conclusions (see Table 1A).

3.1. Unit sales

In the ﬁrst year after introduction, we ﬁnd that user-generated prod-
ucts sell roughly twice as much as designer-generated products
(MUser=30,182.33, MDesigner=14,191.76, pt-testb.08). Similarly, we
ﬁnd that the distribution of the products' ﬁrst-year unit sales is signiﬁ-
cantly different between the two conditions (pM-W-U b.05). Five out of
six user-generated products are represented in the top third of the
best sellers among all 43 products (ranked 2, 4, 7, 10 and 11), and
only one user-generated product had lower unit sales than the average
designer-generated product (see Fig. 1). The results are even more pro-
nounced using aggregate sales data across three years: units of user-
generated products sold three times more frequently than designer-
generated ones (pt-testb.12; pM-W-U b.05).

3.2. Sales

First-year sales revenues of user-generated products are more than
three times higher than those of designer-generated products (MUser=
500.97 million yen, MDesigner=141.04 million yen, pt-test b.05). Similar-
ly, the distribution of sales revenues differs signiﬁcantly between the
two types of products (pM-W-U=.001). Four of the top six products, in
terms of sales, are user-generated (ranked 1, 2, 3 and 6), and the two
remaining user-generated products generated higher sales revenues
than the average designer-generated product (greater than 147.80 mil-
lion yen, see Fig. 2). Aggregate sales data across three years suggests
that the size of this effect increases over time: three years after intro-
duction, user-generated products generated an average of 1250 million
yen (approximately 16 million dollars) more in sales than designer-
generated products, which is equal to over ﬁve times the sales of
designer-generated products (pt-test b.05; pM-W-U=.001).

3.3. Gross margin

User-generated products yielded gross margins (MUser=240.47 mil-
lion yen) that were approximately four times higher than designer-
generated products (MDesigner=56.22 million yen, pt-testb.05). The dis-
tribution of gross margins is also signiﬁcantly different between the
two conditions (pM-W-U=.001). In particular, four of the top ﬁve prod-
ucts, in terms of gross margins, are user-generated products (ranked 1,
2, 3 and 5) and the remaining two user-generated products yielded
higher gross margins than the average designer-generated product
(greater than 67.90 million yen; see Fig. 3). The results are more pro-
nounced if we use three years of sales data: the average margin of
user-generated products is 619 million yen (approximately 8 million
dollars) higher, or six times greater, than designer-generated products

(pt-testb.05; pM-W-U=.001). These ﬁndings suggest that user-generated
products demonstrate stronger market performance than their
designer-generated counterparts.

Because performance should be related to survival, we additionally
analyzed how many designer- and user-generated products survived
our observation period (three years after introduction). Products that
survived performed substantially better than those which were
discontinued (e.g., ﬁrst-year unit sales were approximately 60% higher
for products that survived the third year). Indeed, only 17 out of 37
designer-generated products were still on the shelves after three years.
In contrast, ﬁve out of six user-generated products were still on the mar-
ket (pchi-square-difference-testb.09). User-generated products, therefore,
have a substantially higher survival rate at Muji.

3.4. Novelty and strategic impact

The results with regard to the nature of each new product provide
corroborating evidence for the ﬁndings reported above. In particular,
we ﬁnd that user-generated products are characterized by substan-
tially higher novelty compared to designer-generated products
(MUser=7.29, MDesigner=4.78, pt-test b.001, pM-W-U b.001). Four of
the top ﬁve products, in terms of novelty, are user-generated (ranked
1, 2, 3 and 4) and the remaining two user-generated products are
rated among the top 50% of the sample on novelty and consistently
exhibit higher novelty than the average designer-generated product
(greater than 5.90, see Fig. 4). The results for the products' strategic
impact are similar: user-generated products have a signiﬁcantly
more pronounced strategic impact on the ﬁrm's future product port-
folio than designer-generated ones (MUser=6.08, MDesigner=4.25,
pt-test=.001, pM-W-U b.01). Three of the top ﬁve products, in terms
of strategic impact, are user-generated (ranked 1, 3 and 4), and the
“worst” user-generated product has a strategic impact score (4.00)
close to the average score of designer-generated products (see Fig. 5).

3.5. Sensitivity analysis

Although we only analyzed products within a single category
(furniture), the sample consists of different products (e.g., sofa,
table, chair, bed, shelf). To assess whether different product types
within the furniture category might partially account for the ﬁndings
reported above (beyond price considerations), we re-analyzed the
data using a more homogeneous subsample of products. We matched
the six user-generated products with similar designer-generated ones
(n=15; sofa, bed, shelf). As Table 1B shows, the results remain
robust; user-generated products outperform designer-generated ones
on all dimensions.

In a second robustness check, we aimed to broaden the scope of
our analysis. In particular, we sought market performance data from
another category, namely health and beauty products. This category
has brought about four user-generated products in recent years (in
the area of natural and homeopathic remedies and skin care) where
the respective product launch was far enough in the past in order to
track aggregate performance data across three years. Table 2 shows
that user-generated products once again demonstrate better market
performance. Although we identiﬁed several other Muji categories
with user-generated products (e.g., kitchenware, stationery, garden-
ing products, and clothing), user-generated products in these catego-
ries were either too low in number (e.g., one or two products) and/or
market introduction had occurred too recently (e.g., in 2010).

4. Discussion

There is broad and growing interest in understanding the topical
phenomenon of more actively involving users in ﬁrms' idea generation
processes. Yet and despite conceptual advancements (Poetz & Schreier,
2012; Schreier et al., 2012) it is surprising that an empirical market per-
formance assessment of user-driven products (i.e., products that are
based on user- vs. designer-generated ideas) is still missing in the liter-
ature. This is most likely due to the difﬁculty of obtaining reliable mar-
ket data from real-world practice. As such, it remains unclear whether it

will pay off for ﬁrms to depart from the classic NPD paradigm anchored
in the idea that ﬁrm professionals – and not users – should generate the
ideas for new products to be marketed to broader customer segments.
By drawing on a unique data set gathered from the Japanese consumer
goods brand Muji, which has drawn on both sources of ideas in parallel
in recent years, we provide initial research to ﬁll this gap in the litera-
ture. We demonstrate that user-generated products systematically
and substantially outperform their designer-generated counterparts in
terms of key market performance metrics.

Of course, we do not see our study as the “ﬁnal battle” that would
once and for all relegate the “loser” to the history books. Rather, we
see our study as initial evidence and as a contribution to a more crit-
ical reﬂection on the dominant NPD paradigm. In a nutshell, our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that it might pay for ﬁrms to draw on user ideas in
parallel to their established in-house efforts — not unlike what Muji
seems to have identiﬁed as their best practice. Furthermore, users
were only the providers of ideas; the overall NPD process entails
many more stages, and it goes without saying that decisive in-house
efforts and capabilities are needed to convert any promising idea
into a successful new product. Bearing this in mind, we now discuss
the generalizability of our ﬁndings and identify promising directions
for future research.

First,

it is worth noting that the majority of winning user-
designers in our sample were highly involved in the category, had

enduring past exposure to the problems for which ideas were sought,
had relatively high levels of technical expertise, and thus generally
matched the conceptual description of lead users (cf. Von Hippel,
2005). Clearly, if ﬁrms are unable to activate this type of user, it is
unlikely that the effects found in this study can be replicated. The
notion of users' leading-edge status is also conceptually important.
Different types of users might account for the discrepancy between
predictions made in the classical marketing and NPD literatures, on
the one hand, and research on user innovation, on the other hand.
Whereas the former might have “average” users in mind (which
would justify skepticism about user involvement because these
users lack both technical and usage expertise), the latter typically
constructs their arguments around leading-edge users.
In other
words, conventional marketing is concerned with the “average user”
and research on user innovation targets only users with leading-
edge status who represent “extreme values” on the right-hand side
of the distribution of users.

The consequence of involving the “right” vs. “wrong” users might
loom even larger for more complex products than the ones studied in
this paper (Poetz & Schreier, 2012; Schreier et al., 2012). For complex
products (e.g., cars), the expertise required for successful ideation
might be too high, thereby preventing the vast majority of average
users from contributing meaningful ideas. On a related note, all of
the furniture themes studied were based on a clear “usage problem”
(e.g., improving the sitting experience in the living room). We argue

that such problems are well-suited for users because users have a
competitive edge over designers in terms of the needs-based infor-
mation necessary to solve the problem effectively. If, in contrast, the
theme was based on technical details regarding technologies or mate-
rials, company designers would be more likely than users to have the
skills and expertise to solve these problems. These speculations offer
promising avenues for future research.

Furthermore, the openness of contests may favor user-based ideas.
The user population that is accessed through crowdsourcing is naturally
much larger and more diverse compared with a team of designers
employed by a given ﬁrm. It follows that, if more (and more diverse)
ideas are generated, the odds of generating a few truly exceptional
ideas will increase (e.g., Gross, 1972; Schreier et al., 2012; Surowiecki,
2004; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2009). Our data from Muji support this
prediction: out of the many ideas submitted by users (ranging from
400 to more than 2000 per theme), the best user ideas outperformed
those generated by designers. Yet the relationship between the open-
ness of contests, how the contest announcement is targeted, the activa-
tion of effective self-selection mechanisms, and the ﬁnal outcome is not
well understood; thus, it constitutes fruitful ground for future research.
Interviews with managers at Muji further revealed that they have
succeeded in building the speciﬁc capability to interact with users
effectively. Nonetheless, each crowdsourcing initiative took substan-
tial time to implement, is generally less controllable and manageable
in the early stages, and it cannot easily be implemented on a large

Note that we also analyzed survival in this category. Importantly, we again ﬁnd that
only 21 out of 49 designer-generated products were still on the shelves after three
years. At the same time, however, all four user-generated products were still on the
market (pchi-square-difference-test b.05). User-generated products thus demonstrate a sub-
stantially higher survival rate. (Products that survived the three-year observation peri-
od also performed substantially better than those that were discontinued, which
conﬁrms that lower-performing products were eliminated; e.g., ﬁrst-year unit sales
were approximately 140% higher for products that survived the third year.)

scale (as reﬂected in the relatively small number of user-generated
compared with designer-generated new products). Thus, our ﬁndings
might not be easily replicated with data from “old-school” ﬁrms with
no prior experience in active user involvement. As a result, one
important, but unanswered question remains: what are the speciﬁc
capabilities that make user-driven ﬁrms successful?

Finally, it is worth noting that Muji did not actively market user
products as “designed by users” to the general public. We, therefore,
only assessed the “objective” market performance of user-driven prod-
ucts. As indicated above, however, recent research suggests that ﬁrms
might beneﬁt from a “designed by users” label over and above any
objective product characteristics (Schreier et al., 2012). To assess the
full potential of marketing user-generated products, future research
should examine this psychological effect on performance.

In conclusion, we note that further research is required to fully
understand the newly emerging paradigm of an active user involve-
ment in NPD. Our study provides important initial evidence that
such efforts might pay off.
