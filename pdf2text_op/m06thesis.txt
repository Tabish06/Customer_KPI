Abstract 

This  thesis  uses  modern  panel  data  techniques  to  analyse  a  new 
Japanese  dataset  in  an  investigation  into  the  professed  link  between 
good environmental performance and corporate returns. It also builds 
some  very  simple  models  to  further  examine  two  frequently  quoted 
drivers  of  firms’  environmental  performance,  reputation  and  eco-
efficiency. The analysis finds both theoretical rationales and empirical 
evidence that more environmentally friendly firms have higher profits. 
These  findings  are  not  general  however,  but  specific  to  particular 
industrial  sectors  and  appear  to  depend  on  the  degree  to  which 
production  is  exposed  to  consumer  pressures,  and  the  environmental 
impact  of  the  production  process  itself.  Seen  jointly,  the  theoretical 
discussion  and  empirical  findings  seem  to  imply  that  the  ability  of 
modern  panel  data  techniques  to  reduce  some  endogeneity  issues, 
makes these especially appropriate in the ‘environmental performance 
–  corporate  returns’  context. 
thesis  empirically 
investigates  an  alleged  link  between  environmental  performance  and 
managerial quality. It finds significant evidence that such a link exists 
in the sample.

Chapter 1 

Green and profitable? 

Environmental performance1 as a profit opportunity has been a hotly debated 

theme  since  Harvard  management  guru  Michael  Porter’s  momentous  1991 

article  looking  at  potential  profit  opportunities  arising  from  environmental 

legislation. Alongside this debate the last few decades have seen the rise of 

corporate  social  responsibility2  (CSR)  as  a  concept  employed  both  in 

corporate strategies, and, with the growth of socially responsible investments 

(SRI),  as  an  investment  criterion.  The  questions  discussed  in  this  thesis  are 

therefore of interest to managers3 and investors4 alike.  

 

Two much cited green success stories are the technology company 3M’s claim 

to have saved US$530 millions between 1975-1990 due to lower energy use, 

and  British  Petroleum’s  (BP)  public  relations  bonanza  following  CEO  Lord 

Browne’s  1997  speech  where  he  acknowledged  the  existence  of  climate 

change and announced the oil giant’s plan to tackle it.  

 

                                                 
1 Environmental performance and environmental management will be used interchangeably in 
what follows. 
2 Environmental management is in many ways just a sub-category of CSR. In what follows 
general references to CSR will always also imply environmental management. This might be 
somewhat confusing to the reader, but facilitates the flow of a discussion utilising the entire 
CSR/ environmental management literature. Following Portney (2005) this thesis treats CSR 
as a beyond compliance concept. 
3  Sociopolitical  issues  such  as  environmental  concerns  present  real  risks  to  the  future 
profitability  of  corporations  according  to  CEOs  surveyed  by  the  McKinsey  Quarterly  for 
January 2006. However only 18% see this as an opportunity, 41% see it as mainly a risk to 
their business.  
4 Three quarters of institutional investors surveyed by Mercer Investment Consulting (2006) 
believe  that  environmental,  social  and  governance  factors  can  be  material  to  investment 
performance. Nonetheless 72% do not include SRI factors in their investment decisions.

These two examples illustrate the complexities involved when assessing the 

potential  for  profit  opportunities  which 

lie 

in  good  environmental 

management. The former is an example of eco-efficiency5, simply related to 

improved  process  efficiency  leading  to  direct  savings  due  to  lower  costs  of 

production.  The  latter  is  entangled  in  a  more  complex  web  of  strategic 

processes  thought  to  affect  brand  value,  consumer  reputation,  and  even 

employee loyalty and recruitment (Hoffman 2001). 

 

This  thesis  attempts  to  disentangle  some  of  these  processes  and  achieve  a 

deeper understanding of the potential causal dynamics between environmental 

performance  and  profitability.  Starting  in  chapter  2  with  a  brief  literature 

review it notes that in recent studies, at least, there are signs of an emerging 

consensus that such a link exists. Then in chapter 3, looking narrowly at some 

of  the  processes  underlying  such  a  relationship,  it  seeks  to  present  a  more 

thorough  theoretical  discussion,  closing  with  three  simple  models.6  It 

concludes that theory would imply that the question is not so much whether it 

pays  to  be  green,  but  where  and  when.  The  insights  from  the  theoretical 

discussion have useful implications for the empirical modelling in chapter 4.  

 

The two empirical chapters constitute the core of the thesis, and represent the 

more important intellectual and academic contribution.  They evaluate some 

of  the  cautious  claims  made  in  the  earlier  chapters.    Chapter  4  presents  the 

                                                 
5 Eco-efficiency can be loosely defined as amount of waste produced scaled by the magnitude 
of a firm’s production.  
6  Two  of  these  models  utilise  well  known  game-theoretic  concepts  and  follow  Gibson’s 
(2003) claim that game theory has a central place in business ethics theory as it puts the issue 
of whether there can be a ‘prudential ethics front and center’ (Gibson 2003 :56).

dataset,  which  is  made  up  of  Japanese  manufacturers  drawn  from  different 

Japanese stock exchanges. It also discusses how modern panel data techniques 

can  be  applied  to  further  causally  examine  a  potential  link  between 

environmental performance and profitability. Chapter 5 reports the results of 

regressions utilising the techniques outlined in chapter 4, and analyses these, 

bearing in mind the theoretical insights from chapter 3. 

  

Overall,  the  empirical  findings  go  some  way  to  supporting  a  link  between 

good environmental management and profits within some strategically similar 

sectors  or  industries.  We  also  find  evidence  of  a  link  between  the 

environmental indicator and a variable thought to capture managerial quality. 

 

The thesis adds to the existing literature in five ways. Firstly, with the notable 

exception  of  Hoffman  (2001)  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Guenster  et  al  (2005), 

hitherto  little  attempt  has  been  made  to  explicitly  identify  and  model  the 

different  dynamics  at  play  in  any  hypothesised  relationship  between 

environmental performance and higher returns7. While in no way exhaustively 

done  here,  such  a  more  thorough  investigation  is  important  in  order  to 

understand  a  potential  relationship.  Empirical  work  without  theoretical 

foundations  is  like  building  ‘a  bridge  from  nowhere’.  In  this  thesis,  the 

insights  from  the  theoretical  chapter  highlight  potential  estimation-related 

issues which the empirical chapters then address. Moreover, a more thorough 

                                                 
7 This point is especially true for the empirical literature. The business studies literature offers 
some  good  theoretical  discussions.  Leading  authors on  the  subject  include  professor  Forest 
Reinhardt at the Harvard Business School and professor David Vogel at the Haas School of 
business at UC Berkeley.

‘theory-empirics’  approach,  when  developed  further,  might  have  important 

implications for both managers and investors.  

 

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly in terms of what is actually achieved 

here, the thesis uses modern panel data techniques in the empirical analysis. 

Such  techniques  allow  for  a  more  direct  evaluation  of  causality  and  have 

never,  to  our  knowledge,  been  used  before  in  this  context.8  Linked  to  this 

second point are two somewhat less direct contributions of the thesis. It adds 

to  the  existing  pool  of  applied  work  taking  advantage  of  some  recently 

developed  GMM  methods  for  panel  data  and  extends  the  us,  and  our 

experience  of  these,  to  a  new  area.  It  also  explores  empirically  for  the  first 

time a link between environmental performance and good management more 

generally. This link, whilst saying little of causality, has received considerable 

attention amongst asset managers in recent years. 

 

Finally whilst most empirical work on this topic so far has concerned samples 

of  large  firms9,  here,  the  empirical  analysis  employs  a  previously  unused 

indicator of environmental management with data on firms of various sizes. 

                                                 
8King  &  Lenox  (2001)  uses  a  fixed  effects  regression.  The  GMM  methods  discussed  in 
chapter 4 have, to the author’s knowledge, never been used in this context before. 
9  Or  as  noted  by  Margolis  and  Walsh  2001  (p  7)  ‘many  studies  are  based  on  exemplary, 
notorious or large firms’.

Chapter 2 

Literature Review 

This chapter examines the empirical part of the ‘environmental performance, 

economic  returns’  debate.  Chapter  3  reviews  the  theoretical  part  of  this 

literature, which then sits alongside the development of the models. 

 

The  last  decade  has  seen  an  increasingly  vibrant  debate  about  the  potential 

link  between  environmental  performance  and  corporate  returns.  While  this 

relationship  was  traditionally  held  to  be  negative  where  significant,  more 

recent  research  has  found  evidence  of  a  positive  relationship  (White  and 

Kiernan 2004).  

 

Alexander and Buckholz (1978), Porter and van der Linde (1995), and more 

recently  Guenster  et  al  (2005)  hypothesise  that  eco-efficiency  is  a  sign  of 

production efficiency and so potentially a proxy for good management, which, 

to  the  extent  it  is  true,  creates  some  interesting  causal  dynamics,  but  also 

potential  estimation  problems.  The  theoretical  and  empirical  implications  of 

this will be discussed in more detail in chapters 3, 4 and 5. 

 

Generally the literature can be divided into three broad categories, identified 

by  Wagner  and  Wehrmeryer  (2002):  (1)  event  studies  that  explore  the 

immediate  effects  of  social  or  environmental  performance  proxies  on  short-

term  stock  price  variability;  (2)  cross-sectional  regression  analyses  that 

attempt  to  establish  a  longer-term  relationship  between  environmental 

7
performance  and  stock  returns;  and  (3)  portfolio  studies  that  investigate  the 

benefits of embedding environmental management into investment decisions 

(Guenster et al 2005).  We examine the three types in turn. 

2.1 

Event studies

Event studies are interesting as they are the only studies to offer any direct 

evidence of a causal link between environmental and financial performance. 

The  focus  has  naturally  been  on  the  relationship  between  such  events  and 

stock  market  measures  of  profitability,  because  event  studies  consider  the 

immediate effects on profitability of a particular environmental event.10

 

The insights gained from event studies are strongly restricted by the fact that 

they concern themselves with very limited time horizons and therefore shed 

relatively  little  light  on  long-term,  dynamic  relationships.  Guenster  et  al 

(2005)  nonetheless  argue  that  event  studies  historically  provide  the  best 

evidence  of  a  link  between  environmental  and  financial  performance.  This 

body  of  research,  which  includes  studies  by  Shane  and  Spicer  (1983), 

Hamilton (1995), and Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), suggests that although 

environmental pollution figures generally tend to have an influence on stock 

market performance, there is also an asymmetry in stock return sensitivity to 

environmental news (Guenster et al 2005). Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) 

find,  for  example,  that  stock  price  changes  are  more  responsive  to  negative 

than  positive  news  about  a  firm’s  environmental  performance.  Casual 

evidence  seems  to  underline  the  overall  positive  findings  of  most  event 

studies. Relevant examples include the Bhopal and Exxon Valdez disasters. In

fact, Blacconiere and Patten (1994) estimate that Union Carbide lost $1 billion 

in  market  capitalization,  or  28%,  following  the  Bhopal  chemical  disaster  in 

1984.  

 

Interesting information might also be extracted from the reaction of firms to 

bad  environmental  news.  Konar  and  Cohen  (1997)  find  that  firms  with  the 

largest  stock  price  decline  on  the  day  negative  environmental  information 

became  public,  subsequently  reduced  emissions  more  than  their  industry 

peers.  Konar  and  Cohen  (1997)  see  this  as  consistent  with  the  view  that 

financial  markets  may  provide  strong  incentives  for  firms  to  change  their 

environmental behaviour. 

2.2 

Regression studies

The second category of studies, to which this thesis belongs, uses regression 

analysis  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  changes  in  environmental  performance  on 

financial or operating performance. Regression studies allow for the long term 

analysis  not  available  to  the  event  studies,  but  cannot  capture  causality  as 

easily.  Broadly  speaking,  such  studies  have  historically  been  prone  to 

endogeneity  (Vogel  2004)  and  have  overall  demonstrated  relatively  little  in 

terms of finding a clear link between environmental performance and profits. 

 

In 1978, Spicer reported that companies in the U.S. pulp and paper industry 

with better environmental performance tended to have higher profitability, a 

lower  risk  profile  and  a  higher  price/earnings  ratio.  However,  Chen  and 

Metcalf (1980) replicated Spicer’s (1978) analysis and argued that his findings 

fail to hold once controls were included for the impact of firm size. Chen and 

9
Metcalf  (1980)  and  Mahapatra  (1984)  also  fail  to  confirm  the  idea  that 

pollution control initiatives are rewarded with improved stock performance.  

 

More  recently,  apart  from  Freedman  and  Jaggi  (1998),  who  find  little 

evidence  that  there  is  an  unambiguous  relation  between  environmental 

performance  and  operating  performance,  the  results  seem  to  indicate  a 

positive link. Hart and Ahuja (1996) show that changes in pollution11 predate 

changes in operating performance including return on sales (ROS), return on 

assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Moreover, they find that firms with 

the  highest  pollution  levels  stand  the  most  to  gain.  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997) 

find  a  significant  positive  correlation  between  companies’  ROA  and 

environmental  ratings  measured  by  the Franklin  Research  and  Development 

Corporation. They also find that this relationship is more pronounced for high 

growth  industries.  Dowell et  al  (2000)  report  that  firms  that  adopt  a  single, 

stringent  environmental  standard  worldwide  have  higher  market  valuation 

than  firms  that  do  not  adopt  such  standards.  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001)  find 

evidence  that  poor  environmental  performance  has  a  significantly  negative 

effect on the intangible asset value and Tobin’s Q of U.S. S&P500 companies. 

Similarly,  King  and  Lenox  (2001)  find  evidence  of  an  association  between 

pollution reduction and increases in Tobin’s Q. Finally, Guenster et al (2005), 

in a rigorous and insightful study, use Innovest’s12 eco-efficiency ratings to 

                                                 
11 Measured as U.S. TRI emission per sales dollar 
12 Innovest Strategic Value Advisors currently has over US$1.1 billion under structured sub-
advisory  mandates  with  asset  management  partners.  They  use  information  on  company 
performance not captured or explained by traditional, accounting driven security analysis to 
create  ‘a  well-rounded  picture  of  any  hidden  risk  or  opportunity  within  a  portfolio’.  The 
Ecovalue21 index ranks the environmental performance of 90 percent of the firms by market 
capitalization  listed  on  the  S&P  500,  FTSE  350,  FTSE  Eurotop,  Nikkei,  and  MSCI  World 
(Salo 2005).For more information see www.innovestgroup.com.

provide  evidence  of  a  positive  (and  asymmetric)  relationship  between  eco-

efficiency and both Tobin’s Q and ROA.  

 

In terms of the econometrics employed,13 none of the previous studies fully 

exploit the potential of panel data to mitigate against endogeneity issues and 

hence  achieve  a  more  causal  analysis.  This  represents  a  serious  empirical 

shortage in the existing literature. 

2.3 

Portfolio studies 

Portfolio  studies  involve  a  comparison  of  average  risk-adjusted  returns 

between  two  or  more  mutually  exclusive  portfolios  (Guenster  et  al,  2005). 

The  key  message  from  these  studies  is  that  there  appears  to  be  at  least  no 

negative  association  between  environmentally  screened  universes  and  risk-

adjusted returns. 

 

Cohen  et  al  (1997)  show  findings  which  suggest  that  there  exists  neither  a 

penalty nor premium to green investments and Guerard (1997) find that the 

portfolios  derived  from  a  socially-screened  investment  universe  did  not 

perform  differently  from  those  obtained  from  an  unscreened  set  during  the 

period 1987-1996. In contrast, White (1996) reports that his green investment 

portfolio  showed  significantly  higher  risk-adjusted  returns  as  measured  by 

Jensen’s alpha14, than the overall market. Similarly, Blank and Daniel (2002) 

find  that  an  equally-weighted  eco-efficiency  enhanced  portfolio  delivered 

                                                 
13 For a critical view see Koehler (2004). 
14 Jensen’s alpha is a risk-adjusted performance measure that represents the average return on 
a  portfolio  over  and  above  that  predicted  by  the  CAPM,  given  the  portfolio's  beta  and  the 
average market return 

11
somewhat higher performance than the benchmark S&P500 during the period 

1997-2001.  Finally,  using  the  aforementioned  Innovest  ecovalue21  rating, 

Derwall  et  al  (2005),  in  an  interesting  study,  find  that  companies  labelled 

more  eco-efficient  outperformed  their  least  eco-efficient  counterparts  by 

around 6% per annum over the period  1995-2003, even after differences in 

risk, investment style and sector exposure was controlled for (Derwall et al 

2005).  Dervall  et  al  (2005)  also  find  evidence  that  corporate  environmental 

performance is incorporated slowly into a company’s stock price. This recent 

evidence  of  a  positive  relationship  between  higher  risk  adjusted  portfolio 

returns and environmental performance, is referred to by Derwall et al (2005) 

as the eco-efficiency premium puzzle15.  

 

Although the positive link story appears to have gathered strength in recent 

years, overall it seems that there is little evidence of a clear cut link between 

good  environmental  management  and  firm  profitability  to  be  found  in  the 

empirical literature. Due to differences in the time at which the research was 

conducted,  the  methods  used  and  the  data  origin,  this  might  not  be  too 

surprising. To expect a relationship to be robust across all these factors might 

be  unrealistic.  This  will  become  clearer  in  the  next  chapter  which  seeks  to  

explore  some  of  the  theoretical  reasons  for,  and  aspects  of,  any  relation 

between environmental performance and profits. 

                                                 
15 A puzzle since generally research suggests that return anomalies can best be interpreted as 
proxies  for  various  types  of  risk  (Fama  and  French  2004,  Vasselou  and  Xing  2004). 
Alternatively  they  could  stem  from  market  inefficiencies  (Haugen  and  Baker  1996; 
Lakonishok, Schleifer and Vishny 1994). A market which prices eco-efficiency with a lag is 
consistent with this latter view (Guenster et al 2005) and explains why these anomalies might 
exist in the short run.

Chapter 3 

Theoretical discussion 

‘‘The law does not say that there are to be no cakes and ale, but there are to be no cakes and 

ale except such are required for the benefit of the company…charity has no business to sit at 

boards of directors qua charity. There is, however, a kind of charitable dealing which is in the 

interest of those who practice it, and to that extent and in that garb (I admit not a very 

philanthropic garb) charity may sit at the board, but for no other purpose.’ 

Lord Bowen (1883) 

As  this  chapter  shall  show,  strategic  advantages  lie  at  the  heart  of  any 

discussion concerning a link between environmental performance and profits. 

In  a  modern  economy,  mere  environmental  compliance  is  not  enough  for  a 

company  to  distinguish  itself  from  its  competitors,  as  they  are  likely  to  be 

affected by the same regulatory requirements (Guenster et al 2005), Hart and 

Ahuja  (1996)  and  Russo  and  Foust  (1997)  therefore  posit  that  any  link 

between environmental performance and profitability must concern proactive 

environmental  governance.  Proactive  environmental  governance  involves 

structural  change  in  the  production  processes  and  innovative  management 

which lie at the core of firms’ competitive advantage (Guenster et al 2005).  It 

is hence also linked to a firm’s institutional attributes. 

 

What  might  constitute  such  strategic  advantages?  The  literature  often 

identifies the following main drivers of corporate environmental performance

Agency 2004; Guenster et al 2005)

At  a  different  level,  Per  Just  Skaret20  (2005)  mentions  investors  as  the 

ultimate  driver  of  environmental  performance.  As  Konar  and  Cohen  (1997) 

showed  empirically,  the  ability  of  the  market  to  influence  corporate 

environmental responses can be considerable. 

 

Portney (2005), reviewing the extensive literature on the topic, laments that 

none of the studies derive testable hypotheses from theoretical models of the 

firm. He is correct to the extent that the theorising and the testing has tended 

to be rather un-integrated in the literature21. This chapter will not placate him 

— we do not attempt to develop an all-inclusive model of the firm to test the 

existence of any such relationships. However, what we do examine, in greater 
                                                 
16  Attentiveness  to  regulatory  and  consumer  developments  might  reduce  future  compliance 
costs and provide firms with first mover advantages. 
17 Swiss Re, for example, actively approaches individual clients to voice its concerns about 
carbon  risk  management  issues  (World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development 
(WBCSD)  2006).  The  risk  point  is  linked  to  the  attentiveness  to  regulatory  and  consumer 
developments point, but might also lead to more appropriate risk management of all business 
concerns through enhanced foresight and flexibility. This point will be implicitly returned to 
in this chapter which discusses environmental efficiency as a proxy for good management. 
18  Good  environmental  performance  might  be  a  selling  point  to  attract  better  qualified 
employees, and make existing employees more motivated and loyal. 
19 A good example is Toyota who with its Prius hybrid car has managed to exploit a niche in 
the emerging market for green vehicles.

ventures. 
21  The  empirical  literature  discussed  in  the  last  chapter  obviously  builds  on  theoretical 
literature  and  hypothesis  to  some  degree.  Guenster  et  al  (2005)  explicitly  use  empirical 
models  to  investigate  theoretical  hypothesises.  This  chapter  will  show  that  there  is 
considerable  theoretical  writing  on  the  topic,  and  highlight  how  a  more  direct  use  of  this 
might benefit the empirical analysis.

depth,  are  the  factors  that  drive  corporate  environmental  performance. 

Focussing  particularly  on  reputation  and  eco-efficiency  drivers,  this  chapter 

attempts  to  achieve  a  fuller  view  of  the  potential  linkages  between 

environmental performance and profitability. The choice to look at reputation 

and eco-efficiency specifically is based on the fact that these drivers seemed 

best suited to also be approached in the empirical analysis. They are also the 

two most widely cited drivers of firms’ environmental performance.22

 

Overall  this  chapter  will  show  that  whilst,  theoretically,  a  link  between 

environmental performance and profitability may well exist, the extents of any 

such  link  depend  on  a  variety  of  strategic  factors.  The  link  is,  for  example, 

likely to be heterogeneous across firms. The chapter will also highlight some 

potentially  confusing  causal  dynamics 

representing  some  empirical 

challenges. 

 

The  entire  body  of  research  looking  at  the  environmental  performance  and 

profitability debate can be regarded as a subset of the wider CSR literature23.  

Indeed,  analysing  more  general  insights  from  that  literature  are  helpful  in 

framing  our  subsequent  analysis.  The  CSR-profitability  relationship  is  still 

widely  debated  (Guenster  et  al  2005)  and  much  like  the  more  narrow 

                                                 
22  In  addition  to  this,  Christine  Meisingseth  (2005),  head  of  environmental  screening  at 
Storebrand,  a  Norwegian  bank  and  pension  fund,    suggests  that  some  of  the  other  drivers 
mentioned  above,  with  the  exception  of  risk  management  might  have  been  ‘discovered’  as 
good  ways  to  ex  post  rationalise  environmental  investments.  Storebrand  is  one  of  8  global 
members  of  the  WBCSD  behind  From  challenge  to  opportunity,  a  recent  report  on 
environmental management.   
23  Environmental  management  stands  apart  from  general  CSR  due  to  its  potential  to  have 
direct  effects  on  profits  through  efficiency  improvements.  Other  arguments  in  favour  of 
environmental management are also applicable to the broader CSR context.

environmental case, 25 years of empirical research has been conducted in the 

absence  of  an  adequate  theoretical  synthesis  (Griffin  and  Mahon  1997). 

Before  developing  three  simple  models  to  analyse  reputation  and  eco-

efficiency drivers, in what follows we first provide an overview of the CSR 

literature.  Sections 3.1 through to 3.4 hence concern the CSR debate, starting 

in  section  3.1  with  Milton  Friedman’s  view  of  the  social  responsibility  of 

business. In section 3.2 we compare the Friedmanian view with more recent 

literature and highlight some challenges as well as opportunities presented by 

endorsing more CSR informed firm objectives. Section 3.3 and 3.4 look at the 

more  institutional  aspects  of  CSR  and  also  presents  for  the  first  time  a 

hypothesis  that  CSR/  environmental  management  might  proxy  good  overall 

management. This is a fundamental hypothesis which if true has implications 

for the empirical analysis. 

 

Sections 3.5 through to 3.8 discuss three models looking at the reputation and 

eco-efficiency  rationale  for  improving  environmental  performance.  Section 

3.9  concludes  this  chapter  and  identifies  some  implications  which  the 

empirical chapters will have to consider. 

3.1   Milton Friedman and the social responsibility of business 

‘When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the social responsibility of business in a 

free enterprise system, I am reminded of the wonderful line about the Frenchman who 

discovered at 70 that he had been speaking prose all his life’ 

The last decade has seen the rise of CSR reporting by most listed companies, 

published with or alongside the annual report. Concepts such as sustainable, 

Milton Friedman (1972) 

16
‘closed loop’ production and ‘triple bottom line’ reporting24 (Elkington 1997) 

now feature prominently on most large industrial corporations’ websites and 

other public relations playgrounds. Although there is strong reason to expect 

this  to  be  at  least  partly  window-dressing,  firms  appear  to  be  becoming 

greener, and being green is now a part of (and increasingly central to) most 

corporations’ strategies (KPMG 2005).  

 

If CSR is a buzzword in today’s corporate world, to academia the concept is 

not  new.  Theories  about  the  role  of  ethics  and  altruism  in  business 

relationships can be traced back to Max Weber (1915), who concluded that 

religion  was  one  of  the  determinants  of  business  ethics.25  There  might 

however be considerable theoretical problems associated with assuming, like 

former Harvard business scholar Ira Jackson, that we are about to enter an era 

of capitalism with ‘a conscience’.26  

   

Evident from the quote introducing this chapter, one counterargument to the 

‘scrupulous capitalism’ claim is simply legal. As argued by Joel Bakan (2004) 

in his book The Corporation, in most countries a corporation is bound by law 

to  act  in  the  interest  of  its  shareholders.  In  other  words,  CSR  that  does  not 

increase private profits is unlawful. Elhauge (2005) offers a slightly different 

view when he notes that while a manager’s discretion is bounded by legal and 

market constraints, the law gives managers considerable discretion to sacrifice 

                                                 
24 Elkington (1997) argues that in the dynamic context of the 21st century economy a firm will 
need to take into account performance by profit, environmental quality and social justice shall 
it survive and prosper. 
25 “Zu den Determinanten der Wirtschaftsethik gehört als eine – wohlgemerkt: nur eine – auch 
die religiöse Bestimmtheit der Lebensführung” Weber (1915 : 85) 
26 See Bakan (2004) for more details. 

17
profits for public interest.27 This is primarily because minimising total agency 

costs gives managers a ‘business judgement rule deference’. 

 

Economically, it is clear that some sort of maximisation of shareholder wealth 

is needed for allocative efficiency.  In the absence of this, as already noted by 

Adam Smith (1776), company directors cannot be trusted to apply the same 

anxious vigilance to manage other people’s money as they can with their own. 

Milton Friedman (1970) argues along the same lines in his article The Social 

Responsibility of Business. In his view, in a free enterprise, private property 

system, a corporate executive is an agent of the owners of that business. His 

aim  is  to  make  as  much  money  as  possible  whilst  conforming  to  the  basic 

rules of society (Friedman 1970)28. This business manager can privately have 

a social conscience, but to act according to this in his business dealings would 

be using other people’s money.  Somebody, be it the shareholders, employees 

or  customers  would  have  to  pay  the  price  of  the  social  responsibility 

(Friedman  1970).  From  this  point  of  view,  CSR,  when  not  used  as  another 

way to increase or sustain profits, becomes morally complex29. In some ways, 

however, Friedman meets Weber when he mentions that there will be some, 

formal  or  informal,  rules  of  societal  behaviour  by  which  a  corporation  is 

morally constrained.  

 

                                                 
27 Elhauge’s comment concerns U.S. laws. 
28 Incidentally this view is shared by the radical professor and prominent social critic Noam 
Chomsky, Friedman’s great intellectual and ideological adversary (Bakan 2004). 
29 In fact Friedman (1970) uses the word immoral, and both philosophically and politically it 
is hard to justify a manager’s discretion to spend what are essentially other people’s resources 
on what might be honourable, yet still, personal and subjective social goals.   

18
Together with the obvious, but often neglected, fact that Friedman does not 

say that profitable CSR opportunities should not be exploited, this latter part 

of Friedman’s thesis is worth noting. Different social contexts will give rise to 

different CSRs.  

3.2       Is Friedman right?30 The stakeholders v profit maximisers debate 

A first direct argument in favour of the stakeholder perspective was laid out 

by Dodd (1932) who asserted that company directors must become trustees of 

the  entire  society31.  Grayson  and  Hodges  (2005)  note  that  a  few  significant 

international corporations have discovered the fact that the same forces that 

raise  stakeholder  expectations  of  environmental  behaviour  are  also  creating 

new opportunities for business strategies, and they refer to this as corporate 

social opportunity (CSO).32 The CSO concept of Grayson and Hodges (2005) 

goes to the core of the question discussed here. Stakeholder theory, as stated 

by amongst others Freeman (1984) and Clarkson (1995) argue that a manager 

should  take  the  interests  of  all  a  firm’s  stakeholders  into  account  in  his 

decision  making.  Such  stakeholders  are  often  thought  to  include  financial 

claimants,  employees,  customers,  communities,  governmental  officials  and 

the  environment  (Jensen  2001).    Following  this,  Tirole  (2001)  proposes  a 

definition of corporate governance as ‘the design of institutions that induce or 

force management to internalise the welfare of stakeholders’ (Tirole 2001 : 4). 
                                                 
30 A McKinsey Quarterly (2006) report of global business leaders show that only 16% support 
the Friedmanian ‘focus solely on shareholder return’ view, with 84% saying their aim is to 
generate  high  returns  to  investors  but  balance  this  with  contributions  to  the  broader  public 
good.  
31 As social contexts go it is interesting to note that the emergence of these sorts of arguments 
coincide with the experiences of the great depression, and the tremendous social conundrums 
of the inter-war years. 
32  DuPont for example plans to reduce its CO2 emissions by 65% from its 1990 levels (Brown 
2001).  This  is  quite  clearly  not  done  in  order  to  go  out  of  business  (although  that  would 
certainly achieve the goal!) 

19
This is not simple however. Tirole (2001) notes that managerial performance 

becomes  noisier  when  the  manager  pursues  many  tasks,  and  that  CSR 

therefore  is  likely  to  be  costly33.  Holmström  and  Milgrom’s  (1991)  more 

general multitask explicit incentives theory has shown how designing pay that 

is sensitive to the performance of a single task leads to the other tasks being 

neglected. Tirole (2001), whilst he recognises the arguments in favour of the 

stakeholder approach, due to the problem of defining focussed objectives for 

managers,  therefore  concludes  that  maximisation  of  shareholder  wealth 

provides an attainable second-best. Jensen (2001) goes further and argues that 

the stakeholder approach to management is fundamentally flawed34 due to the 

fact that the there is no good mechanism to decide how to make the necessary 

trade-offs  between  each  stakeholder  objective’s  importance.  Consequently, 

Jensen  (2001)  returns  to  Friedman  and  argues  that  since,  in  the  absence  of 

weights  to  reduce  dimensionality,  it  is  logically  impossible  to  maximise  in 

more  than  one  dimension,  the  corporate  objective  function  should  be  single 

valued,  and  the  object  to  maximise  should  be  long  term  profits35  (Jensen 

2001).  Noting  however,  like  Carrol  (1991)  with  his  ‘pyramid  of  social 

responsibility’  that  being  profitable  is  the  foundation  upon  which  all  other 

social responsibilities rest, he goes on to argue that a firm cannot maximise 

profits if it ignores its stakeholders.  

                                                 
33Tirole (2001) interestingly notes that Japan is traditionally sympathetic to the stakeholder 
society, and this has produced a legal, regulatory and fiscal environment which is assessed by 
most economists as creating weaker governance systems than the Anglo-Saxon equivalents 
(Tirole 2001) 
34  For  a  good  summary  of  the  debate  on  what  should  constitute  the  corporate  objective 
function see Sundaram and Inkpen (2004) 
35 This point is also repeated by the WBCSD (2006) who conclude “Simply by adding the 
word long-term to shareholder value, we embrace everything necessary for the survival and 
success of the company. (WBCSD 2006 : 8) 
 

20
The  debate  about  what  should  constitute  the  corporate  objective  function  is 

hence  often  falsely  presented  as  stockholders  versus  stakeholders,  when  the 

two  are  in  reality  intimately  linked  (Jensen  2001).  What  is  needed,  Jensen 

(2001) argues, is enlightened profit maximisation, where managers and other 

participants in an organisation think more generally and creatively about how 

‘the organisation’s policies treat all the important constituencies of the firm’ 

(Jensen 2001 : 13). In order to do this stakeholder theory has a role, but not as 

an objective framework in its own right.  As will be clear below, in terms of 

adding to returns, it might be more important as a cognitive framework. 

3.3 

The importance of institutional learning and the implications of                   

enlightened profit maximisation.  

How  best  to  ensure  that  enlightened  profit  maximisation  is  achieved  is 

therefore  the  question  that  should  be  addressed.  As  with  other  potentially 

profitable opportunities, which investments that appear worth making will be 

affected  by  a  firm’s  institutional  character,  for  example  its  management 

structure. 

 

Theory suggests that search costs and expectations (Arrow 1974; Jensen 1982) 

could  prevent  managers  from  identifying,  let  alone  exploiting,  profitable 

environmental  opportunities  (King  and  Lenox  2001).  In  other  words,  if 

managers’ a priori expectation is that pollution prevention is costly, then they 

are less likely to devote time and energy on investigating pollution prevention 

technologies.  Approaching  this  topic  directly,  Bleischwitz  (2003)  highlights 

the  role  played  by  cognition  and  institutions  in  the  adaptation  of  green 

21
technologies by firms. Eco-efficiency and new system design, he argues, rely 

on the creativity of the human mind and the ability of institutions to evolve 

over 

time.  Following 

the  arguments  of  Douglas  North  (1990) 

that 

technological change depends on the interaction and creation of a variety of 

institutions he concludes that path dependencies will matter. If one does not 

realise the cognitive and institutional dimensions of eco-efficiency decisions, 

costs of changing from one path to another will become higher. This claim can 

be  substantiated  by  research  which  shows  that  the  biggest  barrier  to  the 

adaptation of greener technologies is not the knowledge of these technologies 

as such, but the absence of an appropriate management structure, the lack of a 

defined ‘environmental decision-maker institution’ (ICF Consulting 2003). In 

a less theoretical language than Bleischwitz (2003), Blank and Daniel (2002) 

argue that eco-efficiency is an indicator of the likelihood that a firm might rise 

above  unknown  challenges36,  particularly  those  which  are  complex  and 

interdisciplinary.  From  this  point  of  view,  eco-efficiency  can  be  seen  as  a 

proxy  for  deeper  firm  specific  institutional  attributes.    The  empirical 

implications of this will become clear in chapter 4. 

3.4   A story of missed opportunities? 

Some economic models assume that firms are so well run that benefits from 

green strategies should not exist. The world is a dynamic place however, and 

more  so,  in  reality  few  firms  are  well  run:  they  operate  below  the  level  of 

                                                 
36  Goldman  Sachs  (2005)  notes  that  the  companies  with  the  best  potential  for  creating 
significant value are those that have the most strategic options available to embrace a low-
carbon world. 

22
optimum efficiency (Vogel 2004)37. Since potential environmental gains are 

often perceived as future benefits which cannot be part of current revenues, 

cognition might ‘misfilter’ information on eco-efficiency (Bleischwitz 2002). 

Lovins  et  al  (1999)  argue  this  point  when  they  conclude  that  rather  than 

trading  off  costs  and  benefits  of  one  eco-efficiency  improving  investment, 

‘whole system thinking’, looking at effects on the entire system of production, 

is  needed  for  all  profitable  eco-efficiency  solutions  to  be  exploited  in  an 

economy38.  Vogel  (2005)  argues  that  because  managers  are  invariably 

myopic,  environmental  profit  opportunities  might  be  missed  until  managers 

get focussed on issues outside their managerial conventions.   

 

The  implications  of  some  of  these  last  points  are  returned  to  in  section  3.8 

with a simple model of eco-efficiency investments.  

3.5 

Consumers, and the social responsibility of business  

Individual  consumers  are  the  ultimate  decision  makers  of  the  free  market 

economy.  They  can  ‘vote  with  their  feet’  to  attain  socially beneficial  goals. 

The  much  cited 

reputation  argument 

for  enhancing  environmental 

performance shows that this sort of interaction is not complete utopia. Nor is it 

necessarily  unwarranted  from  an  economic  point  of  view.  When  it  is 

impossible to internalise all externalities, first-best levels of social efficiency 

are unattainable. There might therefore be room for consumer involvements to 

move productive outcomes in the first-best direction. The direct internalisation 

                                                 
37 McKinsey (2006) report that 41% of global CEOs see significant room for improvement in 
how they manage socio-political issues. 
38 For example they claim that 18 distinct economic benefits can be derived from investing in 
modern  daylight  adjusting  electric  dimmers  of  fluorescent  lights  to  replace  old  fashioned 
manual ones. 

23
of  externalities  by  consumers  —  potentially  reflected  by  buying  patterns  or 

pressure on firms — does not affect the profit maximisation objective, and in 

some  ways  combine  the  potentials  of  both  democracy  and  the  free  market 

economy39.  However  the  ability  of  consumers  to  affect  environmental 

performance outcomes depends crucially on the assumptions we make of their 

ability  and  willingness  to  sustain  pressure  on  firms.  Reinhardt  (1999) 

concludes  that  there  is  a  lot  of  scope  for  future  research  into  consumers’ 

willingness  to  pay  for  environmental  quality  in  different  sectors.  A  very 

simple analysis into some of the effects affecting consumers’ willingness to 

pay is attempted in the following. Model 1 approaches firms’ ability to take 

advantage  of  asymmetric  information  relating  to  their  ‘true’  environmental 

performance  by  falsely  pretending  to  be  green.  Model  2  is  a  coordination 

related model, showing how, since beyond the eco-efficiency argument, green 

products  might  cost  more,  individual  consumers  might  decide  not  to  buy 

green, even when, overall, the social benefits outweigh the costs. The models 

have in common that they show how, in many instances, a latent market for 

green products (and so a green profit opportunity) might fail to materialise.   

Both models are extremely simple and apply well-known economic concepts, 

but nevertheless provide a useful, light formalisation of the relevant issues. 

3.6  Model 1: Asymmetric information and window -dressing 

‘Dishonest dealings tend to drive honest dealings out of the market’ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Akerlof (1970) 

The quote by Akerlof (1970) refers directly to markets where goods have                   

                                                 
39 A version of this argument is recently put forward by Heal (2005) who sees CSR primarily 
as a response to market failure. 

24
credence  attributes  (Cole  and  Harris  2003).  This  certainly  applies  in  the 

context  of  environmental  attributes:  how  is  a  consumer  to  know  all  the 

environmental  aspects  of  a  good’s  production?  The  model  that  follows  is  a 

very simple formal representation of some the processes referred to by Erdem 

et al (1999) when they argue: ‘It is clear that brand equity accrues over time 

via consumer learning and decision making processes. Thus, there is a need to 

know  how  consumer  learning  and  choice  processes  shape  and  drive  brand 

equity  formation’40  (Erdem  et  al  1999  :  302).  Signalling  is  an  important 

observed way in which producers seek to capture a ‘latent’ market in green 

products.  At  the  same  time  Bougherara  and  Grolleau  (2002)  argue  that 

information overload can create market failure41. 

 

Big  corporations  spend  increasing  efforts  on  publishing  environmental 

reports. Generally, the only audit performed on CSR reports is an assurance 

statement.  These  are  written  by  consulting  firms,  and  increasingly  by  the 

accounting firms auditing other parts of a corporation’s business.42 It is clear 

that, in the absence of stricter frameworks on this type of corporate auditing, 

an incentive to window-dress exists. This point is of interest to the empirical 

part  of  this  thesis  because  the  Nikkei  environmental  management  survey 

which we later employ as our environmental performance indicator is  

questionnaire based, and as such might be prone to window-dressing, thus 

                                                 
40  Erdem  et  al  (1999)  develops  different  approaches  to  this  and  draws  on  cognitive 
psychology and behavioural economics in their analysis. Whilst their analysis is much more 
detailed than what is presented below, they do not directly look at the asymmetric information 
aspects addressed here. 
41Bougherara  and  Grolleau  (2002)  provide  a  good  theoretical  discussion  into  some  of  the 
issues  modelled  here  in  their  article  Could  Eco-labeling  Mitigate  Market  Failures?  An 
Analysis Applied to Agrofood Products. 
42 Ernst &Young prepared BPs assurance statement in 2003 (The Economist, 4th Nov, 2004) 

25
obscuring any link between environmental performance and returns.43

 

Grayson  and  Hodges  (2005)  quote  evidence  that  business  is  facing  a  trust 

crisis. According to the 2003 MORI Trust Monitor 60% of British adults do 

not  expect  business  leaders  to  tell  the  truth,  and  only  25%  believe  that  the 

profits of large companies will make things better for everyone who uses their 

products  and  services  (Grayson  and  Hodges  2005).  Globally,  48%  of  the 

public have little or no trust in big corporations, with another 38% having only 

some trust (Grayson and Hodges 2004). More specifically, it can be very hard 

for consumers to judge whether a firm which signals its green credentials is 

truthful or not. Eco-labelling44 is primarily such a communication mechanism 

between producers and final consumers (Cole and Harris 2003). Nonetheless, 

Comras (2005) quotes a Wall Street Journal Article describing eco-labelling 

as ‘a swampy mess of competing acronyms and conflicting claims’. A number 

of  eco-labels  are  actually  industry  fronts,  and  in  this  way  not  independent 

ratings at all. One US example is the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), a 

screen for sustainable lumber that is really made up of a consortium of timber 

companies  (Comras  2005).  This  is  what  West  (1995)  has  in  mind  when  he 

argues  that  voluntary  eco-labelling  schemes  are  rapidly  degenerating  into  a 

means  whereby  an  industry  can  set  the  standard  it  likes.  In  our  context,  it 

                                                 
43 But so too will be other approaches to environmental performance measuring. As Reinhardt 
(2005)  argues  using  content  analysis  of  annual  reports  risk  conflating  environmental 
performance with environmental rhetoric, or ,in other words, window-dressing. 
44  While  the  treatment  is  different  (and  necessarily  more  simplistic)  in  what  follows  good 
examples of modelling the dynamics of eco-label adoption include Arora and Gangopadhyay 
(1995), Swallow and Sedjo (2000), and Amacher et al (2003). The former article interestingly 
provide  a  theoretical  rationale  for  over-compliance,  in  markets  where  consumers  value 
environmental quality. 
 

26
seems  clear  that  distrust  in  firms’  environmental  signals  will  affect  the 

reputation rationale for being green. 

 

Bougherara  and  Grolleau  (2002)  provide  ample  evidence  from  the  food 

market  that  large  segments  of  consumers  are  willing  to  pay  more  for 

environmentally superior goods. Loureiro et al (2002) looking at the market 

for  green  products,  conclude  that  consumer  disbelief  reduces  consumers’ 

willingness  to  pay,  and  so  covering  the  higher  costs  of  green  production 

becomes  harder45.  Finally,  Bjørner  et  al  (2004)  in  a  uniquely  thorough 

empirical  investigation  into  the  effects  of  eco-labelling  find  that  the  Nordic 

Swan label has had a significant effect on consumers’ brand choices for toilet 

paper,  corresponding  to  a  marginal  willingness  to  pay  for  the  certified 

environmental label of 13–18% of the price46. 

 

To  begin  the  model,  consider  a  firm  which  can  invest  to  make  its  product 

greener. The investment carries a cost f but also means that the producer can 

sell its good at a higher price than before:  pg>p. Therefore a firm will carry 

out the investment so long as

gp

−

f

>

p

. However, a firm can window-dress 

and ‘fool’ consumers by investing in a signal at a cost ε. Such a signal might 

for example be an eco-label intended to make the consumer believe a firm’s 
                                                 
45 For an opposing view, see Vogel (2005) who argues that in the US at least, few consumers 
appear to be willing to pay a premium for green goods, unless there are direct benefits, such 
as for organic food. Evidence from Japan however supports Bougherara and Grolleau (2002). 
According to a report produced by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry 
(METI), the proportion of Japanese people who consider environmental impacts of products 
in their shopping increased from 66% in 1997 to 75% in 2001. Moreover, according to the 
study, 7.5% of respondents will pay for eco-friendly products even though they are more 
expensive, and 26.2% of them will probably pay for them (METI 2003). 
46 The empirical results produced by Bjørner et al (2004) stem from one specific, notoriously 
successful  eco-labelling  environment.  Its  main  implication  is  not  its  lack  of  generality 
however, but the fact that it offers empirical proof that eco-labelling can work.

such that benefits outweigh costs, and window-dressing is unprofitable. 

 

Now  consider  a  dynamic47  setting  where  consumers  slowly  manage  to 

mitigate  the  information  problem  described  above48.  Assume  that  this 

‘learning process’ is reflected by an exponential decrease in the probability, α, 

that  a  consumer  will  buy  from  a  ‘window-dresser’,49  where  α(t)  =  (1-μn-t) 

and

It is clear that in the repeated case, this model limits the incentives to window-

dress due to the negative impact on future sales. The credibility of the signal is 

improved.  Whether  the  future  discounted  profits  from  actually  making  the 

investment  outweigh  those  of  window-dressing  is  here  dependent  on  the 

relative  difference  f-ε,  and  the  amount  of  new  information  gathered  per 

 

                                                
47 Shapiro (1982) shows how with consumer learning, there is an incentive to produce high 
quality that does not exist in a static, adverse selection story. The reason is that high quality 
today increases demand tomorrow. This is the fundamental idea of the analysis in this section. 
48  Helped  by  for  example  media  scrutiny,  environmental  events,  corporate  whistle-blowers 
and government watchdogs. 
49 This in a very simplistic way follows Schmalensee’s (1978) idea that quality is positively 
related to repeat purchase. It has been criticised by Shapiro (1982) as not based on rational 
consumer decision making. It illustrates the points made here well however. 

28
period50.  Window-dressing  becomes  likely  when  the  costs  of  making  the 

investment are small relative to the costs of window-dressing, and where the 

chances of being caught are high. This makes intuitive sense and illustrates 

both the need for clear and regulated eco-labels and government watchdogs, 

as well as a good regulatory environmental reporting framework in general.51 

This will both directly increase the costs of window-dressing, and reduce the 

future benefits from window-dressing52.  

 

There  is  potentially  a  bit  more  to  this  story.  If  consumers  appreciate  the 

potential  for  window-dressing,  even  if  they  experience  higher  utility  from 

buying  environmental  goods,  they  might,  due  to  the  initial  information 

asymmetries, decide not to buy a seemingly environmental good. The long run 

forces  favouring  truthfulness  discussed  above,  might  never  be  brought  into 

play. Again, the market for green products collapses. To paraphrase Akerlof 

(1970),  only  environmental  lemons  are  produced.  The  problem  is  that  the 

signal 

is  unreliable.53  Signalling  might  not  mitigate 

the  asymmetric 

information problem, but exacerbate it.54 As an example of this, the German 

                                                 
50  As  Shapiro  (1982)  argues  the  extent  to  which  information  asymmetries  create  quality 
deterioration depends crucially on the speed at which learning occurs. 
51 The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) -14000 certification will capture 
some elements of a firms’ environmental performance. The ISO-14000 series of international 
standards have been developed to integrate environmental aspects into operations and product 
standards.  Guenster  et  al  (2005)  report  that  several  governments  are  considering  the 
introduction of corporate reporting standards aimed at increasing transparency. 
52  Vogel  (2005)  argues  that  especially  in  Northern  Europe  due  to  better  quasi-public  eco-
labelling schemes consumers seem more ready to pay a premium for green goods, at least for 
a number of visible products, notably chlorine free paper. 
53 As already noted by Wilson (1979) the conditions for effective signalling might not always 
be satisfied. 
54  In  Akerlof’s  second  hand  car  market  this  is  famously  solved  by  the  introduction  of  a 
different  signal  (i.e.  a  warranty)  which  works  because  it  is  costly  for  the  providers  of  the 
inferior  cars  and  cheap  for  the  providers  of  high  quality  cars.  The  somewhat  unrealistic 
analogy  might  be  an  eco-label  that  promised  money  back  x  10  if  the  company  had 
accreditation removed, or a strict regulation regime which included fines. 

29
Federal  Environment  Agency  in  a  2002  report  conclude  that  competition 

between  eco-labels  and  other  impulses  for  attention  can  provoke  market 

failure.  

 

To extend our highly simplistic model by one further step, now assume that 

consumers decide whether or not to buy the good based on their beliefs of the 

average  chance  of  being  ‘fooled’.  The  model  is  now  essentially  a  textbook 

‘beer-quiche’ 

(Gibbons  2002) 

type 

representation  of  consumer-firm 

interaction. The firm is faced with a decision on whether or not to make an 

environmental performance investment. The investment carries a cost of f but 

will generate benefits of 2 if the new, greener product is sold to a consumer. 

Without the investment a sale of the original product generates a payoff of 1 

to  the  firm.  A  firm  which  decides  not  to  make  the  investment  then  faces  a 

choice on whether to invest in an environmental signal meant to persuade the 

consumer that it has made the investment. This signal will carry a cost of ε to 

the firm, and this cost can be interpreted as the ease with which a firm can 

cheat the consumers. Signalling carries no additional cost to a firm that has 

made the investment. Information about the firm’s environmental investment 

decision is a priori hard to get hold of for the consumer, but she believes a 

firm to have made the investment and thus to be selling green products, with a 

probability p.  The consumer can choose whether or not to trade with the firm 

after  she  has  observed  the  firm’s  environmental  signalling.  The  consumer 

cares  about  price  and  environmental  quality.  She  is  indifferent  between 

buying a less expensive non-green good and a more expensive green good, but 

30
dislikes paying more for inferior quality. The game’s payoffs are illustrated 

below.  

(Figure 3.1) A signalling model of window dressing 

 

Is a separating equilibrium, where a firm either invests or not and signals this 

truthfully, possible here?  If a firm signals ‘not green’ then a consumer will 

always  buy  the  good  and  both  firm  and  consumer  gain  a  payoff  of  1.  If 

however a firm signals ‘green’, not knowing whether this is true or not, the 

consumer will base its decision on whether to buy or not on her initial belief 

about p. For a consumer to buy we need (1)

p

(1
+ −

p

)( 1)

− ≥ ∴ ≥ ½. If p is 

p

0

less than ½, consumers will not buy a green product. Firms have no incentive 

to ever make the green investment or even to signal to be green and will pool 

on  not  making  the  investment  and  report  this  truthfully  since 

1ε− < .  Our 

candidate perfect Bayesian separating equilibrium (and with it our market for 

environmental goods) collapses. Only pooling on not making the investment 

is sustainable.  

 

If p> ½ however, and f>ε>1, then this pooling equilibrium collapses, as there 

is an incentive on the firm to deviate and signal ‘green’. It is crucial to note, 

though, that in this model, so long as f>ε and this is known to the consumer, 

31
she  should  believe  p,  the  probability  a  firm  is  really  green,  to  be  0  and  so 

never  buy  from  a  green  firm.  It  follows  that  this  candidate  equilibrium 

collapses too.  The only stable equilibrium in this model is hence the one with 

no environmental investments.  

 

What are the implications of the model above to the question discussed in this 

thesis?  It  shows  that  for  a  market  to  exist  in  green  goods,  the  incentive  to 

window-dress  needs  to  be  eliminated,  and  that  this  must  be  appreciated  by 

consumers.  The  crucial  point  to  note  more  generally  is  that  even  when 

consumers  value  environmentally  friendly  products,  any  returns  to  good 

environmental management are susceptible to the assumptions we make about 

trust and information asymmetries in the market55.  It highlights the fragility 

of one of the most cited rationales for ‘going green’, reputation, and it shows 

how different sectors might be affected in different ways depending on their 

informational transparency. 

 

A further extension lends itself easily to the model. As noted by Holmstrom 

and Tirole (1993), financial markets provide us with measures of managerial 

performance that cannot be directly extracted from accounting data. Changing 

consumer for investor in the asymmetric information story one can see how 

the markets’ valuation of a firms’ environmental performance might easily be 

affected by informational asymmetries. Erdem and Swait (1998) conclude that 

consumer-based brand equity is the value of a brand as a credible signal of a 

                                                 
55  Interestingly  McKinsey  Quarterly  (2006)  report  that  35%  of  global  CEOs  view 
transparency rather than media-public relations as most effective in terms of getting a socio-
political message across.  

32
product's  position.  Now,  with 

firms  producing  potentially 

flawed 

environmental reports due to the absence of a common regulatory framework, 

investors  may  decide  to  ignore  or  place  less  importance  on  the  information 

given  in  such  reports.  Consequently,  environmental  friendliness  would  not 

affect the market valuation of the firm56.   

3.7  Model 2: Benign self-interest: A coordination problems model 

Gibson (2003) uses the iterated prisoners’ dilemma as a good example on how 

businesses can learn to act with benign self-interest. Here we examine another 

textbook  formalisation  of  the  potential  of  consumer  coordination  to  obtain 

Pareto improving environmental management outcomes. Consider a standard 

prisoner’s dilemma situation with two consumers. The consumer can purchase 

green or dirty products. There is an externality — each one agent’s action will 

affect the other agent’s payoff. The payoff matrix could look something like 

the following.

56 This lends some support to an inefficient market explanation to the anomaly reported in the 
portfolio studies. A recent report developed by global asset managers for the UN concludes 
that  financial  analysis  is  obstructed  by  the  lack  of  good  environmental  and  CSR  reporting 
(UNEP Finance Initiative 2004).  

33
means  that  you  pay  less  for  the  good  whilst  still  benefit  from  your  benign 

fellow  citizens.  The  potentially  Pareto  optimal  equilibrium  collapses  and 

[dirty, dirty] is left as the only possible Nash equilibrium. From the point of 

view of the consumers, theirs is a problem of coordination. From the point of 

view of the producer – again the market for green products collapses. 

 

In the simple example above, it was enough that one agent bought the green 

product,  for  the  positive  externalities  to  be  felt.  Now  consider  a  world  of  n 

identical consumers. There is one strategic input per consumer,

ig

, how much 

extra they are willing to pay for green products, with 

ig

. Suppose the

we can

This shows that at the optimum the marginal utility consumer i derives from 

all  other  consumers  expenditures  on  ‘greeness’  must  equal  1,  and  in 

equilibrium  everybody  chooses  a  g*  which  ensures  this  outcome.  Is  this 

equilibrium unique and Pareto optimal? As demonstrated by Cooper and John 

                                                 
57 Symmetric games can have asymmetric equilibria but this does not apply here. 

34
(1988)  strategic  complementarities  are  needed  for  multiple  SNE.  Positive 

spillovers are needed for any SNE to be dominated by all agents increasing 

their efforts, in our case, g, by a small amount. 

 

Strategic complementarities are trivially not  existent  in  this  setting  since  all 

agents choose a similar 

ig

g=  in equilibrium and we have already assumed 

V
2
∂
g
∂

i

. This is a model of strategic substitutability. Positive spillovers exist 

when  the  derivative  of  an  agent’s  utility  function  with  respect  to  the  other 

agents’  strategic  variable  is  larger  than  zero.  These  exist  in  this  model,  all 

agents choose similar g, 

V
∂

. The SNE we have found is unique, 

and it is also Pareto suboptimal. Since no other equilibrium exists is credible 

coordination then impossible?  

 

Heal (1976) shows that once you allow for repeated interactions, other, higher 

value  equilibria  than  the  one  above  can  be  sustained58.  Let  us  assume  the 

game  above  to  be  played  infinitely  and  see  if  there  is  some  ‘grim-trigger’ 

strategy which can sustain an equilibrium where all consumers choose

g

*

, 

the Pareto suboptimal SNE level. The strategy would imply that all consumers 

play  g so long as no consumer has deviated from this level. Hence for this to 

be sustained we need, for each consumer:

58 This is really just a version of the folk theorem or general possibility theorem (Myerson 
1991). A much quoted proof can be found in Rubinstein (1979) 

35
It follows that it is possible to imagine an infinitely repeated game in which a 

‘grim-trigger’ strategy is played and the cooperative, Pareto optimal outcome 

is sustained. From the above it is also clear that the bigger is the difference 

between the SNE outcome and the cooperative outcome

 the easier 

will  such  an  outcome  be  to  sustain.  From  this  it  seems  likely  that  we  can 

expect  consumers  to  behave  with  a  larger  degree  of  social  responsibility  in 

markets  where  consumption  goods  have  a  relatively  high  environmental 

impact59. This provides us with a rationale in chapter 5 to investigate a sub-

sample of firms’ whose environmental impact is judged to be high. A good 

example  is  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  with  the  observed  changing  position  in 

recent years of the main high street oil producers, such as Royal Dutch Shell 

and  British  Petroleum  (BP)  on  issues  such  as  Kyoto  and  global  warming60. 

Interestingly, in the US ExxonMobil remains sceptical of global warming and 

actively  part  of  the  coalition  against  the  Kyoto  agreement,  misleadingly 

named  the  Global  Climate  Coalition  (GCC).    Vogel  (2005)  notes  that 

Europeans  seem  more  willing  than  Americans  to  pay  for  environmental 

services. While it is hard to pin point any particular event which makes the 

European  oil  giants  more  susceptible  to  consumer  pressure  on  green  issues 

than American ones it is a good example how different social contexts might 

produce different environmental management outcomes.  

                                                
 
59  While  such  ‘grim-trigger’  strategies  clearly  are  not  played  by  consumers,  one  could 
imagine a tacit ‘grim-trigger’ like outcome, where all consumers are disciplined by fear of a 
tit-for-tat like response should it be known that they (and others with them) are cheating by a 
cooperating  majority.  Whilst  not  theoretically  explored  here,  such  an  outcome  seems  to  be 
more likely to emerge in markets for environmentally more damaging goods.  
60 Shell was the first oil company to break ranks with its competitors on Kyoto, and Shell’s 
chairman Sir Philip Watts, opened a new Shell Center for Sustainability at Rice University in 
Houston in 2003. BP meanwhile are running advertisement campaigns with the new slogan 
Beyond Petroleum and claiming to be the biggest spender on solar energy in the world.  

36
 

Overall,  this  model  highlights  the  problems  involved  with  expecting 

individual consumers to behave in a collectively beneficial way – when there 

are  private  benefits  from  deviation.  It  used  simple  and  well-known  game-

theoretic analysis to show why just because society would benefit, we cannot 

automatically expect there to exist a market for green products. 

3.7.1  Strategic complementarities and multiple SNEs 

If  the  model  above  was  changed  so  that  all  other  consumers  being  green 

implies that consumer i also wants to be green, then we would have strategic 

complementarities  and  multiple  SNEs.  A  realistic  framework  within  which 

this would arise might be the conjecture that being green is a social statement, 

or  a  fashion,  reinforced  by  other  people’s  actions.  Without  further 

formalisation, it is clear that were this to be our social framework trends and 

impulses might affect which equilibrium is reached at what time. There might 

also  be  a  case  for  a  degree  of  government  intervention61  to  mitigate  the 

coordination problem, and promote the Pareto optimal equilibrium.  

3.8  Model 3: A simple model of eco-efficiency improvements  

Dealing with waste is high on the agenda of most industrial companies, due 

mainly to tighter legislations and higher disposal costs (Jackson 2004). At the 

same time the Environment Index 2004, published by the British organisation 

Business in the Community (BITC) show that only few companies appear to 

be focussing on reducing waste at source (BITC Environment Index, 2004). 

                                                 
61 Say a marketing campaign highlighting environmental aspects of industrial production.  

37
Productive  eco-efficiency  is  not  just  driven  by  regulation,  it  might  also 

directly increase a firm’s profitability. This sets environmental priorities apart 

from  CSR  priorities  more  generally.  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997)  provide  good 

theoretic reasons why eco-efficiency of production may have a direct causal 

effect  on  operating  performance.  The  extent  to  which  a  firm  can  make 

efficiency gains will depend on what sort of production it is involved in, with 

the  potential  gains  generally  looming  larger  for  firms  with  a  larger 

environmental impact62. Using Innovest’s eco-efficiency data Guenster et al 

(2005) have provided evidence that a strong corporate eco-efficiency policy 

can be beneficial from an operating performance point of view. The following 

model  attempts  to  add  to  the  literature  by  formalising  these  ideas  in  a  very 

simple way.  

 

Consider a firm in a competitive market, producing output 

q

e n=
.

. Here, e is 

a resource efficiency measure with 

e∈

[

]0,1

 and n is a measure of inputs. The 

waste  produced  is  the  proportion  of  inputs,  n,  that  do  not  become  output: 

w e
( )

(1
= −

e n
)

.  With unit costs of production, c(e), assumed to be linear in 

e

63 so that c(e)= ζe,  the profit function becomes: 

π

=

pq c e q
( )

−

=

e n p
. (

 (3.1) 

Letting  figure  3.4  illustrate  the  production  process  of  the  firm,  we  would 

expect  the  firm  to  optimise  and  invest  in  the  level  of  efficiency  which 

maximises profits. 

 
 
                                                 
62 A firm like Microsoft has a lower environmental impact than General Motors. 
63 Efficiency investments increase marginal costs here. 

38
(Figure 3.3) A very simple production process 

 

As efficiency improvements are not usually costless,64 assume there are fixed 

costs associated with the efficiency investments given by: 

 

F e

( ) = 

eκ        

 

(3.2) 

The  introduction  of  fixed  costs  might  normally  mean  that  a  competitive 

market structure is inappropriate – due to the potential the fixed costs create 

for barriers to entry. The fixed costs introduced here are a small proportion of 

total costs however65 – and they are not fixed costs of production as such, but 

the costs of investing in an efficiency enhancing mechanism. For simplicity 

we have assumed these costs to be linear in e, although decreasing costs are 

probably  more  plausible.    With  the  introduction  of  the  F(e)  variable,    the 

profit function becomes:

64In  deed  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001)  quote  evidence  that  the  hidden  costs  of  environmental 
protection, including product design, waste disposal and depreciation could account for up to 
22% of an oil refinery’s operating budget. 
65 Explicitly we assume  qζ κ>> . 

39
Second  order  conditions  verify  that  this  is  maximum66.  Equation  (3.4)67 

indicates that increases in ζ, the marginal cost of production with respect to e 

will decrease e*.  The same is true for increases in κ, the marginal direct cost 

of  implementing  the  efficiency  enhancing  mechanism.  For  two  otherwise 

equal  firms,  if  one  has  higher e*  than  the  other,  this  might  reflect  that  it  is 

overall more cost efficient – that it has lower ζ  or κ parameters, or both68.  

Equation (3.4) also shows that the higher is n, the higher is e*. To the extent 

that  the  model  here  reflects  real  life  relationships,  eco-efficiency  might  be 

expected  to  increase  with  size.  This  makes  controlling  for  company  size 

crucial in any regression analysis69. 

  

The above analysis illustrates the eco-efficiency argument for environmental 

investments but it is by no means exhaustive of the issues involved in optimal 

waste reduction. More realistic, but also complicating changes to the model 

could include making inputs n a function of e so that improved eco-efficiency 

also  leads  to  lower  use  of  inputs  through  another  direct  effect  on  the  cost 

function. One could also make the costs of efficiency improvements become a 

function of changing technologies, which again would affect the optimal level 

of e, or one could give both c(e) and F(e) nonlinear functional forms.

67 It is clear that from this expression, mathematically e could take a value other than between 
. A value of e higher than 1 does not make intuitive sense. It

would  imply  that  more  resources  come  out  of  a  production  than  those  utilised  in  that 
production. Mathematically it would also require a large price-cost ratio.  
68 Along these lines Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that poor environmental 
performance is an indicator of a firm’s operational inefficiencies.

3.8.1  A simple intertemporal treatment                                                         

This  simple  extension  of  the  above  model  is  meant  to  capture  the  idea  that 

there might be a link between ‘forward-lookingness’ and investments in e. In 

a simple two period model the firm faces the following profit function:

In  equation  (3.5)  β<1  is  the  firms  discount  factor  –  and  the  fixed  costs  of 

implementing the ecoefficiency enhancing mechanism only apply in period 1. 

If we substitute in for q(e) we get equation (3.6) which we maximise to get 

optimal e* in equation (3.7).

(3.7) 

From equation (3.7) we see that the higher the discount factor, β, the higher is 

e*.  This  has  interesting  implications  in  the  context  of  assessing  the 

information  a  company’s  sector  relative  e  entails.  β  reflects  a  particular 

weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  In  other  words  it  reflects  the  firm’s 

opportunity cost. Ceteris paribus, one could expect a more long term outlook 

to imply a higher β. For reasonably homogenous firms, a higher e might be 

related to a manager’s belief about his company’s future profitability. Higher 

eco-efficiency  may  therefore  serve  as  a  plausible  proxy  for  a  company’s 

future performance.  This is a very interesting insight, and it is pleasing that it 

emerges from such an extraordinarily simple model. 

 

This  observation,  together  with  the  cost  efficiency  point  made  in  the  static 

analysis, might provide a good rationale for eco-efficiency to be relevant to 

41
how  companies  are  priced  in  the  financial  markets,  in  excess  of  any  direct 

causal gains implied by the environmental performance as such. Indeed, it is 

this sort of logic which underlies firms as Innovest’s view of eco-efficiency as 

a proxy for good management70. In a very crude way, this might  be seen as a 

direct  representation  of  the  cognitive-institutional  factors  discussed  at  the 

beginning  of  this  chapter.  The  model  has  also  highlighted  the  temporal 

differences  between  costs  and  benefits  of  eco-efficiency  enhancing 

investments. The former have a short term impact, the latter might be accruing 

in  the  long  run.  This  has  implications  for  how  we  construct  our  regression 

models on the relationship between environmental and operating performance.  

3.9 

 A link with profitability? The growth of the environmentally 

responsible corporation 

What  does  the  preceding  discussion  tell  us  about  the  growth  of  the 

environmentally  responsible  corporation?  Rheinardt  (2004)  argues  that  if  it 

pays  to  be  green,  then  one  would  expect  all  firms  to  become  greener.  Salo 

(2005)  finds  that  in  terms  of  environmental  performance  as  measured  by 

Ecovalue21, firms improved their median rating by 1 point between 2000 and 

2003.  KPMG  report  a  threefold  increase  in  environmental  reporting  in  this 

period  between  1993  and  2004  (KPMG  2005).  Interestingly,  Japanese  and 

British corporations are leaders in terms of environmental reporting (KPMG 

2005). Asked what drives such a change in priorities, 75% of business leaders 

                                                 
70  Interestingly  whilst  this  is  the  backbone  of  Innovest’s  asset  management  approach,  Salo 
(2005)  investigating  the  relationship  between  the  Ecovalue21  index  and    Belgian  company  
Deminor’s corporate governance rating find no evidence of a link. To the extent that measures 
of  good  corporate  governance  are  an  observable  proxy  for  overall  good  management  and 
institutions Salo’s (2005) findings hence seem to run counter to much of the discussion in this 
chapter. 

42
quote economic reasons, with 50% giving ethical reasons (KPMG 2005). This 

discussion  has  shown  that  the  distinction  between  the  economical  and  the 

ethical can be rather fluid.71  

 

Salo (2005) finds strong evidence that corporate environmental performance 

is influenced by a firm’s sector (rather than home country). The analysis here 

has shown that the more exposed to consumer pressures a firm is or the higher 

its environmental footprint, the higher may be the strategic and direct benefits 

from investing in environmental performance. This is due to a combination of 

effects on the costs of production, the risks of a consumer fall out, the costs of 

window-dressing and the risks of future liabilities. In such sectors it might be 

reasonable  to  expect  environmental  laggards  to  show  lower  long  run 

profitability than environmental leaders.  The chapter has thus illustrated the 

possible  need  to  break  a  general  sample  down  to  more  homogenous  sub-

samples in order to obtain unambiguous results in a regression analysis. 

 

Nonetheless, once we take on board the heterogeneity of consumers and the 

strong forces promoting differentiation in real world markets (Tirole 2003) the 

expectation  of  a  link  between  good  environmental  management  and 

profitability  remains  complicated.  For  example,  environmental  leaders  and 

laggards might just be strategically positioning themselves in a market made 

up by consumers with different environmental preferences. It seems likely that 

in the long run some firms might benefit from selling cheap, environmentally 
                                                 
71 Of the 50% that give an ethical reason for environmental priorities many mention integrity 
as a driving ethical factor (KPMG 2005). There is no doubt that a reputation for integrity is an 
important competitive tool in many industries, and so establishing integrity might just as well 
be classified as an economic reason. 

43
unfriendly  goods,  just  as  some  firms  do  well  by  selling  cheap,  low  quality 

foodstuffs or clothing. 

 

Finally  this  chapter  also  discussed  why  a  link  between  environmental 

performance  and  profits  may  be  based  on  a  firm’s  ability  to  re-evaluate 

production processes and adopt new managerial and technological innovations 

in  order  to  respond  to  strategic  opportunities  which  arise  in  any  dynamic 

market. This sort of relationship implies a link between good management or 

institutions and environmental performance. However it does not say a great 

deal  of  the  relative  causality  of  the  relationship.  Does  good  management 

simultaneously cause green production and higher returns? Or do production 

techniques  lead  directly  to  financial  benefits?  Or  perhaps  is  the  causation 

reversed,  so  financially  successful  companies  have  more  to  spend  on  green 

initiatives? 

 

The  above  has  concerned  itself  with  trying  to  explore  beyond  compliance 

corporate  environmental  outcomes,  and  to  provide  a  necessary  theoretical 

background  for  the  empirical  analysis.  It  has  shown  that  there  are  good 

reasons  why  links  might  exist  between  environmental  performance  and 

profitability.  Any  potential  links  are  however  susceptible  to  changes  in  the 

strategic  and  sectoral  settings  under  analysis.  On  the  individual  firm  level, 

many a case study of successful environmental strategies can be found, and, to 

quote King and Lenox (2001: 105) perhaps the question should be ‘when does 

it  pay  to  be  green  –  rather  than  does  it  pay  to  be  green?’  The  former  is 

explored in the next chapters. 

44
Chapter 4 

Empirical analysis  

After briefly describing the dataset in section 4.1, and discussing the choice of 

dependent  and  independent  variables  in  sections  4.2  and  4.3,  this  chapter 

discusses  the  use  of  modern  panel  data  methods  to  achieve  a  more  causal 

analysis of linkages between environmental performance and profits. It also 

discusses some tests and diagnostics that can be used to make choices between 

estimators. Primarily to enable further stability analysis a brief description of a 

standard application of the Fama-Macbeth (1973) regression method used by 

Guenster  et  al  (2005)  is  given  towards  the  end  of  the  chapter.  Finally  is 

outlined  a  method  for  directly  addressing  a  link  between  environmental 

performance  and  managerial  ability,  and  so 

the  more 

institutional 

characteristics discussed in chapter 3 

 

 The empirical analysis of this thesis is mainly based on ‘small T, large n72’ 

dynamic panel data techniques. Panel data, involving repeated observations of 

the same cross section of individual units enables us to model dynamics and 

control  for  some  sources  of  potential  endogeneity,  particularly  that  arising 

from  unobserved  individual  effects.  This allows  us  to  mitigate  against  what 

Koehler (2004) argues is the largest empirical failure of the literature to date: 

the inability to sufficiently control for issues of endogeneity, omitted variable 

bias  and  coincidental  dynamics.  The  results  of  applications  based  on  the 

models discussed in this chapter are presented in chapter 5.

4.1 

 The dataset 

The  sample  of  firms  consists  of  publicly  listed  Japanese  companies,  drawn 

from  different  Japanese  stock  markets,  including  Japan’s  two  stock  markets 

for  medium  and  small  sized  venture  companies,  JASDAQ  and  Tokyo 

Mothers. The companies therefore vary much more in size than in previous 

studies which have tended to concentrate only on large firms, often drawing 

from  the  S&P  500.  This  has  the  advantage  that  any  significant  findings  of 

regressions run on the entire data can be said to be reasonably general. The 

potential  disadvantages  should  be  quite  clear  from  chapter  3.  There  are 

compelling theoretical reasons why an unambiguous overall effect should not 

exist. Breaking the sample down into sub-samples might be needed to attain 

any clear results. 

 

Also  implied  by  the  last  chapter  is  the  point  that  environmental  profit 

opportunities,  to  the  extent  that  they  exist,  seem  likely  to  lie  in  proactive 

environmental governance. The Nikkei Environmental Management Survey73 

(hereafter  the  Nikkei  survey)  seeks  to  capture  the  various  aspects  of  this 

concept.  It  is  therefore  well  suited  for  an  empirical  investigation  into  the 

potential  returns  to  environmental  performance.  The  survey  questionnaire  is 

changed  every  year  to  reflect  frequent  changes  in  the  environmental  legal 

system and company behaviour and differs slightly in its emphasis depending 

on  the  industrial  sector.  The  questionnaire  for  manufacturers  had  126 

questions in 2004. The score set in each question is added up in one of the 
                                                 
73 The Nikkei survey has been conducted every year since 1997 and its purpose is to rank 
companies based on their environmental management. The results of the survey are published 
in  the  Nikkei  Sangyo  Shimbun  and Nihon Keizai  Shimbun business newspapers  with  joint 
circulations of over 3 million. 

46
following  7  categories:  (i)  management  structure  and  risk  disclosure,  (ii) 

vision,  (iii)  pollution  risk,  (iv)  recycling,  (v)  eco-friendly  products,  (vi) 

measures  against  global  warming  and  (vii)  environmental  measures  at  non-

manufacturing sites. Rather than being a measure purely of eco-efficiency, the 

score captures very neatly the sort of different variables needed to establish a 

more  general  causality  between  good  environmental  management  and  firm 

profits. The Nikkei survey gives scores from 0 to 1000. In our sample, which 

covers the years 1999-2003, the maximum score attained is 826, the lowest 78 

and the average around 465.  

 

The fact that the Nikkei survey is questionnaire based creates a potential self 

selection  bias  in  our  sample74.  Who  is  to  say  how  truthful  the  respondents 

were.  What  if  worse  performers  over-emphasise  their  achievements?  This 

would  obscure  any  relationship  between  environmental  performance  and 

profitability,  and  represents  a  potentially  serious  flaw  in  the  dataset.  Where 

possible  the  Nikkei  survey  was  compared  with  the  Innovest  Ecovalue21 

index,  which  is  non-questionnaire  based.  As  figure  (4.1)  on  the  next  page 

shows, the correlations between the Nikkei and the Innovest scores are good. 

 

The  dataset  has  been  constructed  so  that  all  firms  experiencing  mergers  or 

significant acquisitions in the period have been excluded75. In addition to this, 

                                                 
74  In  2003  the  response  rate  for  manufacturers  was  38%.  Matthew  Kiernan,  president  of 
Innovest, pointed to this as an immediate worry when looking at some early regression results 
produced for this thesis. Perhaps not too surprisingly, Horowitz and Manski (1998) show that 
the seriousness of this problem is directly proportional to amount of non response.  
75 This is surprisingly often not done in the literature. 

47
to reduce any outlier effects, values of the dependent variable outside +/- 3 

standard deviations from the mean have been left out of the regressions. 

(Figure 4.1)   Correlations between Nikkei and Innovest scores 

 

4.2 

The dependent variables and their relationship with the 

environmental indicator 

We  have  chosen  one  financial  performance  measure  Tobin’s  Q76  and  two 

operating performance measures, ROA and ROE, to serve as our dependent 

variables.  Following  Guenster  et  al  (2005),  employing  both  market-based 

(Tobin’s  Q)  and  accounting-based  (ROA  and  ROE)  measures  was  done  to 

ensure reliable and consistent results, as both have their specific strengths and 

weaknesses.  

 

The rationale for including a stock market based variable is straight forward. 

In  popular  writing,  newspapers  and  business  literature,  intangible  reputation 

effects, as discussed in chapter 3, are often mentioned as reasons for investing 

in environmental performance. This sort of impact is captured by Tobin’s Q.  

                                                 
76 See figure below for how Tobin’s Q is measured. This is not analysts’ Tobin’s Q which is 
proven  by  Bond  and  Cummins  (2001)  to  outperform  conventional  Q.  (See  Bond  and 
Cummins  2001  for  details).  For  this  thesis  a  less  complex  Q  was  chosen  due  to  data 
availability concerns. 
 

48
With perfect information one would expect the stock value of a firm to react 

instantly  to  any  change  in  information  which  is  judged  to  influence  future 

profitability77. In other words, the stock market based variables should capture 

benefits from an increase in environmental performance which would only be 

seen in accounting based variables in the longer run, possibly outside of the t 

dimension available to this thesis. 

 

It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  however  that  stock  market  variables  do  not 

capture actual increases in profits caused by environmental performance, but 

rather  the  market’s  belief  about  future  profitability  increments.  Increases  in 

Tobin’s Q do not directly feed into bottom line improvements. 

 

A  more  subtle  point  in  terms  of  a  relationship  between  Tobin’s  Q  and  the 

environmental indicator is made by Koehler (2004). Looking at US evidence, 

she  notes  that  so  long  as  green  investing  is  still  quite  marginal  in  terms  of 

trading volumes, green investors might be expected to be price takers, and as 

such have little influence on Tobin’s Q78.  

 

It follows from the discussion above that stock market based variables alone 

are not enough to uncover any firm causal dynamics between long run profits 

and environmental performance. The choice of the two operating performance 

measures reflects the aim to find broad measures which addresses profitability 
                                                 
77 Some authors, notably Guenster et al (2005) report that also the stock market might update 
environmental  information  with  a  time  lag.  They  work  with  monthly,  not  yearly  data 
however. In any case, as opposed to the operating performance measures, there is no reason to 
expect a different effect of present relative to past values of environmental performance on 
financial performance.  
78 Although it is possible that green investors are not price takers in special, green segments of 
the market. 

49
and  efficiency  (Guenster  et  al  2005).  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997)  focus  on  the 

relation  between  corporate  environmental  performance  and  firm  operating 

performance, and use ROA as the dependent variable. Hart and Ahuja (1996) 

also look at ROE79. Table 4.2 shows the three dependent variables and how 

they are defined. 

(Table 4.2) The dependent variables 

 Tobin’s Q:

Market value of assets

Net replacement costs of assets

 = Total assets - market capitalisation - shareholder's equity 

net property+investments+current assets

 

     ROA:   

net income after tax

total assets

 

             ROE:   

net income after tax
shareholder's equity

 

Due  to  the  annual  nature  of  accounting  one  might  expect  a  potential 

relationship  between  the  environmental  indicator  and  ROE  and  ROA  to  be 

seen in the lagged, not current values (Guenster et al 2005)80. In the analysis 

that  follows  the  environmental  indicator  both  at  t  and  lagged  at  t-1  will  be 

used as control variables in the regressions run on accounting based operating 

performance indicators81.The T=5 data does allow the inclusion of a further t-

2  environmental  indicator  but  it  was  thought  that  this  would  ‘kill’  the  time 

dimension  of  the  panel82.    The  ROA  and  ROE  variables  are  in  percentages 

when used in the regressions in the next chapter. 

4.3 

Additonal independent variables 

Guenster et al (2005) note that regression analysis exploring the relationship 

                                                 
79  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  main  difference  between  ROE  and  ROA  is  due  to 
financial leverage. Assets = liabilities + shareholders' equity. A company with no debt will 
have ROA equal to ROE.  
80As  mentioned  Hart  and  Ahuja  (1996)  found  that  decreases  in  firm  pollution  predates 
increases in operating performance. 
81 As opposed to Tobin’s Q, it is important to include both – since as discussed in model 3, a 
negative  initial  effect  when  only  costs  accrue,  and  a  more  positive  later  effect,  might  be 
expected. 
82 Whilst T-5 the panel is also unbalanced, with some variables missing for certain years. 

50
between  environmental  management  and  financial  or  operating  performance 

accounts for potentially confusing influences from the environmental indicator 

on the dependent variable. The dynamics seem likely to be multifaceted, and 

any potential causal effect of environmental performance on profits is likely to 

be affecting various firms and industries in different ways. From chapter 3 it is 

clear  that  reasonable  control  variables  in  this  setting  might  include 

institutional  responsiveness  or  managerial  quality.  While  it  under  some 

assumptions will be possible to control for these, the lack of directly available 

controls  is  but  one  reminder  that  our  regressions  might  suffer  from  serious, 

but  indeterminate,  biases.  The  controls  chosen  for  the  subsequent  analysis 

stick closely to the more recent specifications used in the literature. 

 

In  the  Tobin’s  Q  regressions  we  include,  following  Guenster  et  al  (2005), 

King and Lenox (2002), and Konar and Cohen (2001) R&D intensity83 as a 

control  variable,  since  this  is  found  to  be  relatively  closely  related  to  the 

variable  of  interest,  the  environmental  indicator  (See  figure  4.1).  It  is  also 

thought to be affecting the reputation strategic effects we were exploring in 

the last chapter. Furthermore, R&D intensity might be a very crude indicator 

of institutional learning and responsiveness.

Hirsch  (1991)  showed  that  recent  sales  growth  is  positively  related  to 

company profits, and Guenster et al (2005) include two-year sales growth as a 

further  control  variable.  Here,  year  by  year  sales  growth  is  included  as  a 

control variable. This is more practical due to our limited T84.  

 

To  condition  on  differences  in  firm  size,  following  Guenster  et  al  (2005), 

book value of total assets is used.  Finally, age of assets was included in the 

regressions85.  The regression equation for the Tobin’s Q regressions is hence 

as below.

The inclusion of a lagged dependent variable and the two error terms 

iη and 

uit will be discussed in more detail in the sections 4.5 and 4.6.  The use of a 

semi-log  form  reflects  that  it  seems  plausible  that  the  magnitude  of  both 

potential gains and costs of environmental performance becomes smaller as a 

firm moves closer to ‘maximum environmental efficiency’86. 

 

In  the  regressions  on  the  operating  performance  estimators  controls  include 

the before mentioned Nikkeiscore at t-1, total assets and age of assets, as well 

as  a  new  measure  of  risk  and  managerial  flexibility,  debt  to  equity  ratio 

(DER).  The  set  of  control  variables  here  is  similar  to  that  of  Waddock  and

first  glance  seem  like  a  possible  additional  control.  However  these  were  found  to  be 
consistently insignificant in all regressions. Following Guenster et al (2005) and Konar and 
Cohen (2001), company age (and company age squared) was (were) initially included in the 
regressions  but  was  (were)  found  to  be  insignificant  and,  somewhat  surprisingly  perhaps, 
unrelated to environmental performance.

Arriving at the appropriate model 

Endogeneity is a fundamental problem in most applied econometrics work. It 

often 

arises 

due 

to

in [

[
E x u ≠ . In other words it is the correlation between the

it

it

dependent and observed independent variables and the error term, caused by 

any  omitted  variable,  which  creates  the  bias.  Since  in  this  analysis  the 

coefficient on the environmental indicator is of primary interest, it is the case 

where  endogeneity  leads  to [

] 0

it

it

E x u ≠   which  should  be  our  main  concern. 

The  econometric  literature  offers  various  ways  around  this  problem.  IV 

estimation, where an instrument that is correlated with the variable of interest, 

but uncorrelated with the error term, is used instead of the variable of interest, 

is the most obvious solution. In practice this can be problematic due to limited 

potential  for  finding  valid 

instruments88.  No  suitable  and  available 

                                                 
87 R&D intensity was not included here due to the dataset only containing 3 years of R&D 
intensity data. Removing R&D intensity from the regressions seemed to impact little on the 
other point estimates. 
88 Weak instruments are not a good option since they introduce an indeterminate bias of their 
own (Blundell et al 2000) 

53
instrumental variable could be found for this thesis89. A slightly different form 

of endogeneity bias that is often encountered in panel data analysis is due to 

unobserved  individual  specific  fixed  effects.  Such  endogeneity  can  be 

controlled for and is discussed in more detail in section 4.5. Final solutions to 

the  endogeneity  problem  are  the  difference  and  system  GMM  (dGMM  and 

sGMM) methods outlined in section 4.6. These methods, developed amongst 

others by Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell 

and Bond (1998) have become increasingly popular in panel data estimations 

in  recent  years  and  utilize  moment  conditions  on  past  levels  and  first 

differences of the control variables in order to overcome the endogeneity bias. 

The fact that the fixed effects can be identified in the regressions, also allow 

for investigations into the fixed effects as such. This enables us in chapter 5 to 

test  for  any  relationship  between  the  fixed  effects  and  the  environmental 

indicator, and thus assess whether there is a link between good management, 

unobserved  and  assumed  fixed  in  the  short  run  (Wooldridge  2002)  and 

environmental performance. 

4.5 

Individual effects 

Individual specific variables that do not change over time are referred to as 

individual  or  fixed  effects  and  are,  as  already  mentioned,  often  thought  to 

include  unobserved  managerial  ability  in  firm  level  micro  econometric 

analysis (Wooldridge 2002). Since the data we are dealing with is reasonably 

short  spanning,  with  T=4,  interpreting  managerial  ability  as  approximately 

                                                 
89 An effort was made to gather data on the age of companies’ CEOs from the expectation that 
this might be related to environmental performance, whether this might have proven a good 
instrument could not be established due to it quickly becoming clear that such data gathering 
was beyond the scope of this thesis.

fixed seems a reasonably appropriate assumption. The individual effects are

The  existence  of  fixed  effects  presents  some  problems  with  regards  to  the

Var[ iη] = 090. If this does not hold, then  ˆ

serial  autocorrelation  of  the  error  term,

,  caused  by  the  time-

invariant  component 

iη.  However,  in  a  panel  setting,  some  simple 

transformations can rectify this, but at a cost.  

 

One  way  to  eliminate  the  endogeneity  bias  produced  by  the  time  invariant 

elements of the error term is to do a within transformation, which under the 

classical  panel  data  assumptions91,  is  consistent  even  when 

[
E x η ≠   or

i

Var( iη) ≠ 0.  The  transformation  consists  of  subtracting  the  empirical  mean 

from  both  sides  of  the  equation,  thereby  eliminating  the  time  invariant 

iη. 

This produces the fixed effects/within groups estimator, ˆ

WGβ . Under classical 

assumptions  ˆ

Dynamic linear GMM models 

Motivated  by  the  inconsistency  of  the ˆ

WGβ   and   

ˆ
OLSβ   in  many  settings, 

Arellano and Bond (1991) with dGMM and Arellano and Bover (1995) with 

level GMM (lGMM) introduced further advances in terms of addressing panel 

data endogeneity problems. 

 

Dynamic models with lagged dependent variables allow for serial correlation 

of unknown form (Arellano 2003). Even though the coefficient on the lagged 

dependent  variable  is  of  no  direct  interest  in  our  analysis,  allowing  for 

dynamics of the underlying processes ‘may be crucial for recovering estimates 

of other parameters’ (Bond 2002: 1). In our context it might seem reasonable 

to  investigate  a  dynamic  specification  since  current  profitability  might  be 

expected to at least partially depend on past outcomes92. A generic dynamic 

model representation is shown below.

The dGMM method, which treats the model as a system of equations with one

effects.  Lagged  levels  are  then  used  as  instruments  for  current  first 

differences, under the assumption that lagged levels are uncorrelated with the 

error  term  of  the  transformed  model  in  first  differences.  The  subsequent 

moment  restrictions, 

E x
(

u−
Δ

MA(0).  These  impose  less  strict  assumptions  on  the  model  than  the  strict 

exogeneity  assumption  of  the  classic  models  in  section  4.493.  Bond  (2002) 

notes that strict exogeneity is often not a natural restriction in the context of 

economic models since it  rules out any feedback from current or past shocks 

on current values of a variable, which often seems appropriate for outcomes of 

variables  like  investments  or  Tobin’s  Q  (Bond  2002).  A  problem  with  the 

dGMM  estimator,  however,  is  that  lagged  levels  might  be  poor  instruments 

for first differences. This is especially the case where variables are close to a 

random walk. 

 

Arellano  and  Bover  (1995)  show  how  under  slightly  different  assumptions, 

suitable  lagged  first  differences  will  be  available  as  instruments  for  the 

original  equation  in  levels.  This  case  occurs  when  we  have (

MA(0)  process.  These  two  approaches  lead  Blundell  and  Bond  (1998)  to 

suggest a system GMM estimator which incorporates the optimal combination 

of  the  dGMM  and  the  lGMM  (Blundell  et  al  2000).  The  available  moment 

conditions  will  vary  in  this  estimation  depending  on  whether  the  control 

variables are thought to be endogenous, predetermined or exogenous95. It is 

important  to  note  that,  whereas  for  the  dGMM  estimator  a  known  weight 

matrix  is  available  which  will  make  a  one-step  and  two-step  estimator 

asymptotically equivalent, this is not so for the sGMM estimator. This means 

that the gain in efficiency from using an optimal two-step estimator is likely to 

be  greater  in  this  context  (Bond  2002).  The  two-step  estimator  has  been 

shown  to  deliver  less  reliable  inference  than  the  one-step  version  in  finite 

settings however (Blundell and Bond 2000), and this has meant that applied 

work has often used the one-step estimator (Bond 2002).  Windmeijer (2000) 

proposes  a  finite  sample  correction  method  for  the  two-step  estimator  and 

these  corrected  two-step  errors  can  be  computed  in  STATA.  In  this  thesis 

diffferent representations will include both dGMM and onestep and twostep 

sGMM, and as shall be outlined in section 4.8, diagnostics will be used as far 

as possible to ascertain which is the more appropriate estimator. 

4.7  More on the direction of the biases 

As mentioned before, generally both the WG and OLS methods will tend to 

produce biased estimates. For dynamic representations this bias is systemic: 

i ty −

  will  be  correlated  with  the  error  term  even  after  the  within 

(

, 1

(Baltagi  2001).  These  methods  are  hence  fundamentally  unsuitable  for 

dynamic estimation. Generally, at least in large samples, the WG estimate will 

tend  to  be  biased  downwards,  and  the  OLS  upwards  (Bond  2002).  Bond 

(2002) further notes that the fact that these two estimators tend to be biased in 

opposite directions is useful as they indicate an upper and lower limit for a 

candidate  efficient  GMM  estimator.  In  the  cases  where  a  supposedly 

asymptotically efficient GMM estimator does not return an estimate within the 

WG-OLS band we might suspect either inconsistency or severe finite sample 

bias (Bond 2002). 

 

Blundell and Bond (1998) consider the properties of the GMM estimators in 

dynamic models with weakly exogenous regressors. Since this is perhaps the 

most common case in empirical applications, they note that their Monte Carlo 

simulations  will  have  important  implications  for  applied  work.  They  also 

compare  the  various  GMM  results  with  the  OLS  and  WG  estimators  in 

dynamic representations.  Blundell and Bond (2000) conclude that the dGMM 

is  biased  and  has  low  precision  when  the  individual  series  are  highly 

autoregressive. They also conclude that this bias will be in the direction of the 

WG estimator. Blundell et al (2000) prove how the moment conditions on the 

lGMM  estimator  remain  informative  even  as  the  series  becomes  very 

autoregressive.  Estimating  different  autoregressive  parameters  in  persistent 

series  Blundell  and  Bond  (2000)  find  that  the  sGMM  estimator  greatly 

improves precision. Bond (2002) hence advocates that care should be taken to 

examine  the  time  series  properties  of  any  series  in  order  to  qualify  the 

59
precision  of  the  dGMM  estimator.    In  this  thesis  this  was  very  crudely 

examined by estimating a simple dynamic representation,

to look at the coefficients returned by the WG and OLS regressions for the 

dependent variables and the Nikkeiscore. It was hoped that due to the biases 

discussed  above  we  thus  had  a  measure  of  an  upper  and  lower  band  in 

autoregression. The figure below summarises the results.

There  is  evidence  that  especially  the  Nikkeiscore,  and  to  a  lesser  extent 

Tobin’s Q96 are potentially highly autoregressive. There is reason to believe 

that the dGMM estimators of the coefficients on the environmental indicator 

will suffer from considerable bias in the regressions that follow, and should be 

treated with caution. 

4.8  Which to trust? Some tests and diagnostics to decide on 

specification issues 

A test which further examines the significance of the fixed effects, and so the 

need  for  the  within  transformation,  is  easily  available  in  STATA.  The 

Hausman test tests whether there is a systematic difference between the more 

                                                 
96 This variable is often found to be strongly persistent (Bond 2002). In fact the reason why 
the coefficients are not higher her might be due to the effect of the technology bubble in 2000. 
If regressions are run for only the later years of the panel the OLS coefficient is >0.77.  

60
often consistent WG estimator, and the more efficient but less often consistent 

OLS estimator. The Hausman test is reported in the regressions that follow.  

 

As  the  discussion  above  has  shown,  in  simulations  at  least,  the  sGMM 

estimator  is  the  estimator  of  choice.  In  applied  work  there  is  potential  for 

over-identification,  and  the  utilisation  of  invalid  instruments  and  moment 

constraints  with  ‘large  n  small  T’  panels  and  sGMM,  since  the  number  of 

moment  constraints  increases  rapidly  with  n  (Bowsher  2002).  Traditionally 

the  GMM  test  of  over-identifying  restrictions,  hereafter  the  Sargan  test,  has 

been  used  in  dynamic  panel  data  analysis  to  test  for  over-identification 

(Bowsher  2002).  This  test,  which  has 

2χ distribution  asymptotically97,  and 

degrees of freedom equal to the number of over-identifying restrictions, has 

however been found to have low power when based on the full Arellano-Bond 

(1991)  instrument  set,  especially  when  T  becomes  larger  relative  to  a  set  n 

(Bowsher  2002).    Furthermore,  as  pointed  out  by  Anderson  and  Sørensen 

(1996) in the context of a stochastic volatility model, when too many moment 

constraints  are  included  the  p-values  of  the  Sargan  test  get  inflated,  again 

making its power poor. This is important in applied settings as it is directly 

affected by the number of control variables, and lagged instruments, used.  Of 

course, the applied econometrician can mitigate this to an extent by restricting 

the number of lags used when constructing the instruments. Such restrictions 

are easily achieved in STATA, where lag lengths can be controlled, and has 

been restricted as far as possible in the regressions presented here. Bowsher 
                                                 
2χ distribution 
97 The test is based on the minimised two-step estimator and has asymptotic
regardless of heteroskedasticity. The test also holds for the one-step estimate, since the over-
identifying restrictions are the same in both cases (Bond 2002). 

61
(2002) shows how such restrictions, in a dynamic AR(1) model, do reduce the 

tendency of the Sargan test to under-reject.  

 

Another possible test of over-identification is the difference-Sargan test (Dif-

Sar). Dif-Sar is useful in many contexts98, and can be used here to supplement 

the Sargan test of over-identification. The actual test statistic becomes, when 

testing the appropriateness of sGMM over dGMM,

, where

  are  the  Sargan  test  statistics  under  sGMM  and  dGMM 

respectively.  The  Dif-Sar 

tests  whether 

the  difference  between  a 

representation  requiring  weaker  assumptions  and  one  requiring  stronger 

assumptions  is  significant.  In  other  words,  the  Dif-Sar  test  specifically  tests 

the  validity  of  the  extra  instruments  used  in  the  sGMM  estimation  as 

compared to the dGMM estimation. Both the Sargan test and the Dif-Sar test 

have as null hypothesis that the extra instruments are valid. Sargan and Dif-

Sar test statistics will generally be reported in the regressions that follow. 

 

Finally, tests for serial autocorrelation are reported for all regressions. Since 

these  models  by  construction  are  AR  (1),  the  tests  for  second  order 

autocorrelation in the 

itv

 disturbances are also of interest (Bond 2002). The 

transformed 

itvΔ

should  have  significant  negative  first  order  correlation  (but 

no second order) for the assumption that the

itv

 are serially uncorrelated to be 

valid (Bond 2002).  

                                                 
98  As  noted  by  Bond  (2002)  it  can  be  used  to  test  the  relatively  weak  assumption  of 
endogeneity against pre-determinedness of a regressor, since the former moment conditions 
would  necessarily be a strict subset of the latter. This has been done where appropriate (and 
possible) in this thesis to arrive at the correct specifications.

4.9 

A further stability indicator: The Fama-Macbeth regression 

approach 

Primarily because this is the method used by Guenster et al (2005) but also 

because  it  might  further  support  the  stability  of  any  findings  from  other 

regressions,  Fama-Macbeth  (1973)  (FM)  regressions  are  also  reported  in 

chapter 5. The FM cross-sectional regression approach essentially consists of 

two steps. In the first step, for each time period, cross-sectional regressions 

are used to obtain estimates of the parameters of interest. In the second step, 

time series for these estimates are used to produce final parameter values and 

standard errors. Skoulakis (2005) notes that apart from Cochrane (2001) who 

proves  that  FM  is  essentially  the  same  as  OLS  so  long  as  the  explanatory 

variables  do  not  vary  with  time,  the  FM  approach,  whilst  widely  used  in 

finance,  is  largely  ignored  in  the  econometrics  literature.  He  goes  on  to 

provide a thorough analysis of the behaviour of the FM estimator relative to 

the  OLS  estimator  in  different  settings.  He  concludes  that  if  T  is  small,  t-

statistics  can  be  rather  misleading  and  that  the  FM  estimator  is  primarily  a 

large  T  estimator.  In  the  regression  analysis  presented  in  the  next  chapter, 

results  are  reported  for  a  traditional  FM  and  a  weighted  FM  which  takes 

variances  in  year  by  year  sample  size  into  account99.  Due  to  the  relatively 

short T of the dataset, and the fact that the FM estimators do not control for 

any fixed effects, these should be expected to be biased. Since the estimators

of Management.

have been used in the literature100 it seems relevant still to report them and get 

a sense of the direction of the biases.  

4.10 

 Identifying and testing the fixed effects 

In  a  recent  paper  looking  at  the  determinants  of  exports  of  manufacturing 

goods from Sub-Saharan Africa Rankin et al (2005) specifically analyses the 

fixed effects of their regressions. Here we propose to extract the fixed effects 

from  the  error  term  produced  in  the  sGMM  to  specifically  test  for  any 

relationship between these and the environmental indicator. While not part of 

a causal analysis, this is interesting as it allows us to examine a potential link 

between environmental performance and managerial ability, if this is thought 

to be a significant part of the unobserved fixed effects. In this way it directly 

approaches the institutional aspects discussed in chapter 3. In the next chapter 

pooled OLS is run on the identified fixed effects to see the extents to which 

the environmental indicator really is a proxy for these. Regressions are also

Chapter 5 

Results  

This chapter presents various regression results making use of the estimators 

discussed in chapter 4. In section 5.1 results are presented for the OLS, WG, 

dGMM and sGMM estimators, and also for comparison, FM and wFM. These 

are  results  from  regressions  run  on  the  whole  sample.  Ex  ante  the  primary 

estimator is the sGMM estimator. Theoretically, this is the estimator that best 

controls for the various forms of endogeneity potentially affecting the sample. 

As  discussed  in  chapter  4,  a  reasonable  sGMM  specification  should  return 

estimates  of  the  lagged  dependent  variable  within  the  WG-OLS  band. 

Negative first order autocorrelation of the residuals, and no over-identification 

are  other  requirements  for  good  specification.  We  will  use  the  regression 

results for the whole dataset, presented in section 5.1, to assess the apparent 

biases on the different estimators and then report a more parsimonious set of 

estimators in the subsequent analysis. 

 

In sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 regression results for different sub-samples of the 

data,  divided  by  environmental  performance,  environmental  footprint  and 

consumer  exposure,  are  reported.  Ideally,  following  the  conclusions  from 

chapter 3, regressions should be run sectorally101, to ensure a sample which is 

exposed  as  homogeneously  as  possible  to  any  causal  dynamics.  This  was 

                                                 
101 Another possibility not explored in the last chapter would be to control directly for sectors. 
This  is  not  possible  for  the  dGMM  and  WG  estimators  due  to  the  transformation.  It  was  
judged  that,  due  to  the  additional  insights  on  the  biases  provided  by  the  WG  and  dGMM 
estimates,  as  well  as  the  much  discussed  theoretical  argument  against  looking  for  overall 
effects, dividing the sample into sub-samples was appropriate for this study. 

65
however not possible due to the limits it put on sample size. Depending on the 

sub-samples, regressions on Tobin’s Q, operating performance or both will be 

reported. Before concluding the empirical analysis in section 5.6, in section 

5.5  this  chapter  reports  results  from  regressions  directly  analysing  the 

relationship  between  the  fixed  effects,  containing  time  invariant  elements 

linked  to  managerial  quality,  and  the  environmental  indicator.  In  the  result 

tables,  the  point  estimates  and  standard  errors  of  the  lagged  dependent 

variable and the environmental indicator(s) will be reported. 

5.1 

All data 

The results for the regressions run on the entire dataset are presented in tables 

5.1102 to 5.3. For dGMM and sGMM, regressions with instruments taken at t-

3 are also reported. Ex ante the expectation is that, following the exposition in 

chapter 3, a strong general result is unlikely to exist. Clearer results are hoped 

to emerge from the sub-sample analysis.  

 

Table 5.1 presents the results for Tobin’s Q. Some results are rather striking. 

In  terms  of  the  biases,  both  the  two-step  and  one-step  t-2  sGMM  return 

estimates for 

i tyα −  well within the WG-OLS band, and these are significant 

, 1

at the 1% level. Moreover the t-2 dGMM, as expected, returns much lower, 

unsignificant estimates, outside the band. This might be due to some degree of 

weak  instrument  bias  following  the  persistence  in  the  Tobin’s  Q  and 

Nikkeiscore  series.  The  FM  and  wFM  estimators  appear  to  be  biased 

                                                 
102 Large tables can be found from page 91.

upwards103. Both the Dif-Sar and Sargan tests reject the validity of the extra 

sGMM  instruments.  The  t-3  sGMM  does  not  rectify  this:  the  Dif-Sar  and 

Sargan tests again reject the validity of the sGMM instruments, and this time 

the  estimates  fall  outside  of  the  WG-OLS  band104.  The  sGMM,  but  not  the 

dGMM  regressions  return  the  expected  negative  first  order  correlation.  The 

existence of fixed effects is confirmed by the Hausman test. 

 

Turning to the estimator of interest, the environmental indicator, the situation 

is  somewhat  confusing.  The  OLS  and,  interestingly,  the  FM  and  wFM 

estimators, return positive and significant estimates at around 0.200105.  The 

other significant estimate, however, is the t-3 dGMM which returns a highly 

negative  coefficient106,  and  overall  the  point  estimates  vary  substantially.  

This,  together  with  the  evidence  suggesting  that  the  sGMM  regressions  are 

over-identified,  seems  to  imply  that  a  strong  conclusion  of  the  relationship 

cannot be drawn from the dataset as a whole.   

 

Table  5.2  shows  the  results  for  ROA.  The  FM  and  wFM  estimates  again 

appear to be more upward biased than the OLS estimator. The t-2 dGMM and 

sGMM  return  estimates  within  the  WG-OLS  band.  The  Hausman  test 

indicates  the  existence  of  fixed  effects.  The  t-2  dGMM  coefficient  on  the 

                                                 
103 This is not too surprising since they do not control for fixed effects. 
104 It is worth noting that R&D intensity has been taken out of the t-3 regressions since it only 
spans  3  years  and  hence  would  kill  the  t-dimension  entirely.  The  estimates  are  hence  not 
directly comparable. 
105  A  point  increase  in  the  log  of  the  Nikkeiscore  is  roughly  equivalent  to  going  from  the 
bottom of the nikkeiscore (around 300) to the top (around 800). When reading the coefficients 
in  what  follows  it  is  important  to  have  this  in  mind  and  also  the  diminishing  returns 
represented by the semi-log function, ln(700)-ln(600)<ln(500)-ln(400). 
106 When we consider the definition of Tobin’s Q the point estimates on the dGMM estimators 
seem unreasonably large.  

67
lagged  dependent  variable  here  appears  more  in  line  with  the  sGMM 

results107.  Furthermore, the t-2 sGMM still seems over-identified, as does the 

t-3.  The  t-3  one-step  sGMM  estimate  also  falls  outside  of  the  WG-OLS 

band108 and generally the t-3 regressions return insignificant estimates. The t-

2 GMM estimates all return the expected negative first order autocorrelation, 

and no second order. The estimates on the Nikkeiscore and Nikkeiscore at t-1 

show  broadly  negative  point  estimates109,  which  is  as  expected  due  to  the 

direct costs of increasing environmental performance. The results for ROE are 

broadly similar to the results for ROA110 (see table 5.3). 

 

Due to the apparent biases of the dGMM estimators reflecting the persistence 

identified in the last chapter these are not reported in the following tables. The 

t-3  sGMM  is  only  reported  when  adding  it  removes  apparent  over-

identification  in  the  sGMM  or  it  returns  a  significant  estimate.  Whilst  the 

focus will be on the sGMM estimates, the OLS, WG, FM and wFM estimates 

are still kept for reasons of comparison. 

5.2 

Environmental performance: Leaders and Laggards  

The motivation to divide the sample into leaders and laggards, apart from the 

 

                                                 
107 This might reflect the fact the operating performance measures are less autoregressive. It is 
worth  noting  that  the  1-step  sGMM  estimator  here  appears  to  be  potentially  slightly 
negatively biased, returning estimates below the dGMM. 
108 Since R&D intensity is not part of the independent variables in either regression here the 
estimates are directly comparable. 
109  This  was  highlighted  in  model  3  of  chapter  3  which  showed  how  environmental 
improvements  often  involve  trading  current  costs  for  future  benefits.  To  the  extent  that  a 
positive effect exists, it seems we need a longer t-dimension than the one available here to 
explore this.  Again note the apparent downward bias on the dGMM estimators. 
110 The main difference being that the Sargan test here accepts the t-3 instruments, as opposed 
to  the  Dif-Sar  which  still  rejects.  Especially  the  one-step  t-3  coefficients  seem  improbably 
large however. The standard errors are large too.

need to achieve more homogenous sub-samples111, is based on the findings of 

Guenster  et  al  (2005)  who  report  an  asymmetrical  relationship  between 

environmental  performance  and  Tobin’s  Q112.  Constructing  dummies  based 

on  whether  firms’  eco-efficiency  ratings  are  high  or  low,  they  find  that 

whereas their high eco-efficiency dummy fails to provide evidence that high 

eco-efficiency  companies  have  higher  Tobin’s  Qs,  low  eco-efficiency  is 

significantly  associated  with  lower  Qs.  This  sort  of  relationship  says  little 

about  causality,  but  could  be  seen  to  strengthen  the  hypothesis  of  an 

association between environmental performance and institutional advantages 

or good management. The table below shows mean Tobin’s Q for the dataset 

as a whole, and firms whose Nikkeiscore is either below or above the sample 

average.

constructed  to  be  comparable  across  samples  however,  and  this  part  of  the  analysis  seeks  to  catch  ‘best  (worst)

The table indicates that a similar situation as the one described by Guenster et 

al  (2005)  can  be  found  in  our  dataset.  Higher  environmental  performance 

firms seem to have somewhat higher Qs and lower environmental performance 

                                                 
111 And the potential for rational differentiation as mentioned in chapter 3.

responsive to negative than positive news about a firm’s environmental performance. 

69
firms somewhat lower than the sample average. All scores are however well 

within one standard deviation of one another, so this is at best only indicative 

of a relationship. 

 

What drives these differences is important however. Although the sample as a 

whole is large and diverse, it is possible that it reflects external factors giving 

for  example  some  sectors  both  lower  Tobin’s  Qs  and  lower  environmental 

performance,  without  this  saying  anything  of  the  causality  between  the  one 

and  the  other.  As  of  December  2003,  the  number  of  ISO  14001-certified 

plants in Japan was 13,416, surpassing second-placed UK’s 5,460 (ISO 2004). 

The  number  of  companies  publishing  environmental  or  CSR  reports  also 

increased  from  169  in  1997  to  743  in  2003  (Japanese  Ministry  of  the 

Environment, 2004). The data we analyse therefore consists of relatively clean 

companies  operating  in  a  relatively  advanced  environmental  management 

environment. This means that the laggards we identify might not be laggards 

in a global context. It also means that the firms that are found to be laggards 

should have had the opportunity to improve their environmental performance 

had they wished to. 

  

There  is  not  enough  variation  amongst  firms  over  time  to  create  dummy 

variables for leaders and laggards and use them as controls in our regressions. 

Nevertheless,  tables  5.5  and  5.6  show  that  for  Tobin’s  Q  there  is  a  clear 

difference  in  the  estimated  coefficients  on  the  Nikkeiscore  depending  on 

whether the regressions are run on a leaders or laggards sub-sample. For the 

leaders  sub-sample  the  point  estimates  on  the  Nikkeiscore  are  positive,  and 

70
with the exception of the one-step t-2 sGMM and the WG estimates, positive 

and  significant113.  The  sGMM  estimators  also  return  weakly  negative  first 

order  autocorrelation  and 

for 

the 

t-3 

sGMM  no 

second  order 

autocorrelation114.  The  over-identification  tests  imply  that  the  additional 

instruments are invalid however.  

 

While  not  mentioned  before,  regressing ity ,  where ity represents  the  last 

observation in the time series, on 

i ty −Δ
, 1

 and all further relevant lags offers an 

alternative way to explore the validity of the sGMM instruments115. This was 

done for the leaders sub-sample and the lagged instruments were found to be 

significant  and  valid.  The  fact  that  the  sGMM  estimator  also  returns  a 

negative  first  order,  and  no  second  order  autocorrelation,  provides  further 

evidence  that  it  is  reasonably  well  specified.    All  in  all  there  is  quite  good 

evidence  here  that  for  the  leaders  sub-group,  the  effect  of  an  increase  in 

environmental performance on Tobin’s Q is positive. 

 

For the laggards sub-sample on the other hand the situation is less clear. Here 

most point estimates on the Nikkeiscore are negative116 and the t-3 one-step 

sGMM  estimate  negative  and  significant  at  the  10%  level117.  There  is 

evidence of over-identification in all sGMM estimations. However, when the 

                                                 
113 It is worth noting how much higher the two-step sGMM estimate is compared to the OLS, 
WG and one-step estimate. All the estimates share the same sign however.  
114 The m2 test is not available for the t-2 sGMM due to the slightly different set of control 
variables.  
115 This regression will be referred to as ‘
116 Or weakly positive. The most positive point estimate is that of the t-2 two-step sGMM. 
This estimation seems badly specified. It is potentially over-identified, outside the WG-OLS 
band and does not return negative first order autocorrelation.

’ regression discussed in the last section is run, the instruments are 

again found to be valid. Another point to note is that the sGMM estimations 

do not return a negative first order autocorrelation. It seems that all models are 

mis-specified to some degree in these regressions. However it is warranted to 

say that compared with the positive effects found in the leaders regressions, a 

neutral  to  negative  picture  emerges  for  the  laggards.  Whilst  this  does  not 

explain Guenster et al’s (2005) finding that lower eco-efficiency is related to 

lower  Tobin’s  Q  it  is  an  interesting  result.  What  we  see  is  that  for  leaders, 

increasing environmental performance increases Tobin’s Q, but that this is not 

the case for laggards. This is theoretically hard to explain, as one might expect 

laggards to have more latent gains to make than leaders. One hypothesis might 

be  that  markets  are  more  aware  and  trusting  of  environmental  information 

coming  from  leaders

118,  or  that  environmental  performance  information  is 

more  readily  available  for  high  performance  than  low  performance  firms. 

Another  hypothesis  might  be  that  the  markets  expect  there  to  be  less  gains 

from improving environmental management for firms that are historically low 

achievers,  possibly  because  they  do  not  expect  the  firms  to  have  the 

institutional 

framework 

needed 

to 

exploit

profit 

opportunities119.  The  results  above  could  be  indicative  of  such  effects,  but 

while this might merit more investigation, it is clear that no grand conclusions 

can be drawn here. The finding is puzzling more than it is enlightening.   

 

                                                 
118 Recall extension to model 1. 
119 These are obviously mere guesses. It seems to make some intuitive sense however that one 
might expect more gains from firms with a proven ‘environmental track record’. This also fits 
into  last  chapter’s  discussions  on  cognitive  institutions  and  Bleischwitz’s  (2003)  path 
dependency argument.  

72
For ROA and ROE the results are presented in tables 5.7 to 5.10. The leaders’ 

estimates here are more diverse but if we focus on the sGMM estimates these 

show negative effects of both Nikkeiscore at t and t-1 on ROA and ROE, but 

with  the  estimates  of  Nikkeiscore  at  t  on  ROA  being  the  only  significant 

ones120. The coefficients on 

ity all fall within the WG-OLS band and the m1 

and  m2  tests  seem  reasonable.  Again,  however,  there  is  evidence  of  over-

specification,  but  the  ‘

y

’  regression  accepts  the  instruments. 

Interestingly the coefficients on the lagged Nikkeiscore are much smaller than 

the  present,  indicating  a  diminishing  magnitude  effect  and  rendering  some 

support to the trade-off between current costs and future gains hypothesis.  

 

For laggards the situations is roughly similar, but the point estimates here are 

of  a  much  larger  magnitude121.  For  ROA  for  example,  the  two-step  sGMM 

Nikkeiscore at t estimate is -9.802*, indicating that an increase in the log of 

the  Nikkeiscore  of  one  point  lowers  ROA  by  9.8%.  For  the  laggards  the 

similar  coefficient  is  -15.384***.  This  corresponds  well  to  the  findings  on 

Tobin’s  Q  and  it  might  be  that  the  potential  to  cost-effectively  improve 

environmental performance is lower for laggards than leaders. Perhaps initial 

investments include more large scale changes such as the introduction of new 

managerial structures or changes in machinery, which once in place enables 

the firm to better take advantage of other environmental opportunities. Again 

this is an interesting finding but based on the evidence it is more suggestive 

                                                 
120 Note however the large standard errors of these regressions. These seem large for most 
regressions run on the operating performance measures in this analysis.  
121 Note also that the t-2 sGMM instrument set is accepted for laggards, but that the two-step 
estimator for ROA, and both one-step and two-step for ROE, fail to return a negative first 
order autocorrelation. These estimates should hence be treated with a degree of caution. 

73
than conclusive about such effects being part of a wider picture. Finally, seen 

in  conjunction  with  the  Tobin’s  Q  results,  indicating  that  markets  view  the 

environmental potential of leaders more positively than laggards, the findings 

might  also  reflect  a  degree  of  ex  ante  firm  level  differentiation  on 

environmental quality. Firms better able to exploit green profit opportunities 

will  invest,  and  become  our  leaders,  while  firms  less  capable  become  our 

laggards. 

5.3 

‘Environmental impact’ 

This  sub-sample  contains  sectors  which  were 

judged 

to  have  an 

environmentally intensive production. It includes chemicals, automotives, oil 

and  rubber,  steel,  machinery  and  other  manufacturing.  This  is  where  the 

clearest evidence of productive efficiency gains similar to those indicated in 

model 3 were hoped to be found122. Due to the efficiency gains rationale for 

analysing  this  sub-sample,  only  ROA  and  ROE  results  are  discussed  in  the 

following. It is on operating performance such an effect would be directly felt.  

 

Tables 5.11 and 5.12 report the results for ROA and ROE respectively.  The 

results  are  somewhat  encouraging.  Whilst  the  sGMM  instruments  are  still 

rejected123, the required autocorrelation structure is returned for ROA and the 

one-step estimates for 

i ty −  are within the WG-OLS band for both ROA and

ROE.  Whilst  the  point  estimates  vary  a  lot,  there  is  some  evidence  in  this 

sample of a positive relationship between Nikkeiscore at t-1 and profits. For

ROA  the  one-step  sGMM  returns  the  weakly  significant  coefficient  4.213*. 

For ROE positive point estimates are returned for all estimates apart from the 

WG  estimate.  While  the  estimates  vary,  and  significance  is  limited,  we  can 

say  that  from  the  evidence  here  it  seems  that  for  the  high  ‘environmental 

impact’  sub-sample,  effects  similar  to  those  modelled  in  model  3  do  exist. 

Increases  in  environmental  performance  might,  with  a  lag,  lead  to  higher 

profits. 

5.4 

‘Consumer exposure’ 

Due to gaps in the dataset, only t-2 GMM analysis is available for this sub-

sample.  Three  industrial  sectors  make  up  the  sample:  foods,  electronic 

equipment  and  automotives.  These  are  the  sectors  where  it  was  thought 

consumer pressures might be relatively more important. While it is clear that 

these divisions are very crude, and that other industries, such as the retail part 

of oil and rubber might also have a good claim to be part of the sample, it was 

thought that on a sectoral level the above three represented a bottom line of 

what  should  be  included.  The  rationale  for  constructing  a  ‘consumer 

exposure’ sub-sample reflects the logic of models 1 and 2 which looked at the 

potential of consumers to affect a firms’ environmental management outcome, 

linked  to  the  much  cited  reputation  driver  of  environmental  performance. 

Since  reputation  is  captured  directly  by  Tobin’s  Q  through  increased 

intangible  firm  value  only  the  potential  link  between  Tobin’s  Q  and  the 

environmental indicator is discussed here. Table 5.13 summarises the results. 

We see that all the sGMM estimators are within the required range and that all 

the  returned  coefficients  for  the  Nikkeiscore  are  positive.  The  one-step  t-2 

75
sGMM  Nikkeiscore  coefficient  is  also  significant  at  the  10%  level.    While 

seemingly  over-identified124  this  estimator  returns  a  weakly  negative  first 

order autocorrelation. There is some evidence here to support the reputation 

rationale for investing in environmental performance.  In consumer exposed 

sectors  at  least,  it  seems  that  the  market  reacts  positively  to  increases  in 

environmental performance. 

5.5 

Identifying the fixed effects: Environmental performance as a 

proxy for management quality? 

This  section  attempts  to  explicitly  investigate  the  firm  specific  institutional 

factors discussed in chapter 3. As argued in chapter 4, in a short t sample it 

might be plausible to assume these as approximately fixed and part of the 

iη 

in the regression models. Table 5.14 shows the results for regressions run on 

estimated  two-step  sGMM  fixed  effects125  from  the  Tobin’s  Q,  ROA  and 

ROE models, with Nikkeiscore at t, R&D intensity, total asset value and age 

of assets as control variables.

125 The control variables in the regression used to obtain the fixed effects vary slightly from 
the  normal  set  of  controls,  due  to  some  of  these  being  used  in  the  later  regressions  run 
specifically on the fixed effects. Nikkeiscore, R&D intensity and age of assets are hence not 
part of the controls, and sales is replacing total asset value as a proxy for size. Fixed effects 
were  also  identified  for  models  with  slightly  different  sets  of  controls  and  the  positive 
relationship still seemed to hold.  

76
The latter three controls were included as they have been shown to be related 

to the Nikkeiscore in order to avoid simultaneity bias. R&D intensity and age 

of assets might also themselves in some ways be related to the fixed effects126. 

The  results  are  both  clear  and  significant.  There  is  a  strong  positive 

relationship  between  environmental  performance  and  fixed  effects  in  these 

estimations. To the extent that these fixed effects include management quality 

or  institutional  responsiveness  this  hence  goes  quite  far  in  terms  of 

ascertaining that environmental performance might be a management quality 

proxy  as  argued  by  Guenster  et  al  (2005),  Innovest  and  others.  The  result 

might also be seen to support the claims made by Bleischwitz (2003), Blank 

and  Daniel  (2002)  and  others  that  good  environmental  management  does 

reflect the ability of a firm to rise above unknown challenges. While this, due 

to the lack of any direct causality, might matter relatively little for a manager 

trying to increase profits, it is clearly of interest to an investor, so long as the 

fixed  effects,  whatever  they  are,  are  related  to  firm  profitability.  It  is  worth 

noting  the  low  R2  scores  however,  indicating  that  the  controls  used  here 

explain relatively little of the overall variation in fixed effects. 

 

Furthermore,  before  drawing  any  conclusion  about  good  environmental 

performance as a proxy for good management we need to check whether there 

is  a  positive  relationship  between  the  fixed  effects  and  the  profitability 

estimators. Consequently, it might be appropriate to run a regression similar to 

the models discussed earlier in this chapter, but this time controlling for the 

fixed  effects  directly.    Before  running  such  a  regression  it  is  sensible  to 
                                                 
126 Whilst not reported in the table above the regressions show that age of assets is strongly 
and significantly negatively related to the fixed effects in this sample. 

77
evaluate a bit further what the fixed effects are likely to be capturing. In a T=5 

sample,  which  firm  specific  variables  are  likely  to  stay  reasonably  fixed? 

Should we a priori expect the fixed effects to capture good management, and 

hence expect increases in these effects to also increase profitability? What if 

one postulates that physical assets might be relatively fixed over a short time 

period?  To  the  extent  that  older  physical  assets  feed  back  into  lower 

profitability a negative relationship might be expected. However, as already 

noted in a footnote, age of assets was shown to be negatively correlated with 

the FEs in these regressions, and so a positive relation between the FEs and 

profitability remains our ex ante expectation.

As this table shows there is a significant and positive relationship between the

Concluding the empirical analysis 

This  chapter  has  presented  various  panel  data  regression  results  from 

regressions  run  on  Tobin’s  Q,  ROA  and  ROE  attempting  to  explore  a  link 

between these variables and environmental performance. It was hoped that by 

using  modern  panel  data  techniques,  explicitly  controlling  for  any  fixed 

effects  and  instrumenting  to  mitigate  other  sources  of  endogeneity,  the 

analysis would add to the existing literature by looking more directly at any 

causal relationship. In addition to this, we sought to establish, empirically, a 

link  between  environmental  performance  and  managerial  ability,  as 

represented by the fixed effects. 

 

The  results  were  interesting.  In  the  causal  analysis  no  clear  cut  conclusions 

could be drawn from the regressions run on the entire sample. This was not 

too surprising. Following the theoretical discussions and models in chapter 3 

we had established that the various effects potentially linking environmental 

performance  and  profitability  are  likely  to  be  heterogeneously  felt  across 

sectors.  For  the  regressions  run  on  ROA  and  ROE  another  potentially 

constraining factor was the short time dimension of our sample, meaning that 

any positive effects of increased environmental performance might not have 

enough  time  to  ‘make  itself  felt’.  We  saw  evidence  of  point  estimates  that 

diminished with time. 

 

79
When  the  sample  was  broken  into  smaller  sub-samples  according  to 

environmental  leader-  or  ‘laggardship’,  environmental  impact  and  consumer 

exposure, a richer set of results emerged. Firstly, mirroring earlier findings by 

Guenster  et  al  (2005)  it  seemed  that  environmental  laggards  have  lower 

Tobin’s  Qs  than  environmental  leaders.    Moreover,  in  regressions  run  on 

leaders  sub-sample  the  Tobin’s  Q  regressions  returned  significant  positive 

estimates:  environmental  performance  seemed  to  be  positively  related  to 

financial performance. No such clear picture emerged for laggards. Interesting 

too  was  to  note,  from  the  ROA  and  ROE  sGMM  regressions,  that  the 

magnitude of the instantaneous negative effect on operating performance for 

leaders appear to be about half that of laggards. This fact, combined with the 

above  point  that  the  market  takes  a  more  positive  view  of  environmental 

investments  made  by  leaders  than  by  laggards,  might  imply  that  what  we 

observe  is  ‘rational’  environmental  quality  product  differentiation  by  firms, 

due to some having much higher costs of instigating performance enhancing 

measures than others. 

 

For the environmental impact sub-sample it was hoped that we would see a 

less  ambiguous  link  between  the  accounting  based  measures  and  gains 

following  increased  environmental  performance.  The  link  was  hoped  to  be 

clearer  here  since  the  potential  for  eco-efficiency  savings,  as  modelled  in 

chapter 3, was expected to be more important128. This was the only sample 

analysed  for  this  thesis  where  the  t-1  estimates  on  the  Nikkeiscore  were 

                                                 
128  Model  2  also  implied  that  the  scope  for  consumer  fall-outs  due  to  environmental 
mismanagement might be lower here. 

80
unambiguously  positive129  and  so  the  eco-efficiency  hypothesis  came  out 

strengthened.  In  this  sub-sample  the  time  dimension  appeared  sufficient  to 

capture evidence of a lagged positive relationship between environmental and 

operating performance. 

 

For the consumer exposure sub-sample too the results were interesting. This 

sub-sample sought to look more directly at the reputation rationale for going 

green.  Here  a  range  of  positive,  and  for  the  one-step  sGMM  estimator, 

positive  and  significant,  coefficients  were  returned.  The  fact  that  these 

estimates are returned in what is judged to be a more consumer exposed sub-

sample  seems  to  imply  that  here  consumers  might  affect  the  environmental 

management outcome by ‘creating’ green profit opportunities. All in all the 

results from these two sub-samples seemed to complement and support some 

of the predictions of models 1, 2 and 3. 

 

Finally  the  most  definite  findings  of  this  empirical  analysis  came  from  the 

regressions  conducted  on  the  samples’  fixed  effects.  The  literature  has 

presented  good  theoretical  reasons  why  environmental  performance  might 

reflect some degree of firm specific institutional qualities, discussed in various 

detail in chapter 3. The literature has not however let the supposed existence 

of fixed effects be reflected by the choice of regression techniques used, let 

alone  by  attempts  to  identify  the  fixed  effects  and  specifically  establish  a 

relation. This chapter did just that and, while noting the low R2 scores, found 

the link to be positive and highly significant. It also found the fixed effects to 
                                                 
129Excluding the WG estimate for ROE. The ROA one-step sGMM was positive and weakly 
significant. 

81
be positively and significantly linked to all performance measures. Whilst this 

says  nothing  about  any  causality  between  environmental  performance  and 

profitability  it  sheds  some  more  light  on  a  much  discussed  and  interesting 

link,  and  provides  a  further  rationale  for  why  regressions  techniques 

controlling  for  any  fixed  effects  are  appropriate  in  any  attempt  of  causal 

analysis. In the absence of this, environmental performance might also proxy 

good  management  in  the  regression  analysis  –  and  so  the  direct  effects  of 

environmental performance per se are not captured.  

 

Overall we can say that the empirical chapters have added some new evidence 

to the theories discussed in the previous chapters. However, mis-specification 

seemed  to  be  part  of  the  story  in  most  regressions,  and  coefficients  on  the 

environmental  estimators  often  varied  strongly.  Consequently,  too  strong 

overall  conclusions  cannot  be  drawn  from  this  analysis.  The  results  are 

indicative of many interesting relationships, but by no means conclusive. 

 

The next chapter brings together and concludes the analysis of this thesis and 

presents some very broad policy recommendations.

Conclusion 

This  thesis  explored  the  much-debated  link  between  good  environmental 

management and corporate profitability. Although this was fundamentally an 

empirical  project,  the  empirics  built  on  a  reasonably  thorough  theoretical 

discussion.130  The  following  summarises  the  insights  gained  from  the 

theoretical  and  empirical  analysis,  and  presents  some  general  policy 

implications of this study within the wider context of contemporary applied 

environmental economics. 

6.1 

Theoretical insights 

Any  investigation  of  environmental  management  would  be  significantly 

incomplete  without  consideration  of  the  broader  CSR  literature,  since 

environmental  management  in  many  ways  are  driven  by  the  same  strategic 

arguments  as  CSR  more  generally.  The  CSR  literature  indicates  that 

increasingly, corporate success in modern society is enhanced by ‘enlightened 

profit maximisation’ (Jensen 2001). This includes exploring latent green profit 

opportunities. Therefore, a link between good environmental management and 

good  cognitive  corporate  institutions  could  be  expected  —  environmental 

performance might be a proxy for a firm’s ability to meet more general new 

strategic challenges. The asset management firm Innovest’s work in this area, 

also points in the proxy direction.  

 
                                                 
130  This  follows  Vogel’s  (2004)  call  for  empirical  work  based  on  testable  theoretical 
relationships. 

83
We  examined  two  key  rationales  for  the  view  that  improved  environmental 

performance leads to improved profitability — reputation and eco-efficiency. 

Three simple theoretical models were constructed to examine some important 

aspects  of  these  rationales.  Models  1  and  2  applied  simple  game  theory  to 

illustrate  some  of  the  issues  involved  in  any  reputation  argument  for 

increasing  environmental  performance.  They  indicate  that  the  existence  of 

green  profit  opportunities  depends  crucially  on  assumptions  about 

environmental  information  asymmetries  between  firms’  and  consumers,  the 

ability of consumers to credibly coordinate their actions to achieve a Pareto 

superior outcome and the actual environmental impact of a firm’s production. 

This  was  taken  to  imply  that  any  effects  of  environmental  performance  on 

overall  profits  was  likely  to  be  felt  heterogeneously  across  firms,  and 

supported  empirical  findings  by  Salo  (2005).    It  also  indicated  that  in  any 

empirical analysis, care should be taken to divide the data into sensible sub-

samples  reflecting  this  heterogeneity.  Model  3,  the  eco-efficiency  model, 

yielded some interesting, if rather obvious, results. An intertemporal version 

of  the  model  showed  how  environmental  investment  decisions  might  often 

trade current costs against future benefits and therefore that, ceteris paribus, a 

firms’  investment  in  environmental  performance  might  be  related  to  the 

management’s overall view of future earnings. We were again pointed in the 

direction of the ‘environmental performance as a proxy’ story.  

6.2 

Empirical results 

The  theorised  link  between  environmental  performance  and  managerial 

abilities  or  institutional  quality  had  important  implications  for  the  empirical 

84
analysis. It suggested that pooled OLS regressions would be biased due the 

correlation  with  the  unobserved  variables.  We  therefore  decided  to  also  run 

regressions  controlling  for  these  unobservables,  which  we  assumed  fixed  in 

the short run. Later, the techniques used to control for the fixed effects bias 

allowed  us  to  test  for  a  link  between  environmental  management  and 

managerial ability directly.  

 

Dynamic  GMM  methods  have  been  developed  to  produce  less  biased 

estimators  in  this  context.  A  dynamic  model  specification  also  allows  the 

researcher to model serial autocorrelation of an unknown form, which can be 

useful, even when the parameter estimate on the lagged dependent variable is 

not of primary interest to a study.  The dGMM and sGMM methods offer a 

way to control for other forms of endogeneity than that caused by the fixed 

effects, and so might further improve an attempt to do causal analysis131. The 

empirical chapters discussed the dGMM and sGMM methods in some detail, 

and also provided some useful tests and diagnostics which could be used to 

evaluate whether a given estimator seems reasonable or not.  

 

The regression results presented in chapter 5 used models based on the above 

techniques132.  Regression  equations  had  been  constructed  for  stock  market 

and  accounting  based  measures  of  corporate  profitability.  These  different 

                                                 
131 Recent critique by Koehler (2004) of the existing literature seemed to imply that to worry 
about endogeneity was appropriate. We feel that we have shown here, both theoretically and 
empirically, that there is a case for sGMM analysis to be applied in this context. It would be 
interesting to see the results of such methods used on other, more comprehensive datasets, for 
example using the Innovest Ecovalue21 indicator. 
132 And also for comparison, the FM and wFM techniques used by Guenster et al (2005). In 
our regressions these seem to have bad small sample qualities, which complements Skoulakis 
(2005) simulations. They also showed evidence of an upward bias. 

85
measures are useful in various ways and both were employed here in order to 

achieve a more comprehensive analysis. With respect to control variables, this 

thesis  ‘played  safe’  and  employed  sets  similar  to  the  most  recent  (and 

advanced) literature. 

 

The  regression  results  were  interesting.  As  the  theoretical  chapter  had 

indicated, there was scant evidence of an overall effect affecting the sample as 

a  whole.  However,  the  sub-samples  confirmed  some  expected  findings,  and 

also yielded some new insights. Similar to Guenster et al (2005) and Klassen 

and  McLaughlin  (1996)  we  found  that  any  relationship  between  good 

environmental  management  and  profits  is  asymmetrical,  and  affects  leaders 

and laggards in different ways. In this sample, leaders seem more able to reap 

the benefits of good environmental management, and this is appreciated by the 

market. 

 

By dividing the data into sectors deemed to be especially exposed to consumer 

pressures, or to have a particularly high environmental impact of production, 

we  approached  the  reputation  and  eco-efficiency  rationale  directly.  For  the 

consumer  exposure  group,  evidence  of  a  positive 

link  between 

the 

environmental  performance  indicator  and  Tobin’s  Q  was  found.  For  the 

environmental  impact  group  there  seemed  to  be  a  positive  relationship 

between 

the  accounting  based  measures  and 

lagged  environmental 

performance.  All  in  all  it  was  felt  that  the  reputation  and  eco-efficiency 

rationales came out strengthened in this analysis. 

 

86
Finally  evaluating  the  fixed  effects,  the  results  showed  a  significant 

relationship  between  environmental  performance  and  the  estimated  fixed 

effects of regressions run on all three performance indicators133. These fixed 

effects were also found to be positively correlated with firm profitability. To 

the extent that the fixed effects represent firm specific factors capturing the 

quality  of  management  and  institutions  this  supports  the  claim  that 

environmental performance might be a proxy for deeper variables related to 

how well a firm is run. The fact that such a link seemed to exist also seemed 

to ex post strengthen the case for the use of the modern panel techniques in the 

causal regression analysis. 

 

Overall  this  thesis  has  gone  some  way  in  ascertaining  both  a  causal  link 

between  good  environmental  management  and  profitability,  and  also  the 

proxy story, with a link between environmental performance and managerial 

quality.  It  has  however  also  theoretically  argued,  and  offered  empirical 

evidence  to  support  this,  that  such  a  link,  rather  than  being  general,  and 

affecting all firms, is likely to be sensitive and specific to different production 

and strategic contexts.  

 

Does being green increase profits?  

Based on the evidence here, in some circumstances, the answer is yes.  

                                                 
133 A low R2 was however reported in all estimations. 

87

Policy implications 

This  thesis  has  shown  that  one  cannot  automatically  assume  business  to  be 

taking  strides  towards  a  more  environmentally  ‘conscious  capitalism’. 

Environmental  microeconomics  cannot  be  fully  understood  outside  the 

context of the tragedy of the commons and diverging social and private costs. 

The  overarching  goal  of  environmental  microeconomic  policy  is  to  make 

firms  pay  the  full  social  cost  of  their  actions.  This  goal  is  generally  best 

achieved  through  taxation  or  regulation134.    When  Friedman  argues  that  the 

social responsibility of business is to maximise shareholder value, he is right, 

in  the  simple  world  of  no  externalities  of  production.  However  in  a  more 

realistic  case  the  invisible  hand  might  need  some  help,  as  markets  are  not 

efficient (Heal 2005). 

 

Corporate,  managerial  decisions  do  exert  externalities  on  the  environment 

(Tirole  2001).  Freeman  and  Liedka  (1991)  argue  that  a  conversation  about 

what  a  ‘commons-sensitive’  vision  of  capitalism  might  look  like  is  a  pre-

condition for linking corporations and the ‘good society’. As argued by Ruff 

(1970),  however,  there  is  no  inherent  link  between  ‘greedy  capitalism’  and 

pollution135.  In  a  market  where  all  externalities  are  internalised,  one  might 

expect the capitalist to also be a conservationist.  

 

As the models in chapter 3 showed, it is often the behaviour of customers 

                                                 
134  Regulation  or  taxes  would  change  the  firms’  benefits  and  costs  of  environmental 
investments and so could indeed induce various socially preferred outcomes. The risk of the 
government getting its regulation or taxation scheme wrong,  is always considerable. 
135 And experience from the USSR, China and Eastern Europe provide ample evidence that 
non-market economies do not fare very well in terms of protecting the environment. 

88
which eventually decide what is ‘good for business’ in terms of ‘amounts of 

CSR’.  It  seems  likely  that  both  coordination  problems  and  asymmetric 

information  play  an  important  role  in  determining  the  CSR  outcome.  This 

suggests  that  in  order  to  utilise  capitalism’s  powerful  dynamism  to  set  the 

world on track towards a more sustainable future, there might be a case for 

proactive  government  involvement  to  mitigate  these  coordination  and 

asymmetric information problems, provided the transaction costs from doing 

so  do  not  outweigh  the  social  benefits.  All  in  all  it  seems  that  a  sensible 

combination of regulation and information, for example aimed at highlighting 

the  full  social  costs  of  production,  ensuring  the  quality  of  environmental 

reports, or standardising eco-labels, might be beneficial136. Since whether or 

not a firm exploits a profitable green opportunity might come down to a lack 

of  appropriate  physical  and  cognitive  institutions,  information  and  support 

directed at firms might also be relevant. In a recent paper, Heal (2005) offers a 

fresh view of CSR which he sees as having evolved as  a response to market 

failures,  ‘a  Coasian  solution  to  the  problems  associated  with  social  costs’ 

(Heal  2005  :  1)137.  Efficient  Coasian  outcomes  are  often  blocked  by  high 

                                                 
136 This same conclusion is reached by Cason and Gangadharan (2004) who in a pioneering 
behavioural  experiment  conclude  that  ‘when  it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  environmental 
quality of goods in a market, consumers may hesitate to pay higher prices for products that 
might be environmentally superior. In this scenario of asymmetric information, our laboratory 
results  suggest  that  government  regulators  or  non-governmental  organizations  can  improve 
environmental performance by providing the option of certified green labelling’ (Cason and 
Gangadharan 2002 : 129) 
136  Coasian  since,  to  quote  Heal  (2005  :  7):  ‘in  cases  where  costs  are  externalized, 
corporations bargain with society about who will ultimately bear these costs. The corporation 
is not – currently – legally bound to bear them but society could change this if it wished, and 
indeed could go further and impose penalties for the past externalization of costs. The result is 
an implicit contract: society accepts the legal status quo provided that the corporation does not 
exploit it to society’s disadvantage.’  Interestingly the McKinsey Quarterly for January 2006 
report that global CEOs think the public will expect corporations to take a significant role in 
handling increasing socio-political pressures. 
 
 

89
transaction  costs.  Also  from  this  point  of  view,  government  intervention  to 

improve transparency seems important. 

 

To the extent that economics is a theory of scarcity, the free market economy 

cannot be expected to do much to solve environmental challenges until these 

challenges  are  firmly  incorporated  in  the  market.  In  a  less  complex  world 

what  is  needed  might  be  the  enclosure  of  the  commons.  The  merits  of  the 

privatisation  of  all  environmental  assets  obviously  provide  enough  material 

for a thesis in its own right.138 It suffices to conclude here that to the extent 

that we are moving towards a more ‘environmentally conscious’ future, and 

this  is  reflected  by  increasing  demands  made  by  society  on  business,  it  is 

reasonable to assume that the returns to being green tomorrow might be higher 

than  today139.  Governments  have  an  important  supporting  role  to  play  as  a 

provider  of  the  information,  regulation  and  incentives  needed  to  create  a 

society  more  geared  at  exploiting,  and  increasingly  enhancing,  green  profit 

opportunities. 

 
 

 

 

 

                                                 
138  Or rather several books in economics and political philosophy. 
139 That this is happening is argued by Esty (2005) who declares that  ‘the long term trend, in 
any  country,  is  to  implement  the  polluter  pays  principle  and  thus  internalize  externalities 
consistent with allocative efficiency and demands of justice’ (Esty 2004 : 139) This view is 
shared  by  business  too.  As  James  E.  Rogers  CEO  of  Cinergy  Corporation  puts  it  in  an 
interview  with  BusinessWeek:  ‘Forget  the  science  debate.  The  regulations  will  change 
someday. And if we're not ready, we're in trouble.’ (BusinessWeek 2005)
