Green innovation has currently been receiving a great deal of international attention because of the
growing concern of consumers, governments, and the community as a whole with regard to the
degradation of natural resources and environmental pollution. The automotive sector is one of the
leading generators of industrial waste that affect the quality of the natural environment. This study aims
to investigate the determinants of green innovation adoption and its effect on ﬁrm performance. Data
were gathered by surveying 153 ﬁrms in the Malaysian automotive supply chain industry. Data were
analyzed using the partial least squares technique. Environmental regulations, market demand, and ﬁrm
internal initiatives have a positive effect on green innovation initiatives (GII), while GIIs have a positive
effect on the three categories of sustainable performance (i.e., environmental, social, and economic).
These results have important implications for designing strategic plans for the Malaysian automotive
industry.

1. Introduction

The automotive industry, with its supporting supply chain, is the
largest industry in the world and employs more than 10% of the
total workforce. With growing concerns about global warming and
social issues, the automotive supply chain industry is confronted
with increased pressure from stakeholders and regulatory agencies
to achieve sustainability. As a developing nation, Malaysia
increasingly emphasizes economic development while maintaining
environmental and social protection. These pressures have created
a challenge for companies to balance economic, environmental, and
social performances (Shultz and Holbrook, 1999). Consequently, the
Malaysian automotive industry and its supply chains seek to bal-
ance its economic, environmental, and social performances. For any
company to survive these challenges, innovative strategies should
be devised to ensure a sustainable competitive edge while

satisfying all requirements from stakeholders and regulatory
agencies (Olugu et al., 2011). Therefore, the automotive industry in
developing countries, along with its supporting supply chain, has
moved to adopt green innovations.

The Economist (2008) highlighted mass production, the Toyota
production system, lean production, just-in-time, and modular
consortium as important innovations from the production system
perspective in the automotive industry over the last 30 years. A
strong focus on these innovations has decreased costs, which has
reduced prices and diluted market saturation and predatory price
competition with low proﬁt margins. Nevertheless, automotive
companies cannot rely on these beneﬁts alone as the rules of
competition have changed (Katayama and Bennett, 1996), and the
pressure to adopt environmentally friendly processes and green
products is increasing. Therefore, green innovation is essential.
However, the effect of green innovation initiatives (GII) on sus-
tainable performance as core competencies of ﬁrms has not been
paid much attention to and is rarely focused on in the automotive
industry. This study investigates the effect of GII on sustainable
performance (i.e., environmental, social, and economic) to ﬁll this
gap. In addition, several studies pertaining to the determinants of

GII have been conducted in various industries, including logistics
(Lin and Ho, 2008), manufacturing (Guoyou et al., 2013; Zhu et al.,
2012), and IT (Wu, 2013). Nevertheless, the understanding of the
determinants of GII that automotive companies should adopt re-
mains a high-priority research issue (Chen et al., 2006), particularly
in developing countries. To the best of our knowledge, market de-
mand is the only factor that affects GII, according to previous
studies conducted on the automotive industry (Lin et al., 2014). This
study aims to explore the determinants of GII for ﬁrms in the
automotive supply chain. These determinants should be fully un-
derstood to ensure that automotive managers could enhance green
innovation adoption. Success in GII provides new opportunities for
competition and “winewin” situations by lessening the environ-
mental effect of automotive supply chain companies while
improving their economic position.

2. Model conceptualization and hypothesis development

Kemp and Pearson (2008) deﬁned green innovation as the
production, assimilation, or exploitation of a product, production
process, service, or management/business methods that is novel to
the organization that develops or adopts them; it signiﬁcantly re-
duces environmental risks, pollution, and other negative effects on
resource use (including energy use) throughout its life cycle.
Similarly, Wong et al. (2013) suggest that green innovation facili-
tates the reduction of the environmental impact of ﬁrms, which
allows them to achieve eco-targets and incorporate environmental
beneﬁts. Green innovation aims to systematically align and
implement this strategy throughout the supply chain from new
product and service development to consumption (Jones et al.,
2008).

Green innovation is classiﬁed into three main categories: green
product innovation, green process innovation, and green manage-
ment innovation (Chen et al., 2006; Chen, 2008). We examine green
product and process innovation in the current study. Chen et al.
(2006) identiﬁed green product innovation as the introduction of
new or signiﬁcantly improved products in response to environ-
mental concerns (e.g., non-toxic raw materials, green design, en-
ergy savings, pollution prevention, waste recycling, and waste
minimization). Green process innovation refers to modifying
manufacturing processes and systems to produce environmentally
friendly products that meet eco-targets (e.g., energy savings,
pollution prevention, and waste recycling) (Meeus and Edquist,
2006; Kammerer, 2009).

The automotive industry has made remarkable contributions to
the world economy and people's mobility, but its products and
processes are signiﬁcant sources of environmental impact (Nunes
and Bennett, 2010). Given that automobiles cause major environ-
mental impacts upon use, the environmental impacts of the auto-
mobile manufacturing process should be explored (Keoleian et al.,
1997; Graedel and Allenby, 1997). The application of environ-
mental pressures reduces emissions and waste throughout vehicle
production, use, and end-of-life. These pressures come in the form
of stringent, complex, and costly regulations and demands from a
growing number of stakeholders for improved environmental
performance (Geffen and Rothenberg, 2000). Continuous innova-
tion is vital to overcoming pressures from customers, competitors,
and regulators (Porter and van der Linde, 1995). In the past, most
automotive companies considered environmental compliance an
additional production cost instead of considering it a fundamental
process to prevent negative environmental impacts. However, strict
environmental regulations and environmentalists have changed
the competitive rules and patterns for companies. The increasing
costs of traditional modes of compliance and advances in material
and process technologies have driven some automotive supply

chain companies to adopt green innovative approaches to over-
come environmental challenges (Richards and Pearson, 1998).

Several studies have been conducted on the determinants of GII.
A summary of 25 studies on key determinants of GII is provided in
Appendix I. The occurrences and percentages for each type of green
innovation key determinants (Appendix I) are as follows: regula-
tions (68%), market demand (40%), ﬁrm internal initiatives (68%),
technological capability (8%), competitive advantage (8%), and
customer beneﬁt (4%). Regulations are the most studied, followed
by ﬁrm internal initiatives and market demand. Therefore, these
three factors are identiﬁed as the key determinants of GII and
examined in the present study.

Numerous empirical ﬁndings conﬁrm a positive relationship
between green innovation and ﬁrm performance (Lau et al., 2010).
Green innovation is closely associated with corporate environ-
mental management and eco-target achievement; therefore, green
innovation is widely believed to stimulate environmental perfor-
mance (Chen et al., 2006; Kammerer, 2009). Green product and
process innovation not only reduce negative environmental impact,
but they also increase the economic and social performance of a
company through waste and cost reduction (Kleindorfer et al.,
2005). Companies implement green process innovation in the
manufacturing process to shorten production time and reduce
costs (Lambertini and Mantovani, 2009). In addition, a good prod-
uct innovation improves market position, afﬁrms brand name,
leapfrogs competition, creates breakthroughs, and attracts new
customers (Chandy and Tellis, 2000; Mu et al., 2009). Therefore,
three performance types (i.e., environmental, social, and economic)
are considered the beneﬁts and outcomes of GII.

Fig. 1 presents the proposed theoretical model to investigate the
effect of the three identiﬁed key determinants of GII on Malaysian
automotive supply chain companies. This study also investigates
the effect of GII on environmental, economic, and social perfor-
mances. The control variables selected for this framework are
ownership, size, and ISO certiﬁcation.

2.1. Environmental regulations

clear

solutions,

requirement

speciﬁcations,

Environmental regulations include stringency, ﬂexibility, real-
istic objectives or adequate timeframes for implementing innova-
tive
and
appropriateness to a country's circumstances (Eiadat et al., 2008).
Firms that belong to more regulated industries will tend to include
more environmental issues in their management strategies than
less regulated ﬁrms (Lopez-Gamero et al., 2010). Porter and van der
Linde (1995) claimed that strict environmental regulations and the
associated compliance costs could force industries to adopt inno-
vative measures to increase resource efﬁciency and enhance pro-
ductivity. Government environmental regulations could overcome

for

concepts

organizational inertia and cause organizations to accept new ideas,
stimulate creative thinking, upgrade outdated facilities, and invest
in technological improvements (Eiadat et al., 2008). According to
other studies, environmental regulations signiﬁcantly encourage
ﬁrms to invest in non-polluting technologies and to consider
environmental
their products and processes
(Fergusson and Langford, 2006; Blayse and Manley, 2004; Qi et al.,
2010). Two recent studies that analyzed the effect of regulatory
stringency on green innovation in Switzerland and Germany pre-
sented contradictory results: Although regulatory stringency
positively affects green innovation in the chemical and pharma-
ceutical industry (Seijas-Nogareda, 2007), it has no such effect in
the food and beverage industry (Engels, 2008). These conﬂicting
ﬁndings may be due to industry characteristics, which makes
investigating the effect of environmental regulations in various
industries important. Therefore, the present study hypothesizes
that.

H1. Environmental regulations have a positive effect on GII in
automotive supply chain companies.

2.2. Market demand

Market demand is a key to business success. For automotive
companies to continuously respond to customer requirements and
changing expectations, market orientation is essential (Kirca et al.,
2005; Zhou et al., 2009). Zhou et al. (2005) stated that customers
become sensitive and selective over time. Hence, ﬁrms should
understand their target customers and anticipate their changing
preferences to promptly meet market demand and gain competi-
tive advantage (Desarbo et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2009). Several
studies conducted on the automotive industry observe an
increasing trend in environmental concern among customers (Oltra
and Saint Jean, 2009; Lin et al., 2013) and emphasize the emergence
of “green customers.” Therefore, a green market forces automotive
ﬁrms to produce and adopt innovative products and processes,
respectively.

Green market demand is important in the spread of green
innovation (Halila and Rundquist, 2011; Triebswetter and
Wackerbauer, 2008). Chiou et al. (2011) identiﬁed an increasing
number of environmentally conscious customers who prefer fuel-
efﬁcient and environmentally friendly products. Environmentally
conscious customers demand innovative green products and are
willing to pay high prices for green products (Chen, 2008). Conse-
quently, green product and process innovation is proﬁtable for
automotive supply chain companies. Thus, the following hypothe-
sis is developed:

Technology accumulation, organizational encouragement, human
resource quality, and top management support also inﬂuence the
adoption of green innovation (Lin and Ho, 2008; Bansal, 2003). A
company with high human resource quality (e.g., superior educa-
tion or training) has high innovation ability. Top management is
important in organizational support (Zailani et al., 2014). Therefore,
top management is expected to develop the environmental inno-
vation strategy of ﬁrms (Eiadat et al., 2008). Consequently, ﬁrm
internal initiatives inﬂuence the adoption of green innovation.
Hence, the following hypothesis is developed:

H3. Firm internal initiatives have a positive effect on GII in auto-
motive supply chain companies.

2.4. Sustainable performance

Sustainability is important to organizations in the twenty-ﬁrst
century (Presley et al., 2007). Robins (2006) categorized sustain-
ability into three primary components, which are often referred to
as the triple bottom line: economic, social, and environmental.
Organizations are pressured by multiple stakeholders to achieve
sustainable performance (McMullen, 2001). Organizations are
becoming increasingly aware that choices made with regard to
products and processes affect environmental and social perfor-
mance (Sarkis, 2001). Thus, organizational decision makers are
overwhelmed by a plethora of stakeholder issues, environmental
agency pressures, and increased social consciousness from workers,
consumers, and communities; these conditions should be balanced
to ensure a reasonable return on investment and long-term en-
terprise viability for organizational stakeholders (Presley et al.,
2007).

Pollution results from inefﬁcient use of resources by automotive
suppliers, and they can increase their productivity through green
innovation to shoulder environmental costs (Chen et al., 2006;
Porter and van der Linde, 1995). Porter and van der Linde (1995)
argued that companies that pioneer green innovation have the
ﬁrst-mover advantage, which allows them to charge relatively high
prices for their green products and obtain competitive advantages.
Moreover, ﬁrms that apply environmental management not only
avoid the hassle of protests or penalties regarding environmental
protection, but also improve their corporate image, develop new
markets, and increase their competitive advantages (Presley et al.,
2007). Moreover, companies could innovatively embody the
green concept in their products and processes to differentiate their
products from competitors (Chen et al., 2006; Hart, 1995; Porter
and van der Linde, 1995). Hence, the following hypotheses are
developed:

H2. Market demand has a positive effect on GII in automotive
supply chain companies.

H4. GII has a positive effect on economic performances of auto-
motive supply chain companies.

2.3. Firms' internal initiatives

According to a resource-based viewpoint, the internal charac-
teristics of ﬁrms (e.g., strategy, structure, and core capabilities) are
important determinants of innovation (Fagerberg et al., 2005).
Resources are classiﬁed into tangible (e.g., ﬁnancial reserves),
intangible (e.g., reputation), and personnel (e.g., culture, training)
(Barney, 1991). With regard to the innovation aspect, the most
important asset of ﬁrms is its general commitment to innovation.
R&D units are tools for solving organizational problems. R&D
expenditure is a common proxy for and closely related to ﬁrm
innovation activity (Sanchez, 1997). Rehfeld et al. (2006) indicated
that R&D activities positively inﬂuence green product innovation.

H5. GII has a positive effect on environmental performances of
automotive supply chain companies.

H6. GII has a positive effect on social performances of automotive
supply chain companies.

2.5. Control variables

This study considers the following variables, which may affect
the results of the study: ﬁrm ownership, number of employees
(ﬁrm size), and ISO certiﬁcation status. These variables are chosen
because they have signiﬁcant effects. Large ﬁrms are more inno-
vative than small ﬁrms because the former has more resources and
capital than the latter (Lee and Ging, 2007; Damanpour, 1996). Firm

ownership (local or foreign) also inﬂuences innovation but not for
small and medium enterprises (Lee and Ging, 2007). Firms with ISO
certiﬁcation are more involved in green initiatives than ﬁrms
without ISO certiﬁcation because of the required certiﬁcation
standards.

3. Research methodology

3.1. Measure of constructs

This study employed a quantitative survey with a structured
questionnaire. The questionnaire had ﬁve sections with a total of 53
items: company basic information, GII (green product and process
innovation), determinants of GII (regulations, marketing demand,
and ﬁrm internal initiatives), sustainable performance (environ-
mental, economic, and social performances), and respondents'
personal information. Except for basic company information and
respondents' personal information, the items were measured by
using the 5-point Likert scales anchored by “strongly disagree” and
“strongly agree.” The items were adapted from previous studies to
ensure content validity. The scale for environmental regulation was
adapted from Eiadat et al. (2008), Eltayeb (2008), Lin and Ho
(2008), and Zhu et al. (2007); the scale for market demand and
ﬁrm internal initiatives was adapted from Horbach (2008), Michel
et al. (2001), Kammerer (2009), Lin and Ho (2008), and Eiadat
et al. (2008); the scales for green product and process innovation
were measured using items based on Chen et al. (2006); and the
scale for economic, environmental, and social performance was
adapted from Rao (2002), Chen et al. (2006), Zhu et al. (2007),
Kassinis and Soteriou (2003), and Carter (2005).

3.2. Data collection and the sample

The sampling frame consists of all ﬁrms in the Malaysian
automotive supply chain industry, which includes ﬁrms that pro-
duce raw materials, components, vehicles, and spare parts. This
study focuses on the Malaysian automotive industry for the
following reasons: (1) the automotive industry with its supporting
supply chain is one of the most important, strategic, and fast-
growing industries in Malaysia. The huge potential effect of GII on
sustainable performance of automotive companies makes investi-
gating the determinants of GII necessary; (2) the automotive in-
dustry is one of the main pollution sources in Asia; and (3) several
automotive companies worldwide take advantage of component
manufacturers in Asia to beneﬁt from low production costs. The
successful implementation of GII allows component manufacturers
to attract additional international automotive companies.

The sampling list is obtained from the website of the Malaysian
Automotive Association. Malaysia currently has four passenger and
commercial vehicle manufacturers, namely, Proton, Perodua, Naza,
and Modenas. Moreover, the country has nine motor vehicle as-
semblers and 343 components or parts manufacturers. The total
number of ﬁrms on the list is 356. Given our small sampling frame
and low response rate from the mail survey (Sekaran, 2003), the
survey questionnaire was sent to all ﬁrms.

This study targeted engineers, manufacturing managers, oper-
ation managers, production managers, quality managers, executive
directors, and managing directors of Malaysian automotive com-
panies; they were chosen as our respondents because they are
directly involved in the process, which makes them knowledgeable
and experienced in all operations and activities in their respective
companies. The survey was conducted using a structured mail
questionnaire directed to the corresponding respondent in each
ﬁrm. A total of 153 usable responses were received out of the 356
distributed questionnaires.

3.3. Analysis

The casual relationships between constructs were analyzed
through structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM analysis was
chosen over regression analysis, because SEM can analyze all paths
in a single analysis (Gefen et al., 2000; Hair et al., 2013). Partial least
squares (PLS) approach was selected because of its small size re-
quirements and the exploratory nature of the research (Hair et al.,
2011). SmartPLS M3 Version 2.0 (Ringle et al., 2005) was used for
the analysis. The sample size of 153 exceeded the minimum sample
requirements recommended by Wixom and Waston (2001). Ac-
cording to the procedure of Hulland (1999), PLS is analyzed and
interpreted in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the measurement
model has to be tested by performing validity and reliability ana-
lyses on each measure to ensure that only reliable and valid
construct measures are used prior to making conclusions about the
nature of construct relationships (Hulland, 1999). In the second
stage, the structural model is tested by estimating the paths be-
tween model constructs to determine their signiﬁcance and the
predictive ability of the model.

4. Results

4.1. The sample

The discriminant analysis shows that 41.2% of the respondent
ﬁrms are locally owned, 36.6% are foreign based, and 22.2% are joint
ventures (local and foreign). For the ISO certiﬁcation status, 92.2%
of the respondent ﬁrms are ISO certiﬁed, and 7.8% are not ISO
certiﬁed. Common ISO certiﬁcations in the Malaysian automotive
supply chain are ISO/TS16949, ISO14000, and ISO9001. An exami-
nation of the number of employees indicates that respondents are
mostly large companies with more than 200 employees (75.2%),
and more than half of the ﬁrms have annual sales turnovers of more
than RM200 million (65.4%).

4.2. Common method variance

According to Podsakoff and Organ (1986), common method bias
is problematic when a single latent variable accounts for the ma-
jority of the explained variance. The unrotated factor analysis re-
sults indicate that the ﬁrst normalized linear combination explains
only 28.55% of the total 82.62% variance, which proves that com-
mon method bias is not a serious problem in the study.

4.3. Measurement model results

The reliability and validity of the reﬂective constructs were
assessed. Composite reliability (CR) is assessed in connection with
internal reliability, which is similar to Cronbach's alpha. Table 1
shows that CR of all constructs was above 0.7, which satisﬁes the

rule of thumb in Hair et al. (2013, 2010) suggested accepting items
with loadings of at least 0.6. Given that the loadings associated with
each scale were all greater than 0.6, individual item reliability was
reasonably judged. Convergent validity was evaluated using
average variance extracted (AVE). The AVE of all constructs was
above 0.5, which signiﬁes a satisfactory degree of convergent val-
idity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).

Two approaches were used to assess the discriminant validity of
constructs. First, the cross loadings of indicators were examined. No
indicator loads were higher than an opposing construct (Hair et al.,
2012). Second, according to the Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion,
the square root of AVE for each construct should exceed the in-
tercorrelations of the construct with other model constructs
(Table 2). Both analyses conﬁrmed the discriminant validity of all
constructs.

Table 2 shows that although Malaysian automotive supply chain
companies have experienced great pressure from market demand
(mean ¼ 3.90), a lack of pressure has been observed from envi-
ronmental regulation (mean ¼ 3.24). Automotive companies have
good internal initiatives, including environmental management
system, top management support, and R&D budget allocation
(mean ¼ 4.00), which support the development of green product
and process innovation. Although the green product innovation
rate is satisfactory (mean ¼ 3.75), the green process innovation rate
lags (mean ¼ 3.35). Finally, all sustainable performances are high
among automotive companies.

The reﬂectiveereﬂective second-order construct of GII is char-
acterized by green product and process innovation. We assign all
indicators from ﬁrst-order to second-order constructs using the
repeated indicators approach to establish the second-order con-
structs. Table 3 shows that the same measurement model evalua-
tion criteria is applied to the GII construct, and validity and
reliability are well established.

4.4. Assessment of the structural model

The measurement model had satisfactory results, and the
structural model was evaluated subsequently. The predictive ac-
curacy of the model was evaluated in terms of the explained vari-
ance portion. The results suggest that the model is capable of
explaining 60.6% of the variance in GII, 28.6% in economic perfor-
mance, 28.6% in environmental performance, and 23.4% in social
performance. Aside from estimating the magnitude of R2, predictive
relevance developed by Stone (1974) and Geisser (1975) is included
as additional model ﬁt assessments. This technique indicates the
ability of the model to predict the manifest indicators of each latent
construct. StoneeGeisser Q2 (cross-validated redundancy) was
computed to examine predictive relevance using a blindfolding
procedure in PLS. Following the guidelines of Chin (2010), Q2 value
greater than zero implies that the model has predictive relevance.
The present study obtained 0.213 for average cross-validated
redundancy (for all endogenous variables), which is far greater

than zero. Thus, the model exhibited acceptable ﬁt and high pre-
dictive relevance. Nonparametric bootstrapping was applied
(Wetzels et al., 2009) with 5000 replications to test the structural
model. Table 4 presents the structural model that resulted from PLS
analysis. All paths were signiﬁcant, and the hypotheses were sup-
ported. The strength of the effect of determinants on GII was
investigated by the effect size (f2) (Hair et al., 2013). A notable detail
is that the internal initiatives of ﬁrms have the highest effect on GII
(f2 ¼ 0.465), followed by environmental regulations (f2 ¼ 0.414),
and marketing demand (f2 ¼ 0.218).

5. Discussion and implications

According to a literature review, the Malaysian automotive
supply chain is still in its developing stages and has signiﬁcant
negative environmental impacts. Therefore, GII should be pursued
aggressively to accommodate the current environmental situation.
Green innovation is a good approach for the automotive supply
chain to adopt. Understanding the determinants of GII is essential
to automotive supply chain ﬁrms. Some studies have examined the
motivation and driving forces of GII but do not focus on the auto-
motive supply chain industry. Thus, this study investigates the
determinants of GII. The beneﬁts of adopting GII in manufacturing
ﬁrms have been explained to some extent. However, some man-
agers remain unconvinced in adopting green innovation. Thus, this
study determines the potential positive effects of GII on simulta-
neous ﬁrm economic, social, and environmental performances.
Several motivations drive automotive supply chain companies to
adopt green innovation. Environmental regulations, marketing
demands, and ﬁrm internal initiatives are the major factors that

positively affect the adoption of green innovation by Malaysian
automotive supply chain ﬁrms.

Our ﬁndings on the relationship between environmental regu-
lation and GII are consistent with those of Fergusson and Langford
(2006) and Qi et al. (2010), who found that stringent environmental
regulations may promote green innovation. The Malaysian national
automotive policy has not taken action with regard to the envi-
ronmental impact of the automotive industry development. Di-
rectives or legislations on end-of-life vehicles for the automotive
industry have yet to be established (Amelia et al., 2009). Therefore,
the Malaysian government should set environmental regulations
with stringent standards for the automotive industry. Market de-
mand is also an important factor for green innovation adoption, a
ﬁnding that agrees with that of Lin et al. (2014); a positive rela-
tionship exists between market demand and GII for automotive
companies in Taiwan. Malaysian customers' concern about envi-
ronmental issues has increased dramatically. In addition, with the
increasing petrol prices in Malaysia, petrol consumption will play
an important role in the selection of a new vehicle. Automotive
companies that align these requirements with innovative green
products and processes meet customer demand well and outper-
form their competitors. The internal initiatives of ﬁrms are also
signiﬁcantly related to GII. The successful implementation of GII is
assured with adequate technology, human capital, environmental
management systems, practices, and tools to support green
innovation.

The results also showed that ﬁrms support the principles of
institutional theory and respond to external inﬂuences, such as
regulations and market demand, in their adoption of GII, although
they do so in different manners. Overall, the study found that co-
ercive pressure (regulations) inﬂuences, more than normative
(market demand) ones, suggest that more stringent environmental
regulations improve the adoption of green innovation initiatives.
Generally speaking, this ﬁnding is consistent with a previous study
on the importance of environmental regulation (especially moni-
toring and enforcement) in GII (Qi et al., 2010; Kammerer, 2008,
2009; Eiadat et al., 2008). Among the three determinants, the in-
ternal initiative of ﬁrms has the greatest effect on GII. Internal re-
sources signiﬁcantly induce ﬁrms to initiate green innovation and
gain advantage over other ﬁrms. Market demand and environ-
mental regulations do not promote GII without adequate internal
initiatives. A company with high-quality professional development,
such as better education or training, will be more capable of green
innovation (Lin and Ho, 2008).

The literature highlights several beneﬁts that can arise from
integrating green innovation into product development and busi-
ness processes: increased efﬁciency in the use of resources, return
on investment,
increased sales, development of new markets,
improved corporate image, product differentiation, and enhanced
competitive advantage (FrajeAndre et al., 2009; Pujari et al., 2003;
York, 2009; Dangelico and Pujari, 2010). Chen et al. (2006) found
that the performance of both green product and green process
innovation is positively correlated to competitive advantage. The
present study observed that GII signiﬁcantly affects the environ-
mental, economic, and social performance of automotive com-
panies. This ﬁnding indicates that the adoption of green product
and process innovation allows Malaysian automotive supply chain
companies to improve their economic, social, and environmental
performance. The results suggest that GII may lead to a winewin
situation so that the environmental, social, and economic perfor-
mances of ﬁrms improve simultaneously. Companies should design
green innovative products and adopt green innovative processes to
achieve sustainable development. The implication of this ﬁnding
for automotive ﬁrms' managerial groups is the discovery that the
practice of green innovation in the ﬁrms' environment can obtain

an economic advantage for the ﬁrms. This condition will help to
improve the competitive advantage of the ﬁrms in the market and
at the same time contribute to their environmental and social
performance, which will further help to improve the image and
reputation of ﬁrms.

In terms of theoretical contribution, this study is the ﬁrst to
investigate the determinants of GII in the Malaysian automotive
supply chain industry. This sector is particularly important because
it is a fast-growing industry with a signiﬁcant effect on the envi-
ronment. Although a few studies have explored the effect of GII on
environmental and economic performances of automotive com-
panies, the effect of GII on social performance has rarely been
investigated. Social image is essential to companies to improve
their market position, afﬁrm the reputation of their brand, and
attract customers.

This study provides several implications for policymakers and
managers in the automotive supply chain industry. Recognizing the
determinants of GII will help policymakers to understand the fac-
tors that lead to green innovation adoption in the automotive
supply chain industry. Consequently, they could adjust their stra-
tegies and policies to motivate automotive company managers to
adopt green innovation. Moreover, this understanding can help
managers successfully promote GII in their companies. This study
also identiﬁes the signiﬁcance of the effect of GII on sustainable
performance. Thus, the study advances knowledge on the beneﬁts
of GII adoption for managers of automotive companies.

6. Limitations and future studies

This study has certain limitations that should be taken into ac-
count prior to generalizing its results. First, the study tested and
veriﬁed the hypotheses using a questionnaire survey but provided
only a cross-section of the study in nature. Therefore, this approach
limits the ability to imply causality in the relationships among
variables. Thus, the survey results are affected by the fact that this
study cannot observe the dynamic changes of green innovation in
the development process of the automotive logistic industry in
Malaysia. A longitudinal study that examines the relationships for
an extended period of time should be performed to provide precise
results. Furthermore, the sample population is limited to the
automotive supply chain. Other industries that wish to apply the
ﬁndings of this study should be conscious of the effect of de-
terminants and performances, which may vary with the types of
industries. This study also used a survey sample limited to the
Malaysian automotive supply chain. However, the maturity of a
certain technology and decision process for adopting a technology
may vary between countries. Future research should test the
research model in different industries and countries. The study
should also be conducted in different regions of the country for data
comparison and to obtain additional information.
