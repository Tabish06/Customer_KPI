Abstract The economic development of high-tech industries in Taiwan focuses on IC de-
sign, opt electrics, semiconductors, computer science and telecommunication. It is necessary
for business to understand the relations and signiﬁcance of the economic performance to take
the responsibility and keep a positive corporate image, thus they can earn more admiration
and trust from customers. How do they take the social responsibility to improve their corpo-
rate image and create the economic performance, and ﬁnally reach the top one of the whole
world? This study discusses the subject concerning the continuing development of business
and relevant issues stated above. We found that 68.1% of high-tech industries in Taiwan are
in accordance with business ethics and norms of conduct. Businesses take their responsibility
practically by participating in public welfare activities. The more responsibilities they fulﬁll;
the better image they have. High-tech industries should target the social responsibility as their
ﬁrst goal and secondly improve their corporate image to increase the economic performance.

1 Introduction

For the appeal and pressure to continue development, globalization, increasing fame and
taking responsibility from outside, the international community promotes the overseas in-
vestment criterion for business to take Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) universally
and it has become the determinant to be an excellent MNC or not. The main subjects of CSR

includes: environmental protection, worker and human rights, community participation, pu-
blic welfare, supply chain management (SCM), and so on.

The practice of CSR develops according to the times. In the initial stage of industrialization,
CSR is interested in gaining proﬁts for stockholders. On account of the economical develop-
ment, businesses start to support and participate in social activities or national construction
as well as setting the foundation to join community welfare movements voluntarily under
the inﬂuence of ethics, conscience, self-realization, even religion. Today, in spite of this,
there are several contrary opinions that business should be socially responsible or not. For
example, the economist Milton Friedman stated that the only point businesses must face is to
gain proﬁt for shareholders and some theories also state that businesses taking on too much
responsibility will weaken the efﬁciency of government. As times have changed, CSR has
become one of the most important issues of public strategy in the world and is more essential
than before.

The Socioeconomic View states that the businesses’ social responsibility is not only to
earn proﬁts, but also protect and improve social welfare. The view exists with the expectation
for businesses to change; businesses do not just belong to the stockholders, they are also
responsible for the whole society. Social legislation and standards protect businesses to exist
reasonably; also, society purchases the products and services to support these enterprises.
Furthermore, socioeconomic views are that businesses are not just economic units; they
should confront issues related to society, politics and legislation positively in the outside
environment.

All circles pay a great deal of attention to CSR mainly because of the outside stress.
The international institutions investigate whether customers refuse products made from the
businesses which are not socially responsible. Also, more and more investors point out
that unwholesome image will lead to the dumping of shares even if it a proﬁt is made.
The situation has become more evident after the ﬁnancial scandals of Enron and WorldCom.
Besides, 80% of employees of MNCs consider that the more responsibility the business takes
on, the more loyalty they have. The above-mentioned promotes all businesses to introspect
their performance beyond the economic results and be conscious of values as well as the
importance of being socially responsible.

In addition, under free trade, globalization, risk management/customers’ and investors’
rights, prosperous telecommunication technology, and promotion from inter-government,
the concept of CSR is transmitted through a supply chain. CSR has even become the means
of trade protection in some countries. These make businesses aware of the signiﬁcance.
Lots of MNCs with a global supply chain look forward to being respected by their part-
ners in the portion of core values and standards; some international retail businesses like
Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Avon have their distributors conform to the norm. The businesses
plan to cooperate with these MNCs have to take CSR into account. Sweden is the country
with the most MNCs set up; almost every global business builds a unit to cope with CSR
affairs.

Besides, more and more inter-governmental institutions are starting to set up the standard
of CSR. For example, the social responsibility organization establishing its headquarters
in the USA institutes the standard-SA 8000. The rule of managing the MNCs made from
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) speciﬁes the vo-
luntary rules and norms of the responsible business activities; it suggests that businesses
should set a high standard of information about the performance and audit. It also urges
business to verify their environmental and social performance in a higher level. Furthermore,
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established CSR committee,
has set up the norms and plans to draw up a directional paper in 2007. The information

123

stated-above indicates that it is a trend that businesses should take and practice social res-
ponsibility. The meaning of CSR is becoming more and more expanded as well as standar-
dized.

Business is one of the components to form a society, and it ought to take social respon-
sibility ﬁrst. There is a close relationship between business and society; the outcome from
business beneﬁts society while the resource of beneﬁt is also society. The relationship is
the foundation of the social responsibility businesses should take, and is the precondition
of business to grow and expand. It is inevitable for business to take social responsibility for
long-term development. What’s more, the economic structure of Taiwan is trade-oriented
and focuses on the globalization and internationalization with the businesses’ boundary and
range. CSR is always a challenge that businesses must confront. Corporations without taking
social responsibility will be unable to compete with others. Being a member of the global
village, the organizations in Taiwan have to think internationally. On the front burner is to
lead CSR in their management ideology and strategies. Not merely in this area, the whole
world is trying to ﬁnd answers and seek for valuable cases concerning CSR. The trend of CSR
attributes its success to the benchmarking effect of large-scale businesses, and it is necessary
for Taiwan to do so.

2 Hsinchu Science Park

Science parks are established to introduce high-tech industries and attract talent to Taiwan,
promote the upgrading of Taiwanese industries, balance regional development and drive
national economic development. One of three science parks existing in northern, central and
southern Taiwan, the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) is primarily focused on semiconductors;
meanwhile, the Central Taiwan Science Park is focused on aviation, precision machinery,
and optoelectronics, while the Southern Taiwan Science Park is focused on optoelectronics.
Consequently, each of these science parks possesses its own respective core technological
advantages.

Since the HSP was established in December 1980, the government has invested US$1,679
million on park infrastructure and facilities. A total of 384 high-tech companies had been
established in the park by the end of 2004, and a total of 632 hectares had been developed
for the HSP proper, plus an additional 141 hectares for the Jhunan Park. During its 24 year
history, the HSP has focused both on research and production, thus profoundly impacting the
local economic development and giving the HSP an international reputation and establishing
it as a model imitated by other countries.

Regarding the overall performance of the Park in 2004, 335 of the 384 Park companies
were domestic companies while 49 were foreign. The total revenue of the six main industries
reached US$32.5 billion, representing a growth rate of 27% in 2004. Accumulated paid-in
capital was US$32.2 billion.

Regarding new investment, 48 applications from new companies were approved in 2004,
representing a total capital of US$1,290 million. Meanwhile, regarding applications for
increased investment, 55 companies applied for investment, totaling US$2,159 million.
Additionally, 97 Park companies were listed on the TAIEX and OTC markets at the end
of 2004. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC), United
Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Macro nix International Co., Ltd., were also lis-
ted on the American Depository Receipts (ADR) Market (Fig. 1).

3 Objective

The economic development of the high-tech industry in Taiwan includes IC design, opt elec-
trics, semiconductors, computer science and telecommunication. It is necessary for business
to understand the relations and signiﬁcance of the economic performance to be responsible
and keep a positive corporate image, thus they can earn more admiration and trust from
customers. Based on the background, the objective of the study is:

1. To investigate the awareness and application of social responsibility of high-tech industries

in Taiwan.

2. To comprehend the corporate image of high-tech industries in Taiwan.
3. To investigate the inﬂuence of the social responsibility and corporate image of high-tech

industries in Taiwan.

4. To investigate the inﬂuence of the social responsibility and corporate image on the

economic performance of high-tech industries in Taiwan.

4 Literature review

According to the report of The World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD), the formal deﬁnition of the CSR is: businesses commit to observe the moral
standards persistently; contribute to the economic development; improve the living standard
of employees as well as their families, communities and the whole society. The actual issues
include the human rights, employee beneﬁts, eco-protection, community participation, whoe-
ver is concerned (the suppliers, customers or clients, consumers, and so on). By any means,
CSR stresses on two points; ﬁrst, business must conform to the legislation as well as morality;
second, businesses must be responsible for whoever is concerned, not just for the stockholders.
Carroll (1996) summarized CSR from many academics and stated that the corporate social
responsibility contains four patterns: economics, legislation, morality and spontaneity, and
views the spontaneous responsibility as businesses taking it on voluntarily according to their
perspective. Wood (1991) pointed out that social responsibility is an essential Logos of the
interaction between businesses and society. He also proposed three principles of CSR; they
are: the legitimacy of the system, public responsibility of organizations and philosophy of
individual autonomy management.

Corporate image and economic performance

421

McGuire (1988) analyzed the Fortune 500 companies and found that the businesses
without social responsibility usually cannot implement their strategies effectively and the
stock will also decline under the indeterminable litigation. On the other hand, businesses
with social responsibility usually interact well with customers, stockholders and communi-
ties, and then they can reduce business risks and improve their image; furthermore productions
will be accepted by the consumers more easily.

Wong (2001) found that the perception and expression of CSR is not signiﬁcantly related
to the organizational size, personal traits of leaders, or business character. The businesses
that take parts in charity are signiﬁcantly related to the perception and expression of CSR
than those that are not. Also, regarding performance (proﬁts, operation and scale) the former
is signiﬁcantly superior to the latter mentioned above. Businesses that operate on a medium
or small scale take social responsibility actively in general.

Lu (2003) investigated the leaders of members of the Business Council for Sustainable
Development in Kao-Shiung and concluded that in terms of responsibility to employees, they
provide retirement pension, run-up compensation, occupation disaster subsidization while
communicating between directors and employees, and even less than 30% have set up call
centers. Therefore, they have to work harder to be responsible to their customers. Besides,
the feedback to the public welfare is still not sufﬁcient and it is suggested that the leaders
should fund the feedback system. More than 50% have set up a wasteplex for eco-protection.
Jen (2001) surveyed CSR and found that many organizations take social responsibility well
while websites of these businesses do not clearly show relevant information and are viewed as
disregarding CSR; in other words, they miss the opportunity to establish or improve corporate
image through the Internet.

Huang (2004) found that large-scale businesses are usually more active in supporting
public welfare than medium or small scale businesses on account of institutionalization and
specialization. Further, large-scale businesses tend to support the academic organizations and
the Non Proﬁt Organizations (NPOs). Medium or small scale businesses tend to support local
community institutions. Besides, the larger ones prefer to offer ﬁnancial support, while the
smaller ones prefer to prefer material and time support with more creativity and practicality.
Ko (2003) stated that the new retirement system can secure the lives of the elderly, inspire
the morale of employees and improve the productivity; also, it can encourage employees
to retire earlier to adjust the inner human resource structure, in order to achieve the goals
of proﬁt and development. The ultimate objective is to ensure security after retiring; it is
also giving back to society. From the perspective of CSR, the turnover is a phenomenon of
resource re-assignment and communion; businesses should take social responsibility with
moral standards to maintain the human resources.

Chen (2001) investigated the print media of Taiwan and concluded that the Great News
emphasizes disseminating the activities of saying no to drugs and problems of adolescents
in terms of spontaneous responsibility. The United Daily News usually propagates public
service with the Ministry of Justice. The Taiwan Times often holds related forums. Regar-
ding education, The United Daily News groups set up an integrated training system both
pre-occupation and on-the-job. In the perception of CSR, the three News groups all avoid
reporting useless news. The China Times groups try to do their best and to make the news
more professional and valuable. The United Daily News groups insist on the ideal of social
responsibility, and stress the innovation of media and academic concerns besides the profes-
sion, and claim that CSR is a foundation of business culture; news should be reported and
analyzed based on the readers’ sides. The news groups focus on the economic responsibility;
legislation, morality and spontaneity follow subsequently.

Sheu (2003) found that businesses are socially responsible in order to give feedback
to communities and the whole society. The principle to evaluate the public welfare is to
stress on the value and culture of public service and it is also related to the issues that
people are concerned with. The way to carry out the public welfare is through business
productions, even if by delivery. As to the participation and holding of relevant activities,
there is a signiﬁcant correlation among proﬁts, support from the higher directors, scale and
the amount of customers. The patterns of public welfare usually come into effect by setting up
communities, improving community welfare and academics. The inﬂuence of implementing
the public welfare of businesses is to promote the corporate image and the coherence of
employees. To the beneﬁciary, it also can advance the quality of life, the common view of
communities, popularity and celebrity.

According to an analysis of 33 countries and 1161 CEOs all over the world concerning,
CSR from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2002, social responsibility will become the essential
philosophy and strategy of businesses to go to a higher frontier. In the report, 68% of countries
believe that it is helpful to gain proﬁt with a social responsibility perspective; and over 50%
disapprove of social responsibility as a public issue of businesses (Common Wealth Magazine,
vol. 260). Businesses are ready to take social responsibility (from public issues to concerns).
Besides improving competitiveness and gaining proﬁt for stockholders, organizations all over
the world pay close attention to subjects from communities to global development and actively
take part in public service activities to set up a good image in people and society regardless of
nationality, industries or scale. The high-tech industry in Taiwan has to pay more attention to
social responsibility and then reach their ﬁnal objective. Based on 352 business questionnaires
in Taiwan from the Great View Magazine, over 80% of companies that go public take the
stockholders’ and employees’ rights as the most important social responsibility of businesses,
and treat paying taxes by law (77.8%) and following the corporate moral standards (76.7%)
as the main implementation of CSR. Generally, the businesses in Taiwan emphasize CSR to
gain proﬁt and employees’ welfare; it is the same with Milton Friedman, the winner of the
Nobel Economic Price in 1970. He stated that the only concern of business is to increase
proﬁt; however, it varies throughout the world.

Many people misunderstand and think that it is immoral for businesses to gain proﬁt. The
proﬁt and moral are not in confronting positions: the ultimate goal is equality. It is not the
only way to contribute to society by practicing virtue: businesses that use public resources
effectively and create public beneﬁts equally will have more of an effect. To involve the
public welfare is one of the most essential strategies of business management. Michael
Porter, a leader of management, pointed out in the Harvard Business Review that businesses
practicing virtue correctly will improve their competitive advantage.

5 Methodology

5.1 Structure and research questions

From the lectures discussed above, we concluded that the three chief subjects of this study
are: Social Responsibility, Corporate Image and Economic Performance, and investigated the
correlations among these variables of high-tech industry in Taiwan. We set up the structure
and questions based on the objectives (Fig. 2):

5.2 Design and development of questionnaire

The study integrated related data and an grounded appropriate questionnaire; in Social Res-
ponsibility, we followed the survey built up by Shu (2000) presented in her thesis and dis-
cussed the existing conditions of social responsibility of high-tech industries in Taiwan; ﬁve
segments are included and they are: 1. The emphasis of training and developments of em-
ployees; 2. the support of secure and reliable productions; 3. the emphasis on environmental
protection; 4. sincerity; 5. paying taxes according to the law and participating in public ac-
tivities positively. She also analyzed relevant issues concerning CSR and concluded what
is the most important. In Corporate Image, we followed the three dimension questionnaire
developed from Walters (1978), and Chen (2002) presented in his thesis; there are 9 items
shown in Table 1.

Also, we investigated the inﬂuence of CSR on businesses and their corporate image. The
study did a Regression Analysis to ﬁnd out the relation between CSR and Corporate Image,
and did a Pearson test to ﬁnd out the correlations among the CSR, Corporate Image and
Economic Performance. We also discussed the present situation of high-tech industries in
Taiwan based on statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C. and the Agency
of Hsinchu Science Park.

In CSR survey, we chose the managers’ works in Hsinchu Science Park, working sepa-
rately in the ﬁeld of Integrated Circuits, PC/ Peripherals, Telecommunication, Optoelectro-
nics, Precision Machinery and Biotechnology. There are 340 high-tech companies in Hsin-
chu Science Park: 146 Integrated Circuits, 54 PC/ Peripherals, 46 Telecommunication, 54
Optoelectronics, 20 Precision Machinery and 20 Biotechnology as of March in 2005 (shown
in Table 2). We sent out 340 CSR questionnaires. As to corporate image, we chose the people
in Taiwan to understand their image to the companies we have chosen. In economic perfor-
mance, we used statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C. and the Agency of
Hsinchu Science Park to support the research questions (Table 3).

is no standard to practice CSR, just take the duty lawfully.
3. The analysis of CSR of high-tech industries in Taiwan

As shown in Table 5, 85% of the mass population agrees that the high-tech industry
in Taiwan should run business lawfully; as to the 5th item, “take part in public activities
positively,” the outcome showed that it is a concrete implementation to practice CSR and
77% agree with the opinion. The outcome showed that it can be better in this aspect; for the
4th item, most mass populations agree that the high-tech industry in Taiwan operates and
pays the taxes according to the law.

6.3 The corporate image of high-tech industries in Taiwan

An analysis of the corporate image of high-tech industries in Taiwan:

Based on Table 6, 87.4% of the mass population think that the high-tech industries in
Taiwan is well-known as shown in item No. 3, where the strength of agreement is 4.37 on
average. It shows that people agree that the high-tech industries in Taiwan are famous and
have their own corporate image.

visors in high-tech industries is highly signiﬁcant. It means that the greater responsibilities
businesses take, the better corporate image businesses get.

between CSR and Economic Performance (0.653) is higher than CSR and Corporate Image
(0.579); the correlation coefﬁcient between CSR and Economic Performance (0.653) is higher
than the Economic Performance and Corporate Image (0.364); ﬁnally, the correlation coefﬁ-
cient between CSR and Corporate Image (0.579) is higher than the Economic Performance
and Corporate Image (0.364). To sum up, the positive correlation between CSR and Econo-
mic Performance is most signiﬁcant; what follows is the positive correlation between CSR
and Corporate Image; the correlation between the Corporate Image and Economic Perfor-
mance is least signiﬁcant. In other words, businesses that take more responsibilities will gain
more customer satisfaction. Based on the analysis mentioned above, high-tech industries can
increase their Economic Performance by taking on social responsibilities, and then improve
their Corporate Image.
