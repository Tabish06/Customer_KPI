 Market Structure and Market
 Value*

 I. Introduction

 While the use of market models to determine the
 sources of economic profits is quite new, at least
 two empirical studies considering the market
 structure and market value relation have ap-
 peared to date. Interestingly, they conflict.
 Thomadakis (1977) found a close positive rela-
 tion between the four-firm concentration ratio
 and relative excess valuation, measured as the
 difference between the market value of the firm
 and the book value of tangible assets, all nor-
 malized by sales. As a result, Thomadakis argued
 that "industry concentration plays a role in the
 determination of excess profits from currently
 held assets and those expected from the firm's
 investment options" (p. 185). In contrast, Lin-
 denberg and Ross (1981) reported no significant
 relation between concentration and Tobin's Q
 ratio, measured as the ratio of the market value
 of the firm to the replacement cost of tangible
 assets. This result disputes Thomadakis's find-
 ings and a purely structuralist interpretation of
 economic profits. According to Lindenberg and
 Ross, market power may or may not be evident
 in highly concentrated markets since "high Q's
 can occur in concentrated or unconcentrated
 markets and, conversely, low Q's, indicating no
 significant market power, can occur in markets
 that have high degrees of concentration" (p. 28).

 After allowing for the
 intangible capital or
 "left-out-asset" effects
 of R & D and advertis-
 ing and for the effects
 of growth, no consis-
 tent link between tradi-
 tional market structure
 variables and market-
 value-based estimates
 of economic profits is
 obvious. Apparently,
 market structure data
 are not an attractive
 proxy for market
 power. This finding dis-
 putes traditional Cour-
 novian and Chamber-
 linian theory but is
 consistent with the
 "contestable markets"
 literature suggestion
 that there may be no
 simple relation between
 the number and/or rela-
 tive size of firms and
 competition.

 The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the market structure and
 market value relation in order to resolve this conflict which has
 emerged in the literature.

 II. Oligopoly Theory

 In the Cournot (1838) model, each oligopolist identifies a profit-
 maximizing activity level based on the assumption each rival will main-
 tain current output. Then. in an interactive process. each rival adjusts
 output until there is no further incentive for change. In equilibrium,
 price and firm number will be inversely related. Cournot's theory thus
 predicts a positive relation between leading firm market share and
 profits and/or relative firm size and profits. However, the Cournot
 model is often criticized as naive since it depends on the myopic as-
 sumption of exogenously determined rival output in the face of re-
 peated evidence to the contrary. Imel and Helmberger (1971), for ex-
 ample, argue that a relative firm size-profits relation reflects
 "progressiveness" and "good management." This explanation of mar-
 ket structure-profits relations, based on leading firm efficiency rather
 than monopoly power, has received further support in studies by
 Demsetz (1973) and Peltzman (1977), among others. Therefore, ques-
 tions concerning market share-profits and relative firm size-profits rela-
 tions remain open and controversial on the basis of both fact and inter-
 pretation.

 A second line of argument that predicted a market sructure-profits
 relation was offered by Chamberlin (1933). Chamberlin argued that as
 firms become "few" in number, interdependence becomes recognized,
 and tacit or explicit collusion becomes effective. The equilibrium price
 is one which maximizes joint profits and corresponds to the monopoly
 price-that is, so long as interdependence is realized. If numbers be-
 come so large that individual reactions are no longer expected, collu-
 sion breaks down and the competitive result is obtained. Thus, based
 on a "leading firm collusion" argument, the Chamberlin model pre-
 dicts a concentration-profits relation. This prediction has motivated an
 extensive tradition of market structure-performance studies (see
 Scherer 1980).

 These views of a strong market structure-profits relation contrast
 sharply with alternative theory, which suggets no necessary link be-
 tween the number and/or size distribution of rivals and industry perfor-
 mance. Bertrand (1883) argues that each oligopolist will set price on the
 assumption of exogenously determined rival prices. Then, in an itera-
 tive process, each rival cuts price to capture the market share of rivals.
 After a period of adjustment, prices converge to competitive equilib-
 rium norms. Thus, Bertrand predicts no necessary relation between
 the number and/or relative size of firms and competition. Although
 Bertrand's behavioral postulates are implausible for much the same

 reason as those of Cournot, in recent years the central result of his
 theory seems to be gaining acceptance among economists.

 Indeed, the recent "contestable markets" literature can be viewed
 as an elegant restatement and extension of Bertrand's theory. Baumol
 (1982) writes that "once each product obtains a second producer, that
 is once we enter the domain of duopoly or oligopoly for each and every
 good, [price-output] choice disappears. The contestable oligopoly
 which achieves an equilibrium that immunizes it from the incursions of
 entrants has only one pricing option-it must set its price exactly equal
 to marginal cost and do all of the things required for a first best op-
 timum! In short, once we leave the world of pure or partial monopoly,
 any contestable market must behave ideally in every respect. Optimal-
 ity is not approached gradually as the number of firms supplying a
 commodity grows" (p. 2).

 In other words, the Bertrand-Baumol view of oligopoly rejects the

 hypothesis of a relation of profits to market structure that is asserted by
 the other writers mentioned. To test these competing hypotheses, we
 shall study the effects of three market structure variables (market
 share, relative firm size, and concentration) on profits. But in order to
 do this, it is necessary to address certain methodological issues.

 III. The Model

 It has become traditional to consider the market structure-profits rela-
 tion using four-firm concentration and accounting profits data. As de-
 scribed above, the use of concentration data is quite consistent with a
 shared monopoly, or Chamberlin, view. On the other hand, a test of
 Cournot theory requires an analysis of market share or relative firm
 size data. Thus, tests of market structure-profits relations are not neu-
 tral with respect to the market structure measure analyzed.

 The use of accounting profit data also involves problems since these

 data are before risk adjustment and are influenced by accounting treat-
 ments which, for some types of expenditures, can diverge from eco-
 nomic reality. Beginning with Telser (1961), many economists have
 viewed advertising "as a capital good that depreciates over time and
 needs maintenance and repair" (p. 197). Similarly, Weiss (1969) has
 suggested that research and development "yield(s) benefits mainly in
 the future" (p. 42). Recent empirical studies on both R & D (Hirschey
 1982) and advertising (Demsetz 1979; Ayanian 1983) provide strong
 support for this "intangible capital" argument and suggest that treating
 these items as current expenses will give a bias to accounting profit
 rates whenever advertising and R & D are significant.' Since both

 1. Both Telser and Weiss have also suggested that firm-specific human capital can

 contribute to a left-out-asset effect. Indeed, it seems likely that intangible capital effects
 of advertising and R & D relate partly to the value created by a synergistic marketing
 staff or research team.

 theory and evidence indicate advertising and R & D will be substantial
 in the case of oligopoly (Kamien and Schwartz 1975; Comanor and
 Wilson 1979), the "left-out-asset" effect can seriously bias estimates of
 the relation of market structure to profits when profits are measured
 using accounting data.

 A compelling virtue of an approach based on the market value of the
 firm is that such an approach minimizes the effect of accounting bias.
 The market value of the firm can be viewed as the risk-adjusted present
 value of all future profits and has the following major components:

 MV(F) = MV(T) + MV(I), (1)

 where MV(F) is market value of the firm and MV(T) and MV(I) are the
 capitalized values of profits attributable to tangible and intangible as-
 sets, respectively.

 Although MV(F) is observable, subcomponents MV(T) and MV(I)
 are not. Nevertheless, accounting book values and replacement cost
 values can be viewed as useful, though imperfect, measures of the
 market value of tangible assets. By using such accounting data it is
 possible to isolate the market value effects of tangible assets from any
 additional influences of intangible assets such as market power, pat-
 ents, brand loyalty, goodwill, and so on.

 In a first approach along these lines, Thomadakis introduced a mea-

 sure called relative excess valuation, EVIS, where

 EV - MV(F) - BV(T) (2)
 S S

 and BV(T) is the book value of tangible assets and S is sales.2 When
 EVIS > 0, market value reflects valuable intangible assets not reflected
 in book value data, perhaps including market structure influences.
 Since MV(T) = BV(T) + error (e),

 EVIS = MV(I) + el, (3)

 S

 = fi(X) + el,

 where X includes variables describing market structure and other po-
 tential sources of intangible capital.

 A second approach, proposed by Lindenberg and Ross, involves

 using a measure commonly referred to as the "Q ratio," where

 2. Relative excess valuation can be thought of as the market value analogue to the
 return on sales or Lerner index of economic profits. The Lerner index is defined as L =
 (P - MC)IP, where P is price and MC is marginal cost. Under pure competition, P =
 MC and L = 0. The more a firm's pricing departs from the competitive norm, the greater
 will be L. In empirical research, the equilibrium condition MC = AC (average cost) is
 often assumed, and L = (P - AC)IP = return on sales (see Scherer).

 Market Structure and Market Value 93

 Q= MV(F) (4

 RC(T) (4

 and RC(T) is the replacement cost of tangible assets (see Tobin 1978).
 When Q > 1, market value reflects valuable intangible assets not
 reflected in replacement cost data. Since MV(T) = RC(T) + error (e),

 Q=1? MV(T) (5)

 + MV(I) (5)

 = f2(X) + e2,

 where X is market structure and other additional factors which may
 influence Q.

 Analyses of the market value-market structure relation could be
 based on either of the EVIS or Q approaches. EVIS, calculated from
 historical cost data, has the attractive feature of being normalized by
 sales-a factor- and leverage-neutral measure that is easily calculated.
 However, this measure is more likely than Q to be subject to "replace-
 ment cost" errors because Q is calculated using replacement cost data.
 However, because it is normalized by the replacement cost of tangible
 assets, cross-firm differences in Q can be caused by variations in capi-
 tal intensity and leverage. Thus, despite the high correlation between
 EVIS and Q. reported by Hirschey and Wichern (1984), it is possible
 that the conflict between Thomadakis's findings and those reported by
 Lindenberg and Ross could be the result of the (remaining) variation
 between these two variables. Accordingly, we shall consider the ef-
 fects of market structure (as well as the effects of other potentially
 relevant variables) variables on both EVIS and Q.

 To the extent that high levels of market share, relative firm size, and
 concentration indicate an ability to restrict output (i.e., reflect market
 power), they can lead to above-normal rates of return on investment.
 However, if investors perceive the presence of lasting market power,
 the value of the firm will be bid up so that investors receive, ex post,
 only a risk-adjusted normal rate of return. Thus, positive market struc-
 ture effects on EVIS and Q will be observed only if traditional market
 structure data indicate sustainable market power, and otherwise not.
 Other variables may similarly affect market value of equity. For
 example, both R & D and advertising will also have market value
 effects if these expenditures have asset-like characteristics. Another
 example: anticipated growth will have a positive effect on market
 values if future investments are expected to earn above-normal rates of
 return and if such growth is an important determinant of these returns
 (Miller and Modigliani 1961). Finally, while growth affects the mag-
 nitude of anticipated excess returns, a valuation influence may be asso-
 ciated with the degree of stability such returns exhibit. It is generally

 accepted that greater riskiness of a stream of future excess returns will
 reduce the market value of that stream, expected values unchanged.

 These remarks suggest a model where

 Yj = f (MPj, R & DIS, AD/S, GR, B), (6)

 and which, in linear form, is written

 Yj = bo + b, MPj + b2 R & DIS + b3 AD/S

 + b4 GR + b5 B + u,

 and Y1 is EVIS or Q; MPj is the jth market structure proxy for market
 power (market share, MS, relative firm size, MS/CR, or concentration,
 CR); R & D/S is R & D intensity; ADIS is advertising intensity; GR is
 growth; and B is the stock-price beta measure of risk.

 IV. Estimation

 Before considering the estimation of (7) in detail, let us see how the
 various market structure proxies (market share, MS; relative firm size,
 MS/CR; and concentration, CR), together with growth and risk vari-
 ables, perform on our sample in the absence of variables reflecting R &
 D and advertising. The estimates are presented in table 1 and are based
 on a N = 390 firm sample from the 1977 Fortune 500.3 (These are all
 1977 Fortune companies for which a complete set of data could be
 obtained.) An interesting feature of the results is that they replicate

 3. The market value of the firm is measured by the market value of common stock plus

 the book value of debt. Ideally, the market value of each would have been included.
 However, the market value of debt is difficult to obtain, and this second best measure of
 market value is a good approximation. Components used to estimate the market value of
 common stock, number of shares and closing prices (12/31/77), were obtained from
 Standard & Poor's Compustat tapes. The book value of debt was calculated using For-
 tune data. Q is calculated as the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement
 cost of tangible assets. EVIS is calculated as the difference between the market value of
 the firm and the book value of tangible assets, all divided by sales. Alternatively EVIS
 can be viewed as the difference between the market value of common and stockholders'
 equity, all normalized by sales. Replacement cost data were obtained from annual 10-K
 reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, whereas sales and the (historical
 cost) book value of tangible assets data were obtained from Fortune. Concentration
 ratios and market share data weighted to reflect firm sales in various four-digit census
 industries were originally compiled by Economic Information Systems, Inc., and gener-
 ously made available to this study by Kenneth M. Harlan. See Hirschey (1982) for a
 detailed description. R & D expenditures were obtained from Business Week, and all
 advertising data had Leading National Advertisers as its source. If amortization of the
 evaporation (exponential) type and constant expenditure growth can be assumed, intan-
 gible capital levels will be strictly proportionate to these annual expenditure rates. Weiss
 reported empirical support for these assumptions, thereby allowing us to consider annual
 expenditure effects as indicative of intangible capital influences. Growth is defined as the
 average annual rate of growth in sales over the 1972-77 period. Finally, stock price betas
 estimated from 60 observations of monthly data were obtained from Value Line.

 some earlier findings from well-known studies that used market struc-
 ture and unadjusted accounting profit rate data.

 1. As in Kwoka (1979), a close link between market share and
 profitability is suggested which, in Kwoka's words, "implies that the
 distribution of market shares is a far more important-and complex-
 determinant of industry performance than previously recognized"
 (p. 108).

 2. As in Imel and Helmberger, a positive influence of relative firm
 size suggests the importance of "progressiveness" and "good
 management."

 3. Like Strickland and Weiss (1976), we find only a small (statisti-

 cally insignificant) positive effect of concentration on profitability. This
 is consistent with Lindenberg and Ross's results but conflicts with
 Thomadakis's findings. Thus, the possibility of sampling bias in the
 Thomadakis study is raised.4 However, it is worth noting that since
 neither value-based study (Lindenberg and Ross, Thomadakis) consid-
 ered the valuation effects of market share or relative firm size, some
 model specification error may be present in each. Specifically, the
 much lower levels of overall explanatory power in table 1 (as compared
 with table 2) and the high t-values of the R & D/S and AD/S values
 suggest that equations omitting these two variables are misspecified.

 4. Thomadakis analyzed 158 Fortune companies taken from a sample studied earlier
 by Shepherd-(1972). Exclusions were made for several reasons, including a high degree
 of internal diversification. While eliminating diversified firms provides a better matching
 between firm- and industry-level data, it also causes many nonleading (diversified) firms
 to be eliminated from consideration. Fortune companies are large by definition, and if
 undiversified they tend to be industry leaders. Thus, the positive concentration "effect"
 on profits noted by Thomadakis (1977) may simply reflect a close link between his
 concentration variable and leading firm market share.

 The results from estimating equation (7) on all right-hand-side vari-
 ables are presented in table 2. In terms of both significant individual
 coefficients and overall explanatory power, market value seems much
 more closely related to R & D, advertising intensity, and growth than
 to variables reflecting the size distribution of firms. Indeed, one might
 argue that previous uncertainty as to the economic importance of vari-
 ous market structure variables has been caused, at least in part, by
 failure adequately to consider the influence of R & D and advertising.
 Moreover, our results show that while the independent effects of
 both market share and relative firm size are statistically insignificant,
 the effect of concentration on market value is (surprisingly) negative
 and "modestly" significant. This suggests that the market share-
 profits link reported in some earlier studies may be due to rapid leading
 firm growth caused by superior efficiency rather than by monopoly
 power. It is worth noting that a negative concentration-profits link has
 also appeared in recent studies of line-of-business data by Martin and
 Ravenscraft (1982) and Ravenscraft (1983). In these studies, both mod-
 els and data are markedly different from those employed here. Clearly,
 the overall results suggest that simple structural theories of economic
 profits are incomplete at best and possibly plain wrong.

 V. Summary

 This paper provides new evidence on the relation of (product) market
 structure to market value of equity. By using market value of equity as

 a measure of economic performance, we avoid well-known problems
 arising from the measurement of profits from accounting records. After
 allowing for the effects of growth and intangible capital ("left-out"
 asset effects of R & D and advertising), no consistent link between
 traditional market structure variables and market value of equity was
 detected. Neither market share nor relative firm size had any discern-
 ible influence on value of equity, and the effect of concentration was
 negative and, arguably, of statistical significance on conventional crite-
 ria.

 These results suggest that cross-industry differences in profits are
 not positively related to market structure. No simple relation between
 the number and/or relative size of firms and profits has been found.
 Conventional characterizations of market structure do not reflect
 "market power," even approximately.
