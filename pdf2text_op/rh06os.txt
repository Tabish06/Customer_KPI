In this paper, we explore opposing theoretical claims about how organizational reputation affects market reactions to

product defects. On the one hand, good reputation could be a disadvantage because expectations about product quality
are more likely to be violated by defects in highly reputed products. On the other hand, a good reputation could be
an advantage because of strong inertial effects on reputation orderings. We empirically test these competing hypotheses
using data on product recalls in the U.S. automobile industry from 1975 to 1999. Our results support for the idea that
reputation can be an organizational liability in that highly reputed ﬁrms suffer more market penalty as a result of their
product recalls. We also propose that the reputational effects are moderated by two important factors: substitutability and
generalism/specialism. Our results show that having few substitutes with an equivalent level of reputation, or a focused
product identity stemming from specialism, buffers the negative market reactions to product recalls. We conclude with a
discussion on the implications of these results for institutional, reputation, and status theories.

Key words: organizational reputation; product recalls; substitutability; specialism; quality

Over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly
apparent from work by organizational theorists, sociol-
ogists, and information economists that the possession
of good reputation provides a number of beneﬁts to
ﬁrms. These beneﬁts include lower costs and the ability
to charge higher prices (Shapiro 1983, Podolny 1993,
Sullivan 1998, Benjamin and Podolny 1999), growth in
sales and status (Podolny and Phillips 1996), protection
against market entrants (Milgrom and Roberts 1982),
increased return to actual quality (Benjamin and Podolny
1999), easier access to capital (Stuart et al. 1999),
greater survival rates (Rao 1994), and superior ﬁnan-
cial performance (Roberts and Dowling 2002). A posi-
tive reputation is also important to a ﬁrm’s competitive
advantage because it is a positive signal to potential buy-
ers and suppliers, increasing their willingness to contract
with a ﬁrm (Fombrun and Shanley 1990, Weigelt and
Camerer 1988).

Despite this extensive work in the area of reputation,
there has been very little exploration of the ways orga-
nizational reputation responds to the revelation of orga-
nizational errors in the form of product defects. Is the
possession of a good reputation an asset or a liability in
such cases? Although there has been work investigating
the reactions of various organizational constituencies to
errors (e.g., Haunschild and Sullivan 2002), defects (e.g.,
Haunschild and Rhee 2004), and various forms of con-
troversial organizational actions (e.g., Elsbach 1994), the
role of ﬁrm reputation or status in this process has not
been investigated. Therefore, in this study we investigate

how an organization’s reputation moderates the negative
impact of defect disclosure on its subsequent market per-
formance. Prior research on the disclosure of product
defects (such as recalls and airline accidents) measures
the damages caused by such defects, including losses in
stock market valuation (Barber and Darrough 1996) and
product sales (Reilly and Hoffer 1983). In this study we
investigate how an organization’s reputation might mod-
erate the extent of these damages. In particular, while
most researchers claim that good reputation serves as an
organizational asset (e.g., Shapiro 1983, Fombrun and
Shanley 1990, Fombrun 1996), we also explore the pos-
sibility that good reputation might be a liability in these
cases, causing ﬁrms with a good reputation to suffer
more market penalty than ﬁrms with a poor reputation.
Second, we also investigate the possibility that the role
of reputation in the relationship between product defects
and subsequent market outcomes is affected by two
important factors: product uniqueness or substitutabil-
ity (the number of competing products with compara-
ble levels of reputation) and identity focus in terms of
whether the ﬁrm is a generalist or specialist. Previous
research has documented several mechanisms by which
substitutability lowers a ﬁrm’s market power (Burt 1982,
White 2002). Also, the focused identity associated with
specialism has been shown to facilitate the valuation and
authenticity of ﬁrm products (Carroll and Swaminathan
2000, Carroll et al. 2002, Zuckerman and Kim 2003).
Yet
to date there has been little research investigat-
ing the role of these factors on reputational effects.

Therefore, we also explore how the effects of reputa-
tion on responses to product defects are moderated by
product substitutability and generalism/specialism.

In the literature there are two general perspectives on
reputation. From an economic perspective, a ﬁrm’s rep-
utation is closely tied to the value of its previous efforts
(e.g., Shapiro 1983). From an organizational and soci-
ological perspective, reputation derives not only from
past performance, but also from the status of the ﬁrm’s
exchange partners (e.g., Podolny and Phillips 1996) and
other organizational attributes, such as ﬁrm age and size
(e.g., Perrow 1961, Han 1994, Fombrun 1996). Differ-
ent terms for the general concept of reputation have
been used in different literatures, for example, “status”
or “prestige” (e.g., Blau 1964, Podolny 1993), “reputa-
tion” (Fombrun and Shanley 1990), “brand reputation,”
or “image” (e.g., Shapiro 1983). In much work, the con-
cepts of status and reputation are not easily disentangled
(Sine et al. 2003, Washington and Zajac 2005), and often
one concept is used to deﬁne another (Washington and
Zajac 2005). Organizational status, however, is essen-
tially concerned with perceptions of an organization’s
standing relative to others (Sine et al. 2003) and is
often deﬁned relative to the standing of network partners
(Podolny and Phillips 1996). Reputation is often dis-
cussed in terms of the perceptions of an organization’s
“goodness” or “badness” (Fombrun 1996, Roberts and
Dowling 2002) in the eyes of a particular audience.

In this paper, however, we will not address such dif-
ferences. Instead, we deﬁne and use the term reputation
to mean the consumer’s subjective evaluation of the per-
ceived quality of the producer. While ﬁrms may bear
different types of reputations, such as that of a socially
concerned ﬁrm or a ﬁrm that treats employees well (cf.
Fombrun 1996), we concentrate on quality reputation as
our underling construct. We do this because we are inter-
ested in investigating the effects of ﬁrm reputation when
product quality is at issue. We then draw on multiple
literatures to understand the effects of quality reputation
on market responses to defects.

Our study has important implications for theories of
reputation and status. First, as noted earlier, there has
been very little focus on the possibility that a good rep-
utation may be a liability in some cases. By liability,
we mean that it is possible that good-reputation ﬁrms
may suffer more penalties in some situations (i.e., obtain
fewer gains or suffer more losses) than poor-reputation
ﬁrms. Exploring this possibility could lead to a more
balanced view of the effects of ﬁrm reputation. Second,
while most studies on organizational reputation have
shown a unilateral effect of reputation on various out-
comes, we investigate the possibility that because the
efﬁcacy of reputation is entwined with organizational
identity (generalism/specialism) and uniqueness (substi-
tutability), reputational effects may not be as simple as
previously thought.

Context
Our context is the U.S. automobile industry and the
product recalls of all automakers in this industry over
a 25-year period (1975–1999). We examine the role of
reputation in the market response to product defects by
investigating how an automaker’s reputation affects mar-
ket share changes in response to these recalls and how
the automakers’ substitutability and level of general-
ism/specialism moderate reputational effects. The auto-
mobile industry provides a context that allows us to use
several well-established sources of information about
organizational reputation. Automaker reputations carry
an expectation of product quality, and good-reputation
automakers are generally believed to have higher-quality
products than poor-reputation automakers (Devaraj et al.
2001, Podolny and Hsu 2003). There is also, how-
ever, a degree of uncertainty about the actual underly-
ing quality of each automaker’s products, which means
that consumers tend to rely on the historical results
of road tests, consumer surveys, and the market analy-
ses of prestigious institutions as sources of information
about product quality. This means that consumers’ use
of automobile brand as a signal of quality can lead to
perceptions that differ from the actual underlying qual-
ity of products. For example, “one study showed that
GM-marqued cars rolling off its joint plant with Toyota
in California were worth less after a few years than iden-
tical cars with Toyota badges” (The Economist 2002),
suggesting that although actual quality was identical in
this case, perceptions of quality differed.

two separate mechanisms that

Reputational Disadvantage in Market
Reaction to Defects
lead
We ﬁrst suggest
to the prediction that good-reputation ﬁrms are more
likely to suffer penalties from product defects than poor-
reputation ﬁrms are. The ﬁrst mechanism relates to con-
sumers’ differing reactions to defects across levels of
reputation. The second mechanism concerns differential
media reactions.

The Expectancy Violation Effect
The differentiating role of reputation on market penal-
ties is predicted by the proposition that ﬁrm reputation
helps create expectations about a ﬁrm’s products among
potential buyers (Shapiro 1983). A good reputation con-
ferred on a ﬁrm enhances a buyer’s expectation that the
ﬁrm’s products will be of high quality, which in turn
increases the buyer’s quality reliance. However, buy-
ers do not place high expectations on a product from
a ﬁrm with a low reputation. The marketing literature
has long shown the existence of market segments, with
some consumers focused on high quality/high price and
others focused on low quality/low price (e.g., Heath and
Chatterjee 1995). As long as buyers share expectations

about product quality across reputations, the order of
reputation naturally translates into the ordering of qual-
ity expectations.

Furthermore, quality expectations can be viewed as an
implicit promise from ﬁrms to their potential customers
to produce goods with a quality level commensurate with
reputation and product expectations. Given this, the bet-
ter a ﬁrm’s reputation, the greater the extent to which
its product defects will be perceived as a breach of
this implicit promise. Consequently, the negative reper-
cussions from the disclosure of product defects will
be stronger for high-reputation products. This specula-
tion has also been interpreted as an expectancy-violation
effect (Burgoon and LePoire 1993), where people react
more strongly to actions that violate their previous
expectations of how the other party is likely to behave.
Marketing research has shown that different market
segments are likely to react differently to expectancy
violations (Heath and Chatterjee 1995). There is also
work suggesting that consumers of high-reputation (i.e.,
high-quality) ﬁrms might be more sensitive to product
defects by these ﬁrms and more likely to penalize these
automakers by switching to other brands. First, comfort
and low maintenance costs are important predictors of
luxury car ownership (and by implication, not as impor-
tant to lower-end car ownership) (Sukhdial et al. 1995).
A recall is a threat to low maintenance costs and might
cause switching. Also, losing quality is generally quite
aversive to consumers (Hardie et al. 1993) and is more
likely to occur at the higher end of the quality distribu-
tion than the lower end (Simonson and Tversky 1992).
Thus, consumers at the low end have lower expectations
about defects, which means that the high end of the mar-
ket gets hurt more than the low end in a recall situation.
This reputational disadvantage in the social penalty
associated with the disclosure of product defects can be
formally modeled using a Bayesian learning model of
beliefs. With Bayesian learning, consumers begin with
prior beliefs of producers’ product quality. They then
make buying decisions based on these beliefs, and they
modify their beliefs in the light of their direct and/or
indirect experience using Bayes’ rule (Stigler 1983). An
essential notion in the Bayesian learning model is that
consumers modify their beliefs on the basis of the extent
to which observed quality performance differs from their
prior beliefs (Cyert and DeGroot 1987). When con-
sumers believe that a producer has a high-quality product
(e.g., Lexus), they are more likely to modify their beliefs
after observing a defect in that producer’s products than
they are with a defect in a relatively poor-quality prod-
uct (e.g., Kia). This mechanism thus provides a plausible
way in which the disclosure of product defects entails
more market penalty for good reputation products.

Differential Attention from the Media
A second explanation for why good-reputation ﬁrms
might suffer more market penalty is that the product

103

defects of good-reputation ﬁrms are likely to receive
more attention from the mass media. Many noticeable
defects in ﬁrms’ products or services, such as product
recalls and operational accidents/incidents, are reported
and evaluated by the mass media. In the year 2000,
for example, The Wall Street Journal included about
100 articles dealing with product recalls and about
80 articles reporting airline accidents. As there are likely
to be time and energy constraints on the extent to which
the media can attend to product defects (Cyert and
March 1963), the media are likely to engage in pay-
ing selective, rather than exhaustive, attention to the dis-
closure of product defects (cf. Hayward et al. 2004,
Rindova et al. 2006).

An important criterion in selecting product defects to
publicize would be how much potential attention the
event is likely to attract. Journalists have long insisted
that prominence is an obvious attention trigger, and peo-
ple are likely to pay more attention to articles that report
on a prominent target or set of events (Hoffman and
Ocasio 2001). Fombrun and Shanley (1990) posit that
reputation is positively related to media attention (cf.
Deephouse 2000). And individuals tend to pay more
attention to salient information (Tversky and Kahneman
1974). These arguments suggest the product defects of
high-reputation ﬁrms are more likely to be spotlighted
than those of low-reputation ﬁrms, because prestigious
products are widely and popularly known, and, more
important, the defects of those prestigious products are
an unexpected and salient event.

To examine whether this process might be occurring,
we looked at the media attention paid to the recalls
of a high-reputation and a low-reputation auto ﬁrm.
According to Consumer Reports, Kia has the least cus-
tomer satisfaction of any of the major car brands, and
Lexus has the most (Consumer Reports, 1995–1999).
Lexus announced six product recalls over the 1995–1999
period, and Kia announced four recalls. According to a
Lexis/Nexis search of general interest publications, the
Lexus recalls were reported 27 times in general newspa-
pers and 18 times in The Wall Street Journal. The Kia
recalls were mentioned six times in the general newspa-
pers and four times in The Wall Street Journal. Thus, the
Lexus coverage was approximately 7 newspaper reports
per recall, while the Kia coverage was approximately
2.5 newspaper reports per recall. While this is obviously
not conclusive evidence, it does suggest disproportion-
ate media coverage for high-reputation ﬁrms’ product
defects, which seems to support the idea that product
defects of high-reputation ﬁrms draw a larger reaction
than those of low-reputation ﬁrms.

To summarize thus far, it may be that good-reputation
ﬁrms suffer a “liability” when their products are shown
to be defective, relative to poor-reputation ﬁrms. This
is because of the expectancy-violation effect, combined
with the fact that mass media are more likely to draw

consumer attention to the defects of good-reputation
ﬁrms than poor-reputation ﬁrms.

Reputational Advantage in Market
Reaction to Defects
In contrast to the arguments for the disadvantage of rep-
utation above, several sociological (and sociopsycholog-
ical) works on prestige and status support mechanisms
that lead in the opposite direction—suggesting that good
reputation could be an advantage in the product-defect
case.

First, an institutional perspective suggests that rep-
utation and reputation orderings are fairly stable and
thus resistant to change in the face of quality prob-
lems. Goffman’s (1956) study of deference systems in
society suggests that reputation orderings will acquire
ritual properties and legitimacy over time. Through a
sequence of institutionalization processes—e.g., habit-
ualization, objectiﬁcation, and sedimentation (Tolbert
and Zucker 1996)—reputational orderings are likely to
become resistant to change. Because the legitimization
of reputation orderings involves connecting this order-
ing to wider cultural frames or rules by ascribing cog-
nitive validity to its meanings (Berger and Luckmann
1967), organizations with good reputations will enjoy
support from their audiences. The legitimacy and cul-
tural support vested in reputation might then provide
the high-reputation organizations with an institutionally
based advantage that helps decrease market losses from
their product defects.

The operation of legitimation processes (Scott 2001)
in reputational orderings is likely to enhance the sta-
bility of these reputation structures. Legitimacy implies
the support of market actors through the mechanism
of authorization; consequently, a given market actor is
less likely to engage in destabilizing activity. Simi-
larly, the results of Zucker’s (1977) experiment suggest
that a reputation structure that has become institutional-
ized and legitimized is one that is taken for granted as
being efﬁcacious and necessary. This taken-for-granted
status can serve as an important source of cultural
persistence and stability in good reputation. Therefore,
good-reputation organizations might be resilient to the
revelation of product defects that could hurt their rep-
utations, because market analysts and consumers resist
changes in reputation ordering, which is collectively
regarded as appropriate.

Second, social cognition processes underlying the
reputational advantage in cushioning the disclosure of
product defects can be derived from the tendency of
industry experts to commit to their previous decision
rules in evaluating each ﬁrm’s product quality. In gen-
eral, consumers’ perceptions of product quality rely
heavily on a variety of consumer audience media that
cover industry experts’ reports on each ﬁrm’s product

Rhee and Haunschild: The Liability of Good Reputation
Organization Science 17(1), pp. 101–117, © 2006 INFORMS

(Fombrun 1996; Zuckerman 1999, 2000; Podolny and
Hsu 2003). These experts employ their own decision cri-
teria and procedures, which are expected to be valid and
reliable. Yet the judgments of these experts are subject
to biases and inﬂuences from various factors (Vaaler and
McNamara 2004). Objectively, if the ﬁrms score high by
expert decision criteria, then produce defective products,
the credibility of these criteria should be questioned. Yet
in this case, research on escalation of commitment sug-
gests that experts might be trapped in the “escalation
phenomenon,” or the tendency to adhere to a course of
action even in the face of negative information concern-
ing the viability of that course of action (Staw 1981).
That is, industry experts may escalate commitment to
their decision rules and criteria in judging product qual-
ity following the receipt of negative feedback on the
rules, rather than reducing their commitment, as would
be predicted by trial-and-error learning.

These commitment effects on prior decisions have
been demonstrated in several contexts and across many
populations of individuals, including those with sub-
stantial managerial experience and expertise (e.g., Staw
and Ross 1987, Schoorman 1988). Research on auditors
can enlighten the process behind auto industry experts
because in both cases, the “expert” is supposed to be an
objective outsider evaluating the quality of a given ﬁrm’s
product. Yet a series of studies (Messier and Quilliam
1992, Church and Schneider 1993, Tan 1995, Brody and
Kaplan 1996, Moore et al. 2006) shows that auditors,
whether internal or external, who have been involved in
prior auditing decisions will tend to engage in escalation
behavior because of fear of damage to their self-image
and are thus reluctant to change their earlier decisions.
In sum, expectancy-violation effects and selective
attention of the media to the defects of good-reputation
ﬁrms suggest these ﬁrms will be especially penalized
by the market for their defects. On the other hand,
institutional processes and escalation of commitment to
quality rankings by experts suggest that good-reputation
ﬁrms will be buffered from market reactions to product
defects. We therefore propose the following competing
hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1a. The better a ﬁrm’s reputation, the
greater the market penalty that results from the disclo-
sure of a product defect by that ﬁrm.

Hypothesis 1b. The better a ﬁrm’s reputation, the
lower the market penalty that results from the disclosure
of a product defect by that ﬁrm.

Boundary Conditions
As noted earlier, we are also interested in examin-
ing the boundary conditions that affect a relationship
between reputation and market penalty. While most stud-
ies on organizational reputation have shown a unilateral

effect of reputation on various outcomes, we investigate
the possibility that because the reputation is entwined
with the situational context (substitutability) and organi-
zational attributes (generalism/specialism), reputational
effects may not be as simple as previously thought.

Substitutability
White’s socioeconomic model of production (2002)
implies that substitutability between producers that share
similar locations in a quality ordering serves as a root
of buyer power and also puts considerable pressure on
producers to lower prices. Burt’s structural model (1982)
suggests that structurally equivalent actors are redun-
dant and substitutable, and thus vulnerable to potential
devaluation by others. Given that similar quality reputa-
tion positions indicate structurally equivalent deference
and endorsements from the market (cf. Podolny and Hsu
2003), it can be argued that the efﬁcacy of a ﬁrm’s repu-
tation in the product defect situation is likely to be lim-
ited by its substitutability with other ﬁrms. For example,
it is possible that when other ﬁrms with a comparable
level of reputation exist and switching costs are low, con-
sumers will easily withdraw their attachment to a high-
reputation ﬁrm when it experiences product problems.1
Generalizing the work of Gould (2002) on the dynam-
ics of status hierarchies provides more direct insight
into the conditions under which attachment to a high-
reputation ﬁrm is lessened. Gould’s model suggests that
attachments to a high-reputation ﬁrm depend not only
on reputational attributes but also on the substitutability
of that ﬁrm. In a market with substitutes of comparable
reputation, the disclosure of product defects by a high-
reputation ﬁrm is likely to shift attention to substitutes
for that ﬁrm’s product.

On the other hand, if potential consumers have few
comparable alternatives to a high-reputation ﬁrm, they
might be reluctant to retract those attachments, even if
the ﬁrm experiences a product defect. Under such a low
level of substitutability, the costs and risks (e.g., costs in
searching alternatives with lower levels of reputation and
the potential dissatisfaction after choosing among those
alternatives) of deviating from a high-reputation ﬁrm are
likely to be much larger than the costs and risks (e.g.,
potential repetition of the same product defect and sub-
sequent repair costs) of staying with the high-reputation
ﬁrm, even given the higher uncertainty from the revela-
tion of a product defect. Thus, the low level of substi-
tutability may counteract the Bayesian model of market
learning by making consumers less sensitive to the dis-
closure of product defects.

The above arguments suggest that substitutability will
weaken the beneﬁcial effects of a good reputation. This
means that if it is true that good-reputation ﬁrms suf-
fer more market penalty from recalls (Hypothesis 1a),
this effect should be stronger with more substitutabil-
ity (i.e., they suffer more penalty). On the other hand,

105

if it is true that good-reputation ﬁrms suffer less mar-
ket penalty from recalls (Hypothesis 1b),
this effect
should be weaker with substitutability (i.e., they get less
beneﬁt). Applying the above arguments to the product
defect situation, we hypothesize the following contin-
gency effects on Hypotheses 1a and 1b:

Hypothesis 2a. The negative effect of an organiza-
tion’s reputation on market response to its product defect
is strengthened by substitutability (more competitors at
a comparable level of reputation).

Hypothesis 2b. The positive effect of an organiza-
tion’s reputation on market response to its product defect
is weakened by substitutability (more competitors at a
comparable level of reputation).

Generalism/Specialism
Several recent studies have found that organizational
identity is related to whether that organization is a spe-
cialist or a generalist (cf. Carroll et al. 2002). In their
study of American beer brewing, for example, Carroll
and Swaminathan (2000) found that small specialist
breweries (microbreweries and brewpubs) remained suc-
cessful even after large generalist breweries (mass pro-
duction breweries and contract breweries) learned to
produce beers with a comparable or higher level of qual-
ity. The authors attribute the success of specialist brew-
eries to the appeal of specialists’ identity as producers
who use authentic and legitimized production methods.
Due to market norms about how specialty beer should
be produced, consumers believe that specialist breweries
have more expertise in high-quality beers.

Carroll et al. (2002) enter into a more direct dis-
cussion on how market evaluations relate to general-
ism/specialism. They claim that this evaluation depends
on uncertainty in production process2 and the costs of
a breakdown. When both uncertainty in the produc-
tion process and the costs of a breakdown are high
(e.g., investment banking and auditing), consumers eval-
uate generalists more favorably, as shown by Park and
Podolny (2000). However, when both production pro-
cess uncertainty and the costs of a breakdown are low
(e.g., beer), specialist organizations will receive higher
product valuations from the market. Because automotive
production is likely to be a case where production pro-
cess uncertainty is low and breakdowns are fairly low
cost (Podolny and Hsu 2003), it is likely that specialist
automakers are more likely than generalists to command
higher product valuations as a result of their specialist
identity.

Similarly, Zuckerman and Kim (2003) ﬁnd the pos-
itive effect of a focused, clear identity on valuation in
their study of the feature ﬁlm market. They show that
a prerequisite for a ﬁlm’s success in obtaining a high
valuation is that the ﬁlm be assigned membership in a
category (independent or major) by critics. Films not

classiﬁed face an identity crisis, resulting from conﬂicts
with the set of identities critics use. Thus, a primary
strategic imperative in the ﬁlm market is to pursue pure
specialization. Zuckerman and Kim (2003) claim that
in addition to feature ﬁlms, this argument is applicable
to other industries where a categorical system is ﬁrmly
established, such as the auto market.

The above arguments suggest that specialization will
strengthen the beneﬁcial effects of a good reputation.
This means that if it is true that good-reputation ﬁrms
suffer more market penalty from recalls (Hypothesis 1a),
this effect should be weaker for specialists (i.e., they
suffer less penalty). On the other hand, if it is true that
good-reputation ﬁrms suffer less market penalty from
recalls (Hypothesis 1b), this effect should be stronger
for specialists (i.e., they get more beneﬁt). Applying
the above arguments to the product defect situation,
we hypothesize the following contingency effects on
Hypotheses 1a and 1b:

Hypothesis 3a. The negative effect of an automaker’s
reputation on market response to its product defect is
weaker for specialists.

Hypothesis 3b. The positive effect of an automaker’s
reputation on market response to its product defect is
stronger for specialists.

Method
As noted earlier, our research setting is the automobile
industry. Our sample is all automakers that sold passen-
ger cars in the United States during at least one year
from 1975 to 1999. We chose the automaker (e.g., Buick,
Lexus) rather than the auto ﬁrm (e.g., GM, Toyota)
or model (e.g., Regatta, Regal) as our unit of analy-
sis. There is research in marketing that suggests that
automaker brands (e.g., Jaguar) are more important than
model brands (e.g., S-type) or company brands (e.g.,
Ford) in market reputation (Sullivan 1998, Taran 2001).
Also, to the extent that any of our proposed processes
apply to the model rather than the maker level, our anal-
yses represent a conservative test of our hypotheses.

During our study period, 54 automakers sold pas-
senger cars; 72% of these automakers were non-U.S.
companies. Some automakers operated over the whole
research period, while others entered or exited the U.S.
auto market at certain times. We identiﬁed the sam-
ple companies using the biennial Ward’s Automotive
Yearbook and the weekly Automotive News between
1975 and 1999,
inclusive. A few automakers that
have sold a small ﬁxed number of cars (e.g., Ferrari,
Lamborghini, Maserati, Aston Martin, Austin, Lotus,
and Rolls/Bentley) are excluded from the study due to
limited availability of information. Moreover, because
loss in market sales is included as a key variable for
testing our hypotheses, it seems inappropriate to include

these automakers, whose product sales are determined
by the ﬁxed numbers of cars, as demand may be higher
than supply in these cases. Triumph was also excluded,
as information on key variables was not available for this
maker. The ﬁnal sample includes 15 U.S. automakers
and 31 foreign automakers.

Independent Variable: Product Defects
We use ofﬁcial product recalls as our measure of prod-
uct defects for these automakers. Product recall informa-
tion was obtained from National Highway Trafﬁc Safety
Administration (NHTSA) reports that were provided to
the U.S. Department of Transportation. Since Congress
passed the National Trafﬁc and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (NTMVSA) in 1966, which is enforced through
the NHTSA, automakers have been required to produce
vehicles that meet federally determined safety standards.
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards set minimum
performance levels for those parts of the vehicle that
affect safe operation (brakes, engine, steering system,
tires, and lighting) and that protect drivers and passen-
gers from death and serious injury in the event of a crash
(e.g., air bags, safety belts, and child restraints). These
standards are applicable to all vehicles and equipment
manufactured for sale in the United States and certi-
ﬁed for use on public roads and highways. Automak-
ers whose vehicles are deemed not to be in compliance
with standards are subject to motor vehicle or equipment
recalls. Since the act was passed, approximately 225 mil-
lion cars, trucks, buses, recreational vehicles, motorcy-
cles and mopeds, as well as 25 million tires have been
recalled to correct safety defects. We obtained data on
all recalls and their dates for our sampled ﬁrms from the
NHTSA database. The 46 automakers sampled in this
study experienced a total of 1,853 recalls over the period
studied, for an average of 2.26 recalls per automaker per
year. Figure 1 presents both total and average numbers
of recalls by year (1975–1999). Both total and average
number of recalls appear to ﬂuctuate, with no clear lin-
ear trend over the period studied. In general, however,
there were more recalls during Democratic administra-
tions than Republican ones.

Given that market responses to a product recall may
be different depending on the severity of the recall
(Reilly and Hoffer 1983), we present a separate analysis
of severe and nonsevere recalls. The NHTSA has estab-
lished several criteria to judge the severity of each recall.
The NHTSA reports list the hazard level of each recall,
with Type A representing signiﬁcant hazard without the
manufacturer’s warning, Type B representing signiﬁcant
hazard with warning, Type C potential safety hazard,
and Type D low risk of signiﬁcant harm. As part of our
analysis, we separate severe recalls (those involving sig-
niﬁcant hazard—A or B) from nonsevere recalls (Type C
or D).

Independent Variable: Reputation
The auto industry has many potentially fruitful mea-
sures of automaker reputation. However, because it is
not clear exactly what speciﬁc measures of reputation
would be appropriate, we used a combined approach to
identify and test multiple measures. We ﬁrst searched for
measures that have been used in published studies. We
also used an inductive approach by distributing a short
questionnaire to 19 persons with extensive auto indus-
try experience who had agreed to provide information
about their opinions of automaker reputations. We asked
each respondent to identify indicators that they thought
might serve as a signal of an automaker’s product qual-
ity and thus affect consumers’ subjective evaluation of
the quality. Our approach produced two broad types of
indicators.

Third-Party Ratings. First, previous quality ratings
provided by third parties is one key component affect-
ing perceptions of quality. Levin (2000), Deveraj et al.
(2001), and Podolny and Hsu (2003) discuss how third-
party ratings are a key component of quality judgments
on automotive products (and thus reputation/status order-
ings). In our questionnaire, all respondents noted previ-
ous quality ratings as a key component of consumers’

107

collective perception of product quality. Almost all the
respondents suggested Consumer Reports: Buying Guide
and J. D. Power & Associates as the most important
car-rating sources in the United States. Both of these rat-
ing services use data that is based on the experiences of
actual owners of new or used vehicles. Using the experi-
ences of actual owners is relevant for this study because
those direct experiences with cars are easily expanded
to a collective perception of the cars through word of
mouth.

We therefore developed a measure of reputation using
previous quality ratings in Consumer Reports and J. D.
Power and Associates publications. We use the ﬁve-point
scale “trouble indexes” in Consumer Reports. We cal-
culate the mean of the “overall problem rate” scores of
each model for the most recent three years of owner-
ship. We choose the scores only for these three years of
ownership because a survey implemented by WardsAuto
Corporation revealed in 1999 that most readers (82%)
of Consumer Reports paid attention to the scores for
the most recent three years of ownership, and the mean
of those scores were highly correlated with that for the
older model years (corr. = 0(cid:1)87 in the 1999 issues of
Consumer Reports). We then create an overall problem
rate score for an automaker in a year by averaging the
overall problem rate scores of all car models with the
automaker in that year. Because an automaker’s reputa-
tion is assumed to derive from the prior quality ratings
of the maker, an average score over the ﬁve years prior
to the selected year is used.3

Second, we use “initial ratings,” which have been
published by the J. D. Power Consumer Center since
1990, as another source of previous quality ratings for an
automaker. Initial ratings consist of six scores, ranging
from 2 to 5, across different criteria, and are obtained by
J. D. Power from consumer ratings of vehicles purchased
after the ﬁrst few months of ownership. We ﬁrst calcu-
late the mean of the six scores for each model and then
create an automaker’s score in a year by averaging those
mean scores of all car models within the automaker in
that year. Again, an average score over the ﬁve years
prior to the selected year was measured.

We then combine these two scores (trouble index and
initial ratings) into a single index of an automaker’s
reputation using principal components analysis (Jackson
1991). A separate factor analysis conﬁrms that those two
scores load on a single factor accounting for 86.6% of
the two scores’ combined variance. Following Podolny
and his colleagues (e.g., Benjamin and Podolny 1999),
who highlight the relativistic property of reputation, this
single measure is then rescaled so that the highest repu-
tation automaker in a given year has a reputation score
of 1 and the lowest reputation automaker has a score
of 0.

Depreciation Rates. Many questionnaire respondents
also encouraged us to consider the depreciation rate of

108

an automaker’s price over time to measure its reputation.
The earlier example of the study showing the GM cars to
be worth less than identical Toyota cars after a few years
also suggests the value of using the depreciation rate as
an indicator of quality reputation. The price of new cars
is ﬁxed by the manufacturers’ objectives, cost analyses,
and quality analyses. However, the price of a used car
is an indication of the collective valuation of that car,
because the used car price can be regarded as a car’s
value that results from “the implicit negotiation between
sellers and buyers” (personal conversation, December 5,
2002, information manager at the Kelley Blue Book in
Irvine, CA). Thus, the price of a used car weighted by
its original new car price, which can be formulated as
the depreciation rate, is likely to be highly correlated
with collective perceptions of that car’s quality (Sullivan
1998) and thus the automaker’s reputation. This suggests
that the lower the depreciation rate of a car’s price, the
higher the car’s reputation.

To calculate depreciation rate, we use the Kelley Blue
Book: Used Car Guide (Western edition) series, which
was ﬁrst published in 1926. We use the last
issue
(November–December) of each year to calculate “list
prices” (the original suggested retail price) and “sug-
gested retail values,” which represent the Kelley Blue
Book’s estimated asking price. We measure a car model’s
depreciation rate of price in selected year T as the depre-
ciation rate of its T − 3 year-model price during the
three-year period. We calculate an automaker’s deprecia-
tion rate of price in a year by averaging the depreciation
rates of all car models’ prices of that automaker in that
year. The depreciation rate is then rescaled such that the
automaker with the lowest depreciation rate in any given
year has a score of 1 and the automaker with the highest
depreciation rate has a score of 0.

Composite Measure. The third measure of reputation
is created by combining third-party ratings and depreci-
ation rates into a single variable using principal compo-
nents analysis. A separate factor analysis conﬁrms that
those two scores load on a single factor accounting for
83.3% of the two scores’ combined variance. The com-
posite variable is then rescaled again such that the high-
est reputation automaker has a reputation score of 1 and
the lowest 0.

The left three columns in Table 1 present the scores
of our three reputation measures for the automakers in
our sample in 1999. In general, Japanese and German
automakers possess higher reputations than the automak-
ers from other countries. Despite their overall high
correlation (see Table 2), however, there are some dis-
crepancies between the three indicators of reputation.
For example, although Lexus, Inﬁniti, and Acura have
the highest reputation scores measured by third-party
ratings, they receive much lower reputation scores mea-
sured by depreciation rates. Some industry experts con-
sulted for this study speculate that because those makers

Rhee and Haunschild: The Liability of Good Reputation
Organization Science 17(1), pp. 101–117, © 2006 INFORMS

are newer than their sister makers (Toyota, Nissan, and
Honda), they receive lower resale valuations. In contrast,
BMW and Volkswagen have higher scores in deprecia-
tion rates than in third-party ratings. Our interviewees
note that these makers have become popular with the
public due to other features (e.g., excitement), which
allows the makers to enjoy higher resale values. Regard-
less of these discrepancies, however, it should be noted
that reputation orderings will never be completely uni-
form across different indicators.

Independent Variable: Substitutability
In our study, substitutability is proxied by the extent
to which a reputation level is crowded by automak-
ers. We thus measure an automaker’s substitutability as
the total number of other automakers whose reputation
scores are within one standard deviation of reputation
scores, which is measured on the industry level in a
given year. The greater the number of such automakers,
the more substitutable the focal automaker. To check the
robustness of our results, we also use different criteria
of deﬁning substitutability boundaries, ranging from a
half standard deviation to two standard deviations, and
ﬁnd very little change in the results (results are available
from the authors).4

Independent Variable: Generalism/Specialism
We use two measures of generalism/specialism. Follow-
ing Dobrev et al. (2002), we ﬁrst use the spread of
engine capacity (measured in liters) over all car mod-
els that an automaker produced in a given year. The
choice of engine capacity reveals the range of automak-
ers’ technological offerings and their competitive market
strategies, because technological space directly affects
automakers’ marketing and supply chain management
(for a more detailed rationale for this measure, see the
papers cited above). The spread of engine capacity is
measured as the largest minus the smallest engine capac-
ity. Specialists tend to produce a small number of vehi-
cles with a narrow range of engine capacity, such as
Kia. Generalists tend to produce vehicles over a large
range of capacities, such as Ford, which has the Festiva
(∼1.5 liter), the Focus (1.5 liter–2.0 liter), the Contour
(2.0 liter–3.0 liter), the Mustang (3.0 liter–4.0 liter), and
the Excursion (∼4.0 liter). Thus, the lower the value
for the spread of engine size, the greater the level of
specialism.

However, as each car model within an automaker may
represent a distinctive market segment that is captured
not only by engine capacity but also by price and con-
sumer taste, we use a second, less technologically exclu-
sive indicator of generalism/specialism: the number of
car models an automaker produced in a given year, with
fewer models being an indicator of specialism. We ﬁnd
a high correlation (cid:3)=0(cid:1)60(cid:4) between these two compo-
nents and thus combine them into a single index using

principal components analysis. A factor analysis con-
ﬁrms that the two scores load on a single factor, account-
ing for 78.7% of the two scores’ combined variance. The
right column in Table 1 presents the scores of general-
ism for the automakers in our sample in 1999. Overall,
U.S. automakers are more likely to be generalists than
foreign automakers are.

Dependent Variable (Market Share Change) and
Model Speciﬁcation
In our hypotheses, we predict that an automaker’s repu-
tation affects the (negative) impact of its product defects
(recalls in our data). We use market share as the depen-
dent variable in this analysis because market shares,
unlike sales units, are not affected by temporal ﬂuctu-
ations in seasonal demand. The dependent variable is
therefore, the rate of change in an automaker’s market
share over the observation period. Consistent with prior
studies of auto recalls (Crafton et al. 1981, Reilly and
Hoffer 1983, Borenstein and Zimmerman 1988), we use
month as the unit of time on the assumption that a longer

period would make it difﬁcult to detect the effect of a
recall event because there are so many intervening events
that could affect market share. For example, automak-
ers may increase their advertising and public relations
efforts after a recall in an attempt to manage the negative
publicity that comes with the recall. Our interviews with
industry experts suggest that this is the case. However, as
noted later in this paper, we also model and test different
market share lags. Data on automakers’ monthly market
share come from their reports to Automotive News.

We model the change rate of an automaker’s market

shares using the following power function:
Mi(cid:7) t = M (cid:9)

it−1exp(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:5)SEit−1+(cid:13)(cid:5)NEit−1+(cid:15)(cid:5)Rit−1+(cid:17)(cid:5)Sit−1
(1)

+ (cid:18)(cid:5)Nit−1 + (cid:19)(cid:5)Iit−1 + (cid:21)(cid:5)Cit−1(cid:4)(cid:23)(cid:1)

Here, Mit−1 is the market share of automaker i at month
t − 1; SEit−1 refers to a dummy variables indicating
whether automaker i experienced a severe product recall
(1) or not (0) during month t − 1; NEit−1 refers to
a dummy indicating the event of a nonsevere product

recall; Rit−1 refers to the reputation of automaker i; Sit−1
refers to substitutability; Nit−1 refers to level of general-
ism; Iit−1 represents a set of interaction terms (two-way
interaction of recall and reputation, three-way interac-
tion of recall, reputation, substitutability, and three-way
interaction of recall, reputation, and generalism); Cit−1
is a vector of control variables (described below); and (cid:23)
is a log normally distributed error term. Because there
could be cumulative effects of product recalls over a
longer period, we also include the number of recalls dur-
ing months (cid:3)t− 1(cid:4)–(cid:3)t− 12(cid:4) in our model. By transform-
ing Equation (1) to its natural logarithm, we obtain the
linear equation with a normally distributed error term,
(cid:24):

log(cid:3)Mi(cid:7) t(cid:4)

= (cid:9) log(cid:3)Mit−1(cid:4)+ (cid:10)(cid:5)SEit−1 + (cid:13)(cid:5)NEit−1 + (cid:15)(cid:5)Rit−1
+ (cid:17)(cid:5)Sit−1 + (cid:18)(cid:5)Nit−1 + (cid:19)(cid:5)Iit−1 + (cid:21)(cid:5)Cit−1 + (cid:24)(cid:1)

Estimation
We estimate the parameters of Equation (2) on unbal-
anced, pooled, cross-section,
time-series data with
monthly time periods; the number of observations varies
among automakers. Following recent analyses of lon-
gitudinal data (Baron et al. 2001, Dobrev et al. 2001),
we use generalized estimating equations (GEE) or
population-averaged (or marginal) estimators to analyze
both inter- and intraﬁrm variation (cf. Liang and Zeger
1986). Like quasilikelihood, GEE speciﬁes the relation-
ship between the mean and variance of the dependent
variable, rather than the full distribution of population, as
is required for the cluster-speciﬁc maximum likelihood
estimators, such as random effects or ﬁxed-effects mod-
els. GEE has solutions that are consistent and asymptot-
ically Gaussian, even when the time dependence is mis-
speciﬁed. We use the XTGEE procedure in STATA 7.0
by choosing the Gaussian distribution and the iden-
tity link. In addition, because repeated observations are
made on each automaker, we correct for correlation in
an automaker’s measurements using the “exchangeable”
version of the working correlation matrix. The serial
correlation of the residuals is constant across time lags.
Finally, we report robust standard errors using the “sand-
wich” estimators developed by Huber (1967) and White
(1982).

Control Variables
We control for three other factors that may affect an
automaker’s market share and its change. First, we
expect market share to vary with an automaker’s expe-
rience, which is proxied by sales age in our analysis.
Findings by organizational ecologists on the relation-
ship between age and organizational growth are not con-
sistent (cf. Carroll and Hannan 2000). Thus, we also
include squared sales age to explore a nonlinear relation-
ship. Sales age is measured as the differences between

111

the current month and the time the automaker entered the
U.S. automobile industry. As sales age is highly skewed,
we log it before entering it into the analysis.

Second, we create two dummy variables for foreign
automakers (Asian automakers and European automak-
ers), with the U.S. automakers as the reference cat-
egory, because foreign automakers may face different
market challenges/opportunities and governmental regu-
lations than domestic automakers do. Finally, we include
a variable measuring years elapsed from 1975 to capture
any time trend effects associated with changes in market
share.5

Results
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics and correlations
for variables used in the analysis. Mean monthly mar-
ket share is 3.19%, with a standard deviation of 3.89%.
Several of the control variables are fairly highly corre-
lated. Sales age, for example, has a somewhat high cor-
relation with generalism, and foreign automakers tend
to be more specialized than U.S. automakers. Asian
automakers entered the market later than U.S. makers
but generally have higher reputations than U.S. mak-
ers. The high correlations among these controls may
point to possible problems with multicollinearity. Fol-
lowing Sine and his colleagues (Sine et al. 2003, 2005),
we orthogonalized highly correlated variables (cumula-
tive recalls, level of generalism, and country of origin)
using a modiﬁed Gram-Schmidt procedure (cf. Saville
and Wood 1991) so that all variance-inﬂation factors and
condition indexes become less than 2.5 and 30, respec-
tively (cf. Belsley et al. 1980). This technique partials
out the common variance and constructs an orthonor-
mal basis for any set of linearly independent vectors.6
We used the “orthog” command in Stata 8 to generate
orthogonalized variables. We also address potential mul-
ticollinearity between main effects and interaction terms
by centering variables prior to calculating interactions
(cf. Cronbach 1987).

Table 3 presents the results from GEE estimates of
the change in market share model shown in Equa-
tion (2). Model 1 of Table 3 is the base model, con-
taining only the control variables. The second-order
effect of sales age is positive and signiﬁcant, indicat-
ing a U-shaped relationship between sales experience
and market share growth. Asian automakers have greater
market share growth, but European automakers have less
market share growth than U.S. automakers. The sig-
niﬁcant, negative effect of time trend on market share
growth might indicate increasing competition in the U.S.
automotive industry over the study period.7 The num-
bers of both severe and nonsevere recalls during months
(cid:3)t − 2(cid:4)–(cid:3)t − 12(cid:4) produce no signiﬁcant effects. These
nonsigniﬁcant results for older recalls are consistent with
other studies (Crafton et al. 1981, Reilly and Hoffer

1983, Borenstein and Zimmerman 1988) and support the
idea that using one month prior recalls is best because it
minimizes potential noise in the data due to automaker
responses to their recalls (e.g., sales promotions).8

Models 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 include third-party ratings
as the measure of reputation, and Models 3-1, 3-2, and
3-3 include depreciation rates. Models 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3
include the combined measure, which produces the best
model ﬁt. All results are consistent across the different
measures of reputation.

Models 2-1, 3-1, and 4-1 add the main effects of all
key variables in our study. As shown in these mod-
els, automakers with a severe product recall in the prior
month do suffer more market penalty (i.e., decreased
market share) in the following month, but nonsevere
recalls produce no damage. The lack of signiﬁcance
for nonsevere recalls may be due to such recalls being
perceived by consumers as a signal of an automaker’s
diligence in attending to quality control issues, as they
found and ﬁxed a potential (but minor) problem. Thus, it
might be the case that such minor recalls help automak-
ers maintain public conﬁdence in their product.

Continuing with control variable results, Models 2-1,
3-1, and 4-1 show that all measures of automaker rep-
utation have positive and signiﬁcant effects on market
share growth (cf Shapiro 1983, Podolny and Phillips
1996, Sullivan 1998, Benjamin and Podolny 1999).
To illustrate the magnitude of the reputation effect
in Model 4-1, a one standard deviation (cid:3)=0(cid:1)255(cid:4)
increase in an automaker’s reputation score results in a
0.54% increase in the automaker’s monthly market share
(cid:3)= exp(cid:25)0(cid:1)0208 × 0(cid:1)255(cid:26) − 1 = 0(cid:1)0054(cid:4). The measure of
substitutability has no signiﬁcant main effect on mar-
ket share. Consistent with prior ﬁndings in the growth
rate models (e.g., Barnett et al. 2000), however, gen-
eralists have a greater market share growth rate than
specialists do.

In Models 2-2, 3-2, and 4-2, we present our test
of Hypotheses 1a and 1b, whether good reputation
increases (Hypothesis 1a) or decreases (Hypothesis 1b)
the market penalty resulting from a product recall.
Because our hypotheses concern the role of reputation
on the negative effect of product recalls, we test only for
the interaction of reputation with severe recalls, as only
severe recalls produce this negative effect. In support
of Hypothesis 1a (and not Hypothesis 1b), the coefﬁ-
cients of the interaction of severe recall and reputation
are signiﬁcant and negative. This can be interpreted as
evidence that high-reputation automakers suffer more
market penalty as a result of severe product recalls
than low-reputation automakers do. To illustrate this
effect, Model 4-2 shows that a severe recall decreases
a low reputation (0.2) automaker’s market share by
1.64% (cid:3)= exp(cid:25)0(cid:1)0230× 0(cid:1)2(cid:26)− exp(cid:25)−0(cid:1)0123+ 0(cid:1)0230×
0(cid:1)2 − 0(cid:1)0210 × 0(cid:1)2(cid:26) = 0(cid:1)0164(cid:4) but decreases a high-
reputation automaker’s (0.8) market share by 2.92%

113
(cid:3)= exp(cid:25)0(cid:1)0230 × 0(cid:1)8(cid:26) − exp(cid:25)−0(cid:1)0123 + 0(cid:1)0230 × 0(cid:1)8 −
0(cid:1)0210 × 0(cid:1)8(cid:26) = 0(cid:1)0292(cid:4). Chi-square difference tests
show that all two-way interaction term models (Mod-
els 2-2, 3-2, and 4-2) signiﬁcantly increase model ﬁt
(cid:3)p < 0(cid:1)01(cid:4) relative to the models with main effects alone
(Models 2-1, 3-1, and 4-1).

Models 2-3, 3-3, and 4-3 show that the moderating
effects of reputation in response to a severe product
recall are contingent on substitutability and general-
ism/specialism. In these models, we add two three-
way interaction terms: several recall × reputation ×
substitutability and severe recall × reputation × level of
generalism. In Hypothesis 2a we had predicted that the
negative effect of reputation on market response to a
product defect would be strengthened by substitutabil-
ity. In support of Hypothesis 2a, all three models show
negative and signiﬁcant three-way interaction effects.
These results provide support for the idea that market
share penalty for good-reputation automakers is greater
when that automaker is more substitutable, that is, has
more competitors with a comparable level of reputa-
tion. In Hypothesis 3a we had predicted that the neg-
ative effect of reputation on market response would be
weaker for specialists (i.e., specialists would be buffered
from the negative effects). In support of Hypothesis 3a,
all three models show negative three-way interaction
effects, though the effect for the depreciation reputation
measure is only marginally signiﬁcant using a two-tailed
test (i.e., p < 0(cid:1)10). All three models are statistically sig-
niﬁcant improvements over the prior two-way interaction
models (p < 0(cid:1)05 for Models 2-2 and 4-2; p < 0(cid:1)10 for
Model 3-2). This provides evidence that market share
penalty for good-reputation automakers is weaker for
specialists (and thus stronger for generalists).

Discussion
We started this paper by noting the importance of under-
standing how reputation effects operate in the con-
text of product recalls. Many theories support the idea
that good reputation provides beneﬁts: Firms with good
reputations enjoy lower costs and can charge higher
prices (e.g., Shapiro 1983, Podolny 1993, Sullivan 1998,
Benjamin and Podolny 1999), experience greater growth
in sales/status (e.g., Podolny and Phillips 1996), enjoy
protection against market entrants (e.g., Milgrom and
Roberts 1982), and experience greater returns relative
to actual quality (e.g., Benjamin and Podolny 1999).
Our contribution is in showing that, while reputation
has these beneﬁts, it is a “double-edged sword” in that
it also has a signiﬁcant downside. When ﬁrms make
mistakes, those with good reputations suffer more mar-
ket penalty than those with poor reputations do. To our
knowledge, there has been little discussion in the lit-
erature of the liabilities of a good reputation on ﬁrm
reputation. Responding to this gap in our understand-
ing of reputation effects, we theorized and modeled the

effects of product defects on market responses to ﬁrms
and found that high-reputation ﬁrms suffer liabilities in
this case.

One might think that a good reputation would buffer
ﬁrms from the vagaries of the market because of the
inertial properties of such reputations. Indeed, as noted
earlier, several status and institutional theories suggest
exactly this: Reputation orderings are inertial, and suc-
cess breeds success (and failure breeds failure) (e.g.,
Podolny 1993). If that is true, then the moderating effect
of reputation would be nonsigniﬁcant or perhaps even
positive. As we ﬁnd negative effects, our results high-
light the fact that the inertial effects of reputation are
limited in the case of product defects. This demonstrates
an important boundary condition on inertial effects. The
durability of reputation orderings does not seem to nec-
essarily mean that there are no counteractive forces, and
a product recall is one such force.

Why are these inertial effects not present in our study?
One possibility is that a serious product recall presents
consumers with information about quality that is rela-
tively unambiguous. The inertial properties of reputation
orderings depend on uncertainty about the underlying
quality of that ﬁrm’s products (White 2002, Podolny
and Hsu 2003). While there is some degree of uncer-
tainty surrounding an automotive ﬁrm’s quality, the level
of uncertainty is likely to be less than in some other
contexts, such as the arts or other industries where pro-
fessionalization is more important (Podolny and Hsu
2003). In addition, the presence of a regulatory agency
(NHTSA) helps consumers resolve uncertainty, and reg-
ulatory agencies are important in other industries as well
(e.g., pharmaceuticals). Thus, the level of uncertainty
surrounding the quality of a ﬁrm’s product, and the pres-
ence of regulatory agencies designed to help resolve
uncertainty, may be a limiting condition on the inertial
properties of reputation.

It could also be that the escalation of commitment
tendencies on the part of raters, which we hypothesized
earlier, just does not apply in a situation where there are
no penalties for the expert raters changing their ratings.
Unlike the earlier-mentioned situation where auditors
did not change their endorsements of ﬁrms’ account-
ing procedures, the automotive analysts do not stand to
personally beneﬁt from retaining their earlier endorse-
ments, nor are there any potential penalties in terms of
losing clients (e.g., readers of auto-rating magazines) by
changing ratings. Thus, the reward structure surround-
ing the situation is likely to affect experts’ escalation of
commitment.

Our study also offers evidence to conﬁrm the rela-
tively unstudied ideas that substitutability and general-
ism will inﬂuence the effect of reputation on market
penalty. Our results demonstrate that nonsubstitutability
signals uniqueness within quality reputation categories
and helps buffer good-reputation organizations from

market penalties. In contrast, high levels of substitutabil-
ity cause greater market penalties for good-reputation
organizations by facilitating the detachment of potential
consumers from their products. The paper also demon-
strates that specialism has a synergistic relationship with
organizational reputation, increasing the inertial effects
of reputation. Good-reputation specialists are more pro-
tected from market penalties than good-reputation gen-
eralists are. This leads us to suspect that in an industry
where most ﬁrms are specialists, we might still ﬁnd an
inertial effect of reputation. In short, whether reputa-
tion is sensitive (Hypothesis 1a) or not (Hypothesis 1b)
to product defects seems to be contingent on substi-
tutability and generalism/specialism. While sociological
research has theorized and evidenced the effect of sub-
stitutability and specialism on the valuation of products
themselves (e.g., Burt 1982, Carroll and Swaminathan
2000, Carroll et al. 2002, White 2002, Zuckerman and
Kim 2003), our study demonstrates that these factors can
also condition reputational (dis-)advantages.

Our study also suggests the importance of investi-
gating boundary conditions on status/reputation effects.
We have focused on the two organizational characteris-
tics, substitutability and generalism, which are closely
related to organizational uniqueness and identity, respec-
tively. However, there are likely to be many additional
characteristics that accelerate or decelerate the reputa-
tional effects. As we discussed above, uncertainty about
the actual quality of products may increase reputational
effects, leading consumers to be more like to rely on
reputation as a signal (cf. Podolny 1994). The extent
to which organizational reputation is dimensionalized
could provide another condition. One limitation of our
study is our exclusive focus on the quality dimen-
sion of reputation. There are many other dimensions
underlying organizational reputation,
including ﬁnan-
cial performance, social responsiveness, and institutional
ownership (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Thus, it would
be of great value to examine how a ﬁrm’s reputation
measured by the quality dimension affects reputation
measured by other dimensions. For example, studies
could investigate whether an automaker’s social respon-
sibility reputation increases or decreases the negative
effect of its quality reputation when a recall occurs (cf.
Zyglidopoulos 2001).

In addition, our

results showing that

the market
penalty only applies to severe recalls suggest that the lia-
bility effect may be sensitive to how a recall is perceived
by the market. In our study, we suggest that the nonneg-
ative market response to nonsevere recalls may be due
to the fact that mass media and other audiences are less
likely to focus attention on minor recalls. For example,
among the 98 recalls announced by the automakers in
our sample in 1998, all major recalls (63) were reported
by The Wall Street Journal, while only 60% of the minor
recalls were reported. However, this differential effect

may only apply to situations where companies have rel-
atively frequent problems (like recalls) and/or situations
where some events are minor and others are not, as the
minor events then provide a comparison with the major
events. Situations where the problems are less frequent
and/or all events are major, such as airline accidents or
other types of disasters, are likely to have more uniform
market penalties.

Conclusion
Our results have implications for both institutional the-
ories and work on organizational reputation. Our study
suggests that the institutional context surrounding rep-
utational orderings is subject to change, as consumers
do seem to penalize automakers that violate expecta-
tions and norms. Cultural support is withheld from these
ﬁrms. This is consistent with recent arguments about
changes in institutions and the need for more research on
these changes (e.g., Dacin et al. 2002, Strang and Sine
2002). In addition, the idea that the press is involved
in disseminating more information about the defects of
good-reputation ﬁrms (relative to poor-reputation ﬁrms)
suggests that these institutional logics for the mean-
ing of good reputation means might be reﬂected in the
press, and thus the press serves as a mediating struc-
ture for the dissemination of reputation standards/norms.
As our results cannot distinguish between individual
expectancy-violation effects and the effects of the busi-
ness press on the relationship between reputation and
penalty for recalls, future research attempting to disen-
tangle these explanations would be useful.

Our ﬁndings about the role of reputation and mar-
ket response by automotive ﬁrms suggest important fea-
tures of the interaction of ﬁrm errors and reputation.
Beyond automotive ﬁrms, the research presented here
points to the importance of studying reputation in other
areas. Other important product recalls like drugs and
children’s toys might be similarly affected by reputation
and moderated by substitutability and generalism. For
example, good-reputation drug ﬁrms may suffer more
market penalty for having to withdraw a drug from the
market, especially if there are other similar substitutes
available. Our results suggest this is especially likely for
generalist drug ﬁrms.

Other error situations, such as airline accidents and
corporate malfeasance, might also be affected by repu-
tation. As noted earlier, these errors are both less fre-
quent and less easily segmented into those that are minor
and those that are severe. For example, good-reputation
airlines (which might be those with few prior acci-
dents) might lose more customers after an accident than
poorer-reputation airlines would. The effects of reputa-
tion, market responses, and ﬁrm characteristics in these
error situations are clearly important and deserving of
further study.

115

And ﬁnally, the implication that ﬁrm reputation does
not provide protection in an error situation (e.g., a recall)
suggests that managers of good-reputation ﬁrms need
to be especially vigilant in their learning processes—
detecting and correcting errors. While there are many
beneﬁts from a good reputation, such a reputation cannot
be relied on as a buffer from negative reactions in all
situations.

Endnotes
1The resource-based view of the ﬁrm (e.g., Barney 1997) sug-
gests similar argument by showing that ﬁrms lose competitive
advantages when followers attain substitutable capabilities and
knowledge.
2Uncertainty in production process, which is deﬁned as uncer-
tainty in the stages and parts of manufacturing and services
provided, should be distinguished from uncertainty in prod-
uct quality. For example, although there is a low level of
uncertainty in the production process of wine (i.e., the man-
ufacturing stages are routine and predictable), uncertainty
surrounding wine product quality is fairly high (Benjamin
and Podolny 1999). In contrast,
there is a relatively high
level of uncertainty in the service processes of ﬂight atten-
dants, although their service quality can be judged with little
uncertainty.
3We also attempted to include a set of weighted averages
of previous quality ratings (e.g., heavier weight in the cur-
rent period) and found similar results. We use the unweighted
scores because they produced better model ﬁt.
4In this paper we measure only functional substitutability
because prior research suggests that
the substitutability of
products can be conceptualized by their proximity on one
attribute important to the product category (e.g., quality repu-
tation), even when they differ on other attributes (Sujan 1985,
White 2002). Given the multidimensional nature of the sub-
stitutability construct (cf. Ding 2004), however, future studies
incorporating measures of nonfunctional substitutability stem-
ming from other product attributes such as social prestige and
style of cars would be valuable.
5We also modeled time effects using other speciﬁcations (e.g.,
pre-1979 vs. post-1979; dummies for presidential adminis-
tration; and dummy variables for major changes in safety
standards) and found no changes in the signiﬁcance of our
hypothesized variables. We do not include these variables in
our model because they decrease model ﬁt.

iﬁed Gram-Schmidt procedure generates a better conditioned
set of vectors than the traditional Gram-Schmidt procedure.
7In a separate analysis, we found a signiﬁcant, positive inter-
action effect of Asian automakers and time trend, which sup-
ports the idea that Asian automakers have been increasing their
market share over time. We also found that U.S. automakers

showed signiﬁcantly higher market share growth during the
Reagan administration than during the Clinton administration.
Results are available on request from the authors.
8We have also done some robustness checks for changes in the
time window, which produced some interesting ﬁndings. First,
we found that the number of severe recalls during months
(cid:3)t−13(cid:4)–(cid:3)t−60(cid:4) has signiﬁcant (cid:3)p < 0(cid:1)05(cid:4) and negative effect
on market share, after controlling for the number of recalls
during months (cid:3)t − 2(cid:4)–(cid:3)t − 12(cid:4). Nonsevere recalls had no
such effect. Second, this negative effect is greater for good-
reputation automakers (cid:3)p < 0(cid:1)05(cid:4). This implies, therefore, that
our ﬁndings on the liability of good reputation represent both
short-term and long-term phenomena (but not medium term).
The longer-term penalty may be due to a decline in the effec-
tiveness of sales promotions undertaken in response to a recall.
This interpretation is necessarily speculative, which means that
more research examining timing effects is needed.
