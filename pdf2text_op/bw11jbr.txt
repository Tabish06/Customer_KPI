Recent corporate reputation research focuses on customers as an important stakeholder group for whom
ﬁrm reputation matters. The authors hypothesize that customer-based corporate reputation (CBR) may
affect customer citizenship behaviors (CCB) and that both commitment and loyalty mediate the CBR–CCB
relationship. The tests of the hypotheses use a sample of 583 service customers who evaluate the reputation
of service ﬁrms. These results suggest that commitment and loyalty mediate the relationship between CBR
and one type of CCB, that is, helping the company. The authors discuss the implications for marketing
research and practice.

1. Introduction

Research into the causal relationships between corporate reputation
and customer-outcome variables remains incomplete. Despite agreement
that positive perceptions of a ﬁrm's reputation relate positively to
customer satisfaction, trust, loyalty, and word-of-mouth behavior (e.g.,
Oliver and DeSarbo, 1988; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Walsh et al., 2009),
the way in which corporate reputation affects downstream variables, in
terms of customers' discretionary behaviors, is not clear. Customers
patronizing highly reputed ﬁrms tend to be more loyal and more
committed (Sung and Yang, 2008; Walsh et al., 2009). These customers
may also support highly reputed organizations with various voluntary,
extra-role behaviors, such as helping other customers improve the service
delivery or providing valuable feedback to the company. Such customer
citizenship behaviors (CCB) increasingly appear conductive to effective
organizational functioning (e.g., Bove et al., 2009; Gouthier and Schmid,
2003; Groth, 2005; Singh, 2000) and thus seem especially relevant to
service ﬁrms, which cannot achieve signiﬁcant productivity gains through
capital substitution (Oliva and Sterman, 2001).

So does a good corporate reputation directly improve CCBs? If so, how
are reputation and CCBs causally related to other behaviorally relevant
variables, in terms of commitment and loyalty? Services marketing
research underlines the importance of mediator effects of relational
variables, such as satisfaction or commitment, that account for variations
in behavioral outcomes (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2006;
Wang et al., 2003). The importance of mediator variables arises from their

ability to enhance the understanding of causal relationships between
variables. Insights into how corporate reputation, customer commitment,
and loyalty work together to unleash different types of CCBs represent
important steps for increasing understanding of the drivers of discretion-
ary consumer behaviors. However, no empirical study to date explores the
mediator effects of commitment and loyalty on the relationship between
ﬁrm reputation and CCBs.

Against this background, this study extends previous research by
embedding customer-based corporate reputation (CBR) in a conceptual
model that examines the direct effects of CBR on commitment, loyalty, and
CCBs. In addition, the authors explore whether the postulated direct
effects of CBR on CCBs may experience mediation by customer com-
mitment and loyalty. The ﬁndings offer new insights into the role of CBR
and the effects on key marketing outcomes, with important implications
for marketing theory and practice.

2. Customer-based corporate reputation

A strong corporate reputation provides a company signal and en-
courages reduced transaction costs, as well as other outcomes that beneﬁt
the company (e.g., Caruana et al., 2004; Einwiller et al., 2006; Rose and
Thomsen, 2004; Shapiro, 1983). Fombrun (1996) and Sung and Yang
(2008) suggest that customers of well-reputed organizations engage in
supportive behaviors. Therefore, a good reputation pays off because
customers attribute higher levels of competence and quality to the ﬁrm
and therefore support that ﬁrm. To capture the reputation perceptions
of customers, Walsh and Beatty (2007, p. 129) advance the concept of
customer-based corporate reputation (CBR), which they deﬁne as “the
customer's overall evaluation of a ﬁrm based on his or her reactions to


40

B. Bartikowski, G. Walsh / Journal of Business Research 64 (2011) 39–44

the ﬁrm's goods, services, communication activities, interactions with
the ﬁrm and/or its representatives or constituencies (such as employ-
ees, management, or other customers) and/or known corporate
activities.” Their CBR scale captures ﬁve dimensions of reputation, as
perceived by current customers of the ﬁrm: customer orientation
employer quality, ﬁnancial strength, product and service quality, and
social responsibility.

3. Hypotheses

The conceptual model in Fig. 1 draws on signaling, cognitive con-
sistency, and self-concept theories to explain the direct effects of CBR.
Motivated reasoning theory (Kunda, 1990) provides a basis for
explaining the mediator effects of commitment and loyalty in CBR–
CCB relationships.

3.1. Direct effects

Cognitive consistency theories (e.g., Heider, 1946; Osgood and
Tannenbaum, 1955) suggest that people strive to maintain psycho-
logical harmony among their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Incon-
sistencies cause psychological discomfort, which people seek to avoid
by developing intentions and engaging in behaviors that are consistent
with their beliefs. When customers attribute a good reputation to a ser-
vice ﬁrm, they likely have belief-consistent feelings of commitment,
favorable intentions to continue doing business with the company, or
other forms of goodwill to express toward the company (e.g., Bettencourt,
1997; Zeithaml et al., 1996). For example, Einwiller et al. (2006) posit that
customers' identiﬁcation with a company results in commitment, such
that customers with high identiﬁcation should have positive thoughts
and feelings about the company. Similarly, Bennett and Gabriel (2001)
argue that a favorable corporate reputation provides customers with
repeated positive reinforcement, which creates commitment-inducing
emotional bonds.

Hypothesis 1. CBR has a positive impact on customer commitment.

A ﬁrm's good reputation also is a signal of sound company
behavior toward market transactions overall, such that a better
reputation engenders not only higher levels of commitment but also
greater loyalty intentions. A ﬁrm's good reputation can reduce
customers' perceived risk and motivate them to do business with
the ﬁrm (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Spence, 1973). Companies may

increase the likelihood that customers grant them future business by
serving them with high-quality services, integrity, and honesty (e.g.,
Andreassen and Lindestad, 1998; Barich and Kotler, 1991; Walsh et al.,
2009).

Hypothesis 2. CBR has a positive impact on customer loyalty.

Fombrun (1996) also argues that a good corporate reputation
can translate into stakeholder goodwill toward the ﬁrm. In this context,
customer citizenship behaviors may represent an expression of a cus-
tomer's goodwill that results from a good ﬁrm reputation. This in-
vestigation considers two dimensions of CCBs: customers' willingness to
help other customers and to help the company (e.g., Bove et al., 2009;
Groth, 2005; Gruen, 1995). A customer who holds a ﬁrm in high esteem
may support this ﬁrm through discretionary engagement, or belief-
consistent behavior. In addition, CCBs may result from a customer's desire
to exhibit an afﬁliation with a highly reputed ﬁrm (Gruen, 1995).
Speciﬁcally, research into symbolic consumption behavior suggests that
customers use value-expressive criteria to enhance their self-concepts.
The ideal social self-concept is an image of the self that the person hopes
others will perceive (Sirgy, 1982). Firms with a good reputation possess
attributes that customers may want others to associate with their own
selves, so supporting a highly reputed ﬁrm through discretionary
behaviors that either the ﬁrm or other customers recognize may help
customers reach greater congruity with their ideal social selves. In turn, a
good reputation should prompt CCBs in the form of helping other
customers and helping the service ﬁrm.

Hypothesis 3. CBR has a positive impact on the helping other customers
dimension of customer citizenship behaviors.

Hypothesis 4. CBR has a positive impact on the helping the company
dimension of customer citizenship behaviors.

3.2. Mediated effects

By drawing on previous literature, the conceptual model (Fig. 1)
suggests mediations of the relationships between CBR and CCB by
customer commitment and loyalty. Morgan and Hunt (1994) consider
commitment a key mediating variable in successful business relations that
promotes efﬁciency, productivity, and effectiveness. Partners committed
to a business relationship increase their cooperative behaviors because of
their desire to make the relationship work and to achieve mutual goals.

Similarly, Raj (1982) shows that customer loyalty mediates the effect of
advertising signals on future purchase intentions. Prior studies also reveal
that loyal customers possess more experience with and knowledge of the
provider than do non-loyal customers. This knowledge may enable them
to contribute more effectively to the coproduction of the service (e.g.,
Lengnick-Hall, 1996) or provide social beneﬁts to other customers (e.g.,
Goodwin and Gremler, 1996).

The potential mediating effects of commitment and loyalty in the CBR–
CCB relationships reﬂect motivated reasoning theory (Kunda, 1990),
which suggests that two types of goals motivate behavior: accuracy and
directional. An accuracy goal is the desire to form or hold valid, accurate
attitudes, whereas directional goals stem from a defense motive. Both
commitment and intentional loyalty may result from purchase or ego
involvement (e.g., Beatty et al., 1988; Chiung-Ju and Wen-Hung, 2008;
Olsen, 2007; Schramm-Klein et al., 2008). High involvement relates to in-
depth information processing and the desire to increase conclusion
accuracy. However, according to Kunda (1990), systematic in-depth
processing does not eliminate biased conclusions. Highly involved per-
sons may have strongly anchored attitudes, which lead them to reject
alternative opinions (Greenwald and Leavitt, 1984; Sherif and Hovland,
1961). Thus, highly committed and intentionally loyal customers may
maintain both accuracy and directional goals related to preserving and
defending their beliefs about the ﬁrm's reputation. Customer commitment
and intentional loyalty are similar constructs, to the extent that both
associate with greater preference stability, the formation of defense
motives, and directional goals, all of which may bias cognitive evaluations
of reputation signals to support desired conclusions (e.g., Crosby and
Taylor, 1983; Kunda, 1999). Thus, both variables may mediate the effects
of CBR on CCBs.

Hypothesis 5. Customer commitment mediates the effect of CBR on
the (a) helping other customers dimension and (b) helping the
company dimension of customer citizenship behaviors.

Hypothesis 6a. Customer loyalty intentions mediate the effect of CBR
on the (a) helping other customers dimension and (b) helping the
company dimension of customer citizenship behaviors.

4. Method

4.1. Data collection and measures

Survey data gathered from a sample of 583 French service customers
help test the hypotheses. Respondents completed a paper-and-pencil
questionnaire about a current provider in one of three service categories
(banking, retailing, or fast-food restaurants). They used ﬁve-point Likert
scales (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). The ﬁve dimensions of
CBR, adapted from Walsh and Beatty (2007), each contain three-item
measures. The measures of the remaining constructs also include three
items. Items for commitment come from Hennig-Thurau et al. (2002),
those for customer loyalty are from Arnold and Reynolds (2003), and the
two dimensions of customer citizenship behavior come from Groth
(2005). All items appear in the Appendix.

4.2. Measurement evaluation

In the conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) run to evaluate the mea-
surement, CBR represents a reﬂective, second-order construct that con-
sists of ﬁve dimensions (Walsh and Beatty, 2007). The CFA indicates
excellent model ﬁt (χ2 (309)=2.27; root mean squared error of ap-
proximation [RMSEA]=.047; conﬁrmatory ﬁt index [CFI]=.95; Tucker–
Lewis index [TLI]=.94), and the composite reliability (Jöreskog's ρ) is
greater than .79 for all constructs (Table 1). All constructs also achieve
discriminant validity, because the variance extracted by the factors is
greater than the squared correlation between them (Fornell and Larcker,
1981).

4.3. Hypotheses testing

The test of the study's hypotheses entails a two-step analysis. First,
structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrapping in AMOS 7.0
serves to investigate the direct effects of CBR on commitment, loyalty, and
the two dimensions of CCB. As mediator variables, commitment and
loyalty must relate positively to both types of citizenship behaviors. This
basic condition of mediation (Baron and Kenny, 1986) i tested with SEM.
Second, the investigation of the speciﬁc mediated effects associated with
commitment and loyalty relies on Preacher and Hayes's (2008) approach.
The speciﬁc mediated effect of a variable represents the ability of that
variable to mediate the effect of an independent variable on a dependent
variable when the model includes further mediators. Results from the
previous CFA show that commitment and loyalty correlate strongly
(Table 1). Therefore, employing a series of mediation analysis (one for
each mediator) across the causal steps proposed by Baron and Kenny
(1986) is critical. Summing separately calculated, speciﬁc mediated effects
cannot reveal the accurate total mediated effect, because the separate
effects may be due to several (correlated) mediators (Bollen, 1987;
Cheung, 2007). Thus, this study uses Preacher and Hayes's (2008)
application of the Sobel test to investigate the speciﬁc mediated effects of
multiple mediators.

4.3.1. Direct effects

In the speciﬁcation of the structural model (Fig. 1), the residuals of
the two mediators may covary (Preacher and Hayes, 2008). The model
ﬁt indices fall within the commonly accepted ranges for very good ﬁt
(χ2 (310)=2.41; RMSEA=.049; CFI=.95; TLI=.94). Bootstrapping
with 2000 samples enables the computation of the unstandardized
estimates of the direct effects, 95% bias-corrected conﬁdence intervals,
and p-values (Jones et al., 2008). The direct relations between CBR and the
four dependent variables are all positive and signiﬁcantly different from 0
(Table 2), in support of Hypotheses 1–4. A good reputation improves
loyalty, as previous research shows (Walsh et al., 2009), as well as com-
mitment and both dimensions of citizenship behaviors. Regarding the
direct effects of the putative mediator variables on CCBs (not reported in
Table 1), strong and statistically signiﬁcant (p<.01) direct effects exist
from commitment (.35) and loyalty (.20) to helping the company. How-
ever, the effects on helping other customers are considerably weaker

(commitment .06; loyalty −.01) and statistically not distinguishable from
0 (p>.05). Because neither commitment nor loyalty relates statistically to
helping other customers, mediation does not receive support for this
outcome variable, and this study must reject Hypotheses 5a and 6a.

4.3.2. Indirect effects

Preacher and Hayes's (2008) propositions for investigating multiple
mediation are based on bootstrapping procedures with the observed
variables. This approach therefore cannot account for measurement
error, as SEM does. Their application instead can quantify speciﬁc
indirect effects associated with each mediator, which currently is
not possible in AMOS. This study therefore uses regression-based
factor scores as the data pertaining to CBR, commitment, loyalty, and
helping the company. Again, bootstrapping with 2000 samples
provides the effects, 95% bias-corrected conﬁdence intervals, and
p-values for the indirect and the contrast effects. The results show
that CBR explains a substantial proportion of variance (R2 = .37;
F(3, 579) = 114.03, p<.01). All direct and indirect effects are sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (p<.01), and their conﬁdence intervals are narrow
(Table 2). Both, commitment and loyalty intentions mediate the
relationship between CBR and customers' willingness to help the
company. The speciﬁc indirect effects of .11 for commitment and .15
for loyalty (p<.01; see Table 2) offer support for Hypotheses 5b and 6b.
Evidence of partial mediation derives from the direct effect of CBR on
helping the company, which is strong (.16) and statistically signiﬁcant
(p<.01) (not reported in Table 1).

5. Discussion and implications

Although corporate reputation attracts considerable attention in
marketing practice and research, marketers know little about its effects
on important downstream variables when the individual customer
represents the unit of analysis. To address this void, this study offers a
model of direct and multiple mediated effects that links CBR to customer
commitment, loyalty, and citizenship behaviors. All but two of the
Hypotheses 5a and 6a receive support from the data (Table 2). In the
following, the authors discuss some implications of these results for
marketing research and practice, and highlight the study's limitations.

5.1. Theoretical implications

Customer-based corporate reputation positively inﬂuences customer
commitment (Hypothesis 1), loyalty (Hypothesis 2), and citizenship
behaviors with regard to helping other customers (Hypothesis 3) and
helping the company (Hypothesis 4). The ﬁndings therefore support the
idea that a positive reputation represents a quality signal and promise,
which increases the likelihood that customers engage in favorable
behaviors toward the service ﬁrm. Establishing a strong relationship
between CBR and CCB represents an important extension of existing
reputation literature, which hitherto neglects most discretionary custom-
er behavior (Helm et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2009).

This study's ﬁndings also provide evidence that indirect relations
between reputation and discretionary customer behaviors are not
straightforward. As mediators, commitment and loyalty function differ-
ently, depending on the type of CCB. Mediated effects exist only for
customers' willingness to help the company, not for their willingness to
help other customers. This unexpected ﬁnding may reﬂect opportunistic
behaviors; that is, committed, loyal customers may prefer discretionary
behaviors that the service ﬁrm can observe, because they believe such
actions will lead to future beneﬁts for them. In contrast, helping other
customers prompts no reward from or palpable service improvements by
the ﬁrm for the customer. Relational variables thus may derive from a
customer's conviction that remaining in a relationship yields higher net
beneﬁts than does terminating it (e.g., Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002). A
growing body of literature differentiates the emotional, hedonic or
affective aspects from more rational, calculative commitment, and

researchers also underline differences between attitudinal and intentional
loyalty (e.g., Evanschitzky et al., 2006). The affective, emotional, or
hedonic and rational or calculative aspects of commitment and loyalty
may differentially mediate the relationships between reputation and CCB.
Further research should explore conditions in which a good reputation
leads to altruistic behaviors in the form of helping other customers. A
strong and signiﬁcant direct effect also exists from CBR to helping other
customers, as hypothesized. This ﬁnding is in line with the rationale
derived from self-concept theories. According to these theories, customers
may use the reputational characteristics of the ﬁrm to enhance their self-
concepts, in which case customers of a highly reputed ﬁrm may help other
customers because doing so enables them to represent good causes. This
ﬁnding has great practical relevance.

Although this study highlights the importance of corporate reputation
in relation to key marketing outcomes, further work could extend the
ﬁndings. The clarion call for increased marketing accountability (Ambler,
2000) demands that corporate reputation managers demonstrate how
investments in reputation affect the bottom line. Additional studies could
explore the relationship between CBR and monetary outcomes as an
important extension of reputation literature, which hitherto focuses
mostly on non-monetary outcomes. Another enlightening research path
might determine category effects in reputation–outcome relationships.
For example, researchers could consider factors such as the degree of
customer participation in service delivery or the risk related to a service
type as potential moderators of the CBR–outcome relationships.

Although not stated as a primary goal, this study demonstrates that the
CBR scale has sound psychometric properties and is applicable in France,
whereas previously, studies apply the CBR scale only in the United States
and Germany (Walsh and Beatty, 2007; Walsh et al., 2009), Further
studies in other countries could determine if service ﬁrms and consumers'
perceptions differ. Finally, studies using the CBR scale could opt against an
ad hoc replication and instead attempt to identify additional, perhaps
culture-speciﬁc, CBR dimensions. Using exploratory interviews, research-
ers could develop a CBR scale that encompasses the original ﬁve CBR
dimensions, as well as new, potentially country-speciﬁc dimensions. For
example, in the United States and many countries in the European Union,
more and more organizations use diversity management to retain
valuable human resources, increase productivity, and generate a culture
of growth (Harris et al., 2003). A new dimension in some countries
therefore may refer to customers' expectations of diversity in a service
ﬁrm's workforce, pertaining to gender, age, or ethnic group, as well as the
company's adherence to diversity management principles.

5.2. Managerial implications

Perhaps the most important managerial implication that arises from
this study's ﬁndings is the return on reputation. The ﬁndings show that a
good reputation prompts CCB and positively affects customer commit-
ment and loyalty. For practitioners, the CBR–CCB link is particularly
intriguing. Customer integration appears to provide the most effective
way to increase service productivity (Gouthier and Schmid, 2003;
Lovelock and Young, 1979), such that service ﬁrms that invest in
improving their reputation may reap beneﬁts that positively affect their
bottom line. Yet the results of this study show unexpectedly that only
CBR has a direct positive effect on helping other customers. Commitment
and loyalty building programs may improve customer collaboration in
terms of helping the ﬁrm but be less effective in increasing customers'
willingness to help other customers. These results clearly suggest that
managers who want to increase helpful customer-to-customer interac-
tions should promote reputation-building programs.

The strong relationships between CBR and customer commitment and
loyalty appear equally relevant. As services marketing literature notes,
fostering customer commitment to the service ﬁrm is crucial for the
positive effects on important marketing outcomes (e.g., Hennig-Thurau
et al., 2002). The ﬁndings herein highlight the role of CBR in fostering
commitment; service ﬁrms thus should monitor and, when necessary,


B. Bartikowski, G. Walsh / Journal of Business Research 64 (2011) 39–44

43

improve their corporate reputation. Managers can use the CBR scale to
gather benchmark data about the levels of customers' perceived corporate
reputation and conduct periodic checks to measure changes or improve-
ments in the outcomes. Such reputation monitoring could rely on an
online panel, which would enable the ﬁrm to engage with and learn from
customers over time.

5.3. Conclusion and limitations

Several limitations exist in this study. First, the conceptual model
derives from extant literature but not qualitative ﬁeldwork. An approach
involving interviews with service customers and managers might provide
additional insights that current literature does not reveal (Song et al.,
2008). Second, this research focuses only on the affective and intentional
aspects of commitment and loyalty as mediator variables in reputation–
outcome relationships. Third, customer citizenship behavior appears as a
two-dimensional construct in this study, though other research proposes
a greater variety of citizenship behaviors (e.g., Bove et al., 2009; Groth,
2005). Expressions of such behaviors, such as the propensity to engage in
word-of-mouth recommendations (Groth, 2005) or arriving on time for
appointments (Bove et al., 2009), may lead to different results.
Researchers therefore should continue to consider these important issues.
