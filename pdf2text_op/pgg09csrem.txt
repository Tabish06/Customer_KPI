ABSTRACT
Social disclosure, according to Ullmann’s conceptual framework (1985), could be explained 
by stakeholder power, strategic posture and economic performance, where the power of 
stakeholders  is  a  function  of  the  resources  they  control  that  are  essential  to  the 
company.

The aim of this work is to test the effect that shareholder power and dispersed ownership 
structure have on the decision to disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR) information 
in the Spanish context, controlling for the rest of the dimensions.

Our  results  allow  us  to  afﬁ rm  that  this  paper  tests  a  stakeholder  theory  approach  to 
analyzing  corporate  social  disclosures  and  is  consistent  with  the  framework  proposed, 
although the power of shareholders is quite limited. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons,

Introduction

actions, including the distribution of economic, social or political beneﬁ ts to the groups from which they 
derive their power (Shocker and Sethi, 1973).

COMPANIES,  IN  ORDER  TO  SURVIVE  AND  GROW,  NEED  TO  PERFORM  WELL  AND  UNDERTAKE  SOCIALLY  DESIRABLE 

In this sense, there is a growing recognition within the business sphere of the importance key stake-
holders attach to socially, environmentally and ethically responsible behaviour by corporations (Zadek et al., 1997). 
As  businesses  recognize  their  stakeholders’  social  expectations,  the  role  of  corporate  social  reporting  takes  on 
increasing  importance  as  a  mechanism  through  which  such  duties  of  accountability  may  be  discharged  (Gray 
et al., 1996).

Taking  stakeholder  theory  as  a  basis,  Ullmann  (1985)  proposed  a  three-dimensional  model  that  can  explain 
companies’ social disclosure: stakeholder power, strategic posture and economic performance. In this model, the 
power of stakeholders is a function of the resources they control that are essential to the companies.

Roberts (1992) demonstrated the validity of Ullmann’s conceptual framework empirically, except for the power 
of  the  main  stakeholders:  the  shareholders.  This  lack  of  signiﬁ cant  results  for  this  type  of  stakeholder  is  a

Stakeholder Engagement and CSR Reporting

consequence of considering only one group of shareholders representing concentrated ownership, delimited by 
the hypothesis that the interests of majority shareholders are incompatible with socially responsible practices and 
their disclosure.

In general, a business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the proﬁ t of the stockholders and 
this is not to deny that there may be situations where the interests of shareholders and nonshareholders diverge 
in  a  manner  that  makes  it  more  difﬁ cult  to  rationalize  an  act  undertaken  for  the  beneﬁ t  of  a  nonshareholder 
constituency that is not, ultimately, in the interests of the shareholders (Lee, 2005, pp. 34–35).

Moreover,  western  continental  European  countries  are  characterized  by  the  presence  of  an  ultimate  majority 
shareholder (La Porta et al., 1999; Faccio and Lang, 2002) who often uses multiple classes of shares, pyramids 
and cross-holdings to exercise control while owning only a small fraction of the company’s cash ﬂ ow. Within this 
structure,  potentially  large  agency  costs  between  majority  and  minority  shareholders  are  argued  to  be  involved 
(Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Bebchuk et al., 2000) due to the simultaneous presence of nonaligned interests (Jensen 
and Meckling, 1976) and entrenchment (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Morck et al., 1988).

But by adopting a set of socially responsible practices, companies generate beneﬁ ts that are directed away from 
stockholders  at  the  same  time  that  the  ﬁ rm  is  arguably  positioned  to  take  advantage  of  previously  unforeseen 
business opportunities (Haigh and Jones, 2006, p. 246).

In this sense, Anderson et al. (2003) argue that majority shareholders have an important interest in the long-
term survival of the ﬁ rm and in the importance of maintaining their own reputation, which is strongly linked to 
that of the ﬁ rm. This suggests that the dominant shareholders, in comparison with other types of owners, will be 
more likely to adopt decisions that maximise the ﬁ rm’s economic, social and environmental behaviour. Further-
more, the need to conserve their reputation will entail appropriate communication of corporate behaviour to the 
market.

On the other hand, Solomon (2006) showed that institutional investors and their active engagement represent 
an  important  corporate  governance  mechanism,  which  is  being  used  to  inﬂ uence  corporate  governance  in  the 
social, ethics and environmental area.

The objective of this work is to test the effect that shareholder power and dispersed ownership structure have 
on the decision to disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR) information, controlling for the rest of the dimen-
sions proposed by Ullmann. It must be taken into account that shareholders, ﬁ nancial institutions and dominant 
shareholders  are  the  most  important  stockholders  in  the  European  and  Spanish  context  (La  Porta  et  al.,  1999; 
Claessens and Tzioumis, 2006) and, according to previous research, have different interests in CSR and in the 
disclosure of information about it.

Moreover, methodologically a redeﬁ nition is made of the contents of the information disclosed. Speciﬁ cally, in 
this  study  we  opt  for  classifying  the  reports  on  CSR  taking  into  account:  ﬁ rst,  whether  or  not  the  information 
disclosed includes the economic, social and environmental aspects; next, whether the information is suited to the 
format and contents of the most widespread international model, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); and ﬁ nally, 
whether the adoption of the GRI model has been certiﬁ ed and the information veriﬁ ed or audited.

This  paper  tests  a  stakeholder  theory  approach  to  analyzing  corporate  social  disclosures  and  our  results  are 
consistent  with  the  framework  proposed  by  Ullmann  (1985),  although  the  power  of  shareholders  is  quite 
limited.

Stakeholder Theory and Social Disclosures

Stakeholder theory offered a new form of managerial understanding and action (Jonker and Foster, 2002), a new 
way to organize thinking about ﬁ rms’ responsibilities by suggesting that the needs of shareholders cannot be met 
without satisfying the needs of other stakeholders (Foster and Jonker, 2005; Hawkins, 2006; Jamali, 2008). The 
maximisation  of  proﬁ ts  and  the  creation  of  value  for  the  shareholders  can  no  longer  be  the  sole  objectives  of 
management; rather, they must be obtained through or in coexistence with a grid of values of other stakeholders 
(Longo et al., 2005), among which are the demands and needs related to social and environmentally sustainable 
behaviour.

J.-M. Prado-Lorenzo et al.

Freeman (1984, p. 46) deﬁ nes a stakeholder as ‘a person or group that can affect or is affected by the achieve-
ment  of  the  organization’s  objectives’.  In  accordance  with  this  paradigm,  stakeholders  include  customers,  sup-
pliers, employees, communities, and the general public, besides managers, stockholders and creditors.

CSR reporting, or social disclosure, is a strategic plan by corporations to show a ﬁ rm’s social performance to 
the  stakeholders  (Roberts,  1992);  in  other  words,  we  can  understand  CSR  reporting  as  a  part  of  the  dialogue 
between the company and its stakeholders (Gray et al., 1995, p. 53). Hence, stakeholder theory provides a useful 
framework to evaluate CSR through social reporting activities (Snider et al., 2003).

Initially,  this  reporting  provided  almost  anecdotal  information  (Hogner,  1982;  Guthrie  and  Parker,  1989) 
strongly linked to the political structure of society, as well as to environmental or social crises that had occurred 
(Hopwood, 1987; Loft, 1988). Subsequently, especially in the last two decades, the practices for disclosing envi-
ronmental and social information have increased in amount and complexity (Gray et al., 2001).

Among others, Guthrie and Parker (1990) showed that UK ﬁ rms publish a larger volume of information than 
US  ﬁ rms,  and  the  latter  publish  more  than  Australian  ﬁ rms.  Gray  et  al.  (1995)  conﬁ rmed  the  increase  in  the 
volume of information issued between 1979 and 1991 by UK ﬁ rms. Similar results were obtained for Australian 
ﬁ rms in the paper by Deegan and Gordon (1996).

Analyses similar to those described above have been carried out in different countries, such as New Zealand 
(Hackston and Milne, 1996), Spain (Moneva and Llena, 2000; Archel, 2003; Gallego, 2006), Greece (Bichta, 2003), 
Italy (Secchi, 2006), Canada (Nitkin and Brooks, 1998) and Western Europe (Adams et al., 1998).

One area of consistent interest through the years has been the attempt to explain the social and environmental 
disclosures with reference to an observable set of factors (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Adams et al., 1998; Gray 
et  al.,  2001;  Hossain  and  Reaz,  2007;  García-Sánchez,  2008).  But,  in  general,  the  existing  literature  on  social 
disclosure or CSR reporting can be classiﬁ ed into three groups. In the ﬁ rst group, the authors examine the rele-
vance of this information to investors. The second group explores the relation between social disclosures and social 
performance. Finally, the third group of studies analyzes the factors affecting ﬁ rms’ decisions to disclose corporate 
social information. We discuss the last group since it is the most relevant to our study.

As regards the analysis of the factors that affect the decision to prepare and disclose CSR, Adams (2002) afﬁ rms 
that they attempt to test aspects of the legitimisation theory, and can be classiﬁ ed as (i) ﬁ rm characteristics, (ii) 
general contextual factors and (iii) internal context.

With respect to the use of stakeholder theory as a conceptual framework for analysis, mention should be made, 
among others, of the studies by Roberts (1992) and Van de Laan Smith et al. (2005) for the individual analysis of 
ﬁ rms at a national and international level, respectively.

These studies are generally founded on the theoretical bases proposed by Ullmann (1985) who put forward a 
conceptual framework for the factors affecting social disclosure. His model has three dimensions that can explain 
corporate social reporting:

1.  Stakeholder  power  reﬂ ects  the  theoretical  basis  of  the  cited  framework,  since,  when  stakeholders  control 
resources critical to the organization the ﬁ rm is likely to respond in a way that satisﬁ es the demands of the 
stakeholders.

2.  Strategic posture describes the mode of response of an organization’s key decision-makers toward demands. 
An active posture implies a position in which managers seek to inﬂ uence their organization’s relationship with 
important stakeholders in order to achieve optimal levels of interdependence.

3.  Economic performance is important in two ways: (i) it determines the relative weight of social demand and the 
attention it receives; for instance, in periods of high proﬁ tability, social demand receives more attention; and 
(ii) it inﬂ uences the ﬁ nancial capability to undertake costly programmes related to social demands.

Roberts (1992) showed the validity of Ullmann’s conceptual framework empirically, except for the main stake-
holders: the stockholders. This lack of signiﬁ cant results for this type of stakeholder is a consequence of a single 
group of shareholders representing concentrated ownership.

This study, therefore, focuses on analyzing the effect of shareholder power on the disclosure of corporate social 

information, while controlling for the rest of the dimensions proposed by Ullmann (1985).

Stockholder Power: Research Hypothesis

The power of stakeholders is a function of the resources they control that are essential to the corporation (Ullmann, 
1985). Resource dependency theory suggests that power accrues to those parties that control resources required 
by the organization, thus creating power differentials among stakeholders (Pfeffer, 1981).

At  the  most  fundamental  level,  ownership  stakes  controlled  by  different  stakeholder  groups  accrue  power  to 
these groups vis-à-vis the ﬁ rm and heighten the urgency that the demands of these groups be met (Van der Laan 
Smith et al., 2005).

La Porta et al. (1999), in the international sphere, and Classens and Tzioumis (2006), in the European sphere, 
demonstrate  that  in  many  countries,  among  them  Spain,  the  ownership  structure  is  characterized  by  a  strong 
presence of ﬁ nancial institutions and a physical person as dominant shareholder.

Financial Institutions

Financial investors, according to Holderness and Sheehan (1988), Pound (1992) and Solomon et al. (2004), have 
strong interest not only in the ﬁ nancial performance of the ﬁ rms in which they invest, but also in the social and 
environmental strategies and activities of those companies. This kind of shareholder is unable to move quickly in 
and out of funds without affecting share price (Qu, 2007).

Within the group of ﬁ nancial investors, Thompsona and Cowton (2004, p. 199) argue that banks, as facilitators 
of industrial activity, by lending or investment, are under an obligation to demand sustainable behaviour from the 
ﬁ rms they ﬁ nance or control through investment in their capital.

When ﬁ nancial institutions invest in the ﬁ rm, they have voting rights to monitor the ﬁ rm’s policy, and, thus, 
they generally demand that the ﬁ rm should not cause environmental or social damage and should inform on its 
social behaviour.

Taking into account these considerations, the following alternative hypothesis is posed:

H1:  Ceteris  paribus,  the  contents  and  quality  of  the  CSR  report  are  positively  affected  by  the  presence  of  ﬁ nancial 
institutions in the ﬁ rm’s ownership structure.

Dominant Shareholder

The  existence  of  ownership  structures  characterized  by  the  presence  of  dominant  shareholders  that  control 
corporate  behaviour  affects  the  organizational  objectives  and  how  control  is  exercised  in  the  ﬁ rm  (Thomsen 
and Pedersen, 2000). It must be borne in mind that a high percentage of shares held by the main shareholder 
enables  the  latter  to  carry  out  important  transactions  without  any  other  shareholder  being  able  to  intervene 
(Bianco and Casanova, 1999; Destefanis and Sena, 2007).

These  shareholders  imply  a  context  of  concentrated  ownership,  which,  according  to  Fan  and  Wong  (2002), 
entails the existence of two lines that link with disclosure practices in general. The ﬁ rst line, entrenchment, means 
that  the  information  disclosed  will  mainly  reﬂ ect  the  interests  of  the  dominant  stockholder  as  opposed  to  the 
reﬂ ection of the ﬁ rm’s economic situation. However, it seems to be conﬁ rmed that, from a certain level of owner-
ship  concentration,  an  alignment  effect  arises  between  the  interests  of  the  main  shareholder  and  the  minority 
shareholders.  The  second  line,  information  effect,  is  based  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  interest  in  limiting  the  transfer  of  the 
company’s speciﬁ c information to its competitors.

Moreover,  Anderson  et  al.  (2003)  argue  that  this  type  of  shareholder  is  different  from  the  rest  of  the  stock-
holders in two aspects: (i) interest in the long-term survival of the ﬁ rm, and (ii) the importance of maintaining 
their own reputation, which is strongly linked to that of the ﬁ rm. This suggests that the dominant shareholders, 
in comparison with other types of owners, will be more likely to adopt decisions that maximise the ﬁ rm’s economic, 
social  and  environmental  behaviour.  Furthermore,  the  need  to  preserve  their  reputation  will  entail  appropriate 
communication of corporate behaviour to the market.

J.-M. Prado-Lorenzo et al.

Derived from the above arguments, the following hypothesis is posed, without determining a priori the inﬂ uence 

of this type of stockholder:

H2: Ceteris paribus, the contents and quality of the CSR report are affected by the presence of a physical person that 
exercises control over the ﬁ rm.

Dispersed Ownership

Another aspect of stockholder power which may inﬂ uence the level of disclosure is the level of ownership disper-
sion (Keim, 1978, Ullmann, 1985). Prior studies (Craswell and Taylor, 1992; Christopher and Hassan, 1996; Frost, 
1999)  suggest  that  the  less  the  inﬂ uence  of  the  top  shareholders,  equivalent  to  more  dispersed  ownership,  the 
greater the likelihood that ﬁ rms will disclose more information.

These shareholders do not have enough power to inﬂ uence the ﬁ rm’s decision and their motivations stem from 
personal preferences. But, in this respect, independent directors play a special role in ensuring observance of the 
law and defending minority shareholders’ interests (Fama and Jensen, 1983).

Independent directors, according to Zahra and Stanton (1988), are especially interested in showing compliance 
with  regulations  and  the  socially  responsible  behaviour  of  the  company  owing  to  the  fact  that  their  image  and 
reputation are strongly joined to the ethical and responsible behaviour of the ﬁ rm whose board of directors they 
form part of.

The following hypothesis can thus be posed:

H3: Ceteris paribus, the contents and the quality of the CSR report are positively affected by the presence of a greater 
number of independent directors representing the interests of dispersed ownership.

Methodology

Sample

The target population in the study corresponds to the 116 nonﬁ nancial Spanish ﬁ rms quoted on the Spanish con-
tinuous market. It should be pointed out that the population was selected taking into consideration the criteria of 
size  and  stock  market  listing  used  in  previous  studies  (Guthrie  and  Parker,  1990;  Hackston  and  Milne,  1996; 
Collett and Hrasky, 2005), as well as the fact that they are obliged to deposit information on corporate governance 
before the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (National Stock Market Commission). Consultation of their 
database provided us with reports from 99 ﬁ rms, the sample used in the analysis.

Subsequently,  CSR  reports  were  obtained  from  the  web  pages  of  the  ﬁ rms  previously  identiﬁ ed.  As  will  be 
pointed  out  below,  these  documents  were  analyzed  by  ﬁ tting  their  contents  to  the  lines  included  in  the  most 
widespread international model, the GRI, which is a framework for corporate reporting on the social and environ-
mental performance of businesses (Dentchev, 2004).

The annual report on CSR was chosen as the document to be analyzed in order to ﬁ nd the ﬁ rms’ disclosure 
practices, since, as a source of information for the interested public, it is the most important individual document 
(Adams et al., 1998), and is also of public knowledge (Abbott and Monsen, 1979; Gray et al., 1987; Zéghal and 
Ahmed, 1990) and the one most used internationally.

Variables

Dependent Variable: Practices in Corporate Social Reporting (PCSR)
In  almost  all  previous  studies,  the  dependent  variable  is  usually  constructed  using  the  technique  of  content 
analysis of the CSR reports. This method consists of coding the text of this document in categories. Generally, 
diverse items are previously deﬁ ned relating to the general lines established in the preceding bibliography.

Stakeholder Engagement and CSR Reporting 

99

The disclosure of information on each item is usually expressed numerically, measured by means of different 
units of analysis, such as number of pages, number of sentences (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Milne and Adler, 
1999), number of words (Neu et al., 1998), etc.

Furthermore, indexes have also been created assigning the score ‘1’ to ﬁ rms that report on the item, and ‘0’ 
otherwise.  At  times  this  measurement  can  be  improved  by  scoring  from  ‘1’  to  ‘3’,  if  the  characteristics  of  the 
information are taken into account, that is, whether it is qualitative, quantitative or monetary.

Although this process of synthesis of the ﬁ rms’ endeavours in disclosure is characterized by high objectivity in 
the metrics, it should be pointed out that the assessment of the items depends on the subjectivity of the person 
who prepared the information. In other words, if those in charge in the ﬁ rms decide not to disclose unfavourable 
information concerning the ﬁ rms’ behaviour, or use the optimum1 but not the most appropriate expression, this 
would not be penalized.

In order to overcome the limitations mentioned, in this study we opted for classifying CSR reports by taking 
into consideration: (i) whether the ﬁ rm makes any disclosure on economic, social and environmental aspects; (ii) 
whether the information is given out in an informal format or the contents are adapted to a standard of the most 
widespread international model, the GRI; and (iii) whether compliance with the demands of the GRI on the part 
of the organization responsible has been certiﬁ ed.

Together with the contents and characteristics of the information, their veracity is observed, that is, whether the 
information has been veriﬁ ed or audited by an independent entity which guarantees its accuracy and credibility.
The choice of the GRI standard is based on the obligation that this model imposes of reporting on all the ﬁ rm’s 
aspects  –  economic,  social  and  environmental  –  regardless  of  whether  this  involves  reﬂ ecting  negative  data  or 
situations that are not optimal for the ﬁ rm. Moreover, there is an obligation for certain information to be expressed 
numerically and monetarily so as to facilitate its comparison.

It was also chosen because it is a harmonized, standardized, understandable and objective report for all ﬁ rms, 
regardless of their country of origin. Hence, Adams (2002) reveals the ﬁ rms’ great interest in the standardization 
of the corporate social report issued by the ﬁ rms according to GRI format. Empirically, a recent report drawn up 
by KPMG International’s Global Sustainability Services, together with the University of Amsterdam (2005), shows 
that this model of corporate social information is widespread throughout the world.

Finally, studies such as that of Clarkson et al. (forthcoming) recognize the objectivity of the fulﬁ lment index of 

the GRI model in the analysis of corporate social disclosure practices.

Consideration of the veriﬁ cation or auditing of the document is a consequence of the great importance given to 

the process by the ﬁ rm managers, as seen in Adams’s work.

Speciﬁ cally, we use ﬁ ve dummy dependent variables that take the value of ‘1’ in order to identify the content 
and quality of CSR reporting, and ‘0’ otherwise. Information disclsures identiﬁ es these companies that make any 
disclosure on social or environmental aspects. Informal preparation shows that ﬁ rms report on CSR by giving out 
information in their own informal format. Preparation GRI comprises those ﬁ rms whose CSR contents are adapted 
to the GRI recommendations. GRI Certiﬁ cation identiﬁ es whether the GRI has certiﬁ ed the annual report or the 
ﬁ rm’s CSR reporting has been veriﬁ ed or audited by an independent entity.

Although we use the ﬁ ve original variables, or a summative variable such as the dependent variable, with a view 
to objectively summarizing all the categories of analysis or classiﬁ cation of CSR reporting, a principal components 
analysis was estimated to make it possible to simplify the dependent variables previously considered into compo-
nents that reﬂ ect the underlying common dimensions. These components describe the initial data with a much 
smaller number of concepts than the original individual variables.

The selection of the factors obtained by the principal components’ analysis allows us to consider jointly all the 
common intra-variables aspects that the analysis of each variable independently does not permit. And, moreover, 
the weight given to each variable when deﬁ ning the factor is statistically objective, as opposed to the subjectivity 
of assigning numerical values, identical or ordinal, to each of the ﬁ ve variables to obtain a summative variable.

Prior  to  estimation  of  the  principal  components  analysis,  the  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  measurement  of  sampling 
adequacy and Bartlett’s sphericity test were run. The results obtained show an adequate basis for the empirical 

1 In this respect, Adams (2002) conﬁ rms that some business mangers doubt whether it would be advisable to publish in their reports negative 
data that could harm the ﬁ rm’s reputation.

Subsequently,  principal  components  analysis  (VARIMAX  rotation)  was  run,  and  the  results  are  given  in 

Table 2.

By  analyzing  the  loadings,  it  can  be  seen  that  Component  1,  Validation,  represents  CSR  reporting  where  the 
information has been veriﬁ ed by an independent entity and the contents and format certiﬁ ed as In Accordance by 
the GRI.

Component  2,  Information  disclosed,  identiﬁ es  those  ﬁ rms  that  give  out  information  on  economic  and  social, 
and/or  environmental  matters,  in  an  informal  format,  that  is,  they  do  not  follow  an  internationally  recognised 
standard model.

Finally, the last component,  GRI  format, includes CSR reporting in which the contents and format meet the 
requirements and demands of the GRI but have not been certiﬁ ed. The disclosing of information in accordance 
with this model would entail an increase in the contents, quality and objectivity of the information.

Roberts (1992) empirically tested the positive effect that political power or the power of the ﬁ nancial institutions,

Economic Performance

consequence the executives of that company will attempt to choose the disclosure policies which most contribute 
to eliminating political interference and to producing a decrease in costs such as taxes, fees and regulated charges, 
among others.

Generally,  size,  under  the  hypothesis  that  larger  ﬁ rms  are  more  visible  politically,  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  the 
impact of political exposure. Speciﬁ cally, studies such as those by Trotman and Bradley (1981), Belkaoui and Karpik 
(1989),  Patten  (1991),  Deegan  and  Gordon  (1996),  Hackston  and  Milne  (1996),  Gray  et  al.  (2001),  Archel  and 
Lizarraga  (2001),  Archel  (2003)  and  Ochoa  and  Aranguren  (2005)  have  detected  a  positive  direct  relationship 
between the contents of the CSR report and the size of the ﬁ rm. For this reason we include size in our analysis.
But  this  variable  is  also  correlated  with  other  corporate  characteristics  and  could  represent  other  effects.  To 
reduce this problem, we use the industry where the ﬁ rm operates. It is conceivable that companies belonging to 
highly sensitive industries will face more stringent government regulations. As such, these companies are pre-
dicted to disclose more social and environmental information in order to minimize government sanctions (Cowen 
et al., 1987; Freedman and Jaggi, 1988; Adams et al., 1995, 1998; Hackston and Milne, 1996; Deegan and Gordon, 
1996). Thus, following the sector classiﬁ cation established by the Spanish Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, 
we considered the following industries: transport, industrial, energy and vonstruction.

According to Roberts (1992), creditors control access to ﬁ nancial resources that may be necessary for the con-
tinued operation of a corporation. So the greater the degree to which a corporation relies on debt ﬁ nancing to fund 
capital projects, the greater the degree to which corporate management would be expected to respond to creditor 
expectations concerning a corporation’s role in socially responsible activities. To test the hypothesis we used the 
traditional debt-to-equity ratio, a variable that captures the importance of creditors as stakeholders relative to equity 
investors.

Strategic Posture
Strategic posture refers to how a company may respond to social demands. An active strategic posture towards 
social demands is expected to result in greater social responsibility activities, outstanding among which are the 
drawing up and disclosure of CSR reports (Ullmann, 1985).

To represent this dimension we have selected the presence/absence of ISO14001: Environmental Management 
Systems and OHSAS18001: Occupational Health and Safety Assessment certiﬁ cation. These certiﬁ cations involve 
a rigorous process in order for the ﬁ rm to be seen as environmentally and socially compliant, respectively, and are 
thus signiﬁ cant in the strategic posture of the ﬁ rms.

Economic Performance
Cowen et al. (1987), Belkaoui and Karpik (1989) and Hackston and Milne (1996), among others, have empirically 
tested the relationship between corporate social disclosure and economic performance. Owing to the substantial 
costs  involved  in  becoming  socially  responsible,  economic  performance  is  an  important  factor  in  determining 
whether social responsibility issues will be on the priority list.

In this study, an accounting-based measure, Return on Assets, is used to test the impact of economic performance 

on the company’s social disclosures.

Analysis Model

Testing hypotheses H1 to H3 entails analyzing the effect of the power of the different stockholders in the Spanish 
ownership structure on the characteristics and contents of the CSR report, which have been synthesized in three 
components through factor analysis. Dependence models or multiple linear regression models are used for this 
purpose.

In  order  to  control  the  effect  of  collinearity  among  the  independent  variables,  four  explanatory  models  were 
estimated for each component (twelve models). The ﬁ rst only includes the control variables as independent vari-
ables, whereas the other models incorporate to the initial model, in an individualized way, variables representing 
the presence of ﬁ nancial institutions in the ﬁ rm’s capital, the existence of a dominant shareholder, and the per-
centage of independent board members representing the power of the minority shareholders.

Results of the Analysis

Table 4 gives the results for the models estimated. The overall ﬁ t of the different models (R2) are relatively high, 
although the small increase produced in them when considering the variables representing ownership structure 
should be pointed out. Speciﬁ cally, the explanatory power of the control variables accounts for between 21.9% and 
40.9% of the veracity and extent of the CSR reports issued by the ﬁ rms.

When ownership structure is also considered, the explanatory power undergoes a slight increase, to be precise, 

from 22% to 41.2%. These increases are not signiﬁ cant, except in Model 3 for Component 3.

On  analyzing  the  variables  individually,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  three  independent  variables  proposed,  which 
represent the presence of ﬁ nancial institutions, dominant shareholder and minority shareholders in ownership 
structure, do not affect any of the characteristics determined for the ﬁ rms’ social disclosure practices. We must, 
however,  mention  the  positive  effect  of  the  presence  of  the  dominant  shareholder  on  the  adoption  of  the  GRI 
format as a standard used for giving out social information. These results lead us to reject hypotheses H1 and H3 
and to partially accept H2.

Regarding the control variables, the variable size is statistically signiﬁ cant in all the models estimated for Com-
ponents 2 – disclosure of information – and 3 – GRI format – although with a different sign and signiﬁ cance level. 
To  be  exact,  it  has  a  negative  effect  at  a  95%  conﬁ dence  level  for  Component  2  and  a  positive  effect  at  a  90% 
conﬁ dence level for Component 3.

The  variables  representing  the  sectors  of  activity  are  not  signiﬁ cant,  except  for  the  dummy  referring  to  the 
transport sector, which has a positive effect at a 95% conﬁ dence level in all the models estimated for Component 
1 – validation of the information.

J.-M. Prado-Lorenzo et al.

The debt variable has a negative effect on all the models for Components 1 – validation of the information – and 
2 – disclosure of information, although it is only signiﬁ cant for the ﬁ rst component. On the contrary, for Compo-
nent 3 – GRI format – a signiﬁ cant positive effect is seen.

The ROA variable, the numerical expression of economic performance, is not statistically signiﬁ cant, although 

it shows a positive effect in all the models proposed.

The variable relating to the presence/absence of ISO14001 certiﬁ cation has a positive effect at a conﬁ dence level 

between 95% and 99% for Components 2 – disclosure of information – and 3 – GRI format.

The OHSAS18001 variable has a positive effect at a 99% conﬁ dence level in all the models relating to Compo-

nent 1 – validation.

With respect to the interpretation of the results indicated, it can be afﬁ rmed that the effect of the stockholders’ 
power is very limited in relation to corporate social reporting practices, although a certain inﬂ uence is seen in the 
improvement of the disclosure of such information relating to its standardization, an aspect that affects the com-
parability of the data offered.

Regarding this standardization of the information through the adoption of the GRI standard, the inﬂ uence of 

other stakeholders, such as the Government and creditors, can be seen.

In relation to the validation (auditing and certiﬁ cation) of the social information disclosed, the political pressure 
exerted on the transport sector was conﬁ rmed. This relation may be due to the fact that it is one of the sectors 
most harmful to the environment, and therefore greater importance is attached to the veracity of the information 
disclosed with respect to the adoption of policies and laws that are less permissive regarding the ﬁ rms carrying 
out these activities.

The aspect pointed out above is strengthened by the negative assessment the Government makes with respect 

to the informal disclosure of information, without common contents and structures among the ﬁ rms.

Moreover, validation of the information disclosed is not viewed positively by the ﬁ nancial institutions when they 
act as lenders, perhaps because it is information that is complementary to the information that these entities actu-
ally use for the granting of loans (ﬁ nancial information) and hence they do not require processes that guarantee 
its authenticity.

Finally, mention must be made of the strength that the strategy adopted by the ﬁ rm in environmental and social 

matters has in the disclosure of a greater amount of information, as well as in its veracity and improvement.

Conclusions

Business,  in  general,  recognizes  the  importance  that  key  stakeholders  attach  to  socially,  environmentally  and 
ethically responsible behaviour on the part of corporations. In this line, CSR reporting is used as a mechanism 
through which companies provide information to stakeholders about environmental, community, employee, and 
consumer issues.

The disclosure of this information has traditionally been measured through indicators of the volume of informa-
tion  published.  This  study,  following  the  conceptual  framework  proposed  by  Ullmann  (1985),  considers  CSR 
reporting from a different perspective. It analyzes the level of contents, their quality and their objectivity through 
compliance with the rules for preparation of the GRI model. It also takes into account whether the fulﬁ lment of 
these rules has been certiﬁ ed by the GRI organization, and whether the data reﬂ ected have been veriﬁ ed or audited 
by entities independent of the ﬁ rm.

The  results  obtained  conﬁ rm  that  the  inﬂ uence  exerted  by  certain  stakeholders  (government  and  creditors), 
together with the strategic posture of the ﬁ rm, have an important effect on the publication of a CSR report. On 
the  contrary,  as  other  authors  have  already  demonstrated,  economic  performance  has  a  null  effect  on  this 
process.

Regarding the inﬂ uence of the stakeholders, particularly government power, when the disclosure of homoge-
neous and objective information is taken into account, it can be seen, the same as in other studies, that the larger, 
and therefore more politically visible ﬁ rms, are the ones that disclose more information with a view to reducing 
political costs. These are ﬁ rms that also usually carry out an economic activity linked to sensitive sectors of envi-
ronmental activity, which leads to greater government interest.

Stakeholder Engagement and CSR Reporting 

105

In this sense, the results conﬁ rm that the Government is one of the most important agents for change and has 
an impact on social responsibility disclosure practices. This ﬁ nding has signiﬁ cant implications for the Govern-
ment in the sense that it should strengthen regulations in relation to business aspects such as transparency in 
social and environmental behaviour by deﬁ ning the contents and veracity of CSR reporting, especially since the 
empirical analysis showed that creditors positively inﬂ uence the contents of this type of information but are not 
interested in the veracity of these documents.

From the point of view of the shareholders, especially in an ownership structure deﬁ ned by the presence of a 
main  shareholder  that  exerts  control  over  the  ﬁ rm,  there  is  encouragement  to  adopt  the  GRI  format  as  a  CSR 
reporting model to be used by the ﬁ rm for disclosing information.

In contrast, ﬁ nancial institutions, investors that are unable to move funds quickly in and out without affecting 
share price, and dispersed shareholders seem to be only interested in the ﬁ nancial performance of the ﬁ rm, but 
not in its sustainable strategies or activities.

But both corporate ownership results may indicate that, although, in general, investors are interested in proﬁ ts 
and in economic aspects, when there is large dominant shareholder, with interest in the long-term survival of the 
ﬁ rm and in maintaining his or her own reputation, which is strongly linked to that of the ﬁ rm, the ﬁ rm will be 
more likely to adopt decisions that maximise its economic, social and environmental behaviour.

Likewise, it has also been shown that an active posture towards social and environmental issues leads to a greater 

level of social disclosure.

It  can  thus  be  afﬁ rmed  that  the  ﬁ rms  with  the  best  disclosure  practices  in  matters  of  CSR  are  those  that 
have  deﬁ ned  a  clear  policy  or  strategy  in  CSR  which  entails  integral  sustainable  behaviour.  This  includes  the 
fulﬁ lment  of  international  standards  in  environmental  and  social  issues  as  well  as  total  transparency  in  their 
actions  in  this  context.  It  must  be  said  that  this  strategy  is  strongly  backed  by  the  support  of  the  ﬁ rm’s  main 
stockholders.

In short, it can be said that the increasing value that society is placing on the socially responsible behaviour of 
organizations in economic, social and environmental terms, and the legal requirements for this kind of behaviour 
and its reporting to society, have become essential factors leading ﬁ rms to begin to disclose information on CSR 
that  has  been  veriﬁ ed  and  can  be  compared  internationally.  In  this  sense,  the  presence  of  stockholders  whose 
personal image and social reputation are strongly associated with the evolution of the company notably fosters the 
development of these disclosure practices. On the contrary, the investors with a reduced stake in the ﬁ rm’s capital 
show only a limited interest in this area.

It would thus be of interest for future studies to analyze the economic, philanthropic and other motivations that 
are  behind  this  kind  of  business  behaviour,  as  well  as  the  social  and  legal  pressures,  among  other  things,  that 
could foment it.
