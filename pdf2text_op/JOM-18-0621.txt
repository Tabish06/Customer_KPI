The strategic management research tends to use simplified and often uni-
dimensional financial measures for firm performance, overlooking the 
implications for multiple other stakeholders. This proposed review 
reconceptualizes firm performance as a multi-dimensional matrix from a 
multi-stakeholder perspective and exploring strategies that convergently 
maintain or enhance these dimensions (rather than maximizing any single 
one, while treating others as secondary). We adopt a twofold definition of 
firm performance as a pluralistic matrix of indicators that measure the 
extent to which each stakeholder group’s expectations and requirements 
have been satisfied, including investors, suppliers, customers, employees, 
and the community, as well as the effects of one stakeholder group’s 
satisfaction on other stakeholder groups’ satisfaction. We suggest a 
successful strategy should improve or maintain the satisfaction level for 
each of the five stakeholder groups as well as nonnegatively moderate the 
relationship one group’s satisfaction on another group’s. We conduct a text 
analysis of more than 800 research papers that explicitly discussed 
multiple stakeholder groups, published during 2007-2017 in top-tier 
management and specialty journals. We organize findings regarding 
performance implications of strategies into (a) convergence in the 
literature in enhancing both multi-stakeholder satisfaction and influence; 
(b) convergence in the literature in enhancing either multi-stakeholder 
satisfaction or influence; (c) convergence in the literature in enhancing 
neither multi-stakeholder nor influence. Findings in any of these 
possibilities would lead to insights for future work.

A Multi-Stakeholder Perspective of Firm Performance and Strategy:   

A Review and Synthesis 

 

 

Explaining the variation of performance is among the most enduring themes 

in the study of firms (March & Sutton, 1997). It is often considered “the ultimate 

dependent variable of interest for researchers concerned with just about any area of 

management” (Richard, Devinney, Yip & Johnson, 2009: 719). In strategic 

management, enhancing firm performance is at the heart of research, because it is “the 

time test of any strategy” (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987: 802). Empirically, for 

instance, among 30 empirical papers on firm-level analysis published in Journal of 

Management (JOM) in 2017, 11 or about 37% included some sort of firm 

F

r P

performance as a dependent variable. 

 

 

Yet, measuring firm performance is recognized as a highly complex task, 

with little agreement on its basic terminology, definition, and measurement (Ford & 

e

e

r 

R

Schellenberg, 1982; Kanter & Brinkerhoff, 1981; Singh, Darwish & Potočnik, 2016; 

Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). A persistent source of complexity, as Campbell 

(1977) pointed out 40 years ago, is that performance criteria have to be chosen with 

e

vi

e

reference to an organization’s various constituencies, stakeholders, and interest groups. 

w

Formalized by Freeman (1984: 46)’s stakeholder theory, a stakeholder refers to “any 

individual or group who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the 

organization’s objectives”. A stakeholder group is stakeholders with “similar interests, 

claims, or rights” (Clarkson, 1995: 106). In the context of a firm’s business ecosystem, 

essential stakeholder groups include investors (including shareholders), customers, 

suppliers, employees, and the community in which the firm operates (Tantalo & Priem, 

2016). The stakeholder theory argues that satisfying all essential stakeholders 

(including shareholders) defines the corporate objective function (Freeman, Wicks &

Parmar, 2004). Some, like Hill and Jones (1992) and Mitchell, Weaver, Agle, Bailey 

and Carlson (2016), propose formally a stakeholder-agency theory, arguing that the 

manager is an agent responsible for all stakeholders’ expectations. In line with this 

view, an increasing volume of literature includes stakeholder satisfaction as corporate 

social performance (CSP) [for reviews, see, e.g., Aguinis and Glavas (2012), Clarkson 

(1995), Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes (2003), Peloza and Shang (2011), and Wood 

(2010)]. 

e

In practice, however, meeting multiple stakeholders’ expectations creates a 

F

o

r P

problem-solving conundrum (Jensen, 2002; Sundaram & Inkpen, 2004). Driven by 

their own utility functions, different stakeholders may require different definitions, 

criteria, and methodologies for measuring a firm’s value creation (Richard et al., 

2009), suggesting that satisfying one stakeholder group may be at odds with others 

(Chakravarthy, 1986). As Jensen (2002: 238) argues, “[it] is logically impossible to 

maximize in more than one dimension at the same time unless the dimensions are 

monotone transformations of one another [, leaving] the manager with no objective.” 

When managers have to simplify this complexity and prioritize their attention, the 

e

vi

e

stakeholder groups with the most salient status (e.g., power, legitimacy, and urgency) 

w

such as shareholders and their agents would dominate the bargaining process for the 

performance criteria (Kanter & Brinkerhoff, 1981; Tantalo & Priem, 2016).   

 

 

The strategic management research largely reflects this practice, where using 

simplified and often uni-dimensional financial measures for firm performance 

remains prevalent1 –a limitation criticized by Richard et al. (2009). Strategy scholars 

tend to either test the success of strategy against the shareholder-centric financial 

measures or include stakeholder satisfaction as an instrumental means often under the 

guise of CSP-financial performance linkage [for reviews, see, e.g., Orlizky et al.

(2003) and Wang, Dou, & Jia (2016)].   

Research Purpose 

 

 

This proposed review thus seeks to resolve the conundrum by 

reconceptualizing firm performance as a multi-dimensional matrix from a 

multi-stakeholder perspective and exploring strategies that convergently maintain or 

enhance these dimensions (rather than maximizing any single one, while treating 

others as secondary). Recent literature relating stakeholders to firm performance 

suggests that effective stakeholder management should capture not only positive 

F

o

r P

stakeholder satisfaction (Flore & Stoelhorst, 2014; Harrison, Bosse & Phillips, 2010; 

Tantalo & Priem, 2016) but also positive stakeholder influence (Flore & Stoelhorst, 

2014; Neely, Adams & Kennerley, 2002). Following what Simon (1990: 9) refers to as 

e

e

r 

R

“satisficing”, we define stakeholder satisfaction as the extent to which a stakeholder’s 

expectations are met by a firm’s value creation. In other words, “value creation” is 

measured by stakeholder satisfaction, differently defined by each stakeholder group 

(Chakravarthy, 1986; Garriga, 2014). Stakeholder influence, accordingly, defines 

whether and the extent to which a stakeholder’s satisfaction enhances (or reduces) a 

e

vi

e

firm’s value creation for another stakeholder. Since we measure a firm’s “value 

w

creation” as stakeholder satisfaction, stakeholder influence is the effect of one group’s 

satisfaction on another group’s. 

 

 

Hence, we adopt a twofold definition of firm performance as a pluralistic 

matrix of indicators that measure the extent to which each stakeholder group’s 

expectations and requirements have been satisfied, including investors, suppliers, 

customers, employees, and the community, as well as the effects of one stakeholder 

group’s satisfaction on other stakeholder groups’ satisfaction. Specifically, as Figure 1 

illustrates, a successful strategy should improve or maintain the satisfaction level for

each of the five stakeholder groups as well as nonnegatively moderate the relationship 

one group’s satisfaction on another group’s. 

 

 

In this way, our proposed review differs from the existing reviews of firm (or 

organizational) performance (summarized in Appendix table 1) in that we include not 

only satisfaction and influence of all essential stakeholders but also systematically 

review their measures as well as predictors and moderators. We note that unlike some 

recent studies (e.g., Tantalo & Priem, 2016), we do not pre-assign a weight for each 

stakeholder group. Rather, weighing the salience of each stakeholder group is a 

strategic choice, determined by the criteria of enhancing both satisfaction and 

influence.   

F

o

r P

 

 

Because the existing literature is, to our knowledge, unclear on an 

overarching theory that links both dimensions of satisfaction and influence, we 

Research Questions 

e

e

r 

R

suggest an exploratory literature review is appropriate to serve our research purpose. 

We organize disperse literatures and look for potential convergence in the underlying 

logics and findings into a synthesizing framework. We elaborate this below. We 

e

vi

e

review whether and the extent to which strategic management studies have included 

w

multiple essential stakeholders in their theory development when discussing the 

success of a strategy. Specifically, we conduct a text analysis of research papers 

published during 2007-2017 in top-tier management and specialty journals. 

Corresponding to our conceptualization of firm performance, we answer three sets of 

research questions (RQ) related to a paper’s theoretical focus and empirical method: 

 

 

RQ#1 Stakeholder satisfaction: Has this paper discussed any satisfaction 

indicator(s) in its theory development from any stakeholder group’s(s’) perspective(s)? 

From which stakeholder group’s(s’) perspective(s) has this paper discussed the

satisfaction indicator(s) in its theory development? How does the paper define and 

measure the satisfaction indicator(s)?   

 

 

RQ#2 Stakeholder influence: If a paper has discussed satisfaction indicators 

for multiple stakeholder groups, has this paper discussed the relationships of one 

stakeholder group’s activity on the satisfaction indicators of another shareholder 

group? Is there any theoretical development on the causal mechanisms on these 

relationships? If yes, is there any empirical test on these relationships? 

 

 

RQ#3 Strategy: If a paper has discussed satisfaction indicators for multiple 

stakeholder groups, has this paper discussed any predictors in theory development 

e

vi

e

that may affect satisfaction indicators of these stakeholder groups? If yes, is there any 

empirical test on these effects? Are there any convergent findings in the literature in 

terms of these predictors? If a paper has discussed the relationships of one 

stakeholder group’s activity on the satisfaction indicators of another shareholder 

e

R

group, has this paper discussed any moderators in theory development that may affect 

these relationships? If yes, is there any empirical test on these moderators? Are there 

any convergent findings in the literature in terms of these moderators? 

 

 

By exploring the literature to answer these questions, our review differs from 

w

the existing reviews of firm (or organizational) performance (see a summary in 

Appendix table 1), in that we propose a matrix of multiple stakeholder-specific 

measures and systematically review strategies that enhance satisfaction and influence 

of all essential stakeholders.   

Review Method 

 

 

To systematically review firm performance research in the strategic 

management literature, a series of criteria were established to design the review 

strategy. First, we included only original research articles (excluding systematic or 

 

5

meta-analytic reviews, editorials, perspectives, and book reviews) published during 

2007-2017 in ten leading management journals [Academy of Management Journal 

(AMJ), Academy of Management Review (AMR), Administrative Science Quarterly 

(ASQ), Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS), Journal of Management 

Studies (JMS), JOM, Management Science (MS), Organization Science (OS), 

Organization Studies (OS2), and Strategic Management Journal (SMJ)], plus three 

specialty journals in corporate social or stakeholder issues [Business & Society (B&S), 

Business Ethics Quarterly (BEQ), and Journal of Business Ethics (JBE)]. We select 

these journals in line with recent JOM reviews on strategic management topics (e.g., 

Haleblian, Devers, McNamara, Carpenter & Davison, 2009; Richard et al., 2009; 

Song, Gnyawali, Srivastava & Asgari, 2018) and corporate social or stakeholder 

issues (e.g., Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Laplume, Sonpar & Litz, 2008). An 11-year 

F

o

r P

window captures the “citation half-life” of premier journals in business/management, 

and thus ensures that the majority of covered research “remains influential” (Hult et 

e

e

r 

R

al., 2008: 1065). 

e

vi

e

 

 

Second, we then shortlisted papers that included keywords for two or more 

stakeholder groups (listed in Appendix table 2) in their ISI Web of Science topics. ISI 

w

Web of Science returned 1400+ results that met this requirement. Because our 

research questions focus on a paper’s theory development, which is typically 

summarized in its abstract, we then examined closely all abstracts and removed 

papers that were irrelevant (e.g., “institutional environment” rather than “natural 

environment”; “digital community” rather than “community at large”). We have 

finally arrived at 865 papers that specifically included at least two stakeholder groups 

in abstracts and ISI Web of Science topics, among which 676 included two, 149 three, 

34 four, and 6 all five (see details in Appendix table 3).

Third, given the volume of papers and the timeline, we have developed a 

computer-assisted text analysis technique (in R and Python) for our research questions. 

Using advanced machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks 

(CNN) and Structural Topic Modeling (STM) techniques (Kim, 2014; Roberts, 

Stewart & Tingley, 2018), we will conduct a computer-assisted extraction and 

text-analysis of the definitions and measures of stakeholder satisfaction indicators, 

predictors of these indicators, the relationships of satisfaction indicators across 

F

o

r P

stakeholder groups, and moderators of these relationships. Our text analytics help us 

speed up the text search of causal relationships (based on a bucket of keywords for 

causes-and-effects and causal validity techniques), and categorize indicators, 

predictors, and moderators (based on text similarity of word contexts). 

 

  We believe our review will lay out an integrative foundation for future 

strategic management studies that seek to understand performance-enhancing 

e

Conclusion

strategies to satisfy multiple stakeholders. We suggest that any findings regarding a 

strategy’s effects on multi-stakeholder satisfaction and influence will fall into one of 

three possibilities: (a) convergence in the literature in enhancing both 
w

multi-stakeholder satisfaction and influence; (b) convergence in the literature in 

enhancing either multi-stakeholder satisfaction or influence; (c) convergence in the 

literature in enhancing neither multi-stakeholder nor influence. Findings in any of 

these possibilities would lead to insights for future work. For instance, a future study 

could explore the context boundaries in a global sample that are more likely to 

achieve (a).   

 

 

Table 1 has summarized why we believe this proposed review is well-suited 

for the latest review issue of JOM.

Review of Proposed Study Based on Evaluation Criteria of JOM Review Issue 

Table 1 

Summary 

•  Explaining the variation of performance is one of the most enduring themes in the study of firms 

•  The strategic management research tends to use simplified and often uni-dimensional financial 

measures for firm performance remains prevalent1 –a limitation criticized by Richard et al. (2009). 
 

•  A persistent source of complexity, as Campbell (1977) pointed out 40 years ago, is that performance 

criteria have to be chosen with reference to an organization’s various constituencies, stakeholders, and 
interest groups.   

(March & Sutton, 1997).   

For Peer Revie

•  We  examined  the  volume  of  the  literature  by  including  only  research  papers  (excluding  editorials, 
perspectives, book reviews) published during 2007-2017 in  AMJ,  AMR, ASQ, JIBS, JMS, JOM, MS, 
OS, OS2, SMJ, B&S, BEQ, and JBE.   

•  We  have  finally  arrived  at  865  papers  that  explicitly  included  at  least  two  stakeholder  groups  in 
abstracts and ISI Web of Science topics, among which 676 included two, 149 three, 34 four, and 6 all 
five (see details in Appendix table 3). 

•  Given the volume of papers to be reviewed and the timeline, we have developed a computer-assisted 
text  analysis  technique  (in  R)  for  our  research  questions  based  on  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN) and Structural Topic Modeling (STM) (Kim, 2014; Roberts, Stewart & Tingley, 2018). 
 

w

Scope of Interest 

•  Firm performance (or organizational performance in general) is often considered “the ultimate 

dependent variable of interest for researchers concerned with just about any area of management” 
(Richard et al., 2009: 719).

Evaluation Criteria 

Summary 

Organization and Coherence 

•  We have discussed the background/motivation of this review topic, reconceptualization of firm 

performance as the focus, research questions, and proposed review method. 
 

Insight for Future Work 

•  We believe our review will lay out an integrative foundation for future strategic management studies 

that seek to understand performance-enhancing strategies to satisfy multiple stakeholders. 

•  We suggest that any findings regarding a strategy’s effects on multi-stakeholder satisfaction and 

influence will fall into one of three possibilities: (a) convergence in the literature in enhancing both 
multi-stakeholder satisfaction and influence; (b) convergence in the literature in enhancing either 
multi-stakeholder satisfaction or influence; (c) convergence in the literature in enhancing neither 
multi-stakeholder nor influence.   

For Peer Revie

•  Findings in any of these possibilities would lead to insights for future work. For instance, a future 
study could explore the context boundaries in a global sample that are more likely to achieve (a).   
 

approach as well as explored successful strategies that satisfy multiple stakeholders as well as 
positively facilitate their mutual enhancement (see a summary of existing review articles on firm or 
organizational performance in Appendix table 1). 

 

w

Timeliness/Contribution 

•  To our knowledge, no study has attempted to synthesize a comprehensive performance measurement

“In general, then, we treat [organizational] effectiveness not as a 
single statement, but as a set of several (or perhaps many) 
statements, each reflecting the evaluative criteria applied by the 
various constituencies involved to a greater or lesser degree with 
the focal organization.” 

For Peer Revie

 
“Models that recognize the complexity of these issues tend to 
differentiate at least three kinds of "effectiveness"" (a) task 
effectiveness or goal attainment, including output, results, 
efficiency, etc; (b) appropriate organizational structure and 
process, including organizational characteristics, member 
satisfaction, motivation, communication links, internal conflict 
resolution, absence of strain between subgroups, etc; and (c) 
environmental adaptation, including flexibility in the face of 
change, resource acquisition, longer-term adaptation and survival.”
 

“The point is […] individuals become 
involved with an organization (as owners, 
managers, employees, customers, suppliers, 
regulators, etc.) for a variety of different 
reasons, and these reasons will be reflected 
in a variety of different evaluations. It 
appears somewhat arbitrary to label one of 
these perspectives a priori as the 'correct' 
one.” 
 
“Constituency interests play a role in 
definitions of effectiveness via the uses to 
which various groups wish to put the data. 
Various actors in and around an 
organization may require different kinds of 
effectiveness measures for different kinds of 
decisions. Again, no single effectiveness 
indicator, nor even a simple list, will 
suffice.”

“Because each constituent has its own aspiration level, 
[organizational] performance is defined here as the constituent's(s') 
evaluation, using efficiency, effectiveness, or social referent 
criteria […] as to how well the organization is meeting the 
constituent's(s') aspiration level.” 

For Peer Revie

 
“A broader conceptualization of business performance include 
emphasis on indicators of operational performance (i.e., 
nonfinancial) in addition to indicators of financial performance. 
Under this framework, it would be logical to treat such measures as 
market-share, new product introduction, product quality, 
marketing effectiveness, manufacturing value-added, and other 
measures of technological efficiency within the domain of business 
performance.” 
 
“In short, a well-adapted firm must be able to match its strengths 
with the opportunities in its environment; and to align its various 
administrative systems to its chosen strategy.” 

“As an open system, the organization must 
induce each constituent member in the 
coalition to participate by meeting that 
constituent's expectations, at least to some 
measure greater than some comparative 
alternative.”
