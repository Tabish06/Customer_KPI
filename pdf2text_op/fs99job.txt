 A model of work frustration-aggression

 Summary The current study was designed to investigate the situational, dispositional, and affective

 antecedents of counterproductive work behaviors. A model based on the organizational
 frustration-aggression work of Spector and colleagues was tested using structural equa-
 tion modeling and zero-order correlational analysis. As expected, a positive relationship
 was found between employees' experience of situational constraints (events frustrating
 their achievement of organizational and personal goals) and counterproductive beha-
 vioral responses to frustration (personal and organizational aggression), mediated by
 affective reactions to frustration. In addition, personality (trait anger and trait anxiety),
 control beliefs (Work Locus of Control), and estimation of likelihood of punishment
 were strongly associated with affective and behavioral responses. In particular, strong
 direct relationships were found between affective response variables and anxiety and
 locus of control, while direct relationships were found between behavioral response
 variables and anger and punishment. Finally, differentiated relationships between two
 facets of trait anger (angry temperament and angry reaction) and four categories of
 counterproductive behaviors (serious and minor deviance directed at organizational and
 personal targets) were explored. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

 Introduction

 Success in the postmodern, post-industrial organization is in part a function of employees'
 behavioral role choices. The employee may choose a role that goes beyond the performance
 requirements defined by the job role itself, or conversely may choose a role that covertly or
 overtly harms the organization. Thus one broad stream of organizational and management
 research looks at the need of the competitive organization for employees whose performance
 exceeds the demands and expectations of their positions. Such role choices are variously studied
 as pro-role (McLean Parks and Kidder, 1994), prosocial (Brief and Motowidlo, 1986), and
 organizational citizenship (Organ, 1990) behavior. A second area of research looks at the
 vulnerability of organizations to employees' role choices that may harm the organization, ranging
 from mere compliance to hostility, organizational aggression, or sabotage. This set of role

 choices is being studied as anti-role (McLean Parks and Kidder, 1994), antisocial (Hogan and
 Hogan, 1989), counterproductive (Storms and Spector, 1987), deviant (Robinson and Bennett,
 1995) or maladaptive (Perlow and Latham, 1993) work behavior.

 Cognitive versus affective components
 of attitude formation

 What many of the studies in this behavioral role choice area of research have in common is a
 fundamental focus on the cognitive basis of work-related attitude formation, such as percep-
 tions of organizational fairness, equity theory, and the Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) Theory of
 Reasoned Action. In the aforementioned studies, the affective component of attitude formation
 or behavioral response is frequently mentioned, but set aside in the obligatory suggestions for
 further research. This near-exclusive focus on the cognitive component misses a large part of the
 explanation of attitudinal and behavioral variance.

 Frustration-aggression and counterproductive
 organizational behavior

 Recently, however, there has been some resurgence of interest in the affective component of
 attitude formation and behavioral response. One model of the affective basis of organizational
 aggression has been developed by Spector and colleagues (Chen and Spector, 1992; Spector,
 1975, 1978, 1997; Storms and Spector, 1987). This model has its roots in the classic Dollard-
 Miller frustration-aggression theory (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer and Sears, 1939). It
 focuses on the interplay of affective and behavioral responses to certain types of work situations.
 The Dollard-Miller model views aggression as a consequence of frustration. A frustration
 occurs when an instigated goal-response (or predicted behavioral sequence) is interrupted or
 interdicted. It is possible that the individual may find a substitute response for the prevented goal-
 response; however, if that does not occur, the individual may respond with some level (overt or
 covert, externally or internally directed) of aggression (Dollard et al., 1939). The form this
 aggressive response takes will be strongly influenced by the individual's perception of the
 likelihood of being punished. According to Dollard et al. (1939) 'the inhibition of any act of
 aggression varies directly with the strength of the punishment anticipated for the expression of
 that act' (p. 37). Thus overt expressions of aggression through counterproductive organizational
 behavior would be expected to be related to the perception that one could 'get away with it'
 without being caught or punished.

 Subsequent research on this frustration-aggression sequence highlights the mediation of

 emotional reaction. In particular, Berkowitz critiqued the original frustration-aggression hypo-
 thesis for neglecting the mediating role of the arousal of negative affect on the relationship
 between frustrations and fight-or-flight behavior (Spielberger, Reheiser and Sydeman, 1995). The
 two important aspects of this reaction are that the emotion is aversive, and that it results in
 increased physiological arousal (Spector, 1978). Another criticism of Dollard et al. is that their
 approach was too mechanistic, ignoring cognitive and dispositional processes. A more compre-
 hensive model would consider the effects of belief-based variables such as locus of control, as well
 as personality dispositions.

 WORK FRUSTRATION-AGGRESSION 917

 Spector and colleagues extended this theory to the phenomenon of organizational aggression.

 Their models examine the sequence of frustrated events, emotional reactions to frustration, and
 behavioral reactions, in organizational work. Frustrated events may be understood as situational
 constraints in the immediate work situation that block individuals from achieving valued work
 goals or attaining effective performance (Peters and O'Connor, 1980). Emotional reactions to
 frustrated events can be defined both as perceived frustration (Storms and Spector, 1987) and the
 resulting negative emotional state, consisting of aversion and arousal (Spector, 1978). This
 emotional reaction may be considered a subdomain of the much-studied job stress area. Affective
 reactions include job dissatisfaction, feelings of stress, feelings of frustration, anxiety and anger
 (Chen and Spector, 1992).

 Behavioral reactions to organizational frustration include effects on job performance, absent-
 eeism, turnover, organizational aggression, and the interpersonal aggression. To the extent that
 these behaviors interfere with the organization's task performance, climate, or effectiveness, they
 may tangibly damage the organization. As such they may be thought of as counterproductive,
 anti-role, antisocial, maladaptive or deviant behaviors. These behavioral reactions may be
 attempts to find alternative paths to goal achievement, withdrawal from efforts to achieve
 organizational goals (turnover, absenteeism), interpersonal hostility or aggression, or organ-
 izational aggression. Of particular concern is organizational aggression, which is any behavior
 intended to hurt the organization, whether overt (strikes, work slowdowns, or lawsuits) or covert
 (sabotage, withholding of output, or theft) (Spector, 1978).

 The key to the frustration-aggression relationship is the mediation of affective response to the
 antecedent situation. At the same time, however, a number of studies have established the impact
 on this frustration-affective-behavioral response sequence of personality characteristics such as
 affective traits and perceptions of control. For example, individual differences in perceptions of
 control of rewards have been studied in terms of both direct and moderating effects on the work
 frustration-aggression sequence. Work Locus of Control refers to the extent to which people
 believe they control reinforcements at work. Internality is a belief that individuals control their
 own rewards; externality is a belief that others or luck control rewards (Spector and O'Connell,
 1994). Locus of Control may impact both the experience of frustration and the behavioral
 responses to experienced frustration. Spector and O'Connell found that internals experienced
 lower levels of job stressors and work anxiety. Storms and Spector (1987) found some support for
 the role of Work Locus of Control as a moderator in the frustration-behavioral reaction
 relationship, particularly for sabotage. Individuals with low perceived control (externals) were
 more likely to respond counterproductively to organizational frustration. Similarly, Perlow and
 Latham (1993) found individuals with higher levels of externality were more likely to behave
 abusively toward clients at work. These findings may be explained by Allen and Greenberger's
 (1980) suggestion that persons with lowered perceived control may attempt to modify their
 environment and increase their feelings of control through destructive acts.

 The role of affective dispositions has also been explored. Negative Affectivity (NA) is a

 generalized dispositional tendency for an individual to experience negative emotions across time
 and situations, even in the absence of aversive environmental events. The role of negative
 affectivity has been studied with respect to perceptions of job stressors and constraints (Spector
 and O'Connell, 1994) and self-reported frustrators and outcomes (Chen, 1989). NA is closely
 related to Spielberger's construct of trait anxiety, which is defined as the relatively stable tendency
 to perceive a wide variety of stressful situations as dangerous or threatening. Furthermore,
 individuals high in trait anxiety are likely to respond to such perceived threats with higher and
 more frequent elevations in state anxiety, consisting of both physiological arousal and perceived
 feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry (Spielberger and Sydeman, 1994).

 Thus individuals high in trait anxiety would be expected both to perceive more organizational
 stressors (situational constraints) and to respond to them with more frequent and intense
 negative affective responses.

 A second potentially importnt personality characteristic is trait anger, the likelihood that

 individuals perceive a wide range of situations as anger-provoking. Individuals high in trait anger
 are more likely to experience the emotional state of anger (subjective feelings of irritation,
 annoyance, fury or rage, and associated physiological arousal) whenever they encounter frustrat-
 ing or annoying conditions (Spielberger, Krasner and Solomon, 1988; Spielberger and Sydeman,
 1994). Deffenbacher (1992) found that individuals high in trait anger reported experiencing more
 frequent and intense day-to-day anger across a wide variety of provocative situations, greater
 anger in ongoing personally provocative situations, stronger tendencies to respond to provoca-
 tions with physical and verbal antagonism, and lower instances of constructive coping. Thus
 employees high in trait anger might be expected to respond to a wider range of organizational
 constraints with behavioral expressions of anger.

 In developing the State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS), Spielberger and colleagues identified two

 correlated factors comprising trait anger. Angry Temperament (T-Anger/T) describes individual
 differences in the general disposition to experience anger without specifying any provoking
 circumstances. Individuals high in T-Anger/T are quick-tempered, express anger with little
 provocation, and are often impulsive and more likely to express their anger outwardly than to
 suppress it. Angry Reaction (T-Anger/R) describes angry reactions to specific situations involving
 frustration or criticism. Individuals high in T-Anger/R are sensitive to perceived affronts and
 negative evaluations, and respond with intense feelings of anger, although they are equally likely
 to express or suppress their anger (Spielberger et al., 1995; Spielberger and Sydeman, 1994). Thus
 we might expect individuals high in T-Anger/R to experience strong affective responses to
 situational constraints, but not necessarily be more likely to express their anger behaviorally. On
 the other hand, individuals high in T-Anger/T might be expected to respond to feelings of
 frustration with counterproductive organizational behavior.

 Current study

 This study used structural equation modeling as well as zero-order correlational analysis to
 evaluate a model of work frustration-aggression, as outlined in Figure 1. The hypothesized
 relationship between organizational frustrated events (situational constraints) and counter-
 productive behavioral responses is expected to be mediated by affective responses (frustration and

 job dissatisfaction) to the experienced frustration. In addition, personality characteristics includ-
 ing locus of control, trait anxiety and trait anger, are expected to substantially impact the
 constraints-frustration-behavior sequence. In particular, individuals high in trait anxiety and
 with an external work locus of control are expected to report higher levels of frustration and job
 dissatisfaction. Individuals high in trait anger are likely to report more frequent incidences of
 counterproductive work behavior, particularly individuals high in trait angry temperament
 (T-Anger/T). The evaluation of the likelihood of being punished is also expected to impact the
 affective-behavioral response relationship. Those individuals who perceive themselves as able to
 harm the organization without getting caught and punished are more likely to report engaging in
 counterproductive behaviors. In the current study, these relationships were tested using question-
 naire data.

 Hypotheses

 Four hypotheses were tested in evaluating the model.

 (1) Work-related frustrated events (situational constraints) will be associated with a range of

 negative affective responses. A variety of job-related situational constraints in areas such
 as training, resources, planning, assistance from others, time pressures, policies, red tape,
 authority, and access to information will be positively associated with experienced
 frustration and negatively associated with job satisfaction.

 (2) Affective response to frustrated events (situational constraints) will be associated with

 control beliefs and the personality predisposition to experience anxiety. Individuals with
 external locus of control will report higher levels of frustration and job dissatisfaction, as
 will individuals high in trait anxiety.

 (3) Affective response to frustration will be related to counterproductive behavioral

 responses. Lower levels of job satisfaction and higher levels of frustration will be
 positively associated with a higher incidence of counterproductive work behaviors.

 (4) Counterproductive behaviors will also be associated with individual differences in prone-
 ness to experience and express anger. Individuals with high levels of trait anger, in
 particular angry temperament, will report a higher incidence of counterproductive beha-
 vioral response. Similarly, the incidence of reported counterproductive behavior will be
 higher for those individuals who believe they could find a way to hurt the company
 without being caught and punished.

 Method

 Participants

 Participants were 185 full-time employees from eight corporations in Florida and Illinois. The
 minimum qualification for inclusion in the study was that each subject used computers as a
 required part of her/his task activity on the job. The participants represent a wide variety of
 white-collar jobs, ranging from minimal computer expertise such as data entry to high technical
 expertise, such as systems programmer-analysts. Of the respondents, 68.2 per cent were female
 while 31.8 per cent were male; 51.9 per cent worked in private industry while 48.1 per cent were

 Situational constraints were measured by a shortened version of Eulberg, Peters, O'Connor

 and Watson's (1984) Job Effectiveness Survey (JES), which was a modification of O'Connor,
 Peters, Rudolf and Pooyan's (1982) situational constraints scale. The JES was reduced to 13 items
 to eliminate redundancy. The five response choices range from 'not at all accurate' to 'completely
 accurate'. High scores represent high levels of situational constraints on job effectiveness. Chen
 and Spector (1992) reported the internal consistency to be 0.87 for the situational constraints
 scale.

 WORK FRUSTRATION-AGGRESSION 921

 The 16-item Work Locus of Control Scale (Spector, 1988) addresses generalized beliefs about
 control of rewards at work. The six response choices range from 'disagree very much' to 'agree
 very much'. Half the items are written in an internal direction, representing a belief that indi-
 viduals control their own rewards; the remaining items are written in an external direction,
 representing a belief that others or luck control rewards (Spector and O'Connell, 1994). High
 scores on the scale represent externality. Spector (1988) reported a Cronbach alpha of 0.80.

 Affective disposition was measured with the Trait Anxiety (T-Anxiety) and Trait Anger
 (T-Anger) scales of Spielberger's (1979) State-Trait Personality Inventory. The 10-item
 T-Anxiety scale is used to measure a generalized dispositional tendency for an individual to
 experience anxiety across time and situations. The 10-item T-Anger scale assesses the likelihood
 that individuals perceive a wider range of situations as anger-provoking. For both the T-Anxiety
 and T-Anger scales, the four response choices range from 'almost never' to 'almost always'. High
 scores represent high levels of trait anxiety or trait anger, Spielberger (1979) reported alpha
 coefficients ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for Trait Anxiety and 0.82 to 0.92 for Trait Anger, across
 different ages and genders.

 In addition, the T-Anger scale was broken down into two subscales of four items each,

 measuring two related but distinct factors: Angry Temperament (T-Anger/T) and Angry
 Reaction (T-Anger/R). T-Anger/T items, such as 'I am a hotheaded person', describe gen-
 eral disposition to express anger, independent of specific provocation. T-Anger/R items, such as
 'It makes me furious when I am criticized', describe angry reactions to specific situational
 provocations.

 Job satisfaction was measured with a 3-item scale derived from the Michigan Organizational
 Assessment Scale (Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins and Klesh, 1979). Spector and colleagues found
 the internal consistency to range from 0.83 to 0.89 (Storms, 1985). Feelings of frustration were
 measured by a 3-item scale from Peters and O'Connor (1980). Peters and O'Connor reported
 internal consistency to be 0.81. For both the satisfaction and frustration scales, the six response
 choices range from 'disagree very much' to 'agree very much'. After reverse-coding one item on
 each scale, high scores represent high levels of satisfaction and frustration, respectively.

 Counterproductive work behaviors were measured by a scale adapted from the Job Reactions

 Survey (JRS) (Spector, 1975). For the purpose of this study, the JRS was adapted to more
 fully sample the four domains delineated in Robinson and Bennett's (1995) typology of organ-
 izational deviance. The four dimensions are production deviance (minor organizational),
 property deviance (serious organizational), political deviance (minor interpersonal) and personal
 aggression (serious interpersonal). The six response choices range from 'never' to 'extremely
 often'. High scores represent high incidence of counterproductive behaviors.

 The individual's assessment of the likelihood of being punished for engaging in counter-

 productive behaviors was measured with two items. One item refers to the individual's ability to
 generally hurt the company or mess up things at work without being caught; the second item
 specifies harming computer data or systems at work. The six response choices range from
 'disagree very much' to 'agree very much'. High scores represent a high level of confidence in
 being able to hurt the company without being caught.

 Procedure

 A survey booklet, letter of introduction and instructions, and return envelope were distributed to
 each respondent between July 1995 and April 1996. The introductory letter emphasized that
 participation was voluntary and anonymous. Respondents from the bank returned the completed

 booklets to a sealed envelope on site. Respondents from the public university, export firm, and
 library mailed their completed booklets directly to the researcher. Respondents from the
 telecommunications, utility, and healthcare corporations and the private university were given
 the choice of returning their booklets to a centrally located sealed box or envelope, or mailing the
 survey directly back to the researcher. Of 387 distributed booklets, 185 usable surveys (47.8 per
 cent) were returned.

 Table 4 presents the numbers and percentages of survey respondents reporting having experi-

 enced each of the 13 situational constraints at work. These numbers represent respondents who
 did not characterize the statement as 'Not at all accurate'.

 Table 5 presents the numbers and percentages of survey respondents reporting having done

 each of the 27 counterproductive behaviors at work. These numbers represent respondents who
 did not answer 'Never' for each item. Table 5 also shows the breakdowns of the behaviors into
 Robinson and Bennett's (1995) dimensions of organizational deviance. Of interest is the low
 base-rate occurrence of some of the possible behavioral responses. In particular, no respondent
 reported having done two of the behaviors: (1) Purposely damaged a valuable piece of property
 or equipment belonging to your employer. (2) Physically attacked a co-worker. These items
 represent the extremes of organizational aggression, and their zero base rate in a sample of this
 size and nature is not surprising. These two items were dropped in further analyses of the data.

 Relationships among variables

 Table 6 contains correlations among the variables in the model. As presented in Table 6,
 situational constraints are highly correlated (p < 0.001) to personality and control measures, as
 well as affective and behavioral responses. Personality and control measures as well as affective

 responses are strongly related (p < 0.001) to behavioral responses. Finally, likelihood of no
 punishment is strongly (p < 0.001) related to behavioral responses.

 While most of the study variables show high correlations, a path analysis shows that the

 pattern of relationships strongly supports the hypothesized model. This analysis was carried out
 with LISREL 8 (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1993). Figure 2 shows standardized path coefficients for
 the model. Situational constraints are associated with affective response, in particular frustration.
 Both high trait anxiety and external locus of control are associated with affective response.
 Frustration is associated with counterproductive behaviors, thus supporting the mediating role
 of affective response between situational constraints and behavioral responses. Finally, both
 trait anger and likelihood of punishment show strong relationships to behavioral response.

 Behaviors are broken down into the four categories of serious organizational, minor organizational, serious personal,
 and minor personal (Robinson and Bennett, 1994). In addition, behaviors are broken down into two categories of

 two components of trait anger (T-Anger/Temperament and T-Anger/Reaction).

 Of the counterproductive behaviors, minor organizational deviance shows the most consistent

 pattern of strong relationship (p < 0.001) with situational constraints, personality and control,
 and affective responses. The situation-MINORG relationship is significantly stronger than the
 situation-SERORG, situation-SERPER, and situation-MINPER relationships (Hotelling

 (Hotelling dependent t comparisons with William's correction = 3.53, p < 0.001; 2.88, p < 0.01;
 and 2.51, p < 0.05, respectively). The serious organizational and the personal categories of
 behavior are related to most of the situational, affect, and personality variables, but to a far lesser
 extent.

 Discussion

 The major purpose of this study was to test a causal model of work frustration-aggression,
 whereby organizational frustrated events (situational constraints) were related to counter-
 productive organizational behaviors, mediated by affective responses to frustration. Disposi-
 tional and belief variables (trait anxiety, trait anger, locus of control, and belief in the ability to
 harm the organization without being punished) were included in the model. Using structural
 equation modeling, the plausibility of this model was strongly supported, with goodness of fit
 indices of 0.97 and 0.98, and all paths significant. In addition, specific correlational hypotheses
 were tested.

 Summary of tests of hypotheses

 As predicted by hypothesis 1, work-related frustration events (situational constraints) were found
 to be significantly related to each of the affective variables in the model (Table 6). Situational
 constraints were negatively correlated at the p < 0.001 level of significance with job satisfaction
 (r = -0.28) and positively correlated at the p < 0.001 level of significance with frustration
 (r = 0.54).

 As predicted by hypothesis 2, affective responses to frustrated events were associated with
 control beliefs and anxiety proneness. As seen in Table 6, the highest correlates of satisfaction are
 locus of control (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (r = -0.35, p < 0.001). Both locus of
 control and trait anxiety correlate at r = 0.41, p < 0.001 with frustration.

 As predicted by hypothesis 3, counterproductive behavioral responses were significantly
 related to affective responses. Highly significant (p < 0.001) relationships were found between
 behavioral responses and job satisfaction (r = -0.37) and between behavioral responses and
 frustration (r = 0.35). It is noteworthy that, in addition to the hypothesized mediation of the
 situation-behavior relationship by affect, a significant direct relationship was found between
 situational constraints and behavioral responses (r = 0.36, p < 0.001).

 As predicted by hypothesis 4, the incidence of counterproductive behaviors was also associated

 with individual differences in proneness to experience and express anger, as well as with the
 employee's assessment of likelihood of no punishment for deviant behavior. The highest
 correlates of behavioral response are trait anger (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and likelihood of no
 punishment (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). The results suggest that the combination of a personality prone
 to anger and the belief that one has the ability to harm the organization without being punished
 may be the strongest predictor of deviant behavior. It must be noted, however, that belief in no
 punishment may be a result rather than a cause of having performed harmful behaviors (and not
 having been caught)!

 The possibility that antecedent variables contribute differentially to serious versus minor

 counterproductive behaviors targeting the organization versus people was tested. It is, however,

 possible that the lower correlations of situational constraints, frustration, and satisfaction with
 serious organizational and serious personal behaviors might be attributable to the methodo-
 logical artifact of lower base rates of the serious behaviors.

 Finally, the two subscales of trait anger, angry temperament (T-Anger/T) and angry reaction
 (T-Anger/R) were looked at in terms of differential impact on counterproductive behavior.
 Contrary to expectations, angry temperament did not correlate more highly with behavior than
 did angry reaction-both components of trait anger were strongly associated with behavior
 (r = 0.43 and 0.48, respectively). However, it appears that angry temperament is more strongly
 linked to behavioral responses targeting persons, while angry reaction is linked to behaviors
 targeting the organization (see Table 7). This reinforces the call for further investigation into
 differential sources of interpersonal versus organizational aggression. In addition, fear of
 punishment is associated with behaviors targeting the organization, but not personal aggression.
 This is understandable in light of the wording of the items, involving one's ability to harm the
 organization without being punished. A model distinguishing between organizational and
 personal behaviors as well as between angry temperament and angry reaction was evaluated
 with another path analysis (see Figure 3). This path analysis, while exploratory, supports the
 plausibility of such a differentiation (GFI = 0.97; CFI = 0.95; NFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.099;
 chi-square (12 df) = 33.09, p < 0.01), with all paths significant except for the path between
 frustration and personal deviance. Although the path between frustration and organizational
 deviance overshadows that between frustration and personal deviance, frustration and personal
 behaviors nevertheless correlate significantly. The stronger link to organizational deviance may
 perhaps be attributed to the nature of the items measuring frustration as well as situational
 constraints: the wording refers specifically to frustrations and constraints in the work organiza-
 tion. Note that the path from T-Anger/R to personal and from T-Anger/T to organizational
 deviance were nonsignificant and were trimmed from the model.

 Self-report methodology

 Several other factors pertaining to the present study should be considered when interpreting the
 results. The most serious concern is the reliance in this study on self-report methodology. It is an

 ongoing concern in organizational behavior research that the use of a single source of data,
 particularly self-report questionnaires, may result in an overstatement of relationships among the
 variables. However, there are three issues that might be addressed when considering self-report
 methodology. (1) How appropriate is self-report for measuring the particular constructs of
 interest in the context of the particular study? (2) Would alternative measures do a better job of
 measuring those constructs, or come up with different results? (3) Are there practical and/or
 ethical considerations that would prohibit the use of alternative measures and thus result in the
 neglect of the study of important issues?

 The model of frustration-aggression investigated in the current study is the association between

 situational constraints experienced by the employee and counterproductive behavioral reactions
 to the experienced frustration, mediated by emotional responses. Objective constraints and job
 characteristics would seem to be of less importance to the cognitive, affective, and behavioral
 processes, than the employees' perceptions and appraisals of those situational constraints and job
 characteristics (Spector, 1997). As it is these perceptions, rather than objective reality that would
 be expected to lead to experienced frustration and the associated affective and behavioral
 responses, self-report measures may more appropriately tap critical features of the situation than
 would more objective, non-incumbent measures. Where the research goal is understanding how
 people view, feel about, and respond to their jobs, cross-sectional self-report methodology may be
 most useful (Howard, 1994; Schmitt, 1994; Spector, 1994).

 On the behavioral outcomes side, several researchers have pointed out the difficulty of

 obtaining hard criterion data for flagrant delinquent acts such as theft or property damage, while
 individuals are still employed (Hogan and Hogan, 1989; Sackett and Harris, 1984). Furthermore,
 hard criterion data (such as information in personnel files, supervisor reports, and turnover and
 absenteeism records) suffer both criterion deficiency and contamination. They can represent only
 those counterproductive behaviors in which the employee has been caught, which probably
 represent a small subset of those behaviors of which the employee is aware and may report. At the
 same time, a considerable body of literature has dealt with the difficulties in pinpointing
 situational antecedents of withdrawal behaviors such as turnover and absenteeism, which are
 associated with multiple factors such as labor market conditions (Carston and Spector, 1987;
 Kirschenbaum and Weisburg, 1994; Muchinsky and Morrow, 1980) and work/nonwork issues
 (Youngblood, 1984). It is possible that counterproductive behaviors most relevant to a situa-
 tional constraints-frustration-aggression model may be most appropriately accessed through
 self-report measures.

 Where either self-report or behavioral measures are appropriate, it may not necessarily be the

 case that method variance associated with self-report will inflate the relationships of interest. Lee
 (1993) summarizes research showing that people tend to underreport on questions about sensitive
 topics such as deviant behavior, for fear of being caught and punished. This would result in an
 attenuation of relationships, due to restriction of range and underreporting. On the other hand, it
 is possible that equivalent results may be found using either self-report or hard behavioral
 criteria, when such criteria are available. For example, Perlow and Latham (1993) looked at the
 relationship between employee locus of control and aggressive counterproductive behavior by
 workers caring for institutionalized mentally retarded clients. The behavioral criteria were
 recorded instances of client abuse. They found a significant correlation of 0.15 between locus of
 control (external) and abuse. Storms and Spector (1987), using exclusively self-report method-
 ology, found a significant correlation of 0.16 between work locus of control (external) and
 counterproductive behavioral reactions to organizational frustration.

 Finally, there are practical and ethical reasons for relying on anonymous questionnaires in this

 type of research. More important than the inherent difficulty of gaining access to organizational

 participants and confidential personnel data, is an overriding ethical concern in doing organ-
 izational research. Employees may rightly feel at risk in revealing behaviors which could result in
 loss of job or even prosecution (Lee, 1993). Any methodology that could result in the identifi-
 cation of respondents who have committed counterproductive behaviors, and thus endanger
 their livelihoods or result in intensified surveillance or punitive measures as a result of the
 research, violates the most fundamental principles of doing ethical research in organizations.
 Anonymous self-report seems most likely to avoid these ethical pitfalls.

 Further considerations

 A separate issue is the likelihood that the results of this study substantially underestimate both
 the rate of counterproductive behaviors and the relationship between those behaviors and situa-
 tional constraints. While the response rate (48 per cent of employees who received the question-
 naire) was satisfactory, the small number of companies (8) which allowed distribution of the
 questionnaire relative to the number of companies approached (19) may very well represent a self-
 selecting factor. The primary reason given by companies in declining to participate was that they
 were currently undergoing downsizing, restructuring, or other major changes, and that they did
 not want to further 'unsettle' their employees. Employees in precisely such companies might
 provide the richest information about counterproductive behavioral responses to aversive work
 environments.

 This study merely scratches the surface of the issues related to counterproductive behavioral

 responses to frustrating work environments. The construct anger might be more finely tuned by
 measuring proclivity to express anger, rather than the more general trait anger (see the work of
 Spielberger and colleagues on anger expression; Spielberger et al., 1995). A second area needing
 clarification is the differential patterns of relationships between the two measures of affective
 response, frustration and satisfaction. The measurement of affective response to the work
 environment might be more sensitively measured with a comprehensive affect-based scale (as
 opposed to the more attitudinal measure of job satisfaction) such as the Job-Related Affective
 Well-Being Scale (Van Katwyk, Spector, Fox and Kelloway, 1995).

 Of particular interest would be to pursue the different patterns that surfaced for personal
 versus organization forms of deviance. What types of external situational factors (home life,
 work/nonwork role conflict) might account for personal as opposed to organizational aggres-
 sion? Are there personality variables (such as nonspecific angry temperament) that might account
 for an individual's choice of personal versus organizational behavioral response to frustration at
 work? Finally, it would be interesting to break down personal aggression based on the targets of
 the behaviors: supervisors, peers, subordinates, and clients. Do these classes of personal
 aggression relate to different types of situational constraints?

 On a broader level, further research is needed to tie in the organizational frustration-
 aggression model with other currents of research investigating counterproductive behavioral role
 choices, such as organizational justice, psychological contracts, availability of grievance pro-
 cedures, and survivor syndrome in organizations ravaged by downsizing. Finally, it would be
 useful to investigate the conditions under which behaviors an organizational deems counter-
 productive, such as whistle-blowing and withdrawal, might in fact be adaptive from the point of
 view of the well-being of the employees involved.
