and Extrarole Performance

This article examines the relationship of employee perceptions of information privacy in their work
organizations and important psychological and behavioral outcomes. A model is presented in which
information privacy predicts psychological empowerment, which in turn predicts discretionary behaviors
on the job, including creative performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Results from
2 studies (Study 1: single organization, N ⫽ 310; Study 2: multiple organizations, N ⫽ 303) confirm that
information privacy entails judgments of information gathering control, information handling control,
and legitimacy. Moreover, a model linking information privacy to empowerment and empowerment to
creative performance and OCBs was supported. Findings are discussed in light of organizational attempts
to control employees through the gathering and handling of their personal information.

Keywords: information privacy, creativity, organizational citizenship behavior, empowerment

Information privacy concerns are growing among workers who
face increasingly invasive information collection and dissemina-
tion demands from their organizations. At the same time, organi-
zations have an increasing need to monitor and control members
who may (either wittingly or unwittingly) jeopardize the security
of organizational assets. The complexity of this dilemma is under-
scored by research demonstrating that
the institution of rigid
control regimes can undermine personal freedom and dignity and
may have a constraining effect on discretionary behaviors that
benefit the organization (e.g., Benner & Tushman, 2003; Staw,
Sandelands, & Dutton, 1981), including creativity (Amabile, 1997;
George & Zhou, 2001; Perry-Smith & Shalley, 2003; Tierney &
Farmer, 2002) and organizational citizenship (Lee & Allen, 2002;
Lepine, Erez, & Johnson, 2002). Moreover, although the collection
of personal information that is most vital to organizational interests
is often deemed most invasive (Stone-Romero, Stone & Hyatt,
2003), situations exist in which intense information gathering and
control are viewed as necessary and acceptable (e.g., airport pas-
senger screening, background checks for school employees). Our
research addresses two critical needs in the area of information pri-
vacy within organizational contexts: (a) the need for validated mea-

surement tools that allow researchers to tap the different subdimen-
sions of the construct and (b) an understanding of how information
privacy judgments relate to important organizational outcomes.

Research on information privacy has been focused on anteced-
ents, examining how factors such as accuracy, relevance, voice,
and outcome favorability affect individuals’ perceptions of privacy
as they relate to personnel selection (Fusilier & Hoyer, 1980), drug
testing (Racicot & Williams, 1993; D. L. Stone & Kotch, 1989;
Tepper & Braun, 1995), electronic monitoring (Alge, 2001; Zweig
& Webster, 2002), and formal organizational information systems
(Eddy, Stone, & Stone-Romero, 1999). Less attention has been
devoted to understanding the consequences of information privacy.
Additionally, lack of validated measures has made it difficult to
interpret and compare studies. Limitations include the following:
reliance on ad hoc or unpublished items, failure to examine factor
structures and dimensionality (usually reporting only reliability),
inconsistent treatment of dimensionality, and reporting partial-item
lists and other incomplete information (Alge, 2001; Fusilier &
Hoyer, 1980; E. F. Stone, Gueutal, Gardner, & McClure, 1983).
Other studies have developed privacy scales, but the focus has
been on dispositional preferences for privacy (Marshall, 1974) or
privacy values (Smith, Milberg, & Burke, 1996), both of which
focus outside the organization and are context independent. Thus,
we built upon prior measures of information privacy by identifying
items and grouping them into theoretically meaningful dimensions,
confirming dimensionality and ruling out other plausible factor
structures, and ensuring that the measures discriminate between
subdimensions and other constructs.

We propose that information privacy carries intrinsically moti-
vating benefits that lead to increases in discretionary behaviors that
help the organization (see Figure 1). However, we expect that the
intrinsically motivating benefits provided by information privacy
perceptions require a translating mechanism to enact the valued
discretionary behaviors. Psychological empowerment (the feeling
that people have some control over their surroundings and expe-
rience meaning in what they do) should act as a viable translating

mechanism in this case. We begin by defining the information
privacy construct and identifying its three subdimensions.

Information Privacy: Control and Legitimacy Judgments

Information privacy entails the degree of control that an orga-
nization affords its employees over practices relating to collection,
storage, dissemination, and use of their personal information (in-
cluding their actions and behaviors) and the extent that such
practices are perceived as legitimate. Employees form perceptions
about information privacy that can be broken down into beliefs
about their own control over their personal information, including
the extent of their control over (a) information gathering (collec-
tion and storage) and (b) information handling (use and dissemi-
nation). Perceptions are also based on a belief concerning the
legitimacy of a focal organization’s personal information practices,
or the degree to which individuals believe their focal organiza-
tion’s personal information practices violate their personal expec-
tations of such practices, given the situation.

Perceptions of Information Control: Information
Gathering and Information Handling

The concept of control or autonomy is central to many concep-
tualizations of information privacy (Alge, 2001; Eddy et al., 1999;
D. L. Stone et al., 1983; E. F. Stone & Stone, 1990; Zweig &
Webster, 2002). Westin (1967, p. 7) defined privacy in terms of
control as “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to

determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent informa-
tion about
them is communicated to others.” Similarly, Shils
(1966) conceptualized privacy as control of the movement of
information across a boundary from person to person or person to
group. Altman (1975, pp. 17–18) defined privacy as the “selective
control of access to one’s self or group” that involves the “opening
and closing of the self to others and freedom of choice regarding
personal accessibility”—with a lesser emphasis on privacy’s “keep
out” character and a greater emphasis on personal information
“control.”

Information privacy involves different facets of information
control (Stone et al., 1983). Consistent with Stewart and Segars
(2002) and Westin (2003), we distinguished these facets in terms
of the control one believes he or she has over the gathering of
personal information (collection and storage), and, after it is col-
lected, how much control one believes he or she has over the
handling of that information (use and dissemination). These di-
mensions are distinguishable, too, because they are separated in
time (as employees form perceptions about the gathering of the
information when they are asked for it or are told it is being collected,
which generally occurs before they see how the organization handles
the information). We label these control perceptions as information
gathering control and information handling control respectively.

Perceived Legitimacy of Information Practices

Information privacy also embodies a perceived legitimacy com-
ponent, reflecting one’s belief in the extent that his or her organi-

223

zation’s personal information gathering and handling practices
have violated one’s expectations of legitimate conduct, given the
situation. At a sociocultural level, privacy is closely related to
social legitimacy. As Westin (2003, p. 433) stated,

When a society considers a given mode of personal behavior to be
socially acceptable—whether it is hairstyle, dress, sexual orientation,
political or religious belief, having an abortion, or other lifestyle
choice—it labels such conduct as a private rather than a public matter.
This generally means that such matters should not be inquired into for
the purpose of denying someone access to the benefits, rights, and
opportunities controlled by government or private organizations.

This notion can be extended to one’s personal view of the legiti-
macy of organizational attempts to collect and use personal infor-
mation. According to this perspective, organizational information
practices could be viewed as illegitimate when they violate an
individual’s expectations of how an organization should conduct
itself. It is important to note that one’s views of how his or her
organization should act are fluid and can change depending on the
situation.

Collectively, these three subdimensions (information-gathering
control, information-handling control, and perceived legitimacy)
help explain the broader information privacy construct— a con-
struct that we argue is critical to understanding important psycho-
logical and behavioral reactions on the job.

Modeling the Outcomes of Information Privacy

Our model proposes that information privacy is important to
organizations in at least two ways. First, we propose that informa-
tion privacy contributes to people’s intrinsic motivation on the job
by enhancing their sense of psychological empowerment. Second,
we propose that information privacy increases the likelihood one
will engage in discretionary behaviors. We focus on two categories
of discretionary behavior that have theoretical links to information
privacy: organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and creative
performance. Finally, we predict that psychological empowerment
mediates the relationship between information privacy and discre-
tionary behavior. We expand on these linkages below.

Information Privacy, Intrinsic Motivation, and
Discretionary Behavior

Intrinsically motivated individuals are more likely to engage in
discretionary behaviors. Intrinsic motivation concerns one’s desire
to perform a task or job for its own sake, rather than performing it
because of externally imposed prescriptions or associated extrinsic
rewards. There has been some support that intrinsic motivation
yields
increased innovation and creativity (Amabile, 1997;
Spreitzer, 1995). Similarly, intrinsic motivation should lead to
greater helping that is not formally recognized but is performed for
its own sake. Here, we focus on psychological empowerment,
defined as intrinsic motivation embodying a set of four psycho-
logical states reflecting an individual’s orientation toward his or
her work: meaning, self-determination, impact, and competence
(see Appendix A for items and subdimension definitions).

When one examines potential antecedents of empowerment, it
becomes clear that control-based constructs ought to feed one’s
overall sense of control or empowerment. Independence, or free-

dom from constraints of the group, increases a person’s sense of
self-determination (Simmel, 1955). People who believe that they
have control over any personal information they are disclosing to
a group should feel psychologically less constrained by the pro-
cedures and norms of that group and experience a greater sense of
self-determination and meaning in what they do.

Although information privacy may be expected to influence
discretionary behaviors, this effect is likely to be distal, with
psychological empowerment serving a more proximal explanatory
role. Theoretical support for the distal links between information
privacy and discretionary behaviors can be found with respect to
creativity (Westin, 1967; Pedersen, 1997) and with respect to
OCBs more indirectly. For example, Bies (1993) noted the strong
conceptual overlap between information privacy and procedural
justice, the latter of which has been found to be strongly linked to
OCBs (Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001). Psycho-
logical empowerment, in turn, ought to be related to discretionary
behaviors on the job—including those aspects of the job that one
has more control over as well as those aspects of the job that are
not necessarily required or part of one’s formal roles. Here we
focus on two increasingly important forms of discretionary behav-
ior: OCBs and creative performance.

OCB

OCB, the most widely studied variation of extrarole behavior
(Lepine et al., 2002), is discretionary behavior that promotes
effective organizational functioning but is not formally recognized
by reward systems (Organ, 1988). OCBs can be differentiated in
terms of their target or beneficiary (McNeely & Meglino, 1994).
OCB dimensions of conscientiousness, civic virtue, and sports-
manship reflect a class of OCBs that primarily target or benefit the
organization (e.g., attending voluntary meetings) and are called
OCB-O. Altruism and courtesy, alternatively, reflect helping be-
haviors directed at individuals (e.g., helping a coworker solve a
problem) and are called OCB-I.

Because empowered individuals feel less constrained by their
jobs, they have more discretion to act as moral agents to help
others without the repercussions of moving off task (Bandura,
2001), as might be the case in a highly formal, prescribed role.
Moreover, empowerment is reflective of environments where per-
sonal relationships can develop. Self-determination allows for the
unfolding of individuality among group members (Kampmeier &
Simon, 2001; Simon & Kampmeier, 2001) and is critical for the
development of intimacy, trust, and protected communication, all
of which are important functions of privacy (Pedersen, 1997;
Westin, 1967). Employees who feel greater empowerment through
increased self-determination will then be more likely to engage in
OCB-I.

Feelings of empowerment can also enhance one’s identity with
his or her organization, leading to a stronger tendency to help the
organization. For example, impact and meaning deal with interac-
tions with the organization, and are consistent with social identity
theory and relational models of justice (Tyler, 1999). When an
organization creates conditions to enhance the value of one’s
membership in that organization, social identity and exchange
motives should lead employees to reciprocate by engaging in
citizenship behavior directed at the organization (Brief & Moto-
widlo, 1986), to enhance the value of the organization and main-

tain one’s status as a valued member of it (Masterson, Lewis,
Goldman, & Taylor, 2000; Skarlicki & Latham, 1996). Employees
who feel they have greater standing and consequently respect their
organization because of what it stands for will be more likely to
engage in OCB-O. For OCB, we made the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Psychological empowerment will mediate the
relationship between information privacy and OCB-I.

Hypothesis 2: Psychological empowerment will mediate the
relationship between information privacy and OCB-O.

Creative Performance.

Creative performance is another discretionary behavior impor-
tant for organizational survival and can help organizations to
create and sustain a competitive advantage (Amabile, 1988;
George & Zhou, 2001). Creative performance—the generation of
new ideas, products or procedures useful to organizations—is an
important precursor to innovation (Amabile, 1988; Madjar, Old-
ham, & Pratt, 2002), and previous research has demonstrated that
psychological empowerment positively relates to innovation
(Spreitzer, 1996). Amabile’s (1983, 1997) component model of
creativity specifically identifies intrinsic task motivation as a pre-
cursor to creativity, and empirical research has supported this
relationship (Shin & Zhou, 2003; Tierney, Farmer, & Graen,
1999). Westin (1967) argued that privacy is necessary in order to
foster ideas and to allow these ideas to develop, free from public
scrutiny; it is in such criticism-free zones that one has the oppor-
tunity to be creative. Similarly, Pedersen (1997) suggested that
solitude, a mechanism to maintain privacy, reduces evaluation
apprehension and allows individuals an opportunity to experiment

and be creative. Empowered individuals have the freedom to
generate novel ideas and the confidence that such ideas will be
valued. Indirectly, research has shown that close monitoring is
associated with lower creativity. Such evaluation pressures force
employees to desist from taking the risks required for creativity
and create a situation in which workers end up mimicking each
other rather than being creative (Zhou, 2003). Intense information
gathering and control activities inhibit the information sharing
among coworkers that is important for creative idea generation
(Zuboff, 1988). For creative performance, we made the following
hypothesis.

Hypothesis 3: Psychological empowerment will mediate the
relationship between information privacy and creative
performance.

Method

From prior research, we identified an initial pool of 23 items that were
consistent with each privacy subdimension. We reduced the final scale to
13 items (see Results for item elimination rules). Table 1 contains the final
information privacy scales used in the present study, definitions for each of
the three subdimensions, key sources on which the subdimensions are
based, and confirmatory factor loadings across two samples.

Sample and procedures. Following Dillman’s (2000) multicontact
strategy, we sent a survey to 525 white-collar employees (e.g., adminis-
trators, office– clerical workers) from a variety of schools and departments
within a large public university. The university collects and maintains a
variety of types of personal information and data, providing a relevant

context for validating the information privacy scale. All participants had
e-mail addresses and university-provided computers. A total of 310 surveys
were returned, for a response rate of 59%. Sample characteristics were as
follows: gender (76.5% were women, 23.5% were men); age (average of
42.9 years); race (91.6% Caucasian, 1.9% African American, 1.3% His-
panic, 0.6% Asian, 4.6% other racial background); education (21% high
school, 20% some college, 59% undergraduate degree or higher); tenure
(average of 8.8 years).

Measures. The survey included the initial 23 information privacy items
(for final items, see Table 1). The survey asked participants to consider
their organization’s information policies and practices concerning the
methods and procedures their organization uses to collect, store, use and
disseminate personal and work-related information,
including work
behaviors.

Study 2: Cross-Validation of Measurement Model and
Structural Model Testing

Sample and procedures. We sent a survey to 1,800 randomly selected
and currently employed college graduates of a large public university with
active e-mail accounts listed in the alumni database. As with Study 1, we
used a multicontact strategy to enhance response rate. A total of 489 usable
surveys were returned, for a 27% response rate. All respondents had at least
an undergraduate level of education; average age was 41.6 years; average
tenure was 9.6 years; 30% were women, 70% were men. The ethnic
breakdown was as follows: Caucasian (92%), African American (3%),
Asian (3%), Hispanic (1.5%), 0.5% other racial background.

To minimize common source bias, we collected OCB and creative
performance ratings from coworkers. We included a “coworker survey” in
the original survey packet and asked each participant to give it to a
coworker who was familiar with his or her work. Complete confidentiality
was assured in both surveys. Respondents were not required to write their
names on the surveys, and coworker surveys were matched through a
sequence number. Coworker surveys were mailed directly to the research-

ers, and coworkers were assured that their responses would not be seen by
the coworker they were rating. We received 303 matched coworker sur-
veys, for a response rate of 62%.

Additional measures.

In addition to the 13-item information privacy
scale (see Table 1), we measured (a) psychological empowerment, with
Spreitzer’s (1995) 12-item scale; (b) coworker perceptions of creative
performance, with a shortened 5-item measure from George and Zhou’s
(2001) 13-item measure; and (c) coworker perceptions of organizational
citizenship behavior, with 23 items from Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moor-
man, and Fetter’s (1990) study. (See Appendixes A-C for all scale items.)
We also asked coworkers to indicate their relationship to the referent
employee in terms of familiarity (years working as coworkers) and the
employee’s relative status (“1” ⫽ subordinate or lower level; “2” ⫽
peer/similar level; “3” ⫽ supervisor, superior or higher level). Twenty-
nine percent of the coworkers were subordinates, 52% were peers, and 19%
were superiors. To further control for common source bias between privacy
and empowerment, we embedded six marker items theoretically unrelated
to our substantive constructs (Lindell & Whitney, 2001).

Results

Descriptive statistics can be found in Table 2. Examining the
correlations between our marker items and other substantive vari-
ables provides face evidence that common source-method bias is
not a serious threat. Additional tests using methodology suggested
by Williams and Anderson (1994) confirm that although there is
some evidence of common source-method bias, it does not sub-
stantially alter the relationship between information privacy and
empowerment.

Dimensionality of Information Privacy

To examine the validity of our measurement model, we first
conducted exploratory factor analysis on a random 50% of the

Although Anderson and Gerbing (1988) indicated that the above

validity, they recommend an additional test for situations in which
discrimination may be questionable. Because of the high correla-
tion between control constructs, we compared a model in which
the correlation between control dimensions was allowed to vary
versus a model in which the correlation was fixed to one (without
legitimacy in the model). Further evidence of discriminant validity
is established if the chi-square difference test is significant (Ander-
son & Gerbing, 1988; Shook, Ketchen, Hult, & Kacmar, 2004).

To test that information privacy is related but distinct from
psychological empowerment, we conducted a confirmatory factor
analysis specifying two higher order factors (information privacy
and psychological empowerment), indicated by each of their sub-
dimensions respectively. This solution fit the data well and fit
significantly better than a model that collapsed information pri-

The proposed three subdimensions are distinguishable from each
other, are reliable, and are distinguishable from other related
constructs.

Because we conceptualized information privacy as a broad
construct indicated by its three subdimensions, consistent with
research suggesting that information privacy can be represented as
a common factor (Stewart & Segars, 2002), we tested our hypoth-
eses using the broader second order information privacy construct
as indicated by its three subdimensions.

fit. According to data from Study 2, fit statistics
confirmed that the model provides a good fit to the data (e.g.,
root-mean-square error of approximation ⫽ .056, Tucker-Lewis
Index ⫽ .98; Hu & Bentler, 1999; see Table 3). Figure 2 provides
the standardized path loadings (including measurement model
factor loadings), all of which were significant at p ⬍ .01.

Mediation tests. For Hypotheses 1–3 we tested mediation on
the basis of Baron and Kenny’s (1986) methodology extended to
structural equation modeling (Bing, Davison, LeBreton, & Le-
Breton, 2002; Grandey, 2003; Holmbeck, 1997; Kenny, Kashy, &
Bolger, 1998; MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets,
2002; Rupp & Cropanzano, 2002). We also report the Sobel (1982)
test, a measure of the indirect effect (i.e., the extent that the effect
of independent variable on mediator is carried forward to depen-
dent variable), in situations in which Steps 2 and 3 in Baron and
Kenny’s (1986) procedure are satisfied (see also Kenny et al.,
1998). Statistically significant indirect effects may be found using
the Sobel test even when the zero-order relationship between
independent and dependent variable are nonsignificant, as might
be the case when the independent variable is a distal antecedent
(Kenny et al., 1998; Shrout & Bolger, 2002).

The above model test established significant relationships be-
tween our independent variable and mediator variable, as well as

significant relationships between our mediator variable and our
outcome variables (Baron & Kenny, 1986, Steps 2 & 3; see Figure
2). For mediation, one must also establish that the independent
variable is related to the dependent variable when the mediator is
absent (Step 1), and that this relationship is reduced when the
mediator is present (Step 4). We ran three separate structural
models to examine these direct relationships between information
privacy and OCB-O, OCB-I, and creative performance
respectively.

Both paths from information privacy to OCB-O (␤ ⫽.20, p ⬍
.01) and OCB-I (␤⫽ .20, p ⬍ .01) were significant. We then tested
whether these relationships were weakened when the mediator was
added to the model. In both cases, when the mediator (psycholog-
ical empowerment) was added to the model, the direct relationship
between information privacy and both OCB-O and OCB-I went
from significant
to nonsignificant, suggesting full mediation.
Moreover, the nested chi-square difference test between the full
mediation (indirect influence only) and partial mediation model
(direct and indirect influence) suggested that the full mediation
model provided a relatively better fit, ⌬␹2(2, N ⫽ 303) ⫽ 4.31,
p ⬎ .05. The added complexity of the additional partial mediation
paths (direct effect) did not significantly improve model fit, and we
thus reject the more complex partial mediation model. Hypotheses
1 and 2 were supported. The positive relationships between infor-
mation privacy and OCB-O and OCB-I are fully mediated by

psychological empowerment. Sobel (1982) tests reinforced the
indirect relationship of information privacy on OCB-O (z ⫽ 2.61,
p ⬍ .05) and OCB-I (z ⫽ 2.18, p ⬍ .05), respectively.

Hypothesis 3 was not supported according to Baron and
Kenny’s (1986) test because the path from information privacy to
creative performance was not statistically significant. However,
scholars have recently suggested that the zero-order relationship
between independent variable and dependent variable need not be
present for mediation (Bing et al., 2002; Kenny et al., 1998;
MacKinnon et al., 2002). Indeed, the Sobel (1982) test indicated
that the indirect effect of information privacy on creative perfor-
mance was significant (z ⫽ 2.34, p ⬍ .05) with a standardized
indirect effect of .10, indicating a possible distal effect (Shrout &
Bolger, 2002). Although Hypothesis 3 was not supported using
Baron and Kenny’s (1986) test, the Sobel (1982) test supports the
conclusion of an indirect effect of information privacy on creative
performance.

Discussion

The present study contributes to the information privacy litera-
ture in at least two ways. First, the present study provides some of
the first evidence linking employees’ information privacy judg-
ments to important psychological and behavioral outcomes. Spe-
cifically, information privacy was directly associated with psycho-
logical empowerment and indirectly related to both OCB-I and
OCB-O. Theoretically, a mediation model in which information
privacy was related to psychological empowerment, which in turn
was related to discretionary behaviors, was largely supported.

Second, in order for information privacy in organizations to be
examined, it is important to have measures that tap into the
constructs of interest. Although researchers have made several
prior attempts to conceptualize and develop measures of privacy-
related constructs (e.g., Marshall, 1974; Pedersen, 1997; Smith et
al., 1996), this is the first study to develop the information privacy
construct within an organizational context, including its measure-
ment. We found that the higher order information privacy con-
struct can be represented in terms of three subdimensions: infor-
mation gathering control,
information handling control, and
perceived legitimacy of information policies. Moreover, we vali-
dated scales that tap into each of these three subdimensions by
confirming that they represent distinct subdimensions, are reliable,
and can be distinguished from other constructs such as psycholog-
ical empowerment.

The results of the present study suggest that creative perfor-
mance is likely to be one benefit of ensuring an intrinsically
motivating workplace. Surprisingly, although creative perfor-
mance was related to psychological empowerment, it was unre-
lated to information privacy. Perhaps information privacy is not as
important to creativity as originally thought (e.g., Pedersen, 1997;
Westin, 1967), but empowerment, a key psychological mechanism
that privacy is purported to support, is. Alternatively, the relation-
ship between information privacy and creative performance may
be context specific. This relationship, for example, may depend on
factors such as coworker support, employee personality (George &
Zhou, 2001), or type of industry. Also, if information privacy is a
distal antecedent of creative performance, the zero-order effect of
information privacy on creative performance may be low and
undetectable. A weaker effect might be observed as well if co-

workers were judging employees’ creative performance on the
basis of innovations (which can take months to realize) rather than
creative behaviors expressed daily. We found a significant indirect
effect of information privacy on creative performance applying
Sobel (1982). Ultimately, additional future research will have to
decide whether information privacy is a distal antecedent to cre-
ative performance.

The cross-sectional nature of the study design precludes us from
drawing causal inferences. Also we introduced potential biases in
allowing employees to select the coworker rating them as well as
by having only one coworker rating. For example, employees
could select coworkers with whom they have a good working
relationship. Despite this potential, we felt that the value of this
strategy outweighed alternatives, such as allowing the employees
to rate themselves on creative and extrarole performance. More-
over, both the status and familiarity of the coworker were unrelated
to coworker ratings of employee behaviors (see Table 2).

Information privacy is a complex issue for organizations. Em-
ployees’ needs for privacy are inherently at odds with increased
efforts by organizations to gather and use employee information
(Bies, 1993). The present study has implications for those organi-
zations that attempt to gather and handle personal information. As
the present study demonstrates, higher levels of information pri-
vacy are associated with higher empowerment and a greater will-
ingness to engage in behaviors that help the organization. Thus,
organizations must exercise good judgment in striking an effective
balance between information gathering initiatives deemed to re-
duce employees’ control over their personal information and em-
ployee privacy. Those organizations that fail to consider the im-
portance of information privacy may run the risk of inhibiting
discretionary behaviors. Adding to this complexity, workers in
certain industries (e.g., academia, research and development) may
be more sensitive to privacy violations. In other situations, privacy
invasions may be deemed more reasonable, including the afore-
mentioned scenarios of airport passenger screening and school
employees. Future research is needed, therefore, to discern how
contextual factors influence the relationship between information
gathering and control initiatives and individual freedom or privacy.
This balancing act is delicate: too little information gathering and
control, and organizations run the risk that employees may behave
opportunistically, possibly leading to security breaches; too much
information gathering and control, and organizations may compro-
mise employee privacy. Insofar as people feel less empowered,
creativity and extrarole behaviors may be diminished, impeding an
organization’s ability to develop and sustain a competitive advan-
tage. Future research should continue to explore this intriguing
paradox.
