Abstract

For many years, ﬁrms have been organizing supplier conferences, conducting on-site visits, and talking about the concept of joint
buyer/supplier teams. It is believed that the implementation of these concepts enhances inter-ﬁrm relationships. Furthermore, as
ﬁrms move towards closer and more integrated supply chains it is argued that socialization is an increasingly important mechanism
in facilitating and enhancing the supply integration process. This paper has taken these activities and embedded them in the theory
of ‘socialization’ and supply chain integration. The authors propose and test a model on how buyers can use the concepts of supply
chain integration and socialization to achieve improved supplier communication and operational performance, and therefore, to
improve the buyer’s perceived level of the supplier’s contractual conformance. The ﬁndings reveal that socialization is essential for
the development of any signiﬁcant business relationship and the enhancement of a supply integration strategy.

1. Introduction

In recent years,

there has been an increased
development of new manufacturing paradigms such
as lean (Womack et al., 1990), agile (Rigby et al., 2000),
and mass customization (Chung et al., 2000; Duray
et al., 2000). These paradigms have brought with them
new challenges
supply chain managers and
strategists. It has led ﬁrms to refocus their supply
chain activity towards forming closer and deeper
relationships with fewer ﬁrms (Cooray and Ratnatunga,
2001). The move towards closer relationships and the

change in manufacturing paradigms has meant that
ﬁrms are generally managing few (but larger) suppliers
and these ‘mega’ suppliers by their very nature will
require much closer management. There has been an
increasing movement towards adopting the concept of
supply chain integration (Frohlich and Westbrook,
2001), both forward and backward. It is with this in
mind that we explore the concept of ‘socialization’
(Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000) as a mechanism for
enhancing and sustaining the buyer–seller relationships
within the new manufacturing paradigms of the 2000s.
The purpose of this study is to examine the role of two
governance mechanisms on the supply chain setting:
integration and socialization. We propose that the buyer’s
use of supplier integration and socialization mechanisms
will enhance the supplier’s communication and opera-
tional performance and in turn, it will enhance the buyer’s
perceived level of supplier’s contractual conformance.

We use the concept of ‘contractual conformance’ as
a measurable outcome of the use of integration and
socialization in the supply chain. Contractual con-
formance has been discussed at length in the supply
chain management literature (Sako, 1992; Lamming,
1996). Sako (1992) argues that there is a range of
contract types ranging from Arms-Length Contracts
(ACR) to Obligation Contractual Relationships (OCR).
She argues that ﬁrms will set out to create a contract
type where the relationship structure,
investment
(through asset speciﬁcity), and management of the
contract will conform to the type of contract
selected.

We believe that our study makes a signiﬁcant
contribution to the supply chain management literature.
Widespread research interest has examined supply
chain integration as a vital governance mechanism (e.g.
Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Das,
2001; Ragatz et al., 2002). However, although the use
of socialization as an effective governance mechanism
in the buyer–seller relationships has been acknowl-
edged (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Buckley
et al., 2002; Chung and Kim, 2002) to the best of our
knowledge, the inﬂuence of buyer’s use of socializa-
tion mechanisms on the supplier’s performance, both
operational and communicational, has yet to be tested
empirically. We argue that the use of socialization,
along with a willingness
to move towards an
integrated supply chain structure, will lead to higher
levels of communication and operational perfor-
mance. We also argue that the use of socialization
and integration will reduce the perceived risk between
the buyer and the supplier as
the
information ﬂow and transaction speciﬁc investment
of both parties. Therefore, reducing the likelihood of
opportunistic behavior.

We test our proposed model in a cross-sectional
sample of 142 UK companies. We next provide a review
of the current literature on the development of supply
chain management embedded within the theoretical
construct of the resource-based view of the ﬁrm. Next,
we detail the conceptual development of supply chain
integration and socialization followed by our proposed
model and its hypotheses.

2. Literature review

We examine the transactions between buyers and
sellers and argue that socialization and integration, as
forms of control, will have a positive effect on
suppliers’ performance.

2.1. The development of supply chain management

improvements for

The 1990s saw the development of supply manage-
ment as an emerging academic discipline (Ellram and
Carr, 1994; Chen and Paulraj, 2004), ﬁrms began to see
that effective and efﬁcient supply chain management
could yield large direct (cost reduction) and indirect
(improvements in delivery performance,
technology
acquisition, etc.)
the ﬁrm. The
economic environment in the late 1980s and early
1990s also forced ﬁrms to become more competitive as
markets become more globally competitive. Firms
realized that, in order to be able to compete, they must
adopt ‘best practice’ manufacturing techniques. These
techniques needed to focus on not only the internal
production mechanism, but on aligning what suppliers
can deliver with what customers want. This leads to the
‘lean’ revolution in the 1990s (Womack et al., 1990) and
to ‘mass customization’ and ‘modularization’ in the
2000s (Pine et al., 1993; Duray et al., 2000). The current
focus for ﬁrms is on how they can better manage their
supply chain and supply networks to reduce cost and
cycle times, and increase innovations and time-to-
market for new products and services (Handﬁeld et al.,
1999). The integration of the supply chain towards a
(Dierickx and Cool, 1989) ‘seamless’ supply activity is
becoming the priority for ﬁrms (Frohlich and West-
brook, 2001). This level of supply response allows
buyers to customize their products/services and have
them delivered with surprising speed. This type of mass
customization thinking is pervading all areas of service
and manufacturing. Clothing companies such as Levis
and Addidas allow you to design your own jeans and
shoes via their websites and have them shipped the same
day. Car manufacturers are currently attempting to
develop the ‘three day car’, from order to manufacture
to delivery (Franko, 2002).

In order to be able to achieve this level of supply
chain response, ﬁrms must have the appropriate supply
governance structures in place. They must be able to
communicate quickly and efﬁciently with their suppli-
ers. Often, this involves a signiﬁcant attitudinal shift for
ﬁrms. These relationships require ﬁrms to view the
supplier not as an enemy but rather as a collaborator, or
to put it another way, not as a cost but as a capability
(Dyer and Singh, 1998).

2.2. The resource-based view as a mechanism for
understanding inter-organizational socialization

The primary focus of the resource-based view (RBV)
is describing the role of strategic resources and


606

capabilities within the ﬁrm as sources of economic rents
and sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991;
Grant, 1991). We use the terms
resources and
capabilities interchangeably to describe tangible and
intangible assets used in the implementation of
corporate strategy (Ray et al., 2004). It is the contention
of the RBV that ﬁrms in possession of marginal
resources will merely break even, whereas ﬁrms in
possession of strategic resources have the potential to
exploit opportunities and/or neutralise threats in the
environment. Second,
they must be rare among
competitors. Third, strategic resources must be non-
imitable and non-substitutable (Barney, 1991).

Because markets for

resources are necessarily
incomplete, Dierickx and Cool
(1989) argue that
strategic resources must be accumulated within the
boundaries of the ﬁrm. However, not all assets can be
bought or sold; some such as a ﬁrm’s reputation, must
be built internally over a substantial period of time.
They consider that only non-tradable resources are
capable of generating competitive advantage precisely
because there is nothing rare or inimitable about
resources that can be traded in factor markets.

the ‘ﬁrm as an island’

Recent studies question this restrictive assumption
insofar as there exists a growing recognition that some
strategic resources may lie beyond the boundaries of the
ﬁrm (Das and Teng, 2000), that a network of inter-ﬁrm
relationships may also explain competitive advantage
(Afuah, 2001). It is a shift away from the atomistic view
to a more extended
of
understanding,
resources and
competitive advantage are embedded in the wider
network. Thus, the unit of analysis adjusts from the
level of the ﬁrm to the wider buyer–supplier dyad or
network to which a ﬁrm belongs. This change in
emphasis has been termed the ‘extended resource-based
view of the ﬁrm’ (Matthews, 2003).

in which a ﬁrm’s

Recognition that assets may also be acquired
externally on factor markets (Matthews, 2003) has led
scholars to search for resources outside of the boundaries
of the ﬁrm. In particular, studies have focussed on the role
of inter-ﬁrm relationships as a means to acquire external
resources (Ireland et al., 2002). The relationship acts as a
vehicle on which to acquire those resources required to
ﬁll a particular ‘resource gap’ (Grant, 1991), deﬁned as
the gap between a ﬁrm’s strategic goals and its current
resource endowments (Matthews, 2003). However, not
all inter-ﬁrm relationships are equal in this context; the
type of resources acquired is contingent on the form of
relationship between the two parties (Araujo et al., 1999).

of behavior, etc.) between the buyer and supplier.

support

Based on this theoretical rationale, we argue that
supply chain integration and socialization will lead to
higher levels of supplier communication and opera-
tional performance. Socialization is seen as a capability.
This is turn will lead to increased levels of contractual
conformance. We believe that the socialization aspect
has been overlooked as a mechanism for facilitating
two-way information exchange, building and establish-
ing relationship trust, and enabling transparency of
information and cost sharing to take place. It is by
utilizing the processes of socialization as a capability,
which in turn facilitates and supports the achievement
of higher levels of supply integration. We now describe
both concepts in more detail.

2.3. Supply chain integration

The concept of the ‘integrated supply chain’ has
grown in popularity during the last decade. This has
been brought about by changes in manufacturing and
supply strategies and increased levels of global
competition (Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Ragatz et al.,
2002). Firms have realized that in order to become
competitive they have to offer higher quality products
and cheaper prices than their competitors. This meant
that ﬁrms needed not only to improve production
techniques but to focus on the integration of the supply
activity with what customers demand (Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Stump et al., 2002). These improve-
ments would lead to the delivery of high quality
products, on time, at low cost to maximize return. This
also led to the concept of integration, the linking of
suppliers, manufacturers, and customers (Calantone
et al., 2002). The argument has been well made that
linking suppliers into the ﬁrms value/supply chains (to
varying degrees) is critical if the ﬁrm is to deliver
superior value to the consumer (Ragatz et al., 2002).
Furthermore, they argue that supplier integration will
lead to signiﬁcant
improvements in terms of cost
reduction, delivery quality, and shorter cycle time.

Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) point out that the
integration argument has an antecedent in the business
process literature, they argue for greater coordination
between the manufacturing processes of the ﬁrm and the
supply chain so that the customer perceives a ‘seamless’

607

interaction. This approach is also supported by the
strategic alignment literature, where authors argue that
the effective alignment of business processes can only
be realized when there is substantial integration of
business policies and strategies between two parties
(Kopell, 2001; Leisen et al., 2002).

The literature suggests two distinct approaches to
supply chain integration (which are applied to
manufacturing ﬁrms). The ﬁrst is known as ‘forward’
integration, where the integration is managed forward
through the supply chain from the supplier to the
manufacturer to the customer (Trent and Monczka,
1998). This approach tends to be subsumed into the
related areas of just-in-time management (Lee et al.,
2001; Choi and Hong, 2002), and mass customization in
the supply chain (Berman, 2002; Salvador et al., 2002).
The second type of integration is known as ‘back-
ward’. This involves the coordination of information
ﬂows from the customer to the manufacturer to the
supplier (Trent and Monczka, 1998). Information ﬂows
in this direction allow ﬁrms to respond directly to
customer needs and can be coordinated through
multiple organizations or networks. These information
ﬂows were originally made possible through the use of
electronic data interchange (EDI). This technology has
now been replaced by the internet and the introduction
of electronic commerce (Rossenbloom, 2002).

in order

Authors have argued that

to achieve
integration either backward or forward, the ﬁrm must
have the correct supply chain relationships in place
(Choi et al., 2002). This not only improves the ﬂow of
information in terms of customer demand; but it also
allows the supply chain to respond in term of higher
value added issues such as innovation development.
Supply chain integration and the concepts of socializa-
tion are linked closely together. Socialization provides
the mechanism to allow the integration activity to take
place. For example, internal socialization mechanisms
such as cross-functional teams, exchange of personnel
across projects, involvement in kaizen workshops and
other team building exercises, facilitate the exchange of
internal communication and allow the fostering of
relationships within the ﬁrm which may help the
external activities of relationship building. In short as
Chalos and O’Connor (2004) describe it, socialization
acts as a control mechanism to facilitate knowledge
exchange within and between ﬁrms.

2.4. Supply chain socialization

The concept of socialization is well established in the
organizational behavior literature. Early work in this

area was conducted by Van Maanen and Schein (1979)
who focussed on the role and behavior of employees
when being introduced into a new organization. They
examined the mechanisms and strategies that ‘socia-
lized’ these employees into the ﬁrm. Further develop-
ments of Van Maaen and Schien’s work have occurred
across several areas of management
that examine
interaction processes. Feledman and Bolino (1999) take
a Human Resource Management perspective to
socialization and the mentoring system within ﬁrms.
Kraimer
(1997) examines organizational behavior
aspects of socialization on goal and value orientation.
Moschis and Churchill (1978) examine socialization
mechanisms within consumer behavior and its effects
on buying patterns. Sparks and Hunt (1998) show how
socialization can have a positive effect on ethical
sensitivity within organizations. The concept of
socialization has also been well explored in the strategic
literature, in particular, the effects of socialization on
multi-national and joint ventures (Chung et al., 2000;
Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). Socialization in this
context refers to the level of interaction between, and
communication of, various actors within and between
the ﬁrms, which leads to the building of personal
familiarity,
improved communication, and problem
solving (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). It is also
suggested that personal and more open communication
increases the ‘richness’ of the communication itself
(Daft and Lengel, 1986). This will in turn enhance the
inter-organizational relationships.

1990). Furthermore, it is also suggested that frequent
rotation of individuals between organizations (use of
inter-organizational cross-functional teams, or ‘black’
box design teams), can enhance coordination, commu-
nication, and improve the performance levels of the two
organizations (Kumar and Seth, 1998). This work has
been further enhanced by scholars who have studied the
effects of organizational learning as a strategic resource
(Hult et al., 2004),
this involves the concept of
socialization as an exchange mechanism to facilitate
learning inter-organizationally.

3. Proposed model and hypotheses

Fig. 1 depicts the proposed model based on the
theoretical arguments above. The resource-based view
is concerned with the use of assets; abilities and
knowledge within the ﬁrm, with the key emphasis on
conﬁguring internal assets to create external competi-
tive advantage (see Penrose, 1959). We propose that
increasing the level of the buyers’ integration and
socialization with the suppliers will enhance suppliers’
operational and communication performance and, in
turn, it will enhance the buyer’s perception of suppliers’
contractual conformance. The socialisation mechanism
enhances the ﬁrm’s ability to operationalize its existing
assets and to share knowledge (Hult et al., 2003, 2004)
within and between ﬁrms (Donaldson and Preston,
1995). More explicitly, our model
that
increasing levels of buyers’ integration and socializa-
tion with their suppliers will enhance the suppliers’
contractual conformance through the mediating role of
the suppliers’ operational and communication perfor-
mance. We now detail the theoretical rationale behind
our model’s hypotheses.

We posit

the supplier’s operational and
communication performance will be directly and

that

positively related to the buyer’s perception of the
supplier’s contractual conformance. Measuring the
performance of
the supply chain is fraught with
difﬁculties. These difﬁculties range from deﬁning what
to measure to how to measure it (Gunasekaran et al.,
2001; Olson and Slater, 2002). In order to manage a
fully integrated supply chain it is essential to have
effective performance measures in place. Moreover,
these measures and metrics are needed to facilitate
strategies and action plans regarding supply chain
management and improvement.

Furthermore, Gunasekaran et al. (2001, p. 72) argue
that it is important to study performance measures for
two reasons: (1) lack of a balanced approach and (2)
lack of a clear distinction between metrics at strategic,
tactical, and operational levels. They argue that, even
though ﬁrms use a balanced scorecard, these measures
are either predominantly ﬁnancial or operational:
deciding just how many measures to use further
compounds the problem of balance. The key concept
here is ensuring that the metrics are at the appropriate
level and balanced across levels so that strategies are
driven towards actions (Syson, 1992).

Based on a widespread review of the literature, we
have identiﬁed two key measures of performance:
supplier communication performance and operational
performance (see Table 1).

Supplier communication performance refers to the
degree to which supplier’s share information with their
customer (buyer). Information sharing is one of the
‘‘drivers of customer satisfaction’’ (Stewart, 1995). This
measure examines quality initiatives, problem solving,
and technology exchange, as well as the level and type
of information sharing (Towill, 1997).

Supplier operational performance is concerned with
communication issues such as delivery performance,
lead times, and inventory requirements (Stewart, 1995).
Authors argue that this area of measurement is vital to
supply chain integration (Geanuracos and Meiklejohn,
1994; Gelders et al., 1994). The adequate management

suppliers’

of delivery performance and the efﬁcient commu-
nication of customer needs is vital to supply chain
performance (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). Suc-
cessfully managed, it will result in buyers’ perceptions
of
increased contractual conformance.
Improvements in supply chain integration can have
positive impacts on both customer
service and
supplier performance (Vickery et al., 2003). Improved
supplier operational performance could be seen as a
relational resource (Dyer and Singh, 1998), which in
turn could deliver relational rents to both the supplier
(in terms of increased volumes of business) and the
buyer
improved performance, cost
reduction and so on). Furthermore, improved com-
munication performance could be viewed as a
strategic resource to facilitate learning and exchange
of ideas and technologies (Hult et al., 2003), this again
would have the potential to deliver increased rela-
tional rents. Hence, we posit that:

(in terms of

H1. Increases in the supplier’s: (a) operational perfor-
mance and (b) communication performance will

conformance (forward integration).

3.2. Direct effects of supply chain integration

In order to create a ‘seamless’ supply chain, the ﬁrm
must facilitate measures of integration and supplier
performance to allow both forward and backward
integration to occur (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001).
Previous researchers argue that operational perfor-
mance measures such as, cost
reduction, delivery
performance, lead time reduction, and time-to-market
are essential mechanisms for managing an integrated
supply chain (Hines et al., 2000). The literature also
argues that free-ﬂowing communication is essential to
facilitate the measurement and management process.
The RBV approach would suggest that ﬁrms can obtain
competitive advantage (or increased rents) through the
efﬁcient use of assets, skills, abilities, and knowledge
within the ﬁrm. The relational view as proposed by Dyer
and Singh (1998) argues that ﬁrms should also view
their ability to manage their inter-ﬁrm relationships as a
strategic resource. They argue that (Dyer and Singh,
1998, p. 660) ‘‘. . . an increasingly important unit of
analysis for understanding competitive advantage is the
relationship between ﬁrms.’’ They go on to identify four
potential sources of competitive advantage resulting
from the relational approach: (1) relational speciﬁc
assets; (2) knowledge sharing routines; (3) comple-
mentary resources/capabilities; (4) effective govern-

ance. Therefore, improved levels of buyer integration
with the supplier should build on knowledge sharing
routines and also effective governance methods, thus
enhancing competitive advantage, hence, we posit
that:

teams, and it

The concept of socialization has been applied to
to explain interactions
many areas of management
between and within organizations
(Moschis and
Churchill, 1978; Van Maanen and Schein, 1979;
Cooper-Thomas and Anderson, 2002) particularly in
the ﬁeld of Human Resource Management and to a
lesser extent in the marketing literature. However, this
concept has received little to no debate on its
applicability to supply chain management. The insights
generated by socialization are extremely pertinent to the
management of integrated supply chains. This type of
management requires both the application of cross-
functional
requires the sharing of
information at both the inter- and intra-organizational
level. Large-scale procurement projects will often
require the buyer and supplier to form joint project
management teams. High technology projects will also
require the buyer and supplier to share and pool joint
knowledge. The socialization literature argues that
focusing on the exchange issue can improve levels of
performance, as ﬁrms begin to understand how each
other works. Socializing forms bonds and ties that
facilitate the exchange of information and ideas and
helps to build a culture of mutual commitment. All of
these criteria are cited in the literature as essential to an
integrated and collaborative supply chain. The mechan-
isms of socialization (i.e. joint team working, problem
solving (e.g. kaizen workshops), supplier conferences,
etc.) enable ﬁrms to jointly develop ‘relation-speciﬁc’
assets these could be in the form of physical assets such
as product

Hence, we posit that:

4. Research methodology

4.1. Research context

We used the relationship between a buyer company
and a particular supplier as the unit of analysis in
this study. We used companies from a variety of
industries such as pharmaceutical, automotive, com-
munications, ﬁnancial services, and transportation.
The selection of companies from different industries
provided us with substantial variation in the levels
of integration and socialization mechanisms used
by companies. In addition, we considered only inde-
pendent buyers and suppliers (e.g. Rokkan et al.,
2003).

4.2. Questionnaire development

We used a three-step approach in order to develop
our questionnaire. First, we developed a draft ques-
tionnaire using a detailed literature survey. Then, we
interviewed 25 managers from a variety of manufactur-
ing and service companies. Through these interviews,
we were able to incorporate performance criteria used
by buyers in their evaluation of supplier performance. In
the same view, we questioned managers about
the
meaning of supplier contractual conformance. We
found several major
themes that were commonly
repeated by managers. Consequently, we incorporated
these items into our questionnaire.

Second, we contacted a random selection of 20
Purchasing Directors/managers. We mailed them a draft
form of the survey questionnaire and asked them to
identify the scale items, which they considered either
awkward and/or not applicable. They evaluated every
scale item for content and meaningfulness. Although we
did not need to add new items, we modiﬁed some scale
items based on the feedback we received. We also
conducted follow-up telephone interviews with all of
the managers to verify the relevance and clarity of the
survey questions. Third, we contacted ﬁve academics
and asked for their comments on the utility of the scale

items. We made some further
questionnaire as a result of their comment.

4.3. Data collection

4.3.1. Sample

We collected the data for this study in the United
Kingdom. The data reported here were part of a large
project, which was conducted using a very detailed
survey questionnaire (8 pages and 206 questions). Using
a nation-wide database of managers from a variety of
manufacturing and services companies, we obtained
800 names from the database. Next, one of the authors
conducted telephone interviews with a sample of 30 of
the company managers to identify key characteristics
and job roles. As a result, 520 managers agreed to
participate in our project. We used two sources of
motivation for managers in order to increase their
participation. First, we informed them that The
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)
endorsed our project. Second, we also informed them
that a copy of the study ﬁndings would be provided to
them (Rokkan et al., 2003).

We prepared the questionnaire in such a way that the
buyers responded to questions regarding their speciﬁc
relationships with the third largest supplier in terms of
the amount of annual transactions (Rokkan et al., 2003).
Following Dillman’s Total Design Method, the ﬁrst
mailing packet contained a personalized letter, a
questionnaire, and a postage-paid envelope with an
individually typed return-address label. Four weeks
after the ﬁrst mailing, we sent a follow-up letter and an
additional copy of the questionnaire to non-respon-
dents. We obtained 142 usable questionnaires from the
sample, a response rate of 27.3%. Due to cost
constraints, we were unable to send a third wave of
mailing to non-respondents. Hence, considering the
length of the survey questionnaire,
the number of
questions respondents were asked to respond to, and the
number of mailings (only two waves of mailing), we
deem this response rate to be reasonable.

The industry distribution of the respondent buyers was
as follows: automotive (13%); food (12%); consumer
products non-durable (11%);
transportation (10%);
telecommunication/high-tech (10%);
services
(10%); ﬁnancial services (9%); heavy machinery and
construction (8%); public service (7%); agriculture (5%);
technical appliances/components (5%).

non-respondents (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). We
split the total sample into two groups: those received
before the second wave of mailing (n = 99), and those
received after the second wave (n = 43). We compared
these groups in terms of the mean responses on each
variable, using a t-test. The results revealed no
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups,
leading us to conclude that respondents were not
from non-respondents. For example, we

4.3.3. Key informant quality

The aim of this research was to examine inter-ﬁrm
relationships. Therefore, we needed to enlist the help
of informants who would be able to comment on this
issue. Key informants were gathered from two key
sources. One of the authors was given access to the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)
database. This contains over 33,000 individual
members. An additional 60 contacts were added to
the list from personal contacts. The database was
reﬁned and sorted as per our sample frame discussed
earlier. Our aim was to approach the highest ranking
supply person (Purchasing Director) or manager to
gain access to the organization. Key informants had to
conform to a range of characteristics, which were
highlighted in the cover letter and at the start of the
survey. These included being involved in or having
extensive knowledge of a key inter-ﬁrm relationship.
Respondents who did not have this experience were
eliminated from the study. In order to enhance key
informant quality, one of the authors made a series of
telephone calls (approximately 110) to contacts asking
for their help explaining the type of informant that we
required and clarifying names, titles and addresses.
The researchers believe that this process allowed for
clear targeting as well as creating good will between
the informants and the research team (Rokkan et al.,
2003).

4.4. Measures

We used multi-item scales to measure the key
variables in our proposed model. Table 1 shows the
scales and their respective items.

Supplier integration was measured with a four-item,
ﬁve-point Likert scale (1: to a great extent; 5: not at all).
Key informants were asked to indicate the degree to
which they consider
they are integrated with the
supplier in terms of operations planning, forecasting,
order management, and scheduling. Items for this scale
were taken from Carr and Pearson (1999) and Handﬁeld
and Bechtel (2002).

Supplier socialization was measured with a ﬁve-
item, ﬁve-point Likert scale (1: highly effective; 5: not
effective). Key informants were asked to indicate the
extent to which they use team building exercises, social
events,
joint workshops, on-site visits, and regular
supplier conferences, in an attempt to improve the
understanding between them and the supplier. Items for
this scale were taken from O’Donnell (2000), Chung
et al. (2000), and Gupta and Govindarajan (2000).

Supplier operational performance was measured
with a seven-item, ﬁve-point Likert scale (1: very
effective; 5: not effective). We compiled the items for
this scale based on previous research. We asked the
respondents to assess the supplier’s performance during
the relationship in terms of
reduction
(Narasimhan and Das, 2001), delivery to schedule
(Shin et al., 2000; Narasimhan and Das, 2001; Tan et al.,
2002), quality improvement (Shin et al., 2000; Tan
et al., 2002; Fullerton et al., 2003), conformance to
speciﬁcations (Shin et al., 2000), lead times (Shin et al.,
2000), time-to-market (Tan et al., 2002), and process
improvement (Fullerton et al., 2003).

communication effectiveness

Similarly, supplier communication performance was
measured with a three-item, ﬁve-point Likert scale (1:
very effective; 5: not effective). Using the items taken
from previous research, respondent were asked to assess
the supplier’s communication performance in terms of
overall
and
information exchange quality
Govindarajan, 2000),
and timeliness
(O’Donnell, 2000), and feedback
received from the supplier (Mohr and Spekman, 1994).
Buyer’s perception of the supplier’s contractual
conformance was measured with a four-item, ﬁve-
item Likert scale (1: high; 5: low). We used items
taken from previous research to measure this scale.
Respondents were asked to assess their suppliers’
conformance with the existing contracts in terms of
protecting conﬁdential information (Sako and Helper,
1998), being committed to providing necessary

4.4.1. Control variables

To avoid model misspeciﬁcation and to improve the
explanatory power of the model, we included six control
variables in the model: (1) buyer’s dependence on the
supplier; (2) type of purchase agreement; (3) length of
relationship with the supplier; (4) duration of current
contract with the supplier; (5) relationship importance;
(6) type of industry (1: manufacturing; 0: services).
Buyer’s dependence on their supplier was measured
with a two-item, ﬁve-point Likert scale (1: high; 5: low)
developed by Heide and John (1988). Other control
variables were self-report measures.

4.5. Method of analysis

We followed Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988) two-
the
step approach to analyze our data and to test
proposed hypotheses.
Initially, we estimated the
conﬁrmatory factor model in LISREL 8.54 (Joreskog
and Sorbom, 2001). Consequently, we employed a
series of recommended procedures to check for both the
convergent validity (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Gerbing and
Anderson, 1988) and the discriminant validity (Fornell
and Larcker, 1981; Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982;
Anderson and Gerbin, 1988; Bollen, 1989).

We were concerned with two things: (1) non-
normality of the data and (2) common method bias.
First, because some of the constructs violated the rule of
normality, we utilized the technique of weighted least


P.D. Cousins, B. Menguc / Journal of Operations Management 24 (2006) 604–620

613

squares. Second, because the measures used in the study
were collected from the same source, the resulting
common method bias could distort the interpretation of
our results. Therefore, following the procedure recom-
mended by Podsakoff and Dalton (1987), we conducted
a series of tests to check the presence of a common
method bias in our analysis as detailed later.

5. Analysis and results

5.1. Measurement validation

Firstly, we subjected all the scale items of all the
variables to a principal component analysis, using a
varimax rotation. The results revealed six factors with
eigen-values greater than 1.0, which accounted for 78% of
the total variance. Further, Harman’s one-factor test
indicated that the ﬁrst factor did not account for the
majority of the variance (only 22%) and there was no
general factor in the un-rotated factor structure. Although
this initial ﬁnding also revealed that common method was
not a likely threat for this study (Podsakoff and Organ,
1986), the presence of common method bias cannot be
totally ruled out. Therefore, we will further evaluate the
effect of common method bias in the hypothesized model.
Initial run of the CFA provided an acceptable ﬁt.
However, an examination of factor loadings (<.40), high
residuals (i.e. normalized residuals > 2.58), and mod-
iﬁcation indices (>3.84) revealed that the factor loadings
of the two items of the scale of supplier’s operational
performance were lower
than .40. Therefore, we
deleted these items (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1993). After
deleting these items, the measurement model provided

a better ﬁt to the data: x2ð215Þ ¼ 320:5; goodness-of-

(AGFI) = .80; Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) = .92; conﬁr-
matory ﬁt index (CFI) = .93; parsimonious normed ﬁt
index (PNFI) = .70; root mean square error of approx-
imation (RMSEA) = .06. The Cronbach’s alphas, com-
posite reliabilities, and the values of average variance
extracted (AVE) for the constructs operationalized in
this study are also shown in Table 1. We computed
composite reliability and AVE values using the following
formulae (Fornell and Larcker, 1981):

where h is the construct, ly the standardized factor
loading for scale item yi, and ei is the measurement error
for scale item yi.

The convergent validity of the scales was supported;
all the estimated coefﬁcients of all the indicators were
signiﬁcant (t > 2.0) (Gerbing and Anderson, 1988) and
all the estimates for AVE were equal to, or higher than
.50 (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988), except for socialization
the tests for discriminant
mechanisms. Further, all
validity were supportive. That
is, no conﬁdence
intervals of the correlations for the constructs included
1.0 ( p < .05) (Anderson and Gerbin, 1988), and the
square of the inter-correlations between two constructs
was less than the AVE estimates of the two constructs.
This was true for all pairs of constructs except for
socialization mechanisms (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
In addition, we assessed discriminant validity by
comparing the unconstrained model with the con-
strained model in which the correlation between two
constructs was set to one. If the ﬁt of the unconstrained
model is signiﬁcantly better than that of the constrained
model, the discriminant validity test will be satisﬁed
(Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982). We repeated this test for
every pair of constructs. The tests for Chi-square
difference supporting the presence of discriminant
validity were reported in Table 2. Table 3 shows means,
standard deviations, and inter-correlations.

buyer’s perceived level of
supplier’s contractual
conformance (Table 4).

in Table 4. Overall,

As stated earlier, the data on both independent and
dependent variables came from a single respondent.
Arguably, this would cause a problem of common
method bias that generates an inﬂation of
inter-
correlations between constructs and hence distorts the
interpretation of our ﬁndings. Therefore, we estimated a
common method model. The common method model
included a common method factor along with the
constructs and control variables estimated in the

created, assuming that all multi-item scale items load in

indices for the common method model were as follows:

6. Discussion and implications

The purpose of this study was to test a model that
proposes that the buyer’s integration and socialization
with the supplier will enhance the supplier’s operational

levels of buyer/supplier
collaboration. We found support for four out of six
formally hypothesized relationships in our proposed
model. In addition, the results revealed that there is also
a strong direct relationship between the level of the
supplier’s socialization and contractual conformance.
Fig. 2 shows the supported paths in the model. We now
detail our ﬁndings.

Hypothesis 1: We posited that an increase in the level
the supplier’s communication and operational

of

performance will enhance the buyer’s perception of
the supplier’s contractual conformance. We found a
positive signiﬁcant relationship between operational
performance and contractual conformance (t = 2.49;
p < .01). The relationship between communication
performance and contractual conformance was also
signiﬁcant (t = 1.89; p < .05). Hence, Hypothesis 1 was
supported.

This ﬁnding will have a signiﬁcant impact on how
buyers and suppliers manage their contractual relation-
ship. The research shows that, from the supplier’s
perspective, it is important to establish clear commu-
nication channels with the buyer. These allow the buyer

joint conferences,

to understand the level of operational performance that
the supplier is providing. Communication should be
established through both formal and informal links:
regular supplier meetings,
joint
steering committees (buyer and supplier) that will
manage the collaboration. Informal linkages are also
important such as ad hoc telephone conversations,
exchanges of information, and general regular contact.
These interactions act as a mediator to improving the
buyer’s perception of the supplier’s contractual perfor-
mance and ultimately will have a positive effect on the
inter-organizational relationship. Increased levels of
socialization have a positive impact on knowledge
sharing routines, development of relational speciﬁc
assets and improvements in governance structures
through cross-functional
(and inter-organizational)
group working.

These improvements in relationship development
deriving from improved supplier communication are
supported from several of our case interviews, which
were conducted along side research for this project. A
very large telecommunications was interviewed; they
had instigated an active customer development relation-
ship policy by identifying key customer accounts. These
accounts were then given a dedicated relationship
manager. They then developed what they termed as an
‘engagement pyramid’ which is a strategic road map
consisting of quarterly and daily work-stream manage-
ment issues. These are presented by the supplier to the
customer. Both parties then work together on these work
streams to resolve issues and to share beneﬁts. This
particular supplier also applies the same approach to its
suppliers, and has formed a supplier academy. This
involves training their suppliers (particularly those that
are providing outsourcing services to the network) in
the values and beliefs of their ﬁrm. The Purchasing
Director is convinced that by working closely with the
supplier and their customers that their overall levels of
service from both ends of the supply chain have
improved.

organizational relationships will have improvements in

levels of competitive advantage.

Hypothesis 2: We posited that an increase in the level
of integration between the supplier and the buyer will

enhance the supplier’s communication and operational
performance. The relationship between integration and
operational performance was not signiﬁcant (t = 1.41,
ns). Hence, Hypothesis 2a was not supported. We
found a positive signiﬁcant relationship between the
level of integration and the supplier’s communication
performance (t = 2.48; p < .01), supporting Hypothesis
2b.

2002; Vickery et al., 2003) and has been brought about

in the market place (i.e. customers
demanding products more quickly, cheaper, higher
levels of technology development, and at improved
levels of quality). This change has been further
accelerated with the implementation of modern
production strategies such as modularization and mass
customization. Together these changes have driven
ﬁrms towards developing new strategies for managing
their supply structures.

Narasimhan and Das (2001) clearly argue that for
purchasing to be seen as strategic it has to effectively
manage buyer/supplier integration strategies. Other
authors (Vickery et al., 2003) clearly show that there is a
direct ﬁnancial and service beneﬁt to managing supply
chain integration effectively. It would appear from our
research that there is an issue between supply chain
integration and the supplier’s operational performance.
An examination of the theory would indicate that this
hypothesis would hold (H2a). In order to further
understand this ﬁnding we referred this ﬁnding to our
case study ﬁrms. It was clear from the interviews that
whilst most ﬁrms agreed that integration would provide
beneﬁts, they often, in practice, found it very difﬁcult to
achieve. In fact one large automotive manufacturer said
‘‘. . . with the beneﬁt of hindsight I would never have
gone down the integration process . . ..’’ Asked to
explain this further he pointed out that the suppliers
were simply not ready (equipped) to handle this close
way of working. Other interviewees also explained that
their customers (the buyers) were not actually prepared
to part with the requisite information (technologies,
etc.) to allow them to work in an integrated manner.
Therefore, whilst integration clearly has beneﬁts, it also
has costs and may not enhance the supplier’s opera-
tional performance (in fact, in some cases it has had the
reverse effect). This ﬁnding is supported by the
‘relational’ view of the ﬁrm which states that in order
to receive the beneﬁts (additional rents) of relational
management ﬁrms need to have appropriate governance
structures in place, share knowledge and information,
complementarity of assets, and have relational speciﬁc

617

assets. Without these in place it is likely that the ﬁrms
will achieve little to no beneﬁts.

they also show that

The secondary effects of integration, improving
supplier’s communication performance were sup-
ported by hypothesis H2b. This ﬁnding would
certainly be supported by the literature (Narasimhan
and Das, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002) who argue
that improved integration improves the performance of
both the buyer and supplier. What is interesting about
our results is that whilst they agree with the literature
(H2b) that the supplier’s communication performance
is enhanced,
the supplier’s
operational performance is not affected. This maybe
that integration among buyers and suppliers in our
sample are still at a relatively early stage. In that
integration has meant
the setting up of clear
communication channels but has not had time to have
an effect on the operational performance of
the
supplier. Our ﬁndings show a gap in the logic of the
literature, which is that
the assumption is that
integration is either 1 or 0, i.e. you either have it or
you do not. It would appear from our ﬁndings that it
has a much more of a staged effect. Integration occurs
at several levels, probably beginning with improve-
ments in communications and ultimately ending up as
Vickery et al. (2003) show with improvements in both
ﬁnancial and service performance indicators. This will
have implications for managers of both the customer
and supplier. The message from our research is clear.
The process of integration is not a simple one;
integration of supply chain activity requires the
consistent
involvement of both the buyer and the
supplier. Integration strategies should be managed to
facilitate the interchange of information and ideas
between the parties; the role of socialization is critical
to this success.

Furthermore, our research supports the ﬁndings of
the relational view by suggesting ﬁrms need to focus not
only on governance issues but also on asset exchange,
complementarity and relational speciﬁc assets. We add
to the theoretical debate by suggesting that supply chain
integration is a staged process, beginning with
improvements in communication and (we suspect and
supported by evidence from the literature) culminating
in improvements in the supplier’s operational perfor-
mance and ultimately the buyer’s perceived level of the
supplier’s contractual performance, which will lead to
relationship enhancement.

Hypothesis 3: We posited that an increase in the
extent of
socialization mechanisms between the
supplier and the buyer would enhance the supplier’s
communication and operational performance. We

found a positive signiﬁcant
relationship between
socialization mechanisms and the supplier’s commu-
nication performance (t = 4.21; p < .001) and opera-
tional performance (t = 3.95; p < .001), supporting
Hypothesis 3.

The implications of socialization as a method for
supporting the integration process are substantiated
with this ﬁnding. As a method of enhancing the
relationship between the buyer and supplier, socializa-
tion is very important. Schemes such as supplier
conferences, regular meetings (formal and informal),
telephone conferences, and site visits, all play a positive
role in establishing and enhancing the relationship. By
meeting regularly information exchange takes place and
ﬁrms are able to establish clear communication
channels. This process of
information exchange
supports the over arching strategy of supply integration.
The implications for managers are that they should see
supplier conferences, steering group meetings and so on
as an investment in the relationship. At present, most
ﬁrms see these sorts of activities as costs with no
deﬁnable beneﬁt. Our research clearly shows that by
operating socialization mechanisms ﬁrms will realize
greater levels of business improvements and will stand
an increased chance of reaping the full beneﬁts of an
integration approach. This ﬁnding conﬁrms that it is
indeed worth ﬁrms investing in socialization activities
when following a strategy of supply chain integration.
Socialization enhances the supplier’s operational and
communication performance leading to an overall
improvement
in the buyer’s perceived level of
contractual conformance. Furthermore, this ﬁnding is
supported by the ‘relational’ view of the ﬁrm (Dyer and
Singh, 1998), which shows that ﬁrms that have a
competence to manage inter-organizational relationship
will have the propensity to gain competitive advantage
through improved rents from the collaboration. This
research adds to the existing body of knowledge by
demonstrating a linkage between socialization and
operational performance, a link which has also been
recently substantiated by Lindermann et al. (2004) who
found that socialization had a positive effect on the
integration of quality management systems and knowl-
edge creation processes.

The positive role of socialization mechanisms does
raise some interesting managerial questions regarding
the capturing of this beneﬁt. Firms will need to consider
how to design performance measurement systems that
capture the effort (costs) and returns (beneﬁts) from
operating socialization strategies. These beneﬁts are
likely to be more long term and may focus on broader
issues such as problem resolution, joint technology

development and asset sharing, as opposed to cost,
delivery, and quality.

7. Limitations, conclusions and future research
directions

Our study has several limitations. Hence, we caution
the readers to take into consideration those limitations
whilst
interpreting the results of this study. First,
relatively small sample size is one factor that is likely to
cause instability of this study’s ﬁndings. Although the
covariance-based method is an appropriate approach to
test models such as the one we propose here, it is the fact
that the covariance-based techniques are sensitive to
sample size. Hence, a larger sample size is desirable to
obtain more stable ﬁndings. Future researchers should
take necessary steps to obtain larger samples.

Second, we employed data from a single-source in
this study. Even though we took steps to control
common method variance, the common method bias
cannot be ruled out completely. We recommend that
future studies take a multiple-source (or dyadic) data
collection approach in order to adequately address the
issue of common method variance.

Third, we are not able to draw causal inferences
because of the cross-sectional nature of our data. For
example, it is possible that supplier’s performance in
one point in time may inﬂuence the level of buyer–seller
integration and the use of socialization mechanisms in
another point of time. Hence,
longitudinal data is
needed for studying causation.

Fourth, our research setting, companies in the UK,
could limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Though
we have no evidence to claim otherwise, it is likely that
the supply chain systems in the UK may show different
characteristics than those in other countries such the
US, Germany, and Japan, to name a few. Hence, future
researchers should replicate and extend our model to the
samples drawn from other countries. In the same vein,
cross-cultural studies that examine the similarities and
differences between countries based on the model
proposed here will be desirable. In addition, although
the respondent companies in our study represented a
wide variety of sectors and industries, there is also a
need to replicate our model in contrasting empirical
contexts.

Whilst we accept that our study has limitations, it has
also ﬂagged some interesting and important ﬁndings,
namely that the concept of socialization applies to inter-
organizational
is an
important process that will underpin the development
of wider strategic activities such as collaboration and

relationships, and that

this

supply chain integration. Hence, there is a need for more
research on the concept of ‘buyer–supplier socializa-
tion’ and the role socialization plays in developing more
effective and efﬁcient management of
the supply
chains.

Our model shows that supply chain socialization has
a positive effect on both supplier communication and
supplier operational performance. In addition, it also
has a positive effect on the buyer’s perception of the
supplier’s contractual performance. This is, in part, due
to clearer communication on supplier performance and
to the beneﬁts of improved operational performance in
such areas as total cost reduction, delivery, quality
improvement and improved processes, and time-to-
market. This is combined with the effects of supply
chain integration. Supply chain integration also has a
positive effect on how the buyer perceives the suppliers
contractual conformance. The concept of supply chain
socialization, which incorporates such aspects team
building exercises, social events, joint workshops, on-
site visits, and regular conferences, cannot be under-
stated. The creation and maintenance of free-ﬂowing
information channels feeds into all aspects of integra-
tion and contractual performance.

The implications of our research for supply managers
are far reaching. Whilst a great many ﬁrms are moving
towards closer supply chain integration by adopting
techniques such as mass customization and supplier
collaborations, it is clear that in order to support this
strategy the buyer and supplier ﬁrms need to think clearly
about the concept of ‘socialization’ within the supply
chain. Socialization clearly has a positive effect on how
ﬁrms behave and conduct business. The use of cross-
functional teams, social events and supplier conferences
(to name but a few) to develop closer relationships has
often been dismissed as ‘jollys’ or time wasting events.
This research clearly shows that if the ﬁrms want to enjoy
the beneﬁts of collaboration they must also invest in a
‘socialization’ activity. It also shows that if ﬁrms are to
operate these types of strategies then they need to
carefully allocate resources and consider the types of
socialization activity that will deliver the required results
for their organizations.
