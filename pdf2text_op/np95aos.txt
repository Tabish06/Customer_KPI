Abstract 

This paper  analyses  changes  in corporate  environmental  reporting  practices  among  large  Finnish firms in 
the  past  five  years.  Using  content  analysis  of  annual  reports,  we  analyzed  the  willingness  of  firms  to 
disclose  environmental  information  in  the  years  1987  and  1992.  Our  sample  consisted  of  75  Finnish 
corporations  drawn  from  the  largest  firms  in  the  most  environmentally  sensitive  industries.  Our  results 
indicate  marked  changes  in environmental  reporting  practices  between  1987  and  1992.  In  1987,  slightly 
over  one  quarter  of  the  firms analysed  disclosed  environmental  information  in their  annual reports,  while 
in  1992  this number  had risen  to  nearly  one  half of firms.  Most of this disclosure  was  in qualitative,  rather 
than  in quantitative  or  financial, form.  The  results  arc  consistent  with  earlier  studies,  which  indicated  that 
enviromnental  reporting  was  a feature  of  firms  in certain  industrial  Sectors.  We  conclude  by  noting  the 
influence  of  environmentalism  on  Finnish  corporate  environmental  reporting,  policy  and  accounting 
practice.

METHOD 

Based  on  guidelines  and  categories  estab 
lished  by  the  United  Nations  (United  Nations, 
1992),  we  selected  nine  industrial  categories 
with  a  direct  or  significant  environmental 
impact:  chemicals  and  plastics,  construction, 
energy  production,  electricity  and  electronics, 
forestry  and  forest  products, 
industrial  con- 
glomerates,  metals  and  metal  products,  oil trad- 
ing,  and  transportation.  The  categories  were 
selected 
from  a  classification  used  by  the 
Finnish  business  magazine

A very  small  number  of firms  did not  publish 
an annual  report,  and  these  firms were  likewise 
excluded  from  the  sample.  Using  this  method, 
we  arrived  at  a total  sample  of  75,  representing 
the  largest  firms,  both  listed  and  unlisted,  in the 
most  environmentally  sensitive  industries.  The 
sample  includes  firms  with  a  majority  of  state 
ownership 
(traded  and  untraded)  as  well  as 
firms  with  a  majority  of  foreign  ownership 
(traded  subsidiary  fhms).  Firms  that  are  largely 
privately  owned  are  also  included  if  they  pub

The  disclosure  results  by  industry  support 
the  argument 
that  environmental  disclosure

to  be  industrially  related.  Industries

these  same  sectors  disclosed  at  least 
some  information.  An examination  of the  quan-

in 
this  form  is  characteristic  of  only  certain  sec-

ing  is also  spreading  to  new  industries,  such  as 
electricity  and  electronics.  Establishing  a  cor- 
porate  environmental  policy  or  signing  a  pub 
lit  environmental  charter  are  popular  today.  As 
seen 
in  Table  3,  30%  of  corporations  have 
developed  their  own  policy  for  environmental 
protection.  Most  international  environmental 
protection  programmes  have  been  established 
recently. 
In  1987  only  a  few  corporations 
talked  about  them,  but  in  1992  almost  20%  of 
the  corporations  mentioned  some  of  the  inter- 
the  Interna- 
national  programmes,  of  which

By  1992  environmental  policies  were  already 

routine  in  some  corporations:

Some  corporations  reported  on  the  potential 
legisla-

Impact  Assessment  Law.  Several  firms  recog-

the  Accounting  Act  and  the  Company  Income 
Taxation  Law,  valuation  should  have  been

DISCUSSION 

The  Brundtland  Report  popularized  the  con- 
it 
cept  of  “sustainable  development”,  which 
that  meets  the  needs 
delines  as  development 
of  the  present  generation  without  compromis- 
ing  the  ability  of  future  generations 
to  meet 
their  own  needs  (United  Nations,  1987).  While 
the  report  directed  most  of  its  recommenda- 
tions  to  governments, 
it  did  note  that  private 

private 

also  encouraged 

their  own  environmental 

firms  play  a role  ln  achieving  sustainable  devel- 
opment.  Specifically,  industry  needs  to  have  a 
broader  awareness  of  environmental  concerns 
and  its  role  wlthln  them,  rather  than  merely 
complying  with  government  directives.  The 
report 
to 
develop 
policies 
(United  Nations,  1987,  p.  223)  and  noted  that 
firms  that  have  developed  new  technologies 
to 
meet  environmental  standards  are  among  the 
most  prosperous 
(United  Nations,  1987,  p. 
212).  Thus  the  Brundtland  Report  encourages 
to  become  more  environmentally 
industries 
sensitive  by  noting 
that  this  is  linked  with 
increased  prosperity. 

tirms 

and  management 

Further  work  by  the  United  Nations  (United 
Nations,  1991)  has  produced  a  series  of  recom- 
mendations  for  corporate  disclosure.  The  UN 
report,  which  was  written  as  part  of  the  ISAR 
study,  lists  nine  recommendations 
for  envlron- 
in  the  board  of  directors’ 
mental  disclosure 
report 
discussion.  These 
recommendations 
include  such  things  as  envir- 
onmental  issues  relevant  to  the  firm,  envlron- 
mental  policies  adopted  by  the  fum,  goals, 
targets,  and  improvements, 
compliance  with 
regulations,  financial  effects  of  environmental 
protection  measures,  and  the  actual  amounts 
charged  to  operations  and  the  amounts  capita- 
lized  ln  the  reporting  period.  The  UN  report 
further  recommends  disclosure 
in  the  notes 
including  reporting  of 
to  financial  statements, 
accounting  practices 
in  the  notes,  as  well  as 
specific  financial  information  about  liabilities, 
provisions,  and  reserves,  and  contingent 
llabil- 
ities  (if quantifiable),  as  these  relate  to  environ- 
mental  measures 
(United  Nations,  1991,  pp. 
19-21).  Finnish  firms  evidenced  only  minimal 
acceptance  of  these  recommendations,  provid- 
ing  primarily  qualitative  information, 
though 
the  reporting  practices  of  Finnish  lirms  did 
not  differ greatly  from  the  data  on  environmen- 
tal  reporting 
in  other  industrialized  countries 
(United  Nations,  1992).  As  the  report  was 
issued  in  1991,  it is perhaps  too  early  to  expect 
adoption  of  all the  UN  recommendations. 

Earlier  studies  evidenced 

that  although  the 
majority  of  the  corporations  disclosed  at  least

the  level  of 
disclosure  was  generally  low  (Roberts,  1991, 
1992).  Finnish  data  indicate  that  environmen- 
tal disclosure  in Finland  is not  as common  as in 
other  European  countries.  The  disclosure  level 
has  increased  significantly  from  1987  to  1992, 
but  still  fewer  than  half  of  the  corporations

The  results  are  also  in  line  with  the  ISAR 
study,  where  disclosure  was  found  to  be  quali- 
tative  in nature,  covering  in particular  policies, 

attitudes  and  descriptions  of  improvements 
in 
certain  areas.  We  found  similar  results  in  this 
study.  We  emphasize  that  it was  not  the  aim  of 
the  study  to  evaluate  or  compare  corporate 
environmental  performance. 
Instead  we  inves- 
tigated  what  kind of environmental  information 
Finnish  corporations 
are  willing  to  disclose. 
The  study  shows  that  most  of  the  corporations 
are  capable  of  disclosing  environmental 
infor- 
mation  and  that  a  general  environmental  awa- 
kening  has  occurred 
in  industry.  This  is  a 
positive  step  towards  the  further  development 
of  environmental  accounting,  but  we  are  still 
waiting  for  the  implementation  of  corporate 
environmental  accounting  or  accounting 
for 
sustainable  development.
