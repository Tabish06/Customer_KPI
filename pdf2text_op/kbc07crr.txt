  ABSTRACT 
 In this paper, we identify two important approach-
es to corporation reputation building: s ymbolic man-
agement  and  behavioral management . Within the 
ﬁ rst  approach,  corporate  communications  are  in-
tended to generate positive impressions among  ‘ me-
dia  audiences ’ .  Within  the  second  approach,  cor-
porate actions are changed to more closely align with 
the  message  being  conveyed  by  corporation  com-
munications. Many corporate managers assume that 
the symbolic alignment between what is wanted by 
media audiences and what is said enhances corpo-
rate reputation and this, in turn, improves corporate 
proﬁ tability.  In  this  paper,  we  tested  the  relative 
efﬁ cacy of the symbolic and behavioral management 
approaches to corporate reputation and proﬁ tability. 
We found that symbolic management had a posi-
tive effect on symbolic reputation, whereas behav-
ioral management had a positive effect on perform-
ance  reputation.  We  also  found  that  a  positive 
reputation in the media did not contribute to cor-
porate proﬁ tability, whereas a positive performance 
reputation had a signiﬁ cant effect on proﬁ tability. 

We conclude that the behavioral management ap-
proach is more effective for reputation building and 
for  contributing  to  proﬁ tability.  We  also  discuss 
implications of our ﬁ ndings for reputation manage-
ment and corporate performance.

be intrigued by the potential implications of 
environmental  performance  on  corporate 
reputation  and  the  contribution  of  both  to 
ﬁ nancial performance ( Bansal and Clelland, 
2004 ;  McWilliams  et al ., 2002 ). With a good 
corporate reputation, a ﬁ rm not only poten-
tially appears as a stronger rival to competitors 
but may also experience greater proﬁ tability 
( Shamsie, 2003 ). Several recent studies have 
also  reported  evidence  about  the  effect  of 
good  reputation  on  ﬁ nancial  performance 
( Deephouse, 2000 ;  Kim, 2001 ;  Roberts and 
Dowling,  2002 ).  These  ﬁ ndings  reinforce 
management ’ s  belief  for  the  need  to  invest 
in  reputation-building.  Despite  a  consider-
able number of studies showing the impact 
of reputation on proﬁ tability, there has, how-
ever,  been  little  research  examining  what 
kind of reputation-building approach would 
be  most  effective  in  building  a  reputation 
that  enhances  ﬁ nancial  outcomes. We  need 
a  better  understanding  of  effective  ways  to 
build  corporate  reputation  as  a  beneﬁ cial 
contributor to competitive advantage. 

 Generally, there are two ways to produce 
a favorable corporate reputation: a symbolic 
management  approach  and  a  behavioral 
management approach ( Grunig, 2006 ;  Gru-
nig and Grunig, 1998 ). The former approach 
allocates  corporate  resources  to  generate 
positive  symbolic  signals (eg, impression man-
agement such as increasing favorable media 
publicity). The latter approach allocates cor-
porate  resources  to  produce  positive   behav-
ioral   signals  such  as  developing  corporate 
policy  controls,  which  align  corporate  be-
haviors  with  key  stakeholder  needs.  In  a 
symbolic management approach, a company 
places more emphasis on media visibility and 
media  favorability.  It  also  assigns  more  re-
sources to media relations to produce a favo-
rable image. With the behavioral management 
approach, however, management attempts to 
build  a  positive  reputation  by  improving 
business  performance  relevant  to  important 
stakeholders. For example, a chemical com-
pany may work seriously to reduce chemical 

hazards  (ie,  a  negative  consequence)  for  a 
cleaner  environment  at  a  plant  site,  thereby 
accommodating  the  needs  of  certain  stake-
holder groups. In the behavioral management 
approach, management believes that the best 
way to build good reputation is to manage a 
company ’ s  problematic   actions   rather  than 
focusing on image-molding  rhetoric . 

 Given  these  contrasting  approaches  to 
reputation-building, we decided to examine 
which approach is more effective in building 
corporate  reputation.  We  were  also  inter-
ested  in  the  relative  contribution  of  sym-
bolic  reputation  via  symbolic  management 
and  performance  reputation  via  behavioral 
management  on  the  corporate  bottom  line 
(eg, proﬁ tability).  2   Therefore, we designed a 
study to test the relative effectiveness of sym-
bolic  management  and  behavioral  manage-
ment  in  reputation-building  and  their  im-
pact  on  ﬁ nancial  performance.  Two  key 
research questions in the present study are:   

  (1)   How effective are the symbolic management 
and the behavioral management approaches 
in building corporate reputation? 

  (2)   How effective are two different types of 
resulting reputations  –  media reputation 
and performance reputation  –  in enhancing 
corporate proﬁ tability?

 Our  hypotheses  are  summarized  in  a  con-

are 
anticipated to be statistically signiﬁ cant paths 
derived  from  our  conceptualization.  The 
solid-line paths comprise the baseline mod-
el by which we will conduct a set of nested 
model  tests.  Each  path  coefﬁ cient  is  noted 
alphabetically  (eg,  path   c ),  and  the  indirect 
effects are noted by the product of the com-
ponent path coefﬁ cients (eg, path  i  ×  g ).

proﬁ tability via the two dimensions of cor-
porate reputation. Hence, we separated repu-
tation as reﬂ ected in mass media assessments 
of corporate operations from reputation re-
ﬂ ected  in  investor  assessments  of  corporate 
operations. We deﬁ ne  symbolic reputation  as the 
extent  of  favorable  evaluation  and  goodwill 
generated  from  mass  media  coverage  about 
the  organization  among   media  audiences .  In 
contrast,  we  deﬁ ne   performance  reputation   as 
the extent of favorable evaluation and good-
will generated from managerial decisions and 
corporate actions among  strategic publics . Here, 
 strategic publics  refers to those elements of the 
environment  that  are  interdependent  and 
most critical to the organization. These aspects 
of  environment  or  the  groups  are  most 
able to constrain or to help the organization 
( Grunig   et  al .,  2002 ). We  consider  symbolic 
reputation  to  be  a  product  of  symbolic 
management  efforts,  such  as 
impression 

management, and performance reputation as 
a product of behavioral management efforts, 
such  as  pollution-abatement  efforts  and  the 
creation of greater customer value.  

 Isolating Management Approach Effects 
 Some  previous  studies  suggest  that  proﬁ ta-
bility inﬂ uences subsequent reputation rath-
er than the reverse ( Hammond and Slocum, 
1996 ;   McGuire   et  al .,  1990 ).  It  is  logical  to 
suspect that a company with better ﬁ nancial 
performance  generates  a  more  favorable 
reputation,  or  that  a  company  with  better 
ﬁ nancial performance could spend more re-
sources  on  reputation  management,  which, 
in turn, results in a better reputation. If this 
is  the  case,  the  causal  interpretation  from 
reputation to proﬁ tability becomes a research 
design issue that has been raised previously 
( Brown  and  Perry,  1994 ;   Fryxell  and Wang, 
1994 ;   Roberts  and  Dowling,  2002 ).  Hence,

it is necessary to control for prior proﬁ tabil-
ity  in  order  to  help  isolate  the  effect  of 
reputation on ﬁ nancial performance. 

 One  notable  study  addressing  the  causal 
interpretation issue was conducted by  Rob-
erts and Dowling (2002) , in which they clev-
erly  sequenced  research  design  variables. 
Their  multiple  regression  analysis  showed 
the  ‘ relationship between reputation and the 
persistence of superior outcomes over time ’  
( Roberts and Dowling, 2002: 1077 ).  Roberts 
and Dowling (2002)  found signiﬁ cant effects 
for the inﬂ uence of corporate reputation on 
ﬁ nancial  performance  after  controlling  for 
previous ﬁ nancial performance. 

 In  our  own  research  questions,  we  were 
interested  in  testing  the  relative  effectiveness 
of both  ‘ symbolic ’  and  ‘ behavioral ’  reputation-
building  approaches  on  two  dimensions  of 
reputation and on ﬁ nancial outcomes. To do 
so, we needed to control the two approaches 
simultaneously for the different types of repu-
tation and their effects on corporate proﬁ tabil-
ity.  Following   Roberts  and  Dowling  (2002) , 
we  designed  a  study  with  a  time  sequence. 
One of our main interests was to test wheth-
er  reputation  management  and  reputation 
would  have  a  causal  inﬂ uence  on  corporate 
proﬁ tability. Thus,  we  used  the  measures  for 
reputation management and reputation at the 
 t  -1  time point, while we used the measures for 
proﬁ tability  at   t  0 .  Thus,  we  enhanced  the 
interpretability  of  causal  relationships  with 
variables in two different time periods. 

 To  determine  which  factor  would  exert 
more inﬂ uence on corporate proﬁ tability, we 
set up a structural equation model that test-
ed  the  relative  predictor  inﬂ uences  on  the 
outcome variables while controlling for the 
rival variables. By doing so, we could better 
evaluate  the  relative  effects  of  each  reputa-
tion-building  approach  on  reputation  and 
proﬁ tability.   

 Symbolic Management Approach 
 Corporate  management  often  believes  that 
the  expenditures  for  more  media  exposure 

will enhance corporate reputation and thus 
enhance  corporate  ﬁ nancial  performance 
( Deephouse,  2000 ;   Fombrun  and  Shanley, 
1990 ).  Increasing  the  amount  of  favorable 
media  content  has  been  categorized  as  a 
symbolic  or  impression  management  ap-
proach  for  building  reputation  ( Grunig, 
1993, 2006 ). When taking a symbolic man-
agement approach, a company assumes that 
a  positive  valence  of  media  content  is  the 
most  effective  way  to  manage  corporate 
reputation. Corporate management believes 
that  favorable  messages  in  the  media  will 
result  in  a  favorable  impression  about  the 
company,  whereas  they  fear  that  negative 
messages will result in a negative impression. 
Thus, in this approach, the corporate com-
munication department is considered to have 
a  strategic message creation  function that high-
lights the positive aspects of the organization 
for the purpose of increasing favorable per-
ceptions among media audiences, and which 
emphasizes symbols and their effects on the 
cognitions and attitudes of publics. A com-
pany  believes  that  the  right  message  can 
implant  a  favorable  corporate  image  in  the 
minds of their strategic publics. Thus, it at-
tempts  to  ‘ manage  reputation  by  managing 
the production and distribution of the sym-
bols ’   ( Grunig  and  Grunig,  1998:  158 ). 
We  distinguish  the  reputation  resulting 
speciﬁ cally from a symbolic reputation man-
agement  approach  as  a  positive   symbolic 
reputation   (ie,  a  greater  amount  of  positive 
media coverage about the company). 

 The  ﬁ rst  of  our  three  antecedent  factors 
for predicting the level of symbolic reputa-
tion  is   impression  management .  We  deﬁ ne 
impression  management  as  the  managerial 
efforts  to  disperse  a  favorable  impression 
among media audiences by increasing posi-
tive  media  contents.  As  noted,  a  ﬁ rm  that 
emphasizes  the  symbolic  management  ap-
proach for reputation-building considers its 
public  relations  department  to  be  a  hired 
press agent or  ‘ journalist-in-residence ’  ( Grunig 
 et al ., 2002 ;  Grunig and Hunt, 1984 ) whose

success is judged by the amount of proposed 
publicity  and  by  its  placement  rate  in  the 
media. 

  H 1   :    The  higher  the  level  of  prior  impression 
management, the higher the symbolic repu-
tation (path a).  

 We  reason  that  corporate  expenditures  in 
symbolic  reputation  management  (eg,  pub-
licity generation) will be effective in building 
a symbolic corporate reputation in the me-
dia. Thus, we predict that Hypothesis  1  will 
be  supported.  In  contrast,  we  reason  that 
there is little direct inﬂ uence from these im-
pression management efforts to the perform-
ance  dimension  of  corporate  reputation. 
Thus,  we  expect  Hypothesis   2   will  not  be 
supported.  3   

  H 2   :    The  higher  the  level  of  prior  impression 
management, the higher the level of corpo-
rate performance reputation (path b).  

 Behavioral Management Approach 
 The  behavioral  management  approach  to 
building  corporate  reputation  considers  a 
corporation ’ s communication department to 
be one of the stakeholder management func-
tions which: (1) identiﬁ es strategic constitu-
encies, (2) collects  ‘ strategic inputs ’  from key 
constituencies,  (3)  provides  strategic  inputs 
to decision makers so as to preserve the  ‘ val-
ues ’   of  key  constituencies,  and  (4)  builds 
quality,  long-term  relationships  with  these 
strategic  constituencies  by  managing  com-
munication processes ( Grunig  et al ., 2002 ). 
 The  behavioral  management  approach 
asserts that the success of a corporation de-
pends on its ability to respond to stakeholder 
interests  and  concerns  ( Post   et  al .,  2002 ). 
Hence,  corporate  communication  becomes 
a  tool  for  facilitating  joint  problem-solving 
between  the  company  and  its  stakeholders 
and the management undertakes surveillance 

efforts to identify problem-causing decisions 
and  actions.  If  the  company  found  a  prob-
lematic business decision or action, it would 
then proactively work to reduce the conse-
quences considered damaging by the inter-
ested stakeholder groups. In this approach, a 
reputation  for  performance  is  a  ‘ byproduct ’  
of stakeholder management via collaborative 
problem-solving  efforts  by  the  company. 
Such a ﬁ rm considers good reputation to be 
dependent  on  the  corporate  behaviors  re-
membered  by  publics  ( Grunig  and  Grunig, 
1998 ). 

 Notably,  communication  plays  a  role  in 
stimulating mutual changes between the or-
ganization and its critical stakeholders in the 
behavioral management approach (eg, envi-
ronmental scanning or intelligence gathering 
before  making  managerial  decisions). Thus, 
the  purpose  of  communication  is  not  uni-
lateral persuasion or image-creation in order 
to encourage favorable behavior from stake-
holders,  as  is  the  case  with  the  symbolic 
management  approach.  Instead,  corporate 
communication  managers  play  the  role  of 
strategic  boundary  spanners  between  com-
pany  management  and  its  environment  to 
increase  co-adaptation  of  organization  and 
its  strategic  constituencies  ( Grunig,  1993, 
2006 ;  Grunig  et al ., 2002 ). Speciﬁ cally, com-
munication  managers  proactively  deal  with 
what could be perceived by strategic publics 
to  be  negative  corporate  behaviors  before 
and during a critical decision-making process. 
They  neutralize  or  enhance  the  perceived 
consequences of corporate action and policy 
by  eliciting  mutual  changes  from  both  the 
company  and  stakeholders.  The  resulting 
performance reputation through the behav-
ioral management approach is dependent on 
 positive  behaviors   that  publics  recall  cogni-
tively  as  a  performance  reputation  rather 
than as a symbolic reputation. 

 The second antecedent variable included 
in this study is  environmental performance . Re-
garding  the  importance  of  environmental 
performance,  a  number  of  management

scholars have found that corporate initiatives 
geared toward environmental protection are 
not  only  socially  responsible  but  also  en-
hance a corporation ’ s reputational advantage 
( Bansal  and  Clelland,  2004 ;   Klassen  and 
McLaughlin, 1996 ;  Miles and Covin, 2000 ). 
 Salama  (2003)   also  analyzed  the  link  be-
tween  corporate  environmental  reputation 
and  ﬁ nancial  performance  and  his  ﬁ ndings 
suggest 
environmental 
management  efforts  beneﬁ t  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance.  Salama (2003)  thus recommended 
progressive  environmental  management  ac-
tions as a means to regain trust from investors 
and  key  stakeholders.  Using  event  study 
methodology,  Gilley  et al . (2000)  studied the 
positive relationship between environmental 
initiatives  and  ﬁ rm  performance  (ie,  stock 
returns).  From  the  ﬁ nding,  they  inferred 
that  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  efforts  at  addressing  environ-
mental protection should serve as an impor-
tant  reputation-building  factor.  Thus,  we 
expect that environmental performance does 
have  a  direct  inﬂ uence  on  performance 
reputation. 

  H 3   :    The higher the level of prior environmental 
performance,  the  higher  the  performance 
reputation (path c).  

 In contrast, we expect the direct endeavors 
for  enhancing  environmental  performance 
to not have a signiﬁ cant effect on symbolic 
reputation.  Thus,  we  expect  Hypothesis   4  
will not be supported. 

  H 4   :    There is a signiﬁ cant effect of the level of 
prior  environmental  performance  on  the 
symbolic reputation (path d).  

 The  third  antecedent  variable  is   ﬁ nancial 
performance .  In  addition  to  environmental 
performance,  the  managerial  effort  to  en-
hance goal-achievement (eg, proﬁ tability) is 
another  key  dimension  in  the  behavioral 

management  approach  to  reputation-build-
ing.  The  effectiveness  of  past  managerial 
actions  should  be  a  signiﬁ cant  factor  in 
building a performance reputation and sub-
sequent  ﬁ nancial  outcomes  such  as  return-
on-assets  (ROA).  For  example,   Hammond 
and Slocum (1996)  found ﬁ nancial perform-
ance (eg, ROS) had some inﬂ uence on sub-
sequent  corporate  reputation  (ie,  Fortune 
Index). Hence, we predict that prior proﬁ t-
ability  has  signiﬁ cant  effects  on  corporate 
reputation for performance. 

  H 5   :    The higher the level of prior proﬁ tability, the 
higher the performance reputation (path e).  

 Inﬂ uence of Reputation on Financial 
Performance 
 Corporate managers often assume that stake-
holder  judgments  about  a  company  will 
be  inﬂ uenced  signiﬁ cantly  by  mass  media 
( Fombrun and Shanley, 1990 ). They believe 
that the placement of favorable messages will 
cause  actual  processing,  retention  and  ac-
ceptance  of  the  media  content  available  to 
stakeholders. Such receptive audience behav-
iors  would,  in  turn,  enhance  corporate 
ﬁ nancial  performance.   Deephouse  (2000)  
tested the effect of media favorability on ﬁ -
nancial outcomes: that is  ‘ A more favorable 
media  reputation 
increases  performance ’  
(1100). He found some effect between  ‘ me-
dia favorability ’  and  ‘ ROA ’  ( Deephouse, 2000: 
1105 ). Thus, Deephouse ’ s ﬁ nding seemed to 
reinforce  managerial  beliefs  that  favorable 
media  coverage  (ie,  good  symbolic  reputa-
tion) will pay off ﬁ nancially. 

 We, however, question whether the effect 
of  a  symbolic  reputation  on  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance  remains  if  the  inﬂ uence  of  prior 
proﬁ tability  and  behavioral  management 
efforts  is  considered.  Although  impression 
management efforts could produce a favora-
ble symbolic reputation, this type of reputa-
tion  may  have  no  direct  inﬂ uence  or 
merely  a  marginal  effect  on  corporate

 Kim, Bach and Clelland 

ﬁ nancial outcomes such as proﬁ tability. Our 
study controls for past ﬁ nancial performance 
to avoid confounded direct-effect estimation 
from  symbolic  reputation  to  proﬁ tability. 
Also,  by  controlling  for  prior  proﬁ tability, 
impression management efforts are less like-
ly  to  have  a  signiﬁ cant  indirect  effect  on 
proﬁ tability  through  the  enhancement  of 
symbolic  reputation. Thus,  we  expect  that 
Hypothesis  6  and Hypothesis  7  will not be 
supported. 

  H 6   :    The  higher  the  level  of  symbolic  reputa-
tion,  the  higher  the  corporate  proﬁ tability 
(path f).  

  H 7   :    There is a signiﬁ cant indirect effect of pri-
or  impression  management  on  corporate 
proﬁ tability  via  symbolic  reputation  (path 
a  ×   f).  

 We  now  propose  that  efforts  at  behavioral 
management  would  be  a  more  effective 
method  of  improving  ﬁ nancial  outcomes 
through  performance  reputation-building. 
Speciﬁ cally,  we  predict  that  management 
efforts  to  change  corporate  behaviors  will 
exert  more  substantial  inﬂ uences  than  im-
pression management efforts in the  perform-
ance  dimension   of  corporate  reputation  and 
this,  in  turn,  enhances  the  accomplishment 
of primary corporate objectives such as prof-
itability. We expect Hypothesis  8  will be sup-
ported  because  of  our  reasoning  on  the 
effectiveness  of  the  behavioral  reputation-
building approach. Speciﬁ cally, we anticipate 
that  ﬁ nancial  and  environmental  perform-
ances  increase  the  reputed  values  of  a 
company ’ s  overall  performance  through  an 
enhanced performance reputation. We assert 
that  a  good  performance  reputation  is  a 
more  substantial  measure  of  corporate  op-
erational effectiveness than a good symbolic 
reputation. Thus,  we  reason  that  perform-
ance reputation will be a stronger predictor 
for corporate proﬁ tability. 

  H 8   :    The higher the level of performance reputa-
tion,  the  higher  the  corporate  proﬁ tability 
(path g).  

 As  an  extension  of  Hypothesis   8 ,  we  were 
also interested in testing the indirect effects 
of  two  dimensions  of  prior  operational  ef-
fectiveness, environmental and ﬁ nancial per-
formance, on corporate proﬁ tability through 
the  enhancement  of  a  corporation ’ s  per-
formance  reputation.  Thus,  we  introduce 
two indirect-effect tests: 

  H 9   : 

  There  is  a  signiﬁ cant  indirect  effect  of 
prior  environmental  performance  on  cor-
porate proﬁ tability via performance repu-
tation (path c  ×  g).  

  H 10   :    There  is  a  signiﬁ cant  indirect  effect  of 
prior  proﬁ tability  on  corporate  proﬁ tabil-
ity  via  performance  reputation  (path 
e  ×  g).  

 In addition, we reason that the goodness of past 
ﬁ nancial performance should exert some direct 
inﬂ uences, not mediated through reputation on 
current  proﬁ tability.  Proﬁ tability  cannot  be 
solely  determined  by  corporate  reputation. 
Some other factors such as product innovation 
could likely exert inﬂ uence as well. 

  H 11   :    The higher the level of prior proﬁ tability, 
the  higher  the  level  of  current  corporate 
proﬁ tability (path h).  

 Finally, we are interested in the indirect effect 
of 
symbolic  reputation  on  proﬁ tability 
through  performance  reputation.  In  Hy-
pothesis   6   and  Hypothesis   7 ,  we  expected 
non-signiﬁ cant effects from symbolic repu-
tation to corporate proﬁ tability. Given these 
expectations, it is reasonable to test whether 
symbolic reputation would have an indirect 
effect on proﬁ tability by also enhancing the 
corporation ’ s reputation for performance.

 Symbolic or Behavioral Management? 

  H 12   :    There is a signiﬁ cant indirect effect of sym-
bolic  reputation  on  corporate  proﬁ tability 
via performance reputation (path i  ×  g).  

 Despite  the  plausibility  of  Hypothesis   12 , 
based  on  Fombrun  and  Shanley ’ s  (1990) 
ﬁ ndings,  we  anticipate  that  Hypothesis   12  
will not be supported.    

 METHOD  

 Sample  
 To  gain  an  understanding  of  the  potential 
differential impact of symbolic and behavio-
ral management variables, we chose to base 
our initial sample frame selection on an issue 
of both operational and reputational impor-
tance  for  US  manufacturing  companies: 
chemical pollution ( Christmann, 2000 ). Our 
study initially included the 19 primary man-
ufacturing industries based on two-digit SIC 
(ie, SIC 20-Food Products through SIC 38-
Instruments)  reporting  to  the  federal  Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency ’ s (EPA) Toxics 
Release Inventory (TRI) between 1991 and 
1995.  This  timeframe  was  chosen  because 
US manufacturing companies were required 
to  begin  reporting  toxic  emissions  of  over 
300 chemicals beginning in 1988 ( Ofﬁ ce of 
Pollution  Prevention  and  Toxics,  1995 )  to 
the TRI. Sampling the companies ’  reporting 
a  few  years  after  the  introduction  of TRI 
reporting  allowed  for  considerable  stand-
ardization of EPA reporting processes to help 
ensure  reliability  of  the  data. An  additional 
beneﬁ t of studying this timeframe is broad-
er  variability  in  pollution  prevention  prac-
tices  (ie,  behavioral  management  actions) 
before companies moved down the learning 
curve in later years towards a smaller set of 
pollution  prevention  activities  in  manufac-
turing ( TRI Program Division, 2005 ). 

 Further  examination  of  the TRI  records 
for our sample frame indicated that only 30 
chemicals out of the more than 300 report-
ed  accounted  for  92  percent  of  the  total 

volume  of  hazard-weighted  emissions  for 
these corporations between 1991 and 1995. 
Our  calculation  of  the  hazard-weighted 
emissions  amount  began  with  aggregating 
the  volume  (lbs.)  of  pollution  reported  by 
manufacturing  facilities  for  each  manufac-
turing  corporation. This  aggregate  volume 
was  then  weighted  by  each  chemical ’ s  hu-
man and environmental health hazard value 
( Davis  et al ., 1994 ) because ﬁ rms often pri-
oritize  their  pollution  abatement  actions 
based on the overall hazard-potential posed 
by  chemicals  ( Hart  and Ahuja,  1996 ). After 
screening  for  these  top  30  toxic  chemicals 
and  the  availability  of  complete TRI  data, 
our initial sample included 236 corporations 
in  19  different  industries,  based  on  two-
digit SIC codes. Given that we were inter-
ested in ensuring that chemical pollution was 
a factor inﬂ uencing both symbolic and be-
havioral  alignment  efforts,  we  decided  to 
retain the top ﬁ ve industries in terms of haz-
ard-weighted volume of chemical pollution. 
As  a  result,  we  removed  39  corporations 
from  the  initial  sample  frame.  In  the  next 
sampling step, we excluded an additional 65 
corporations due to lack of data on all our 
other measures. 

 As  a  result,  our  sample  for  the  analysis 
comprised 132 corporations in the following 
ﬁ ve  manufacturing  industries:  Paper  prod-
ucts  (SIC  26),  Chemicals  (SIC  28),  Petro-
leum and coal (SIC 29), Primary metals (SIC 
33) and Transportation equipment (SIC 37). 
These ﬁ ve industries are historically some of 
the highest emitters of toxic chemicals and 
member  ﬁ rms  have  made  considerable  in-
vestments  in  pollution-prevention  practices 
( TRI Program Division, 2005 ). This sample 
of ﬁ rms will also likely have engaged in sym-
bolic management activities to enhance their 
environmental  reputations.  Table  1   provides 
some descriptive statistics on our sample. 

 In  order  to  address  a  possible  sampling 
bias  concern,  we  ran   t -tests  between  the 
group  of  ﬁ rms  included  ( N     =    132)  in  our 
analysis  and  the  group  of  ﬁ rms  excluded

        a Statistics based on the 132 ﬁ rms in the sample.   
        b Among excluded industries, the fabricated metal products industry (SIC 34) has the average volume of pollution 
released of 1,201,768   lb. during 1991 – 1995 periods and the instruments and other related products industry (SIC 
38) has the average volume of pollution released of 8,921,725   lb. during 1991 – 1995 period.   

( n     =    104)  from  our  ﬁ nal  sample. We  com-
pared these two groups across three variables 
(total  number  of  employees,  total  sales 
and  total  number  of  facilities  emitting 
toxic chemicals) describing important char-
acteristics  of  the  ﬁ rms  and  found  no  sig-
niﬁ cant  mean  difference  ( t     =        −    1.360  and 
 p     =    0.175,  t     =        −    1.250 and  p     =    0.213,  t     =    1.504 
and   p     =    0.134,  respectively).  This  provides 
support  for  the  representativeness  of  our 
ﬁ nal  sample  of  the  initial  sample  frame  of 
ﬁ rms ( Table 2 )  .   

 Measures  

 Financial performance 
 Prior  proﬁ tability  was  measured  with  the 
average annual ROA and earnings-per-share 
(EPS)  between  1991  and  1993  in  order  to 
control  for  its  inﬂ uence  on  the  outcome 
measure of ﬁ nancial performance. These ra-
tio data were collected from COMPUSTAT. 
In order to minimize the possible confound-
ing  effects  of  industry  type,  an  industry-
standardized  ROA  (within  two-digit-SIC) 
was generated by calculating the  Z  score of 
each ﬁ rm ’ s ROA within the industry (two-
digit SIC based). 

 The outcome ﬁ nancial performance var-
iable,  proﬁ tability,  was  measured  with  two 

accounting  indices,  ROA  and  EPS  for  two 
years  (1994 – 1995).  In  order  to  control  for 
industry  effect,  both  ROA  and  EPS  were 
standardized  within  industries  (two-digit-
SIC  level). Therefore,  we  used   Z   scores  of 
ROA and EPS to measure proﬁ tability. EPS 
ratio  data  were  collected  from  COMPUS-
TAT as well.   

 Environmental performance 
 Environmental performance is important for 
many manufacturing ﬁ rms (eg,  Nehrt, 1996 ) 
and, therefore, can be a representative meas-
ure  of  the  core  behavioral  management 
approach. Given the importance of environ-
mental  performance  in  manufacturing,  we 
selected those highly polluting industries for 
which chemical hazards are a primary nega-
tive  ‘ consequence ’  to stakeholders and soci-
ety.  It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  ﬁ rms 
in  our  sample  engaged  in  varying  levels  of 
environmental  management  efforts  to  ad-
dress  this  performance  issue  and  that  this 
measure  reﬂ ects  an  important  behavioral 
management antecedent. 

 This measure was calculated in two steps. 
First,  the  total  annual  hazard-weighted  vol-
ume  (000  lbs.)  of  the  30  TRI  chemicals 
retained during the sample selection process 
for  each  ﬁ rm  was  computed  between  1991

and 1994. Next, this hazard-weighted volume 
was divided by annual sales ( $ 000) to control 
for size. Consequently, the lower the value of 
this  measure,  the  higher  the  environmental 
performance (ie, the lower the volume of haz-
ardous emissions per dollar of sales, the better 
the ﬁ rm was performing environmentally).   

 Impression management 
 This symbolic reputation-building anteced-
ent  is  reﬂ ected  in  the  form  of  visible  en-
deavors  of  the  corporate  public  relations 
department.  Impression  management  was 
measured  by  the  total  number  of  articles 
released  by  a  company  through  the  Press 
Release Newswire (PRN), a corporate com-
munications  service  commonly  used  to  re-
lease  new  information  about  company  ac-
tions,  decisions  and  policies. This  is  similar 
to  the  measure  employed  by   Bansal  and 
Clelland  (2004)   to  measure  corporate  im-
pression management. We searched for arti-
cles using the same environmental keywords 
and  timeframe  as  the  articles  pertaining  to 
the  ﬁ rm ’ s  symbolic  reputation. We  only  in-
cluded press releases issued by the ﬁ rm and 
not  by  other  agencies  such  as  the  US  EPA. 
The  ﬁ nal  measure  was  a  ratio  of  the  total 
number  of  positive  connotation  articles  di-
vided by the total number of articles released 
from PRN between 1991 and 1993.   

 Symbolic reputation for environment 
 This is one of the two corporate-level repu-
tation  measures  we  adopted  in  this  study. 
Following the methods used by  Bansal and 
Clelland  (2004) ,  we  only  used  articles  pro-
duced  by   The Wall  Street  Journal   because  of 
its national coverage and to avoid the con-
founding of multiple sources. Full text arti-
cles published between 1991 and 1993 were 
extracted electronically using the company ’ s 
name and one or more of the following key-
words:   ‘ environmental ’ ,   ‘ toxic ’ ,   ‘ pollution ’ , 
and   ‘ Superfund ’ .  A  total  of  1,042  relevant 
articles were identiﬁ ed and each was coded 
by  one  of  the  researchers  and  a  graduate

assistant for whether its impact on the ﬁ rm ’ s 
environmental reputation was neutral, negative 
or positive (0    =     ‘ neutral ’ , 1    =     ‘ negative ’ , 2    =     ‘ pos-
itive ’ ).  Neutral  articles  were  dropped  as  they 
would have little or no inﬂ uence on a com-
pany ’ s environmental media reputation. 

 Corporate  media  reputation  was  meas-
ured  by  calculating  the  Janis – Fadner  coef-
ﬁ cient by using articles appearing in  The Wall 
Street  Journal   released  in  the  given  years 
(1991 – 1993).  The  Janis – Fadner  coefﬁ cient 
was calculated as follows: 

   

(e2– ec)/(t2) if e > c, 
(ec – c2)/(t2) if c > e,  

0 if e = c

  
 where  e  is the annual total of positively ori-
ented articles and  c  the annual total of neg-
atively oriented articles and  t     =     e     +     c    

 Performance reputation 
 For  manufacturing  ﬁ rms,  a  reputation  re-
garding environmental decisions and actions 
can represent a factor of strategic importance 
to  management  and  future  earnings  valua-
tion  by  the  investment  community  ( Bansal 
and  Clelland,  2004 ).  As  such,  it  is  poten-
tially  inﬂ uential  to  the  overall  reputational 
capital ( Fombrun, 1996 ) of these ﬁ rms. Both 
equity and asset-based proxies can be calcu-
lated for reputational capital, but given that 
environmental performance is most affected 
by a company ’ s investment in pollution-re-
ducing  equipment  and  processes  ( Nehrt, 
1996 ), we calculated an asset-based  ‘ market-
to-book ratio ’  as a proxy measure of corpo-
rate  performance  reputation.  The  formula 
for this ratio is [(End of Year Price per share 
 ×   Number  of  outstanding  shares)      +      Book 
Value of Debt] / (Total Assets)]. The data for 
this variable were collected from COMPU-
STAT for the years 1991 – 1993.    

 Analysis 
 We use structural equation modeling (SEM) 
using the EQS6.1 software to test the con-

ceptual relationships proposed in Hypotheses 
 1  –  12 . One special feature of SEM is the abil-
ity  to  test  direct  and  indirect  relationships 
while  controlling  for  all  other  relationships 
( Bollen,  1989 ;   Byrne,  1994 ).  Our  core 
research aim is to evaluate the relative con-
tributions  between  two  rival  reputation-
building  approaches.  Thus,  SEM  is  well 
suited  because  it  allows  us  to  nest  both 
approaches  in  the  same  structural  model 
where multiple regression analysis could not. 
We  used  maximum  likelihood  estimation 
with raw data ( Bentler, 2004 ;  Bollen, 1989 ). 
The viability of the hypothesized model was 
tested  by    ♻   2 ,  Comparative  Fit  Index  (CFI), 
Standardized  Root  Mean  Square  Residual 
(SRMR)  and  Root  Mean  Square  Error  of 
Approximation  (RMSEA). We  use  Hu  and 
Bentler ’ s (1999) joint-criteria to test model 
viability  in  combination  with  the  absolute 
ﬁ t  index  of    ♻   2 .  For    ♻   2 ,  a  nonsigniﬁ cant 
value indicates a viable model. In the joint-
criteria approach ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ), a 
model is considered viable when it has CFI 
艋0.96  and  SRMR艋0.10, or RMSEA艋0.06 
 and  SRMR艋0.10. If the  a priori  model meets 
the  criteria  for  global  model  ﬁ t  testing,  we 
can  proceed  to  interpreting  the  individual 
hypotheses.    

 RESULTS  

 Model Testing 
 We developed an  a priori  conceptual baseline 
model (the solid-line paths in  Figure 2 ) that 
represented our theoretical predictions. Our 
initial  model  would  not  converge  so  we 
added some error covariances by ﬁ rst analyz-
ing modiﬁ cation indices and then evaluating 
the  theoretical  consistency  ( Bollen,  1989 ; 
 Byrne,  1994 ).  We  also  encountered  the 
model  non-convergence  issue  with  all   t     −    1 
latent variables in 1991 – 1993. Consequently, 
we  identiﬁ ed  the  most  troubling  indicator 
measure by iterating omission of one meas-
ure  at  a  time. We  found  ZEPS  1993  (prior 
proﬁ tability)  and  RPCA  1992  (corporate

performance reputation) were the sources of 
the  non-convergence  problem.  We  then 
deleted  ZEPS  93  and  RPCA  92  from  the 
measurement models to resolve this conver-
gence problem. We found the baseline mod-
el  subsequently  converged  well,  and  it 
achieved a good ﬁ t for model interpretation. 
According to Hu and Bentler ’ s (1999) joint-
criteria,  our  ﬁ nal  model  with  added  error 
covariances  resulted  in  a  good  ﬁ t  with  the 
data:   ♻   2  (151,  N     =    132)    =    157.361,  p     =    0.345, 
CFI    =    0.996,  SRMR    =    0.065  and  RM-
SEA    =    0.018 (0.000, 0.045). Thus, we inter-
preted  the  parameters  estimated  to  test 
hypotheses in the ﬁ nal model (see  Figure 3 ) 
and  used  the  new  baseline  model  to  test 
three additional nested models and three al-
ternative models. 

 We  summarize  the  models  we  tested  in 
 Table 3  and the parameter estimates for our 
measures in  Table 4 .   

 Hypotheses Testing 
 Our ﬁ rst research proposition addressed the 
effectiveness  of  symbolic  and  behavioral 
approaches in their relations to symbolic and 
performance  reputations  and  was  reﬂ ected 
in  the  predictions  of  Hypotheses   1  –  5 .  Hy-
pothesis   1   tests  the  effectiveness  of  impres-
sion  management  to  symbolic  reputation 
and  it  was  supported  (  ♢      =    0.806,   p     <    0.001). 
Hypothesis  2  tested whether there was some 
effect  of  impression  management  on  per-
formance reputation.  The nested model test-
ing shows no such effect (  ♢      =        −    0.041): that 
is,  ☭    ♻   2     =    0.032 with  ☭  df    =    1 (see  Table 3 ). 
 We  found  support  for  Hypothesis   3  
(  ♢      =        −    0.106,   p     <    0.05)  and  Hypothesis   5  
(  ♢      =    0.624,   p     <    0.001).  Thus,  these  results 
supported our predictions that the behavio-
ral management approach is a more effective 
way to build a performance reputation than 
by symbolic management efforts. Regarding

 Kim, Bach and Clelland 

Hypothesis  4 , we conducted a nested mod-
el test between the baseline model and the 
comparison model with the added path from 
prior  environmental  performance  to  sym-
bolic reputation (see  Table 3 ). For Hypoth-
esis   4 ,  we  found  no  signiﬁ cant  difference 
between the two models: that is,  ☭    ♻   2      =    0.120 
with   ☭   df    =    1. Thus,  Hypothesis   4   was  not 
supported,  as  we  expected  (  ♢      =    0.037). This 
suggests that impression management repre-
sented  through  increasing  media  publicity 
has  a  strong  effect  on  symbolic  reputation, 
whereas environmental performance has no 
direct impact on symbolic reputation. 

 In Hypotheses  6  –  12 , we analyzed our sec-
ond  research  proposition  about  how  effec-
tively  two  different  types  of  reputations 
might  enhance  corporate  proﬁ tability.  Hy-
pothesis   6   and  Hypothesis   7   test  the  effect 
of  impression  management  on  symbolic 
reputation  and  of  symbolic  reputation  on 

corporate  proﬁ tability.  Using  nested  model 
testing, we found no support for Hypothesis 
 6   (  ♢      =    0.086):  that  is,   ☭     ♻   2     =    1.494  with   ☭  
 df     =    1  (see  Table  3 ). Also ,   Hypothesis   7   was 
not supported by the Sobel test for media-
tion  effect  ( p     =    0.334),  which  allows  testing 
of  whether  the  indirect  effect  of  an  inde-
pendent variable on a dependent variable via 
the  mediator  is  signiﬁ cantly  different  from 
zero ( MacKinnon  et al ., 2002 ;  Sobel, 1982 ). 
Thus, our current data rejected the positive 
indirect effect hypothesis of prior impression 
management on corporate proﬁ tability when 
mediated by symbolic reputation. In contrast, 
Hypothesis   8   tests  the  alternative  explana-
tion that corporate performance reputation 
has a direct effect on proﬁ tability. Data sup-
ported  Hypothesis 
 8 ,  as  we  predicted 
(  ♢      =    0.303,  p     <    0.05). 

 Hypothesis  9  and Hypothesis  10  test the 
indirect  effects  of  prior  environmental  and

formance  (eg,  proﬁ tability). The  data  sup-
ported  the  overall  conceptual  model  pre-
sented in  Figures 1 and 2 , with the exception 
of Hypothesis  9 . With regard to the compo-
nent  relationships,  the  data  ﬁ rst  indicated 
that the greater the endeavors in impression 
management, the higher the symbolic repu-
tation  (Hypothesis   1 ),  as  hypothesized.  As 
we  counter-intuitively  hypothesized,  there 
was, however, no signiﬁ cant relationship be-
tween  impression  management  and  per-
formance  reputation  (Hypothesis   2 ).  Also, 
environmental  performance  did  not  have  a 
signiﬁ cant  effect  on  symbolic  reputation 
(Hypothesis  4 ). This latter result has implica-
tions  related  to  prior  research  on  environ-
mental performance and symbolic reputation. 
 Hamilton  (1995)    examined  outcomes  of 
pollution  level  announcements  by  the  EPA 
at  the  level  of  individual  ﬁ rms.  A  positive 
relationship was supported between a ﬁ rm ’ s 
pollution level (TRI emissions) as announced 
by the EPA and the frequency of reports in 
 The Wall  Street  Journal .  Hamilton,  however, 
used TRI data from the second year of EPA 
announcements  when  knowledge  of  TRI 
was quite new to both the mass media and 
investors.  In  addition,  ﬁ rms  had  just  begun 
to implement actions in waste minimization 
in response to this  ‘ green report card ’ . Our 
later  data  window  is  more  reﬂ ective  of  a 
period  of  time  when  preventive  environ-
mental  practices  had  been  more  broadly 
adopted  by  manufacturing  ﬁ rms.  Thus,  as 
TRI  emission  levels  were  being  addressed, 
investors  and  journalists  began  to  look  at 
TRI announcements more as a benchmark 
report  than  as  news  of  signiﬁ cant  opera-
tional problems. This has progressed to such 
an extent that it is difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd mass me-
dia  stories  about  the  EPA TRI  announce-
ments in recent years. 

 Thus,  the  absence  of  a  relationship  be-
tween  environmental  performance  and 
symbolic  reputation  in  our  study  suggests 
that as ﬁ rms adopt practices to improve en-
vironmental  performance,  external  strategic 

indirect  effect  of  symbolic  reputation  on

tion.  Data  failed  to  support  Hypothesis   12  
(Sobel test,  p     =    0.310), as we expected.  

reputation 

from  performance 

 In summary, our data support all the hy-
potheses we predicted except Hypothesis  9 , 
the  indirect  effect  of  prior  environmental 
performance  on  proﬁ tability  through  per-
formance  reputation  (see   Figure  3 ).  Our 
ﬁ ndings suggest the relative effectiveness of 
the behavioral reputation-building approach. 
One might, however, argue a reverse causal 
logic 
to 
symbolic reputation and from symbolic rep-
utation  to  proﬁ tability.  Hence,  we  derived 
alternative models (see  Figures 4, 5, and 6 ). 
For  these  alternative  models,  we  could  not 
conduct  nested  model  testing  against  the 
baseline model because of a model conver-
gence  issue  (see  Table  3 ). Yet,  we  reached  a 
reasonably  good  ﬁ t  and  thus  can  interpret 
the  structural  paths  that  interested  us. The 
path  estimates  suggest  that  there  is  no  sig-
niﬁ cant  mediation  effect  of  performance 
reputation on proﬁ tability via symbolic rep-
utation. Thus,  we  interpret  this  ﬁ nding  as 
suggesting  the  ineffectiveness  of  the  sym-
bolic  reputation-building  approach  on  cor-
porate proﬁ tability. 

 Also, we tested the direct effect from pri-
or  proﬁ tability  to  symbolic  reputation.  Past 
studies 
( Hammond  and  Slocum,  1996 ; 
 McGuire   et  al .,  1990 )  have  suggested  such 
an effect. We, however, found no direct effect. 
Finally,  prior  research  has  also  found  that 
environmental performance can directly in-
ﬂ uence  proﬁ tability  (eg,  Russo  and  Fouts, 
1997).  Hence,  we  additionally  tested  the 
direct  effect  of  prior  environmental  per-
formance  on  proﬁ tability. Again,  we  found 
no direct effect.

rate reputation and the relative contribution 
of each approach to corporate ﬁ nancial per-

publics  shift  their  attention  from  symbolic 
reputation to performance reputation. Sym-
bolic  reputation  can  be  important  initially 
because it may provide a motivational trigger 
for action, but if the ﬁ rm makes progress in 
enhancing environmental performance, it is 
likely  that  performance  metrics  will  be 
developed and attended to more closely by 
strategic  publics  than  by  media  accounts. 
This also suggests that once a strategic pub-
lic ’ s  attention  has  been  shifted  in  this  way, 
impression  management  efforts  on  these 
particular activities become less inﬂ uential. 
 These results are interesting because they 
demonstrate  that  there  are  at  least  two 
different  approaches  to  building  a  corpora-
tion ’ s  overall  reputation. The  results  of  this 
study  strongly  imply  that  impression  man-
agement  efforts  do  not  solely  determine  a 
corporation ’ s  overall  reputation.  Our  ﬁ nd-
ings  suggest  that  a  corporation  would  be 
well-advised to devote its capabilities to im-
proving  corporate  performances  through 
operational innovation and efﬁ ciency, mana-
gerial  policy  development  and  stakeholder 

management efforts ( Post  et al ., 2002 ;  Rob-
erts and Dowling, 2002 ) instead. This behav-
ioral  management  path  toward  creating  a 
reputation  for  performance  was  statistically 
supported  in  our  study  (Hypotheses   3   and 
 5 ). These  results  provided  further  empirical 
evidence  for  Wood’s  (1991)   model  of  cor-
porate social performance by demonstrating 
that  corporate  social   responsibility   (eg,  sym-
bolic  management)  is  insufﬁ cient  and  re-
quires additional operational and observable 
outcomes in the form of social  responsiveness  
(eg,  environmental  and  ﬁ nancial  perform-
ance)  to  satisfactorily  convince  external 
stakeholder groups. 

 This study showed neither direct nor in-
direct effects of symbolic reputation on cor-
porate  proﬁ tability  (Hypothesis   6   and   7 ). 
The results implied that symbolic reputation 
does  not  signiﬁ cantly  contribute  to  corpo-
rate  proﬁ tability.  We  will  revisit  this  issue 
later. With  Hypotheses   8  –  10 ,  we  redirected 
our attention to the direct effect of perform-
ance  reputation  on  proﬁ tability  and  the 
relative  effectiveness  of  behavioral  manage-

ment efforts on proﬁ tability as mediated by 
performance  reputation.  The  SEM  model 
supported  the  notion  that  the  higher  the 
level of performance reputation, the higher 
the level of corporate proﬁ tability (Hypoth-
esis  8 ). The results, however, did not support 
the indirect effect from prior environmental 
performance to proﬁ tability via performance 
reputation (Hypothesis  9 ), although the So-
bel test for this mediation effect was nearly 
at a statistically signiﬁ cant level ( p     =    0.127). 
 We also found a signiﬁ cant mediation ef-
fect  from  prior  proﬁ tability  to  proﬁ tability 
through  performance  reputation  (Hypoth-
esis   10 ).  This  is  congruent  with  calls  for 
controlling  for  prior  proﬁ tability  when  ex-
amining  the  effects  of  corporate  reputation 
on  current  or  future  ﬁ nancial  performance 
(eg,   Fryxell  and Wang,  1994 ). We  tested  a 
direct effect from prior proﬁ tability to cur-
rent  proﬁ tability  and  the  results  supported 
this prediction (Hypothesis  11 ). We consid-
ered  past  ﬁ nancial  performance  as  a  proxy 
variable for good or poor managerial efforts 
in  corporate  wealth  creation.  For  instance, 
creative managerial endeavors and innovative 
managerial  practices  can  directly  enhance 
proﬁ tability but not necessarily through cor-
porate reputations. 

 Finally,  we  tested  the  possible  mediating 
effect  of  symbolic  reputation  on  proﬁ tabil-
ity  through  performance  reputation  (Hy-
pothesis  12 ). We tested the indirect effect and 
the Sobel ’ s test indicated no signiﬁ cant effect 
of  symbolic  reputation  on  proﬁ tability. 
Therefore, these results implicitly supported 
our initial position that corporate perform-
ance  reputation  is  a  more  substantial  con-
tributor 
than 
symbolic  reputation.  Management  actions 
cover  a  wide  range  of  activities  including 
both  impression  management  activities  and 
implementation  of  practices  to  improve 
environmental  performance. 
 Bansal  and 
Clelland  (2004)   examined  the  moderating 
role  of  impression  management  (press  re-
leases) on the relationship between corporate 

to  corporate  proﬁ tability 

environmental  legitimacy  (media  accounts) 
and  ﬁ nancial  performance  (unsystematic 
risk). We, on the other hand, examined the 
mediation  role  of  symbolic  reputation  be-
tween impression management and ﬁ nancial 
performance. Our results are congruent with 
 Bansal and Clelland’s (2004)  in that environ-
mental  legitimacy  (environmental  aspect  in 
performance reputation) is predicted by en-
vironmental performance. 

found 

 An  additional  contribution  of  our  study 
to  Bansal and Clelland’s (2004)  is that it fur-
ther  separates  management  actions  related 
to  impression  management  from  those  re-
lated to environmental performance.  Bansal 
and  Clelland  (2004)  
that  ﬁ rms 
with low environmental legitimacy may ac-
tually increase their unsystematic risk (nega-
tive ﬁ nancial outcome) because investors no 
longer  trust  their  impression  management 
efforts.  Our  study  suggests  that  symbolic 
reputation, as created by impression manage-
ment  efforts,  has  far  less  inﬂ uence  on  the 
positive  ﬁ nancial  outcome  of  proﬁ tability. 
It may be the case that not only do ﬁ nancial 
strategic  publics  not  trust  impression  man-
agement  efforts,  they  may  also  be  able  to 
cognitively  separate  that  information  from 
their assessments of other antecedents of ﬁ -
nancial performance such as actual environ-
mental performance. 

 The ﬁ ndings of this study suggest a reas-
sessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  sym-
bolic  management  approach  to  reputation 
building. There  is  no  doubt  that  by  high-
lighting positive characteristics and by neu-
tralizing  negative  news,  a  good  symbolic 
reputation  can  be  established.  However, 
as  scholars  from  public  relations  are  well 
aware, there are concerns with the long-term 
effectiveness  of  this  approach  and  there  are 
also  ethical  concerns  about  the  unilateral 
manipulation  of  stakeholder  perceptions 
( Grunig,  2003 ).  Still,  given  these  concerns, 
there  are  beneﬁ ts  to  the  symbolic  manage-
ment  approach.  For  instance,  as   Bansal 
and  Clelland  (2004)   have  noted,  symbolic

reputation  building  may   ‘ buy ’   time  in  the 
short term and provide the possible survival 
buffer  of  organizational  legitimacy  in  the 
long term. 

 In  the  end,  however,  our  results  suggest 
that  corporations  should  direct  their  capa-
bilities to building a behavioral management 
approach  that  emphasizes  strategic  choices 
and  proactive  implementation  of  perform-
ance  improvement  choices.  In  other  words, 
by emphasizing operational processes, inno-
vative capabilities and proactive strategies, a 
corporation directly and indirectly enhances 
its performance reputation and ﬁ nancial out-
comes.  In  the  process,  symbolic  reputation 
may play a catalytic and complementary role 
to reinforce the effect. 

 Our ﬁ ndings do not undervalue the im-
portance  of  the  symbolic  management  ap-
proach  to  reputation  building.  Instead,  we 
suggest that corporate policy makers should 
reconsider its role. This should not limit the 
symbolic approach in reputation building to 
disseminating  positive  news  through  media 
or  neutralizing  negative  news.  Symbolic 
management should also include the areas of 
collecting and informing various stakehold-
ers  about  emerging  concerns  and  commu-
nicating  critical  information  to  improve 
operationally related decisions (eg, regarding 
pollution-prevention  practices).  This,  of 
course, would require obtaining the support 
of  top  management  for  this  redeﬁ ned  role 
to be effective. 

 If  we  extend  our  prescriptions  to  policy 
makers, top management should review and 
reformulate  their  communication  depart-
ments to play the role of strategic counselor 
rather  than  simply  act  as  a  disseminator  of 
positive news to publics. This redeﬁ ned role 
will be more likely to lead to an enhanced 
performance  reputation  and  proﬁ tability. 
Furthermore, in light of the results for Hy-
pothesis  12 , further research might contrast 
the effectiveness of communications depart-
ments categorized as either a strategic coun-
selors or disseminators of communications. 

  Fombrun (2005)  noted the evolving em-
phasis  on  socially  responsible  corporate 
actions in support of stakeholder norm ad-
herence. We  believe  our  ﬁ ndings  echo  this 
observation  in  that  our  study  showed  the 
relative  importance  of  behavioral  manage-
ment,  which  emphasizes  business  and 
operational  fundamentals  such  as  environ-
mental performance over simple impression 
management.  Taken  together,  our  ﬁ ndings 
also reinforce what public relations research-
ers ( Grunig, 1992, 2003, 2006 ;  Grunig  et al ., 
2002 )  have  found  concerning  the  impor-
tance of substantial  action  ( behavioral manage-
ment ) rather than well-phrased  rhetoric  ( sym-
bolic management ). Rhetoric, of course, is less 
costly  in  the  short  term  and  may  enable 
companies to temporarily postpone the bur-
dens  of  fundamental  improvements  in  re-
sponse to stakeholders, but it is likely to be 
more costly in the long term if the corpora-
tion  delays  addressing  actual  problems  (eg, 
toxic emissions). 

 As  we  articulated  earlier,  this  study  had 
some  methodological  and  analytical  limita-
tions. First of all, while our study proposed 
and examined an integrative model, the gen-
eralization  of  research  ﬁ ndings  should  be 
conservative  because  of  sample  constraints. 
We used convenience sampling and targeted 
ﬁ ve highly polluting industries. Partially due 
to this targeted sampling process, there was 
signiﬁ cant difference in the amounts of haz-
ard-weighted  release  between  samples  in-
cluded  in  the  study  ( n     =    104)  and  samples 
excluded  from  the  study  ( n     =    132).  For  this 
reason,  our  data  may  not  fully  represent  all 
other  industries,  particularly  service  indus-
tries. Consequently, we should be very con-
servative in attempting to apply our ﬁ ndings 
to  less-polluting  industries  because  of  the 
limited  generalizability  of  this  study.  In  ad-
dition,  by  modeling  antecedent  constructs 
for corporate reputation, we only used two 
constructs, impression management and en-
vironmental  performance,  with  a  control 
construct  of  prior  performance.  For  this

reason, our research design does not exhaus-
tively represent a causal model of corporate 
reputation-building.  In  the  future,  a  more 
comprehensive model with other exogenous 
variables should be considered to explore a 
more complete process of corporate reputa-
tion-building. 

 Another limitation comes from the pow-
er of the test and the sample size ( N     =    132). 
We  found  a  non-signiﬁ cant  effect  of  sym-
bolic reputation on performance reputation. 
With a larger sample size, we suspect there 
is a higher likelihood of supporting the hy-
pothesized  effect.  Taken  together,  our  re-
search is congruent with  Deephouse’s (2000)  
ﬁ nding  of  a  marginal  but  positive  effect  of 
media reputation on corporate ﬁ nancial per-
formance. 

 A  ﬁ nal  limitation  may  have  been  our 
measurement  of  performance  reputation, 
which may have been inﬂ uenced by factors 
not included in the study ’ s structural model, 
such as industry-level capital availability and 
ﬁ rm-level research and development and ad-
vertising  expenses.  The  availability  of  data 
limited  our  choice  of  additional  variables 
and  their  operationalization.  Current  re-
search employing the Reputation Quotient 
( Brady, 2005 ;  Bromley, 2002 ) could likely ad-
dress one of these limitations. 

 While  we  have  some  obvious  research 
limitations above, we framed and examined 
a process that provides a better understand-
ing  of  reputation-building  for  research  and 
practice.  By  empirically  demonstrating  the 
relationships  among  symbolic  management, 
behavioral management, dimensions of cor-
porate reputation and corporate proﬁ tability, 
this  study  made  several  contributions  to 
reputation  research.  First,  we  found  that 
there are multiple routes and dimensions in 
corporate  reputation  building,  which  have 
various effects on corporate proﬁ tability  –  a 
central concern of reputation studies ( Rindo-
va   et  al .,  2005 ).  Secondly,  this  study  incor-
porated  a  temporal  dimension  by  adding 
time-lagged  variables  within 
the  SEM. 

Thirdly, our study supported earlier research 
( Bansal and Clelland, 2004 ;  Salama, 2003 ) by 
examining  the  direct  inﬂ uence  of  environ-
mental performance on performance reputa-
tion  and  an  indirect  inﬂ uence  on  ﬁ nancial 
performance in manufacturing ﬁ rms. It ap-
pears  that  responsiveness  in  terms  of  actual 
changes  in  environmental  practices  by  cor-
porations can result both in an enhancement 
of  the  strategic  public ’ s  perceptions  of  the 
corporation  and  in  an  enhancement  of  ﬁ -
nancial  outcomes.  This  certainly  provides 
evidence  for  a  ‘ sustainability  effect ’   (Brady, 
2006)  by  enhancing  reputational  advantage 
with  the  proactive  behavioral  management 
of environmental practices. 

 Finally,  some  of  our  ﬁ ndings  share  evi-
dence  with  the   ‘ symbolic  and  substantive 
management ’   in  organizational  legitimacy 
research ( Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990 ;  Pfeffer, 
1981 ).  For  instance,   Ashforth  and  Gibbs 
(1990)   proposed  that  ‘ protesting  too  much ’  
via symbolic management can cause percep-
tions among organizational constituents that 
one is an  ‘ overacting actor ’  (ie,  ‘ perceived to 
overstate  claims  to  legitimacy  or  overreact 
to  faults ’ :  177).  Future  studies  should  con-
sider the similarities and differences between 
public relations and organization study as we 
develop greater interdisciplinary research on 
reputation.

proaches in reputation-building are concepts devel-
oped  from  the  public  relations  literature,  they  are 
similar  to  symbolic  and  substantive  management 
concepts  in  organization  studies  ( Ashforth  and 
Gibbs, 1990 ;  Pfeffer, 1981 ).

  3       Social scientists have some fear or  ‘ prejudice ’  against 
posing  and  testing  null  hypotheses  ( Cortina  and 
Folger,  1998:  335 ).   Greenwald  (1993)   called  such 
fear  and  prejudice  a   ‘ cultural  truism ’   and  he 
 ‘ dismantled ’   opinions  against  testing  the  null 
hypothesis. In defending the practice of posing and 
testing null hypotheses,  Cortina and Folger (1998)  
further  explained  that  null  hypothesis  testing  is 
appropriate when (1)  ‘ predicting a null effect as a 
derivation  from  theory ’   in  advance   –   ie,   a  priori  
hypothesis  derivation  and  (2)  establishing  bound-
ary  conditions  for  known  effects   –   ie,  design  and 
test  when  signiﬁ cant  effect  can  be  found.  In  our 
study, we met the two essential conditions for null 
hypothesis testing. First, we postulate in advance  a 
priori   hypotheses  regarding  the  ineffective  paths 
from  symbolic  management  to  ﬁ nancial  perform-
ance. In addition, we proposed and tested signiﬁ cant 
alternative hypotheses (ie, known effects) regarding 
the  paths  in  behavioral  management  approach 
against  the  null  hypotheses  in  the  same  testing 
model. Thus, we consider our null hypothesis test-
ing approach justiﬁ able.
