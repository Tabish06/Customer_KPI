We used data collected from a ﬁeld survey of 334 supervisor–subordinate
dyads to test a model of the antecedents of abusive supervision. Path an-
alytic tests of moderated mediation provided support for our prediction
that supervisors’ depression mediates the relationship between supervi-
sors’ procedural justice and subordinates’ perceptions of their supervi-
sors’ abusiveness and that the mediation framework is stronger when
subordinates are higher in negative affectivity. We discuss the study’s
implications for theory, research, and practice.

An emerging stream of organizational research focuses on behaviors
that may be referred to as deviant (Robinson & Bennett, 1995), antisocial
(Giacalone & Greenberg, 1997), or counterproductive (Fox, Spector, &
Miles, 2001), and that include things like theft, sabotage, and incivility. For
the most part, research on negative workplace behaviors has emphasized
actions committed by rank-and-ﬁle employees with relatively little atten-
tion being paid to detrimental behaviors committed by those employed
in a managerial capacity (Hoel, Rayner, & Cooper, 1999). A notable ex-
ception is recent work that focuses on abusive supervision, “subordinates’
perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained
display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors, excluding physical con-
tact” (Tepper, 2000, p. 178). Examples of behaviors that fall within the
domain of abusive supervision include public ridicule, invasion of privacy,
taking undue credit, inappropriately assigning blame, and rudeness.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

In recent studies, researchers have explored the consequences of abu-
sive supervision. These studies suggest that, compared to their nonabused
counterparts, subordinates who perceive that their supervisors are more
abusive are less satisﬁed with their jobs, less committed to their organi-
zation, less trusting of their coworkers, more psychologically distressed,
more resistant to their supervisors’ inﬂuence attempts, and less willing to
perform prosocial organizational behaviors (Ashforth, 1997; Bies, 1999;
Duffy, Ganster, & Pagon, 2002; Keashly, Trott, & MacLean, 1994; Tepper,
2000; Tepper, Duffy, Hoobler, & Ensley, 2004; Tepper, Duffy, & Shaw,
2001; Zellars, Tepper, & Duffy, 2002).

These deleterious consequences underscore the need for theory and
research that can help organizations predict subordinates’ perceptions of
having been abused, but in the only study of the antecedents of abusive
supervision, Ashforth (1997) found no consistent effects for dispositional
factors (e.g., Theory X beliefs, low self-esteem, and low tolerance for
ambiguity), situational factors (e.g., institutionalized norms, power, and
stressors), or their interactions. One possible reason that Ashforth found
little support for the linkages he investigated may be that his model did not
account for the role that victim characteristics play in the expression of
hostility at work; it may be argued that perpetrator and situational factors
contribute more strongly to the occurrence of abusive supervision when a
vulnerable target is available.

We explored this possibility by developing a model of abusive supervi-
sion that accounts for the notion of victim precipitation, the idea that some
individuals may become at risk of being victimized by eliciting (often un-
consciously) the hostility of potential perpetrators (Elias, 1986). We begin
by drawing on the organizational justice literature to identify procedural
injustice and depression as factors that may make supervisors more prone
to engage in abusive behavior. Speciﬁcally, we argue that supervisors’
procedural injustices translate into depression, which results in greater
incidences of abuse (as reported by subordinates). We then integrate the
emerging literature on workplace victimization, which has identiﬁed tar-
gets’ negative affectivity (NA) as a factor that is associated with victim
precipitation (Aquino, 2000). This line of reasoning produces a moderated-
mediation model in which the mediating effects of supervisors’ depression
on the relationship between supervisors’ procedural justice and subordi-
nates’ perceived abuse will be stronger when subordinates are higher in
NA. Finally, we report a test of our predictions using data collected from
a large sample of supervisors and their subordinates.

Theoretical Background and Hypotheses

We reviewed the literatures that address the antecedents of hostile be-
havior in formal organizations and in nonwork relationships. Our literature

search identiﬁed two variables that have been shown to be related to hos-
tile behavior in general but that have not been investigated as triggers of
abusive supervision speciﬁcally: supervisors’ perceptions of procedural
injustice and supervisors’ depression.
Supervisors’ Procedural Injustice→Abusive Supervision

Procedural justice refers to the perceived fairness of the means by
which organizations and their representatives make allocation decisions.
Decision-making processes are said to be procedurally just when those
affected have an opportunity to inﬂuence decisions (Thibaut & Walker,
1975) and when they are treated with neutrality, trustworthiness, and re-
spect (Tyler, 1989). Individuals experience procedural injustice when they
are denied voice and decision control, or when organizational representa-
tives act disrespectfully during allocation processes. Procedural injustices,
in turn, produce resentment and a desire to retaliate against those who are
seen as blameworthy (Bies & Tripp, 1996; Folger, 1993; Greenberg, 1993;
Shapiro, Trevino, & Victor, 1995; Skarlicki & Folger, 1997).

Of relevance to our focus on perceived abuse as an outcome variable
is research suggesting that procedural injustice can produce generalized,
negative emotional states that may be vented against convenient targets
(Cropanzano & Prehar, 2001; Fitness, 2000; Glomb, 2002; Weiss, Suckow,
& Cropanzano, 1999). Procedural injustices can produce feelings that one
is not held in high esteem by their organization (Tyler, 1994) or valued
as a group member (Folger & Kass, 2000). Moreover, injustice has been
linked to diminished self-efﬁcacy and depression (Tepper, 2001), with
some evidence suggesting that the relationship between procedural justice
and depression is stronger among those with higher levels of administra-
tive responsibility (Sutinen, Kivimaki, Elovainio, & Virtanen, 2002). The
feelings of powerlessness that are associated with depression can, in turn,
motivate deviant and aggressive behavior (Bennett, 1998). We therefore
expected that supervisors’ procedural justice would be negatively related
to subordinates’ perceptions that they have been abused; however, our
explanation as to how procedural justice inﬂuences abusive supervision
implicates supervisors’ depression and the accompanying feelings of pow-
erlessness as a proximal antecedent. That is, we conceptualize supervisors’
depression as the means by which supervisors’ procedural injustices trans-
late into subordinates’ perceptions that they have been abused. It is this
process to which we turn next.

Mediating Effects of Supervisors’ Depression

The term, depression, is used to describe the mild feelings of sadness,
apathy, worthlessness, and a loss of interest in things that most people


104

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

experience from time to time, as well as the intense and persistent symp-
toms associated with the clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder (Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health, 2000). Like the clinically depressed,
those who experience mild depressive mood states lack energy, have low
self-respect, and may engage in self-destructive actions. But a consider-
able body of work suggests that depressed people express anger outward
as well: it has been estimated that between 30% and 40% of clinically
depressed people experience anger attacks, inappropriate hostility, and
rage directed at others (Fava & Rosenbaum, 1999). Of relevance to our
focus on the occurrence of abusive supervision in work organizations is
empirical research suggesting that even in nonclinical samples, depressed
persons tend to be more hostile than nondepressed persons (Biaggio &
Goodwin, 1987; Johnston, Rogers, & Searight, 1991), and that these ex-
pressions of hostility share much in common with the abusive supervision
content domain (e.g., angry outbursts, rudeness, cursing; Tepper, 2000).
One explanation for the relationship between depressive mood states and
hostility is that depressed individuals experience performance deﬁcits and
have difﬁculty relating to others. Depressed people who experience a sense
of powerlessness and negative self-talk with respect to the degree of con-
trol they have over their environment (Street, Sheeran, & Orbell, 2001)
aggress, in part, to regain a sense of control, self-worth, and power.

We therefore expected that supervisors’ depression would play a medi-
ating role in the relationship between supervisors’ procedural justice and
the extent to which subordinates report that they have been abused by their
supervisor. However, as stated at the outset, a key component of our con-
ceptualization is the notion that supervisors prone to hostility will engage
in abusive supervision when they have a ready target. That is, the depres-
sive symptoms evoked by procedural injustices will translate into abusive
supervision when characteristics of the subordinate make them a desirable
or vulnerable target. As Greenberg and Alge (1998) note, “it is one thing
for people to recognize they have been victims of unfair distributions or
procedures, and quite another for them to act on these beliefs” (p. 101). In
a similar vein, although depressed individuals are prone to hostility, not
all depressed supervisors will abuse their subordinates. Therefore, it is im-
portant to identify under what circumstances we would expect the indirect
effects of injustice (through depression) to result in perceived abuse. We
found an answer to that question in the victimization literature.

Moderating Effects of Subordinates’ Negative Affectivity

According to theories of victim precipitation, some individuals may
become at risk of being victimized by provoking the hostility of poten-
tial perpetrators, a concept Elias (1986) refers to as victim precipitation.


BENNETT J. TEPPER ET AL.

105

Victim precipitation captures the notion that targets of hostility may partic-
ipate to some degree in their own victimization (Curtis, 1974; Drapkin &
Viano, 1974). For example, in studies of bullying among school children,
Olweus (1978) found that victims presented themselves as anxious, in-
secure, and vulnerable to aggressive behavior because they demonstrated
little ability to defend themselves against attack. We modeled victim pre-
cipitation using NA, which captures the dispositional tendency to expe-
rience high levels of distressing emotions like anger, hostility, sadness,
and fear (Watson & Clark, 1984), and that has been used to model victim
precipitation in previous organizational research (Aquino, 2000; Aquino
& Bradﬁeld, 2000; Aquino, Grover, Bradﬁeld, & Allen, 1999).

Aquino and his colleagues have argued that there are two reasons why
perpetrators target individuals who are high in NA. First, to the extent high
NA persons present themselves as anxious, distressed, and dissatisﬁed, po-
tential abusers may see them as ripe targets for exploitation. Olweus (1978)
refers to these types of individuals as “submissive victims” because they
behave anxiously, insecurely, and passively, which makes them appear un-
likely to defend themselves. Aquino et al. (1999) argue that some high NA
persons unknowingly assume the role of submissive victim by demonstrat-
ing little ability to protect themselves against mistreatment; consequently,
high NA persons may be perceived as vulnerable targets for victimiza-
tion. It is reasonable to assume that most individuals are likely to consider
the repercussions of behaving aggressively (Greenberg & Alge, 1998).
Whether one acts in an abusive manner depends, in part, on whether one is
willing to pay the consequences of such behavior. Abusing subordinates
who are perceived to be weak and vulnerable may be a means by which
unjustly treated supervisors can displace their anger against a safe target
(Spector, 1978). To the extent high NA subordinates present themselves
as submissive victims, supervisors inclined to hostility may feel that they
are less likely to face consequences for their behavior if they abuse a high
NA subordinate rather than a low NA subordinate.

A second reason to expect that supervisors inclined to hostility will
abuse high NA subordinates is that because high NA employees frequently
experience emotional distress, they may be more likely to violate rules of
social interaction and have performance problems, which results in be-
haviors that others may perceive as annoying and disrespectful (Felson,
1978). These individuals, which Olweus (1978) referred to as “provoca-
tive victims,” are desirable targets because they are not likeable and often
have poor relationships with their supervisors (George, 1992). To the ex-
tent high NA subordinates demand more attention of their supervisors,
it is reasonable to assume that managers, particularly those with heavy
workloads, will ﬁnd their behavior aggravating and irritating. It is also
reasonable to assume that coworkers would be less likely to come to the


106

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

defense of a provocative victim, making them safe targets for hostile super-
visors. Hence, compared with low NA subordinates, high NA subordinates
are more likely to provoke supervisors inclined to be abusive because they
tend to be perceived as hostile and demanding (Watson & Clark, 1984).
This may be especially true in the case of depressed supervisors who may
be prone to rumination over social interactions and perceptions of “social
threats.” Research indicates that depressed individuals become hypersen-
sitive to signals of their social standing and are therefore more likely to
draw negative conclusions from any semblance of social threat (Allen &
Badcock, 2003), of which provocative behavior on the part of a high NA
employee is one example.

This line of reasoning produces what Baron and Kenny (1986) refer
to as a moderated-mediation framework, in which a mediating effect is
stronger or weaker across levels of another (moderating) variable. Speciﬁ-
cally, we tested the hypothesis that the strength of the mediated relationship
between supervisors’ procedural justice and subordinates’ perceptions
that they have been abused (through supervisors’ depression) will depend
on subordinates’ NA; the indirect effect of supervisors’ procedural justice
will be stronger when subordinates are higher in NA.

Method

Sample and Procedure

We tested our hypothesis with data collected from a sample of Na-
tional Guard members and their military supervisors.1 We administered
surveys to both rank-and-ﬁle guard members (i.e., subordinate survey) and
to those who had supervisory responsibilities at the time of the study (i.e.,
supervisor survey). All participants completed surveys during regularly
scheduled group meetings, and we used military I.D. numbers to match
the responses of supervisors and subordinates. The supervisor survey con-
tained measures of procedural justice and depression, and the subordinate
survey contained measures of abusive supervision and NA. In addition,
we measured subordinates’ tenure with the supervisor, the amount of time
that the subordinates had reported directly to their supervisor, in order
to control for this variable in our analysis. This background variable was
coded as follows: 1 = less than 6 months, 2 = over 6 months and less than

1The data reported in this research were used in a previous study reported by Zellars,
Tepper, and Duffy (2002). In that publication, the researchers treated abusive supervision as
an independent variable and explored its relationships with subordinates’ procedural justice
perceptions and organizational citizenship behaviors. Our research differs from Zellars’
et al. in that we used the measures of supervisors’ depression and procedural justice (which
were not reported in the earlier study) as predictors of abusive supervision.

18 months, 3 = over 18 months and less than 3 years, 4 = over 3 years
and less than 5 years, and 5 = over 5 years.

Two thousand forty-two soldiers completed the subordinate survey, and
518 military leaders completed the supervisor survey. Eliminating surveys
that could not be matched and those with missing data produced a sam-
ple of 334 dyads from 250 military groups (166 supervisor–subordinate
dyads and 84 triads consisting of one supervisor and two subordinates).
Ninety-three percent of the subordinates were male and the median age
was between 25 and 29 years; 96% of the supervisors were male and their
median age was between 30 and 39 years. The participants’ service to the
National Guard included (but was not limited to) such activities as health
care, engineering, machine repair, technical and nontechnical training, and
administrative duties.

Measures

Abusive supervision. Subordinates completed a 14-item measure of
abusive supervision, which Zellars et al. (2002) developed for use in mil-
itary settings. Respondents used a 5-point response scale (ranging from
1 = never to 5 = frequently, if not always) to indicate the frequency with
which their supervisors perform such behaviors as “tells me my thoughts
and feelings are stupid” and “puts me down in front of others.”

Negative affectivity. Subordinates reported their own level of NA
using four items from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;
Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The respondents used a 5-point scale
ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely to report the extent to which
they felt “distressed,” “upset,” “afraid,” and “jittery” during the previous
few months.

Procedural justice. Supervisors completed a ﬁve-item measure of
procedural justice that was originally developed and used by Moorman
(1991). We adapted these items for use in the context we investigated,
the National Guard. Respondents used a 5-point scale ranging from 1 =
strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree to report their level of agreement
with such items as “my organization uses procedures that collect accurate
information to make decisions” and “my organization makes decisions in
an unbiased manner.”

Supervisors’ depression. The NIMH Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess supervisors’
depression (Radloff, 1977). This seven-item scale asks respondents to
indicate their feelings in the past week about the future, themselves, their
mood, and physical symptoms with items such as “I thought my life had
been a failure” and “I felt sad.” Responses range from 1 = never to
5 = frequently, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression.


108

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Although the CES-D was designed to measure depressive symptoms in the
general population and is not used to render a diagnosis of major depres-
sion, an item average of 3.5 or higher is indicative of major depression.

Prior to forming the scales for further analysis, we assessed the di-
mensionality of the items using conﬁrmatory factor analysis. We com-
pared three ways of modeling the item covariance matrix: a null model in
which all items loaded on separate factors, a one-factor model in which
all items loaded on a common factor, and a four-factor model in which the
items designed to measure abusive supervision, NA, procedural justice,
and depression loaded on four separate, correlated factors. The ﬁt of the
four-factor model (χ 2[371] = 1503.66, p < .01) was superior to the ﬁt of
the null model (χ 2[35] = 13,440.23, p < .01) and the one-factor model
(χ 2[6] = 2103, p < .01). In addition, the four-factor model’s compar-
ative ﬁt index (.92) and root mean-squared error of approximation (.09)
were superior to those of the one-factor model (CFI = .78, RMSEA =
.18). Consequently, we averaged the appropriate item scores to form total
scores for abusive supervision, NA, procedural justice, and depression.

Results

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics, intercorrelations, and coefﬁcient
alphas for the study variables. Tenure with the supervisor was unrelated
to all other variables and including it in the analysis had no effect on the
results. Consequently, below we present the results excluding tenure with
the supervisor.

We explored our hypothesized model using the framework for testing
moderated-mediation models outlined by Edwards and Lambert (2004).2
Tests of mediated models in the management literature have been dom-
inated by Baron and Kenny’s (1986) causal steps approach, but this
approach has been criticized for several shortcomings, including low
power to detect effects and high Type I error rates. Edwards and Lambert’s
framework builds on the recommendations for testing mediation in a
path analytic framework (see MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West,
& Sheets, 2002; Shrout & Bolger, 2002) by combining these procedures
with moderated regression analysis. This integrated framework facilitates

2Exploring the hypothesized relationships was complicated by nonindependence on the
measure of abusive supervision for subordinates reporting to the same supervisor (i.e., 84
triads). Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998) argue that when the intraclass correlation is small
and there are few persons per group, there should be little distortion in alpha (i.e., the
probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis). Consequently, because the intra-
class correlation for abusive supervision was only .12 and the number of subordinates per
group was also small (334 subordinates/250 work groups = 1.3 subordinates per group), the
level of nonindependence is not what Kenny et al. refer to as consequential.

testing moderated mediation by showing that moderation can occur at mul-
tiple stages of mediation and that mediated effects may vary according to
the level of the moderator. The framework also permits testing the hypoth-
esized model against a family of nested models, which allows omnibus
comparisons of the hypothesized model against more and less restrictive
alternative models.

The integrated approach for testing our model proceeds by estimat-
ing two regression equations. First, the effects of procedural justice on
depression are estimated with Equation 1 below,
M= a0 + a1 X + eM ,

[1]

where M and X refer to supervisors’ depression and procedural justice,
respectively. The second equation below estimates direct and moderating
effects on abusive supervision,

Y= b0 + b1 M + b2 X + b3 Z + b4MZ + eY ,

where Y and Z refer to abusive supervision and subordinates’ NA, respec-
tively, and the term MZ refers to the moderating effects of NA on the
relationship between depression and abusive supervision. By substituting
Equation 1 for M in Equation 2, the moderating and mediating effects are
integrated in a reduced form as shown in the equation below:

Y = b0 + b1(a0 + a1 X + eM) + b2 X + b3 Z

+ b4(a0 + a1 X + eM)Z + eY .

Equation 3 may be simpliﬁed as follows:

Y = (b0 + a0b1) + (b2 + a1b1)X + (b3 + a0b4)Z

+ a1b4XZ + eY + b1eM + b4 ZeM .

[2]

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

To clarify the direct, indirect, and moderating effects, Equation 4 may be
rewritten in terms of simple paths, which are analogous to simple slopes
in moderated regression analysis (Aiken & West, 1991).

Y = [b0 + b3 Z + a0(b1 + b4 Z)] + [b2 + a1(b1 + b4 Z)]X

+ eY + b1eM + b4ZeM .

[5]

In Equation 5, the direct effect of X (procedural justice) on Y (abusive
supervision) corresponds to the term b2, and the indirect effect of X on
Y corresponds to the product term, a1(b1 + b4Z). Tests of indirect effects
involve product terms; however, signiﬁcance tests of product terms have a
high Type I error rate because product terms have nonnormal distributions
(Shrout & Bolger, 2002). We therefore followed current recommendations
by bootstrapping 10,000 samples for estimating Equations 3 and 4, and
using the bootstrapped estimates to construct bias-corrected conﬁdence
intervals for all signiﬁcance tests reported in this paper (Mooney & Duval,
1993; Shrout & Bolger, 2002).

Table 2 shows the regression results for the hypothesized model.
The model explained 8% of the variance in depression and 14% of
the variance in abusive supervision. As expected, supervisors’ procedu-
ral justice was negatively related to supervisors’ depression (b = −.24,
p < .01) and abusive supervision (b = −.09, p < .05). Although super-
visors’ depression was unrelated to abusive supervision (b = .08, ns), the
interaction between supervisors’ depression and subordinates’ NA was
signiﬁcant (b = .17, p < .01).

The information from this model was used to calculate simple effects
at low and high levels of NA, which are shown in Table 3. These path
estimates show that the direct and indirect paths from procedural justice
to abusive supervision vary at low and high values of subordinates’ NA.
At low levels of NA, procedural justice has a direct effect on depres-
sion and on abusive supervision, but the path from depression to abusive
supervision is not signiﬁcant, nor is the indirect effect of procedural jus-
tice on abusive supervision. Consequently, depression does not mediate
the relationship between procedural justice and abusive supervision when
subordinates’ NA is low. At high levels of NA, supervisors’ procedural
justice is related to depression, depression is related to abusive supervi-
sion, and procedural justice has both direct and indirect effects on abusive
supervision. The mediated effects of procedural justice at plus and minus
two standard deviations around the means of NA and procedural justice are
graphed in Figure 1, which shows that when subordinates’ NA is higher,
abusive supervision increases as the mediated effect of procedural justice
increases. These results are consistent with our hypothesis; the mediating
effect of supervisors’ depression on the relationship between supervisors’

procedural justice and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervision
was stronger when subordinates were higher in NA.

Our results demonstrate that subordinates’ NA moderates the path
from supervisors’ depression to abusive supervision, but it is conceivable
that NA moderates the path from supervisors’ procedural justice to de-
pression and/or the path from procedural justice to abusive supervision.

The evidence for our hypothesis is strengthened to the extent that we can
demonstrate that the hypothesized model explains the relationships among
the variables as well as a fully saturated model and better than alternative
restricted models. A fully saturated model that accounts for the total effects
of the variables involved requires estimating Equations 6 and 7 below:

M = a0 + a1 X + a2 Z + a3XZ + eM .

and

Y = b0 + b1 M + b2 X + b3 Z + b4MZ + b5 X Z + eY .

Equation 6 accounts for the moderating effect of NA on the relationship
between supervisors’ procedural justice and supervisors’ depression with
the XZ term, and Equation 7 includes the moderating effects of NA on the
relationship between procedural justice and abusive supervision (i.e., the
XZ term) and on the relationship between depression and abusive super-
vision (i.e., the MZ term). By substituting Equation 6 for M in Equation 7,
the moderating and mediating effects are integrated in a reduced form
equation below,

Y = b0 + b1(a0 + a1 X + a2 Z + a3XZ + eM) + b2 X + b3Z
+ b4(a0 + a1 X + a2 Z + a3XZ + eM)Z + b5XZ + eY .

Equation 8 may be simpliﬁed as follows in Equation 9,

Y = (b0 + a0b1) + (b2 + a1b1)X + (b3 + a2b1 + a0b4)Z

+ (b5 + a3b1 + a1b4)X Z + a2b4 Z 2 + a3b4XZ2
+ eY + b1eM + b4ZeM .

The moderating effects of Z (NA) can be seen by rewriting Equation 9 in
terms of simples paths,

Y = [b0 + b3 Z) + (a0 + a2 Z)(b1 + b4 Z)] + [(b2 + b5 Z)
+ (a1 + a3 Z)(b1 + b4 Z)X] + eY + b1eM + b4 ZeM .

[10]
In Equation 10, the direct effect of X on Y corresponds to the term (b2 +
b5 Z) and the indirect effect of X on Y corresponds to the product term,
(a1 + a3 Z)(b1 + b4 Z). Equation 10 estimates a total effects modera-
tion model that tests the moderating effect of Z (subordinates’ NA) on
the paths from X to Y (procedural justice to abusive supervision), X to
M (procedural justice to depression), and M to Y (depression to abusive
supervision), respectively, and incorporates the direct effects of procedu-
ral justice, the indirect effects of procedural justice through depression,
and the direct effects of depression on abusive supervision. By selectively


114

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

omitting effects from the total effects model, alternative models may be
estimated for comparison with the hypothesized model.

Regression results pertaining to the total effects model estimated by
Equation 10 and to selected alternative models are included in Table 2.
The ﬁt of nested path models may be compared by examining the signiﬁ-
cance of a W statistic (Pedhauzer, 1982). This involves ﬁrst computing a
generalized R2 from the regression R2 values using the following formula:

= 1 − (cid:2)1 − R2

MF

(cid:2)1 − R2

YF

G F

(cid:3).

[11]

The subscript, F, refers to the full or total effects model, and the R2
MF and
R2
YF are the estimated values from Equations 6 and 7, respectively. The
GH, is calculated from the R2
generalized R2 for the hypothesized model, R2
values of regression Equations 1 and 2. The values for R2
GH are
used to compute a Q statistic as shown below:
(cid:2)1 − R2

Q = (cid:2)1 − R2

GF and R2

[12]

(cid:3).

G H

Higher values of the Q statistic indicate better ﬁt, and the signiﬁcance of
the Q statistic may be evaluated with the formula for W

W = −(N − d) loge Q,

[13]

where N and d refer to the sample size and to the number of restrictions
imposed by the restricted model when compared with the total effects
model, respectively, and loge refers to the natural logarithm. The W statistic
is chi-square distributed with d degrees of freedom.

We next compared the hypothesized model to three alternative models:
(a) a model that was speciﬁed the same as the hypothesized model, except
that it included the procedural justice × NA interaction and excluded the
depression× NA interaction (Model A; moderation of the direct effect), (b)
a model that was speciﬁed the same as the hypothesized model except that
it included the procedural justice × NA interaction (Model B; moderation
of the direct and indirect effects), and (c) a model that was speciﬁed the
same as the hypothesized model except that it omitted moderation of the
indirect effect (Model C; no moderating effects).

Table 2 shows that alternative Models A and B fully explained the
variance in the total effects model as indicated by the nonsigniﬁcant values
for W. Moreover, we found that the hypothesized model could not be
distinguished from Model A (W = 1.26, d = 0, p = n.s.) or Model B
(W = 2.97, d = 1, p = n.s.). However, further evidence in support of our
hypothesis is that the hypothesized model was superior to Model C, the

(cid:3)

(cid:4)

115
alternative model that contained no interaction effects (W = 8.33, d =
1, p < .01) and that Model B, which included moderation of the indirect
effect, was superior to Model A (W = 4.24, d = 1, p < .05). However,
we cannot reject alternative models that include the moderating effects
of subordinates’ NA on the direct relationship between procedural justice
and abusive supervision. That is, we cannot rule out the possibility that
when subordinates’ NA is high, procedural justice may inﬂuence abusive
supervision through factors other than depression.

Discussion

The purpose of our study was to explore the antecedents of abusive
supervision by developing and testing a model that integrates the justice
and victim precipitation literatures. Our research ﬁndings were consistent
with the idea that when subordinates are high in NA, supervisors’ who
report low procedural justice experience depression that translates into
perceived abuse. For low NA subordinates, supervisors’ procedural jus-
tice was directly related to abusive supervision, but as predicted, evidence
of a mediating effect for supervisors’ depression emerged only when sub-
ordinates were high in NA. However, the results provided partial support
for our prediction because there was also evidence of a direct relationship
between procedural justice and abusive supervision when subordinates’
NA was high. That is, for high NA subordinates, there was evidence of
both direct and indirect effects of procedural justice on perceived abuse
(i.e., depression partially mediated the effect of procedural justice). Below,
we discuss our study’s implications for theory, research, and management
practice as well as identify its limitations.

Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice

Our study contributes to knowledge about employees’ perceptions of
abusive supervision. As we noted earlier, much is known about the con-
sequences of abusive supervision; however, prior to our research, only
one study of the antecedents of abusive supervision had been conducted,
the results of which provided little insight into the conditions that engen-
der perceived abuse (see Ashforth, 1997). Our study, which used theo-
ries of justice and victim precipitation as a conceptual foundation, was
more revealing. Our ﬁndings are consistent with the idea that supervisors
exposed to procedural injustices experience depression, which, in turn,
results in abusive behavior against subordinates who are perceived to be
vulnerable or provocative. Of course, the evidence of partial mediation
we obtained may be interpreted to mean that variables besides depression
carry part of the effect of procedural justice. In thinking about what those


116

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

other variables might be, logical possibilities include resentment, power-
lessness, or low control. An obvious direction for future research would
be to replicate the research reported here, including measures of these
variables.

Nothwithstanding the fact that our study provided only partial support
for our prediction, we believe that our research provides a solid foundation
for future inquiry and extends what is known about justice, depression,
and victimization in organizations. With respect to organizational justice,
our research extends knowledge about the effects of supervisors’ justice
perceptions. For the most part, previous research has treated justice as a
consequence (for subordinates) of supervisor behaviors (e.g., Niehoff &
Moorman, 1993; Pillai, Schriesheim, & Williams, 1999; Scandura, 1997)
and has focused on victims’ retaliatory responses against harmdoers, those
who are viewed as blameworthy for perceived injustices (Bies & Tripp,
1996; Skarlicki & Folger, 1997). Our ﬁndings are consistent with the idea
that unjustly treated supervisors may express their resentment by abusing
their direct reports (i.e., individuals who should not be perceived as respon-
sible for the procedural injustices supervisors experience). Taken together
with research suggesting that abused subordinates experience greater in-
justice than nonabused subordinates (Tepper, 2000), our ﬁndings implicate
abusive supervision in a “trickle-down” framework (Masterson, 2001) in
which supervisors’ perceived injustices affect subordinates’ perceived in-
justices through supervisor abusiveness. Thus, organizations seeking to
reduce hostility and aggression in the workplace may need to begin with
the fair treatment of supervisors.

Our study also extends what is known about depression in organi-
zations. Most studies of employees’ psychological distress have treated
variables like depression as a dependent variable. Recent examples in-
clude studies of the effects of management practices (Mackie, Holahan, &
Gottlieb, 2001), job demands (Reynolds, 1997), and conﬂict between work
and family (Chait-Barnett & Gareis, 2000) on employees’ depression. Re-
search of this sort is justiﬁed by the costs of depression for organizations
and their members (in terms of reduced productivity, increased absen-
teeism, and health care costs). Our ﬁnding that, in some situations, super-
visors’ depression is related to abusive supervision (i.e., when supervisors
have a “good” target in the form of a high NA subordinate) suggests that
depression has additional costs related to the frequency of hostile behav-
ior in organizations. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Goldberg and Steury
(2001), organizations are rarely interested in addressing depression in the
workplace in order to alleviate the “human suffering and distress” of de-
pressed persons (p. 1642). However, organizations that continue to ignore
this serious health issue may ﬁnd themselves faced with increased su-
pervisory abuse toward subordinates (especially high NA subordinates),


BENNETT J. TEPPER ET AL.

117

which can lead to lower morale and satisfaction among employees and
eventually, increased turnover.

Lastly, our study contributes to the victimization literature by address-
ing calls for research that explores the interaction of victim and offender
characteristics and perceptions in the occurrence of negative work behav-
iors (e.g., Einarsen, 2000; Olweus, 1978) and by laying the groundwork for
developing strategies designed to prevent or at least reduce the frequency
of victimization (Elias, 1986). Examining victim characteristics is impor-
tant because offenders and victims alike often cite the personality and
actions of the victim as important determinants of workplace harassment
(Matthiesen & Einarsen, 2001) and of hostile behavior in general (e.g.,
Aquino, 2000; Ashforth, 1994; Schuster, 1996). However, we want to make
it clear that by advocating research regarding victim characteristics, we are
not blaming subordinates for abusive supervision but rather attempting to
identify risk factors that may contribute to its occurrence. Ultimately, the
responsibility for addressing and preventing abusive supervision lies with
organizations. Supervisors are organizational representatives and as such
should be held accountable for their actions and monitored for detrimental
behaviors. Our ﬁndings suggest that organizations could also make use of
preventive measures such as counseling programs in which supervisors
learn (a) how to cope with the distressing emotions associated with de-
pression and (b) more constructive responses to perceived injustices (i.e.,
other than venting their anger against vulnerable targets).

Limitations

Our study is not without limitations. The most important limitations
have to do with the internal validity of our study. Our model is rooted in
the notion that high NA subordinates evoke or trigger abusive supervisor
behavior because they are unlikeable and difﬁcult to work with. However,
a case could be made that high NA subordinates report that their supervi-
sors are more abusive than low NA subordinates because high NA people
are more ruminative and apprehensive and are therefore more likely to
recall unpleasant information (Larsen, 1992; Lishman, 1972; Watson &
Pennebaker, 1989). Both perspectives (high NA as a trigger for abusive
behavior and high NA as producing a perceptual tendency to report abusive
behavior) would predict a positive relationship between subordinates’ NA
and abusive supervision. Consequently, with respect to the relationship
between NA and abusive supervision (see Table 1), we cannot rule out the
alternative to our victimization-based explanation.

We believe that the evidence of moderating effects for subordinates’
NA renders the victimization explanation a more plausible explanation for
our study results. The logic behind our framework is that supervisors who


118

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

experience depression because they have experienced procedural injus-
tice are more likely to abuse subordinates who ﬁt the victim proﬁle (i.e.,
high NA subordinates; Aquino et al., 1999). It is less clear why a per-
ceptual or reporting bias for high NA subordinates would be more likely
to emerge when another party (i.e., the subordinate’s supervisor) reports
greater injustice or depression. Hence, although the alternative perspective
is a plausible explanation for the direct relationship between subordinates’
NA and abusive supervision, we believe that it is not as viable an explana-
tion for the evidence of moderated mediation that emerged in our study.
Having said this, one way of addressing the matter in future research
would be to measure subordinates’ NA from the supervisors’ perspec-
tive. Notwithstanding the evidence suggesting that there is good self-other
agreement on measures of NA (Watson, Hubbard, & Wiese, 2000) and
that the level of agreement is unaffected by relationship quality (McCrae,
1994; McCrae, Stone, Fagan, & Costa, 1998), a measure of subordinates’
NA from the supervisors’ perspective would produce better ﬁdelity with
the victimization model, which suggests that abusers target individuals
whom the perpetrator perceives to be vulnerable, provocative, or difﬁcult.
Doing so would also allow investigation of the means by which subor-
dinates’ self-reported NA moderates the mediation framework we tested
(i.e., supervisors’ perceptions of subordinates’ NA may be a proximal
moderator).

Another measurement issue has to do with our operationalization of
abusive supervision. As in previous studies, we measured abusive su-
pervision using subordinates’ self-reports (e.g., Tepper, 2000; Tepper
et al., 2004; Zellars et al., 2002). This approach assumes that there is
good agreement between self-reported abuse and actual exposure to abu-
sive behavior. However, it is reasonable to assume that some people may
underreport their level of exposure because they are reluctant to admit that
they have been victimized, whereas others exaggerate their supervisors’
hostility (Aquino & Lamertz, 2004). Consequently, a critically important
direction for future research is to gather data from different sources so as
to triangulate in on the abusive supervision construct by gathering data
from sources other than the victim. This could include observer reports,
supervisor self-reports, or archival information.

The nature of our sample may evoke questions about the generaliz-
ability of our ﬁndings. Our sample consisted of members of a paramilitary
organization, most of whom were male, and it is uncertain whether our ﬁnd-
ings generalize to other kinds of organizations and samples. For example,
it may be argued that the relationship between supervisors’ depression and
abusive supervision differs depending on the supervisor’s sex. Nonclini-
cal depression manifests in different ways for men and women; whereas
depressed women tend to blame themselves, avoid conﬂict, and withdraw


BENNETT J. TEPPER ET AL.

119

when hurt, depressed men tend to be suspicious of others’ motives, blame
others for their problems, and attack when hurt (Diamond, 1998; Dott &
Dott, 2001; Rihmer, Pestality, Pihlgren, & Rutz, 1998). Hence, male de-
pression, more so than female depression, may be associated with hostility
against others, and the relationships we observed may only hold for men.
However, because men tend to be more aggressive and hostile than women
(Feshbach, 1997), assessing the antecedents of abusive supervision among
male supervisors appears to be the appropriate initial step for research in
this area. Nevertheless, future research should explore the antecedents of
abusive supervision among female supervisors.

A ﬁnal limitation is that the effects we uncovered explained relatively
small amounts of variance in abusive supervision (i.e., the hypothesized
model explained 14% of the variance in abusive supervision and the
moderating effect explained only 2% of incremental variance beyond a
mediation-only model). Although the effect sizes were relatively small,
utility analysis demonstrates the value of reducing abusive supervision by
even a small amount. Researchers estimate that the costs associated with
abuse in the workplace (e.g., absenteeism, turnover, legal costs, reduced
productivity) range from $17,000 to $24,000 per serious case (Sheehan,
McCarthy, Barker, & Henderson, 2001). Furthermore, Namie and Namie
(2000) report that between 10% and 16% of employees are subjected to
abusive supervision, which translates into at least 1.4 million employees
who are regularly abused in the United States. (According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, there are 140.5 million U.S. workers.) As a result, using
the aforementioned statistics, a conservative estimate of costs to U.S. em-
ployers for abusive supervision is $23.8 billion annually. Assuming that by
considering supervisors’ procedural justice and depression levels as well
as subordinates’ NA that abusive supervision could be reduced by just 1%,
organizations could save $238 million annually. In summary, although the
effect sizes may appear trivial, they suggest that organizations may be able
to make a meaningful impact on the bottom line by controlling for abusive
supervision.

Despite these limitations, our study provides support for a victimiza-
tion model of abusive supervision and provides a foundation for much
needed research. Future research should build on the ideas tested here by
exploring the effects of offender characteristics (e.g., occupational stress,
machiavellianism, trait anger), victim variables (e.g., frequency of inter-
action, tendency to forgive, perceived power, whether or not an abused
subordinate is a submissive victim or a provocative victim), regulatory
failures (e.g., reporting mechanisms, no tolerance policies, disciplinary
procedures), and structural forces (e.g., hostility norms, organizational
structure) on the occurrence of perceived abuse. As suggested by our study,
future research should reﬂect the notion that these sources may interact to


120

determine the extent to which employees perceive their supervisors to be
abusive.
