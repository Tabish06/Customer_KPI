The aim of the paper is to test the impacts of supplier relationship management (SRM) and total quality
management (TQM) on environmental performance under the inﬂuence of
leadership and the
moderation effect of institutional pressures (IP). The study investigates these effects using a pre-
tested structured questionnaire. Data was collected using a split survey method using a modiﬁed version
of Dillman's (2007) total design method with 187 and 174 complete and usable responses for the
respective parts. We performed non-response bias before checking assumptions such as constant
variance and normality. We further checked reliability and construct validity using conﬁrmatory factor
analysis and hierarchical regression analyses for hypothesis testing. We ﬁnd that constructs and
indicators of our theoretical framework meet the criteria, and ﬁnd them to be a good ﬁt based on
conﬁrmatory factor analysis and ﬁt indices output. The hierarchical regression analyses outputs suggest
that all our hypotheses are supported, which further supports the extant literature. Our present study is
unique in terms of scope and contribution to SCM and OM theory and practice. The study has tested
empirically the research calls of various researchers and extended them to green supply chain networks.
Our ﬁndings support institutional theory.

Introduction

The growing concern towards protecting the environment has
now transferred into green policies (e.g. Sarkis et al., 2011;
Gunasekaran and Gallear, 2012). Today, green manufacturing has
become common jargon used by almost one-third of manufactur-
ing specialists and researchers. This is, perhaps, inevitable. There is
a dire need for companies, and especially those engaged in
manufacturing activities, to take a proactive, rather than a reactive,
approach in this regard. According to a report released by UNEP
(2011), global manufacturing industry consumes 35 per cent of the
total electricity consumed worldwide and is responsible for 20 per
cent of the world's CO2 emissions, which is detrimental to all life
on earth. The effect of this argument is to draw attention towards
green manufacturing.

In recent years, researchers have shown increasing interest in
environmentally friendly manufacturing practices (Choi et al.,
2012). While there is a rich body of literature on green manufac-
turing and its implementation (e.g. Bierma and Waterstraat, 1999;
Vachon and Klassen, 2006; Hsu and Hu, 2009; Bai and Sarkis,
2010; Ku et al., 2010; Testa and Iraldo, 2010; Lo et al., 2012; van
Hoof and Lyon, 2013), there is little literature which has attempted
to study leadership and operational practices' impacts on environ-
mental performance. Few studies utilize a theory-focused
approach to understand the role of key factors of green manufac-
turing in environmental performance. Drawing on the literature
on leadership (e.g. Siaminwe et al., 2005; Stone, 2006; Brown and
Stone, 2007; Van Berkel, 2007; Deif, 2011; Despeisse et al., 2012;
Law and Gunasekaran 2012; Singh et al., 2012; Dües et al., 2013;
van Hoof and Lyon, 2013), supplier relationship management (e.g.
Bierma and Waterstraat, 1999; Vachon and Klassen, 2006; Hsu and
Hu, 2009; Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Ku et al., 2010; Testa and Iraldo,
2010; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013), total quality management (e.g.
Pauli, 1997; Murovec et al., 2012; Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-
Moliner et al., 2012), institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell,
1983; Clemens and Douglas, 2006; Yu et al., 2006; Zhu and Sarkis,
2007; Sarkis et al., 2011) and environmental performance (e.g. Zhu

121

and Sarkis, 2004; Wagner and Schaltegger, 2004; Schoenherr,
2012; Lo et al., 2012), we develop a theoretical framework to
explain the impact of leadership, supplier relationship manage-
ment and total quality management on environmental perfor-
mance under the inﬂuence of institutional pressures. Extending
the ﬁndings of Kanji and Wong (1999), who proposed a business
excellence model for supply chain management, we submit that
institutional pressures can further moderate the impact of the
implementation of green manufacturing practices.

While it is reasonable to assume that leadership, supplier
relationship management and total quality management under
the moderation effect of institutional pressures will be critical to
environmental performance, and this will therefore be inﬂuential
in the adoption of environmentally friendly practices by the
rubber industry, we submit that a theoretical explanation of that
adoption phase is still underdeveloped. Theory-based empirical
studies with a focus on the period post-adoption of environmen-
tally friendly practices by the rubber industry are clearly called for.
By empirically validating a theoretically derived green supply
chain model, this study offers three major contributions to the
literature on green supply chain management.

First, the present study investigates the model under the lens of
organizational theory, in particular institutional theory, which is in
its infancy stage (Ketchen and Hult, 2007). Glover et al. (2014), in
one recent study, investigated sustainable practices across the dairy
supply chain using institutional theory perspective. The study has
provided an interesting insight into institutional pressures and their
impacts on the implementation of environmental practices.

Second, this study calls for recognition of the need for a green
supply chain model for the rubber industry; and third, we extend
the prior research on adoption of environmentally friendly prac-
tices in the manufacturing sector through an industry-speciﬁc
examination of the rubber industry. Our decision to test our
proposed model with respect to the rubber industry was guided
by two aspects. First, researchers have conducted many studies on
sectors such as automotive, automotive components, chemicals,
electronic goods manufacturing and oil & gas. However, to our
knowledge we have not come across any such studies in the context
of the rubber manufacturing sector, which is one of the largest
sectors and one of the major sources of carbon emissions after
transportation, deforestation, cement, steel and oil reﬁning. Second,
we received support from one of the Indian rubber manufacturing
companies to undertake a research project with respect to the
Indian rubber sector and its efforts towards GSCM practices. The
Indian rubber sector comprises 30 large ﬁrms, along with over 3500
classed as MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), with the
latter together accounting for more than 30 per cent of energy
consumption and thus disproportionately responsible for CO2
emissions due to obsolete technology and lack of oversight.

Based on the preceding discussions we have derived our research

objectives as:

(i) To empirically validate our proposed theoretical framework.
To empirically validate our theoretical framework, we adopt
conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA analysis helps us
to check the validity of our theoretical framework. Second, to
further test our research hypotheses, we adopt hierarchical
regression analysis (HRA) as opposed to structural equation
modeling.

(ii) To provide recommendations for the rubber industry, which is
aspiring to implement green supply chain management (GSCM)
or may already have implemented a GSCM framework.
As discussed, the focus of the present study on the rubber
industry is this paper's unique contribution. The recommenda-
tions may help the rubber industry to outline strategies to
improve their environmental performance.

(iii) To outline further research directions.

We feel that our research has its own limitations; however,
our limitations can be overcome and the research further
extended to advance the existing literature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, we will synthesize the theoretical foundations of the
study. In Section 3, we illustrate our research framework and
develop our research hypotheses accordingly. In Section 4, we
discuss the research design, including questionnaire design, pre-
testing and data collection. In Section 5, we will perform psycho-
metric properties testing and hypothesis testing. In Section 6, we
will conclude and discuss the theoretical and practical implica-
tions, as well as considering the limitations of the study and
further research directions.

2. Related research

To begin with,

it is very important to understand ‘Green
Manufacturing’ and its dimensions. There are many deﬁnitions
and arguments, but as the literature conﬁrms, the processes of
manufacturing or production create great quantities of wastes, in
the form of solids, liquids and gases, which are harmful to the
earth and to life supported by the earth. In order to minimize the
harmful effects of
these wastes, companies need to deploy
innovative manufacturing practices which blend technology, cul-
ture, leadership and policies, at an economical cost such that ﬁrms
are not overburdened with excessive costs of production which
would force them to outsource, which is the present scenario in
the western part of the world (e.g. WCED, 1987; Porter and Van der
Linde, 1995; Azzone and Noci, 1998; Sikdar and Howell, 1998;
Montalvo Corral, 2003; Van Berkel, 2007; Balan et al., 2007; Zeng
et al., 2010; Chaabane et al., 2012; Deif, 2011; De Giovanni and
Esposito Vinzi (2012); Boltic et al., 2013; Dües et al., 2013).

2.1. Dimensions of green manufacturing

Green manufacturing is associated with manufacturing produc-
tion practices which use more environmentally-friendly resources
and provide maximum output with little or no waste or pollution
in production (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2012; Baines et al., 2012).
Green manufacturing includes implementing the best resources
available to industry, which can in the long run lead to competitive
advantage by increasing efﬁciency through increasing production
quality and output at optimum cost (Fullerton et al., 2008). Green
manufacturing can lead to reduced usage of raw materials, reduc-
tion in energy consumption, fewer manufacturing steps, and lower
environmental and occupational safety expenses, along with an
improved corporate image (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995).
Challenges associated with e Interplay of Governance Mechanisms
in Complex Procurement Projecgreen manufacturing include
meeting customer demands for environmentally sound products,
development of recycling schemes, minimization of materials use,
and selection of materials with low environmental
impacts
(Florida, 1996). The practices that constitute green manufacturing
are Lean Manufacturing (e.g. Farish, 2009; Franchetti et al., 2009;
Deif, 2011; Dües et al., 2013); Total Quality Management (TQM)
(e.g. Pauli, 1997; Murovec et al., 2012; Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-
Moliner et al., 2012; Gavronski et al., 2011); Supplier Relationship
Management (SRM) (e.g. Bierma and Waterstraat, 1999; Vachon
and Klassen, 2006; Hsu and Hu, 2009; Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Ku
et al., 2010; Testa and Iraldo, 2010; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013);
Leadership (Siaminwe et al., 2005; Stone, 2006; Brown and Stone,
2007; Van Berkel, 2007; Deif, 2011; Dües et al., 2013; van Hoof and
Lyon, 2013; Despeisse et al., 2012); and Technologies for cleaner

production/green manufacturing (e.g. Sikdar and Howell, 1998;
Zhang et al., 2013; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013). Dillon and Fischer
(1992) argued that integration and understanding of production
operations and managerial functions for personnel is necessary for
green manufacturing to progress ideas. There are a few prerequi-
sites for green manufacturing, which are sometimes hard to
explain and quantify.

Due to rapid concern about global warming and pollution,
industrial practices are emerging as challenges for the global
environment (Sundarakani et al., 2010). Johansson and Winroth
(2009) conducted an empirical study with a new approach,
comparing lean manufacturing and green manufacturing. Accord-
ing to institutional theory companies sometimes, under pressure
from stakeholders, adopt practices which are environmentally
friendly and beneﬁcial to society. Mimetic isomorphism occurs
due to an uncertain environment that leads one ﬁrm to mimic
other ﬁrms' practices, which they perceive to be beneﬁcial for
their business (Kauppi, 2013; Zsidisin et al., 2005). Normative
isomorphism occurs due to professionalization, which is a product
of the educational backgrounds of the managers and legitimation
in the cognitive base (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).

Similarly, economic variants,

i.e. frequency-based imitation,
trait-based imitation and outcome-based imitation, lead towards
institutional isomorphism. Thus, economic efﬁciency and proﬁt
maximization are a better ﬁt with OM and SCM paradigms
(Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004). Without environmental aware-
ness,
it is difﬁcult to implement green practices. Regulatory,
competitive, and marketing pressures have led to increased
environmental awareness and are the drivers of green supply
chain management (GSCM) (Zhu et al., 2005; Sarkis et al., 2011).
For example, Chinese manufacturers have taken proactive mea-
sures in closing the supply chain loop by adopting GSCM practices.
From the preceding discussion, we can see the importance of
concepts like lean manufacturing, TQM, supplier relationship,
training and development, and leadership. Lean manufacturing
also focuses on waste minimizations. The concept has its root in
the Toyota Production Systems (TPS), and revolutionized the
manufacturing practices during the 1960s and 1970s. By the
1990s almost every leading manufacturing company had
embraced lean manufacturing as a strategy. However, with the
passage of time the quality of product became the foremost
objective of the companies and soon their focus shifted to
customer satisfaction. In spite of several similarities, the TQM
literature is different from lean literature in terms of scope,
concept and methodologies (Anvari et al., 2011). However, TQM
scores over lean manufacturing in terms of its holistic view.
It focuses on customers and includes every aspect of an organiza-
tion. Second,
lean manufacturing fails to offer any concrete
solution when demand or supply uncertainty is high. In such
scenario the TQM philosophy is at least not constrained due to
environmental uncertainty. However, we are not underestimating
the merit of lean manufacturing. In our context, keeping the
present demand and supply uncertainty and customer's interest
in mind, we prefer TQM philosophy over lean manufacturing. The
supplier relationship is an integral constituent of both TQM and
lean manufacturing. Past research supports the positive impacts
of supplier relationship management on GSCM implementation
(e.g. Ku et al., 2010; Testa and Iraldo, 2010; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013).
The role of leadership is pivotal to such initiatives, where output and
the beneﬁts realized may not be tangible.

2.2. TQM and its impact on green manufacturing practices

Besterﬁeld (1995) deﬁned TQM as both a philosophy and a set of
guiding principles that represents the foundation of a continuously
improving organization. It integrates fundamental management

techniques, existing improvement efforts and technical tools under
a disciplined approach. In a seminal article, Zhu and Sarkis (2004)
investigated the impact of quality management, as one of their
constructs, on green supply chain practices. According to Newman
and Hanna (1996), integration of TQM with environmental issues
may have a pervasive impact on operations management. Just as
TQM pursues global solutions to other quality problems, it offers
mechanisms for ﬁnding global solutions to the environmental
quandary of today's manufacturers (Pun, 2006). In recent years
the integration of TQM and environmental issues has attracted
major attention from researchers (e.g. Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-
Moliner et al., 2012; Gavronski et al., 2011). In our study we have
identiﬁed one of the operational practices which may impact green
manufacturing practices.

2.3. SRM and its impact on green manufacturing practices

In recent years, SRM has attracted huge interest among
academia and practitioners. Companies who want to successfully
integrate manufacturing with environmental issues should be able
to ﬁnd suppliers who have minimized their environmental impact
without reducing the quality of their product or raising costs
signiﬁcantly (Luthra et al., 2013). SRM results in lower inventory
level, cost and higher accuracy (Luthra et al., 2010). The green
suppliers can be the greatest assets of the organization, but poor
choice can make them the greatest liability also (Agarwal and
Vijayvargy, 2012).

2.4. SRM, TQM and green manufacturing practices

(e.g. Bierma

in western economies

Supplier relationship management with partners has played a
pivotal role in the successful implementation of green manufac-
turing practices
and
Waterstraat, 1999; Vachon and Klassen, 2006; Hsu and Hu,
2009; Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Ku et al., 2010; Testa and Iraldo,
2010; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013), and even Indian manufacturers
have realized the potential beneﬁts of supplier relationship man-
agement (e.g. Thakkar et al., 2008; Mohanty and Gahan, 2012).
However, the role of supplier relationship management in imple-
mentation of green supply chain practices in India needs to be
further studied. Further, in recent years, ﬁrms in western countries
that have integrated TQM philosophy with green manufacturing
practices have shown superior performance (e.g. Pauli, 1997;
Murovec et al., 2012; Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al.,
2012; Gavronski et al., 2011).

2.5. Green manufacturing leads to superior ﬁrm performance

That green manufacturing has helped ﬁrms to achieve superior
performance is supported by the literature (e.g. Pauli, 1997; Farish,
2009; Franchetti et al., 2009; Deif, 2011; Murovec et al., 2012;
Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012; Gunasekaran and
Spalanzani, 2012; Dües et al., 2013; Gavronski et al., 2011). The
literature deﬁnes performance as the combination of environmen-
tal performance (e.g. reduction in CO2, SO2, NOx; converting waste
into more useful products; reuse or recycling after use; increase in
product quality; increase in customer satisfaction) and business
performance (e.g. increase in market share; increase in proﬁt-
ability; increase in ROI; increase in ROA; improvement in inven-
tory turnover, etc.).

However, in the present study we will conﬁne our research to
environmental performance. We have identiﬁed literatures which
have supported green supply chain management practices and
their positive impact on environmental performance (e.g. Zhu et al.,
2005; Zhu et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011; Bhateja et al., 2012; Seman
et al. (2012); Gangele and Verma (2011); Whitelock, 2012).

2.6. Research gaps

Though previous studies have indicated the importance of the
integration of TQM and SCM to achieving competitive advantage
(e.g. Kanji and Wong, 1999; Gunasekaran and McGaughey, 2003;
Tutuncu and Kucukusta, 2008; Vanichchinchai and Igel, 2009;
Talib et al., 2010), nevertheless there is a scarcity of studies which
have studied the combined effects of TQM and SRM on supply
chain network design which is environmentally friendly. Second,
the moderation effect of institutional pressures has been studied
in GSCM networks by Zhu and Sarkis (2007); however the
moderation effect of institutional pressures on SRM and TQM to
inﬂuence environmental performance at aggregated level was not
explored. Consequently, there is need for such studies in the
context of green supply chain network design.

3. Theoretical framework and hypotheses development

Supplier relationship management is pivotal to the success of a
green purchasing programme. The ﬁrm has to form a bond with
their suppliers and motivate them to supply eco-friendly and non-
hazardous raw materials, for example by training and educating
them to adopt ISO 14001:2004. Firms which create pressure on
their suppliers and review periodically to monitor progress are
seen to adopt green practices successfully. Supplier collaboration
results in developing eco-friendly products faster than relying
solely on the in-house R&D team. Good partnership practices
create transparency and hence the costs involved in developing
the eco-friendly raw materials are visible, and therefore the risk of
over spending is reduced. Motivating suppliers to maintain inven-
tory at their works and issuing an open purchase order/contract so
that the material is supplied in time to meet the production
demand saves inventory carrying cost of ﬁrm.
In one of the
seminal works in this area, Kanji and Wong (1999) proposed a
‘business excellence model for SCM’ where they investigated how
leadership drives TQM initiatives to improve collaboration to
achieve superior performance in a supply chain network. We
would like to further investigate this model under the moderation
effect of institutional pressures (e.g. Zhu and Sarkis, 2007; Wu
et al., 2012). Consequently, we propose a theoretical framework as
shown in Fig. 1.

3.1. Leadership

Top management of different supply chain members of a
supply chain network, from supplier's supplier through manufac-
turers, transporters, distributors and retailers, must align their
objectives in the direction of customer interest, therefore taking
environmental factors into consideration. Kanji and Wong (1998,
1999) consider leadership as the base of the pyramid in the TQM
model. Leadership has been identiﬁed as a driver of TQM philo-
sophy (e.g. Beer, 2003; Lakshman, 2006; Karaszewski, 2010; Rui
et al., 2010) as it helps in building a quality culture and fostering

collaboration among supply chain network partners (Gunasekaran,
1999; Yusuf et al., 2007). Leadership is key driver of GSCM
initiatives. Sharif and Irani (2012), in one of their research studies,
outlined how leadership can help an organization to successfully
achieve environmental performance in a supply chain network.
Leadership is about establishing environmental policies and goals
to provide resources and training, and to stimulate improvement.
It involves establishing practices with a long term vision for the
ﬁrm, driven by changing customer requirements; as opposed to
internal management control. We therefore hypothesize the
following:

H1. Leadership positively impacts TQM implementation;

H2. Leadership positively impacts SRM with supply chain partners.

3.2. Supplier relationship management (SRM)

The collaborative partnership among supply chain partners in a
supply chain network improves coordination (Kanji and Wong,
1999) and reduces bull-whip effect in the network (Lee et al.,
1997). Supply chain collaboration is deﬁned as shared efforts to
achieve common goal (Cannella and Ciancimino, 2010). Relation-
ship management across the supply chain network has helped
ﬁrms to achieve green objectives like reducing carbon emissions
across the supply chain network (Aberdeen Group, 2008; van den
Broek and van den Broek-Serlé, 2010), helps in TQM implementa-
tion (Gunasekaran, 1999; Mahapatra and Khan, 2006) and also
assists in the successful implementation of green practices in the
supply chain network (Bierma and Waterstraat, 1999; Vachon and
Klassen, 2006; Hsu and Hu, 2009; Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Ku et al.,
2010; Testa and Iraldo, 2010; van Hoof and Lyon, 2013). Supplier
relationship management is about involving suppliers in decision
making, technological development and meeting customer expec-
tations through collaboration. It includes information, risk and
proportionate proﬁt sharing. We therefore hypothesize:

H3. SRM positively impacts TQM implementation;

H4. SRM positively impacts environmental performance.

3.3. Total quality management

Total Quality Management is a philosophy according to which a
ﬁrm aims to deliver quality products or services to customers.
TQM is a continuous process of improvement for individuals,
groups of people and whole ﬁrms; it encompasses a set of four
principles (delight the customer, management by fact, people-
based management, and continuous improvement) and eight core
concepts (customer satisfaction, internal customers are real, all
work is process, measurement, teamwork, people make quality,
continuous improvement cycle, and prevention) (Kanji and Wong,
1998).
It can be concluded that TQM is a philosophy and a
systematic activity to improve the value and quality of the
products and services offered to customers through maximization
of the potential of all stakeholders. In the past, researchers have
highlighted the role of TQM in helping ﬁrms to achieve green
objectives by reducing wastage, recycling wastes and reducing
carbon emissions (e.g. Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al.,
2012; Gavronski et al., 2011). Wiengarten and Pagell (2012), in one
of their research studies, highlighted the importance of quality
management practices on environmental performance. TQM mea-
sures the ability to improve product quality, improve coordination
and reduce variability across the supply chain network. It helps to
build a mind-set among the partners across the network which
aims to reduce cost by minimizing wastages resulting from
transport, overproduction and defects. We therefore hypothesize:


124

R. Dubey et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 160 (2015) 120–132

H5. TQM positively impacts environmental performance.

3.4. Moderation effect of institutional pressures

Recent years have seen an increasing role of institutional
theory in the ﬁelds of OM and SCM (Kauppi, 2013). According to
Scott (2008), institutional theory suggests that external forces
motivate ﬁrms to undertake similar strategic actions. Under institu-
tional theory, ﬁrms are not only proﬁt-seeking entities, but also
recognize the importance of achieving social legitimacy (Suchman,
1995). Institutional theory has two main forms, an economic variant
and a social variant (Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004). The mechan-
isms identiﬁed are coercive, mimetic and normative, which lead
towards institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).
The coercive mechanism consists of formal or informal pressures
created on ﬁrms by other ﬁrms on which they are dependent and
by expectations from the society (Kauppi, 2013; DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983).

GSCM can be used as an environmental tool to improve the
ﬁrm's environmental image and gain competitiveness within the
international business arena (Zhu et al., 2008). Greening any
supply chain involves institutionalizing environmental principles
in the design and operation of the supply chain. We have already
described the importance of environmental principles for achiev-
ing eco-efﬁciency and building environmentally friendly organiza-
tions, and emphasis is placed on the application of such principles
in the product lifecycle (Tsoulfas and Pappis, 2006). It is very
important for any practising manager to understand the links
between GCSM practices, and environmental and economic per-
formance for successful GSCM implementation. Environmental
pressure act as a driver for successful GSCM practices. Market
and regulatory pressures, including environmental pressures, help
an organization to improve as they are believed to inﬂuence
eco-design and green purchasing. Manufacturers facing greater
regulatory pressures tend to implement green purchasing and
investment recovery policies. Competitive pressure signiﬁcantly
improves the economic beneﬁts available from adoption of differ-
ent GSCM practices (Zhu et al., 2007). In one study Wong et al.
(2012) studied the moderation effect of environmental manage-
ment and green operations on manufacturing ﬁrm performance.
However, we further extend this research from an institutional
theory perspective.
Institutional pressure drives organizations
to adopt environmental management initiatives; for example,
Wu et al. (2012) studied the impact of GSCM drivers on GSCM
practices under the moderation effect of institutional pressures,
with reference to Taiwan's textile industry. Hence, we submit that
institutional pressures have a moderation effect on the impact of
SRM and TQM on environmental performance. However, one can
argue that there are reasons why institutional pressure is not
regarded as a mediating variable. Very often researchers get
confused between moderating, mediating and controllable vari-
ables. However, a proper understanding and critical review further
helps to resolve the conﬂicts. Similarly,
in our case we have
enough literature which supports the moderation role of institu-
tional pressure. In a study Kennedy and Fiss (2009) explored the
motivation behind implementation of TQM in an organization.
Liu et al. (2010) investigated the moderation effect of institutional
pressures on ﬁrm intention to implement internet-based supply
chain. Rogers et al., (2007) investigated the supplier development
programme from an institutional theory perspective. Institutional
Pressure measures the coercive, mimetic and normative pressures
which drive GSCM adoption. It is measured in terms of regulatory
pressure, market pressure, brand consciousness and proﬁt motive,
which lead to institutional isomorphism. Based on our discussions
we therefore hypothesize that:

H6. Institutional pressures have moderation effect on SRM impact
on environmental performance.

H7. Institutional pressures have moderation effect on TQM impact
on environmental performance.

Here, we consider three dimensions which shape institutional
theory, i.e. coercive pressure, normative pressure and mimetic
pressure (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). The coercive isomorphism
is due to both formal and informal pressures exerted on organiza-
tions by other organizations (e.g. buyers, government agencies,
regulatory norms etc.) due to expectations from society (DiMaggio
and Powell, 1983). In situations where buyers are strong and
supply market strength is low, a company can exercise coercion to
serve its own interest by demanding that partners adopt its
favorable operational practices (Kraljic, 1983; Liu et al., 2010).
Companies are under pressures from government, customers and
other stakeholders to implement best practices. Normative iso-
morphism occurs as a result of professionalization, which is
deﬁned as “the collective struggle of members of an occupation
to deﬁne the working conditions and their methods to work and in
future guide the future professionals through legitimacy” (Liang
et al., 2007). Mimetic isomorphism results from the mimicking
action of other organizations' actions. An organization mimics the
actions of others when there is lack of clarity in organizational
goals, where there is environmental uncertainty, or where the
technology is not well understood (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;
Liang et al., 2007).

Coercive isomorphism is due to external pressures created by
stakeholders (e.g. buyers, government agencies, regulatory norms
etc.) due to varying expectations from society (DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983). In order to live up to the expectations of the
stakeholders, the top management completely mediates between
coercive isomorphism and supplier relationship management
practices in a green supply chain network. Zhu et al. (2007)
investigated the impact of coercive pressures on top management
behaviors, which play a critical role in formulating procurement
policies in line with institutional norms. We therefore can further
hypothesize as follows:

H6a. Coercive pressure has moderation effect on SRM impact on
SRM impact;

H7a. Coercive pressure has moderation effect on TQM impact on
environmental performance.

Normative isomorphism arises due to professional codes,
which expect professionals to follow very speciﬁc guidelines. We
have discussed in our preceding section how top management
plays a linking role in implementing professional codes and how,
through proper training and regular workshops, young managers
assimilate the professionalization.
In our study we therefore
assume the complete mediation role of top management in
translating normative pressures into supplier relationship man-
agement practices in a green supply chain network. We therefore
hypothesize this as:

H6b. Normative pressure has moderation effect on SRM impact on
SRM impact;

H7b. Normative pressure has moderation effect on TQM impact
on environmental performance.

Mimetic isomorphism results results from mimicking action
of an organization. When an organization lacks clarity in terms of
goals, or environmental uncertainty is high (i.e. high demand
uncertainty, high supply uncertainty and high technology uncer-
tainty), in such a situation the top management tends to replicate
the existing trend in the industry. Thus the supplier relationship

125

management practices of such organizations are aligned as per
existing current practices in similar organizations. We therefore
hypothesize based on our preceding discussions as follows:

H6c. Mimetic pressure has moderation effect on SRM impact on
SRM impact;

H7c. Normative pressure has moderation effect on TQM impact on
environmental performance.

3.5. Environmental performance

Environmental performance measures the ability of the ﬁrm
to reduce carbon dioxide, SO2, NOx and other harmful gas
emissions resulting from activities across the supply chain net-
work. Environmental performance is deﬁned as the relationship
between the organization and the environment. It includes the
environmental effects of resources consumed, the environmental
impacts of the organizational process, the environmental impli-
cations of its products and services, the recovery and processing
of products and meeting legal environmental requirements.
The environmental initiatives include ISO 14000 certiﬁcation,
pollution prevention, recycling of materials, and waste reduction
(Schoenherr, 2012).

4. Research design

4.1. Questionnaire design

In developing a questionnaire with which to conduct the
survey, we began with a review of the extensive literature on
the ﬁve main concepts – which included leadership, relationship
management with their partners, TQM, institutional pressures and
environmental performance – to identify the key issues, and
developed a draft measurement instrument based on those used
by other researchers. In the ﬁeld of quality management, a number
of researchers have used questionnaire surveys as instruments for
empirical study. These included, for example, Kanji and Wong
(1999), Vachon and Klassen (2006), Hsu and Hu (2009), Bai and
Sarkis (2010), Zhu and Sarkis (2007), Flynn et al. (1994), Kauppi
(2013), DiMaggio and Powell (1983), Saraph et al. (1989), Kaynak
(2003) and Blauw and During (1990). Resulting from the intensive
literature review, the questionnaire is consolidated into two
sections:

Section 1: Includes questions on indicators of leadership, TQM,
relationship management with their partners and institutional
pressures. This section has 25 items in total. The objective of this
section is to gauge the perceptions of the practitioners who were
our target respondents. The respondents were asked to rate on a
ﬁve-point Likert scale (where 1¼Strongly Disagree and 5¼
Strongly Agree).

Section 2: Includes questions on environmental performance.
It has six items. The objective of this section is to gauge the
perceptions of the respondents, who are environmental managers
in their respective companies. Respondents were asked to rate
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (where 1¼Strongly Disagree, and
5¼Strongly Agree).

4.2. Measures

Measures were adopted or modiﬁed from scales established in
extant research to avoid scale proliferation. We used multi-item
measures of constructs for our proposed theoretical framework in
order to improve reliability, reduce measurement error, ensure
greater variability among survey individuals and improve validity
(Churchill, 1979). Each construct was operationalized using at least

three items for measurement and analyzed using conﬁrmatory
factor analysis (Hair et al., 2006; Anderson and Gerbing, 1988).
The items included in the ﬁnal questionnaire were pretested
with six experts drawn from industry and academia to check the
content validity. We have incorporated all the suggestions of the
experts. The suggestions were mainly related to the wording of
the questionnaire and some items regarding relationships with
partners. We did not disclose constructs to the respondents to
eliminate respondent bias, as we will discuss in the data
collection section. We have presented our constructs, their
measures and literature support in a tabulated form as shown
in Table 1 as:

Indicators representing independent variables in our frame-
work were captured using a 5-point Likert scale, from strongly
disagree to strongly agree. Additional control variables were used
to account for extraneous effects – speciﬁcally, ﬁrm size as the
dummy variable (Chen and Paulraj, 2004). In our case we have not
taken into consideration the nature of
the industry, as we
restricted our study to the rubber and rubber equipment manu-
facturing sector.

4.3. Sampling

information provided by All

There are over 3500 licensed rubber goods manufacturing
ﬁrms in India which are practising green supply chain practices,
based on initial
India Rubber
Association (AIRA). Target respondents are senior managers of
each ﬁrm. We estimated our target sample size using the
formula of Yamne (1967) , according to which we determined
a sample size of roughly 358 to give a 95 per cent conﬁ-
dence level.

However, other recent studies in the OM and SCM area (e.g.
Schoenherr and Mabert, 2011; Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009)
have demonstrated that a sample size of 150 is sufﬁcient to test
research hypotheses (Hair et al., 2006).

4.4. Data collection

Data was collected through an electronic survey, using a split
survey method (Podsakoff et al., 2003). In our case, we divided the
questionnaire into two parts. The ﬁrst part of the questionnaire
consisted of items related to leadership, supplier relationship
management, TQM and institutional pressure (i.e. regulatory
norms and market pressure); the second part consisted of items
related to environmental performance.

The survey was sent to targeted individuals in procurement
departments to respond to questions related to their relationships
with partners. These individuals were requested to pass on the
remaining questions to their colleagues from quality and human
resource departments to complete the questions related to TQM,
leadership and institutional pressures. The second part of the
questionnaire was sent to environmental managers of the same
ﬁrms, as they are more knowledgeable about questions related to
environmental performance. The split survey method allowed us
to address the most informed respondents to answer our ques-
tions. Prior
respondents were assured that
responses would not be revealed.

to questioning,

Our initial survey frame consisted of 358 ﬁrms situated
throughout India and was compiled from a database provide by
All India Rubber Association (AIRA). This database was chosen to
reach a high number of executives of sufﬁcient seniority and
knowledge to answer the split survey. Data collection was con-
ducted using a modiﬁed version of Dillman's (2007) total design
method. Overall, we received 187 complete and usable responses
for the ﬁrst part and 174 complete and usable responses for the
second part. The ﬁrm response rate is therefore 187/358¼52.23%

and the split survey ratio is 174/187¼93.04%. Here, the split ratio
is relatively high but the response rate was slightly lower than we
initially expected. However, the sample size is sufﬁcient enough to
test the research hypotheses developed in this study (Hair et al.,
2006), and is comparable to the response rate achieved in other
recent research investigating supply chain and operations man-
agement topics. As the questionnaire was part of a larger research
project which ran to 6 pages in total, this may explain the below-
average response rate. During our follow up with respondents who
were senior managers, they revealed that they are quite reluctant
to engage in external surveys. They revealed that in recent years,
companies in India have formulated policies not to respond to any
external survey that is not routed through proper channels. Over-
all, 36.3 per cent of the total respondents belonged to top
management and 63.7 per cent to middle management. The
proﬁles of the respondents are shown in Table 2.

4.5. Non-response bias

Non-response bias is the difference between the responses of
the early respondents and late respondents (Lambert and
Harrington, 1990). Some of the eminent statisticians and experts
in survey methods (e.g. Armstrong and Overton, 1977) have
provided the scientiﬁc argument behind conducting non-
response bias testing, irrespective of response rate. To account
for non-response bias, we have compared the responses of early
and late waves of returned surveys (Armstrong and Overton, 1977;
Lambert and Harrington, 1990; Chen and Paulraj, 2004). The ﬁnal
sample was ranked according to the dates the responses were
received and split into equally sized groups. We compared the ﬁrst
30 per cent of respondents (early-wave group) against the last 30
per cent of respondents. Comparison analysis was based on eight
randomly selected variables: t-tests performed on the two groups
yielded no statistically signiﬁcant differences (at 95% conﬁdence
intervals). From this we conclude that non-response bias is not a
major issue.

5. Data analysis

5.1. Assessment of psychometric properties

It is pertinent to test the assumptions like constant variance,
existence of outliers and normality before we determine reliability
and validity of the measurement items. We used plots of residuals
by predicted values and statistics of skewness and kurtosis.


R. Dubey et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 160 (2015) 120–132

127

To detect multivariate outliers, we used Mahalanobis distances of
predicted variables (Stevens, 1984; Cohen et al., 2003). The
maximum absolute values of the skewness and kurtosis of the
items were found to be 1.496 and 1.169, respectively. These values
are well within the limits recommended by past research (uni-
variate skewnesso2, kurtosiso7) (Curran et al., 1996). For testing
multivariate normality, we applied Mardia's (1970) coefﬁcients of
multivariate skewness and kurtosis, which were found to be non-
signiﬁcant (po0.05), indicating multivariate normality. Neither
the plots nor the statistics indicated any signiﬁcant deviances from
assumptions.

5.1.1. Exploratory factor analysis

First, we conducted factor analysis by entering all variables
used in analysis into principal component analysis (varimax
rotation). The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sample adequacy
is 0.73. The test reduced all the variables into ﬁve independent
parsimonious factors with Eigen's value greater than 1.0, explain-
ing 68.6% of the total variance. The ﬁrst latent variable explained
nearly 27.53% of the total variance, thus common method bias is
not a serious issue. Furthermore, all four factors contained vari-
ables which were apparently interpretable. The solution was
viable. We have further attempted to give a meaning to the stable
structure as shown in Table 3. Variables with higher loadings were
considered more important and have greater inﬂuence on the
name or label selected to present a factor (Hair et al., 2006).

Scale

Items

5.1.2. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis

After we had checked the assumptions, we used conﬁrmatory
factor analysis to establish convergent validity and discriminant
validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Table 3 provides values of
standardized factor loadings (λ), scale composite reliability (SCR)
and average variance extracted (AVE).

The Table 3 output suggests that standardized factor loadings of
indicators,SCR and AVE are well above than speciﬁed lower value
(i.e. λi should be ideally greater than 0.7 and must be Z0.5,
SCRZ0.7 and AVEZ0.5).

We can therefore conclude that constructs of our theoretical
framework possess convergent validity. To determine discriminant
validity, we have derived inter-factors correlation matrix and
modiﬁed it as per (Fornell and Larcker 1981), suggestions as shown
in Table 4.

From Table 4, we can see that the absolute values for entries
marked (nn) (correlation coefﬁcient) are lower than the absolute
value of square root of AVE entries (n). This suggests that the
constructs possess discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker,
1981). We have also estimated the ﬁt indices for the overall
measurement model; Normed Chi-Square¼0.6, which suggests
that χ2/dfr2, represent a better ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1999). There
are other indices like RMSEA which was found 0.08 which suggest
that model is a better ﬁt.

5.2. Hypotheses tests

We tested our research hypotheses using hierarchical regres-
sion analysis. This technique is considered most appropriate and a
more conservative technique, as opposed to the covariance-based
method, due to the complexity of the model and available data
points, and the great robustness of the technique (Gefen et al.,
2000). We present our hierarchical regression analysis output in
Table 5.

The hierarchical regression analysis output shows that each
linkage of the theoretical framework under the effect of the
controlling variable, e.g. size of the ﬁrm in terms of employees,
is supported statistically. The R2 values for each research hypoth-
esis are found to be between 0.586 and 0.796, with F-statistics
well above critical value Fcr (2172)¼3, shows that model is very
strong. The VIF statistic is found to be less than 4, which suggests
that the hierarchical regression output is free from multicollinear-
ity effect (Hair et al., 2006); and Durbin–Watson statistic is found
to be between 1.5 and 2.5, which suggests the hierarchical
regression output
(Field,
2005).The unstandardized β co-efﬁcient of path (L-TQM) is
0.957, which is found to be statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05),
indicating that leadership is a positive determinant of successful
implementation of TQM. The results clearly support previous
ﬁndings (e.g. Kanji and Wong 1999; Rui et al., 2010).

is free from auto-correlation effect

In the case of the second hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁ-
cient of path (L-SRM) is 0.953, which is statistically signiﬁcant at
(po0.05), indicating that leadership is signiﬁcantly important for
building supplier relationship management. The top management
commitment towards building SRM may help to improve colla-
boration to achieve the objective of minimizing the impact of poor
coordination in supply chain network design and achieving a more
sustainable network without sacriﬁcing their proﬁt margin. This
result clearly supports the previous ﬁndings (e.g. Gunasekaran,
1999; Reichheld, 2003; Yusuf et al., 2007; Dües et al., 2013; van
Hoof and Lyon, 2013; Despeisse et al., 2012).
For the third hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁcient of path
(SRM-TQM), is 0.749 which is statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05),
suggesting that SRM is a positive determinant of successful TQM
implementation. The ﬁrm may achieve better results, in terms of
customer satisfaction by offering better quality products or services,
through supplier collaboration at minimum cost. The result supports
previous ﬁndings (e.g. Gunasekaran, 1999; Yusuf et al., 2007;
Wiengarten and Pagell, 2012).

Regarding the fourth hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁcient
of path (SRM-EP) is 0.474, statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05),
suggesting that the ﬁrm may achieve superior environmental
performance which can be measured in terms of reduction in
solid waste generation, helping to meet CPCB norms, reducing
health and environmental hazards, reducing emissions of harmful
gases, reducing raw materials costs and helping to save energy.
The statistical ﬁnding clearly supports other recent ﬁndings (e.g.
Seman et al., 2012; Gangele and Verma, 2011; Whitelock, 2012;
Kim et al., 2011).
For the ﬁfth hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁcient of path
(TQM-EP) is 0.530, statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05), suggest-
ing that ﬁrms which have implemented TQM may achieve super-
ior environmental performance. TQM fosters cooperation among
supply chain partners (Kanji and Wong, 1999; Gunasekaran and
McGaughey, 2003; Talib et al., 2010) and leads to superior supply
chain performance. Our ﬁndings suggest that TQM is a positive
and signiﬁcant determinant of environmental performance clearly
supports previous ﬁndings (e.g. Pauli, 1997; Murovec et al., 2012;
Prajogo et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012; Gavronski et al.,
2011).

In our sixth hypothesis and seventh hypothesis we have three
sub-hypotheses. However, our exploratory factor analysis suggests
that all the three institutional pressures identiﬁed by DiMaggio
and Powell (1983) and subsequently further supported by other
researchers (e.g. Zhu and Sarkis, 2007; Sarkis et al., 2011) are
loaded on a single factor. Thus we reclassiﬁed all three pressures
as a single pressure (i.e. institutional pressure).
For the sixth hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁcient of path
(IP*SRM-EP) is 0.135, statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05), sug-
gesting that SRM has a positive impact under the moderation
effect of institutional pressure (i.e. the coercive pressure, the
normative pressure and mimetic pressure loaded on a single
factor), which suggests that market pressure and regulatory norms
have positive impacts. SRM focuses on improving coordination in
supply chain networks through information sharing and collabora-
tion improves environmental performance by reducing solid waste
generation and helps in mitigating risk due to harmful emissions
of gases like CO2, NOx, SOx and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)
which can be generated by the rubber industry. Inherent problems
can be rectiﬁed if procurement policies can be aligned with
environmental norms. For this, leaders of both companies need
to assess the win-win situation and sensitize their team members
to adapt to the global need for environmentally friendly products.
This ﬁnding of ours supports the ﬁndings of Zhu and Sarkis (2007),
Zhu et al. (2012a,b).
For the seventh hypothesis, unstandardized β coefﬁcient of
path (IP*TQM-EP) is 0.112, statistically signiﬁcant at (po0.05),
suggesting that TQM has a positive impact under the moderation
effect of institutional pressure, which suggests that market pres-
sure and regulatory norms have positive impacts. However, an
interesting observation can be made based on the moderation
regression output; the relative difference between the magnitude
of unstandardized β co-efﬁcient of path (TQM-EP) is negative, i.e.

the impact of TQM on EP was more pronounced than the impact of
TQM on EP under the moderation effect of institutional pressure
(IP). However, in recent years TQM has been regarded as a guiding
principle of the ﬁrm, and as such TQM is often implemented long
before the ﬁrm realizes the need for a sustainable supply chain.
Those ﬁrms that have implemented TQM successfully have found
themselves in a more comfortable position to achieve a sustain-
able supply chain network. However, we do not deny the initial
impact of regulatory and market pressures on the implementation
of TQM to achieve superior environmental performance.
It is
therefore crystal clear that ﬁrms who have implemented TQM
will achieve superior quality, which further leads them to achieve
the more recently established goal, i.e. superior EP. The ﬁndings of
our study further support the research ﬁndings of, Wiengarten and
Pagell (2012).

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we empirically investigated the links between
leadership, SRM, TQM and environmental performance in green
supply chain or sustainable supply chain network design. More-
over, we further examined the moderation effect of IP on links
connecting SRM and EP, and TQM and EP, respectively, under the
effect of controllable variables such as the size of the ﬁrm. Our
work further strengthens and reﬁnes empirical work on the
integration of SRM and TQM in a green supply chain network
and on the application of institutional theory in the ﬁelds of OM
and SCM, answering previous calls for research (Talib et al., 2011;
Kauppi 2013). Overall, our study helps to test, empirically, the
‘Business Excellence Model for Supply Chain Management’ (Kanji
and Wong, 1999), and the model of Gunasekaran and McGaughey
(2003) in the context of green supply chain network design or the
sustainable supply chain, tests which are necessary at this time. In
addition, we have attempted to understand the possible linkage
between institutional theory and GSCM theory.

6.1. Unique contributions

6.1.1.

Implications and contributions to theory

With this study, we provide further evidence that supplier
relationship management and TQM integration under the inﬂu-
ence of leadership and moderation effect of institutional pressures
(IP) may help ﬁrms, as one of their goals, to achieve environmental
performance. The role of institutional pressures in affecting adop-
tion of green supply chain practices is well discussed in the
literature (e.g. Zhu et al., 2005; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007; Wu et al.,
2012). What is less well understood is how institutional pressures
affect the process of integration of leadership, supplier relation-
ship management and total quality management on environmen-
tal performance. Three key aspects of this study signify our
contribution to the theory of green supply chain management.
First, the study attempts to focus on post-implementation of green
supply chain management practices in the context of the supply
chain network. These ﬁndings extend the past work of e.g. Kanji
and Wong (1999), Gunasekaran and McGaughey (2003) and Talib
et al. (2011). The present study ﬁndings further support the studies
of, for example, Wiengarten and Pagell (2012) and Wu et al.
(2012).

Second, this study integrates institutional pressures and the
inﬂuence of leadership on operational practices to improve envir-
onmental performance in one model, and reconciles inﬂuences
that the literature had previously presumed to be independent.
In the extant literature, top management, institutional pressures
and operational practices are rarely studied together. Further, our

study supports the ﬁndings of Sharif and Irani (2012). It further
extends environmental supply chain leadership theory.

Third, we have further empirically tested our proposed model
from data collected from the rubber industry. Our study has
provided an interesting revelation. In our ﬁndings we have seen
that all three institutional pressures were found to be loaded on a
single factor and the items of mimetic pressures were dropped due
to low standardized factor loadings (i.e.o0.5). In the case of the
rubber industry the regulatory and normative pressures are
signiﬁcant in comparison to mimetic pressures. To our knowledge
this is ﬁrst study focusing on the rubber industry, where an
empirical study was conducted to investigate the integration of
SRM and TQM in a green supply chain network.

Thus, we contribute to the literature by addressing the need to
obtain a more holistic understanding of the distinct relationships
among competencies (i.e. leadership, SRM); response alternatives
(i.e. TQM); and performance outcomes
(i.e. environmental
performance).

6.1.2.

Implications and contributions to practice

Many of our ﬁndings offer guidance to management and supply
chain practitioners. By conducting this empirical study, we estab-
lished evidence, beyond the anecdotal, that ﬁrms indeed beneﬁt
from SRM and TQM integration under the inﬂuence of leadership
in green supply chain networks. Thereby, we provide insights for
managers into supply chain sustainability and quality manage-
ment. Moreover, our results strengthen the notion of those
managers who believe in the integration of TQM and SCM for
improving environmental performance for achieving sustainability
of the supply chain network. It also helps to resolve the debate in
the mind of those managers who believe in TQM for quality and
SRM for better coordination. However, if the SRM competency of
the ﬁrm is integrated with the guiding philosophy of the ﬁrm, i.e.
TQM, the ﬁrm can achieve superior environmental performance by
reducing emissions of harmful gases and reducing wastage in the
entire supply chain network, preventing waste which is non-
recyclable and the disposal of which will lead to further environ-
mental degradation.

We appreciate that the idea of recommending organizations to
align leadership with operational practices, under the moderation
effect of institutional pressures, sounds ill-advised because most of
the literature in green supply chain management has critically
argued that institutional pressures is not sufﬁcient enough to
explain the divergent nature of organizational change (e.g. Zhu
et al., 2005; Delmas and Toffel, 2010). However, it should be noted
that our ﬁndings are based on those rubber manufacturing units
that had already invested signiﬁcant resources in green supply
chain practices. Therefore our study is most relevant for such
companies who want to embrace green supply chain practices in
developing countries. From this perspective we view institutional
pressures as positive and beneﬁcial to those rubber manufacturing
units struggling to reap beneﬁts from their failed endeavors in
embracing “green” in their supply chain network.

6.2. Limitations and further research directions

As with any research, our study is subject to several limitations
that need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the
results. Based on the legal structure of the ﬁrms in our sample and
related conﬁdentiality requirements concerning corporate infor-
mation, we did not have the ability to collect a sufﬁcient amount of
subjective data, which would have been desirable, especially with
regard to environmental performance measures.

Second, we have collected data at one point of time. Conse-
quently, causality cannot be established without longitudinal data.

Third, the present study was conducted on the rubber industry in
an Indian context. Therefore, results may not be easily transferable
to other regions and sectors. Fourth, in our study we have selected
only an environmental performance measure as a dependent
variable. Dimensions like ﬁnancial performance and social beneﬁts
were not included. Thus, in future it is recommended to further
extend the present study based on the work of Figge and Hahn
(2012), and this can further intensify the present study.

In future, it is recommended to extend this study to other
industries, and institutional theory can further be extended by
developing scales. In the present study we have considered only
regulatory and market pressures. There is further scope to explore
more dimensions under social and economic variants of institu-
tional pressures. In this way, a more detailed investigation can be
conducted. Second, the present model can be further studied using
other performance measures, e.g. ﬁnancial performance and social
beneﬁts. Third, the present study can be further analyzed using
vested interest theory (Miller et al., 2013). Caution should be used
when generalizing our ﬁndings to other contexts in which differ-
ent leadership styles and institutional pressures emerge.
