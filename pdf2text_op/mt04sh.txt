Work locus of control and its relationship to health and  

job satisfaction from a gender perspective 

 

Summary 
With its focus on gender, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of work locus 
of control (WLC) for job satisfaction and health in the context of occupational stress. 
Data were collected from 281 women and men at both managerial and non-managerial 
level  in  a  Swedish  telecom  company.  As  hypothesized,  external  WLC  was  positively 
related  to  stressors  and  health  symptoms,  whereas  it  was  negatively  related  to  job 
satisfaction. These results applied for both women and men. Even though ANOVAS did 
not show a gender difference in WLC, the results of the hierarchical multiple regression 
analyses indicated that WLC was a significant predictor of both health symptoms and 
job satisfaction, but only for women. Besides these main effects WLC also acted as a 
moderator  in  the  stress-health  relationship  for  women.  This  indicates  that  separate 
analyses for women and men are needed in order to investigate potential gender differ-
ences that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Introduction 
 
Stress  can  be  viewed  as  a  dynamic  transactional  process  according  to  Lazarus  and 
Folkman (1984). Individuals experience stress in situations where they perceive that the 
demands in the environment exceed their capacity do deal with them. The stress process 
can  lead  to  different  forms  of  strain  affecting,  e.g.  individuals’  well-being  and  job 
satisfaction (Lu, Kao, Cooper & Spector, 2000; Kirkcaldy, Shephard & Furnham, 2002). 
In  studies  concerning  occupational  stress  there  has  been  an  increasing  interest  in  the 
potential role of generalized control beliefs (Daniels & Guppy, 1994). Individuals who 
believe  they  themselves  can  control  the  reinforcements  through  their  behavior  are 
regarded  as  having  internal  locus  of  control,  whereas  individuals  who  have  external 
locus of control believe that external forces such as luck and fate control the reinforce-
ments of their behavior (Rotter, 1966).  

Locus  of  control  is  one  of  the  most  cited  constructs  and  Rotter’s  I-E  (internal-
external)  scale  is  widely  used  in  different  studies  (Antonovsky,  1991;  Furnham  & 
Steele,  1993).  Locus  of  control  can  be  viewed  either  as  a  uni-  or  multidimensional 
construct. Uni-dimensionality refers to a global control belief, whereas multidimension-
ality indicates that people may differ in their locus of control beliefs regarding different 
areas  of  life,  e.g.  achievement  and  health  outcomes  (Hewitt  &  Flett,  1996).  Viewing 
locus  of  control  as  multidimensional  requires  the  use  of  domain-specific  measures 
instead  of  a  global  measure.  During  the  past  decade  several  scales  have  also  been 
developed  to  measure  control  beliefs  in  specific  domains  (18  scales  according  to 
Lefcourt, 1992). 

Work locus of control scale (WLCS), a domain specific measure of locus of control 
in  organizational  settings,  was  developed  by  Spector  (1988).  Locus  of  control  beliefs 
measured by the scale include rewards or outcomes such as promotions, salary increases 
and general career progress (Spector, 1988). Several studies have shown that there is an 
overlap between Rotter’s and Spector’s measures with correlations ranging between .49 
and .63 (Blau, 1993; Cvetanovski & Jex, 1994; Spector, 1988).  

The  domain  specific  measures  are  generally  considered  better  predictors  than  the 
global measure of locus of control (Lefcourt, 1992). This claim is supported by studies, 
which have indicated that WLCS is a better predictor of work behavior than the general-
ized measure of locus of control (Blau, 1993; Orpen, 1992). WLCS has been used in 
several studies concerning e.g. different performance dimensions (Blau, 1993), unem-
ployment (Cvetanovski & Jex, 1994), stress and well-being (Daniels & Guppy, 1994; Lu 
et al, 2000; Spector & O’Connell, 1994) and selection interviews (Silvester, Anderson-
Gough, Anderson, & Mohamed, 2002).  

According  to  earlier  studies  individuals  with  internal  WLC  (WLC)  tend  to  report 
higher well-being (Spector et al., 2001) and experience less stress at work (Lu et al., 
2000;  Orpen,  1992;  Ross,  1991).  Furthermore,  stressors  seem  to  have  less  effect  on 
well-being for individuals who have internal locus of control (Daniels & Guppy, 1994; 
Lu  et  al.,  2000).  Several  studies  have  also  revealed  that  internal  WLC  is  positively 
related  to  different  organizational  outcomes  such  as  motivation,  job  performance, job 
satisfaction, perception of organizational climate and organizational commitment (Blau, 
1993;  Furnham  &  Drakeley,  1993;  Lu  et  al.,  2000;  Orpen,  1992;  Ross,  1991).  The 
results  of  Cvetanovski  and  Jex’s  study  (1994)  showed  that  unemployed  people  with 
internal locus of control were more satisfied with life and also felt better both psycho-

3 


logically  and  physically  than  externals.  Besides  studying  the  main  effects  of WLC as 
reported  above,  also  the  moderating  effects  of  WLC  in  the  stress-health  relationship 
have been investigated (Lu et al., 2000; Moyle & Parkes, 1999). However, the results 
have been inconclusive. Lu et al., (2000) demonstrated that WLC can act as a modera-
tor, whereas Moyle & Parkes (1999) found that WLC had neither direct, nor moderating 
influence on psychological strain.  

The  theoretical  background  for  the  locus  of  control  construct  comes  from  social 
learning theory (Rotter, 1966). According to this theory a reinforcement strengthens an 
expectancy that a particular behavior or event will be associated with that reinforcement. 
Rotter (1966) assumed that these kinds of expectancies or beliefs could be generalized 
to different situations and therefore affect the behavioral choices an individual makes. 
Considering its theoretical basis in social learning, it could be argued that WLC can also 
change as a result of new learning experiences. Furnham and Drakeley (1993) maintain 
that those individuals who have little access to power, opportunity or material advantage 
will probably develop external expectancies. This implies that the individual’s locus of 
control  beliefs  could  develop  differently  due  to  environmental  factors.  Organizational 
level, i.e. having a managerial position might be one of the factors that could influence 
employees’  WLC  beliefs.  Those  who  have  managerial  positions  could  develop  more 
internal WLC beliefs.  

Research  on  gender  and  general  locus  of  control  beliefs  has  revealed  inconsistent 
results. Some studies indicate women to be more externally oriented than men (Gurin, 
Gurin and Morrison, 1978; Itzhaky & Ribner, 1999); some have shown contrary results 
(Jayaratne & Ivey, 1983); whereas others have found no gender differences in locus of 
control (Holder & Vaux, 1998; Lengua & Stormshak, 2000). When it comes to studies 
that have used Work locus of control scale (e.g. Blau, 1993; Orpen, 1992; Spector & 
O’Connell,  1994)  the  aspect  of  gender  has  not  been  a  primary  issue.  Since  earlier 
psychological research has often been characterized by androcentricity, as pointed out 
e.g. by Greenglass (1993), it is important to include women’s experiences in the studies. 
Gender is also a relevant variable considering the increase of women in the labor market 
in  western  societies  (Davidson  &  Burke,  2000).  In  Sweden  e.g.  nearly  50%  of  the 
workforce consists of women (SCB, 2002). Yet, the labor market is segregated, which 
means  that  women  are  more  often  found  at  the  lower  organizational  levels  than  men 
throughout Europe (Davidson & Burke, 2000). Due to women’s subordinate position in 
the labor market, it could be argued that gender differences in behavior might actually 
originate from differences in access to power. 

In sum, many of the locus of control studies in work settings have not used WLCS, 
even  though  it  is  considered  a  better  predictor  of  work behavior than the generalized 
measure of locus of control. Those studies that have used WLCS have not focused on 
gender and at the same time controlled for status differences between women and men. 
Women and men have often been studied in non-equivalent jobs and positions, therefore 
resulting in differences that might have been related to the status participants have in the 
organizations rather than their gender (Spielberger & Reheiser, 1995).  

The design of the current study, comparing women and men who worked with simi-
lar  tasks  and  at  the  same  organizational  levels,  enabled  us  to  examine  WLC  from  a 
gender perspective. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of WLC for 
job satisfaction and health in the context of occupational stress among women and men 
working  at  a  sales  division  in  a  Swedish  telecom  company.  It  was  hypothesized  that 

4 


external WLC would be positively related to stressors and health symptoms, whereas it 
would be negatively related to job satisfaction. Further, the moderating effect of WLC 
concerning health symptoms and job satisfaction were analyzed.  
 
Method 

Participants and procedure 
 
Self-administered questionnaires were distributed by mail to 422 employees in a Swe-
dish telecom company. A covering letter was enclosed informing about the purpose of 
the  study  and  that  participation  was  voluntary  and  anonymous.  Questionnaires  were 
returned  anonymously  in  a  stamped,  self-addressed  envelope.  The  studied  telecom 
company develops internet based services and products to solve communication needs 
for organizations. All the managers (45 women and 67 men) in the sales division were 
included  in  the  study.  A  random  sample  of  155  women  and  155  men  at  the  non-
managerial  level  in  the  same  division  was  selected  by  using  personnel  lists.  Two  re-
minders were sent to the participants and the final response rate was 67%.  

The  group  of participants consisted of 40 female managers, 60 male managers, 94 
female  non-managers  and  85  male  non-managers  (two  participants  had  not  specified 
their  gender).  The  average  age  of  the  participants  was  43  years  (SD  =  9.07)  and  the 
majority  of  them  (82%)  were  married  and  nearly  all  (94%)  were  working  full-time. 
Altogether  37%  of  the  participants  had  university  education.  There  were  significant 
gender  differences  in  educational  level  (F(1,  261)  =  5.30,  p  <  0.05),  and  in  years  of 
employment  (F(1,  261)  =  5.80,  p  <  0.05).    Men had university education to a higher 
extent (M = 0.46, SD = 0.50) than women (M = 0.29, SD = 0.45), whereas women had 
been employed for a longer time in the company (M = 17.20, SD = 11.57) than men (M 
=  13.85,  SD  =  12.50).  There  was  also  a  significant  difference  in  educational  level 
between  managers and non-mangers (F(1, 261) = 34.86, p < .01). Non-managers had 
university education less frequently (M = .25, SD = .43) than managers (M = .60, SD = 
.49). 
 

Study variables 
 
Demographic characteristics included in the questionnaire were gender, age (a continu-
ous variable), educational level (1 = university degree or 0 = not), organizational level 
(1 = managerial position or 0 = not), and years of employment (a continuous variable). 
Work locus of control was assessed by a Swedish version (Muhonen, 1999) of Spec-
tor’s  (1988)  WLCS.  It  contains  16  work-related  items  (e.g.  job  effort,  getting  a  job, 
promotions)  to  which  participants  respond  on  a  six-point  scale  from  1  (disagree  very 
much) to 6 (agree very much). A sample item is “Promotions are usually a matter of 
good fortune.” The scale has equal numbers of internally and externally worded items. 
Higher scores on WLCS indicate externality, which is also the case with Rotter’s (1966) 
measure. The coefficient alpha of the scale in the present study was 0.86, which is in 
accordance  with  other  studies  (Blau,  1993; Lu et al., 2000). The scores were skewed 
toward internality (M = 39.70). This is also consistent with previous studies e.g. Spector, 
1988.  Some  researchers  divide  participants  into  either  internals  or  externals,  whereas 

5 


others view the concept as a continuum ranging from high internal locus of control to 
high external locus of control (Cvetanovski & Jex, 1994; Renn & Vandenberg, 1991). 
The  second  strategy  advocated  by  both  Rotter  (Renn  &  Vandenberg,  1991)  and  P.E. 
Spector  (personal  communication,  December  20,  2002),  is  also  the  one  used  in  the 
current study.  

Stressors were measured by 11 items concerning how often participants were facing 
different demands at work (α = .70). Items about different sources of stress, e.g. quanti-
tative overload, and home–work conflict, were selected from Dallner, et al. (2000). The 
items were discussed with a group of employees and as a result modified in order to be 
relevant for the studied group. A sample item is “Is your work situation affected by poor 
planning?” Response alternatives ranged from 1 (= very rarely) to 4 (= very often).  

Health symptoms were assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), 
(Derogatis,  Lipman,  Rickels,  Uhlenhuth,  &  Covi,  1974).  HSCL  consists  of  25  items 
measuring symptoms such as headache, insomnia and anxiety (α = .94). Respondents 
rated the intensity of different symptoms on a scale ranging from 1 (= not bothered) to 4 
(= extremely bothered).  

Job satisfaction was measured by one-item global measure, namely “On the whole 
are you satisfied with your work”? Response alternatives ranged from 1 (= very rarely) 
to 4 (= very often).  
 
Results 
 
The number of participants varies in the different analyses, due to some missing values 
in the data. Since missing values were limited in number no replacement procedure was 
used. Default options in SPSS 11.5.1 were utilized in the analyses. 

Two-way ANOVAs were carried out initially in order to investigate potential differ-
ences related to gender and organizational level. The results did not show any gender 
difference  in  WLC  (F(1, 261) = 0.03, p > 0.05).  There was significant difference in 
WLC between managers and non-mangers (F(1, 261) = 25.23 p < .01). Non-managers 
scored  more  towards  internal  WLC  (M  =  41.89,  SD  =  10.91)  when  compared  with 
managers (M = 35.76, SD = 7.83). The two-way ANOVAS did not show any interaction 
effects for gender and organizational level.  
 
The main effect of WLC on health symptoms and job satisfaction 
 
Table  I  presents  the  correlations  and  descriptive  statistics  for  all  the  variables  in  the 
study separately for women and men. The results of the correlation analyses are in line 
with our hypotheses. A significant positive relationship was found between stressors and 
WLC.  Participants  with  higher  values  on  WLC  (external) also report higher levels of 
stress. External WLC was also significantly related to reporting of more health symp-
toms. WLC had a significant negative relationship to job satisfaction. This indicates that 
external WLC is associated with participants perceiving lower level of job satisfaction. 
The correlations were similar for both female and male participants.

The moderating effect of WLC on health symptoms and job satisfaction 
 
We  were  also  interested  in  investigating  the  moderating  effect  of  WLC  on  health 
symptoms  and  job  satisfaction,  when  demographics  and  stressors  were  taken  into 
consideration.  Hierarchical  multiple  regression  analyses  were  conducted  using  forced 
entry  method  (Licht,  1995).  In  order  to  reveal  potential  gender  differences,  separate 
analyses were run for women and men. Health symptoms and job satisfaction were used 
as dependent variables. Demographics, stressors, WLC and the interaction term stressors 
X WLC were used as independent variables in the multiple regression analyses.  

At  the  first  step  the  demographic  variables:  educational  level,  organizational  level 
and  years  of  employment  were  entered  in  the  equation  as  control  variables.  On  the 
second step stressors and WLC were entered into the equation. To test the interaction 
effect of stressors and WLC, the interactions term stressors X WLC was entered at the 
third step.

Table II presents the results of the multiple hierarchical regression analyses predicting 
health symptoms separately for women and men. The results showed that none of the 
demographic variables contributed to increment in explained variance in health symp-
toms. Stressors seemed to be the strongest predictor of health symptoms for both women 
and men. The results also reveal that WLC contributed to explaining variance in health 
symptoms for women, but not for men. Further, the interaction term stressors X WLC 
had  a  significant  relationship  to  women‘s  health  symptoms.  Figure  1  illustrates  the 
moderating effect for women (left) and the no moderating effect for men (right). The 
total  model explained 39% of the variance in women’s health symptoms and 42% of 
men’s health symptoms.

In  Table  III  the  results  of  the  multiple  hierarchical  regression  analyses  predicting  job 
satisfaction  for  women  and  men  can  be  seen.  The  results  showed  that  the  years  of 
employment was a significant factor for men’s job satisfaction, indicating that men with 
more years of employment were more satisfied with their jobs.  
 

Insert Table III near here 

 
Stressors  contributed  significantly  to job satisfaction for both women and men. WLC 
also contributed significantly, but only as regards women’s job satisfaction. In contrast 
to the prediction of health symptoms, the total model fitted women (R2=.31) better than 
men (R2=.21) in predicting job satisfaction. 
 
Discussion

The aim of the current study was to investigate WLC and its relationship to job satisfac-
tion and health from a gender perspective. By comparing women and men who worked 
with similar tasks and at the same organizational levels, we were able to consider gender 
and organizational status simultaneously. The results of the two-way ANOVAS showed 
neither a gender difference in WLC, nor any interaction effects for gender and organiza-
tional  level.  However,  non-managers  reported  more  external  locus  of  control  beliefs, 
which implies that status in the organization can be central for WLC. This result is in 
line  with  Furnham  and  Drakeley  (1993),  who  have  pointed  out  that  individuals  with 
little access to power might develop external control beliefs.  

In accordance with earlier studies (e.g. Daniels & Guppy, 1994; Lu et al., 2000), ex-
ternal WLC was related to reporting of a greater amount of stress at work. WLC had a 
significant negative correlation with job satisfaction and a significant positive correla-
tion with health symptoms, indicating that external WLC was associated with lower job 
satisfaction and more health symptoms. These findings are in line with earlier studies 
(Blau, 1993; Cvetanovski & Jex, 1994; Furnham & Drakeley, 1993). The correlations 
above were similar for both women and men.  

The results of the multiple regression analyses corroborated that WLC was a signifi-
cant  predictor  for  both  health  and  job  satisfaction,  but  only  for  women.  Further,  an 
interaction effect of stressors X WLC was found to be significant concerning women’s 
health.  It  appears  that  women  who  experience  high  level  of  stress  and  score  towards 
externality in WLC also report health symptoms to a greater extent. These findings were 
unexpected  since  two-way  ANOVAS  failed  to  show  any  gender  differences  in  WLC. 
Why the external WLC beliefs in combination with high level of stress appears to make 
women more vulnerable than men needs to be explored further in future studies. The 
results also indicate that separate analyses for women and men are needed in order to 
investigate potential gender differences that otherwise might not be noticed.  

There are both strengths and limitations in the current study. The design of the study 
comparing women and men in similar tasks and organizational levels and in the same 
organization could be regarded as a strength. It is an advantage to conduct a study in one 
organization, since tasks and positions can differ between different organizations, thus 
making comparisons less reliable.  

 The strengths above have concomitant limitations. The relatively small total sample 
size  and  the  fact  that  the  data  were  collected  from  only  one  organization,  limit  the 
generalizability  of  the  findings  to  other  organizations.  We  measured  job  satisfaction 
with a single-item, a procedure that is debatable but can be regarded as an acceptable 
way to measure overall job satisfaction according to Wanous, Reichers & Hudy (1997). 
Also, factors apart from WLC, e.g. coping strategies and social support, could influence 
the  stress-health  relationship  either  directly  or  indirectly  (Bellman,  Forster,  Still  & 
Cooper, 2003; Daniels & Guppy, 1994; Greenglass, 1993). Yet another limitation of the 
study is its cross-sectional design, which does not allow causal conclusions to be drawn 
on  the  basis  of  the  results.  There  is  need  for  longitudinal  studies  using  multiple 
measures in order to further investigate WLC beliefs for women and men while control-
ling for organizational status and the types of tasks performed.  

To summarize, external WLC was related to higher amounts of stress at work, lower 
job  satisfaction  and  more  health  symptoms.  Whether  these  associations  are  due  to 
dispositional WLC beliefs or if WLC beliefs are formed by external factors e.g. power 
in  the  organization,  as  pointed  out by Furnham and Drakeley (1993), needs yet to be 

8 


investigated. Further, WLC emerged as a significant predictor for both health symptoms 
and job satisfaction for women, but not for men. WLC also acted as a moderator in the 
stress-health relationship for women. The findings call for additional studies exploring 
the  relationship  between  WLC  and  gender,  as  well  as  how  WLC  beliefs  might  be 
influenced by situational factors, e.g. the organizational level of the participants.
