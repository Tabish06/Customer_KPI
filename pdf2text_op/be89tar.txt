 The Information in Discretionary
 Outlays: Advertising, Research,

 and Development

 Bruce Bublitz and Michael Ettredge

 ABSTRACT: Recent studies have considered the association between abnormal stock re-
 turns and forecast errors of various components of earnings. For discretionary outlays such as
 advertising or research and development (R&D), the sign and magnitude of the association
 between forecast errors and abnormal returns can provide information concerning the ex-
 pected duration of benefits arising from these activities. This empirical study compares market
 reaction to advertising and R&D forecast errors with market reaction to forecast errors for
 conventional expenses, and with a theoretical benchmark for long-lived assets. The results are
 mixed, but on balance the evidence is consistent with a market assessment that advertising is
 short-lived while R&D is long-lived.

 EXPENDITURES for advertising or
 R&D are excluded from firms' bal-
 ance sheets by present accounting
 rules primarily because of the claimed
 difficulty in determining the magnitude
 of future benefits from these activities
 and difficulty in determining the length
 of time over which benefits will endure.
 A number of studies attempt to assess the
 duration of benefits from advertising out-
 lays by examining a distributed lag rela-
 tion between product sales and past
 advertising expenditures. The inconsis-
 tent results of such studies are summa-
 rized by Schmalensee [19721 and Norris
 119841. A smaller number of studies, in-
 cluding those by Branch [1974] and
 Ravenscraft and Scherer [19821, study a
 distributed lag relation between R&D
 input (expenditures) or output (patents),
 and profitability. These studies find a
 mean lagged relation of several years
 (four to six years in Ravenscraft and
 Scherer).

 Two recent studies, Hirschey [1982]

 and Hirschey and Weygandt [19851, take
 a different approach by examining the
 relation between firms' market values
 and current period advertising and R&D
 outlays. As both studies note, use of
 stock prices to construct a dependent
 variable offers an attractive alternative

 to the previous distributed-lag studies,
 which used accounting sales or earnings
 data. Both studies conclude that adver-
 tising and R&D are long-lived and
 should be capitalized and amortized over
 time rather than expensed when in-
 curred.'

 The present study uses an alternative
 market-based research method based on
 Lipe [1986] to investigate the longevity
 of advertising and R&D. In Section I, we
 present the theory underlying an alter-
 native empirical approach using stock
 returns and disaggregated earnings data
 to address the longevity issue. Section II
 describes the research design including
 forecasting models used and specific
 tests performed. Section III presents re-
 sults and Section IV the conclusions.

 I. AN EARNINGS COMPONENTS

 APPROACH

 Several recent studies investigate the
 association between cumulative abnor-
 mal security returns (CAR) and unex-
 pected changes in the levels of various
 revenue and expense components of earn-
 ings. Lipe [1986] investigates the asso-
 ciation between CAR and the forecast
 errors of six components of earnings, us-
 ing annual data on gross profits, general
 and administrative expense, depreciation,
 interest expense, income taxes, and other
 items. He finds that the component fore-
 cast errors explain more of the variation
 in CAR than do earnings forecast errors
 alone, and he concludes that some infor-
 mation is lost when the six components
 are aggregated into a single earnings
 number. This conclusion differs from
 the findings of Hopwood and McKeown
 [1985] who use only sales and total ex-
 penses, and who find that forecast errors
 for these components have no incre-
 mental information beyond that pro-
 vided by earnings forecast errors alone.
 Lipe also investigates whether intercom-

 ponent differences in time-series proper-
 ties of earnings components partially ex-
 plain intercomponent differences in the
 magnitude of the relation between CAR
 and component forecast errors. He finds
 that components whose shocks tend to
 persist across time have a stronger asso-
 ciation and concludes that return reac-
 tions to component shocks are positively
 related to the time-series properties of
 the components.2

 Lipe mentions [1986, p. 52] that the

 market reaction to an unexpected change
 in an earnings component which is ac-
 companied by a change in the level of an
 investment depends on whether the mar-
 ket evaluates the investment as a positive
 net present value project. We make ex-
 plicit use of this line of reasoning to
 investigate whether advertising and R&D
 outlays can be best characterized as in-
 vestments or expenses from a market
 perspective. The association of per-share
 advertising and R&D "forecast errors"
 with CAR should differ to some extent
 depending on whether all benefits of ad-
 vertising and R&D are reflected in cur-
 rent versus future periods.

 Consider a firm that makes an unex-
 pected cash outlay that will yield cash
 inflows in the same and/or future peri-
 ods. The market value of the firm de-
 creases by the amount of the cash outlay
 but increases in an amount equal to the
 present value of current period and ex-
 pected future cash flows from the proj-
 ect. The net change in the value of the

 1 Ettredge and Bublitz 11988] have extended the Hir-
 schey and Weygandt [1985] study using a similar research
 method but with a larger, multi-year sample. These re-
 sults strongly support the Hirschey and Weygandt results
 with respect to the longevity of R&D but, for a majority
 of years, do not agree concerning the longevity of adver-
 tising.

 2 Persistence is the present value of revisions in ex-

 pected future earnings arising from a one-dollar shock in
 earnings or an earnings component.

 firm, reflected in its periodic abnormal
 stock return, therefore, depends upon
 the project's net present value.' Assume
 for simplicity a setting in which account-
 ing revenues and expenses correspond to
 cash flows. Focusing on advertising for
 the moment, let

 Pit-Pit-l =A o +B1 SFEPSi, t
 + B2ADFEPSi,t
 +B3OEXFEPSir+eit. (2)

 Pi,= the per-share price of firm

 i at time t,

 SFEPSi =the per-share sales fore-
 cast error (unexpected
 cash inflow) for the peri-
 od ending at time t,

 ADFEPSit=the per-share advertising

 forecast error (unexpected
 cash outflow) for the pe-
 riod,

 OEXFEPSi, = the per-share forecast er-

 ror (unexpected cash out-
 flow) for expenses other
 than advertising, and

 Zia =the present value of future
 period cash inflows arising
 from the advertising fore-
 cast error.

 All cash inflows resulting from an unex-
 pected change in advertising are captured
 either in SFEPS or in Z. If the adver-
 tising shock, with its related effects on
 future cash flows, sales, and other ex-
 penses, is the only economic event af-
 fecting the firm in the period ending at
 time t, the change in per-share market
 price, which will be reflected in the peri-
 odic return, is:

 Pit-Pi, -I = SFEPSi, t-ADFEPS i,

 - OEXFEPS i , + Z i, . (1)

 If advertising yields benefits only in
 the current period, then Z will have a
 value of zero. Any advertising forecast
 error should be accompanied by contem-
 poraneous, unexpected cash flows for
 sales and cost of goods sold (a major
 component of other expenses). Consider
 the following linear regression model:4

 The coefficients for SFEPS and OEX-
 FEPS should be positive and negative,
 respectively, and the coefficient for AD-
 FEPS should be negative and the same as
 the coefficient for other expenses. That
 is, an unexpected increase in advertising
 outlays should be associated with a nega-
 tive price response when controlling for
 contemporaneous changes in sales and
 other expenses.

 If, instead, benefits from advertising
 occur only in future periods, then an un-
 expected increase in advertising for a
 given period will not be associated with
 same-period shocks in sales and other ex-
 penses. However, Zi, will now be posi-
 tive and will be reflected in the periodic
 return. If Z could be observed, its coef-
 fient should be positive while the esti-
 mated coefficient for ADFEPS would be
 negative. Because Z is unobservable,
 however, it constitutes an omitted vari-
 able that is positively correlated with
 ADFEPS in a cross-sectional test. The
 estimated coefficient for ADFEPS will,
 therefore, be positively biased toward
 zero. In fact, if all benefits from adver-
 tising occurred in future periods and if
 advertising were a zero net-present-value

 3 See Henderson and Quandt [1971, pp. 312-319] for a
 discussion of the neo-classical economic theory of invest-
 ment, which typically assumes that firms face investment
 opportunities characterized by decreasing marginal in-
 ternal rates of return. A profit-maximizing firm should
 increase the level of its investment in a given project until
 the marginal internal rate of return to the project equals
 the cost of capital or discount rate. Therefore, firms em-
 ploying value-maximizing levels of advertising and R&D
 should be facing zero net-present-value projects at the
 margin. We view advertising and R&D forecast errors as
 marginal changes. Given that the value of the firm is as-
 sumed to be a concave function of advertising or R&D
 outlays, the linear form of equation (1) should be consid-
 ered an approximation.

 4 In the cross-sectional regressions performed all vari-

 ables are deflated by dividing by Pi,,. See Section 11.

 project at the margin, Z would be per-
 fectly and positively correlated with ADF-
 EPS, and the slope coefficient of ADF-
 EPS would be zero in the absence of a
 Z-variable.5

 The above discussion suggests that the
 estimated coefficient of association be-
 tween advertising or R&D forecast errors
 and returns will depend upon the longev-
 ity of benefits arising from these activ-
 ities. If advertising and R&D outlays
 constitute expenses then, just as with
 other expenses, a negative coefficient of
 association with CAR should be ob-
 served, such as the negative partial cor-
 relation coefficient Hopwood and Mc-
 Keown [1985] found for total expense
 forecast errors. If these outlays produce
 future-period cash flows, the present
 value of the cash flows constitutes a posi-
 tively correlated omitted variable which
 would bias the estimated coefficients for
 advertising and R&D toward zero. Re-
 laxing the assumption that accounting
 revenues and expenses correspond to cash
 flows should not invalidate the basic
 thrust of the analysis.

 Estimated coefficients for returns with

 ADFEPS and RDFEPS can, therefore,
 be compared against two benchmarks.
 First, there is the "zero" measure de-
 scribed above. Unexpected investments
 in zero net-present-value projects which
 are long-lived should have no association
 with CAR. The first set of null hypoth-
 eses (Ho and H02), described in Section
 II, are that the coefficients of association
 for ADFEPS or RDFEPS equal or ex-
 ceed zero. Failure to reject the direc-
 tional null hypotheses can be interpreted
 as an indication that unexpected outlays
 for advertising or R&D constitute long-
 lived, zero net-present-value investments.
 Alternatively, inability to reject the null
 hypotheses could be due to lack of power
 in the test-e.g., from measurement er-
 rors in our variables, a possibility we dis-

 cuss in Section IV. Rejection of the null
 can be interpreted as implying that future
 period benefits of advertising and R&D
 are relatively small compared to current
 benefits. Rejection of the null could also
 result if firms do not use value-maximiz-
 ing levels of advertising and R&D.6

 As a second benchmark, the estimated
 coefficients for ADFEPS and RDFEPS
 can be compared with the estimated co-
 efficient for Other Expense forecast
 errors. The second set of null hypotheses
 (H.3 and H,,), are that coefficients of
 association between ADFEPS or RD-
 FEPS and CAR are less than or equal to
 the coefficient of association between
 OEXFEPS and CAR. If the models are
 correctly specified, their inability to re-
 ject these nulls implies that advertising
 and R&D are treated like ordinary ex-
 penses in the valuation process. Rejec-
 tion of the second set of null hypotheses
 suggests that advertising and R&D have
 future benefits. However, as with the
 first pair of hypotheses, caveats apply
 here. For example, rejection of null hy-
 potheses H03 and H.4 could be due to
 measurement error in the advertising and
 R&D variables rather than to longevity.7
 We will also compare the longevity of
 advertising and R&D with one another.
 The null hypothesis (Ho5), is that the co-

 I See Kmenta [1971, pp. 392-3931 for a discussion of
 specification error due to omission of a relevant explana-
 tory variable. Our analysis is based on three assump-
 tions. First, ADFEPS and Z are assumed to be positively
 correlated. Second, CAR and Z are assumed to be posi-
 tively correlated. Third, the correlation between ADF-
 EPS and CAR is assumed to be negative.

 6 For instance, if firms on average use "too much" ad-
 vertising, an unexpected marginal increase in advertising
 could be associated with a negative abnormal return even
 if advertising is long-lived. We assume that firms employ
 value-maximizing levels on average.

 I Note that for Ho0 and Ho2, lack of power could result
 in an incorrect assessment that advertising and R&D are
 long-lived. For Ho3 and H04, lack of power could lead to
 an incorrect assessment that advertising and R&D are ex-
 penses. The two sets of tests, therefore, complement one
 another.

 efficient for RDFEPS is less than or
 equal to the coefficient for ADFEPS.
 Rejection of the null implies that R&D is
 longer-lived than advertising as is sug-
 gested by the results of Hirschey [1982],
 Hirschey and Weygandt [1985], and Et-
 tredge and Bublitz [1988].

 II. RESEARCH DESIGN

 Population Studied

 Because advertising and R&D data are
 typically available on an annual basis
 only, we use annual rather than quarterly
 data. Because the primary focus of this
 study is advertising and R&D outlays,
 our sample consists of firms from four-
 digit standard industry classification
 (SIC) industries 2000 through 3999; in
 these industries it is common for firms to
 have both advertising and R&D. Sample
 firms have calendar fiscal years and ap-
 pear on the COMPUSTAT annual in-
 dustrial tape for the period 1973-1983,
 and on the daily CSRP tape for the pe-
 riod 1969-1984. The test period is 1974-
 1983 and qualified firms enter the sample
 as early as the availability of data allows
 (typically, in the first year advertising
 and R&D forecast errors can be com-
 puted).8 These requirements result in a
 maximum (minimum) of 2,832 (1,325)
 annual observations for 328 (190) sample
 firms depending upon the specific vari-
 ables included.

 such estimation period precedes a 12-
 month "window" encompassing annual
 earnings announcement dates of sample
 firms. The parameters estimated over each
 estimation period are used to calculate
 monthly unsystematic returns in the suc-
 ceeding 12 months. These unsystematic
 returns are summed over the 12-month
 period to obtain cumulative abnormal
 returns, CAR. The 12-month accumula-
 tion periods run from nine months prior
 to the fiscal year-end through three
 months afterward. 10

 Forecast Errors

 follows: l

 Earnings per share are decomposed as

 EPS = SPS-ADPS

 - RDPS - OEXPS, (4)

 8 For most firms, annual data on advertising and R&D

 expenses are available on COMPUSTAT beginning
 about 1972 or 1973, probably because of a 1972 revision
 of Regulation S-X requiring these data to be reported to
 the Security Exchange Commission as supplementary in-
 come statement information. The first year for which ad-
 vertising and R&D forecast errors can be computed for a
 substantial number of firms is 1974, and this is the start
 of our test period.

 I The CRSP daily market returns were used, with daily

 returns aggregated into monthly returns.

 1' A 12-month cumulation period ending three months

 after the fiscal year-end is common in returns studies em-
 ploying annual earnings data, and was used by Beaver et
 al. [1979] among others. The lengthy cumulation period
 reflects the fact that quarterly reports and other data
 sources allow the market to anticipate annual EPS, to
 some extent, well in advance of its release.

 Unsystematic Security Returns

 Rather than using per-share stock price
 changes as dependent variable, as in equa-
 tion (2), we use the market model resid-
 uals for firm i in month t using a value-
 weighted market index of New York and
 American Stock Exchange firms.9 The
 estimation period is a 60-month "roll-
 ing" period where data permit, and re-
 gressions are only run in estimation pe-
 riods with at least 30 observations. Each

 Jennings [19861 suggests that, when market-wide fac-

 tors are not removed from explanatory variables, raw re-
 turns rather than abnormal returns may be the appropri-
 ate dependent variable. We replicated the procedures
 using two alternative dependent variables: raw returns
 cumulated over calendar year periods, and raw returns
 cumulated over April through March periods. Use of a
 calendar year cumulation period in conjunction with the
 share price deflator results in standardization of the inde-
 pendent variables as recommended by Christie [1987].
 Overall, the results when alternative dependent variables
 are used are quite similar to those reported.

 " All per-share data throughout the study are adjusted
 to a comparable basis across years using COMPUSTAT's
 annual data item 27 to control for the effect on per-share
 data of stock dividends and splits.

 where

 EPS=COMPUSTAT annual data

 dinary items and discon-
 tinued operations,

 pense, divided by data item

 46, annual R&D expense,
 divided by data item 54, and

 OEXPS = other expenses per share, a
 residual amount: (OEXPS
 =SPS-EPS-ADPS-
 RDPS).

 Following recent studies which used
 annual data, such as Rayburn [1986] and
 Stober [1986], we deflate the indepen-
 dent variables using common share price
 at the start of the calendar year. Albrecht
 et al., [1977] provide evidence that the
 time-series of earnings deflated by the
 beginning of period stockholders' equity
 can be appropriately modeled as a ran-
 dom walk. Because of the short time-
 series of available annual data, we use
 the random walk forecast for earnings.
 Accordingly, our deflated earnings fore-
 cast error per share (EFEPS) for firm i
 in year t is:

 EFEPS, t = (EPSL,, -EPS r, 1)

 /Pi~t-19 (5)
 where P=COMPUSTAT annual data
 item 24, year-end price per share.
 Lack of an extensive time-series of
 advertising and R&D outlays precludes
 sophisticated time-series modeling. For-
 tunately, the behavior of changes in ad-
 vertising and R&D outlays per share, de-
 flated by per-share stock prices, appears

 to be white noise. Therefore, we use the
 random walk model to compute forecast
 errors for these earnings components
 and then deflate by start-of-period share
 price. This practice is common in current
 cost market studies for which short data
 histories prevail (e.g., Schaefer [1984]
 and Bublitz et al. [1985]).

 Per-share forecast errors for earnings

 components were computed as:

 ADFEPS ,t = (ADPS ,t

 -ADPSj,t 1)/Pj,t-., (6)

 RDFEPS ,t = (RDPS, t

 -RDPSi't l)1Pi't-l, (7)

 SFEPSI,t = (SPS, t - SPSit 1)

 lPi't-l, (8)

 OEXFEPSi,t = (OEXPSj,,

 - OEXPSj,t 1)/P,,t~-. (9)
 Appropriate forecasting models should
 produce forecasts having means close to
 zero. Descriptive data for the above vari-
 ables plus CAR appear in Table 1. Dis-
 tributional characteristics of SFEPS and
 OEXFEPS are similar to one another, as
 are the distributional characteristics of
 ADFEPS and RDFEPS. Mean forecast
 errors for advertising and R&D differ
 from zero at a significance level of 0.01
 or better as indicated in the table (two-
 tailed (-test), but still appear to be close
 to zero. Mean forecast errors for other
 earnings components, and for EPS, also
 differ significantly from zero. Deflated
 earnings and earnings components ap-
 pear to be characterized by a slight posi-
 tive drift.

 Table 2 presents means and standard

 deviations of the auto-correlation coeffi-
 cients of forecast errors for each of the
 first six annual lags: rt, t = 1, . . . 6.12 If

 12 Auto-correlations for each firm are based on up to
 20 years of data (19 first differences) for the period 1964-
 1983. However, the estimated auto-correlation coeffi-
 cients for advertising and R&D usually are based on a
 shorter time-series. Foster [1986, pp. 232-2331 describes
 the estimator used.

 cause multicollinearity may be present in

 earity are obtained for each regression

 Tests of Association for Advertising
 and R&D

 In Section I, we hypothesize that the

 '3 In Section I, we suggest that if advertising or R&D
 are short-lived, forecast errors for these components may
 be contemporaneously associated with forecast errors
 for sales and/or other expenses. Table 3 indicates that the
 contemporaneous correlations between advertising fore-
 cast errors and forecast errors for sales and for other ex-
 penses are relatively higher than the correlations of R&D
 forecast errors with forecast errors for sales and for other
 expenses. These relations are consistent with advertising
 being shorter-lived than R&D. Also, the correlation be-
 tween ADFEPS and CAR is negative and significant
 while the correlation between RDFEPS and CAR is close
 to zero.

 14 Collinearity diagnostics are based on procedures

 recommended by Belsley et al. [1980, p. 105]. They sug-
 gest that moderate to strong dependencies are associated
 with condition indexes of 30 to 100. The largest condition
 index observed in our regressions with pooled data was

 coefficients of association between the
 dependent variable and advertising or
 R&D forecast errors should be less nega-
 tive than the coefficient for conventional
 expense forecast errors if these outlays
 are long-lived. As was indicated above,
 the dependent variable and forecast vari-
 ables are expressed in return form (di-
 vided by beginning-of-period price per
 share). In order to place the intercept in
 the same units, it too is expressed in re-
 turn form. The following multiple regres-
 sion model is estimated with pooled data
 for the ten-year period:

 where SHARE-= 1/Pi-1.15 The hypoth-

 eses of interest using the "zero" bench-
 mark are:

 Ho,: B2 >0,

 and

 H02: B3 >0.

 Inability to reject hypotheses Ho, and
 H02 is consistent with marginal advertis-
 ing and R&D outlays constituting long-
 lived, zero net-present-value investments.
 Rejection of the nulls implies that most

 SHARE (= l/P,,, 1) with the other variables are not
 presented in Table 3. The highest correlation of SHARE
 with another explanatory variable was 0.056 (with RDF-
 EPS) which is significantly different from zero at a 0.002
 level.

 Equations (10), (11), and (12) are also estimated with a
 constant (undeflated) intercept and with the intercept
 suppressed. A variety of other modifications of model
 and data are also tried which are discussed in Section IlI.
 Results are the same as those reported with minor excep-
 tions noted.

 expire in the current period.

 The hypotheses of interest when the
 estimated coefficient of OEXFEPS is
 used as a benchmark are:

 H03: B2<B4,

 and

 H04: B3<B4.

 The results of Hopwood and McKeown
 [1985] suggest that forecast errors for
 conventional expenses will have negative,
 significant coefficients; thus, B4 is ex-
 pected to be negative. The coefficient for
 sales forecast errors should be positive
 and significant.

 The test statistic for a comparison of
 least squares estimators is [Kmenta,
 1971, pp. 371-372]:

 In addition, we wish to compare the co-
 efficients for advertising and R&D fore-
 cast errors:

 Hos: B3< B2.

 Inability to reject hypotheses H03 and
 H04 is consistent with advertising and
 R&D outlays being evaluated by the mar-
 ket as similar to conventional expenses.
 Rejection of H03 and H04, given our anal-
 ysis, is consistent with the outlays having
 long-lived benefits. That is, these types
 of outlays create intangible assets. Fail-
 ure to reject Hos is interpreted as evi-
 dence that advertising and R&D are eval-
 uated by the market as having equally
 long-lived (or short-lived) benefits. Re-
 jection of Ho, implies that the benefits of
 R&D are longer-lived than those of ad-
 vertising.

 16 Bernard [1987] presents evidence that cross-sec-

 tional dependence in stock returns data can bias Ordi-
 nary Least Squares (OLS) based statistics toward rejec-
 tion of the null hypothesis of zero slope. The bias can be
 substantial when annual return metrics are regressed
 against firm-specific variables as in the current study.
 The cross-sectional correlation is strongest within indus-
 tries. When the number of sample firms per industry is
 small, the bias is likely to be small. The mean number of
 sample firms per three-digit SIC industry in this study is
 only 2.73; the standard deviation is 2.52. Based on Ber-
 nard's results, we do not believe that this bias is a serious
 problem.

 Equation (10) can only be estimated
 for firms reporting positive amounts of
 both advertising and R&D expense. 17 Be-
 cause some firms employ either advertis-
 ing or R&D but not both, the estimation
 requirements of equation (10) greatly re-
 duce the available sample. Only 1,325
 annual observations can be employed in
 estimating equation (10). In order to
 make use of additional data, the follow-
 ing models are also estimated:

 CAR =A oSHARE+BSFEPS

 +B2ADFEPS
 +B40EXFEPS+e, (1 1)

 CAR =AoSHARE+BSFEPS

 +B3RDFEPS
 +B40EXFEPS+e. (12)

 Equation (11) is estimated with 1,753 ob-
 servations and equation (12) with 2,832.
 Note that the coefficient notation of
 equation (10) is preserved in equations
 (11) and (12). Both the zero and Other
 Expense benchmarks are used for hypoth-
 esis testing.

 Finally, equations (10), (11), and (12)
 were estimated with an additional ex-
 planatory variable:18

 NEXT,+1 = SFEPSt+1 - OEXFEPS + .

 Variable NEXT is the deflated first dif-
 ference in earnings, excluding advertis-
 ing and R&D expenses. NEXT, when in-
 cluded as an explanatory variable in
 equations (10), (11), and (12), is a "lead-
 ing" variable because it is the deflated
 difference between current period and
 next period earnings per share, excluding
 advertising and R&D. 19 NEXT may serve
 as a rough surrogate for benefits which
 period t advertising or R&D outlays will
 provide in period t+ 1. If it does, then a
 portion of the "omitted" variable Z. de-
 scribed in Section II, is now included in
 the model. This should tend to decrease
 the coefficient of association between

 CAR and ADFEPS if a substantial por-
 tion of benefits of advertising expire in
 the next period, i.e., inclusion of vari-
 able NEXT reduces bias due to the
 omitted variable.

 The additional equations to be esti-

 mated are:

 CAR =A oSHARE+BlSFEPS

 +B2ADFEPS
 +B3RDFEPS
 +B40EXFEPS
 +BNEXT+e, (13)

 CAR =A oSHARE+B1SFEPS

 +B2ADFEPS
 +B40EXFEPS
 +BsNEXT+e, (14)

 CAR =A oSHARE+B1SFEPS

 +B3RDFEPS
 +B40EXFEPS
 +BNEXT+e. (15)

 Inclusion of variable NEXT in equations
 (13), (14), and (15) reduces the available
 sample size by more than ten percent due
 to the required first differencing and re-
 sultant loss of 1983 observations.

 III. RESULTS

 For comparison with Hirschey and
 Weygandt [1985] all models are esti-
 mated separately for durable goods pro-

 " For some firms, the COMPUSTAT data field for
 advertising expense contains a zero in many years rather
 than the missing value code. We treated these zeroes as
 missing data. Computation of advertising forecast errors
 using zeroes in adjacent years would lead to numerous
 "forecast errors" having a value of zero. This would
 tend to artificially lower the variability of this explana-
 tory variable. Accordingly, forecast errors for all four
 components of earnings were only computed when adja-
 cent years each had non-zero values recorded for each
 component.

 18 We wish to thank one of our two anonymous re-

 viewers for this suggestion.

 19 Recent studies [Beaver et al., 1987; Collins et al.,

 1987] indicate that CAR for a given period is significantly
 related to earnings of subsequent periods.

 and all firms combined. Table 4 presents
 regression results for equation (10).2?
 Table 5 presents results of the hypotheses
 tests.21 Estimated coefficients for R&D
 forecast errors do not differ significantly
 from zero as predicted in H.2. Estimated
 coefficients for ADFEPS are negative
 and significant for all firms and for dur-
 able goods producers but not significantly
 different from zero for nondurable goods
 producers (H.1). The rejection of H,1 but
 not H02 is consistent with the assertion
 that the present value of future cash flows
 associated with R&D has been omitted
 from the equation. Based on the "zero"
 benchmark, R&D appears to be long-
 lived but advertising, on average, is not.
 The differential market association for
 advertising versus R&D forecast errors is
 especially striking given the similarity of

 the distributions of the two variables as
 shown in Tables 1 and 2.

 Results of tests of hypotheses H.3,
 H04, and Ho, for equation (10) differ
 from those of hypotheses Ho, and H02 to
 some extent. The former tests use the
 estimated coefficient of OEXFEPS as
 the benchmark for comparison and, in ad-
 dition, compare the coefficients of ADF-
 EPS and RDFEPS with one another.
 For Ho3 we fail to reject the directional
 null for all three samples. Results of

 20 The distributions of error terms for equations (10)
 and (13) are similar. Both distributions, when compared
 to the normal, tend to be thin in the tails and bunched
 toward the center, and both exhibit slight positive skew-
 ness. Overall, regression diagnostics for the models esti-
 mated reflect general compliance with the assumptions
 underlying multiple least-squares regression.

 21 A negative t-statistic in Tables 5 and 7 indicates an
 estimated coefficient opposite in sign to that specified by
 the alternate hypothesis.

 the tests of H04 indicate that, while the
 estimated coefficient for RDFEPS typi-
 cally exceeds that of OEXFEPS as ex-
 pected, the difference is not statistically
 significant. This appears to be due pri-
 marily to the large standard error of the
 RDFEPS coefficient estimate. In tests of
 Ho,, the estimated coefficient of RDF-
 EPS exceeds that of ADFEPS as pre-
 dicted in two of the three estimations.
 Overall, the Table 5 results using OEXF-
 EPS as a benchmark do not allow rejec-
 tion of the hypothesis that R&D is treated
 similar to a conventional expense in the
 valuation process. Advertising differs
 from a conventional expense, but not in
 a direction that implies it is long-lived.22

 In addition to the functional forms of
 equations (10), (11), and (12) described
 above, modified versions are estimated
 with constant (undeflated) intercepts and
 with intercepts suppressed. The equa-
 tions are also estimated with all variables
 standardized using the procedure of
 Bowen et al. [1987].23 Alternative ver-

 sions of the dependent variable include
 raw returns cumulated over different 12-
 month periods. Finally, the equations are
 estimated with each variable truncated at
 plus or minus ten of its own standard
 deviations.24 The results reported above
 are basically the same across all these
 modifications. However, for two modi-
 fied versions H04, the hypothesis that the

 22 Equations (11) and (12) results for pooled data are
 not presented but essentially agree with those of equation
 (10). Because equations (11) and (12) allow estimation
 with more observations than equation (10), they are esti-
 mated for each of the ten years separately.

 23 Before summing a firm's unexpected returns, each

 month's unexpected return is standardized by an estimate
 of the standard deviation of the residuals for that firm
 during the estimation period. A similar scalar is used to
 standardize the independent variables.

 24 The magnitude of the advertising coefficient ap-
 peared to be sensitive to outliers. For instance, the co-
 efficient for ADFEPS reported in Table 4 for All Firms,
 -2.837, increases to -1.497 with truncation. With trun-
 cation and standardization using the procedure of Bowen
 et al. [1987] the coefficient increases to - 1.307, but re-
 mains significantly more negative than the coefficient for
 OEXFEPS. Estimated coefficients for other variables
 are barely affected by truncation or standardization.

 coefficient for RDFEPS is the same as
 that for OEXFEPS, is rejected in favor
 of the alternate hypothesis for all firms
 and durable goods producers-i.e., R&D
 is long-lived. For all other versions of
 equation (10) the estimated coefficient
 for R&D typically exceeds that for other
 expenses, although the differences are
 not significant. Equations (10), (11), and
 (12) results, therefore, provide mixed
 evidence with respect to longevity of
 R&D using other expenses as bench-
 marks. The evidence for advertising is
 clear: advertising is evaluated as an ex-
 pense.

 Estimation results for equation (13)
 are presented in Table 6. As expected, in-
 clusion of NEXT makes the estimated
 coefficient of ADFEPS more negative,
 although this effect is primarily confined
 to producers of nondurable goods.25 In

 contrast to the equation (10) results,
 ADFEPS has a negative, significant co-
 efficient for all three industry groupings
 in Table 6. Inclusion of NEXT makes
 estimated coefficients for RDFEPS more
 positive; however, for all three industry
 groupings, estimated coefficients for
 RDFEPS still do not differ significantly
 from zero.

 as Table 5. Results are generally consis-

 the same reduced samples used to estimate equations
 (13), (14), and (15). The different results arising from in-
 clusion of the variable NEXTin the latter models do not
 appear to be due primarily to the reduction in the sample.
 For instance, when equation (10) is estimated for All
 Firms with the reduced sample, H04 is not rejected at con-
 ventional levels of significance. When equation (13) is
 estimated with the same sample, Ho4 is rejected.

 lowing exceptions. First, the hypothesis
 that the coefficient for ADFEPS equals
 zero, Ho,, can be rejected for any of the
 three industry groupings. Second, the
 null hypothesis that the coefficient for
 RDFEPS is the same as the coefficient
 for Other Expenses, H04, can now be re-
 jected for all firms and for producers of
 durable goods. Results of estimation of

 stant and suppressed intercepts, and
 both standardized and unstandardized

 tent with those presented.26

 unexpected advertising and R&D outlays
 relative to two benchmarks: a theoreti-
 cally derived coefficient of zero, and the
 coefficient of cumulative abnormal re-
 turns with unexpected conventional ex-
 penses. Annual earnings per share data
 are decomposed into four components:
 per-share sales, advertising, R&D, and
 other expenses. Forecast errors are com-
 puted for each component. Monthly ab-
 normal returns, cumulated over a 12-
 month period, are used as the dependent
 variable in regressions with the four
 earnings-component forecast errors used
 as independent variables. The regres-
 sions are then repeated, with a fifth ex-
 planatory variable designed to capture
 the earnings benefits of advertising or
 R&D one period after these outlays
 occur.

 cumulative abnormal stock returns with

 with the alternative dependent variables described in

 cantly larger than the coefficient for Other Expenses.

 Zero Benchmark: Estimated coefficients for advertising and R&D forecast errors are compared with a theoretical

 benchmark of zero for long-lived assets.

 Other Expenses: Estimated coefficients for advertising and R&D forecast errors are compared with estimated

 coefficients for the forecast errors of other expenses.

 Conclusions from the hypotheses tests
 depend to some extent upon which of the
 two coefficient benchmarks is most ap-
 propriate. The "zero" benchmark has
 two advantages. First, the benchmark is
 not subject to estimation error as is the
 case with the coefficient for conven-
 tional expenses. Second, conventional
 expenses contain components which, al-
 though not long-lived themselves, may
 be correlated with assets which are long-
 lived. For instance, unexpected increases
 in interest expense or depreciation which
 are associated with new investment in
 positive or zero net-present-value plant

 asset projects would tend to increase the
 estimated coefficient for conventional
 expenses.

 A summary of the test results, as they
 relate to classification of advertising and
 R&D as expenses or intangible assets, is
 presented in Table 8. For 11 of the 12
 tests presented, advertising is classified
 as an expense. Results for advertising,
 therefore, do not support those of Hir-
 schey [1982], or Hirschey and Weygandt
 [1985], and are closer to those of Et-
 tredge and Bublitz [1988]. On balance,
 it appears that R&D outlays made by
 durable goods producers are evaluated

 as assets, while results for producers of
 nondurable goods are mixed. When these
 subsamples are pooled, R&D outlays of
 "all firms" are evaluated as assets.

 Although our results are consistent
 with R&D being long-lived, alternative
 explanations are possible. First, estimated
 coefficients for R&D forecast errors
 would be close to zero if these outlays
 are simply price-irrelevant noise. How-
 ever, R&D expenses reported by firms
 should be highly correlated with contem-
 poraneous cash outflows for these pur-
 poses, so this explanation is not persua-
 sive. Second, R&D expenses may have
 zero persistence in the sense of Lipe
 [19861. That is, the levels of R&D ex-
 pense could have zero auto-correlations,
 and the correlations between R&D ex-
 pense and lagged sales could be zero. But
 this seems unlikely given the near zero
 auto-correlation of the differenced series
 shown in Table 2.27 Third, the random
 walk forecasting model might be more
 valid for some earnings components than

 for others. If so, this could induce the
 observed results. An additional caveat is
 that our estimation method imposes
 common coefficients across all firms and
 time periods within the sample or sub-
 sample, whereas coefficients may actu-
 ally vary across firms or over time.

 2 Because there are, on average, fewer than ten annual

 observations per firm, we are unable to decisively reject
 these possibilities. The mean auto-correlation of per
 share advertising expense (deflated by start-of-period
 stock price per share) for one lag is 0.38; the mean auto-
 correlation of deflated R&D at one lag is 0.53. However,
 these mean auto-correlations do not differ from zero at
 conventional levels with a cross-sectional t-test.

 We also examine lagged correlations between levels of
 annual advertising, R&D, and sales per share, each de-
 flated by start-of-period stock price per share. Although
 the data suggest positive correlations with sales for at
 least two lags (one lag) for R&D (advertising), none of
 the mean lagged correlations differs significantly from
 zero with a cross-sectional t-test. Our procedure is nec-
 essarily crude due to the short time series of advertising
 and R&D data. Prior research using different data bases
 provides better evidence of the persistence of R&D.
 Branch [1974] and Ravenscraft and Scherer [1982] are
 examples of studies indicating a lagged relation between
 R&D and profitability.
