Abstract The authors collected data from 295 randomly selected employees, four months after
the company’s first labor union certification election. Results of separate multiple regression
analyses suggested that job security, extrinsic job satisfaction, and organization-based self-esteem
(OBSE) were predictors of organizational instrumentality for both males and females. For men,
the division where they work, low desire to change, and low consideration were related to their
organizational instrumentality, whereas for women, low income, the Japanese management style,
and the Protestant Work Ethic were related to their organizational
instrumentality. Non-
professional men had a stronger belief that money represents their achievement than professional
men. Professional women had a stronger interest in intrinsic job satisfaction than non-
professional women. Both male and female professionals valued Japanese management style.
Results are discussed in light of managers’ efforts in satisfying employees’ needs and union
leaders’ efforts in organizing their targets.

Introduction
Based on the 1994 OECD data, The Economist
(1997) presents union
membership as a percentage of the workforce for some selected countries:
France (9 per cent), USA (14 per cent), Japan (24 per cent), Germany (30 per
cent), UK (33 per cent), Italy (39 per cent), and Norway (56 per cent). Norway
has maintained a high rate of union membership for the past two decades.
However, for other countries, the overall trend is down. The history and social
and economic contexts of trade unionism are very different in the USA than in
the UK and other countries.

For example, North European countries negotiate a single centralized
system involving a nationwide agreement.

with professional and managerial workers and the collective bargaining
agreements are not enforceable. Further, British scholars have studied dual

allegiance or commitment to union and employer in a certain environment
where the organization is sympathetic to unionism. In Japan, unions are
organized on a company-by-company basis or an ‘‘enterprise’’ basis rather than
by kind of job. Japanese unions foster discipline, dedication, and cooperation
and are organized by regular workers. In Mexico, the employer-employee
relationship is more friendly than that in other countries.

In the USA, we have witnessed an unparalleled decline in union membership
for the past several decades. The percentage of the union labor force dropped
from 40 per cent in the 1940s and 1950s to 30 per cent in 1970, to 17 per cent in
1990 (Chaison and Rose, 1990; Ritter, 1990), and to 14 per cent in 1997 (The
Economist, 1997). American unions have lost 5.2 million members since 1975,
with 3.1 million of these losses occurring during the first half of the 1980s
(Chaison and Rose, 1990; Dickens and Leonard, 1985).

Some of the reasons postulated for the decline in union membership in the
USA are related to the shift from a manufacturing to service environment, an
increase in white collar and woman employees entering the labor market, and
an eroding of the traditional union labor base which changed the economic
climate of the country dramatically (Cornfield, 1989). Farber (1990) stated that
‘‘there has been a decrease in demand for union representation by nonunion
workers due to an increase in the satisfaction of nonunion workers with their
job and a decline in nonunion workers’ belief that unions are able to improve
wages and working conditions’’ (p. S76, emphasis added). Wages and benefit
packages are instrumental in attracting new recruits. But, once unionized, the
focus of these workers is on non-economic issues relating to control at the
workplace (Taplin, 1988).

The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) not
only removed tariffs and restrictions affecting the flow of goods and services
among the USA, Canada, and Mexico but also enabled many US organizations
to move low-skill,
low-wage jobs (susceptible to unionization) to Mexico.
Unions traditionally have been stronger in the Northern states of the USA. Job
growth, however, has been the greatest in the South, Southwest, and Rocky
Mountains. Many states in these areas have ‘‘employer-friendly’’ laws (e.g.
right-to-work laws).

In the USA, bargaining is usually done on a company-by-company basis.
Sometimes, bargaining may even go down to individual plants within a firm.
Management and union traditionally have adversarial relations. It is quite rare
to find dual allegiance or commitment to union and employer in the USA (Laws
and Tang, 1999). In 1998, for example, 9,200 GM workers of two parts plants in
Flint, Michigan, started a strike on June 5 and 11, respectively. Due to parts
shortage, GM and other parts plants had to lay off 162,000 workers throughout
North America. The strike cost GM about $80 million a day. It was reported
that at the end of the second quarter of 1998, GM had lost $1.2 billion (Laws and
Tang, 1999).

Unions have some measure of success in public-sector employees,
particularly with state and local government workers. Targeting by unions is

very evident today. As unions concentrate their efforts to organize employees,
they have identified certain industries and certain cities as being ripe for union
organizing (Mathis and Jackson, 2000, p. 605). For example, AFL-CIO has
picked Las Vegas, Nevada and its core service jobs as a major target because
Las Vegas has been a boom town for some time now and hotels, hospitals, and
construction workers cannot be moved elsewhere by employers. About 24,000
child-care workers are a target in Philadelphia. Further, nursing home workers
who experience low pay, hard work, and are the most susceptible to workplace
injuries have also become a target for unions’ concentrated efforts. More
recently, due to Health Maintenance Organization’s (HMO) control of health
services and cost-cutting practices, many professionals in the health care
industry including medical doctors have considered union as a vehicle to
protect them.

Gender
Government predicts that 90 per cent of women will work outside their homes
sometimes during their adulthood (Chusmir and Durand, 1987). The
participation rate for women will continue to increase and is likely to continue
well into the twenty-first century (Singer, 1990). This may further erode the
traditional union labor base (Cornfield, 1989). Women are less likely to desire
union membership because women dislike activities such as strikes (Antos
et al., 1980; Fiorito et al., 1986). Women are under-represented in unions due to
their presence in different occupations and industries.

However, Bigoness and Tosi (1984) found that women faculty members
showed a strong desire for continued representation by the union. They
reasoned that women are a minority within most university faculties and sex
discrimination against female professors exists. Therefore, female faculty
members may view the union as a vehicle to protect them from such
discrimination. Due to the increasing participation of women in the labor force
and their increasing involvement in unions, we need to examine gender
differences in work-related attitudes. Further, more and more women are
moving up to managerial positions in recent years. These professional women’s
work, family, and union orientations are likely to be different from those of
lower-level women. Thus, we will examine the differences in organizational
instrumentality between non-professional and professional employees (i.e.
women and men).

The present study
The major purpose of the present study is to examine the sex differences in
demographic variables and employees’ attitudes toward the organization,
organizational instrumentality, in particular. Factors related to employees’
organizational
instrumentality will be examined separately for men and
women and also for non-professional employees and professional employees.

instrumentality in one US company. It is also beyond the scope of the
present paper to discuss cross-cultural differences related to unions, the
union-management relations, union instrumentality, voting intentions, and
actual voting behavior (please see our discussion in the method section).
Results of this study may offer some insights to managers and researchers
regarding union-related issues. The notion of organizational instrumentality
and variables related to this construct will be reviewed.

Organizational
instrumentality

381

Organizational instrumentality
Organizational instrumentality is defined as employees’ belief and confidence
(expectancy) that the organization will be instrumental in helping employees
achieve their major personal goals in the organization,
i.e. employees’
confidence or faith in the organization (Singer and Tang, 1996). Organizational
instrumentality can be considered as the opposite of union instrumentality.
They are the two sides of the same coin (Singer and Tang, 1996). The construct
of organizational instrumentality has its roots in union instrumentality.

It has been found that attitudes toward unions consistently have been
considered important factors in voting for and against unions in union elections
(or decertification elections) (Bigoness and Tosi, 1984; Brett, 1980; Brief and
Rude, 1981; DeCotiis and LeLouarn, 1981; Summers et al., 1986). Union
instrumentality, in particular, has been suggested as the single largest correlate
of both vote intent and actual vote (DeCotiis and LeLouarn, 1981).

Organizational instrumentality ‘‘is analogous to union instrumentality and
refers to an employee’s perception of the organization’s effectiveness in
securing valent outcomes for him or her’’ (Summers et al., 1986, p. 648).
Heneman and Sandver stated that ‘‘the employer must attempt to create or
strengthen employee beliefs that management will be instrumental in providing
valued outcomes – without the presence of a union’’ (Heneman and Sandven,
1983, p. 556, emphases added). Rosenstein and French (1985) also suggested
that employees with a strong sense of identification with the company would
be less likely to favor unionization. Moreover,
‘‘the perception of positive
organizational instrumentality militates against the propensity to unionize’’
(Summers et al., 1986, p. 648). Thus,
the importance of organizational
instrumentality can not be ignored. We will review factors that are related to
organizational instrumentality.

Job security
Job insecurity, a sense of ‘‘powerlessness to maintain continuity in a threatened
job situation’’ (see Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984, p. 438), has been cited as
one of the major reasons for people to join the union (Brett, 1980; Greenhalgh
and Rosenblatt, 1984; Kochan, 1979; Singer, 1990). For the past several decades,
the changeover from manufacturing to a service economy, the economic
recession, reengineering, acquisitions, mergers, and outsourcing all lead to job
losses (James and Tang, 1996; Tang and Fuller, 1995) and create concerns
about job security (Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984). When employees feel

Managerial
Psychology
15,5

382

uncertain, they may experience fear, perhaps seeking the union to enhance job
security. It stands to reason that job security will be an important factor related
to organizational instrumentality for both men and women.

Extrinsic satisfaction
Dissatisfaction with economic matters can lead to unionization (Bigoness and
Tosi, 1984; Fiorito et al., 1986; DeCotiis and LeLouarn, 1981; Heneman and
Sandver, 1983; Lawler and Walker, 1980; Martin, 1985; Zalesny, 1985). We
predicted that extrinsic job satisfaction will be significantly related to
organizational instrumentality.

It has been suggested that overall differences in the job satisfaction of men
and women are small and inconsistent. When the differences in education, pay,
and tenure are controlled, no sex differences in satisfaction will be expected
between men and women (Hulin and Smith, 1964; Sauser and York, 1978; Smith
and Plant, 1982). In a study of university faculty and staff, Tang and Talpade
(1999) found that male participants tend to have higher satisfaction with pay
(extrinsic
female
participants tend to have higher satisfaction with co-workers than their male
counterparts. Other studies suggest that for non-professional people, women
have higher satisfaction than men, while for professional people, the opposite is
true (e.g. Shapiro and Stern, 1975). This suggestion leads us to the importance
of studying differences between non-professional and professional employees.
Further, it is expected that extrinsic satisfaction is important for both men and
women.

economic benefits

Pay
Pay or income is one of the major concerns related to extrinsic satisfaction
which deserves more attention. Unions, most often, are associated with either
providing or protecting workers’
1990;
Tannenbaum, 1952). Farber and Saks (1980) suggested that those low in the
wage distribution tend to favor unionism, whereas those high in the wage
distribution tend to oppose it because employees with higher pay may not
perceive unions as instrumental in gaining further pay increases. It seems that
employees’ pay level and professional status in an organization may play a role
in their attitudes toward unions. Even though pay or income may show a
relationship with union membership, workers do not join unions for economic
reasons alone (Singer, 1990). Fullagar and Barling (1989) discovered that
dissatisfaction with extrinsic working conditions did not necessarily predict
stronger union loyalty.

(Singer,

Further, it has been pointed out that union-pay premium increased in the
1970s at the very time when productivity growth slumped. This led to job
losses and deunionization. Further, industries with the biggest (union vs non-
union) wage differentials had the most rapid declines in union membership
(The Economist, 1990).


Organizational
instrumentality

383

It can be reasoned that if an employee’s pay increase leads to job insecurity,
then, a high level of pay may not be as desirable as it appears to be. Thus, pay
is a very important factor and may function as a double-edged sword. It is
plausible that employees will have less concern on income when their job is
secure. This is true especially in a time period when organizations experience
economic recession, lay-offs, reorganization, and mergers and acquisitions.

Sex and the importance of pay
Although hourly women are paid less than men in the same group, the former
are more satisfied with their income than the latter (Campbell et al., 1976;
Ronan and Organt, 1973; Women’s Bureau, 1976). Moreover, females are
satisfied (and concerned) more with the social aspects of work (e.g. supervision,
co-workers, etc.) and less with pay than males (Herzberg et al., 1957; Smith and
Plant, 1982; Tang and Talpade, 1999). Lawler (1971) stated that pay should be
less important for women because it is not highly instrumental for their
satisfaction of highly ranked social needs, while it is instrumental for the
satisfaction of men’s highly ranked esteem needs. Thus, ‘‘pay is more important
to men than to women’’ (Lawler, 1971, p. 47).

Sex may have a significant impact on their attitudes toward money and
work-related values (Tang, 1992, 1993, 1995; Tang and Gilbert, 1995; Tang and
Kim, 1999). Females are more concerned about egalitarian outcomes than
males, whereas males are more concerned about equity than females (Tang,
1996; Tang et al., in press). That is, women’s allocation of money was not
affected by their endorsement of the Money Ethic (i.e. positive money attitudes,
Tang, 1995). Men with high Money Ethic endorsement allocated significantly
more money to the highest position and significantly less money to the lowest
positions than did those with low Money Ethic endorsement creating the
Matthew Effect in compensation. Based on these suggestions, it is plausible
that females may show a higher level of tolerance towards low income than
their male counterparts. In other words, females with low income may show a
high level of confidence in the organization.

Desire to change and participate
Brett (1980) stated that ‘‘an employee’s initial interest in unionization is based
on dissatisfaction with working conditions and a perceived lack of influence to
change those conditions’’ (p. 48). Thus, a high level of job dissatisfaction, a
strong desire to change, and lack of power and participation to change appear
to be related to employees’ interest in unionization (Brett, 1980; Heneman and
Sandver, 1983; Summers et al., 1986). The present authors argue that people
with a high level of organizational instrumentality would have a low desire to
change.

Although the women’s movement may have changed the feelings and
attitudes of women for the past several decades (Kavanagh and Halpern, 1977),
however, based on the ‘‘social norm’’ of the society, women generally are
expected to be more humanitarian, nurturing, sympathetic, considerate, and


Journal of
Managerial
Psychology
15,5

384

probably more satisfied and less critical than men. Therefore, it is reasonable to
expect that men are more likely to use the voice option (see Hirschman, 1970),
have a higher desire to participate, and have a stronger need for dominance (see
Steers and Braunstein, 1976) than women.

Organization-based self-esteem
Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE)
is defined as the degree to which
organizational members believe that
they can satisfy their needs by
participating in roles within the context of an organization (Pierce et al., 1989,
p. 625). OBSE reflects an evaluation of one’s sense of personal adequacy and
worthiness as an organizational member. Employees with high OBSE have
come to believe that they are important, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile
within their employing organization. As such it is the self-perceived value that
one has of themselves within their employing organization. Thus, it is also
expected that positive OBSE will be related to organizational instrumentality
for both men and women.

Organizational citizenship behavior
Good organizational citizens engage in behaviors that are valued by the
organization, frequently of an altruistic nature (Smith et al., 1983). Such
behaviors include helping co-workers without being asked, volunteering for
extra assignments, and helping train a new employee. Organization-based self-
esteem is significantly correlated with organizational citizenship (Pierce et al.,
1989; Tang and Ibrahim, 1998). This construct has obvious implications for
organizational instrumentality.

Management style
Japanese management style with its emphasis on human resources focused on
three main efforts:

(1) securing an internal labor force, of quality employees who will stay with

the firm;

(2) articulating a distinct company philosophy and creating a ‘‘family’’

atmosphere; and

(3) adopting specific techniques to develop and manage employees to the

firm’s advantage (Hatvany and Pucik, 1981).

The company philosophy, if communicated clearly and effectively, can have a
significant impact on the organization and its employees (Hatvany and Pucik,
1981). Some company policies are more likely to keep a company union-free
than others, such as: open communication and participation programs, good
grievance procedures, etc. (Fiorito et al., 1986).

DeCotiis and LeLouarn (1981) discussed leadership style in union
instrumentality. It has been suggested also that ‘‘the best union organizer is the
boss’’ (Brett, 1980, p. 57). Further, ‘‘[r]arely, if ever, do workers vote for unions.


Rather, they cast votes against management’’ (Singer, 1990, p. 394). Following
this line of reasoning, leadership behaviors such as initiating structure and
consideration should be examined also (see Ayman and Chemers, 1983; Halpin
and Wiener, 1957). It was predicted that employees’ perceptions of company
management style and leadership behavior, consideration in particular, will be
related to organizational instrumentality.

Protestant Work Ethic
The Protestant Work Ethic belief involves the traits of industriousness,
individualism, asceticism, community involvement, and an overall valuing of
work as the most worthwhile way to spend one’s time (Weber, 1904-1905/1958).
Adherence to pro-Protestant Ethic was positively related to job satisfaction
(Aldag and Brief, 1975; Blood, 1969) and work-related behavior and motivation
(Tang, 1989; Tang and Baumeister, 1984).

Organizational
instrumentality

385

Work Ethic was also suggested as an important factor in studying union
membership (Martin, 1985). However, the relationship between Work Ethic and
attachment to the labor union is a complex one (Fullagar and Barling, 1989;
Goldthorpe et al., 1969). It is possible that high Work Ethic workers need the
union because they are committed to the company and want to improve job
status and security in the organization. On the other hand, low Work Ethic
employees may feel that they are being exploited and view the union as
instrumental for job status and security. It is plausible that people with high

Method
Participants
The present research was conducted in a publishing company employing more
than 1,800 employees, more than 1,000 of whom are based in the main office in
a large Southeastern metropolitan area. The main office of this organization is
located in a state with the right-to-work laws. This firm provides a number of
products and services (books, newsletters, and materials for classes) to a
specialized constituency, and operates with an annual budget of $190 million.

This study was conducted approximately four months after the company’s
first labor union certification election of its 100-year history. The union was
defeated in a 4-1 margin (143-36 votes)
in one bargaining unit of the
organization with 200 support staff-manual workers. The organization was
also involved in a process of reorganization and a small group of employees
was laid off.

Due to the fact that the company has had the first union certification
election, the director of human resource made it clear that the word ‘‘union’’ will
not appear anywhere on the survey. He believed that the word ‘‘union’’ may
create strong emotional reactions toward the company and the union among
employees. Further, the director also expressed concerns related to the selection
of employees for the survey. He did not want to create the impression that the

company was focusing only on employees in the bargaining unit and was
trying to ‘‘harass’’ and ‘‘punish’’ those involved in the union election. Thus, a
sample of employees from the whole organization was randomly selected.
Further, this company has been involved in a company-wide employee survey
several times in the past. The present survey was adopted as the company
survey for that year. The company has not been involved in aggressive anti-
union activities and/or campaigns. Due to these conditions, employees’
attitudes toward the union, union instrumentality, voting intentions, and actual
voting behavior can not be studied.

A total of 450 regular full-time and regular part-time employees from a
cross-section of all employees of the organization according to job classification
(support staff-manual workers, support staff-clerical workers, professionals,
and managers), office/division, and sex was randomly selected for the present
study. Many professional editors working for different publications (books and
newsletters) were labeled as professionals. These employees were contacted by
company mail and encouraged to participate. Area mangers were also informed
concerning the participation of their subordinates. All were informed that
participation was voluntary and their responses on the survey would be
confidential. One hour of work time was made available for employees to
attend one of the five group sessions on two days, to which they were
arbitrarily assigned. Participants could attend a different session other than the
one assigned by contacting a designated person in the Human Resources. Two
additional follow-up sessions were offered to those who were unable to come to
the regular group sessions. A total of 295 usable surveys (male = 106, female =
187, missing data = 2) was collected. The response rate was 65.56 per cent. The
composition for the present sample in terms of sex and job classification is
presented in Table I.

Measures
A 178-item survey was employed for the present study. The survey
questionnaire covered demographic variables (e.g. sex, age, education, tenure in
present position, job classification, office/division, and annual income). In our
data analyses, two categories of job classification were employed. That is,
support staff-manual workers and support staff-clerical workers were

whereas professionals and managers were combined into one group and were

The response format for the most of the remaining 24 variables was a five-
point, Likert scale using disagree strongly (1), neutral (3), and agree strongly (5)
as anchors, with one exception (Job Stress Survey, to be discussed later). The
mean and standard deviation of male and female employees for each of these

instrumentality. The organizational

instrumentality was
measured by a 13-item scale (see Singer and Tang, 1996) based on suggestions
in the literature (e.g. Heneman and Sandver, 1983; Summers et al., 1986). The
first 12 items were related to the extent to which employees have ‘‘strong belief’’
that their organization will:

(1)

improve working conditions for employees;

treat employees fairly in its performance appraisal process and its
discharge/discipline policies;
improve employees’ wages and hours;

(2)
(3) maintain equity in administering the compensation system;
(4)
(5) continue to provide employees with a safe place to work;
(6)
(7)
(8) continue to provide good fringe benefits;
(9) make the job more interesting and challenging;
(10) provide employees the opportunity to influence company-wide policies

improve grievance procedures;
improve workers’ job security;

and the organization-employee relationship;
increase open communications; and

(11)
(12) allow employees more participation in decision making.

The final question was used to indicate an overall organizational instrumentality:
I can have confidence in my organization. Both economic and non-economic
variables were included in this measurement. Based on the present sample, the
reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of this 13-item scale was 0.93 (see Table II).

Job security. The importance and satisfaction of job security as related to
unionization have been suggested in the literature (Brett, 1980; Greenhalgh and
Rosenblatt, 1984; Singer, 1990). These concepts were measured by the
following five items:

(1) My organization will continue to provide me with economic security.
(2) There is security and peace of mind in working for this organization.
(3) As for security, one need never worry about one’s job as long as one is a

good worker.

Notes: For sample size, Male = 106, Female = 187

I feel a strong sense of security in my job at this organization.

(4)
(5) How satisfied am I with this aspect of my job? The feeling of security I

have about my job (a five-point scale with 5 as very satisfied).

This scale also showed good reliability (0.87).


Desire to change. The following three items measured people’s desire to

change (see Summers et al., 1986):

Organizational
instrumentality

389

(1)
(2)
(3)

I have a strong desire to change the way my company treats its people;
I believe that many company policies/practices should be changed; and
I do not desire any change in this organization (reverse scored).

Other measures. Desire to participate was measured by two items:

(1)
(2)

I strive to have more participation in decisions that affect my work; and
I seek an active role in changing some of the operations in this
organization.

The short, 20-item Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (Weiss et al., 1967)
was employed to measure intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. The 10-item
scale to measure organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) (Pierce et al., 1989) was
also adopted for the present study.

Japanese management style was measured using a seven-item scale, with
reliability coefficient, based on the construct suggested by Hatvany and
Pucik (1981). Several scales were modified and used: a ten-item scale on
employee commitment to the organization (Romzek, 1989), organizational
citizenship behavior (Smith et al., 1983), the Leader Behavior Descriptive
Questionnaire (Consideration and Initiating Structure) (Halpin and Wiener,
1957), sources of work stress (Steers, 1988),
Job Diagnostic Survey
(Motivating Potential Score, MPS) (Hackman and Oldham, 1980). Further,
Protestant Work Ethic (Blood, 1969), n Ach, n Dom, and n Aff (Steers and
Braunstein, 1976), and the Money Ethic Scale (Achievement and Power)
(Tang, 1992, 1993) were also employed.

Job Stress Survey (Turnage and Spielberger, 1991) was measured by using a
modified five-point scale with 0 time, did not occur (1), 1-3 times (2), 4-5 times
(3), 6-8 times (4), and 9 or more times (5) as anchors. This five-point scale was
re-coded as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The total score of job stress was the sum of
individual items.

All participants were encouraged to attend a survey feedback session
announced through company newsletter. All participants were debriefed.
The results of the study were presented to participants two months after
the completion of the survey and were later published in a company
newsletter.

Results
Sex differences
The means of all variables for male and female participants are presented in
Table II and the correlation coefficients among variables are presented in Table
III. Participants’ sex (male vs female) was used as the grouping variable in a
discriminant analysis (see Table IV). The results of this analysis showed that
men and women differed in nine variables. Men tended to have higher

The canonical correlation (0.540) and the Wilks’ lambda (0.709) were used to
evaluate the discriminant function. The explained variance for these nine
variables was 29.1 per cent. The percentage of cases correctly classified was
77.32 per cent, Chi square (9) = 78.28, p = 0.0001. The significant sex difference

Organizational instrumentality
Two separate step-wise multiple regression analyses (male/female) were
conducted to examine the major variables related to employees’ organizational
instrumentality. The major variables, the R square change, F change, and beta
for each variable, as well as multiple R, and R square for males and females are
presented in Table IV.

For male employees, extrinsic satisfaction, which accounted for 55.5 per cent
of the variance for organizational instrumentality (beta = 0.49), was the most
important factor. Job security was the second most important factor (11.4 per
cent of the variance, beta = 0.31). The office/division where they work seemed
critical to men. Further, organization-based self-esteem (beta = 0.21), low
desire to change (beta = – 0.17), a perception that their supervisors were not
very considerate (beta = – 0.18) were also predictors of organizational
instrumentality.

For female employees, job security (57.0 per cent of the variance, beta = 0.41)
was the most important variable. (Note that for male employees, it accounted
for only 11.4 per cent of the variance.) Organization-based self-esteem (7.5 per
cent of the variance, beta = 0.26) was the second most important factor for
females. Extrinsic job satisfaction (beta = 0.24) accounted only 4.2 per cent of
the variance for women, whereas it accounted a significant 55.5 per cent of the
variance for men. Moreover, low income (beta = – 0.18), Japanese management
style (beta = 0.15), and Protestant Work Ethic (beta = 0.08) were predictors of
organizational instrumentality.

Additional correlational data for the whole sample are also provided. Sex
(females) was correlated with a low need for achievement (r = – 0.14, p = 0.008),
low perceived mobility (r = – 0.11, p = 0.026), low job-related stress (r = – 0.11,
p = 0.04), and low income (r = – 0.31, p = 0.001).

For males, office/division was significantly correlated with low challenging
job (MPS) and low need for achievement (see Table III). Further, for female
employees, Work Ethic again was correlated significantly with a challenging
job, high need for achievement, good organizational citizenship behavior,
organization-based self-esteem, job security, organizational commitment, low
turnover, low desire to change, high intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction, and
age.

Differences between non-professional and professional male employees
Male and female participants were further analyzed based on their non-
professional vs professional status in this sample. More specifically,
participants in the manual labor and clerical areas were grouped as non-
professional, while those in the professional and managerial group were
classified as professional. Results of male participants will be presented first.

Discriminant analysis. Results of a discriminant analysis are presented in
Table V. The results of this analysis showed that non-professional and
professional men differed in three variables. Professional men tended to have
more education (17.94 years), higher income ($40,480), and a lower score on

money as a sign of their achievement (8.68), whereas non-professional male
employees tended to have less education (13.35 years), lower pay ($22,166), and
a stronger belief that money is a sign of their achievement (10.45). It is
interesting to note that non-professional male employees tended to have lower
income and a stronger belief that money represents their achievement. The
canonical correlation was 0.738. The Wilks’ lambda (0.455) revealed that the
explained variance for these three variables was 54.5 per cent. The percentage
of cases correctly classified was 89.32 per cent, Chi square (3) = 67.24, p =
0.0000.

Multiple regression. Further, we also employed all variables to predict
organizational
instrumentality for non-professional and professional male
employees using separate multiple regression analyses. Table V shows that job
security (64.8 per cent of the variance, beta = 0.52), extrinsic job satisfaction
(beta = 0.77), and low consideration (beta = – 0.43) were significant predictors of
organizational
instrumentality for non-professional male employees. For
professional male employees, job security (beta = 0.36), extrinsic job satisfaction
(beta = 0.38), and the Japanese management style (beta = 0.25) were significant
predictors of organizational instrumentality. Thus, job security and extrinsic job
satisfaction are both important to male employees. Further, professional
employees who have confidence in the company tend to perceive that the
Japanese management style is being practiced in the organization.

discriminant analysis are presented in Table VI. The results of this analysis
showed that non-professional and professional women differed in five
variables. Professional women tended to have higher income ($29,302), shorter
job tenure (63.17 months),
lower job security (15.38), higher intrinsic job
satisfaction (47.43), and lower organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)
(48.40), while non-professional female employees tended to have lower income
($14,984), longer job tenure (65.00 months), higher job security (17.64), lower
intrinsic job satisfaction (45.92), and higher OCB (50.19). The canonical
correlation was .571. The explained variance for these five variables was 32.6
per cent (i.e. Wilks’
lambda = 0.674). The percentage of cases correctly
classified was 79.41 per cent, Chi square (5) = 51.11, p = 0.0000.

employees, job security (beta = 0.59), commitment (beta = 0.23), initiating

employees, a low desire for change (beta = – 0.44), a high level of intrinsic job
satisfaction, participation (beta = 0.15), the Japanese management style (beta =
0.28), and less education (beta = – 0.21) were strong predictors of organizational
instrumentality. Again, professional females are more concerned about the
Japanese management style than non-professional employees.

Discussion
Summary of research findings
Our results suggest that there are many important sex differences in the
present sample. In general, males have more education, show a higher level of
need for dominance, desire to participate, are older, have a more interesting job,
higher job security, and have stronger perception of company’s practice of the
Japanese management style than females, whereas females show a higher level
of self-reported organizational citizenship behavior and organizational
instrumentality than males. Further,
for male employees, extrinsic job
satisfaction, job security, office/division where they work, organization-based
self-esteem, low desire to change and low consideration are predictors of
organizational instrumentality. On the other hand, for female employees, job
security, organization-based self-esteem, extrinsic job satisfaction, low income,
the Japanese management style, and high work ethic are strongly associated
with the construct of organizational instrumentality.

Moreover, we also investigated the differences between non-professional
and professional employees for males and females. On the one hand,
professional men tended to have more education, higher income, and a lower
score on money as a sign of their achievement than non-professional men. For
non-professional male employees, job security, extrinsic job satisfaction, and
low consideration are strongly associated with organizational instrumentality.
For professional male employees, job security, extrinsic job satisfaction, and
the Japanese management style are significant predictors of organizational
instrumentality.

On the other hand, professional women tended to have higher income,
shorter job tenure, lower job security, higher intrinsic job satisfaction, and
lower organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) than non-professional female
employees. For non-professional female employees, job security, commitment,
initiating structure, and organization-based self-esteem are strongly associated
with organizational instrumentality. For professional female employees, a low

Our results suggest that females have stronger belief that the company will
be instrumental in satisfying their needs and goals than males. Rosenstein and
French (1985) mentioned that employees with a strong sense of identification
with the company are less likely to favor unionization. Although employees’
attitudes toward union and their voting behavior are not examined, it is
speculated that females may have less desire to vote for a union than males in
the present sample. Future research should examine these variables together
and test this hypothesis directly.

Extrinsic job satisfaction, job security, and organization-based self-esteem
are the common factors for both men and women when variables are used to
predict organizational instrumentality. However, the order of importance for
men and women on these factors is different.

Concerning employees’ confidence in the organization, men are more
concerned about their extrinsic job satisfaction (ranked first) than women
(ranked third), whereas women are more concerned about job security (ranked
first) than men (ranked second). During the time periods of economic recession,
lay-offs, reorganization, mergers and acquisitions,
job security is a very
important factor for both men and women. These factors are related to the
economic or the traditional bread-and-butter aspects of their job (Brett, 1980).
Several months before the data collection of the present study, a small group of
employees were laid off which might have significant impacts on employees’
feeling of job security in the present study.

If employees are satisfied with these factors,

they will have strong
confidence in the organization. In fact, a union was defeated in a 4-1 margin in
one bargaining unit of the company four months before the study. These
results suggest that most employees feel that job security is extremely
important and their job is still secure. If these factors are not satisfied,
employees may vote for a union (Brett, 1980; Singer, 1990).

(1989)

Organization-based self-esteem developed by Pierce et al.

is an
important factor for all employees, women in particular (ranked second).
Therefore, employees’ subjective feelings about
themselves within the
organizational context are very critical. If people feel useful and important in an
organization, they will have confidence in the company. Employees are not just
concerned about the bread-and-butter aspects of their jobs, they are also
interested in their psychological well-being and self-esteem in an organization.
These results support the importance of studying personality and work-related
attitudes (Tang and Baumeister, 1984). Organization-based self-esteem has
rarely been studied in the context of union involvement and related literature. It
is indirectly implied that those employees with high job security, extrinsic job
satisfaction, and organization-based self-esteem in an organization do not need
a third party to represent them. This hypothesis needs to be tested in the future.
There are three factors in the analyses that men and women do not share the
same view in the study. For females, low income employees have expressed a
high level of organizational instrumentality. It is possible that as long as the job
is secure, the overall extrinsic job satisfaction is high, and they feel good about
themselves, females are not bothered by their low income. They seem to
recognize the Japanese management style (i.e. promotion from within, family
atmosphere, loyalty, etc.) practiced by the management. These results may
support the notion that women are more concerned about social issues, how
they are being treated, and less concerned about income (see Herzberg et al.,
1957; Lawler, 1971; Tang and Talpade, 1999).

Females in the present study also express a lower level of subjective job
mobility. Female employees are from four major areas: support-manual,
support-clerical, professional, and managerial. Many of them (56.22 per cent)
are non-professional employees. It is speculated that low income females in


Organizational
instrumentality

397

clerical positions may not want to change jobs and/or may have very little
skills and low mobility, thus, staying in the same organization may be the only
option which reflects their high organizational instrumentality.

The Protestant Work Ethic is a personality trait which emphasizes work as
the most worthwhile way to spend one’s time (Weber, 1904-1905/1958). Those
who endorse the Work Ethic also display many organizational attitudes and
behavior
in the positive direction and also have high organizational
instrumentality. The importance of personal values, the endorsement of the
Protestant Work Ethic of female employees in particular, in studying the
cognitive process of employees’ motivation and behavior is recognized (Tang
and Baumeister, 1984).

For men, the office/division where they work is significantly related to
organizational instrumentality. Further examination of this variable reveals
that office/division is correlated with a less challenging job and their low need
for achievement. Thereby, male employees’ high confidence in the organization
may be related to their easy-going, routine, and comfortable work environment.
This factor may lead to employees’ low desire to change. It is speculated that
male employees have a high level of extrinsic job satisfaction, job security, and
feel good about themselves as employees in the organization (OBSE), a routine
and comfortable job, and a low desire to change, i.e. with most of their needs
being met, these male employees are not bothered by their managers’ low
consideration. Many of these variables are cognitive in nature and are non-
economic factors.

We find significant differences between non-professional and professional
employees. The patterns for males and females are again different. Job security
and extrinsic job satisfaction are both very important for men. It appears that
when the core ‘‘the bread and butter’’ and economic issues are satisfied, men
will have confidence in the organization (Singer and Tang, 1996). For
professional male employees, they seem to value the Japanese management
style. Non-professional men have a much stronger belief that money represents
their achievement (Factor Achievement of the Money Ethic Scale, Tang, 1992)
than professional men. Tang (1992)
is
negatively correlated with satisfaction with work, promotion, supervision, co-
workers, and life satisfaction. Non-professional men’s belief that money
represents their achievement may lead to a high level of dissatisfaction. These
findings support the traditional stereotype of non-professional men. Their
desire to earn more money may serve as a major target for unions. In America,
money is how we keep score.

Professional women are more interested in intrinsic job satisfaction than
non-professional women. The former are less secure in their jobs and may
display less organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). OCBs are performed
beyond employees’ regular duties and responsibilities and may make their own

If

Unlike all male employees who focus on extrinsic job satisfaction,
professional female employees’ great concern for their intrinsic job satisfaction
is related to organizational instrumentality. Furthermore, professional female
workers have shown great concern for their desire to participate in decision
making and to seek active role in changing the operations in the organization.
Thus, their higher-order social needs for participation in decision making
should be honored. However, their desire for the change of company policies is
low. Less educated professional females are also more loyal to the company.
Both male and female professional employees reveal that the Japanese
management style (i.e. promotion from within, family atmosphere, loyalty, etc.)
is related to their organizational instrumentality. We believe that managers
need to satisfy the aforementioned needs of employees in order to stay union
free. On the other hand, unions need to focus on these needs as a target in their
future efforts.

The results of the present investigation further highlight the importance of
several issues. Employees’ job security and extrinsic satisfaction are still very
important. However, organization-based self-esteem, management style,
personal values (such as Protestant Work Ethic), job content, and career
structure are replacing the historical concerns for today’s workers (Taplin,
1988). The differences between men and women on organizational
instrumentality and the factors related to their concerns should be stressed in
future research.

Women and minorities, who have different expectations concerning work
(Mottaz, 1986), are entering the workforce in increasing numbers. Income and
pay are still considered very important. Our results further support the view
that females are less concerned about their income (an important factor) than
men, relatively speaking (see Tang, 1992, 1993, 1996). In fact, those female
employees who have ‘‘low income’’ levels show a high level of organizational
instrumentality. Therefore, the emphasis on pay may not be appropriate for the
female employees in the present study. As a matter of fact, ‘‘job security’’ is
their supreme concern. If unions’ concern of economical factors leads to job
insecurity, then, unions may not be instrumental in helping these people
achieve their personal goals.

Managers will be responsible to create employees’ beliefs that management
will be instrumental
in satisfying different workers’ needs and valued
outcomes (see Heneman and Sandver, 1983; Summers et al., 1986). The results
of the present investigation may help management identify factors related to

organizational instrumentality for male and female workers. A caution is
warranted concerning generalizing the present findings to other organizations
due to the nature of the business and type of employees in the organization.

Today’s unions appear to be out of touch with employees’ interests. Union
organizers still cling to the traditional issues of grievance procedures, security,
benefits, and pay in attempting to attract new members. No significant
differences in tactics are being used regardless of whether the environment
consists primarily of blue-collar or white-collar workers (Lynn and Brister,
1989).

The future survival of unions depends on their willingness to change their
organizing strategies and tactics (Chaison and Dhavale, 1990). The labor
movement can either continue to seek out disgruntled workers and wait for
employer errors, or, they can combine this strategy with non-traditional
methods (Verma, 1989). This latter approach requires that the non-traditional
and non-economic issues which appear to influence today’s worker be
identified and understood. Unions need to change their tactics and develop a
new brand of unionism which deals not just with ‘‘wages’’, but with other
interests of workers as well (The Economist, 1990).

Integration or separation: women and the appliance of
organizational culture
Coates, G.
Women in Management Review (UK), Vol 13 No 3 98: p. 114 (11 pages)
Looks at the increasing importance placed on the notion of corporate culture
since the 1980s and the belief that corporate culture can be managed to develop
a committed workforce which identifies with organizational objectives. Notes
that gender and diversity has become an important strand within corporate
culture, often cited as a source of competitive advantage, and asks how this has
affected women within the workforce. Surveys male and female managers
working in the UK about their experience of work to uncover the motives and
meanings they have in relation to work and their organizations, and to identify
whether men and women are receiving and interpreting the messages of
corporate culture in similar ways. Questions the managers about
their
training, career development and promotion, and their
expectations of
commitment to the organization and their satisfaction with their work. Analyses
how organizational culture affects these for men and women, concluding that
the strategies and mechanisms associated with the management of corporate
culture bear hardest on women, who are under pressure to conform to a culture
which is still masculine. However, identifies some change in the approach to
gender in corporate culture, pointing to evidence that women and men
assimilate corporate culture equally, making it possible to refer to the
‘‘organization person’’ rather than the ‘‘organization man’’, as in the past.

Beyond direct and symmetrical effects: the influence of
demographic dissimilarity on organizational citizenship behaviour
Chattopadhyay, P.
Academy of Management Journal (USA), Jun 1999 Vol 42 No 3: p. 273 (15 pages)

Examines the influence of demographic dissimilarity on organizational
citizenship behaviour – behaviour whereby employees go above and beyond the
call of duty to aid fellow workers and achieve organizational goals. Outlines how
the relationship between demographic dissimilarity between an employee and
his peers, and the level of an employee’s organizational citizenship behaviour is
mediated by the organization-based self-esteem of employees and their trust in
and attraction to their peers. Proposes hypotheses that reflect the effect of these
mediating variables on the demonstration of organizational citizenship
behaviour. Tests the hypotheses against the behaviour of workgroups from four
US organizations to show a uniform influence of demographic dissimilarity on
altruism for race dissimilarity and age dissimilarity: race dissimilarity negatively
influenced organization-based self-esteem, peer relations and altruism for white
employees in minority dominated groups; sex dissimilarity between focal
employees and their work group peers negatively influenced self-esteem, peer
relations and altruism for men in women-dominated groups; and age
dissimilarity is associated with the better peer relations for younger employees.

The effects of gender in organizational justice perception
Lee, C. and Farh, J.
Journal of Organizational Behaviour (UK), Jan 1999 Vol 20 No 1: p. 133 (11 pages)
Investigates perceptions of justice and fairness in organizational procedures
pertaining to pay satisfaction, in an attempt to establish if there is a gender
difference in perception. Surveys 354 employees of a consumer products
company which was changing its pay plan to incorporate skill-based pay and
pay-at-risk. Explains this briefly. Uses, also, data on 217 employees of a
privately-owned manufacturing plant. Recounts the data collection procedures,
outlines the measures used and explains how the data was analysed.
Hypothesizes that, as women are more process-oriented and men are more
outcome-oriented, gender would moderate the relationships of distributive and

justice and organizational outcomes. Finds that, contrary to
speculation, gender did not moderate the relationship between distributive or
procedural justice and pay satisfaction, nor did gender moderate the relationship
between justice and commitment. Puts forward some possible explanations for
this, attributing it, mainly, to a narrowing of gender differences at work.

Gendered meanings of commitment from high technology
engineering managers in the UK and Sweden
Singh, V. and Vinnicombe, S.
Gender, Work and Organization (UK), Jan 2000 Vol 7 No 1: p. 1 (19 pages)
Looks at the reasons why women are often seen as being less committed to their
work than men, using a study of the male-dominated engineering industry to
understand if men and women have a different understanding of the meaning of
commitment at work. Also looks at how organizational culture and the
managerial level achieved by a person affects their views of organizational
commitment. Interviews matched pairs of male and female engineers working in
the Swedish and UK aerospace industries, asking about the meaning they attach
to organizational commitment and inviting them to describe a person within the
company whom they saw as being highly committed to the organization.
Compares these meanings with the views of senior managers on the type of
commitment they wanted to see in their employees. Presents a detailed analysis
of the results of these interviews. Concludes that there are gender differences in
the way that men and women perceive commitment, and that the perceptions of
the male employees was more in line with the perceptions of the senior managers.
Also found that managerial level affected the perception of commitment.

Predicting employee commitment and satisfaction: the relative
effects of socialization and demographics
Taormina, R.J.
The International Journal of Human Resource Management (UK), Dec 1999
Vol 10 No 6: p. 1060 (17 pages)
Reports the results of a study that compared the effects on organizational
commitment and job satisfaction of demographic variables – including gender,
age, education and marital status – with variables derived from aspects of


organizational socialization, namely, training received, employee’s understanding
of his/her role and of the organization, co-worker support and future prospects
within the employing organization; and argues that organizational socialization is
important because it is more directly under the control of management (and
therefore potentially manipulable) than demographics. Hypothesizes, specifically,
that employees will be more satisfied and therefore more committed where they
evaluate highly the training they have received, the support of their co-workers
and their future prospects in the company and where they have a greater
understanding of their role and the organization; and tests these hypotheses using
data collected from 193 full time Chinese employees in Hong Kong organizations.
Discusses the implications of the findings for management, for example, that since
the socialization variables were consistently stronger predictors of job satisfaction
and organizational commitment than the demographic variables, managers can
design programmes that are particularly valuable for employees. Emphasizes the
importance of the future prospects variable (which was the only predictor of
promotion satisfaction and the main predictor of pay and work satisfaction) and
encourages managers to address this aspect of socialization seriously.

Sex differences in the continuance component of organizational
commitment
Wahn, J.C.
Group & Organization Management (USA), Sep 1998 Vol 23 No 3: p. 256 (11 pages)
Summarizes the literature on organizational commitment and the research that
has been done on the differences between men and women in this regard. Tests
out the hypothesis that women have higher levels of commitment to remain
with their employers than men, basing this on the assumption that women will
perceive fewer alternatives to staying with their current employer than men.
Surveys members of Canadian human resource professional associations and
compares the answers of the men and women. Finds that the women showed
more commitment to their organizations, although this difference is only
modest. Argues that these results confirm that managers who refuse to recruit
or promote women on the grounds that they are unlikely to stay with the
organization are wrong, and that the findings of this, and other research, which
