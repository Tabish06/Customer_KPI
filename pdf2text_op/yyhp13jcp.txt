Empirical study

Increasingly, ﬁrms have recognized the signiﬁcance of environmental issues in gaining competitive
advantage. Many ﬁrms have searched for mechanisms that integrate environmental supply chain prac-
tices and performance objectives. This paper explores how strategic supply chain partnership (SSCP)
contributes to environmental supply chain management (ESCM). This study presents a research model
that deﬁnes the details of SSCP and ESCM. Based on the responses of 141 Korean manufacturing ﬁrms,
the research model is empirically tested through a structural equation model. To the best of our
knowledge, this study represents the ﬁrst empirical test conducted on the integration of SSCP and ESCM
as a way of examining how these two critical sets of practices are implemented in the context of Korean
ﬁrms. Managerial implications and future research opportunities are provided.

1. Introduction

As the Bhopal disaster (1984) and Mattel Toy Recall (2007) cases
suggest, even one single failure in terms of critical environmental
requirements can create huge implications for a ﬁrm’s immediate
ﬁnancial performance and long-term organizational social repu-
tation (Stenson, 2006; Kovács, 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). The
primary reasons behind these failures are, in part, derived from the
companies’ mismanagement of their partners who failed to meet
environmental standards. In response to these and other similar
cases, ﬁrms increasingly have focused a great deal of attention on
environmental supply chain management (ESCM) practices that are
deeply grounded in the idea of partnership. The complexity
involved in producing environmentally safe, high-quality, cost-
competitive products and services requires trust-based collabora-
tive participation from numerous ﬁrms in the supply-and-demand
network (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; de Bakker et al., 2002;

Montabon et al., 2007). Naturally, the scope and extent of collab-
orative relationships with the suppliers and customers are reﬁned
through systematic and organization-wide efforts that involve
effective information sharing at both the strategic and operational
levels. Achieving this superior level of communication requires
considerable support from the highest levels of management.

ESCM addresses environmental concerns as part of a broader
supply chain network (Narasimhan and Carter, 1998; Hall, 2000;
Shaw et al., 2010). ESCM is regarded as an extended supply chain
that incorporates the demands of environmental issues through
various integrative business practices, such as life cycle analysis
(LCA) (Matos and Hall, 2007), the 3Rs (recycling, reuse, and rema-
nufacturing) (Hervani et al., 2005), environmental technologies
(Srivastava, 2007), and collaborative practices across supply chain
participants
suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and
customers) (Cheng et al., 2008). In the context of supply chains, any
supply chain initiatives require strategic supply chain partnerships
(Gofﬁn et al., 2006; Nyaga et al., 2010). Thus, ﬁrms increasingly seek
to improve partnerships among supply chain partners (i.e.,
suppliers). In this paper, strategic supply chain partnership (SSCP) is
conceptualized in a broader sense to include (a) enabling

(i.e.,

antecedents, such as mutual trust, organizational compatibility,
and top management support and (b) implementation of effective
partnership interactions, such as information sharing at both the
strategic and operational levels (Mentzer et al., 2000).

The aim of this paper is to explore the following research ques-
tion: In view of increasing global environmental requirements, how
can focal companies integrate SSCP with ESCM to gain sustainable
competitive advantages? To explore this question further, we present
a research model that examines the complex relationships between
SSCP and ESCM, and conducts empirical validation through the
survey results of 141 Korean ﬁrms. To the best of our knowledge, an
empirical examination of such relationships in the context of fast-
growing Asian economies, such as that of Korea, has not been
undertaken before. This paper is organized as follows: First,
a research model is presented based on a review of the literature,
followed by the hypotheses, which articulate the nature of the rela-
tionships between key variables. Secondly, the research methods,
data analysis, and results are presented, showing the details related
to the empirical validation of the model. Finally, the ﬁndings, impli-
cations, and directions for future research are discussed.

2. Literature review

Fig. 1 depicts the research model, which emphasizes the rela-
tionship between SSCP and ESCM. SSCP is predicated on anteced-
ents such as mutual trust, organizational compatibility, and top
management support. Implementation of SSCP includes strategic
information sharing and operational information sharing. In addi-
tion, ESCM has two dimensions: ESCM practices and performance
outcomes (environmental and business performance).

2.1. Strategic supply chain partnership (SSCP)

A stream of literature supports the value of SSCP. In early
studies, Mohr and Speckman (1994) have discussed partnership
attributes, communication behaviors, and conﬂict resolution tech-
niques as important factors for partnership success. Since then,
much of the research that has been conducted on this topic has
been conceptual (Graham et al., 1994; Ellram and Hendrick, 1995;
Mentzer et al., 2000). Recently, several empirical studies have
been conducted as well (Gofﬁn et al., 2006; Nyaga et al., 2010;
Sodhi and Son, 2009). Gofﬁn et al. (2006) have examined the
speciﬁc attributes of close supplier-manufacturer relationships in
terms of potential beneﬁts to be attained through such partner-
ships. Nyaga et al. (2010) empirically examined the mediating role
of trust and commitment between inter-organizational collabora-
tive activities, such as information sharing,
joint relationship
efforts, dedicated investments, and relationship outcomes. Sodhi
and Son (2009) scrutinized Korean supplier-retailer partnerships

from two different angles, including strategic partner performance
and operational partnership performance. Five factors that affect
these partnership performance outcomes

joint partnership management, relationship-
speciﬁc assets, and partner asymmetry.

are

Strategic partnership plays an essential role in increasing long-
term beneﬁts for the supply chain based on successful supply
chain relationships and reducing risk (Mentzer et al., 2000;
Lambert et al., 2004). Strategic partnership also involves trust,
cultural compatibility, top management support, and effective
information sharing (Chen and Paulraj, 2004; Li and Lin, 2006).
Thus, for the purpose of this study, SSCP is deﬁned as successful
long-term relationships among trading partners in the supply chain
that are enabled by mutual trust, organizational compatibility, top
management support, and information sharing.

2.1.1. Antecedents of SSCP

Mutual trust is an important antecedent in the SSCP (Johnston
et al., 2004). Developing and maintaining a high level of trust is
critical for successful relationship building (Cai et al., 2010; Nyaga
et al., 2010). Firms with mutual trust perceive partners as reliable
and trustworthy in taking effective actions toward achieving desir-
able performance outcomes (Das and Teng, 1998; Mentzer et al.,
2001). Organizational compatibility reﬂects similarity in manage-
ment style and goal compatibility with supply chain partners.
Compatible corporate culture is also essential for effective long-term
inter-ﬁrm dyadic relationships (Smith and Barclay, 1997; Li and Lin,
2006; Paulraj et al., 2008). Top management support is critical in
communicating shared vision and implementing strategic decisions
within an organization (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Kotter, 1990).
Top management’s commitment, as evidenced by deploying
necessary resources, facilitates the development of strategic part-
nership with key suppliers (Mentzer et al., 2000; Li and Lin, 2006).

2.1.2.

Implementation of SSCP

In management literature, practices have been deﬁned both in
strategic dimensions as well as operational dimensions (Castanias
and Helfat, 1991). Strategic practices involve top management, are
implemented organization-wide, and are long-term oriented.
Operational practices, in contrast, are middle-management initi-
ated, functionally focused, and short-term based. SSCP thrives
when ﬁrms are willing to share strategic information (e.g., orga-
nizational vision,
long-term opportunities, and realistic risks)
(Monczka et al., 1998; Mentzer et al., 2001). SSCP also requires
operational-based information (e.g., production planning, produc-
tion outcomes, and new product/service developments details)
(Zhou and Benton, 2007). Quality inter-organizational decision-
making requires timely, accurate, and relevant information both at
the strategic and operational

distinguish these two types of information and show how ﬁrms
integrate them in their collaborative decision-making processes.

2.2. Environmental supply chain management (ESCM)

A supply chain perspective is useful in addressing complex
environmental issues involving focal ﬁrms and their suppliers.
ESCM includes waste reduction, recycling, reuse, and material
substitution (Narasimhan and Carter, 1998). Hall (2000) has
proposed a research model that contains theoretical requirements
(i.e., systemic approaches to environmental concerns, strategic
buyeresupplier relations, and ﬁrm behaviors under environmental
regulation pressures). Zhu and Sarkis (2004) have adopted a broader
perspective of ESCM by including four ESCM-related practices
(internal environmental management; external ESCM; investment
recovery; and eco-design, also referred to as design for environ-
mental practices) and environmental performance outcomes in
terms of reductions in environmental waste and energy consump-
tion (Beamon, 1999; Sroufe, 2003; Hervani et al., 2005; Montabon
et al., 2007). In this study, ESCM is deﬁned as organizational efforts
addressing environmental
issues through inter-organizational
collaboration to achieve performance goals and requirements (e.g.,
market performance and ﬁnancial performance) (Narasimhan and
Carter, 1998; Hall, 2000; Zhu and Sarkis, 2004).

organizational cultures and business policies also share essential
elements of business decision-making (Cooper et al., 1997; Paulraj
et al., 2008). Thus, ﬁrms that are compatible with each other are
more likely to share not only strategic but also operational infor-
mation with partners in the supply chain than they are to share
information with ﬁrms that operate in different environments
because the former tend to share a common “world view” of SCM
(Spekman et al., 1998; Li and Lin, 2006).

As more organizations require compatibility in terms of stra-
tegic priorities (innovativeness vs. low cost) and interests (global
market vs. regional focus), the more they pursue information
sharing. Examples of strategic information sharing include market
requirements for premium products and changing customer
demands in global market. On the other hand, information sharing
in operational details may involve cross-functional collaboration
and amount of component part delivery needs. Thus, we hypoth-
esize the following:

H2a: The extent of organizational compatibility among the
partners in the supply chain is positively associated with stra-
tegic information sharing.
H2b: The extent of organizational compatibility among the
partners in the supply chain is positively associated with oper-
ational information sharing.

3. Hypothesis development

3.1. Mutual trust and information sharing

Mutual trust is both relationally based and performance based.
Firms that exhibit a high level of organizational integrity tend to
uphold their business reputations through effective information
sharing practices among strategic partners both at the strategic and
operational levels (Zaheer et al., 1998). Firms make decisions about
the level of trust they assign to their partners based on such
external evidence. They continue to sustain mutual trust unless or
until their experiences with information sharing (e.g., reliability,
timeliness, and accuracy of information exchanged) suggest that
they should seek an alternative course of action (Currall and Judge,
1995; Liao et al., 2010).

Strategic information sharing, such as emerging R&D plans or
details about strategic outsourcing with new suppliers, requires
a level of trust in the motives of supply chain partners and the
appropriate use of shared information. Furthermore, operational
information, such as requirements to win contracts and secure orders
for new products/services, is critical when supporting strategic goals,
such as achieving market growth targets. Thus, ﬁrms that have
developed a high level of mutual trust usually continue such rela-
tionships based on highly relevant, accurate, and timely information e
relationships that ultimately result in mutual beneﬁt. Based on the
research that has been reported on the strategic role of information
sharing and mutual trust, we hypothesize the following:

H1a: The extent of mutual trust among the partners in the
supply chain is positively associated with strategic information
sharing.
H1b: The extent of mutual trust among the partners in the
supply chain is positively associated with operational informa-
tion sharing.

3.2. Organizational compatibility and information sharing

Firms with organizational compatibility across the supply
chain members share similar corporate philosophies. Their

3.3. Top management support and information sharing

Top management support is critical for implementing major
supply chain initiatives (Mentzer et al., 2000). Li and Lin (2006)
have noted that top management support as a key facilitator of
information sharing in supply chains. Top management contributes
to the integration of information sharing into an overall organiza-
tional business strategy and thus provides vision, guidance, and
support for the effective implementation of SCM (Wu et al., 2004; Li
and Lin, 2006). For example, top management decisions to deploy
adequate budgets for network IT capabilities are vital in facilitating
strategic information sharing (timelines for implementing major
supplier development programs) and operational
information
sharing (timely and accurate updates on the delivery status and
results). Therefore, we hypothesize the following:

H3a: The extent to which top management supports the supply
chain is positively associated with strategic information sharing.
H3b: The extent to which top management supports informa-
tion technology is positively associated with operational infor-
mation sharing.

3.4.

Information sharing (from strategic to operational)

Mutual trust, organizational compatibility, and top manage-
ment support are important antecedents in forming strategic
supply chain partnerships. Partnering ﬁrms share critical and
proprietary information to sustain and support their partnership
relationships. Such information includes multi-level information
that is characterized by strategic and operational data (Cooper and
Ellram, 1993; Mentzer et al., 2000). Strategic information enables
shop-ﬂoor employees to work on operational details. For instance,
top management criteria for selecting new product lines (strategic
information) enable cross-functional teams to clarify sets of new
product development project targets (operational details). In sum,
once strategic information is shared, operational information is also
likely to be shared among the partnering ﬁrms. Thus, we hypoth-
esize the following:


124

H4: Strategic information sharing is positively associated with
operational information sharing.

H6b: ESCM practices are positively associated with business
performance.

Information sharing and environmental supply chain

3.5.
management (ESCM) practices

Effective information sharing between supply chain partners
positively inﬂuences the implementation of ﬁrms’ supply chain
practices (Zhou and Benton, 2007). Implementing ESCM practices
requires vital
information regarding strategic and operational
plans, detailed records, and development of products and services
(Erlandsson and Tillman, 2009).

Strategic information available to senior management, such
as long-term environmental trends, motivates manufacturing
and engineering managers within the supply chain network to
implement practices related to processing environmentally safe
component parts across the network. Operational information,
such as engineering design capabilities and manufacturing
production capacity, becomes essential
the successful
implementation of cost- and time-saving practices, such as
adopting efﬁcient means of toxic waste disposal. Taken together,
the more that both strategic information and operational
information are shared, the better able companies will be to
effectively address ESCM issues. Thus, we hypothesize the
following:

for

H5a: The extent to which strategic information is shared among
the partners in the supply chain is positively associated with
ESCM practices.
H5b: The extent to which operational information is shared
among the partners in the supply chain is positively associated
with ESCM practices.

3.6. ESCM practices and performance outcomes

Organizations use ESCM practices to assess and mitigate their
impact on the environment.
For example, environmental
management systems allow organizations to coordinate informa-
tion required to improve environmental performance. Such
systems are expected to lead to higher environmental perfor-
mance, especially in conjunction with ISO 14001 certiﬁcation
requirements (Melnyk et al., 2003; Matos and Hall, 2007). ESCM
practices also minimize potentially harmful environmental effects
throughout a product’s life cycle e e.g., from initial product design
to materials disposal (Hart, 1995; Sroufe, 2003; Montabon et al.,
2007). Particular ESCM practices that involve strategic procure-
ment of environmentally friendly raw materials may lead to
drastic reductions in waste and ultimate product disposal
processes, thus improving environmental performance. As a result,
we hypothesize the following:

H6a: ESCM practices are positively associated with environ-
mental performance.

Successful implementation of ESCM practices may help orga-
nizations face competition with new opportunities and therefore
add value to core business programs (Porter and van der Linde,
1995; Zhu and Sarkis, 2004). Proactive ESCM practices, such as
environmental risk management and continuous environmental
improvement, allow organizations to reap the beneﬁts of superior
long-term performance; these beneﬁts include an improved orga-
nizational reputation, increased market penetration, and increased
proﬁtability. Thus, we hypothesize the following:

Socially

Improved environmental performance can positively impact
business performance by enhancing customer satisfaction and
customer loyalty (King and Lenox, 2002; Luo and Bhattacharya,
2006).
accountability
improves a ﬁrm’s brand image and thus affects market perfor-
mance (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Luo and Bhattacharya,
2009; Yang et al., 2011). For example, publicity that focuses on
ﬁrms’ drastic waste reduction followed by subsequent community
recognition and environmental awards may lead to a superior
reputation among customers and increased market valuation,
which can directly result in sales growth. Thus, we hypothesize the
following:

H7: Environmental performance is positively associated with
business performance.

4. Research methods

From the 1960s to the 2000s, Korea’s economy has displayed
double-digit annual growth by focusing on shipbuilding, elec-
tronics, semiconductors, and the auto industry. The gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita of Korea grew from $67 (1960) to $20,000
(2008) (Shin and Ciccantell, 2009). In the course of attaining such
dramatic economic growth, the issue of “going green” has steadily
gained attention. Korean ﬁrms, with their relatively small domestic
markets, vigorously have pursued strategic positioning in an
increasingly global market. Leading ﬁrms, such as POSCO, Samsung,
LG, and Hyundai, have exerted a sustained effort to develop supply
chain partnerships with their suppliers in order to deliver highly
innovative products and services that meet global standards (Song
and Noh, 2006; Hong and Hwang, 2011). In addition, the Korean
government has actively promoted environmental partnerships.
For instance, the Korean government initiated a ﬁve-year envi-
ronmental partnership-building project for companies from July
2003 to June 2006. With support from governmental budgets (up to
75%), companies began to build and launch ESCM partnerships
(Korea MCIE, 2006). Such supply chain partnerships have enabled
these Korean ﬁrms to conform both to domestic and international
environmental regulatory standards and thus achieve their market
share goals in these advanced markets (Lee and Rhee, 2005; Lee
et al., 2010). Thus, focusing on Korean ﬁrms provides an opportu-
nity to gain especially rich insights about the relationship between
SSCP and ESCM.

To begin collecting data, researchers contacted via telephone
either a top management executive or another relevant informant
from each company listed with the Korea Composite Stock Price
Index (KOSPI) and Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
(KOSDAQ) trading board. These initial phone calls resulted in 400
potential respondents, who comprised the population of this study.
Survey questionnaires (n ¼ 210) were sent via email, regular mail,
and fax to participants who indicated an interest this study by. An
email reminder was sent to participants who did not complete the
survey within one week. A follow-up telephone call was conducted
as a ﬁnal reminder after an additional week. From June 2007 to
September 2007, a total of 142 completed surveys were returned
with a response rate of 35.5% (142/400). Out of the 142 returned
surveys, one survey was excluded because of an excessive number
of irrelevant answers. Therefore, for this study, 141 surveys were
used.

The typical method for testing non-response bias is to deter-
mine whether any signiﬁcant differences exist between the
responses of participants who returned the survey after the ﬁrst

125

mailing and the responses of participants who returned the survey
after subsequent contact (Krause, 1999; Prahinski and Benton,
2004). According to Armstrong and Overton (1977), it is assumed
that the late return of surveys represents the opinion of non-
respondents. After dividing 141 surveys into two groups (70 for
the early response group and 71 for the late response group), we
randomly selected half of the total items (12 out of 24) and per-
formed a t-test between the two groups (i.e., the early response
group and the late response group). The result showed that there
were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups
based on an analysis using these 12 items.

The sample descriptions are presented in Table 1. The majority of
respondents (111 out of 141) were from manufacturing companies
(51.1%) and logistics and services companies (27.7%). Researchers
solicited participants not only from small- and medium-sized
companies (<500) (112: 79.3%) but also from larger companies
(>500) (29: 20.7%). Participants from a wide range of companies in
the supply chain were included in this study (e.g., suppliers,
assemblers,
included
primarily upper-level managers or senior personnel who under-
stood the organization structures of their employers as well as their
unique market situation in the supply chain context.

logistics providers,

etc.). Participants

Because survey responses were gathered from single respon-
dents, researchers tested for common methods bias. Harman’s
single method test was used. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis did not
produce a single factor or one general factor that explained the
majority of the variance because each factor accounted for more
than the cutoff value of 5% variance (Lederer et al., 2000). Also, the
model ﬁt indicated that a single factor model did not represent the
dataset well (c2 ¼ 1377.98, df ¼ 252, GFI ¼ 0.493, RMSEA ¼ 0.179,
SRMR ¼ 0.119). Further, the average variance extracted (AVE) by
a single factor was 0.41%, indicating that a very small proportion of
the variance in the data was accounted for by a single factor. The
results of these analyses indicate that common methods bias was
not problematic.

Survey items are based on comprehensive literature reviews.
Items for each construct are adopted and revised based on the

translating the original questionnaires into Korean, minor modiﬁ-
cations are made to improve the acceptance and understanding of
survey respondents in Korea. All questionnaire items use a seven-
point Likert scale. Details of survey items, item means, standard
deviation, item loadings, average variances extracted (AVE), and
composite reliability (CR) are shown in Appendix A.

5. Research results

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the data.
The data for our research consist primarily of perceptual measures,
and our hypotheses represent a series of simultaneous relation-
ships that include exogenous and endogenous variables. Due to the
increased ﬂexibility that represents the interplay between data and
theory, SEM techniques offer advantages over discriminant analysis
and multiple regressions. SEM is regarded as an appropriate tech-
nique since we examined a series of interrelationships between
simultaneous endogenous and exogenous variables in deﬁning
multi-faceted constructs and studying path-dependent variances
(Hair et al., 1998). We followed Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)
recommended two-step approach to test our hypotheses. In step
one, we test the measurement model to establish validity and
reliability of the scales used in our analysis; next, in step two, we
also test
relationships. Details regarding the
measurement model as well as the reliability and validity of the
survey items are discussed in the next section.

5.1. Measurement model, validity, reliability

First, we tested the measurement model and established the
validity and reliability of the items using conﬁrmatory factor
analysis. The literature has suggested that multiple ﬁt indices can
be used to assess the model ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1998; Shah and
Goldstein, 2006). Generally, two types of model ﬁt indices are re-
ported: (a) absolute ﬁt and (b) incremental ﬁt measures. Absolute
ﬁt indices e i.e., c2, goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI), root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean
square residual (SRMR) e measure how well the hypothesized
model ﬁts the sample data. Incremental ﬁt indices e i.e., normed ﬁt
index (NFI), comparative ﬁt index (CFI), and incremental ﬁt index
(IFI) e compare the hypothesized model to two alternative baseline
models: (a) a null model that assumes there are no correlated
constructs, and (b) an ideal model that perfectly matches the
hypothesized model (Shah and Goldstein, 2006). These models
measure the ﬁt improvement in comparison to the above baseline
models.

In this study, absolute ﬁt indices (i.e., c2, GFI, RMSEA, and SRMR)
are reported only because the measurement items have been
designed based on research questions and grounded theories, and
thus the baseline models are not considered. The literature has
identiﬁed appropriate and acceptable cutoff values for model ﬁt
indices (Hu and Bentler, 1998; Modi and Mabert, 2007). RMSEA is
regarded good ﬁt if under 0.05 and yet acceptable up to 0.08. GFI is
good ﬁt (>0.9) and acceptable (>0.8). SRMR is good ﬁt (<0.09). Our
results suggest that all model ﬁt indices for the measurement
model are acceptable (c2 ¼ 340.50, d.f. ¼ 224, GFI ¼ 0.838,
RMSEA ¼ 0.061, and SRMR ¼ 0.042).

Convergent validity is assessed by checking the value of the
loading for an item (Bagozzi and Yi, 1998). The loadings for the
measurement model presented in Appendix A indicate that all
standardized factor loadings for each item load signiﬁcantly on
their posited constructs (>0.70), suggesting that convergent val-
idity is adequately demonstrated for all eight constructs. Discrimi-
nant validity is assessed by examining whether the square roots of

average variance extracted from each construct is greater than the
correlations of that construct with all other constructs (Fornell and
Larcker, 1981). Table 2 indicates that all constructs show an
adequate level of discriminant validity except two constructs
(ESCM practices and BP). Reliability values over 0.70 are preferable
(Cronbach, 1951; Nunnally, 1978). The values of Cronbach’s a and
composite reliability (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) are above 0.80 (see
Appendix A and Table 2), which indicates good reliability of the
measurement items.

5.2. Structural model results

Fig. 2 illustrates the structural relationships (g) between the
exogenous variables (x), i.e., three antecedents of SSCP (e.g., mutual
trust, organizational compatibility, and top management support)
and the endogenous variables (h), i.e., strategic and operational
information sharing. It also depicts the structural relationships (b)
among information sharing, ESCM practices, and performance
outcomes. Fig. 2 also shows ﬁt statistics for the structural model. Fit
indices for the structural model reﬂect an acceptable model ﬁt:
c2 ¼ 396.144, d.f. ¼ 237, GFI ¼ 0.818, RMSEA ¼ 0.069, and
SRMR ¼ 0.086.

Overall, the results indicate that the majority of hypotheses were
supported at p < 0.05, while two hypotheses (H1b and H2b) were
not supported (see Table 3). For H1a, the standardized coefﬁcient
from mutual trust to strategic information sharing is marginally
signiﬁcant at p < 0.11: H1a (g11 ¼ 0.203, t ¼ 1.879). The standardized
coefﬁcient from organizational compatibility to strategic informa-
tion sharing (H2a) is supported at p < 0.05 (g12 ¼ 0.210, t ¼ 2.061).
Both H1b (mutual trust to operational information sharing) and H2b
(organizational compatibility to operational information sharing)
were not supported: H1b (g21 ¼ 0.131, t ¼ 1.275) and H2b
(g22 ¼  0.036, t ¼  0.372). Interestingly, the path coefﬁcients from
top management support to both strategic information sharing and
operational information sharing were signiﬁcant at p < 0.01 and
p < 0.05, respectively, supporting H3a (g13 ¼ 0.331, t ¼ 3.163) and
H3b (g23 ¼ 0.204, t ¼ 2.008).
The path coefﬁcient between strategic and operational infor-
mation sharing is signiﬁcant at p < 0.01 (b21 ¼ 0.564, t ¼ 5.063),
indicating strong support for H4. H5a and H5b are all supported at
p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively: H5a (b31 ¼ 0.307, t ¼ 2.411) and
H5b (b32 ¼ 0.454, t ¼ 3.363). Two hypotheses, in regard to the
relationship between ESCM practices and performance outcomes,

1 It is not conventional to report the signiﬁcance level of 0.1 in social sciences.
However, this practice is not unusual in current literature (Schmenner and Vastag,
2006; Eroglu and Hofer, 2011). According to Shah and Goldstein (2006), the
signiﬁcance level of 0.1 is rarely used in practice but recommended for reporting
statistical result.

are supported at p < 0.01: H6a (b43 ¼ 0.706, t ¼ 7.267) and H6b
(b53 ¼ 0.488, t ¼ 4.807). The hypothesis linking environmental
performance and business performance is supported at p < 0.01:
H7 (b54 ¼ 0.483, t ¼ 4.885). These ﬁndings are discussed next.

These empirical results suggest that mutual trust, organizational
compatibility, and top management support have direct effects on
strategic information sharing but not on operational information
sharing. Sobel’s test (see Table 4), however, suggests that these
three antecedents have positive and indirect effects on operational
information sharing through strategic information sharing. This
shows that ﬁrms with SSCP use strategic information ﬁrst to make
macro-decisions and then utilize operational information to make
supportive micro-decisions. In addition, the direct impact of top
management support on operational information sharing suggests
that top management’s awareness of operational details, as well as
the strategic big picture,
for establishing and
strengthening SSCPs.

is important

Fig. 2 also shows that a strong linkage exists between opera-
tional information sharing and ESCM practices. Although infor-
mation sharing is important for ESCM practices, operational
information sharing has greater impact on ESCM practices. Stra-
tegic information sharing is critical for planning purposes related to
front-end strategic supply chain partnerships while operational
information sharing has more impact on back-end ESCM practices
and performance outcomes. As supply chain processes exert
increasingly direct inﬂuence over performance outcomes, opera-
tional details and supply chain practices become more critical.
Thus, the results of this study illustrate the importance of infor-
mation integration for both SSCP and ESCM. These results
demonstrate that
(i.e.,
improved environmental performance and business performance)
require an effective integration of SSCP and ESCM.

sustainable competitive advantages

The results further show that ﬁrms implementing ESCM practices
realize tangible performance outcomes, such as improved environ-
mental performance, enhanced brand image, and improved sales
growth through facilitating SSCP. Our study indicates that ESCM
practices, such as using eco-design principles, basing supplier selec-
tion on environmental criteria, and using the 3R model (reduce, reuse,
and recycling), positively contribute to ﬁrms’ bottom line perfor-
mance. The empirical results support the conclusion that environ-
mental performance serves as an important intermediate operational
objective that is positively related to business performance (Angell
and Klassen, 1999; Jiménez and Lorente, 2001; Pullman et al., 2009).
Such environmental performance is assured when supply chains
partners, such as important suppliers, successfully meet and exceed
the standards for environmental hygiene that impress and attract
customers. Successful SSCPs enhance the dynamic relationships
among supply chain partners and therefore ensure sustained envi-
ronmental performance as well as business performance.

6. Discussion and conclusion

The results of this study offer valuable implications for managers.
trust, organizational

three antecedents

(e.g., mutual

First,

compatibility and top management support) may be considered as
a broad organizational level relationship infrastructure through
which effective information sharing (with quality and accuracy)
among the partners are achieved. Particularly, this study suggests


128

S. Youn et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 56 (2013) 121e130

that a well-established trust facilitates information sharing in stra-
tegic level. This result contradicts the notion that active information
sharing naturally builds trust among organizations. In typical supply
chain context, information sharing itself may not necessarily culti-
vate trust relationship. In reality, sharing sensitive environmental
information may have serious business implications. Thus, trans-
ferring environmental knowledge to other ﬁrms requires prior well-
established trust relationship.

Second, strategic supply chain partnership (SSCP) facilitates the
implementation of environmental supply chain management
(ESCM) practices. In rapidly changing market environment, SSCP
offers positive impacts on implementing ESCM practices which in
turn reap desirable performance outcomes. SSCP in the form of
active assistance for rapid recovery of supplier capabilities and real
time information sharing among partners is all the more critical in
case of major environmental disruptions.

Third, this study considers the Small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in South Korea. This study shows that it is the
large organizations that initiate ESCM; yet, it is the SMEs that
improve bottom line performance through implementation of
ESCM practices. The results of this study illustrate how Korean
ﬁrms have integrated SSCPs with ESCM in order to enhance their
broad product and service offerings in the global market. Future
research may include international comparative studies with ﬁrms

in Northeast Asia (e.g., China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea) and
Southeast Asia (e.g.,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and
Vietnam) as well as ﬁrms from Europe and North America.

India,

While this research explains important relationships among
SSCPs and enhanced performance outcomes, this study is not free
from limitations. First, this study used a single respondent from
each company. Future studies may replicate our method using
multiple respondents (or multiple methods) from each company.
Second, the data analysis procedures used in this study are based
on cross-sectional data. While the results of this study are valid,
a future longitudinal study with secondary data may lead to more
robust research results that examine the complex relationships
among other variables that are not included in this study. Third,
based on Korean contexts, our study suggests that even in a global
market, a broad range of SSCPs and environmental issues across
supply chains may require implementation of supply-chain-level
environmental practices. Future studies may explore further how
network of
supply chains address growing environmental
management challenges while wrestle with increasing complexity
in global supply chains.
