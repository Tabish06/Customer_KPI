Significant changes in customer demands for individualised offerings are causing firms to move away from
mass production strategies toward customisation. Many firms struggle in this migration because the
requirements for mass customisation (MC) differ greatly from those needed for mass production. As firms
strive to optimise their interactions with customers and suppliers to produce highly customised offerings at
near mass production prices, IT use along with customer and supply integration are important organisational
competencies. Research studies explore many facets of MC but, in regard to IT use for customer and supplier
integration, most focus on specific activities within the product design and development process. This study
extends the IT-enabled organisational capabilities line of research, using data collected from 220
manufacturers, to explore IT use in a comprehensive sense for planning, infrastructural, and operational
activities in various business processes intended to achieve MC. These findings suggest that comprehensive IT
use can enhance a firm’s integration efforts with customers and suppliers. These factors, in turn, drive
operational performance and MC, which lead to firm performance. Grounded in service-dominant logic
(SDL) theory, these findings provide theoretical and empirical support to explain why customer integration
may be a driving force in MC.

1. Introduction

Markets are changing rapidly because customers expect new, innovative, differentiate products that are suited to
their evolving individual needs and tastes (Piller et al. 2004, Chen and Chen 2008). These customer-centric markets
emphasise quick access to low cost, customised products rather than standardised, mass-produced goods (Duray
2002, Tu et al. 2004a, Aydin and Gu¨ ngo¨ r 2005, Liu et al. 2012). ‘‘The MC concept is simple, providing personalised
products at reasonable prices,’’ (Duray 2002, p. 314). While the concept may be simple, coupling manufacturing
systems designed for efficient mass production with requirements for customisation has proven to be challenging
(Yassine et al. 2004, Ben-Arieh et al. 2009, Cattani et al. 2010). Highly distributed, global manufacturing systems
increase the need for information coordination with customers and suppliers and contribute to the challenges of
achieving mass customisation (MC) (Liu et al. 2008). Understanding that a customer’s unique requirements are
fundamental to MC has led firms to view customers as strategic partners in the value creation process (Piller et al.
2004). At the same time, the role of suppliers has become critical because they are asked to design, produce, and
deliver a large number of differentiated parts and components in small quantities with short lead times and high
quality (Pine 1993, Tu et al. 2001). As the number of parts in the value chain increases and global sourcing expands,
the decisions required to coordinate activity expand geometrically so it is not surprising that MC is characterised by
intense information flow in the value chain (Piller et al. 2004).

Companies use information technology (IT) to connect with customers, enabling them to recognise individual
preferences, tailor products accordingly, produce in a timely manner, and sell at a reasonable price (Sophie Lee et al.
2000). IT allows firms to work closely with suppliers, sharing accurate and timely information related to product
designs, process improvements, and delivery activities so strategic goals, operational performance targets, and
customisation objectives are attained (Tracey et al. 1999, Dean et al. 2009). These trends have led scholars to suggest
IT as a key antecedent to MC (Tu et al. 2004a, Bateman and Cheng 2006). This notion is consistent with the
IT-enabled organisational capabilities literature which suggests that researchers should look beyond the direct

effects of IT on firm performance, and unpack ways in which IT enables key organisational capabilities, such as MC
(for example Pavlou and El Sawy 2006, Rai et al. 2006, Benitez-Amado et al. 2010a, Ghobakhloo et al. 2011). Many
studies investigating IT and MC have focused on product development (Tan and Vonderembse 2006) or product
design (Yassine et al. 2004), suggesting that IT can have a positive influence on MC. These studies bring valuable
understanding to specific IT-related activities, such as information processing, information coordination, and
information integration within the specific context of product development (see Yassine et al. 2004). However,
opportunity remains to extend scholarly research in IT and MC to a broader context which includes the managerial
practices and organisational infrastructure needed for success (Tu et al. 2004a) such as customer and supplier
integration.

At a high level, this study addresses an important gap in the literature by exploring key intervening variables
capable of linking IT use and firm performance in the context of MC (Albadvi et al. 2007). In doing so, this research
informs ‘‘the elusive link between IT and financial performance [which] calls for further research into intermediate
organisational variables through which IT may influence firm performance,’’ (Tanriverdi 2005, p. 311). Specifically,
the present study investigates how the use of IT for a comprehensive set of strategic, operational, and infrastructural
activities can influence managerial practices related to customer and supplier integration. These factors impact MC
as well as operational and firm performance. This study acknowledges and explores the strategic aspects of IT in
working with customers and suppliers to make complicated, strategic decisions that improve performance.

2. Theoretical framework and hypothesis development

In the 1987 book, Future Perfect, Stanley Davis coined the term ‘‘mass customisation’’. However, it was Pine (1993)
who is credited with bringing MC into the operations management field. The concept quickly gained relevance as
recognised by Lau (1995) who suggests that MC may be the basis of the next industrial revolution. Since Davis
(1987), scholars have advanced definitions for MC that centre on the ability of a firm to produce a variety of
customised products quickly, on a large scale, and at a mass production cost (Pine 1993). More specifically, Pine
(1993), Tu et al. (2001), and others claim that MC is the ability to design, produce, and deliver products quickly to
meet specific customer needs at a price close to mass production. Researchers suggest that MC is possible because IT
reduces the trade-off between variety and productivity and provides transparent communication between a firm and
its trading partners (Tu et al. 2001).

IT is an impetus for a new logic in value creation that centres on collaboration with customers and suppliers
(Day 2006). This concept, service-dominant logic (SDL), posits that the focus is shifting away from tangibles (skills,
information, and knowledge) toward intangibles (interactivity, connectivity, and ongoing relationships (Vargo and
Lusch 2004)). Today, customers and suppliers are no longer external recipients of value created within the focal
firm, but instead are ‘‘co-creators of value in a network,’’ (Lo Nigro et al. 2006, Schmenner et al. 2009, p. 343).
Value co-creation has emerged as IT has enabled real time, comprehensive information exchange that facilitates
integration with customers and suppliers (Lambert and Garcia-Dastugue 2006, Liang et al. 2010). MC is one of the
phenomena feeding this value co-creation logic (Day 2006, Zhang and Chen 2008). Scholars recognise that the
‘‘Mass Customisation environment and the transition of customers from being service [value] recipients to service
[value] co-producers are closely intertwined,’’ (Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006, p. 170). Thus, IT enables
process integration that leads to the development of a higher-order capability for MC and improved firm
performance (see Rai et al. 2006, Wu et al. 2006, Ghobakhloo et al. 2011).

In advancing MC research, scholars have developed measures for MC (Tu et al. 2001), explored strategies such
as postponement (Su et al. 2005), created configurational approaches to MC (Duray et al. 2000), and examined
tactics including better practices for inventory control, planning, and channel management (Duray 2004). In
contributing to this body of research, the present study explores IT across a variety of business activities and
processes. Specifically,
it examines the necessary relationships among IT use (the planning, operational and
infrastructural perspectives), customer and supplier integration, MC, operational performance, and firm
performance. These relationships are illustrated in the framework in Figure 1 and are examined through the
customer value co-creation scholarly stream (Piller et al. 2004). In this way, IT use (including infrastructure)
influences firm performance mediated by intangible capabilities such as the management of knowledge assets from
customers and suppliers, as well as operational capabilities (Huang et al. 2006). This is consistent with the business
value generation process framework put forth by Melville et al. (2004) conceptualising linkages among IT use,

business processes, business process performance, and finally organisational performance. Table 1 provides a
definition for each variable and summarises the literature.

2.1 Service-dominant logic theory

SDL and its core theme value co-creation are gaining traction in the operations management literature (Schmenner
et al. 2009). Specifically, the goods dominant view is giving way to a paradigm that emphasises the influential role of
the customer in co-creating value in an integrative process that develops and delivers products that better meet the
needs of the customer (Vargo and Lusch 2004). The mass production approach placed the customer outside of the
value creation process (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004). From this perspective, each company reserves a position

in the value chain with suppliers providing inputs while the focal firm adds value to the product before advancing it
downstream (Normann and Ramirez 1993). Porter’s (1980) value chain epitomised the unilateral role of the focal
firm in value creation (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004). Today, firms don’t simply add value, they strive to develop
value creation systems consisting of ‘‘suppliers, business partners, allies, and customers [who] work together to
co-produce value,’’ (Normann and Ramirez 1993, p. 66).

Co-creating value is based on the notion that knowledge is a key source of competitive advantage (Vargo and
Lusch 2004). Value co-creation requires an integrated set of economic actors who use IT to motivate this integration
(Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004). Thus, ‘‘the efficacy of a MC strategy depends on the technological skills and
resources at the disposal of the firm to harness a vast amount of information about customers, tailor the product to
meet the needs of individual customers, and deliver customised products,’’ (Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006,
p. 176). Bateman and Cheng (2006) highlight these as key areas for integration for the firm – IT use, MC, and
manufacturing capabilities. In this way, IT lays a foundation for ‘‘customer-oriented production systems [to] allow
the individual customer to specify product characteristics,’’ thereby participating in value co-creation (Aydin and
Gu¨ ngo¨ r 2005, p. 1144).

2.2 IT use

IT is sometimes viewed as back-office support that is limited to automating clerical functions and creating exception
reports (Kim and Narasimhan 2002). But, IT can have a strategic role and a direct and favourable impact on value
creation by building linkages with a firm’s customers and suppliers (Soroor et al. 2009) that lead to better products,
enhanced productivity, higher quality, better equipment utilisation, reduced space needs, and increased flexibility
(Kim and Narasimhan 2002). Porter and Millar (1985) asserted that IT use has a significant influence on activities of
the firm by creating more value for customers, integrating information and material flows, and facilitating the
development of new value chains. This occurs through the use of a variety of IT applications ranging from strategic
(planning) to operations (Soroor et al. 2009).

Narasimhan and Kim (2001) propose measuring information systems (IS) utilisation with three sub-constructs:
(1) IS for infrastructural support (for example, accounting information systems and office information systems);
(2) IS for value creation management (for example, production plan and process control, sales and price
management, and inventory and warehouse management), and (3) IS for logistical operations (for example,
transportation management, automatic ordering, and warehouse location selection). They make two primary
arguments regarding the strategic use of IS. First, the role of IS must be raised from information processing to value
chain transformation. Second, IS should not only automate and improve the physical aspect of value creating
activities, but should create and optimise the structural connections among customers and suppliers.

Building on the work of Narasimhan and Kim (2001), this study defines IT use as the extent to which firms apply
computers and IT to support infrastructure and operational decision making and assist in strategic planning.
Network designs and office information systems are types of IT infrastructure that enable firms to reduce costs by
automating clerical functions. Such efficiencies can benefit customers, but may do so without being explicitly
apparent (Narasimhan and Kim 2001). For example, production scheduling and inventory control were previously
managed by operators, but now are handled with automated IT systems that improve outcomes and lower costs.
Another way firms benefit from IT use is to capture and organise information for strategic decision making. Shortell
and Zajac (1990, p.828) suggest that a firm’s IT ‘‘planning system provides the basis for deciding what new markets
to pursue.’’ Kyobe (2004) purports that IT planning plays a significant role in developing core and distinctive
competencies, which enable a firm to create competitive advantage. Thus, IT use has three sub-constructs: planning
IT, operational IT, and infrastructural IT. Portions of the instrument from Narasimhan and Kim (2001) are adapted
for the operational IT and infrastructural IT sub-constructs. The planning IT sub-construct was developed for this
study.

Planning IT is the extent to which a firm uses IT to formulate, justify, and improve long-range business planning
and decision making (see Soroor et al. 2009). Planning IT is how well an organisation uses IT for strategic reasons
such as long-term planning, proactiveness and internal and external analysis (Sabherwal and Chan 2001). It includes
long-term technology plans, budget plans, investment justification, capacity plans, project analysis, competitor
analysis, and industry study.

Operational IT is the extent to which a firm uses IT for monitoring, justifying, improving, and controlling day-
to-day operational decision processes (Sabherwal and Chan 2001). This captures IT use for value creation activities


International Journal of Production Research

52531

(Narasimhan and Kim 2001). Operational IT usage promotes the improvement of daily operations to meet
operational goals (for example, production and quality control, warehouse and space management, customer and
supplier relationship management, inventory management, material planning, and order fulfilment).

Infrastructural IT is the extent to which a firm uses IT to facilitate information sharing and data communication,
recommend standards for IT architecture, implement security, and coordinate work activities within the firm.
It concerns the improvements of information systems and information sharing to harmonise the efforts of managers
from different parts of the organisation, and it enables them to make decisions that are consistent with company
goals (for example, setting up data communication facilities, planning and control systems, and disaster recovery
system).

2.3 Customer and supplier integration

Lambert and Garcia-Dastugue (2006, p. 150) point out that ‘‘failure to integrate activities effectively will hinder
management’s ability to make the entire value system work (Normann and Ramirez 1993).’’ Integrative
relationships can be facilitated by the continuous automation and standardisation of internal logistics functions,
efficient information sharing, and strategic linkages with suppliers and customers. Scholars such as Narasimhan and
Kim (2002) have examined outcomes of such integration, including performance. Their instrument has three
dimensions: (1) integration across the supply chain, (2) a company’s integration with customers, and (3) a
company’s integration with suppliers. Considering the interface of IT, Frohlich and Westbrook (2002) and
Frohlich (2002) studied the effect of web-based integration on operational performance. They measured
web-based integration as: e-integration with suppliers and customers. This study builds upon these studies to
explore customer integration and supplier integration. The instruments for these measures are adapted
from Frohlich (2002), Frohlich and Westbrook (2002), Koufteros et al. (2005), Peterson et al. (2005a), and
Peterson et al. (2005b).

Customer integration (CI) is the extent to which purchasers take part in value creating activities and processes
that previously had been in the domain of a firm (Wikstrom 1996). This includes assessing customer needs and
tailoring internal activities to meet them (Koufteros et al. 2005). When firms know their customers and become
committed to understanding and meeting their needs, a strong bond is forged between firms and their customers.
Integration ensures that the voice of the customer is heard and incorporated into a firm’s outputs.

Supplier integration (SI) is the extent to which vendors form cooperative relationships by taking part in activities
and processes that had previously been in the domain of the firm. It is characterised by a long-term commitment
between the collaborators, open communication, and mutual trust. Supplier partnerships involve participants early
in the product life cycle; thus ensuring early supplier involvement in product design and access to superior supplier
technologies (Narasimhan and Das 1999, Petersen et al. 2005a, 2005b).

2.4 Mass customisation

Boynton et al. (1994) further developed the MC concept by comparing it with mass production, invention, and
continuous improvement in a product/process change grid. This illustrates the movement away from mass
production, suitable for stable environments, toward MC, viewed as more effective in dynamic environments.
Recognising the important role of speed, Tu et al. (2001) define MC as the ability to produce differentiated products
with cost effectiveness, volume effectiveness, and responsiveness. Steger-Jensen and Svensson (2004) describe MC as
involving processes and organisational structures aimed at providing varied and many times individually customised
goods and services at low costs typically found in mass produced products. Consistent with the literature
(Kotha 1995, Duray et al. 2000, Steger-Jensen and Svensson 2004, Tu et al. 2004a, 2004b), this study develops a
measure of MC capability manifested in customisation volume effectiveness – the ability to add product variety
without sacrificing production volume, customisation responsiveness – the ability to reorganise manufacturing
process quickly in response to customer requirements, and customisation cost-effectiveness – the ability to
customise products without increasing manufacturing costs. This study defines MC as the extent to which a firm
demonstrates the ability to produce a variety of customised products quickly, at a scale and cost comparable to mass
production.

2.5 Operational performance

Operational performance (OP) indicators are often used to measure the effects of CI and SI activities on functional
outcomes. Considerable agreement exists among academics that the performance of manufacturers can be evaluated
by one or more competitive priorities (Hayes and Wheelwright 1984, Christiansen et al. 2003). Competitive priorities
are often organised into five areas: quality, delivery, cost, flexibility, and innovation. For example, Taps and Steger-
Jensen (2007) examined order winners and manufacturing capabilities such as flexibility, delivery reliability, cost
efficiency, and product innovation. Frohlich and Westbrook (2002) studied the effects of the type of web-based
demands and supply integration. They used OP as a dependent variable. The benefits of such integration included
faster delivery time, reduced transaction costs, greater profitability, and higher inventory turnover. Research
indicates that integration is positively related to capabilities such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and/or cost
(Khurana and Talbot 1998, Roth 1998, Liu et al. 2012). Consistent with prior research, this study defines OP as the
extent to which a firm achieves its operational goals, specifically related to delivery reliability, process flexibility,
cost leadership, innovation, and product quality.

2.6 Firm performance

Firm performance (FP) is the extent to which a firm fulfils its market and financial goals. Wisner (2003) studies the
effects of supply chain management strategy on FP, which can be measured by market share, return on assets,
overall product quality, overall competitive position, and overall customer service level. FP is a key outcome
measure given that a firm’s manufacturing capabilities such as cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery can be linked to
its competitive priorities (Taps and Steger-Jensen 2007). Rosenzweig et al. (2003) used four items to measure
business performance including pre-tax return on assets, percentage of revenues from new products, overall
customer satisfaction, and business unit sales growth. Frohlich (2002) used two items to measure e-business
performance: annual percent of procurement using the Internet and annual percent of sales/turnover using the
Internet. Narasimhan and Kim (2002) used sales growth and market share growth with a three-year look-back,
profitability, return on investment, return on assets, revenue growth, financial liquidity, and net profit to measure
FP. With concern for rigor, and consistent with previous scholarly work, herein FP is measured by customer
retention rate, sales growth, return on investment, production throughput time, and overall competitive position.

2.7 Research hypotheses

As shown in Figure 1, firms that seek better performance in today’s customer-centric market may pursue MC.
In doing so, information integration, facilitated by IT at the strategic and operational levels, should occur among
supply chain partners (Sabherwal and Chan 2001).

2.7.1 IT use, customer integration, supplier integration, and operational performance

IT can provide planning support, critical infrastructure, and clerical activities that allow firms to function in an
inter-organisational context. IT systems benefit firms by facilitating innovation through enhanced marketing and
sales (Miles and Snow 1978) and greater operational harmony with supply chain partners (Sabherwal and Chan
2001). Value can also result from knowledge gained by sharing information and applying technology to enable the
supply chain to analyse and respond effectively to customer expectations (Paiva et al. 2008).

Responsiveness to customers comes as the result of internal and external integration (Tracey 2004). Internal
integration has been shown to be an antecedent of external integration (Tan and Tracey 2007), perhaps owing to the
need for a firm to possess the internal capacity to process external information (Tu et al. 2006). For example,
customer information can only be effectively used when a firm is internally integrated with systems such as ERP for
production planning and control (Turowski 2002). This is consistent with Devaraj et al. (2007) who found that IT
technology for advanced planning and scheduling can lead to both customer integration and supplier integration
(see also Kim et al. 2006, Rai et al. 2006). Integration enhances the firm’s capability to cope with growing quality
expectations, sophisticated customer demands, and other critical issues (Carter and Narasimhan 1996, Lo Nigro
et al. 2006). As firms move toward integrated customer and supplier activities, IT can facilitate order fulfilment
(Dean et al. 2009). Customers and suppliers favour IT to communicate order specifications and other information
among firms. As a result, electronic inter-connectivity has become a competitive necessity to reduce cost and

improve service (Bhatt 2000). Simulation techniques have even been employed to test the phenomenon as
Gangopadhyay and Huang (2004) show that advances in IT are key drivers of integrations and make information
sharing possible.

Through the use of networks, shared databases, and other IT systems, duplicate activities can be eliminated, thus
preventing errors, reducing cycle time in product development, and improving communication as firms move closer
to the customer (Lo Nigro et al. 2006). These activities serve as a foundation, enabling customers to participate in an
essential dimension of MC that of value co-creation (Piller et al. 2004, see also Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004,
Steger-Jensen and Svensson 2004). These supply chain practices can be enhanced by sharing information with
suppliers (Zhou and Benton 2007, Dean et al. 2009). This is consistent with value co-creation’s emphasis on
knowledge, and Day’s (2006) suggestion that IT enables universal connectivity to knowledge that was previously
dispersed among customers and suppliers and therefore difficult to reach. This is consistent with Callaway and
Dobrzykowski (2009, p.228), who suggest that ‘‘IT now connects, enables, and even motivates customers to
participate in value creation (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004).’’ Therefore, the following hypotheses are developed.

H1. Firms with a high level of IT use have a high level of customer integration.
H2. Firms with a high level of IT use have a high level of supplier integration.

In addition to being important for CI and SI, IT use impacts OP because it improves internal planning,
scheduling, decision making, and control (Soroor et al. 2009). IT use enables cross-functional integration, which
creates an environment where actors have access to the information, knowledge, and resources necessary for value
co-creation (Lambert and Garcia-Dastugue 2006). Such environments are referred to as value dense (Normann and
Ramirez 1993). In the context of value co-creation, scholars have suggested that ‘‘density is the new operations,’’
(Vargo and Akaka 2009, p.39). This sheds light on how internal activities have a direct impact on the firm’s ability
to improve efficiency and performance. In this way, IT is an enabler of key operational capabilities (Melville et al.
2004, Huang et al. 2006) such as innovation (Tarafdar and Gordon 2007, Benitez-Amado et al. 2010a) and cost
efficiency (Liang et al. 2010), and its impact OP should be assessed separately from the impact of integration on OP.
This is similar to Bharadwaj et al. (2007) who found that IT use as well as supply chain coordination are positively
related to operational performance. Having this relationship in the model provides further evidence that the impact
of external integration on OP is valid. Therefore, the following hypothesis is developed.

H3. Firms with a high level of IT use have a high level of operational performance.

2.7.2 Customer integration and mass customisation

In MC, integration with customers is done in an effort to understand their distinctive requirements. This makes CI
essential for providing a platform that enables information exchange and value co-creation (Piller et al. 2004, Merle
et al. 2010). A focus on value co-creation is facilitated through customer intimacy (Lambert and Garcia-Dastugue
2006). It seems self-evident that firms seeking MC must interact with the customer, otherwise what objectives/
outcomes would guide the customisation process? This process is more than just asking what the customer wants
because in many cases customers are bounded by what they know and believe to be possible. As a result, it is
important to involve customers in product development so the firm is able to understand how and for what purposes
the customers use the firm’s products. This is supported by Tu et al. (2004b) who found that customer closeness is
positively related to MC. CI can lead to product ideas that are quite different from the standard product and from
what other customers want. It is also important to seek follow-up feedback from customers and to use this
information to change how the firm meets changing customer requirements. Considering value co-creation, this is
consistent with the findings of Zhang and Chen (2008) who found that CI enhances the firm’s ability to provide
what the customer wants. Similarly, Kim et al. (2006) found that inter-firm coordination facilitates responsiveness to
customer needs. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed.

H4. Firms with a high level of customer integration have a high level of mass customisation.

2.7.3 Supplier integration and operational performance

Work practices, such as integrative activities with suppliers, as well as IT use are posited to influence operational
performance (Melville et al. 2004). Several research studies (for example, Narasimhan and Jayaram 1998, Frohlich
and Westbrook 2002, Devaraj et al. 2007) show the close relationship between supplier’s capability/performance and


2534
8

T. Jitpaiboon et al.

the firm’s OP. These studies support the claim that having suppliers involved in production planning, product
development, and logistics improves supplier performance, which, in turn, improves OP. Further, Rosenzweig et al.
(2003) examined supply chain integration and found no direct link to customer satisfaction or sales growth.
‘‘Rather, it appears that the benefits of integration must first be translated into operational capabilities, such as
product quality, delivery reliability, process flexibility, and cost,’’ (Devaraj et al. 2007, p.1204). This notion is
likewise supported by Kim et al. (2006) who found that the relationship among inter-firm coordination and
firm performance is mediated by the responsiveness of the supply chain, an intangible asset of the firm (see also
Huang et al. 2006). Therefore, the following hypothesis is developed.

H5. Firms with a high level of supplier integration have a high level of operational performance.

2.7.4 Operational performance, mass customisation and firm performance

Part of the foundation for achieving MC is the ability to achieve flexibility while attaining cost leadership, high
product quality, delivery reliability, and innovation. These factors, which are the essential elements of OP, are vital
for MC implementation success. So, MC not only requires the firm to integrate customer wants and needs, achieving
MC also requires the firm to attain these factors in its internal operational processes. This is supported by Liu et al.
(2006) who, in their high performance manufacturing (HPM) research project, found that many operational
practices such as feedback to the shop floor, autonomous maintenance, cellular manufacturing, multifunction
(flexible) employees, and continuous improvement and learning are associated with MC. Further,
in their
international study of value co-creation in MC, Hong et al. (2010, p. 566) surveyed over 700 manufacturers and
provided empirical support for the notion ‘‘that firms in pursuit of MC must first develop flexible and efficient
processes (Alfnes and Strandhagen 2000) prior to benefiting from IT.’’ Certainly, flexibility is key to MC
(Huang et al. 2010). Flexibility, innovation, and quick response provide the variety, custom fit, high performance,
and speed that customers expect (Chen and Chen 2008). Cost, quality, and delivery enable cost effectiveness, volume
effectiveness, and responsiveness. These attributes are enabled by SI (Zhou and Benton 2007) and position the
firm to respond effectively as a co-creator of value with the customer. Therefore, the following hypothesis
is developed.

H6. Firms with a high level of operational performance have a high level of mass customisation.

In addition to having direct, positive, and significant impacts on MC, the elements of OP also have direct,
positive, and significant impacts on FP. For example, flexibility enables a firm to be more responsive to its
customers and thus more competitive in the marketplace (Brabazon et al. 2010). Without considering the need for
customisation, as firms achieve high product quality and delivery reliability, customers are better satisfied so they
are more loyal and buy more products leading to sales growth. Cost reduction is a key aim for MC (Ben-Arieh et al.
2009), and innovation strengthens the firm’s position vis-a` -vis its competitors. As such, IT enabled intangible
capabilities can improve firm performance (Huang et al. 2006, Kim and Cavusgil 2009). Additionally, considering
the focus of this paper, IT has been shown to influence FP, mediated by dimensions of OP such as agility or
flexibility (Vickery et al. 2010). Therefore, the following hypothesis is developed.

H7. Firms with a high level of operational performance have a high level of firm performance.

2.7.5 Mass customisation and firm performance

FP is included as an endogenous dependent variable to address the question: will MC actually create higher value
for the firm? This remains a concern as firms shift from a mass production to an MC strategy. With mass
production, firms take advantage of economies of scale arising from long production runs and large orders/
shipments. Some firms have opted to reduce inventory and carrying cost by postponing the final configuration of a
product until customer requirements become clearer (Alderson 1960). This enables the firm to achieve Pine’s (1993)
goal for MC by providing enough variety of services so that most customers can find what they want at a reasonable
price. Another approach centres on involving customers at early stages of product design and manufacturing
(Rabinovich et al. 2003). In this way, firms can produce a differentiated product that meets customer need, avoid
product obsolescence and its associated costs (Pine 1993), and achieve better FP. Kotha (1995) provides empirical
evidence that customers believe that custom products have higher value. In addition, timely and accurate customer
information reduces the need for forecasting and the associated costs and errors. The process of value co-creation

provides value for both suppliers and customers in MC (Normann and Ramirez 1993, Piller et al. 2004). This value
results from the enablement of customisation, an intangible asset of the firm, and is expected to translate into FP
(Huang et al. 2006). These higher-order MC capabilities bring theoretical as well as practical benefit to the firm
(Ettlie and Ward 1997, Rai et al. 2006, Wu et al. 2006). Therefore, the following hypothesis is developed.

H8. Firms with a high level of mass customisation have a high level of firm performance.

3. Research methodology

Instrument development for all constructs was carried out in three phases: (1) literature review to identify the
domain of the constructs and generate the initial measurement items (Churchill 1979), (2) review by academic and
management experts, and (3) Q-sort (Moore and Benbasat 1991) using manufacturing managers. The Q-sort results
indicate acceptable convergence with the inter-judge raw agreement scores of 91%, overall placement ratio of items
93%, and the Kappa scores of 90%. The final survey items used in this study can be found in Appendix A.

A cross-sectional self-administered mail survey was conducted. A sample was obtained from the Society of
Manufacturing Engineers (SME), an internationally known organisation of manufacturing managers and engineers.
The initial mailing list of 4000 was randomly selected from the SME members in the East North Central and West
North Central regions. A total of 579 surveys did not reach the targeted respondents because of incorrect addresses,
235 responses stated that they would not participate and 14 surveys were returned empty. This left 3172 in the
eligible sample of which 220 surveys were returned providing usable responses. Thus, the response rate for the
survey is 6.94% (or 220/3172). A response rate of this size is typical in large-scale surveys that require information
from managers (Pflughoeft et al. 2003, Li et al. 2005, Devaraj et al. 2007, Braunscheidel and Suresh 2009).
Respondents were primarily employees holding the title of manager or supervisor (80.5%). Of these, 12.3% reported
the title of CEO or director with the balance reporting general management positions consisting of COOs, chief
manufacturing engineers, and vice presidents, among others. A self-assessment item measured each respondent’s
level of computer literacy ranging from 1: know nothing about computers, to 10: expert computer user. In an
attempt to test for bias between novice and expert computer users, the sample was bifurcated at the mean (m¼ 7.32)
and all of the variables under study were examined using t-tests. None of the variables in the model produced
statistically significant results indicating no difference between the novice and expert computer user groups. In terms
of industry, 71.81% of respondents represented rubber and plastic products (SIC 30), fabricated metal products
(SIC 34), industrial machinery and equipment (SIC 35), transportation equipment (SIC 37), and other miscellaneous
manufacturing industries (SIC 39). Annual sales ranged from $10 to over $100 million for 65% of responding firms,
with 24.1% generating 4 $100 million.
Non-response bias was tested by comparing results from the first (n¼ 148) and second (n¼ 72) mailings. This is a
commonly used method for testing non-response bias in operations management research (for examples, see
Narasimhan and Kim 2001, Tu et al. 2004b, Li et al. 2005, Swafford et al. 2006). Chi-square tests were performed on
sales volume and t-tests were performed on the summated scale of each construct (Armstrong and Overton 1977).
The results indicate no significant difference in the data between the early and late responders, suggesting that the
data is representative of the population.

3.1 Empirical results and hypothesis testing

Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to assess the measurement and structural properties of the
model (James et al. 1982, Swafford et al. 2006). This analysis was conducted using partial least squares (PLS). PLS
has long been employed in operations management research (see Sambamurthy and Chin 1994, Lee 1997) and its
general popularity is growing (Henseler et al. 2009). Recent examples of similar studies include Braunscheidel and
Suresh (2009) who used PLS to examine the influence of internal and external integration on supply chain agility,
and Rosenzweig (2009) who explored relationships among e-collaboration, operational performance, and business
performance. The increased popularity of PLS may be owing to its advantages over co-variance-based
SEM approaches in studies:

testing complex models, and (4) possessing a predictive orientation (Fornell 1982, Hsu et al. 2006,
Henseler et al. 2009).

4. Measurement model results

Content validity was determined through a comprehensive review of the literature, Q-sort, and assessment by a
panel of practitioners and academics to ensure that measurement items covered the domain of the construct
(Nunnally 1978, Churchill 1979). Cronbach’s 
, composite reliability, and average variance extracted (AVE) were
used to test reliability. See Table 2.

Convergent validity can be assessed by examining the individual item loadings on their theorised latent variables
(Swafford et al. 2006). Table 2 displays the standardised item loadings for the measurement models under study
(Swafford et al. 2006) as well as the path coefficients between the first and second order models (Braunscheidel and
Suresh 2009). All item loadings are sufficient to demonstrate convergent validity. An additional test of convergent
validity is provided by assessing AVE values for each construct (Segars 1997). A review of Table 3 reveals that all
constructs display AVE values 40.50, thus providing further evidence of convergent validity.

Evidence of discriminant validity exists if the AVE of each construct is greater than the square of the correlations
(Braunscheidel and Suresh 2009). An acceptable alternative suggests that the square root of a construct’s AVE

should be greater than the correlations between constructs (Fornell and Larcker 1981, Chin 1998, Koufteros 1999,
Koufteros et al. 2001). Table 4 displays the correlations between all latent constructs. The square root of the AVE
for each construct is bolded and can be found on the diagonal. Each is greater than the value of the correlations in
its corresponding row and column.

Finally, it is important to control for common method bias (CMB) prior to evaluating the structural model.
CMB can prove problematic in studies that employ survey method from single respondents for data collection by
inflating or deflating the relationships among variables (causing both Type I and Type II errors) (Podsakoff et al.
2003). Thus, certain preventive measures were undertaken during the data collection consistent with Rosenzweig
(2009). The data were also statistically tested for the presence of CMB following data collection. Harman’s (1967)

single-factor test is often used to assess CMB (Rosenzweig 2009). In this study, the data do not appear to fit the
single-factor model, nor does one factor account for a substantial amount of variance. Next, the single-method-
factor test advocated by Podsakoff et al. (2003) was employed. After controlling for the effects of the latent method
factor, all of the path loadings of the hypothesised items remained statistically significant on their target constructs
and the average item variance explained by the substantive constructs was substantially greater than those linked to
the latent method factor. Further, only a few of the latent method factor coefficients were statistically significant.
Thus, the presence of CMB is unlikely (Podsakoff et al. 2003, Rosenzweig 2009).

5. Structural model results

The results from assessment of the structural model appear in Table 5. Firm size was included in the structural
model as a control variable for all of the endogenous variables. All hypothesised relationships are statistically
significant at p 5 0.05 level or better, while firm size was not statistically significant on any of the endogenous
variables in the model. Hypothesis 1 is supported (
 ¼ 0.34, t¼ 4.49), which suggests that IT use has a direct impact
on CI. Hypothesis 2 is supported (
 ¼ 0.33, t¼ 4.74), which lends support that IT use has a direct impact on SI.
Hypothesis 3 is supported at the p 5 0.05 level (
 ¼ 0.19, t¼ 2.48), which indicates that a high level of IT use leads to
a high level of OP. Hypothesis 4 is supported (
¼ 0.25, t¼ 3.85) indicating a high level of CI leads to a high level of
MC. Hypothesis 5 is supported (
¼ 0.32, t¼ 4.56). This suggests that a high level of SI leads to a high level of OP.
Hypothesis 6 is supported (
¼ 0.37, t¼ 6.72), which lends support to the claim that OP is positively related to MC.
Hypothesis 7 is supported (
¼ 0.30, t¼ 4.90), which implies that OP may have a direct effect on FP. Finally,
Hypothesis 8 is supported (
¼ 0.26, t¼ 3.60), which implies that MC may have a direct effect on FP. PLS offers
researchers the advantage of providing R2 values for all endogenous variables in the structural model. The R2 value
is an estimate of the degree to which the endogenous variable is explained by its predictor(s). In the present model,
R2 values range from 0.11 to 0.27 (CI¼ 0.11, SI¼ 0.11, MC¼ 0.27, OP¼ 0.17, and FP¼ 0.23) suggesting that the
variables in the model provide a reasonable explanation for the phenomena under study. These R2 values are
comparable to other similar studies of supply chain integration (see Rai et al. 2006, Braunscheidel and Suresh 2009).

5.1 Mediation testing

The structural model includes mediation variables (for example, CI, SI, MC, and OP). Menor et al. (2007) describe
mediation variables as accounting ‘‘for the relation between the predictor and the criterion [variables],’’ (Baron and
Kenny 1986, p.1176). Additional testing began with the a priori conceptualisation of the structural model path
relationships based upon theory (SDL – value co-creation) and literature (James et al. 1982). Following Menor et al.
(2007), direct paths were added to the original mediation relationships. For example, ITU was linked to MC, SI
linked to FP, CI linked to FP, and so forth. Per Menor et al. (2007, p. 568), ‘‘the mediation effects are then evaluated
based on changes to the effect of the predictor variable on the criterion variable after controlling for an intervening
variable (Judd and Kenny 1981).’’ A detailed description of this procedure can be found in James et al. (2006). The
analysis reveals none of the direct paths added in the revised model produced statistically significant results.

Furthermore, all of the relationships hypothesised in the original model remained significant. This provides evidence
in support of the mediation relationships conceptualised in the original structural model.

5.2 Mean testing of high and low mass customisers

Further analysis is required to assist managers concerned with making decisions that are capable of advancing their
firms’ interest in MC. In other words, a contextual question is worthy of consideration: are all firms implementing
these practices or are these practices more widely adopted by effective mass customisers? This is particularly relevant
given that studies have shown differences in IT use given differing product goals (Durmusoglu and Barczak 2011).
In an attempt to inform this curiosity, the sample was bifurcated into high and low MC performers. This was done
by dividing the sample at the mean of MC (m¼ 3.28). The value is also the sample median. This resulted in a high
MC group (n¼ 129) and a low MC group (n¼ 91). T-tests were conducted to examine mean differences
between these groups for planning IT use, operational IT use, infrastructural IT use, CI, and SI. The results
appear in Table 6.
The results show that the mean differences between high and low MC groups are highly significant (p 5 0.01) for
planning IT use (t-value¼ 2.74) and CI (t-value¼ 5.33). SI (t-value¼ 1.98) is also significant at p 5 0.05, and
operational IT use (t-value¼ 1.71) and infrastructural IT use (t-value¼ 1.76) are marginally significant (p 5 0.1).
This not only shows important differences between the high and low MC groups, it also indicates that planning IT
use is greater in the high MC group than the low MC group. This seems logical because most manufacturers
regardless of the need for MC have adapted IT for operational and infrastructural uses. The high MC group appears
to recognise the value of planning IT use in working effectively with customers and suppliers to achieve the needed
integration.

6. Discussion and implications

Underpinned by the IT-enabled organisational capabilities literature stream and service-dominant logic, this paper
provides a research framework to understand how IT can be deployed in a broad and comprehensive way to achieve
CI and SI that facilitates MC, OP, and overall FP. From a scholarly perspective, this builds upon the opportunity
identified by Tu et al. (2004a) for exploring how IT can be an enabler of MC. In doing so, these findings unpack a
meaningful role for IT use in achieving financial performance in the developing context of MC (Tanriverdi 2005).
This extends the IT-enabled capabilities literature and positions MC as a higher order organisational capability
(Pavlou and El Sawy 2006, Rai et al. 2006, Wu et al. 2006, Benitez-Amado et al. 2010b, Ghobakhloo et al. 2011).
The results of the study also build upon and compliment previous literature (such as Yassine et al. 2004, Albadvi
et al. 2007), and can assist practitioners in a number of important ways.

The results suggest that IT use for planning, infrastructural, and operational actions can enhance a firm’s
integration efforts with its customers and suppliers. The ability to integrate with external partners is consistent with
and expands upon the understanding brought forth by Yassine et al. (2004) who suggested that firms can use IT for
information coordination and knowledge sharing in new product design. In addition, the t-test suggests that
planning IT use is more important for MC than is operational or infrastructural IT use. This is meaningful because
(1) it raises the use of IT from the operational to the planning level, consistent with the suggestion of Narasimhan
and Kim (2001), and (2) it extends IT use for MC to business processes beyond the NPD context of Yassine et al.
(2004). As a result, managers who seek to achieve higher levels of integration with customers and suppliers can

assume a more holistic view when making IT investment decisions, while those who are intently focused on MC are
well served to place particular emphasis on planning IT use. Building upon Yassine et al. (2004), who suggested that
managers pursue a balanced IT strategy, this study provides direction for managers regarding which activities and
IT-enabled business processes can be targeted for such investment.

Second, the comprehensive definitions employed in this study for IT use, CI, and SI provide insight into the
specific business processes and practices that managers can expect to enhance. These include customer demand
management, product development, distribution, and customer follow up. Additionally, it supports the work of
previous scholars such as Yassine et al. (2004) who suggest that the exchange of explicit information alone is
insufficient for MC and rather requires broader action to incorporate and integrate such information. Also
important for managers, these results provide useful insights into how IT can be deployed to support suppliers in
manufacturing, production planning, product development, logistics, inter-organisational crossover activities, and
business plan preparation.

Third, the findings support the claim that CI impacts MC. To achieve customisation, firms should involve
customers in product design, production, and distribution activities. These communications are two-way with a firm
seeking information about customer wants and, more importantly, how customers use the firm’s product (Vargo
and Lusch 2006) so the firm can see beyond current applications to provide products customers may not articulate.
Customers should also understand the capabilities of the firm so they can understand what is possible. The
knowledge gained from CI accompanies the need to link with suppliers. Most firms depend heavily on suppliers for
parts, components, and services. SI affects cost, quality, flexibility, delivery, and innovation, and has a direct impact
on the firm’s ability to achieve customised solutions in a timely manner and a low cost. Again, the t-test results add
value for managers seeking MC by drawing attention to the importance of CI and SI.

SDL theory implies an active role for both customers and suppliers. In this approach, a value dense environment
is created where customers have access to information, knowledge, and any other resources necessary to define and
create value (Normann and Ramirez 1993). If this customer-centric shift is indeed underway, these (t-test) results
would suggest that the importance of CI may have primacy over SI. Knowing this would be important to managers
seeking to invest in customer relationship and supplier relationship management technologies.

Fourth, in spite of the link between CI and MC, SI still has a substantial impact on OP. To strengthen support
for this relationship, the research model included the direct impact of IT use on OP. This impact, which is
documented in the IT and manufacturing literature, is included to ensure that the impact of SI on OP is in addition
to what can be achieved through IT use. Both relationships are significant at the p 5 0.05 level for IT on OP and
p 5 0.01 for SI on OP, which provides evidence for the link from SI to OP. While suppliers’ actions impact the firm’s
OP, it is the firm’s OP that has a direct and statistically significant impact on MC. The firm’s cost, quality,
flexibility, delivery, and innovation strongly influence the firm’s ability to achieve MC. This further illuminates the
research of Alfnes and Strandhagen (2000), Liu et al. (2006), and Hong et al. (2010). The firm’s OP, in turn,
significantly affects overall FP.

Finally, MC has a direct and positive impact on FP. Not only does this provide evidence to motivate continued
efforts for MC but, in investigating the direct effects, the findings suggest that CI does in fact mediate the
relationship between IT use and MC. For managers, this provides additional support not only for IT investment,
but also for effort in the area of integration.

7. Limitations and future research

While this research makes significant contributions from both a theoretical and practical point of view, it has
limitations. Though this study adequately measures important types of IT use, other key variables are extant which
are worthy of study, such as the quality of IT use (potentially measured in terms of IT investment), IT personnels’
skill, and/or intensity (frequency of usage). It is also possible that the measurement items for integration may be
limited because CI and SI may not be the only factors. However, to preserve parsimony in measurement, this study
includes only these two variables. Second, individual respondents (manufacturing managers and top managers) were
asked to respond to many issues including IT use, CI, SI, MC, OP, and FP. The use of a single respondent may
generate some measurement inaccuracy. Although these biases may be minimised by the sample size in this study,
future research should seek to utilise multiple respondents from each participating organisation in an effort to
enhance the reliability of research findings. Third, the response rate of approximately 7%, while comparable to
similar studies (see Tu et al. 2001, Tu et al. 2004b, Li et al. 2005, Tan and Tracey 2007), is less than hoped for.

A possible cause of the low response rate is the length of questionnaire. Because of time constraints, executives are
less likely to participate in a lengthy survey. This issue can be addressed by reducing the number of items in the
questionnaire and focusing on the areas requiring further clarification. Finally, customer characteristics vary based
on customer type, such as those of industrial clients versus individual consumers. These differences may influence
the nature of integration relationships. While the present study explores these customer types in an aggregate sense,
future research exploring them in a bifurcated fashion may yield interesting insights, particularly for Internet-based
or service firms.

Overall, this study confirms that IT use affects MC capabilities through CI, SI, and OP. Although it is widely
recognised that technology is a key enabler of CI and SI leading to successful MC, the types of technology used to
enhance cooperative relationships between a focal firm and its suppliers represents a missing link. Future research
should pay special attention to the types of technologies used to enhance CI and SI. Future research should also
examine how these relationships work for large versus small firms as well as firms in different industries.
