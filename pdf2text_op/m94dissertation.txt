ABSTRACT 

The quantitative correlational research study examined call center representatives’ perceptions 

about which leadership behaviors motivate, develop, and support job satisfaction in call centers 

in the electric utility industry.  Call centers experience high turnover rates, increasing 

organizational costs and diminishing service quality of internal and external customer 

interactions.  Employee job satisfaction is a major cause driving and achieving customer 

satisfaction.  Leadership is fundamental to employee job satisfaction, thus aiding the 

organization to achieve customer satisfaction.  A composite electronic survey assessed the views 

of call center representatives about leadership behavior styles of supervisors and job satisfaction.  

Multiple correlation and regression analysis provided the means for understanding the 

relationships between leadership behavior and job satisfaction.  The research study revealed four 

conclusions about leadership and job satisfaction in call centers in the electric utility industry.  

Relationships existed between leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction.  Transformational 

leadership predicted job satisfaction.  Contingent reward predicted job satisfaction.  

Transformational leadership was slightly better at predicting job satisfaction over contingent 

reward.  Call center management should create work environments encouraging of 

transformational leadership.  Call center management should develop supervisors with skills 

necessary and supportive of a transforming work environment capable of fostering job 

satisfaction of call center representatives. 

 


DEDICATION 

This dissertation is dedicated to the call center representatives across the electric utility 

industry dedicated to meeting and exceeding the needs of customers every day.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

For many organizations, call centers provide the single point of contact with their 

customers (Ellis & Taylor, 2006).  Organizations manage customer contacts by answering 

inbound calls from customers and making outbound calls to customers (Reynolds, Klenke, & 

Trickey, 2003).  Abbott (2004) defined a call center as “a group having a common function or a 

facility providing a place for a particular activity or service serving as a go-between, messenger, 

connection, or source of special information” (p. 1).  Customers have an expectation for 24-hour 

accessibility to service-based organizations (Holdsworth & Cartwright, 2003).  

Managing the customer experience that includes customer satisfaction and retention is 

important for organizations.  Kantsperger and Kunz (2005) suggested employee job satisfaction 

is a major cause driving and achieving customer satisfaction.  Management is fundamental to 

employee job satisfaction, thus assisting the organization to achieve customer satisfaction 

(Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 2006).  

The quantitative correlational research study examined call center representatives’ 

perceptions about which leadership behaviors motivate, develop, and support job satisfaction.  

Theinformation willallow a call center organization to develop and improve particular leadership 

behaviors that influence job satisfaction of call center representatives.  Chapter 1 provides the 

background and statement of the problem and delineates the purpose, significance, research 

questions, and hypotheses of the study.  The chapter furtheroutlines the theoretical framework 

and proposes the definitions, assumptions, scope, limitations, and delimitations of the research 

study. 

Background of the Problem 

In call centers, the focus is on multiple employees responding to customer needs.  The 


 

2 

centers handle the customer interactions for an organization and are the first and central point of 

communication (Gorjup, Valverde, & Ryan, 2008).  Call centers typically experience a 35% to 

50% turnover of staff per annum (IBISWorld, 2010).  In comparison, the turnover rate for 

industries in the United States was 3.2% for 2009, a significant difference from the turnover rate 

for call centers (U.S. Department of Labor, 2010b). 

Call centers have an organizational role to handle customer-initiated interactions 

including customer contacts received by telephone, standard mail, fax, e-mail, chat, and 

outbound calling for collection and customer notification purposes (Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; 

Gorjup et al., 2008).The call center representative’s position attracts unskilled people 

whoperform routine tasks and receive poor pay for their work efforts (Rose & Wright, 2005).  

The representatives must exhibit flexibility in work scheduling because of customer call patterns 

(Cartwright, 2003).   

Call center representatives experience high levels of performance scrutiny and 

monitoring because of advancements in technology (Barnes, 2007).  Technology creates the 

means for frequent and objective measurement of employee performance.  Technology further 

creates an environment intrusive and controlling of employee work and actions (Barnes, 2007; 

Cartwright, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2003).  

A dual role of responsibility to customers and employees exists for call centers 

(Parmelee, 2001).  Call centers have a responsibility to meet customer needsand ensure external 

and internal customers’ satisfaction (Bos, Donders, Bouwman-Brouwer, & Van der Gulden, 

2009; Cartwright, 2003).  Biggs and Swailes (2006) and Whitt (2006) claimed customer 

satisfaction is obvious by customer loyalty and competitive advantage within an industry.  Call 

centers have a responsibility to ensure satisfaction of employees, assessable in organizational 


 

3 

commitment, citizenship, and performance (Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Whitt, 2006). 

Employee job satisfaction is a major cause driving and achieving customer satisfaction 

(Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005).  Call center representatives have direct contact with the customers 

of an organization and act as ambassadors for the organization (Ojha & Kasturi, 2005).  

Management is fundamental to employee job satisfaction, aiding the organization to achieve 

customer satisfaction (Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 2006).  Call center leaders 

manage the customer experience including customer satisfaction and customer retention, along 

with the employee relationship.     

Two overarching principles facing the work environment of call centers include a focus 

on quantity and high employee turnover (Harney & Jordan, 2008).  Customer calls drive call 

center performance with little ability to predict exact call patterns and the quantity of calls.  

Historical data provide a surfeit of call information about quantity, queue times, and handle 

times, serving as the basis for predictive modeling.  The modeling allows call center managers to 

staff at levels consistent with historical call volumes, permitting effective cost control for the 

organization.  The focus is on answering many calls with few employees, often leading to a 

dilemma of quantity versus quality for call center managers.  Brannan (2005) identified a 

common tension existing in the nature of call centers—speed and accuracy.  The tension forces 

call center managers to look for quantitative imperatives and results, often to the detriment of the 

employee relationships. 

Statement of the Problem 

The general problem is call centers experience high turnover rates, increasing 

organization costs and diminishing service quality of internal and external customer interactions 

(Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & Mukherjee, 2004; Townsend, 2007).  Gorjup, 


 

4 

Valverde, and Ryan (2008) and Harney and Jordan (2008) suggested lower job satisfaction of 

call center representatives may contribute to turnover in call centers.  Holdsworth and Cartwright 

(2003) pointed out call center representatives possess lower job satisfaction than employees in 

the general working population.  The discoveriesof their study showed the causes of lower job 

satisfaction have roots in the lack of personal growth, the low degree of decision-making, limited 

job flexibility, and infrequent supervision-employee interaction.   

Supervisors within call centers are instrumental creating job satisfaction of employees, 

which in turn is importantto customer satisfaction (Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 

2006).  Call center supervisors can strengthen organizational commitment and working 

conditions for call center representatives with a focus on relationships within the work 

environment (Longo & Mura, 2008; McKee & Carlson, 2003; Piccolo & Colquitt, 2006).  

Thefocus promotes employee longevity and organizational commitment (Little & Dean, 2006; 

McKeown, 2009).  The specific problem is the unknown relationship of leadership behavior 

styles of call center supervisors to job satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric 

utility industry (Batt, Holman, & Holtgrewe, 2009; Ellis & Taylor, 2006; Maynard, Joseph, & 

Maynard, 2006).  

The quantitative correlational research study examined the perceptions of call center 

representatives on how leadership behaviors as demonstrated by call center supervisors 

effectively motivate and develop work environments supportive of job satisfaction and 

organizational commitment.  The population for theresearch study was employees in call centers 

in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The information allows a call center 

organization to develop and improve particular leadership behaviors that influence job 

satisfaction of call center representatives. 

 


 

Purpose of the Study 

5 

The purpose of thequantitative correlational research study was to evaluate the 

relationship of leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in six call centers serving 

one company in the electric utility industry in the United States.  Call centers in Corpus Christi, 

Texas; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Groveport, Ohio; Hurricane, West Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana; 

and Tulsa, Oklahoma participated in the study.  The research study further examined the 

relationship between leadership behavior styles of call center supervisors as perceived by call 

center representatives and the job satisfaction of call center representatives.  

Predictive variables as demonstrated by the call center supervisors includedthe styles of 

leadership as defined by Bass and Avolio’s (1990, 1993) model of full range leadership (FRL).  

The FRL model includes eight leadership behavior styles: (a) idealized influence, (b) 

inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual stimulation, (d) individualized consideration, (e) 

contingent reward, (f) management by exception-active (MBE-A), (g) management by 

exception-passive (MBE-P), and (h) laissez-faire.  Criterion variables influencing call center 

representatives’ job satisfaction included job satisfaction variables as defined by Smith, Kendall, 

and Hulin (1969) in their research to develop the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In General 

(JIG) scales: (a) work in present job, (b) present pay, (c) promotion opportunities, (d) 

supervision, (e) coworkers, and (f) job in general. 

A composite electronic survey assessed the perceptions of call center representatives 

about the leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction variables and collected demographic 

information.  The composite survey included the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), 

Job Descriptive Index (JDI) scale, Job In General (JIG) scale, and demographic items (Avolio & 

Bass, 2004; Smith et al., 1969).  The demographic information allowed exploration of 


 

6 

possibleregional differences among call centers (Balzer et al., 2000).  The electronic 

administration allowed ease of use by the participants,often eliciting a higher response rate from 

participants, and quick access to survey data for a researcher (Al-Omiri, 2007; Amar, 2008).  The 

research provided the data to assess possible relationships between leadership behavior styles 

and job satisfaction using multiple correlation and regression analysis. 

Significance of the Problem 

Significance of the study to the field.Turnover in the call center industry is high when 

compared to other industries (Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & Mukherjee, 2004; 

Townsend, 2007).  Turnover produces significant organizational costs for all industries including 

separation costs, learning costs, and acquisition costs (Udechukwu, 2009).  Thestudy provided 

industry-specific information on job satisfaction that has the potential to reduce turnover and 

related costs. 

Udechukwu (2009) suggested the treatment of employees by leaders within organizations 

impacts those factors attributable to employee turnover.  The positive impact of leaders 

contributes to satisfied employees who identify with the organization and demonstrate a 

commitment to stay with the organization as realized in increased employee performance and 

productivity.  The negative impact of leaders contributes to employee dissatisfaction as 

demonstrated in decreased organizational identification, commitment, performance, and 

productivity. 

Significance of the study to leadership.The information from the study provided insight 

into what influences job satisfaction for call center representatives from the leadership behavior 

perspective.  With the insight, call center leaders may develop an organizational 

environmentnurturing of job satisfaction and organizational commitment (Little & Dean, 


 

7 

2006;McKeown, 2009; Whitt, 2006).  Call center leaders may further create training and 

personal development programs for supervisors to nurture job satisfaction of call center 

representatives (Kirkbride, 2006). 

Nature of the Study 

Overview of the research method.The research study used a quantitativeresearch 

method as the intent is to understand relationships between leadership behaviors and job 

satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility industry.  The quantitative method measures 

variables, investigates relationships between variables, tests theories, and explores issues for 

large groups of individuals making the method suitable for the research problem (Arcidiacono, 

Procentese, & Di Napoli, 2009; Hanson & Grimmer, 2007).  Quantitative research determines 

relationships with a basis in finding reliability and validity of the research subject (Borrego, 

Douglas, & Amelink, 2009).  The qualitative research method was not appropriate, as the intent 

of the study was not to explore phenomenon of the predictive and criterion variables 

(Arcidiacono et al., 2009; Hanson & Grimmer, 2005). 

Overview of the design appropriateness.Multiple correlation and regression analysis 

provided the means for understanding the relationships that may exist in the research 

study.Specifically, the study explored two relationships: (a) the relationship of leadership 

behavior styles to job satisfaction and (b) the relationship of leadership behaviors to motivational 

components of job satisfaction.  Correlational analysis measured the strength of relationships 

between the predictive and criterion variables (Bobko, 2001; Miles & Shevlin, 2001).  

Theanalysis showed the existence of relationships but not cause of the relationships (Holmberg, 

Fridell, Arnesson, & Backvall, 2008).  Regression analysis investigated the effect of leadership 

behavior styles in predicting job satisfaction variables within call centers in the electric utility 


 

8 

industry.  The regressionanalysis described the association between the variables of the study 

(Bobko, 2001; Miles & Shevlin, 2001). 

Research Questions 

The research evaluated leadership behavior styles displayed by call center supervisors as 

perceived by employees in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The research further 

examined the relationship of leadership behavior styles and motivational components that 

influence job satisfaction, from the perspective of the call center representatives.  Thestudy 

soughtto answer these questions:  

RQ1: What is the relationship between the job satisfaction variables and each of the eight 

leadership behavior styles? 

RQ2: What is the likelihood that the transformational leadership behavior style predicts 

job satisfaction? 

RQ3: What is the likelihood that the contingent reward leadership behavior style predicts 

job satisfaction? 

Hypotheses 

The hypothesis is the way to state a research problem, providing a probable answer to the 

research questions (Thomas & Brubaker, 2008).  The authors claimed the hypothesis serves two 

purposes.  The hypothesis guides the process in solving the problem presented for research.  The 

hypothesis provides the intent of the research study.  Locke, Spirduso, and Silverman (2000) 

stated the hypothesis serves as a bridge between the theory behind the question or problem of the 

research study and the research.  The hypothesis serves as a declarative statement that becomes 

the basis for the research. 

The leadership behavior styles as displayed by the call center supervisors are the styles of 


 

9 

leadership as defined by Bass and Avolio’s (1990, 1993) model of full range leadership (FRL).  

The FRL model includes eight leadership behavior styles:(a) idealized influence, (b) inspirational 

motivation, (c) intellectual stimulation, (d) individualized consideration, (e) contingent reward, 

(f) management by exception-active (MBE-A), (g) management by exception-passive (MBE-P), 

and (h) laissez-faire.  Smith et al.’s (1969) Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In General (JIG) 

scales served as the basis for determining job satisfaction of call center representatives and 

include: (a) work in present job, (b) present pay, (c) promotion opportunities, (d) supervision, (e) 

coworkers, and (f) job in general. 

Walumbwa, Lawler, Avolio, Wang, and Shi (2005), Walumbwa, Orwa, Wang, and 

Lawler (2005), and Bennett (2009) identified transformational leadership as exhibiting a positive 

relationship on employee job satisfaction.The transformational leadership behavior style has four 

distinct aspects: (a) individual consideration, (b) intellectual stimulation, (c) inspirational 

motivation, and (d) idealized influence (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; 

Bass & Riggio, 2006).Bass, Avolio, Jung, and Berson (2003), Goodwin, Wofford, and 

Whittington (2001), Judge and Piccolo (2004), and Prabhakar (2005) considered contingent 

reward as both transactional and transformational leadership behaviors and a means of worker 

motivation. 

The following hypotheses provided the basis to evaluate leadership behavior styles 

demonstrated by call center supervisors and job satisfaction of call center representatives: 

H10: No relationship exists between job satisfaction of call center representatives and 

each of the eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in call centers in the 

electric utility industry. 

H1a:  A significant relationship exists between job satisfaction of call center 


 

10 

representatives and each of the eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in

Theoretical Framework 

Call centers in the electric utility industry experience a higher turnover rate than the 

turnover rate in call centers in other industries (Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & 

Mukherjee, 2004; Townsend, 2007).  Turnover produces significant organizational costs for all 

industries including separation costs, learning costs, and acquisition costs (Udechukwu, 2009).  

By understanding the influence of leadership on employee motivation and job satisfaction, call 

centers can secure employee longevity and organizational commitment (Little & Dean, 2006; 

McKeown, 2009).  

Motivation.Human motivation is the stimulus that energizes, directs, and sustains 

behavior.  Human motivation is the intensity, direction, and persistence of how humans interact 

with their environment.  In job settings, motivation accounts for the level, direction, and 

persistence of the expended effort at work.  Maslow (1987, 2000a) proposed a view of human 

motivation as an interaction of conscious and unconscious needs.  Theinteraction occurs within 


 

11 

the five levels of needs as defined by Maslow (1987, 2000a): physiological, safety, social, 

esteem, and self-actualization.  As the lower order needs (physiological, safety, and social) find 

satisfaction, humans find motivation to satisfy the higher order needs (esteem and self-

actualization).  Maslow (1987, 2000a)theorized that different contexts affect motivation, 

including environment, culture, and situation.  Udechukwu (2009) identified Maslow’s hierarchy 

of needs as drivers of behavior found in the work context and contributors to employee job 

satisfaction.  

Herzberg (1968) offered the two-factor theory of employee motivation, commonly 

referred to as the motivation-hygiene theory.  Thetheory concentrates on the idea that intrinsic 

and extrinsic needs influence work attitudes.  Extrinsic needs or hygiene factors are elements in 

the work environment that produce job dissatisfaction and include company policy, policy 

administration, interpersonal relationships with coworkers and supervisors, working conditions, 

salary, fringe benefits, and work environment.  Intrinsic needs or motivators are elements in the 

work environment that produce job satisfaction and include achievement, growth, promotion, 

recognition, and responsibility (Baldonado & Spangenburg, 2009; Poornima, 2009; Udechukwu, 

2009).  Baldonado and Spangenburg (2009) suggested motivators increase job satisfaction and 

effort to enrich these factors is advantageous for organizations with a concern for increasing job 

satisfaction.  

Job satisfaction.Job satisfaction is the emotion attached to a job.  Biggs andSwailes 

(2006) viewedjob satisfaction as a person’s attitude about his or her job.  The attitude is 

reflective of a person’s feelings about the job.  Maslow (1987) suggested job satisfaction results 

as a person receives motivation from the job in fulfilling esteem and self-actualization needs.  

Research shows two definitive ways to look at job satisfaction: as a multi-faceted or aggregate 


 

12 

variable reflective of the facets of a job or as a separate and single view general job satisfaction 

(Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Fichter & Cipolla, 2010). 

Organizational commitment.Organizational commitment is the identification 

employees possess with an organization resulting in high involvement in work and increasing 

organizational performance (Avolio et al., 2004).  Biggs and Swailes (2006) suggested 

organizational commitment is a multi-dimensional work attitude realized in a bond linking the 

employee tohis or her organization.  The attitude is evident as employees believe and accept 

organizationalgoals, often realized in extra effort exerted by employees for the organizationand 

an increased identification with the organization.  In Caykoylu, Egri, and Havlovic’s (2007) 

research study, job satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, and role ambiguity correlated with 

organizational commitment. 

Leadership.Leadership theories exist to explain what goes on between a leader and the 

followers in organizations.  Leaders in organizationsmanage energy as they work to meet the 

changing demands of the world (Clawson, 2006).  Leaders influence an organization as it moves 

toward its goals in society (Yukl, 2006).  Leaders “define the need for change, create new 

visions, mobilize commitment to these visions, and ultimately transform an organization” (Tichy 

& Devanna, 1990, p. 4).  

Transformational leadership goes further in meeting the followership needs of 

employees.  The transformational leader inspires a follower relationship in which all share and 

see the leader’s vision (Bass & Avolio,1990, 1993; Burns, 1978).  The connection leads to a 

spirit of “trust, admiration, loyalty, and respect toward the leader” (Yukl, 2006, p. 262), leading 

to a motivation of the followers to exceed the expectations and contribute to the vision for the 

organization.  Self-interest is no longer the accepted mantra.  Leaders and followers develop a 


 

13 

sense of and desire for the good of the whole, whether for the team or the organization. 

Clawson (2006) and Yukl (2006) discussed the behaviors characteristic of 

transformational leadership.  These behaviors include idealized influence, intellectual 

stimulation, individual consideration, and inspirational motivation (Clawson, 2006; Yukl, 2006).  

When the leader combines these behaviors, the leader can accomplish significant strides of 

change and accomplishment of the vision and mission (Nahavandi, 2006).  

Research highlightsa positive correlation of transformational leadership with employee 

motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment (Avolio et al., 2004; Choi, 2006; 

Seltzer & Bass, 1990; Walumbwa, Orwa, Wang, & Lawler, 2005; Walumbwa, Wang, Lawler, & 

Shi, 2004).  Avolio, Zhu, Koh, and Bhatia (2004) suggested transformational leaders encourage 

critical and creative thinking, promote and expect involvement, inspire loyalty, and recognize 

and appreciate the different needs of each follower.  Walumbwa, Orwa et al. (2005) found 

followers under transformational leaders exhibit a profound sense of involvement, satisfaction, 

empowerment, motivation, and commitment to organizations.  Followers also exhibited fewer 

withdrawal behaviors (Walumbwa, Orwa et al., 2005). 

Definition of Terms 

The following definitions serve to provide consistency of meaning for several terms 

significant to the study. 

Call center.A call center is the organizational entity consisting of a group of individuals 

responsible for inbound and outbound customer interactions andthe associated support and 

management personnel (Reynolds et al., 2003).  The group provides customer service, support, 

and order processing (Abbott, 2004).  The call center environment is rich in technology allowing 

automated call routing, customer information accessibility, and performance monitoring (Barnes, 


 

14 

2007; Cartwright, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2003).  

Call center representative.The call center representative is the individual who handles 

the inbound and outbound customer interactions (Wegge, Van Dick, Fisher, Wecking, & 

Moltzen, (2006).  Other common names for the call center representative include telephone 

representative, call center agent, call center associate, and customer service representative.  Call 

center representatives exhibit the characteristics of thoroughness, knowledgeableness, 

preparedness, courtesy, professionalism, and attentiveness in their interactions with customers, 

ensuring customer satisfaction with the interaction with the organization (Froehle, 2006; Sieben, 

De Grip, Longen, & Sorensen, 2009). 

Call center supervisor.The call center supervisor is the person who has front-line 

responsibility for a group of call center representatives.  The supervisor is responsible for 

monitoring and coaching call center representatives’ performance.  The supervisor provides 

procedural support to representatives (Ojha & Kasturi, 2005; Ramseook-Munhurrun, Naidoo, & 

Lukea-Bhiwajee, 2010).  

Leadership.Northouse (2007) suggested “leadership is a process whereby an individual 

influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal” (p. 3).  Leadership is a relational 

process between leader and followers.  Leadership has an influence component that affects 

followers into action.  Leadership occurs within a group of individuals with a commonality in 

purpose.  Leadership has a concern for goal attainment or task accomplishment that unites and 

benefits the individuals within the group and the group. 

Motivation.Motivation is the desire to satisfy individual needs and wants.  The 

satisfaction occurs when the physiologic, psychological, conscious, and unconscious 

requirements of an individual are met (McGregor, 2006).  Maslow (1987, 2000a) proposed a 


 

15 

view of motivation as an interaction of conscious and unconscious needs occurring within five 

levels of needs: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization.  Two categories of 

human motivation are: (a) intrinsic or motivation that comes from within a person’s being or the 

task itself and (b) extrinsic or motivation that comes from outside a person’s being (Herzberg, 

Mausner, & Snyderman, 1993). 

 

Job satisfaction.Job satisfaction is the cognitive and affective reaction to a job by an 

individual based on the comparison of personal needs and perceived job outcomes (Brown & 

Lam, 2008; Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Staw & Cohen-Charash, 2005; Udechukwu, 2009).  Two 

general approaches to job satisfaction include a global approach and a facet approach (Brown & 

Lam, 2008).  The global approach views job satisfaction as an inclusive feeling toward a job.  

The facet approach views job satisfaction from the different facets of a job that can include 

growth, pay, benefits, supervision, coworkers, the work itself, organizational environment, and 

work conditions (Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Fichter & Cipolla, 2010). 

Assumptions 

In theresearch study, several assumptions guided the study and influencedthe results.  The 

participants responded honestly to the survey questions presented in the survey instrument used 

in the study.  The participants had sufficient understanding of the technology of computers to fill 

out the survey instrument on a website with minimal difficulty.  Because of the call center 

representatives’ propensity for technology, the challenges in using technology and accessing the 

survey aresmallfor the participants in the survey of the research study.  Technology in the call 

centers requires representatives to interact using websites to view and obtain information used in 

meeting customer needs. 

 

 


 

Scope and Limitations 

16 

The scope of theresearch study was a random sample from the528call center 

representatives employed by a call center organization in the electric utility industry in the 

United States.  Thecall center organization has six call centers in the United States in Corpus 

Christi, Texas; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Groveport, Ohio; Hurricane, West Virginia; Shreveport, 

Louisiana; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Call center representatives volunteeredto participate following 

an announcement of the research study.  With such volunteer participation, the potential for 

sample bias and statistical error waspossible.  

The research study useda survey instrument for collecting call center representatives’ 

perceptions of leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction.  The call center representatives 

accessed the survey instrument by a website link provided in an e-mail by the researcher.  With 

such a means for collection of data, the participants in the research study self-reported his or her 

perceptions, leading to the possibility for false reporting.  

No membership organization for call center representatives exists in the United States to 

draw potential participants for the research study.  The research study used a particular call 

center organization in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The call center 

organization offered six geographic locations that ensured a diverse population to draw potential 

participants for thestudy.The use of a particular call center organization presented pressures for 

participation in the research study.  The pressures for participation are both positive and negative 

with call center representatives urged to participate or not to participate from the various levels 

of the call center leadership. 

Delimitations 

The research study evaluated if relationships exist between leadership behavior styles and 


 

17 

job satisfactionin call centers in the electric utility industry in the United States.  Theresearch 

study evaluated call centers in the electric utility industry and not centers in other industries.  

Although all call centers process inbound and outbound customer calls, the nature, emphasis, and 

criticality of the work varies between industries (Batt et al.,2009).  Thevariance includes 

different work environments, employee credentials, and administration different from that for 

call centers in the electric utility industry.  Generalization of discoveries to all call centers is 

questionable, limiting the ability to make definitive analysis and statements for call centers 

across all industries (Trochim & Donnelly, 2007; Vogt, 2007). 

Summary 

Call centers handle customer interactions and provide the first and central point of 

contact and interaction for organizations (Gorjup et al., 2008).  Managing the customer 

experience that includes customer satisfaction and retention is important for organizations.  

Kantsperger and Kunz (2005) suggested employee job satisfaction is a major cause in driving 

and achieving customer satisfaction.  Call centers experience a high turnover rate, thus 

increasing organizational costs and diminishing service quality of internal and external customer 

interactions (Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & Mukherjee, 2004; Townsend, 2007).  

Lower job satisfaction of call center representatives contributes to turnover in call centers.  Call 

centers have a dual role of responsibility in ensuring customer satisfaction and employee 

satisfaction.  The responsiveness remains with organizational management to meet and exceed 

expected levels of customer and employee satisfaction (Bos et al., 2009; Cartwright, 2003).  

The research study examined call center representatives’ perceptions about which 

leadership behaviors motivate, develop, and support job satisfaction.  The primary focus of the 

study was call centers in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The information from 


 

18 

the study will permit call center organizations to develop and improve particular leadership 

behaviors that influence job satisfaction.  As leaders influence job satisfaction, call centers can 

positively affect turnover rates.  Chapter 2 provides a review of the research literature on 

motivation, job satisfaction, leadership, organizational commitment, and call centers.  The 

review will provide a historical and theoretical review to investigate the interrelatedness of 

human motivation, employee job satisfaction, and leadership behaviors at work in organizations 

that supports the research study.

CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 

The purpose of thequantitative correlational research study wasto evaluate the 

relationship of supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in six call 

centers serving in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The research study further 

examined the relationship between leadership behavior styles of call center supervisors as 

perceived by call center representatives and motivational components that influence job 

satisfaction of call center representatives.  Thereview of the literature investigated the 

interrelatedness of human motivation, employee job satisfaction, and leadership behaviors 

influencing organizations and specifically, calls centers. 

Documentation 

In preparing theliterature review, the databases available through University of Phoenix’s 

Library (ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and Gale PowerSearch databases) provided the means to locate 

articles and related documents available for theresearch study.  Keyword searches on such words 

and phrases as leadership, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, turnover, human 

motivation, and call centers provided listings of literature pertinent to the topics considered for 

thereview.  An examination of database results determined relevant literature to thestudy served 

as the impetus for the review and discussion of the topics found in thechapter.  Table 1 contains a 

summary of the literature used for the literature review.  “Recent References” are those resources 

on or after January 1, 2005.  “Other References” are those resources published prior to January 1, 

2005. 

Even with the proliferation across industries and the organizational necessity of call 

centers as suggested by Batt, Holman, and Holtgrewe (2009) and Ellis and Taylor (2006), the 

review of the literature suggested a lack of research specific to call centers.  Maynard, Joseph, 


 

20 

and Maynard (2006) identified a lack of research on call centers evident from the database 

searches conducted in preparation for the literature review.  Sprigg and Jackson (2006) observed, 

“the need for greater design rigor in research on call center, and it would also be helpful to 

incorporate behavioral measures such as performance and turnover” (p. 209).

Human Motivation and Job Satisfaction 

A review of literature identifies the factors of human motivation found to contribute to 

job satisfaction.  The contributory nature suggests the interrelatedness of human motivation and 


 

21 

employee job satisfaction.  Thereview provides a survey of the germinal theories and current 

literature relevant to human motivation and job satisfaction.  

Historical overview on human motivation and job satisfaction.The conscious and 

unconscious reactions to physical, psychological, social, and cognitive stimuli result in human 

behavior.  Understanding how and why humans act or react to these stimuli has been intriguing 

for researchers for many years.  By evaluating satisfaction from the viewpoint of (a) the physical 

and psychological needs, (b) the relationship between tasks and rewards, or (c) a blend of needs, 

task, and rewards of work design allows understanding how human motivation leads to job 

satisfaction.  

Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) hierarchy of needs theory viewed human motivation as an 

interaction of conscious and unconscious needs seeking fulfillment in an individual’s life.  

Herzberg et al.’s (1993) motivation-hygiene theory suggested intrinsic needs or motivators 

produce job satisfaction and extrinsic needs or hygiene factors produce job dissatisfaction.  

Latham and Locke’s (1979) goal-setting theory focused on the implications of goal setting on 

employee motivation affecting job performance and job satisfaction.  Vroom (1995) and Lawler 

and Porter (1967) suggested the expectancy theory proposes motivation for work performance 

and job satisfaction results from an association between task and rewards.  Hackman and 

Oldham’s (1980) job characteristics theory offered certain core job elements foster job 

satisfaction and by assessing the motivational potential of jobs allows job redesign to influence 

positively job satisfaction.  Understanding human motivation in relationship to work provides 

perspective on the effects of human motivation on job satisfaction.  With such an understanding, 

organizations and leaders can foster such an environment for improved and consistent job 

satisfaction for employees. 


 

22 

Motivation is the direction and persistence that influences behavior toward achieving 

goals and finding satisfaction (Wilson & Madsen, 2008).  Human motivation energizes, directs, 

and sustains behavior (Robbins, 2005).  Human motivation is the intensity, direction, and 

persistence of individual interaction with his or her environment.  In job settings, motivation 

accounts for the level, direction, and persistence of the expended effort for task and goal 

completion.  

Hierarchy of needs theory.Maslow (1987, 2000a) proposed a view of human motivation 

as an interaction of conscious and unconscious needs.  Theinteraction occurs within the five 

levels of needs as defined by Maslow (1987, 2000a): physiological, safety, social, esteem, and 

self-actualization.  Maslow offered that environmental, cultural, and situational contexts affect 

motivations.  As the lower-level needs or the physiological, safety, and social needs find 

satisfaction, humans find motivation to satisfy the higher-level needs of esteem and self-

actualization.  Higher-level needs do not find relevancy for motivation until the lower-level 

needs find satisfaction.  Higher-level needs begin to emerge as behavior motivators only after 

individuals satisfy the lower-level needs.   

Maslow (1987, 2000a) suggested a healthy person has satisfied lower-level needs enough 

to focus on esteem and self-actualization needs suggesting that motivating factors of needs 

constantly fluctuate.  Wilson and Madsen (2008) expressed a similar view as Maslow in that an 

individual exhibits a happier and more positive nature as he or she strives to focus on the higher-

level needs.  Maslow (2000b) pointed out that satisfying lower-level needs occurs extrinsically to 

the individual with interaction with the environment, other humans, or a combination of both.  

Individuals satisfy higher-level needs intrinsically through self-assessment, self-acceptance, and 

internal drive, although environmental and human factors may affect higher-level needs 


 

satisfaction. 

23 

Maslow (2000c) advanced the relational notion of the hierarchy of needs theory, job 

satisfaction, and management.  Organizational leadership and employees mayrecognize 

satisfaction at work often occurs when employees receive motivation by taking actions toward 

fulfilling esteem and self-actualization needs.  Leadership influences human behavior, 

motivation, and job satisfaction by manipulating the environment in a manner that allows 

employee motivation to align personal goals with organizational goals.  Maslow (2000c) 

supported a humanistic philosophy of management and preferred McGregor’s (2006) theory Y 

management style that supports individuals in the satisfaction of higher-level needs.  Udechukwu 

(2009) affirmed Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as behavior drivers in the work context and 

contributors to employee job satisfaction.   

Motivation-hygiene theory.Herzberg (1968) offered the two-factor theory of employee 

motivation or as commonly referred to as the motivation-hygiene theory.  Thetheory suggests 

humans seek motivation to satisfy innate needs and desires.  The theory further suggests a 

connection between satisfaction of basic human needs and job satisfaction.  The motivation-

hygiene theory is popular in the business community as a metatheory for employee growth and 

development (Sachau, 2007).   

The motivation-hygiene theory suggests that intrinsic and extrinsic needs influence work 

attitudes with intrinsic needs associated with job satisfaction and extrinsic needs associated with 

job dissatisfaction (Herzberg, 1968).  Intrinsic needs or motivators produce job satisfaction and 

include achievement, growth opportunities,promotion,recognition, responsibility, and work 

identity in the work environment.  Extrinsic needs or hygiene factors produce job dissatisfaction 

and include company policy, policy administration, interpersonal relationships with coworkers 


 

24 

and supervisors, working conditions, salary, fringe benefits, and work environment (Herzberg, 

1968, 1974; Herzberg et al., 1993).  

 Herzberg (1968, 1974) stressed the plausibility of a two-scale view of motivation in the 

workplace, which is contrary to the traditional view of motivation in the workplace.  The 

traditional view puts employee job satisfaction on a single continuum in which satisfaction and 

dissatisfaction are on opposite sides of the scale (Herzberg, 1968, 1974).  Employees rate job 

satisfaction somewhere on thesingle continuum.  With Herzberg’s two-scale view of motivation 

in the workplace, motivators or intrinsic needs contribute to a satisfaction rating and hygiene 

factors or extrinsic needs contribute to a dissatisfaction rating.  Motivators are intrinsic to the job 

serving as job satisfiers by assisting an individual in satisfying esteem and self-actualization 

needs or the higher-level needs of Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) theory.  Hygiene factors are extrinsic 

to the job functioning as job dissatisfiers as these factors do not contribute to an individual 

meeting the physiological, safety, and social needs or the lower-level needs of Maslow’s (1987, 

2000a) theory. 

Herzberg (1968, 1974) and Herzberg et al. (1993) called attention to the value the 

motivation-hygiene theory has for organizational leadership.  The theory shows the influence 

hygiene factors and motivators have on employees’ attitudes about work.  By regulating or 

manipulating the hygiene factors to foster positive employee attitudes toward work, leaders 

allow employees to realize and pursue the necessary motivators for job satisfaction and 

organizational commitment. 

Baldonado and Spangenburg (2009) suggested motivators increase job satisfaction and 

efforts to enrich these motivators are advantageous for organizations with a concern for 

increasing job satisfaction.  Removing or limiting hygiene factors do not guarantee job 


 

25 

satisfaction; it only brings organizational consistency and unity.  Motivators increase job 

satisfaction, suggesting organizations redefine job roles to increase recognition, responsibility, 

achievement, and advancement.  

A limiting reason forthe motivation-hygiene theory is the individual and often dissimilar 

perceptions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators (Herzberg, 1974).  As no two individuals are the 

same, no two perceptions are the same.  Thus, consistent perceptual classification of motivators 

and hygiene factors will not exist among humans.  Herzberg et al. (1993) provided the example 

of employee compensation.  Employee compensation is both a motivator and a hygiene factor 

dependent on the employee’s view of compensation.  Pay viewed as a reward or recognition of 

achievement is a motivator.  Pay viewed as equity with others or fair compensation for effort 

worked is a hygiene factor. 

Goal-setting theory.Goals serve to focus effort and attention for achieving successful 

performance of a task.  Goals guide and motivate an individual to attainment and accomplish an 

action.  The goal-setting theory focuses on the relationship between setting goals and the 

motivation to perform tasks (Locke & Latham, 2002).  Job performance increases establishing 

and achieving conscious, difficult, and specific goals.  Goals serve as reference points for job 

satisfaction or dissatisfaction through intrinsic and extrinsic factors (Latham & Locke, 1979; 

Latham, Winters, & Locke, 1994; Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002, 2004).  Motivation starts with 

intrinsic factors drivingbehavior and extrinsic factors providing rewards for performance (Locke 

& Latham, 2004). 

Goals affect performance in four ways(Locke & Latham, 2002).  Goals channel the 

cognitive and behavioral actions of individuals to complete tasks associated with the goals.  

Goals influence effort levels necessary for goal attainment by individuals.  Goals help to 


 

26 

determine the time needed to complete tasks associated with the goals.  Goals require the use of 

relevant skills and application of knowledge to complete tasks associated with the goals (Locke 

& Latham, 2002).   

Factors affecting goal-directed efforts and performance include difficulty, commitment, 

specificity, and acceptance.  Research highlightsa positive correlation exists between the 

difficulty and effort put into performance of goals (Latham & Locke, 1979; Latham et al., 1994; 

Locke & Latham, 1990, 2004).  As goal difficulty increases, the required performance effort 

increases resulting in individual job satisfaction.  Research also highlightsdifficult tasks in goal 

accomplishment require the use of more cognitive skills and creative solutions resulting in 

satisfying esteem and self-actualization needs (Latham & Locke, 1979; Latham et al., 1994; 

Locke & Latham, 1990, 2004). 

Understanding the goal-setting theory is necessary for organizations and leaders in that 

challenging goals result in increased performance at both individual and organizational levels.  

Locke and Latham (1990) affirmed making work challenging finds benefits in increased 

performance and job satisfaction.  A collaborative effort in establishing goals between leaders 

and employees ensures goal alignment and creates a supportive culture for goal achievement and 

goal accountability in the work environment (Latham & Locke, 1979; Locke & Latham, 1990).  

Leaders should ensure feedback mechanisms are in place to provide employees with methods to 

measure and track performance (Latham & Locke, 1979; Locke & Latham, 1990). 

Expectancy theory.Expectancy theory proposes motivation for work performance and job 

satisfaction results from a relationship existing between tasks and rewards (Lawler & Porter, 

1967; Vroom, 1995).  Vroom (1995) offered the definition of expectancy as “a momentary belief 

concerning the likelihood that a particular act will be followed by a particular outcome” (p. 20).  


 

27 

The expectancy theory predicts an employee finds motivation when effort yields better job 

performance, job performance leads to rewards, and the rewards have value for the employee.  

Human motivation exists from the perceived risk to reach a goal is worth the expected reward for 

reaching the goal (Vroom, 1995).  People behave in certain ways because of the wanted and 

expected outcomes.  

The motivation model created by the expectancy theory has three variables: valence, 

instrumentality, and expectancy.  Valence is the value of the individual goal or the individual’s 

preference or attitude for a particular outcome.  Vroom (1995) referred to valence as the 

satisfaction level an individual expects to realize in achieving a goal or a particular outcome.  

Positive valence signifies an individual prefers attaining the goal or outcome.  Instrumentality is 

the belief an individual holds that performance of a goal or task leads to a desired reward.  

Emery and Oertel (2006) gave credence to instrumentality or the likelihood that accomplishing 

the task results in achieving the goal.  Expectancy is the belief an individual holds the effort 

necessary to accomplish a task or goal is worth the associated reward or outcome (Vroom, 1995).  

Emery and Oertel (2006) viewed expectancy as the probability that task accomplishment will be 

successful.  

As the three variables interact, motivation produces performance and job satisfaction 

(Lawler & Porter, 1967).  Vroom (1995) identified extrinsic rewards affected performance and 

job satisfaction more than intrinsic rewards.  Lawler and Porter (1967) reached a similar 

conclusion that individuals expect increased extrinsic rewards in return for increased 

performance.  However, as an individual acquires a sense of confidence and accomplishment 

through work, intrinsic satisfaction become important, leading to higher levels of job 

satisfaction.  


 

28 

Leadership should seek rewards integral to the organization and its employees.  

Improving job performance and the viability of rewards in meeting employee motivation 

maydictate the rewards offered to employees.  Lawler (1970) pointed out reward expectations 

change over time.  Rewards that provided motivation in the past may lose satisfaction value in 

the future.  Lawler highlighted another problem as the value of work loses satisfaction value as 

employees reach the expected reward level for a job. 

Job characteristics theory.The job characteristics theory holds certain core job elements 

foster job satisfaction.  Assessing the motivational potential of jobs allows job redesign to 

influence positively job satisfaction (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980).  Three critical 

psychological states are necessary before realizing job motivation and satisfaction for 

individuals: meaningfulness of work, job responsibility, and job assessment (Hackman & 

Oldham, 1975, 1980; Hackman, Oldham, Janson, & Purdy, 1975).  Job meaningfulness is the 

perception that work is worthwhile or important to the individual.  Job responsibility occurs 

when an individual retains responsibility for the outcomes of the job.  Job assessment is evident 

when an individual can assess the quality of the outcomes from his or her work.  The presence of 

these three states signifies a job provides performance motivation, improved job satisfaction, and 

positive job experience (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980).   

The job characteristics theory suggests five core job attributesproduce the three 

psychological states.  Skill variety, task identity, and task significanceplay a role in job 

meaningfulness, autonomy plays a role in job responsibility, and feedback plays a role in job 

assessment (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980; Hackman et al., 1975).  Skill variety is the 

opportunity to perform multiple and challenging tasks using various skills and knowledge levels.  

Task identity is an individual’s ability or opportunity to complete all tasks associated with a job.  


 

29 

Task significance is the employee’s perceptual realization that work outcomes have meaning to 

others and the organization.  Autonomy is the degree an employee has freedom or responsibility 

to decide how to accomplish the task or job.  Feedback is the ability of the employee to receive 

direct information about performance and the quality of work performed, and the ability to 

define performance metrics used for outcome measurement.  

Autonomy and feedback are critical job characteristics as both contribute to job 

satisfaction.  Research discoveries have indicated that autonomy and feedback have positive 

correlation with job satisfaction (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980; Hackman et al., 1975).  

Whitt (2006) and Caykoylu et al. (2007) confirmed autonomy or possessing the responsibility to 

advance oneself to task and goal completion increases job satisfaction and improves 

performance.  Mukherjee and Malhotra (2006) and Caykoylu et al. (2007) attested feedback or 

acquiring the necessary information to plan and adjust one’s work plan influences role clarity, 

which in turn influences job satisfaction. 

Lawler and Hackman (1971) suggested organizations should design jobs in such a 

manner to influence job satisfaction and performance of employees.  Typically, organizations 

design jobs based on economic need and organizational effectiveness with little to no regard for 

employee job satisfaction.  Jobs designed with the scientific management theory mentality often 

inhibit employees from gaining intrinsic satisfaction or Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) higher-level 

needs of esteem and self-actualization through work.  Lawler and Hackman (1971) presented a 

strong argument for organizations realizing economic returns for job design based on improving 

job satisfaction.  Cost reduction associated with increased bureaucracy and decreased quality, 

absenteeism, and turnover results from increased performance and productivity of satisfied 

employees.  Job design is effective by assessing employee perceptions of the five core 


 

30 

characteristics of a job, identifying issues impeding job satisfaction and performance, and 

redesigning work to support employees, job satisfaction, and performance (Hackman et al., 1975; 

Hackman & Oldham, 1980; Lawler & Hackman, 1971).  Campion, Mumford, Morgeson, and 

Nahrgang (2005) and Perry, Mesch, and Paarlberg (2006) suggested job design increases 

performance of individuals as the process reduces absenteeism and turnover while increasing job 

satisfaction, organizational commitment, work quality, and productivity. 

Current findings on job satisfaction.Job satisfaction is the emotion an individual 

attaches to a job.  Brown and Lam (2008) suggested the evaluation of ajob or job experiences 

results in an emotional attachment to the job.  Biggs and Swailes (2006) and Staw and Cohen-

Charash (2005) defined job satisfaction as the attitude a person has about a job.  Theaffective 

reaction to a job results from an association of personal needs with the perceived job outcomes.  

The attitudinal variable is reflective of the overall job and the various aspects of the job.  Job 

satisfaction is a person’s feelings about the job (Udechukwu, 2009).  Job satisfaction is the 

affective attitude a person holds toward his or her job. 

Kumar, Bakhshi, and Rani (2009) offered the conceptualization that job satisfaction 

comes from three perspectives: evaluative, cognitive, and affective.  Employees evaluate their 

job from the simple perspective of liking or disliking a job.  Employees develop a cognitive 

perspective based on an individual’s perceptions, opinions, beliefs, values, and expectations of 

an organization.  Organizations evoke association feelings influencing employees’ affective 

perspective of job satisfaction.   

Brown and Lam (2008) agreed with previous research that two general approaches exist 

for understanding job satisfaction.  The global approach views job satisfaction as a single 

belieftoward the job resulting in anevaluation of the overall job.  The facet approach assesses job 


 

31 

satisfaction on the different aspects of a job eliciting perceptional and affective reactions.   

Bowling, Hendricks, and Wagner (2008) and Fichter and Cipolla (2010) suggested five 

job facets of job satisfaction: work itself, compensation, promotional opportunity, coworker 

interaction, and supervision.  Employees evaluate the work itself by assessing opportunities for 

autonomy,creativity, job enrichment, job complexity, knowledge acquisition, responsibility, and 

task variety.  Employees evaluate actual compensation versus expected compensation, looking 

for congruency of the two factors.  Employees evaluate promotional opportunities from the 

fairness in policies and administration of promotions within an organization.  Employees seek 

positive relationships with coworkers enhancing individual and group interactions.  Employees 

evaluate supervision using the criteria of employee consideration, employee inclusiveness, and 

relationship behaviors (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).  

Whitt (2006) concluded increasing job satisfaction reveals increased results in 

performance on both individual and organizational levels.  The organization realizes a cascading 

effect with increased employee retention, staff experience, and organizational performance.  

Agreeing with Whitt’s study, Politis’ (2006) and Karadal, Ay, and Cuhadar’s (2008) research 

studies identified positive correlation between job satisfaction and team performance.    

Biggs and Swailes (2006) reported positive correlation exists between job satisfaction 

and organizational commitment.  A satisfied employee developsorganizational commitment, 

resulting in longevity with an employer.  Biggs and Swailes defined organization commitment 

“as a multidimensional work attitude that concerns the bond between the employee and the 

employing organization” (p. 131).  The bond results as employees believe and accept 

organizational goals, exerciseextra effort for the organization, and increase identification with 

the organization.  Focusing on worker relations within organizations and work groups positively 


 

32 

influences organization commitment and job satisfaction (Daly & Dee, 2006; Muse & Stamper, 

2007).  High organizational commitment and high job satisfaction provide for increased 

organizational citizenship. 

  Brown and Lam (2008) reported a linkage between job satisfaction, customer 

satisfaction, and service quality.  Satisfied, motivated, and committed front-line employees 

provide the essential impetus in delivering quality service and ensuring customer satisfaction.  

Brown and Lam concluded such a workforce is integral in cultivating a devoted and essential 

customer base.  Theconclusion supports the need for managers to find ways to foster job 

satisfaction to promote and increase customer satisfaction and service quality. 

Heller, Watson, and Ilies (2006) and Pasupuleti, Allen, Lambert, and Cluse-Tolar (2009) 

suggested job satisfaction has significant effect on life satisfaction.  Life satisfaction suffers 

when work takes on a negative connotation or experience.  Job satisfaction has obvious 

consequences on employees and directly affects employee well-being on three interconnected 

levels: (1) subjective well-being, (2) workplace well-being, and (3) psychological well-being 

(Page & Vella-Brodrick, 2009).  The subjective well-being of employees concerns life 

satisfaction developing dispositional affectivity on individuals (Bowling, Hendricks, & Wagner, 

2008; Page & Vella-Brodrick, 2009).  Positive affectivity is the extent a person is enthusiastic, 

alert, and active.  Negative affectivity finds realization in individual distress and unpleasant 

engagement (Bowling et al., 2008).  Both positive and negative affectivity find realization and 

ramification in an individual’s life and work dimensions of individuals.  Workplace well-being 

of employees is the level of job satisfaction and directly realized in the work-related environment 

with linkage to life satisfaction (Karatepe, 2006; Page & Vella-Brodrick, 2009; Pasupuleti, 

Allen, Lambert, & Cluse-Tolar, 2009).  Page and Vella-Brodrick (2009) suggested “[s]elf 


 

33 

acceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental 

mastery, and autonomy” (p. 443) contribute to psychological well-being in individual life and 

work dimensions.  Employee well-being is a dynamic to consider in understanding 

organizational well-being with direct linkage to performance and employee turnover (Page & 

Vella-Brodrick, 2009). 

Ghazzawi and Smith (2009) suggested religious faith influences job satisfaction and 

organizational commitment.  Ghazzawi and Smith offered three propositions surrounding 

theinfluence.  Job satisfaction has a positive correlation to religious faith, revealing an individual 

with a stronger religious faith base is more likely to have higher job satisfaction.  Higher job 

satisfaction exists when the individual has a faith that traditionally views work as a religious 

duty.  Job satisfaction contributes positively to job commitment.  However, a strong religious 

faith may serve as a stronger indicator of job commitment than job satisfaction.  Religious faith 

often suggests individual commitment is more prudent and integral to faith loyalty than the 

satisfaction an individual receives from service. 

Summary of human motivation theories and job satisfaction.Job satisfaction is a 

result of individuals’ conscious and unconscious reactions to stimuli in the workplace.  The 

reactions occur on various levels including physical, psychological, social, and cognitive.  The 

contentment of human needs, the impetus of motivators, realizing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, 

and fulfilling core job elements contribute to employees’ job satisfaction in organizations.   

The works of Maslow (1987, 2000a) and Herzberg (1968, 1974) suggested theories of 

motivation based on satisfying needs.  Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) hierarchy of needs theory viewed 

human motivation as an interaction of needs seeking fulfillment in an individual’s life.  

Employees realize job satisfaction by meeting the upper-level needs of esteem and self-


 

34 

actualization within the work environment.  Herzberg’s (1968, 1974) two-factor theory 

suggested intrinsic motivators act as job satisfiers helping an individual in satisfying esteem and 

self-actualization needs.   

The work of Locke and Latham (2002, 2004), Vroom (1995), and Lawler and Porter 

(1967) suggested process theories of motivation.  Locke and Latham’s (2002, 2004) goal theory 

suggested job satisfaction results from a process of motivation starting with intrinsic factors that 

drive action and ending with extrinsic factors that act as rewards for performance.  Vroom (1995) 

and Lawler and Porter (1967) with their work on the expectancy theory offered job satisfaction 

results as an employee finds motivation when the effort needed yields better job performance, 

job performance leads to rewards, and the rewards have value for the employee. 

Hackman and Oldham’s (1975, 1980) job characteristics theory inferred correct job 

design is integral to employee job satisfaction.  By taking a cognizant and inclusive look at the 

core characteristics of jobs, organizations can meet the critical psychological states necessary for 

job motivation and job satisfaction of employees.  Fulfilling these states provides performance 

motivation, improved job satisfaction, and positive job experience (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 

1980). 

Leadership 

Leadership transforms an organization into a healthy and high-performance entity.  

Transformational leadership commits people into action bymotivating followers into assuming 

leadership roles and challenging leaders to becomechange agents.  Leaders preserve and heighten 

self-esteem at all levels of the organization.  Leaders listen and respond with empathy to 

followers.  Leaders ask for and encourage involvement of followers.  Leaders share thoughts, 

feelings, and rationale to align followers’ goals with organizational goals.  Leaders provide 


 

35 

support without removing responsibility (Novicevic, Harvey, Buckley, Brown, & Evans, 2006; 

Rosen, 1996).   

Numerous definitions for leadership exist among researchers and authors.  Most would 

agree leadership is contingent on the four components of process, influence, group context, and 

goal attainment (Northouse, 2007; Yukl, 2006).  Exemplary leadership is paramount in 

organizations today as a means to attain and promote the quality and health of organizations and 

employees (Bennis, 2007). 

Historical overview on leadership.Theories of leadership evolve as researchers strive to 

understand the influence leaders have on organizations and employees in efforts to accomplish 

organizational goals.  As long as organizations have the need to accomplish goals, leaders will 

find opportunities to accomplish the goals.  De Moville (2007) commented leadership is 

instrumental for organizational success in the present and future.  The idea creates the need to 

understand and develop leadership capable of pushing the organization and its employees to the 

fullest potential (Grant & Wrzesniewski, 2010).  

Burns (1978) viewed the leader-follower relationship as the foundational aspect of 

leadership.  The relationship serves as the basis for theories of transformational leadership that 

suggests and supports the collectivity of leaders and followers as integral to organizational 

success.  McGregor’s (2006) theory X and theory Y provide an initial look at leadership by 

identifying two approaches with theory X exhibiting directive and authoritarian management 

traits and theory Y exhibiting participative management traits.  McGregor’s theory Y provided 

the impetus into Burns’ (1978) theories of transactional and transformational leadership.  Burns 

considered transactional leadership as a reciprocal interaction and viewed transformational 

leadership as an engaging relationship, both existing between leaders and followers.  Expanding 


 

36 

on Burns’ (1978) research, Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993, 2004) developed the model of full 

range leadership by identifying the three behavior styles of transformational, transactional, and 

passive leadership. 

Current findings on transformational leadership theories.Transformational leadership 

concerns an engagement between leaders and followers toward completing common goals with 

mutual benefits.  Northouse (2007) claimed, “transformational leadership . . . raises the level of 

motivation and morality in both the leader and the follower  . . . attentive to the needs and 

motives of followers and tries to help followers reach their fullest potential” (p. 176).  Thereview 

of transformational leadership theories provides a survey of the germinal theories and a review of 

current literature relevant to the theories of transformational leadership. 

Theory X and theory Y.McGregor (2006) viewed the function of managers as an 

interactive and reciprocal relationship of influence and control with employees.  McGregor 

maintained two fundamental approaches exist for influencing and controlling employees: theory 

X and theory Y.  The two approaches exist on different spectrums based on employee 

centeredness.  Historically, leadership methods are authoritarian and directive as suggested by 

Taylor’s scientific management theory and closely adhere to McGregor’s theory X.  Taylor’s 

theory espoused the use of directive methods of management with an emphasis on command and 

control as the way to accomplish organizational work.  McGregor expressed the idea of a 

manager possessing the ability to influence employees’ attitudes toward work and to satisfy 

human needs to carry out work through others.  Burtis and Turman (2010) suggested theory X 

and theory Y represent stylistic choices managers use to accomplish organizational goals and 

work.  

McGregor (2006) described theory X as an approach to manage employees from an 


 

37 

authoritarian perspective.  The only way to accomplish work is with command and control 

tactics.  Managers using theory X assume employees dislike work and the use of coercion, 

direction, and threats of punishment ensures work accomplishment.  McGregor suggested 

employees work for organizations only to satisfy lower-level needs as prescribed by Maslow’s 

(1987, 2000a) hierarchy of needs.  Kopelman, Prottas, and Davis (2008) offered theory X holds 

the additional assumptions that employees exhibit a propensity to laziness and an inability for 

self-direction, self-control, and decision-making.  Burtis and Turman (2010) attributed a top-

down approach to theory X, in which direction, control, and communication are such to keep 

employees focused on task and production with a de-emphasis on employee contribution and 

input.  McGregor offered, “the central principle of organization which derives from Theory X is 

that of direction and control through the exercise of authority” (p. 67).    

McGregor (2006) suggested theory Y approaches managing employees from a 

participative management style.  Theapproach fosters a relationship between leaders and 

employees and suggests motivating employees to satisfy esteem and self-actualization needs 

through work will result in organizational benefits.  Theory Y suggests individuals view work as 

an opportunity to find meaning in their lives and to permit the satisfaction of all levels of needs 

in Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) hierarchy of needs.  Contrary to theory X’s assumptions, Kopelman 

et al. (2008) offered theory Y has foundational assumptions that employees do not exhibit a 

propensity to laziness and do exhibit self-direction, self-control, and decision-making for the 

benefit of the organization.  Burtis and Turman (2010) attributed a distributive approach to 

theory Y, in which sharing direction, control, and communication occurs among leaders and 

employees emphasizing the enhanced benefits brought to the organization. 

McGregor (2006) viewed theory Y managers as facilitators working within organizations 


 

38 

to accomplish mutual individual and organizational performance.  As facilitators, theory Y 

managers strive to align employee goals with the goals of the organization, ensure proper 

resources are available to employees to complete the work, and assign responsibility for deciding 

the method for performing and completing tasks.  McGregor’s suggestion that leaders within 

organizations consider employee motivation and job satisfaction as antecedents to organizational 

success moved leadership theory into looking at the leader-follower relationship influence on 

employee motivation.  Theory Y leadership serves as a predecessor to the transactional and 

transformational leadership theories as espoused by Burns (1978).       

Transformational and transactional leadership.Burns (1978) viewed the leader-follower 

relationship as the foundational idea of leadership.  Burns viewed therelationship as a morally 

and mutually uplifting process, not as a control method resulting in the leader exhibiting an elitist 

view of power and importance over followers.  The leadership process is an interdependent 

relationship mediated by the values and needs of the leader and follower inclusively.  Burns 

explained leadership as “leaders inducing followers to act for certain goals that represent the 

values and the motivations—the wants and needs, the aspirations, and expectations—of both the 

leaders and followers” (p. 19).  From his research, Burns identified transactional leadership and 

transformational leadership as two distinctive leadership styles. 

Transactional leadership concerns atransactionalexchange.  An exchange occurs with 

something valued by the follower for something valued by the leader.  In the typical work 

setting, a follower exchanges his or her performance of tasks for the leader paying a wage for 

time worked or widgets produced.  Burns (1978) suggested transactional leadership focuses on 

managing work and followers, accomplishing work through employees with little regard for the 

employee other than satisfying lower-level needs as suggested by Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) 


 

39 

hierarchy of needs.  Key ideas of transactional leadership are the awareness of the link between 

effort and reward, the responsiveness and orientation to present issues, the use of inducement, 

reward, punishment, and sanction for control, the motivation of goal setting and rewarding of 

performance, and the use of power to subject followers to task completion (Burns, 1978).  

Transformational leadership concerns an engagement between leaders and followers 

toward completing common goals with mutual benefits.  Burns (1978) expressed the view that 

transformational leadership results in mutual motivation between leaders and followers to 

achieve high levels of success in the pursuit of collective goals.  The goals of the organization as 

espoused by the leader become the goals of the followers.  Burns proposed transformational 

leaders attempt to move followers to higher standards of moral responsibility and keener 

awareness of his or her needs, values, and purposes.  Theawareness leads to integrating 

individual needs, values and purposes with the needs, values, and purposes of the leader and the 

organization.  Key aspects of transformational leadership arethe exchange and motivating 

relationship of leaders and followers, the proactive and inclusive view toward organizational 

issues, the development of learning opportunities, and the encouragement of emotional bonds 

uniting leaders and followers (Burns, 1978). 

Burns (1978) concluded leaders and followers develop relationships leading to the 

satisfying intrinsic motivators for both the leaders and followers.  Transformational leaders 

support and foster work environments in which transformational change occurs for both 

organizations and people (Kerber & Buono, 2005).  Burns proposed that in such environments 

followers develop into leaders who embrace theclimate of working together and change for the 

good it brings individually and organizationally. 

Burns’ (1978) theory of leadership suggested the two methods of organizational 


 

40 

leadership: transactional leadership concerned with managing the work and transformational 

leadership leading followers to action.  These two methods represent two distinct styles in 

motivating employees to accomplish work.  Burns’ theory of leadership provided the basis for 

the work of Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993) in their development of the model of full range 

leadership (FRL).      

The model of full range leadership.Expanding on the research of Burns’ (1978) theories 

of transactional and transformational leadership, Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993) advanced the 

notion of leaders using a combination of behaviors with followers dependent on the tasks, work 

environment, and employees’ needs.  In so doing, Bass and Avolio developed the model of full 

range leadership (FRL) that identifies the specific behaviors of transformational, transactional, 

and passive leadership to motivate employees.  The FRL model consists of three leadership 

behavior styles: transformational, transactional, and passive (Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993).  

Kirkbride (2006) stated FRL is the most researched and validated model of leadership.  Prior 

research of transformational and transactional leadership supports the use of the FRL model and 

employee motivation and the high validity of all four aspects of transformational leadership and 

contingent reward (Judge & Piccolo, 2004). 

Transformational leadership.According to Burns (1978) and Bass (1985), 

transformational leadership is the key to organization success.  Transformational leadership 

extends beyond traits, behavior, and characteristics as identified in many leadership theories.  

Theleadership behavior is about inspiration, intellect, charisma, and consideration (Konorti, 

2008).  Transformational leadership influences, inspires, and intellectually stimulates people to 

mature as leaders through achieving of visionary goals, occurring both collectively and 

individually.  The transformational leadership behavior style has four distinct aspects: (a) 


 

41 

individual consideration, (b) intellectual stimulation, (c) inspirational motivation, and (d) 

idealized influence (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 

2006). 

Individual consideration is reminiscentof the compassionate leader who considers 

follower needs individually while adapting leadership style to meet follower individuality.  

Leaders provide opportunities of coaching and mentoring to followers, guiding the followers in 

developmental growth (Avolio, 1999; Bass & Avolio, 1990).  Individual consideration 

concentrates on motivating followers by providing autonomy to develop ideas and plans for 

implementation.  Theaspect focuses on developing strong relationships with followers, built on 

trust to work collectively toward individual and collective goals (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass 

& Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006; Barbuto, Fritz, Matkin, & Marx, 2007).  

Employees within organizations need intellectual stimulation to challenge existing 

thinking to find new solutions for task accomplishment.  The leader using intellectual stimulation 

consistently challenges followers to think critically in the search of solutions and alternatives to 

current ways of doing tasks through objective and logical decision-making.  Leaders 

mayencourage creativity and learning through the process of work (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; 

Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006).  Barbuto, Fritz, Matkin, and Marx (2007) 

called for leaders to encourage new thinking patterns, stepping outside the typical lines of 

organizational thinking and problem solving.   

Transformational leaders inspire followers to see their efforts and work within the 

organizational structure as part of the larger picture or vision.  Becoming akin to thelarger picture 

or vision affords opportunities for goal accomplishment not thought possible from the individual 

perspective (Avolio, 1999; Bass & Avolio, 1990).  Leaders of inspirational motivation appeal to 


 

42 

followers’ values and beliefs by providing necessary inspiration when motivation fades.  

Inspirational motivation use effective communication of visions, objectives, and strategies on a 

consistent and continual basis (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & 

Riggio, 2006). 

As a leader becomes the symbol of vision for followers, he or she becomes the leader 

with idealized influence (Barbuto et al., 2007).  Idealized influence occurs when leaders can see 

and communicate organizational strategies transformational for the organizations and followers.  

The leader serves as a mediator in support of shared visions and aligned goals between the 

employee and organization (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & 

Riggio, 2006).   

Transactional leadership. Accordingto Avolio (1999), Bass (2008), Bass and Avolio 

(1990, 1993), and Bass and Riggio (2006)), transactional leaders solicitan exchange oftask 

completion for something of value with employees.  Leaders accomplish the exchangeby using 

one of three approaches: (a) contingent reward, (b) management by exception-active (MBE-A), 

and (c) management by exception-passive (MBE-P) (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 

1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006).  Avolio (1999) viewed contingent reward as a practical 

method of motivation as the employees determine the method for task accomplishment and 

progress measurement in return for open recognition of goal accomplishment.  The leader and 

follower agree on the task or goal needing completed or achieved and the reward for 

accomplishing the task or goal.  Contingent reward can be an effective leadership style except 

the leader will receive only the agreed-upon results or efforts with assigning the task or goal. 

Bass, Avolio, Jung, and Berson (2003), Goodwin, Wofford, and Whittington (2001), 

Judge and Piccolo (2004), and Prabhakar (2005) considered contingent reward as both 


 

43 

transactional and transformational leadership behaviors and a means of worker motivation.  

Goodwin et al. (2001) offered contingency reward results in a contract on expected work and 

rewards in a binding agreement between the employee, leader, and organization.  Thecontractual 

agreement suggests a participative interaction between leader and follower, often associated with 

transformational leadership. 

Management by exception is essentially managing people with the use of corrective 

actions and does not motivate employees into action, as suggested by Avolio (1999), Bass, 2008, 

Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993), and Bass and Riggio (2006).  A leader using the management by 

exception-active (MBE-A) style takes an active and selfish interest in assignment and monitoring 

of tasks.  The leader involves himself or herself constantly in the work process looking for 

deviations from standard protocol, intervening prior to employees making errors.  Management 

by exception-passive (MBE-P) is similar to MBE-A except a leader takes a passive view of the 

work process intervening only after employees’ work is inaccurate or substandard.  Research has 

shown both MBE approaches are less effective than contingency reward and transformational 

leadership (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006).   

Passive leadership.Research highlights that passive leadership is ineffective in both the 

interaction with and motivation of employees (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 

1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006; Bennett, 2009).  Laissez-faire and passive avoidant leadership is 

common terms used for theleadership behavior style (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Avolio, Bass, & 

Jung, 1999).  Avolio (1999), Bass, 2008, Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993), and Bass and Riggio 

(2006) expressed the view passive leadership exhibits minimal to no impact in motivating 

employees.  Theleadership styles involvelittle interaction between leaders and followers, realized 

in the avoidance or absence of leadership.  Barbuto (2005) suggested passive leaders disregard 


 

44 

supervisory and managerial responsibilities, including a lack of employee attention and guidance 

and inattentivenessto productivity, task completion, and goal achievement. 

Influence of transformational leadership.Transformational leadership brings adaptation 

skills to organizational situations and cultures and develops followership relationships that 

achieve visionary goals in furthering organizational success.  Bass and Avolio (1990, 1993) 

advanced the notion of transformational leaders changing organizational culture in attempts to 

achieve optimal organizational performance.  Thechange process begins with an assessment of 

current norms and values existing within the organization and creating a new and future state or 

vision for the organization.  With the new vision in mind, the leader develops change strategies 

that will transform the organization and its culture to support thevision.  A fundamental next step 

in the change effort is aligning employees with the vision through consistent and engaging 

communication.  Finally, employees become empowered to manage and implement change 

through employee-fostered strategies. 

Avolio (2007) and George, Sims, McLean, and Mayer (2007) suggested leaders deliver 

on results while creating a virtuous circle of effectiveness exuding in both leadership and 

followership abilities.  Fostering followership is vital to organizational success and leadership 

success (Abramson, 2007; Bjugstad, Thach, Thompson, & Morris, 2006).  Employees have an 

innate desire to be of service to others and to realize the success of followership (Dittmar, 2006).  

Gentry and Leslie (2007) provided 10 core competencies leaders should exhibit to ensure 

followership: (a) leading not directing, (b) focus on relationships, (c) risk taker, (d) change 

manager, (e) influencer, (f) communicator of information and ideas, (g) bring out people’s best, 

(h) action-orientation with follow-through, (i) excellent listener and hearer of people, and (j) 

openness and flexibility.  


 

45 

Piccolo and Colquitt (2006) suggested leaders define and shape followers’ reality of work 

in their concept of management of meaning.  Through the transformational process, leaders 

determine the vision, share the vision, and support the vision by providing constructive feedback, 

inspiration for extra effort in work performance, and encouragement to solve complex problems 

creatively—happening in a manner that progresses employee motivation, job satisfaction, and 

organizational commitment (Ashill, Rod, Thirkell, & Garruthers, 2009; George, Sims, McLean, 

& Mayer, 2007).  Leaders influence followers with effective communication of the meaning of 

work by enhancing the five core job characteristics of variety, identity, significance, autonomy, 

and feedback(Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980).  Theenhancement, job assignments, and 

relationship interaction challenges followers to find alliance and allegiance with the leader and 

the organization. 

Relationships develop between the individuals within organizations conducive to work 

completion in a manner benefiting all, as the relationship existing between leaders and 

employees.  The leader-member exchange theory proposes a two-way relationship exists 

between leaders and employees, and individual and organizational success increases when 

positive relationships exist between leaders and employees (Breland, Treadway, Duke, & 

Adams, 2007; Fix & Sias, 2006; Stringer, 2006).  Lee (2005, 2008) suggested transformational 

leadership has a positive relationship with leader-member exchange.  Transformational 

leadership senses the need for positive relationships with and among followers for organizational 

success in achieving goals and objectives.  Stringer (2006) emphasized high quality relationships 

find benefits in mutual trust, supportive work environment, effective communication, mutual 

consideration, and higher employee esteem.  Lee further suggested a relationship exists between 

transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, organizational commitment, and 


 

innovativeness.   

46 

Li and Hung (2009) gave credence to the positive effects of transformational leadership 

on leader-member exchange by identifying individual consideration and inspirational motivation 

as affecting coworker relationships positively.  Building on the relational aspect of 

transformational leadership, Stashevsky and Koslowsky (2006) found a high level of team 

cohesion exists in work groups with leaders exhibiting transformational characteristics.  As 

relationships between and among leaders and followers develop, team cohesion builds to support 

group and organizational success.   

Bass (2008) and Limsila and Ogunlana (2008) identified outcomes in organizations used 

to measure success include employee satisfaction, effort or motivation, effectiveness, and 

performance.  Research highlightsa relationship exists between each of four outcomes and 

transformational leadership.  Walumbwa, Lawler et al. (2005), Walumbwa, Orwa et al. (2005), 

and Bennett (2009) identified transformational leadership as exhibiting a positive relationship on 

employee job satisfaction.  Spinelli (2006), Pounder (2008), and Bennett (2009) suggested extra 

effort and motivation result from transformational leaders interacting with followers.  Spinelli 

(2006), Bennett (2009), and Burpitt (2009) suggested a positive effect of transformational 

leadership in organizations is in the areas of leadership, management, and innovativeness.  

Boerner, Eisenbeiss, and Griesser (2007) and Limsila and Ogunlana (2008) gave credence to the 

positive association of transformational leadership with performance over transactional 

leadership.    

Toor and Ofori (2009) determined a positive and significant association between ethical 

leadership and transformational leadership.  Ethical leadership emphasizes an “internalized 

moral perspective, the moral person, the moral manager, and idealized influence” (Toor & Ofori, 


 

47 

2009, p. 536).  Ethics and morality are qualities of positive leadership and integral to 

transformational leadership (Toor & Ofori, 2009).  Burns (1978) and Walumbwa, Avolio, and 

Zhu (2008) offered the belief that transformational leadership is moral leadership, raising the 

ethical ambitions of leaders and followers.  Neubert, Carlson, Kacmar, Roberts, and Chonko 

(2009) cited the need for leaders to display ethical behavior and provide ethical communication 

as integral to employee followership.  Neubert et al. (2009) suggested “[w]hen managers behave 

in a fair, honest, trustworthy and considerate manner, these virtuous behaviors seem to create a 

virtuous cycle . . . perpetuat[ing] an ethical work climate that allows subordinates to flourish” (p, 

165).  Thebehavior is evident in the responsibility a leader assumes in the social and ethical 

relationships existing with all stakeholders of an organization (Maak & Pless, 2006).  

Job Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment, and Retention 

Organizational commitment and employee retention are benefits organizations receive 

when employees find satisfaction in his or her employment.  Organizational commitment is the 

identification an employee possesses with an organization resulting in high involvement in work 

and activities furthering organizational performance (Avolio et al., 2004).  Biggs and Swailes 

(2006) suggested organization commitment is a multi-dimensional work attitude realized in a 

bond between the employee and the organization.  Theattitude is evident as employees believe 

and accept organizationalgoals, put forthextra effort for the organization, and exhibit an 

increased identification with the organization.  Bar-Haim (2007) offered organizational 

commitment as a behavior of choice based on the perception of organizational power and 

employment alternatives.  Turker (2009) defined organizational commitment as the relational 

identification with an organization that promptsan employee’s decision to stay with the 

organization.  Solinger, Van Olffen, and Roe (2008) viewed organizational commitment as the 


 

48 

attitude an employee has for an organization influencing his or her desire to leave or stay. 

Employee retention is a significant issue many organizations face in daily operations and 

of critical importance to organizational success (McCulloch & Turban, 2007).  McKeown (2009) 

cited a recent survey revealing50% of workers in the United States think his or her job is 

stagnant and of these workers, 50% of the workers plan to seek other avenues of employment to 

find fulfillment and satisfaction.  The inverse of employee retention or turnover finds realization 

in the loss of employees in organizations with a multiplicity of issues.  Employees leaving 

organizations take knowledge and experience often not existing elsewhere in the organization.  

Bibby (2008) and Siong, Mellor, Moore, and Firth (2006) offered the consequences of turnover 

include lack of employee continuity, lack of organizational stability, high cost of recruitment, 

and degradation of organizational performance.  Borton (2007) and Udechukwu (2009) pointed 

out that turnover results in costs to organizations associated with the separation, training, and 

acquisition of employees.  

Samad (2006) identified the turnover predictors as the degree of organizational 

commitment and the satisfaction of motivators and hygiene factors within the work environment.  

Affective, continuance, and normative organizational commitment negatively and significantly 

predict turnover intention.  The degree of satisfaction with motivators (responsibility, work, 

achievement, recognition, and advancement) negatively and significantly predicts turnover 

intention.  The degree of gratification with hygiene factors (status, working conditions, and 

salary) negatively and significantly predicts turnover intention.  Benson (2006) claimed a 

negative relationship between training and turnover intention.  Employees exhibit the intention to 

leave an organization when training is inadequate for a job.  Employees with a perception of 

underemployment will have higher intentions to turnover (Maynard et al., 2006). 


 

49 

Research highlightsrelationships exist between job satisfaction, organizational 

commitment, retention, and leadership.  Cetin (2006) suggested organizations create cultures of 

commitment based on the positive correlation of job satisfaction and organizational commitment.  

Walumbwa et al. (2004) found transformational leadership has a positive relationship with job 

satisfaction and organizational commitment, whereas a negative relationship exists between 

transformation leadership and turnover.  Choi (2006) noted that the charismatic leader behavior, 

often associated with transformational leadership, promotes job satisfaction of employees within 

organizations.  Chen and Silverthorne (2005), Fix and Sias (2006), and Siong et al. (2006) 

revealed that leadership, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment influence employees’ 

willingness to retain employment with an organization.   

In a research study conducted by Caykoylu et al. (2007), job satisfaction and leadership 

effectiveness correlated with organizational commitment.  McCulloch and Turban (2007) and 

Yeh (2007) showed a significant and positive relationship between employee retention and job 

satisfaction.  Falkenburg and Schyns (2007) and Jegadeesan (2007) found job satisfaction and 

organizational commitment have moderating effects on employee withdrawal behaviors that 

includes employee absenteeism and turnover.  In a study conducted by Hwang and Kuo (2006), 

the sole reason for turnover was not job satisfaction, but was the interaction of job satisfaction 

with present employment and the perception of alternative employment opportunities.  

Within the business and academic communities, a strong consensus exists that employees 

are the most important resource of an organization (Ojha & Kasturi, 2005; Timmerman, 2009).  

Organizations often misunderstand the need to engage employees in work and realize their full 

potential to the detriment of the organization (Siong, De Grip, Longen, & Sorensen, 2006).  

Transformational leaders understand thepotential and strive to engagefollowers into leadership 


 

50 

roles in the gratification of individual and organizational goals and development.  

Transformational leaders understand the need for satisfied, committed, and tenured employees to 

achieve organizational goals, performance, and sustainability (Nguni, Sleegers, & Denessen, 

2006). 

The Call Center Environment 

For many organizations today, call centers provide the single point of contact with their 

customers (Ellis & Taylor, 2006).  Thecontact is often with processing of inbound and outbound 

customer contacts to handle needs for interaction with the organization (Abbott, 2004; Reynolds 

et al., 2003).  Customers have an expectation for 24-hour accessibility to service-based 

organizations (Batt et al., 2009; Holdsworth & Cartwright, 2003).   

Managing the customer experience that includes customer satisfaction and customer 

retention is important to organizations.  Kantsperger and Kunz (2005) suggested employee job 

satisfaction is a major cause driving and achieving customer satisfaction.  Management is 

fundamental to employee job satisfaction, aiding the organization to achieve customer 

satisfaction (Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 2006).  Call center representatives have 

direct contact with an organization’s customers and act as ambassadors for the organization 

(Ojha & Kasturi, 2005).   

Integral to call center success is maintaining a customer focused strategy (Batt et al., 

2009; Crotts, Dickson, & Ford, 2005).  Such a strategy mayweave throughout all aspects of the 

call center organization to ensure viability for customer interactions.  Confusion occurs over the 

strategic intent of call centers—goals versus responsibility (Robinson & Morley, 2006).  A call 

center’s goal is to reduce costs in delivering customer service for the organization.  The 

responsibility of a call center is providing excellent customer service thatmeets the needs of an 


 

51 

organization (Kim & Park, 2010).  A disconnect occurs between reducing organizational costs 

and providing excellent customer service.  Excellent customer service often comes with an 

increase in costs.       

In call centers, the focus is on multiple employees responding to customer needs.  The 

centers handle the customer interactions for an organization and are the first and central point of 

interaction (Gorjup et al., 2008).  Call centers have an organizational role to handle customer-

initiated interactions including customer contacts received by telephone, standard mail, fax, e-

mail, chat, and with outbound calling for collection and customer notification purposes 

(Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Gorjup et al., 2008; Minami, 2009).  Call center leadership manage 

and coordinate three integral resources for efficient operations: employees, computers, and 

telecommunication equipment (Ojha & Kasturi, 2005; Ramseook-Munhurrun et al., 2010).    

Wegge, Van Dick, Fisher, Wecking, and Moltzen (2006) suggested “[t]he main task of 

call center [representatives] is to communicate with customers via integrated telephone and 

computer solutions” (p. 61).  Uncomplicated and non-demanding work is often the perception of 

the work of call centers, alluding to customer interactions as basic, simple, and scripted.  Such a 

perception is slowly fading as call centers are handling more complex interactions as customers 

demand more from organizations through the desired communication channel solutions (Halliden 

& Monks, 2005; Wegge et al., 2006).  The change requires training call center representatives in 

areas of specialization, creating additional challenges for call routing based on skill and customer 

requirements (Avramidis, Chan, Gendreau, L’Ecuyer, & Pisacane, 2010; Wallace & Whitt, 

2005).  

The call center representative’s position attracts unskilled people who perform routine 

tasks and receive poor pay for their work efforts (Rose & Wright, 2005).  Call center 


 

52 

representatives must exhibit flexibility in work scheduling because of customer call patterns 

(Avramidis et al., 2010; Cartwright, 2003).  Froehle (2006), Ojha and Kasturi (2005), Sieben, De 

Grip, Longen, and Sorensen (2009) suggested call center representatives must exhibit the 

characteristics of thoroughness, knowledgeableness, preparedness, courtesy, professionalism, 

and attentiveness in their interactions with customers, thus, ensuring customer satisfaction with 

the interaction with the organization.   

Call center representatives further experience high levels of performance scrutiny and 

monitoring because of advancements in technology (Barnes, 2007; Mahesh & Kasturi, 2006; 

Siong et al., 2006; Sprigg & Jackson, 2006).  Technology creates the means for frequent and 

objective measurement of employee performance and an environment intrusive and controlling 

of employee work and actions (Cartwright, 2003; Barnes, 2007; Reynolds et al., 2003).  Varca 

(2006) offered call center representatives experience a loss of perceived control because of the 

surveillance afforded by the technology used in call centers.  Holman, Frenkel, Sorensen, and 

Wood (2009) affirmed a positive relationship exists between performance monitoring and 

employee turnover in call centers. 

Call center organizations have a dual role of responsibility to customers and employees 

(Parmelee, 2001).  Call centers have a responsibility to meet the needs and ensure external and 

internal customer satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction creates customer loyalty and competitive 

advantage within an industry (Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Lywood, Stone, & Ekinci, 2009; Whitt, 

2006).  Call center leaders have a responsibility to influence satisfaction of call center 

employees.  Employee satisfaction is obvious in employee exhibition of organizational 

commitment, citizenship, and performance (Biggs & Swailes, 2006; Whitt, 2006).  

Theresponsiveness remains with organizational leadership to meet and exceed expected levels of 


 

53 

customer and employee satisfaction (Bos et al., 2009; Cartwright, 2003).  Malhotra and 

Mukherjee (2004) stated, “[s]atisfied and committed employees make for satisfied and 

committed customers” (p. 165).   

Although the need for employee job satisfaction is evident from research, Holdsworth 

and Cartwright (2003) suggested job satisfaction of call center representatives is low when 

compared to other populations of workers.  Factors contributing to low job satisfaction include 

the lack of personal growth and development, low decision-makingparticipation, low job 

flexibility, and supervision appropriateness (Holdsworth & Cartwright, 2003).  Visser and 

Rothmann (2009) concluded such contributing factors lead to emotional exhaustion, which in 

turn, leads to employee burnout and subsequent turnover.  The call center environment lacks two 

contributors of job satisfaction: self-determination and empowerment (Gorjup et al., 2008; 

Holdsworth & Cartwright, 2003). 

Harney and Jordan (2008) discussed two overarching principles concerning the work 

environment of call centers: focus on quantity and high employee turnover.  Customer calls drive 

call center performance with little ability to predict exact call patterns and the quantity of calls.  

Historical data provide a surfeitof call information about quantity, queue times, and handle times, 

serving as the basis for predictive modeling.  The modeling allows call centers to staff at levels 

consistent with the historical call volumes, permitting effective cost control for the organization.  

The focus is on answering many calls with few employees, often leading to a dilemma of 

quantity versus quality.  Brannan (2005) identified a common tension existing in the nature of 

call centers—speed and accuracy.  The tension forces call center management to look for 

quantitative imperatives and results.   

Calls centers experience high employee turnover often attributed to the unskilled nature 


 

54 

of employees drawn to theenvironment, lower wages for the effort and knowledge necessary to 

perform the job, and the frenzied nature of theenvironment (Samad, 2006; Sawyerr, Srinivas, & 

Sijun, 2009; Siong et al., 2006; Yeh, 2007).  Call centers typically experience a 35% to 50% 

turnover of staff per annum (IBISWorld, 2010).  In comparison, the turnover rate for all 

industries in the United States was 3.2% for 2009, a significant difference from the turnover rate 

for call centers (U.S. Department of Labor, 2010b).  

Garman, Davis-Lenane, and Corrigan (2003) concluded the transactional leadership 

approach, management by exception, serves as the “essential aspect of leadership in most service 

delivery environments” (p. 804).  The call center closely aligns with a service delivery 

environment as theorganization provides a service of interacting with organizational customers.  

Typical interaction of leaders with employees occurs in the active and passive monitoring of 

work efforts of employees.  Technology provides active monitoring of performance and 

adherence to work standards allowing a proactive approach by leadership to ensure 

representatives’ performance and adherence to work standards.  Escalated customer concerns and 

complaints provide the passive monitoring of work efforts to leaders. 

Research highlightsthe need for call center leadership to focus on the relational aspects to 

create an environment within call centers conducive to employee satisfaction (Bentein, 

Vandenberg, Vandenberghe, & Stinglhamber, 2005).  Halliden and Monks (2005) and Sawyerr, 

Srinivas, and Sijun (2009) offered employee-centered activities that focus on relationship 

building among and with employees and leaders could increase performance and change.  Varca 

(2006) suggested empowering call center representatives as a way to reduce job stress inherent in 

the call center environment.  Theempowerment can take the form of increasing decision 

discretion and enlarging worker responsibilities.  Biron and Bamberger (2010), Connell, Hannif, 


 

55 

and Burgess (2009), Dean and Rainnie (2009), and Mahesh and Kasturi (2006) identified the 

need for giving up control and use empowerment by tapping into the intrinsic motivation of call 

center representatives has a positive correlation with employee and organizational effectiveness. 

Conclusions 

Leaders influence human behavior, motivation, and job satisfaction by manipulating the 

environment in a manner that allows employee motivation toward aligning personal goals with 

organizational goals (Maslow, 2000c).  Organizational leadership may recognize satisfaction at 

work often occurs when employees receive motivation to fulfill esteem and self-actualization.  

Job satisfaction is a result of individuals’ conscious and unconscious reactions in the workplace 

to physical, psychological, social, and cognitive stimuli.  The contentment of human needs, the 

impetus of motivators, the realization of rewards, and the fulfillment of core job elements 

contribute to employee job satisfaction in organizations (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980; 

Herzberg et al., 1993; Locke & Latham, 2004; Maslow, 1987, 2000a). 

Leaders transform organizations into healthy and high-performance entities.  Leaders in 

such organizations commit employees into action to perform unselfishly to achieve more in 

performance and dedication by appealing to and satisfying the motivational needs of followers 

(Ilies, Judge, & Wagner, 2006; Rosen, 1996).  Theorist and researchers suggest transformational 

leadership raises morality and motivation for the leader, follower, and organization (Bass & 

Avolio, 1990, 1993, 2004; Burns, 1978; McGregor, 2006).   

Research highlights the interrelatedness of leadership, job satisfaction, organizational 

commitment, and employee retention.  Organizations embracing and increasing the 

interrelatedness find opportunities to expand and sustain performance and competitive advantage 

within industries.  Transformational leader understand the potential of satisfied and engaged 


 

56 

employees and strive to move followers into leaders in the mutual gratification of individual and 

organizational goals and development (Caykoylu, Egri, & Havlovic, 2007; Siong et al., 2006; 

Walumbwa et al., 2004).  

Call centers provide unique grounds for leaders to foster job satisfaction, organizational 

commitment, and employee retention.  Call centers provide the single point of contact for an 

organization’s customers with transactional types of interactions with customers (Gorjup et al., 

2008).  Technology is both friend and foe in call centers.  Technology provides the means to 

move customer calls to representatives and to monitor and measure employee performance 

(Barnes, 2007).  Call centers experience high employee turnover often attributed to the unskilled 

nature of employees drawn to theenvironment, lower wages for the effort and knowledge 

necessary to perform the job, and the frenzied nature of the environment (Harney & Jordan, 

2008; Holdsworth & Cartwright, 2003). 

Summary 

Human motivation energizes, directs, and sustains behavior (Robbins, 2005).  A 

relationship exists between motivation and job satisfaction as the fulfillment of human needs 

leads to job satisfaction (Maslow, 2000c; Herzberg, 1968).  Job satisfaction results as an 

employee finds motivation when the effort needed yields better job performance, job 

performance leads to rewards, and the rewards have value for the employee (Lawler & Porter, 

1967; Vroom, 1995). 

Transformational leadership results in mutual motivation between leaders and followers 

to achieve high levels of success in the pursuit of collective goals (Burns, 1978).  

Transformational leadership concerns an engagement between leaders and followers to 

completing common goals with mutual benefits (Burns, 1978).  Fostering followership is vital to 


 

57 

organizational success and leadership success (Abramson, 2007; Bjugstad et al., 2006).  

For many organizations, call centers provide the single point of contact with their 

customers (Ellis & Taylor, 2006).  Call centers focus on multiple employees responding to 

customer needs in an environment, often plagued with modes of operations not evident in other 

industries (Rose & Wright, 2005).  Leaders are fundamental to employee job satisfaction, aiding 

the organization to achieve customer satisfaction (Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 

2006). 

Chapter 2 examined the interrelatedness of human motivation, employee job satisfaction, 

and leadership behaviors at work in organizations, and specifically, calls centers.  Leaders 

influence job satisfaction through supporting and fostering an encouraging culture for individuals 

to satisfy higher-level needs.  Theoverview of the germinal theories and current literature of 

human motivation, employee job satisfaction, and leadership behaviors looked at these variables 

in providing the basis for theresearch study.  Chapter 3 presents the methodology for evaluating 

the relationship of supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in call 

centers in the electric utility industry in the United States. 

 

 


 

58 

CHAPTER 3: METHOD 

The purpose of thequantitative correlational research study wasto evaluate the 

relationship of supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in six call 

centers serving the electric utility industry in the United States.  The study examined the 

perceptions of call center representatives about which leadership behaviors motivate, develop, 

and support job satisfaction.  Theinformation will allow a call center organization to develop and 

improve particular leadership behaviors that influence job satisfaction of call center 

representatives.  Chapter 3 provides a description of the research method and design 

appropriateness, research questions, population, sampling frame, informed consent, 

confidentiality, geographic location, data collection, instrumentation, validity and reliability, and 

data analysis. 

Research Method and Design Appropriateness 

Research method.The research study used a quantitative correlational research method 

to evaluate the relationships of supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job 

satisfaction of call center representatives.  The quantitative method measures variables, 

investigates relationships between variables, tests theories, and investigates issues for large 

groups of individuals making the method suitable for the research problem (Arcidiacono et al., 

2009; Hanson & Grimmer, 2007; Leedy & Ormrod, 2005).  Quantitative research allows 

discovery of relationships with a basis in finding reliability and validity of the research subject 

(Borrego et al., 2009; Hanson & Grimmer, 2007).  Quantitative research reduces issues and data 

to numbers, definitive in meaning, and discovering how much and how many by concentrating 

on experimentation with predefined variables through collecting and measuring data (Draper, 

2004).   


 

59 

Vivar, McQueen, Whyte, and Armayor (2007) suggested the aim of a research study 

influences the research method with qualitative research inquiring into the human experience 

with the intent to describe and understand the experience.  The qualitative inquiry does not 

predict future experiences but collects and analyzes textual data with an emphasis on content 

(Borrego et al., 2009).  Edmondson and McManus (2007) identified qualitative research fits 

inquiry areas not well-researched or new areas for inquiry.  The qualitative research method 

wasnot suitable for the investigation as the intent of the study wasto explore relationships 

between the predictive and criterion variables (Arcidiacono et al., 2009; Hanson & Grimmer, 

2005).  Theresearch study further extended recognized areas of research by applying previous 

research and theories in the call center environment.   

Research design.A composite electronic survey assessed the perceptions of call center 

representatives about the leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction variables and collected 

demographic information.  The composite survey included the Multifactor Leadership 

Questionnaire (MLQ), Job Descriptive Index (JDI) scale, Job In General (JIG) scale, and 

demographic survey items as suggested by Balzer et al. (2000).  The demographic information 

allowed exploration of possible regional differences betweencall centers (Fink, 2006; Vogt, 

2007).  The MLQ, as presented in Appendix A, is a reputable and valid survey of leadership 

behavior styles used for self-evaluation and subordinate-evaluation, often integrated into leader 

learning and development programs (Kanste, Miettunen, & Kyngas, 2007).  Mind Garden, Inc., 

granted permission to use the MLQ for the study (see Appendix B).  The JDI and JIG scales, as 

presented in Appendix C, are premier instruments for assessing employee job satisfaction from a 

multifaceted approach and an overall job approach (Nasser, 2005; Onder & Basim, 2008).  

Bowling Green University granted permission to use the JDI and JIG scales in an electronic 


 

60 

format for the research study (see Appendix D). 

The electronic administration of the survey allowed ease of use by the participants.  

Electronic survey administration often elicits a higher response rate from participants and quick 

access to survey data for the researcher (Al-Omiri, 2007; Amar, 2008).  The research study 

provided the data to assess possible relationships between leadership behavior styles and job 

satisfaction using multiple correlation and regression analysis.  

Multiple correlation and regression analysis provided the means of understanding the 

relationships that may exist in theresearch study.  Specifically, the study exploredtwo 

relationships: (a) the relationship of leadership behavior styles to job satisfaction and (b) the 

relationship of leadership behaviors and motivational components of job satisfaction.  

Correlational analysis measured the strength of relationships between the predictive and criterion 

variables (Bobko, 2001; Miles & Shevlin, 2001).  Theanalysis showed the existence of 

relationships but not the cause of the relationships (Holmberg et al., 2008).  Regression analysis 

explored the effectiveness of leadership behavior styles forpredicting job satisfaction variables 

within call centers in the electric utility industry.  The regression analysis described and 

measured the association between the variables of the study (Bobko, 2001; Miles & Shevlin, 

2001). 

Research Questions and Hypotheses 

The research study evaluated leadership behavior styles displayed by call center 

supervisors as sensed by employees in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The 

research further examined the relationship of leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction, 

from the perspective of the call center representatives.  Thestudy sought to answer these 

questions:  


 

61 

RQ1: What is the relationship between the job satisfaction variables and each of the eight 

leadership behavior styles? 

RQ2: What is the likelihood that the transformational leadership behavior style predicts 

job satisfaction? 

RQ3: What is the likelihood that the contingent reward leadership behavior style predicts 

job satisfaction? 

The hypothesis is the way to state a research problem, providing a probable answer to the 

research questions (Thomas & Brubaker, 2008).  The authors claimed the hypothesis serves two 

purposes.  The hypothesis guides the process in solving the problem presented for research.  The 

hypothesis provides the intent of the research study.  Locke, Spirduso, and Silverman (2000) 

stated the hypothesis serves as a bridge between the theory behind the question or problem of the 

research study and the research.  The hypothesis serves as a declarative statement that becomes 

the basis for the research. 

The leadership behavior styles as displayed by the call center supervisors are the styles of 

leadership as defined by Bass and Avolio’s (1990, 1993) model of full range leadership (FRL).  

The leadership behavior styles included idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual 

stimulation, individualized consideration, contingent reward, management by exception-active 

(MBE-A), management by exception-passive (MBE-P), and laissez-faire (Bass & Avolio, 1990, 

1993).  The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire helped in identifying the leadership behavior 

styles (Avolio & Bass, 2004).  Smith et al.’s (1969) Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In 

General (JIG) scales served as the basis for determining job satisfaction of call center 

representatives.  These scales determined employee satisfaction with (a) work in present job, (b) 

present pay, (c) promotion opportunities, (d) supervision, (e) coworkers, and (f) job in 


 

general(Smith et al., 1969).   

62 

Walumbwa, Lawler et al. (2005), Walumbwa, Orwa et al. (2005), and Bennett (2009) 

identified transformational leadership as exhibiting a positive relationship on employee job 

satisfaction.The transformational leadership behavior style has four distinct aspects: (a) 

individual consideration, (b) intellectual stimulation, (c) inspirational motivation, and (d) 

idealized influence (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 

2006).Bass, Avolio, Jung, and Berson (2003), Goodwin, Wofford, and Whittington (2001), 

Judge and Piccolo (2004), and Prabhakar (2005) considered contingent reward as both 

transactional and transformational leadership behaviors and a means of worker motivation. 

The following hypotheses provided the basis to evaluate leadership behavior styles 

demonstrated by call center supervisors and job satisfaction of call center representatives: 

H10: No relationship exists between job satisfaction of call center representatives and 

each of the eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in call centers in the 

electric utility industry. 

H1a:  A significant relationship exists between job satisfaction of call center 

representatives and each of the eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in 

call centers in the electric utility industry. 

H20: The leadership behavior style perceived as transformational does not predict job 

satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry. 

H2a: The leadership behavior style perceived as transformational predicts job satisfaction 

of call center representatives in the electric utility industry. 

H30: The leadership behavior style perceived as contingent reward does not predict job 

satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry. 


 

63 

H3a: The leadership behavior style perceived as contingent reward predicts job 

satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry. 

Population 

The study population was528call center representatives in six call centers of the electric 

utility industry in the United States.  Call centers in Corpus Christi, Texas; Fort Wayne, Indiana; 

Groveport, Ohio; Hurricane, West Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Tulsa, Oklahoma took  

part in thestudy.  The member group consisted of 509full-time representatives and 19 part-time 

representatives.  The member group had a diverse cultural composition of females (79%, n = 

417) and males (21%, n = 111).  Table 2identifies the population by location at the time the study 

will begin.  

The population of call center representatives in the electric utility industry was difficult to 

determine precisely.  Specific statistics for call centers in the electric utility industry do not exist.  

Statistics existed for the general call center industry, showing significant employment presence 

of the call center industry in the United States.  The call center industry ranked among the largest 

occupations in the United States with 2.3 million call center representatives employed in 

approximately 5,242 call centers across the United States (IBISWorld, 2010; U.S. Department of 

Labor, 2010a). 

The large number of employees in call centers, inability to determine an industry-specific 

population, cost, and time prohibited achieving a suitable sample size.  Neuman (2006) 

suggested a sampling ratio between 0.025 and 1% for the size of the population, relying on the 

ability to obtain a random sample of the population.  The sampling ratio would require a sample 

size between 5,631 and 22,524 call center representatives. 

Kadam and Bhalerao (2010) suggested the sample for a research study is representative 


 

64 

of the entire population when all individuals within the population have equal opportunity to take 

part and selection for participation is random.  For the research study, generalization to the 

populationwasquestionable, limiting the ability to make definitive analysis and statements for the 

greater population of call center representatives in the electric utility industry (Trochim & 

Donnelly, 2007; Vogt, 2007).  Insight and suggestions for further analysis resulted from the data 

and analysis from the research study.

To decide the sample size for the research study, Thomas (2003) suggested confidence in 

data analysis and research results and the cost of conducting a research study increase as the 

sample size increases.  Kadam and Bhalerao (2010) offered the correct sample size is important 

to avoid bias in interpreting results, to detect differences in the population, and to lessen risks of 


 

65 

intervention.  For the research study, a sample size of 58 to 105 subjects is ideal for the statistical 

analysis of relationships between the predictive and criterion variables, as suggested by Miles 

and Shevlin (2001) and Tabachnick and Fidell (2007).  A minimum of 58 subjects wasideal for 

testing the R2 of a regression model, whereas a minimum of 105 subjects wasideal for 

significance tests on regression slopes. 

Power analysis suggests a sample size of 65 subjects, based on alpha = 0.05, effect size = 

0.50, and power criterion = 0.80 (Miles & Shevlin, 2001).  A sample size of 65 subjects 

wasprobable with the total population of the six call centers.  Looking at the six call centers 

individually, the sample size as suggested by power analysis wasnot present in populations in 

Corpus Christi and Fort Wayne.  The populations in the call centers in Shreveport and Tulsa are 

above the suggested sample size but required a significant response rate to meet the ideal sample 

size for statistical analysis. 

Informed Consent 

The Managing Director of Customer Services for the participating call center 

organization sent an e-mail to the organization’s call center representatives announcing the 

research study.  The managing director gave permission to use the premises and access to the 

subject for the study, as provided in Appendix E.  The researcher contacted the call center 

representatives by e-mail providing the nature and related details of the research study and 

seeking their participation by completing an electronic survey.  The e-mail from the researcher 

included information about participation in the study and the website link for completing the 

survey.  The research study ensured voluntary participation without retribution to the call center 

representatives.   

Completion of the survey instrument was anonymous with no retention of name of 


 

66 

participants and other identifiable association with survey responses.  The e-mail included the 

informed consent for participation in the research that the call center representative can save.  

The survey instrument began with the informed consent with an affirmative response allowing 

the representative to continue with the MLQ, JDI, and JIG instruments.  Appendix F contains an 

image of the informed consent for the research study.The Internet-based survey administrator 

permitted limiting access to the survey based on the response to a specific question selected by 

the subject.  The control for the informed consent page of the survey instrument was set to 

require an affirmative response to continue with the survey.  The response to the “informed 

consent” survey item and responses to the survey items will remain with and secured by the 

researcher for 3 years. 

Confidentiality 

The researcher will retain the survey data in an electronic format for 3years.  Access to 

research documentation and data will remain with the researcher only.  At the end of the 3years, 

destruction of research documentation and data will occurwith the physical and electronic 

shredding of all documentation, data, and files related to the research study. 

The Internet-based survey administrator, SurveyMonkey.com, hosted the survey 

instrument and survey responses collected from the subjects in the research study.  

SurveyMonkey.com maintains a privacy policy ensuring the privacy and confidentiality for data 

collected, limiting access to the survey application and associated tools to the researcher through 

an account login process.  The researcher is the owner of the survey instrument and collected 

data.  SurveyMonkey.com ensures the security of its infrastructure, covering the physical, 

network, hardware, and software aspects of operations. 

 

 


 

Geographic Location 

67 

The location for thequantitative correlational research study was the six call centers of an 

electric utility organization.  Call centers in Corpus Christi, Texas; Fort Wayne, Indiana; 

Groveport, Ohio; Hurricane, West Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Tulsa, Oklahoma took 

part in thestudy.  The six call centers perform the same processes, interact with the same 

customer interface, and follow the same procedures and rules governing customer interaction. 

Data Collection 

The call center representatives electing to take part in theresearch study completed an 

electronic survey accessible by a website link provided in an e-mail from the researcher.  The e-

mail contained other information about the study and informed consent declaration.  By 

accessing the website link, the call center representatives reviewed the informed consent 

declaration.  An affirmative response allowed the representative to move forward in the 

electronic survey to a composite and seamless presentation of the MLQ, JDI, and JIG 

instruments.  The estimated time to complete the survey was 25 minutes.  Once all participating 

call center representatives completed the survey, the researcher accessed the data provided by the 

survey instrument for further analysis.Compelling rationale for using the MLQ, JDI, and JIG in 

the research study included the simplicity and ubiquity of the instruments. 

Instrumentation 

The survey instrument consisted of three sections.  The Multifactor Leadership 

Questionnaire (MLQ) Rater Form (Avolio & Bass, 2004) assessed call center representatives’ 

perceptions of leadership behaviors.  The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In General (JIG) 

scales (Smith et al., 1969) assessed call center representatives’ job satisfaction.  Demographic 

informationprovided descriptive data about the subjects participating in the survey (Balzer et al., 


 

68 

2000).  The three sections of the survey appeared as a composite survey in an electronic format 

that subjects in the research study accessed with a website link supplied by the researcher in an 

e-mail (see Appendix G). 

MLQ.  Developed by Avolio and Bass in 1985, the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 

(MLQ) measuresleadership behavior styles ranging from passive to transactional to 

transformational.  The purpose of the MLQ is to reveal the significant factors that distinguish 

between effective and ineffective leadership.  Effective leadership is integral to organizational 

success and knowing individual leadership inclination ensures continued success for leaders, 

employees, and organizations (Kanste et al., 2007). 

The MLQ is a multidimensional instrument allowing leaders to understand their 

leadership behavior styles as identified by transformational behavior, transactional behavior, 

passive behavior, and follower outcome factors (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Kanste et al., 2007).  

Transformational leadership behaviors include idealized influence attributes, idealized influence 

behaviors, influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized 

consideration.  Transactional leadership behaviors include contingent reward and management 

by exception-active (MBE-A).  Passive leadership behaviors include management by exception-

passive (MBE-P) and laissez-faire.  The follower outcome factors include extra effort, 

effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leadership (Avolio & Bass, 2004). 

As a learning and development tool, the MLQ helps leaders to identify their strengths and 

weaknesses from two viewpoints: self-evaluation and subordinate-evaluation.  As a 360-degree 

feedback tool, leaders identify their perceptions of their leadership behaviors and receive 

feedback from subordinates on the views of their leadership (Avolio & Bass, 2004).  Kanste, 

Miettunen, and Kyngas (2007) supported the validity and reliability of the MLQ as an instrument 


 

69 

for measuring leadership behavior and confirmed the multidimensional model of leadership as 

suggested by the Cronbach’s α coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.94 for leadership behavior 

styles.  

The MLQ Rater Form(Form 5x-Short)(Avolio & Bass, 2004) consists of 45 items that 

identify and measure the nine leadership behavior styles and the three follower outcome factors.  

The subjects completing the form used a five-point Likert-type scale with responses includingnot 

at all, once in a while, sometimes, fairly often, or frequently, if not always.  Theresearch study 

used the subordinates’ evaluations of supervisor leadership behaviors andsubordinates’ rating of 

job satisfaction to discover possible relationships.  Appendix Hprovides a partial presentation of 

the MLQ Rater Form (Avolio & Bass, 2004), showing five questions and the measurement scale 

used in thequestionnaire.Appendix B provides an image of the permission to use the MLQ 

instrument document.  Appendix I provides an image of the e-mail granting permission to use the 

MLQ instrument in an electronic format for the research study. 

JDI and JIG.  Developed by Smith et al. (1969), the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job 

In General (JIG) scales are one of the more widely used instruments for researching job 

satisfaction in organizations (Nasser, 2005).  Appendix C provides an image of the JDI and JIG 

scales.  Appendix D provides an image of the permission to use the JDI and JIG scales in the 

research study.  

The JDI assesses five facets of job satisfaction including (a) work in present job, (b) 

present pay, (c) promotion opportunities, (d) supervision, and (e) coworkers (Smith et al., 1969).  

The JIG provides an overall evaluation of job satisfaction.  Nasser (2005) suggested high 

reliability exists with an internal consistency coefficient at or above r = +.80 for each of the five 

facets and the overall scale.  Onder and Basim’s (2008) study supported the reliability and 


 

70 

validity of the JDI and JIG scales across national contexts with Cronbach’s α coefficient ranging 

from 0.74 to 0.93 for the five facets of job satisfaction and overall job satisfaction. 

On the JDI and JIG scales, the subjects in the research study think about the five facets of 

job satisfaction and overall job satisfaction and respond to words or phrases aboutwhether the 

word or phrase describes the facet or overall job.  The “work in present job” facet has 18 items 

for response, with nine items for the “present pay” facet, nine items for the “promotion 

opportunities” facet, 18 items for the “supervision” facet, 18 items for the “coworkers” facet, and 

18 for the overall job evaluation.  The subjects selectedyes if the word or phrase described the 

facet or overall job, no if the word or phrase did not describe the facet or overall job, or ? if 

uncertain the word or phrase described the facet or overall job. 

Brown and Lam (2008) agreed with the previous research on the JDI and JIG scales that 

two general approaches exist for understanding job satisfaction.  The global approach views job 

satisfaction as a single belieftoward the job resulting in anevaluation of the overall job.  The 

facet approach assesses job satisfaction on the different aspects of a job eliciting perceptional and 

affective reactions.  Bowling et al. (2008) and Fichter and Cipolla (2010) suggested five job 

facets of job satisfaction: work itself, compensation, promotional opportunity, coworker 

interaction, and supervision.  Employees evaluate the work itself by assessing opportunities for 

autonomy, creativity, job enrichment, job complexity, knowledge acquisition, responsibility, and 

task variety.  Employees evaluate actual compensation versus expected compensation, looking 

for congruency of the two factors.  Employees evaluate promotional opportunities from the 

fairness in policies and administration of promotions within an organization.  Employees seek 

positive relationships with coworkers strengthening individual and group interactions.  

Employees evaluate supervision using the criteria of employee consideration, employee 


 

71 

inclusiveness, and relationship behaviors (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009). 

Demographic information.  The research study collected demographic information to 

allow analysis by subgroups.  For theresearch study, the demographic items in the survey 

included call center location, job tenure, job level, education, company tenure, race, gender, and 

employment status, as suggested by Balzer et al. (2000).  Appendix Jprovides the demographic 

items and the associated responses for each demographic item for the composite survey 

instrument.  Balzer et al. (2000) suggested limiting the number of demographic items to 

avoiddiscouraging asubject fromresponding to the survey.  The demographic information will 

allow exploration of possible regional differences among call centersand the various subgroups 

the data presents for analysis of possible relationships between the predictor and criterion 

variables (Fink, 2006; Vogt, 2007). 

Validity and Reliability 

Validity shows the accuracy and generalizability of the research study, instrumentation, 

and results (Borrego et al., 2009; Vogt, 2007).  Reliability implies the consistency of the research 

study, instrumentation, and results (Borrego et al., 2009; Vogt, 2007).  From an instrumentation 

viewpoint, the use of the MLQ instrument and the JDI and JIG scales provided inherent internal 

validity and reliability to the research study (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Balzer et al., 2000; Kanste et 

al., 2007; Nasser, 2005; Onder & Basim, 2008). 

Internal validity and external validity.Internal validity occurs when the instruments 

measure as intended(Borrego et al., 2009; Vogt, 2007).  External validity occurs when 

generalizations of the results of the research study extend beyond the sample to the population 

(Borrego et al., 2009; Vogt, 2007).  Avolio and Bass (2004) and Kanste et al. (2007) supported 

the validity of the MLQ instrument for measurement accuracy and results generalizability.  


 

72 

Balzer et al. (2000), Nasser (2005), and Onder and Basim (2008) concluded from research efforts 

both the JDI scale and the JIG scale exhibit validity in accuracy and generalizability. 

Reliability.Reliability suggests an instrument or measurement tool demonstrates 

consistency in results in repeated trials (Borrego et al., (2009).  The research studies conducted 

by Avolio and Bass (2004) and Kanste et al. (2007) supported the reliability of the MLQ 

instrument.  Balzer et al. (2000) showed the coefficient alpha values for the JDI and JIG scales to 

be .90 for work in present job, .86 for present pay, .87 for promotion opportunities, .91 for 

supervision, .91 for coworkers, and .92 for job in general.Nasser (2005) suggested high 

reliability exists for the JIG and JDI scales with an internal consistency coefficient at or above r 

= +.80 for each of the five facets and the overall scale. 

Data Analysis 

The Internet-basedsurvey administrator for the electronic survey collected data from each 

subject taking part in the research study.  The researcher downloaded the data into Microsoft 

Excel and SPSS 18.0 for descriptive and inferential statistical analysis.  Descriptive analysis 

described the characteristics of the data obtained through the survey process used in the research 

study.  Descriptive analysis summarizedthe study variables with the calculation of the mean, 

median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for all study variables.  The 

descriptive analysis measured central tendency and variation. 

Multiple correlation and regression analysis provided the means of understanding the 

relationships that exist in the research study.  Specifically, the study explored two relationships: 

(a) the relationship of leadership behavior styles to job satisfaction and (b) the relationship of 

leadership behaviors to motivational components of job satisfaction.  Correlational analysis 

evaluatedthe strength of relationships between the predictive and criterion variables (Bobko, 


 

73 

2001; Miles & Shevlin, 2001).  Theanalysis shows the existence of relationships but not the 

causes of the relationships (Holmberg et al., 2008).   

Regression analysis investigated the successof leadership behavior styles predicting job 

satisfaction variables within call centers in the electric utility industry.  The multiple regression 

analysis described the association between the variables of the study (Bobko, 2001; Miles & 

Shevlin, 2001).The general purpose of multiple regression analysis was to understand the 

functional relationship between predictor and criterion variables by examining the strength of 

contribution of the predictor variables to the criterion variables.  The leadership behavior styles 

of idealized, influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized 

consideration, contingent reward, management by exception-active, management by exception-

passiveand laissez-faire were the predictor variables for the study.  The job satisfaction 

components of work in present job, present pay, promotion opportunities, supervision, 

coworkers, and job in generalwere the criterion variables for the research study. 

The testing schema for Hypothesis 1 included the calculation of Pearson’s rcorrelation 

coefficients.  Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between each of the eight leadership 

behavior styles and the six job satisfaction variables.  The .05 significance level (p < .05) served 

as the rejection level for the null hypothesis.  Should the analysis warrant rejecting the null 

hypothesis, further analysis determined the direction of correlation as positive or negative and 

the strength of the relationship described in terms of weak, moderate, strong, or very strong.  

Salkind (2003) suggested the strength of variable relationships is weak if the correlation 

coefficient is between r = .20 and r = .40, moderate if between r = .40 and r = .60, strong if 

between r = .60 and r = .80, and very strong if between r = .80 and r = 1.00. 

The testing schema for Hypothesis 2 included multiple regression analysis.  Hypothesis 2 


 

74 

explored the effectiveness of the transformational leadership behavior style for predicting job 

satisfaction variables within call centers in the electric utility industry.  Multiple regression 

analysis used a probability level of p ≤ .05 as the significance level.  A stepwise selection 

multiple regression procedure developed the prediction models for thehypothesis.  The stepwise 

selection method improved the predictions from the model by reducing the number of variables 

in the model, resulting in a small, readily interpretable model containing the most important 

predictors in a prediction equation.  In the stepwise selection method, variables became part of 

the regression equation one at a time using the statistical criterion of maximizing the R2 of the 

included variables, creating a statistically significant relationship between the variables (Miles & 

Shevlin, 2001). 

The testing schema for Hypothesis 3 included simple linear regression analysis.  

Hypothesis 3 explored the effectiveness of the leadership behavior style of contingent reward for 

predicting job satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility industry.The simple linear 

regression analysis used a probability level of p ≤ .05 as the significance level.The simple linear 

regression procedure developed the prediction models for Hypothesis 3 to determine the 

statistical significance of the relationship between contingent reward and each of the job 

satisfaction variables of the study. 

Summary 

A quantitative correlational research methodevaluated the relationships of supervisory 

leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction of call center representatives in the 

research study.  The quantitative method measured variables, investigated relationships between 

variables, tested theories, and investigated issues for large groups of individuals making the 

method suitable for the research problem for the study (Arcidiacono et al., 2009; Hanson 


 

75 

&Grimmer, 2007; Leedy & Ormrod, 2005).  Correlational analysis measured the strength of 

relationships between the predictive and criterion variables (Bobko, 2001; Miles & Shevlin, 

2001). 

Chapter 3 provided a description of the research study that evaluated the relationship of 

supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in call centers.  Thestudy 

specifically targeted call centers in the electric utility industry.  Chapter 3 provided a description 

of the various aspects of the research study including the research method and design 

appropriateness, research questions, population, sampling frame, informed consent, 

confidentiality, geographic location, data collection, instrumentation, validity and reliability, and 

data analysis.  Chapter 4 provides the research study results based on the statistical analysis 

resulting in accepting or rejecting the hypotheses of the research study.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS 

The purpose of the correlational research study was to evaluate the relationship of 

supervisory leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in six call centers serving the 

electric utility industry in the United States and examine which leadership behaviors motivate, 

develop, and support job satisfaction.  The information may allow a call center organization to 

develop and improve particular leadership behaviors that influence job satisfaction of call center 

representatives.   

Managing the customer experience including customer satisfaction and retention is 

important for organizations.  Kantsperger and Kunz (2005) suggested employee job satisfaction 

is a major cause driving and achieving customer satisfaction.  Management is fundamental to 

employee job satisfaction, assisting the organization to achieve customer satisfaction 

(Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 2006). 

Udechukwu (2009) suggested the treatment of employees by leaders within organizations 

influences employee turnover.  The positive impact of leaders contributes to satisfied employees 

who identify with the organization and demonstrate a commitment to stay with the organization 

as realized in increased employee performance and productivity.  The negative impact of leaders 

contributes to employee dissatisfaction as demonstrated in decreased organizational 

identification, commitment, performance, and productivity.Chapter 4describesthe findings of the 

data collection and statistical analysis for the research study.   

Research Questions and Hypotheses 

The research study evaluated leadership behavior styles displayed by call center 

supervisors as sensed by employees in the electric utility industry in the United States and 

examined the relationship of leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction.  The study addressed 


 

77 

three guiding questions focusing on the relationships between the job satisfaction variables and 

each of the eight leadership behavior styles, the likelihood that the transformational leadership 

behavior style predicted job satisfaction, and the likelihood that the contingent reward leadership 

behavior style predicted job satisfaction. 

The hypotheses of the research studyprovided the basis to evaluate leadership behavior 

styles demonstrated by call center supervisors and job satisfaction of call center representatives.  

Hypothesis 1 evaluated the existence of relationships between job satisfaction of call center 

representatives and each of the eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in 

call centers in the electric utility industry.  Hypothesis 2 evaluated the possibility of predicting 

job satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry with the leadership 

behavior style perceived as transformational.  Hypothesis 3 evaluated the possibility of 

predicting job satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry with the 

leadership behavior style perceived as contingent reward. 

Research Process 

Research Instrument.A survey instrument provided the means to gather data about 

leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction as perceived by call center representatives.  The 

survey instrument consisted of three sections.  The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 

Rater Form (Avolio & Bass, 2004) assessed call center representatives’ perceptions of leadership 

behaviors.  The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In General (JIG) scales (Smith et al., 1969) 

assessed call center representatives’ job satisfaction.  Demographic information provided 

descriptive data about the subjects participating in the survey (Balzer et al., 2000).  The three 

sections of the survey appeared as a composite survey in an electronic format that subjects in the 

research study accessed with a website link supplied by the researcher in an e-mail.  


 

78 

MLQ.The MLQ is a multidimensional instrument helping leaders understand their 

leadership behavior styles as identified by transformational behavior, transactional behavior, 

passive behavior, and follower outcome factors (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Kanste et al., 2007).  

Transformational leadership behaviors include idealized attributes influence, idealized behaviors 

influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.  

Transactional leadership behaviors include contingent reward and management by exception-

active (MBE-A).  Passive leadership behaviors include management by exception-passive 

(MBE-P) and laissez-faire.   

The MLQ Rater Form (Form 5x-Short) (Avolio & Bass, 2004) consists of 45 items that 

identify and measure eight leadership behavior styles and three follower outcome factors.  The 

subjects completing the form used a five-point Likert-type scale with responses includingnot at 

all, once in a while, sometimes, fairly often, or frequently if not always.  The research study used 

the subordinates’ evaluations of supervisor leadership behaviors and subordinates’ ratings of job 

satisfaction to discover possible relationships.  The eight leadership behavior styles were the 

predictor variables for the research study. 

JDI and JIG.Developed by Smith et al. (1969), the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job 

In General (JIG) scales are two of the more widely used instruments for researching job 

satisfaction in organizations (Nasser, 2005).  The JDI assesses five facets of job satisfaction 

including (a) work in present job (W), (b) present pay (P), (c) promotion opportunities (PR), (d) 

supervision (S), and (e) coworkers (C) (Smith et al., 1969).  The JIG provides an overall 

evaluation of job satisfaction. 

On the JDI and JIG scales, the subjects responded to words or phrases about whether the 

word or phrase described the five facets of job satisfaction or overall job satisfaction.  The work 


 

79 

in present jobfacet has 18 items for response with nine items for the present pay facet, nine items 

for the promotion opportunities facet, 18 items for the supervision facet, 18 items for the 

coworkers facet, and 18 for the overall job evaluation.  The subjects selected yes if the word or 

phrase described the facet or overall job, no if the word or phrase did not describe the facet or 

overall job, or ? if uncertain whether the word or phrase described the facet or overall job.  The 

five facets of job satisfaction and overall job satisfaction were the criterion variables for the 

research study. 

Demographic information.The research study collected demographic information to 

allow analysis by subgroups.  For the research study, the demographic items in the survey 

included call center location, job tenure, job level, education, company tenure, race, gender, and 

employment status, as suggested by Balzer et al. (2000).    

Data Collection.The call center representatives electing to take part in the research study 

completed an electronic survey accessible by a website link provided in an e-mail from the 

researcher.  The e-mail contained information about the study and informed consent declaration.  

By accessing the website link, the call center representatives reviewed the informed consent 

declaration.  An affirmative response allowed the representative to move forward in the 

electronic survey to a composite and seamless presentation of the MLQ, JDI, and JIG 

instruments.  With no identity information regarding participation collected, a second response to 

informed consent provided confirmation of the participation of call center representatives in the 

research study.The average time to complete the survey was 20 minutes.  Once all participating 

call center representatives completed the survey, the researcher accessed the data provided by the 

survey instrument for further analysis. 

Between December 5, 2010 and December 23, 2010, 88 call center representatives

responded to the survey representing a 16.67% response rate.  Of the completed surveys, the 

elimination of two responses occurred because of no affirmation of the second response to 

informed consent.  As a result, 86 surveys provided the sample for statistical analysis 

representing a 16.29% adjusted response rate.  As presented in Chapter 3, a sample size of 58 to 

105 subjects was ideal for the statistical analysis of relationships between the predictive and 

criterion variables (Miles& Shevlin, 2001; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). 

Data Analysis 

Survey data was downloaded from the Internet-based survey administrator for the 

electronic survey into a Microsoft Excel worksheet to recode responses to the MLQ survey items 

and to calculate the mean scores for the eight leadership behavior variables.  A review of the data 

revealed no failure of respondents to provide acceptable responses to the survey items.  Normal 

distribution was assumed due to the size of each variable group investigated was greater than 30.  

Parametric tests were used to perform correlational analysis with the confidence level for the 

research study established at 95% and significance established at p = .05. 

For consistency with past analysis of MLQ data, the numerical values of the MLQ survey 

responses were recoded for agreement and ease in comparing to validated results.  Survey 

responses frequently if not always were recoded from 5 to 4, fairly often from 4 to 3, sometimes 

from 3 to 2,  once in a while from 2 to 1, and not at all from 1 to 0. 

Bass and Avolio (2004) suggested mean scores be calculated for each set of questions 

related to a specific leadership behavior variable.  The mean score was calculated in a Microsoft 

Excel worksheet using the questions associated to each leadership behavior variables.  The eight 

leadership variable sets consisted of four questions, except idealized influence that consisted of 

eight questions. 


 

81 

Following the recoding and calculating of mean scores for MLQ survey items, the valid 

data were loaded into SPSS 18.0 for further recoding and the descriptive and inferential 

statistical analysis.  Using a SPSS syntax file provided by Bowling Green University, recoding of 

the JDI/JIG survey responses was necessary due to the nature of the questioning within the 

satisfaction scales.  Approximately half of the items for a satisfaction scale are worded favorably 

and the other items are worded unfavorably.  With the favorable items in a satisfaction scale, a 

response of Yes received 3 points, a response of No received 0 points, and a response of ? 

received 1 point.  The unfavorable items are reversed-scored such that a response of Yes received 

0 points, a response of No received 3 points, and a response of ? received 1 point.  Calculation of 

the final scores resulted by summing the points assigned to the individual responses to the items 

in each satisfaction scale. 

Demographic Analysis.Eight questions gathered demographic information about the 

participants in the research study.  Appendix K presents all demographic information.  The 

survey was responded to by 86 call center representatives with 78% being female (n = 67) and 

22% being male (n = 19).  Compared to the population (n = 528) for the research study, the 

percentage of responders to the survey was representative of the population as females (n = 417) 

represented 79% of the population and males (n = 111) represented 21% of the population.  The 

call center representatives come from six locations with 36% from West Virginia (n = 31), 23% 

from Ohio (n = 20), 14% from Louisiana (n = 12), 14% from Oklahoma (n = 12), 7% from 

Indiana (n = 6), and 6% from Texas (n = 5).  Analysis by gender or location was not possible 

because of the small sample size.   

Data showed the participants were equally distributed between the job levels of call 

center representative (50%, n = 43) and senior call center representative (50%, n = 43).  The call 


 

82 

center representatives responding to the survey primarily represented full-time employee status 

(99%, n = 85) with one part-time representative participating (1%, n = 1).  For the race of the call 

center representatives, 74% responded as White/Caucasian (n = 64), 10% as African American 

(n = 9), 5% as Hispanic/Latino (n = 4), 4% as American Indian/Native American (n = 3), 2% as 

Asian (n = 2), 5% as Other (n = 4). 

Based on tenure in the job and tenure with the company, the call center representatives 

consistently responded similar suggesting the representatives hired into the call center job and 

have stayed in the role since the hire date.  Responses to job tenure showed 15% of the 

representatives had less than one year in the job (n = 13), 36% had two to five years in the job (n 

= 31), 24% had six to 10 years in the job (n = 21), 19% had 11 to 15 years in the job (n = 16), 

and 6% had over 15 years in the job (n = 5).  Responses to company tenure showed 15% of the 

representatives had less than one year in the job (n = 13), 36% had two to five years in the job (n 

= 31), 24% had six to 10 years in the job (n = 21), 20% had 11 to 15 years in the job (n = 17), 

and 5% had over 15 years in the job (n = 4). 

Contrary to cited literature in Chapter 2 that suggested call centers attract unskilled 

people, 81% of the call center representatives had education above the high school level (n = 70).  

Responses to education showed 1% of the representatives had a graduate degree (n = 1), 28% 

had a college degree (n = 24), 52% had some college (n = 45), 18% had a high school diploma (n 

= 15), and 1% had less than a high school diploma (n = 1).   

Descriptive Analysis.Descriptive analysis conducted on the sample data described the 

central tendency and variability.  Mean, median, and mode describe the central tendency, 

whereas standard deviation describes the variability of the eight variables of leadership behavior 

styles and the six variables of job satisfaction.  Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics for 


 

83 

leadership behavior styles.  Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics for job satisfaction.   

The leadership behavior styles, as assessed by the MLQ 5x-Short, were measured on a 

Likert-type scale with not at all(0), once in a while (1), sometimes (2), fairly often (3), and 

frequently if not always(4).  Individually, the transformational (idealized influence, inspirational 

motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration) and transactional 

(contingent reward and management by exception-active) leadership behavior styles had 

negatively-skewed distributions, suggesting the perceived presence of these behavior styles in 

the call centers by the call center representatives.  The means of the leadership behavior styles 

further supported the perceived presence as responses were in the range sometimes to fairly 

often.

Individually, the passive (management by exception-passive and laissez-faire) leadership 

behavior styles had positively-skewed distributions, suggesting the perceived and limited 

presence of these behavior styles in the call centers by the call center representatives.  The means 

of the leadership behavior styles further supported the perceived and limited presence as 

responses were in the range of not at all to once in a while.

Job satisfaction variables, as assessed by the JDI/JIG scales, were measured on a 0 to 54 

scale by summing the recoded responses for each scale to determine the individual aspect score.  

Smith et al. (1969) suggested interpretation of the scores with facet satisfaction when the score is 

greater than 32, facet dissatisfaction when the score is less than 22, and neutral on the facet when 

the score is between 22 and 32.  Call center representatives showed satisfaction with supervision 

(M = 43.06, SD = 12.09), coworkers (M = 39.34, SD = 12.86), and job in general (M = 35.53, SD 

= 14.98).  Call center representatives are neutral with work in present job (M = 30.15, SD = 

14.56) and present pay (M = 29.98, SD = 15.08).  Call center representatives showed 


 

85 

dissatisfaction with promotion opportunities (M = 21.14, SD = 17.39). 

Hypotheses Analysis.The testing schema for Hypothesis 1 included the calculation of 

Pearson’s rcorrelation coefficients.  Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between each of the 

eight leadership behavior styles and the six job satisfaction variables.  The .05 significance level 

(p < .05) served as the rejection level for the null hypothesis.  When the analysis warranted 

rejecting the null hypothesis, further analysis determined the direction of correlation as positive 

or negative and the strength of the relationship described in terms of weak, moderate, strong, or 

very strong.Salkind (2003) suggested the strength of variable relationships is weak if the 

correlation coefficient is between r = .20 and r = .40, moderate if between r = .40 and r = .60, 

strong if between r = .60 and r = .80, and very strong if between r = .80 and r = 1.00. 

The testing schema for Hypotheses 2 and 3 included regression analysis.  Hypothesis 2 

explored the effectiveness of the transformational leadership behavior style for predicting job 

satisfaction variables within call centers in the electric utility industry.  Hypothesis 3 explored 

the effectiveness of the leadership behavior style of contingent reward for predicting job 

satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility industry.  Regression analysis for both used a 

probability level of p ≤ .05 as the significance level.  A stepwise selection multiple regression 

procedure developed the prediction models for Hypothesis 2.  Simple linear regression procedure 

developed the prediction models for Hypothesis 3. 

Hypothesis 1.The first hypothesisexamined the relationship between each of the eight 

leadership behavior styles and the six job satisfaction variables.  The analysis determined that 

rejecting the null hypothesis was appropriate for the relationships between the leadership 

behavior styles of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, 

individualized consideration, contingent reward, MBE-P, and laissez-faire and each of the six job 


 

86 

satisfaction variables at the .05 significance level (p < .05) with three exceptions (inspirational 

motivation and present pay (r = .14, p= .20); individualized consideration and present pay (r = 

.18, p = .10); MBE-P and present pay (r = -.15, p = .18)).  Analysis further determined rejecting 

the null hypothesis was not appropriate in the relationships between the leadership behavior 

styles of MBE-A and each of the six job satisfaction variables at the .05 significance level (p < 

.05).  Table 5 presents the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for leadership behavior styles and 

job satisfaction scales.

Hypothesis 2.The second hypothesisexplored the effectiveness of the transformational 

leadership behavior style for predicting job satisfaction variables within call centers in the 

electric utility industry.  Stepwise selection multiple regression procedure developed the 

prediction models for the four aspects of transformational leadership (idealized influence, 

inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration) and the six 

aspects of job satisfaction (present pay, promotion opportunities, work in present job, 

supervision, coworkers, and job in general). 

The first regression model included the dependent or criterion variable present pay using 


 

89 

idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized 

consideration as the independent or predictor variables.  A probability level of p ≤ .05 served for 

accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis when there were no significant predictors.  Using the 

stepwise procedure, intellectual stimulation was found to be the only statistically significant 

predictor of present pay (R = .27, R2 = .07, R2

adj = .06, F (1, 84) = 6.59, p = .01).  The model 

accounts for 7% of the variance in present pay.  The regression model suggested rejecting the 

null hypothesis for intellectual stimulation and not rejecting the null hypothesis for the other 

independent variables.  Table 6 presents the regression coefficients for the model.

Hypothesis 3.The third hypothesisexplored the effectiveness of the leadership behavior 

style of contingent reward for predicting job satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility 

industry.  Single linear regression procedure developed the prediction model for contingent 

reward and the six aspects of job satisfaction (present pay, promotion opportunities, work in 

present job, supervision, coworkers, and job in general). 

The first regression model included the dependent or criterion variable present pay using

contingent reward as the independent or predictor variable.  A probability level of p ≤ .05 served 

for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis when there were no significant predictors.  

Contingent reward was found to be statistically significant predictor of present pay (R = .23, R2 

= .05, R2

adj = .04, F (1, 84) = 4.49, p = .04).  The model accounts for 5% of the variance of 

present pay.  The regression model suggested rejecting the null hypothesis for contingent

The third regression model included the dependent variable work in present job using 

contingent reward as the independent variable.  A probability level of p≤ .05 served for

The fourth regression model developed for the research study used the dependent variable 

supervision and contingent reward as the independent variable.  A probability level of p≤ .05 

served for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis when there were no significant predictors.  

Contingent reward was found to be statistically significant predictor of supervision (R = .70, R2 

= .50, R2

adj = .49, F (1, 84) = 81.79, p = .00).  The model accounts for 50% of the variance in 

supervision.  The regression model suggested rejecting the null hypothesis for contingent 

reward.  Table 15 presents the regression coefficients for the model. 

The fifth regression model included the dependent variable coworkers using contingent 

reward as the independent variable.  A probability level of p≤ .05 served for accepting or 

rejecting the null hypothesis when there were no significant predictors.  Contingent reward was 


 

95 

found to be statistically significant predictor of coworkers (R = .33, R2 = .11, R2

adj = .10, F (1, 

84) = 10.10, p = .00).  The model accounts for 11% of the variance in coworkers.  The regression 

model suggested rejecting the null hypothesis for contingent reward.  Table 16 presents the 

regression coefficients for the model.

The sixth regression model developed for the research study used the dependent variable 

job in general and contingent reward as the independent variable.  A probability level of p≤ .05 

served for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis when there were no significant predictors.  

Contingent reward was found to be statistically significant predictor of job in general (R = .44,R2

Findings 

Demographic Analysis.Frequency analysis provided summary information on the 

demographics of the sample of call center representatives participating in the research study.  

Participation in the research study included 86-call center representative with a 4:1 ratio of 

females to males indicative of the pool of employees within the six call centers.  Call center 

representatives tend to hire into the call centers and remain in the call center position as both job 

tenure and company tenure were similar.  Education beyond a high school diploma was 

significant as 81% of the participating call center representatives had either some college 

education or a degree.  The presence of representatives with some college education or a degree 

is indicative of changing call center norms contrary to cited literature in Chapter 2. 

Descriptive Analysis.Descriptive analysis provided understanding of central tendency 

and variability of the responses received from the participating call center representatives.  From 


 

97 

the perspective of the leadership behavior styles, transformational and transactional leadership 

existed within the call centers based on the mean responses of sometimes to fairly often.  

Idealized influence and contingent reward were the highest based on analysis of the means of the 

sample.  Passive leadership behavior styles existed but the use of such behavior styles is limited 

based on the mean responses of not at all to once in a while.   

The research study measured job satisfaction using a facet approach and an overall 

approach.  The facet approach measured satisfaction of the call center representatives in the areas 

of present pay, promotion opportunities, work in present job, supervision, and coworkers.  The 

call center representatives showed satisfaction with supervision and coworkers while showing 

dissatisfaction with promotion opportunities.  The participating call center representatives were 

neutral on the facets of work in present job and present pay.  Using the job in general variable, 

call center representatives responded as satisfied with the job in the call centers. 

Hypotheses Analysis.Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between each of the eight 

leadership behavior styles and the six job satisfaction variables.  The analysis showed a positive 

and significant relationship existed between the six job satisfaction aspects and the leadership 

behavior styles of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, 

individualized consideration, and contingent reward.  Two exceptions existed showing a positive 

but not significant relationship between present pay and intellectual stimulation and between 

present pay and individualized consideration.  A negative and significant relationship existed 

between the six job satisfaction aspects and the leadership styles of MBE-P and laissez-faire.  

One exception existed showing a negative but not significant relationship between present pay 

and MBE-P.  No relationship existed between job satisfaction and MBE-A.  

Hypothesis 2 explored the effectiveness of the transformational leadership behavior style 


 

98 

for predicting job satisfaction variables within call centers in the electric utility industry.  The 

leadership behavior aspect of intellectual stimulation was a predictor of satisfaction with present 

pay.  Idealized influence was a predictor of satisfaction with promotion opportunities, work in 

the present job, coworkers, and job in general.  Idealized influence and individualized 

consideration are predictors of satisfaction with supervision. 

Hypothesis 3 explored the effectiveness of the leadership behavior style of contingent 

reward for predicting job satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility industry.  The 

leadership behavior style contingent reward was a predictor of all six job satisfaction aspects 

considered in the research study. 

Conclusion 

The research study assessed the relationship of supervisory leadership behavior styles to 

employee job satisfaction in six call centers serving the electric utility industry in the United 

States.  The study examined varying leadership behavior styles of supervisors as perceived by 

call center representatives and facet and overall job satisfaction of call center representatives.  

The study concluded by identifying the leadership behavior styles conducive to promoting job 

satisfaction of call center representatives.  Chapter 5 provides a discussion of the findings, 

implications, conclusions, and recommendations for future research.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Call centers are a primary means for managing customer experiences (Ellis & Taylor, 

2006).  The focus in call centers is on multiple employees responding to customer needs in 

consistent and effective manner.  Call center representatives are the first point of contact and 

needenough training and ability to handle the business customers wish to transact with a 

company.  With high turnover rates in call centers, the responsiveness to customer needs 

requiresorganizational focus on employees to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.  

Management is fundamental to employee job satisfaction, thus helping the organization achieve 

customer satisfaction (Kantsperger & Kunz, 2005; Little & Dean, 2006).  The nature of call 

centers puts a focus on speed and accuracy forcing call center managers and supervisors to look 

at quantitative imperatives and results to the detriment of employee relationships (Brannan 

2005).  Chapter 5 describes the research study process, findings and interpretations, 

recommendations, limitations, and recommendations for further research. 

Research Study Process 

The general problem is call centers experience high turnover rates, increasing 

organization costs and reducing service quality of internal and external customer interactions 

(Cleveland & Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & Mukherjee, 2004; Townsend, 2007).  Gorjup, 

Valverde, and Ryan (2008) and Harney and Jordan (2008) suggested lower job satisfaction of 

call center representatives may contribute to turnover in call centers.  Holdsworth and Cartwright 

(2003) highlighted call center representatives have lower job satisfaction than employees in the 

general working population.  The discoveries of their study showed the causes of lower job 

satisfaction have roots in the lack of personal growth, low degree of decision-making, limited job 

flexibility, and infrequent supervision-employee interaction. 


 

100 

The correlational research study examined the views of call center representatives 

exploringhow leadership behaviors as demonstrated by call center supervisors effectively 

motivated and developed work environments supportive of job satisfaction.  The population was 

employees in call centers in the electric utility industry in the United States.  The goal of the 

study was to discover information about leadership behaviors and job satisfaction within call 

centers available for developing and improving particular leadership behaviors of supervisors 

that influence job satisfaction of call center representatives. 

A composite electronic survey assessed the views of call center representatives about 

leadership behavior styles of supervisors and job satisfaction variables.  The composite survey 

included the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, Job Descriptive Index scale, Job In General 

scale, and demographic items (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Smith et al., 1969).  The survey 

respondents provided the data to assess possible relationships between leadership behavior styles 

and job satisfaction using multiple correlation and regression analysis. 

Predictive variables as demonstrated by the call center supervisors included the styles of 

leadership as defined by Bass and Avolio’s (1990, 1993) model of full range leadership (FRL).  

The FRL model includes eight leadership behavior styles: (a) idealized influence, (b) 

inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual stimulation, (d) individualized consideration, (e) 

contingent reward, (f) management by exception-active (MBE-A), (g) management by 

exception-passive (MBE-P), and (h) laissez-faire.  Criterion variables influencing call center 

representatives’ job satisfaction included job satisfaction variables as defined by Smith et al. 

(1969) in their research to develop the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job In General (JIG) 

scales: (a) work in present job, (b) present pay, (c) promotion opportunities, (d) supervision, (e) 

coworkers, and (f) job in general. 


 

101 

The study addressed three guiding questions focused on the relationship between the job 

satisfaction variables and each of the eight leadership behavior styles, the likelihood the 

transformational leadership behavior style predicted job satisfaction, and the likelihood the 

contingent reward leadership behavior style predicted job satisfaction.  The hypotheses of the 

research study provided the basis to evaluate leadership behavior styles demonstrated by call 

center supervisors and job satisfaction of call center representatives.  Hypothesis 1 evaluated the 

existence of relationships between job satisfaction of call center representatives and each of the 

eight leadership behavior styles as displayed by supervisors in call centers in the electric utility 

industry.  Hypothesis 2 evaluated the possibility of predicting job satisfaction of call center 

representatives in the electric utility industry with the leadership behavior style perceived as 

transformational.  Hypothesis 3 evaluated the possibility of predicting job satisfaction of call 

center representatives in the electric utility industry with the leadership behavior style perceived 

as contingent reward. 

Findings and Interpretations 

Demographic Analysis.The research study assessed the leadership behavior styles as 

exhibited by supervisors and examined the relationship between leadership behavior styles and 

job satisfaction from the perspective of call center representatives in the electric utility industry.  

Demographic information collected during the study included call center location, job tenure, job 

level, education, company tenure, race, gender, and employment status, as suggested by Balzer et 

al. (2000).  The study did not explore differences based on demographics.   

The study revealed call center representatives had education above the high school level 

with a significant number of respondents having either some college or college degrees.  The 

position of call center representatives typically attracts unskilled people who perform routine 


 

102 

tasks (Rose & Wright, 2005).  With the increasedneed of call centers in organizations, call center 

leaders need to hire people who display characteristics of thoroughness, knowledgeableness, 

readiness, courtesy, professionalism, and attentiveness in their interactions with customers 

(Froehle, 2006; Ojha & Kasturi, 2005; Sieben et al., 2009).  People skilled in these 

characteristicshelp ensure customer satisfaction with the interactions with the organizations. 

Descriptive Analysis.The respondents’ (n = 86) mean scores for level of perceived 

leadership behavior styles of transformational and transactional leadership were between 

sometimes and fairly often on the Likert-type scale used in the survey.  Individually, the 

transformational (idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and 

individualized consideration) and transactional (contingent reward and MBE-A) leadership 

behavior styles had negatively-skewed distributions, suggesting the perceived presence of these 

behavior styles in the call centers by the call center representatives.  The mean scores of the 

leadership behavior styles further supported the perceived presence of contingent reward and 

inspirational motivation as the predominant and significant leadership behavior styles with 

idealized influence, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation styles as secondary 

and significant behavior styles.   

Transformational leadership describesan engagement between leaders and followers 

toward completing common goals with mutual benefits.  Transformational leadership results in 

mutual motivation between leaders and followers to achieve high levels of success in the pursuit 

of collective goals (Burns, 1978).  The mutual motivation between leaders and followers results 

in higher standards of moral responsibility and keener awareness of needs, values, and purposes 

on individual, leader, and organizational levels.  Key aspects of transformational leadership are 

the exchange and motivating relationship of leaders and followers, the proactive and inclusive 


 

103 

view toward organizational issues, the development of learning opportunities, and the 

encouragement of emotional bonds uniting leaders and followers (Burns, 1978). 

Transactional leadership involves a transactional exchange.  An exchange occurs with 

something valued by the follower for something valued by the leader.  In a typical work 

environment, a follower exchanges his or her performance of tasks for the leader paying a wage 

for time worked.  Transactional leadership focuses on managing work and followers, 

accomplishing work through employees with little regard for the employee other than satisfying 

lower-level needs as suggested by Maslow’s (1987, 2000a) hierarchy of needs (Burns, 1978).   

The presence of both transformational and transactional leadership in the call centers 

explains the need for leaders capable of motivating a changing workforce.  The presence of the 

leadership behaviors contingent reward and management by exception-active align with the 

nature of the work environment in call centers.  The work environment is transactional with 

multiple employees responding to customer needs in a prescribed and order-driven manner (Rose 

& Wright, 2005).  The research study revealed a change in the educational background of call 

center representatives going from unskilled people with little post-high school education to 

skilled people with college degrees.  “Educated” call center representatives need different 

motivation, moving beyond satisfying lower-level physiological, safety, and social needs to 

satisfying the higher-level needs of esteem and self-actualization (Page & Vella-Brodrick, 2009).   

Individually, the passive (MBE-P and laissez-faire) leadership behavior styles had 

positively-skewed distributions, suggesting the perceived and limited presence of these behavior 

styles in the call centers by the call center representatives.  The mean scores of the passive 

leadership behavior styles further supported the perceived and limited presence as responses 

were in the range of not at all to once in a while on the Likert-type scales used in the surveys.   


 

104 

Passive leadership involves little interaction between leaders and followers, 

demonstratedin the avoidance or absence of leadership, and exhibited in minimal to no impact in 

motivating employees (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 

2006).  Passive leaders neglect supervisory and managerial responsibilities, including a lack of 

employee attention and guidance and inattentiveness to productivity, task completion, and goal 

achievement (Barbuto, 2005). 

Job satisfaction is an emotional, attitudinal, or experiential attachment to a job, 

developing from three perspectives of evaluation, cognition, and affection (Biggs & Swailes, 

2006; Brown & Lam, 2008; Kumar, Bakhshi, & Rani, 2009; Staw & Cohen-Charash, 2005).  

Two general approaches exist for understanding job satisfaction.  The global approach views job 

satisfaction as a single belief toward the job resulting in an evaluation of the overall job.  The 

facet approach assesses job satisfaction on the different aspects of a job eliciting perceptional and 

affective reactions.   

The research study explored the two approaches to understanding call center job.  Call 

center representatives showed satisfaction with supervision, coworkers, and job in general.  Call 

center representatives showing satisfaction with supervision supports past research concluding 

employees evaluate supervision using the criteria of employee consideration, employee 

inclusiveness, and relationship-building behaviors (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).  Call 

center representatives showing satisfaction with coworkers supports the premise that employees 

seek positive relationships with coworkers strengthening individual and group interactions 

(Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).   

Call center representatives wereneutral with work in present job and present pay.  Call 

center representatives showed neutrality on work in present job because of the transactional 


 

105 

nature of the work in call centers.  Employees evaluate the work itself by assessing opportunities 

for autonomy, creativity, job enrichment, job complexity, knowledge acquisition, responsibility, 

and task variety (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).  These opportunities are limited for call 

center representatives in the call center environment.   

Call center representatives show neutrality on present pay.  Employees evaluated actual 

compensation versus expected compensation, looking for congruency of the two factors (Fichter 

& Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).  Local economies and markets drive compensationin call centers, 

as in any organization.  To remain the viable option for the customer interface of organizations, 

call centers should consider pay or compensation to be suitable with local job markets or risk 

outsourcing to third-party call center vendors.  

Call center representatives showed dissatisfaction with promotion opportunities.  

Promotion opportunities are evaluated from the fairness in policies and administration of 

promotions within an organization (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010; Yang, 2009).  Dissatisfaction is not 

surprising becauselimited opportunities exist in call centers, as the organizational structure does 

not afford an overabundance of positions beyond the entry-level position of the call center 

representatives.  With the extended job tenure and company tenure identified by the research 

study, call center representatives stay in the call center environment.  High turnover in call 

centers could suggest desire of call center representatives to explore opportunities outside the 

organization to gain desired promotion opportunities to meet self-esteem and self-actualization 

needs (Fichter & Cipolla, 2010). 

Hypotheses Analysis.Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between the eight 

leadership behavior styles and the six job satisfaction variables.  From the analysis of research 

data, three conclusions are clearabout the relationships.  Positive and significant relationships 


 

106 

existed between the leadership behavior styles of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, 

intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and contingent reward and each of the six 

job satisfaction variables.  Negative and significant relationships existed between MBE-P, 

laissez-faire, and each of the six job satisfaction variables.  No significant relationships existed 

between MBE-A and the job satisfaction variables.  Three exceptions to these conclusions 

included no significant relationship between inspirational motivation and present pay, 

individualized consideration and present pay, and MBE-P and present pay.  Figure 1 presents a 

graphic of the positive relationships between the leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction 

variables.  Figure 2 presents a graphic of the negative relationships between the leadership 

behavior styles and job satisfaction variables. 

Hypothesis 2 evaluated the possibility of predicting job satisfaction of call center 

representatives in the electric utility industry with the leadership behavior style perceived as 

transformational.  Stepwise selection multiple regression procedure developed the prediction 

models for the four aspects of transformational leadership and the six aspects of job satisfaction.  

The four aspects of transformational leadership are idealized influence, inspirational motivation, 

intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration.  The six aspects of job satisfaction are 

present pay, promotion opportunities, work in present job, supervision, coworkers, and job in 

general. 

Intellectual stimulation was the statistically significant predictor of the job satisfaction 

variable present pay.  The leader using intellectual stimulation consistently challenges followers 

to think critically in search of solutions and learning by stepping outside the typical lines of 

organizational thinking (Barbuto, Fritz, Matkin, & Marx, 2007).  Employees often have little 

understanding of how an organization decides the compensation for work in various positions.  


 

107 

Employees need assistance bringing together the understanding of actual compensation and 

expected compensation.  Supervisors within call centers provide help understanding the 

knowledge gaps of call center representatives about compensation.

Figure 2.Negative relationships between leadership behaviors styles and job satisfaction 

variables. 

Idealized influence was the statistically significant predictor of the job satisfaction 

variables promotion opportunities, work in present job, coworkers, and job in general.  As a 

leader becomes the symbol of vision for followers, he or she becomes the leader with idealized 

influence (Barbuto et al., 2007).  Idealized influence occurs when leaders can see and 

communicate organizational strategies transformational for the organization and followers.  The 

leader serves as a mediator in support of shared visions and aligned goals between the employee 

and organization (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1993; Bass & Riggio, 2006).  

Supervisors often facilitate and mediate as call center representatives strive to understand their 


 

109 

role in the organizational process and strategies and strive to balance needs of customers and 

management. 

Idealized influence and individual consideration werethe statistically significant 

predictors of the job satisfaction variable supervision.  Supervisors act in a dual role of service in 

organizations—serving the needs of employees and the needs of management and the 

organization.  Whereas idealized influence focuses on transforming communication of strategies 

for the organization and followers, individual consideration provides opportunities of coaching 

and mentoring to followers, guiding followers in developmental growth (Avolio, 1999; Bass & 

Avolio, 1990).  Individual consideration focuses on developing strong relationships with 

followers, built on trust to work collectively toward individual and collective goals (Avolio, 

1999; Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990, 1994; Bass & Riggio, 2006; Barbuto et al., 2007).  At 

the core of individual consideration is the means to communicate effectively. 

Hypothesis 3 evaluated the possibility of predicting job satisfaction of call center 

representatives in the electric utility industry with the leadership behavior style perceived as 

contingent reward.  A single linear regression procedure developed the prediction models for 

contingent reward leadership and the six aspects of job satisfaction (present pay, promotion 

opportunities, work in present job, supervision, coworkers, and job in general).  Contingent 

reward wasa statistically significant predictor of all job satisfaction variables used in the research 

study. 

Contingent reward is a practical method of motivation as the employees decide the 

method for task accomplishment and progress measurement in return for open recognition of 

goal accomplishment (Avolio, 1999).  The leader and follower agree on the task or goal needing 

completed and the reward for accomplishing the task or goal.  Contingent reward can be an 


 

110 

effective leadership style except the leader will receive only the agreed-upon results or efforts 

with assigning the task or goal.   

Contingent reward leadership is suitable for the call center environment due the fast-

paced and transaction-oriented nature driven by performance goals for call handling and 

transaction processing.  Call center representatives experience high levels of performance 

scrutiny and monitoring because of technology advancements (Barnes, 2007; Mahesh & Kasturi, 

2006; Siong et al., 2006; Sprigg & Jackson, 2006).  Technology creates the means for frequent 

and objective measurement of employee performance and an environment intrusive and 

controlling of employee work and actions (Cartwright, 2003; Barnes, 2007; Reynolds et al., 

2003).   

One of the statistics explored in the regression procedures used in Hypotheses 2 and 3 

was the percent of variation in the job satisfaction variables explained by the leadership behavior 

styles.  For Hypothesis 2, the range of the percent of variation in the job satisfaction variables 

explained by the transformational leadership aspects was 7% to 65%.  For Hypothesis 3, the 

range of percent of variation in the job satisfaction variables explained by contingent reward was 

5% to 50%.   

Whenthe percent of variation is low, other factors are acting on job satisfaction not 

explained by the leadership behavior styles that would require more study to explain.  Leadership 

behavior style was part of the influence but wasnot the sole influence of job satisfaction.  Based 

on the comparison of the ranges of Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3, the aspects of 

transformational leadership explained more of the variation in job satisfaction than contingent 

reward.  

 

 


 

Recommendations 

111 

The research study addressed three questions centering on the relationship between job 

satisfaction and leadership behavior styles, the likelihood of transformational leadership 

predicting job satisfaction, and the likelihood of contingent reward leadership predicting job 

satisfaction within call centers within the electric utility industry.  Relationships existed between 

leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction.  Transformational leadership predicted job 

satisfaction.  Contingent reward predicted job satisfaction.  Transformational leadership 

wasslightly better at predicting job satisfaction over contingent reward.   

With such results, a recommendation is forcall center management create work 

environments supportive of transformational leadership.  Another recommendation is for call 

center management develop supervisors with skills necessary and supportive of a transforming 

work environment capable of fostering job satisfaction of call center representatives.  

Transformational leaders inspire followers to see their efforts and work within the organizational 

structure as part of the larger picture or vision.  Leaders and followers seeing the larger picture or 

vision affords opportunities for goal accomplishment not thought possible (Avolio, 1999; Bass & 

Avolio, 1990). 

Leaders define and shape followers’ reality of work.  Through the transformational 

process, leaders decide the vision, share the vision, and support the vision by providing 

constructive feedback, inspiration for extra effort in work performance, and encouragement to 

solve problems creatively—happening in a manner that progresses employee motivation, job 

satisfaction, and organization commitment (Ashill et al., 2009; George et al., 2007). 

Turnover in the call center industry is high when compared to other industries (Cleveland 

& Mayben, 1997; Malhotra & Mukherjee, 2004; Townsend, 2007).  Turnover produces 


 

112 

significant organizational costs for all industries including separation costs, learning costs, and 

acquisition costs (Udechukwu, 2009).  The study provides industry-specific information on job 

satisfaction having the potential to reduce turnover and related costs. The treatment of employees 

by leaders within organizations influences reasonsfor employee turnover (Udechukwu, 2009).  

The positive impact of leaders contributes to satisfied employees who identify with the 

organization and show a commitment to stay with the organization as realized in increased 

employee performance and productivity.  The negative impact of leaders contributes to employee 

dissatisfaction as showed in decreased organizational identification, commitment, performance, 

and productivity. 

The information from the study provides insight into what influences job satisfaction for 

call center representatives from the leadership behavior perspective.  Call center leaders should 

develop an organizational environment nurturing of job satisfaction and organizational 

commitment (Little & Dean, 2006; McKeown, 2009; Whitt, 2006).  Call center leaders should 

further create training and personal development programs to change and support behaviors of 

supervisors thatnurture the job satisfaction of call center representatives and customer 

satisfaction (Kirkbride, 2006). 

Study Limitations 

The research study had several limitations.  Results of the research study included data 

gathered from only those respondents who voluntarily agreed to participate.  Participation by call 

center representatives in the study was strictly voluntary.  Lack of response potentially increases 

sample bias and statistical errors by excluding data from individuals not participating.  The 

survey respondents represented those most interested in the study and not necessarily of the 

underlying population.  Nonresponse degrades the validity of the survey and limits the 


 

113 

generalizability, affecting the degree that conclusions ascribe to the target population (Rogelberg 

& Luong, 1998).  Nonresponse bias occurs when respondent and non-respondent differences 

affect variable representation, concluding the volunteer nature of participation may unknowingly 

influence the research study results (Rogelberg & Luong, 1998). 

The sampleof the research study incorporated call center representatives from six call 

centers in one organization.  Generalizing the results beyond this specific call center organization 

is questionable.  Ferguson (2004) noted the goal of research is linking the knowledge engendered 

in a study to the population.  Using one call center organization limited the generalizability of the 

research study findings. 

The survey solicited views of respondents about leadership behavior displayed by 

supervisors and their job satisfaction.  With self-reporting, the potential for false reporting is a 

limitation for the construct validity of the study.  Kant (1949) suggested perceptions are 

subjective and may differ from person to person and from time to time.  Respondents will assess 

the behavior of a supervisor based on the interactions between the two individuals influenced by 

the reality perception of the respondents.   

Another aspect of self-reporting is the inability to determine respondent cognitive or 

emotional mood when completing the survey.  An individual with a negative mood 

predisposition has a tendency to rate others with the lower level of negative mood predisposition 

(Fried, Levy, Ben-David, Tiegs, & Avital, 2000).  A longitudinal survey in contrast to a cross-

section survey design allows evaluations at different times without mitigating completely the 

effects of negative mood predisposition (Schneider, Ashworth, Higgs, & Carr, 1996).  A cross-

sectional survey, as used in the study, is oriented to a point of time and measures current 

practices, beliefs, and attitudes.  Payne (1993) suggested the act of completing a survey shows a 


 

114 

behavior based on beliefs, attitudes, and feelings reflective of the time of completing the survey.  

The use of theory-based instruments limited the participants’assessment of variables in 

the research study.  Aspects of leadership werelimited to those describe in the construct of the 

MLQ Form 5x-Short.  Job satisfaction was limited to those aspects of job satisfaction recognized 

within the construction of the JDI and JIG instruments.  Using existing theories limited 

interpretation of the data to those specific leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction aspects.   

Recommendations for Future Research 

The results of the research study suggested statistically significant relationships between 

leadership behavior styles of supervisors and job satisfaction of call center representatives.  

Future research and study mightextend and expand the findings of the study.  The following 

section outlines six recommendations for future research and study. 

A first recommendation is to repeat the research study using a larger sample of call center 

representatives.  The research study used a convenience sample of one call center organization 

with six call center locations.  Although the sample met statistical significance requirements, a 

larger sample would verify the generalizability to the larger population of call centers in the 

electric utility industry.  A larger sample would further provide justification and consistency for 

creating leadership development training appropriate for call centers in the electric utility 

industry. 

The research study identified relationships exist between leadership behavior styles and 

job satisfaction within call centers.  A second recommendation is to explore the relationship 

between perceived leadership behaviors of supervisors and job satisfaction of call center 

representatives by extending the research into other call centers within the electric utility 

industry to discover the extent and consistency of the perceptions.  Such an investigation 


 

115 

couldprovide added evidence to support the inference of the relationship between leadership 

behavior and job satisfaction. 

The survey used for the research study collected demographic information including call 

center location, job tenure, education, company tenure, race, gender, and employment status.  

The research study did not pursue investigating the effects of the demographic information of the 

responders.  A third recommendation is to examine the influence of demographic differences on 

the perceptions of leadership behavior styles and job satisfaction.  The investigation 

couldprovide information to call center organizations and leaders for developing leadership 

development programs conducive to the diversity of call center employees and supportive of the 

needs of different demographic groups.   

The research study focused on the perspective of supervision and call center 

representative interaction with no investigation of other leader-employee interactions occurring 

within the call center environment.  A fourth recommendation is to examine the manager and 

supervisor interaction using the same composite survey.  The investigation might clarify if the 

leadership behavior styles of managers have a similar influence on job satisfaction of 

supervisors.  The investigation could serve to discover consistency of results throughout the call 

center organization and between all levels of call center staff. 

The focus of the research study was from the view of the call center representatives on 

the leadership behavior style of supervisors.  A fifth recommendation is to correlate the 

perception of leadership behavior style of supervisors by call center representatives with the self-

perception of leadership behavior styles by supervisors.  Eichinger and Lombardo (2003) noted 

highly effective leaders see themselves either as others do or underestimate their abilities.   

The research study found a relationship between leadership behavior style and job 


 

116 

satisfaction within call centers in the electric utility industry without determining causes for the 

relationship.  A sixth recommendation is to extend the quantitative design into a mixed-methods 

design to facilitate understanding the research problem and to clarify and explicate the 

quantitative findings of the study.     

Summary and Conclusion 

Calls centers are unique work environments requiring employees to demonstrate proven 

abilities to survive fast-paced and transaction-driveninteractions with customers of organizations.  

Call centers must balance quantity with quality, customer satisfaction with employee 

satisfaction, and employee scrutiny with employee autonomy.  Leaders at all levels of the call 

center organization must manage the customer experience to drive customer satisfaction and 

customer retention.  Employee job satisfaction is a major cause driving and achieving customer 

satisfaction.  Leadership is fundamental to employee job satisfaction, aiding the organization to 

achieve customer satisfaction. 

Leaders influence human behavior, motivation, and job satisfaction by manipulating the 

environment in a manner that supports employee motivation toward aligning personal goals with 

organization goals (Maslow, 2000c).  Organizational leadership recognizes satisfaction at work 

often occurs when employees feel motivation to fulfill esteem and self-actualization.  Job 

satisfaction is a result of individuals’ conscious and unconscious reactions in the workplace to 

physical psychological, social, and cognitive stimuli.  The contentment of human needs, the 

impetus of motivators, the realization of rewards, and the fulfillment of core job elements 

contribute to employee job satisfaction in organizations (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1980; 

Herzberg et al., 1993; Locke & Latham, 2004; Maslow, 1987, 2000a). 

This quantitative correlational research study evaluated the relationships of supervisory 


 

117 

leadership behavior styles to employee job satisfaction in six call centers serving the electric 

utility industry in the United States.  Chapter 5 concludes the journey to evaluate the 

relationshipsarriving at four conclusions.  Relationships existed between the leadership behavior 

styles of supervisors and the job satisfaction of call center representatives that if capitalized upon 

would help call centers retain good employees.  Transformational leadership predicted job 

satisfaction of call center representatives.  Contingent reward leadership predicted job 

satisfaction of call center representatives.  Final analysis concluded transformation leadership 

was a better predictor of job satisfaction of call center representatives than contingent reward.  

Developing call center supervisors as transformational leaders demonstrating idealized influence, 

inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualizedwill serve to foster job 

satisfaction of call center representatives in the electric utility industry.
