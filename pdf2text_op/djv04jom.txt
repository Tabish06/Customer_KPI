Abstract

This paper examines the effects of integration practices on time-based performance and on overall ﬁrm performance
(ﬁnancial and market share). Integration practices are grouped into two categories: (1) external strategic design integration,
which reaches across ﬁrm boundaries to involve suppliers and customers and (2) internal design-process integration, which
comprises more tactically oriented, integration practices that match design requirements and process capabilities. First,
regression results show that both internal and external integration are related to time-based performance, which in turn is related
to ﬁrm performance. Thus, two indirect routes to ﬁrm performance are identiﬁed. Second, hierarchical regression reveals that
integration directly affects ﬁrm performance even after time-based performance is accounted for. Finally, we found that the
interaction of internal and external integration is signiﬁcantly related to both market share and ﬁnancial performance (after
controlling for all other effects). This latter result suggests that the joint use of external and internal integration practices has a
synergistic effect on ﬁrm performance.

Time-based competition has received much atten-

concentrated on increasing product development
and launch speeds, while others have focused on
improving manufacturing, delivery, and/or customer
response times. However, evidence for the pervasive
competitive value of time-based strategies comes
primarily from case studies, anecdotal evidence, and
management impressions (Stalk, 1988; Bower and

integration);

Our goal is to examine relationships among: (1)
(grouped into internal versus
speciﬁc practices
external
time-based performance
(the intermediate performance outcome); and (3)
overall ﬁrm performance (the ﬁnal performance
outcome). Other researchers have examined parts of
this model. For example, Vickery et al. (1995, 1997)
and Narasimhan and Jayaram (1998) investigated the
effects of time-based performance on overall ﬁrm
performance, while Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995) and
Hartley et al. (1997) examined the effects of new
product development (NPD) practices on innovation
lead-time. However, we are unaware of research that
incorporates all three parts while at the same time
considering direct versus indirect effects as well as
interaction effects.

The practices we consider naturally fall into two
broad categories: (1) strategic design integration
practices (or external integration) and (2) design-
process integration practices (or internal integra-
tion). ‘Strategic design integration’ is an index
consisting of (1) supplier partnerships, (2) supplier
development, and (3) closer customer relationships.
Taken together, these practices effectively integrate a
ﬁrm’s suppliers and customers into a synergistic
network that facilitates product design and develop-
ment activities (hence the nomenclature, strategic
design integration). The remaining practices focus
on spanning the internal boundary between design
engineering and manufacturing to achieve an index
called ‘design-process integration’: (1) concurrent
engineering, (2) design for manufacturability, (3)
standardization, and (4) computer-aided design/
computer-aided
(CAD/CAM).
Many other studies have focused on similar NPD
practices and their
to time-based
performance outcomes, ‘time-to-market’ in particu-
lar (Millson et al., 1992; Eisenhardt and Tabrizi,
1995; Hartley et al., 1997). However, few have
considered multiple outcomes, results have been
mixed, and no clear-cut managerial guidelines have
emerged.

relationships

In this study, we not only investigate the effects of
integration practices on ‘time-to-market’ but also on
the overall product delivery cycle (‘time-to-product’)
and on suppliers’ responsiveness to their OEM
customers. These we consider intermediate perfor-
mance outcomes; our ﬁnal overall performance
outcomes are market share and ﬁnancial performance.
An important question is whether either strategic
design integration or design-process integration affect
overall ﬁrm performance outcomes after controlling
for the intermediate time-based outcomes (see Fig. 1).
Another important question is what role the interac-
tion of the two integration constructs plays.

The study focuses on the automotive supply
industry: the sampling frame comprises the top 150
independently owned ﬁrst tier suppliers to General
Motors, Ford, and Chrysler (now DaimlerChrysler).
Our ﬁnal sample of 57 ﬁrms had a mean market share
of 24.7, and 83.9% of their sales were to North
American OEMs. This highly competitive industry
segment encompasses a wide variety of products (e.g.,
stamped metal, seating systems, and steering assem-
blies) and a diversity of processes
(job shop,
manufacturing cell, continuous ﬂow, etc.). The
broader automobile industry (in which this segment
plays a critical role) has provided the context for many
advances in time-based performance over the past two
decades, making it an ideal candidate for study.

integration and internal

The paper is organized as follows. First, we develop
our external
integration
constructs from relevant literature and explore their
associations with time-to-market, time-to-product and
customer responsiveness. Research hypotheses link-
ing these integration practices,
time-based perfor-
mance, and ﬁrm performance are then presented and
discussed. The sample is described and measurement
issues are addressed. Hierarchical regression is used
for hypotheses testing. Finally, the results of the study
and their potential managerial
implications are
examined.

high-level coordination between a ﬁrm and its
suppliers and customers to effectively support product
design and development activities. The ‘index-like’
construct consists of three core items (discussed
individually below): supplier development, supplier
partnerships, and closer customer relationships. Note
that this construct: (1) is strategic since its focus is on
relationship building with external parties for the
purposes of competitive advantage and (2) explicitly
encompasses the integration of both suppliers and
customers into the innovation process. Recently,
Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) demonstrated that a
strategy that focuses simultaneously on supplier and
customer integration (i.e., a broad ‘‘arc’’ of integra-
tion) is associated with performance improvements,
conﬁrming the
integrating both
suppliers and customers in product development
efforts (see also, e.g., Smith and Reinertsen, 1998).

importance of

Firms recognize that the performance of suppliers’
products and the performance of their own products
are inextricably linked. Supplier development is a key
approach for facilitating supplier performance and
capability improvements. Supplier development activ-

ities include providing feedback from performance
evaluation, site visits by buying ﬁrm personnel, raising
performance expectations, instituting a certiﬁcation
program, and the training/education of the supplier’s
personnel (Krause and Ellram, 1997).

Supplier partnering moves beyond supplier devel-
opment activities and treats the supplier as a strategic
collaborator. Supplier partnering seeks to bring all
participants in the product life cycle into the process
early on so that each can provide input to the other’s
processes. Thus, the partnership often entails early
supplier involvement in product design and/or access
to superior supplier technological capabilities (see
e.g., Narasimhan and Das, 1998). Close integration
ensures unity of effort and responsiveness.

Closer customer relationships can be viewed as the
downstream counterpart
to supplier development/
partnership. Closer customer relationships depend
on proactively determining customer requirements
and committing to meet those requirements (Powell,
1995), and thus it becomes increasingly difﬁcult for
competitors
to intervene (Stank et al., 1999).
Drickhamer (2002) found that ﬁrms who excelled in


560

total value chain integration emphasized building
collaborative relationships with customers; this in turn
improved timely responsiveness. Insights from cus-
tomers also provide key inputs to the innovation
process (e.g., Robins and Atuahene-Gima, 2003).

1.2. Design-process (internal) integration:
components

Our internal design-process integration construct
encompasses practices concerned with matching
design requirements and process capabilities (i.e.,
product-process integration). These practices integrate
manufacturing expertise with design engineering
activities to ensure a seamless transition from drawing
board to factory ﬂoor. Internal integration cannot be
fully achieved by the isolated use of boundary-
spanning practices, but instead requires the ‘bundling’
of management tools with technology tools such as
CAD and CAM (see e.g., Smith and Reinertsen,
1998).

The ﬁrst component

is concurrent engineering
(CE). CE overlaps product and process design
activities to achieve a simultaneous development
process. Conventional NPD programs execute concept
exploration, product design, testing, and production
serially and typically each activity is controlled by one
function at a time (e.g., marketing, manufacturing). In
CE, multiple aspects are simultaneously attacked and
activities overlap. Sometimes, CE focuses only on
manufacturability (e.g., ease of assembly); other
programs examine the effects of product design
decisions on competitive issues and product life-cycle
considerations (McGrath, 1992; Trygg, 1993; Swink,
1998).

Another key-integrating tool is design for manu-
facturability (DFM), which is concerned with facil-
itating the quick transfer of designs to production.
DFM may encompass product design simpliﬁcation,
parts minimization, the simpliﬁcation of fasteners, and
design for assembly techniques. DFM’s goal is to
closely coordinate design with manufacturing cap-
abilities in order to maximize manufacturing perfor-
mance.

Standardization refers to the use of standard
procedures, materials, parts, and/or processes for
designing and manufacturing a product. It inhibits a
‘‘reinventing the wheel’’ syndrome: engineers must

either standardize or else provide justiﬁcation for
‘‘starting from scratch’’ and developing ‘‘new’’
components, methods, and/or processes.

for

the use of computers

Our study also considers CAD/CAM, which is
CAM in conjunction with computer-aided design/
computer-aided engineering (CAD/CAE). CAD/CAE
involves
interactive
engineering drawing and the storage/retrieval of
designs. CAD/CAE is used to quickly design products
that are easy to manufacture and that make use of
existing components where possible. CAM (compu-
ter-aided manufacturing) uses a computer to program,
direct, and control machines. CAM may include
coordinating
controlled machines,
robotics, ﬂexible manufacturing systems, automated
storage and retrieval systems, and automatic identi-
ﬁcation systems. CAD/CAE outputs can be directly
input
to produce a seamless design/
manufacturing process.

1.2.1. Practices as antecedents to time-based
performance capabilities

Previous research suggests that

the following
widely cited practices can individually speed up the
innovation process: (1) the use of CAD (Stalk, 1988;
Rosenau, 1988; Cordero, 1991; Millson et al., 1992;
Mabert et al., 1992); (2) supplier involvement (Imai et
al., 1985; Bower and Hout, 1988; Hayes et al., 1998;
Clark, 1989; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Crawford,
1992); (3) overlapping product development stages
(i.e., concurrent engineering) (Imai et al., 1985; Hayes
et al., 1998; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Cordero,
1991); and (4) multifunctional teams (Quinn, 1985;
Stalk and Hout, 1990; Bower and Hout, 1988; Hayes et
al., 1998; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Crawford, 1992;
Mabert et al., 1992; Meyer, 1993; Henke et al., 1993;
Hershock et al., 1994; Carmel, 1995; Cooper and
Kleinschmidt, 1995).

Several empirical studies have examined the effects
of these product development practices on product
development time. The results are mixed. One study
(see Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995) concluded that only
product-process overlap and multifunctional teams
(but not CAD and supplier
involvement) were
inversely related to product development time. But
Malhotra et al.
(2001) demonstrated that CAD
functionality and sophistication are positively related
to time and range ﬂexibility. Another study comparing

involvement

Japanese and American automobile companies found
that
(and strong supplier
relationships) . . . contributes 4–5 months of the lead
time advantage [of Japanese auto producers]’’ (Clark,
1989; p. 1260). However, a more recent study found
no relationship between buyer-supplier
interface
methods and product development time (Hartley et
al., 1997). Furthermore, an earlier electronics industry
study by Zirger and Hartley (1996) also failed to ﬁnd
such a link.

The effects of these product development practices
on time-to-product (i.e., the overall product delivery
cycle) and on customer responsiveness have not been
investigated. In addition, the effects of other high
proﬁle product development practices (e.g., DFM,
standardization) have not been examined in the
context of a large-scale empirical study. This research
addresses these voids by examining the relationships
that exist among strategic design integration and
design-process integration practices, time-based per-
formance, and overall ﬁrm performance.

Our two major categories of antecedent practices—
a category spanning external ﬁrm boundaries and a
category focused on internal
integration—broadly
mirror
the two opposing forces in new product
development proposed by Sheremata (2002). She
calls these two forces centrifugal and centripetal
forces. Centrifugal forces are deﬁned as structural
elements and processes that increase the quantity and
quality of ideas, knowledge, and information an
organization can access; they pull an organization
outward, away from its conceptual center. In contrast,
centripetal forces are structural elements and pro-
cesses that integrate dispersed ideas, knowledge, and
information into collective action; they pull parts of an
organization inward,
toward its conceptual center.
Sheremata argues that the co-existence of both forces
increases the probability of successful new product
development. In the context of this paradigm, we view
our external integration practices of supplier devel-
opment, supplier partnership, and closer customer
relationships as exerting an outward pull on the ﬁrm,
providing access to new knowledge and engendering
creativity. Likewise, we view our internal integration
practices of concurrent engineering, design for
manufacturability, standardization, and CAD/CAM
as processes that facilitate the integration of dispersed
ideas, knowledge, and information into the collective

action required for successful new product develop-
ment and introduction. Like Sheremata (2002), we
view both as essential to new product development but
further contend that their effects will be felt on other,
related measures of time-based performance (i.e.,
time-to-product, customer responsiveness). Not only
do we examine these two integration constructs
separately as antecedents, but we also investigate
their interaction effect (as speciﬁed in the hypotheses
below).

1.2.2. Practices in the context of the automotive
supply industry

The context for our study is the automotive supply
industry, and thus we brieﬂy discuss the time it takes to
make and deliver cars (e.g., Teresko, 2002; Verespej,
2002). Automobile OEMs have signiﬁcant inﬂuence
over the development of new products by ﬁrst tier
suppliers since they dictate product speciﬁcations (in
some cases providing their own engineering designs)
and timetables for launch. Indeed, product develop-
ment is often a joint venture between suppliers and
their OEM customers in this industry, which means
responsibility for ‘time-to-market’ performance is
shared. While our study does focus on ‘time-to-
market’ (i.e., product development and launch speed),
we also concentrate considerable attention on those
elements of lead-time for which ﬁrst tier suppliers
have sole responsibility (i.e., procurement, manufac-
turing, and delivery) as well as on the overall
responsiveness of suppliers to their OEM customers.
The reliance on ﬁrst
tier suppliers is especially
important in light of the rapid pace of new products (or
car models) being introduced by the automotive
OEMs. Such a rapid pace of innovation requires strong
integration with capabilities of the suppliers. It is these
aspects of time-based performance that have received
the least attention in empirical studies.

2. The research model

The core premise of this research (see Fig. 1) is that
ﬁrm performance (as well as time-based performance)
is affected by:
strategic, externally-focused
boundary spanning practices; (2) tactical, internally-
focused boundary-spanning practices; and (3) the

(1)


562

C. Droge et al. / Journal of Operations Management 22 (2004) 557–573

synergistic effect of external and internal integration
(i.e., their interaction).

We employed a two-stage approach. First, we
sought
to identify the effects of strategic design
integration and design-process integration on three
aspects of time-based performance—time-to-market,
time-to-product and responsiveness. In the second
stage, we explored whether these two constructs (and
their interaction) signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ﬁrm perfor-
mance, after the effects of time-based performance on
ﬁrm performance is accounted for. Firm performance
encompasses market share and ﬁnancial performance.

2.1. Integration and time-based performance

The literature suggests that external strategic
design integration engenders quicker product devel-
opment and introduction times. Different stages of the
product development cycle require the expertise of
key suppliers. For example, this expertise is critical in
the idea generation and concept stage, sometimes
called the ‘fuzzy front end’ of product development. In
this stage, internal units that have speciﬁc knowledge
of market conditions and customer needs coordinate
and communicate with external units
such as
customers and suppliers to facilitate early involvement
in product design. The fuzzy front end presents a
signiﬁcant business risk to all concerned, and there-
fore it is imperative for ﬁrms to build relationships to
ensure cooperation. For example, Rooney (2002)
explored how a customer and supplier dyad used a
partnering approach to improve products, processes,
and services;
this partnering resulted in open
communication lines, quicker resolution of proble-
matic issues and higher responsiveness (see also
Takeuchi and Nonaka, 1986; Wheelwright and Clark,
1992).

Early involvement helps accelerate the new product
process by eliminating steps, preventing delays,
presenting opportunities for simpliﬁcation and parallel
processing, and speeding up the times for ramp-up
manufacturing (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Wheel-
wright and Clark, 1992). Supplier partnering provides
a framework for strategic collaboration, ensuring that
the supplier is involved early on to provide needed
expertise and/or critical
technological capabilities.
This marrying of capabilities in the design phase
speeds up the product development process by

ensuring a match between what the supplier provides
and what the manufacturer actually needs to develop a
marketable product. In a similar vein, closer customer
relationships engender the rapid development and
launch of a new product by ensuring customer input
throughout the process.

Design integration is also vital

in ensuring
responsiveness to customers after the product launch.
Being responsive means providing post-launch pro-
duct support for customers. For large system sourcing
that requires signiﬁcant customization, many ﬁrms
may have to provide customer service even prior to the
sale (e.g., sharing technical knowledge of how the
product ﬁts into the end user’s product line). Also,
many of the design related problems surface after the
product is delivered. Having an integrated database
that tracks problems systematically and transmits the
information to the appropriate product development
groups is useful for reﬁning future product designs.
However, some problems are unique to particular
customers. In such cases, problem solving might be
facilitated by clearly deﬁning the scope of the projects
and assigning speciﬁc tasks to suppliers. This is
similar to the concept of continuous improvement
called Kaizen events (see for example, Handﬁeld et
al., 2000).

Design integration is also facilitated through
building collaborative relationships with customers.
Automotive OEMs (who are the customers in this
research context) oversee a wide program of product
development that spans several car models, design
platforms and variations in customer needs globally.
OEMs depend heavily on ﬁrst tier suppliers for the
production and delivery of systems and sub-assem-
blies in a timely fashion. For example, in Ford’s MN-
12 program for development of the Thunderbird and
Cougar models, the responsibility for the entire brake
system was assigned to the ﬁrst tier systems supplier,
Bendix (McElroy, 1987). Building trust and commit-
ment with ﬁrst tier suppliers has been mentioned as a
vital strategic initiative for the automotive OEMs
(Drickhamer, 2002; Teresko, 2002). Results include a
signiﬁcant reduction in vehicle development time,
inventory and total cost in the value chain (see also
Corswant and Tunalv, 2002). Past research suggests
that building closer customer
relationships with
automotive OEMs reduces overall development and
delivery cycle times. Thus:

time-to-market,

Internal design-process

integration could also
affect
time-to-product and respon-
siveness. The emphasis placed on concurrent engi-
neering is based on avoiding costly failures stemming
from poor designs/manufacturing/assembly or failure
to respond to customer needs in a timely fashion. In
CE, at least some stages of product development are
executed simultaneously. The ‘manufacturability’
resulting from such parallel processing should
positively affect lead times and delivery (i.e., cycle
times).

Other techniques that facilitate speed include CAD/
CAM. In addition to its innate automation capability,
CAD/CAM can speed up manufacturing by simplify-
ing processes as well as components, products and
eliminating redundant steps (Millson et al., 1992;
Carter et al., 1995). Furthermore, when one part of the
design is changed, the parallel effects on other parts
can more easily be identiﬁed, and the ﬁnal speciﬁca-
tions can perhaps be communicated electronically to
the robots that will manufacture the parts. No
empirical study has examined the effects of both
CAD and CAM on time-to-market and time-to-
product performance. Previous studies have shown,
however, that CAD by itself has no effect on time-to-
market performance.

such as

Similarly, practices

standardization
and DFM should have time-based consequences.
Products that have a high proportion of standardized
parts, procedures and sources of supply are relatively
easy to design, make and support. However, the need
for product differentiation necessitates the introduc-
tion of new parts, new designs, more efﬁcient methods
of manufacturing and faster modes of providing
support. The sheer volumes of products ensure
difﬁculties. Firms have been proactive in anticipating
potential problems by adopting DFM techniques.
Thus:

integration practices has a positive effect on product

time (time-to-market), product cycle
time (time-to-product) and responsiveness.

2.2. Time-based performance and overall ﬁrm
performance

We consider both ﬁnancial performance and
market share as indicators of overall ﬁrm perfor-
mance. Limited empirical studies have looked at the
relationship between time-based performance and
overall ﬁrm performance (Vickery et al. 1995, 1997;
Narasimhan and Jayaram, 1998). Vickery et al.
(1995) examined the following antecedents to ﬁrm
performance: (1) product development cycle time;
(2) new product introduction; (3) production lead
time; and (4) delivery speed. The most consistent
predictor was new product introduction. In a later
analysis, a delivery performance factor (consisting of
volume ﬂexibility, delivery speed, and delivery
dependability) was found to be related to growth in
ROI, ROS, and Sales (Vickery et al., 1997; see also
Handﬁeld and Pannesi, 1992).

and ﬁrm performance in the North American
and European samples. A signiﬁcantly, negative
relationship between customer responsiveness and
ﬁrm performance was found in the Pan Paciﬁc
sample.

In contrast,

We extend this research by adding a customer
responsiveness construct (and also adding procure-
ment
lead time as a separate measure) and then
categorizing measures as either ‘time-to-market’ if the
measure pertained to NPD or ‘time-to-product’ if the
measure pertained to the procurement, manufacturing
and delivery stages of the value chain. In addition, we
included a responsiveness dimension capturing both
the speed and efﬁciency with which products were
designed, manufactured, delivered and supported.
This expanded deﬁnition is consistent with the works
of Barker (1993), Azzone et al. (1991), and Carter et
al. (1995). Our approach is also consistent with Naylor
et al. (1999) who suggest that time-based performance
in an extended value chain (they use the term
‘‘leagility’’) should include lead time as well as
agility or responsiveness.

To our knowledge, no empirical

study has
examined the differential impacts of all of these core
dimensions of value chain timing on overall ﬁrm

performance. This approach is logical and intuitively
appealing to managers since it can guide them in
deciding whether
in time-
based performance should be directed in the design
cycle, manufacturing cycle or product support cycle.

also interested in examining the
direct effects of practices on overall ﬁrm perfor-
mance after controlling for the effects through time-
based performance. This is an important, under-
researched issue (cf., for example, Marsh and Stock,
2003). Boundary spanning integration practices may
positively affect market share and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance over and above their effects through time-
based performance outcomes because integration
practices may also lead to quality/reliability perfor-
mance, ﬂexibility performance, cost performance
and other outcomes not considered here. For
example, integration may enhance ﬂexibility and
reduce costs—leading to improved performance by
retaining more customers and increasing proﬁt ratios.

3. Research methodology

3.1. The sampling procedure

We focused on ﬁrst tier suppliers to the ‘‘Big
Three’’ car companies (OEMs) in North America. The
unit of analysis was the strategic business unit (SBU)
or individual ﬁrm. The population frame consisted of
the top 150 ﬁrst tier suppliers in terms of annual sales.
The list of companies was provided by experts from
the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), a
professional association with over 1000 members
(Actionline, 1995).

A panel of AIAG experts ensured the content
validity of the items and assisted in the pretest. All
items were deﬁned on the questionnaire. The
questionnaire was mailed to CEOs, along with an
informational letter stating the research purpose and
that a member of the research team would be calling
soon. CEOs of multiple business units were instructed
to select one SBU and to forward the questionnaire to
the CEO of that unit. Repeat telephone calls were
made to obtain participation. The ﬁnal sample
consisted of 57 SBUs (about 39% response). Mean
sales were $488.3 million (S.D. = $646.8), of which
83.9% were direct to North American OEMs. Mean
number of employees was 2862 (S.D. = 3442). Mean
market share was 24.7% (S.D. = 19.1%).

Using available Dun&Bradstreet secondary data,
we compared 71 non-responding companies versus 55
companies whose SBU responded:
there was no
statistically signiﬁcant difference in average company
sales ($1848 versus $2349 million) nor in the average
number of employees (10,678 versus 13,824). About
51% of non-responding companies were public,
versus about 42% of responders.

3.2. Measurement of exogenous independent
variables

The ‘‘extent of use’’ scale had seven-points with
endpoints labeled ‘‘extremely low’’ (=1) and ‘‘extre-
mely high use of item’’ (=7). The respondents were
asked to ‘‘rate the degree to which the following
initiatives were utilized by your SBU.’’ The question-
naire items themselves are listed in the Appendix A.1.
Respondent were told to circle ‘‘not used’’ (coded as
zero) ‘‘if the initiative was not used at all in your
SBU.’’

3.3. Measurement of endogenous dependent
variables

Time-to-market capability was measured using
product development time and new product intro-
duction time. Three types of time-to-product cap-
ability—procurement lead time, manufacturing lead
time and delivery speed—were also measured.
Finally, the three items measuring responsiveness
were pre-sale customer service, product support and
responsiveness to customers. The items are in the
Appendix A.2. Return on investment, pre-tax return
on assets and return on sales were used to capture
ﬁnancial performance. Market share and growth in
market share were used to capture market share,
deﬁned at the ﬁrm or SBU level as per cent of the
North American OEM market. For all
items,
respondents were asked to subjectively rate the
ﬁrm’s performance relative to its major competitors
on 7-point scales, where 1 = ‘‘poor’’ and 7 = ‘‘excel-
lent’’.

Descriptive statistics (means and S.D.) as well as
the correlation matrix of all variables are presented in
Table 1. The constructs were formed by taking the
mean of their respective measurement items.

measures to which more respondents answered.

r = .338, p < .05; ROA:
r = .341, p < .05; ROS:

Next, we performed a conﬁrmatory factor analysis
to verify overall measurement ﬁt (Table 2). The overall
ﬁt was good (x2 = 192.477; d.f. = 149; p = .009;
Bentler–Bonnet non-normed ﬁt index = .975; com-
paritive ﬁt
index (CFI) = .973; standardized root
mean-squared residual (SRMSQ) = .046). All factor
loadings were statistically signiﬁcant,
indicating
good convergent validity. The Lagrange multiplier
(LM) test for omitted paths revealed no signiﬁcant
cross
indicating discriminant validity
(in particular, between internal and external integra-
tion). An exploratory principal components factor
analysis reveals exactly two factors with eigenvalue
over 1, with the variables splitting on the factors
as speciﬁed in the CFA. This supports unidimension-
ality.

loadings,

Internal consistency was evaluated using Cron-
bach’s alpha (which indicates reliability of the
mean): all exceeded .60, which is the standard
minimum for exploratory research. An ‘‘alpha if
dropped’’ analysis shows that
if any variable is
dropped from either the internal or external integra-
tion construct, Cronbach’s alpha will decrease. It
should be noted that the Cronbach alphas for the
internal versus external integration constructs are in
the low .60 s and that some of the CFA standardized
factor loadings are low. This is typical of macro-
level, ‘index-like’ constructs. The important char-
acteristics are that the alphas are acceptable, the
loadings are statistically signiﬁcant, and that the
measurements discriminate between internal and
external integration.

3.4. Veriﬁcation of the measurement model

4. Results

We ﬁrst scrutinized the validity of our ﬁrm
performance measures. Most ﬁrms/SBUs are reluctant
to reveal objective performance data because of
conﬁdentiality. However, we did ask for objective ﬁrm
performance measures, and 28 of 57 ﬁrms did respond.
We thus established substantial concordance (high
correlations) between subjective and objective per-

The hypotheses were tested using regression or
hierarchical regression (see Aiken and West, 1991).
The regression results of testing for the effects of
integration on each of the three time-based dependent
measures are in Table 3. H1 stated that external
integration would be a positive antecedent to each, and
as can be seen from the ﬁrst row in Table 3, H1 is

strongly supported. Similarly, the results in the second
row of Table 3 show that H2 concerning the impact of
internal integration was fully supported.

All other hypotheses were evaluated using hier-
archical regressions. The results for market share are
presented in Table 4, while those for ﬁnancial
performance are in Table 5. In hierarchical regression,
constructs are entered in sequence. First, the time-
related constructs are entered (see Model 1 in Table 4
or in Table 5), then the integration constructs (see
Model 2 in Tables 4 and 5). Then, the interaction term

is also entered (see Model 3 in Tables 4 and 5). The
key question at each stage is whether the additional
regression variables are signiﬁcant, given the variables
already in the model.

Examining ﬁrst Model 1 in both tables, the results
show that only time-to-product displayed a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on market share, while only responsiveness
was signiﬁcantly related to ﬁnancial performance.
This provides some support for H3a and b.

In Model 2 of Table 4 or 5, the two constructs
representing integration were added to determine

the additional variance explained was

over Model 1 in Table 4 was about 3% (p < .05),
suggesting that inclusion of external strategic design
integration was important and providing support for
H4a. About 18% of the variation in market share is
explained, most of it by time-to-product and external
integration (the two signiﬁcant variables). For

ﬁnancial performance, Model 2 in Table 5 is an
incremental improvement over Model 1 in R-square of
about .5% (p < .05), providing support for H4d. About
11% of the variation in ﬁnancial performance is
explained, mostly by responsiveness and internal
design-process integration.

followed by the inclusion of the interaction effect. The
interaction effect was signiﬁcant at .05 in the case of
market share (Model 3, Table 4). It explained an
additional 2% variance, which was also statistically
signiﬁcant. Thus, H5a was supported. For ﬁnancial
performance (Table 5), the interaction term was also
signiﬁcant and its inclusion explained an additional
5% in ﬁnancial performance variance. This supports
H5b.

It may be noted that the results reported in Model 3
of Tables 4 and 5 indicate a fairly strong support for
the links shown in Fig. 1 (see R-squared values).
Speciﬁcally, our results show that our hypothesized
variables explain 20% variation in market share
performance and 15% variation in ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. In the next section, the implications of the
pattern of results obtained are discussed.

5. Discussion

three types of

This paper examined the relationships among
integration practices,
time-based
performance (viewed as intermediate performance
outcomes), and overall ﬁrm performance (i.e.,
ﬁnancial and market share, viewed as the ﬁnal
performance outcomes). Integration practices were
grouped into: (1) external strategic design integration,
which included supplier development, supplier part-
nerships, and closer customer relationships; and (2)
internal design-process integration, which included
CE, DFM, standardization and CAD/CAM. External
integration reaches across the supply chain to involve
suppliers and customers, while internal integration is
more tactical, matching design requirements and
process capabilities. For each of the seven constructs,
the mean of the measurement items was taken to form
an index (after testing for acceptable reliability and
validity). The multiplicative interaction of internal and
external integration was also examined.

temper

the results’

Before discussing the results, a number of
limitations that
interpretation
should be noted. First, the sample comprised suppliers
to the Big Three auto manufacturers only, and thus
direct generalizability to other industries must be
made cautiously. Second, the population of ﬁrst tier
suppliers and the resulting sample size are small.
There are only about 150 signiﬁcant ﬁrst tier suppliers

for automobile OEMs, and we obtained co-operation
from 57 of them (close to 40%). Thus, some of the
validity of our sample comes from the proportion of
the business we ‘‘cover’’. Third, we had one
respondent per supplier and no direct way of testing
that the questionnaire items meant exactly the same
thing to each respondent. Although all items were
approved by the industry association and all were
deﬁned on the questionnaire, it is possible that terms
such as ‘‘concurrent engineering’’ had different
meanings to different individuals. In our discussion
of the results below, we present anecdotal information
to provide additional support for the validity of our
results.

5.1. Integration: routes to ﬁrm performance
through time-based performance

One manager of a well-known OEM supplier told
us that closer customer relationships enabled the
company to reduce lead times signiﬁcantly and that
the implementation of CAD and rapid prototyping had
reduced tooling time and product development time.
Also, the use of concurrent engineering in combina-
tion with DFM had allowed compression of launch
timing and increases
in quality and customer
satisfaction. Another manager from a very large ﬁrst
tier supplier provided anecdotal information concern-
ing the beneﬁcial effects of CAD, CAM, standardiza-
tion, concurrent engineering, and DFM on various
time-based performance measures (e.g., customer
responsiveness and lead time).

Regression results support these anecdotes. First,
each of internal and external integration is related to
each of the three time-based intermediate performance
constructs: ‘time-to-market’, ‘time-to-product’, and
customer responsiveness. Thus, given any one of these
three time-based performance goals, managers can
expect improvements towards that goal if they take
steps to implement either external strategic design
integration practices or internal design-process inte-
gration practices. Of course we are not implying that
internal and external integration are the only ways to
achieve time-based performance; nor are we implying
that the speciﬁc practices that formed our indices of
internal and external integration are the only relevant
ones, or
relevant at all outside of our context.
However, we believe that most managers will ﬁnd

the external versus internal conceptualization useful as
they examine practices relevant to their industry or
ﬁrm.

being

the other

Second, we examined the effects of time-to-market,
time-to-product, and customer
responsiveness on
market share and on ﬁnancial performance (i.e., ﬁnal
performance outcomes). The results show that time-
to-product appears to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
market share but, given that time-to-product is in the
time-based constructs are not
model,
signiﬁcant. Similarly,
responsive
enhances ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance, but the other
time-based constructs are not signiﬁcant (given that
responsiveness is accounted for). And, again we add a
caveat: we are not implying that time-based perfor-
mance outcomes are the only relevant intermediate
performance outcomes. For example, cost or quality
performance could also enhance ﬁrm performance,
and either may be an important
intermediate
performance outcome as far as the management of
the ﬁrm is concerned.

highly

internal or external

The results of our research imply that there are two
distinct ‘‘2-step’’ indirect routes to enhanced ﬁrm
performance when integration is the starting point and
time-based outcomes are the intermediate perfor-
mance indicators. The ﬁrst major route starts with
either
integration leading to
improved time-to-product (the ﬁrst step), which in
turn has a positive inﬂuence on market share (the
second step); and the other major route starts with
either
integration enhancing
responsiveness (the ﬁrst step), followed by respon-
siveness in turn having a positive impact on ﬁrm
ﬁnancial performance (the second step). In each of
these ‘‘2-step’’ routes, internal and/or external integra-
tion impact ﬁrm performance indirectly through their
impact on one or more time-based performance
outcomes.

5.2. Integration: direct routes to ﬁrm performance

construct

We next addressed the question of whether either
integration
affects ﬁrm performance
directly, after accounting for their indirect effects
through time-based performance. Hierarchical regres-
sion analyses revealed afﬁrmative answers.

External integration has a direct positive impact on
market share, even after accounting for the indirect

effects on market share through the timed-based
outcomes. This means that external
integration is
operating on market share in ways over and above the
impact exerted through the ‘‘2-step’’ route discussed
in the previous section. We also found that internal
integration has a direct positive impact on ﬁnancial
performance, even after accounting for its indirect
effects through the timed-based constructs. Thus,
internal integration is inﬂuencing ﬁnancial perfor-
mance in ways not accounted for by the second ‘‘2-
step’’
indirectly through timed-based
outcomes as discussed previously).

could be identiﬁed and the question becomes
there are remaining direct effects of

including the indirect effects
through time, quality, inventory, cost, etc. We leave
this to future research.

5.3. The interaction of internal and external
integration: synergistic effects

Finally, we found that the interaction of internal
and external integration was signiﬁcantly related to
both market share and ﬁnancial performance (after
controlling for all other effects). This latter result
suggests that the joint use of external and internal
integration has synergistic effects on ﬁrm performance
outcomes. Note that these synergistic effects exist in
addition to: (a) the direct effects of integration on ﬁrm
performance and (b) the ‘‘2-step’’ routes of indirect
effects through time-based outcomes.

571

The existence of the interaction effect implies for
managers that while there is performance impact of
implementing either internal or external integration
practices, it may be better to proceed simultaneously,
rather
than sequentially with internal practices
implemented ﬁrst. For example, suppose four internal
and four external integration practices are identiﬁed,
but only half can be implemented this year. Is it better
to tackle all four internal practices ﬁrst, followed by
the external ones (i.e., use the internal versus external
division as the basis for deciding order of implemen-
tation, perhaps because internal practices are per-
ceived as easier to control)? Our interaction effect
results suggest that this strategy is not necessarily
better and in fact may be worse in terms of
performance impact than tackling two internal and
two external practices.

researched. Indeed, few researchers include hypothe-
sized interaction effects in their proposed models, and
few test for the existence of interaction effects that
were not
initially proposed. In this research, we
examined a limited number of variables, grouped into
a limited number of constructs; however, we
scrutinized direct effects, indirect effects and inter-
action effects. Unfortunately, as the number of
constructs increases, the effects decomposition pro-
blem does not
increase proportionately: with two

there are four
interactions; with 4
constructs, there are 10; and so on. This makes it
very important

in multiple areas such as quality, design support,
and delivery.

(2) Supplier partnership: bringing all of the partici-
pants in the product life cycle into the process
early on so even suppliers and customers can
provide input to each others’ processes.

(3) Closer customer relationships: determining cus-
(both inside and outside the ﬁrm)
tomers’
requirements, then meeting those requirements
no matter what it takes.

Design-process integration (internal integration)

(4) Concurrent engineering: overlapping activities in
product and process development
to ensure a
match between design requirements and process
capabilities, reducing time-to-market

(5) Design for manufacturability: an approach (using
concepts such as design for assembly, design for
serviceability, and design for test) for designing
products that can be more effectively manufac-
tured.

(6) Standardization: the use of standard procedures,
materials, parts, and/or processes for designing
and manufacturing a product.

(7) Computer-aided design/engineering: the use of
computers in interactive engineering drawing and
storage of design to obtain graphical views of a
part and its relationship with other parts.

(8) Computer-aided manufacturing:

the use of a
computer
to program, direct and control an
independent machine in the fabrication of
manufactured items.

(3) Procurement lead time: the ability to minimize the
time from order placement to the delivery of the
procured item, which includes supplier lead time,
transportation, and receiving and inspection.

(4) Manufacturing lead time: the ability to minimize
the time from when the order was released to the
shop ﬂoor to the time of its completion.

(5) Delivery speed: the ability to minimize the time
between receipt of customer order and ﬁnal
delivery, to as close to zero as possible.

(6) Pre-sale customer service: the ability to service
the customer during the purchase decision process
(i.e., before the customer buys the product).

(7) Product

support:

the ability to service the
customer in providing product support after the
sale of the product to ensure continuing customer
satisfaction.

(8) Responsiveness

to customers:

the ability to
minimize the time it takes to cater to customer
needs by processing and solving customer
complaints by rapid conﬁrmation of orders and
by minimizing customer information lead time.
