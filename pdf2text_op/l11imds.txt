Abstract
Purpose – Recent studies have found inconsistent ﬁndings on the impact of supplier and customer
involvement on new product development. This study thus aims to explore what contextual factors
affect supplier and customer involvement altogether and how such involvement affects new product
performance.
Design/methodology/approach – The study used structural equation modelling to analyze
empirical survey data from 251 manufacturers in Hong Kong.
Findings – The study found that modular design, product innovation, and internal coordination are
positively correlated with the supplier and customer involvement. Such involvement and product
innovation lead to better new product performance.
Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to the use of cross-sectional data and a
single key informant approach, and the industry structure of the sampled industries.
Practical implications – The study examines the contextual factors of supplier and customer
involvement and how such involvement relates to new product development with new empirical
evidence. The study not only provides new empirical evidence to support the importance of supply
chain management in product development, but also extends existing literature to identify new
contextual factors for such involvement.
Originality/value – The study re-examines generalized beliefs about supplier and customer
involvement in new product development, and extends prior studies of the contextual dimensions of
product modularity, product innovativeness, and internal coordination on such involvement in an
empirical way.

1. Introduction
A growing body of literature suggests that a company will perform well if it
collaborates with suppliers and customers in new product development (NPD)
(Lin et al., 2010; Shamsuzzoha et al., 2009; Parker, 2000; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995).
In industrial management and data systems literature, there have been continuously
studies on the importance of suppliers and customers in NPD from 1998 onwards
(Willis, 1998; Koh et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010). In order to compete in twenty-ﬁrst
century, manufacturers should implement agile manufacturing, for which early
