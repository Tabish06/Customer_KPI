LEADERSHIP BEHAVIOR AND EMPLOYEE VOICE:

IS THE DOOR REALLY OPEN?

We investigate the relationships between two types of change-oriented leadership
(transformational leadership and managerial openness) and subordinate improve-
ment-oriented voice in a two-phase study. Findings from 3,149 employees and 223
managers in a restaurant chain indicate that openness is more consistently related to
voice, given controls for numerous individual differences in subordinates’ personality,
satisfaction, and job demography. This relationship is shown to be mediated by
subordinate perceptions of psychological safety, illustrating the importance of leaders
in subordinate assessments of the risks of speaking up. Also, leadership behaviors
have the strongest impact on the voice behavior of the best-performing employees.

In today’s hypercompetitive business environ-
ment, employee comments and suggestions in-
tended to improve organizational functioning are
critical to performance because, as Senge wrote, it
is “just not possible any longer to ‘figure it out’
from the top” (1990: 4; see also Morrison & Mil-
liken, 2000). Edmondson (1999, 2003), for example,
found that the willingness of all members to pro-
vide thoughts and ideas about critical work pro-
cesses characterizes successful learning in various
types of teams. Yet, despite this “learning impera-
tive,” many individuals do not work in environ-
ments where they perceive it as safe to speak up
(Milliken, Morrison, & Hewlin, 2003; Ryan & Oes-
trich, 1998). This presents an unsettling state of
affairs: Voice, which we define as the discretionary
provision of information intended to improve or-
ganizational functioning to someone inside an or-
ganization with the perceived authority to act, even
though such information may challenge and upset
the status quo of the organization and its power
holders, is critical to organizational well-being yet
insufficiently provided by employees, who see the

risks of speaking up as outweighing the benefits.
Thus, it is important to better understand who
speaks up with potentially valuable information
and the organizational conditions that favor or in-
hibit such behavior. In this study, we seek to con-
tribute to such understanding.

Three broad lines of research have addressed this
line of inquiry to varying degrees. The most sys-
tematic research to date has focused on individual
differences in personality and demographic charac-
teristics as correlates of voice (Crant, 2003; LePine
& Van Dyne, 2001). The stated or implicit reasoning
in this line of work is that some individuals are
simply more likely than others to “go the extra
mile” in regard to speaking up. A second line of
research, based on Hirschman’s (1970) seminal
work defining exit, voice, and loyalty as the pri-
mary options facing employees who are dissatisfied
with some aspect of organizational functioning,
treats employee attitudes as the primary determi-
nant of upward voice (Rusbult, Farrell, Rogers, &
Mainous, 1988; Withey & Cooper, 1989). Finally, a
third research stream focuses on aspects of an or-
ganizational context that may affect employees’
willingness to speak up. An implicit assumption in
this view is that even the most proactive or satisfied
employees are likely to “read the wind” as to
whether it is safe and/or worthwhile to speak up in
their particular context (Dutton, Ashford, O’Neill,
Hayes, & Wierba, 1997; Edmondson, 2003; Milliken
et al., 2003).

Seeking to further develop the contextual stream,
we focus on the role that specific leadership behav-
iors play in influencing employees’ decisions to
voluntarily provide comments or suggestions in-

tended to spark organizational improvement. Qual-
itative research has identified a number of leader
behaviors or attributes—including “approachabil-
ity” (Milliken et al., 2003; Saunders, Sheppard,
Knight, & Roth, 1992), “action taking” (Edmond-
son, 2003; Ryan & Oestreich, 1998), and “accessi-
bility” (Edmondson, 1999)—that lead subordinates
to conclude it is either safe or unsafe to speak up.
However, the few quantitative studies that have
assessed some aspect of leadership influence on
voice have produced less conclusive results (e.g.,
Ashford et al., 1998). For example, Saunders and
colleagues (1992) developed a measure, “supervi-
sor as voice manager,” and found it to be positively
related to the likelihood of voice in two samples,
but Janssen, de Vries, and Cozijnsen (1998), con-
trolling for several individual differences, found
that the supervisor as voice manager construct was
not significantly related to subordinates’ reported
likelihood to voice novel ideas. In sum, the litera-
ture presents a troubling discrepancy: Studies with
the highest face validity suggest that leadership
behaviors are an important contextual antecedent
of voice, but survey research has failed to replicate
such findings.

The specific purpose of this study was therefore
to address inconsistent findings about leadership
behavior as an influence on subordinates’ improve-
ment-oriented voice. In a two-phase field study, we
addressed the questions, “Is leadership behavior
related to subordinate voice?” and, “If so, why and
for what types of employees?” Our study extends
the literature in a number of ways. First, few of the
labels used to describe leadership findings in pre-
vious work correspond directly with constructs de-
veloped in the broader leadership literature. We
drew upon well-established theory on leadership
and power to develop predictions for how specific
leader behaviors influence employee voice. Sec-
ond, we controlled for many of the personality and
employee attitudinal explanations found important
in prior voice research but usually lacking in the
leadership-focused studies. Third, we heeded calls
for more precision in voice research (Van Dyne,
Ang, & Botero, 2003) by limiting our voice con-
struct to verbal behavior that is improvement-ori-
ented and directed to a specific target who holds
power inside the organization in question. Beyond
advancing understanding of leadership behavior as
a predictor of voice, this study also examines psy-
chological safety as an important mediating cogni-
tion linking leadership and voice and addresses
how subordinate performance level might moder-
ate the impact of leadership behavior on voice.
Collectively, this research extends understanding

of the leadership-voice relationship and points to
specific ways leaders can foster employee input.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES

The notion of voice stems from the idea that
employees recognize some source of dissatisfaction
or opportunity for improving their own and/or
their organization’s well-being (Hirschman, 1970).
Speaking up in such situations can feel risky be-
cause they involve pointing out need for improve-
ment in a program or policy to those who may have
devised, be responsible for, or feel personally at-
tached to the status quo. Given this, along with the
reality that voice cannot be coerced or readily de-
signed into the in-role requirements of a job (Van
Dyne & LePine, 1998), an initial motivation to
speak up is likely to manifest in behavior only
when the net perceived benefits outweigh potential
costs. Perceived potential benefits of speaking up
include getting the problem solved as well as for-
mal (e.g., money or promotion) or informal (e.g.,
recognition or status) rewards that might be associ-
ated with having one’s ideas be well received and
possibly implemented. Conversely, potential costs
include “existence losses” (e.g., demotion or termi-
nation) and “relatedness losses” (e.g., humiliation
or loss of social standing) (Maslow, 1943). In short,
the decision to speak up results from an affect-
laden expectancy-like calculus (Ashford, Rothbard,
Piderit, & Dutton, 1998; Milliken et al., 2003;
Withey & Cooper, 1989).

Theoretically, leadership behavior affects this
voice calculus for two primary reasons, both re-
lated to the resource dependency of subordinates
in hierarchical settings (Emerson, 1962; Pfeffer &
Salancik, 1978). First, to speak up, by definition,
involves sharing one’s ideas with someone with
the perceived power to devote organizational at-
tention or resources to the issue raised (French &
Raven, 1959). Thus, leaders are inherently impor-
tant to the voice process because they are its
targets. Second, leaders have the authority to ad-
minister rewards and punishments, and this
power over subordinates’ pay, promotions, and
job assignments makes leaders’ actions highly
salient as cues for behavior (Depret & Fiske,
1993). Thus, when leaders send signals that they
are interested in and willing to act on subordi-
nate voice, subordinates’ motivation to speak up
should be maintained or enhanced; absent such
leader behaviors, subordinates may see potential
risks as outweighing perceived benefits.

Change-Oriented Leadership

Because voice involves suggestions to do some-
thing differently,
leader behaviors signaling an
openness to or appreciation for change should be a
critical contextual influence on employee willing-
ness to speak up. Descriptions from qualitative re-
search suggest the importance of such behaviors.
For example, Edmondson (2003) reported that lead-
ers who explicitly communicated a rationale for
change, explained the need for others’ input, and
took action on others’ ideas had subordinates who
were more willing to contribute to team learning
despite the inherent risks of speaking up. Here, we
hypothesize that two specific sets of perceived
leader behaviors—management openness
and
transformational leadership—are particularly in-
dicative of an orientation toward continuous im-
provement and should therefore be positively re-
lated to subordinates’ belief that it is safe to speak
up and willingness to do so.

Research on issue selling (voice regarding a spe-
cific work improvement or employee treatment
topic) has identified management openness as a set
of leader behaviors particularly relevant to subor-
dinates’ motivation to speak up (Ashford et al.,
1998). Managerial openness refers to subordinates’
perceptions that their boss listens to them, is inter-
ested in their ideas, gives fair consideration to the
ideas presented, and at least sometimes takes ac-
tion to address the matter raised. Such behaviors
are significant in maintaining initial motivation to
speak up (Milliken et al., 2003). More importantly,
behaviors indicating openness to employee input
may decrease the salience of the power differential
between leaders and subordinates in such a way
that employees perceive few costs from raising po-
tentially risky ideas (Edmondson, 2003).

Like House and Rizzo’s (1972) top management
receptiveness concept, openness as related to issue
selling has been conceived of primarily as a senior
manager behavior. However, managers display
these behaviors to a greater or lesser extent at all
hierarchical levels. Thus, these behaviors likely in-
fluence upward communications by lower-level
employees as well. Indeed, qualitative research de-
scribes managerial openness as a strong influence
on employees at many organizational levels (e.g.,
Ryan & Oestrich, 1998; Sprague & Ruud, 1988).
Therefore, we predict:

Hypothesis 1. Leaders’ perceived display of
openness is positively related to subordinates’
improvement-oriented voice.

Transformational leaders are positively oriented
toward, and more likely to initiate, change (Bass,

1985; Waldman, Javidan, & Varella, 2004). They
accomplish change by encouraging employees to
move beyond compliance with formal agreements
and to become innovative problem solvers (Bass &
Riggio, 2006). A number of specific transforma-
tional behaviors, including individualized consid-
eration and inspirational motivation (Bass, 1985),
should be related to the voice calculus. For exam-
ple, individualized consideration reflects the no-
tion that each employee has specific strengths, in-
terests, and needs for improvement that must be
attended to one-on-one rather than via formal pol-
icies or pronouncements (Bass & Avolio, 1990).
Leaders demonstrating individualized consider-
ation toward subordinates encourage two-way
communication and listen effectively (Bass & Rig-
gio, 2006). In addition, leaders use inspirational
motivation to create commitment among subordi-
nates to their organization’s vision (Bass, 1985).
Leaders generate such commitment via frequent
public communications about the envisioned fu-
ture direction and goals of the organization and
consistent displays of passion about collective pur-
suit of the organization’s purpose (Conger, 1989).
Such transformational leader behaviors lead to
increased subordinate competence and commit-
ment as well as to empowerment and felt respon-
sibility to contribute to an organization’s future
(Senge, 1990; Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997). For
example, coaching is likely to reduce the intimida-
tion associated with raising uncomfortable topics,
such as those challenging the status quo. Further,
supportive coaching and vision sharing should in-
crease initial motivation to speak up because they
lead subordinates to accept more collective respon-
sibility for performance outcomes (Bennis & Nanus,
1985). These transformational
leader behaviors
should inspire subordinates to believe that their
bosses are oriented toward the future rather than
preservation of the status quo. Consequently, sub-
ordinates should be more willing to speak up with
comments aimed at organizational improvement.
We therefore predict:

Hypothesis 2. Leaders’ perceived transforma-
tional behaviors are positively related to sub-
ordinates’ improvement-oriented voice.

Psychological Safety and Voice

In keeping with the argument that employees
estimate perceived costs prior to speaking up, psy-
chological safety (the belief that engaging in risky
behaviors like voice will not lead to personal harm)
has been described as a key affect-laden cognition
influencing voice (Ashford et al., 1998; Edmond-

loss of support

son, 1999). Put simply, employees who fear signif-
icant personal losses from speaking up (e.g., re-
stricted career mobility,
from
superiors and peers) are likely to choose “defen-
sive” silence (Van Dyne et al., 2003). Because voice
often contains either implicit or explicit criticisms
of the status quo and because the targets of upward
voice hold reward and sanction power, leader be-
haviors are likely to be particularly salient cues that
subordinates use in evaluating whether voicing un-
solicited comments is personally dangerous (Mil-
liken et al., 2003). After all, most employees lack
the courage or commitment to challenge managers
who have signaled unwillingness to accept input
from below (Hornstein, 1986). Thus, when manag-
ers routinely demonstrate a personal interest, listen
carefully, and take action, they demonstrate to sub-
ordinates that there is little personal risk in honest
communication (Bass & Riggio, 2006; Edmondson,
2003). Such experiences should enhance perceived
psychological safety.

We therefore hypothesize that psychological
safety is a belief that mediates the relationship be-
tween the external stimuli provided by leader be-
haviors and the decision by subordinates to speak
up or remain silent. This argument is consistent
with the findings of Podsakoff and colleagues (Pod-
sakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990) that
trust in a leader (with trust defined similarly to
psychological safety, as the belief that one will not
be harmed by another) mediated the relationship
between that leader’s transformational behaviors
and subordinates’ provision of other (nonrisky) or-
ganizational citizenship behaviors. Specifically, we
predict:

Hypothesis 3. Perceived psychological safety
mediates the relationships between change-
oriented leader behaviors and subordinates’
improvement-oriented voice.

Subordinate Performance

As Ashford and colleagues (e.g., Ashford et al.,
1998) have noted, the performance level of a sub-
ordinate may be related to his/her willingness to
speak up. Better performers may believe they have
more credibility and hence be more likely to see
voice as a job responsibility rather than an optional
citizenship behavior. This argument is consistent
with prior research suggesting that employees with
higher self-esteem, often a correlate of perfor-
mance, are more confident of their ability to pro-
vide meaningful input, and therefore are more mo-
tivated to speak up (Brockner et al., 1998). Thus, a
subordinate’s performance level should be posi-

tively related to the frequency of speaking up with
improvement ideas. This does not mean, however,
that strong performers will be more likely than
poorer performers to speak up with ideas that chal-
lenge the status quo irrespective of contextual cues.
That is, the higher confidence of good performers
may reflect an ability to speak up successfully
when it appears such input is desired. Conversely,
poorer performers may lack the personal confi-
dence or job security to speak up in any context—
even when leaders provide cues that such action is
welcome. Poorer performers may also simply lack
enough commitment to their organization to be in-
fluenced by managerial attempts to increase their
provision of observations and ideas.

Additionally, strong performance, where subjec-
tively rated, may indicate better impression man-
agement skills and a greater sensitivity to contex-
tual cues as to what behaviors are welcomed or
frowned upon by those in power (Wayne & Liden,
1995). This view is consistent with arguments that
better performers are more skilled at monitoring the
external environment and subsequently adapting
their behaviors through self-presentation tactics
(Snyder & Copeland, 1989). In short, better per-
formers have likely been rated as performing well
because they are more attuned to contextual cues
about receptivity to actions like voice and more
skilled at tailoring and targeting their upward com-
munications on the basis of these cues. This anal-
ysis suggests that better performers should be even
more likely than others to speak up when their
bosses appear particularly interested in and con-
cerned about subordinates and willing to act on
suggestions from below. Conversely, better per-
formers may be more likely to withhold their opin-
ions and ideas or alter the content of messages (e.g.,
sugarcoat them) when cues from leaders are less
welcoming or even hostile. We therefore predict:

Hypothesis 4. The relationships between lead-
ers’ change-oriented behaviors and subordi-
nates’ improvement-oriented voice is stronger
for subordinates with high performance than
for subordinates with low performance.

To test Hypotheses 1– 4, we conducted two stud-
ies at “Serve-Co,” a corporation-owned chain of
casual dining restaurants. In Study 1, we tested
Hypotheses 1–3 on a sample of crew members
(servers, cooks, and hosts/hostesses); in Study 2,
we used longitudinal data from shift managers to
replicate the Study 1 findings and to test Hypoth-
esis 4. Both crew members and shift managers in-
teracted regularly with, and were evaluated by,
their restaurant’s general manager (GM).

STUDY 1

Data. We administered a self-report question-
naire to all crew members, each of whom was paid
for 30 minutes of time to fill out the survey during
a staff meeting. To protect confidentiality, we had
all surveys mailed directly to a survey administra-
tion firm for data entry, and employees could
choose to omit their employee identification num-
ber from the questionnaire. We received usable re-
sponses from 3,153 of the possible 4,998 crew
members in 105 restaurants, for a 63 percent net
response rate. Overall, we found nonrespondents to
be slightly younger (x¯ ⫽ 25.86, s.d. ⫽ 11.31) and of
shorter tenure (x¯ ⫽ 2.99, s.d. ⫽ 1.50) than respon-
dents (x¯ ⫽ 26.66, s.d. ⫽ 10.99, t ⫽ 2.68, p ⬍ .01, and
x¯ ⫽ 3.29, s.d. ⫽ 1.38,
t ⫽ 5.51, p ⬍ .001,
respectively).

Measures. We assessed the two facets of GM
behavior with items using a five-point response
scale (1, “never,” to 5, “always”). Openness was
assessed with three items from Ashford and col-
leagues’ (1998) top management openness scale
(␣ ⫽ .89). We measured transformational leader-
ship using three items for individualized consider-
ation and two items for inspirational motivation
(Bass & Avolio, 1990). As has prior research, we
combined these two subcomponents into an overall
measure of transformational leadership (five items;
␣ ⫽ .91).

Psychological safety was measured with three
items (␣ ⫽ .90) on a response scale ranging from
“strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5). We
adapted items from Edmondson’s (1999) psycho-
logical safety in teams measure to better tap the
individual-level assessment of psychological safety
in regard to speaking up; a sample item is, “It is safe
for me to speak up around here.”

We assessed voice to the GM using three items
(␣ ⫽ .90) answered on a five-point frequency scale
(1, “almost never, to 5, “almost always”). These
items were based on Van Dyne and LePine’s (1998)
prosocial voice measure, but we used items refer-
encing only verbal behavior and simplified all lan-
guage to a sixth-grade reading level. A sample item
is, “I give suggestions [to the GM] about how to
make this restaurant better.”

We used a variety of controls to account for al-
ternative explanations of employee voice. First,
several studies (e.g., LePine & Van Dyne, 1998)
have found that individual differences, including
personality and various demographic variables, in-
fluence voice. For instance, employees with longer
tenure may feel more comfortable speaking up than
newcomers (Stamper & Van Dyne, 2001). Data were

therefore collected on tenure, ethnicity, job type
(service or production), gender, hours worked per
week, and job shift. Crant (2003) identified proac-
tive personality as the strongest personality corre-
late of voice, so we used four items to assess this
construct (␣ ⫽ .81). Second, previous research has
shown that employee attitudes can influence em-
ployee voice (Rusbult et al., 1988), so we created a
two-item scale measuring overall satisfaction (␣ ⫽
.69). Finally, having ideas was assessed with two
items (␣ ⫽ .80). This last variable was important
because, although employee silence may relate to
contextual influences, it may also simply indicate a
lack of specific ideas for improvement (Frese, Teng,
& Wijnen, 1999). The items for proactive personal-
ity, overall satisfaction, and having ideas were
rated on a five-point “strongly disagree” (1) to
“strongly agree” (5) scale.

Analysis strategy. We employed multilevel anal-
yses to be able to explicitly model nonindepen-
dence resulting from restaurant membership (Rau-
denbush & Byrk, 2002). Using this approach, we
were able to estimate coefficients for the indepen-
dent variables at the individual level while ac-
counting
the
individuals
within restaurants.

We first examined the impact of all control vari-
ables on individual-level voice in a random coeffi-
cient model. Table 2 presents the results of multi-
level analyses for Study 1. As model 1 shows,
several demographic variables were significantly
related to voice. We entered the additional individ-
ual difference variables in model 2, and the signif-
icant change in the –2 log-likelihood statistic indi-

ness (t ⫽ 6.54, p ⬍ .001) and GM transformational
leadership (t ⫽ 5.99, p ⬍ .001) were positively
related to voice. The addition of the leadership
variables also produced a significant change in the
–2 log-likelihood statistic (⌬␹2 ⫽ 256.05, p ⬍ .001).
To test Hypothesis 3, we followed the four-step
test for mediation recommended by Baron and
Kenny (1986). The support found for Hypotheses 1
and 2 satisfied step 1. As required by step 2, we
found in model 4 that GM openness (t ⫽ 8.03, p ⬍
.001) and GM transformational leadership (t ⫽ 3.25,
p ⬍ .05) both had a significantly positive relation-
ship with safety. Satisfying step 3, we show that
safety is indeed positively related to employees’
voice behavior (t ⫽ 11.76, p ⬍ .001; see model 5).
Finally, we show in model 6 all leader behaviors
and safety perceptions predicting voice. Psycholog-
ical safety remains significant (t ⫽ 8.23, p ⬍ .001),
but both GM openness (t ⫽ 5.40, p ⬍ .001) and GM
transformational leadership (t ⫽ 5.56, p ⬍ .001)
also remain significant, indicating partial media-
tion. In addition to this four-step test, we also con-
ducted the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982) for both GM
openness and GM transformational
leadership.
Both mediational effects were significant (z ⫽ 6.18,
p ⬍ .001, and z ⫽ 2.54, p ⬍ .01, respectively). Thus,
in partial support of Hypothesis 3, safety percep-
tions partially mediated the relationship between
leader behaviors and subordinates’ voice.

In sum, in Study 1 we found voice to be posi-
tively associated with both GM openness (Hypoth-
esis 1) and transformational leadership (Hypothesis
2). Further, we found that psychological safety
plays a mediating role between leader behaviors
and subordinate voice (Hypothesis 3). However,
Study 1 was subject to possible common method
bias; we conducted a second study designed with a
time lag between collection of the independent
variables and voice to partially address this con-
cern. This approach strongly reduces single-source
bias (Ostroff, Kinicki, & Clark, 2002) and allows
more confidence that our results reflect causation
rather than correlation. Specifically, our aims in
Study 2 were to replicate the Study 1 findings using
longitudinal data and to test the moderating impact
of performance level (Hypothesis 4).

STUDY 2

Methods

Data. We collected data on shift managers from
270 Serve-Co restaurants using two surveys (both
administered as described in Study 1) and a survey
of each shift manager’s general manager (GM). A
time 1 survey of the shift managers provided most

of the independent variables, and a time 2 survey
administered ten months later provided the safety
and voice variables. Shift manager overall perfor-
mance ratings came from a separate survey of GMs
conducted one month after the time 1 shift manager
survey. To be usable in the Study 2 analyses, data
had to be matchable over all three surveys. Al-
though over 80 percent of the possible 853 shift
managers responded to the initial survey, we were
able to match only 335 records. This was not be-
cause of low response rates for the subsequent shift
manager and GM surveys (both were over 90 per-
cent), but rather because (1) shift supervisor turn-
over was approximately 50 percent annually, (2)
both shift managers and GMs relocated within the
company, resulting in missing performance ratings,
and (3) approximately 30 percent of shift managers
either declined to record or incorrectly noted their
ID numbers on one or both surveys. Of the 335
matched responses, a small number were unusable
because respondents did not answer all questions
used in the analyses, and others had to be elimi-
nated owing to GM turnover (the GM whose lead-
ership behaviors were rated at time 1 was not the
same as the GM to whom voice was directed at time
2). Thus, the final number of surveys usable in all
Study 2 analyses was 223, a net of 26 percent of the
time 1 shift managers.

Measures. With the exception that an additional
item was used to assess GM openness (namely,
“takes action on things brought up by me”), we
used the same measures of GM openness and GM
transformational leadership as in Study 1. For this
sample, the Cronbach’s alpha reliability (␣) for the
four GM openness items was .94, and for the five
transformational leadership items, it was .91. We
created a two-item scale for shift manager perfor-
mance comprised of the appropriate GM’s rating of
each manager’s “overall performance” and “pro-
motability.” Cronbach’s alpha for this measure,
which had rating options from “weak” (1) to “very
strong” (4), was .91.

Once again, we used multiple variables to control
for alternative explanations of employee voice. De-
mographic control variables included tenure, gen-
der, ethnicity, and job shift. We also included three
personality and dispositional controls, using the
same measures as in Study 1: proactive personality,
four items (␣ ⫽ .74); overall satisfaction, two items
(␣ ⫽ .70); and having ideas, two items (␣ ⫽ .82).
Lastly, we controlled for shift managers’ self-re-
ported time 1 voice to the GM (␣ ⫽ .89).

Psychological safety (three items, ␣ ⫽ .88) and
time 2 voice to the GM (four items, ␣ ⫽ .87) were
also measured as described in Study 1. Time 1 and

2 measures of voice (separated by ten months) were
assessed with the same items.

Results and Discussion

Confirmatory factor analyses again indicated that
the hypothesized factor structure fitted these data
well, better than any more parsimonious model.
Table 3 presents summary statistics for Study 2.

We followed an analytic strategy similar to that
of Study 1 by employing multilevel analyses. We
first entered the control variables and then tested
the hypotheses. Table 4 presents the results of mul-
tilevel analyses for Study 2. In model 1, we entered
the demographic variables. Only evening and night
job shifts surfaced as significant (t ⫽ –2.56, p ⬍ .05,
and t ⫽ –2.26, p ⬍ .05, respectively). Entering the
individual difference variables in model 2 signifi-
cantly increased the explanatory power of
the
model (⌬␹2 ⫽ 64.01, p ⬍ .001). However, only time
1 voice was significantly related to time 2 voice
behavior (t ⫽ 6.40, p ⬍ .001).

To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, we entered GM open-
ness and GM transformational
leadership into
model 3. In support of Hypothesis 1, GM openness
positively influenced time 2 voice (t ⫽ 2.31, p ⬍
.05). However, GM transformational leadership was
not significantly related to time 2 voice (t ⫽ – 0.32,
n.s.). To test Hypothesis 3, we again followed the
steps outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). Since

only Hypothesis 1 was supported (indicating com-
pliance with step 1), we only tested for mediation
with respect to GM openness. In step 2, we found a
significant relationship between GM openness and
safety (t ⫽ 2.98, p ⬍ .01; see model 4). In step 3, we
found a significant relationship between safety and
time 2 voice behavior (t ⫽ 4.94, p ⬍ .001; see model
5). Finally, in step 4, although safety remained
significantly related to time 2 voice behavior (t ⫽
4.23, p ⬍ .001), GM openness was no longer signif-
icantly related to time 2 voice (t ⫽ 1.45, n.s.), indi-
cating full mediation (see model 6). The Sobel test
also indicated that psychological safety mediated
the relationship between GM openness and time 2
voice behavior (t ⫽ 2.39, p ⬍ .05). Thus, in sum, we
again found support for Hypothesis 1 and partial
support for Hypothesis 3 but did not find support
for Hypothesis 2 in this sample.

We tested each of the leadership behavior by
subordinate performance moderating hypotheses
(Hypothesis 4) separately because the predicted un-
derlying relationships were similar, leading to high
multicollinearity between the interaction terms.
Model 7 shows the significance of the GM openness
by performance interaction (t ⫽ 2.59, p ⬍ .01), and
Figure 1 depicts the predicted relationships plotted
using the procedures outlined in Aiken and West
(1993). We found a similar pattern for the interac-
tions between GM transformational leadership and
performance (t ⫽ 1.97, p ⬍ .05; see model 8 and

Figure 2). Thus, in support of Hypothesis 4, we
found that the relationship between GM openness
and GM transformational leader behaviors and time
2 voice was stronger for managers with higher per-
formance than for managers with lower performance.
In sum, in Study 2 we introduced a time lag
between measurement of the leadership variables
and subordinate voice. We found that leader open-
ness (Hypothesis 1) again positively influenced
voice, even when controlling for prior level of
voice, but transformational leadership (Hypothesis
2) was no longer significantly related to voice. Also,
psychological safety again played a mediating role
between leader openness and subordinate voice
(Hypothesis 3). Finally, we found that performance
level moderated the influence of leader behaviors
on subsequent voice (Hypothesis 4) in such a way
that the impact of leader behavior was stronger for
better-performing subordinates.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

Drawing from extant leadership theory and voice
research, we investigated specific leadership be-
haviors as a contextual influence on subordinate
voice in two studies that controlled for differences

in individual personality, attitudes, and job demog-
raphy. The set of change-oriented leader behaviors
explained an additional 6 percent of the variance in
voice in Study 1 and an additional 2 percent in
Study 2, where we also controlled for subordinates’
previous levels of voice. The fact that employees’
prior levels of voice also accounted for some influ-
ence of leadership should speak to the robustness
of the influence of leadership. Indeed, if prior level
of voice is removed as a control in Study 2, the
leader behaviors account for 8 percent of the vari-
ance in subordinate voice.

In particular, we found management openness to
be the leader behavior most consistently related to
voice. We also found psychological safety to play a
mediating role in the leader behavior–voice rela-
tionship and found the influence of leader behav-
iors on voice to be more pronounced for subordi-
nates with high performance. Collectively, our
findings suggest that understanding voice behavior
requires not only an investigation of the stable in-
dividual characteristics that determine whether
people speak up, but also examination of to whom
they speak and why or why not they speak to that
specific target.

Theoretical Implications

This study extends previous voice research in
several ways. First, our results suggest that very
specific leader behaviors, rather than generically
positive or personalized behaviors, may be needed
to stimulate routine voice from subordinates. In
particular, behaviors that
indicate openness to
change and willingness to act on input from below
may be necessary to overcome employee restraint.
Conversely, even though we found significant bi-
variate correlations for transformational leadership
in both studies, our results for transformational
leadership were less consistent after we took sev-
eral controls into account, suggesting that some of
the behaviors comprising this construct may not
present a clear signal that voice is desired. For
example, some transformational leader behaviors
can be perceived as both empowering and confin-
ing (Kark, Shamir, & Chen, 2003). Further, a vocal,
motivational leader may be seen as egalitarian and
empowering (i.e., as demonstrating socialized cha-
risma) or as so dominant and convinced of the
rightness of his/her own ideas (i.e., demonstrating
personalized charisma) that others dare not offer
their own (House & Howell, 1992). Thus, in both of
our studies, both openness and transformational
leader behaviors are consistently positively related
to voice, but openness behaviors clearly send the
stronger signal that voice is welcome.

Our mediation findings for psychological safety
speak directly to the risk involved in challenging
the status quo via improvement-oriented voice.
Though a significant body of research explores the
influence of leadership on other organizational cit-
izenship behaviors, voice is unique because of the
risk involved in its perceived or actual challenge to
the status quo and those in power. Few authorities
are likely to resist subordinates’ extra-role “help-
ing” or “sportsmanship” behaviors, but authorities
may not like having “their” programs or policies
challenged from below and may see employees
who do so as rebellious (Frese & Fay, 2001; Van
Dyne & LePine, 1998). Precisely because voice can
be seen as counter-role rather than extra-role be-
havior (Staw & Boettger, 1990), this finding high-
lights the importance of leadership in creating a
psychological climate of safety for voice. That is,
leader behaviors are key inputs to employee assess-
ments about potential costs and benefits of speak-
ing up, which in turn affect ultimate voice or si-
lence behavior (Milliken et al., 2003; Ryan &
Oestreich, 1998).

In addition, our findings begin to demonstrate
the differential impact of leader behaviors on voice
for different types of employees. Future research

might assess whether the context-dependent mod-
ulation of voice behavior found for this study’s
better performers is based in emotional intelli-
gence, as recent research suggests that the abilities
to read a supervisor’s emotions and regulate one’s
own emotions may lead to higher performance
(Law, Wong, & Song, 2004). Future research might
also explore the types or level of solicitation
needed to stimulate useful discretionary contribu-
tions from all employees, including poorer per-
formers. Although the failure to secure the input of
poorer performers may seem of minimal conse-
quence, this view ignores the possibilities that (1)
current performance problems reflect punishments
for speaking up in the past, (2) performance can be
improved by stimulating employee involvement,
and (3) even poor performers notice problems and
opportunities for improvement.

Limitations and Future Research

Several limitations of this research should be
noted. First, we used perceptual data, because
leader influence rests ultimately on what subordi-
nates perceive their leaders to have done or been
like (Bandura, 1989) even though such perceptions
can be “objectively” wrong. Nonetheless, future re-
search should investigate the relationship between
leadership behaviors and subordinate voice using
data from multiple sources. Second, despite the
robustness of most of our findings over two sam-
ples and time periods, statements about generaliz-
ability must await the results of research in addi-
tional settings. Though in this context the effects of
the leadership variables were not particularly
strong beyond all the controls, our findings may
actually lie near the lower bound in the range of
magnitude for leadership behaviors as voice ante-
cedents. In the low-wage service sector context we
studied, where employees have limited financial
investment and can readily transfer their skills to
the store down the street, the effects of leadership
may be low compared to other factors, such as
personality, because employees are likely less con-
cerned about the consequences of offending their
bosses by speaking up. In contrast, a strong context
for leadership as an influence on voice behavior
could be one where employees are highly “cap-
tured”—for instance, they have high levels of firm-
specific skills, or low job or geographic mobility. In
these contexts, where employees likely have signif-
icantly greater job security fears, management
openness may be even more important. Future re-
search will benefit from explicit contrast of leader-
ship’s influence on voice in strong versus weak

contexts for such leadership effects (Bem & Allen,
1974).

Third, future research should also continue to
explore the dynamic relationships among leader
behavior, subordinate voice, and the other compo-
nents of subordinate behavior that factor into a
leader’s overall evaluation of each subordinate. Af-
ter all, a subordinate’s current overall performance
likely includes his/her manager’s reaction to prior
speaking up. To fully pinpoint causality, an ideal
study might sample new employees and track
leader behavior, voice, and performance data over
several periods. This would be important work be-
cause it is one thing to be less interested in the
comments of systematically poor performers and
another altogether to be disenfranchising and pun-
ishing to the very employees who offer the best
ideas for change. Finally, we note that additional
contextual determinants could be integrated into
future investigations of psychological safety and
voice. For example, since leaders also influence
subordinates indirectly through their control over
organizational policies and structures and their im-
pact on an overall culture or climate (Morrison &
Milliken, 2000), research that combines dyadic di-
rect effects with indirect leader effects would help
shed light on the overall contextual influences on
speaking up. Other factors to be further explored as
likely influences on the decision to speak up in-
clude the nature of work or industry and the degree
of demographic similarity between would-be
speakers and managerial targets of voice (Dutton et
al., 1997).

Managerial Implications

Our findings about the value of overt leader be-
havior in getting more employee ideas “on the ta-
ble” have important action implications. First, such
managerial behaviors should be measured, devel-
oped, and rewarded. For example, the types of be-
haviors found herein to influence voice could be
readily incorporated into the subordinate portion
of 360° feedback instruments and subsequent de-
velopmental and accountability programs. Such as-
sessments would help companies differentiate be-
tween managers who rely primarily on formal
mechanisms (e.g., suggestion systems) and es-
poused openness to input (e.g., an “open door”
policy) and those whose behavior explicitly wel-
comes voice. Further, employees at all levels are
likely to need training in both the delivery and
receipt of upward information. Although managers
are more accountable for setting the right tone for
voice and therefore need practice in nondefensive
listening and in communicating the rationale for

(non)action in response to voice, subordinates are
also partly responsible for effectively making issues
known in the first place. Poorer performers may be
particularly good candidates for communication
skill building because they may lack self-efficacy

actions represent difficult but important steps to-
ward helping managers receive and act on the up-
ward feedback they need for their organizations to
remain healthy.
