 NOTES

 Auditor Reputation and the Pricing

 of Initial Public Offerings

 Randolph P. Beatty

 ABSTRACT: It is hypothesized that an inverse relation exists between the reputation of the
 auditor of an initial public offering and the initial return earned by an investor. Specifically,
 clients that hire more reputable CPA firms should exhibit lower initial returns than clients that
 choose to hire CPA firms with less reputation capital at stake. Two proxies for auditor reputa-
 tion are used to test this hypothesis. The first reputation proxy uses indicator variables for
 auditor size. Results indicate that the widely used Big Eight/non-Big Eight classification may
 measure CPA firm reputation capital with error particularly for the smaller Big Eight and larger
 non-Big Eight firms. A second reputation proxy is developed by regressing compensation paid
 to the auditing firms on measures of marginal cost of performing the audit. The initial return
 to the IPO investors is regressed on the residual from the compensation regression to provide
 evidence of the reputation hypothesis. Results indicate that clients that pay a premium for
 their registration audit exhibit lower initial returns for their investors. Thus, the results of both
 tests provide support for the hypothesized inverse relation between auditor reputation and
 initial public offering initial return.

 A COMPANY "going public" must pro-
 vide a prospectus that includes a
 description of its present and fu-
 ture operations and audited financial
 statements. Since privately held firms
 face limited disclosure requirements, the
 market usually possesses less publicly
 available data from them than from
 comparable publicly traded firms. This
 difference in regulatory environment
 provides a potentially fruitful setting in
 which to consider the role of the public
 accountant.

 Since switching auditor just prior to
 going public is widely alleged, it is
 natural to investigate management's mo-
 tivation for such a change (see "Small

 The Accounting Review, October 1989

 CPA Concern Sues an Underwriter Over
 Loss of Client," The Wall Street Journal
 [July 18, 1983, p. 1]). Carpenter and
 Strawser [1971] describe the results of a
 survey of AICPA members concerning
 the displacement issue as follows:

 Almost universally, the reason expressed
 [for the change in auditors] was that the
 underwriters informed the client that a
 "nationally known firm" was necessary
 to sell their offering at the highest possi-
 ble price [p. 55].

 Section I draws from the previous em-

 pirical and theoretical literature to sug-
 gest testable assertions relating auditor
 reputation and the initial return to an
 IPO investor. Section II describes the
 data used in the empirical tests and pro-
 vides a number of descriptive statistics.
 Results of regression tests of the reputa-
 tion hypothesis are presented in Section
 III and, finally, Section IV concludes
 with a summary.

 This widely held view suggests that the
 employment of a "nationally known"
 audit firm will increase the price (reduce
 the initial return) received by the initial
 public offering (IPO) client.

 This paper presents and tests the hy-

 pothesis that audit firm reputation is in-
 versely related to the initial return earned
 by an IPO investor. The evidence is con-
 sistent with an inverse relation between
 auditor reputation and the initial return
 to the IPO investor. First, tests of linear
 restrictions of indicator variable coeffi-
 cients are interpreted within the tradi-
 tional Big Eight/non-Big Eight frame-
 work to suggest a negative relation
 between auditor reputation and initial
 return. A second partition (Largest-Five,
 Middle-Six, and Smallest-Nine audit
 firms) is introduced to provide evidence
 that ad hoc classification schemes may
 only crudely separate the set of audit
 firms by reputation capital. In particu-
 lar, it appears that smaller Big Eight and
 larger non-Big Eight firms exhibit sim-
 ilar reputations in the IPO market. To
 test the reputation hypothesis without
 relying on an ad hoc classification,
 reputation capital is inferred from the
 observation of auditor compensation.
 These tests use a measure of the residual
 compensation paid to the IPO auditing
 firm and provide the first direct evidence
 of the hypothesized reputation relation.

 I. UNDERPRICING AND THE ROLE OF THE

 AUDITING FiRM

 Previous studies of the IPO market
 have focused on an empirical phenom-
 enon that has been described as "under-
 pricing" of the firm's equity securi-
 ties. l,2 The term "underpricing" is used
 to describe the difference between the
 offering price and the market clearing
 price at issuance. Numerous empirical
 papers have demonstrated this persistent
 underpricing of equity securities [Ibbot-
 son, 1975; Ibbotson and Jaffee, 1975;
 and Ritter, 1984].

 Various asymmetric information mod-
 els have been proposed to explain this
 phenomenon. In one model, the invest-
 ment banker is "better informed" than
 the issuing firm as to the demand for the
 issuing firm's securities [Baron, 1982]. In
 another, two classes of IPO investors,
 informed and uninformed, are assumed
 to exist [Rock, 1982 and 1986; Beatty
 and Ritter, 1986]. In each of these mod-
 els, the investment banker or the unin-
 formed investors face uncertainty con-
 cerning the IPO firm value. The precision

 Smith [1986].

 2 Underpricing translates directly into the initial

 return, defined as the return earned by an investor buying
 at the offering price and selling at the first-day closing
 price. These terms will be used interchangeably in the re-
 mainder of this paper.

 of the distribution of uncertainty of firm
 value has been described as ex ante un-
 certainty [Beatty and Ritter, 19861. Both
 of these models imply that there is a
 positive relation between ex ante uncer-
 tainty and the underpricing of the IPO.
 Some investigators have argued in the
 agency literature that auditing services
 are demanded to reduce costs arising
 from conflicts of interests between
 owners and managers [Jensen and Meck-
 ling, 1976; Watts and Zimmerman,
 1983]. Since the nature and extent of
 agency costs vary across firms that at-
 tempt to minimize these costs, the audit-
 ing services demanded will be heteroge-
 neous. This heterogeneity may lead CPA
 firms to differentiate themselves on the
 basis of investment in reputation capital
 to facilitate the attestation function
 [Kinney, 1988].

 Simunic and Stein [1987] suggest that
 auditor product differentiation on the
 dimensions of control, credibility, and
 product line motivates management's
 auditor choice in the IPO market. They
 conclude that the form of the under-
 writer agreement, the proportion of
 common stocks held by outsiders after
 the IPO, and a measure of uncertainty
 are related to the choice of auditing firm.
 Beatty [1989] provides evidence consis-
 tent with Simunic and Stein [1987] that
 larger and less risky IPO clients tend to
 hire Big Eight audit firms. As in this
 study, preliminary evidence from indi-
 cator variable regressions suggested that
 auditor reputation might be related to
 underpricing.

 Titman and Trueman [1986] present a
 signalling model that results in auditor
 quality providing information useful to
 investors in assessing the value of the
 IPO firm. Two features of their model
 lead to signalling of the IPO firm's
 value. First, high quality auditors (or in-
 vestment bankers) are those individuals

 with a comparative advantage in estab-
 lishing the reported information variable
 that is related to the firm value. Second,
 the firm is required to pay a "price pre-
 mium" for this higher quality audit.3
 These two expected costs of hiring the
 high quality auditor exceed the expected
 benefits of misclassification for the low
 firm value IPOs. This cost-benefit rela-
 tion leads the entrepreneur to choose an
 audit firm that "signals" firm value to
 the market. Although this model does
 not consider the underpricing phenom-
 enon, a similar signalling environment is
 used here to hypothesize a relation be-
 tween auditor reputation and the under-
 pricing of an IPO.

 The firm's existing owners have an in-
 centive to minimize underpricing since it
 transfers wealth from them to the new
 investors.4 The literature suggests a di-
 rect relation between ex ante uncertainty
 and underpricing of the IPO [Baron,
 1982; Rock, 1982 and 1986; and Beatty
 and Ritter, 1986]. All firms (existing
 owners) have an incentive to disclose
 "low" ex ante uncertainty, giving rise to
 the classic "lemons" problem [Akerlof,
 1970]. However, firms whose ex ante un-
 certainty is in fact "high" have a greater
 incentive to misrepresent.

 One means of reducing the misrepre-
 sentation problem is to hire an agent
 who can credibly attest to the assertions
 contained in the audited financial state-
 ments [Kinney, 1988]. Auditors have an
 incentive to investigate and report devia-
 tions in application of accounting prin-
 ciples since their reputation capital is

 3 Klein and Leffler [19811 present a model of product
 quality variation that requires a price premium for the
 high quality product to assure its production.

 4 The "amount of money left on the table," the dif-
 ference between the offering price and the market clear-
 ing price multiplied by the number of shares in the IPO, is
 a measure of the wealth transferred from existing owners
 to new investors.

 reduced by expost revelation of errors or
 misstatements [Palmrose, 1988]. Since
 auditing firms that have invested more in
 reputation capital have greater incentives
 to reduce application errors, the infor-
 mation disclosed in the accounting re-
 ports audited by these firms will be more
 precise, ceteris paribus. This reduction in
 measurement error will allow uninformed
 investors to estimate more precisely the
 distribution of firm value. Since the high
 reputation auditor attests to a report that
 reduces uninformed investors' ex ante
 uncertainty, this comparative advantage
 will be priced in the market for audit ser-
 vices. Value-maximizing owners of the
 IPO firm will choose the auditing firm
 with reputation capital that equates the
 marginal benefit of less underpricing
 with the marginal cost of a higher quality
 audit.

 The preceding arguments have two im-
 plications. First, the initial return of an
 IPO will be inversely related to the repu-
 tation of the auditing firm attesting to
 the accounting reports. Second, the pre-
 mium paid for a high quality auditing
 firm will be inversely related to the initial
 return of the IPO client.

 II. DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE

 STATISTICS

 The data used in the empirical tests are
 drawn from the population of 2,567
 IPOs from 1975-1984. The final sample
 was reduced to 2,215.5 The main data
 sources for the variables are the IPO's
 registration statement and amendments
 and Going Public: The IPO Reporter
 (published weekly).

 The initial return for a firm going pub-
 lic is defined as the first day gross return
 to an investor who acquires a share and
 sells at the closing bid price on the first
 day of public trading.6 For 1975-1984,
 the average initial return is 22.1 percent.
 A test of the compensation premium

 implication of the reputation hypothesis
 requires a measure of the fee paid to the
 auditor. A proxy for this fee that is avail-
 able for the entire sample is the cash
 compensation. This measure includes
 auditing, printing, legal, and other mis-
 cellaneous fees (such as "Blue Sky" reg-
 istration fees). The average cash com-
 pensation for 1975-1984 is $218,929.

 Aftermarket standard deviation is pre-
 sented as an ex post proxy for ex ante
 uncertainty to assess cross-sectional dif-
 ferences in ex ante uncertainty for the
 sample. The aftermarket standard devia-
 tion is computed as the standard devia-
 tion of returns for the first 20 trading
 days excluding the initial return using
 bid prices. This measure is available for
 only 1,807 firms since the remaining
 firms were not listed on NASDAQ or
 another exchange. The average after-
 market standard deviation in the sample
 is .033.

 I Each IPO included in the final sample had initial re-
 turn, age, type of offering, gross proceeds, sales, book
 value of equity, and cash expenses (auditor fees, legal
 fees, and miscellaneous fees) available in their SI or S18
 registration statement or other publicly available
 sources. Regulation A registrations, small public offer-
 ings, were not included in this study due to data limita-
 tions. An initial public offering that is registered under
 Regulation A is significantly smaller than the average
 offering in this sample. Prior to 1978, the maximum
 amount raised in a Regulation A offer was $500,000.
 After 1978, the limit was raised to $1,500,000. Missing
 registration statements and the lack of an observable bid
 price (firms trading in the "pink sheets") account for the
 reduction in observations from 2,567 to 2,215.

 6 The first day closing price is not always available.
 The closing bid price is available for 1,499 of the IPOs
 within one day of the closing date. An additional 412 bid
 prices are available within one week of the closing date.
 Bid prices are available for 236 IPOs within a month of
 the closing date of the IPO. The remaining 68 firms' bid
 price is obtained within one year of the offering. For
 IPOs listed on NASDAQ (82.6 percent), the first avail-
 able closing bid price from the Daily Stock Price Record
 has been used to construct the initial return. Finally, 12.4
 percent of the IPOs in this study were not listed on
 NASDAQ. These firms required the use of other data
 sources to estimate the initial returns for these securities
 [Ritter, 19841.

 Table 1 presents selected descriptive
 statistics for audit firm IPO clients. The
 identified firms audited at least ten IPOs
 during the 1975-1984 period and the Big
 Eight firms audited 58 percent of the
 IPO clients.7 The statistical tests suggest
 a number of differences in IPO clients by
 Big Eight/non-Big Eight distinction.
 First, larger clients generally are audited
 by Big Eight firms.8 However, the tradi-
 tional Big Eight/non-Big Eight distinc-
 tion does not completely capture differ-
 ences in client size. In particular, Peat
 Marwick, Touche Ross, and Coopers
 & Lybrand clients exhibit similar mag-
 nitudes of median sales revenue as
 Laventhol Horwath, Seidman & Seid-
 man, and Alexander Grant clients.

 Panels A and B of Table 1 suggest that
 auditor compensation is larger for Big
 Eight audit firms relative to competing
 non-Big Eight firms.9 Aftermarket stan-
 dard deviation is smaller for Big Eight
 compared to non-Big Eight clients. Fi-
 nally, initial return is significantly
 smaller for Big Eight compared to non-
 Big Eight clients. These differences in
 risk and return suggest that clients of
 particular subsets of CPA firms may not
 be homogeneous with respect to ex ante
 uncertainty.

 III. UNDERPRICING, Ex Ante

 UNCERTAINTY, AND AUDITING FIRM

 REPUTATION

 firm is tested with an indicator variable
 for each of the 20 CPA firms auditing
 more than ten IPOs in the 1975-1984
 period, and the reputation hypothesis is
 evaluated by testing linear restrictions
 on the estimated coefficients of the Big
 Eight/non-Big Eight indicator vari-
 ables. 10 Finally, sensitivity of the results
 to the traditional Big Eight/non-Big
 Eight grouping is considered by alter-
 native groupings based on client size.

 The estimated model is:

 Initial Return,

 =a+b (Age of Clienti)

 + c (Type of Underwriting

 Contract)

 +d (Percentage of Ownership

 Offered)

 +e (Oil & Gas Indicatori)
 +f (Underwriter Reputation

 Indicator)

 +r (Auditing Firm (1-20) Indi-
 catori). (1)

 Indicator Variable Regression

 Client age is used as a control variable
 in the regression model (panel A of
 Table 2) since a longer operating history
 may provide market participants with in-

 7 This percentage is consistent with the 59 percent, 68
 percent, and 62 percent concentration ratios for publicly
 traded clients reported in Simunic [1980], Palmrose
 [1986], and Francis and Simon [1987].

 8 Book value of equity, age, gross proceeds, and net
 proceeds provide additional support for the notion that
 larger clients tend to be audited by Big Eight firms
 [Beatty, 1989].

 In this section, an indicator variable
 approach is used to test for a relation
 between auditing firm reputation and the
 underpricing of initial public offerings.
 The regression model controls for ex
 ante uncertainty (client age, type of
 underwriting contract, and percentage
 ownership offered in the IPO), indus-
 try affiliation (oil and gas indicator
 variable), and other reputation effects
 (underwriter indicator variable). The
 marginal impact of a particular CPA

 9 For a subsample of 1,276 IPOs (1981-1984), auditor

 fees for preparation of the registration document were
 collected from Part II of the registration statement. Typ-
 ically, this involves obtaining amendments to the regis-
 tration statement since the auditing fees are rarely sub-
 mitted with the final prospectus. The correlation between
 reported accounting fees (Part 2 of the prospectus) and
 cash compensation is .771, suggesting that the cash com-
 pensation (available for the entire sample) provides a
 reasonable proxy for the auditor's compensation for re-
 viewing the prospectus.

 '? Testing linear restrictions on estimated coefficients

 is described in Judge et al. [1980, pp. 61-62].

 formation concerning managerial pro-
 duction-investment decisions. This addi-
 tional information may allow investors
 to marginally reduce their estimate of ex
 ante uncertainty. The estimated coeffi-
 cient is negative and statistically signifi-
 cant at the .06 probability level. This
 result suggests that larger client age indi-
 cates lower ex ante uncertainty.11

 The second control variable is the type
 of underwriting contract, firm commit-
 ment or best efforts. 12 The type of
 underwriter agreement may provide a
 proxy for the underwriter's assessment
 of the price uncertainty for an IPO. The
 type of offering (best efforts =0, firm
 commitment =1) is inversely related to
 the initial return for the IPO at the .0001
 probability level. This result is consistent
 with lower ex ante uncertainty for firm
 commitment underwriting contracts.

 Research by Leland and Pyle [1977]
 and Downes and Heinkel [1982] suggests
 that the percent ownership retained by
 insiders signals private information
 possessed by the owner/manager to in-
 vestors. The percentage offered by
 owners in the IPO is positively related to
 the initial return at the .04 level con-
 sistent with Leland and Pyle's model.

 Table 2 reports two final indicator
 variable coefficients for each regression.
 The oil and gas indicator variable (oil
 and gas = 1, others =0) is considered
 since Ritter [1984] observes a significant
 association between industry affiliation
 and initial return during the "Hot Issue"
 market of 1980. Panel A of Table 2
 shows that, as in the previous study, oil
 and gas IPOs exhibit significant positive
 initial returns."3 The underwriter indi-
 cator variable controls for underwriter
 reputation. Beatty and Ritter [1986]
 argue that underwriter reputation is re-
 lated to the level of underpricing of an
 initial public offering. This study uses an
 indicator variable (top 18 = 1, others = 0)

 for the 18 largest underwriters by total
 capital that are members of the Secu-
 rities Industry Association. 14 The under-
 writer indicator variable regression co-
 efficient is significant at the .03 level.

 Panel B of Table 2 summarizes the in-
 dicator variables for the 20 identified
 CPA firms. Four CPA firm indicator
 variables are positive and significant at
 the .05 level. They are Fox, Fox & Co.;
 Hein & Sikora; McGladrey, Hendrickson
 & Co.; and Allen Roth. Clients of these
 four non-Big Eight firms exhibited sig-
 nificantly higher initial returns than
 those of other auditors.

 Two sets of tests of linear combina-
 tions of the coefficients of the CPA firm
 indicator variables are presented in panel
 C of Table 2. First, the traditional Big
 Eight/non-Big Eight dichotomy is inves-
 tigated. The second is partitioned based
 upon the largest-five, middle-six, and

 " It has been suggested in Manegold [1987] that dis-

 tinguishing between startup and operating firms may
 control for client risk. In unreported regressions, a
 startup/operating indicator variable replaced the age
 variable. The results were consistent with the reported
 results and the startup/operating variable was not
 significant.

 12 A "firm commitment" underwriting agreement

 specifies that the underwriter purchases the shares from
 the client to be offered for resale. In a "best efforts"
 underwriting arrangement, an underwriter agrees to
 place as many securities as a "best effort" permits.

 13 Elimination of the oil and gas firms from the sample

 does not alter any of the inferences of the tests. Also, an
 indicator variable for "high tech" firm was considered

 14 The Securities Industry Association is an organiza-
 tion that lobbies for members' interests. Membership is
 restricted to "reputable" securities industry members.
 As with other voluntary organizations, the definition of
 reputable member of the securities industry is not well-
 defined. The SIA has summarized the capital ranks for
 their membership in an annual publication, Securities
 Industry Yearbook. The top 18 underwriters have been
 assigned to the "highly" reputable category for pur-
 poses of the underwriter indicator variable. The top 18
 underwriters capital as of January 1, 1985 exceeded
 $200,000,000. Alternative classifications of underwriter
 reputation by capital rank did not appreciably change the
 qualitative results.

 reputation capital. A two-stage approach
 estimates an auditor compensation re-
 gression with observable independent
 variables. Then the residuals from the
 first regression are used as a proxy for
 the unobservable variable, reputation
 capital. The relation between the resid-
 ual of the estimated auditor compensa-
 tion regression and the unobservable
 reputation variable is illustrated and
 then the "omitted variables" formula-
 tion is applied to test the reputation hy-
 pothesis.

 A compensation regression model that
 does not include the omitted variable can
 be estimated as follows:

 Cash Comp,

 = a1 + b1 (Gross Proceeds,)

 +c1 (Sales1)
 +d1 (Equityi)+ui.5 (2)

 However, the reputation hypothesis as-
 serts that the correct specification of the
 regression equation is:

 Cash Compi

 =a1* +b * (Gross Proceeds )

 +c1* (Salesi)
 +dd* (Equityi)
 +e,* (Ri)+vi. (3)

 Panel C reports tests of the linear re-
 strictions on the coefficients of the Big
 Eight and non-Big Eight indicator vari-
 ables. The results indicate significant dif-
 ferences in initial return based upon the
 Big Eight/non-Big Eight distinction. The
 trichotomous partition tests indicate that
 the middle-six CPA firms are more simi-
 lar to the largest-five CPA firms than to
 the smallest-nine CPA firms. This sensi-
 tivity analysis suggests that the tradi-
 tional Big Eight/non-Big Eight distinc-
 tion may measure reputation with error
 since the smallest Big Eight and largest
 non-Big Eight appear to exhibit substan-
 tial similarities. Finally, the correlation
 matrix (not reported) indicates that cor-
 relations across covariates are small (all
 less than .32) and, thus, multicollinearity
 is not expected to affect the results.

 These results provide evidence of a
 relation between auditor classification
 and the initial return. However, inter-
 preting these results as consistent with a
 relation between reputation and initial
 return requires the maintained hypoth-
 esis that a particular partition, such as
 the traditional Big Eight/non-Big Eight
 distinction, captures differences in firm
 reputation capital. Since choice of an
 appropriate partition is rather ad hoc, an
 alternative approach that does not rely
 on arbitrary classifications to test the
 reputation hypothesis is considered in
 the next subsection.

 If one assumes that the omitted variable,
 R (a firm's reputation capital), is un-
 correlated with the other independent
 variables, the sign of the correlation be-
 tween the estimated residual and the
 omitted variable is directly related to the
 sign of e1*. Formally, this correlation is:

 Two-Stage Regression Approach

 There are two salient features of the
 reputation hypothesis that suggest the
 use of an omitted variables technique to
 establish a proxy for reputation. First, a
 firm's reputation capital is unobserv-
 able. Second, the reputation hypothesis
 implies that the IPO client is charged a
 premium for employing the auditor's

 sation regression are intended to proxy for the marginal
 cost of the audit. Omitted variables analysis is discussed
 in Kmenta [1986], pp. 392-395.

 the reputation hypothesis.

 charged a premium for the auditor's
 reputation, the sign of the omitted vari-
 able coefficient, e1*, is positive. Thus, u,
 from equation (2) provides a measure
 that is positively correlated with the vari-
 able of interest. The second-stage regres-
 sion relates the initial return to the con-
 trol variables and the residual from the
 compensation regression as follows:

 Initial Returni

 =a2+b2 (Age of Clients)

 + c2 (Type of Underwriting

 Contract ,)

 +dd2 (Percentage of Ownership

 Offered)

 +e2 (Oil & Gas Indicator,)
 +f2 (Underwriter Reputation

 Indicator,)

 +r2 (Ui). (5)

 Table 3 presents results of the two-
 stage least squares approach used to
 assesss the relation between audit firm
 reputation and initial return. In the first
 stage, auditor compensation is regressed
 on three size variables, gross proceeds,
 sales revenue, and book value of equity.
 The residual from the regression should
 be interpreted as the price paid to a par-
 ticular audit firm above or below the
 average price paid for auditor reputation.
 The average price paid for reputation is
 imbedded in the constant term in equa-
 tion (2). From the analysis in Section II,
 as the price paid for the CPA firm's repu-
 tation capital is increased, less "money
 is left on the table" in the form of under-
 pricing, which suggests an inverse rela-
 tion with initial return. The reputation
 hypothesis predicts that the coefficient
 on the residual auditor compensation
 variable will be negative in the second
 stage regression.

 Sales revenue, book value of equity,

 and gross proceeds provide proxies for
 the size variables that have been found
 by previous studies to be related to
 auditor compensation. Although these
 three measures are different from the in-
 dependent variables suggested by previ-
 ous researchers of auditor compensation
 [Simunic, 1980; Mayer et al., 1985; and
 Francis and Simon, 19871, they provide
 similar control for the marginal cost of
 performing an audit. For instance, in-
 creased sales revenue can be expected to
 be directly related to increased inven-
 tories and accounts receivable. In addi-
 tion, one would expect that larger firms
 (measured by book value of equity and
 gross proceeds) would more likely ex-
 hibit more consolidated subsidiaries,
 two-digit SIC codes, and foreign opera-
 tions. It should be noted that the
 R-squared for equation (2) of Table 3 is
 .18, which is comparable to Simunic's
 less-than-$125,000,000 regression results
 of .28. However, the results of this anal-
 ysis rest on the assumption that any
 missing variables are uncorrelated with
 the initial return of the IPO.

 The coefficients for gross proceeds
 and sales revenue in panel A of Table 3
 are positive and significantly related to
 cash compensation," suggesting that as
 the size of the IPO client increases the
 total payment to auditor, lawyer, and
 printing fees increases (see Simunic
 [1980] and Mayer et al. [19851).

 Panel C of Table 3 provides average
 and median residuals from equation (2)
 that suggest Big Eight firms are being

 16 Panel B of Table 3 discloses relatively higher corre-

 lations between sales, book value of equity, and gross
 proceeds than any other correlations of other indepen-
 dent variables. Thus, the estimated coefficients in equa-
 tion (2) should be viewed with caution. This high level of
 multicollinearity may explain the negative and signifi-
 cant coefficient on stockholders' equity. The purpose of
 this regression is merely to filter out the size related costs
 of performing an audit, not to emphasize the magnitudes
 of the coefficients in equation (2).

 premium is significantly larger for the
 middle-six than for the smallest-nine
 audit firms. This substantial variation in
 premiums suggests that, within the his-
 torical Big Eight/non-Big Eight classifi-
 cation, audit firms may not be homoge-
 neous [Kinney, 1986]. Again, these
 results suggest that the traditional Big
 Eight/non-Big Eight distinction for
 reputation capital may suffer from sub-
 stantial measurement error.

 In the second stage regression, the re-
 siduals from equation (2) and the control
 variables are regressed on the initial re-
 turn. 17 Table 3 results are similar to the
 indicator variable regression results for
 each of the control variables. The coeffi-
 cient on the residuals from equation (2)
 is significantly negatively related to the
 initial return at the .003 level (one-
 tailed). For payments to the auditor
 above that predicted by equation (2), the
 initial return will be lower, ceteris pari-
 bus. 18 These results provide direct evi-
 dence of a positive relation between the
 compensation paid to an auditor and the
 wealth of the incumbent owners of a
 client. This evidence is consistent with
 the proposition that an IPO client hires
 the reputation capital of an auditing firm
 to "signal" its ex ante uncertainty to
 IPO investors.

 The two-stage least squares method pro-
 vides a direct test of the relation between
 the cost (auditor fees) and the benefit
 (lower initial return) of this signal.

 IV. CONCLUSIONS

 It has been argued that the auditor
 performs the role of attesting to the level
 of ex ante uncertainty faced by the IPO
 investor. Since owners of the IPO firm
 choose an auditor from a set of com-
 peting CPA firms, value-maximizing
 owners will choose to employ a particu-
 lar CPA firm's reputation capital when
 the marginal benefit equates to the mar-
 ginal cost.

 It was conjectured that a marginal
 benefit of employing a more reputable
 audit firm is an increase in the price ob-
 tained by the firm that offers the IPO
 ceteris paribus. The descriptive results
 suggest that the assumption of homoge-
 neity in ex ante uncertainty does not hold
 for particular subsets of IPOs. Larger
 and less risky clients were audited by Big
 Eight firms. Although this result is not
 new [Simunic and Stein, 1987; Beatty,
 1989], the cross-sectional tests of the
 reputation hypothesis necessitate control
 for differences in client ex ante uncer-
 tainty there are unrelated to auditor
 reputation.

 Signalling models (e.g., Downes and
 Heinkel [1982] and Titman and Trueman
 (1986]) rely on the firm signalling infor-
 mation to the market by undertaking a
 costly activity that cannot be duplicated
 by firms not possessing the signalled
 characteristic. In the market for IPOs,
 firms appear to signal their ex ante
 uncertainty by hiring a "nationally
 known" CPA firm to perform the
 registration audit. This "signal" is credi-
 ble to the market since auditor compen-
 sation is higher ceteris paribus for those
 firms that are commonly viewed as ex-
 hibiting firm-specific reputation capital.

 Two separate methods of considering
 auditor reputation were considered.
 First, a positive relation between four
 non-Big Eight firm indicator variables
 and the IPO's initial return was docu-
 mented. The analysis of linear restric-

 17 An unreported two-stage least squares model using

 reported auditor fees from Part II of the registration
 statement for the 1982-1984 subperiod is consistent with
 the Table 3 model results. These results are available on
 request.

 18 The second stage of the two-stage least squares

 model was analyzed employing a bootstrap technique
 [Marais, 1984]. Inferences from the probability levels of
 observing the OLS coefficients with this resampling
 technique are unchanged.

 The Accounting Review, October 1989

 tions implies that there are significant
 differences in the relation between the
 initial return and various subsets of audit
 firms. With the maintained hypothesis
 that the Big Eight/non-Big Eight dichot-
 omy or largest-five/middle-six/smallest-
 nine firm trichotomy proxy for differ-
 ences in firm-specific reputation capital,
 the results are consistent with the repu-
 tation hypothesis. An omitted variables
 method that measures reputation as the
 amount of auditor compensation unex-
 plained by measures of the marginal cost
 of performing the audit was applied. It
 shows that the residual from the auditor
 compensation regression is positively
 correlated with the unobservable audit-
 ing firm reputation capital. The results
 of the two-stage least squares approach
 provide stronger and more direct evi-
 dence of a relation between auditor repu-
 tation and the initial return than the
 traditional indicator variable approach.
 In both approaches, an omitted vari-

 ables problem may produce errors in in-
 ference. For the indicator variable ap-
 proach, an omitted variable may explain
 the relation between the four firms and
 the initial return. The two-stage regres-
 sion approach is based upon the notion
 that the residual from the first regression
 captures the unobservable reputation
 variable. An omitted variable in the
 underpricing regression that is positively
 related to both the auditor's unexplained
 compensation and the underpricing of
 the IPO may explain the observed rela-
 tion. This omitted variables problem
 should temper the interpretation of the
 results of this test of reputation. Despite
 this limitation, the relation observed in
 the indicator variable approach and the
 results provided by the residual approach
 suggest that hiring of a "nationally
 known" audit firm is related to less
 underpricing of an initial public offering
 of equity securities.
