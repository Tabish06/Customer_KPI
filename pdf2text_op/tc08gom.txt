Influence of Compensation 
Strategies in Canadian 
Technology-Intensive 
Firms on Organizational and 
Human Resources Performance

This study examines the role of technological intensity in the choice of com-
pensation policies and the influence of such policies on organization (market,
productivity) and human resources performance (turnover, work climate, dis-
cretionary efforts). Using a survey of 252 Canadian firms, the authors show that
technological intensity has a significant influence on compensation policies.
A second survey of 128 Canadian organizations also demonstrates that techno-
logical intensity has a significant moderating effect on the association between
several  compensation  policies  and  both  human  resources  and  organizational
performance.  More  specifically, the  authors  find  that  greater  emphasis  on
group performance plans and market pay is positively associated with produc-
tivity in high-technology firms. Extensive use of individual performance pay
plans in high-technology firms is positively associated with turnover, whereas
the use of group performance plans is negatively related to turnover.

the  past  decade  (Gerhart  &  Rynes, 2003;  Rynes  &  Gerhart, 2000).
Researchers have argued that compensation policies can improve the per-
formance of organizations only when such policies are consistent with orga-
nizational contingencies (Gerhart, 2000). Although business strategies have
been  the  principal  topic  of  interest  in  the  compensation  field  (Balkin  &
Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Boyd & Salamin, 2001; Chênevert & Tremblay, 2002;
Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992; Montemayor, 1996), increasing attention has
been directed at other contingencies, particularly the role of technological
intensity  in  the  influence  of  compensation  policies.  Several  studies  have
shown that high-technology companies tend to develop compensation strate-
gies that are contingent on or congruent with their particular context (Balkin
& Gomez-Mejia, 1984; Balkin, Markman, & Gomez-Mejia, 2000; Diaz &
Gomez-Mejia, 1997; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1989; Gomez-Mejia, Balkin,
& Welbourne, 1990; Milkovich, Gerhart, & Hannon, 1991; Shaw, Gupta, &
Delery, 2001; Tremblay & Chênevert, 2005; Yanadori & Marler, 2006).

Although these studies have produced interesting results, they have also
been marred by a number of limitations. First, with few exceptions (e.g.,
Diaz & Gomez-Mejia, 1997; Tremblay & Chênevert, 2005), research has
been limited to the U.S. high-technology industry. Recent studies on cross-
cultural comparisons of reward preferences (Chiang, 2005) have revealed
that  although  some  countries  share  many  reward  preference  similarities,
divergent reward preferences among countries have been observed. By using
a non-U.S. sample of firms, namely a sample of 252 Canadian organizations,
this study offers the opportunity to improve our knowledge of cross-national
compensation policies and to validate the relevance of technological intensity
in the design of compensation systems.

Second, apart  from  Diaz  and  Gomez-Mejia  (1997)  and  Tremblay  and
Chênevert (2005), researchers have investigated a limited number of dimen-
sions of firm-level compensation systems and have ignored the role of admin-
istrative  compensation  decisions, namely  the  influence  of  the  degree  of
decentralization and pay openness. The organizational justice literature reveals
that perceptions of administrative and procedural compensation components
(e.g., consultation, information, transparency) may have a greater influence
on employee attitudes and behaviors than compensation decisions related to
pay level and to the design of total compensation (Cohen-Charash & Spector,
2001; Mulvey, LeBlanc, Heneman, & McInerney, 2002). By evaluating mul-
tiple  dimensions  of  firm-level  compensation  policies  (internal  vs.  market
equity, lead vs. lag market, fixed vs. variable pay, individual vs. collective
performance, centralization  vs.  decentralization, and  pay  openness  vs.  pay
secrecy), we can paint a more accurate picture of the overall compensation
strategies of firms (Gerhart, 2000; Yanadori & Marler, 2006).

Third, no research to our knowledge has examined the influence of com-
pensation decisions related to exempt and nonexempt employees on differ-
ent organizational and human performance indicators. We believe that using
only one of these dimensions may partly evince the role of compensation
decisions  in  organizations.  Compensation  decisions  sometimes  have  a
direct influence on human resource performance indicators and an indirect
influence on organizational performance criteria (Currall, Towler, Judge, &
Kohn, 2005; Wright, Gardner, & Moynihan, 2001). By investigating a variety
of human resources (HR) performance indices (turnover, work climate,
discretionary efforts) and organizational performance indicators (productivity,
market  performance), we  can  gain  insight  into  the  role  of  compensation
policies in enhancing the performance of firms.

Finally, past  research  (Diaz  &  Gomez-Mejia, 1997;  Gomez-Mejia  &
Balkin, 1989; Tremblay & Chênevert, 2005; Yanadori & Marler, 2006) has
exclusively relied on a cross-sectional study design to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of pay policies, thereby introducing a high potential for common
method variance error. By using a two-wave measurement process, we can
reduce the bias inherent in the mono-method approach, which has under-
mined a large portion of the studies conducted in this field.

Theory and Hypotheses

Technology-intensive companies have several characteristics that differ-
entiate them from traditional enterprises, namely (a) a product that is highly
advanced technologically, (b) greater priority on research and development,
(c)  frequent  innovations, (d)  high  geographic  concentration  (e.g., Boston,
Nice, Toulouse, Sun Valley), (e) a high mortality rate owing to competitive
pressures (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1985), (f) a relatively high percentage
of  scientists  and  engineers  in  the  workforce, and  (g)  an  abnormally  high
turnover rate among technical personnel (Cardy & Dobbins, 1995; Gomez-
Mejia, Balkin, &  Milkovich, 1990;  Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, &  Welbourne,
1990; Milkovich et al., 1991; Mohrman & Von Glinow, 1990; Rogers, 2001).
Given the particular nature of the high-technology industry, a contingency
perspective  suggests  that  technology-intensive  companies  and  traditional
organizations  use  different  compensation  policies  (Rogers, 2001).  In  fact,
job opportunities in the high-technology sector increase the external mobil-
ity opportunities of knowledge workers. This in turn forces organizations
in  the  sector  to  adopt  compensation  policies  to  retain  their  most  critical
employee groups (Balkin & Bannister, 1993). Of interest, a recent study of


272 Group & Organization Management

the high-technology industry revealed a strong negative association between
employee turnover and revenue growth (Baron, Hannan, & Burton, 2001).
In addition, given the importance of innovations in this industry, it is proba-
bly more imperative for high-tech firms than traditional ones to implement
rewards  to  encourage  and  sustain  collaborative  behaviors, such  as  knowl-
edge sharing (Bartol & Srivastava, 2002). In addition, the behavioral control
mechanisms used in traditional firms are unlikely to correspond to the pref-
erences of knowledge workers, who value financial control mechanisms that
offer the opportunity to share in the success of the firm and that take into
account  the  uncertainty  of  their  contributions  (Rogers, 2001; Yanadori  &
Marler, 2006).

Internal Versus External Equity

Whether the firm develops an internal or an external compensation policy
depends on the extent to which the organization places more emphasis on
meeting market prices for labor (e.g., external equity) than on maintaining
consistency  in  the  pay  structure  (e.g., internal  equity)  (Gomez-Mejia  &
Balkin, 1992). Firms thereby establish their compensation through market
comparisons, often by means of wage surveys or based on the relative value of
jobs within the organization (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992; Milkovich &
Newman, 1996).

Designing a pay structure often requires both a detailed analysis of jobs
and a job evaluation system. This traditional approach, described as bureau-
cratic  and  rigid  (Lawler, 1994;  Tremblay  &  Sire, 1999), should  be  more
appropriate and effective in organizations that operate in stable technological
and general environments (Diaz & Gomez-Mejia, 1997). Some authors have
argued  that  a  strategy  heavily  oriented  toward  internal  equity  hinders  and
constrains  the  decision-making  process  and  creates  multiple  bureaucratic
structures  (Diaz  &  Gomez-Mejia, 1997).  In  contrast, technology-intensive
organizations must be sufficiently agile and flexible to rapidly respond to sev-
eral  factors  such  as  personnel  shortages, intense  competition  in  recruiting
technical specialists, and substantial wage fluctuations in the market. In one
of the few studies regarding the role of internal versus market policy orienta-
tions, Yuen (1990) observed that high-technology firms were more engaged
in labor market and wage surveys and carried out more job evaluation and pay
structure design activities than medium-technology firms. Diaz and Gomez-
Mejia  (1997)  found  that  a  compensation  policy  that  emphasizes  market
equity  is  more  apparent  in  technology-intensive  firms. All  of  the  above
considerations lead us to formulate the following hypotheses:


Tremblay, Chênevert / Compensation Strategies

273

Hypothesis 1a: Technological intensity is positively related to the adoption

of a market-oriented compensation policy.

Hypothesis 1b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship
between the adoption of a market-oriented compensation policy and firm
performance.

Lead Versus Lag Pay Policy

The market pay policy dimension refers to the extent to which the firm’s
compensation package meets or exceeds that of its competitors. Positioning
a pay policy in relation to the market is considered a strategic compensation
decision  (Gomez-Mejia  &  Welbourne, 1988).  Firms  may  decide  to  lead,
match, or lag behind the market. As Klass and McClendon (1996) asserted,
some  organizations  adopt  a  lag  pay  position  in  the  belief  that  lower  wage
costs will more than offset any effect this would have on their ability to attract
and retain qualified employees. Other organizations may reject this strategy,
believing  that  the  costs  of  providing  competitive  or  even  above-average
wages are offset by the benefits of a more qualified workforce.

For technology-intensive firms, the capacity to attract and retain the most
qualified technical personnel and innovators is crucial (Milkovich et al., 1991).
Indeed, human  capital, in  particular  employee  knowledge, represents  an
important asset in such firms and is one of the main competitive advantages
(Barney, 1991). To retain this valuable asset, an employer may be more moti-
vated to provide rewards equivalent to or greater than the rewards provided in
the general labor market (Snell & Dean, 1992). Efficiency wage theory sug-
gests that a higher pay level reduces the probability of dysfunctional behaviors
such as shirking and low productivity because employees would wish to avoid
disciplinary  sanctions  that  could  lead  to  job  loss  (Gerhart  &  Rynes, 2003).
According to organizational support theory (Eisenberger, Armeli, Rexwinkel,
Lynch, & Rhoades, 2001), employees are motivated to repay this favorable
treatment by increasing their performance and loyalty. All of the above
considerations lead us to formulate the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 2a: Technological intensity is positively related to the adoption

of a lead compensation policy.

Hypothesis 2b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship
between the adoption of a lead compensation policy and firm performance.

Fixed Versus Variable Pay

This  dimension  of  compensation  policy  states  that  organizations  can
choose between paying employees the same amount on a predictable basis


274 Group & Organization Management

or providing a substantial portion of income on a variable basis (Gomez-
Mejia & Balkin, 1992). A fixed pay system implies that pay increases are
applied across the board, are based on membership within the organization,
and are built into base pay (Heneman, 2001). Variable pay plans refer to
payments that are based on objective or quantitative assessments of indi-
vidual, group, or company performance and are not added to the base salary
(Konrad & Deckop, 2001).

From  an  agency  theory  perspective, Milkovich  et  al.  (1991)  posit  that
R&D-intensive firms are more subject to owner–manager information asym-
metry problems such as the costs of behavioral monitoring and measuring
outcomes. In addition, high-technology jobs are not highly programmable,
nor are the outcomes readily measurable (Mohrman & Von Glinow, 1990).
Agency  research  has  found  that  when  tasks  are  weakly  programmable, a
high level of variable pay is recommended to align the interests of workers
with  those  of  the  principal  (Eisenhart, 1988;  Tremblay, Côté, &  Balkin,
2003). In addition, resorting to a variable pay policy will attract people with
a high tolerance for risk who are comfortable with the uncertainty of out-
puts. This is precisely the profile that technology-intensive firms are looking
for and want to retain (Gerhart & Rynes, 2003; Yanadori & Marler, 2006).
In accordance with this view, some studies have observed a greater usage of
variable pay plans in high-technology firms than in traditional firms (Balkin
& Gomez-Mejia, 1984; Diaz & Gomez-Mejia, 1997; Milkovich et al., 1991;
Yanadori & Marler, 2006).

However, to our knowledge, only Diaz and Gomez-Mejia (1997) have
tested the influence of variable pay in the technological industry on a sample
of nonexempt employees. The authors demonstrated that variable compen-
sation plans are positively related to pay policy effectiveness when techno-
logical intensity is high. All of the above considerations lead us to formulate
the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3a: Technological intensity is positively related to the adoption

of a variable compensation policy.

Hypothesis 3b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship

between variable compensation policy and firm performance.

Compensation and Individual Performance

An individual contingent rewards policy is the extent to which reward
distribution is pegged to individual performance. Several specialists have
proposed that compensation is linked to individual performance (Heneman,
1992), primarily based on findings that suggest that participants exert more


Tremblay, Chênevert / Compensation Strategies

275

effort when they perform alone than when they perform with others (Shepperd,
1993). The challenge of retaining the most critical resources in a market
often characterized by shortages increases the relevance of rewarding indi-
vidual performance (Appelbaum, 1991) as does the goal of motivating the
most  effective  employees.  As  technology-intensive  firms  recruit  highly
skilled workers, the performance of employees with low and high motivation
may vary considerably.

It has been suggested, however, that a critical success factor in high-
technology firms is the capacity to promote collaborative knowledge shar-
ing (Rogers, 2001). A strong emphasis on rewarding individual performance
may  motivate  employees  to  maximize  their  own  personal  interests  rather
than fostering necessary cooperation with colleagues in team projects. These
arguments suggest that technology-intensive firms should be less inclined
than traditional ones to use individual incentive pay plans.

Research findings are mixed regarding the impact of individual incentive
systems on performance in high-technology firms. As regards the impact of
fit between technology and individual incentives on effectiveness, Shaw
et al. (2001) could not find support for their hypothesis that advanced man-
ufacturing technology and individual incentives interact, resulting in lower
effectiveness.  Bamberger, Bacharach, and  Dyer  (1989)  and  Gomez-Mejia
and Balkin (1989) did not find a significant relationship between the use
of systematic merit-based compensation systems and firm performance in
high-technology  firms.  Zenger  (1992)  described  a  lower  rate  of  turnover
among  extremely  high-performing  engineers  and  higher  turnover  for  the
extremely  low-performing  engineers  in  high-technology  firms  that  offer
merit-based compensation. These contradictory arguments and results imply
that significant differences should not be observed regarding the importance
and influence of individual performance-based pay policies between high-
technology and traditional firms.

Compensation and Group Performance

Group or team compensation policy is the reliance on group contribution
as a basis for the distribution of rewards. The payoff that individuals receive
depends on their performance and on that of their coworkers (Gomez-Mejia
& Balkin, 1992). Balkin and Bannister (1993) argued that technical staff
compensation should mainly consist of salary and team bonuses in organi-
zations  in  which  a  large  proportion  of  expenses  are  allocated  to  R&D.
Significant  resources  assigned  to  research  and  development, along  with
great uncertainty surrounding survival and growth, require maintaining an


276 Group & Organization Management

acceptable level of liquidity and reducing fixed costs. Group-based perfor-
mance pay programs thus represent a logical means to control HR costs and
to align the interests of employees with those of the firm.

Generally, researchers have found that group bonuses are more prevalent
in high-technology firms (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1984; Diaz & Gomez-
Mejia, 1997) and that aggregate compensation programs are more positively
related to the effectiveness of compensation policies in a high-technology
context (Diaz & Gomez-Mejia, 1997; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1989) and
in firms that make extensive use of computer-aided technologies (Shaw
et al., 2001). In a study of 1,109 respondents from 30 large high-technology
firms in the United States, Chen, Ford, and Farris (1999) found that group
rewards were perceived as having greater organizational benefits than indi-
vidual incentive plans. We therefore postulate the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 4a: Technological intensity is positively related to the adoption

of a group-level compensation policy.

Hypothesis 4b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship

between a group-level compensation policy and firm performance.

Centralization Versus Decentralization

Centralization versus decentralization refers to the degree to which pay
decisions and approval procedures are strongly controlled by headquarters
or  are  delegated  to  various  plants, divisions, or  other  subunits  within  the
firm (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). The centralization of compensation
decision making is more logical when internal equity is an important orga-
nizational issue (Lawler, 1990). An emphasis on internal equity suggests a
stronger centralization of pay decision making (Brown, 1993), whereas
a market-driven pay orientation warrants stronger decentralization.

In this context, compensation decisions must be considerably decen-
tralized in technology-intensive firms to grant units and their managers the
necessary leeway to react quickly and adequately to internal and external
labor  market  pressures  (e.g., increased  capacity  to  recruit  technical  staff,
retaining key resources who would otherwise go to competitors). In a tur-
bulent environment such as the high-technology industry, decisions are best
made by those most capable of rapidly accessing the necessary information
rather  than  solely  by  top  managers  (Floyd  & Wooldridge, 1997). To  our
knowledge, only Diaz and Gomez-Mejia (1997) have studied the decision-
making  structure  in  compensation.  They  found  a  positive  relationship
between the degree of technological intensity and the decentralization of
pay decisions. We thus posit,


Tremblay, Chênevert / Compensation Strategies

277

Hypothesis 5a: Technological intensity is positively related to a decentralized

compensation structure.

Hypothesis 5b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship
between a decentralized compensation structure and firm performance.

Pay Secrecy Versus Pay Openness

Pay secrecy versus openness reflects the extent to which pay information
should be disclosed to employees. At one extreme, in a very closed pay
policy, each employee knows only his or her pay and may be disciplined for
talking with other employees about pay levels. At the other extreme, each
employee knows every individual’s compensation (Heneman, 2001).

The decision whether to keep salary data secret or to make them avail-
able is a very controversial subject in academia. Some specialists have argued
that a policy of pay secrecy is an essential feature in an individual pay-
for-performance plan (Burroughs, 1982), especially to reduce the allocator’s
tendency  to  average  pay  increases.  Some  compensation  specialists  have
maintained that when salaries are kept secret, employees may underestimate
the salaries of their superiors and overestimate the salaries of subordinates
or  colleagues  (Lawler, 1967;  Milkovich  &  Anderson, 1972), which  can
have  a  negative  influence  on  a  variety  of  attitudes  and  behavior  at  work
(Williams, Malos, & Palmer, 2002). In addition, a recent study has shown
that pay knowledge is associated with greater employee commitment and
retention (Mulvey et al., 2002).

However, the  hypothesis  that  high-technology  firms  practice  greater
transparency  and  benefit  from  higher  payoffs  than  traditional  companies
engenders contradictory arguments. First, the particular labor characteris-
tics of high-technology firms (e.g., more educated, younger, more mobile),
the importance of information in this type of industry, and the crucial role
of commitment and loyalty of technical staff suggest that high-technology
firms can gain many advantages by exhibiting considerable transparency in
their compensation policies. However, there are potential drawbacks to the
use of pay transparency as well. Specifically, the need for frequent recruit-
ment  and  for  managerial  discretion  in  pay  allocation  suggests  that  high-
technology firms would benefit little from a policy of openness, especially
when  such  decisions  increase  pay  differences  and  internal  inequities
(e.g., signing bonuses, red circles, or stock options for key contributors).
We thus propose the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 6a: Technological intensity is positively related to the adoption

of an openness-based compensation policy.


278 Group & Organization Management

Hypothesis 6b: Technological intensity positively moderates the relationship

between an openness compensation policy and firm performance.

Method

Sample

We tested the hypotheses using a longitudinal research design in which we
collected data for two periods at a 2-year interval. The data were obtained
from two surveys of HR vice presidents or directors in a convenience sample
comprising all Canadian private sector industries. Both questionnaires were
distributed  by  mail  to  the  business  units  or  company  divisions  because
compensation policies and their effects take place at these levels rather than
at the head office. In the first survey, we collected data related to organiza-
tional characteristics (e.g., size, labor cost, growth rate, sectors) and to our
predictors (compensation policies). The first survey yielded 252 usable ques-
tionnaires, for a response rate of 11.4%. The organizations in our sample had
an average of 1,000 employees, 32% of whom were unionized. On average,
these  firms  had  existed  for  nearly  40  years  and  were  evenly  distributed
between the manufacturing sector and the services sector.

A short questionnaire was distributed by mail 2 years later to the same
HR managers who responded to the first survey. The aim of this second
survey was to collect information on our dependent variables (human and
organizational performance indices) and to reduce the problem of common
methods bias. This second survey yielded 128 of 252 usable questionnaires,
for a response rate of 51%.

The reasons for nonresponse were investigated by phone with 300 firms
from the initial sample which did not answer the first questionnaire. Of the
firms that did not respond, 88% said that they were interested in the study
but  did  not  have  time  to  respond  within  the  specified  deadline  given  the
length of the questionnaire, 7% of firms claimed that they were interested
but that the managers did not have the means to respond because they had
only recently assumed their position, and 5% said they were not interested.
In  regard  to  the  importance  of  the  questions  regarding  compensation  for
companies  that  did  not  reply, 76%  of  the  nonrespondents  considered  the
compensation  policy  an  important  or  very  important  component  of  their
organizational strategy. The size of the organizations that did not respond
to  the  questionnaire  was  very  similar  to  that  of  the  firms  that  did  (960
employees vs. 991). They were equally divided between the manufacturing


Tremblay, Chênevert / Compensation Strategies

279

and services sectors (48% vs. 51%). These results suggest that companies
whose data were compiled in the database were not substantially different
from nonrespondents in terms of interest in compensation policies and their
role within the firm.

Measurement of Variables

Compensation policies. All compensation policy measures in this study
were based on the responses to a self-report questionnaire. Items were evalu-
ated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely
agree). The items (see Table 1) that measured the presence of the compen-
sation policies among exempt and nonexempt employees were based on
empirical  research  by  Diaz  and  Gomez-Mejia  (1997)  and  Balkin  and
Gomez-Mejia (1990).

We performed a principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation to
evaluate the structure of compensation policy items. The results are presented
in Table 1. Five factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1 were identified.
These factors explain 61% of the variance. The first factor, defined by six
items, reflects the individual performance policy (α = .78); the second fac-
tor, defined by six items, reflects the transparency of information (α = .84);
the third factor includes four items and stands for the group performance
policy (α = .74);  the  fourth  factor, defined  by  two  items, represents  the
internal versus market equity policy (α = .88); and the fifth factor, defined
by two items, measures the decentralization of pay decisions (α = .79). We
computed the average of the items for each scale to produce a composite
score  for  each  respondent.  The  correlations  among  these  five  constructs
varied between .00 and .28. These results suggest that our compensation
policy constructs are fairly distinct.

In addition to these perceptual measures, we added two other pay poli-
cies, the average bonus size and the lead versus lag pay policy. The former
variable was operationalized as the percentage of annual bonus recoded on
a 5-point scale (1 = 0.0%, 2 = 1.0% to 4.0%, 3 = 4.1% to 8.0%, 4 = 8.1%
to 12.0%, and 5 = more than 12.0%). The operationalization of the second
variable, the lead versus lag pay policy, was consistent with Milkovich et al.
(1991). First, we divided the sample of firms into two groups by the median
of technological intensity observed. Second, for each firm, we divided their
mean  salaries  by  the  mean  salary  of  all  business  units  included  in  this
category. Thus, for a given traditional firm, we compared its pay to the mean
pay of the traditional firm group. For a specific high-technological firm, we
compared its pay to the mean pay found in the group of high-technology

282 Group & Organization Management

firms. A percentage greater than 1 indicates firms that pay above their own
group, and a percentage lower than 1 denotes firms with a lag market policy.

High technological intensity. In general, high-technology companies are
differentiated from other companies by several criteria (Mohrman & Von
Glinow, 1990). The first one pertains to the extent of resources allocated to
the research and development of new products, defined by the ratio of R&D
expenditures to total operating costs. The second well-accepted criterion is
the proportion of technical, scientific, and engineering employees. We mea-
sured the items for these two questions to produce a composite score for
each respondent (α = .62).

Organizational performance. Except for the objective measure of pro-
ductivity, all HR and organizational-performance indicators were measured
in the second survey. To evaluate organizational performance, we used two
indicators: level  of  productivity  and  market  performance.  Productivity,
evaluated by the first survey, was measured by the logarithm of the ratio of
sales to the number of employees (Huselid, 1995). Market performance was
measured by four items (α = .82) based on the scale developed by Delany
and Huselid (1996). The respondents were invited to compare the perfor-
mance of their organization during the past 3 years to that of their industry
based on various indicators (growth in sales, profitability, market share, and
marketing). The scale comprises five conditions ranging from far inferior
(1) to far superior (5). Because of the cross-industry nature of our sample,
standardized measures of performance were not readily available (Youndt,
Snell, Dean, & Lepak, 1996). Although perceptual measures of performance
may introduce limitations, previous studies that have used such measures
found  moderate  to  strong  correlations  between  perceptual  and  objective
measures of organizational performance (Powell, 1992).

Human  resource  performance.  Three  indicators  from  the  second
questionnaire—work climate, turnover, and level of discretionary effort—
were used to evaluate HR performance. Consistent with Delany and Huselid
(1996), we used the following two questions to measure the quality of the
work  climate: “What  about: 1)  relations  between  management  and  other
employees and 2) relations among employees in general?” (α = .78). The
scale includes five conditions ranging from far inferior (1) to far superior
(5). The second HR indicator (turnover) has been evaluated by the percent-
age of voluntary turnover in the business unit. The third measure, the degree
of discretionary effort, was evaluated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging

from very weak (1) to very strong (5) for the following item: “How do you
estimate the current level of mobilization of your employees (e.g., propor-
tion of employees who put forth more effort than that normally required)?”

Control variables. Five organizational characteristics were controlled in
the analysis, based on the findings of the previous studies (Arthur, 1994;
Balkin  &  Gomez-Mejia, 1990).  The  level  of  unionization, rate  of  sales
growth, and proportion of labor costs were evaluated in percentages. Of the
two other control variables (sector of activity and the size of business unit),
the former was evaluated by a dichotomous measure (service = 1, manu-
facturing = 0) and the second by the logarithm of the number of employees.
Table  2  shows  the  means, standard  deviations, and  correlation  coeffi-
cients for the studied variables. Regression was used to test the hypotheses.
To assess the presence of multicollinearity, two statistical tests were per-
formed. First, tolerance statistics were examined to determine the extent to
which the independent variables are linearly related to one another (Neter,
Kutner, Nachtsheim, & Wasserman, 1996). The higher the correlation of one
variable with the other independent variables, the closer the tolerance index
is to 0. In this study, the tolerance indexes ranged from .48 to .91, which is
highly satisfactory (Neter et al., 1996).

Variance  inflation  factors  (VIFs)  were  also  examined  to  assess  the
degree of inflation of the variances of the estimated regression coefficients
compared to that observed when the independent variables are not linearly
related (Neter et al., 1996). In this study, VIF values ranged from 1.10 to
2.62, which is highly satisfactory, as a VIF value in excess of 10 is often
taken as an indication that multicollinearity may be unduly influencing the
least squares estimates. In short, the two statistical tests (tolerance and VIF)
indicate that multicollinearity is not problematic in this study.

Results

Table 3 presents the results related to the determinants of compensation
policies. Hypothesis 1a, which posits that technology-intensive companies
emphasize market equity rather than internal equity, is supported. Hypothesis
2a is not confirmed. Technological intensity is not related to the lead versus
lag pay policy of the organizations in our sample. Hypothesis 3a is supported.
Technological intensity is positively and significantly related to the size
of annual bonuses. Hypothesis 4a is not supported. The use of a group per-
formance policy is not significantly associated with technological intensity.

286 Group & Organization Management

Findings related to management features reveal a significant negative rela-
tionship  among  decentralization, transparency, and  level  of  technological
intensity. Contrary to Hypotheses 5a and 6a, technology-intensive firms are
less inclined to decentralize and to communicate their compensation policies
and practices than are other firms. No hypotheses were developed regarding
technological intensity and use of individual rewards; however, findings show
that the level of technological intensity is positively associated with the use
of individual performance policies.

Table 4 presents the results relative to the interactive influence of com-
pensation policies and technological intensity on five indices of organizational
and HR performance. Hypothesis 1b is supported only for the productivity
measure. A compensation policy centered on external rather than on internal
equity appears to exert a more positive effect on productivity in technology-
intensive companies. Figure 1 shows that emphasizing market equity rather
than internal pay equity is more strongly positively associated with pro-
ductivity in high-technology firms than in traditional firms. Hypothesis 2b
regarding the lead versus lag pay policy is only partly supported. A signifi-
cant interaction is found only for work climate. Figure 2 reveals that paying
above the reference group is more strongly positively related to work climate
for  high-technology  firms  than  for  their  traditional  counterparts.  In  other
words, the work climate is more sensitive to a pay leadership policy in firms
in which technology plays a determinant role. However, our results reveal
that a pay leadership policy exerts a significant positive main effect on pro-
ductivity and discretionary efforts and a negative main effect on turnover.
Thus, contrary to Hypothesis 2b, the lead versus lag pay policy seems to
exert a universal positive influence on productivity and behaviors, suggesting
that  technology-intensive  firms  are  not  the  only  firms  that  may  derive
benefits from a pay leadership policy.

Hypothesis 3b is not confirmed. Results show that the size of the annual
bonus  plays  no  significant  role  in  the  performance  of  high-technology
firms. Instead, bonus size has a universal positive influence on the perception
of market performance. In addition, our results show one negative effect of
individual pay for performance in high-technology firms. One significant
interaction  was  found  for  the  dependent  variable  of  turnover.  Figure  3
shows that the use of individual incentive plans is positively associated with
voluntary turnover for high-technology firms but not for traditional firms.
Of interest, the main effect findings reveal that the extensive use of indi-
vidual performance pay programs improves productivity and discretionary
efforts in both high and low technology-intensive firms.

Internal vs Market Equity

Low-technology firms

Hypothesis 4b receives partial support. Extensive use of a group perfor-
mance policy in technology-intensive firms is significantly and positively
related to productivity and negatively related to turnover. As Figures 4 and 5
show, group compensation is associated with higher productivity and lower
turnover in high-technology firms but not in low-technology firms. However,
our results reveal that group-based compensation exerts a positive universal
or main effect on discretionary efforts.

The decentralization of pay decision making is unrelated to all five out-
comes and is not more successful in high-technology firms than in low-
technology  firms, refuting  Hypothesis  5b.  Finally, a  pay  openness  policy
does not seem to be associated with better outcomes in technology-intensive
companies, thereby refuting Hypothesis 6b. In fact, the findings reveal that
a pay openness policy has a negative main effect on market performance and
discretionary efforts and a positive influence on work climate.

Discussion

This study asserts that the degree of technological intensity is a variable
for  explaining  compensation  policies  and  a  relevant  contingency  factor  to
take into account in the field of strategic human resource management. Our
results partly corroborate those of Milkovich et al. (1991), Diaz and Gomez-
Mejia (1997), and Yanadori and Marler (2006). Technology-intensive firms
implement specific compensation policies that differ from those of traditional
firms, and some of these policies are more successful in high-technology than
in low-technology firms. These findings deserve further comment.

Regarding the first hypothesis, mixed results were observed. Consistent
with the findings of Diaz and Gomez-Mejia (1997) from a Spanish sample,
we found that the level of technological intensity among our sample of
Canadian firms was significantly associated with preference for an external

rather than an internal compensation equity policy. In line with Diaz and
Gomez-Mejia (1997), we observed that this pay policy plays a marginal role
in the performance of firms with low and high technological intensity. In fact,
we found that productivity was the only performance indicator significantly
associated with greater emphasis on external rather than internal equity and
the only case in which the interactive term was significant.

The results relative to lead versus lag pay policy appear more robust and
consistent. Our findings show that a lead pay policy is positively associated
with productivity and discretionary efforts and negatively related to turnover.
Our  results  are  consistent  with  organizational  support  theory  (Rhoades  &
Eisenbergher, 2002), which predicts that favorable rewards communicate a
positive valuation of employee contributions and a strong commitment to fair
distribution  of  rewards  and  resources.  The  reciprocity  norm  asserts  that  a
leading pay policy should create an obligation to care about the organiza-
tion’s welfare and thus motivate employees to perform better. In addition, the
literature  on  organizational  commitment  (Meyer, Stanley, Herscovich, &

Topolnytsky, 2002) suggests that the accumulation of side bets and valuable
benefits  may  reinforce  continuance  commitment  and  subsequently  reduce
turnover. Therefore, an organization that pursues a lead pay policy signifi-
cantly  reduces  turnover  because  a  greater  proportion  of  its  workforce  has
developed a continuance commitment to its organization.

However, except for the work climate, technological intensity does not
seem to moderate the relation between lead versus lag pay policy and orga-
nizational performance. As some scholars have pointed out, a single orga-
nization may apply several pay levels relative to the market (Milkovich &
Newman, 1996). For several reasons (e.g., greater financial resources, survival
uncertainty, and  degrees  of  dependence), it  is  possible  that  technology-
intensive firms are more inclined than other organizations to segment their
pay level within the organization and to devote special attention to the com-
pensation of R&D personnel (Coombs & Gomez-Mejia, 1991; Yanadori &

Marler, 2006). Our study did not identify specific reference markets used to
establish pay levels. Some organizations compare their pay with other firms
in their labor market, whereas others choose direct competitors as the basis
of compensation comparison (Gerhart & Rynes, 2003; Milkovich & Newman,
1996). Future research should examine the influence of internal and external
pay markets in firms in which technology plays a determining role.

Consistent with past research, we found that employees in technology-
intensive firms are more likely to be paid based on their individual perfor-
mance (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1984) and to receive larger bonuses (Diaz &
Gomez-Mejia, 1997;  Milkovich  et  al., 1991)  than  are  employees  in
low-technology firms. Technology-intensive firms do not seem to consider
individual performance pay plans incompatible with a culture of innovation,
knowledge sharing, and teamwork. As Bartol and Srivastava (2002) have
suggested, if a manager has the opportunity to carefully evaluate the con-
tribution made by individuals, the use of individual rewards can constitute


294 Group & Organization Management

a successful strategy to encourage cooperative behaviors such as knowledge
sharing. In addition, perhaps conservation of the most critical resources and
motivation of the best performers are prevalent objectives in a technological
field  and  the  risk  of  not  rewarding  individual  contributions  is  probably
perceived as too high by the decision makers in such firms.

Nonetheless, we found that the extensive use of individual performance
pay plans has a stronger positive influence on the turnover rate in technology-
intensive  firms  than  in  traditional  firms. There  seems  to  be  a  mismatch
between the use of this pay policy and the capacity to retain human resources
in technology-intensive firms. We may then ask why high-technology firms
do not derive retention benefits from this pay policy. Some specialists argue
that a strong emphasis on individual performance and rewards has potential
drawbacks such as decreases in intrinsic motivation, cooperation, satisfaction,
and equity (Heneman, 1992; Shaw et al., 2001). In the justice literature, the
perception of individual inequity is positively associated with the desire to
quit (Scholl, Cooper, & McKenna, 1987; Tremblay & Roussell, 2001). In
addition, turnover studies have found that the decision to quit is easier when
the job market is favorable (Mobley, Griffeth, Hand, & Meglino, 1979). In
such markets, it is easier for highly skilled employees who are dissatisfied
with the rewards received or with the compensation process to switch to
another employer. Further research should more extensively explore why
employees in technology-intensive firms are more prone than their coun-
terparts in traditional firms to quit their organization when exposed to an
individual performance pay plan.

However, turnover does not necessarily engender negative outcomes for
firms. Hong, Ofori-Dankwa, and Bishop (1994) proposed that turnover may
be classified into two main types: dysfunctional and functional turnover.
In the first case, turnover is adverse because it causes the firm to lose good
elements (e.g., high-quality employees). In the second case, turnover is posi-
tive because it prompts the least effective employees to leave. These authors
found a positive relationship between the presence of individual incentive
pay  plans  and  the  rate  of  functional  turnover.  Of  interest, Zenger  (1992)
observed a lower turnover rate among extremely high-performing employ-
ees and a higher turnover among the extremely low performers in high-
technology  firms  with  merit  compensation  plans.  These  studies  suggest
that, in some cases, turnover is not necessarily an indicator of poor human
resource performance. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the extensive
use of an individual performance policy appears to play a significant posi-
tive role in the productivity and discretionary efforts of firms regardless of
their levels of technological intensity.

Contrary to Diaz and Gomez-Mejia (1997), this study found no signifi-
cant relationship between the degree of technological intensity and the use
of group performance policies. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the
possibility that the values shared by leaders of technology-intensive firms
are  more  oriented  toward  the  importance  of  individual  performance  as  a
success criterion, given the entrepreneur profile that is often associated with
the executives of these companies.1 However, significant interaction effects
showed that the use of a group performance policy in high-technology firms
is positively associated with productivity and negatively related to turnover.
Our  performance  results  are  consistent  with  those  of  Diaz  and  Gomez-
Mejia (1997). One possible explanation for the explanatory power of group
incentives in high-technology firms is that the free-rider effect is lower in
high-technology  firms  than  in  low-technology  firms. As  high-technology
firms are generally smaller than are traditional firms (r = –.19, p < .01), the
use of group incentive plans may contribute to a greater incentive alignment
and  mutual  monitoring  in  technology-intensive  firms.  This  lesser  perfor-
mance dispersion created by peer monitoring increases feelings of equity
and encourages the improvement of performance and desires to remain in
the organization. More extensive research is needed to clarify why the use
of  group  incentive  plans  may  have  adverse  effects  in  contexts  of  low
technological intensity and a positive influence in contexts of high techno-
logical intensity.

Finally, high-technology  firms  appear  less  likely  to  decentralize  pay
decision making and to share compensation information than low-technology
firms. One intriguing finding, however, is that greater transparency has a
negative effect on market performance and discretionary efforts even though
it has a positive effect on work climate. This result is consistent with other
studies (Kleiner & Bouillon, 1988) that show that disclosing information is
not always beneficial for organizations.

There are several possible explanations for the negative influence of the
sharing  of  compensation  information  on  organizational  performance  and
collective efforts. Some employers may believe that a secrecy policy may
reduce  potential  conflicts  among  peers  or  colleagues  in  the  work  team,
especially in the case of high differential pay among team members. Research
has shown that a large pay differential may negatively influence performance
(Bloom, 1999; Pfeffer & Langton, 1993). In addition, private compensation
information  may  give  managers  greater  discretion  in  the  allocation  of
rewards, notably the freedom to recognize the most productive employees
and contributors. Furthermore, this greater discretion reduces the pressure
on  managers  to  justify  each  of  their  compensation  decisions  (Bartol  &


296 Group & Organization Management

Martin, 1989).  It  is  important  to  note  that  several  organizations  have  not
weighed the principles of distributive and procedural justice when developing
their compensation systems.2 Accordingly, firms may choose not to disclose
pay information to preserve feelings of internal equity, the loss of which
can jeopardize productivity and the control of workforce costs.

Limitations and Future Research

Even though we have found evidence that compensation policies are
driven  by  technological  intensity  and  that  organizational  performance  is
conditioned by specific compensation policies, this study nonetheless has
some limitations. First, we cannot rule out the possibility of response bias.
Despite the efforts put forth to verify differences between the respondents
and nonrespondents, our sample remains a sample of convenience, which
does not eliminate the possibility that the respondents who agreed to partici-
pate in our survey are those who had a more positive perception of their
compensation policies.

Second, the  HR  directors’ and  compensation  managers’ answers  were
not compared with other points of view such as those of line managers or
employees. The perception of hierarchical managers and employees of the
presence and efficiency of compensation policies may differ considerably
from  those  of  HR  professionals, which  may  decrease  the  power  of  the
relationships observed.

Third, the relationships obtained must be interpreted with caution because
we have targeted compensation policies rather than the practices that are
actually implemented in the respondents’ firms. This may have created a
positive or negative bias in the results obtained. In fact, policies are more
strongly  linked  to  the  area  of  intention  and  principle, whereas  practices
belong to the field of operation.

Although predictors and performance were measured on two occasions,
our study design is not immune from causality problems. For example, we
cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  direction  of  causality  may  be
reversed. As Wright, Gardner, Moynihan, and Allen (2005) recently demon-
strated, successful organizations are more likely to implement innovative
human resource practices than less efficient firms. In the field of compen-
sation, it is conceivable that the most successful organizations have intro-
duced  more  progressive  compensation  programs  such  as  pay  leadership
policies or success sharing pay plans to sustain the motivation of their work-
force and to preserve their good work climate. Therefore, controlling for


Tremblay, Chênevert / Compensation Strategies

297

the past performance of firms would probably have affected the weight of
observed relationships in this study. In addition, we used a self-report perfor-
mance measure rather than objective indicators. The use of financial indi-
cators could add to our understanding of the role of compensation policies
and practices. Nonetheless, the indicators used in this study have the advan-
tage of being applicable to different sectors of activity, thereby making the
results obtained more generalizable.

This study has tested the influence of 7 distinct compensation policies.
However, Gomez-Mejia and Balkin (1992) proposed a taxonomy of more
than 17 compensation decisions. Despite the growing body of knowledge in
this field, academics have paid little attention to other pay policies such as
internal pay dispersions (e.g., between R&D technical employees and other
professionals and with managers), the degree of emphasis on benefits versus
direct monetary rewards, the degree of emphasis on monetary versus psy-
chological rewards, and the degree of emphasis on behaviors versus outcome
measures.  Further  research  could  investigate  the  influence  of  such  pay
policies, particularly in firms in which technology plays an important role.
The  literature  on  strategic  human  resource  management  suggests  that
HR practices such as compensation may lead to positive outcomes when
combined with appropriate complementary practices and to more negative
outcomes when implemented in isolation (Becker, Huselid, Pickus, & Spratt,
1997; Gerhart, 2000). It would be useful to evaluate the effects of certain
combinations of compensation policy architectures. Similarly, it would be
worth examining whether certain compensation policies can substitute for
each other or for other HR policies.

The goal of this study was to further contribute to the existing evidence
that the level of a firm’s technological intensity must be taken into account
in the quest for a greater efficiency of compensation policies. However, the
degree of technological intensity does not represent the entire spectrum of
firms  in  the  high-technology  industry.  For  example, we  can  ask  whether
new  high-technology  firms  adopt  compensation  policies  that  differ  from
those of firms situated in a growth cycle or at maturity.

Furthermore, important factors other than technology may also play critical
roles in the adoption and performance of compensation policies (Klarsfeld,
Balkin, & Roger, 2003). In stark contrast with the strategic and contingency
perspectives in human resources management, some institutional pressures
and/or constraints somewhat limit the power or the discretion of firms to
adopt well-established compensation policies. Factors such as the level of
unionization and the extensive use of pay surveys can lower the congruence
between  a  firm’s  compensation  policies  and  key  contingent  contextual


298 Group & Organization Management

factors (Crystal, 1991). Future research should explore how such institu-
tional factors may improve our understanding of pay policy variability and
effectiveness.

In conclusion, compensation practitioners must acknowledge that specific
compensation  policies  play  a  positive  role  when  technological  intensity
increases, whereas other pay policies may have a detrimental influence in
the same context. The universalistic perspective is not always a source of
efficiency; practitioners must pay greater attention to internal and external
contingencies when formulating compensation policies for these policies to
play  a  strategic  role  and  for  compensation  strategy  to  contribute  to  the
success of the organization and to the welfare of the workforce.
