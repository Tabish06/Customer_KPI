We use unique data from 245 stores of a UK retailer to study links among middle (store) manager skills,

sales, and manager pay. We ﬁnd that, of the six management practice areas surveyed, the most important
is “commercial awareness,” where abler managers achieve up to 13.9% higher sales per worker. We ﬁnd that
many stores have poor managers on this indicator. However, the company is careful to incentivize managers,
operating a scheme giving shares (approximately 20%) in both positive and negative deviations of actual sales
from expected. Abler managers do not receive higher pay, implying that their skills are company speciﬁc.

Introduction

1.
Although debates continue on what makes good man-
agement, there is little doubt that management, just
as other production inputs, matters to ﬁrm perfor-
mance. Yet the observed effects of management on
performance are in part shaped by corporate gover-
nance practices aimed at dealing with, among other
issues, lack or misallocation of resources within the
ﬁrm and agency concerns stemming from the divi-
sion of ownership and control. This study combines
the perspectives on management as an input into pro-
duction function and as an outcome of corporate gov-
ernance in an attempt to produce a fuller picture of
its effect on performance.

Taking the management input perspective, we esti-
mate the effect of middle management skills on the
economic performance of the establishments of a
single ﬁrm. Our unique, uniformly collected data
from more than 200 retail stores of a UK clothing
specialist offer an opportunity to study the impor-
tant, but elusive, middle management input (Kanter
2004) in isolation from the confounding inﬂuences
of most ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors. Controlling for a num-
ber of other inputs, observed and unobserved, we
obtain plausible estimates of the differences in sales
per worker between stores due to differences in their
managers’ skill grades, with the highest-grade man-
agers achieving up to 13.9% higher sales per worker
than those with the lowest grade.

We next turn to the corporate governance per-
spective, looking at the particular ﬁrmwide practices
shaping the overall contribution of middle manage-
ment to sales: manager allocation among stores and

incentivization. We ﬁnd that, because it is hard to
dismiss underperforming managers or easily improve
their allocation among stores, the company operates
a type of incentive pay scheme in pay contracts
reviewed every year. Under this scheme, store man-
agers bear a deﬁnite share (approximately 20%) in
deviations of actual store sales from expected, giv-
ing them an incentive to perform to the best of their
ability, high or low as the case may be. At the same
time, we ﬁnd that store managers’ skill grades are not
reﬂected in their pay. Consistent with the resource-
based view of the ﬁrm, these skills therefore exem-
plify highly speciﬁc human capital, valuable to the
ﬁrm and yet not valued outside, and thus a source of
competitive advantage for the ﬁrm that we study.

The rest of the article is organized as follows.
Section 2 offers a review of the literature on the per-
formance effects of middle management and how
these managers are themselves managed. Section 3
introduces the data and estimation techniques used
in the regression analysis that underlies the results
presented in §§4 and 5. In §6 we use our regression
results to assess the economic importance of manage-
ment skills and corporate governance practices and
relate our ﬁndings to the earlier studies. Section 7
concludes.

2. Prior Literature and Our Study
“Executives matter” argue Hambrick and Mason
(1984, p. 194), but this proposition is surprisingly
difﬁcult to prove empirically. Further questions as
to how much they matter, and how best to man-
age them, arise. Moreover, these questions radiate

beyond the top executive to the top management
team (Finkelstein et al. 2009, Chap. 5) and further to
the ranks of middle managers below. The basic difﬁ-
culty, of course, is that the management input is pecu-
liarly difﬁcult to measure.

Several methods are available. Historically, estimat-
ing the effect of management on performance began
by capturing it
through manager (or CEO) ﬁxed
effects. In other words, a panel of ﬁrms and CEOs
was followed over time, allowing variation in per-
formance to be apportioned into year, industry, com-
pany, and CEO effects. Studies within this approach
started with Mundlak (1961) (see also Lieberson and
O’Connor 1972, Lieberman et al. 1990, Bertrand and
Shoar 2003, and Crossland and Hambrick 2007). Typi-
cally manager ﬁxed effects are found to be statistically
signiﬁcant, though to many, starting with Lieberson
and O’Connor (1972), they seem surprisingly small.
There is also the question of what an “average” man-
ager effect can mean, given that industries naturally
vary in the extent to which “managerial discretion”
(Finkelstein et al. 2009, pp. 26–36) can be exercised.
A further problem is that the ﬁxed effects are tracked
via the CEO and offer little insight into Kanter’s
(2004) “innovative” middle management tier.

Another approach to capturing the management
input is to analyze share price movements associated
with CEO turnover, hypothetical or actually observed.
Terviö (2008), using CEO pay as a proxy for their abil-
ity, calculates that, if we were to replace the CEOs of
the 1,000 largest U.S. businesses with the lowest paid
and presumably least able, their total capital value
would fall by 0.13%–0.16% in 2004, or by 4.3%–5.3%
in the long run, applying a 3% future discount rate
(approximately the average of the Federal Reserve
System’s discount rate for 2004). Hayes and Schaefer
(1999) ﬁnd that share prices fall by 3%–5% when a
(presumably more able) CEO quits for a better job, an
effect of similar magnitude to Terviö’s (2008). How-
ever, the applicability of the approach using share
price movements is limited to large publicly quoted
ﬁrms.

A more universal approach is to measure manager
skills directly, which is what we do in this study. Well
known examples of this approach, though initially
conﬁned to skills in the human resource management
(HRM) area, are the Huselid (1995) and Ichniowski
et al. (1997) management practice surveys. Other
studies consider several HRM practices together, as
separate inputs into production process (Capelli and
Neumark 2001) or as “bundles” (Macdufﬁe 1995,
Ichniowski et al. 1997, Black and Lynch 2004). There
are two general conclusions emerging from this lit-
erature: (i) HRM practices matter individually, and
(ii)
is greater when they are bundled,

the effect

making a coherent work system connected with other
parts of the organizational capital of the ﬁrm.

More recently, the surveys have expanded to cover
a wide range of management practices. Bloom and
Van Reenen’s’s (2007) study scores eighteen indi-
vidual practices from 732 ﬁrms in four countries
(the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and
Germany) to produce an average management score
for each company. This score, reﬂecting the overall
ability of the top management team, is found to be
positively associated with a range of ﬁrm economic
performance measures. Grifﬁths et al. (2006) use the
“balanced scorecard” approach of Kaplan and Norton
(1992) to calculate manager scores on ﬁnancial, cus-
tomer satisfaction, innovation, and internal controls
criteria in stores of a UK building materials whole-
saler, again ﬁnding a strong association with ﬁrm per-
formance. Their study is more like ours in that it looks
at the middle manager level, with the company’s top
management policies given.

The contribution of managers to ﬁrm perfor-
mance is affected by what is known as the “agency
problem”—a misalignment of
the manager’s and
the owner’s incentives (Bebchuk and Fried 2003,
Carpenter and Wade 2002). This problem is partic-
ularly important for large and geographically dis-
persed ﬁrms such as our study company—hence the
importance of managing the managers in our study.
Speciﬁcally, we consider two practices of managing
the managers applied within our study company:
incentivizing store managers to perform and allocat-
ing managers suitably across stores within the ﬁrm.
There are two main theoretical models of incen-
tive pay: Holmström’s’s (1979) pay-for-performance
model, which predicts that conditioning pay on out-
put is essential for inducing worker effort, and Lazear
and Rosen’s (1981) tournament-based model, which
predicts that effort is induced by workers’ compet-
ing for higher positions in an organizational hierarchy
offering progressively higher pay. Substantial empir-
ical evidence exists on both models (see Prendergast
1999 for a survey). Speciﬁcally for the middle man-
agement level, Lambert et al. (1993) ﬁnd that the
earnings gap between the plant manager and the cor-
porate CEO can be explained through a mix of pay for
performance and tournaments-based elements. Roth
and O’Donnell’s (1996) study of manager pay in over-
seas subsidiaries ﬁnds that the weight given to pay
for performance increases with “cultural distance”
of a subsidiary manager from central headquarters,
which is plausible because cultural distance increases
information asymmetry and hence the extent of the
agency problem. As a contribution to the pay-for-
performance literature, we show how our study com-
pany has developed a manager pay review system
based on expected annual store sales to make the


1400

most of its available store manager pool. Building
on this system, we develop a measure of expected
sales and ﬁnd that positive (negative) deviations are
rewarded (punished), as expected.

As for manager allocation, Lucas’s (1978) model
predicts that abler managers will end up in con-
trol of larger establishments, because of the “scale of
operations” effect (that is, the contribution of good
managers to overall proﬁt is magniﬁed by their estab-
lishment’s size). We ﬁnd the scale of operations effect
is indeed manifested among the company’s stores, but
it seems weaker than in the larger economy (as in
Terviö 2008). Store managers appear difﬁcult to re-
allocate perhaps because their skills are highly spe-
ciﬁc (such skills being difﬁcult to imitate and hence a
source of competitive advantage—see Holcomb et al.
2009). In other words, middle managers’ skills in our
company exemplify skills speciﬁcally tied (Bailey and
Helfat 2003) to knowledge of their particular store
and its personnel, customers, and internal strengths
and weaknesses. The high proportion of top man-
agers (nearly 90% in Bailey and Helfat’s 2003 study)
recruited internally already suggests skill speciﬁcity
at the top level. We now ﬁnd such speciﬁcity farther
down the hierarchy as well.

3. Data and Method
3.1. The Study Company
Our study company is a large UK-based clothing
retailer with more than 600 stores in the United King-
dom and many more internationally, though we con-
ﬁne ourselves to the UK operations. At the top of
the organizational hierarchy is central headquarters
(HQ), where companywide ﬁnancial, marketing, and
operational decisions are made. Thus, HQ decides on
the goods to be sold and managers to be employed
at each store, as well as their remuneration. Sales
assistants’ pay rates and store wage budgets are also
set by HQ in the beginning of each accounting year
(February), taking into account changes in operat-
ing environment and newly acquired information.
Wage budgets, in particular, are set according to a
“wage budget rule,” allowing wages to be no more
than a certain fraction (approximately 10%) of the
previous year’s sales. This rule of course sets an
important constraint on how many worker-hours a
manager can hire over the year because wage rates
are given. A network of twenty regional managers
coordinates store managers and, importantly, negoti-
ates the implementation of the wage budget rule and
helps assess store manager performance.

Even though store managers’ activities are closely
directed by HQ, which sets both product prices and
wage budgets, they have considerable autonomy in
the day-to-day running of their stores, and their

assessments reveal considerable variation in their
skill levels (see §3.3). Generally speaking, they must
maintain an attractive store appearance and provide
adequate customer service within the store’s wage
budget. An important part of this task is ensuring
there are enough sales assistants at all times, which
is generally achieved through maintaining a pool of
part-time workers employed at peak times and laid
off when business is quiet. Store managers are also
responsible for sales assistants’ selection, training, and
promotion; in fact, nearly two-thirds of store man-
agers are recruited from sales assistants.

Our analysis runs through the data collected for the
trading year February 2005 to February 2006. The rea-
son for taking only one year’s worth of observations
is to ensure that the same manager was in charge of a
given store for the entire study period. All managers
who participated in the assessment must have been
running their stores for at least a year as of February
2006. There are 245 such stores.

3.2. Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 offers an illustration of the workings of our
study company and its environment. The average
store is, in UK terms, comparable to a small enter-
prise, producing approximately £60 worth of sales
per worker-hour, employing 314.5 worker-hours of
labor per week (8.4 full-time-equivalent (FTE) work-
ers, 1 week = 37!5 hours), and occupying approxi-
mately 150 square meters of space (store space being
our measure of capital input). Even though all our
stores belong to the same company, selling the main
brand of medium-priced casual clothing and gen-
erally located in large shopping centers, they vary
considerably in sales per worker-hour (our measure
of labor productivity), giving a standard deviation
of £15.07. We aim to explain this high variation in
productivity.

The company needs to accommodate large ﬂuctu-
ations in business by day of the week and season,
which requires a ﬂexible workforce. Indeed, most of
the sales assistants work less than 15 hours per week.
There is also considerable employee turnover (the
FTE separation rate is 15% annually, approximately
30% in headcount terms), characteristic of the retail
sector. Such ﬂuid conditions present a challenge to the
store manager, who must match labor input to ﬂuc-
tuating demand while keeping labor turnover under
control. Competitive pressures, averaging 36.45 stores
in the catchment area, pose another challenge for store
managers.

We see that an average store manager is in her
late 30s and has been with the company for a con-
siderable part of her working life. Most of the man-
agers are women, but the share of men (0.27) is twice
as high as for sales assistants. Their average pay rate

the

3.3. Key Behavioral Indicators
The basis for our study is the company’s unique sur-
vey of six management practice areas, or key behav-
ioral
indicators (KBIs): “sales focus,” “commercial
awareness,” “developing people,” “drive and personal
development,” “leadership,” and “planning and orga-
nizing.” Each participating store manager received
one of the three grades for each KBI—“development
need” (signifying inadequate performance), “capable”
(minimum appropriate performance), and “strength”
(exceptional performance)—matching
grade
descriptions in Table 2. In addition to the individual
KBI grades, the managers’ overall performance was
also graded, ranging from E (lowest) to A (highest),
based on the sum of scores on individual KBIs. All
managers who had worked in their stores for at least
one year as of early 2006 took part. This minimum
tenure restriction ensures that every store manager
had enough evidence for his or her skills to be ade-
quately assessed. It took a dedicated HR team, store,
and area managers ﬁve months to collect, verify, and
summarize these data.

The objectivity of the KBI grades is important
because we wish to use them to help explain store
performance (as, indeed, does the company). Let us
ﬁrst consider the KBI measurement method. Each
store manager had initially to self-assess by ﬁlling in
the survey questionnaire. Those self-assessments were
later discussed with the area managers, and then,
based on the evidence supporting the self-assessment
results, agreed assessments were produced.

As we show, it is the area manager who gives the
KBI measures objectivity. The question is whether the
area manager is inﬂuenced by store sales themselves
in assessing the store manager skills, which we now
consider. Given the lack of repeated KBI observations
by store, we cannot test for a possible reverse causal-
ity between sales and KBI grades, which remains a
caveat to our analysis. However, we believe that sales
affecting KBI grades is unlikely, because there is no
mention of sales in the KBI grade descriptions. Sales
together with other “hard” performance outcomes,
such as employee turnover and the wage budget tar-
get, were monitored in a separate Key Performance
Indicators survey administered by another depart-
ment within the company. The KBI survey, on the
other hand, is an expensive effort aimed at identify-
ing managers’ strengths and weaknesses and testing
the company’s beliefs about which managerial skills
are good for performance (in fact, our results do not
support some of these beliefs).

Looking at the KBI grade descriptions in Table 2,
we see an extensive range of practices, from the
more administrative (such as planning and organiz-
ing) to the more entrepreneurial (such as commercial
awareness). Attention is paid to HRM practices, too,
with the KBI developing people related to some of
the “high-performance” work practices described in
Pfeffer (1998), such as training and communication
with employees. Admittedly, there are overlaps; for
example, both sales focus and leadership reward team
building. At the same time, the important commercial
awareness KBI appears to be unique. It emphasizes
four skills: Knowing the trading period strategy, mon-
itoring local competition, adjusting manpower subject
to wage control, and making best use of space—none
of which are touched on by the other KBIs. As we
show below, by comparing the estimates for the KBIs
entered separately and jointly into the sales equation,
the characteristics of commercial awareness matter for
sales the most. To repeat, none of the four skills mea-
sured under this KBI mentions store sales.

Table 3 shows that the performance of store man-
agers with respect to the KBIs varies considerably.
Approximately 20% were rated as development need
for sales focus, commercial awareness,
leadership,
and drive and personal development, and approxi-
mately one-quarter were rated at the highest grade.
The best-performing KBI is planning and organizing,
in which 95% of the store managers achieve satisfac-
tory performance. The weakest results are for devel-
oping people, with 40% of store managers rated as
underperforming.

We would expect the KBI grades to be linked to
store labor productivity. Indeed, as Table 3 demon-
strates, managers with higher KBI grades are found
in more productive stores. This early indication of
the link between manager skills and performance
is encouraging but needs to be tested controlling
for other factors, especially the fact that stores with
higher-graded managers are also larger and located in
more competitive areas, each of these factors affecting
productivity on its own. In the sections to follow, we
apply multivariate regression analysis to test whether
the KBIs really translate into sales performance.

3.4. Estimation Issues
We begin our regression analysis by estimating the
contribution of manager skills to sales, controlling
for labor and store space, as well as store, area, and
workforce characteristics. We do not have data on the
cost of sales, which is an obvious input in the sales
function, but, plausibly assuming that it is a constant
fraction of the total sales, we can abstract from it.
We assume that the sales function is Cobb-Douglas.
Our robustness checks (skipped here but available on
request) show that this simple functional form is ade-
quate for our data.

Because management input is ﬁxed for the whole
year, we could in principle aggregate our weekly sales
and labor input data and estimate the sales func-
tion on the year totals. The problem with this simple
approach, however, is that it may bias the estimate
for the elasticity of sales with respect to the labor
input, leading to biased estimates for manager skills
because labor and management inputs are correlated.

a1 = number of competitors 1–17 (bottom 25%), 2 = 18–30, 3 = 31–51, and 4 = 52+ (top 25%).

The current year’s labor input is correlated with the
last year’s shock to sales through the wage budget
rule. If the last year’s shock to sales continues to
affect the current year’s sales then sales and labor
input will be simultaneously determined, causing an
upward bias to labor input’s estimate. Indeed, run-
ning a simple regression with year totals (not shown)
gives an improbably large labor input elasticity
estimate: 1.02.

An alternative approach, also implemented in pre-
vious studies of the management input (e.g., Black
and Lynch 2004, Bloom and Van Reenen’s 2007), is
to include store ﬁxed effects in the production func-
tion to control for the possible correlation between
labor input, which varies by week, and store-speciﬁc
unobservables (such as last year’s sales shock), which
are ﬁxed for at least one year. Having weekly data
on sales and employment, we also allow for dynam-
ics in the response of sales to changes in labor input.
For instance, hours spent on shelving in one week
may increase sales in the following weeks. Our inclu-
sion of lags will improve the quality of the estimates
for labor input by allowing for differences between
short- and long-run labor input elasticities. However,
the lags do not change the regression estimates for the
KBIs materially.

Because,

like unobservables, management, store
space, and other controls are also ﬁxed throughout
the year, introducing store ﬁxed effects necessitates a
two-stage estimation procedure as follows. At the ﬁrst
stage we obtain the estimates for the short- and long-

run labor input elasticities, ""1 and #""1 +""2$/#1− ˆ%$,
by running the sales equation with store ﬁxed effects:

ln#sales$it = % ln#sales$it−1 + "1 ln#labor$it

+ "2 ln#labor$it−1 + week dummyt
+ ﬁxed effecti + error1st stage

(1)
where i = 1 ! ! ! 245 and t = 1 ! ! ! 52 are the store and
week counters. The elasticities’ standard errors are
calculated by using the delta method.1 We then pro-
ceed to the second stage, where we use the estimated
ﬁxed effects as the dependent variable, as follows:

&

!ﬁxed effecti = ’1 ln#space$i + ’2KBIi + ’3other controlsi

+ error2nd stage

It is at this stage that we obtain the estimates (’2) for
the KBI grades.

The literature identiﬁes three other estimation
issues. First, the labor input elasticity may be overes-
timated since sales and labor input may be simultane-
ously determined by an unobserved process (Blundell

et al. 2000), for instance, change in consumer tastes.
To correct for the upward bias, following Bloom and
Van Reenen’s (2007), we instrument labor input with
its lags from 2 to 5. We ﬁnd, however, that instru-
mentation makes little difference to the estimates, pre-
sumably because using data from a single company
helps ensure that time-varying unobservables are the
same for all stores and thus can be captured by the
week dummies. Second, estimating a dynamic equa-
tion such as (1) on panel data produces a bias to some
of the estimates, mainly % (Nickell 1981), which can
be corrected by instrumenting the lagged dependent
variable with its earlier lags. We choose, however,
not to instrument it because of the loss of efﬁciency
that the instrumenting would entail, while the bias in
question is negligible in long (52 weeks) panels such
as ours (see Judson and Owen 1999 for Monte-Carlo
simulations of the bias). Finally, we test for autocor-
relation in the ﬁrst-stage regression residual, ﬁnding
which would imply an incorrectly speciﬁed model
because in that case the error term would be corre-
lated with one of the regression variables, ln#sales$it−1.
Our ﬁrst-stage regression passes this test.

3.5. Causality or Association?
As noted earlier (Lucas 1978), it is proﬁt-maximizing
for the company to allocate store managers with
better skills to bigger and better-performing stores
because store size and efﬁciency magnify the contri-
bution of more skilled managers to the total proﬁt.
The consequence of such nonrandom allocation will
be an overestimate of the causal effect of manager
skills on sales unless we can control for all of the rele-
vant factors or use suitable instruments to recover the
causal effect. Still, in the absence of such instruments
and controls, we can reduce this bias by introducing
a proxy for the unobservables as we now explain.

Suppose that, holding all else constant, log sales
depend on log management input (x), an unobserved
store characteristic (z), and random noise (() that is
uncorrelated with both x and z,

ln#sales$ = )· x + z+ (!
Because z is not observed, we estimate

ln#sales$ = ˜)· x + e&

where e = z + (. Applying the omitted variable bias
formula, the expected value of the effect of manage-
ment on sales is

˜) = )+

cov#x& z$
var#x$

&

which is biased upward by cov#x& z$/var#x$ to the
extent that better managers (higher x) are allocated to
intrinsically more-productive stores (higher z).

To illustrate this bias on our data, we run par-
tial correlations between the commercial awareness
score (0 = “development need,” 1 = “capable,” 2 =
“strength”) as the measure of management input (x)
and the store’s annual labor input (denoted z∗). The
store’s annual labor input is used here because it is
closely correlated with the unobserved z, holding all
other inputs in the sales function ﬁxed.2 The estimate
for the bias, cov#x& z∗$/var#x$, is 0.062. This estimate
tells us that, if not corrected for the bias, the effect of
management on sales will be overestimated, but it is
not informative enough about the magnitude of the
bias because we do not observe the distribution of the
true z.

Adding store-speciﬁc ﬁxed effects, as is done in
Capelli and Neumark (2001) and Ichniowski et al.
(1997), would eliminate this bias, but then the effect
of management would not be separately identiﬁed
because management input does not vary within
store. We can, however, reduce the bias and allow
for some independent variation in management input
by grouping stores likely to have similar unobserv-
ables. Store size measured as annual labor input is
an appropriate criterion for grouping because, as we
showed above, it is correlated with the unobserv-
ables that we aim to capture. In fact, grouping stores
into four size quartiles and adding a ﬁxed effect for
each quartile reduces the estimated bias by 75%, from
0.062 to 0.016, implying that stores within the same
size quartile are quite similar in terms of the unob-
servables. Our procedure thus corrects for a large part
of the nonrandom manager selection bias, bringing
the estimates for manager skills closer to their true
causal effect.

4. Regression Results for Store Sales
Table 4 presents the regression results from both
stages of
the estimation procedure together. The
ﬁrst-stage results are the same for all speciﬁca-
tions reported in this table. The short- and long-
run labor input elasticities (0.279 and 0.516, respec-
tively) differ in a predictable direction, implying that

bObservations for the ﬁrst stage are store weeks; labor input is instrumented with its lags from 2 to 5.
c“Development need” is the base category.
dShare of employees working 30+ hours per week is the base category.

it takes longer than one week for sales to react to
an extra hour worked. The reduction in the magni-
tude of the long-run labor input elasticity to 0.516
from 1.02 estimated earlier is consistent with our
hypothesis that last year’s sales shocks persist. The

sum of the long-run labor elasticity, 0.516, plus the
capital (store space) elasticity of approximately 0.11
in our preferred speciﬁcation (column (6)) gives a

an interior solution). Thus, our two-step procedure,
which uses weekly, within-store variation in labor
input—independent of last year’s sales shocks—is
required to derive reasonable labor input elasticity
and returns to scale parameters.

Turning to the KBI grades, we ﬁrst enter them into
the sales equation one by one (column (1)) and then
together (columns (2)–(7)) with the aim of detecting
overlaps and ﬁnding which one is most important.
Looking at column (1), which contains estimates from
six separate regressions, one for each KBI, most KBIs
are individually signiﬁcant. Yet whenever all six KBIs
are included together (for instance, in column (2))
only commercial awareness remains signiﬁcant. The
loss of individual signiﬁcance of KBI grades indicates
substantial intercorrelations between different KBIs,
probably as a result of overlapping deﬁnitions. Yet
evidently it is the special characteristics of commer-
cial awareness that are important for sales because its
coefﬁcients are similar whether entered separately or
jointly. As noted above, these characteristics consist
mainly of entrepreneurial skills, such as monitoring
local competition and efﬁcient use of resources subject
to the wage budget rule. These skills are not assessed
based on sales, so the estimates for commercial aware-
ness are unlikely to be driven by reverse causality.

Our next step is to address the issue of nonrandom
allocation of managers to stores, which, as discussed
in §3.5, results in an upward bias for the KBI esti-
mates. We concentrate on the most important com-
mercial awareness KBI, beginning with column (3),
where, for simplicity, the commercial awareness score
is used instead of grade dummies. Following the pro-
cedure outlined in §3.5, we introduce quartile ﬁxed
effects as partial controls for the unobservables, and
their cross-products with the commercial awareness
score, thus allowing each quartile of store size to have
its own bias to the commercial awareness score esti-
mate (column (4)). We see that, consistent with the
predicted upward bias, the estimate for the commer-
cial awareness score goes down from 0.078 in col-
umn (3) to 0.058 in column (4). The quartile ﬁxed
effects are highly signiﬁcant, but the cross-products
are not (restrictions test p-value = 0!70), so we skip
them in columns (5)–(7). Their insigniﬁcance implies
that the bias due to nonrandom allocation of man-
agers to stores is approximately the same for big
stores as for small. Comparing the estimates for the
commercial awareness score in the speciﬁcations with
the quartile ﬁxed effects (0.067, column (5)) and with-
out (0.078, column (3)) shows that this bias is not
large. Turning to our preferred speciﬁcation with KBI
grade dummies (column (6)), we see that control-
ling for quartile ﬁxed effects reduces the estimates for
grade capable from 0.100 (column (2)) to 0.092, i.e.,

9.2% higher sales than grade development need, and
for grade strength from 0.165 to 0.139.

In addition to individual KBIs, we introduce dum-
mies for the overall grade (an indicator based on the
sum of KBI scores; see §3.3) to ﬁnd out whether there
is a joint effect of several KBIs not captured by their
individual estimates. We ﬁnd (column (7)) that sets of
different competencies matter beyond their individ-
ual components, supporting the management practice
complementarity view (Macdufﬁe 1995, Ichniowski
et al. 1997). Our results imply that failing to develop
some minimal proﬁciency in all competence areas
(overall grade C) results in 8.3% lower sales. Yet
excelling in overall performance (grade A or B) as
opposed to particular competencies brings little addi-
tional beneﬁt (1.3%, and insigniﬁcant). Still,
in all
speciﬁcations, the commercial awareness KBI retains
its importance.

Turning to the controls, we see that paying
higher wages relative to competitors’ enters posi-
tively, reﬂecting presumably the better quality of
attracted workers. Sales tend to be higher in wealthier
areas and in areas where there are clusters of com-
petitors. Importantly, many controls lose magnitude
and signiﬁcance once quartile ﬁxed effects, proxy-
ing for unobservables in our analysis, are introduced.
The case of local competition is instructive. Its loss
of importance suggests that much of its correlation
with sales was due to its correlation with the unob-
servables such as special location, which are now
better controlled. Thus, the implication is that it is
not that high competition results in more sales, but
rather that more competitors are lured to more advan-
tageous locations.3 Picking up location, the quartile
ﬁxed effects also contribute to the control for capital,
whose estimate goes down as we introduce them.

5. Managing the Managers
We have seen that
the company has a substan-
tial minority (approximately 18%, Table 3) of under-
performing store managers,
i.e., those with grade
development need for commercial awareness, whose
stores generate signiﬁcantly less sales than com-
parable stores with more capable managers. To
some extent, the wide distribution of manager skill
grades within our company parallels Bloom and Van
Reenen’s (2007) cross-company distribution, which
reveals “huge heterogeneity” (p. 1379) and a long tail
of managers with low skill ratings. However, their

3 It might be thought, alternatively, that the effect of competition
on performance fully manifests itself in better management (as in
Grifﬁths 2001). However, competition is insigniﬁcant in the size
quartile ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation even when the management KBIs
are excluded.

ﬁnding that poor family-owned company manage-
ment accounts for some of this tail clearly cannot
apply in our case where ownership is held constant.
Their other ﬁnding, that more intense competition
leads to weeding out bad managers, seems more
applicable but requires an investigation into the prac-
tices of managing store managers, which is the topic
of the present section.

We consider three broad ways to manage store
managers, ﬁrst by matching managers to appropri-
ate stores, second by weeding out the poor managers
as they reveal themselves, and ﬁnally by provid-
ing incentives to the existing management
team.
As regards matching managers to stores, we report in
Table 5 the results of regressing the managers’ com-
mercial awareness score on their store size (measured
as log annual labor input) and area characteristics.
We ﬁnd, consistent with Lucas’s (1978) theory, that
store size measured in log annual
labor input is
the single most
important correlate of manager
skill grade in a given store, whether other possi-
ble factors, including local competition, are present
(columns (2)–(4)) or not (column (1)). That said, the
estimated elasticity of commercial awareness score to
store size (0.355) is rather small, implying a mere
0.3 standard deviation increase in the average com-
mercial awareness score with a one standard devia-
tion increase in store size. (Ordered probit and logit
estimators that we have used as alternatives to the
ordinary least squares estimator in Table 5 give simi-
larly low elasticity.) Thus, the allocation of managers
to stores does not look very precise.

Turning to the possibility of weeding out the poor
managers, the distribution of manager skill grades
is hard to improve for several reasons. First, store
managers tend to be attached to their locality, and
with an average salary of £21,000 per year (just under
the national average) attracting new talent is difﬁcult.
Second, as our top management informants explained,

it is expensive in the UK legal context to weed out
the bad managers through dismissal. The option of
demotion is also disruptive. Third, management tal-
ent is difﬁcult to identify, especially as it appears to
be highly company speciﬁc (see discussion of the pay
regressions below). Therefore, because the company
is unable to improve the quality of its store manager
pool easily, it is left with the option of incentivizing its
managers to perform to the best of their ability, as we
show next.

5.1. A Model of Incentive Pay
in the spirit
Consider an incentive pay model
(see also Holmström and
of Holmström’s (1979)
Milgrom 1987), with a risk-neutral company and a
risk-averse manager, but which includes manager
skill. In year t, the manager produces output (y),
which depends on her effort ((), observable to her
only, skill level (c), observable to both parties, and the
annual random shock term (+), observable to none:4

yt = +t

if (t = 0&

yt = (t + c + +t

if (t > 0!

The manager expects a wage wt+1 to be paid at the
beginning of the next period, which in part depends
on her past period’s output,
wt+1 = "+ ’+t

if (t = 0&

wt+1 = "+ ’#(t + c + +t$

if (t > 0!

She chooses the level of effort,

(∗t =

)

&

(3)

which maximizes her utility function,

U#w t+1& (t$ = E#w t+1$− )·

(2
2 − *· var#wt+1$&
t

where parameters )> 0 and *> 0 represent the cost
of effort and aversion to uncertainty over the realized
value of output.5 She will work only if her utility given
her chosen effort is no less than her utility from work-
ing elsewhere, ¯u#ht&c$ , which we assume to depend
on her skill level c and her outside options (vector ht).
The company maximizes its expected proﬁt deﬁned
as the difference between the output in period t

4 There are, of course, other determinants of output, such as store
size, but, assuming that their contribution to output does not
depend on manager’s effort, their “prices” can be agreed on in
advance rather than determined endogenously within the incentive
pay model. Therefore, we abstract from them for now for the ease
of exposition.
5 Our assumption that the cost of effort, )> 0, is invariant with
respect to manager skill level is admittedly heroic, but we test it
and ﬁnd it to hold (results are available upon request).

and the wage to be paid to the manager, having
worked out the manager’s chosen level of effort (∗t
(Equation (3)). The result of a strategic interaction
between the company and the manager is a wage
offer with the following parameters:

"∗t = ¯u#ht&c$ −

simplifying to

2)’∗t + ’∗t +t!

(4)

(5)

For the empirically relevant case of 0 <’ ∗t < 1, the
model implies that pay is determined by (i) the man-
ager’s outside alternatives (¯u#ht&c$ ) and (ii) meeting
sales expectations set by HQ given the manager’s skill
level and other inputs (+t). If these expectations are
not met, the manager takes a proportionate ’∗t cut
in her next year’s pay, and conversely if expectations
are exceeded. The dependence of a manager’s pay
on meeting HQ’s expectations helps ensure that she
applies herself even if close monitoring of her activ-
to be less than
ities is not possible. We expect ’∗t
unity because of manager risk aversion (*> 0). The
model thus also implies that managers are “insured”
by bearing only a fraction of the shock.

5.2. Store Manager Pay Regression Speciﬁcation
We now develop a suitable proxy for +t and test the
above model by estimating the manager pay equa-
tion (5). It might be thought that Equation (5) can
be estimated directly by using the available store and
manager data and the estimated second-stage error
term from the sales regression (error2nd stage
) as a proxy
for the annual random shock term +. The problem
with this direct approach is that error2nd stage
contains
components observable to both HQ and store man-
agers (and therefore not part of the unexpected sales)
but not observable to us. Indeed, we show in Table 6
that error2nd stage
is not a signiﬁcant predictor of pay.
However, adding some intuitive structure to it brings
back its signiﬁcance.

Assume that the current (2005) year’s error term
from Equation (2) is a function of the last year’s error
term plus our annual random shock term (+):

effects on sales lasting longer than a year.6 Once cap-

set, the only way for a store to adapt to changes
in trading environment is to adjust its annual labor
input. Part of this adjustment happens in response
to changes in the expected value of the unobservable

result from §3.4, that in the absence of store ﬁxed effects the esti-
mate for labor input elasticity is biased upward because of labor
input’s correlation with store unobservables containing last year’s
unexpected sales.

the controls in Equation (2) including the KBIs and
quartile ﬁxed effects, denoted as vector xi),

ln Li = xi- + .i&

and use the estimated residuals from this regression
( ˆ.i) as a proxy for error2nd stage
in Equation (6). We then
recover + as the residual of the second-stage sales
equation (2), which we rerun with ˆ.i included as a
separate regressor:

!ﬁxed effecti = ’1 ln#space$i + ’2KBIi

Note that, because ˆ.i
is independent of all of the
observed regression variables in the sales equation by
construction (see Equation (7)), all of the estimates in
Table 4 remain the same.

5.3. Manager Pay Regression Results
Table 6 reports the regression results for log store
manager total annual pay in 2006. As can be seen
from column (1), the annual random shock term mea-
sured simply as the second-stage error (error2nd stage)
from the sales regression is unimportant for store
manager pay. Consequently, our procedure for recov-
ering + via Equation (8)
is indeed necessary to
reveal the incentives available to store managers.
Columns (2) and (3) then demonstrate that, once we
correct error2nd stage for persistent unobservables that
both managers and HQ can predict, it becomes a sig-
niﬁcant determinant of pay. This result supports our
incentive pay model (Equation (5)).

The incentives to perform come from the possibil-
ity of failing to meet sales expectations, which then
means a cut in the next year’s pay. The 0.233 elastic-
ity result shows the proportion in which unexpected
sales gains and losses are shared between the man-
agers and the company. It is the manager’s aversion
to risk (*> 0, see Equation (4)) that limits full sharing.
Thus, a 10% change in + (not unusual and close to +’s
standard deviation of 0.11) results in a 2.3% change in
a store manager’s pay.

As can be seen from Table 6, there is no signif-
icant link between pay and commercial awareness.
This ﬁnding parallels that of Bloom and Van Reenen’s
(2007, p. 1386), who also ﬁnd no link between the
management score in a ﬁrm and its CEO’s pay. Com-
parison of columns (2) and (3) shows that there is
no link whether or not we control for other potential
correlates of manager skill grade, such as manager
age and experience, or pay for a similar job and local
competition, which proxy the outside opportunities
available to managers. The implication is that the KBI
commercial awareness measures a type of company-
speciﬁc manager skill that raises sales in company

stores as we have seen but that is not easily tradable
on the outside labor market.

Turning to the other determinants of manager
pay, we see that pay is 4.3% higher for male store
managers and for those living in areas with higher
managerial pay (an elasticity of 0.354)—presumably
reﬂecting the more generous outside options available
to them. Managing more workers attracts a signiﬁcant
premium as well (0.284), which is consistent with the
greater responsibilities of running a larger store and
has nothing to do with rewarding skill.

6. Discussion
6.1. Management and Economic Performance:

Some Illustrations

We ﬁnd that the most important management skill is
commercial awareness, which rewards efﬁcient use of
store space and workforce, sticking to the wage bud-
get, and watching competitors. Variation in commer-
cial awareness is responsible for a sizable portion of
variation in labor productivity. Using the results from
our preferred speciﬁcation (column (6) in Table 4) we
ﬁnd that moving from the bottom quartile of the dis-
tribution of commercial awareness (i.e., development
need, 18% of the sample) to the top quartile (strength,
26%) is associated with a 13.9% improvement in sales,
which, holding all factor inputs constant, results in
the same improvement in labor productivity. With the
interquartile range in store labor productivity at 40%,
commercial awareness accounts for approximately
35% (=13.9/40) of it. Continuing to assume the cost of
sales to be a constant fraction of sales, we calculate the
interquartile range of store total factor productivity
(TFP) at 52%;7 hence, commercial awareness accounts
for approximately 27% of
the interquartile range
in TFP.

Based on our regression results in Table 4, let us
now calculate the contribution to sales, △/, of man-
ager skills higher than grade development need. We
compare actual sales with some plausible counterfac-
tuals as follows:

△/ =

2+k=0

#Sa

k − Sc

(9)

where k = 0& 1& 2 is an indicator for commercial aware-
ness grade (0 = development need, 2 = strength), Sa& c
are the actual (a) and counterfactual (c) shares of

k

7 We calculate TFP as the term A from the Cobb-Douglas sales func-
tion, giving TFP = log sales−0!516×log number of hours worked−
0!116 × log store space. This measure includes the contribution of
the cost of sales, which, given that it is proportional to sales, does
not affect TFP’s interquartile range.

worker-hours controlled by managers of grade k in

We calculate the shares in total labor controlled by
managers of different grades taking into account the
differences in the size of the stores run by them, giving
2 = 0!357. From Table 4,
0 = 0!134, Sa

0 = Gc

in the counterfactual that all managers are develop-

(that is, the share in total workforce controlled by each
grade is equal to its share in the store manager skill
grades distribution), so that Gc
2 = 0, and
2 = 0!261 (see Table 3). Sub-
0 = 0!176, Sc

stituting these parameter values into Equation (9), we
calculate the contribution at 9.6% of the actual sales,
or £23 million for our sample.

1 = 0!092, and Ga

1 = 0!563, Sc

1 = Gc

0 = Gc

Rewriting Equation (9), we can break down the
total 9.6% contribution into two components: (i) that
due to allocation of abler managers to bigger stores,
holding gains from manager skills ﬁxed, and (ii) that
due to manager skills alone, holding store size equal
for all managers, as follows:

Given our chosen counterfactual, the ﬁrst compo-
nent (manager allocation) contributes only 0.9% of the
total 9.6%, and the second component makes up the
remaining 8.7%. The small contribution of manager
allocation is consistent with the weak link between
store size and commercial awareness score reported in
Table 5. Moreover, the gains from manager allocation
would remain limited even if abler managers always
ran larger stores. For instance, even under a per-
fect correspondence of manager skill grade and store
size rank, the total contribution of management skills
to sales would be 10.8%, a mere 1.2-point increase.
Hence most of the sales gains from manager skills are
independent of manager allocation by store size.

6.2. Our Results and Other Studies
Because store manager skills are highly speciﬁc and
difﬁcult to allocate among stores in the short run, our
results help explain part of persistent interworkplace
differences in productivity documented in the litera-
ture (Bartelsman and Doms 2000, Grifﬁths et al. 2006).
It is instructive to compare our quantitative ﬁnd-
ings for management with those in the studies closest
to ours. Our estimate of the share of the interquar-
tile range of store TFP explained by store manage-
ment, 27%, is higher than Bloom and Van Reenen’s’s
(2007) 10%–23%. A possible explanation for this dif-
ference is that in a cross-company study such as theirs
it is harder to control for company-speciﬁc factors
affecting the relationship between management and

productivity. As a result, this relationship may be
blurred by “contingent management” (pp. 1371–1374),
whereby practices are employed in different combi-
nations as beﬁts the company in question. The blur-
ring occurs through combining many management
practices, some of which are irrelevant to productiv-
ity, into one z-score, which effectively increases the
measurement error component in the management
regressor, therefore resulting in an attenuated esti-
mate. Thus, when we put grades from all of the KBIs
into a management z-score, its interquartile variation
explains only a 6% movement in store productiv-
ity, thereby accounting for only 6/52 = 12% of the
interquartile store TFP range, on a par with Bloom
and Van Reenen’s (2007) 10%–23%.

On the other hand, if aggregating individual com-
petencies into a z-score attenuates the estimate for
management because of measurement error, the ques-
tion arises as to why our estimate of the share of
the interquartile store productivity range explained
by management (35%) is close to the 40% found
by Grifﬁths et al. (2006), which they derive from
the management score aggregating over 11 measures.
The reason seems to be fewer controls used in their
study, a possibility that they do anticipate (p. 523).
Thus, when we control only for labor input
(as
they do), the interquartile range in our management
z-score explains nearly 70% of the interquartile store
productivity range. Hence, the degree of detail in
management data and statistical controls are equally
important for the quantitative results of a manage-
ment study.

Although most of our ﬁndings so far are consistent
with the existing literature, our ﬁnding that compe-
tence in developing people is insigniﬁcant for sales
seems to contradict the many studies showing the
importance of high-performance HRM practices for
ﬁrm performance (e.g., Ichniowski et al. 1997). There
will be no contradiction, however, if one acknowl-
edges the context of this company’s business and the
coexistence of different work systems within it. Such
high-performance HRM practices as selection, train-
ing, and pay for performance are clearly important
for core employees such as store managers. On the
other hand, the sales assistants, who are predomi-
nantly part-time and inexpensive to replace, receive
a much lighter HRM package from the company,
and store managers can contribute only marginally.
The coexistence of different work systems within one
company—in our case, one for managers, another for
sales assistants—is not unusual and has been found
before (Leepak et al. 2007).

Turning to the manager pay results, our 0.23 esti-
mate of the elasticity of pay with respect to the annual
random shock term + is slightly to the right of the
range of estimates reported in the literature for the


1412

elasticity of CEO compensation to share returns, for
example, Murphy’s (1986) 0.14, Barro and Barro’s
(1990) 0.17, and Conyon and Murphy’s (2000) 0.12 for
the United Kingdom and 0.27 for the United States.
Admittedly, we should not push comparisons from
such different regression speciﬁcations too far. But,
noting that our measure of + may be regarded as
similar to unexpected share returns, it is interesting
that our estimate of the key incentive pay parame-
ter appears to be broadly consistent with those previ-
ously reported.

Our results ﬁt with the literature even more closely
when it comes to the elasticity of manager pay with
respect to ﬁrm (store) size. Our 0.284 estimate (Table 7)
is well within the range of estimates reported: 0.22 for
UK and 0.41 for U.S. ﬁrms (Conyon and Murphy’s
2000); 0.37 for the top 1,000 U.S. corporations (Gabaix
and Landier 2008); 0.32 for U.S. banks (Barro and
Barro’s 1990); 0.25 for Canadian publicly traded ﬁrms
(Zhou 2000); and 0.25 for small U.S. ﬁrms (total assets
up to 150 million 1993 U.S. dollars) in Cyert et al.
(2002). This range is fairly narrow, considering differ-
ences in samples with respect to time, country, and
industry, but our result ﬁts neatly within it. The simi-
larities between our pay results for middle managers
and those from studies of CEOs are noteworthy and
suggest that similar incentive mechanisms are at work
at the middle as well as the top of the management
hierarchy.

Finally, the manager pay results indicate that store
manager skills in our company, particularly commer-
cial awareness skills, are highly speciﬁc. They are
important for sales and yet are not rewarded. This
ﬁnding might seem surprising, but it accords exactly
with the result in Bloom and Van Reenen’s (2007), that
CEO pay is not correlated with the management score
(p. 1386). The implication is that the market for man-
ager skills is more limited than might be expected.8
Admittedly, the description of commercial awareness
(Table 2) appears to reveal a mixture of general skills
(e.g., manpower planning) and speciﬁc skills (e.g.,
making the best use of a store’s space), as envisaged
in the human capital literature starting from Becker
(1964). Yet, in our case of store managers, even though
we seem to have the usual mixture of general and
speciﬁc skills, these skills are more speciﬁc than might
be thought.

8 Hence we have Peter Drucker’s (1974) classic statement that “It
is an admission of bankruptcy for a big business to have to go on
the outside to recruit into top management. It is also a desperate
gamble” (p. 662). Thus, although much is made of the ﬂuid market
for managers, it seems in fact that most managers, from top man-
agers (Bailey and Helfat 2003) down to our small store managers,
are groomed within their ﬁrms.

7. Conclusions
In this paper we have looked into the black box
of the middle management input in the production
function of a ﬁrm and how this input is shaped by
ﬁrmwide corporate governance practices. To do so,
we have used data from a single ﬁrm. Our study thus
shares the “insider econometrics” paradigm (Bartel
et al. 2004) with other studies of the management—
performance link, such as Ichniowski et al. (1997) and
Grifﬁths et al. (2006). To Crossland and Hambrick’s
(2007) consideration of “macro environment” con-
straints on management, our study can be seen as
analyzing the micro environment. Let us summarize
our ﬁndings and their implications.

We ﬁnd a strong link between the company’s mea-
sure of manager skill grade—the KBIs—and store
sales performance, and we believe that
this link
is causal. The company’s procedures are objective.
Moreover, our allowing for store size effects provides
a powerful control that reduces simultaneity between
manager quality and store performance. The core of
our study, the management measure and its effect on
performance, is therefore meaningful.

The middle manager skills that we ﬁnd most
important are described by the KBI for commercial
awareness. It encapsulates entrepreneurial skills, such
as monitoring local competition and making efﬁcient
use of available resources. Differences in commer-
cial awareness skills between store managers explain
a considerable part of inter-store productivity differ-
ences: 27%–35%, depending on the measure. The esti-
mated total contribution to sales of manager skills
above grade “development need” is 9.6% of the total
actually observed. Thus, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant con-
tribution of middle (store) management to produc-
tivity. This result shows that “management matters”
(Hambrick and Mason 1984) and speciﬁcally supports
Kanter’s (2004) research on the importance of the
middle management tier.

At the same time, we ﬁnd a long tail of poor
managers, comparable with that found between ﬁrms
(Bloom and Van Reenen’s 2007), and this motivates
our inquiry into the ﬁrmwide practices of manag-
ing the managers. Of these we have considered in
detail allocating managers to stores of different size
and incentivizing them through pay-for-performance
contracts. We have found that abler managers tend
to be assigned to larger stores, but their allocation is
rather imprecise. However, our results also suggest
that, even if allocation of managers to stores is perfect,
securing the gains from manager skills still requires
overcoming agency issues, especially when company
operations are so dispersed geographically.

We show with an adaptation of Holmström’s (1979)
incentive pay model that the corporate governance
practice of annual manager salary review helps
accomplish this task. In support of our incentive pay

1413

model, we ﬁnd that the process of salary review works
to give an expected annual sales value for the manager
in her store (which we assume is determined by the
sales function that we estimate). Our ﬁndings show
that positive/negative deviations are indeed propor-
tionately rewarded/punished.

At the same time, we ﬁnd that, while controlling
manager effort, the company does not seem to reward
middle manager skills, because higher-graded store
managers do not receive higher pay all else equal.
The implication here is that not only are top man-
ager skills speciﬁc (Bailey and Helfat 2003) and gen-
erally difﬁcult to trade or imitate, but so are middle
manager skills. This ﬁnding therefore suggests that it
makes sense for organizations to develop their man-
agement resources in-house—as a source of competi-
tive advantage that cannot be easily bid away.
