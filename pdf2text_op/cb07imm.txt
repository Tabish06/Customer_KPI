Abstract

Branding research has largely focused on consumer goods markets and only recently has attention been given to business markets. In many
business markets the company’s reputation has a strong influence on buying decisions which may differ from the more specific product related
influence of the brand’s image. In this paper we investigate these differences by testing the hypotheses about the influences of brand image and
company reputation on customers’ perceptions of product and service quality, customer value, and customer loyalty in a business market where
there are three manufacturers marketing their brands directly to a large number of small firms. The results indicate that the brand’s image has a
more specific influence on the customers’ perceptions of product and service quality while the company’s reputation has a broader influence on
perceptions of customer value and customer loyalty.

1. Introduction

The initial focus of branding research has been about
consumers’ associations and their beliefs about the attributes of
the brand (e.g. Keller, 1993). However, when Berry (2000)
examined branding in consumer service settings, what was
found to be more important was the brand’s ‘‘meaning’’ that the
customers derived from the service experiences they have. In
these situations the reputation of the company can have a major
influence on the buyer process and consumption experience.
Hence, Berry (2000, p. 128) suggests that ‘‘the company’’
becomes the primary brand rather than the product. In many
business markets the company’s service also plays a major role
because there is a need for technical advice about the products.
Hence, like consumer service markets, the company’s reputa-
tion is likely to have an important influence on the buying
processes that is different to the product specific influence of
the brand’s image. Given that there are substantial marketing

investments in building brand image and building company
reputation, this is an area requiring investigation.

While there has been considerable research about branding
and company (corporate)2 reputation, these two streams of
research have been largely independent. Only recently there
has been an attempt to understand the different influences of
company reputation and brand image on buying processes
(Balmer, 2001). In business markets it is common for the
company’s name to also be the brand name across a range of
product groups. In these situations the reputation associated
with the company’s name acts as the umbrella brand for the
range of product categories, while the brand images will be
specific to the particular product category. Thus, it is necessary
to distinguish between the influences of the brand’s image that
are associated with a specific product category, and the broader
influence of the company’s reputation.

One way to distinguish between brand image and company
reputation is to examine the different influences they have on
the processes that create perceptions of customer value and

2 While the term ‘‘company reputation’’ is used more in practice the literature
has tended to use the term ‘‘corporate reputation’’. In this paper we have chosen
to use ‘‘company reputation’’.

customer loyalty for the company’s products. Understanding
the nature of these processes has recently received attention in
marketing by both academics and consultants in service
markets (e.g. Gale, 1994; Kordupleski, Rust & Zahorik,
1993; Rust, Lemon & Zeithaml, 2004) and also in business
markets (Eggert & Ulga, 2002). However, research in this area
has given little explicit attention to distinguishing between the
influences of brand image and company reputation.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated model
that explicitly accounts for influences of brand image and
company reputation on business customers’ perceptions of
quality, value and loyalty. The study had three international
companies that marketed beauty care products where the
companies’ names were also used as the brand names for a
range of product categories. Each company had a strong
reputation associated with their company name for the range
of products that were marketed across the categories. The
particular business market chosen was for shampoo products
that were sold directly to hair salons. In this established market
each company had a shampoo brand with a distinctive image that
emphasized benefits that were specific to the hair care market.
This research provides a general application to business
markets where few manufacturers sell to a large number of small
(micro) firms. The research extends Mudambi’s (2002) explor-
atory study which examined the influences of branding and
company reputation in a business market. While the Mudambi
study focused on customer choice, our study focuses on the
value loyalty process. In this process, the trade-off between
perceived quality and costs determines perceived customer
value, which in turn determines customer loyalty. Thus we can
examine whether brand image has a more specific influence on
the perception of product quality and whether company
reputation has a broader influence on perceived customer value
and customer loyalty. In addition, by focusing on value creation,
the study responds to the Institute of the Study for Business
Markets (2003) priority area of research of ‘‘how to better create,
measure, and deliver customer value in business markets’’.

The paper proceeds as follows: in the literature review section
we examine branding in business markets, the process of delive-
ring customer value, and research about the constructs of brand
image and company reputation. The next section develops the
conceptual model and the hypotheses and the following sections
describe the methodology, the results, and the implications.

2. Background literature

2.1. Branding in business markets

With the increasing emphasis on services in all markets, the
differences in marketing practices in consumer and business
markets are diminishing (Vargo & Lusch, 2004). However, some
differences may exist when it comes to branding (Mudambi,
2002, p. 527). This is because the buying processes for business
markets involve more direct
interactions with the selling
organisation. Products may be more technical and personal
selling can also play an important role in building relationships
between the buyer and seller. In addition, there may be more

emphasis on the rational or technical aspects and less emphasis on
the self-expressive and emotional benefits of brands (Wilson,
2000). Thus for business markets it is necessary to have a broader
based conceptual framework than has traditionally been used to
investigate brands in consumer markets. This framework will
need to distinguish between the more specific product related
influences associated with the brand image and the broader
experiences the customer has with the company including the
relationships the customer may develop with the sales represen-
tative. While research that focuses on understanding the influence
of the brand image will still be important, it will also be necessary
to integrate the more recent research that has examined the
influences of company and corporate reputation.

Our

review of branding research in business markets
indicates that it has largely been exploratory and there has
been little systematic development and testing of comprehen-
sive models. Table 1 provides a summary of
the more
important published studies. The first two studies examine
the importance of the brand name in business markets, while
the other studies start to develop more comprehensive frame-
works. The most recent of these studies by Bendixen, Bukasa
and Abratt
(2004) used customer choice experiments to
examine the relative importance of
‘‘the brand’’ versus
‘‘delivery’’, ‘‘price’’, ‘‘technology’’ and ‘‘availability of spare
parts’’. However, with the exception of the study by Mudambi
(2002), little explicit attention has been given to distinguishing
between influence brand image and company reputation.

Mudambi’s (2002) model includes product attributes (phys-
ical product properties,
the price), service attributes (the
technical support services, the ordering and delivery services,
the quality of the working relationship) and branding attributes
(how well known the supplier is, the general reputation of the
supplier). This exploratory study, which was based on a sample
of 116 UK firms, revealed that a third of the firms were
‘‘branding receptive’’, and that these firms were more loyal to a
particular supplier. While the Mudambi (2002) study provides
a good starting point by distinguishing between the influences
of brand name and company reputation, further refinement is
needed. We suggest
this can come from focusing on the
influences of brand image and company reputation on the
customer value and customer loyalty process.

2.2. The customer value and customer loyalty process

Understanding the processes that create customers’ percep-
tion of value which in turn leads to customer loyalty is a
fundamental
issue in contemporary marketing because it
provides the link between marketing and financial performance
(Reichheld, Markey & Hopton, 2000). Hence, the area has
received considerable attention by both consultants and
researchers in the last two decades. As with the development
of any new area, there has been discussion and debate about the
alternative ways perceived customer value can be defined (e.g.
Zeithaml, 1988 p. 13) and this has led to different methodol-
ogies to measure it (Payne & Holt, 2001; Woodruff, 1997;).
However there is a general consensus that perceived customer
value determines customer loyalty.

The reason to focus on perceived customer value as opposed
to customer satisfaction is because customer value is a better
predictor of customer loyalty (Rust, Zahorik & Keiningham,
1995). The approach proposed by Rust et al. (1995) and Gale
(1994) draws on Zeithaml’s (1988 p. 14) assumption that the
customers’ perceptions of the value of the firm’s offering are
derived from the trade-off between the benefits (i.e. perceptions
of product and service quality) of the firm’s offer, and sacrifices
(i.e. prices and non-monetary costs) of the offer. This is
referred to as ‘‘worth what paid for’’. The perceptions of the
‘‘benefits’’ of product and service quality are not only limited to
functional aspects (physical attributes, service attributes and
technical support) of the offering but can include emotional
components so both the cognitive and affective influences of
brand image can be incorporated (Brady & Cronin, 2001;
Patterson & Spreng, 1997).

While research using the customer value framework has
included brand image as one of the influences on product and
service quality, little explicit attention has been given to how
company reputation influences the process. Because company
reputation is linked with the organisation’s values, vision and
purpose, it can be expected to have a broader influence. This
means it may have a more direct impact on perceptions of
customer value and customer loyalty (Balmer, 2001). In our
study we explore these alternative influences of brand image
and company reputation.

2.3. Brand image

Brand image has been defined as the consumer’s mental
picture of the offering (Dobni & Zinkhan, 1990), and it

includes symbolic meanings that consumers associate with the
specific attributes of the product or service (Padgett & Allen,
is seen as the representation of a brand in the
1997). It
consumer’s mind that
is linked to an offering (Dobni &
Zinkhan, 1990), or a set of perceptions about a brand the
consumer forms as reflected by brand associations (Keller,
1993). Hence it can be defined as ‘‘. . .the reasoned or
emotional perceptions consumers attach to specific brands’’
(Low & Lamb, 2000, p. 352). In business markets brand image
can also be expected to play an important role, especially
where it is difficult to differentiate products or services based
on tangible quality features (Mudambi, Doyle & Wong, 1997).

2.4. Company reputation

The influence of company reputation, or what

is often
referred to as corporate reputation, can be expected to become
more important when there are higher levels of service. In
many business markets there is a large service component
because of the technical nature of the products. Hence the
seller’s reputation is an important influence.

Company reputation has been broadly described as the long-
term combination of the stakeholders’ assessment about ‘‘what
the firm is’’, ‘‘how well the firm meets its commitments and
conforms to stakeholders’ expectations’’, and ‘‘how well the
firm’s overall performance fits with its socio-political environ-
ment’’ (Logsdon & Wood, 2002). Consequently, company
(corporate) reputation has been defined as ‘‘a particular type of
feed-back received by an organisation from its stakeholders,
concerning the credibility of the organisation’s identity claims’’
(Whetten & Mackey, 2002, p. 401).

233

While the company’s reputation is derived from perceptions
of all stakeholders, Wartick (2002, p. 377) suggests it
is
pragmatic to focus just on the immediate customers, as they
usually are the group that have the major influence. Greyser
(1999) identifies three general influences that the company’s
reputation can have on its customers. The first relates to
differentiating customers’ perceptions of
the product and
service quality, so it is similar to the influence of the brand’s
image. The second and third are broader
influences on
customers’ perceptions of financial value and their loyalty to
the company.

3. Conceptual model and hypotheses

In this study we use the customer value methods developed
by Gale (1994) and Rust et al. (1995). We extend their work
by paying explicit attention to the influences of brand image
and company reputation. The model and hypotheses are
provided in Fig. 1. The model
is made up of the core
customer value and loyalty process where customers’ trade-off
between benefits (quality) and sacrifices (price and costs)
determine perceptions of customer value, which then deter-
mines customer loyalty. Brand image and company reputation
are hypothesised to have multiple primary and secondary
influences on perceptions of product and service quality,
perceptions of customer value and customer loyalty. We also
recognize that while brand image and company reputation are
distinctly different constructs, they are likely to be associated
and have a mediating influence on each other. This is
especially the case in business markets where the company
name is used as the brand name.

We now provide justification for the hypotheses about the

relationships that underpin our conceptual model.

been provided in a qualitative study by Brown, Easingwood
and Murphy (2001) and quantitative studies of service markets
by Andreassen and Lindestad (1998) and Bloemer, de Ruyter
and Peeters (1998). We propose H1a as a primary hypothesis
due the specific influence the brand image is likely to have.

H1a. Brand image has a positive impact on perceived quality.

While the primary influence of the brand’s image is likely to
be on customers’ perceptions of quality there is some evidence
that it may also influence customer choice (Andreassen &
Lindestad, 1998; Bloemer et al., 1998) and the perceptions of
customer value (Maklan & Knox, 1997). However,
this
evidence is based on consumer markets so we propose H1b
as a secondary hypothesis.

H1b. Brand image has a positive impact on customer value.

In addition, the brand’s image may also have an influence
on consumer loyalty (Zeithaml, 1988; Selnes, 1993; and Zins,
2001). As H1b we propose H1c as a secondary hypothesis.

H1c. Brand image has a positive impact on customer loyalty.

3.2. The influence of company reputation on perceived quality,
perceived customer value and loyalty

Consumer research shows the reputation of a company may
be used as a heuristic for judging the quality of the offering
(Dawar & Parker, 1994; Hoyer & Brown, 1990; Jacoby,
Szybillo & Berning, 1976; Rao & Monroe, 1989). Other
consumer research shows customers use signals or extrinsic
cues, such as advertising, brand image or company reputation,
to infer product quality and to refine their choices (Bolton &
Drew, 1991; Richardson, Dick & Jain, 1994; Teas & Agarwal,
2000). In addition, a firm with a good reputation is likely to be
perceived by customers as being more trustworthy and credible
as opposed to one with a poor reputation which will positively
influence the perceived quality of the offering (Chen &
Dubinsky, 2003). While company reputation may influence
perceptions of quality its influence is not
likely to be as
immediate as the influence of brand image. Thus we propose
H2a as a secondary hypothesis.

H2a. Company reputation positively influences perceived
quality.

Company reputation is a broader construct than brand image
and hence it is more likely to have a strong influence on the
perceptions of customer value (de la Fuente Sabate & de
Quevedo Puente, 2003). In particular Mudambi et al. (1997)
suggest that aspects of reputation such as ‘‘being world class’’,
‘‘technical
leadership’’ and ‘‘global presence’’ have the
potential to influence perceptions of customer value. Empirical
research that has demonstrated a positive influence of company
reputation on customers’ perception of value includes studies
by Shapiro (1983) and Yoon, Guffey and Kijewski (1993). In
another study of a business market, company reputation has
been found to be ranked second behind price in influencing the
value of an offering (Lehmann & O’Shaughnessy, 1974). Also,


234

A.E. Cretu, R.J. Brodie / Industrial Marketing Management 36 (2007) 230 – 240

Brown and Dacin (1997) have shown that the associations
customers have about the reputation of a retailer influence the
perception of the value of what they purchase from a store.
Based on the strong theoretical and empirical evidence we
propose H2b as a primary hypothesis.

H2b. Company reputation positively influences customer
value.

In service industries, company associations may also play an
important role, not only in attracting customers but also in
retaining customers (Andreassen & Lindestad, 1998). Empir-
ical research that links the effect of company reputation to
loyalty includes studies by Ryan, Rayner and Morrison (1999),
Raj (1985) and Zins (2001). Service associated with personal
selling can also play an important role in the business markets
so we propose H2c as a primary hypothesis.

H2c. Company reputation positively influences customer
loyalty.

3.3. The core customer value and customer loyalty process

In addition to the hypotheses about brand image and
company reputation, three hypotheses about the core processes
in framework are included. Perceptions of customer value can
be viewed as a trade-off between perceived benefits (i.e.
perceived product and services quality) and perceived sacri-
fices (i.e. prices and costs, both monetary and non-monetary).
these relationships includes
Empirical research to support
studies by Gale (1994), Hurley and Laitamaki
(1995),
Laitamaki and Kordupleski (1997), Higgins (1998) and Rust,
Lemon and Zeithaml (2001). Hence the following hypotheses
are proposed:

H3. There is a positive relationship between perceived quality
and customer value.

H4. There is a positive relationship between prices and costs
and customer value.

There is considerable practical experience and empirical
evidence to show that perceptions of customer value have a
positive influence on customer loyalty (e.g. Gale, 1994; Hurley
& Laitamaki, 1995; Laitamaki & Kordupleski, 1997; Rust,
Danaher & Varki, 2000; Rust et al., 1995, 2000; Zeithaml,
1988). Hence the following hypothesis is proposed:

H5. Customer value has a positive impact on customer loyalty.

4. Methodology

4.1. Choice of study area and data collection

In order to test the hypotheses we chose an established
business market where three large manufacturers sold shampoo
products to a large number of hair salons. The three
multinational firms comprised approximately 80% of the total
market, with the rest of the market being made up of five
smaller suppliers each with market shares of 5% or less. Each

of these multinationals used its company name as its brand
name and all three had strong reputations associated with their
company names. The hair salons were relatively small and they
usually had a manager and a number of hairdressers. The three
competing companies had active sales teams who regularly
visited the salons and sold directly and not through interme-
diaries. The buying was usually undertaken by the manager of
the salon. Personal selling had a major influence and there was
a lot of interaction between the sales-people and the salon
managers which resulted in the companies developing different
reputations. The three brands were promoted heavily with
advertising, sponsorship of fashion events and other public
relations activities which resulted in distinctly different brand
images.

The initial research involved qualitative interviews with the
managers of the hair salons to determine the drivers and sub-
drivers of product and service quality, prices and costs. A
structured questionnaire was administrated to the managers of
the salons using telephone interviews. Respondents were asked
about their recent product and service experiences with their
supplier. The survey elicited perceptual ratings for the drivers
and sub-drivers of product and service quality, prices and costs,
perceived customer value and customer loyalty using 10-point
scales anchored by 1=poor and 10=excellent. The sample was
drawn on a source list of all hair salons in the country. It
achieved a sample of 377 salons which represented 20% of the
total number of hair salons in New Zealand. It was matched
against the source list to ensure there was no sample bias due to
salon size or location.

4.2. Measures

Multiple item scales were used for the measures of brand
image, corporate reputation and customer loyalty, while single
item measures were used for the perceived quality of the
offering, the prices and costs, and the perception of customer
value.

4.2.1. Brand image

There are numerous definitions of brand image in the
literature which initially may cause confusion about what is the
best scale to use (Dobni & Zinkhan, 1990). However, because
brand image is largely ‘‘product category specific’’ (Low &
Lamb, 2000, p. 352), it is suggested that the choice of scale
should be dictated by the research problem and its context
(Christensen & Askegaard, 2001; Lemmink, Schuijf &
Streukens, 2003). Thus the scale used in this study is from a
scale developed for shampoo products by Low and Lamb
(2000). The following items were used: ‘‘well known and
prestigious’’, ‘‘fashionable and trendy’’, ‘‘having reputation for
quality’’, ‘‘elegant’’, ‘‘useful’’, ‘‘natural’’, and ‘‘sophisticated’’.

4.2.2. Company reputation

As with brand image it was also necessary to develop a
customised measure of company (corporate) reputation (Lewel-
lyn, 2002). The items used for this study were ‘‘being well
managed’’, ‘‘being product driven’’, ‘‘being successful’’, ‘‘being


A.E. Cretu, R.J. Brodie / Industrial Marketing Management 36 (2007) 230 – 240

235

innovative’’, ‘‘having customer focus’’, ‘‘keeping you informed
about what is happening with the company’’, and ‘‘being a
good corporate citizen’’. These items were derived from studies
undertaken in marketing and management by Yoon et al.
(1993), LeBlanc and Nguyen (1996), Doney and Cannon
(1997), Greyser (1999), and Deephouse (2000).

price). For example the customer’s perceptions of customer
value may be the same for a product
that has acceptable
quality (meets needs) and low price as one of high quality
and high price.

The constructs and measurement items are listed in the

Appendix.

4.2.3. Customer loyalty

4.3. Measure refinement

One way to measure customer loyalty is to focus on the
behavioural dimension of loyalty (Caruana, 2002), and have a
scale to measure repurchase intention or the intention to remain
with the company (de Ruyter & Wetzels, 2000). However,
equally important is the attitudinal component (Butcher, Sparks
& O’Callaghan, 2001). While the behavioural component
measures a particular customer’s behaviour and indicates the
repeat purchase probability (Bowen & Shoemaker, 1998),
attitudinal dimensions provide a measure of preference.
Preference is less constrained and may also provide an
indication of
the likelihood to recommend the product
(Gremler & Brown, 1996; Zins, 2001). Thus two measures
of customer loyalty were used; ‘‘the increase in the amount
spent on company’s products’’, and ‘‘the likelihood to
recommend the company to others in the trade’’.

customer value

Single items were used to measure these constructs. For
perceived product and service quality as well as for prices and
costs direct questions were asked (i.e. ‘‘Overall what rating
would you give
on providing products and
services that meet your needs?’’ and ‘‘Overall, what rating
would you give
on their prices and costs?’’ For
perceived customer value, which was defined as a trade-off
between perceived quality (i.e. benefits) and prices and costs
(i.e. sacrifices), the following question was asked ‘‘Overall,
how would you rate your purchases from
as being
worth what paid for?’’ It is important to note that the measure
of ‘‘perceived product and service quality’’ in this study is a
measure of need fulfilment rather than some absolute measure
of perceived quality. This distinction is particularly important
in this study where perceived value is conceptualized as a
trade-off between benefits and costs (includes quality versus

Internal and external consistency of the three multi-item
scales (brand image, corporate reputation and customer loyalty)
were assessed with goodness-of-fit statistics (Anderson, Gerb-
ing & Hunter, 1987) and the use of item-to-total correlation
measures (Gerbing & Anderson, 1988). The scales were
refined, and the items exhibiting low squared correlations
(below 0.5) were removed. In addition the items that had
standardised residuals from the covariance matrix which were
excessively large were removed (Gerbing & Anderson, 1988;
Steenkamp & van Trijp, 1991).

The reliabilities of the resulting scales were then examined
by calculating the Cronbach alpha statistics. The value for
‘‘brand image’’ (4 items) was 0.84 and the value for ‘‘corporate
reputation’’ was 0.86, which are well above the acceptable
level. The value for ‘‘customer loyalty’’ was lower (0.63), but
still above the minimum level (Nunnally, 1967).

The measures and confirmatory factor analysis results are
provided in Table 2, which displays standardised factor
loadings and the t-values. Except for ‘‘the likelihood to
recommend’’ all the factor loadings are considerably greater
than the recommended minimum level of 0.50 (Hair, Anderson,
Tatham & Black, 2000). In addition the convergent validity for
the constructs is indicated by high factor loadings (Gerbing &
Anderson, 1988; Steenkamp & van Trijp, 1991). The good-
ness-of-fit statistics indicated that the scales were unidimen-
sional (Anderson et al., 1987).

The means and correlations amongst

the constructs are
reported in Table 3. As it was expected all the variables in the
core customer value and customer
loyalty process are
moderately or highly correlated. However of particular interest
is the association between brand image and corporate
reputation. The correlation coefficient of 0.62 indicates the
two constructs have a mediating effect between each other.

Equally important was to assess whether there was discrimi-
nant validity between these two constructs. Following Steen-
kamp and van Trijp (1991) and Anderson and Gerbing (1988),
we constrained the correlation between the two constructs to 1.
The difference in the chi-squared values for unconstrained
model (v2 = 168.5 and df = 20) and the constrained model
(v2 = 83.1, df = 19) was 84.6. This clearly exceeds the critical
value of 8.26 ( p = 0.01 level, df = 1), and so it can be concluded
that there is a strong evidence for discriminant validity.

5. Analysis and results

5.1. Model evaluation

Structural Equation Modelling using LISREL was used to evaluate
the model.3 The error variance corresponding to the single item
measures was set
to the minimum of 0.04 corresponding to the
smallest value found for another construct in this study. In order to
examine the model fit, sample size dependent rather than sample size
independent measures of goodness of fit were used (Bollen & Long,
1993). In this way, emphasis was placed on fit indices that were not
based on assumption of normality or sample size. The analysis
indicates a very good fit with the IFI = 0.99 and the CFI = 0.99, being
well above 0.9 threshold. The other goodness-of-fit statistics,
including the normed chi-squared = 1.77 (chi-squared 1454.98 divided
by 820 degrees of freedom), and RMSEA= 0.045 also indicate a very
good fit.

The variance extracted was used to assess the model reliability and
the analysis indicated that the latent constructs were explained well.
The construct of ‘‘perceived customer value’’ was predicted adequate-
ly by the three constructs ‘‘company reputation’’, ‘‘perceived product
and service quality’’ and ‘‘prices and costs’’ with the squared multiple
correlation of the measure of the variance extracted by predictors
equal to 0.71. The constructs ‘‘corporate reputation’’ and ‘‘perceived
customer value’’ also predicted ‘‘customer loyalty’’ adequately with
the squared multiple correlation of the measure of the variance
extracted by predictors equal to 0.71.

5.2. Results of hypothesis tests

Details about the parameter estimates for the model are provided in
Fig. 2 and results of the hypothesis tests are provided in Table 4. The
results provide support for the primary hypothesis that brand’s image
has a more specific influence on the customers’ perceptions of the
quality while the company’s reputation has a broader influence on the
customers’ perceptions of customer value and customer loyalty. While
the results did not provide sufficient evidence to support the secondary

hypotheses, the correlation of 0.62 between brand image and company
reputation suggests that there is a mediating influence between the two
variables and so there are indirect effects.

The results support the hypothesis (H1a) that brand image has a
positive impact on perceived quality but the impact of brand image is
not particularly strong (i.e. b = 0.10, p < 0.10). For
the other
hypotheses (H1b, H1c) that brand image had an impact on perceived
customer value and customer loyalty, while standard estimates were
positive (i.e. b’s = 0.02 and 0.04), they were not statistically significant
so H1b and H1c were not supported.

The hypothesis (H2b) that company reputation has a positive
influence on perceived customer value was strongly supported (i.e.
b = 0.22, p < 0.01) as was the hypothesis (H2c)
that company
reputation has a positive influence on customer loyalty (i.e. b = 0.58,
p < 0.01). However for the hypothesis (H2a) that company reputation
influences perceived quality, while standard estimate was positive, it
was small in magnitude (i.e. b = 0.10), was not statistically significant
so H2a was not supported.

The results also support the hypotheses about core service quality
customer value process. However, the impact of service quality on
perceived customer value was not as strong as the impact of prices and
costs (i.e. H3, with b = 0.10, p < 0.10 compared with H4, with b = 0.58,
p < 0.01). Finally, there was a strong support for the hypothesis of the
influence of perceived customer value on customer loyalty (H5,
b = 0.32, p < 0.01).

and company reputation in business markets.
It also
responded to the broader need for research that provides a
better understanding about how to create, measure, and
deliver customer value in business markets. We have shown
that the customer value and customer loyalty approach is a
useful way to quantify and distinguish between the influences
of the brand image and company reputation. By using this
approach, we were able to extend the previous research by
Mudambi (2002) and clearly distinguish between the different
influences of these two factors. The research confirmed that
the brand’s image has a more specific influence on the
customers’ perceptions of the quality while the company’s
reputation has a broader influence on perceptions of customer
value and customer loyalty.

This study extends the customer value research by Gale
(1994) and Rust et al. (1995) to include the influence of
branding. What is particularly valuable is that the framework
allows managers to distinguish between the different influ-
ences of brand image and company reputation. Thus the
framework can be used to explore the financial implications
and tradeoffs of investing in product and service quality,
brand image and company reputation versus price discount-
ing. However, the nature of these tradeoffs will differ from
market
to market, so the results from this study do not
automatically carryover to other markets. In this study both
prices and costs (i.e. b = 0.58) and company reputation (i.e.
b = 0.22) had strong influences on perceptions of perceived
customer value. Company reputation also had a direct
influence on customer
In contrast,
brand image did not have such a strong impact (i.e. b = 0.10)
but this does not necessarily mean the companies should not
invest in building brand image because the financial analysis
might show that at the margin the effect of brand image may
be important.

loyalty (i.e. b = 0.32).

6.2. Future research

While our research did not support the secondary hypoth-
eses we recognize that in other circumstance there may be
support for them. Our study was for an established market and
things may be different for markets with new products. For

example Brown and Dacin (1997) demonstrated that
the
knowledge consumers have about a company may influence
their beliefs about and attitudes toward new products manu-
factured by the company. Under these circumstances the
extrinsic cues, such as company’s name and reputation as well
as brand image, may have a stronger influence on perceptions
of quality. The conceptual discussions by Zeithaml (1988) and
Monroe (1990) provide a basis for
investigating other
circumstance where it
is more difficult for a consumer or
business customer to judge the quality based on objective
attributes.

We recognize that perceived product quality might also
drive brand image and that future research is needed to address
this issue. For example, research by Mittal (1999) about
business services examined how the determinants of value
perceptions and loyalty differ between first time purchases and
repeat purchases. Their research suggests the possibility that
the perceived product quality might drive brand image
perceptions once the product has been tried.

Further research is also needed to investigate the appro-
priateness of the conceptual model used in this study. One
particular area is the role of personal selling. For example,
does the salesperson act as a surrogate for company
reputation? If a personal
relationship grows between a
salesperson and a beauty salon manager this might account
for brand choices. In other circumstance buyer may collude
and dictate what brands are supplied.

Recent research by Eggert and Ulga (2002) presented results
that question whether perceived customer value is a substitute
for customer satisfaction in business market or whether
customer satisfaction has a mediating influence on purchase
intentions. This work serves as useful basis for extending our
research.

In this study we examined an established business market
where there are three manufacturers marketing their brands
directly to a large number of small firms. Further quantitative
research is needed to examine how the results generalise across
other business markets. The study was limited to only one
market and therefore the results should be interpreted
accordingly. It has been suggested that the drivers of perceived
customer value and loyalty play a differential role, depending


238

A.E. Cretu, R.J. Brodie / Industrial Marketing Management 36 (2007) 230 – 240

on the industry and the context of buying decision (Rust et al.,
2001). For example,
the product quality might be more
important for markets where there are clear tangible differences
between competing products, or where the decision involved in
the buying process is very complex. Another area for
refinement would be to examine whether there are distinctive
segments within a market. For example, Mudambi’s (2002)
study found only a third of the market were influenced by
branding and company reputation.

Further research is needed to determine the best way to
develop a scale to measure customer loyalty. While previous
research has shown that
the two-item scale had good
reliability this was not the case in this study. One explanation
for the low reliability in this study might be due to the
sensitive nature of asking about the likelihood to increase the
amount spent. Another explanation for the low reliability is
that
the indicators are formative and not reflective as has
been assumed in this study (Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer,
2001).

This study used the salon manager’s perceptions and did not
include the hairdressers who may also influence the buying
process. Hence further research could examine whether it
would be better to use multiple respondents.

Additional research is needed to develop a dynamic model.
For example attention needs to be given to the carryover
effects resulting from these alternative investments. Company
reputation is considered to be an ‘‘enduring belief’’ (Balmer,
2001; Bromley, 2001; Gray & Balmer, 1998), so the current
influence of company reputation will be a result of previous
investments.

Customer value creation is a dynamic process, so the
magnitude and importance of the drivers are likely to change
over time (Parasuraman, 1997). Although this study captures
the impact of brand image and corporate reputation in the
customer value – loyalty chain, this is a static view. Therefore
future research could use multiple time periods, in order to
examine the evolutionary process. In addition, research needs
to fully understand the processes that determine customers’
perceptions and knowledge of company reputation and brand
image.

The framework developed in this study could be applied to
other markets such as those in service industries where there is
a greater emphasis on the value obtained from the intangible
service attributes (Zins, 2001). Additional insights could also
be gained by investigating the new channels that are
developing in the virtual and computer mediated environments.
Finally, another area for research would be to explicitly
examine how company reputation lowers the level of risk
perceived by customers (Flint, Woodruff & Gardial, 2002;
Gu¨ rhan-Canli & Batra, 2004).

4 The questionnaire also included further questions about the sub-drivers for
‘‘perceived product and service quality’’ as well as ‘‘prices and costs’’. For
example perceived product and service quality sub-drivers included were:
‘‘training provided by supplier’’, ‘‘product quality’’, ‘‘marketing support’’,
‘‘business support’’, ‘‘customer service’’, ‘‘sales representative’’, and ‘‘special
recognition programmes’’. ‘‘Overall prices and costs’’ sub-drivers considered in
this survey were ‘‘prices’’, ‘‘rebates’’ and ‘‘other non-monetary costs’’. The
respondents were asked the questions about the sub-drivers before they were
asked for their overall ratings so they served as primers for the ‘‘overall’’
assessments.
