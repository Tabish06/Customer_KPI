Abstract 

papet  examines  disclosure  with  respect  to  gender  and  employment  in the  corporate  annual  reports 
of  major  British banking and  retaU companies  during the  period  1935-1993.  Setting the  disclosures  in the 
social,  political  and  economic  context  of  six  distinct  periods,  the  authors  suggest  that  the  position  of 
women  in  the  two  sectors  can  in  part  be  explained  by  cominuing  patdarchal  attitudes  of  management.

Although  there  is  a  history  of  equal  opportu- 
nities legislation in Britain, corporate  reporting 
with  regard  to  the  employment  of  women  is 
voluntary.  We  consider  corporate  social  dis- 
closure  and nondisclosure  in regard to  gender 
and employment over  a 59year  period.  Using a 
political  economy  perspective,  our study exam- 
ines  disclosure  and  nondisclosure  in  the  light 
of  the social, political  and economic  context  of 
the time. In this way  we  seek to obtain a better 
understanding  of  managerial  disclosure  policy 
and in particular the influence  of patriarchy. 

We  begin  by  discussing the  prior  literature 
on  corporate  social  disclosure  on  the  employ- 
ment  of  women  and then  outline  our  research 
method, before  considering  our fhuimgs. These 
have been  analysed according  to  periods  deter- 
mined by significant events regarding the status 
of  women  in British society.  In  presenting  our 
findings we  offer  an interpretation  of  women’s 

employment  patterns  and  corporate  reporting 
thereon, in light of the social, political  and eco- 
nomic  context  of  each period.  In our final con- 
cluding discussion we  consider the implications 
of  our findings for  efforts to improve  corporate 
accountability  on  social  issues  and  further 
research,  calling  for  a  more  critical  research 
approach  which  is  less  accepting  of  manage- 
ment  disclosure policy  and which  allows  both 
an identification  of  the  comprehensiveness  of 
reporting  and  a  better  understanding  of  the 
nature of reporting.

C.  A.  ADAMS  and  G.  HART@ 

Ciancanelli, et 

1990;  Kirkham & Loft, 
1993;  Loft, 1992)  there has been relatively little 
research published on  corporate  disclosure on 
the employment of women. Notable exceptions 
are the  works of Macintosh (1990)  and Tinker 
and Neimark (1987).  Macintosh offers a critical 
theory analysis of the  “construction  and recon- 
struction of an  ideology of an  inferior role  for 
women  in the  computer workplace”  using the 
annual reports and accounts of JBM (Macintosh, 
1990,  p.  153).  Using a group of twenty students 
as  judges, pictures  of  women  and  men  were 
classified as either performing creative-think@, 
technical-supervisory  or 
routine-repetitive 
tasks.  The  results  indicated  an  underlying 
ideology in the firm’s reports which portrays an 
inferior role for women. 

In  an  earlier  paper,  Tinker  and  Neimark 
(1987)  analysed the corporate annual reports of 
General  Motors  over  the  period  1917-1976. 
Drawing  on  a  political  economy  framework, 
which  emphasises the  use of annual reports to 
“mediate,  suppress,  mystify  and  transform 
social conflict” @.72),  the  authors suggest that 
the  nature of women’s exploitation alters with 
changes  in  the  crises  facing  capitalism, with 
capitalist alienation being a prime factor in the 
oppression of women. Using the annual reports 
and  accounts  of  General  Motors,  Tinker  and 
Neimark show how  these were  used as ideolo 
gical weapons  (p.72)  suggesting that  account- 
ing  has  a  greater  role  in  the  portrayal  of 
business  performance  than  simply  reporting 
“the  facts”  of  economic  reality.  Following  a 
political economy  approach,  which  recognises 
the  interplay between  class and other forms of 
domination, accounting is seen to contribute to 
the  maintenance of an ideology of oppression. 
Cooper  and  Puxty  (19%)  whilst  recognising 
the  important  contribution  of  Tinker  and 
Neimark’s work in presenting “a vigorous poli- 
tical  awareness that  working class solidarity is 
splintered  by  the  State’s  use  of  gender  and 
race” (Cooper & Puxty,  1996,  p.299)  argue that 
it focuses on the economic  in its analysis at the 
expense  of the  social. In examming the  social 
and political as well  as the  economic  context, 
we  build up a picture  of women’s experiences 

and so hope  to  avoid their criticisms of Tinker 
and Neimark’s study for tZli.ng to allow women 
“to  speak  for  themselves”  (Cooper  &  puxty, 
1996,  p.  299). 

Like  Cooper  and  Puxty  (1996)  Crompton 
(1987)  is also somewhat critical of the  analysis 
of  Tinker  &  Neimark,  arguing  that  it  over- 
emphasises  the  importance  of  class  as  the 
explanation  for  the  position  of  women,  and 
that it plays down the importance of patriarchy. 
Crompton  does  not  deny  the  benefits  of 
women’s exploitation to the capitalist class, but 
suggests that this may result from the organisa- 
tion of gender interests, speci&ally  male dom- 
ination. In her  view Tinker and Neimark offer 
insufficient justitication for their starting point 
of capitalist alienation, a matter of some impor- 
tance  particularly where  we  accept  that  capit- 
alism and patriarchy can be in conflict (Walby, 
1986).  Thus Crompton stresses the importance 
of recognising patriarchy in understanding the 
employment of  women.  Whilst  these  authors 
may disagme on the  relative importance of the 
infhtences of  capitalism and patriarchy on  the 
employment  patterns  of  women, 
they  all 
recognise  that ,both  have  contributed  to  the 
position of women  in  employment being sub 
ordinate to that of men. 

Using  a  similar  approach 

to  previous 
research, we have conducted a content  analysis 
of  amlual  report  disclosures,  analysing  our 
results by  specific periods,  drawing on  social, 
political  and  economic  developments  of  the 
time. Our focus is on  the  corporate  disclosure 
of a small sample of British clearing banks and 
(non-food)  retail  companies  over  the  period 
1935-1993.  Thus  we  present  a  longitudinal 
account  of the  extent  and nature of corporate 
disclosure, and examine these findings in light 
of the social, political and economic  context  of 
the  time in which  they were  written.  We  also 
emphasise what  accounting  reports  fail to  tell 
us,  based  on  a  view  that  what  firms disclose 
relies  not  only  on  institutional requirements, 
but  also political interests. Accounting can  be 
seen as a language which  can  be used to  legit- 
imate corporate  action,  where  what  is not  dis- 
closed can be seen as important as that which .is

(see  Hammond &  Oakes,  1992).  In  analysing 
disclosures and nondisclosures in this way, we 
are able to illustrate how they support a history 
of  the  nature  of women’s  employment which 
recognises  the  inthrences  of  both  capitalism 
and  patriarchy.  In  doing so  we  pay  particular 
attention to patriarchal influences. 

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The  choice  of  the  period  covered  in  our 
study was  influenced by  a  number of  factors, 
including our desire to go back to a time before 
the  introduction  of  sex  discrimination legisla- 
tion. In addition it was appropriate to begin the 
study a few years before the second world war, 
because of the change in women’s employment 
during that  period  (e.g.  Cabinet Oflice,  1987). 
Our period begins towards the end of what has 
been  described  as  the  “age  of  catastrophe,“1 
extending  through  to  the  “golden  age”,2  and 
ending in  the  present  era  of  “decomposition, 
uncertainty and cri~is”~ (Hobsbawm, 1994).  It 
begins  before  the  second  world  war,  when 
more  women  entered  the  labour  force,  and 
extends  to  cover  the  post  war boom  and pros- 
perity,  the  social developments leading to  leg- 
islative change  in the  1960s  and  197Os, before 
concluding with the  recent  era of “new  right” 
reforms in Britain4 

Selection of the sectors and sampleprms 

Our  research  focuses  on  two  separate  and 
unconnected  sectors  of  the  economy.  Nowa- 
days British women tend to be employed in the 

welfare  services  and  the  caring  professions, 
banking and insurance, hotels and cater@  and 
in  retail  distribution  (e.g.  PiUrger,  1992). 
Following  discussion with  researchers  at  the 
Equal Opportunities Commission (EOQ5  and 
review  of  recent  empirical  research  studies 
which focused on specific sectors of the British 
economy,  or  used particular case  studies (e.g. 
Collinson, et  aZ., 1990;  Dickens  et  aZ., 1988; 
Jewson  et al.,  1992),  we  selected banking and 
retail as  our  focus,  particularly as  clerical  and 
retail employment have emerged as important 
sources  of women’s  employment this century, 
replacing domestic service and jobs in the  tex- 
tile industry (Hex,  1985).  In order  to  create  a 
research  sample  of  manageable  proportions, 
given  the  time  period  covered,  we  narrowed 
this  down  to  the  higher  profile,  and  higher 
employment, high street clearing banks and the 
multiple (non-food) retail sector. In the absence 
of  adequate  data  on  employment, fhms were 
selected on the basis of current financial size, as 
measured by stock market value, with the  sam- 
ple  selected  accounting  for more  than  70% at 
the  time  of  selection  (it  was  not  possible  to 
trace this percentage back in time due to  chan- 
ges  in  the  classification of  tirms in  the  stock 
market). The focus on two sectors, while biased 
to  those  where  women  are  employed in  rela- 
tively  large  number  nowadays,  offers  us  the 
opportunity to  contrast  women’s  experiences 
in different parts of the economy (see Milkman 
1987)  and,  as  can  be  seen  from our  analysis: 
where  women’s  experiences  have  d&red.  It 
does, however,  limit the  generalisability of our 
lindings.

The focus on the corporate annual report 

Following Adams et aZ. (l!Wa),  this paper 
focuses on the disclosure of equal opportunities 
information  in  the  corporate  anmral  report. 
Adams et al. took  the  view  that  the  corporate 
annual report can be influential in shaping what 
is important in  society  (Burchell et al,  1980), 
and is an opportunity for management to report 
on what, and in a manner, it .sees as appropriate 
(Neimark, 1992).  Our study is premised on the 
view  that  employment,  and  the  position  of 
women  are  important  social  matters,  which 
firms affect,  and  where  managers can  choose 
whether and/or how to report on performance.

Althougb Crompton (1987)  suggests that too 
much emphasis can be placed on the potential for 
corporate  annual reports  to  construct  a  world 
view, our acceptance of the social importance of 
the corporate annual report stresses its potential 
(rather  than  fact)  to  be  intluential. corporate 
annual reports  can  therefore be  of  interest  as 
much for what  they do  not report, as for their 
actual content. This focus on the corpomte annual 
report  is  also  consistent  with  previous  social 
disclosure studies, since  the  corporate  annual 
report  is  the  main form of  corporate  commu- 
nication and, particularly in the  case of quoted 
companies,  is  made  widely available (see,  for 
example, Guthrie & Parker, 1989a;  Gray et al., 
1995;  Adams et al., 1998).  Thus our study goes

The  data  for  our  study  was  collected  by

the  extent 
social 
reporting  (see  for example,  Adams et al.,  19956;

1982;  Guthrie  &  Mathews, 
Guthrie, 
1985; 
Guthrie  &  Parker,  1990).  The  research 
instru- 
ment  used  was  based  on  a model  developed  by 
Adams  et  al.  (1995b),  and  is  a  development  of 
the  form  used  in Adams et aL. (19954.  Although 
companies  in  Britain  are  legally  responsible  for 
ensuring  equality  of  opportunities 
(for  some 
“minority”  groups,  such  as  women,  ethnic 
minorities  and,  most  recently,  disabled  people) 
they  are  not  required  to  be publicly  accountable 
for  their  equal  opportunities  policies,  activities 
or  outcomes

in  respect  of  policy  towards  disabled  employ- 
ees:  Companies  Act  1985,  Sch.  7  para.  9)  (see 
Gray  et  al.,  19%).  We  therefore  are  concerned 
entirely  with  voluntary  corporate  disclosure.

PERIODISATION  OF  THE  FINDINGS 

order  to  analyse  the  findings,  and  to  offer 
some  explanation  for  the  (non)  disclosure,  the 

period  1935-1993  has  been  subdivided,  or  per- 
iod&d.  This  approach  (see  Hoogvelt  % Tinker, 
1978;  Tinker  &  Neimark,  1987),  enables  us  to 
consider  disclosure 
in  relation  to  the  social, 
political  and  economic  situation  of each  period. 
Periodisation  does  not  seek  to  offex  specific  or 
discrete  time  periods,  but  rather  is  an  effort  to 
consider  our  findings  in  relation  to  social,  poli- 
tical  and economic  developments.  For  example, 
in  the  Hoogvelt  and  Tinker  study,  the  period- 
isation  was  determined  mainly  by  the  dates  of 
successive  mining  agreements  between  Delco, 
the  Scottish  transnational  corporation,  and  the 
Sierra  Leone  Development  Corporation,  since 
these  agreements 
in  the 
social  relations  of  production.  Periodisation 
allows  us to  recognise  the  regular  resurfacing  of 
economic  and  social  crisis  which  come  from 
social  conflicts  and  recurrent  problems  of 
legitimacy  (Puxty,  1997).  Changes  in  the  eco- 
nomic  and  social  situation  in  capitalist  society 
are  never  fully  settled,  but  rather  follow  from 
political  awareness  and  action  (Puxty,  1997), 
leading  to  temporary  agreements  and  coalitions 
and  changes  in  the  balance  of  power  between 
interests 
(Lehman,  1992).  Such  periodisation 
can  be  based  on  a  materialist  analysis  focusing 
on  economic 
ideo 
logical  developments  (see  Lehman  (1992),  who 
draws  on  Hall  (1988u,&)).  Our  periodisation 
differs  from 
that  of  Tinker  and  Neimark,

which suppled reports back to the 195Os), we would aImoat certaInIy not have been successfuI in obtaining aU external

were  being  done  accurately.  A  detailed  coding  sheet,  giving  instructions  and  examples,  was  provided,  and  a  sample  of  all

1945  and 1945-1950). 

1935-1945 

The  recent  history of women’s  employment 
linked to  a  variety of  social 
in 
legislation  and 
including 
developments, 
women’s participation in the workforce during 
the 8rst  world war (The  Cabinet Office, 1987). 
In  the  period  before  the  second  world  war, 

and G. HART@ 

most  women  in  Britain left  the  labour  force 
permanently  on  getting  married  or  with  the 
birth of their first child (Crompton & Sanderson, 
1986).  Our period  begins at  a  time  of  severe 
economic  depression  in  Britain  and  most 
developed  economies.  Rising  unemployment 
was  followed  by  a  further  downturn  in  the 
economy (Alford, 19%),  before the declaration 
of  war  in  1939,  and  the  consequent  central 
management of the economy. 

There  is  little evidence,  at  this  time,  of  the 
State  actively  encouraging  women’s  employ- 
ment,  except  when  there  was  a  crisis in  the 
labour  market,  such  as  the  war  threw  up, 
and there  was  resistance to  any legal commit- 
ment  to  equality of  opportunity  for  women. 
For  example,  in  1944,  at the  same time as the 
Civil  Service  women’s  organisations  formed 
an  Rqual Pay  Campaigning Committee  (Cock- 
burn,  1991),  the  House of  Commons, on  the 
initiative of  the  Co nservative  Reform  Group, 
voted  narrowly  to  give  equal  pay  to  women 
school  teachers.  However  the  Prime Minister, 
Winston Churchill, insisted on this amendment 
being  removed  (Thane,  1991).  This proposed 
reform arose at  a  time when  women  working 
in  engineering  factories  went  on  strike  for 
equal  pay,  with  the  support  of  a  number  of 
(largely male)  craft  unions. However,  support 
was  less  for  altruistic  reasons  than  fear  of 
losing their jobs to  women who  would accept 
lower  rates,  providing  an  example  of  men 
abandoning patriarchal values when under eco 
nomic  threat.  Subsequently a  Royal Commis- 
sion on  equal pay was set  up,  which  reported 
in 1946. 

  While  the  proportion  of  women  clerical 
workers  in 
increased from 2  to  20  per 
cent of the total in the period 1850  to  1911,  the 
total  number  of  clerks  increased  nine  times 
from 95,000  to  843,000  (Zimmeck, 1986).  Loft 
(1992)  in  commenting  on  Lowe  (1987)  high- 
lights the political nature of attitudes to women 
workers:

employ  them  at  all,  and  then  when  they  began  to

on  Lowe,  1987). 

their  employment 

Yet  despite the fact that employment figures 
indicate that  their jobs were  not  under threat, 
male clerks opposed the entry of women on the 
grounds that  they  believed it  would  take  jobs 
away  from  men,  lower  the  wage  rate  for  all 
clerks  and  because  it  would  undermine, pat& 
archy (see Lewis, 1984; Walby, 19E46).9 Zimmeck 
(19%)  notes  that  the  threat  to  their  manhood 
posed  by  the  lack  of  an  obvious  distinction 
between  feminine  and  mascuhne  roles  was 
dealt with by forcing one between  the intellec- 
tual (which  was the  province  of men)  and the 
mechanical 
the  province  of 
women).  To  aid  the  development  of  this  dis- 
tinction  the  myth  grew  that  women  did  not 
want  responsibility and  that  in  any  case  they 
were unable to take the stmin, but were, on the 
other  hand, very good  at  withstanding monot- 
ony  and  meticulous  with  detail.  Men  were 

(which  was 

thought,  at  least  by  those  men  in  control  in 
patriarchal Victorian society,  to  be  more  intel- 
lectual,  to  have  a  broader  intelligence, to  be 
better  at  and better  able to  cope  with  making 
decisions  and  to  be  able  to  exercise  more 
initiative (Zimmeck, 19%). 

It  was  not  until  1907  that  the  first woman 
was appointed to the Midland Bank to translate 
French and German newspapers for the bank’s 
senior  management  (Midland  Bank  Group 
Archives,  1991).  Further  women 
recruits 
shortly  after  that  were  primarily  shorthand 
typists forbidden to  mix  with  the  men.  Their 
numbers had  risen to  350  by  1915  when  The 
Banker’s Magazine commented: 

WhetherladieswiUeverbeconside&forthehigher 
posts  is, for the time being, a question too  revoltionafy 
for  consideration. 
quoted  in  Midland Bank  Group 
Archives  (1991  p.  2). 

Other  banks  also  employed  women  from 
around that time. The Westminster reported in 
its  1%5  corporate  annuaI report  that  the  first 
women, four “lady typewriters”, were appointed 
by  the  London and County Bank in  1907  and 

9As early  as  1920,  Drake  noted  that;  ‘Men trade  unionists  are  accused  of  a policy  of  sex  privilege  and  prejudice..

PORTRAYAL  OF  WOMEN’S  EMPLOYMENT  IN  CORPORATE  ANNUAL REPORTS 

789 

Lloyds  (1962 
corporate  annuaI  report)  noted 
their  “Regulations  for  Women  Clerks’  dated 
1910”. 

Checkland  (1975) 

suggests  that  the  Scottish 
Bankers’  Association  were  faced  with  consider- 
able diIIiculties recrultlng  to replace  men fighting 
in the  first world  war,  since  the  older  men  who 
might be recruited  were  “averse  to  creating  trou- 
ble”  @.  5%)  and  so  the  recruitment  of women 
was  a priority.  Men returning  from the  war  to the 
Bank of Scotland discovered  that women  who  had 
joined  the  Bank  were  not  all leaving,  creating  a 
downward  pressure  on  wages 
leading  to  an 
attempted  strike ln 1920  (Saville, 1996). 

Despite  the  growth  in the  number  of clearing 
banks  during  the  early  decades  of  this  century, 
and  the  growth 
in  employment  of  women, 
women  were  not  recruited  for  a  career,  rather 
being  seen  as  a  second  tier  of  the  workforce 
intended  to  subsidlse  the  promotion  opportu- 
nities  for  male  clerks  (Savage,  1993).  It  was  not 
until  1935,  that  Lloyds  inaugurated  a  new  Pen- 
sion  Fund  for  women  clerks  “in  addition,  of 
course,  to  the  long  established  pension  scheme 
for men”  (Lloyds,  1935  corporate  annual report). 
the  myths 
regarding  what  women  were  capable  of,  or 
willing to  do,  were  largely  disproved  when  they 
were  called  upon  to  fill  the  gaps  left  by  men 
joining  the  Forces.  The  normally  stitf  entry 
requkments 
for  women  were  relaxed  during 
the  war  (Snell,  1997).  i” Barclays  noted: 

the  second  world  war,

adapted  themselves  readily  to  working  conditions  in 
the  Bank (Barclays,  1940  corporate  annual  report). 

and  their  contribution  can  be  clearly  seen  by 
the  statement:

of  men  and  women  employed  is  smaller  than  before

Despite  the  extensive  change  in  the  compo- 
ln  this  period,  we  dis- 

sition  of  the  workforce 
covered 
the  corporate 
annual  reports  of the  banks.  Overall,  as Table  2 
indicates,  disclosure  in  the  eleven  year  period, 
1935-1945,  was  extremely  limited.  In the  years 
before  the  war  we  saw  only  one  bank  refer  to 
gender  and  employment 
in  one  of  the  four 
years  (Lloyds,  1935  corporate  annual  report, 
see  above),  although  disclosure  increased  in the 
war  years,  with  five  banks  dlscloslng  in  seven 
years.  Although  some  reference  was  made  to 
the  efficiency  of  the  fewer  employees,  includ- 
(see  Barclays, 
ing  large  numbers  of  women, 
in  the 
1941  corporate  annual  report  above),

their  replacement  of men.

the  declaration  of  war  in  1939 

Durlng  the  1930s  the  retail  sector  was  show- 
ing  signs  of  stagnation,  being  affected  by  eco- 
nomic  decline  and  reduced  personal  incomes. 
Although  the  level  of  hire  purchase  credit  had 
(Benson, 
multiplied 
1994) 
led  to 
restrictions  on  the  development  of  the  sector 
due  to  rationing  and  central  control  of essential 
commodities 
(Channon,  1978).  Jefferys  (1954) 
involved 
suggests  that  more  women  became 
in  the  sector  as  the 
in  packaged 
goods  and  mechanical  aids  in  shops  led  to  a 
“desldlling”  of  the  workforce.  However,  retail- 
ing  has  a  long  history  of  job-gendering,  wlth 
men  dominating  in  management  and  particu- 
larly  likely  to  be  associated  with  selling  prod- 
ucts  and  services  which  require  “expertise”. 

increase 

As  with  the  banks,  disclosure  by  retail  com- 
panies  was  limited.  Prior  to  1940  we  did  not 

%‘omen  were  also recruited  for  the  newly  formed  central  cleaning house,  which  was  set  up  in  1940,  although  the  naming 
of their  newsletter,  l&  Outcast,  suggests  little integration  with  male  employees  (Snell,  1997).

find any disclosure, and in the five years 1941- 
1945  we  noted  only seven,  despite  the  much 
longer tradition of female employment in retail- 
ing.  Figures  from  the 

show that as early as  1935  the propor- 
tion  of  women  involved in  distributive trades 
(which  includes  retail)  in  Great  Britain  and 
Northern Ireland was 39% (increasing to 47% in 
1950  and  52%  in  1960).  Evidence  from  our 
review  of  the  corporate  annual  reports  con- 
firms  that  women  were  employed  in  large 
numbers before  1939,  but  not  in  positions of 
responsibility. For  example  Woolworths  noted 
that: 

AveryIaqepropottionofourtminedmenarenow 
with the Services, and we depend more and more on 
women to  take over responsibUtks of management 
and other duties, and they have done, and will I am 
sure continue to do, a wondexfid job of work. It will 
iaterestyoutokuowthatthemenremai&ginour 
employ  represent  only  3  per  cent.  of  our  total 
employees  today. 
(Woolwotths,  1940  corporate 
am=lyort). 

As  this  quote illusttates the position changed 
to  some  extent  with  the  war.  British  Home 
Stores (1941  corporate  annual report)  indicates 
that “women and girls” were employed in large 
numbers before the  war  and their  1943  report 
indicates that they relied on older women, per- 
haps those who  had worked with them before 
having a family, to make up the shortfall during 
the  war,  although  not  necessarily in  manage- 
ment tasks 

We  have muumlly had  to  depend more  and  more 
upon the  elkts  of our women and gitis, who have 
responded magnificentty to  the  increased responsi- 
bilities which  they  have  had  to  shoukter. (British 
Home Stores, 1941 corpora@ aunual report). 

Again, the running of our business would have been 
well nigh imposstile without the  good work  of  so 
many of the  older women, includiog those engaged 
on  a  part&e  basis...  (British Home  Stores,  1943 
corpora& annual report). 

And, although Marks and Spencer had a pre 
war staff of 20,000,  only 1,500  men had joined 
the Forces by 1943,  again pointing to the likely 
large numbers of women in the workforce: 

coqention  with  the  M&try  of  Labour and 
Minktry of SuppIy, we have been able to divert large 
numbers of  our  women  staE  into  Royal Ordnance 
lkctorles.. . . Our girls (sfc) are able to work together

Over 1,500 of our men have joined H.M. Forces.. 

prpwv SWT of 2o,ooo,  only 3,000  atr  still with 
us. . .  Our  present  M-time  labour force  numbers 
some  9,500  (Marks and  Spencer,  1%3  corpomte 
annual report). 

There  seems  little  doubt  that  the  primary 
motivation for disclosure on  women’s  employ- 
ment in both sectors in this period was the role 
they performed during the war. Management in 
both sectors has illustrated the  sacrifice for the 
war effort and firms’ adaptability. Although this 
indicated opportunities for women, the pattern 
was different in the  two  sectors. In the  case of 
retailing women were  already quite well estab 
lished, in numbers if not  in authority, whilst in 
banking  women  were  hardly  represented 
before  the  war,  and  their  introduction is  por- 
trayed  as  temporary,  despite  the  potential 
financial advantages of  exploiting  women  fur- 
ther  in  both  sectors.  The  disclosures  made 
highhght that  management was clearly impres- 
sed by the abilities of women to work at all, in 
the  case  of the  banking sector,  and to  work in 
positions  of  responsibility, in  the  case  of  the 
retail sector. However, the patriarchal society at 
the  time was not  ready for such radical moves 
as increasing the number of women in banking 
or putting women in positions of responsibility 
in  the  retail sector.  Perhaps management was 
concerned 
introduction  of  more 
women,  particularly  in  banking,  could  have

to  40%  in  1951 

Following  the  second  world  war,  the  L&our 
government  introduced  a radical  programme  of 
nationalisation  and  social  welfare  legislation,  in 
an  attempt  to  rebuild  British  society.  The  State 
was  apparently  keen  to  keep  some  women  in 
paid  employment  after  the  war  due  to  iabour 
shortages  (Thane,  1992).  In the  decade  after  the 
war  more  women  remained 
in  paid  employ- 
ment  until  they  had  their  first child  (though  not 
in  banking  where  women  were  forced  to  leave 
on  marriage),  with  many  retuming  after  time 
taken  off  to  have  a  family,  despite  the  fact  that 
(male)  incomes  were  sufficiently  high  to  enable 
a family to  live off a single income  (Lewis,  1984; 
Thane,  1992).  The  proportion  of women  work- 
ing  who  were  married  increased,  from  16%  in 
1931 
(source  Hakim,  1979, 
reported 
in  Lewis,  1984)  due,  in  part,  to  an 
increase  in the  number  of households  with  gas, 
(Lewis, 
electricity  and  labour  saving  devices 
1984).  However  many  of 
returning 
women  worked  part-time  and  outwith  the  pri- 
mary  labour  market  (other  than  in  the  social 
welfare  and  related  professions)  (Thane,  1992, 
drawing  on  Myrdal  &  Rlein,  1970) 
and  there 
was  also  evidence  of  male  employers’  opposi- 
tion  to  any  flexibility  to  meet 
the  needs  of 
women 
there 
appears  to  have  been  growing  women’s  acti- 
vism  in  the  workplace, 
in  trade  unions  and  in 
the  Labour  Party  during  this  period  (Cockbum, 
1991) 
the 
Trades  Union  Congress  (TUC)  was  more  con- 
cerned  with  protecting  male  salaries  (Walby, 
1986).

(I’hane,  1994).  In  addition  the  British  Employ- 
ers  Confederation  outlined  a  case  for  gender 
divisions  of  labour,  based  on  efficiency,  flex- 
ibility,  ambition, 
time  off,  physical  strength, 
tolerance  of  monotonous  work  and  commit- 
ment 
(I‘hane,  1991).  The  trade 
unions,  on  the  other  hand,  were  opposed  to 
government 
interference,  preferring  progress 
to  equal  pay  by  collective  bargaining.  Despite 
this  opposition  to  equal  pay,  together  with  the 
Whitley  Council  Report  on  Marriage  Bars, 
which  was  published  in  the  same  year,  these 
events  can  be seen as an early development  in the 
process  of institutional change,  although  in pnic- 
tice  iittle changed  until the  1950s  (Crompton  & 
Sanderson,  1990). 

Banking 

After  the  war  banking  continued 

to  be  a 
highly  concentrated  and  centmlised  sector,  clo- 
sely  regulated  by  the  State,  but  offering  steady 
growth  and  profitability  in  the  absence  of  com- 
petition.  As  a  consequence 
of  this  stability, 
employers  were  able  to  offer  more  or  less  life 
time  employment  (for  men),  structured  careers, 
industrial  relations  and  paternalistic, 
orderly 
welfare-oriented  personnel  policies 
(Storey, 
1995).  Nevertheless,  recruitment 
in  banking  in 
the late  1940s  and  1950s  was  “gendered”,  where 
women  were 
jobs, 
while  men  expected  a  career  (see  Crompton, 
1989).  The  proportion  of  female  employment 
in  the  banks  grew  due  to  increasing  mechan- 
isation  of 
1975) 
although  a  Midland  Bank  committee  on  statf 
recruitment  recommended 
that  women’s  entry 
to  the  permanent  staff should  be  largely  restric- 
ted  to  the  London  area,  involve  a  six  months 
probationary  period,  a  “reasonable”  education 
standard,  be  restricted 
to  unmarried  women 
and  (normally)  those  between  16  and  30  years 
of age  (Midland Bank  Group  Archives,  1991).

as  well  as a  commitment  to  the  retram@  of 
returning  men  for  positions  of  responsibility 
which  had  been  held  by  women  in  their 
absence: 

Our chiti concern in the  process  of  te-absorption 
from the Forces has been to  provide n3uming men 
with the  concenttated train@  or  re-tmining neces- 
suy,to  fit them, after an absence in many cases of six 
years or more, for the work in the Bank, and further, 
to give them proper opportunities for the exercise of 
personal  qualities developed  during  war  service 
(Midland, 1946 corporate annual report). 

Typically  through 

this  post-war  period, 
women  and men  recruits went  through differ- 
ent induction periods and men were  either not 
recruited for machine (electric adding machines) 
work at all (as in the National Rrovincial Bank) or, 
they  passed  through  the  machine  room  very 
quickly (as  in the  Westminster Bank) (Cromp- 
ton,  1989).  And as the  expressions of gratitude 
above have illustrated the involvement of these 
women  was  “temporary”,  and  does  not  seem 
to  have stretched  to  managerial functions. The 
regret  expressed  by  the  Bank  of  Scotland  at 
women’s  departure has to  be  seen in the  con- 
text  of the  absence  of any concern  expressed 
about  the  restrictive  recruitment  policies  and 
different training periods. Again, the  banks are 
seen  to  quietly acquiesce  to  such  patriarchal 
influences, neither highRghting the  injustice to 
women  nor  the  potential gains from recruiting 
more from this cheap labour source. 

Retail 

The  retail  sector  continued  to  face  restric- 
tions after the war.  Rationing which  continued 
into  the  mid  1950s  and  legal  restrictions  on 
building were  major  constraints.  Thus,  as  in 

Retail disclosures also  amounted  to  four  in 
six years. The efforts of the women in their roles 
of  increased  responsibility during  the  men’s 
absence were acknowledged, albeit in a patron- 
ising manner, and one which indicated that men 
were being restored to their nUnageM positions: 

tihmrily.

They  haVe  now  assumed 
StOfeSVqsl 
akemative positions of  responsibility thus  allowing 
the rexum&j Service men to take over their mauage- 
rial positions again (British Home Stores, 1947 cop 
rate annual report). 

The  following year’s  BHS claim of  opportu- 
nities for promotion for both  female and maIe 
trainees, refers to  ability and merit, yet  it  was 
not  until  196s  that  a  woman  reached  senior 
management in this firm (BHS 1968  corporate 
annual report). 

Although such  disclosure again confirms the 
temporary  nature  of  women’s  involvement it 
also  raises  the  question  of  whether  women 
were  given greater responsibility in contrast to 
banking. Indications are that it was much more 
common  for women  to  be  employed in retail- 
ing  before  the  war,  and  so  their  temporary 
replacement of men during the  war was much 
more likely to be at managerial levels, than was 
the case in the banks. However as the BHS 1947 
corporate annual report indicates they were now 
taking “alternative” positions of responsibility. 

Generally, corporate  annual reports  around 
this  time  indicate  that  the  companies  them- 
selves,  whilst  congratulating women  on  their 
war efforts, appear to  have made little effort to 
retain  them,  and  in  fact  removed  them  from 
positions  of  responsibility. This  despite  the 
apparent financial benefits available from their 
employment as a cheaper source of labour, and 
the  apparent  absence  of  strong  (male)  trade 
unions in either sector which might have been 
expected  to object to such practices. Given the 
limited opportunities  for  competition  in  both

PORTRAYAL. OF WOMEN’S

the 

sectors,  this failure to  improve profitability by 
recruiting more women  at lower wages points 
to the influence of patriarchy. To a great extent 
women became invisible once  more, with little 
reporting  of  the  quantity  or  quality  of  their 
contribution  to 
labour  force.  Equally, 
though  not  surprisingly  given  accounting’s 
general disregard for “externalities”, we  see no 
reporting of the consequences for women who 
were  paid-off after the  war.  A corporate  thank 
you  from a  male management seems likely to 
have  been  inadequate  compensation,  particu- 
larly for those  who  lost wage  earning partners 
in the war. 

1950-  1964 

low 

The  Conservative  government  from  1951 
pursued  policies  similar to  those  of  the  pre- 
vious  Labour  government  (Gamble,  1994; 
Pearce  & Stewart,  1992).  This was  a period of 
continued  growth, 
inflation  and  full 
employment,  though  of  relative  economic 
decline  in  Britain  (Alford,  19%).  However, 
growing  prosperity  was  not  matched  by  sig- 
niticant social policy  developments. The  post- 
war  politics  of  “fair shares”  and  security was 
replaced  with  a  growing  prosperity,  growing 
migration within the  country,  and greater per- 
sonal  consumption  on  televisions and  motor 
cars  (Bartlett,  1977).  Iabour  shortages encour- 
aged more women to  enter the labour force, as 
the  extmcts  from the  corporate  reports  of the 
period indicate, in part assisted by the develop 
ment of equipment for use in the home and the 
desire  to  increase  incomes.  Throughout  the 
193)s  and 196Os, men were generally recruited 
to  careers  and women  to  jobs which  they  left 
on  marriage  or  certainly  prior  to  childbirth 
(Crompton,  1989).  Women managers remained 
a  novelty,  although  the  Conservative govern- 
ment  introduced equal pay in the  civiI service, 
in  1955.  In contrast  the trade unions appear to 
have  retained  a  preference  to  handle  matters 
through  collective  bargaining, and  it  was  not 
until  1%7  that  the  TUC  made  a  formal com- 
mitment to  equal pay, as part of its strategy for 

women  (Cockburn,  1991).  What was emerging 
was  a  pattern  of women’s  employment which 
wastoremainwithustotheE@Os(Thane, 
1991),  whereby women  were  retuming to  the 
workforce  after  having  had  a  family,  yet 
remaining severely dimdvantaged as a result of 
years  away  from  work  and  previous  recruit- 
ment to jobs rather than careers. 

Banking 

By the  late  1950s  women  comprised 40% of 

the  jobs  in  the  London  clearing banks @an, 
1982).  More women  and young  male  appren- 
tices were  being recruited to  replace male tell- 
ers,  as the  banks failed to  compete  with  other 
professions in recruiting men in a  time of fast 
expansion  of  employment  (Munn,  1988). 
Women  were  also being recruited  as machine 
operators. 

In its 1960  corporate  annual report, the  Mid- 
land reported that for several years up to  1957, 
the number of people it employed was rising at 
an annual average rate of 2% with an accelera- 
tion  thereafter  to  an  increase  of  10%  in  the 
previous year. The additional losses expected  to 
arise from the use of poorer quality staff appar- 
ently  did  not  material&z, as  the  women  and 
young  male  apprentices  were  as  efficient  as 
their  older  male  counterparts.  Yet  it  appears 
that,  except  for the  lirst few years  of  service, 
women  were  paid  less  than  men,  few  were 
promoted, and although they could do the pro 
fessional e xaminations,  this  was  not  actually 
encouraged by the banks (Munn, 1988)  further 
limiting women’s  promotion  prospects.  What 
appears  to  have  been  a  policy  of  alternative 
recruitment  forced  on  banks  following  their 
failure to  compete  for  male  staff, resulted  in 
financial  benefits,  and  may  have  been  the 
encouragement  that  was  needed  to  expand 
female  recruitment,  as  technological  changes 
led to  an increase in the  level of employment 
(Crompton  &  Sanderson, 1994).  Similarly this 
may also go  some way to  explaining the  drop 
ping  of  the  marriage bar  in  the  sector  in  the 
mid-1950s.

of  women  to  jobs  and 
men  to  careers  (Crompton,  1989).  This  is 
reflected  in  disclosures such  as  National Pn+ 
vindal’s  1954  corporate  annual report,  Uoyds’ 
1954  and  1955  corporate  annual reports  and 
even  as  late  as  Iloyds’  1%2  corporate  annual 
report.  The  1954  corporate  annual  report  of 
National  Provincial  provides  an  early  indica- 
tion  of  the  likely  change  in  balance  of  the 
workforce,  yet  a  clear  commitment  to  men, 
who  were  being  groomed  for  managerial 
positions: 

It stalls 

1955  Iloyds  indicated  that  “several” 
women  had  moved  into  managerial or  super- 
visory work,  although it  is  unlikely that  their 
wages  and  conditions  were  the  same  as  for 
men.  In  fact  the  suggestion  is  that  greater 
employment of women creates better opportu- 
nities for those men employed by the  bank, to 
fill managerial positions: 

At 

concerns  with the  managerial oppor- 
tunities for men is seen in Lloyds 1954 corporate 
annual  report,  where  it  is  implied  that  very 
kw  women  choose  to  stay  in  banking  as  a 

1%2  the numbers of women employed by 
Iloyds  amounted  to  almost  12,000,  approxi- 
mately 50% of the total figure, although almost 
half of these were under the age of 19.

PORTRAYAL  OF WOMEN’S 

CORPORATE 

REPORTS 

7% 

outbankwasoneoftheiirsttoemploywomenand 
inourrecordsisapaperheaded”Reg&ionsfor 
Women  Uerks”  dated  1910.  Today  women  have 
inaeasing  oppommities 
for  promotion  and  a  large 
numbcT  occupy  positions  of  conaidemble  responsi- 
blhty.  Although  it  is  not  necessary  fw  a  woman  to 
leave  the  bar&k  servke  on  maniage,  the  majority  do. 
It is noteworthy  that  over  five thousand  of the  women 
staEareundernineteenyearsofageandthatonly 
three  thousand  five  hundred  are  over  twenty-live 
years  of age.  The  work  of those  women  who  make the 
banktheir  careerismostvaluableandIhopetosee 
more  of  them  move  into  senior  positions  (Uoyds, 
I%2  corporate  annual  report). 

The proportion of women employed in other 
banks was  also increasing. The  Midland (l%O 
corporate  annual  report)  noted  that  women 
accounted for two  out of every five employees, 
the Westminster  (1%4  corporate annual report) 
that  in  the  younger  age  groups  women  out- 
numbered men, and in 1%5  Lloyds (1965  corpo- 
rate annual report) reported that the total 
the  bank was  13,299  men and  13,448  women. 
Women  were  now  in the  majority, but the nature 
of their work had been clearly distinguished from 
men’s.  The  disclosures clearly show  that  they 
were employed in increasing numbers to do the 
routine work  which  had  increased due  to  the 
expansion  of  ledger-keeping activities and  the 
advent  of  electronic  bookkeeping.  The  di* 
closures also suggest that the banks did little or 
nothing  to  encourage  career  development for 
women, even appearing to suggest that this was 
due  largely  to  female  choice  (for  example  see 
Midland  1964  corporate  annual  report  below). 
There  also  appears  to  have  been  little change  in 
the  commitment  to  develop  male  careers  as this 
disclosure  ilhlstmtes: 

the  tmining  of  young  men,  but  also  on  their 
career  development: 

In order to improve the syz3tcm of  tmining,  incentive 
and selection  for  promotion  we  have,  in the  past year, 
establisheda”specialgt&?intowhichyoungmenof 
proved  and  exceptional  promise  may  be  placed  for 
purposes  of  intensive  experience  and  instruction 
(Midland,  1958  corporate  annual report). 

Later there appeared to be some, though not 
equal concern  with the  position  of  women.  In 
1960  the  Midland introduced  a  separate  ‘Trofi- 
ciency  Grade”  for  its  women  statf.  The  Profi- 
ciency  Grade  was  restricted 
to  women  aged 
over  24years,  with  a  minimum  of  five  years 
experience  who  had  completed  Part  One  of the 
Institute  of  Bankers  examination 
and  who 
would  complete  Part  Two  within  a  reasonable 
period  after  transfer  to  the  new  grade  @lidland 
Bank  Group  Archives,  1991).  The  bank’s  con- 
cern 
is, 
however,  undermined  by  a statement  in  1964: 

the  position  of  women 

to  improve 

Young  men  of  special  aptitude  can  quality  for  the 
“Special  Grade”.  This  makes  them  eligible  for  accel- 
erated  tmining (and  an immediate  substantial increase 
in  salary)  leading,  in  turn,  to  enhanced  prospects  of 
promotion  at an earlier  age  than  those,  who,  perhaps, 
develop  their  abilities later. 

Young  women  can  enter  a  “Proficiency  Grade” 
designed  to  create  equal opportunities,  canying  equal 
pay,  for  those  who  are  prepared  to  accept  the  same 
standards  of  quahiications  and  performance  as  are 
applied  to  their  male  colleagues.  Women  selected  for 
the  “Proficiency  Grade”  are immediately tm&ened 
to 
the  same  scale  of  salaries  as men.  Those  who  are  sui- 
tably qualiiied then  become  eligible for  consideration 
for  all  appointments,  including  managerial,  carrying 
identical salaries for men  holding similar appointments 
@4idland,  1964  corporate  annttal report). 

It  is now  more  important  than  ever  that  our  younger 
men  should  be  given  every  opportunity  to  develop 
fully their abilities and personalities.  The  proportion  of 
men  to  total  staiT continues  to  decline  and  in  con- 
sequence  a  greater  proportion  of  male  staff  will  be 
required  to f3l an increasing  number  of managerial and 
other  executive  positions.  The  opportunities  for  our 
younger  men  are greater  than they have ever been,  and 
promotion  will  tend  to  come  at  an  earlier  age. 
(National Proviocial,  1956  corporate  annual report). 

Those  women  who  were  over  24  and  who 
had  not  reached  the  Proficiency  Grade  were  on 
a  lower  salary  scale  than  their  male  counter- 
parts  (Midland Bank  Group  Archives  1991). 

In  addition  to  implying  that  women  did  not 
want  to  achieve  as  much  as  men,  the  banks 
were  very  keen  to  mention 

by women: 

Concern  with  the  position  of male  employees 
is  reflected  not  only  in  the  emphasis  placed  on 

We  have  opened  a  number  of  new  branches  during 
the  year,  including  one  in  the  West  End  of  London 
under  the  management  of  a  member  of  our  women

hailed  in  some  quarters  as  a  portent,  as 

lndeedInasenseitis,butitmayalsoberegardedasa 
natural and perhaps  somewhat  belated recognition  that 
the  holding  of  responslble  posts  ln  contact  with  our 
cu3tomem  ls no  longer  necessarily  an  exclusively  male 
preserve  (Barclays,  1958  corpomte  annual report). 

Such  emphasis 

if  they  wanted 

implies  that  women  could 
develop  careers 
to,  although 
very  little  indication  is  given  of  the  success  of 
women  overall.  Miss  Harding  presumably  was 
not  one  of  many  successful  women  employees. 
The  substantial  increase  in  bank  disclosures 
in  the  period,  some  as  we  have  seen  of  con- 
siderable  length,  appears  to  have  reflected  the 
economics  of  technological 
change,  and  the 
need 
to  recruit  a  large  number  of  staff  for 
mainly  routine  work.  Technological  change  can 
be  equated  with  progress  and  more  women 
employees  meant  better  (management)  oppor- 
tunities  for  men.  Such  recruitment 
and  dis- 
closure  might  be  said  to  reflect  the  financial 
pressures  on  management,  yet  in  contrast  the 
continued  preference 
for  male  managers  and 
the  recruitment  of  male  trainees  suggests  the 
continuation  of patriarchal  values.  The  period  is 
also  characterised  as  being  the  beginnings  of 
trade  unionism  in banking.” 

and  early  1960s  saw  significant 
developments 
in  the  retail  sector.  The  end  of 
controls  (particularly  on  building  and  of  ration- 
ing),  combined  with  a  growth 
in  suburban 
estates,  expansion  in  car  ownership  and  rising 
real  incomes  saw  a  growth  in  unit  size  (Cham- 
ley,  1972;  Winstanley,  1994). 
In  addition  the 
new  consumerism  was  boosted  by  the  advent 
of  the  !irst  commercial 
in 
1955,  colour  supplements,  and  the  abandon- 
ment  of  resale  price  maintenance 
in  1964 
(Charnley,  1972;  Winstanley,  1994).

In  contrast  to  the  greater  disclosure  in  bank 
corporate  annual  reports,  we  noted  only  one 

and  G.  HART@ 

disclosure  by  retail  companies 
in  the  15 years 
1950-  1964.  In  contrast  to  the  banks  there  was 
no  indication  of  the  need  to  adapt  to  new 
technology.  Yet  as  in  the  case  of  the  banks, 
retail  companies  were  keen  to  attract  young 
men  to  careers  during  the  1950s. 

It is not  always  reallsed  what  a  varlety  of  opportu- 
nlties thls lirm  can  offer  to  young  men.  In addltion to 
side  of  our  busi- 
the  opportunities  on  the  tech&al 
ness,  there  are  attractive  careers 
ln  selllng-nztall, 
wholesale  and export-and 
in such  fields as Publicity, 
Buying  and general  business  admi&tration. 

.For  the  special  tmining  of  candidates  who  show 
promise  of  reaching  senior  rank,  we  have  organ&d  a 
course,  candidates  for  which  are  chosen  lrre- 
train@ 
spective  of  their  background.. 
1955  corps- 
rate  annual repoti). 

Unfortunately  “background”  does  not  appear 

to  include  gender. 

The  emphasis  here  is  clearly  very  different 
from  that  in  banking.  At  the  beghming  of  the 
period,  banking  was  dominated  by  men,  and 
the  response  was  to  improve  the  managerial 
opportunities 
for  men  while  simultaneously 
increasing  the  recruitment  of  women.  In  retail, 
on  the  other  hand,  women  constituted 
the 
majority  of  employees,  many  of  whom  worked 
part-time  (Scott,  1994),  and  the  emphasis  was 
on  attracting  men  for  managerial  and  respon- 
sible positions.  In banking  the  emphasis  was  on 
train@ 
young  men  for  senior  management. 
This  reassurance  of  the  opportunities  for  men 
was  more  important  in  banking  where  the  pro 
portion  of  women  was  increasing.  It  suggests 
that  patriarchal  intluences  remain  an  explana- 
tion  for  the  limited  managerial  involvement  of 
cheaper  women.  Similarly,  while  there  would 
appear 
to 
increase 
in  retail 
management, 
there  was  little  or  no  indication 
that  this  happened  in  the  period.  The  .one  dis- 
closure 
similarly 
the 
emphasised  male  opportunities.  Overall 

to  have  been  financial  incentives 
the  involvement  of  women 

in  the  retail  sector 

traced 

“Although  the  National  Union  of  Bank  Employees  (NUBE),  later  to  become  the  Banking,  Insurance  and  Finance  Union 
(BlFU),  was  not  formally  recognised  by  the  major  clearing  banks  until  1%7,  its growth  has  been  attributed  to  the  greater 
feml&ation  of  the  labour  force  in this period.

798 

C. A. ADAMS and G. HARTE 

(Savage,  1992),  with  a  significant rise in  bran- 
ches  from  lo@6 
in  1960  to  12,315  in  1968 
(Morris, 1986).  The nature of banking had also 
been  changing, with  increased mechanisation, 
computerisation  and  changes  in  the  type  of 
staff needed  (Crompton  & Jones,  1984). Yet 
during  this  period  there  remained  a  cIearIy 
gendered division of Iabour, where  female and 
male stalf were  recruited  into  different grades 
(with  different  ceilings  for  increments,  the 
absence of pensions for women, an expectation 
that women would retire on marriage and poor 
promotion  prospects  in  the  clerical  grades 
occupied  mainly by  women)  (Savage,  1992). 
Boyden (1986)  highlights this with  the  repro- 
duction  of  banks’  recruitment  adverts,  which 
iIh.tstrate their segregated recruitment policies. 
Women  comprised  approximately  haIf  the 
workforce in the  London clearing banks (Egan, 
1982),  although  this  growth 
in  women’s 
employment was  mainly in  low  grade  clerical 
work, and computer related jobs (Crompton & 
Sanderson,  1994).  Even  in  the  late  196Os, 
although  women  were  now  in  the  majority, 
they  were  expected  to  leave  employment  on 
marriage and could expect  little chance  of pro- 
motion (Halford et al.,  1997). 

During the period  1964-1970,  disclosures by 
the  banks  amounted  to  nine  in  seven  years. 
Despite the  growing awareness of the  position 
of women it seemed that in this period, at least 
as  far  as  one  of  the  banks  was  concerned, 
equality for women was not really an issue:

Bank of Scotland, 1%7  corporate annual report). 

The  National  CommerciaI Bank of  Scotland 
claimed to have appointed the first female Bank 
Manager in  Scotland  in  1964-to  head  their 
new  Iadies  Branch-and 
the  1%7  corporate 
annual report  of  the  National ProvinciaI con- 
tains  some  news  clippings,  including  one 
claiming: 

The NP struck a blow for female equality in October

men as branch 

1967 corporate annual repolt). 

Yet  the  position  of  women  appeared  to 
improve more in terms of quantity of jobs than 
necessarily positions of responsibility. The 1965 
Westminster report referred to  earlier had con- 
trasted the position with  1907: 

only men were employed until 1907 when the Lon- 
don  and  County  Bank  took  on  four  lady  “type- 
w&e&‘.  With  the  change  over  to  mechanimtion 
more and more women were taken on the sta@ so that 
today in the younger age groups tiey  outnumber the 
men (WesmUuxer, 1%5  corporate annual report). 

It seems reasonable to  interpret this as indi- 
cating  that  the  higher  levels  of  responsibility 
continued to be occupied by male staff, almost 
entirely.  Certaimy by  1967,  while  there  was 
approximately 76,000  women  working in  the 
London clearing banks, 99% were routine ckzricai 
staff, and less than 1% of the  10,000  managerial 
posts were held by women (Heritage, 19s3). 

sector  continued in the 
1960s.  The  1964  Resale Prices Act  had en&d 
the  practice  of  resale  price  maintenance 
(Shafto,  1977) 
thus  increasing  competition, 
and  by  1966  10%  of  sales  were  on  credit 
(Benson,  1994).  However,  the  government’s 
preference  to  stimulate manufacturing saw the 
introduction of  a  selective employment tax  in 
1966,  affecting  mainiy service  industries and 
putting pressure on wage costs. 

Retail disclosures amounted to  only seven in 
the  seven  year  period.  Although  managerial 
careers in retaii never acquired the  same status 
as  their  counterparts  in  other  sectors  (Scott, 
1994),  it  is  apparent  that  women  got  into 
supervisory positions much  quicker and in Iar- 
ger numbers, than in the banks: 

We  have  a  StalT Maoageress in  each  store,  one  of 
whose tasks is to  administer our health and welfare 
schemes with understanding and common sense. 
Webelievethatoursta@cometousmoreforacamer 
than for a job. That many do is borne out by the large 
number who  have been with  us  for  most  of  their 
working lives (Marks and Spencer,  1%5  corporate 
annual repolt).

PORTRAYAL OP WOMEN’S EMPLOYMENT IN CORPORATE ANNUAL REPORTS 

799 

many  hundreds of women who started their caaeer 
with us as sales ass&ants now hold supervixq  posi- 
tionsiathesunesandinthe 
admin&mtion and buy- 
ing  departmnts  in  our  Head  Of’Ece (Marks and 
Spencer, 1%6  corporate annual rrport). 

However, it  appears that  it was  just as di& 
cult  for  women  to  get  into  top  management 
positions  in  the  retail  sector  as  it  was  in  the 
banks. The  first woman  to  reach  top  manage- 
ment  level in  British Home Stores did not  get 
there  until  1968  and her  job was  one  perhaps 
seen  as  more  becoming  of women,  than,  say, 
finance, publicity or  buying would have been. 
Even  so,  the  company  still apparently felt the 
need  to  justify the  appointment to  the  outside 
world: 

. . .we also appointed.. 
P. Downs, who is a per- 
sonnel coatroller in charge of our female staE  We..  . 
congratulateMissDownsiuparticularonbeingthe 
first woman  in  our  business to  have  attaiaed top 
management level. For  a business whose customers 
are ptedominvltly women tbis seems a most logical 
step  (?Mish  Home  Stores,  I%8  corporate  annual 
report). 

No  comment  was  made  on  how  difticult it 
had been or how long it had taken to reach this 
position, nor  regarding the  more  general posi- 
tion of women in senior management. 

Yet,  despite some getting into management, 
women  were  likely still to  be  regarded  as  a 
cheap  labour  source,  a  large  proportion  of 
whom worked part-time: 

Govemment policy, in  discrimin?ting against the 
retail trade, fails to  encourage those methods which 
are most likely to increase productivity in distribution 
-  namely:-

vahrable contribution to  the  eftidency of  the  store 
and to  the national man(&)po 
policy;. 
and Spencer, 1%7  corporate armual report). 

Our  review  of  disclosures  in  both  sectors 
during  this  period  revealed  surprisingly few 
developments  in  employment  practice  and 
reporting.  Although this  may  reflect  the  eco 
nomic  and  social  uncertainties  of  the  period, 
the  growth  in women’s  employment could  be 
seen  to  demand greater  comment  by  manage- 

ment. Despite isolated examples in both sectors 
the  overwhelming impression is  that  women 
were involved (increasingly in the banks), albeit 
only  up  to  a  certain  level.  Despite  general 
claims of concern  there is little evidence which 
would indicate a genuine management concern 
with equal opportunities. The suggestion is that 
both  in  the  actual  disclosures  and  in  the 
absence of comment expressing concern  about 
women’s  employment  rights,  the  growth  in 
women’s  employment arose for economic  rea- 
sons  rather  than  management willi@ 
aban- 
doning  patriarchal  values.  Despite  increasing 
intolerance  in  some  sections  of  society  and 
concern  regarding  the  position  of  women, 
there was no reporting attempting to reveal the 
extent  to  which  women  were  disadvantaged. 
The  limited mporting indulging in bland state- 
ments  and anecdotal evidence may reflect the 
influence of the  forthcoming equal pay legisla- 
tion with companies unwilling to  high&&t the 
extent  of disparity between women  and men’s 
employment  and  thus  the  possible  costs  of 
compliance. 

1970-1979 

The  1970s  saw  a  period  of  considerable 
industrial unrest,  political  instability and  eco 
nomic  crises  in  Britain. We  were  entering  an 
era  which  has  been  described  as  one  of 
decomposition,  uncertainty  and  crisis,  follow- 
ing  the  previous  “Golden Age”  (Hobsbawm, 
1994).  The  collapse of fixed exchange  rates in 
1971  was followed in  1972  by a miners’ strike, 
a  state  of emergency and power  cuts.  Further 
industrial action followed in  1973,  culminating 
in  the  three  day  week,  and  oil  prices  quad- 
rupled.  Prices  and wages  spimlled, with  infla- 
tion  at  27%  in  1975.  By  1976  the  Iabour 
government  had  abandoned  the  goal  of  Ml 
employment and  sterling was  in  crisis. Unem- 
ployment  rose  sharply.  By  1978 
industrial 
unrest had returned in what has been described 
as  the  “winter  of  discontent”.  The  post  war 
period  of peace  and relative prosperity, when 
incomes  and  prices  rose,  appeared  to  be

coming to an end (Youngson,  1976).  However, 
the  global economic  crises  of  the  1970s  was 
only one of three challenges to the State, along 
with  citizenship  rights  and  representation 
(Gamble, 1994). 

By  1971  the  labour force  participation rates 
of women  in  their  forties were  as  high as  for 
women  in  their  early  twenties  (Crompton  & 
Sanderson, 1986).  Increasmgly women were re- 
entering  the  labour  force  after  having  had  a 
kmily,anditwasatthistimethatwesawthe 
first legislation to combat discrimination against 
women,  the  Equal Pay  Act  1970,  which  was 
followed by the Sex LMscrimination Act  1975.” 
Together  they  had a  direct  impact  on  employ- 
ment policies of organisations. 

The  8qual  Pay  Act  requires  that  if  an 
employee is doing the  same or  broadly similar 
work as another employee of the  opposite sex 
(or  work  which  is  seen  to  be  of  equal value 
under a job evaluation scheme),  that person is 
entitled to  equal pay and treatment.  However, 
employers  were  allowed  five  years  notice 
before the legislation came into force, enabling 
them, in the views of some, to segregate female 
and male employment further, making it more 
ditlicuh  to  show  that  women  and  men  were 
doing  similar work  (I&our  Research  Depart- 
ment,  1993).  Despite  this,  women’s  earnings 
rose from a previous 60%, which  had been the 
case  up  to  the  late  1960s 
to  70%  of  men’s 
eamings,  a  figure which  had  been  increasing 
slightly,  despite 
recessions 
(Ruberry & Tarling, 1988).  There  appeared to

be less institutional opposition to  equal oppor- 
tunities at  the  time  (Walby,  1986)  with  trade 
unions  in  particular  actively  campa@@ 
for 
equal pay from the mid 1960s  onwards. 

The  1975  Act set up the Equal Opportunities 
Commission (EOC) with the aim of eliminating 
sex  discrimination, promoting  equal  opportu- 
nities between  the  sexes  and monitoring both 
the  Sex  Dkknination  Act  and the  Equal Pay 
Act.” 

Banking 

From  the  mid  1970s  the  banks were  faced 
with  major  restructuring  due  to  competition 
from building societies  and the  general dereg- 
ulation of financial services (Savage, 1992).  As a 
result the  subsequent growth  in centralisation 
meant  a  growth  in  the  managerial hierarchy, 
but a reduction in the authority of branch man- 
agers (Savage, 1992).  Since this appears to have 
coincided  with  women  auaining this  level  of 
management, this may support  Legge’s (1987) 
suggestion that  women  can  play a central role 
so long as it remains peripheral to central man- 
agement.  Women’s  involvement was  confined 
to  middle  management,  not  to  positions  of 
authority (Savage, 1992).  Education was instru- 
mental in  this progress.  ln  its  1965  corporate 
annual report,  the Westminster reported a pol- 
icy allowing educated women to compete with 
men  for  higher level  jobs.  Barclays also high- 
lighted the  growing weight attached  to  educa- 
tion in its 1971  corporate annual report when it 
reported that its staff won  six of the ten prizes

awarded for  completion  of  the  final exams  of 
Institute of Bankers and that  the  six were  divi- 
ded  equally between  women  and  men.  This 
was  indeed worthy  of  report  at  a  time  when 
women  constituted  only  1.2% of the  member- 
ship  of  the  Institute  of  Bankers  (Chiplin  & 
Sloane,  1976).  Given  evidence  that  women 
were actively dissuaded from taking the Institute 
of Bankers exams (see Crompton &Jones,  1984; 
Llewellyn, 1981;  Munn, 1988)  this repordng on 
the successes of a few women can be seen as an 
effort  to  hide  the  bank’s  attempts  to  hinder 
women’s progress. It was during this period that 
the practice of separate female and male recruit- 
ment literature ceased (Llewellyn, 1981). 

Despite the  increasing level of disclosure in 
bank corporate  annual reports  revealed in the 
previous two  periods  of  our  study, and  some 
as  women’s 
institutional  encouragement 
employment (and  other)  rights became  recog- 
nised  in  legislation, there  were  only  two  dis- 
closures in the period  1970-  1979.  Perhaps this 
is not surprising. Previously the National Union 
of  Bank  Employees  had  adopted  a  policy  of 
equal pay  by  1967  (before  the  passing of  the 
Equal Pay Act in 1970  which came into force in 
1975).  However, with  the  introduction  of  dif- 
ferentiated  grade  structures  in  the  clearing 
banks whereby  women  and men  were  recrui- 
ted at the  same grade level, discrimination sim- 
ply  became  more  subtle,  with  banks  not 
wishing  to  highlight  the  relative  position  of 
women  and  men.  The  Sex  Discrimination Act 
1975  did not  prevent  such  subtle forms of dis- 
crimination and  one  bank  clearly  saw  it  as  a 
diversion from the  increasingly difticult task of 
making money: 

I  Iind  it  saddening  that  during  this  period  of  grave 
economic  diflicuhy  so  much  management

plex  statutes.  I  have  in  mind,  for  example,  such 
enactmentsasthe...Sex

Ihscrimination  Act.. 

It  appears that in the case of the banks it was 
now  less  appropriate  to  discuss opportunities 

for young women  and young men, particularly 
since  men  were  benefiting from  some  advan- 
tage.  The  introduction of  legislation, with  the 
attendant possibility of public inquiry and bad 
publicity, might be viewed as a discouragement 
to  disclose.  Evidence  of  banks  discoumging 
women  from  taking  the  Institute  of  Bankers 
examinations is  indicative of  the  banks’ patri- 
archal attitudes and, at a time when such views 
were becoming unacceptable to many, provides 
further insight into reasons for nondisclosure. 

Retail 

The  1970s  saw  the  introduction of the  first 
hypermarkets  in  Britain  (Benson,  1994), 
although the recession in 1973-1975,  the three 
day week, price controls and consumer protec- 
tion  legislation  all  contributed  to  a  halt  in 
growth  in  the  retail sector.  In  contrast  to  the 
banks, the  retail companies, which  had fewer 
disclosures in the  previous two  periods, made 
18  disclosures in  the  1970s.  This  includes  a 
breakdown  of  female  and  male  full-time and 
part-time employees made  each  year  by  W  H 
Smith. Other disclosures suggest some commit- 
ment  to  the  position  of  women,  with  an 
emphasis on  recruitment  but  no  reference  to 
the irony of their representation in certain jobs. 
For example; 

We  employ  many  more  women  than  men--largely 
because  of  the  preponderance  of women  in our  retaII 
branches.  We  are  anxious  themfore  to  see  them  in 
positions  of  Importance  within  the  organisation  and 
are  very  pleased  to  have  appointed 
two  women 
directors  to  boards  of  our  subsidiary companies.  Last 
year  more  than  400  graduates  covering  many di&rent 
disciplines  joined  the  company  and  almost  half  of 
these  were  women. 

One  hundred  branches  of  Boots  The  Chemists  are 
managed  by women  pharmacbts  and this numbef  will 
surely  increase  since  more  than  half  the  graduates 
from  schools  of  pharmacy  are  female  (Boots,  1975 
corporate  annual report). 

We  now  employ  both  men  and  women  In  positions 
which  were  once  only held by one  sex.  We  have  over 
100  women 
tmlnlng  for  Store  Management.  We 
employ  women  as  merchandisers  and  technomglsts

Suprroisors in our Stotw (Ma&s and Spencer, 1979

Earlier  Marks  and  Spencer  had  introduced 
greater benefits for part-timers, which would be 
of particular benefit to women, with: 

. . .  a  much  improved Pension Scheme for  aII staB 
incIuding patwimcm @Iarks and Spencer, 1975  cor- 
porate amluaI report). 

The  1970s  offer  us  an  interesting  contrast 
between  the  two  sectors.  While the  retail sec- 
tor appeared keen to public&  efforts to recruit 
more  women  to  jobs  with  greater  responsi- 
bility, although ignoring the irony of their dom- 
ination  in  non-management employment,  the 
legislative developments of the  1970s  appear to 
have  done  little to  encourage  either  sector  to 
provide  detailed information with  which  one 
might judge how  well  equality of  opportunity 
was  being achieved. This may reflect  the  eco 
nomic turmoil of the  period and the  extent  to 
which  controntation  and discontent was wide- 
spread. The legislation appears to  have tackled 
the more overt pat&r&al  attitudes. There may 
also  have  been  uncertainty  arising from  the 
new  legislation and  the  absence  of  reflective 
disclosures  could  have  been  due  to  concern 
regarding the possibility of them being used as 
the  basis for  investigations or  as  evidence  in 
legal  cases  (e.g.  Renston,  1982;  Solomons, 
1974).  Nondisclosure may have sought to  pre- 
vent  attention being directed to  greater oppor- 
tunities for  men,  which  made  little  economic 
sense and which contravened the legislation. 

1979-1993 

democracy  (Pearce  &  Stewart,  1992).  The 
change of government led to  a sharp recession 
and  significant  increases  in  unemployment 
(Broadberry,  1994).  In  1980,  unemployment 
rose to two million for the first time since 1938, 
rising to over three million in 1982.  Although it 
is claimed that  the  economy  recovered,  unem- 
ployment  remained at  this  level, while  indus- 
trial disputes rose as deindusuialisation and the 
closure  of  manufacturing businesses unfolded. 
Despite this overall increase in unemployment, 
the  banking  and  retail  sectors  continued  to 
grow- 

During this final period of our study further 
legislative  developments  were  introduced  in 
the  Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations, 1983 
with the expansion from equal work to work of 
equal value (like work, work rated as equivalent 
and  work  of  equal  value  (Labour  Research 
Department,  1993)).  However,  subsequent 
research  indicated  that  employers  acted  to 
reduce  their  obligations under  the  Act,  to  the 
detriment  of  their  female workforce  (Depart- 
ment  of  Employment,  1991).  Walby  (1986) 
sped&ally  refers to  one  employers’ federation 
advising its  members  on  how  to  reduce  the 
impact of the  legislation. A survey, early in the 
period, indicated the  enormity of the problem, 
when of the top  500  companies in the country, 
only  25%  had  a  written  policy  statement  on 
equal  opportunities  for  women  (ROC,  1981). 
The  EOC published a  Code of Practice  for the 
elimination of discrimination on the grounds of 
sex and marriage and the promotion of equality 
of  opportunity in  employment (ROC, 1985>.‘* 
However,  &spite  an  emphasis  on  internal 
monitoring, there  is no  call for firms to  report 
on  their performance,  in  the  annual report  or 
elsewhere. 

The  election  of  a  radical Conservative gov- 
Despite this  apparently weak  infrastructure 
(see  Sachs (1986)  for a detailed critique of the 
ernment in  1979,  was to  herald a period which 
failures of the  EOC), women’s participation in 
encouraged both the concept of a property own- 
ing  democracy  and  subsequent sham  owning  paid employment (excluding armed forces, fire

have  been  particularly 
in  part-time  employ-

part-time  employment 
(compared  with  7%. of 
men  (Crompton  &  Le  Feuvte,  1992))  and  84% 
of  the  part-time  workforce  was  female  (&&zZ 
Trends).  Thus  the  percentage  of  women 
in 
part-time  work  has  been  growing,  as  has  the 
age  of the  female  labour  force  (Dex,  1985). 

(Halford 

This  increasing  feminisation  of the  workforce 
has  not  been  accompanied  by  a  breakdown  of 
its  sexual  division  (PoEert  &  Rees,  1992). 
In 
fact,  the  growth  of  part-time  work  for  women 
has  allowed  men  to  retain  their  expectations  of 
linear  careers 
1997).  Women 
continue  to  dominate  particular  sectors,  and  a 
range  of  occupations.  They  ate  generally  loca- 
ted  in sectors  where  employment  is less  secure, 
earnings  are  low,  promotion  opportunities  few 
and  collective  organisation  weak 
(Martin  & 
Wallace,  1984).  The  growth  in  female  employ- 
ment  has  been  associated  with  the  desire  for 
flexibility.  Almost  half  of  women 
in  full-time 
work  in  recent  years  have  been  classified  as 
receiving  “low  pay”,  by  the  Low  Pay  Unit  @ex 
1994).  Evidence  suggests  that  women’s 
relative  earnings  are  signiftcantly  lower 
than 
men’s  (see  Pillinger,  1992;  Smith,  1979;  Vickers, 
1991)  with full time eamings  for fem;Je  workers, 
on  average,  about  25% of men’s  (EOC,  1990). 

Despite  this  continued,  and  somewhat  dete- 
riorating  position,  the  emphasis  in  policy  mak- 
ing  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  has  increasingly 
been  on  a  vohmtaristic 
and  managerial& 
approach.  The  view  is  increasingly  expressed 
that  equal  opportunities 
is  not  simply  about 
securing  equal  rights  (the  so-called  moral  argu- 
ment)  but  is  a  matter  central  to  national  eco 
nomic  objectives  and  the  need  to  make  the 
most  of  all human  resources  (the  so-called  eco 
nomic  argument) 
(EOC,  1988).  Demographic 
change,  in particular  the  skills mismatch  (Rees, 
1992) 
is  clearly  an  issue  of  some  importance 
and may go  some  way  to  explaining  the  growing 

interest  of  employers  (Confederation  of  British 
Industry,  1988,  referred  to  in Cockbum,  1991). 
As  a  consequence 
the  EOC  sees  its  role  chan- 
ging  from  being  largely  concerned  with  secur- 
ing  equal  rights  for  women  to  a  major  role  in 
achieving  central  national  economic  objectives 
through  the  implementation  of  effective  equal 
opportunities  practice.

(Storey, 

1995).  Growth 

  By  1979  bank  staff had  doubled  since  1959  to 
reaching  504,000  by  1990  (Egan, 
over  221,000 
1982).  Some  of  this  arose  from  expansion 
in 
business,  while  some  resulted  from  the  dereg- 
ulation  of  building  societies  and  in  particular 
the  conversion  of  one,  the  Abbey  National,  to 
banking 
in 
women’s  employment  was  particularly  marked, 
rising  by  32%  in the  period  19sO-1991  with  an 
84%  rise  in  women’s  part-time  employment 
(Cressey  &  Scott,  1992).  However,  by  the  end 
of  our  period  it  was  clear  that  the  increased 
competition,  particularly  from  the  deregulated 
building  societies, 
tech- 
nology,  reorganisation  and  rationalisation  of 
branches  and  reorganisation  of  delivery  of  ser- 
vice,  was  having  an  impact  on  employment 
levels  (Cressey  &  Scott,  1992).  This  change  is 
reflected  in a change  in bank  culture.  Cressey  81 
Scott  (1992)  describe  a  shift  away  from  the 
paternalistic 
culture,  with 
greater  emphasis  on  performance 
and  flex- 
ibility, in part  due  to  the  recession.  The  banking

caIly as might  first  seem,  but  suggests  that  such 
developments  should  be  seen  in  the  light  of 
changes  in the  way  banks  are  organised,  and  in 
particular  the  growth  in  middle  management, 
which  has  created  more  positions  of  high 
expertise,  but  with  limited  authority  (Savage, 
1993).  Thus,  although  more  women  might  be

influential than  once  was  the  case.  Halford

During  our  final period  the  level  of disclosure

indicating  such  include:

In the past, the lack of defined arrangements for re- 
entry after a period of absence.. 
to raise a family may 
have inhibited the progress of some women. At the 
beginning of  1981  an  experimental scheme  was 
introduced to  enable selected women  to  return to 
resume their career with the Bank (WestmitMer, 1981 
corporate annual report). 

A number of equal opportunity initiatives have been 
taken both to  ensure there is a0  unfair or  unlawful 
discrimination and to support the Bank’s commitment 
to  select the  best person for  each job.  This year a 
scheme will be introduced to  enable career women 
and men to break their service for up to five years to 
fulfil pre-school child care commitments and return to 
resume their careers (Midland, 1984 corporate annual 
report). 

However,  as  recently  as  1983  a  complaint 
was  made  to  the  Equal  Opportunities  Commis 
sion  (EOC,  1987) 
that  Barclays  Bank  were 
operating  an  informal  two  tier  recruitment  sys- 
tem  based  on  gender.  Perhaps  as a result  of this 
complaint,  Barclays  1991  and  1992  corporate 
annual  reports  are  unique  in  including  a  bar 
chart  depicting  female  staff  as  a  percentage  of 
each  grade  in  1988  and  1991.  In  1991  women 
occupied  between  about  65  and  80%  of each  of 
the  bottom  four  grades,  about  60%  of  grade  5 
staff,  28%  of  grade  six  staff  and  about  11%  of 
managerial  staff.  In  1993  such  detailed  analysis 
was  no  longer  provided  though  the  bank  com- 
pared  progress  with  1982: 

. . .Since 1982, we have more than double-d the num- 
ber of women senior non-e 
grades to 46 per 
cent, whilst 15 per cent of managers m  now women, 
compared to fewer than 4 per cent in 1982 (Barclays, 
1982 corporate annual report). 

In  the  same  year, 

the  Bank  of  Scotland 
reported  that  it  had  doubled  the  proportion  of 
women  on  the  Assistant  Manager  grades  to  one 
third  of  the  total. 

The  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  also  saw  the 
banks  reporting  a number  of initiatives from  the 
the

climate  of  increasing  demand  for  corporate

Indeed  a  purely  “commercial

  By  1981  the  retail  trade  was  dominated  by 
department  and chain  stores  (Benson,  1994).  At 
the  beginning  of  our  final period  one  in  eleven 
women  in  the  British  workforce  was  employed 
in  retailing  (Scott,  1994).  By  1988  this  was  one 
in  ten,  with  women  comprising  64%  of  the 
workforce  in that  sector  and  83%  of  sales  assis- 
tants  (the  lowest  level)  (Broadbridge,  1991).  Of 
the  female  workforce,  25%  worked  part-time 
which  suited  a  sector  coping  with  substantial 
merger  activity  as well  as growth  due  to  advan- 
ces  in  electronic  technology,  longer  hours  and 
new  locations  (Dale,  1989). 

The 

increase 

in  frequency  of  retail  dis- 
closures  was  even  more  significant  than  that  of 
bank disclosures  in this period.  We  recorded  5 1 
disclosures  in  the  15 years,  although  many  of 
these  were  extremely  brief,  often  being  short

appeared  in a similar form  in consecutive  years.

the  Kingfisher/Woolworth 
subsidiary  B  &  Q, 
which  did  not  appoint  its  lirst  woman  district

unique  in  reporting  the  progress  of  women  in 
quantitied  terms: 

Within  the  Group  women

any  of  the  companies  attempted 
to  describe 
what  they  were  doing  to  improve  the  position 
of  women.  Indications  of  why  they  were  con- 
cerned  are  provided  by  Kingfisher  and  Boots:

more  recent  employer  interest  in  equal  oppor- 
tunities  appears  to  have  developed  for  financial 
reasons,  due  to  demographic  changes  (Adams 
et  al.,  1991),  one  might  also  have  expected 
firms  to  publicist  their  achievements  for  public 
(lewson  et  al,  1992).  Yet 
relations  purposes 
the  study  by  Adams  et al. (1995~) 
focused  on 
the  largest  lirms,  the  group  most  likely  to  be 
reporting  on  equal  opportunities.  Perhaps, 
unsurprisingly,  we  did  not  detect  a  reflective 
reporting  of  equal  opportunities  performance, 
relatively  little  detail  regarding  the  extent  of 
female  employment  at  different  levels  in  the 
workforce,  and  little  in  the  way  of  specific  tar- 
gets.  Although  firms  in  both  sectors  disclosed 
policies, 
little  detail  of  actual  practices  were 
noted,  despite  the  continuing  disparities  which 
exist  between  the  recruitment  and  treatment  of 
female  and  male  workers.  Despite  direct  dis- 
crimination  being  illegal,  recruitment 
criteria 
such  as continuity  of employment,  mobility  and 
ability  to  work  long  hours  resulted  in  indirect 
discrimination  (see,  for  example,  Broadbridge, 
1991;  Cockburn,  1991;  Cressey  &  Scott,  1992; 
Halford  et cd., 1997;  Storey,  1995). 

CONCLUDING  DISCUSSION 

Our  study  allowed  us  to  consider  the  extent 
of  equal  opportunities  reporting  in  the  59year 
period  in  two  sectors  which  have  appeared  to 
offer  different  experiences 
for  women.  Our 
focus  has  also  been  on  only  the  largest  lirms,  as 
largest  employers, 
these  are 
the 
and  are 
thought  more 
likely  to  offer  voluntary  dis 
closure  (Cowen  et al.,  1987;  Gray  et al.,  1995; 
Trotman  & Bradley,  1981).  Our  study  indicates 
that  although  the  corporate  annual  reports  have 
been  valuable  historical  documents 
shedding 
to  women’s  employment, 
light  on  attitudes 
they  need  to  be  examined  in  the  light  of  other

agreed  social interest, rather than that different 
groups  in society will  have diRerent goals. Our 
review  has  suggest4 
both  in  industrial action, resistance to  change, 
and  a  slow  development  of  legislation,  with 
limited  impact  on  managerial  communication 
and ultimately of  the position  of  women  in the 
labour  force.  The  evidence  suggests that firms 
were  slow  to  respond  even  to 
legislative 
encouragement,  and appeared  to actively  resist 
in some  cases. Although  more  recent  develop 
ments in reporting  appear to suggest a growing 
recognition  of  the  importance  of  equality,  the 
absence  of  detailed  information  on  perfor- 
mance, and that there is an economic  incentive 
to  encourage  equality  of  opportunity,  suggests 
that  a  political  economy  explanation,  which 
encompasses  patriarchy,  might  offer  a  better 
basis for understanding disclosure practice. 

Our  findings  suggest  that  up  to  the  mid 
19soS we  were  able  to  detect  pmctices  con- 
sistent with  both  economic  interests and, parti- 
cularly  in  regard  to  managerial  positions  and 
general  recruitment,  patriarchal  influences. 
Since the mid  1980s we  have also Seen clearer, 
though  more  general  commitments  to  equality 
of  opportunity.  As  yet,  the  evidence  is  not 
available to  indicate that firms have abandoned 
patriarchal  views.  Unlike  Tinker  &  Neimark 
(1987)  we  are  unable  to  conclude  with  firm 
conviction  that  a  political  economy  explana- 
tion,  favouring  class rather than patriarchy, of 
the  employment  of  women  is the  more  appro 
priate  here. I6  The  story  of  women’s  employ- 
ment  in  banking  and  retail  told  by  corporate 
annual reports  and  interpreted  in  the  light  of 
the  social  and other  developments  in  the  per- 
iod,  suggests a continuing  importance  of  patri- 
archy,  which,  would  appear  to  be  largely  in 
place.  We  do,  however,  acknowledge 
that 
patriarchy needs  to  be  understood  in the  con- 
text  of  the  impemtives  of  the  economic  sys- 
tem.  A  hkFtory of  employment  in  banking  and 
retailing,  drawing  on  the  corporate  annual 

reports  when  set  in  the  social,  political  and 
economic  context  can  be  seen  to  be  largely 
MS story. 

Our  Iindings  with  respect  to  the  pervasive 
intluences  of  capitalism  and  patriarchy  on 
reporting  of  women’s  employment,  indicate  a 
bleak  prospect  for  voluntary  corporate  social

ment  in  which  they  operate.  It  suggests  that 
such accountability  is unlikely  to  be  provided 
without  some involvement  of  interested parties 
(such  as  employees, 
trade  unions,  human 
resource  management  departments  and,  in 
Britain, the  EOC)  whether  in the  development 
of  regulation  or  in the  preparation  of  informa- 
tion.  Yet  legislation  is  unlikely  to  be  passed 
until the  social and political  climate  has chan- 
ged.  Neither equal opportunities  legislation nor 
economic 
incentives  appear  to  have  broken 
down  the forces of patriarchy. While  these may 
be  weakened,  research  on  women’s  employ- 
ment and on voluntary corporate  social report- 
ing  both  suggest that corporate  annual reports 
are more important for what they do not reveal. 
There  are  implications  of  our  findings  for 
academics committed  to  the  development  of  a 
critical  corporate  social  reporting.  In  order  to 
influence  social  disclosure  practice, 
is 
necessary  to  understand  the  reasons  for  dis- 
closure.  The  time  for  descriptive  studies  of 
the  relationship between  the quantity of  social 
disclosures  and  company  size,  industry  or 
country  of  origin,  for  example,  whilst  useful 
initially in informing  about the  extent  of  social 
reporting,  has passed. We  now  need  a  better 
understanding of the nature  of corporate  social 
reporting  and its relationship to  the  context  in 
which 
it  is  made.  Further  research  should 
therefore  e xamine  corporate  social  (nonjdi- 
sclosures in their social, political  and economic
