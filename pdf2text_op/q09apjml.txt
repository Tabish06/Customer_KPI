Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of market orientation (MO)
and corporate social responsibility (CSR) on firm performance.
Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected via a questionnaire survey of star-rated
hotels in China and a total of 143 valid responses were received. The hypotheses were tested by
employing structural equation modelling with a maximum likelihood estimation option.
Findings – It was found that although both MO and CSR could enhance performance, once the
effects of CSR are accounted for, the direct effects of MO on performance diminish considerably to
almost non-existent. Although this result may be due to the fact that the research is conducted in
China, a country where CSR might be crucially important to performance given the country’s socialist
legacy, it nonetheless provides strong evidence that MO’s impact on organizational performance is
mediated by CSR.
Research limitations/implications – The main limitations include the use of cross-sectional data,
the subjective measurement of performance and the uniqueness of the research setting (China). The
findings provide an additional important insight into the processes by which a market oriented
culture is transformed into superior organizational performance.
Originality/value – This paper is one of the first to examine the joint effects of MO and CSR on
business performance. The empirical evidence from China adds to the existing literature on the
respective importance of MO and CSR.

Introduction
As a central tenet of the modern marketing sciences, market orientation (MO) has been
heralded by academics and practitioners for decades (see e.g. Felton, 1959; Kotler, 1984;
Levitt, 1960; Webster, 1988). Although there is a growing body of empirical evidence to
support the proposition that MO has positive impact on business performance (Narver
and Slater, 1990), several researchers have reported non-significant or even negative
effects for this association (see Kirca et al., 2005).

Previous attempts to reconcile the disparity in the current research findings were
made by either examining the moderating effects of environmental factors such as
market turbulence and competition intensity (Slater and Narver, 1994; Greenley, 1995;
Diamantopoulos and Hart, 1993), or identifying the mediators (Han et al., 1998; Sandvik
and Sandvik, 2003). Research findings using the former approach are so far non-
conclusive (Gotteland and Boule, 2006). For instance, while Greenley (1995) and Harris
(2001) found that a positive MO and business performance relationship exists only at
low level of market turbulence, Diamantopoulos and Hart (1993) showed that the
relationship exists at high level of market turbulence instead. In contrast, research on
the mediators has generated more consistent results. For example, innovation has been
consistently identified as a key mediator by several studies (Han et al., 1998; Agarwal
