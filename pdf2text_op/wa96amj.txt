 PREDICTING THE PERFORMANCE OF INITIAL

 PUBLIC OFFERINGS: SHOULD HUMAN

 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BE IN

 THE EQUATION?

 Population ecology is used to explain the role of human resource man-
 agement (HRM) in enhancing the performance of initial public offering
 (IPO) companies. We examined the determinants of structural inertia
 and developed hypotheses on the relationship between HRM and organi-
 zational performance. The results indicate that two human resource
 variables, human resource value and organization-based rewards, pre-
 dict initial investor reaction and long-term survival. The rewards vari-
 able negatively affects initial performance but positively affects survival.

 A growing body of literature focuses on the impact of human resource
 practices on organizational performance (Fisher, 1989; Huselid, 1994; Maho-
 ney & Deckop, 1986; Truss & Gratton, 1994). This research generally falls
 under the title of strategic human resource management (SHRM). SHRM
 is different from traditional human resource management in its focus on
 organizational outcomes, its integration of the various functional areas of
 human resource management, and its concern with a more macro perspective
 on the topic (Lundy, 1994). The field has progressed significantly; however,
 inadequate definitions and sparse theoretical development (Dyer & Kochan,
 1994; Kochan & Dyer, 1993; Zedeck & Cascio, 1984) continue to plague it,
 and only a handful of studies have used multi-industry, multifirm samples
 with independent measures of firm performance (cf. Abowd, Milkovich, &
 Hannon, 1990; Huselid, 1995; Ichniowski, 1990).

 Although numerous theories of organization exist, much of the research
 in SHRM has focused primarily on one view, that posited by strategic contin-
 gency theory (Fisher, 1989; Wright & McMahan, 1992). The result has been
 a number of "fit," or "matching," models suggesting that in order to enhance
 performance, organizations should implement human resource management
 policies that support their business unit or organizational strategies (Baird &
 Meshoulam, 1989; Huselid, 1994; Miles & Snow, 1984; Tichy, Fombrum, &
 Devanna, 1982). Although popular, this theory is limited in its ability to
 predict the performance of young companies that quickly change strategies.
 As will be discussed later in this article, its seems implausible that a firm's
 human resource strategy can or should continue to change in order to con-
 tinue matching its business strategy. Therefore, in order to expand both
 the theoretical and empirical work in the field of strategic human resource
 management, we have developed a different theoretical perspective and
 tested hypotheses developed from this theory with a unique sample that
 allowed us to investigate the impact of human resource management issues
 on the ultimate measure of performance, firm survival. The research elabo-
 rates upon the theoretical work conducted by population ecologists to explain
 the role that human resource management might play in the survival and
 performance of a group of firms that were, for the most part, small and
 growing. Such organizations, which have been overlooked by human re-
 source management researchers, are an important part of the economy be-
 cause they are a significant source of new jobs and innovations (Birch, 1987).
 They also provide a unique opportunity to study how SHRM can affect a
 firm in its early stages of development.

 Most of the strategic human resource management research has been

 conducted with cross sections of large, established organizations, while tar-
 geting the practices of their human resource departments. The dominant
 research method involves sending surveys to human resource professionals;
 therefore, the process ultimately results in samples of large firms that have
 human resource departments (Jackson, Schuler, & Rivero, 1989). Even when
 samples are drawn from sources that include smaller and newer organiza-
 tions, such as Compact Disclosure, a database that compiles information
 from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings (e.g., Abowd et al.,
 1990; Huselid, 1995), the research designs used often result in larger, older
 firms being selected for analysis. The process of obtaining survey data to
 measure human resource strategy results in a final selection (because survey
 data are matched with archival data) of only those firms with human resource
 departments (Snell & Dean, 1994). When a human resource department is
 not surveyed (such as in Abowd and colleagues' study), other factors often
 limit the sample to larger firms. For example, Abowd and colleagues coded
 announcements in the Wall Street Journal to capture human resource man-
 agement initiatives, but that publication seldom picks up press releases about
 smaller firms. A few organization-level studies have concentrated on specific
 industries-MacDuffie (1995) studied auto assembly plants, and Arthur

 (1995) researched steel minimills-but the firms studied were also estab-
 lished and older.

 Although previous studies have contributed to understanding macro

 human resource issues, several problems exist when human resource man-
 agement is studied in large, established organizations, and these issues cannot
 be addressed without expanding the research into more diverse samples.
 First, the actions taken by corporate offices (in particular, by headquarters
 human resource departments) might not translate into the behaviors of man-
 agers at the division, business unit, or plant level. For instance, having a
 performance appraisal system or an extensive selection methodology in place
 might not indicate the degree to which employees or management really
 use these programs; it might merely reflect the staffing level of a personnel
 department (it has more people, so it can develop more programs). Thus,
 data from corporate human resource managers might not be tapping the
 underlying construct of interest in this research; instead, it might be measur-
 ing the activity level of human resource departments. In addition, the reliance
 on large, established organizations automatically limits variance in perfor-
 mance because these firms have survived their early years and are, as a result,
 in a better position to continue to survive.

 Smaller, newer organizations present a unique opportunity for studying
 human resource management and perhaps to more adequately address causa-
 tion. As Romanelli noted, "New organizations are notoriously poor at surviv-
 ing their early years" (1989: 369). Thus, samples of small, young firms will
 show more variation in performance measures, including firm survival.
 Newer, smaller businesses do not usually have formal human resource man-
 agement departments; as noted, that is one of the reasons they have not been
 studied in the past (Snell, 1992). However, we think that the "missing"
 department and the application of population ecology provide an opportu-
 nity to establish a different operational definition of the construct underlying
 the strategic human resource management literature. The variable focuses
 on an organization's overall strategic approach toward its employees as evi-
 denced by actions of its top management team rather than on policies imple-
 mented and administered by the human resource department.

 Initial public offering (IPO) firms, which are the focus of this research,

 have not been studied by researchers in strategic human resource manage-
 ment. IPO firms are organizations that offer their stock to the public market
 for the first time; they are moving from private to public ownership. The
 move is not an easy one, and it requires at least a year of effort, particularly
 on the part of a company's top management team to prepare and market the
 company. In addition, the firm undergoes numerous internal changes as it
 prepares to become "professional" and submit to the scrutiny of sharehold-
 ers, investment bankers, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 IPO firms present a unique opportunity to study young, small organiza-
 tions that are undergoing dramatic change. These firms often are considered
 to be more successful than other small organizations because they have
 survived to this stage. However, they still face a risk of failure that is compara-

 ble to the high level encountered by other start-up organizations. Of the
 3,186 companies that went public in the 1980s, with stock listed on the New
 York or American stock exchanges or NASDAQ, only 58 percent were still
 listed by December 31, 1989 (Zeune, 1993). Comparably, a Dunn and Brad-
 street study showed that 53 percent of all failures and bankruptcies of firms
 in 1980 occurred less than five years after the firms' foundings (Romanelli,
 1989). Therefore, even though it may seem that initial public offering firms
 are more successful than other small firms, they still face significant risks
 of failure.

 We used population ecology as a framework for examining the relation-

 ship between human resource management and organizational performance
 within initial public offering firms. Population ecology is particularly useful
 for studying these organizations because it focuses on determinants of organi-
 zational survival, a dependent variable that has received very little attention
 from HRM researchers. According to Abowd, Milkovich, and Hannon, "Re-
 search on the relation between human resource decisions and organizational
 performance appears to have focused most on immediate outcomes (behavior
 and attitudes), less on intermediate outcomes (accounting measures, firm
 health, and economic outcomes), and hardly at all on ultimate outcomes
 such as survival" (1990: 204).

 We applied population ecology to the study of human resource manage-

 ment in order to understand how human resource decisions made at an early
 stage (the time of an IPO) might affect long-term performance (survival after
 five years). Although population ecologists have discussed human resource
 determinants of organizational survival, this aspect of the theory has not
 been adequately developed. Therefore, the first section of this article reviews
 population ecology to explicate its implications for the relationship between
 human resource management and organizational performance. Population
 ecology allowed us to develop hypotheses about a firm's long-term perfor-
 mance; however, it is not helpful in explaining the outcomes of the actual
 initial public offering process. Therefore, we also conducted an exploratory
 analysis of the effect of human resource management on investor reaction
 to firms. The next section describes the findings of a study based on a sample
 of 136 firms that initiated their public offerings in 1988. Finally, we consider
 the ramifications of these results for the field of SHRM.

 POPULATION ECOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

 Wright and McMahan, after reviewing the strategic human resource man-
 agement literature and noting its dependency on contingency-based or strate-
 gic choice models, concluded that "a variety of theoretical models exist in
 the organization theory literature . .. these models may also serve as fertile
 ground for broadening our perspective of the role of human resource manage-
 ment in organization" (1992: 315). Even though they included population
 ecology as one such model, it has not been adequately utilized by researchers
 in the field. Perhaps this omission results from the conclusion of some organi-
 zation theorists that according to population ecology, the role of managers

 is passive or inactive (Astley & Van de Ven, 1983; Singh & Lumsden, 1990).
 Morgan noted that "the population ecology view has been much criticized
 for downplaying the importance of choice of strategic direction for an organi-
 zation" (1986: 68). If managerial actions cannot augment firm performance,
 then human resource management practices, which are implemented by
 managers, would not appear to be important in predicting organizational
 outcomes. Many management scholars seem to have accepted this view;
 however, the conclusion that managers' actions cannot affect firm perfor-
 mance is currently being debated, and some population ecology researchers
 have rejected it (e.g., Amburgey, Kelly, & Barnett, 1992; Haveman, 1992,
 1993). We contend that there is nothing inherent in the theory that implies
 management actions and decisions are not important; in fact, we will show
 that population ecology has implications for understanding how human
 resource management can have an impact on firm survival.

 Population ecology was developed as an alternate view of how organiza-

 tional forms change over time. The dominant paradigm before population
 ecology was introduced focused on the way in which managers and strategic
 choice affect firm performance. Freeman and Hannan commented that they
 "thought it was a mistake to build models of organizational change that rely
 on anthromorphic images of organizations or on heroic images of managers;
 [they] attempted to build a perspective that treats organizations as complex
 systems with strong limitations on flexibility and speed of response" (1989:
 426). Thus, those theorists focused on advancing an alternative theory of
 organizational change, and in doing so they employed populations of organi-
 zations rather than individual corporations as their units of analysis. The
 theory has been used to explain the impact of competition, firm age, environ-
 mental turbulence, and technology on variance in organizational forms and
 survival over time (Astley & Van de Ven, 1983; Hannan & Carroll, 1992).
 Although it may not have been stated, population ecology does have implica-
 tions for the internal management of companies. Discussions of structural
 inertia center on the importance of human capital and the way in which
 processes are managed to produce reliability and accountability, which are
 posited to be determinants of survival (Freeman & Hannan, 1990).

 According to the strategic choice and contingency theory literatures,
 managers can respond to environmental conditions by altering their business
 strategies, and this action should lead to improved performance (Lyles, 1990).
 In the SHRM literature, authors have elaborated upon this idea by suggesting
 that, as a subsequent (or concurrent) step, human resource policies should
 be changed to match the new or altered business strategies (Dyer, 1984;
 Lengnick-Hall & Lengnick-Hall, 1988; Milliman, Von Glinow, & Nathan,
 1991). Strategic human resource management suggests that there is no one
 best way to manage employees but that instead each firm should tailor its
 programs to meet the challenges and needs of its business strategy and envi-
 ronment. In fact, Baird and Meshoulam (1988), who developed a model
 specifying how human resource management strategies should evolve,
 claimed that if a company's human resource department does not make

 timely changes, it will be ineffective. They argued that "if human resource
 activities skip a stage, they will be ineffective. It will be necessary to revisit
 an earlier stage for the unit to regain its effect" (1988: 122). This argument
 means that a human resource department cannot be more "advanced" than
 the rest of a company. Baird and Meshoulam also stated that new leadership
 within human resources is required at each stage of the life cycle. This view
 implies dramatic and frequent changes guided by business strategy and life
 cycle. But new leadership and constant change also put pressure on organiza-
 tions, and it is this type of pressure that, population ecologists suggest, leads
 to disruption and increases the risk of organizational death.

 Population ecologists take a different approach in that they claim too

 many organizational change efforts (such as changing human resource prac-
 tices to match a current environment, business strategy, corporate strategy,
 or life cycle) will have a negative impact on organizational performance and
 survival. At the core of population ecology is the concept of inertia (Hannan &
 Freeman, 1984). Although inertia often conjures up images of stale, immobile
 organizations, the term does not necessarily mean "standing still." Newton's
 first law of physics states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an
 object in motion tends to stay in motion. This overall tendency to stay at
 rest or in motion is called inertia. Webster's dictionary defines inertia as "a
 property of matter by which it remains at rest or in uniform motion in the
 same straight line unless acted upon by some external force." An organization
 that has inertia might be at rest, but it might just as well be moving forward,
 until it is acted upon by something that causes the entire organization to
 move in a different direction. Inertia keeps an organization moving during
 a change, even though the direction has changed. We know that initial public
 offering firms are not at rest because they are entering the public market in
 order to grow; therefore, for IPO firms, inertia is a desirable characteristic
 because it helps them to continue moving forward.

 Population ecology arguments imply that, rather than alter human re-

 source systems to match life cycle or business strategy (as contingency theory
 suggests), organizations should design human resource techniques to
 strengthen structural inertia early in the life cycle, and in this way increase
 their survival chances. Population ecology is applicable to the study of hu-
 man resource management because there is a relationship between HRM
 practices and structural inertia. If human resource management can increase
 inertia, then HRM systems will contribute to the long-term performance and
 survival of organizations.

 Population ecology claims that reliable companies producing collective
 action-people working together toward a common goal-are more likely
 to survive, and the most reliable firms are those with characteristics that
 enhance high structural inertia (Freeman & Hannan, 1990; Hannan & Free-
 man, 1989). We suggest that collective action and structural inertia imply
 the presence of structural cohesion, an employee-generated synergy that
 propels a company forward, and this quality enables firms to respond to
 their environment while still moving forward. High inertia results from a

 variety of internal and external factors. Internal factors include sunk costs,
 high levels of investment in personnel or human capital and technology, and
 political coalitions; external factors include the legal environment, market
 conditions, and the pace of technology change. Although population ecology
 researchers have not focused on the personnel or human capital component,
 there is a theoretical argument for investigating this element.

 A few implications for human resource management can be drawn from

 discussions of the internal pressures that create structural inertia. Hannan
 and Freeman (1977) suggested that investments in personnel, particularly in
 specialized employees, increase inertia. Investments in personnel are usually
 made because a firm's managers think its employees are important to the
 business. Although many initial public offering firms do not have formal
 human resource departments and the types of policies and procedures that
 are implemented by these departments, IPO firms do vary in the degree to
 which they consider employees to be an important part of their business.
 This variance is evidenced by the degree to which they acquire specialized
 personnel and make other investments in employees (training, support sys-
 tems, etc.). Smaller companies rely on high levels of cooperation and flexibil-
 ity from their employees because they are usually understaffed, and they do
 not have excess resources; in order to meet the demands of a changing
 environment, they need to rely on each individual employee to contribute.
 If a company has high inertia as a result of a strong, cohesive workforce, it is
 more likely to be able to marshal those resources to respond to its challenging
 environment.

 Analyses of strategic human resource management have not included a

 variable measuring variance in the degree to which firms consider employees
 important to business. We capture this variance as human resource value
 and suggest that it affects survival chances because it increases structural
 cohesion. In summary, we conclude that companies placing higher value on
 employees early in their development (at the time of an IPO) will improve
 their chances of survival. Employees will reciprocate by placing high value
 on the organization and its goals, thus increasing the company's chances
 of survival.

 Hypothesis 1: Organizations that place more value on em-
 ployees at the time of their initial public offerings will
 increase their survival chances.

 Compensation programs might also affect inertia by encouraging and
 rewarding collective action. Hannan and Freeman (1984) noted that diversity
 of interests among members of an organization and uncertainty about means-
 end relationships lead to a weak political environment that can reduce iner-
 tia. Their reasoning is that these conditions encourage employees to pursue
 separate goals (creating dispersed action and a lack of cohesion), and these
 individual objectives may be in conflict with each other, the overall mission
 of the firm, or both. Much of the literature on individual incentives and team
 bonuses show that these pay programs have similar dysfunctional outcomes

 (for a review, see Gomez-Mejia and Balkin [1992]). Individual incentives
 tend to encourage employees to maximize their own incomes by engaging
 in behaviors that are often inconsistent with the needs of the company.
 Team-based incentives can also create an environment that sets groups in
 competition with each other, leading to lower organizational effectiveness
 (Welbourne & Gomez-Mejia, 1991).

 Pay based on organizational performance, however, links all employees

 to a firm and its mission, thus encouraging collective action and decreased
 competition between individuals and between work teams (Lawler, 1981;
 Milkovich & Newman, 1993; Welbourne & Gomez-Mejia, 1995). Companies
 that implement compensation systems based on organizational performance
 (such as stock options, profit sharing, and the like) will be more likely to
 retain employees and rally these individuals around a common goal (Kruse,
 1993), thus enhancing inertia and structural cohesion. Organization-based
 compensation programs provide employees with a longer-term perspective
 on the business, which should also assist in sustaining the type of inertia
 that can improve long-term survival chances.

 Hypothesis 2: Companies having organization-based com-
 pensation programs at the time of their initial public offer-
 ings will be more likely to survive.

 The role that human resource management can play in strengthening

 inertia and enhancing survival is particularly applicable to companies at the
 initial public offering stage. Population ecology suggests that the internal
 structures in place at times such as the IPO, when firms are past infancy and
 are entering a new stage of growth, will be critical in determining organiza-
 tional chances of survival because these basic structures are not likely to
 change (Aldrich & Marsden, 1988; Hannan & Carroll, 1992). This view seems
 consistent with the conclusions of compensation researchers who have ob-
 served that rewards programs are resistant to change (Gerhart & Milkovich,
 1990; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). Snell and Dean noted that "once in
 place, administrative systems, such as compensation systems, are notoriously
 intractable" (1994: 1118).

 SHORT-TERM IPO PERFORMANCE

 Population ecology provides little direction for predicting how investors

 will react to firms with high levels of human resource value and organization-
 based rewards. However, given that the goal of an initial public offering is
 to raise cash for the company and that the amount of cash raised is maximized
 by obtaining a high stock price, it seems useful to examine the impact of the
 human resource variables on initial public offerings.

 This issue is particularly interesting because the way in which initial stock
 prices are set is not well understood. Given the relatively short operating his-
 tory of IPO firms, it may be difficult to judge their future value (Altman, 1988;
 Wat, 1983). Overall, a stock price is set through a series of negotiations between
 an underwriter and a company. The process has been called more of an art than

 a science (Hofmeister, 1987: 53), and it has been suggested that mathematical
 models and accounting models are "rarely more than a portion of the ingredi-
 ents which make up the determination of final price" (Weaver, 1969: 33). In-
 deed, several prospectuses we examined for this research even stated "price
 determined by negotiations between the company and the representatives of
 the underwriters and bears no relation to the assets, earnings, or book value,
 or any other established criterion of the value of the company."'

 Even though the process might not be well understood, the underwriters

 and companies have a significant amount of information with which to make
 a pricing decision. Underwriters, lawyers, and accountants are all involved
 in evaluating a company before finalizing its prospectus. Prior to the actual
 pricing date, the company conducts what is called a road show, a tour
 consisting of a series of group meetings and one-on-one sessions in which
 the management team attempts to sell the firm to large institutional investors.
 Investors then make a buy decision based on both the prospectus and the
 information obtained in these meetings, and this decision is communicated
 to the underwriters before the stock price is finalized. Thus, the underwriters
 also use expected investor reaction obtained through the road show to help
 determine final stock price.

 Therefore, even though there might not be sufficient theory or research

 on how IPO firms are priced, the decision seems to be one that is made in
 light of a considerable amount of facts about the firms and the probable
 market reaction to them. The question that this research addressed is whether
 human-resource-related data are used as part of the pricing decision, and if
 so, in what way potential investors evaluate that information.

 METHODS

 The target population for the study was companies that were preparing
 to move into a new stage of growth and needed an infusion of cash. Initial
 public offering firms have been neglected in the human resource management
 literature, but they represent an important sector of the economy. Successful
 IPO firms typically are smaller, rapidly growing companies that have the
 potential to create large numbers of jobs and introduce new tech-
 nologies (Birch, 1987). Although these firms must offer enough potential to
 attract investors, they usually have short operating histories and present
 higher risks than larger, more established firms (Beatty & Zajac, 1994).

 Sample

 The sample used for this study contains 136 nonfinancial companies

 that made their initial public offerings in 1988. A total of about 250 firms
 filed securities registrations with the SEC to conduct an IPO in that year,
 and we pared the list down to 170 by deleting those that were listed as closed-

 1 The prospectus is a document provided to the SEC prior to a public offering and is also

 circulated by the underwriters to assess demand for a firm's stock.

 end funds or real estate investment trusts and other firms not producing a
 good or service. Upon receiving the 170 prospectuses, we eliminated addi-
 tional firms that produced no good or service. The year 1988 was chosen
 because it was five years before 1993, the year in which we began the research.
 Prior studies have shown that about 50 percent of IPO firms are in business
 five years after their initial offerings. Thus, collecting five years of follow-
 up data permitted a comparison between survivors and nonsurvivors.

 Data were gathered from the prospectus of each firm. The SEC requires
 firms to follow strict guidelines in the format of prospectuses. The document
 itself is usually written by members of a firm's management team and then
 scrutinized by lawyers and accountants.

 Although the potential for positive bias exists in the prospectus, the firm
 is liable for any information that might mislead investors (O'Flaherty, 1984).
 The amended Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 sets the requirements for
 prospectuses, thus assuring consistency in the type of information that is
 included in the documents. The SEC also requires that a prospectus be
 accurate to the best knowledge of management. Given this requirement and
 the fact that the SEC requires a tremendous amount of detail regarding com-
 pany operations, prospectuses are a useful data source (Marino, Castaldi, &
 Dollinger, 1989).

 Data Collection and Coding

 Prospectuses from 1988 are not readily available in public sources; there-
 fore, copies were obtained from Compact Disclosure. We were able to acquire
 the prospectuses for the companies that initiated an initial public offering
 during 1988. Data were coded using a two-step process incorporating two
 coders who were unaware of the survival status of the companies as they
 coded.

 First, a five-page summary of each prospectus was constructed. Given

 the fact that the prospectus is not a traditional data source, this first step
 allowed for careful reading of each document, cross-checking at the second
 stage of coding, and notation of any unusual firm characteristics. The second
 step involved numerically coding each five-page summary for specific infor-
 mation. Researchers cross-coded a sample of companies (two people coded
 the same prospectus), and they switched companies for the second stage of
 coding. Any questions about codes were resolved through group consensus,
 which involved meetings with the coders and an additional researcher.

 Sample Characteristics

 The average firm incorporated in 1981, although half incorporated in
 1985 or later. Half the firms employed fewer than 110 workers; however, 20
 percent had 700 or more employees. On average, the firms had six executive
 officers and three outside directors. The businesses were located throughout
 the United States but were most heavily concentrated in the Pacific states
 and were in numerous industries, ranging from food service retailing to

 1993, 81 firms survived.

 Independent Variables

 Human resource value. Testing Hypothesis 1 required a measure of
 human resource value. This variable attempts to assess the degree to which
 a company values employees as a specialized asset. Given that the prospectus
 describes a company's competitive advantages, it is a useful source for under-
 standing how the firm values its employees. If employees are considered to
 be a source of competitive advantage, a firm's strategy, mission statement,
 and operating practices should reflect that value. We attempted to capture
 human resource value by coding a variety of indicators found throughout
 the prospectuses.

 This measure was computed as the sum of ratings on several items coded
 1 if the firm engaged in the practice and as 0 if not. The items included the
 following: (1) The company's strategy and mission statements cited employ-
 ees as a competitive advantage. (2) A training program for employees was
 mentioned, indicating allocation of resources that resulted in employees
 obtaining company-specific education. (3) An officer with responsibility for
 human resource management was present. (4) Full-time employees, rather
 than temporary or contract employees, were regularly used. Companies that
 used temporary workers were coded as 0, which lowered their overall score
 on HR value, and companies using full-time, permanent employees were
 coded 1. (5) The SEC requires employers to rate their employee relations
 climate. Three codes were used for this item: 0 for poor or satisfactory rela-
 tions, 1 for good relations, and 2 for excellent relations with employees.

 Values on the summed overall HR value variable ranged from 0 to 6,

 with a mean of 2.57 and standard deviation of 1.15. We were not able to
 calculate statistics for internal reliability because the overall measure is
 summated. Basically, this scale indicates the degree to which a company
 values its employees as evidenced by the pervasiveness of various indicators
 of human resource value. Table 2 gives descriptive statistics for the scale
 items.

 Organization-based rewards. Hypothesis 2 focuses on the use of rewards

 based on organizational performance. Employers can design organization-
 based compensation systems (such as stock options and profit sharing) for
 all employees or for only management teams; therefore, we coded the exis-
 tence of rewards programs for both populations. The measure was computed
 by adding responses to the following dummy indicators: stock options for
 all employees, stock options for key employees and management, profit shar-
 ing for all employees, profit sharing for key employees and management,
 and other forms of group-based incentives (gainsharing, customized rewards)
 for all employees or for management. Values ranged from 0 to 5, with a mean
 of 1.79 and a standard deviation of 1.17 (see Table 2 for item means).

 a Because we excluded financial companies, we collapsed the financial category into the

 b Nine firms are located in the Mountain states.

 Dependent Variables

 The hypotheses predict that firms valuing their employees and using re-
 wards based on organizational criteria will improve their survival chances. In
 addition, we were interested in understanding the impact of these variables
 on the initial public offering. Three different dependent variables were used
 to measure firm performance and survival. Two measures assess IPO financial
 performance, and the third measures long-term performance. Because firms
 making their initial public offerings are so young, we could not employ many
 of the measures of firm performance used in prior strategic human resource
 management research, such as productivity (Kruse, 1993; MacDuffie, 1995),
 abnormal returns (Abowd et al., 1990), and ratio data such as return on assets
 (Huselid, 1995). IPO firms are new to the stock market, often lack productivity
 data (it is not available, or no product is produced yet, or both), and zero would
 have to be used for many of the ratio measures of performance as many of these
 firms have no sales (Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990).

 Perceived market potential. The absolute stock price at the time of IPO,
 while important, can be misleading in that it fails to account for the worth
 of firm assets. A high-tech start-up may have enormous potential, but it is
 unlikely to garner a high stock price because it will have very few assets.
 Conversely, a steel mill may command a high stock price, but much of that
 value may lie in equipment. In order to control for assets, we used the
 percentage of the share price that was the price premium in the analysis

 (Rasheed & Datta, 1994). The premium is the amount of the stock price that
 is above and beyond the book value, and it represents the perceived potential
 value of a firm.

 For example, consider two companies selling their stock at $10.00 per

 share. Firm X has a book value of $2.00, and firm Y has a book value of
 $6.00. Firm X is a more risky investment, because if it goes bankrupt, its
 assets are only worth $2.00, but those of firm Y are worth $6.00. For firm X
 and firm Y to command equivalent stock prices, an investor must believe
 that firm X has the potential to do very well. The difference between the
 stock price and the book value is called the dilution value, since it represents
 a dilution to investors purchasing the stock. However, from the company's
 perspective, it is a price premium. The company attempts to maximize this
 premium in its offering, and investors wish to minimize the premium so
 that their investments are more secure. The price premium is a useful measure
 of performance, since it measures the perceived potential of the firm
 (Rasheed & Datta, 1994). To standardize this premium across all firms, we
 divided it by the total share price, to obtain the percent premium. The

 calculation was as follows: percent price premium = (stock price - book
 value)/stock price.

 Tobin's Q. We also calculated Tobin's Q, a more traditional measure of

 the perceived potential of a firm, as initial stock price over book value. By
 using initial stock price, we measured the reaction of the initial investors
 (primarily institutional investors) to a firm.2 Although book value is historic,
 and therefore not an exact approximation of replacement cost (which is
 intended in the calculation of Tobin's Q), authors have recommended the
 stock price to book ratio as a measure of investor reaction to a firm (Smirlock,
 Gilligan, & Marshall, 1984). Tobin's Q therefore indicates how potential
 investors value the firm; the higher the ratio, the more it is valued (Davis,
 1991; Davis & Stout, 1990). The calculation is as follows: Tobin's Q = (stock
 price/book value).

 Survival. A third dependent variable, testing the population ecology

 hypotheses and reflecting long-term performance, was survival. All firms
 still in business at year-end 1993 were coded as survivors. Survival status
 is not easily determined, so we took several steps to assure correct identifica-
 tion of survivors.

 First, we searched an on-line database of current public firms to find
 current information on the companies. Supplemental information was gath-
 ered from Compact Disclosure, through which we were able to identify many
 active and inactive companies. The Directory of Obsolete Securities (1994)
 was also searched to identify bankrupties, name changes, recapitalizations,
 and mergers. In addition, we made phone calls to the numbers provided in
 the prospectuses. Fourteen firms (10%) had changed their names between
 the time of their initial public offering and 1993, and we called these firms
 to find out whether the name changes were cosmetic, or whether the busi-
 nesses had undergone other major transformations. Merged firms were con-
 sidered to be nonsurvivors under the logic that the firm coded in 1988 had
 been joined to another management and organizational culture (Aldrich &
 Marsden, 1988; Kalleberg & Leicht, 1991). In addition, we tracked the stock
 prices of the mergers and determined that seven out of eight merged firms
 had stock prices that decreased prior to the merger; therefore, the trend in
 this sample seemed to be that mergers reflected nonsurvival rather than
 survival. Overall, 81 companies, or 59.6 percent of the sample, were coded
 as survivors.

 Control Variables

 Several control variables, selected on the basis of reviews of both the

 strategic human resource management and initial public offering literatures

 2 A more conventional approach might be to use seven-day stock price, which measures
 market reaction after a company is traded. However, the focus of this research was on the
 reaction of individuals who were familiar with a firm; therefore, we used initial price. However,
 seven-day and initial stock price are strongly related, with a correlation of .96. The correlation
 between Tobin's Q calculated with initial price and Tobin's Q calculated with seven-day price
 is .90. Both are significant at the p < .001 level.

 (e.g., Beatty & Zajac, 1994; Huselid, 1995) were used in the analysis. The
 total number of employees, logged to correct for skewness, was included as
 a measure of size. We added net profit per share at the time of the IPO as a
 performance measure, using net profit because many firms had net losses
 reported, which indicated variance in performance. Other measures of perfor-
 mance, such as sales, presented the problem of zero sales for many organiza-
 tions in the sample. A dichotomous measure coded 1 for a service industry
 and 0 for manufacturing was used to control for industry. This dichotomous
 code was used in the reported analyses; however, we also conducted analyses
 using dummy variables for a more detailed industry categorization (the six
 Small Business Administration categories listed in Table 1), and the results
 appear in notes to the tables. We also included geographic area as a control;
 again, the results appear in notes to the tables. A total of seven geographic
 areas were included, with the Northeast being the omitted category (see Table
 1). A final control variable indicated the level of a firm's risk. Each prospectus
 contains a section listing all risk factors faced by the firm, which must be
 disclosed to meet the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commis-
 sion. Prior research on initial public offering firms has shown that this mea-
 sure is a useful way to code risk (Beatty & Zajac, 1994; Rasheed & Datta, 1994).
 The presence of the following risk factors were included in this measure:
 technological obsolescence, new product, few or limited products, low num-
 ber of years in operation, inexperienced management, technical risk, season-
 ality, customer dependence, supplier dependence, inexperienced underwrit-
 ers, competition, legal proceedings against company, liability, and
 government regulation. The summated risk measure ran from 1 to 11, with
 a mean of 4.18 and a standard deviation of 1.80. Table 3 gives correlations,
 means, and standard deviations for all of the dependent variables and control
 variables. Company age was significantly correlated with size, risk, and profit
 per share, so it was not included as a control in the analyses reported.
 However, we conducted a separate analysis with age included as a control
 (both with and without the expanded list of industry variables), and the
 results appear in notes to the tables.

 RESULTS

 As Table 3 indicates, human resource value is positively related to sur-

 vival, and organization-based rewards is negatively related to measures of
 initial stock performance and positively related to survival five years after
 an initial public offering.
 Dependent Variables

 Percent price premium. Table 4 shows the regression analysis results

 for percent price premium. The R2 for the full model is 15, which is significant
 at the .07 level. HR value has no effect on price premium; however, the
 rewards variable has a negative and significant (at the .05 level) impact on
 price premium. This model suggests that investors ignore information related
 to the degree to which firms value their employees, but they react negatively

 b The analysis was run with an expanded list of SIC codes (those reported in the Small

 Business Administration publications). None of the SIC codes were significant, and the pattern
 of results did not change. For percent price premium, the overall R2 for that equation was .16
 (not significant). The coefficient for HR value was 1.75, and for rewards it was -5.01 (significant
 at the .02 level). The risk variable was still significant at the .05 level, and the coefficient was
 3.11. For Tobin's Q, the overall R2 for the expanded equation was .19 (significant at the .10

 A second analysis was run including company age as a control. Age was not significant,

 and the rewards variable continued to be significant.

 The regression with Tobin's Q calculated with seven-day stock price was conducted with

 data from 82 firms because seven-day price was not available for the entire sample. The R2 for
 the equation is .19, F = 1.32. The regression coefficient for HR value is -0.15 with a standard

 if firms use compensation to link pay to organizational performance. The
 geographic area codes had a significant effect on price premium. In addition,
 the risk factor had a positive impact on price premium.

 Tobin's Q. Table 4 also shows results of the analysis with Tobin's Q as
 the dependent variable. The results are similar to those for price premium
 in that human resource value had no impact on performance, but the rewards
 variable had a significant (at the .03 level) and negative impact. This pattern
 should not be surprising as the two measures are definitionally related; both
 take stock price and book value into consideration but arrange the terms
 differently. The geographic variables continued to affect performance; how-
 ever, in this analysis risk had no significant effect, and net profit per share
 had a positive impact. In addition, size had a negative effect.3

 Survival. The hypotheses state that companies with higher inertia are
 more likely to survive, and this research examines the degree to which human
 resource value and organization-based rewards, as indicators of inertia, con-
 tribute to a firm's survival. We tested the hypotheses by determining whether
 there were differences in HR value and rewards between the two groups,
 survivors and nonsurvivors. To do this, we conducted a multivariate analysis
 of variance (MANOVA).

 The results indicate that there is a significant difference between the

 survivors and nonsurvivors on the two variables of interest (Wilks's lambda
 = .88, F = 8.70), and the subsequent univariate analyses show that the largest
 difference (at the .001 significant level) lies in the rewards variable. The
 mean for the survivors was 2.10, and the mean for the nonsurvivors was
 1.34 (p < .01). The mean for the human resource value variable for survivors
 was 2.74, and the mean for the nonsurvivors was 2.30 (p < .10).

 Table 5 presents the results of a logistic regression analysis. Logistic
 regression was used because the dependent variable consists of only two
 values (Allison, 1984; Yamaguchi, 1991). The overall model is significant at
 the .01 level, and the classification table indicates that the model predicts
 survival at a 71 percent accuracy level. The only variables significant at the
 .05 or less level are human resource value and rewards, and both variables
 predict survival in a positive direction. Net profit per share has a positive
 and significant impact on survival (at the .10 level).

 In order to understand the degree to which these two variables are
 important for survival, we next assessed the practical implications of the
 two variables on the probability of a firm's surviving until 1993. As the
 logistic regression model is nonlinear, the magnitude of the effect of human
 resource variables on survival differs conditionally across levels of values
 and rewards. Still, the probability of survival can be estimated at several
 critical values in order to gain a general understanding of these effects. The

 3 We ran the same regression equation using Tobin's Q calculated with seven-day stock

 price rather than initial stock price; results are noted in Table 4, footnote b.

 transformation from the logistic estimator into the probability of survival is
 as follows:

 P(survival) = exp(3kXk)
 1 + exp(2f3kXk)'

 where /3 is a parameter for the set of k + 1 parameters estimated in the
 logistic regression model for the k predictors Xi. . . Xk plus a constant term
 (Demaris, 1992).

 With all variables held at the mean, the conditional probability of surviv-

 ing until 1993 is .70. For a firm with a high level of human resource value
 (one standard deviation above the mean), the probability of firm survival
 increases to .79. For a firm whose human resource value is low (one standard
 deviation below the mean), the probability of survival drops to .60.

 The effect of rewards on the chance of survival is even more dramatic.

 With all other variables held at the mean, a firm with a high level of employee
 rewards (one standard deviation above the mean) increases its chance of
 survival from the average of .70 to .87. A firm with a low level of employee

 rewards (one standard deviation below the mean) decreases its chance of
 survival from .70 to .45.

 Holding everything else constant, a firm that has a high level of human
 resource value and a high level of organization-based employee rewards
 boosts its chances of survival to .92. This represents a gain of .22 over the
 average firm. When both human resource value and employee rewards are
 at a low level, the chance of firm survival decreases to .34, a level .36 lower
 than a firm with average scores on the human resource indicators has. Overall,
 both the level of human resource value and the level of organization-based
 employee rewards can greatly increase firm survival, although the effect of
 employee rewards is the stronger.
 Contingency Models

 We also tested an internal contingency approach to firm survival that
 is not included in the hypotheses. Contingency theory might lead to the
 hypothesis that a match between HR value (which represents a company's
 overall human resource strategy) and firm-based employee rewards should
 positively affect performance and survival. The implication is that companies
 placing low value on employees (this can be an intended or unintended
 strategy) should not use company resources to retain or reward these employ-
 ees. In contrast, according to population ecology it is not the match that is
 important; rather, the increased levels of value and the greater presence of
 organization-based rewards affect performance. We tested the interaction
 between value and rewards by computing the models in Tables 4 and 5 with
 interaction terms, and those terms were nonsignificant in all cases.

 In addition, contingency theory and prior strategic human resource man-
 agement research suggest that the following interactions, which were tested
 in the survival analysis, might be significant: (1) risk and employee value,
 (2) risk and rewards, (3) size and employee value, (4) size and rewards,
 (5) profitability and employee value, (6) profitability and rewards. All of the
 possible interaction effects were included in six separate regression analyses,
 and none were significant. However, the employee value and rewards vari-
 ables continued to have main effects on survival when the interaction terms
 were included.

 DISCUSSION

 The results provide initial support for extending population ecology to

 the study of human resource management. The survival analysis indicates
 that firms using organization-based compensation programs and valuing their
 employees are more likely to survive. However, although valuing employees
 is a neutral signal to investors, compensation programs that link employee
 wages to the success of an organization have a strong and negative effect.
 The market seems to react negatively to firms using their capital for employee
 rewards programs.4 It may be that investors perceive human resource prac-

 4 We divided the rewards variable into two components (management rewards and employee
 rewards) to see if one component was dominant in predicting performance. The results indicate

 tices that transfer money from the company to employees negatively; this
 has been evidenced in other studies of compensation (Abowd et al., 1990;
 Kruse, 1993).

 To supplement the findings of the study, we contacted a number of
 survivors and conducted structured telephone interviews. The telephone
 interviews were done with the most senior member (either CEO or vice
 president) of a company's management team who had been with the company
 since the IPO. A total of 40 individuals participated. Respondents were asked
 to rate a number of items according to their degree of importance to the
 company's performance since the IPO. Ratings could range from 1, "not at
 all important," to 5, "very important." These items were obtained from a re-
 view of the organizational survival literature. The Appendix lists the items, and
 Table 6 gives descriptive statistics, correlations, and reliabilities for variables.
 It is interesting to note that of the six categories that were rated by these

 executives, the most important, in their opinion, was the top management
 team, and the least important was employee rewards (see Table 6). At the
 same time, when we asked these executives if there was anything about the
 way that they handled their employees that particularly helped or hurt them,
 we received responses like these: "Employee stock option plan helped a lot,"
 "ESOP for all employees," "Bonus program based on pretax profitability; it
 gave employees the incentive to cooperate and do the right thing for the
 company," "Important to have all employees as stockholders when they join
 through the incentive stock option plan," "ESOP at time of offering, so
 employees were able to participate in success of offering; this was a strong
 help in boosting morale," "ESOP and broad-based profit sharing from top to
 bottom," "ESOP helped to create feeling that IPO was a culmination of all
 employees' efforts-employees were motivated to join a common cause for
 the common good-not management intimidation but rather making them
 feel like they wanted to be part of the IPO."

 Although executives ranked employee rewards as less important than
 other factors, they did acknowledge the importance of stock participation

 programs. Their comments suggest that stock ownership might contribute
 toward the development of a cohesive workforce whose members can work
 together through the turbulence of the public offering period. The overall
 results of this study imply that both investors and management may underrate
 the significance of organization-based compensation programs. In fact, inves-
 tors seem to respond negatively to a factor that actually has a positive impact
 on survival chances.

 The population ecology model is particularly useful for the study of
 small, growing firms, but how it can be applied to larger, established corpora-
 tions remains an unanswered question. Our definition of inertia indicates
 that organizations with high inertia can be either "at rest" or "in uniform
 motion" but that they will move when acted upon by an external force. We
 know that initial public offering firms are not at rest (the IPO process itself
 is a significant change) and, therefore, high-inertia IPO firms would appear
 to be in uniform motion. We cannot make the same assumption for other
 populations, in particular for large businesses. In fact, research could be
 designed to establish the point at which inertia becomes harmful, rather than
 helpful, to organizations.

 However, a large firm, whether at rest or in motion, is still less likely to
 respond to external forces simply because of its size. When it does respond,
 its size will make a change process more difficult to complete. Large masses,
 whether at rest or in motion, are more difficult to move than small ones.
 How does a large firm retain its ability to respond to change? A more compre-
 hensive view of the role of inertia in organizations might imply that large
 organizations should not attempt to sustain inertia at the corporate level
 because it reduces their ability to transform when change is necessary. How-
 ever, these firms might still benefit from inertia within their business units
 (versus at the corporate level). Therefore, the theoretical argument might not
 be whether inertia is good or bad for large firms, but where inertia should
 be enhanced (corporate or business-unit level). Human resource policies
 might be best when supporting high inertia at the division or business-
 unit level.

 If population ecology is a viable perspective for evaluating the ability
 of human resource management systems to affect corporate performance, it
 might also suggest a less complex process than that posed by the strategic
 management literature. According to the work in SHRM, all the components
 of human resource management (e.g., training, benefits, compensation, selec-
 tion, and so forth) must be aligned to support one coherent human resource
 strategy, and this overall strategy should be designed to enhance a corpora-
 tion's business strategy (Gerhart, Trevor, & Graham, 1995; Jackson et al., 1989;
 Schuler, 1987). The process of aligning all of the various human resource
 functional areas is extremely complex. In addition, the human resource de-
 partment is responsible for design and administration, but management car-
 ries out the policies and procedures. This system leaves considerable room
 for variance in how human resource programs are actually implemented.
 Given the unreasonableness of coordinating this type of strategic human

 resource agenda, population ecology might offer a more concise, realistic
 method for diagnosing the impact of HR programs on organizational perfor-
 mance.

 LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

 Several limitations of this research study should be taken into consider-

 ation when interpreting the findings. First, the sample of IPO companies
 studied here might not be representative of all firms at this stage. In fact, it
 could be argued that this particular sample is made up of companies with
 greater chances of survival because the firms making initial public offerings
 in 1988 were somewhat affected by the stock market crash of 1987, which
 made investors more cautious. As mentioned earlier, there is also a possibility
 of positive bias in the reporting of data in the prospectuses. In addition, the
 prospectus-coding process-which has been generally referred to as "cruel
 and unusual punishment" (Marino et al., 1989)-could also have been prone
 to errors in interpretation, even though we took measures to minimize
 such problems.

 Additional work on the measurement of human resource value needs

 to be conducted. The prospectuses provided a useful data source; however,
 their primary audience is the investment community, and prospectuses are
 the documents that provide information to investors. Therefore, it is possible
 that some of the human resource information (such as indications of how
 important employees were to a firm's overall strategy) communicated a mes-
 sage that was not based on actual events. It would be useful to study the
 degree to which the signal correlates with the actual behavior and how
 both affect firm performance (in terms of profit, productivity, stock price,
 sales, etc.).

 Research should continue within two domains. The first involves more

 extensive work in smaller firms like our initial public offering sample, and
 the second requires testing these hypotheses in larger, more established
 businesses. Additional research should also consider changes in human re-
 source programs occurring after initial public offerings. This type of research
 would allow a further test of the population ecology model because certain
 changes in human resource practices should result in decreased inertia and
 thus lead to negative impacts on organizational performance. This view is
 in contrast with the contingency theory perspective, according to which
 changes made to meet environmental demands and business strategy should
 improve performance. It would also be useful to track the performance of
 these companies in order to understand key success factors and events that
 led to organizational death. In addition, research that investigates the impact
 of human resource issues prior to an IPO would provide additional evidence
 of its role during early development stages. If our IPO sample is biased in
 that it consists of companies that were more likely to succeed than other
 firms, then the impact of the two human resource variables might actually
 be understated in this research.

 Future studies should ideally contrast the two organizational perspec-
 tives (population ecology and contingency theory) in both large and small
 firms to determine whether early human resource programs and subsequent
 changes in human resource practices enhance or deter organizational perfor-
 mance and survival. Although the population ecology perspective was sup-
 ported in this study, it is unclear whether this support is only applicable to
 smaller, newer organizations such as IPO companies. Kruse (1993), who
 conducted a study of profit sharing and firm performance, found that profit
 sharing had a stronger effect on performance in smaller firms (fewer than
 775 employees); however, he also found a strong effect in a subgroup of
 organizations that consisted of the largest organizations (17,000 or more
 employees). Additional research is needed to determine if firm size and
 type are important in explaining whether the population ecology or the
 contingency theory model is more useful for understanding firm perfor-
 mance.

 It is possible that inertia-inducing human resource management prac-

 tices are only important for long-term measures of performance, such as
 survival. Therefore, additional SHRM research needs to include not only
 immediate and short-term outcomes, but also long-term measures of perfor-
 mance.

 SUMMARY

 In this research, we have expanded the field of strategic human resource
 management by providing an analysis based on population ecology and by
 studying a sample and a dependent variable that have been neglected in
 the past. The research also augmented the population ecology literature by
 contributing toward a better-developed understanding of the role of human
 capital in the long-term survival of organizations. The findings should be of
 interest to investors who might want to reconsider their methods of evaluat-
 ing initial public offerings and to owners of smaller businesses who want to
 expand their operations. In addition, the results have some implications for
 large organizations.

 In today's environment, middle management jobs are being eliminated,

 and employees are being told that there is no job security. A new employee
 contract that features tangential relationships with employers and willing-
 ness to leave an organization at a moment's notice is being promoted in the
 academic and business literatures. If corporations, both large and small,
 adhere to this advice, it seems that they might be creating a structure with
 low inertia that could ultimately contribute to poor performance and perhaps
 their own demise. The role of inertia or structural cohesion within organiza-
 tions deserves considerable research. In addition, the impact that human
 resources can have on strengthening and sustaining cohesion should receive
 more attention.
