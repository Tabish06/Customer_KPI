The Economic Value of Corporate Eco-Efficiency 

 
 
 
 
 

Abstract 
This  study  adds  new  insights  to  the  long-running  corporate  environmental-financial 
performance debate by focusing on the concept of eco-efficiency. Using a new database 
of  eco-efficiency  ratings,  we  analyze  the  relation  between  eco-efficiency  and  financial 
performance  from  1997  to  2004.  We  report  that  eco-efficiency  relates  positively  to 
operating performance and market value. Moreover, our results suggest that the market’s 
valuation of environmental performance has been time variant, which may indicate that 
the market incorporates environmental information with a drift. Although environmental 
leaders initially did not sell at a premium relative to laggards, the valuation differential 
increased significantly over time. Our results have implications for company managers, 
who evidently do not have to overcome a tradeoff between eco-efficiency and financial 
performance,  and  for  investors,  who  can  exploit  environmental  information  for 
investment decisions.

1. Introduction 
Fuelled  by  widely  reported  corporate  environmental  and  social  scandals,  managers  and 
shareholders  are  now  showing  heightened  interest  in  the  concept  of  corporate  social 
responsibility  (CSR).  Some  of  the  world’s  largest  institutional  asset  managers,  for  example, 
those  at  CalPERS  in  the  U.S.,  Universities  Superannuation  Scheme  in  the  U.K.,  ABP  and 
PGGM in the Netherlands, and AP7 in Sweden, are publicly demonstrating their commitment 
to investing in companies that are deemed socially, morally, and environmentally responsible.  
In  addition,  several  governmental  organizations  are  considering  the  introduction  of 
corporate  reporting  standards  designed  to  accelerate  these  developments.  For  instance,  an 
amendment to the 1995 Pension Act in the U.K., which was created in 2000, requires pension 
funds to disclose how they consider social and environmental issues. 

In  spite  of  greater  acceptance  of  corporate  social  responsibility  principles,  there  is  a 
long-running debate on whether managers should incorporate CSR policies into their tactical 
and strategic decisions. One intriguing question has been the source of this great controversy: 
Can a firm do well while doing good? Most skeptics believe CSR is a vague construct that 
requires organizations to raise operating costs and to give up shareholder wealth (e.g., Walley 
and Whitehead, 1994). In contrast, scholars such as Fombrun et al. (2000), Porter and van der 
Linde (1995), and Spicer (1978) posit that corporate social responsibility initiatives can lead to 
reputational advantages, improvements in investors’ trust in the company, more efficient use of 
resources, and new market opportunities, all of which could ultimately be perceived positively 
by capital markets.  

Corporate  environmental  performance  is  considered  an  important  component  of  the 
CSR  construct,  and  its  potential  usefulness  as  a  forward-looking  measure  of  firm  financial 
performance  has  gained  acceptance,  both  in  the  literature  and  in  practice.  Although  the 
assessment of the CSR-financial performance relationship relies heavily on qualitative data and 
subjective interpretation, the financial impact of environmental governance is easier to assess a 
priori,  particularly  now  that  the  law  punishes  negative  environmental  performance  with 
concrete  financial  penalties  more  than  ever  before.  For  example,  15  years  after  the  widely 
reported  Exxon  Valdez  oil  spill  drama  in  Alaska,  a  federal  judge  recently  imposed  punitive 
damages of more than $4 billion on the Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

However,  several  scholars  have  stressed  that  the  financial  information  content  of 
environmental  performance  is  not  evident  by  itself.  Among  others,  Hart  and  Ahuja  (1996), 
King and Lenox (2002), and Russo and Fouts (1997) emphasize that companies can display

environmental awareness through “end-of-pipe” pollution control, where companies clean up 
emissions  subsequent  to  the  production  process,  but  that  proactive  pollution  prevention 
techniques embedded in the firm’s production processes are more likely to increase operating 
efficiency and profitability.  

3

Building  on  these  assertions,  we  focus  on  the  concept  of  corporate  eco-efficiency,  a 
concept that reflects the environmental governance of the firm beyond that which is indicated 
by  elementary  environmental  compliance  and  pollution  control  policies.  Broadly,  we  can 
define eco-efficiency as creating more value with fewer environmental resources resulting in 
less environmental impact (for example, less pollution or natural resource exhaustion).   

Using  a  comprehensive  database  of  firm-level  eco-efficiency  scores  produced  by 
Innovest  Strategic  Value  Advisors,  we  examine  the  relationship  between  corporate  eco-
efficiency and financial performance over the period 1997 to 2004. The eco-efficiency data we 
use are made available on a monthly basis, allowing us to exploit statistical power. While the 
eco-efficiency scores we study are based on multidimensional research and are now monitored 
by  some  of  the  world’s  largest  institutional  investors,  the  data  have  not  yet  received  much 
attention in the empirical literature.  

By  means  of  an  accounting-based  and  a  market-based  measure,  we  capture  different 
ways in which eco-efficiency influences financial performance. We use return on assets (ROA) 
which represents operating performance and profitability, and Tobin’s q (Q), which proxies for 
a company’s valuation. Q and ROA have several aspects in common but also differ in some 
important respects. ROA is based on firms’ contemporaneous income, whereas Tobin’s q is a 
forward-looking measure that reflects the intangible value investors assign to a company. Since 
eco-efficiency  is  associated  with  both,  tangible  and  intangible  benefits,  discrepancies  might 
occur between its relation to ROA and Q.  

The  intangible  nature  of  the  benefits  of  eco-efficiency  makes  the  task  of  valuing 
environmental governance complicated. Recent investment literature offers evidence that eco-
efficiency is value-relevant but is incorporated slowly into a company’s stock price. Derwall et 
al.  (2005)  compose  two  equity  portfolios  of  stocks  sorted  on  the  eco-efficiency  scores  and 
assess their performance using elaborate performance attribution models. Their results suggest 
that  companies  labeled  the  most  eco-efficient  significantly  outperformed  their  least  eco-
efficient counterparts by approximately 6 percent per annum over the period 1995-2003 after 
controlling for differences in risk, investment style and sector exposure. Their evidence seems 
to contradict the widely held view that assets are priced efficiently. The abnormal returns could

be explained by a period of adjustment, where stocks of eco-efficient companies are initially 
undervalued  and  undergo  a  positive  price  correction  subsequently.  Accordingly,  the  upward 
trend in firm valuation generates anomalously high returns.

The Derwall et al. (2005) results have interesting research implications suggesting that 
the  relation  between  environmental  governance  and  firm  valuation  should  be  studied  in  a 
multi-period  cross-sectional  framework.  If  stock  prices  did  not  accurately  incorporate 
environmental  information  then  studies  on  the  market  valuation  of  corporate  environmental 
management  that  implicitly  assume  market  efficiency  may  have  been  time-specific  and 
difficult  to  generalize.  To  our  knowledge,  this  study  is  the  first  to  investigate  whether  the 
market’s valuation of environmental performance has strengthened over time by using a unique 
longitudinal sample of corporate eco-efficiency scores. We adopt a research design that allows 
for an exploration into both static and dynamic empirical relationships. 

The paper is organized as follows. First, in the next section, we give an overview of 
prior related research, taking into consideration the financial variables of interest to this paper. 
This  section  also  notes  several  limitations  encountered  in  the  literature  and  highlights  the 
contribution of this study. Second, we outline several theoretical lines of reasoning pertaining 
to the link between corporate social (environmental) performance and financial performance. 
Third,  we  describe  the  database  used  for  measuring  corporate  eco-efficiency.  Finally,  we 
discuss the empirical analysis and the results of our study.  
 
2. Literature Overview 
Researchers have long sought empirical evidence on the environmental-financial performance 
link.  However,  studies  on  CSR  are  well  documented,  but  not  well  structured.  Griffin  and 
Mahon  (1997)  and  Ullman  (1985),  among  others,  discuss  this  literature  and  point  out  that 
methodological  inconsistencies  across  studies  make  most  evidence  incomparable  and 
inconclusive.  In  this  section,  we  review  prior  research  while  keeping  in  mind  the  financial 
variables central to this study: stock returns, firm value measured by Tobin’s q, and return on 
assets.  
 
2.1 Prior Evidence 
The empirical literature relating the environmental component of CSR to stock performance 
separates  into  three  subsets:  event  studies  that  explore  the  immediate  effects  of  social  or 
environmental  performance  proxies  on  short-term  stock  price  variability;  cross-sectional

regression analyses that attempt to establish a longer-term relationship between CSR and stock 
returns; and portfolio studies that investigate the benefits of embedding CSR into investment 
decisions. 
 
To date, event studies provide the best evidence of a link between environmental and 
stock market performance. This body of research, which includes studies by Hamilton (1995), 
Klassen  and  McLaughlin  (1996),  and  Shane  and  Spicer  (1983)  suggests  that  although 
environmental  pollution  figures  generally  tend  to  have  an  influence  on  stock  market 
performance, there is also an asymmetrical stock return sensitivity to environmental news. For 
example, Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) find evidence suggesting that a stock price increase 
following positive environmental information about the firm is less strong than a price decline 
in response to negative news. 
  
A second group of studies uses regression or correlation analysis to explore long-term 
relationships between corporate environmental responsibility and stock returns. These studies 
provide mixed support for the notion of a relationship between environmental performance and 
shareholder  value.  Spicer  (1978)  reports  that  those  companies  in  the  U.S.  pulp  and  paper 
industry that have better pollution control records have higher profitability figures and lower 
stock betas, but both Chen and Metcalf (1980) and Mahapatra (1984) fail to confirm the idea 
that  pollution  control  initiatives  are  rewarded  with  improved  stock  performance.  More 
consistent  evidence  pertains  to  markets  outside  the  United  States,  for  which  Thomas  (2001; 
U.K.) and Ziegler et al. (2002; Europe) document moderate evidence of a positive relationship 
between environmental performance and stock returns. Portfolio research typically involves a 
comparison  of  average  risk-adjusted  returns  between  two  or  more  mutually  exclusive 
portfolios. These portfolios are constructed using a company characteristic as a discriminating 
factor. Portfolios are usually evaluated by using a performance attribution model that controls 
for  common  intervening  factors  known  to  influence  portfolio  performance.  Despite  the 
popularity of this approach in the mainstream asset pricing literature (e.g., Fama and French, 
1993), remarkably little research has applied environmental firm characteristics as a discerning 
variable.  Among  the  few  exceptions,  research  by  Cohen  et  al.  (1997)  suggests  that  there  is 
neither a premium nor a penalty for investing in environmental leader companies. On the other 
hand, White (1996) finds that his “green” portfolio provides a significantly positive market-risk 
adjusted return, while “brown” and “oatmeal” portfolios do not. Recent research by Derwall et 
al.  (2005),  who  use  modern  performance  evaluation  techniques,  suggests  that  eco-efficient

companies  jointly  provide  anomalously  positive  equity  returns  relative  to  their  less-eco 
efficient peers over the period 1995-2003. 
A relatively recent strand of research addresses the evidence on potential links between 
 
environmental performance and firm value. Generally, the evidence is uniform and points to a 
positive and significant relationship between environmental management policies and Tobin’s 
q.  Dowell  et  al.  (2000)  separate  multinational  firms  in  their  U.S.  sample  into  three  groups: 
firms that default internationally to (less stringent) local environmental standards; companies 
that apply U.S. environmental standards on an international scale; and firms that adopt more 
stringent standards than those required by U.S. law. Their results suggest that firms that adopt 
higher, more stringent environmental criteria have a higher firm valuation than those that use 
less stringent ones.  
 
These findings are consistent with Konar and Cohen (2001), who suggest that firms that 
are disposing of relatively smaller amounts of toxic chemicals, and those that are confronted 
with  fewer  or  no  environmental  lawsuits,  tend  to  have  a  higher  Q.  King  and  Lenox  (2002) 
further  expand  previous  research  by  disentangling  the  emissions  of  a  large  number  of  U.S. 
firms into sub-aggregates. The important conclusion from their work is that waste prevention 
and  future  firm  value  are  positively  associated,  but  that  pollution  reduction  efforts  by  other 
means, such as “end-of-pipe” pollution treatment, do not affect Tobin’s q.  
 
Another  massive  body  of  research  relies  on  operating  performance  measures, 
predominantly  using  accounting  data.1  Not  surprisingly,  the  results  from  this  research  are 
somewhat dependent on the choice of operating performance measure. A few empirical studies 
are of particular concern to our work. Considerable interest has been shown in the company’s 
return  on  assets  as  a  dependent  variable,  primarily  because  ROA  is  one  of  the  broadest 
measures of firm operating performance. For example, Freedman and Jaggi (1988) investigate 
the  relation  between  environmental  pollution  disclosure  and  several  accounting-based 
performance indicators but find little evidence to support the conjecture that there is a clear-cut 
and significant association. However, McGuire et al. (1988) show that, contrary to alternative 
measures  in  their  study,  ROA  does  correlate  with  their  corporate  social  performance  index. 
Russo  and  Fouts  (1997)  complement  previous  work,  suggesting  that  environmental 
performance  is  positively  connected  with  ROA  but  also  that  this  association  is  more 
pronounced  for  high-growth  industries.  Hart  and  Ahuja  (1996)  and  Waddock  and  Graves

(1997)  also  report  that  several  financial  measures,  including  ROA,  relate  significantly  to 
environmental  performance  indicators,  but  express  some  doubts  regarding  the  direction  of 
causality. In a more recent study, King and Lennox (2002) suggest that pollution prevention, 
but not pollution treatment, causes higher return on assets.  
 
2.2 Contribution to Existing Literature 
While the research up to this point seems overwhelming at first glance, a substantial part of the 
evidence  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Our  goal  in  this  paper  is  to  overcome  several 
methodological limitations that are often encountered in the empirical literature. Broadly, our 
enhancements pertain to the following areas.  
 
First,  we  address  the  problem  of  choosing  an  appropriate  proxy  for  environmental 
performance. Corporate social (environmental) responsibility is a broad construct that can only 
be  assessed  with  multidimensional  indicators.  As  also  suggested  by  Waddock  and  Graves 
(1997), the majority of related literature relies on measures that either lack sufficient depth and 
detail  or,  alternatively,  are  too  noisy  to  be  fully  capable  of  measuring  corporate  social  or 
environmental  performance.  In  addition,  as  underscored  by  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001),  most 
previous research analyzes data that only point towards historical performance. In contrast, our 
study builds on the concept of eco-efficiency, which is a more strictly defined construct and 
can be quantified by using Innovest’s eco-efficiency rating methodology. As we explain, the 
rating is not only intended to reflect historical environmental performance, but also to identify 
future environmental risks and opportunities. 
 
interpretation  of  financial 
Our  second  contribution  concerns 
performance criteria. We first use accounting-based and a market-based measures to assess the 
different pathways leading environmental management to financial performance. Using return 
on assets, we capture the association between environmental and operating performance. Via 
Tobin’s q (Q), we capture the value investors assign to environmental policies. 
 
Moreover, we then extend earlier studies that implicitly infer a static relation between 
environmental management and performance based on market value measures. While Dowell 
et  al.  (2000),  King  and  Lennox  (2002),  and  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001)  suggest  that 
environmental  governance  is  positively  related  to  market  value  measures  of  performance, 
recent  evidence  casts  doubt  on  whether  environmental  information  is  valued  accurately. 
Derwall  et  al.  (2005)  point  to  an  anomalously  positive  stock  return  differential  between 
environmental leaders and laggards, suggesting that environmental information is incorporated 

the  choice  and

slowly  into  stock  prices.  Their  results  motivate  us  to  analyze  whether  the  relation  between 
environmental  performance  and  Tobin’s  q  has  strengthened  over  time.  The  environmental 
database we study is unique in that it covers monthly environmental performance ratings for 
more  than  eight  years.  Thus,  it  is  an  excellent  means  for  testing  time-varying  relationships. 
Using a variant of the two-step modeling approach introduced by Fama and MacBeth (1973), 
we are able to exploit the richness of information contained by both cross-sectional and time-
series dimensions of the data.  
 
3. Theoretical Debates and Hypotheses 
For several decades, the academic community has postulated models and hypotheses that relate 
corporate  social  and  environmental  responsibility  to  financial  performance,  mostly  with  the 
intention to provide a framework that aligns CSR with shareholder value creation. Despite the 
growing  academic  attention  on  the  CSR-financial  performance  relationship,  management 
scientists  and  financial  economists  have  developed  their  ideas  in  this  area  almost 
autonomously. Corporate management theories up to this point discuss many benefits to CSR, 
but  leave  unexplained  questions  that  are  critically  relevant  to  shareholders  of  socially  and 
environmentally  responsible  companies.  Modern  investment  theories  fill  that  gap.  In  this 
section,  we  introduce  and  test  hypotheses  that  combine  management  and  financial  theories. 
Both theories are critical for understanding how firms’ environmental management relates to 
financial performance. 
 
3.1 Management Theories 
The CSR-financial performance relationship is the source of considerable debate. Theories in 
the  management  literature  are  far  from  uniform  and,  as  pointed  out  by  Griffin  and  Mahon 
(1997),  more  than  25  years  of  empirical  research  has  been  unable  to  overcome  long-lasting 
theoretical divides. 

The  roots  of  the  debates  go  back  decades.  During  the  1960s,  the  concepts  of  corporate 
social  responsibility  and  socially  responsible  investing  were  gaining  momentum.  However, 
opponents of CSR quite forcefully questioned the validity of CSR in the context of what they 
believed is the purpose of the firm: maximizing shareholder wealth. In general, opponents of 
the concept of CSR raise two critical points:

-  CSR  is  far  from  well  defined.  A  view  shared  by  many  skeptics,  including  Friedman 
(1962), is that managers are unable to determine what the social responsibility of their 
company is. Many managers believe that the only responsibility of the firm is to engage 
in profitable activities. Shareholders themselves are capable of deciding whether their 
stock income sufficiently represents social awareness.  

-  CSR  is  expensive  and  decreases  shareholder  value.  At  least  partially  because  of  the 
problem of determining the social responsibility of businesses, a common criticism of 
CSR cites the financial dangers of adopting corporate social responsibility principles. 
Several  critics  stress  that  CSR  initiatives  inherently  demand  significant  portions  of  a 
company’s financial resources, but the potential financial benefits of such initiatives are 
mostly in the distant future, if these benefits are evident at all (e.g., Henderson, 2002; 
Walley and Whitehead, 1994). 

 

Briefly, the main concern expressed by CSR skeptics is that the costs associated with corporate 
social performance improvements are likely to outweigh the financial benefits, which makes 
CSR inconsistent with the principles of shareholder wealth maximization. 

In  contrast,  a  sizable  number  of  CSR  proponents  have  put  forward  a  long  list  of  the 
advantages to corporate social responsibility. Their reasoning is that organizations can generate 
significant  goodwill  and  new  market  opportunities  by  displaying  social  and  environmental 
awareness (e.g., Fombrun et al., 2000; Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Porter and Van der Linde, 1995; 
Russo and Fouts, 1997). However, there is a growing belief that the economic benefits depend 
on the nature of environmental performance. More and more often, researchers argue that the 
advantages resulting from social and environmental compliance with regulatory requirements 
are  not  a  primary  source  of  competitive  advantage.  For  example,  the  mere  fact  of 
environmental compliance hardly allows a company to distinguish itself from its competitors, 
because most intra-industry peers are affected by compliance in a similar way. As pointed out 
by Dowell et al. (2000), Hart and Ahuja (1996), and Russo and Fouts (1997), real benefits to 
organizations are likely to come from more rigorous (i.e., proactive) forms of environmental 
performance  that  require  both  changes  in  production  and  manufacturing  processes  and  a 
forward-looking management style. Hillman and Keim (2001) add that CSR initiatives can pay 
off, as long as these efforts are in the interest of the company’s primary stakeholders.  

Conditional on these lines of reasoning, specific arguments in favor of CSR include:

-  CSR  is  associated  with  reputational  benefits.  Several  scholars  suggest  that  adopting 
corporate social responsibility policies may lead to improvements in the firm’s image 
(e.g., Davis, 1973). Because the firm’s social performance record can proxy for labor 
conditions, socially responsible companies gain a competitive advantage by improving 
their  ability  to  attract  high-quality  employees.  Empirical  evidence  by  Turban  and 
Greening (1996) strongly supports this line of reasoning. Apart from human-resource 
benefits, other researchers, for instance, Vandermerwe and Oliff (1990), and Russo and 
Fouts  (1997),  mention  the  possibility  that  reputational  advantages  result  in  sales 
benefits,  because  customers  may  be  sensitive  to  social  issues.  Similarly,  reputational 
increases may affect relationships with potential suppliers and lenders. 

-  CSR can also serve as a proxy for management skills. Alexander and Buchholz (1978) 
and  Bowman  and  Haire  (1975)  suggest  that  corporate  social  and  environmental 
performance reflects management quality. A structural and dedicated CSR policy might 
inherently  require  commitment  to  CSR  among  and  between  all  levels  of  the  firm  as 
well as a forward-thinking, long-term-oriented management (Shrivastava (1995)).  

-  CSR may also reflect (technological) innovativeness. For example, Porter and van der 
Linde  (1995)  argue  that  poor  environmental  performance  is  a  sign  of  the  firm’s 
operational  inefficiency,  which  ultimately  leads  to  competitive  disadvantages.  In 
addition,  the  resource-based  view  towards  environmental  governance,  as  outlined  by 
Russo  and  Fouts  (1997),  says  that  a  proactive  environmental  policy  within  the  firm 
ultimately  requires  a  structural  change  in  production  and  service  delivery  processes. 
This  redesign  involves  the  development,  acquisition,  and  implementation  of  new 
technologies and may lead to economic advantages vis-à-vis competitors.  

 

In fact, the resource-based view suggests that only pro-active environmental governance is a 
source  of  financial  benefits,  which  will  be  unique  to  the  firm  and  difficult  to  obtain  by 
competitors.  Since  eco-efficiency  closely  coincides  with  the  resource-based  view  in  that  it 
represents pro-active environmental management, we arrive at the following hypothesis:  
 
H1: Eco-efficiency relates positively to operating performance, ceteris paribus.

3.2 Financial Theories 
Now, more than ever before, financial-market participants have been paying attention to CSR. 
Institutional  investors  are  demonstrating  their  interest  in  the  concepts  CSR  and  socially 
responsible  investing  (SRI)  as  a  means  of  fulfilling  their  social  and  financial  obligations. 
Recent estimates by the Social Investment Forum (2003) suggest that the market for socially 
responsible investments currently covers approximately 12 percent of the market as a whole.  

11

Analogous  to  these  developments,  researchers,  starting  with  Moskowitz  (1972),  have 
put forward theoretical frameworks that either support or reject the validity of CSR from an 
investor perspective. These frameworks rely on established asset pricing theories which center 
on the risk-return paradigm.  

The risk-return paradigm is important because it highlights that managerial perspectives 
towards CSR are only one part of the story. Although there is a tendency among management 
scholars  to  believe  that  firms  are  doing  well  by  engaging  in  activities  that  increase  their 
(intangible) value, financial theories add important insights on benefits from such activities in 
terms of risk-adjusted returns to stockholders. Whether investors benefit from holding stocks of 
socially responsible companies depends on how financial markets value CSR.  

Hamilton, Jo, and, Statman (1993) note that financial markets may respond to corporate 

social responsibility information in three different ways: 

 

- 

 

 
- 

In scenario one, the market does not value corporate social responsibility. Investors 
do not tie better social or environmental performance to lower risk. Consequently, 
the expected stock returns of CSR leaders are no different from those of laggards, all 
else  equal,  and  firm  value  is  independent  of  environmental  governance.  This 
scenario would be supported empirically by evidence that a relation between CSR 
and market-based measures of firm value is not statistically significant. This scenario 
can apply to CSR as well as any of its subsets. When focused on the concept of eco-
efficiency, the hypothesis that follows from this scenario can be stated as: 

H2a: Eco-efficiency is not associated with firm value, ceteris paribus.  

Contrary to scenario one, the second scenario predicts that investors do value CSR. 
As suggested by Narver (1971), Shane and Spicer (1983) and Spicer (1978), firms 
with a strong social or environmental performance record might be regarded as less

risky  investments  compared  to  poor  environmental  performers.  In  the  risk-return 
framework,  the  notion  that  social  and  environmental  leaders  are  less  risky 
investments  than  laggards  implies  that  investors  demand  a  lower  return  on  these 
firms’ stocks. Because investors assign a lower discount rate to expected future cash 
flows of socially responsive companies, these firms have a higher value. We note 
that  if  capital  markets  incorporate  information  related  to  CSR  efficiently,  we  can 
assume that expected returns on stocks compensate investors fairly for the associated 
risk, and that risk-adjusted stock returns are consistent with an equilibrium setting. 
When  the  focus  is  on  the  economic  significance  of  corporate  eco-efficiency,  the 
hypothesis consistent with the second scenario is stated as: 

H2b: Eco-efficiency is positively associated with firm value, ceteris paribus. 

Scenario three revolves around a disequilibrium. This scenario raises the possibility 
that the paradigm is violated in practice and suggests that the market does not price 
CSR  efficiently.  Investors  may  find  it  complicated  to  value  the  benefits  or  costs 
associated  with  environmental  governance,  particularly  intangible  ones.  Whether 
environmental  information  is  slowly  impounded  into  stock  prices  has  important 
implications for both firm value and stock returns. Under the previous scenario, the 
expected returns on environmental leaders firms, all else equal, should be lower than 
those  of  environmental  laggards.  In  the  third  case,  however,  stocks  of  socially 
responsible companies can be initially undervalued (overvalued) relative to those of 
less  socially  responsible  companies  and  ultimately  produce  higher  (lower)  risk-
adjusted returns. Recent empirical evidence by Derwall et al. (2005) indicates that 
eco-efficient stock portfolios outperformed their least eco-efficient counterparts by 
more than is suggested by investment risk, supporting an undervaluation hypothesis. 
The Derwall et al. (2005) study motivates the following hypothesis: 

H2c: The valuation differential between the most eco-efficient firms and the least eco-
efficient firms increases over time, ceteris paribus.

Collecting  evidence  in  support  of  this  hypothesis  requires  that  we  analyze  the  market’s 
valuation of firms’ CSR characteristics over time. The unique longitudinal dimension of the 
environmental data in this study satisfies that condition. 
 
4. Data 
4.1 Eco-Efficiency Data 
Among both managers and scholars, there is no consensus as to precisely what constitutes the 
social  or  environmental  responsibility  of  the  firm.  Traditional  proxies  for  environmental 
performance,  such  as  environmental  reports  by  third-party  organizations,  typically  rely  on 
news  concerning  absolute  pollution  levels.  However,  these  indicators  of  environmental 
responsibility address merely a single dimension of a company’s environmental performance 
and usually reflect historical environmental events.  

We focus on eco-efficiency. As noted earlier, we define a firm’s eco-efficiency as the 
ability to create more value while using fewer environmental resources, such as water, air, oil, 
coal and other limited natural endowments. Dowell et al. (2000) interpret eco-efficiency as the 
ability  of  companies  to  minimize  pollution  by  improving  the  production  and  manufacturing 
process.  This  form  of  environmental  responsibility  represents  proactive  environmental 
management,  one  which  concentrates  on  good  environmental  performance  from  changes  in 
operational efficiency, rather than by adopting standards for pollution control at the “end of the 
pipe”.  

Eco-efficiency usually measures the environmental performance of a firm in a relative 
sense. To understand the difference between absolute and relative environmental performance, 
consider,  for  example,  firms  that  operate  in  environmentally  sensitive  industries  such  as 
mining,  energy,  or  chemicals.  In  absolute  terms,  these  firms  are  usually  regarded  as  poor 
environmental  performers.  However,  at  the  intra-industry  level,  firms  facing  the  same 
environmental challenges can still do well relative to competitors, and can benefit from this 
financially. 

We explore empirical relationships between eco-efficiency and several dimensions of 
corporate financial performance. To do so, we use eco-efficiency scores developed by Innovest 
Strategic  Value  Advisors.  Since  the  Innovest  data  have  received  little  attention  in  previous 
research, by using Innovest’s data we can provide new evidence.  

One  of  the  main  strengths  of  this  database  is  its  comprehensiveness.  Using  over  20 
information sources, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, Innovest’s analysts evaluate a

company  relative  to  its  industry  peers  via  an  analytical  matrix.  Companies  are  evaluated  by 
more  than  60  criteria,  which  jointly  constitute  the  final  rating.  For  each  of  these  factors,  all 
companies receive a (sub)score. As these variables are not considered equally important in the 
overall assessment of eco-efficiency, each factor is weighted differently. For example, Innovest 
analysts  consider  a  firm’s  environmental  product  development  as  more  important  than 
certification by a third party that is devoted to promoting environmental awareness. The final 
numerical rating analysts assign to a company is converted into a relative score based on the 
total spread of scores in the sector to which the firm belongs.  

  The eco-efficiency score reflects environmental performance in five fundamental areas. 
The first broad area covers historical liabilities, which concern the risks (and opportunities) a 
firm faces in consequence of past environmental behavior. Among other things, this category 
covers  superfund  liabilities,  state  and  hazardous  waste  sites,  and  toxic  torts.  A  second 
component represents contemporaneous operating risk, addressing risk exposures from events 
that  are  more  recent.  This  category  includes,  for  example,  toxic  emissions,  product  risk 
liabilities, waste discharges, and supply-chain management risk. The third area, which can be 
labeled “sustainability and eco-efficiency risk,” pertains to the weakening of a firm’s material 
sources of long-term profitability and competitiveness, and the potential future risks initiated 
by  this  development.  This  area  spans  energy  intensity,  energy  efficiency,  the  durability  and 
recyclability of the product life cycle, but also the extent to which companies are exposed to 
changes in consumer values. The fourth area covered by the score concerns managerial risk 
efficiency. This category represents the ability of the company to manage environmental risks 
successfully,  as  can  be  witnessed  from,  e.g.,  the  quality  of  supply  chain  management, 
environmental audit/accounting capacity, the strength of environmental management systems, 
training  capacity.  The  last  dimension  involves  business  prospects  resulting  from  eco-
efficiency, such as the degree to which businesses can reap future competitive advantages from 
environmentally  driven  market  trends  and  profit  opportunities  provided  that  the  company’s 
management has well-developed eco-efficiency policies. 

From this brief overview, it becomes apparent that Innovest’s eco-efficiency measure is 
intended to embody both ex post (i.e., historical and current) and ex ante (i.e., forward-looking) 
dimensions of corporate eco-efficiency.  

In this paper, we consider firms listed on the U.S. stock markets. As we also use various 
financial  data,  we  match  the  Innovest  database  to  the  CRSP  U.S.  stock  database  and  to  the 
Compustat U.S. Research database. We match by ticker, company name, and CUSIP number.

The resulting data set is survivor-bias-free in the sense that it includes not only firms that were 
covered by Innovest recently, but also those which disappeared over time, for instance, due to 
merger  or  bankruptcy.  Further  details  on  the  financial  data  will  be  given  in  the  appropriate 
sections.

regress fourth-quarter financial measures on eco-efficiency scores that are dated September). 
Over the period 1996-2004, the average rating decreases from 3.04 to 2.30. The median rating 
decreases from 3 to 2. The standard deviation varies only mildly over time.

The table also reports the frequency of the eco-efficiency score broken up into seven 
categories. Statistics on the number of firms within each rating category explain the decrease in 
average eco-efficiency rating. The number of firms that receive an eco-efficiency score below 
3 increases more strongly compared to the number of firms that have a score of 4 or higher.  

The  number  of  firms  in  the  sample  increases  considerably  over  time.  Our  data  set 
includes scores for 154 companies at the end of December 1996 and 519 firms at the end of 
September 2004. 
 
4.2 Financial Data 
To  accomplish  our  objective  of  investigating  the  association  between  eco-efficiency  and 
several  dimensions  of  corporate  financial  performance,  we  first  analyze  the  connection 
between eco-efficiency and operating performance. Our primary interest is in a broad measure 
of operating performance that addresses both profitability and efficiency. Inspired by Barber 
and Lyon (1996), we measure operating performance by the company’s return on assets. Our 
set of control variables is similar to Waddock and Graves (1997). We control for the influence 
of firm size and the firm’s riskiness. We measure size by the firm’s total assets and by total 
sales.  The  debt-to-asset  ratio  represents  risk.  We  use  data  from  Compustat  to  construct  all 
variables. 
 
Next,  we  turn  our  attention  to  the  role  of  eco-efficiency  in  firm  valuation,  using  the 
Tobin’s q measure. Following Kaplan and Zingales (1997), we compute Q as the market value 
of assets divided by the book value of assets. The market value of assets is defined as the sum 
of the book value of assets and the market value of common stock outstanding minus the sum 
of the book value of common stock and balance sheet deferred taxes. Although there are more 
sophisticated approaches to computing Q, we use the most efficient approximation to ensure 
sufficient  data  availability  throughout  our  sample  period.  Further,  as  shown  by  Perfect  and 
Wiles  (1994),  and  by  Chung  and  Pruitt  (1994),  this  proxy  for  Q  is  highly  correlated  with 
estimates that are more complex.  
Our  Tobin’s  q  analysis  accounts  for  potentially  confounding  influences.  Because 
 
researchers  such  as  Hirsch  (1991)  show  that  recent  sales  growth  is  positively  related  to 
company valuation, we include past two-year sales growth as a control variable. Furthermore,

related work, including Dowell et al. (2000), King and Lenox (2002), and Konar and Cohen 
(2001),  suggests  that  firm  value  is  positively  related  to  R&D  expenses.  To  parse  out  this 
relationship, our control set contains research and development expenses scaled by sales as an 
additional explanatory variable. To condition on differences in operating performance we use 
return on assets (ROA). Following Gompers et al. (2003), we use the logarithm of the book 
value  of  assets  to  account  for  differences  in  firm  size.  We  also  include  firm  age.  As  an 
approximation of the firm’s age, we compute the difference between the first trading day and 
the respective date of the analysis. Since the database “Exshare”, from which we retrieve the 
first  trading  days,  was  established  in  November  1984,  we  lack  information  before  1984.  If 
firms were founded before this date, we still assume that founding occurred in 1984.  
 
Finally, we consider a dummy variable that is equal to unity if the firm is listed on the 
Nasdaq exchange and zero otherwise. The dummy controls for atypically high Tobin’s q values 
of Nasdaq firms that may have occurred during the stock market hype of the late nineties. We 
construct all variables other than firm age using data from Compustat.

To show the distribution of ROA and Q, Table 2 reports descriptive statistics pertaining to five 
specific dates. The distribution of ROA is quite symmetric. Median and mean values for ROA 
do  not  display  a  large  discrepancy,  being  similar  in  value  and  time  invariant.  As  for  the 
distribution  of  Tobin’s  q,  we  can  see  that  there  is  some  non-normality  in  the  data.  Q  has  a 
distribution that is peaked and leptokurtic, as indicated by the high values for skewness and 
kurtosis. Arguably, the stock market fad of 2000 plays an important role in explaining the long 
right tail in the Q data. Further, we observe differences in the cross-sectional median Q and the 
mean Q over time. The median values for Tobin’s q remain relatively stable but mean values 
are much higher during the technology boom and bust period. We alleviate potential problems 
associated with non-normality by doing robustness tests after having industry-adjusted, taken 
in logs, and trimmed the data, respectively. The dummy variable for companies listed on the 
Nasdaq Stock Exchange captures potentially extreme Tobin’s q values during the technology 
bubble. 
 
5. Empirical Analysis  
5.1 Eco-Efficiency and Return on Assets 
In order to analyze the relation between eco-efficiency and operating performance, we follow 
the  multivariate  model  of  Waddock  and  Graves  (1997).  Cross-sectional  analysis  is  most 
suitable  for  testing  our  hypothesis.2  Since  our  data  are  longitudinal  in  nature,  periodical 
regressions  can  be  performed.  We  estimate  the  following  cross-sectional  models  quarter  by 
quarter from 1997 to 2004: 

 
ROAit = αi + β1Eco-Efficiencyit + γit Xit + εit, 
ROAit = αi + β0High Eco-Efficiencyit + β1Low Eco-Efficiencyit + γit Xit + εit, 

     

     

 

        

      (1) 
      (2) 

 
where ROAit denotes return on assets. We consider modeling both ROA and the firm’s ROA 
relative to the industry median ROA. Eco-Efficiencyit in model (1) represents the firm’s eco-
efficiency score. This model, therefore, assumes linear relations. To account for the possibility 
of nonlinearity in the relation between eco-efficiency and our financial measures we develop 
an alternative model. In specification (2), we replace the absolute eco-efficiency score with two 
dummy variables that specify whether firm i is the most or the least eco-efficient. High Eco-

                                                           
2 At first glance, a plausible alternative approach could be a pooled model that allows for fixed effects and time-
specific events. However, we rejected this setup due to a lack of time variation in firms’ eco-efficiency scores.

Efficiencyit (Low Eco-Efficiencyit) is equal to one if firm i is rated five or six (zero or one) at t, 
and  zero  otherwise.  Xit  is  a  vector  of  control  variables  and  γ  is  a  vector  of  coefficients.  We 
allow  for  permutations  of  the  regressors.  Candidate  control  variables  include  the  firm’s  size 
measured either by total assets or by total sales, and the debt-to-asset ratio. Using a variant of 
the Fama-MacBeth (1973) method, we compute time-series averages of the 32 cross-sectional 
regression coefficients. We calculate corresponding t-statistics based on standard errors from 
the 32 parameter estimates which we obtain for each variable.  
Table 3 reports the time-series average coefficients and corresponding t-statistics. We 
 
note that the coefficient estimates for all control variables are consistent with those reported by 
Waddock  and  Graves  (1997).  With  the  exception  of  total  sales,  they  are  all  statistically 
significant at the usual cut-off levels.  

In  panel  A  of  Table  3,  we  report  coefficients  on  the  eco-efficiency  score.  Eco-
Efficiency  it  has  a  coefficient  that  is  positive  and  significant  at  the  1  percent  level.  All 
specifications indicate that the positive relation between eco-efficiency and ROA is robust to 
changes in the set of dependent and control variables. The results of replacing Eco-Efficiencyit 
with High Eco-Efficiencyit and Low Eco-Efficiencyit are shown in Panel B of Table 3. There is 
weak  evidence  of  an  asymmetry  in  the  relation  between  eco-efficiency  and  operating 
performance. Our estimates suggest that the underperformance of the least eco-efficient firms 
(relative to the reference group) is almost twice as large as the outperformance of the most eco-
efficient  companies.  Moreover, 
the  operational  underperformance  associated  with 
environmental  laggards  is  significant  at  the  1  percent  level  in  all  specifications.  The 
outperformance of environmental leaders is marginally significant.  

From an economic perspective, eco-efficiency relates sizably to operating performance. 
The  increase  in  absolute  ROA  resulting  from  a  one-point  rise  in  eco-efficiency  ranking  is 
estimated at 0.09 percent, ceteris paribus, which is about 2.2 percent of the sample average 
ROA  we  observe  in  Table  2.  To  get  an  impression  of  the  asymmetrical  influence  of  eco-
efficiency  on  operating  performance,  we  can  estimate  how  much  loss  in  ROA  a  firm  in  the 
reference group (category 2, 3 and 4) would prevent by avoiding a low eco-efficiency ranking. 
Panel B points out that the loss prevention amounts to about 0.32 percent, which is 8.4 percent 
of the average ROA. The gain a firm can achieve by obtaining a high eco-efficiency rating is 
0.14 percent, which is about 3.6 percent of the average ROA.  

In  support  of  H1  we  find  a  positive  relation  between  eco-efficiency  and  operating 
performance. Our evidence also suggests that the relation is asymmetric, for which we offer

two explanations. First, although our ratings are converted into numbers, they have no real unit 
of measurement. Caveats associated with ordinal data could prevent us from accurately  
measuring  differences  in  eco-efficiency  and  induce  false  suggestions  of  an  asymmetry.  A 
second  explanation  is  that  the  negative  financial  impact  resulting  from  poor  environmental 
governance  is  mostly  tangible  of  nature  and  therefore  visibly  reflected  in  operating 
performance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the clean-up costs associated with oil spills and 
hazardous waste sides might directly decrease earnings. In addition, the reputational damage 
resulting  from  environmental  accidents  can  lead  to  customer  boycotts  which  directly  affect 
sales and profits. In contrast, strong environmental policies might largely be associated with 
intangible benefits, such as strong management skills, technological innovativeness and brand 
reputation that materialize slowly.  
 
5.2 Eco-Efficiency and Firm Value 
To  examine  empirically  the  relation  between  eco-efficiency  and  firm  valuation,  we  estimate 
quarterly the following cross-sectional models:  
 
 
 
 
In model (3), Qit denotes Tobin’s q for firm i in quarter t and Eco-Efficiencyit represents the 
eco-efficiency rating of firm i at t. Xit is a vector of control variables and γ denotes a vector of 
coefficients. In model (4), we replace Eco-Efficiencyit with two dummy variables that indicate 
whether  firm  i  is  eligible  for  inclusion  in  a  high-ranked  portfolio  or  a  low-ranked  portfolio 
similar  to  that  of  Derwall  et  al.  (2005).  The  variable  High  Eco-Efficiencyit  (Low  Eco-
Efficiencyit) is equal to unity if firm i is rated five or six (zero or one), and zero otherwise.  
Because  we  consider  several  model  specifications,  Xit  contains  permutations  of  the 
 
following candidate regressors: the firm’s two-year sales growth, firm age, firms size measured 
by  the  logarithm  of  the  book  value  of  total  assets,  return  on  assets,  R&D  spending,  an 
interaction term between sales growth and R&D spending, and a dummy variable for Nasdaq 
companies.  From  the  32  quarterly  regressions,  performed  over  the  period  January  1997  to 
December 2004, we compute Fama-MacBeth (1973) time-series averages and their respective 
t-statistics.  We  also  allow  for  some  variation  in  the  dependent  variable  by  repeating  the 

 Qit = αi + β1 Eco-Efficiencyit + γit Xit + εit, 
 
Qit = αi + β0 High Eco-Efficiencyit + β1Low Eco-Efficiencyit + γit Xit + εit,

estimation  of  (3)  and  (4)  using,  respectively,  an  industry-adjusted  Q  (Q  minus  the  industry 
median Q), Q in logs, and a trimmed Q as a dependent variable. Trimming mitigates the effect 
of potential outliers in Tobin’s q. We adopt the trimming approach of Collins et al. (1997) and 
remove observations using the 0.995 percentile and the 0.005 percentile as upper and lower 
boundaries. 

Table 4 shows the results for the main model specifications. Panel A of Table 4 reports 
the results of estimating equation (3). The first column of this panel reports the results of a 
regression based on a standard, unmodified Q. The additional columns present the results of 
using,  respectively,  industry-adjusted  Q  (Q  minus  the  industry  median  Q),  Q  in  logs,  and 
trimmed  Q.  Taken  as  a  whole,  regardless  of  the  choice  of  the  dependent  variable,  the 
coefficients  on  most  control  variables  (sales  growth,  size  and  ROA  and  firm  age)  are 
significant  and  carry  signs  that  are  consistent  with  a  priori  expectations  and  with  previous 
research. The only exceptions are the age variable, for which the coefficient weakens once we 
use  industry-adjusted  Tobin’s  q,  and  the  sales  growth  variable,  which  becomes  insignificant 
when we take the logarithm of Q as a dependent variable.  

The observation most relevant to our study is that under all scenarios, the coefficient on 
Eco-Efficiencyit is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Our estimate of 
the  eco-efficiency  coefficient  (β1)  in  equation  (3)  is  approximately  0.07  when  Q  is  the 
dependent  variable.  The  coefficient  decreases  due  to  rescaling  when  Q  is  taken  in  log,  but 
remains highly significant. Furthermore, we note that neither industry adjustment nor trimming 
of Tobin’s q affects the coefficient estimates substantially. The latter observation is important 
because it suggests our results are not driven by outliers arising from, for instance, the stock 
market crash of 2000. Overall, these parameter estimates support H2b. 

Panel  B  of  Table  4,  adds  to  understanding  the  positive  association  between  eco-
efficiency and Q. The panel reports the outcomes of replacing Eco-Efficiencyit with the dummy 
variables High Eco-Efficiencyit and Low Eco-Efficiencyit (equation (4)). The results indicate a 
slightly asymmetric relationship between eco-efficiency and Q: The negative coefficient on the 
Low Eco-Efficiency dummy is larger in magnitude than the positive coefficient on the High 
Eco-efficiency dummy. However, evidence of asymmetry varies across the specifications and 
should  be  interpreted  with  care.  Most  important  to  our  research  question is the fact that the 
most  eco-efficient  firms  have  a  significantly  higher  valuation  than  their  least  eco-efficient 
counterparts.

To evaluate the robustness of the relationships further, we estimate additional models 
that  include  different  sets  of  control  variables.  Table  5  presents  the  outcomes  for  these 
alternative specifications. For reasons of comparison, we import the initial results pertaining to 
equations  (3)  and  (4)  from  the  previous  table.  In  line  with  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001)  two 
alternative models augment the first set of control variables by R&D expenditure. In the second 
model, we also add an interaction term between sales growth and R&D expenditure. We note 
that  the  inclusion  of  R&D  spending  decreases  our  sample  size  substantially,  since  this 
information  was  not  available  for  a  large  number  of  firms.  The  last  alternative specification 
expands the first model by the Nasdaq dummy.  

In panel A, the results show that even in the presence of additional control variables, the 
sensitivity of Q with respect to the eco-efficiency score remains positive and significant at the 
1  percent  level.  The  coefficient  estimate  of  Eco-Efficiency  decreases  somewhat  once  we 
include  R&D  spending  as  an  additional  control.  However,  because  limited  availability  of 
(cross-sectional) R&D data induces a small sample problem, the results we find under the third 
and fourth set of control variables should be interpreted with caution. 

The  results  of  replacing  Eco-Efficiencyit  with  High  Eco-Efficiencyit  and  Low  Eco-
Efficiencyit  are  given  in  Panel  B  of  Table  5.  Again,  the  evidence  supports  H2b.  After  the 
inclusion of the additional control variables, the asymmetry weakens. Independent of the set of 
control  variables,  we  find  a  significant  valuation  differential  between  the  most  eco-efficient 
and the least eco-efficient firms.  

In  order  to  assess  the  economic  significance  of  eco-efficiency,  we  can  estimate  how 
much  a  firm  would  enjoy  an  increase  in  valuation  resulting  from  a  unit  increase  in  eco-
efficiency ranking. Table 4, panel A, suggests that the impact of a one-point increase in eco-
efficiency ranking on Tobin’s q amounts to 0.07, ceteris paribus, which is approximately 3.2 
percent of the average Q we observe for all firms in the sample. To address the asymmetrical 
influence  we  estimate  how  much  loss  in  Q  a  firm  in  the  reference  group  would  prevent  by 
avoiding a low eco-efficiency ranking. Panel B suggests that the loss avoidance varies from 9 
percent to 13 percent of the sample-average Q, depending on the choice of model. The gain 
from receiving a high eco-efficiency rating is in the range of almost 0 to 7 percent.

Eco-Efficiency and Firm Value: Robustness Checks 

TABLE 5 

The table reports the Fama-MacBeth (1973) time-series mean coefficient and the corresponding t-statistic (in parentheses). Note: Low Eco-Efficiency = 1 if firm ranked ≤ 1. 
High-Eco-Efficiency =1 if firm ranked ≥ 5. To compute the difference between the coefficients, we subtract the Low Eco-Efficiency coefficient from the coefficient of the High 
Eco-Efficiency dummy. Ind.-adj. Q is the industry-adjusted Q. Sample period: 1997-Q1 – 2004-Q4. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level is indicated by  ***,  **, and  *,

5.3 Eco-Efficiency and Firm Value: Tests for a Time-Varying Market Response 
A positive (though potentially asymmetrical) relation between eco-efficiency and firm value 
is consistent with the notion that eco-efficiency is a “priced” factor, i.e., that investors drive 
up the value of environmental leaders by lowering their expected stock return and their cost-
of-capital. However, up to this point, the association between Tobin’s q and eco-efficiency 
does  not  reconcile  with  the  evidence  by  Derwall  et  al.  (2005)  that  eco-efficient  stock 
portfolios  have  realized  anomalously  high  risk-adjusted  returns  relative  to  their  least  eco-
efficient counterparts. Their results raise the possibility that the market has undervalued eco-
efficient firms relative to less eco-efficient companies. In an equilibrium setting, the expected 
returns on a group of eco-efficient companies can be lower than the returns on a group of less 
eco-efficient companies because eco-efficient firms are deemed less risky. After adjustment 
for these risk differences, there should be no abnormal difference in return. However, under 
the  hypothesis  that  the  market  reacts  to  eco-efficiency  with  a  drift,  firms  can  be  under-  or 
overvalued and risk-adjusted portfolio returns can be anomalous.  

The  Derwall  et  al.  (2005)  zero  investment  portfolio  of  the  most  eco-efficient  firms 
versus  the  least  eco-efficient  firms  earns  an  average  abnormal  return  in  the  order  of  2.2 
percent  to  8.6  percent  per  annum  depending  on  the  portfolio  construction  method  and  the 
performance attribution model used. By examining the sensitivity of Tobin’s q to corporate 
eco-efficiency under each separate cross-sectional regression, we can investigate whether the 
superior stock performance associated with eco-efficiency translates into a higher valuation 
over time for eco-efficient companies relative to their eco-inefficient counterparts. We could 
expect the abnormal returns associated with eco-efficient firms to induce an upward trend in 
their Tobin’s q values.  

To shed more light on the nature of the large return differential documented in Derwall 
et al. (2005), we now exploit the attractive features of the Tobin’s q measure and of the Fama-
MacBeth (1973) regression technique. First, we divide our sample period into two subperiods. 
Table  6,  which  reports  regression  results  for  Tobin’s  q  broken  up  into  two  subsamples, 
confirms our expectations. The table shows time-series average coefficients for the 1997-2000 
and 2001-2004 periods, respectively. The subsample results indicate a strong time variation in 
the difference between the coefficients on High Eco-Efficiency and Low Eco-Efficiency. In 
the  later  subperiod,  eco-efficient  companies  were  selling  at  a  premium  more  than  twice  as 
large as that in the earlier subperiod, consistent with a scenario that investors have changed 
their view on the value of eco-efficiency.

Eco-Efficiency and Firm Value: Subperiod Results 

TABLE 6 

Reported are the time-series mean coefficients and the t-statistics (in parentheses) of the difference between 
High Eco-Efficiency and Low Eco-Efficiency based on equation (4). Low Eco-Efficiency = 1 if firm ranked ≤ 
1. High Eco-Efficiency =1 if firm ranked ≥ 5. To compute the difference between the coefficients, we subtract 
the Low Eco-Efficiency coefficient from the coefficient of the High Eco-Efficiency dummy. The subperiods 
are 1997-Q1 to 2000-Q4 and 2001-Q1 to 2004-Q4. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level is indicated by

In  Table  7,  we  express  the  time-varying  market  response  to  eco-efficiency  by  estimating  a 
trend in the relation between eco-efficiency and Tobin’s q. More specifically, we perform a 
time-series  regression  using  the  differences  between  the  quarterly  estimates  of  the  cross-
sectional  coefficients  on  the  two  dummy  variables  (β0  High  Eco-Efficiency  -  β1  Low  Eco-
Efficiency)  as  the  dependent  variable  and  time  as  the  regressor.  To  account  for  potential 
autocorrelation, we compute t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) autocorrelation-robust 
standard errors3. Table 7, Panel A, reports the annual increases in valuation differential based 
on  the  specifications  described  in  Table  4,  whereas  Table  7,  Panel  B,  presents  those 
corresponding to Table 5. Independent of the specification, we find that the trend in valuation 
is  significantly  different  from  zero.  The  intercept  combined  with  the  time  coefficient 
demonstrate  that  although  eco-efficient  firms  were  not  selling  at  a  relative  premium  at  the 
beginning of the sample period, the premium increases strongly over time. Equally important 
is  the  economic  interpretation  of  the  trend.  Our  estimates  of  the  trend  range  between  2.8 
percent and 5 percent. These percentages resemble the abnormal returns outlined by Derwall 
et al. (2005).  
 
 

                                                           
3 Since Newey-West (1987) standard errors might be overstated for small samples, we compute in addition 
conventional standard errors. Our findings are similar and available upon request from the authors.

The subperiod results as well as the upward-sloping trend line support H2c. The time-varying 
pattern may indicate that the value of eco-efficiency is not well understood by capital markets. 
Although finding that environmental information is priced gradually seems to contradict the 
notion that markets are efficient, our study is not the first to show that some information about 
companies is slowly incorporated into stock prices. For example, there is evidence that stock 
repurchases (Ikenberry et al., 1995) and dividend omissions (e.g., Michaely et al., 1995), all of 
which are arguably more concrete events than environmental events, have a post-event drift.  
Our results raise the idea that investors can exploit temporary mispricing of corporate 
environmental performance criteria. At the very least, our results suggest the market shows 
increased interest in information about the environmental management of the firm.  

 
TABLE 7 

Trend in Eco-Efficiency Premium 

Based on the difference between β0 and β1 for each quarterly estimation of equation (4): Qit = αi + β0 High Eco-
Efficiencyit + β1 Low Eco-Efficiencyit + γit Xit + εit, we estimate the time trend: β0 - β1 = α + β2 timet + εt , where 
time  ranges  from  1  to  32.  We  compute  Newey-West  (1987)  adjusted  standard  errors.  Panel  A  reports  the 
coefficients of time and the corresponding t-statistics for all specifications shown in Table 4. Panel B shows the 
time trend coefficient and t-statistics for all estimations presented in Table 5. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and

6. Conclusion 
Can corporate environmental management be aligned with the economic objectives of a firm? 
This study provides new answers to this question. Focusing on the concept of eco-efficiency, 
we perform an extensive analysis on the relation between corporate eco-efficiency and several 
dimensions of financial performance. Using a large database containing monthly scores for 
the period December 1996 - December 2004, we find evidence suggesting that the virtues of a 
strong corporate eco-efficiency policy can be significant from a financial perspective. 

Our study points to a positive and slightly asymmetric relation between eco-efficiency 
and operating performance. Firms that are deemed eco-efficient have only a slightly superior 
return on assets than the control group. The least eco-efficient firms show strong operational 
underperformance. Overall, our findings strongly reject the notion expressed by CSR skeptics, 
that the benefits of adopting a strong environmental policy are unlikely to outweigh the costs. 
Our study provides new evidence of a positive and time-varying relation between eco-
efficiency and firm valuation as measured by Tobin’s q. An exploration into the time-varying 
sensitivities of firm value with respect to the eco-efficiency scores shows that environmental 
winner  companies  initially  did  not  trade  at  a  premium  relative  to  losers.  Over  time,  the 
valuation  differential  between  winners  and  losers  widened  substantially.  The  observed 
upward trend in relative firm valuation offers an explanation for recent evidence by Derwall 
et  al.  (2005).  This  trend  suggests  that  the  shares  of  most  eco-efficient  firms  relative  to  the 
least  eco-efficient  firms  were  initially  undervalued  but  later  experienced  an  upward  price 
correction. At the very least, Tobin’s q regression results suggest, that these days, the market 
assigns more value-relevance to environmental information about firms.  

We believe the results of this paper have implications for both managers and investors. 
Evidently, managers have little reason to worry that an environmental policy conflicts with 
the company’s primary financial objectives. Investors may interpret our results as evidence 
that corporate environmental performance is a potential source of information that helps them 
generate superior excess returns. As for these excess returns, an important avenue for further 
research  would  be  to  look  at  the  endurance  of  the  observed  upward  trend  in  the  valuation 
differential between environmental winners and losers.  

Hence,  although  this  study  asserts  that  the  observed  patterns  in  Tobin’s  q  reflect  a 
correction for undervaluation of eco-efficient companies, it is forced to leave some important 
questions unexplained. Will these patterns persist in the future? What does this imply about 
future shareholder returns?
