Abstract This article theoretically proposes and empiri-
cally veriﬁes an understudied issue in the business ethics
(BE) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature—
how moral degradation (MD) in a society inﬂuences the
relationship between BE or CSR and ﬁrm performance
(i.e., corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage).
Building on strategic choice theory, we propose that both
BE and CSR become more important in enhancing busi-
ness success when the perceived MD is heightened. Our
analysis of 300 ﬁrms operating in China statistically con-
ﬁrms our hypotheses: ﬁrst, under high MD, ﬁrms’
engagement in CSR results in higher corporate legitimacy
and competitive advantage, and second, their adherence to
ethical business codes leads to higher corporate legitimacy.
We conclude the article by outlining the implications for
both theory and practice.

Introduction

Unequivocally, many transitional economies are making
remarkable economic progress that is attributable to their
market-oriented reforms, heightened competition in dereg-
ulated sectors, and successful utilization of foreign direct
investment. As a parallel to this impressive economic pro-
gress, however,
transitional economies display rampant
moral degradation (MD) or demoralization—the process of
society’s progressive loss of or weakening of the moral and
ethical structures that have traditionally prevailed (Redfern
and Crawford 2004; Tam 2002; Vynoslavska et al. 2005).
Such demoralization is exempliﬁed by widespread sales of
counterfeit products and unsafe goods, unrestrained wasting
of
tax evasion,
fraudulent dealings, ubiquitous corruption, all manner of
plundering of state assets, the denial of shareholders’ rights,
and so forth (Harvey 1999; Wright et al. 2003).

resources, stock market manipulation,

In transitional economies, MD can complicate ﬁrms’
in ethical and social conduct. Maintaining
engagement
ethical codes and social responsibility is more challenging
because of the complicated moral conﬂicts and idiosyn-
cratic norm standards (Fulop et al. 2000). Will ﬁrms facing
immoral business environments still be able to create value
by engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR) to
fulﬁll their commitment to society? In a morally degraded
society, will maintaining business ethics (BE) remain
effective in specifying appropriate ﬁrm behaviors, provide
guidance for handling ethical ‘‘gray areas,’’ and achieve
business success? In this article, we propose a strategic
choice framework,
in conjunction with an empirical

analysis of 300 ﬁrms operating in China, to address these
questions. We theoretically hypothesize and empirically
verify how BE and CSR, separately and jointly, steer ﬁrms
toward achieving better performance in the long run, and
how MD inﬂuences the strength or direction of the effect of
BE or CSR on ﬁrm performance in transitional economies.
This article aims to advance the understanding of BE
and CSR in several ways. Our study is one among the ﬁrst
few to investigate the relationship between ethical behav-
iors and long-term ﬁrm performance with a consideration
of transitional economy-speciﬁc contingencies. We believe
such investigation is critical because ethical initiatives are
highly context-speciﬁc and strongly embedded in cultural
norms and social practices (Bailey and Spicer 2007; Pirsch
et al. 2007; Reidenbach and Robin 1990). Recent studies
have found that transitional economy ﬁrms with high social
credibility exhibit better short-term ﬁnancial and market
performance (e.g., Zhang and Rezaa 2009). However, areas
that remain under-researched are the questions of whether
social credibility contributes to long-term ﬁrm performance
in aspects such as corporate legitimacy and competitive
advantage, and how transitional economy-speciﬁc envi-
ronmental traits affect the links between social credibility
and business success. This article suggests that the strategic
choice logic is more appropriate for explicating the BE or
CSR and ﬁrm performance links in a morally degraded
environment. Instead of becoming isomorphic with the
pervasively immoral environment, as implied by institu-
tional
theory, ﬁrms in transitional economies adopt an
idiosyncratic strategic rationality to conduct ethically and
socially responsible actions, consistent with the strategic
choice perspective. In addition, examining the effects of
BE and CSR on corporate legitimacy and competitive
advantage in a morally degraded environment within the
same model allows us to compare these effects. Based on
this comparison, the decision makers can identify ways to
pursue ethical conduct in the most appropriate way, and to
more effectively redeploy critical resources and redeﬁne
the strategic decision making. This study may also assist
the government and public policy decision makers in
transitional economies to formulate more effective policy
schemes to stimulate ethical and responsible corporate
behavior.

Theoretical Framework

Background of MD

MD involves a society’s progressive loss of or weakening
of the moral and ethical standards that prevailed in the
social traditions (Luo 2008). It is different from ‘‘moral
panic,’’ which reﬂects the fear of a threat to the prevailing

123

social or cultural values (Cohen 1973). In a society suf-
fering from MD, people tend to tolerate, accept, and even
normalize immoral behaviors and perceptions. Degraded
morality, or a state of normlessness, provides fertile soil for
the growth of demoralized market arrangements (Jensen
2002). For example, Martin et al. (2007) demonstrate that
perceived pressure in a morally corrupt local environment
produces anomic strain and increases illicit activities such
as bribery. MD, along with extremely high levels of social
injustice and disparity in wealth derived from the unjust
social conditions, create a society that
is essentially
socially ill and ethically apathetic.

MD leads to institutional anomie. Institutions comprise
formal elements, such as political and economic rules
(North 1990), and informal elements, such as social norms
and conventions (Peng and Heath 1996). Accordingly, MD
not only weakens the power of the formal institutions but
also distorts the informal institutional ideology. First, MD
is a condition of normlessness and social disequilibrium
whereby the rules governing conduct have lost their force
(Merton 1968). Apressyan (1997) and Glinkina et al.
(2001) observe that, after Russia’s radical ‘‘shock therapy,’’
rampant corruption and organized crime have impaired the
government’s function and obstructed legitimate business
activities. Pressure to achieve economic goals by any
means—legitimate or not—displaces the normative control
mechanisms (Messner and Rosenfeld 2001). Firms that are
consistently involved in misconduct tend to be less con-
cerned about the impact of ethical or responsible social
behaviors on the public wellbeing, and on their own
development in the long run (Tam 2002). These malfeasant
behaviors are not only opportunistic, but in many cases are
also illegal and criminal (Baucus and Near 1991). The
calculating, utilitarian logic of the marketplace penetrates
the institutional realm and ultimately weakens the formal
institutional power.

Second, MD also distorts a society’s social norms and
ethical conventions. The MD permeating a society may
trigger a much more enduring and extensive inﬂuence on
informal social institutions. Durkheim (1966) suggests that
the informal institutional changes associated with mod-
ernization weaken the traditional norms and increase cul-
tural deviance and demoralization. The traditional cultural
values that shape business behaviors are changing or, more
speciﬁcally, are deteriorating. Harvey (1999) notes that the
traditional Chinese Confucian ethics proposes moral rules
such as ‘‘righteousness’’ and ‘‘sincerity,’’ emphasizes
commercial ethics that forbade the sale of poor quality
products and cheating in transactions, provides a strict
administrative system to regulate prices, quality, and
standards, and recommends punishment for those who
violated the regulations. When a social system lacks
appropriate commercial ethics or moral values, it incubates

a propensity for ﬁrms to use anomalous means to achieve
their desired ends without guilt.

As economic dominance has already become the pre-
valent social value and institutional form (Luo 2008),
economic achievements are assigned the highest priority,
so that when conﬂicts occur, noneconomic goals give way
to economic ones. Further, as personal relations (guanxi in
Chinese or blat in Russian) and corruption are often inti-
mately interlinked (Ledeneva 1998; Peng and Heath 1996;
Puffer 1994), regulation enforcement is arbitrary and cor-
rupt (Christmann and Taylor 2006; Glinkina et al. 2001).
This intertwinement increases the permeation of massive
corporate misconduct
(McKendall and Wagner 1997).
Even if they are caught violating the economic rules, these
unethical and opportunistic ﬁrms are not fearful, expecting
to use their corrupt connections to halt a governmentally
instituted investigation or to avoid the material penalty
imposed by judiciary authorities. Hence, in transitional
economies, the formal and informal institutional anomie
caused by moral deterioration offers a fresh context for
investigating the impact of ethical and social initiatives on
ﬁrm performance.

Theoretical Perspective

The investigation of the link between BE or CSR and ﬁrm
performance in a morally degraded society can be traced to
the classic debates about the relationship between institu-
tional pressure and organizational reaction. Institutional
theorists propose that
institutional pressure results in
organizational conformity to societal conventions for the
purpose of their acceptance and endorsement legitimacy
(Baucus 1994; Kostova et al. 2008; Scott 1995). DiMaggio
and Powell (1983) describe such conformity behavior as
the process of isomorphism that results from both formal
and informal pressure being exerted on organizations by
other organizations upon which they are dependent, and by
the cultural expectations of the society within which the
organizations function. Notwithstanding its substantial
implications, this perspective, however, overlooks the role
of a ﬁrm’s active reaction and resistance in organization–
environment relations (Oliver 1991; Powell 1985). Strate-
gic choice scholars, on the other hand, posit that ﬁrms are
not always the vulnerable receivers of institutional pressure
and expectations, but are often proactive analyzers of their
external environment and internal operations, and so are
able to make strategic choices (Ansoff 1987; Hofer and
Schendel 1978). Instead of being invariably passive and
conforming to all
institutional conditions, ﬁrms make
rational, idiosyncratic strategic choices to achieve their
intended goals (Luo 2011; Oliver 1991; Porter 1980).

Strategic choice theory is particularly relevant when
ﬁrms have a strategic intention to seek organizational

efﬁciency or control even in an unfavorable environment
(Hamel and Prahalad 1989; Montanari 1978). Strategic
choice theory presents a nondeterministic or voluntaristic
perspective to explain how ﬁrms strategically react to or
resist their external environmental forces (Ansoff 1987;
Child 1972; Whittington 1988). While the risks and ben-
eﬁts of engaging in ethical or socially responsible behavior
are determined, to a large extent, by external factors, it is
the internal factors related to ﬁrms and their managers that
would determine the strategic choice that a ﬁrm would take
in response to the external pressure (Christmann and
Taylor 2006; Fang et al. 2010). For example, Branzei et al.
(2004) suggest that, despite a record of abysmal environ-
mental actions in China, ﬁrms’ ethical strategies—such as
green strategy—are inspired by top managers with strong
ecological stewardship. By analyzing 141 MNE subunits
operating in China, Luo (2011) suggests that ﬁrms’ stra-
tegic rationality for becoming an ethically legitimate cor-
porate citizen outweighs the external pressure of becoming
isomorphic with such immoral practices as corruption.

Thus, guided by the strategic choice perspective, we
examine whether ﬁrms’ ethical initiatives (CSR and BE)
are strategic responses to the MD existing within a tran-
sitional economy. CSR and BE have been regarded as
effective strategies for improving organizational perfor-
mance over the long run (Baron 2001; Mcwilliams et al.
2002, 2006). CSR-focused businesses would proactively
promote value-creating activities (Mackey et al. 2007;
Margolis and Walsh 2003). As well, CSR provides guid-
ance for organizational decisions, which has beneﬁcial
rather than adverse effects on the pertinent stakeholders
with the goal of retaining the ﬁrm’s corporate identity and
enhance its social value (Brickson 2007; Whetten and
Mackey 2002). BE policies help to limit a ﬁrm’s legal
liability, and cater to the public favor by communicating
the perception of being a good corporate citizen. From an
instrumental perspective, formulating and implementing
ethical initiatives that satisfy the needs of the stakeholders
who control the key resources (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978)
will insure the long-term survival and success of the ﬁrm
(Freeman 1999; Hillman and Keim 2001).

We particularly focus on two long-term performance
indicators: corporate legitimacy and competitive advan-
tage. From the standpoint of theoretical implications, these
two dimensions represent different perspectives on the
means for evaluating a ﬁrm’s performance. Legitimacy is
vital for a ﬁrm’s survival, as it is a precondition for the
continuous ﬂow of resources and sustained support by the
ﬁrm’s environment (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978). Its com-
petitive advantage represents the ﬁrm’s ability to outper-
form its competitors in the same industry or market, and is
essential for ﬁrms that are attempting to stay ahead of the
present or potential competition (Porter 1985). Those ﬁrms

123

with high legitimacy appear to be preferable, proper, and
trustworthy, and are likely to gain more resources from
outside (Suchman 1995). Through such a pronounced
competitive advantage, ﬁrms acquire or develop a combi-
nation of unique attributes that allows them to outperform
their competitors (Palazzo and Scherer 2006; Porter 1985).

Hypotheses Development

CSR and BE are two related yet distinct concepts that
should be considered simultaneously when examining the
inﬂuence of moral initiatives on ﬁrm performance (e.g.,
Muller and Kolk 2010; Weaver et al. 1999). CSR, also
called corporate citizenship or sustainable responsible
business, represents the corporate behavioral disposition
toward the ﬁrm’s stakeholders, including the environment,
consumers, employees, and the public (Wood 1991). Ulti-
mately, ﬁrms that promote cutting-edge CSR signify that
they are socially responsible and economically sustainable
(Brammer and Pavelin 2006; Mcwilliams and Siegel 2001).
BE is deﬁned as ‘‘a collection of moral principles or a set
of values dealing with what is right and wrong, good or bad
that governs the behavior of a group or a member of a
group’’ (Saul 1981, p. 270). As indicated by comprehensive
internal policies and ethics programs, BE reﬂect ﬁrms’
value systems and moral orientation regarding the rightness
or wrongness of individual and organizational behaviors
(Heugens et al. 2008). Ethical issues broadly enfold the
rights and duties regarding a ﬁrm’s top management, the
employees, suppliers, customers, and policies, as well as its
ﬁduciary responsibility to its shareholders.

CSR activities can be easily observed and judged by
external parties, while BE reﬂects the implicit corporate
beliefs and values (Muller and Kolk 2010). However, ﬁrms
with well-designed and effectively implemented CSR
activities are not necessarily considered ethical, because
the aims of these ﬁrms’ CSR inquiries vary from stake-
holder- and performance- to motivation-driven (Basu and
Palazzo 2008). Ethical ﬁrms that emphasize CSR practices
tend to look beyond narrow economic returns to take
the wider social concerns into consideration (Jamali and
Mirshak 2007; Jones 1995). In addition, unless ethical
ﬁrms have adequate visibility of their CSR, it is difﬁcult for
them to demonstrate, in a noticeable way, their success in
satisfying their stakeholders’ needs (Fombrun and Shanley
1990; Zhang and Rezaa 2009). When a ﬁrm’s commitment
to CSR engagement and BE are both high, stakeholders
who possess relevant resources can be more certain that the
ﬁrm has fulﬁlled its responsibilities to society (Strong et al.
2001).

Organizational legitimacy, which is largely based on
public judgments about whether or not certain actions can
be considered socially acceptable, is particularly inﬂuenced

123

by the degree of ﬁrms’ ethical goodness (Mcwilliams and
Siegel 2001; Scherer and Palazzo 2011). Davis (1973) and
Sethi (1979) argue that ﬁrms that do not behave in a
manner deemed to be socially responsible tend to lose
legitimacy in the long run. Operating ethically and hon-
orably encourages best practices, establishes credibility,
and builds a reputation for impeccable integrity (Jones
et al. 2007; Muller and Kolk 2010). Fulﬁlling ethical
business principles (trust,
trustworthiness, and coopera-
tiveness) can help ﬁrms to build long-term shareholder
value and, hence, create a competitive advantage (Jones
1995). By proactively anticipating and addressing their
stakeholders’ concerns, ethical ﬁrms may be in a better
position to decrease the variability of their business returns
(Murray and Montanari 1986). We thus propose a com-
plementary effect of CSR and ethics on performance:

Hypothesis 1 CSR and BE jointly impose a stronger
positive inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance,
indicated by
(a) corporate legitimacy and (b) competitive advantage.

A ﬁrm’s idiosyncratic responses to institutional change
(e.g., from passivity and conformity to increasingly active
resistance) are strategic choices that depend upon the
strategic motives underlying organizational behaviors
(Oliver 1991). We argue that in a demoralized society, a
ﬁrm’s engagement in ethical initiatives is a strategic choice
reﬂecting the ﬁrm’s desire to obtain enduring legitimacy
and outperform its competitors. The recent contaminated
milk scandal in China serves as a typical example in this
regard. As the tainting of milk was an open secret within
the industry in China (Fairclough 2008), many ﬁrms pro-
duced contaminated infant milk powder
to generate
immediate proﬁts. The Sanlu Company itself was found to
have killed six and hospitalized about 300,000 children in
2008. Yet ﬁrms such as the Sanyuan Group, a Chinese
dairy producer based in Beijing, chose to maintain ethical
behavior through offering high-quality products. In spite of
other ﬁrms’ violation of the moral standards, procedures,
and expectations, ethical ﬁrms understand that the short-
term beneﬁts of misbehavior will be diluted and overridden
in the long run. They also know that the consequences of
illicit corporate acts may create evolutionary hazards,
strategic impediments, competitive disadvantages, and
organizational deﬁciencies (Luo 2004). After the scandal,
Sanyuan took over Sanlu and obtained an 87.2 % increase
in net proﬁt, generating 40.76 million RMB in 2008, while
other related guilty ﬁrms suffered a signiﬁcant performance
decline.

To enhance long-term performance, a ﬁrm’s strategic
rationale for becoming an ethically legitimate corporate
citizen will outweigh the pressure to become isomorphic
through engaging in external
immoral and corruptive
practices (Luo 2011). First, from an inter-organizational


Moral Degradation, Business Ethics, and Corporate Social Responsibility

409

perspective, ﬁrms that proactively maintain a high CSR
engagement and BE commitment are more likely to
maintain good relationships with their external stakehold-
ers (e.g., suppliers and customers) in a morally degrading
society. In a social environment that is morally degraded
and in which trust is missing, ﬁrms are reluctant to coop-
erate with those with low morality (Sullivan et al. 2007),
and customers mistrust the products or services provided
by ﬁrms with a history of ethical wrongdoing. For example,
in an analysis of 44 corporations from the USA and Ger-
many, Ehrgott et al. (2011) ﬁnd that social standards such
as market reputation and socially sustaining abilities are
important indicators for western ﬁrms in the selection of
emerging economy suppliers. In the case of China’s con-
taminated milk scandal, an alarmed and exasperated public
refused to continue to buy products from the guilty facto-
ries, and criticized the government for its weak enforce-
ment of quality inspections.

Second, from an intra-organizational perspective, in a
morally degrading society, corporate morality will be
reﬂected in a system of incentives and sanctions (i.e., the
rewards and punishments imposed on internal stakeholders
for certain behaviors). Through a process of self-selection,
moral internal stakeholders will tend to remain with ethi-
cal, responsible ﬁrms (Lee and Mitchell 1994) and avoid
opportunistic ones. Ethical ﬁrms will hence beneﬁt from
the internal stakeholders’ moral discretion and experience
reduced agency costs,
transaction costs, and the costs
associated with team production (Jones 1995). Also, the
internal moral stakeholders are more likely to honor their
responsibilities and commitments in their dealings with
their external
(e.g., customers, vendors,
shareholders, and the neighboring community). Further-
more, as Hemingway (2005) argues, the personal values of
moral internal stakeholders may motivate corporate social
entrepreneurship and, hence, bolster ﬁrm performance.

stakeholders

Finally, from an evolutionary perspective, ﬁrms with a
high fulﬁllment of moral responsibilities or obligations in a
morally degrading environment may succeed in inﬂuencing
environmental evolution in a direction favorable to their
current practices. Galang (2011) suggests that a ﬁrm’s
engagement in ethical initiatives can serve as a strategy for
inﬂuencing the political decision makers and reducing the
risk of regulatory interference. In addition, as their com-
petitors are struggling to adjust to impose moral standards
so that misconduct might be prevented, ﬁrms with existing
high standard strategic ethical
initiatives may further
reinforce their market values by identifying new needs of
the local society and by aligning their initiatives with those
new needs (Jenkins 2006). Firms with proactive CSR and
ethics will be rewarded with a good reputation, greater
social legitimacy, and a stronger competitive advantage
(Siltaoja 2006). We therefore suggest that:

Hypothesis 2 When the MD in society is higher, ﬁrms
with higher CSR will show better ﬁrm performance, indi-
cated by (a) corporate legitimacy and (b) competitive
advantage.

Hypothesis 3 When the MD in society is higher, ﬁrms
with stronger BE will show better ﬁrm performance, indi-
cated by (a) corporate legitimacy and (b) competitive
advantage.

Figure 1 graphically illustrates this study’s conceptual

framework.

Methods

Research Setting

This study uses primary data collected in China to test the
foregoing hypotheses. We focus on the empirical context of
China for the following two reasons. First, although MD in
the business environment is neither new nor unique to
China, China bears much of the bitter media criticism for
evidencing degraded moral standards through engaging in
such behaviors as product piracy or product safety and
quality issues. According to the China Securities Regula-
tory Commission (CSRC), from 2000 to 2010, 486 out of
the 1,706 listed ﬁrms were penalized for having committed
immoral behavior. Firms from China are also ‘‘regarded by
their peers as among the most corrupt when doing business
abroad’’ (Transparency International 2009, p. xxix). This
rampant corporate misconduct is, in part, a reﬂection of the
MD and normlessness in China (Luo 2008). Many Chinese
ﬁrms engaging in immoral activities may not feel guilty or
be fearful of the consequences of their behavior because
they often rely on corrupt interpersonal relationships or
guanxi to safeguard them. Apathy toward unlawful, illicit,
and immoral conduct for selﬁsh business interests indicates
social degradation in business.

Second, the unprecedented scope and pace of economic
development in China also brings more attention to the
constraints resulting from the relatively under-developed
BE and CSR. In recent years, China’s government and

industrial organizations have endeavored to establish ethics
ofﬁces, and to develop new ethical policies and mandatory
ethics training. After CSR guidelines were issued by the
Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges in 2006 and 2008,
respectively, China’s listed ﬁrms have been encouraged to
publish annual CSR reports. China thus serves as a typical
example of how MD inﬂuences the effects of BE and CSR
on ﬁrm performance.

Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang
Provinces). The average age of our sample ﬁrms was about
20 years, and the average number of employees was
around 4,000 per company. The ﬁrms were spread across
various industries, including electronics and telecommu-
nications (16.45 %), machinery industry (14.19 %), and
the service industry (13.87 %). Of these ﬁrms, 51.3 % were
foreign-investment ﬁrms, 24.3 % were state-owned, and
the rest were domestic private ﬁrms.

Data Collection

Our survey respondents are managers in China who are in
charge of or highly involved in their ﬁrm’s BE and CSR
activities. We initially designed our survey in English,
based on the previous relevant literature (e.g., Abbott and
Monsen 1979; Arthur 1984; Luo 2008). The original sur-
vey questionnaire was then translated into Chinese, and
cross-checked by professors of management and senior
doctoral students in China. It was further pre-tested for
instrument validity by 30 MBA students at a leading
business school in China who are familiar with BE and
CSR practices. Next, we assigned a doctoral student to re-
translate the Chinese survey into English, to insure con-
ceptual equivalence in line with Brislin’s (1970) criteria
(e.g., comparisons of meaning or predictions of similar
responses to the original or translated versions). We then
revised or reworded any questions or terms that were
considered ambiguous and difﬁcult to interpret.

We adopted a three-step approach to efﬁciently compile
representative samples. First, we identiﬁed 483 domestic
ﬁrms that have reported CSR and BE activities through
China InfoBank’s Listed Firms database in the last 5 years.
Second, we referred to the China foreign Enterprise Direc-
tory (2009) and consulted regional Associations of Enter-
prises with foreign investment, obtaining 335 foreign ﬁrms
engaging in CSR and BE activities in China. Third, our
questionnaires were posted or e-mailed to mid- or top-level
managers at the identiﬁed ﬁrms, and we formed ﬁve survey
teams to follow up the survey. Each team, consisting of four
trained members, was in charge of the survey in one region of
China (east, west, north, south, or central). These teams were
responsible for contacting the respondents, explaining any
unclear questions, facilitating feedback delivery, and dou-
ble-checking the accuracy of answers with respondents.

After eliminating all incomplete forms (i.e., those with
more than ﬁve missing values), we had obtained 300
completed questionnaires out of the 818 targeted ﬁrms (a
36.67 % response rate). We ruled out nonresponse bias by
conducting mean difference tests between responding and
nonresponding ﬁrms, with regard to the major ﬁrm attri-
butes such as ﬁrm age and employment size. The sample
ﬁrms were located in 17 different cities throughout China,
mainly in the regions of Beijing, Shenzhen, and the

Variables and Measurement

Table 1 depicts the detailed measurement of multiple-item
constructs and the factor analysis results. All constructs are
measured by a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(‘‘strongly disagree’’) to 5 (‘‘strongly agree’’). The ﬁrst
dependent variable, corporate legitimacy, is measured by
four items guided by the cognitive legitimacy arguments of
Suchman (1995), Oliver (1996), and Palazzo and Scherer
(2006). The four items separately evaluate the degree of a
ﬁrm’s external reputation, corporate image, corporate cit-
izenship, and social acceptance, as compared with its major
competitors. The variable indicates satisfactory reliability
and validity, with a Cronbach’s a of 0.91, convergent factor
loadings from 0.78 to 0.87, and communality estimates
from 0.75 to 0.86. Extending the concepts of Porter (1985)
and of Porter and Kramer (2006), the second dependent
variable, competitive advantage,
is measured by three
items: capturing a ﬁrm’s relative product or service
advantage, cost-effectiveness, and customer loyalty, versus
its major domestic competitors for comparison. The vari-
able also indicates satisfactory reliability and validity, with
a Cronbach’s a of 0.83, convergent factor loadings from
0.77 to 0.86, and communality estimates from 0.70 to 0.78.
Consistent with Abbott and Monsen (1979), we opera-
tionalize CSR by ﬁve items, according to the extent to which
a ﬁrm emphasizes (1) the supervision and improvement of its
product quality, (2) the welfare of its employees’ health and
safety, (3) the interests of its shareholders, (4) the creation of

protection. This variable shows acceptable reliability and
validity, with a Cronbach’s a of 0.78, convergent factor
loadings from 0.53 to 0.75, and communality estimates from
0.46 to 0.65. Derived from the arguments of Arthur (1984)
and Saul (1981), BE includes four items, highlighting a
ﬁrm’s overall and speciﬁc attitude toward the unethical
behavior of its employees, managers, and external partners,
respectively. This variable shows adequate reliability and
validity, with a Cronbach’s a of 0.85, convergent factor
loadings from 0.75 to 0.86, and communality estimates from
0.66 to 0.79.

All bold factor loadings are signiﬁcant at 0.05 level

measurement of MD. Speciﬁcally, we ask the respondents to
evaluate separately the level of immorality or misconduct, in
both formal and informal institutions, 10 years ago and
currently. Both variables demonstrate excellent reliability
and validity (a Cronbach’s a greater than 0.89, convergent
factor loadings from 0.76 to 0.89, and communality esti-
mates from 0.64 to 0.86). We then calculate the immorality
difference via a mean current score deducted from the mean
score of 10 years ago. All immorality difference scores are
positive, conﬁrming the existence of MD. We then used the
immorality difference score as the ﬁnal measurement of MD:
the greater the score, the larger the MD.

In order to exclude confounding effects, we controlled
for several variables that, according to the previous liter-
ature, may inﬂuence ﬁrm performance. Firm age is the
natural logarithm of years of operation. Firm size is mea-
sured by a four-point Likert item based on the ﬁrm’s rel-
ative assets compared with its peers in the same industry,
and this industry-adjusted measure helps us to rule out the
unbalanced asset scale across different industries. We also
included two ownership dummy variables: SOE (State-
owned enterprise) and foreign-invested enterprise, with
private ﬁrms as the reference group. Finally, we added an
industry dummy variable (manufacturing sector), with a

value of 1 indicating that the ﬁrm belongs to the manu-
facturing sector, and a value of 0 indicating otherwise.

Validity and Common Method Variance Check

We adopted both pre- and post-procedures to minimize the
possible threat of validity and common method variance,
following the recommendations of Chang et al. (2010). We
designed our survey with varying styles of question formats
and Likert scales. As part of the larger survey, the variables
used in this study are structurally placed in signiﬁcantly
different sections. Also, most of the items used in this study
were related to factual information or environments. In the
post-survey stage, we sent the same questionnaires to 25
randomly selected managers who had responded to the
early round. The correlation analysis exhibited strong
consistency between the surveyed items for both time
periods (p \ 0.01). We ﬁnally conducted Harman’s single-
factor test (Podsakoff et al. 2003), then entered all of the
survey items into the analysis and allowed them to load
onto a single factor. The model demonstrated a very poor
ﬁt (v2[252] = 3,268.84, incremental ﬁt index [IFI] = 0.35,
comparative ﬁt
index [CFI] = 0.34, standardized root-
mean-square residual [SRMR] = 0.22).

(v2[236] = 643.30,

In order to check the convergent and discriminant
validity further, we undertook a very small number of
conﬁrmatory factor analyses. As recommended by Hu and
Bentler (1999) and Kline (2004), the cutoff scores for good
model ﬁt are 0.08 for SRMR, and 0.90 for CFI and IFI. Our
hypothesized six-factor model provided adequate ﬁt
indexes
IFI = 0.91, CFI = 0.91,
SRMR = 0.05). We then compared our six-factor model
with two alternative ﬁve-factor models. A ﬁve-factor
model with BE and CSR collapsed into one scale provided
poorer
IFI = 0.86,
CFI = 0.86, SRMR = 0.06). Another ﬁve-factor model
with corporate legitimacy and CSR collapsed into one scale
also yielded a poorer ﬁt (v2[242] = 1,034.54, IFI = 0.83,
CFI = 0.83, SRMR = 0.08). The above efforts and results
suggest that the convergent and discriminant validity are
satisfactory in this study.

Results

The descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation matrix
are reported in Table 2. To test our hypotheses, we per-
formed un-standardized multiple regression analyses with
seven models for (a) corporate legitimacy and (b) compet-
itive advantage. The estimated results for corporate legiti-
macy are presented in Table 3, and the results for
competitive advantage are shown in Table 4. The correla-
tion among the independent variables and the other diag-
nostic tests that we conducted suggests that there is no
threat of multi-collinearity (maximum VIF is 1.88 in both
Models 7a and b). For all regressions, we report a robust
standard error
to address the heteroscedasticity issue
(White 1980).

Models 1a and b are baseline models that include only
control variables. Model 1a shows that corporate size

(b = 0.15, p \ 0.01), manufacturing sector
(b = 0.20,
p \ 0.05), and foreign ownership (b = 0.34, p \ 0.01)
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on corporate legitimacy. These
results suggest that it might be easier for large ﬁrms, for-
eign ﬁrms, and manufacturing ﬁrms to obtain legitimacy in
China. Model 1b indicates that state-owned ﬁrms tend to
have fewer competitive advantages (b = -0.28, p \ 0.10).
The other control variables are not statistically signiﬁcant.
Models 2a and b test for the main effects of CSR and BE.
The results suggest that a ﬁrm’s CSR engagement is pos-
itively associated with its corporate legitimacy and com-
petitive advantage (b = 0.41, 0.24; p \ 0.001, 0.05).
Similarly, a ﬁrm’s BE are also positively related to its
corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage (b = 0.18,
0.21; p \ 0.01). In Models 3a and b, we add the interaction
term of the two variables to test for their joint effects on
corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage. The joint
effects of CSR and BE are signiﬁcant and positive
(b = 0.09, 0.10; p \ 0.05), suggesting that the positive
main effects are strengthened. Compared with the main
effect models, both Models 3a and b explain a signiﬁcantly
greater amount of variance between the ﬁrm performance
indicators (DR2 = 0.02, 0.02; Hierarchical F = 4.15, 4.26;
p \ 0.05), suggesting that CSR and BE, jointly, have a
greater positive effect on both corporate legitimacy and
competitive advantage. Following Aiken and West (1991),
we further plotted the joint effects of CSR and BE on ﬁrm
performance as a robust test. As Fig. 2 indicates, both plots
demonstrate that high CSR activities together with high BE
exert a far greater inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance. Hence,
both H1a and b are conﬁrmed.

In Models 4a and b, we tested the main effect of MD.
The negative coefﬁcients of MD in these two models imply
that there exists a negative relationship between MD and
ﬁrm performance. Models 5a and b report the moderating
effects of MD on the relationship between CSR and ﬁrm

performance. The results show that MD signiﬁcantly
strengthens both the positive link between CSR and cor-
porate legitimacy (b = 0.12, p \ 0.001), and the positive
link between CSR and competitive advantage (b = 0.12,
p \ 0.01). Compared with Models 4a and b, both Models
5a and b explain a signiﬁcantly greater amount of variance
(DR2 = 0.02,
8.35;
p \ 0.001, 0.01). Hypotheses 2a and b are thus strongly
supported. That is, when the MD is higher, CSR will have a
stronger positive effect on ﬁrm performance with respect to
both corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage.

0.02; Hierarchical F = 12.00,

H3a and b propose that, when the MD in society is higher,
ﬁrms with a stronger BE commitment will show better ﬁrm
performance. Accordingly, in Models 6a and b, we tested the
moderating effects of MD on the relationship between BE
and ﬁrm performance. The results suggest that MD fortiﬁes
the positive link between BE and corporate legitimacy
(b = 0.13, p \ 0.001). The link between BE and competi-
tive advantage, however, is strengthened but not statistically
(b = 0.08, p [ 0.10). As a result, H5a is
signiﬁcant

supported, but H5b is not. Models 7a and b are the full models
that incorporate all of the main effects and the interacting
effects. The two full models have signiﬁcant hierarchical
F values (Hierarchical F = 8.11, p \ 0.001; Hierarchical
F = 4.26, p \ 0.05), suggesting that, together, these two
groups of moderating effects explain most of the variance in
ﬁrm performance.

In a similar procedure, we plotted as a robustness check
all of the interaction effects between MD and ethical ini-
tiatives. In Fig. 3, we plotted the moderating effect of MD
on the relationship between CSR and ﬁrm performance.
When there is high MD, the slopes of CSR are far steeper
for both corporate legitimacy and competitive advantage.
This further conﬁrms H4a and b—that under high MD,
CSR becomes more important
in enhancing corporate
legitimacy and competitive advantage. In Fig. 4, we plot-
ted the moderating effect of MD on the relationship
between BE and ﬁrm performance. Figure 4a shows that
when MD is high, the increase in BE will impose a greater
inﬂuence on corporate legitimacy, conﬁrming H5a. However,

in Fig. 4b the two lines are approximately parallel, suggest-
ing that MD has no inﬂuence on the relationship between BE
and competitive advantage. Hence, H5b is not supported,
suggesting that the association between BE and a ﬁrm’s
competitive advantage is not altered by MD in society. While
the reason for this is unclear, future study is encouraged to
investigate whether different dimensions of BE have differ-
ent interaction effects when accompanied by MD.

Discussion

In spite of making dramatic economic progress, transitional
economies are also found to be characterized as having
widespread unethical business conduct and being destruc-
tively opportunistic in their transformation from planned
economies to market economies. Recognizing the preva-
lence of MD in transitional economies, we explore an
under-researched issue in the BE and CSR literature—how
MD in a society moderates the effects of BE and CSR on
ﬁrm performance. By theoretically developing and empir-
ically validating an integrated strategic choice logic, we

suggest that ﬁrms strategically decide how they ought to
behave in a demoralized environment. Consistent with
prior studies, we found signiﬁcant main effects of BE and
CSR on long-term ﬁrm performance (e.g., corporate
legitimacy and competitive advantage), both separately and
jointly. Moreover, we demonstrate that, under high MD,
ethical indicatives steered by ﬁrms’ strategic rationalities
will exert stronger positive effects on both corporate
legitimacy and competitive advantage.

This study makes several contributions to the literature
on BE and CSR in a transitional economy context. First,
while increasing attention has been accorded to ethical
initiatives, very little is known of the practice of CSR and
BE in transitional economies. Several studies have touched
on the effects of CSR or BE in transitional economies (e.g.,
Fulop et al. 2000; Ozen and Kuskii 2009; Zhang and Rezaa
2009), yet none has explored these effects simultaneously,
nor has any study taken into account the speciﬁc contin-
gencies of transitional economies. A theoretical framework
for ﬁrms in transitional economies’ ethical behaviors must
incorporate the diverse, heterogeneous nature of the sur-
rounding context and the ﬁrms’ awareness of and

123

capability to play with this complexity. This study repre-
sents one such original attempt, in that it provides a sys-
tematic inquiry into ethical initiatives under the MD and
ethical paralysis of a society.

Second, as BE and CSR are culturally deﬁned (Jamali and
Neville 2011), this study offers scholars a unique perspective
from which to explain and predict the ethical behavior of
transitional economy ﬁrms operating in moral degraded
environments. MD is rampant in transitional economies (Chan
et al. 2002; Harvey 1999; Husters 2003) but extant research on
MD is rare. Societal degradation could signiﬁcantly increase
the transaction costs, operational uncertainties, and manage-
rial difﬁculties related to the planning, organization, and
implementation of legitimate business activities (Luo 2011).
According to institutional theory, ﬁrms would be expected to
respond to external institutions, including social norms, in a
similar or convergent manner. By contrast, our results suggest
that such misconduct can neither help ﬁrms to maintain their
long-term legitimacy, nor can it aid them in obtaining a sus-
tainable competitive advantage. We further argue that ﬁrms’

Fig. 3 Moderating effect of MD on the relationship between CSR
and ﬁrm performance

engagement in ethical initiatives in morally degraded envi-
ronments is a strategic, voluntary choice. That is, ﬁrms have
their own strategic intents and considerations in such an
environment. Firms exhibiting higher levels of CSR and BE
will be perceived by the society even more positively when
societal MD increases. In other words, strategically and
socially conscious ﬁrms see value-generating opportunities in
a morally degraded environment by displaying increased,
rather than decreased, CSR and BE to showcase their unique
care for, and contribution to, society. These ﬁrms understand
that organizational legitimacy and related returns improve not
by blindly mimicking popular but problematic social norms
such as MD, but by realizing and beneﬁting from stronger, not
weaker, contributions of CSR and BE to ﬁrm performance. In
our view, CSR and BE become more, not less, valuable (thus
contributing further to ﬁrm performance) when the moral
norms in the society are more severely degraded, because the
society will attach greater value to ﬁrms that are trustworthy
and socially conscious.

context of a pre-existing social structure, which is governed
by a set of norms and/or rules that are distinct from those of
other social structures (Giddens 1995). As ethical business
behavior is becoming increasingly important and as ethical
questions are gaining more signiﬁcance globally,
is
that ﬁrms maintain an attitude of ethical con-
critical
sciousness, even under the pressure and prevalence of
unethical practices in transitional economies. After all, a
ﬁrm’s central aim in the social structure is to eventually
become an ethically responsible, organizationally compe-
tent entity (Giddens 1995).

Conclusion

Evidence of unethical and irresponsible business practices in
the wake of the transformation of transitional economies into
market economies has been widely reported in the academic
literature in the management ﬁeld. In line with this newly
recognized phenomenon, this article addresses some of the
deﬁciencies in the existing CSR and BE literature by
investigating how CSR and BE inﬂuence ﬁrm performance
under an environment of MD. The primary purpose of this
study was to explicate the concept of MD to shed new light on
the ethical behavior of ﬁrms in transitional economies. We
found that a ﬁrm will perform better when it has high BE and
CSR, and that such a positive effect on performance is even
stronger when the ﬁrm operates in an environment that is
perceived to contain higher levels of MD. With a compre-
hensive understanding, business theorists and executives can
better discern the moral behavior of ﬁrms operating in
transitional economies, and determine the conditions in
which ﬁrms are more likely to reap the rewards from
investing in CSR and emphasizing BE.

In general, by examining the moderating role of MD this
study provides a platform for future research in BE and
CSR in transitional economies. First, our results, being
based on a single country—China—may not be completely
generalizable to other transitional economies; multiple-
country research will indicate how far our proposed stra-
tegic choice mechanism may extend. Second, our study
only examines the consequences of ethical initiatives under
MD. Future studies might explore the antecedents of CSR
and BE in a morally degraded society—that is, open the
‘‘black box’’ of the strategic ethical decision-making pro-
cess. Third, it is also enlightening to assess the effects of
various CSR and BE dimensions (domains, principles, or
processes) on MD to determine whether there exists any
heterogeneity among these ethical initiatives. Empirically,
MD is a demoralized process in a time series. We use
10-year changes in societal morality as a proxy for MD.
However, this operationalization is still far from portraying
the full process of morality change and its corresponding

123

corporate legitimacy

Finally, while previous studies based on advanced
economies are inconclusive in terms of the beneﬁts that
ﬁrms may obtain from ethical
initiatives (Arlow and
Gannon 1982; Mcwilliams and Siegel 2000), our study,
being based on a transitional economy with high levels of
MD, provides strong evidence of a positive link between
BE or CSR and ﬁrm performance. This ﬁnding implies that
in a society with low levels of MD, such as advanced
economies, ethical consciousness and CSR activities are
generally regarded as a basic or standard way of conduct-
ing business; hence, the direct correlation between ethical
initiatives and ﬁrm performance may not be profound. To
the contrary, in transitional economies with widespread
misconduct, BE and CSR become ﬁrms’ scarce resources
and competence, underpinned by managerial discretion,
and will, therefore, exert a signiﬁcant and positive inﬂu-
ence on ﬁrm legitimacy and competitive advantage. This
ﬁnding also corresponds to the social structuration logic
wherein organizational actions are performed within the

inﬂuence in a continuous manner. We hope that a future
longitudinal study will address this limitation.
