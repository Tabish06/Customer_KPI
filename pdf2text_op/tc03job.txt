Summary

Scholars have suggested that a ﬁrm’s reputation can provide it with a competitive advantage
by attracting more, and possibly higher-caliber, applicants. No research has actually investi-
gated this relationship, however, in large part because researchers have not assessed applicant
pool characteristics but instead have measured applicants’ intentions. Therefore, we con-
ducted two studies to investigate whether organizational reputation inﬂuenced the number
and the quality of applicants actually seeking positions with ﬁrms. Company reputation
was operationalized using two different published reputation measures, and applicant quality
data were obtained from career services ofﬁces at business schools at two universities. Results
from both studies supported the previously untested belief that ﬁrms with better reputations
attract more applicants. Furthermore, some evidence suggested that ﬁrms with better reputa-
tions could select higher-quality applicants. Copyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Introduction

Evidence is beginning to accumulate that ﬁrms’ human resource practices affect organizational perfor-
mance (Becker, Huselid, & Ulrich, 2001; Delery & Shaw, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Lado & Wilson, 1994;
Pfeffer, 1998). As noted by Taylor and Collins (2000), recruitment is one of the most important elements
of human resource management because it inﬂuences applicant pool characteristics and thus deﬁnes the
set of individuals who will be inﬂuenced by all subsequent human resource practices. Organizations that
attract more qualiﬁed applicants obtain greater utility in their selection systems and a potential compe-
titive advantage (Highhouse et al., 1999; Jackson & Schuler, 1990; Lado & Wilson, 1994; Leonard,
1999; Murphy, 1986; Rynes, 1991). Perhaps not surprisingly, organizations are realizing the importance
of attracting top-quality applicants for organizational success and are thus devoting more resources
toward recruitment efforts (Leonard, 1999). Similarly, organizational scholars also have devoted more
effort toward understanding recruitment efforts, as indicated by several recent reviews of the literature
(Breaugh & Starke, 2000; Cable & Turban, 2001; Highhouse & Hoffman, 2001; Rynes & Cable, 2003).
Scholars have suggested that a ﬁrm’s reputation, deﬁned as the public evaluation of a ﬁrm relative
to other ﬁrms, should inﬂuence its success in attracting quality applicants (Cable & Turban, 2001;
Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). In fact, some research suggests that job seekers’ decisions

to pursue jobs with organizations are based largely on their overall perceptions of organizational repu-
tation (Belt & Paolillo, 1982; Gatewood, Gowan, & Lautenschlager, 1993; Highhouse et al., 1999).
Somewhat surprisingly, however, existing research on this topic is inconclusive because applicants
reported their attraction or intentions toward a ﬁrm but their actual attempts to pursue employment
were not assessed (Barber, 1998; Gatewood et al., 1993). Furthermore, because much of the recruit-
ment research has examined attraction and intentions rather than application decisions, scholars have
called for research investigating whether organization-level variables affect applicant pool character-
istics (Barber, 1998; Breaugh & Starke, 2000; Rynes & Cable, 2003; Taylor & Collins, 2000). As noted
by these scholars, because much recruitment research has used cross-sectional survey methodologies,
we know very little about factors inﬂuencing a ﬁrm’s applicant pool, although the size and quality of a
ﬁrm’s applicant pool is, arguably, the most important measure of recruitment success. Thus, we extend
previous research by investigating how ﬁrm reputation—an organization-level characteristic—inﬂu-
ences the size and quality of the applicant pool.

Research investigating the effects of ﬁrm reputation on application decisions seems particularly
important in view of evidence that the recruitment process does little to change applicants’ perceptions
of ﬁrms (Lawler, Kuleck, Rhode, & Sorensen, 1975; Powell & Goulet, 1996; Turban, 2001). Moreover,
little is known about factors that inﬂuence job seekers’ knowledge about potential employers and the
consequences of such knowledge (Cable & Turban, 2001). Nonetheless, some evidence indicates that
job seekers’ perceptions of ﬁrms as employers are related to perceptions of the ﬁrm’s product image,
proﬁtability of the ﬁrm, and product advertisements (Cable & Graham, 2000; Cable, Aiman-Smith,
Mulvey, & Edwards, 2000; Highhouse et al., 1999). Furthermore, although research has begun to
investigate how job seekers’ reputation perceptions inﬂuence job pursuit intentions (Cable & Turban,
in press), no research has investigated whether reputation inﬂuences actual application decisions,
which is the focus of this study.

To summarize, there is good reason to expect that ﬁrms with better reputations attract larger and
higher-quality applicant pools, and scholars have argued that we need behavioral evidence about such
relationships (e.g., Barber, 1998). The present study extends the literature in three ways: (1) by obtain-
ing objective measures of ﬁrm reputation; (2) by measuring applicants’ actual decisions, which allows
an examination of ﬁrms’ applicant pools; and (3) by examining objective and veriﬁable measures of
applicant quality. We next draw upon social identity theory, signaling theory, and expectancy theory
to consider why ﬁrms with more positive reputations should be perceived as more attractive employers
by potential applicants, and therefore attract more and higher-quality applicants than ﬁrms with less
positive reputations.

Theoretical Background

Corporate reputation has been deﬁned as a perceptual representation of a ﬁrm’s overall appeal com-
pared to other leading rivals (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72). In general, a ﬁrm’s reputation is inﬂuenced by
factors such as ﬁnancial performance, company size, media exposure, advertising expenditures, and
type of industry (Cable & Graham, 2000; Fombrun, 1996). Theoretically, a positive reputation is valu-
able because it can provide information to a ﬁrm’s constituents such as consumers, investors, and
potential applicants (Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Although Fombrun (1996) sug-
gested that ﬁrms develop more or less reputational capital, which is a form of intangible wealth similar
to what marketers call brand equity (e.g., Keller, 1993), we know of no research that has investigated
the effects of reputation on decisions to apply for a job. Nonetheless, both social identity theory and

signaling theory offer rationales for why applicants should be interested in organizational reputation,
and be more attracted to ﬁrms with positive (versus negative) reputations.

Social identity theory suggests that individuals classify themselves into social categories based on
group membership (such as the organization they work for), and that these social categories inﬂuence
individuals’ self-concepts (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994; Tajfel &
Turner, 1985). Thus, people’s self-concepts are inﬂuenced, in part, by the attributes that others may
infer about them based on their organizational membership (Dutton et al., 1994; Hogg & Terry, 2000).
Because corporate reputation reﬂects an organization’s social status and provides information about
how well the organization is perceived relative to its competitors, organizational afﬁliation reﬂects
social status on members of the organization as well as potential members (i.e., job applicants) (Dutton
& Dukerich, 1991). We therefore expect that because ﬁrms with positive reputations are seen as pro-
viding enhanced self-esteem to organizational members, such ﬁrms will attract more applicants than
ﬁrms with less positive reputations.

Signaling theory also is relevant for understanding how a ﬁrm’s reputation may inﬂuence job applica-
tion decisions. Signaling theory suggests that because applicants do not have complete information about
an organization, they interpret available information as signals about the organization’s working condi-
tions (Breaugh, 1992; Rynes, 1991). It is very difﬁcult for job seekers to acquire substantial information
about many aspects of jobs prior to actually working in the organization (Rynes, 1991; Schwab, Rynes,
& Aldag, 1987; Spence, 1974), particularly in the earliest stages of recruitment when job seekers must
decide which jobs to apply for and which jobs to remove from consideration. Thus, job seekers may use
ﬁrms’ reputations as signals that provide information about working conditions in the organization.

Some empirical evidence supports the theoretical rationales described above, such that job seekers
report they are more likely to pursue jobs at ﬁrms with better reputations (Belt & Paolillo, 1982;
Gatewood et al., 1993). For example, in an experimental study, Belt and Paolillo (1982) found that
subjects reported they would be more likely to apply for a job as a restaurant manager when the fast
food ﬁrm had a more favorable corporate image. Similarly, Gatewood et al. (1993) found that subjects’
ratings of corporate image were strongly related to the reported probability of applying for a position
with the ﬁrm. Furthermore, ﬁrms with greater corporate social performance (i.e., ﬁrms that engage in
more socially responsible activities) were perceived as more attractive employers than ﬁrms with
lower corporate social performance (Bauer & Aiman-Smith, 1996; Turban & Greening, 1997).
Although corporate social performance is not identical to overall reputation, such results nevertheless
suggest that ﬁrms with more positive reputations will be perceived favorably as employers.

As Barber (1998) noted in her review of the recruitment literature, research is needed that uses ﬁrms’
applicant pool characteristics as dependent variables. Perhaps due to methodological challenges, most
recruitment studies to date have measured job seekers’ intentions to apply for a job rather than actual
application decisions. As described by Rynes (1991), indicating one’s intentions to apply for a job is a
‘costless’ exercise whereas actually pursuing a position involves costs in terms of time, emotion, and
effort. Thus, we extend previous research by examining the impact of ﬁrm reputation on the ﬁrm’s appli-
cant pool. Drawing on propositions from social identity theory and signaling theory, we expect that ﬁrms
with more positive reputations will attract larger applicant pools than ﬁrms with less positive reputations.

Hypothesis 1: Firm reputation will be positively related to the number of applicants seeking
employment with the ﬁrm.

We next theorize that a ﬁrm’s reputation will inﬂuence the quality of applicants seeking employment
with the ﬁrm. As suggested by Rynes (1989), expectancy theory predicts that applicants are more
likely to pursue job alternatives when the job is perceived positively (high valence) and when the
job is seen as attainable (expectancy). Thus, while all applicants should be more attracted to ﬁrms with
excellent reputations, some applicants may perceive difﬁculty obtaining a job at such ﬁrms if they are

seen as highly selective. Given a reduced likelihood of obtaining a job in a ﬁrm with a very positive
reputation, expectancy theory suggests a matching process based on quality, such that more qualiﬁed
applicants should be more likely than less qualiﬁed applicants to invest their limited time and resources
pursuing ﬁrms with the best reputations (Rynes & Lawler, 1983; Rynes, 1991; Wanous, Keon, &
Latack, 1983). This matching process has not been examined in the context of organizational
reputation, perhaps due to the fact that past research has assessed applicant intentions, and thus has
not incorporated the notion of opportunity costs (Rynes, 1991). However, this process is consistent
with person–organization ﬁt research (Kristof, 1996), and some researchers have suggested that appli-
cants with higher-grade point averages are more selective in their job search process (Cable & Judge,
1994; Judge & Bretz, 1992). Thus, we extend the literature by examining whether ﬁrm reputation is
related to the quality of applicants who seek employment with that ﬁrm.

Hypothesis 2: Firm reputation will be positively related to the quality of applicants who seek
employment with the ﬁrm.

Above we theorized that ﬁrms with more positive reputations would attract more applicants (Hypothesis
1), and higher-quality applicants (Hypothesis 2) than ﬁrms with less positive reputations. If either of
these effects occur (i.e., reputable ﬁrms attract a larger and/or better applicant pool), then reputable ﬁrms
should have higher-quality interviewees, assuming that they can convert applicants into interviewees.
For example, ﬁrms with a larger applicant pool can be more selective in choosing whom to interview,
which, all else being equal, will result in higher-quality interviewees. Similarly, ﬁrms with higher-quality
applicants are expected to be able to turn these applicants into interviewees. Thus, we expect that more
reputable ﬁrms can be more selective in whom they interview and, thus, invest resources.

Hypothesis 3: Firm reputation will be positively related to the quality of applicants who are inter-
viewed by the ﬁrm.

To test these hypotheses, we conducted two independent studies in two locations and used different but
comparable measures of ﬁrm reputation and applicant pool characteristics. In addition, in both studies
we controlled for industry, interview date, and number of jobs available at ﬁrms in the regression ana-
lyses, which we expected would inﬂuence the size and quality of the applicant pool. We controlled for
industry based on evidence that the industry in which a ﬁrm operates inﬂuences job seekers’ reputation
perceptions (e.g., Cable & Graham, 2000). Next, due to satisﬁcing and anchoring and adjustment biases,
ﬁrms recruiting later in the recruitment season may have fewer applicants and lower-quality applicants
(e.g., Power & Aldag, 1985). However, no research has investigated the effects of interview timing,
perhaps reﬂecting the fact that applicant pool characteristics have rarely been investigated. In our ana-
lyses we used interview date to control for recruitment timing effects on applicant pool characteristics.
Finally, we control for the number of jobs available at each ﬁrm, because ﬁrms hiring for more jobs
should be more attractive from an expectancy theory perspective, thus attracting more applicants.

Study Overview

We conducted two studies to investigate whether organizational reputation inﬂuenced the number
and the quality of applicants seeking positions with ﬁrms. Company reputation was operationalized
using different published reputation measures (e.g., Business Week, Fortune, Working Mother and

The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America), and applicant quality data were obtained from
career services ofﬁces at business schools at two relatively large state universities.

Study 1 Setting and Application Process
The applicant data used in Study 1 were obtained from the career services ofﬁce in the College of
Business at the University of Missouri. The data were collected during the 1998–1999 academic
year, which in general was a relatively strong labor market for college graduates. The participants
in Study 1 were mostly undergraduates who had no full-time work experience and were seeking
their ﬁrst professional position. Most of the employers who recruited at the careers services ofﬁce
were seeking employees for positions located in the region (i.e., the Midwest).

The career services ofﬁce uses a ‘job posting/pre-screening’ process where employers list their
positions (i.e., provide a job description) before coming to campus to interview applicants. Appli-
cants apply for the position by submitting a standardized re´sume´ to the employer. The employer
screens the standardized re´sume´s and subsequently selects some applicants for an initial campus
interview. Using archival data from the career services ofﬁce, we obtained information about which
applicants applied for a job (i.e., applicants who submitted their standardized re´sume´) and which
applicants were actually interviewed by a ﬁrm.

Study 2 Setting and Application Process
For the second study, we collected data from the MBA career services ofﬁce at the University of
North Carolina (UNC) during the 2000–2001 academic year, which was a relatively good market
for graduates, although the economy was not as strong as it was when the data were collected for
Study 1. The University of North Carolina has a relatively large MBA program that is consistently
rated as one of the top 25 MBA programs in the country. Thus, its graduates are sought by many
employers, and employers from around the United States recruit at the business school. In general,
participants in Study 2 had an average of 5 years of full-time work experience.

The careers services ofﬁce at UNC uses a ‘bid point’ system in which graduating MBA students are
given 500 non-replenishable ‘bid points’ at the beginning of the semester and these points are used to
obtain interviews with companies. Speciﬁcally, MBA students who want to interview with a certain
company must ‘outbid’ other students for an interview slot. The bidding process is conﬁdential,
although students do have access to the average number of points bid the previous year for each
recruiting company. Failure to outbid other job seekers for a given organization excludes that com-
pany as a possibility (unless an applicant is invited for an interview by the company independently).

Method: Study 1

Procedure

Data were obtained from a career services ofﬁce in the College of Business at a large midwestern uni-
versity during the 1998–1999 academic year. More speciﬁcally, we collected data about (1) which
companies interviewed on campus, (2) which students applied for interviews with the company, and
(3) which students actually interviewed with the company. We collected data from all companies that
used the career services ofﬁce except for the accounting ﬁrms, which used a different recruitment
process.

This career services ofﬁce uses a ‘job posting/pre-screening’ process where employers list their
positions (i.e., provide a job description) before coming to campus to interview applicants. Applicants
can apply for the position by submitting a standardized re´sume´ to the employer. The employer screens
the standardized re´sume´s and subsequently selects some applicants for an initial campus interview.
Thus, using archival data from the career services ofﬁce, we obtained information about which appli-
cants applied for a job (i.e., applicants who submitted their standardized re´sume´) and which applicants
actually were interviewed by a ﬁrm.

We were able to collect information about applicants and interviewees from 150 job postings during
the recruitment season. For each job posting we collected information about the number of interview
schedules (i.e., the number of recruiters who would be available on a given day to interview applicants)
as well as the date of the initial campus interview. The 150 job postings, which were from 91 compa-
nies, generated 5096 applications and the ﬁrms conducted 2361 interviews. Because we did not have
access to re´sume´s for applicants that were not registered with the career services ofﬁce, analyses of
applicants who applied for a position are based on 4126 (81 per cent) applications, and analyses of
applicant pool characteristics of interviewees are based on 2002 (85 per cent) interviews.

To obtain measures of applicant quality (discussed in detail below) we coded the re´sume´s of 435
students who had registered with the career services ofﬁce. Fifty-one per cent of the job seekers were
female. Most job seekers were completing their bachelor degree (99 per cent). Approximately 26 per
cent of the job seekers were marketing majors, 19 per cent were ﬁnance majors, 14 per cent manage-
ment majors, and 40 per cent were non-business majors. The average grade-point average was 3.1.

Applicant pool characteristics

We operationalized the size of ﬁrms’ applicant pools by counting the number of applicants who
attempted to interview with the companies (by submitting their re´sume´ to the ﬁrms). Next, we mea-
sured applicant quality by having a rater code students’ standardized re´sume´s using dimensions and
procedures suggested by previous research (Brown & Campion, 1994; Cable & Gilovich, 1998). The
dimensions of applicant quality included academic performance, work experience, and extracurricular
activities. Academic performance consisted of reported overall grade point average and the number of
foreign languages that the applicant listed on the standardized re´sume´. Work experience was repre-
sented as the number of months of full-time work experience. The total number of extracurricular
activities listed on the re´sume´ was used as the measure of extracurricular activities. The rater also esti-
mated an overall quality rating of each applicant on a seven-point scale (1 low, 4 average, and 7 out-
standing). One research assistant coded all of the 435 re´sume´s. A second research assistant
independently evaluated 100 of the re´sume´s, and we calculated correlations between the two raters
across the 100 re´sume´s to estimate inter-rater reliability. Results indicated acceptable reliability for
all measures of applicant quality, with correlations ranging from 0.88 to 1.0. In the analyses, we used
the ratings from the research assistant who rated all 435 re´sume´s.

Firm reputation

We obtained objective measures of corporate reputation from the following resources: Business Week,
Fortune, Working Mother and The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. More speciﬁcally,
Business Week publishes an annual article of The Best Performers, called the Business Week 50; we
examined the March 30, 1998 and the March 29, 1999 articles. Fortune magazine publishes an annual
list of The 100 Best Companies to Work For; we examined the January 12, 1998 and the January 11,

1999 articles. Working Mother publishes an annual article of the 100 Best Companies for Working
Mothers; we examined the October 1998 and 1999 lists. For each of the periodicals listed above, com-
panies received a score of 1 if they were listed for that speciﬁc year and a 0 if they were not listed.
Similarly, companies received a score of 1 if they were listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to
Work for in America and 0 otherwise (Levering & Moskowitz, 1993). We operationalized company
reputation as the sum of the reputation scores from the various sources. Scores could range from 0
to 7; actual scores ranged from 0 to 4.

Control variables

We categorized ﬁrms into the following seven categories using their global SIC codes: food and con-
sumer products, computers and electronics, transportation, ﬁnancial, entertainment services, consult-
ing services, and retail trade. In the regression analyses we used effect coding, with retail trade as the
omitted group. As described above, we also controlled for number of interview schedules and inter-
view date.

Analyses and Results: Study 1

For each job posting, we counted the number of applicants who applied for the position. To measure
applicant pool characteristics, we calculated the averages of the indicators of applicant pool quality
(e.g., average grade point average of applicants). Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and corre-
lations among the variables. As can be seen from the correlation matrix for applicants (lower diago-
nal), ﬁrm reputation is correlated with the number of applicants, grade point average, extracurricular
activities, and the overall rating. For interviewees (upper diagonal), reputation is correlated with grade
point average, foreign languages, extracurricular activities, and the overall rating. These preliminary
results provide initial support for our hypotheses.

To test the effects of reputation on applicant pool characteristics, we used hierarchical regression
analyses, adding industry, number of interview schedules, and interview date to the model in step 1
and company reputation in step 2. The signiﬁcance of the regression coefﬁcient for reputation provides
a test of whether it inﬂuences the applicant pool characteristic beyond the effects of the other variables
in the equation (i.e., whether the change in R2 is signiﬁcant). We conducted regression analyses sepa-
rately for applicants (Table 2) and for interviewees (Table 3).
Table 2 indicates that company reputation positively inﬂuenced the number of applicants (
 ¼ 0.17,
p 0.05), providing support for Hypothesis 1. Follow-up analyses indicated that ﬁrms with poor repu-
tations (i.e., two standard deviations below the mean) received approximately 22 applications, whereas
ﬁrms with positive reputations (two standard deviations above the mean) received 33 applications, or
50 per cent more applications.

Hypothesis 2, which proposed that reputation would inﬂuence the quality of applicants who applied
for a position, was partially supported. Firms with positive reputations attracted applicants with higher
average grade point averages (
 ¼ 0.17, p 0.05), and also were more likely to attract applicants with
foreign language skills (
 ¼ 0.13, p 0.10), and with a higher overall rating (
 ¼ 0.11, p 0.10).
Company reputation was unrelated to work experience or extracurricular activities.

Hypothesis 3, which proposed that reputation would affect the quality of applicants interviewed by
the ﬁrm, was supported. As shown in Table 3, company reputation was related to applicant pool grade

applicants than ﬁrms with less positive reputations.

Examination of the effects of the control variables also is illuminating. In general, industry had rela-
tively weak effects, although consulting ﬁrms tended to interview higher-quality applicants relative to
the other industries. Results for interview date provided some support for the previously untested belief
that ﬁrms interviewing later in the recruitment season attract lower-quality applicants. Interview date
was negatively related to number of applicants, work experience, extracurricular activities, and the
overall rating of applicants. Furthermore, ﬁrms with later interview dates interviewed individuals with
fewer extracurricular activities who received an overall lower rating. Finally, the number of interview

schedules was related to the number of applicants, but in general was not related to the measures of
applicant quality.

In summary, results from Study 1 suggest that ﬁrm reputation inﬂuences the number of applicants
who apply for positions in the ﬁrm. Furthermore, although ﬁrm reputation was weakly related to the
quality of applicants who applied for positions, reputation was related to the quality of applicants
interviewed by the ﬁrm, perhaps because more reputable ﬁrms could be more selective in whom they
chose to interview since they had more applicants.

Method: Study 2

In order to explore the generalizability of the ﬁndings from Study 1, we conducted a second study with
a new degree type, at a different university, and used complementary but different operationalizations
of company reputation and applicant pool characteristics. For the second study, we collected data from
the MBA career services ofﬁce at a large southeastern university during the 2000–2001 academic year.
The average full-time work experience of the 245 MBAs in our sample was 5 years. Like Study 1, we
gathered data about which companies interviewed at the Business School, and we obtained archival
data about the reputations of those companies. We then gathered information about the number and
quality of students who pursued jobs with each of the recruiting companies (resulting again in a ﬁrm-
level unit of analyses). In terms of measuring MBA’s interest in the ﬁrms, we again followed recom-
mendations to study applicants’ actual job pursuit behaviors (e.g., application behaviors) rather than
measuring their intentions to apply for a job (using a survey designed solely for research purposes)
(Rynes, 1991). As Rynes (1991) and other have noted, indicating one’s intentions to apply for a job
is a ‘costless’ exercise that takes little effort by the respondent, whereas applying for a job takes con-
siderable effort. Thus, in Study 2 we explicitly incorporated the notion of opportunity costs by exam-
ining the information sessions that applicants attended, and the points that applicants ‘bid’ to obtain
interviews with companies (both described in detail below).

Company reputation

Given that our sample of ﬁrms was recruiting at an MBA school, we operationalized ﬁrms’ reputations
using data from Universum, the company that gathers and reports the MBA data for Fortune Maga-
zine’s ‘Best Companies to Work for’ report (Daniels, 2000). Speciﬁcally, in 1999 Universum surveyed
over 2700 MBA students at 32 top business schools, asking them to select the ﬁve companies ‘for
which they ideally would like to work’ (Universum, 2000). Each company then received a score based
on the number of students across all schools that selected the company, with companies that were not
selected by MBAs coded at the lowest Universum reputation score. None of the job seekers investi-
gated in this study were respondents to Universum’s 2000 survey report, which used data gathered
from 1999 MBA graduates.

Information sessions

Most companies recruiting at this school held information sessions, which refer to a sort of ‘open
house’ that companies hold on campus prior to their interviews in order to socialize with students

and offer them information about the company. Attending a company’s information session (where
business attire is expected) is an important signal about students’ interest in an organization due to
their extremely full schedules during the recruiting season and because it serves little function for stu-
dents to attend an information session with a ﬁrm that they are not interested in as a potential employer.
Attendance of MBA students at each company’s information session was gathered from MBA career
services records.

Points bid

In this MBA Career Ofﬁce, job seekers are given 500 non-replenishable ‘bid points’ at the beginning of
the semester, which are used to obtain interviews with companies. Speciﬁcally, MBA students who
want to interview with a certain company must ‘outbid’ other students for an interview slot. The bid-
ding process is conﬁdential, although students do have access to the average number of points bid the
previous year for each recruiting company. Failure to outbid other job seekers for a given organization
excludes that company as a possibility (unless an applicant is invited for an interview by the company
independently). Because points are non-replaceable, each bidding decision represents an opportunity
cost as it forfeits job opportunities with omitted companies. For the present study, points bid by stu-
dents for each company were obtained from the career ofﬁce’s archival records.

Applicant quality

We operationalized applicant quality with applicants’ GMAT score, which is a standardized index of
an applicant’s general mental ability. GMAT data were gathered from the MBA ofﬁce’s archival
records.

Control variables

As with Study 1, we used effect coding (with retail trade as the omitted group) and categorized ﬁrms
into seven categories using their global SIC codes: food and consumer products, computers and elec-
tronics, transportation, ﬁnancial, entertainment services, consulting services, and retail trade. Again,
we controlled for number of interview schedules and interview date.

Analyses and Results: Study 2

For each company, we measured the number of applicants attending the information session, and we
calculated the average of the number of applicants who bid on the company, the number of points bid
on the company by students, and the GMAT scores of all the applicants who attended the company’s
information session. As in Study 1, we examined the relationships between company reputation and
these applicant pool characteristics after controlling for industry, number of jobs available, and recruit-
ing date.

Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations among the variables for the second
study. Firm reputation is correlated with the number of applicants attending information sessions,
the number of applicants bidding points, and the total number of points bid, providing initial support

Note: Values in table are standardized regression coefﬁcients. 245 people were seeking jobs, although the unit of analysis (n) is
the ﬁrm. Signiﬁcance tests for reputation are one-tailed.
*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.

for Hypothesis 1. To provide a more comprehensive test of the effects of reputation on applicant pool
characteristics, we again used hierarchical regression analyses, adding the control variables in step 1
and company reputation in step 2.
As shown in Table 5, results indicated that companies with better reputations attracted more appli-
cants, as evidenced by the number of applicants who attended their information session (
 ¼ 0.29,
p 0.01) and the total number of applicants who bid points on the company (
 ¼ 0.25, p 0.05).
The practical effects of these relationships are substantial: ﬁrms with more positive reputations (i.e.,
two standard deviations above the mean) attracted 16 more applicants to their information sessions and
about 13 more applicants bid points on them than ﬁrms with less positive reputations (i.e., two standard
deviations below the mean). Table 5 also shows that applicants bid more of their valuable points on
ﬁrms with more positive reputations (
 ¼ 0.47, p 0.01). Speciﬁcally, the average applicant bid 132
more points on ﬁrms with positive versus less positive reputations (i.e., two standard deviations above
and below the mean, respectively). This is a large effect since 132 points represents over 26 per cent of
a given applicant’s total allocated points for the entire recruiting season. The results in Table 5 reveal
that companies with better reputations did not attract applicants with higher GMAT scores. However,
the GMAT scores were quite high (M¼ 636) with limited variability (SD¼ 24), and this restriction of
range may have obscured the relationship between reputation and GMAT scores.

Discussion

We extended the literature by conducting two studies to answer an important yet previously unan-
swered question: Does ﬁrm reputation inﬂuence the size and quality of the ﬁrm’s applicant pool?
Results from both studies, using different samples and operationalizations of both key constructs (cor-
porate reputation and applicant pool characteristics), indicate that the answer is yes. First, ﬁrms with
more positive reputations attracted larger applicant pools. For example, in Study 1 ﬁrms with more

positive reputations generated 33 applications compared to only 22 applications for ﬁrms with less
positive reputations (i.e., 50 per cent more applicants). Similarly, in Study 2, reputation was positively
related to the number of applicants attending an information session, the number of applicants bidding
for an interview with the ﬁrm, and the average points bid for the company. Perhaps more important
than statistical signiﬁcance, the results were also important practically. Firms with positive reputations
(i.e., two standard deviations above the mean) attracted 25 applicants to information sessions, com-
pared to only nine applicants attracted by ﬁrms with poorer reputations (two standard deviations below
the mean). Similarly, results indicate that an average of 16 applicants bid points on ﬁrms with positive
reputations, while approximately three applicants bid points on ﬁrms with poor reputations (two stan-
dard deviations above and below the mean, respectively). Moreover, applicants used over ﬁve times
more of their valuable ‘bid’ points pursuing interviews with reputable ﬁrms: an average of 167 points
for ﬁrms two standard deviations above the mean compared to only 35 points for ﬁrms two standard
deviations below the mean. Thus, results across both studies indicate that ﬁrm reputation is positively
related to the number of applicants and to applicants’ actual job pursuit behaviors.

We hypothesized that ﬁrms with more positive reputations would attract higher-quality applicants;
results offered limited support for this hypothesis. In Study 1, ﬁrm reputation was related to grade point
average for both applicants and interviewees. Given meta-analysis evidence that grade point average is
related to job performance, with corrected correlations in the 0.30s (Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &
Schippmann, 1996), it seems likely that ﬁrms with positive reputations were able to select better per-
formers. However, reputation had a stronger effect on applicant pool quality indicators for interviewees
than for applicants. More speciﬁcally, for interviewees, ﬁrm reputation was related positively to the
applicant pool characteristics of grade point average, foreign languages, extracurricular activities, and
the overall rating. Thus, our results from Study 1 indicate that ﬁrms with more positive reputations
were able to interview, and presumably select, higher-quality applicants than ﬁrms with less positive
reputations. We theorized that reputable ﬁrms would have higher-quality interviewees because they
would receive more applicants and/or higher-quality applicants; either or both of these effects could
lead to higher-quality interviewees. Our results provided only limited support for the hypothesis that
lower-quality applicants are less likely to apply to ﬁrms with positive reputations, perhaps because
such applicants have a low expectancy of receiving a job offer. Interestingly, however, our results pro-
vide strong evidence that employers with positive reputations attract more applicants and thus can be
more selective in choosing higher-quality applicants to interview. More broadly, our results provide
stronger support for signaling theory and social identity theory, which led to the prediction that ﬁrm
reputation would result in more positive perceptions of the ﬁrm as an employer and therefore lead to
more applicants. Nonetheless, future research is needed to test the speciﬁc mechanism through which
reputation inﬂuences application decisions.

We extended the literature by providing evidence that published measures of ﬁrm reputation inﬂu-
ence the size and quality of the ﬁrm’s applicant pool, not just potential applicants’ intentions to apply
for a job. Such results are important because attracting quality applicants is the ﬁrst, and perhaps most
important, human resource management practice since the effects of subsequent human resource prac-
tices depend upon the quality of job applicants (Rynes & Cable, 2003; Taylor & Collins, 2000). Thus,
the present study provides empirical support for previously untested propositions that reputation can
provide ﬁrms a competitive advantage by attracting more and higher-quality applicants (Fombrun,
1996; Sobol, Farrelly, & Taper, 1992). If ﬁrms have valid selection techniques, then ﬁrms with positive
reputations may hire better employees than ﬁrms with less positive reputations, assuming the ﬁrm can
convert applicants into employees, which is another area in which research is needed (Barber, 1998).
In any case, since a positive reputation is a rare, valuable, inimitable, and non-substitutable resource
(Barney, 1991) that provides a competitive advantage in terms of attracting applicants, research is now
needed to better understand how reputation inﬂuences application decisions. For example, future

research might examine whether organizations with positive reputations are more attractive to appli-
cants because such organizations reﬂect social status on organizational afﬁliates, as suggested by
social identity theory. Similarly, adopting a signaling theory perspective, future research might inves-
tigate which particular organizational and job attributes are signaled by reputation.

In addition, research is needed to investigate attributes of a ﬁrm’s reputation as well as how appli-
cants form perceptions of a ﬁrm. Recent reviews of the recruitment literature noted that we know little
about how individuals develop beliefs about potential employers (Cable & Turban, 2001; Highhouse &
Hoffman, 2001). Understanding how job seekers form initial perceptions of ﬁrms is particularly
important, however, because evidence suggests that the recruitment process does little to change appli-
cants’ perceptions (Lawler et al., 1975; Powell & Goulet, 1996; Turban, 2001). For example, Lawler
et al. (1975) found that 80 per cent of the students accepted a job offer from the ﬁrm that had the high-
est attractiveness ratings before the interview process. Similarly, other studies have found that the
strongest predictor of post-interview attraction is pre-interview attraction (Powell, 1991; Turban,
Forret, & Hendrickson, 1998). In addition, evidence indicates that applicants’ pre-interview percep-
tions of the ﬁrm inﬂuence how they interpret behaviors occurring during the interview (Powell &
Goulet, 1996; Stevens, 1997). More broadly, Cable and Turban (2001) theorized that job seekers’
employer knowledge, such as reputation perceptions, inﬂuences how they respond to a ﬁrm’s recruit-
ment practices, suggesting the importance of understanding how reputation perceptions are formed.
Several recent studies have begun to provide some insight into factors that inﬂuence applicants’ per-
ceptions of ﬁrms’ reputations. For example, Highhouse et al. (1999) found that fast food ﬁrms were
perceived as more attractive employers when they were perceived as having greater respectability, pro-
duct image, hearsay, and atmosphere. Cable and Graham (2000) found that job seekers’ reputation per-
ceptions were related to the ﬁrm’s industry, proﬁtability, and familiarity with the ﬁrm. Finally, Cable
et al. (2000) found that applicants’ perceptions of ﬁrms were inﬂuenced by product advertisements and
marketing as well as company information such as recruitment brochures. Although it seems likely that
such information sources probably inﬂuence applicants’ perceptions of the ﬁrm’s reputation, further
research is needed to investigate both the content of job seekers’ beliefs about a ﬁrm as well as factors
that inﬂuence such beliefs (Cable & Turban, 2001; Highhouse & Hoffman, 2001). On a more practical
level, given the relationship between reputation and application decisions, ﬁrms interested in attracting
quality applicants should benchmark their reputation among potential applicants relative to competitors
and if needed take steps to improve their reputation among job seekers.

A noteworthy contribution of our study is our examination of the relationship between recruitment
timing and applicant pool characteristics. Although scholars have theorized that recruitment timing
inﬂuences applicant pool characteristics, no research has investigated this relationship (Rynes,
1991). Results from Study 1 indicated that ﬁrms interviewing later received signiﬁcantly fewer appli-
cants (
 ¼   0.14, p 0.05) with less work experience (
 ¼   0.31, p 0.01), fewer extracurricular
activities (
 ¼   0.16, p 0.05), and a lower overall rating (
 ¼   0.39, p 0.01), although there
were no effects of recruitment date in Study 2. Nonetheless, such results may have practical implica-
tions for when ﬁrms recruit on campus, and we urge researchers to replicate this ﬁnding and to also
investigate mechanisms leading to this result. For example, do higher-quality applicants receive and
accept job offers early in the season and thus stop seeking positions? Or, as theorized by Soelberg
(1967), perhaps ﬁrms recruiting early in the year become the implicit ﬁrst choice of applicants, such
that they become the comparison for other ﬁrms.

One strength of our studies is that we operationalized ﬁrm reputation using different measures of a
ﬁrm’s overall reputation, which extends the generalizability of our results because we know our results
are not speciﬁc to only one operationalization of the construct. Furthermore, using different but
comparable operationalizations of reputation is important because some scholars have suggested that
ﬁrms may not have a single reputation across various constituents, and that a ﬁrm’s overall corporate

reputation may not be identical to its recruitment reputation (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Gatewood et
al., 1993). Gatewood et al. (1993) did not ﬁnd a relationship between ﬁrms overall corporate reputation
ratings (from Fortune magazine) and potential applicants’ ratings of ﬁrm reputation, although their sam-
ple size was only 26 ﬁrms. More recent evidence, however, suggests that ﬁrms’ overall corporate repu-
tation is related to its recruitment reputation (Cable & Turban, in press). Thus, research is needed to
determine whether ﬁrms have multiple reputations across various constituents and, if so, what factors
inﬂuence these reputations. Also, it is possible that the effects of reputation may be less strong for indi-
viduals with more work experience, and we therefore encourage researchers to extend our studies using
different samples. For example, although our MBA sample possessed an average of 5 years of full-time
work experience, it would be interesting to examine the effect of reputation on mid-career employees,
or employed individuals who are not searching for a job through a business career services ofﬁce.

In conclusion, the primary objectives of recruitment are the number and quality of applicants
attracted by the organization. However, surprisingly little research has investigated these outcomes
because most recruitment studies are conducted at the individual level of analysis and measure inten-
tions to apply, not actual application decisions (Breaugh & Starke, 2000). In the present study, we
heeded calls in the literature and conducted two separate studies at the organizational level to inves-
tigate whether ﬁrm reputation inﬂuences the number and quality of applicants. Because we collected
objective and veriﬁable measures of applicant quality and quantity, as well as archival measures of
reputation, method variance issues are not a concern with this study. Nonetheless, the study does have
limitations. First, we collected data from business school career services ofﬁces in university settings.
Although college recruiting is an important source of applicants for many ﬁrms, evidence also is
needed in different settings, and thus we encourage future researchers to study employed workers
to determine the generalizability of our results. Second, reputation is an overall perceptual representa-
tion of a ﬁrm’s relative status that is inﬂuenced by various factors. In the present studies, we controlled
for industry because we expected it might be related to both reputation and employer attractiveness.
Clearly, however, other organizational-level variables may impact reputation and ﬁrm attractiveness.
We suspect, however, that many of these organizational variables may impact organizational attrac-
tiveness through inﬂuencing reputation, which is an overall evaluative perception of a ﬁrm. We con-
ducted Study 2 at one of the top business schools in the country and thus the GMAT scores of
applicants were relatively high with low variance. Because this restriction of range may have limited
our ability to detect a relationship of ﬁrm reputation with GMAT scores, we encourage research in
other settings to further investigate the relationship between reputation and applicant quality. Finally,
although obtaining the data for our study involved methodological challenges, our research design and
analyses were relatively simple. Nonetheless, we were able to provide solid evidence indicating the
relevance of published measures of ﬁrm reputation for attracting quality applicants—evidence that,
we hope, will lead to further research investigating factors inﬂuencing ﬁrm reputation and how job
seekers form perceptions of ﬁrms.
