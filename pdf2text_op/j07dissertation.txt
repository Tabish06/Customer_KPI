CHAPTER I 

 

DISSERTATION OVERVIEW 

 

 

The development of new products is critical to the business performance of a 

firm.  Unfortunately, new product development is an uncertain process applied to an 

uncertain environment.  From generating ideas to the actual development of a product 

and finally launching the product to the market, questions about the process for 

incremental innovations abound.  The development of radical innovations, which may be 

new technologies as well as new markets, generates even more questions.  One particular 

factor in the development of radical new products relates to the role of the customer.  

How should customers be used in the new product development of radical innovations?  

Should they be involved at all, and if so, what effect might they have on the business 

performance of radical innovations?   

 

Beyond the question of customer involvement, a significant issue arises with 

regard to the firm itself.  If the firm obtains information from the customer, are they able 

to do anything with it?  Organizational learning is defined as the processes related to 

acquiring, disseminating, utilizing, and remembering information (Huber 1991).  Do 

these four characteristics of a learning organization have an effect on the business 

performance of a radical innovation? 

 

My dissertation attempts to answer these theoretically and practically relevant 

questions.  The dissertation comprises three essays organized as follows: 

 

1


 

In Essay 1 (Chapter II) the role of the customer in the new product development 

of radical innovations is studied via a survey approach.  A significant theoretical and 

practical motivation for this research stream is the uncertainty regarding the role of the 

customer in the development of radical innovations.  Consequently, the literature related 

to the customer as viewed from the perspectives of the firm, lead user methodology (von 

Hippel 2006), disruptive innovation model (Christensen and Bower 1996), and 

incremental innovations is reviewed.  In addition, the stages of the new product 

development process and the opportunities for customer input are considered.  From a 

firm level perspective, the components of organizational learning (Huber 1991) and their 

relation to the development of radical innovations are reviewed.  From these theoretical 

perspectives a conceptual framework is developed.  This framework is estimated the 

model with survey data from managers responsible for product development in the 

medical device market (N=152).   

The findings from this chapter suggest there are multiple factors that affect the 

business performance of a radical new product.  First, at the project level, the results 

show that the type of information obtained from the customer and when it is obtained 

significantly affect the product’s business performance.  Secondly, the firm’s 

organizational learning capabilities are part of a complex relationship which lead to the 

success of a new product.  Finally, the post-hoc analysis of the interactions of 

organizational learning with the customer information and product business performance 

suggests that different strategies are appropriate depending upon the state of a firm’s 

organizational learning capabilities.   

 

2


 

In Essay II (Chapter III), two of the components of organizational learning, 

information acquisition and organizational memory, are considered with respect to the 

development of radical innovations.  This essay shows that the process of new product 

development of radical innovations creates a tension within the dimensions of firm’s 

organizational learning.  Utilizing a case study methodology with four cases, the conflict 

between the acquisition of novel information and the organizational memory of the firm 

is studied.  This tension may arise as a result of the uncertainty in the environment, the 

difficulty of obtaining appropriate customer input, or the aging of information within the 

firm. 

In the case of radical innovations and the uncertainty associated with them, 

information acquisition levels are high, while longer terms of organizational memory 

hinder the development of radical innovations.  For high levels of uncertainty in the 

environment, firms attempt to relieve their uncertainty by acquiring information in 

proportion to the uncertainty (Souder and Moenaert 1992).  A conflict arises in the 

organizational memory of the firm.  At a time when the firm is driven to obtain more 

information, logic dictates that remembering old information as well as that which is 

newly acquired would be important.  For the turbulent and uncertain environments in 

which radical innovations are formed, however, this behavior is counterproductive.  This 

tension between information acquisition and organizational memory may arise as a result 

of the uncertainty in the environment, the difficulty of obtaining appropriate customer 

input, and the aging of information within the firm. 

 

In Essay III (Chapter IV), the characteristics of the customers utilized by firms 

developing radical new medical devices is studied.  Conventional wisdom suggests that 

 

3


the best new product development strategy is to be “close to the customer,” while other 

research suggests that customers hinder the development of radical new products.  This 

paper address three questions: 1) Who do firms contact in the development of radical 

innovations? 2) What information is provided by the customer? 3) When during the 

process does the firm obtain technology and market information from the customer?  

Results from the medical device market (N=152) show specific characteristics of the 

customer, that they provide both technology and market information, and that the 

information varies during the development process. 

 

Chapters II, III, and IV are organized with an abstract and chapter content 

followed by tables, figures, and references for each chapter.  Thus each chapter is self-

contained. 

 

Chapter V provides a summary of the results of the three essays. These include 

who firms obtain information from, what information they obtain, when they obtain it, 

and how the firm’s organizational learning affects how the information is implemented.  

From a broad perspective these results illuminate involvement of the customer in the 

development radical innovations.  The results suggest that customers can have a positive 

impact on a products performance when involved in the development of radical 

innovations.  The inclusion of the customers input is not automatic.  The decision to 

include customer information in the new product development process should be made 

with regard to the firm’s organizational learning as well as the characteristics of the 

customer they utilize in the NPD process.  These findings provide a first step in 

illuminating the complex issue of the new product development of radical innovations.

CHAPTER II 

 

 

THE ROLE OF THE CUSTOMER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADICAL 

INNOVATIONS 

Abstract 

Conventional wisdom suggests that the best new product development strategy is 

to be “close to the customer.”  However, other research suggests that current customers 

may hinder the development of radical new products.  This paper investigates the 

conditions under which customer information provided during the new product 

development (NPD) process improves business performance for radical innovations.  We 

develop a model of the relation between customer inputs and business performance of the 

radical innovation.  The model includes: 1) the technology and market information 

obtained from the customer, 2) the phase of the NPD process in which the information is 

obtained, and 3) the firm’s organizational learning (i.e., information acquisition, 

information utilization, information dissemination, and organizational memory of the 

firm).  We estimated the model with survey data from managers responsible for product 

development in the medical device market (N=152).  The findings suggest there are 

multiple factors that affect the business performance of a radical new product.  First, at 

the project level, the results show that the type of information obtained from the customer 

and when it is obtained significantly affect the product’s business performance.  

Secondly, the firm’s organizational learning capabilities are part of a complex 

relationship which lead to the success of a new product.  Finally, the post-hoc analysis of 

the interactions of organizational learning with the customer information and product 

 

6


business performance suggests different strategies are appropriate depending upon the 

state of a firm’s organizational learning capabilities.   

 

2.1 

Introduction 

 

Can customers provide useful information in the new product development (NPD) 

process of radical innovations; or, is the usefulness of customer information limited 

because the innovations are by definition “radically” different from that which customers 

are accustomed?  A radical innovation is the type of innovation that challenges the 

preexisting paradigms and concepts of the market (Garcia and Calantone 2002; 

Henderson and Clark 1990).  Radical innovations provide a chance for a firm to open up 

a completely new market (Anderson and Tushman 1990; Utterback and Abernathy 1975), 

or to develop a new dominant design in an existing market (Srinivasan et al. 2006).  

Either of these can bring significant opportunities for success to a firm (Anderson and 

Tushman 1990; Christensen et al. 1998; Srinivasan et al. 2006). 

There is, of course, a caveat: radical innovations can be the most difficult 

products to develop (Chandy and Tellis 2000).  Because of these difficulties, firms desire 

as much information as possible to reduce their uncertainties (Souder et al. 1998).  Within 

the product development literature there are two views regarding the involvement of the 

customer in the development of radical innovations.  Conventional wisdom and practices 

suggest that the best product development strategy results from being “close to the 

customer” (Krishnan and Ulrich 2001; Lilien et al. 2002; Urban and Hauser 1993; Urban 

and von Hippel 1988).  However, other research suggests that, for radical innovations, 

 

7


current customers may hinder the successful development of new products (Christensen 

1992a; Christensen 1992b; Datar et al. 1996). 

From the pro-customer involvement perspective, Von Hippel’s lead user approach 

is the most prominent (Urban and von Hippel 1988; von Hippel 1976; von Hippel 1998; 

von Hippel 1986; von Hippel 2001; von Hippel and Katz 2002).  According to von 

Hippel, the “right” users may provide ideas to a firm which result in novel products. 

In contrast, from the anti-customer involvement perspective, current customers 

may mislead firms when developing new innovations (Christensen and Bower 1996).  

Based on data from the disk drive industry, Christensen examined the success of new 

entrants to the market and the failure of established firms in that market.  He proposed 

that new entrants, rather than established firms, introduced “disruptive innovations,” 

which redefine the performance trajectory for products in a given industry (Christensen 

and Bower 1996).  The unstated assumption is that current customers should have only a 

limited role in providing information, if at all, in radical innovations. 

To illuminate this problem, the contradictory views of the role of the customer in 

the development of radical innovations must be addressed.  Currently, there is no existing 

conceptual framework to resolve this question. 

The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate how customer input in the 

development of radical innovations affects the product’s eventual business performance.  

For the purposes of this research, the “customer” is defined as a current or potential client 

of the firm for the radical innovation (Nambisan 2002).  Information from these 

customers is not uni-dimensional; rather, such a customer can provide information with a 

richness (Daft and Lengel 1986) and depth resulting from their experience and 

 

8


perspectives (Zahay et al. 2004).  The nature of the information or input supplied by 

customers is refined in the following way.  First, a product can be considered radical for 

two reasons (Garcia and Calantone 2002; Henderson and Clark 1990). First, it may use a 

radical technology to satisfy a current market need, for example, when iPod music 

players began replacing music CDs.  Second, there may be an entirely new market 

opened by the innovation, such as when Apple introduced the ability of the iPod to 

download TV and videos. Thus, these two dimensions distinguish radical innovations, 

and consequently distinguish two different types of information that can be supplied by 

customers:  technology and marketing information (Table 2-1).  Technology (also 

referred to as technical) information relates to the technical aspects of content, needs, 

uniqueness, and trends of the product.  Market information includes information related 

to the existence of a market, market size, market growth, competitor information, and 

environment for the product.  The combination of technology and market information 

dimensions of information inform the design of the product.   

Second, the information is characterized by the stage of the NPD process in which 

it is elicited from customers.  Because, the new product development process occurs over 

time with multiple stages in the process, the timing of the information exchange between 

the customer and the firm may influence the mix of information (Zahay et al. 2004) 

needed by the firm and provided by the customer.  While there are a host of different 

models of the NPD process (Booz 1982; Song and Montoya-Weiss 1998), Crawford and 

Di Benedetto’s (2000) model that considers three core stages: idea generation, 

development, and product launch was followed.  Lead user research has only studied the 

impact of such users in the first stage of NPD (von Hippel 2006). Thus, this research will

extend von Hippel’s work to investigate when customers should be involved in NPD. 

Third, the ability of a firm to acquire, distribute, interpret, and retain customer 

information, commonly referred to as organizational learning, has been shown to affect 

the success of the product (Adams et al. 1998; Huber 1991; Hurley and Hult 1998).  In a 

review of the literature, Hart et al. (1999) found that “market information processing is a 

function of what the organization has learned previously, in terms of both facts about its 

relevant markets and its particular way of acquiring, distributing, interpreting, and storing 

information, whether that be formal or informal.”  For this reason, how information is 

utilized, as well as its nature and when it is collected may affect the radical innovation.. 

In summary, this research addresses the following research questions: 

1.  When during the NPD process does the firm obtain technology and market 

information from the customer? 

2.  How does that technology and market information influence the business 

performance of the radical innovation? 

3.  How does the organizational learning of the firm influence the business performance 

of the radical innovation developed with information from the customer? 

These questions concern a mix of product level (customer information type and stage) 

 

and firm level (organizational learning) variables.  Hence, the unit of analysis is the 

product developed by the firm and the product’s performance.  This performance may be 

affected by the organizational learning of the firm.  These research questions are 

addressed by developing a model of the antecedents of business performance for radical 

innovations.  The model includes the technology information and market information 

obtained from the customer, when in the NPD process the information is obtained, and 

the organizational learning of the firm. 

 

Survey data obtained from key informants in 152 medical device firms is used to 

test the model.  The medical device market was selected because of the large number of 

 

10


radical innovations developed within the market.  This study is not intended to detail the 

medical device market, but to test the model and the role of the customers in a dynamic 

market.  While this is a large market, certain market factors such as the FDA regulation 

may limit the generalizability of the results to other markets. For example, the FDA 

requires approval regarding the product’s capabilities and claims made by the developing 

firm before the product may be marketed to the industry. 

Compared with prior research, this study has three unique features.   First, it 

integrates the resource-based, information processing and knowledge-based views of the 

firm by considering the type of customer information (market/technological) and its 

timing (stage of NPD process) as antecedents of business performance. Second, it 

recognizes that the effect of market and technological information on business 

performance can be increasing (linear), decreasing (linear), or can exhibit a curvilinear 

relation across the stages of the NPD process.  Third, it considers the effect of 

organizational learning on the business performance of radical innovations as both a main 

effect and a moderator variable. 

With these three features of the study, this research contributes to the theoretical 

understanding of utilizing customer information during NPD.  By addressing the source 

of information, the type of information, and when that information is obtained a 

significant component of obtaining information during NPD is illuminated.  Additionally, 

the significance of the organizational learning components and their impact on the 

product’s business performance are expanded.

2.2 

Conceptual Framework 

The new product development process of radical innovations is an inherently 

risky problem for most firms.  To address this problem, the role of the customer, the 

business performance of the product, the radical innovation, the firm’s state of 

organizational learning, and the stages of new product development will be addressed in 

the conceptual framework.  In this section, prior research is synthesized into a conceptual 

framework of how customer information influences business performance for a radical 

innovation and how the firm manages that information.  (SeeFigure 2-1.)  This model 

distinguishes between two types of information concerning radical new products: 

technological and market information.  The framework will conclude with a precise 

definition of “customer” that is relevant for radical innovations

2.2.1 

The Role of the Customer 

 

The role of the customer in the development of radical innovations is uncertain.  In 

radical innovations, the positive role of the customer in NPD is suggested by three 

separate sources of research, while research on disruptive innovations suggests a negative 

role of the customer.  The positive support for the role of the customer is found in 1) 

theories of the firm, 2) the role of the customer in incremental innovations, and 3) lead 

user research.  Theories of the firm provide an underlying framework suggestive of the 

value of the customer and the information obtained from the customer.  The existing 

literature associated with the role of the customer in incremental innovations has clearly 

demonstrated the importance of the customer in the NPD process (Balachandra and Friar 

1997; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1994; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1986; Cooper and 

Kleinschmidt 1987; Johne and Storey 1998; Karkkainen and Elfvengren 2002; Song and 

Montoya-Weiss 1998).  The work of von Hippel (1998; 1986) provides preliminary 

support for the positive role of a select type of customer in the success of radical 

innovations.  In contrast, Christensen’s research in disruptive innovations suggests that 

the customer can be a source of misleading information and may sidetrack the NPD 

process.  Each of these sources for the role of the customer will be evaluated in their 

application to radical innovations. 

 

2.2.1.1  Theories of the Firm 

 

For the relationship between the firm and the customer to develop beyond a purely 

economic relationship of buyer and seller, the firm must recognize and assign value 

(whether consciously or subconsciously) to the customer and the information obtained 

 

13


from the customer.  A review of the literature has identified three theoretical perspectives 

of the firm with significant potential to explain the role of the customer in NPD.  The 

resource based view of the firm provides a possible explanation of the intangible value of 

the customer as a firm resource (Barney 1991), while the information processing view of 

the firm (Tatikonda and Rosenthal 2000) and the knowledge based view of the firm 

(Grant 1996) attempt to describe the firm by its uncertainty, knowledge, and activities 

related to treating its uncertainty and knowledge.  Aspects of these three views of the firm 

support a positive role for the customer in the development of radical innovations. 

 

2.2.1.1.1  Resource Based View of the Firm (RBV). 

 

The resource based view of the firm tells us that firms succeed because of their 

resources, and there are different dimensions used to assess the uniqueness of those 

factors for the firm (Barney 1991).  The RBV is concerned with why some firms are able 

to establish positions of sustainable competitive advantage and earn superior returns 

(Grant 1996).  To meet the definitions of the resource view of the firm, an asset must be 

valuable, rare, un-imitable, and un-substitutable (Barney 1991; Lengnick-Hall 1996).  

With respect to a firm, the customer may be valuable, difficult to obtain (rare), difficult 

for a competitor to imitate (unimatable), and difficult to substitute (un-substitutable).  

Consequently, the customer and the information they supply may be considered an asset 

or resource of the firm. 

 

 

 

 

14


2.2.1.1.2  Information Processing View of the Firm (IPV). 

 

The information processing view of the firm identifies those activities which 

reduce uncertainty for the firm (Souder and Moenaert 1992).  Uncertainty results from a 

difference in the information a firm currently possesses and the information required to 

perform some task(Galbraith 1973).  Such activities have been associated with the 

processes of technological innovation (Souder and Moenaert 1992) and new product 

development (Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 2001).  Souder and Moenaret (1992) 

suggest that consumer, technological, and competitive uncertainty must be reduced as a 

prerequisite for successful innovations.  Consumer uncertainty is defined as the 

uncertainty of the user needs, technological uncertainty is the uncertainty related to the 

best technology to utilize, and competitive uncertainty is the uncertainty about 

competitors.  Souder and Moenaret (1992) also indicate that these uncertainties may be, 

but need not be, interrelated.  It is the information processing view of the firm that 

suggests that the customer may reduce multiple uncertainties, either consumer, 

technological, or competitive. 

 

2.2.1.1.3  Knowledge Based View of the Firm (KBV). 

 

The knowledge-based view of the firm regards knowledge as the most strategically 

significant of the firm’s resources (Grant 1996).  The focus upon knowledge as a resource 

is an extension of the resource based view of the firm.  Additionally, the knowledge-

based view of the firm places a premium on the conversion of customer obtained 

information into actionable knowledge (Grant 1996; Kessler and Chakrabarti 1996) 

 

15


 

Specific roles of the customer within the knowledge based view of the firm were 

proposed by Gersuny and Rosengren (1973) and incorporated by Lengnick-Hall (1996) 

and Nambisan (2002).  These roles of the customer incorporate the potential roles of the 

customer for the entire duration of the new product development cycle and include the 

customer as a resource, cocreator, buyer, and user.  Each is considered in turn, as well as 

how the customer impacts the NPD process.  As a resource, the customer provides a 

direct transfer of information to the firm in the idea generation stage of NPD.  As 

cocreator, the customer plays a more direct role in the design activities of the new 

product.  These activities may range from product design activities to product 

development activities (Nambisan 2002).  Nambisan (2002) suggests that the customer as 

cocreator may contribute to the validation of product architectural choices, the design and 

prioritization of product features, the specification of product interface requirements, and 

the establishment of development process priorities.  The detail and depth of these 

activities require significant levels of information exchange between the customer and the 

innovating firm.  As a buyer, the customer provides information to the firm that the 

product functionality and pricing are acceptable.  As a user, prior to a widespread release, 

certain customers use a product to identify actual and potential problem areas associated 

with the product, and then communicate those issues to the developing firm (Dolan and 

Matthews 1993). 

 

2.2.1.1.4  Synthesis 

 

All three views of the firm support a positive (favorable) role for the customer in 

the development of innovations: as a critical resource (Barney 1991; Wernerfelt 1984), as 

 

16


a supplier of information (Souder and Moenaert 1992; Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 

2001), and as a source of market knowledge (Grant 1996).  Three critical implications for 

the roles of the customer emerge from these views of the firm.  The first is that the 

primary function of the customer is as an information provider.  Second, the customer 

and information supplied by the customer are viewed as positive for the new product 

development process.  Third, the customer may provide different information at different 

stages of the NPD process.  An argument can be made, however, that existing customers 

are valuable, informed resources required for the existing marketplace but that they may 

be unreliable informants for new markets.  Hence, there remains a question with regard to 

the appropriate role for customers in the NPD for radical innovations. 

 

2.2.1.2  Role of the Customer in Incremental Innovations 

 

Before turning to radical innovations, the relation between the customer and the 

firm in the development of incremental innovations must be reviewed.  Numerous studies 

of the key factors in the new product development process identify the customer as a 

determinant of commercial success in incremental new products1.  These studies have 

shown that early and frequent contact with the customer leads to an exchange of the 

customer’s needs with the firm.  Firms able to develop a product meeting those needs 

have typically met with commercial success. 

 

The beneficial role of the customer in incremental innovations is well documented 

(Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1986; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1990).  However, there are 

two significant differences between incremental and radical innovations.  First, in 
                                                 
1 See for example:  (Balachandra and Friar 1997; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1994; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 
1986; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1987; Johne and Storey 1998; Karkkainen and Elfvengren 2002; Song and 
Montoya-Weiss 1998)  

 

17


incremental improvements or innovations of a product, the customer typically has either 

direct experience with or knowledge of the product to be improved (Abernathy and 

Utterback 1978), whereas customers may not be able to recognize their need for a radical 

innovation.  For example, if one asked a customer in a television store in the late 1990’s 

what they desired from a TV set, the answer might be higher clarity, better brightness, or 

a larger screen, however, we would never expect the answer to be “Give me a smaller 

screen with lower resolution but make it portable so I can watch it while on the subway.” 

Yet, that is exactly the radical innovation that has made the video iPod a success. 

 

Secondly, for an incremental innovation, there is a market with well-defined 

boundaries from which to solicit customers.  In contrast, a market may not exist during 

the development of a radical innovation (Christensen and Bower 1996), thereby 

increasing the difficulty of obtaining both potential customers and relevant customer 

information.  The telephone and the Internet are examples of radical innovations 

developed without an existing market from which to draw customer input.  While the 

body of evidence supporting the role of the customer in the development of incremental 

innovations implies some benefit for including customers in the development of radical 

innovations (de Brentani 2001), this inclusion is far from agreed upon. Again, referring to 

Christensen’s work, a firm may become too close to its current customer base and miss 

an upcoming disruptive, radical innovation.2 

2 Unsuccessful radical innovations can also highlight problems due to a lack of a 

                                                 
 
well-defined market from which to solicit customers.  For example, digital cameras have 
been around for decades but, until recently, they were curiosities rather than main stream 
products.  Other radical innovations which have not found markets include the Segway 
scooter, electric passenger cars, and supersonic passenger aircraft (the Concord).  Each of 
these was clearly radical in their technology and had ready potential markets but, due to a 
variety of considerations, was unsuccessful. If current customers were consulted during 

 

18


2.2.1.2.1  Lead User Research 

One heavily studied technique for obtaining customer input in NPD is lead user 

research (von Hippel 1986).  There are three potential types of lead users: 1) those from 

the target industry, 2) those from an analogous market who can transfer technical 

information from their market into the new market, and 3) those familiar with attributes 

similar to those in the target industry (Thomke and Nimgade 1998).  For example, in the 

development of a product for 3M, lead users consisted of health care professionals, 

makeup artists, and other non-healthcare personnel.  The lead user method has resulted in 

novel product specifications in a number of areas including: computer aided design 

system (Urban and von Hippel 1988), pipe hangers in a “low tech” industry (Herstatt and 

von Hippel 1992), computer hardware and networking projects (Olson and Bakke 2001), 

and several projects at 3M (Lilien et al. 2002).  Lead users experience their needs before 

the majority of the market, so they have not only identified what they want a product to 

do (product need) -- but they may have created a solution to fill this need (product idea).  

In contrast to traditional marketing techniques, the lead user method may elicit customer 

needs and product ideas (Lilien et al. 2002). 

 

Despite its benefits, there are two limitations to the lead user method.  First, lead 

users are typically only involved at the initial new idea stage of NPD (von Hippel 2006; 

von Hippel 1986). While this is an excellent place to begin, it does not allow for the 

additional technical and market input that customers may be able to provide further 

downstream in the NPD process.  A second limitation to the lead user method is the 

difficulty in the selection of lead users.  While lead users experience needs before the 

                                                                                                                                                 
the NPD process, would the results have been different? 
 

 

19


general market, what user would have ever expressed the need for a web browser before 

the advent of the Internet?  How would a firm select a lead user who would understand 

the need for a personal computer in the 1970’s? 

 

2.2.1.2.2  Disruptive Innovations 

Contrary to the above perspectives, Christensen proposes (1992a; 1992b) that 

although customers play a positive role in incremental innovations, they play a negative 

role in radical innovations.  Christensen contrasts disruptive innovations, defined as 

“those innovations that disrupted or redefined the performance trajectory”, with 

sustaining innovations, defined as “those innovations that sustained or reinforced 

established trajectories of product performance” (Christensen and Bower 1996).”  These 

terms parallel the distinctions between radical and incremental innovations. 

Christensen proposed that a firm’s current customers lead the firm to develop 

incremental innovations.  This results from a desire by the firm to keep their customers 

satisfied and attend to the firm’s current source of business.  This attention to the current 

customer results in not only a disproportionate amount “mind-share” at the firm but also 

in the allocation of resources in the development of incremental innovations to the 

exclusion of radical innovations.  Alternatively, new entrants to the market develop the 

disruptive innovations that redefine the current technology’s performance curve. 

These ideas emerged from Christensen’s examination of the disk drive industry.  

From 1960 to 1990, by staying close to their customers the incumbents in the industry 

made sustaining, or incremental, advances to their products which resulted in increased 

memory densities while using the same base technology (Christensen and Bower 1996).  

 

20


The disruptive disk drive innovations made by new entrants to the industry resulted in a 

smaller physical size of the disk drives.  Interestingly, at the time of introduction there 

was a significant overlap in performance, with the disruptive innovations possessing 

lower memory densities, but in a smaller size than the current drives.  After introduction, 

the new entrant firms followed a process of incremental innovations to increase the 

memory densities of their innovations to the level of incumbent firms.  Once the memory 

densities were equal, the size became dominant in the product selection decisions of the 

industry.  In this way, smaller disk drives came to be utilized in mainframe and 

minicomputers even when size initially did not matter. 

Christensen’s research provides a potential answer to the question of how strong, 

sophisticated firms could fall prey to new entrants.  Utilizing a resource allocation model, 

Christensen found that the incumbent firms were in many cases developing similar 

products to those launched by the new entrants, but the resources put toward these 

products were often reallocated to the incremental projects because of the perception of 

an immediate need by the customer.  The long-term effect of this is evident in the disk-

drive industry.  Thus, Christensen suggests that input from current customers results in 

incremental innovations, while radical innovations result from new entrants to the market 

that may not rely on customer input. 

While Christensen admonishes firms that it may be folly to “stay close to your 

customers,” the issues raised by Christensen may relate to the learning of the firm rather 

than to the role of the customer.  Consequently, studying the information the failed 

incumbent firms obtained from the customer and the learning of the firm may resolve the 

anti-customer perspective of the disruptive innovation literature. 

 

21


2.2.1.2.3  Definition of “Customer” 

One of the significant differences between the two views on customer input is the 

issue of who is considered the “customer.”  The lead user method requires reliance upon 

a specialized customer who is able to provide information ahead of the market.  Von 

Hippel’s lead users are found in the innovator category of the technology adoption curve 

(Rogers 1995) and typically provide their information during the front end of the 

innovation process.  On the other hand, as Christiensen found, the bias towards 

incremental rather than radical innovations seems to arise because customer requirements 

are obtained from a range of customers whose input is aggregated, providing “average” 

requirements.  Christensen’s work (1992a; 1992b; 1996) does not explicitly define the 

user, but instead suggests that current customers tend to express requirements consistent 

with their current needs.  Recognizing that all customers are not alike, a resolution of the 

conflicting roles of the customer in radical innovations is required (Thomke and Nimgade 

1998). 

For these reasons, a modification of Nambisan’s (2002) definition of customer 

which includes both current and potential users of a product is utilized.  This definition is 

consistent with von Hippel’s conceptualization of the lead user, except that technical 

experts from other fields are not included in the current definition of customer because 

they will most likely never be users of the product.  Due to the newness of technology 

and market for radical innovations, this definition of customer does not include the 

“average” users encountered by Christensen. 

This conceptualization of the customer does not assume that all information 

utilized in the new product development process is provided by the customer.  Rather, the 

 

22


assumption is that information provided by the customer may be relevant to the firm 

developing a radical innovation because of the ability of the customer to provide both 

information on the market as well as the technology.  There may in fact be other sources 

of information available to the firm.  The customer is but one of these sources. 

 

2.2.1.2.4  Synthesis 

Theories of the firm, incremental innovation and lead user research suggest an 

active, positive role of the customer in the development of radical innovations, whereas 

disruptive technology research casts doubt over the role of the customer in commercially 

successful innovations.  The review can be distilled down to two key points, (1) 

customers may or may not provide information throughout the development of a radical 

innovation and (2) this information may or may not be valuable in reducing uncertainty in 

the development of radical innovations. 

 

2.2.1.2.5  Outcome - Product Business Performance 

The result of the product development process is certainly not a dichotomous 

success or failure.  Rather, the development and commercialization of radical innovations 

result in both technical and business performance of the innovation.  Because technical 

performance results in a product’s categorization as a radical innovation, the technical 

performance of the product is not addressed. 

The business performance, however, is the critical outcome of the new product 

development process.  A new product’s business outcome is multidimensional, consisting 

 

23


of market share, sales volume, revenue, profitability, and performance relative to the 

competition (Griffin and Page 1993). 

Consequently, assessing the success of a newly developed product is difficult.  

The difficulty manifests as the different measures of performance implemented by 

practitioners and researchers (Griffin and Page 1993).  Griffin and Page’s (1993) review 

of performance present five measures they found to be consistent between academicians 

and practitioners (Table 2-2).  These are firm benefits, financial performance, program-

level measures, product-level measures, and customer acceptance which includes market 

share and customer satisfaction (Griffin and Page 1993).  The first four measures relate to 

the internal operations of the developing firm, thus assessing efficiencies internal to the 

firm.  The fifth measure relates directly to the sales performance of the product which 

captures the “approval” of the market for a new product as an external performance 

measure. 

While the first four measures provide a comprehensive view of the firm’s 

performance; because the research addresses the role of the customer in the new product 

development process, an outcome measure related to the customer’s perspective of the 

NPD process (customer acceptance) must also be included.  The customer may 

communicate their acceptance or rejection of a product through their purchase decision.  

Consequently, business performance of a radical innovation will be assessed through the 

market share of that product as well as the performance relative to the firm’s 

expectations. 

 

 

24


2.2.2  Radical Innovations 

Should the role of the customer be different in the development of radical 

innovations?  According to Henderson and Clark (1990) radical innovations are “based 

on a different set of engineering and scientific principles and often open up whole new 

markets and potential applications.”  This definition of radical innovations may be broken 

down into two distinct parts related to the “newness” of the technology and the 

“newness” of the market (Table 2-1) (Booz 1982; Garcia and Calantone 2002). 

Technology and technical information is defined as the technological aspects of 

content, needs, uniqueness, and trends of the product; while market information is 

defined as information related to the existence of a market, market size, market growth, 

competitor information, and environment for the product.  The assumption in this 

dissertation is that technology and market information inform the design of the product.  

It is possible that the technology and market information could influence the business 

processes in relation to a radical innovation, but this research focuses on the product 

itself.  Additionally, this research assumes that there is no interaction between the 

technology and market dimensions of information obtained from the customer. 

Opening up “whole new markets” is often considered a benefit for a firm because 

the initial pressures from competitors will be limited due to a first mover advantage 

(Lieberman and Montgomery 1999; Lieberman and Montgomery 1988; Van derWerf and 

Mahon 1997).  However, this is not always the case, consider the Segway transport 

device.  Certainly the makers of the Segway were hoping to open a “new” market for that 

innovation (Delphi 2001; Segway 2002) .  The Internet is another example of a product or 

innovation that successfully created a new market. 

 

25


In addition to finding new solutions to new problems, a new approach to an old 

problem (i.e. potential application) may also be categorized as a radical innovation that 

opens up a new market.  The transfer of inkjet technology to the microarrayer market 

from the computer printer market represents a new solution to an old problem (Agilent 

2003). 

From the technology perspective, the “different set of engineering and scientific 

principles” could represent a range of “newness” of the technologies.  These technologies 

may include the brand new, cutting edge innovations, such as the Internet, which would 

represent innovations that are new to the world.  The move of a technology, like antilock 

brakes moving from airplanes to automobiles, from one market to a new market 

represents a radical innovation to the new market, but from a global perspective the 

innovation is less radical because the technology has been seen before. 

Because the dimensions of market and technology newness correspond to market 

and technology uncertainties within the firm, it is likely that the firm will solicit different 

levels of information from the customer depending upon the innovations levels of 

newness. 

An inherent difficulty with new to the world radical innovations is that consumer, 

technological, and competitive uncertainties exist in abundance and the role of the 

customer in relieving these uncertainties is unclear.  If the customer cannot understand 

the innovation, they may only provide general market information, with little information 

regarding the application of a specific technology.  For example, in the 1980s, the 

traditional computer customer, corporate Chief Information Officers (CIOs) did not 

understand the radical innovation of the personal computer (PC) (Christensen 1992a; 

 

26


Christensen 1992b), so asking them their needs for the PC resulted in Digital Equipment 

Corporation (DEC) stating that the market for PCs was only a few thousand (Freiberger 

and Swaine 1984).  Eliciting beneficial information from the customer is one of many 

challenges facing firms developing radical innovations. 

Because radical innovations represent a change in the market and/ or technology, 

the firm must resolve these types of uncertainty.  The combination of the market and 

technology newness in Table 2-1 yields a potential explanation of the different types of 

radical innovations and provides insight into firm uncertainties related to the market and 

technology.  Consequently, differences in the levels of market and technology 

information obtained from the customer may be explained by the different levels of 

radical innovations. 

 

2.2.3  New Product Development Process 

Within and between organizations, there is significant variability in the new 

product development (NPD) process (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Urban and Hauser 

1993; Zirger and Maidique 1990).  However, the development of a product is typically a 

multi-step process that involves moving from the development of an idea to the ultimate 

commercialization of a product (Table 2-3.)  The complexity of the process varies with 

the complexity of the desired product and type of innovation.  For instance, an 

incremental innovation to add a feature to a product may not require the full NPD process 

(Zahay et al. 2004), but a radical innovation may require the full development process to 

develop the product from scratch.  Along with the number of steps in the process, 

questions regarding the personnel required in the NPD process and information demands 

 

27


to reduce the firm’s uncertainties further complicate an already complex situation.  The 

complexity and uncertainty associated with the difficult task of developing, designing, 

and commercializing a new product contribute to the need for understanding this 

problem. 

To understand the role of the customer in the NPD process, the stages of the 

process must be explored.  Crawford and Di Benedetto present a typical five stage new 

product development process which consists of 1) Opportunity identification and 

selection, 2) Concept Generation, 3) Concept/Project Evaluation, 4) Development, and 5) 

Launch (Crawford and Di Benedetto 2000).  This basic model agrees closely with models 

presented by Song and Montoya-Weiss (1998), Urban and Hauser (Urban and Hauser 

1993), and Johnne and Snelson (1988), while Cooper and Kleinschmidt (1986) provide 

more detailed individual NPD activities.  These stages may represent discrete steps 

within a firm, but they are often overlapped with other steps as concurrent activities to 

accelerate the NPD process (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995). 

The five stages represent the core activities of most models; however, the first 

three activities may be broadly considered the idea generation and selection phase of the 

NPD process..  Because the information needs for the firm vary for each stage of NPD, it 

is likely that the multi-dimensional information from the customer vary over the course 

of the NPD process, with the importance and relevance of the customer’s information 

changing with each stage in the process.  Each of these steps contains some opportunity 

or need for TAMI information to relieve the uncertainty within the firm (Table 2-4). 

 

 

28


2.2.3.1 

Idea Generation and Selection 

 

2.2.3.1.1  Opportunity Identification and Selection 

The opportunity identification stage requires the evaluation of a firm’s 

marketplace or potential marketplace to determine a possible need that is not being met.  

Crawford and Di Benedetto (2000) describe this stage as “generating new product 

opportunities as spinouts of the ongoing business operation (p. 25).”  In a conventional 

sense, this stage requires using current customers and the needs of the current market as 

the mold for the new products to be developed.  Alternatively, the firm may need to rely 

upon potential customers in a target market to assess product opportunities. 

As the beginning of the NPD process, this stage is critical for setting the direction 

of future NPD projects and development activities (Crawford and Di Benedetto 2000).  A 

significant aspect of this stage involves the identification of market opportunities.  Is 

there a new market for a given technology?  Can the firm capitalize on product 

knowledge in an arena different from their current arena?  Depending upon the type of 

innovation, the firm may be seized by uncertainties in the consumer, technological, and 

competitive dimensions. 

At the opportunity identification stage, it is likely that the customer contributes a 

greater amount of market information than technology information (Zahay et al. 2004).  

The market information could relate to a need to deliver varied drugs in a manner that a 

consumer could utilize, to a faster method of generating DNA arrays, or to a need or 

desire for better control of catheters.  Recognizing these broad opportunities, the 

 

29


innovating firms may select to further pursue solutions to the discovered market 

opportunities. 

 

2.2.3.1.2  Concept Generation 

This stage requires taking the information from the opportunity identification and 

selection stage and generating a project concept.  Can the ideas take shape to exploit the 

opportunities?  What is the shape of the ideas?  Are there enough options?  Depending 

upon the level of “radical-ness” of the product, the customer may provide specific 

feedback on product concepts or general feedback on the firm’s conceptualization of the 

market’s needs. 

At this stage, the customer may provide more technical information than market 

information, as the firm begins to propose product concepts.  For instance, input for the 

product concept that lead to the ViaDerm (ViaDerm 2004)system may have dealt 

explicitly with specific compounds that the firm wanted to deliver and the need for 

customers to be able to administer the drugs to themselves.  The technical input for the 

microarrayer (Agilent 2003) also requires an understanding of the current systems.  From 

that starting point, in certain cases the customer can provide input to the concept 

generation stage of development.  This input may also help to narrow the scope of 

product concepts. 

 

2.2.3.1.3  Concept / Project Evaluation 

The evaluation of the product concept or project requires both internal and 

external acceptance of the output of the concept generation stage.  Of the concepts 

 

30


generated, are there viable solutions for the customer?  Do the concepts generated meet 

the market and technology needs of the customer?  This stage may reveal concepts that 

meet needs that the customer didn’t realize they had, thus opening the door for radical 

innovations.  Alternatively, firms may realize that they generated concepts that missed 

the needs of the market.  Finally, by providing focus to the firm, customer input may be 

used to improve or facilitate the evaluation process itself. 

 

2.2.3.2  Development 

This stage represents the transition from ideas to products.  At this point the ideas 

are taken from the design drawings and molded into physical products or services.  

Limitations to the design and technologies will be met and traded off with the original 

requirements for the products.  The market and technology requirements must be 

reviewed (Urban and Hauser 1993) to insure that there will be sufficient advantage to the 

customer to purchase the developed product.  The development phase of the NPD process 

requires the firm to integrate information obtained from the customer with their own 

conceptualizations of the new product. 

 

2.2.3.3  Launch 

The products that have been refined in the development stage must now be 

manufactured and sold.  This involves both the marketing and operations functions.  The 

marketing plan must evaluate the pricing and distribution aspects of the product, while 

operations work to successfully manufacture the product quickly and efficiently. 

 

31


After a design emerges, the customer may provide necessary feedback on the 

outcome of the process.  Most likely, the actual product will be a result of compromises 

and design trade-offs (McGrath 2001).  Even with direct input, it is still possible that the 

resulting product will not meet technology and market expectations.  A classic example 

of this is the Edsel (the dubious automobile produced from 1958-1960), designed with all 

the features customers desired, but a final product too ugly to behold (Mello 2003).  The 

launch phase provides the ultimate opportunity for feedback, the purchase decision.  

Preceding the ultimate decision, however, the customer may provide information 

necessary for pricing, integration, and distribution decisions.  Throughout the entire 

process, the customer may provide different types of information relevant to the eventual 

business performance of a new product. 

 

2.2.3.4 

Synthesis 

The five stage model provides many details critical to the NPD process; however, 

to simplify the strategic model and the implementation of the research, the first three 

stages have been collapsed into one stage.  Thus, the strategic model contains three broad 

stages of NPD: 1) Idea Generation and Evaluation (which contains Opportunity 

Identification and Selection, Concept Generation, and Concept / Project Evaluation), 2) 

Development, and 3) Launch.  This simplified conceptualization of the NPD process is 

consistent with the spirit of other models of NPD (Crawford and Di Benedetto 2000). 

 

 

32


2.2.4  Organizational Learning 

Because new product development has been shown to be critical to business 

success, researchers tend to focus upon the new product development process to the 

exclusion of other organizational issues (Bobrow 1997; McGrath 2001).  The reality, 

though, is that the NPD process operates within a firm, and consequently, is impacted by 

the firm’s personnel, management, and culture.  Because of the relation between the firm 

and the NPD process, how information is gleaned from the customer and utilized to 

increase the business performance of products and generate success for a firm must also 

be considered.  It is this question which leads to the discussion of organizational learning 

(OL). 

Studies have shown that there is a significant relation between organizational 

learning and market orientation, with organizational learning being a requirement for a 

market oriented firm to succeed (Slater and Narver 1994) with their new product’s 

performance (Baker and Sinkula 1999).  Organizational learning is the “means by which 

knowledge is preserved so that it can be used by individuals other than its progenitor” 

(Sinkula 1994).  The process by which information is converted to knowledge for use 

within the firm has been specified by Huber (1991) as four organizational learning 

constructs: actions related to knowledge acquisition, information dissemination, 

information utilization, and organizational memory, that lead to intended or unintended 

benefits to the firm. 

The NPD process has been conceptualized as a method of relieving uncertainty 

regarding a firm’s business, with the amount of uncertainty reducing over the course of 

the NPD project (Hart et al. 1999).  A critical antecedent to the ability of the firm to 

 

33


overcome their internal uncertainties is the firms organizational learning (Hurley and 

Hult 1998).  Uncertainty reduction first requires the acquisition of information.  It is at 

this point in organizational learning that the hypothesized types of customer information, 

market and technical, are first obtained.  Second, information dissemination relates to the 

circulation of the acquired information beyond the person “generating” or acquiring the 

information.  Limited information distribution has been presented in the literature as a 

barrier between R&D and marketing in the NPD process (Balachandra and Friar 1997; 

Griffin and Hauser 1996; Leenders and Wierenga 2002; Pisano 1990). 

Third, information utilization is critical to organizational learning.  How is the 

acquired and distributed information utilized?  The utilization step is clearly exhibited in 

the concept generation and development stages in the NPD process.  It is upon this stage 

that the NPD process rests, because the products choices and designs will flow from these 

interpretations.  Finally, organizational memory relates to the long-term retention of 

information (Huber 1991).  This has been presented in the literature as a firm’s absorptive 

capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990), or ability to retain knowledge, and may result in 

empathic design, (the ability of a firm to design products for a market utilizing only 

internal information, with no direct input from the customer) (Leonard-Barton 1995).  

Overall, a firm will benefit the most, i.e., have successful new products, from a market 

orientation if they are able to “learn” from what they observe in the market. 

A significant difficulty arises for the organizational learning of a firm involved 

with the NPD of radical innovations.  Because of the inherent newness of radical 

innovations, there may be greater difficulty in finding and interpreting sources of 

 

34


information.  This difficulty in obtaining information may challenge the firm in assessing 

the validity or implementing the ideas of the information. 

In addition, in uncertain environments the organizational memory or previously 

learned knowledge may be out of date and inappropriate for use in the current market or 

technology environment, leading to a tension between the need for new learning and 

unlearning inappropriate past knowledge (Johnson and Dilts 2006).  Thus, in highly 

uncertainty environments the benefit of these two aspects of organizational learning, 

information acquisition and organizational memory, may be at odds with each other.  For 

example, in an environment with low uncertainty, the firm will need to acquire lower 

amounts of market and technology information, and their memory will remain current 

and beneficial.  In a very uncertain environment however, firms will seek to relieve 

uncertainties with high levels of information acquisition, and the knowledge stored in 

their memory will be less useful.  An example of this is seen in the development of the 

many examples of flat screen LCD and Plasma televisions.  Firms manufacturing the 

classic cathode ray tube (CRT) type of television may have relied upon their outdated 

knowledge, leading them to continue making incremental improvements in their CRT 

technology, while the market environment has been driven to the radical innovations of 

the LCD and Plasma technologies. 

Organizational Learning is a firm-level competency, such that multiple projects 

within a firm would be similarly impacted by the organizational learning of the firm.  The 

information obtained from the customer occurs at the individual new product 

development project level.  So, organizational learning describes the firm level 

 

35


environment, while TAMI information addresses a specific product as a subset of the 

information acquisition process. 

 

2.2.5 

Synthesis 

The preceding sections have developed the theoretical justification of this 

research and a model to be tested.  First, the role of the customer with regard to the firm 

was evaluated.  From the theories of the firm, the resource-based, information-based, and 

knowledge based views of the firm, a positive role of the customer emerged.  Looking 

next at the role of the customer in incremental innovations, a positive role of the customer 

exists, but the differences between incremental and radical innovations may complicate 

the role of the customer in the development of radical innovations.  Next two distinct and 

well studied views of customer involvement were reviewed.  The Lead User 

methodology assumes a positive role of the customer with the customer being selected by 

their “advanced” characteristics.  In contrast to the lead user methodology, Christensen’s 

disruptive innovations research suggests that customers may not be involved in the 

development of radical innovations because their involvement will lead to incremental or 

sustaining innovations.  To resolve the conflict in these two views of the customer, the 

definition of “customer” includes either current or potential users of the products. 

The evaluation of the product is critical to the assessment of the value of customer 

input.  Because success may be defined in many ways, the performance of the newly 

developed product may be assessed by its market business performance as well as by the 

perceptions of the firm developing the product.  The assessment of the product is made 

more difficult by how radical of it is. 

 

36


Defining how radical the innovation is can be accomplished by splitting the 

definition of radical innovation into its components.  These include both a market and 

technology aspect.  Thus, a given innovation may be defined by how new it is to the 

technology and the market.  The literature suggests that the most difficult products to 

develop usually require the complete new product development process. 

The NPD process consists of three major activities.  These include the idea 

generation and selection, development, and product launch.  Each activity provides an 

opportunity for input from the customer, with the information needs of the firm varying 

according to the stage of the process. 

Finally, because NPD occurs within a firm, the concept of organizational learning 

was reviewed.  Using an information approach to organizational learning, four 

components emerge: information acquisition, information dissemination, information 

utilization, and organizational memory.  These components provide insight into what 

happens to the information obtained from the customer in the NPD of a radical 

innovation. 

Given the theoretical perspectives identified in the literature, specific hypotheses 

for the role of the customer in the development of radical innovations are developed. 

 

2.3 

Hypothesis Development 

 

2.3.1 

 

Information obtained from the customer and the level of business performance 
of a radical innovation 

 
 
This research is interested in a specific aspect of the NPD process, the acquisition 

37


of customer information.  Models of the NPD process (cf., Booz, Allen, and Hamilton 

1982; Cooper and Kleinshmidt 1986; Song and Montoya-Weiss1998) may be distilled 

down into three key sets of activities: 1) Idea Generation, 2) Development, and 3) 

Product Launch.  The idea generation stage requires the evaluation of a firm’s 

marketplace or potential marketplace to determine a possible unmet need.  The 

development stage represents the transition from ideas into designs.  During the launch 

stage, products are taken from the design drawings and are molded into physical products 

that can be manufactured and sold.  It is predicted that, because the information needs of 

the firm vary across the stages of NPD, the extent of information obtained from the 

customer is likely to vary across the stages of the NPD process, with the importance and 

relevance of the customer’s information changing with each stage. 

 

H1a: The level of technology information obtained from the customer in the development 
of a radical innovation will vary according to the stage of the NPD process (idea 
generation, development, and product launch) in which such information is obtained. 

H1b: The level of market information obtained from the customer in the development of 
a radical innovation will vary according to the stage of the NPD process (idea generation, 
development, and product launch) in which such information is obtained. 
 
 
2.3.2 

The stages of the new product development process, information obtained from 
the customer, and the level of business performance of the radical innovation. 

 
 
Technology and market information are likely to be utilized during the different 

stages of NPD, where high levels of technology and market information should relieve 

the uncertainty associated with managerial decision-making within each stage.  Hence, 

the business performance of a radical innovation may be influenced by how much 

information is obtained at each stage of the NPD process. 

H2a: Higher levels of technology information obtained from the customer in the 

 

38


 
 

development of a radical innovation will result in higher levels of business performance 
of the radical innovation contingent upon the stage of the NPD process (idea generation, 
development, and product launch) in which such information is obtained. 
 
H2a: Higher levels of market information obtained from the customer in the development 
of a radical innovation will result in higher levels of business performance of the radical 
innovation contingent upon the stage of the NPD process (idea generation, development, 
and product launch) in which such information is obtained. 
 
 
2.3.3 

The organizational learning of the firm, information obtained from the customer, 
and the level of business performance of a radical innovation 

It is the use, not just the collection, of information that is critical to the 

development of a radical innovation.  Beyond the direct effect of customer information 

on the new product outcome, firms that are better able to learn should derive greater 

benefit from customer information than firms that are less able to learn.  It has been 

linked to the concept of organizational innovativeness (Calantone et al. 2002), which has 

been associated to business performance (Hult et al. 2004). 

 

Ultimately, organizational learning is a measure of the firm’s ability to acquire 

information, distribute it, interpret it, and store it in a manner that allows for the 

conversion of information into useful knowledge.  Such learning will influence the 

information firms seek, as well as what the firm will do with the information once it has 

been obtained.  A firm that does not have the capability to convert information into 

knowledge will be less likely to generate a successful product than a firm that can convert 

information into knowledge.  Thus, while organizational learning occurs at the firm level, 

it will directly affect performance of a radical innovation as well as potentially moderate 

the amount of information sought from the customer. 

 

 

39


H3: Higher levels of business performance of the radical innovation are positively 
associated with: 
 

(a) higher levels of information acquisition 
(b) higher levels of information dissemination 
(c) higher levels of information utilization 
(d) higher levels of organizational memory 

 

2.3.4 

Interaction of Organizational Learning and Information Levels 

Organizational learning is critical to the success of new product development.  Of 

the four components comprising organizational learning, information acquisition is likely 

to be the foundation of the success of the organization.  As Di Benedetto (1999) states, 

“activities that generate information on customer, competitive, or economic changes are 

critical for controlling and fine tuning the product, process, and/or marketing strategy.”  

Reinforcing the argument for collecting information, Calantone et al. (2002) suggest that 

“learning occurs largely through organizational interaction with and observation of the 

environment.” A link between organizational learning and information processing 

(Sinkula 1994) relates the active versus passive acquisition of information without 

addressing the source of the information.  From another perspective, the Customer 

Knowledge Process of organizational learning theory which addresses the acquisition of 

information related to the customer and the integration of that information into the NPD 

process was supported by Li and Calantone (1998).  Consequently, in a post hoc analysis 

the possible interaction of the firm’s organizational learning and the information obtained 

from the customer and the effect of the learning-information relation on a radical 

innovation’s business performance is explored.

2.4 

Study Context, Measurement, Design and Sampling Method 

 

2.4.1 

Study Context 

The context selected for this study is the medical devices market.  As seen in the 

FDA’s definition of medical devices ((FDA 2002b)), the market is broad.  A medical 

device is: 

"an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, 
or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is: 

• 

• 

• 

recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States 
Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, 
intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or 
intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other 
animals, and which does not achieve any of it's primary intended purposes 
through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and 
which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of 
its primary intended purposes.” (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/mdr-
general.html) 

The medical device market is a complex mix of manufacturers, hospitals, 

 
 
 

physicians, nurses, patients, insurance, and regulation.  In 1976 the FDA was tasked with 

the mandate to “review and monitor the manufacture and use of medical technologies.  

The 1976 Medical Device Amendments (1976) classified medical devices according to 

the comparative risks of the devices.  These three classes of devices included Class I (e.g. 

tongue depressors or bandages), Class II (e.g. infusion pumps, powered wheelchairs), and 

Class III (e.g. replacement heart valves, silicone gel-filled breast implants, and implanted 

cerebella stimulators) (FDA 2002a). 

 

Class III products require the highest level of FDA oversight.  This includes pre-

market approvals of the products prior to the marketing of that product.  The pre-market 

 

41


approval provides a scientific review of the product to insure its safety and effectiveness 

as a Class III device.  A significant exception to this policy is the 510(k) amendment.  

This amendment allows a firm to market a product with pre-market notification if the 

product is substantially equivalent to pre-amendment (i.e., introduced to the U.S. market before 

May 28, 1976) Class III devices.  This allows a firm to significantly shorten the regulatory cycle 

typical of new Class III devices.  While the medical device market is ripe for the development of 

radical innovations, the regulatory controls of the FDA may inhibit the development of radical 

innovations and, consequently, the role of the customer in the development of radical innovations 

(1976). 

 

Two questions immediately arise with regard to the research context: 1) why only 

one market and 2) why the medical device market?  While previous work has evaluated 

the new product development process across a number of industries, as Rochford and 

Rudelius (1997) suggest, collecting data across industries may mask trends that would 

otherwise be revealed from a single industry analysis.  The exploratory nature of this 

research justifies the potential reduction in generalizability that results from using a 

single industry. 

Three factors make the medical device industry an ideal context for the study of 

the role of the customer in the development of radical innovations.  First, the $74 billion 

medical device industry has historically produced innovations that have revolutionized 

segments of the industry.  These innovations range from cardiac stents to magnetic 

resonance imaging (MRI) and digital X-rays.  Second, the federal government has 

investigated deficiencies in the medical devices industry, and has identified the NPD 

process as an opportunity to rectify some of the industry’s deficits (FDA 2004).  There 

has been a drive for more translational research which brings innovations from the 

 

42


laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside, by increasing the speed of development, the 

efficiency of the NPD process, and its effectiveness in developing the right products for 

the right market (Translational Research Working Group).  Translational research seeks 

to identify useful innovations and generate effective products more quickly than has been 

capable in the past (Contopoulos-Ioannidis et al. 2003).  Third, from a managerial and 

public policy standpoint, there is a substantial benefit from a study of the medical devices 

industry:  firms may be spending time working with customers when there is no need, or 

they may be minimizing contact with customers when the firms should utilize customer 

input for new health care treatments and devices.  Thus, resolving the role of the 

customer in NPD may help firms, the industry and the patient population. 

To address the hypotheses, the constructs utilized in the operationalization of the 

hypotheses must be explored.  The constructs required for this research include: 1) the 

level of technical and market information provided by the customer during the stages of 

the development of a radical innovation, 2) market and technology newness of the radical 

innovation, 3) organizational learning, 4) the product’s business performance, and 5) 

common control variables.  The majority of the constructs have been utilized in prior 

research. 

 

2.4.2  Measurement 

Measures of all constructs, except for the customer information levels and NPD 

stages, were drawn from prior research.  (See Table 2-5.)  While the majority of the 

measures relate to the innovation level unit of analysis, certain measures relate to the 

level of the organization developing the radical innovation.  These include organizational 

 

43


learning and the business unit sales, number of employees, and other firm characteristics.  

The measures provide illumination of the NPD process from both a tactical (information 

levels) and a strategic (organizational learning) perspective.  Thus, the research 

investigates what happens within a specific NPD project, as well as how the firm’s 

characteristics influence the process. 

 

2.4.2.1  Customer Input 

Building upon the information types identified by Zahay et al. (2004)3, the nature 

and amount of market and technical information obtained from the customer was 

assessed for each stage of the NDP process and for the total process.  To insure clarity of 

the measurement, market information is defined as information related to market size, 

market growth, competitor information, and the environment, while Technical 

Information is defined as information on technology content, technical needs, technology 

uniqueness, and technical trends.  Using a 7-point Likert scale (see Appendix 1), 

respondents were asked how much market and technology information the firm obtained 

from the customer during each phase of the NPD process. 

 

2.4.2.2  Customer Characteristics 

The characteristics of the customer are that of a customer or user at the front of 

the technology adoption curve.  They may be able to provide both market and technology 

information to a firm developing a radical innovation.  Consequently, the identity of the 

customer may be captured based upon their technology and market contribution, as well 

                                                 
3 Information types : strategic, financial, project management, customer, needs, technical, competitor, 
regulatory (Zahay et al. 2004) 

 

44


as their propensity to adopt new technologies or seek out solutions to their technology 

problems. 

The key difference between these customers and lead users (von Hippel 1986) is 

in the timing of the acquisition of information from the customer.  This distinction allows 

the utilization of  a “lead user” scale implemented in Morrison et al. (2000) and Franke 

and Shah (2003) that provides a measure of how innovative the customer informant may 

be. 

 

2.4.2.3 

Product Business Performance 

For the purposes of this research, the outcome measure of interest is the level of 

business performance of the radical innovation developed by the firm.  The business 

performance of the innovation is measured through the use of two scales utilized by Song 

and Parry (1997a; 1997b): (1) the market share performance to capture the market 

acceptance of the developed innovation and (2) the new product performance relative to 

the firm’s expectations to capture the product’s business performance from the firm’s 

perspective.  Two measures are used to accommodate different respondent interpretations 

of success; market share represents an external perspective on performance and new 

product performance represents an internal perspective relative to firm expectations.  

(Hereafter, this construct is called “internal performance.”)  Market share is measured by 

a three item scale which assessed the market share of the radical innovation relative to 

competitor’s products and the firms own products (Song and Parry 1997a).  Internal 

performance was measured with a three-item scale that included profitability and sales 

volume assessments (Song and Parry 1997b). 

 

45


2.4.2.4  Organizational Learning 

 

Organizational learning is measured following the conceptualization proposed by 

Huber (1991).  The information acquisition processes of the firm was assessed using a 

five item scale developed in Moorman (1995).  This scale assessed the firm’s collection 

of information on customers, competitors, and experts in their market.  The information 

dissemination scale, developed by Sinkula et al. (1997), consists of three items that 

measure the dissemination of information within the firm.  The information utilization 

scale was developed by Maltz and Kohli (1996), utilizing seven items.  The scale 

captures the firm’s implementation of the information it acquires.  The organizational 

memory scale was developed by Moorman and Miner (1997).  This four item scale 

measures the amount of information that a firm possessed about their market and 

technology. 

 

2.4.2.5  Radical innovation 

The level of the radical innovation is determined through the level of market and 

technology newness.  Because some innovations may be more radical than others, 

technology newness was measured using a six item scale employed by Gatignon and 

Xuereb (1997) which assessed the newness of the technology to the market and 

competitive environment.  Market newness was measured with a five item scale 

developed by Danneels and Kleinschmidt (2001) that assessed the creation of a new 

market as well as whether the firm entered a new market. 

 

 

46


2.4.2.6 

Firm Characteristics 

The characteristics of the firm may influence many factors of this study.  For 

instance, the revenue size, number of employees, and age of the firm may be reflected in 

the organizational learning of the firm, with small, young firms being closely tied to the 

market and innovative behaviors.  Just as a firm’s level of organizational learning will 

provide insight into the culture of a firm, the firm’s demographic characteristics must be 

considered in an analysis of the firm’s success or failure in new product development.  

Control variables utilized by Atuahene-Gima (1995) and Baker and Sinkula (1999) that 

are consistent with the literature are implemented in the conceptual model 

 

2.4.2.7  Medical Device Control Variables 

In addition to the general control variables, the medical device domain requires 

additional control variables.  For instance, medical device development projects may 

utilize a trained medical professional or an end-use consumer as the information source.  

This may potentially play a role in either the propensity to seek information or the 

likelihood of the use of that information (Jacobson 2004).  This “source credibility” may 

significantly impact the process. 

Also, because there are, as defined by the FDA, different “types” of medical 

device products (FDA 1998) with each “type” facing different regulations (AdvaMed 

2004), that information must be captured to insure that the results may be interpreted in a 

meaningful and valid manner.

2.4.2.8  Covariates 

Guided by the literature, control variables were collected from each respondent 

(Atuahene-Gima 1995; Atuahene-Gima 2005; Baker and Sinkula 1999).  These 

covariates included the functional area and tenure of the respondent, the revenue 

generated by the product, total revenue of the developing firm or business unit, number of 

employees, number of years the firm was in the market, and the list price of the product. 

 

2.4.3  Design 

Data for this research were collected through the use of a survey instrument.  The 

role of the customer in the development of radical innovations was tested within one 

industry but across many firms.  While a case study approach could certainly be 

employed, it would require more firms than is practical to develop generalizable results.  

Consequently, after successful pre-test and sample frame determination, the primary 

method of data collection was a survey instrument. 

The survey instrument was developed based on commonly accepted methods such 

as Fowler (2002).  The validity of the constructs was assessed following Churchill (1979) 

and Podsakoff et al. (2003).  These professionals included product development 

managers, R&D managers, engineering managers, or marketing managers.  For inclusion 

in the interviews and the survey, these informants must be able to address the full extent 

of the research questions.  Pretest and pilot testing of the survey were utilized to further 

enhance the validity of the constructs. 

 

 

48


2.4.4 

Interviews and Pretest 

To provide a richer context for this research and further refine constructs from the 

literature, structured interviews were conducted using a preliminary survey instrument.  

Two sample frames were utilized for the pretest. 

The first sample frame was based upon the winners of the Medical Design 

Excellence Award (MDEA) (Cannon Communications 2005).  MDEA winning products 

are based upon a new or novel design that generated more than an incremental 

improvement in performance or treatment.  The award winning products are evaluated by 

a multidisciplinary group of judges that include a mix of medical practitioners, engineers, 

and design professionals.  The 2004 medical device award winners were selected and 

were contacted by electronic mail.  Of ten firms contacted, two telephone interviews were 

conducted. 

Due to the low number of contacts of MDEA award winners, one of the award 

judges was contacted.  Through this physician’s participation with the Association for the 

Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) (AAMI 2005), other AAMI members 

were contacted.  The AAMI members consist of firms that are developing medical device 

innovations that are considered radical within the industry.  Of the ten AAMI members 

emailed five agreed to participate in the study. 

 

The interviews revealed that the research questions were appropriate for the 

medical device industry.  The interviews also lead to the refinement of the definitions of 

the customer/user as well as some of the medical device definitions.

2.4.5 

Sample 

 

2.4.5.1  Quantitative Sampling Procedure 

To generate a representative sample of the medical device industry in the United 

States, three sample frames were utilized:  the FDA Medical Device Database (FDA 

2006),  members of InHealth: The Institute for Health Technology Studies (IHTS), and 

subscribers of the Medical Device & Device Industry trade publication.  The sample 

frames were merged and duplicates eliminated to insure only one contact per firm, 

thereby eliminating the possibility of multiple respondents from the same firm.  Then, the 

merged list was trimmed using the screening procedures described below -- so that it 

included only firms that might have developed radical innovations.  In addition, survey 

respondents were instructed to identify a specific radical product they had developed and 

complete the survey with regard to that product. 

Federal law requires the registration of medical devices with the FDA Medical 

Device Database.  The database was screened to obtain active Class II and Class III 

devices (which are typically the most sophisticated) released to the market within the 

prior five years.  This screening process yielded 1018 potential firms, of which 757 firms 

(74%) were randomly sampled.  Of the 757 firms contacted by telephone, 170 agreed to 

accept an email with a description of the study and a link to the online survey.  85 

surveys were completed, yielding an 11.2% response rate. 

The second sample frame consisted of members of InHealth: The Institute for 

Health Technology Studies (InHealth 2006), an organization tasked with promoting the 

development of medical devices.  Because InHealth member firms typically develop 

innovative devices, 256 CEOs and other corporate officers associated with the IHTS were 

 

50


emailed a request to participate.  27 surveys were completed yielding a 10.5% response 

rate. 

The third sample frame consisted of a screened email list from the Medical 

Device & Device Industry trade publication.  This list was screened for finished medical 

device manufacturers, rather than component manufacturers, in the United States.  From 

this sample frame 4100 emails were sent, resulting in 58 survey responses.  Unlike the 

first two sample frames, this frame did not allow for the pre-selection of radical 

innovation product categories.  Hence, respondents were relied upon to identify and 

report on their experience (or its lack) with a radical product innovation as described 

below.  Researchers have estimated that 10% of new products may be classified as 

radical (de Brentani 2001; Kamel et al. 2003; Kleinschmidt and Cooper 1991).  Hence, 

the effective sample size from the third frame is approximately (4100 x 10%) 410 firms 

with 58 responses yielding a response rate of 14.1%. 

Combining the responses from the sample frames yields (85 + 27 + 58 =) 170 

observations.  Differences among respondents from the three sample frames were tested 

by creating indicator (zero/one) variables to represent the three samples in our regression 

models. The coefficients of the indicator variables were not significantly different from 

zero (p < 0.05). 

 

2.4.5.2 

Sample Characteristics 

The unit of analysis for this research is the individual innovation.  Because this 

research focuses upon how customer input may impact the business performance of a 

product, the informants were instructed to identify a single product and complete the 

 

51


survey for that particular product.  In addition, the informants were asked to assess their 

firm’s organizational learning capabilities.  The organizational learning concept is 

typically applied at the firm level; however, because of the effect of a firm’s 

organizational learning on the development of a particular product, it is included at the 

individual product level (Li and Calantone 1998). 

 

2.4.5.3  Construct validity 

Pretest and pilot testing of the survey was utilized to confirm the validity of the 

constructs in the medical device market.  All scales used a seven point Likert-type scale 

(1=low and 7=high).  Some items were reverse coded to evaluate respondent reliability. 

The validity of the constructs was assessed following Churchill (1979) and 

Podsakoff et al. (2003).  Descriptive statistics and correlations of the scales are presented 

in Table 6, as are the correlation of scales, and the within-item correlation is reported on 

the diagonal.  All of the multi-item measures met the suggested .70 level for Cronbach’s 

alpha, and the within-construct item correlations are substantially higher than the 

between-construct item correlations.  As expected, variables representing interaction 

terms and direct effects of the model were positively correlated (Cohen et al. 2003).  

There was no evidence of multicollinearity among main effects variables. 

The constructs have been reviewed to determine whether they are formative or 

reflective (Jarvis et al. 2003).  As Jarvis et al. explore, the majority of constructs utilized 

in research are reflective, they “reflect” the nature of the construct.  As such, the items 

are highly correlated to each other and the construct, and an item could be removed 

without drastically affecting the construct.  With the exception of the Organizational 

 

52


Learning construct, the constructs utilized in this research are reflective.  Organizational 

Learning is a formative construct because the individual components of OL, information 

acquisition, information dissemination, information interpretation, and organizational 

memory, build in a “formative” way to portray organizational learning.  The individual 

items are weakly correlated and the OL construct would be radically changed by the 

omission of one of the sub-constructs. 

2.5 

Analysis and Results 

 

 

2.5.1  Analysis 

 
2.5.1.1 

Factor Analysis 

An exploratory factor analysis was performed to insure the loading of survey 

items to the intended constructs.  The data were analyzed using a multivariate linear 

regression.  A nested regression model was utilized to interpret, first the direct effects of 

proposed theoretical model and second, to assess the potential interaction relationships in 

the model. 

 

2.5.1.2  Repeated Measures ANOVA – The Interaction of Information and Stage 

A repeated measures analysis of variance with two within-subject factors was 

conducted using the uncentered data to test H1.  The two factors for the analysis were (1) 

the stages in which the information was obtained from the customer and (2) the type of 

information obtained from the customer. 

 

 

53


2.5.1.3  Multivariate Regression – Product Business Performance 

To test the remaining hypotheses, multivariate linear regression was utilized.  A 

model was developed for each of the two dependent variables of performance: market 

share and internal performance.  For both dependent variables, the analyses were 

performed in three stages.  First, the control variables were modeled as the independent 

variables.  Next, the information type for each stage of development and the 

organizational learning components were added to the model.  Finally, the interaction 

effects were added to the model for the post-hoc analysis. 

 

Business Performance = β1*MI1 + β2*MI2 + β3*MI3 + β4*TI1 + β5*TI2 + β6*TI3 + β7*IA 
+ β8*ID + β9*IU + β10*OM + βControl*Control Equation + ε 

Where: 
MIi – Customer Supplied Market Information at NPD Stage i 
TIi – Customer Supplied Tech. Information at NPD Stage i 
IA – Information Acquisition 
ID – Information Dissemination 
IU – Information Utilization 
OM – Organizational Memory 

 

2.5.1.4  Control Variables 

Domain and research specific factors as well as factors identified in the literature 

were controlled for in the statistical model.  The control factors explicitly related to this 

research include the firm’s organizational memory, the characterization of the customer, 

the newness of the innovation, the FDA classification, the number of years on the market, 

and the tenure of the informant.  All of the control variables were tested in the models.  

To develop the most parsimonious model possible, non-significant variables were 

removed from the models.  Consequently, the control equation follows: 

 

 

54


Control Equation = β11*IMN + β12*ITN + ε 
Where: 

IMN – Innovation Market Newness 
ITN – Innovation Technology Newness 

A number of constructs will be utilized to evaluate the demographics of the 

survey respondents.  These data will be used to evaluate the profile of the respondents, 

and as potential post-hoc explanations of the study results.  The descriptive constructs 

are: 

Descriptive Variables 

Customer Characteristics 
Customer Source by Position 
Firm Size – Number of Employees 
Firm Size – Sales Dollars 
FDA – FDA Classification of Medical Device 
IMN – Innovation Market Newness 
ITN – Innovation Technology Newness 

 

 

2.5.2  Results 

 

2.5.2.1  Descriptive Statistics 

Recall that the data from the three sample frames were collapsed for the analyses, 

where the sources of the samples were coded as indicators variables and included in the 

subsequent models.  The correlation matrix and descriptive statistics of the data are 

reported in Table 2-7.  The data do not exhibit skewness or kurtosis and the 

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality found the data to be normally distributed at 

p<.05.  In addition, the data were visually inspected to confirm the normality tests.  The 

independent variables in the models were mean centered prior to the creation of 

interaction terms (Cohen et al. 2003). 

 

55


A review of the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) (Table 2-8) indicates that 

Models 1 and 2 for both dependent variables market share performance and internal 

performance are free from collinearity.  As expected, the number of interaction terms 

produced multi-collinearity among the types and levels of information and the interaction 

terms. 

 

2.5.2.2 

Innovation Characteristics. 

The FDA system, which classifies products by sophistication and impact on the 

patient, acts as a proxy for innovativeness.  Of the products described by respondents 

14% were Class I (least regulated), 55 % were Class II, 19% were Class III (most 

regulated), and 11% were not classified (Figure 2-2).  The innovations that the 

respondents utilized in their responses possessed technology newness of 4.8 out of 7 and 

market newness of 4.7 out of 7 with 7 representing the most innovative devices.  The 

mean length of time in development was from 2 to 3 years (Figure 2-3) and the mean 

length of time on the market for the innovations was 2.75 years (Figure 2-4).  The median 

selling price of the devices was less than $1000 (Figure 2-5). 

 

2.5.2.3  Key Informants Characteristics 

For this study, informants were required to have knowledge of the new product 

development of a single radical innovation, the type and amount of information that 

customers’ provided, the organizational learning of the firm, and the performance of the 

product after release.  Because informant eligibility was based on these requirements, 

their characteristics and job titles varied.  For the total sample, the median level of NPD 

 

56


experience for the respondents was from 10 to 20 years (Figure 2-6) and the median level 

of sales for the responding firms was from $1 million to $5 million (Figure 2-7.  The size 

of the firm dictated what functions where relevant to a particular job title (Figure 2-8.  

The functional areas of the sample (see Table 2-9) consisted of 19.0% in R&D, 16.8% in 

management (VP and CEO level), 15.1% in regulatory affairs, 13.4% in marketing, 

12.3% in engineering, 3.9% in sales, and 1.7% in manufacturing. 

 

2.5.2.4  Customer Informer Characteristics – Who did firms talk to? 

The scale items for the customer characteristics are presented in Table 2-6.  The 

items incorporated in the scale assess: 

1.  Early awareness of products or solutions 
2.  Benef from early adoption of new products 
3.  If they have tested products for other manufacturers 
4.  Are they regarded as “cutting edge” in their fields 
5.  Have they improved and developed new techniques in their fields 
6.  Did they have needs that were not satisfied by existing products 
7.  Are they  dissatisfied with the existing equipment in the market 

 

These items typify the advanced customer, their cutting edge recognition of needs, and 

their attempts to solve their needs.  Each item was tested using a One-sample T test to 

determine if the mean was statistically different from the neutral point of the items.  They 

are positively, statistically significant from “neutral.”  On a Likert scale of one to seven, 

the mean and standard deviation for the customer characteristics scale are 5.3 and 1.1.  

The customer characteristics scale reliability is .86. 

 

2.5.2.5  The Interaction of Information and Stage 

The repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect for NPD stage, 

 

57


F(2,324)=3.737, p=.025, but not for information type, F(1,324)=3950, p=.331.  The 

interaction between NPD stage and information type is significant, F(2,324)=12.733, 

p<.001.  As shown in Figure 2, there is a decreasing linear trend for technology 

information and a positive U-shaped (quadratic) curve for market information. 

To further investigate the within-subject interaction of information type and stage, 

a repeated measures analysis of variance with one within-subject factor (stage) was 

performed separately for technology and market information testing for a linear and 

quadratic trend in each.  Technology information exhibited a main effect for stage, 

F(2,324)=3.551, p=.030, and a linear interaction effect by stage, F(2,324)=5.556, p=.020, 

but not a quadratic effect.  The decreasing linear relation of technology information by 

stage supports H1a.  For market information there was quadratic effect of stage.  The 

within-subjects contrasts indicates a positive quadratic relation of market information and 

stage of the NPD process, F(1,162)=24.723, p<.001, and an insignificant linear relation 

of market information and the stage of the NPD process F(1,162)=.024, p=.876.  The 

finding of market information varying by the stage of NPD process supports H1b.  Thus, 

information obtained from the customer varies by the type of information and when the 

information is obtained, supporting H1a and H1b. 

 

2.5.2.6  Effect of Customer Information on Market Share 

Model 1 in Table 2-8 shows that the control variables, the newness of the 

technology and the newness of the market, explain 12.4% of the variance in market share.  

Model 2 adds the direct effects of the market and technology information obtained by the 

customer during the three stages of the NPD cycle and the direct effects of the 

 

58


components of organizational learning.  The independent variables in Model 2 increase 

R2 by .16 (p = .002).  Of the six information-stage variables, technology information 

obtained during the idea generation stage is positively related to the market share (b=.25, 

p=.03) providing modest support for H2.  Newness of technology has a strong positive 

relation with market share in Model 1 (b=.37, p<.001) and in Model 2 (b=.38, p<.001).  

In contrast, newness of market has a strong negative relation in Model 1 (b=-.21, p=.013) 

and Model 2 (b=-.21, p=.011) to market share. 

 

2.5.2.7  Effect of Customer Information on Internal Performance 

Model 4 shows that the control variables explain 16.5% of the variance in the 

internal performance.  See Table 2-8.  Model 5 adds the direct effects of the market and 

technology information obtained by the customer during the three stages of the NPD 

cycle and the direct effects of the components of organizational learning.  The 

independent variables in Model 5 increase R2 by 17.8% (∆F = 3.776, p<.001).  Newness 

of technology has a strong positive relation with internal performance in Model 4 (b=.42, 

p<.001) and in Model 5 (b=.41, p<.001).  Newness of market has a strong negative 

relation to internal performance in Model 4 (b=-.28, p=.001) and in Model 5 (b=-.29, 

p<.001). 

 

2.5.2.8  Organizational Learning 

The results provide modest support of hypothesis H3b and H3c.  Of the four 

components of organizational learning in Model 2, information utilization has a 

significant, positive effect on market share (b=.24, p=.013).  Information dissemination 

 

59


has a strong positive relation with internal performance in Model 5 (b=.18, p=.023) and 

in Model 6 (b=.19, p=.025).  Information utilization has a strong, significant, positive 

effect on internal performance in Model 5 (b=.31, p=.001) and in Model 6 (b=.32, 

p=.002). 

In summary, there is modest support for the hypothesized relationship between 

Technology Information obtained during the Idea Generation stage of NPD and market 

share.  Additionally, there is support for a relationship between information utilization 

and both business performance measures, while information dissemination is only 

significant for the internal performance (p < 0.05). 

 

2.5.2.9  Does Organizational Learning Influence the Information-Performance 

Relationship? 

 
 

The literature has clearly established the need for organizations to learn, although 

not specifically in the development of radical innovations.  It is also clear that the 

learning of the organization is predicated on the acquisition of information.  Thus, in a 

post-hoc analysis the possible interactive effects of organizational learning on the relation 

between market and technology information and the product’s business performance 

were investigated. 

 

With two types of information collected, three stages of NPD, and four 

components of organizational learning, there are a total of 24 (2*3*4) interaction terms 

for the post-hoc analysis.  Because of the difficulty associated with predicting 24 three-

way interactions, in the post-hoc analysis the interactions were added to Models 2 and 4 

which resulted in the full Models, 3 and 6.  We expect that the higher the level of 

 

60


organizational learning of a firm, the greater the effects of customer obtained information 

on the business performance of the radical innovation. 

Models 3 and 6 present the results of the addition of the information-stage-

organizational learning interactions for both outcome variables.  Interaction terms for the 

customer information and organizational learning constructs were added in Model 3, 

resulting in an increase of R2 by 11%.  Model 3 shows one statistically significant 

interaction terms in support of the post-hoc analysis.  The interaction of technology 

information obtained during idea generation with the firm’s information utilization is 

positively related to market share (b=.51, p=.026). 

To further explore this interaction, the interaction was plotted using the 

procedures described by Cohen et al. (2003).  A simple regression line was developed 

and plotted for the significant interaction using the unstandardized regression coefficients 

and the centered values of the data.  Figure 3 shows that when information utilization is 

high, there is a positive relation between technology information obtained from the 

customer during idea generation and the market share of the innovation.  In contrast, 

when information utilization is low, there is a negative relation between technology 

information obtained during idea generation and market share. 

For internal performance, the interaction terms for the customer information and 

organizational learning constructs were added in Model 6.  Two of the twenty-four 

interaction terms are statistically significant.  First, the interaction of market information 

obtained in the idea generation stage with organizational memory resulted in a positive 

relationship with internal performance (b = .29, p=.045).  Figure 4, Panel A, shows that 

when organizational memory is greater, there is a positive relation between market 

 

61


information obtained from the customer during idea generation and the radical 

innovation’s internal performance.  In contrast, there is a negative relation between 

market information obtained from the customer during idea generation and the internal 

performance of the innovation for firms’ with low levels of organizational memory. 

Second, the interaction of market information obtained in the development stage 

and information dissemination resulted in a negative relation with internal new product 

success (b = -.38, p=.028).  Figure 4, Panel B, shows that when information 

dissemination is high, there is a negative relation between market information and the 

radical innovation’s internal performance.  In contrast, there is a positive relation between 

market information and the internal performance of the innovation for firms’ with low 

levels of information dissemination.  A similar pattern exists for the market share 

outcome measure, however it is not significant (p>0.05). 

 

 

2.6 

Discussion and Implications 

This study resolves conflicting views about the appropriate role of the customer in 

the development of radical innovations.  We studied when and how customer inputs 

should be obtained during the NPD process by investigating the level and timing of 

technology and market information obtained from the customer, their influence on 

business performance, and the moderating effect of the firm’s organizational learning.  

Our exploration of organizational learning has exposed the complex nature and 

importance of managing the capabilities of the firm. 

 

 

62


2.6.1  Customer Informer Characteristics 

Reviewing the customer characteristics obtained in this study it is evident that 

these firms are collecting information from advanced users.  While Franke and Shah 

(2003) found that their innovators scored a 4.1 on their customer characteristic scale 

while non-innovators scored 3.5, the firms in this study obtained information from 

customers scoring 5.3 out of 7.  Given this finding, it appears that a “lead user” may be 

the best source of information, and they may provide that information during the entire 

process rather than just in the fuzzy front end of innovation. 

 

2.6.2 

Technology and Market information 

The finding that both technology and market information obtained from the 

customer influence business performance provides support for the premise that customers 

provide useful information during the NPD process for radical innovations.  The pattern 

of information obtained during the NPD process indicates that the levels of information 

vary by stage.  Technology information levels show a decreasing linear pattern over the 

NPD process.  This pattern suggests that early in the NPD of a radical innovation, firms 

require higher levels of technology information than during the rest of the process.  A 

possible reason for this finding is that the firms attempt to obtain a sufficient quantity of 

information to support the entire NPD process.  Alternatively, technology information 

from the customer may only be relevant early in the NPD process for a radical 

innovation, or it is possible that, once a technology is selected for the product, it becomes 

fixed and is not easily changed.  This notion is supported by the results of the Model 2 

where technology information obtained during idea generation is linked to the market 

 

63


share of the product.  Taken together, more technology information is obtained early in 

the NPD process and the early technology information has a significant positive impact 

on market share. 

When viewed across the stages of NPD, the level of market information a firm 

obtains from its customers forms a U-shape (Figure 2-10).  Considering the activities 

associated with the NPD process, idea generation requires the assessment of market 

conditions and possibly a search for a new market – so it requires high levels of market 

information.  Next in the process is the development stage, which is more internally 

focused, and tends to center upon the more technical aspects of the products’ creation 

hence it requires less customer information.  During the launch stage, the levels of market 

information increase.  Considering the activities associated with actively pricing and 

marketing the new product, much of the market relevant information may come from 

customers. 

From the results of the analysis for H1, the levels of technology information are 

highest during the early stage of NPD and decrease linearly as NPD progresses.  

Therefore, it follows that if technology information were to be significant, it would be 

significant in the idea generation phase when higher levels of technology information 

were obtained.  Technology information during idea generation is significant for only the 

market share outcome variable and not the internal performance outcome variable.  Thus, 

it may be that to achieve success in the market, the early acquisition of technology 

information from the customer is critical, but from an internal perspective the complexity 

of the organization may complicate the internal performance assessment.   Furthermore, 

this suggests that there may be an “appropriate” time for a firm to obtain a particular type 

 

64


of information from the customer, but additional research is needed to support this idea. 

 

2.6.3  Organizational Learning 

The impact of a firm’s organizational learning on the business performance of an 

innovation differs by the type of performance.  Information utilization and information 

dissemination are positively related to internal performance, and information utilization is 

positively related to market share performance.  While not statistically significant, the 

effect of information dissemination on market share performance appears consistent with 

the internal performance. 

The utilization and dissemination of information relate to a functional measure of 

how information from the customer is applied to the NPD process.  Thus, it appears that 

there is a direct relation to not only what information a firm obtains, but also whether the 

firm is structured internally to capitalize on the information. 

 

2.6.4 

The Interaction of Organizational Memory and Market Information 

During the idea generation stage of development, many firms seek information 

related to the market to guide the NPD process.  As the information is obtained, the firm 

must store the information in memory to implement in the development of an innovation.  

The data revealed that organizational memory moderated the effect of the level of market 

information obtained in the idea generation stage on internal performance (i.e., relative to 

firm expectations).  (See Table 2-10 and Figure 2-11)  Thus, firms with high levels of 

organizational memory and low levels of market information obtained from the customer 

in the idea generation stage tend to have low internal performance.  When these same 

 

65


firms (those with high levels of organizational memory) have higher levels of market 

information the products tended to have higher levels of performance.  Conversely, firms 

with low levels of organizational memory showed an opposite relation to performance 

than that of the high organizational memory levels. 

The most striking relation occurred in firms with low levels of organizational 

memory.  The products developed by these firms performed at high levels with low levels 

of customer obtained market information, while high levels of customer information 

showed a decrease in the performance of the products.  As in the interaction of 

information utilization and technology information for market share, this finding may 

occur because of the fundamental approach a firm takes regarding customer information. 

Since information may be “perishable,” this result indicates that some firms may be 

retaining customer obtained information beyond its useful life.  The information a firm 

obtains from customers and the organizational memory of the firm have been shown to 

create conflict within the firm regarding the accuracy and appropriateness of the 

information utilized in NPD decisions (Johnson and Dilts 2006).  Firms with high levels 

of organizational memory are likely to be able to store customer information in a manner 

that they can utilize.  Firms that are not as oriented towards the market, such as hard-core 

technology firms, show decreased performance with increased levels of customer 

information because the information may confuse the process, leading to less successful 

products.  This is evident in the proliferation of features on handheld personal digital 

assistants and cell phones.  Based upon customer input, more features have been added to 

these devices than can conceivably be used (Evans-Pughe 2003).  Consider the iPhone 

with telephone service, internet connection, and audio and video capability.  Time will 

 

66


tell if the product will be successful, but in other cases, the complexity of these types 

devices has perplexed the market and reduced the market performance of the devices. 

Firms with high levels of organizational memory may be those firms with rigid 

processes.  This type of firm would be able to convert the organizational memory they 

have and the information they obtain during the idea generation stage into successful 

products.  These arguments may be reversed for firms with low levels of organizational 

memory.  The products of these firms perform better without the additional information 

during the idea generation stage.  Perhaps the flexibility of these firms allows them to 

utilize the additional information. 

 

2.6.5 

Information Utilization Moderates the Effect of Technology Information in Idea 
Generation 

 
The interaction of technology information obtained from the customer in the idea 

generation stage of the NPD process and the information utilization component of 

organizational learning on market share provides a potential unification of the lead user 

(von Hippel 1986) and the disruptive innovation (Christensen and Bower 1996) concepts.  

(See Table 2-11and Figure 2-12 Panel A)  The results show that firms with high levels of 

information utilization develop high market share performing products with more 

information from the customer.  Conversely, firms with low levels of information 

utilization produce products with lower levels of market share when they obtain more 

information, but demonstrate better performance with less information.  This result 

demonstrates that firms utilizing lead users (market oriented firms), such as 3M (von 

Hippel and Katz 2002), tend to perform better when they obtain more technology 

information during the idea generation stage, while firms that are less market oriented 

 

67


(more technology oriented), such as Xerox PARC, would not be able to successfully 

convert the customer information into successful products (Uttal 1983).  The interaction 

of information utilization with technology information obtained in the idea generation 

stage of NPD produces another striking example of the differences resulting from 

information utilization processes.  This difference of market share suggests that some 

firms succeed on low levels of information, and obtaining more information may create 

problems for those firms. 

 

2.6.6 

Information Dissemination Moderates the Effect of Market Information at 
Development Stage 

 
The development stage of the NPD process incorporates the conversion of 

product ideas to actual products.  At this stage, most models of the NPD process reveal an 

intensive level of effort applied to the product development.  From a general perspective, 

conventional wisdom suggests that within the firm, information cannot be applied to 

solving the NPD problem if it is not disseminated to those who need it.  The results 

suggest that the level of dissemination is important to the success of an innovation, but 

success also depends on the characteristics of the firm.  The interaction of information 

dissemination and market information obtained during the development stage yielded a 

negative relation.  (See Table 2-12 and Figure 2-1 Panel B)  Firms with high levels of 

dissemination demonstrated higher levels internal performance with lower levels of 

market information from the customer and lower levels of performance with higher levels 

of market information obtained from the customer.  Firms with lower levels of 

information dissemination showed higher levels of performance with higher levels of 

information. 

 

68


The potential mechanism for this relation may be found at the process level of 

NPD. Firms’ with efficient methods of information dissemination are also likely to be 

more rigid in their approach to NPD (Atuahene-Gima 2005).  This rigidity, coupled with 

the dissemination of information during the development stage, may result in 

complications or confusion in the process of developing radical innovations which then 

leads to lower levels of market share.  Firms with lower levels of information 

dissemination may be better able to convert the information obtained during the 

development stage into successful products.  The lack of a process for information 

dissemination may indicate a firm flexible and fluid enough to respond to the 

information.  This finding is consistent for both market share and the internal expectation 

performance measures. 

This stage may require that the firm enters development with some “stability” of 

their information.  For a firm to disseminate information and possibly destabilize the 

NPD process at this stage may result in a product developed by an inefficient process.  

Considering the firms with high levels of dissemination, this result provides a warning: 

during the development stage, the dissemination of market information from the customer 

may be a hindrance to the products’ business performance. 

 

2.6.7 

“Newness” of the Radical Innovation and Internal Performance 

The newness of the technology and of the market have a statistically significant 

effect on market share and internal performance (p < 0.05).  The positive effect of the 

newness of the technology on business performance suggests that firms that innovate and 

push the barriers of what the market knows are likely to develop new products that make 

 

69


a difference both in the market and for the firm.  The negative effect of the newness of 

the market on performance outcomes supports another conventional wisdom.  The 

newness of the market hinders the business performance of the newly developed product.  

Combining these findings, is appears that the best approach for a firm to take is to 

develop new technologies for existing markets.  Based solely upon the results for the 

newness of the technology and the newness of the market, a firm is likely to be more 

successful developing a new technology rather than developing a new market.  That 

finding is consistent with Christensen’s disruptive innovations theory, but highlights a 

weakness in the disruptive innovation theory.  That weakness results from Christensen’s 

definition, or lack thereof, of the customer and his focus on whether firms where 

incumbents or new entrants to a market.  Thus, it is possible that both incumbents and 

new entrants obtain customer information during NPD that lead to radical innovations 

that are new technologies in an existing market. 

 

 

2.7 

Conclusion, Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research 

2.7.1  Conclusion 

The findings suggest there are multiple factors that affect the business 

performance of a radical new product.  First, at the project level, the results show that the 

type of information obtained from the customer and when it is obtained may significantly 

affect the product’s business performance.  For example, technology information 

obtained from the customer during the idea identification stage of NPD was associated 

with higher levels of business performance of the radical innovation, whereas technology 

 

70


and market information obtained during the other stages of development do not appear to 

influence it. 

Secondly, the firm’s organizational learning capabilities are part of a complex 

relationship which may lead to the success of a new product.  The results of the model 

with the direct effects of organizational learning indicate that the information 

dissemination and information utilization are important to the positive business 

performance of radical innovations.  Thus, managers may be prompted to facilitate the 

dissemination and utilization of information obtained from the customer. 

Finally, the post-hoc analysis of the interactions of organizational learning with 

the customer information and product business performance suggests different strategies 

are appropriate depending upon the state of a firm’s organizational learning capabilities.  

For instance, during the Idea Generation stage of development, firms with high levels of 

information utilization developed products that performed at higher levels when they 

obtained more information.  Conversely, firms with low levels of information utilization 

performed better with low levels of customer information and worse when they obtained 

high levels of customer information.  A similar result was obtained for the interaction of 

organizational memory with market information obtained during the idea generation 

stage.  These differences in performance suggest the need for a strategic approach to 

NPD.  By recognizing the characteristics of their firms’, managers may be able to choose 

how much effort and expense should be allocated in the pursuit of customer information.  

The results also demonstrate that the development of radical innovations requires both 

project level (information type and stage) and strategic level (organizational learning) 

efforts by managers.

2.7.2 

Theoretical Implications 

 

This dissertation contributes to theory in several ways.  First, the research has 

demonstrated that there are multiple types of information obtained from customers in the 

development of radical innovations.  This finding is important because it contradicts 

Christensen’s disruptive innovation research suggesting that customer information leads a 

firm to develop incremental innovations. 

 

Second, this research has demonstrated that the information obtained from the 

customer varies over the course of the NPD process.  The types of information obtained 

from the customer, technology and market information, are consistent with the 

information obtained using von Hippel’s lead user methodology.  The lead user 

methodology incorporates information from the customer at the beginning, but not 

throughout the process.  These findings extend the lead user research because the 

information is obtained over the course of the NPD process. 

 

Third, in addition to showing that information from customers varies by type and 

stage, the research shows a positive effect on the performance of the product.  Despite the 

moderate strength of the effect of the technology information obtained during idea 

generation on business performance, this further supports the importance of the customer 

in the development of radical innovations. 

 

Fourth, at the organization level, factors of the firms’ organizational learning 

influence the performance of a radical innovation.  These learning factors relate to how 

the firm manages information obtained from the customer.  This demonstrates that in the 

dynamic environment of radical innovations, information dissemination and 

 

72


organizational memory have a positive effect on the performance of a radical innovation. 

 

Fifth, the post-hoc analysis showed that the relation between organizational 

learning components, technology and market information at each stage of development, 

and the performance of the product is complex and varied.  Thus, neither the information 

alone nor the learning capabilities alone can lead to a successful product.  Rather, it is the 

interaction of the organizational learning components and the customer information at 

various stages that has an effect on the performance. 

 

Sixth, it is the interaction of both product level and strategic level factors that 

contribute to the performance of radical innovations.  The organizational learning of the 

firm is a significant contributor to whether information will be obtained, and if it is 

obtained, how it will be used.  Thus, the benefit of obtaining information from the 

customer is partially dependent upon the strategy of the firm. 

 

2.7.3  Managerial Implications 

This research describes the role of the customer in the development of radical 

innovations from both a substantive and theoretical standpoint.  It enhances managerial 

practice regarding the NPD for radical innovations in four ways.  First, an understanding 

of the use of market and technology information in the development of radical 

innovations allows firms to focus their information acquisition activities on the 

information type or types most likely to lead to a successful new product.  Second, 

customer information is typically obtained and studied in the early stages of the NPD 

process. This research expands our understanding of the potential benefit of customer 

input by studying firms’ utilization of market and technology information obtained from 

 

73


the customer over the entire duration of the NPD process. 

Third, managers have a deeper understanding of the relationship between the 

types of information obtained, the stages when the information is obtained, and their joint 

effect on internal business performance.  Fourth, there is no single best strategy for the 

incorporation of customer information in the development of radical innovations.  Firms 

must have a better understanding of how their organizational learning capabilities impact 

the NPD process, providing insights into “when and how to learn” to increase their 

likelihood of developing a successful radical innovation. 

 

2.7.4 

Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research 

 

2.7.4.1  Limitations 

This study used self-reported measures of business performance (i.e., market 

share and internal performance) as dependent variables. Although the interaction results 

are unlikely to be affected by common method bias, future studies may benefit from the 

use of objective (financial) measures of business performance.  The use of objective 

measures would increase the validity of the research as well as allow the use of 

informants that might not be aware of the external success of the innovation.  The use of 

the subjective internal measure of performance remains important as a means of gauging 

the internal acceptance of the product development and innovation process. 

A potential limitation of the research results from the use of multiple-sample 

frames.  The need to utilize multiple sample frames arose from the difficulty of obtaining 

sufficient respondents from any one frame.  The nature of the research questions required 

a very well informed respondent to the survey, consequently the respondents spanned job 

 

74


functions, specialties, and backgrounds.  The data were evaluated to insure that there was 

not a critical difference in the respondents, but with multiple sample frames it is possible 

that differences between frames occurred for an unmeasured variable.  The use of a single 

sample frame would eliminate this potential limitation. 

The utilization of a single industry simplified many aspects of the research 

method.  Unfortunately it also affects the generalizability of the results.  For instance, 

only one of the six information-stage components was statistically significant.  It is 

possible that in a different, less regulated industry than medical devices the information 

obtained from the customer would have a greater affect on the development of a radical 

innovation.  In addition to the information, firms in other industries may benefit 

differently from their organizational learning. 

 

2.7.4.2 

Future Research 

This research investigated the information obtained from the customer and firm 

level organizational learning from a high-level perspective.  Consequently, it would be 

useful to study the mechanisms involved in soliciting and eliciting information from the 

customers – including NPD processes in other study contexts.  In addition, considering 

the interaction of organizational learning and the customer information levels, it is clear 

that firm-level processes may influence the success or failure of specific projects.  Future 

research is required to understand whether and how rigid internal processes interfere with 

the information components of NPD. 

Several questions arise in relation to customer, information, and organizational 

learning.  How is the information obtained from the customer integrated with the firm’s 

 

75


organizational memory?  Is there a conflict between information acquisition and 

organizational memory?  What is the nature of the customer providing information to the 

firm?  Are the customer’s characteristics that of an advanced, savvy user?

CHAPTER III 

ACQUIRE AND FORGET: THE CONFLICT OF INFORMATION 

ACQUISITION AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN THE DEVELOPMENT 

OF RADICAL INNOVATIONS 

 
 

Abstract 

 

In the new product development process, firms typically recognize the need to 

collect information from the environment and to interpret, distribute, and remember it.  

But what if the firm remembers information for too long?  For example, perhaps they 

should limit their memory and forget some of what they have acquired.  This research 

shows that the process of new product development of radical innovations creates a 

tension within dimensions of firm’s organizational learning.  Utilizing a case study 

methodology, a conflict was found between the acquisition of novel information and the 

organizational memory of the firm.  This conflict indicates that during the development 

of radical innovations care must be taken to balance the need for new information with 

the quality and age of the information resident within the firm’s memory. 

 

 

3.1 

Introduction 

Uncertainty and the drive to reduce that uncertainty (Hart et al. 1999) characterize 

the new product development (NPD) process.  The uncertainty of radical innovation 

development is even greater than that of incremental innovations (Zahay et al. 2004).  

Radical innovations (RIs) are defined as those innovations that are new to the market, 

new to the technology, or some combination of the two (Garcia and Calantone 2002).  

 103


This definition of and the literature on NPD has recognized that the uncertainties 

associated with radical innovations are typically related to the market and technology 

aspects of the product being developed (Cooper 2000; Garcia and Calantone 2002; 

Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994).  These uncertainties lead a firm to ask some of the 

following questions about RIs: is there a market for a product, does the need exist within 

an undeveloped market, and can the firm develop and commercialize the new 

technology?  But should the answers to these questions come from newly acquired 

information or the organization’s memory? 

The ability of the firm to answer these questions, and act on them is theorized in 

the concept of organizational learning (OL).  OL, the process by which information is 

converted to knowledge for use within the firm, has been specified by Huber (1991) as 

having four constructs (Figure 3-1): actions related to knowledge acquisition, information 

distribution, information interpretation, and OM, that lead to intended or unintended 

benefits to the firm (Huber 1991).  However, because of the inherent uncertainty of 

radical innovations, new product development reveals a potential conflict between the 

drive to acquire new information and the use of organizational memory (OM) or 

remembered information.  OM has been studied with regard to the uncertainty of the 

environment (Dougherty 1992; Leonard-Barton 1992; Moorman and Miner 1997), but 

not specifically with regard to the NPD of radical innovations. 

Information acquisition (IA) and OM are not static functions of OL.  Instead, 

firms must determine what and how much new information to obtain and how far into the 

past they should go to retrieve remembered information.  For example, the music industry 

 104


would not want to retrieve information concerning vinyl albums for record players when 

considering radical innovations related to digitizing music into CDs and MP3s. 

Firms typically recognize that there is a need to collect information and remember 

information.  But what if the firm remembers information for too long (i.e. beyond its 

usable life in the product’s market)?  Perhaps, they should limit their memory and 

“forget” some information.  Our research shows that the new product development of 

radical innovations creates a conflict within dimensions of the OL of the firm.  For 

example, in a highly uncertain environment for both the product market and technology, 

a firm must both seek information about their environment and ignore existing 

information in their OM. 

 

 

3.2.1  Uncertainty 

3.2 

Literature Review 

Uncertainty represents the difference between the information a firm needs and 

that which it already possesses  (Galbraith 1973).  The reduced set of uncertainties 

present in the new product development process have been identified by Zahay et al. 

(2004): strategic, financial, project management, customer, needs, technical, competitor, 

and regulatory.  Each of these information types represents a potential uncertainty to the 

firm. 

Market information and technology information emerge as two broad categories 

from these eight information types.  For RIs, the gap between what a firm knows about 

the market and technology, and what they do not know may be quite large and variable 

 105


over the course of the NPD process.  For instance, the market conditions and state of the 

technology may change over time.  Because the success of a new product results from the 

overlap of a market opportunity and a technological innovation, the uncertainty of the 

market and technology are critical factors in the NPD process (Souder and Moenaert 

1992; Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 2001). 

The impact of these uncertainties on the performance of the innovation is 

significant.  An innovation, such as the Segway scooter, developed without resolving the 

firm’s market uncertainties may not have a market or may miss the market that would be 

interested in the innovation.  An innovation developed without addressing the technology 

may enter the market with a substandard, underperforming, or overly complicated and 

unappreciated capability.  The ability of the firm to find the optimal balance of 

technology and market information results from the firm’s uncertainty reduction 

capabilities in the new product development process. 

 

3.2.2  New Product Development Process 

The development of a product is typically a multi-step process that involves 

moving from the development of an idea to the ultimate commercialization of a product 

(Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Urban and Hauser 1993).  The complexity of the process 

varies with the complexity of the desired product, type of innovation, and the amount of 

uncertainty reduction over the course of the NPD project (Hart et al. 1999).  For instance, 

an incremental innovation to add a feature to a product already on the market may be 

simple and not require the full NPD process (Zahay et al. 2004), but a radical innovation 

normally requires the full development process with its attended complexity 

 106


The NPD process has been presented by Crawford and Di Benedetto (2000) as a 

process which consists of five steps: 1) Opportunity identification and selection, 2) 

Concept Generation, 3) Concept/Project Evaluation, 4) Development, and 5) Launch.  

This basic model agrees closely with models presented by Song and Montoya-Weiss 

(1998), Urban and Hauser (1993), and Johnne and Snelson (1988), while Cooper and 

Kleinschmidt (1986) provide more detailed individual NPD activities.  For each stage of 

the NPD process, the uncertainties and information needs of the firm will vary.   

After a design emerges and is commercialized, a different set of uncertainties 

remain.  Most likely, the actual product will be a result of compromises and design trade-

offs (Urban and Hauser 1993).  Even with direct customer input, it is still possible that 

the resulting product will not meet the customer’s technology and market expectations.  

A classic example of this is the Edsel (the dubious automobile produced from 1958-

1960), designed with all the features customers desired, but yielding a final product too 

ugly to behold (Mello 2003).  The launch phase provides the ultimate opportunity for 

customer feedback, the purchase decision.  Throughout the entire NPD process, the 

reduction in uncertainties from IA and OM may provide information relevant to the 

eventual business performance of a new product. 

 

3.2.3  Radical Innovations 

Radical innovations are “based on a different set of engineering and scientific 

principles and often open up whole new markets and potential applications” (Henderson 

and Clark 1990).  This definition of radical innovations may be broken down into two 

distinct parts related to the “newness” of the technology and the “newness” of the market 

 107


(Booz 1982).  As Table 3-1 shows, different levels of technology and market newness 

describe different types of radical innovations.  These levels of radical innovations will 

require different levels of uncertainty reduction and potentially lead to varying levels of 

conflict between the firm’s IA and OM. 

 

3.2.3.1  New to the World (NTW):  New Technology in a New Market 

New to the world innovations are the most radical innovations because of their 

uncertainties related to both the market and technology dimensions, and they are also the 

riskiest of innovations  to develop (Danneels and Kleinschmidt 2001).  An inherent 

difficulty with new to the world radical innovations is that consumer, technological, and 

competitive uncertainties exist in abundance (Souder and Moenaert 1992) and the method 

of relieving these uncertainties is unclear.  For example, TransPharma Medical’s 

ViaDerm system is a new to the world innovation that provides a new method of drug 

delivery by creating “micro-channels” through the outer layer of a patient’s skin to allow 

for the delivery of a wide array of pharmaceutical compounds (TransPharma 2004).  

From a market uncertainty perspective TransPharma’s OM may have indicated that a 

market did not exist, so TransPharma had to determine if a market existed or could be 

developed for this non-traditional drug delivery system.  From a technical perspective 

their OM could not provide information on this new technology, thus, TransPharma was 

required to develop a novel technology and demonstrate the efficacy of the system. 

 

 108


3.2.3.2  New to the Industry (NTI): Old Technology in a New Market 

A new to the industry radical innovation results when an innovation moves from 

one industry to a new industry (Booz 1982).  Innovations classified as new to the industry 

possess technological capabilities that the target industry has either not seen before or has 

not considered as a solution to a problem within their industry.   

As an example of a new to the industry innovation, the race to map the human 

genome lead to an innovation that solved a new problem using old technology.  The ink 

jet printer found in many homes and offices uses a technology to accurately release small 

dots of ink to form letters or images on a piece of paper.  Using this same “inkjet” 

technology, Agilent’s inkjet DNA arrayer accurately places small dots of genetic material 

on a special glass slide (Agilent 2003).  The transfer of ink jet technology from the 

consumer electronics market to DNA arraying in laboratory automation represents the 

use of an existing technology in ways not envisioned within the new market.  The 

uncertainties faced by Agilent included whether the laboratory automation market would 

accept the innovation, and whether a system designed to apply ink could apply genetic 

material.  Agilent’s OM was not able to answer those questions, leading to the need to 

acquire new information. 

Other examples of technologies moving from one industry to another include anti-

lock brakes that were initially developed for use on jet aircraft (Tsiotras and Canudas de 

Wit 2000), and laser technology found in laser pointers and grocery store scanners that 

was initially developed for military defense applications.  For a firm entering a new 

market, they may face uncertainties related to the market, but with fewer uncertainties 

related to the technology. 

 109


3.2.3.3  New to the Firm (NTF): New Technology in an Existing Market 

Innovations that are new to the firm result from the development of a new 

technology for use in an old or existing market.  In most cases, this level of radical 

innovation requires fulfilling the technical uncertainties of the firm while developing an 

innovation for a known market. 

For example, catheter techniques have evolved from manually controlled systems 

developed in the early 1980’s to a new level of computer controlled magnetically 

navigable system, the Niobe System (Stereotaxis 2004).  In this case, the interventional 

medical market is clearly established, but, the use of computers, x-rays, and large 

magnets to control a catheter is clearly unique and applied in a novel manner.  For this 

level of innovation, the firm should have some OM that is applicable, with the balance of 

the uncertainty resolved with the IA process. 

 

3.2.4  Organizational Learning 

Without a firm’s ability to learn during the NPD process, it is unlikely that 

successful new products could be developed.  OL is the “means by which knowledge is 

preserved so that it can be used by individuals other than its progenitor” (Sinkula 1994).  

Studies have shown that there is a significant relation between OL and market 

orientation, with OL being a requirement for a market oriented firm to succeed (Slater 

and Narver 1994) with their new product’s performance (Baker and Sinkula 1999).  A 

critical antecedent to the ability of the firm to overcome their internal uncertainties is the 

firms ability to learn (Hurley and Hult 1998). 

 110


Within the NPD literature, there is a dichotomy of views regarding the benefit of 

customer obtained information (Christensen and Bower 1996; von Hippel 1986).  

According to some researchers, the information acquired from the customer is 

problematic: if so, then the information utilized in NPD may be drawn from the firm’s 

OM.  This dichotomy of views leads to the direct conflict of two OL constructs and the 

tension between the storage of information, OM, and the acquisition of information.  

While information dissemination and information interpretation serve an obvious purpose 

in the development of new products, IA and OM are intimately tied to how a firm 

acquires and stores information. 

 

3.2.4.1 

Information Acquisition 

 

Firms may obtain information from a number of sources including, customers, 

competitors, and market assessments.  In addition, many of the sources of information 

may be tacit rather than explicit, for instance informal interactions with customers or 

competitors(Mascitelli 2000).  These tacit IA processes may be a firm’s most valuable 

because of their irreproducibility. 

 

Research on incremental innovations has shown an increased drive to acquire 

information with the increasing uncertainty of the environment.  We expect an even 

higher level of need for IA with RIs. 

 

Proposition 1:  Firms developing radical innovations will seek increased levels of 
information in highly uncertain environments. 
 

 111


3.2.4.2  Organizational Memory 

OM relates to the long-term retention of information (Huber 1991).  This has been 

presented in the literature as a firm’s absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990), or 

ability to retain knowledge, and may result in empathic design, the ability of a firm to 

design products for a market utilizing only internal information, with no direct input from 

the customer (Leonard-Barton 1995). 

Because OM consists of information obtained in the past, it may not result in the 

same relation to uncertainty as current information.  For highly uncertain environments, 

at first glance, a firm’s memory may appear beneficial, and this is certainly true of 

incremental innovations that evolve over time.  However, for radical innovations, a long 

OM may hinder the development of radical innovations because the age of the “average” 

memory may include the era of incremental innovations such as Christensen and Bower 

(1996) found.   

 

Proposition 2:  The length of an organizations memory will be shorter for firms 
developing radical innovations. 
 
 
The underlying assumption in OL is that increased levels of each component of 

OL results in firm benefits.  Because of the potential conflict of IA and OM in 

development of radical innovations, this underlying assumption in OL may not hold for 

reducing uncertainty. 

In addition, in uncertain environments the OM may be out of date and 

inappropriate for use in the current market or technology environment, consider the rapid 

change of the computer market or consumer electronics.  This leads to a tension between 

 112


the need for new learning and unlearning inappropriate past knowledge.  For example, in 

an environment with low uncertainty, the firm will need to acquire lower amounts of 

market and technology information, and their memory will remain current and beneficial.  

In a very uncertain environment however, firms will seek to relieve uncertainties with 

high levels of IA, and the knowledge stored in their memory will be less useful.  An 

example of this is seen in the development of the many examples of flat screen LCD and 

Plasma televisions.  Firms manufacturing the classic cathode ray tube (CRT) type of 

television may have relied upon their outdated technical and market knowledge, leading 

them to continue making incremental improvements in their CRT technology, while the 

market environment has been driven to the radical innovations of the LCD and Plasma 

technologies. 

 

Proposition 3:  Firms developing radical innovations experience a tension 
between the information acquisition and organizational memory functions of OL. 
 
 

3.3  Method 

 

3.3.1 

Study Context 

The population for this research is firms that had developed radical medical 

device innovations.  The medical device industry, the context for this study, was selected 

for two primary reasons.  First, from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems to 

artificial hearts, this $74 billion industry has historically produced a significant number of 

radical innovations that have revolutionized segments of the industry.  Second, the 

federal government has recognized deficiencies in the medical devices industry, and has 

 113


identified the NPD process as a significant opportunity to rectify the industry’s deficits 

(FDA 2004).  An extension of this point has been highlighted in the drive for more 

translational research, which brings innovations from the bench to the bedside.   

While previous work has evaluated the new product development process across a 

number of industries, as Rochford and Rudelius (1997) suggest, collecting data across 

industries may mask trends that would otherwise be revealed from a single industry 

analysis.  The exploratory nature of this research justifies the potential reduction in 

generalizability that results from using a single industry  

 

3.3.2 

Sampling 

Two sample frames were utilized.  The first sample frame was based upon the 

winners of the Medical Design Excellence Award (MDEA) (Cannon Communications 

2005).  MDEA winning products are based upon a new or novel design that generated 

more than an incremental improvement in performance or treatment.  The award winning 

products are evaluated by a multidisciplinary group of judges that include a mix of 

medical practitioners, engineers, and design professionals.  The 2004 medical device 

award winners were selected and were contacted by electronic mail.  Of ten firms 

contacted, two telephone interviews were conducted and they are reported in the results. 

Due to the low number of contacts of MDEA award winners, one of the award 

judges was contacted.  Through this physician’s participation with the Association for the 

Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) (AAMI 2005), other AAMI members 

were contacted.  The AAMI members consist of firms that are developing medical device 

innovations that are considered radical within the industry.  Of the ten AAMI members 

 114


emailed five agreed to participate in the study, and because they are representative of the 

total sample, two are reported in the results.  The names of interviewees, firms, and 

products have been disguised for confidentiality.   

The inclusion criteria utilized with the sample included the firm’s status as a 

medical devices manufacturer, the interviewee’s ability to address the NDP process, and 

the ability to discuss the firm’s OL. 

 

3.3.3 

Instrument 

A guided interview method was utilized (Yin 1994).  The interview questions 

were formed by scales taken from prior research, for instance, product performance 

(Song and Parry 1997a; Song and Parry 1997b), OM constructs (Moorman 1995; 

Moorman and Miner 1997) , and market (Moorman 1995) and technology turbulence 

(Moorman and Miner 1997).  The intent of the organizational learning scales was to 

assess organization level characteristics; however, the nature of the interviews did not 

explicitly distinguish between project and organizational learning characteristics. 

 

3.3.4  Validity and Reliability 

The use of a semi-structured interview instrument and open-ended questions 

imposed a measure of rigidity to the interviews.  The high degree of experience of the 

interviewees suggests that their experience would lead to stable assessments of a given 

project.  This experience will also affect the validity of the results, with their answers 

becoming more stable with greater experience. 

 

 115


3.3.5  Design 

A case study methodology was utilized (Yin 1994) because the complexity of this 

problem resides in the interaction of the IA and OM under the levels of uncertainty of 

these innovations.  This complexity arises from the dissonance of the acquisition and 

memory behaviors as well as the social desirability associated with obtaining information 

during the NPD process. 

 

3.3.6 

Procedure 

The qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews of individuals 

involved in the new product development of radical medical device innovations.  All 

interviews were conducted by telephone by the lead author.  Each interview lasted from 

30 - 90 minutes.  After all of the interviews had been conducted, the interview notes were 

evaluated for common themes relating NPD and OL.  Following Eisenhardt (1989), 

contrasting cases were utilized to illuminate issues for further study. 

Individuals were asked to identify a single recent radical new product 

development project, and they were then questioned about the development of that 

product and the related new product performance.   

 

 

3.4 

Results 

The OL processes and conflicts were studied in four firms: 1) AlphaCorp, 

information acquisition, 2) BetaCorp, information acquisition deficit, 3) Gamma Medical, 

 116


organizational memory, and 4) Delta, the conflict of information acquisition and 

organizational memory. 

 

3.4.1  AlphaCorp – Information Acquisition: 

AlphaCorp is a developer and manufacturer of a medical device utilized in the 

delivery of fluids and medication to patients.  This product requires the interaction of 

physicians, nurses, technicians, and patients.  Because so many individuals interact with 

this type of product, AlphaCorp recognized the high switching costs associated with the 

device.  They recognized that in order to develop their new product to overtake the 

incumbent firm’s dominant design, they would have to do something different.  What that 

different action was, they didn’t know.  At this point, AlphaCorp realized that they could 

not rely upon their memory of the market; they recognized that they needed new 

information in order to develop a superior product. 

To acquire the information, AlphaCorp gathered 400 physicians and nurses to 

provide input.  During the course of this IA, AlphaCorp found that not one of the 400 had 

been asked by their current device supplier for input.  When asked if there were problems 

with the systems they used, there was no response from the physicians and nurses.  When 

asked if they received certain troublesome and erroneous automated warnings from the 

competitive system, the majority had, and they could not understand why the interviewer 

was asking questions with such obvious answers.  At this point AlphaCorp realized that 

even with obvious information to provide, this group had never been used as a source of 

information for evaluating their current needs and complaints. 

 117


Physicians and nurses had to be trained to provide feedback on the features and 

processes associated with the product.  In this case, IA was paramount for the firm.  They 

had identified an opportunity to harvest information from the physicians and nurses that 

the informers didn’t even realize that they could provide.  These informers did not realize 

that the problems and quirks of their current systems did not have to exist in all similar 

systems.  In support of proposition one, AlphaCorp recognized an internal need for 

information and in the process of acquiring that information, found an opportunity 

neglected by other manufacturers. 

 

3.4.2  BetaCorp – Information Acquisition Deficit: 

During the period of 1995-1997, a medical device was developed by BetaCorp.  

The product was an implanted device that could be remotely programmed, adjusted, and 

analyzed, thus allowing increased freedom and convenience for both the physician and 

the patient.  During the NPD process there was limited analysis or market development 

performed.  Instead, the product development was driven by the technology of the new 

product, without any attention given to the market or market related factors. 

Eventually, product development concluded and the device went through clinical 

trials.  As a result of the clinical trials, the superior performance and efficacy of the 

product was demonstrated.  The product was subsequently released. 

There was however, a problem with the market.  At the time of release, a billing 

code by insurers and healthcare providers had not been generated.  Without a billing 

code, physicians, hospitals, and insurers are unable to submit their claims for 

reimbursement.  If a medical device will not be paid for or reimbursed by insurers, 

 118


physicians would be unwilling to utilize these devices.  This lack of appropriate market 

research lead the firm to retract the product from the market.  Ten years later, with 

refinements in both technical and market dimensions, the product is again in the release 

process. 

Because the nature of the market in medical devices includes insurance and other 

regulatory parties, the market information required by the firm can be extensive and 

complex.  BetaCorp acquired the technical information necessary to develop a successful 

new product, but their lack of market information, specifically the billing codes, hobbled 

the product from the beginning.  The experience of BetaCorp supports proposition one.  

Their low levels of IA in an uncertain environment lead to the withdrawal of their 

launched product. 

 

3.4.3  Gamma Medical – Organizational Memory 

Gamma Medical has developed products utilized in the treatment of neurological 

and cardiovascular disorders.  For instance, they have developed an implantable device 

that monitors internal characteristics of a patient which warns the patient if abnormal 

conditions arise.  The development of these devices has provided Gamma a body of 

knowledge related to the NPD process of medical devices.  Gamma Medical has been 

able to utilize their OM in a productive manner while avoiding a potential trap of being 

tied to the past. 

 

For Gamma Medical, their history of successful innovations and OM processes 

have resulted in the codification of certain memories into a set of “rules” used during the 

NPD process that they consider predictors of the success of the new product.  They have 

 119


divided their memories into those that are procedural and descriptive of success factors 

and those that are innovation specific.  The division of these memories is significant to 

the success of the firm. 

 

Gamma’s guidelines address factors such as how easy the device is to use, the 

efficacy of the device, and ability to have the device paid for by insurance.  These 

guidelines are used in a more strategic capacity than individual product development 

decisions.  Consider the development of their implantable device, Gamma must conform 

to the state of surgical practice for implantation, and that practice has changed with time.  

In contrast to Gamma’s guidelines, a competitive firm developed a method of bypass 

surgery without the use of a thoracotomy (surgical incision in the chest wall).  The 

procedure was performed through multiple small incisions in the chest, reduced the risk 

to the patient, and significantly reduced the recovery time.  Despite the procedure’s 

benefits, the technique required physicians to perform over twenty procedures to learn the 

method and ten procedures per year to remain current.  The investment in time and 

learning was more than physicians were willing to commit.  In contrast, as an alternative 

treatment to bypass surgery, the procedure used for placing a stent inside a  clogged 

artery was the same as that used for angioplasty, so physicians were able to utilize their 

previous skills for the new procedure.  History has shown that the stent, developed by 

following Gamma’s guidelines, has been a successful innovation. 

 

It appears that Gamma’s OM processes contradict proposition 2; however, 

Gamma splits their memories into those converted into their success guidelines and the 

technical aspects required of the NPD process.  Gamma attributes their success in the 

NPD of radical innovations to their ability to jump into new areas and applications and 

 120


obtain the information necessary to solve the current problem.  Gamma has reported that 

they may know nothing of a new area and must learn the information critical to the 

problem to be solved. 

 

For Gamma Medical, their OM processes have benefited the firm through their 

guidelines, but their development of radical innovations has resulted from their short-

term memory and information acquisition of information relevant to their new projects.  

Gamma’s lack of existing knowledge in new projects and approach to acquiring 

information for their new projects support proposition two. 

 

3.4.4  Delta – The Conflict of Information Acquisition and Organizational Memory: 

In the medical device market there are many groups of people that may “use” a 

single product.  Unlike the consumer electronics market, where a single person would use 

an MP3 player, users of medical devices may include physicians, nurses, technicians, and 

patients.  Consider the pacemaker, it is installed by a cardiac surgeon, but subsequent to 

the implantation, the patient and the cardiologist must interface with the device.  Because 

IA and OM are critical components of learning, this creates a potential problem for firms 

wanting to include customer input in the development of their radical innovations.  

Because the quality of the information may vary, not only does the age of memories need 

to be considered, but also where the information originated and from whom new 

information will be acquired. 

 

Bearing this in mind, Delta, a manufacturer of devices transferring 

pharmaceuticals to the patient from the surface their bodies, acquires information from 

physicians prescribing their devices and the patients who use them.  For radical 

 121


innovations, Delta seeks to acquire information from both of these groups.  The 

importance of seeking both groups is seen by the following anecdote:  

“A physician may tell a patient to use a particular device if efficacious 
even if it is hard to use or poorly designed.  By focusing on the 
physician and not on the user, some user needs go unmet…the medical 
needs may be met, but the ancillary needs of the patient are missed.  
Thus, the subtle things that make a product better are missing.  This 
also becomes a problem if the patient input is obtained too far 
downstream in the NPD process.” 
 

Highlighting the problem of OM and IA, Delta manufactures a device the size of 

 

a dime, but they have the technology, i.e. a radical innovation, to make devices that are 

half of that size.  Their OM has fixed on the concept that smaller is better in this market, 

so they believed that they should continue to develop innovations allowing for smaller 

devices.  Despite this drive to make smaller devices, information acquired from the 

market revealed that the products could become too small for customers to manage, 

manipulate, and implement.  In this situation, OM led to setting one direction for the 

product development, while the IA indicated a different direction.  The experience of 

Delta demonstrates the conflict of IA and OM in support of both hypotheses one and two. 

 

 

3.5 

Discussion 

OL is commonly viewed as being beneficial to the firm.  Under general conditions, 

this may be true; however, for the development of radical innovations, this might not be 

the case because aspects of OL may conflict.  OL is represented as a formative construct 

(Jarvis et al. 2003) composed of information acquisition, information dissemination, 

information interpretation, and organizational memory, it is possible that under certain 

 122


circumstances, the sub-components of OL may drive a firm’s behavior in different 

directions.  In the case of radical innovations and the uncertainty associated with them, 

IA levels are high, while longer terms of OM hinder the development of radical 

innovations.   

 

3.5.1 

Firms seek increased levels of information 

For high levels of uncertainty in the environment, firms attempt to relieve their 

uncertainty by acquiring information in proportion to the uncertainty (Souder and 

Moenaert 1992).  Consider AlphaCorp’s successful IA and BetaCorp’s lack of IA.  (See 

Table 3-2.)  Both firms developed products under uncertain conditions, but only 

AlphaCorp sought the information necessary to refine the product for the customer.  

Consequently, Alpha’s product was successful while, according to the project manager, 

Beta’s product was withdrawn from the market.  This result is predicted by the 

information processing and knowledge based views of the firm. 

 

3.5.2  Organizational memory length is shorter for radical innovations  

At a time when the firm is driven to obtain more information, logic dictates that 

remembering old information as well as that which is newly acquired would be 

important.  For the turbulent and uncertain environments in which radical innovations are 

formed, this behavior is counterproductive.  Gamma Medical established a difference 

between the information and guidelines generated from the information.  These product 

development guidelines imposed the traits of successful past projects on those products of 

the future.  A firm with a long memory attempts to integrate old memories into their NPD 

 123


process, those memories that were formed prior to the uncertain and dynamic 

environment.  It is the more recent memories that are required to develop radical 

innovations. 

 

3.5.3 

Tension between information acquisition and organizational memory 

A conflict arises from the organizational memory of the firm.  Delta reflects the 

conflict of IA and OM, but they were able to recover from this conflict prior to releasing 

a product.  This suggests that a comparison must be made between the information 

acquired and the organizational memory.  Figure 3-2 presents a revised OL model that 

includes a comparison of the firm’s level of OM and their IA.  After assessing the 

memory needs of the firm, long for a certain environment versus short for an uncertain 

environment, the feedback loop allows the firm to adjust their IA needs.  So, in a 

turbulent environment conducive to radical innovations, shorter memories limit the 

dilution of newly acquired ideas by older memories. 

 

These results contribute to findings in the literature on the customer involvement 

in disruptive innovations (Christensen and Bower 1996).  Christensen and Bower suggest 

that the customer should not be involved in the NPD of radical innovations because they 

will lead a firm to develop incremental innovations.  They argue that customers are 

unable to understand or conceptualize of radical innovations, and that the “average” 

information from the customer leads to incremental innovations.  This research suggests 

that OM may be a contributing factor to Christensen and Bower’s findings.  Perhaps it is 

the firm relying upon old and irrelevant memories that leads to incremental innovations. 

 124


A June 7th, 2005 Wall Street Journal article, highlighted the situation for firms 

developing radical innovations.  Toselli of Johnson & Johnson stated that “physicians, in 

general, are suspicious of new technology.”  This hesitancy to adopt new technologies 

only serves to increase the market and technology uncertainty for developing firms.  

Given the overall economic variability of the market, the optimal levels of IA and OM for 

these firms developing radical innovations remains enigmatic. 

This research is a preliminary step in the study of the IA and OM of the firm during 

the new product development of radical innovations.  Future research requires further 

refinement of the model, particularly in the area of memory classification and assessment.  

Additionally, future research of this topic should be conducted to demonstrate the 

generalizability of the research problem. 

 

 

3.6 

Implications 

This research reveals significant implications for both the theory and practice of 

organizational learning and new product development.  From a theoretical perspective, 

several factors emerge.  First, organizational learning matters in the development of new 

products.  The firms in this research recognized to varying degrees that the firm must be 

able to learn to develop radical products.   

Second, high levels of organizational learning are generally assumed to have a 

positive affect on a firm.  While firms must learn about their environment, high levels of 

all aspects of organizational learning are not necessarily positive.  As this research has 

 125


shown, factors relating to the environment and the product being developed maydictate 

the effect of the firms information acquisition and organizational memory. 

Third, the degree of innovation of a product will influence the conflict of 

organizational learning conflict.  For the development of incremental innovations, a long 

memory is appropriate for storing the developing preferences of customers and the small 

changes made to products to accommodate those preferences.  However, in the rapidly 

changing environment of radical innovations, old information will negatively effect the 

NPD process. 

From a practical perspective, the learning characteristics of the firm are important 

to develop new products.  In many cases, these organizational learning characteristics 

may be manipulated by managers.  Recognizing that the environment and technology 

may result in a radical innovation, the acquisition of information and the memories of the 

firm may be controlled to increase the probability of success of the product.  

 

Additionally, this research makes clear that there is not an optimum mix of 

acquisition and memory for all products.  The environment, the firm, and the product will 

drive the organizational learning of the firm.

WHO, WHAT, AND WHEN: THE ROLE OF THE CUSTOMER IN THE 

DEVELOPMENT OF RADICAL INNOVATIONS 

 
 
 

Abstract 

Conventional wisdom suggests that the best new product development strategy is 

to be “close to the customer,” while other research suggests that customers hinder the 

development of radical new products.  This paper address three questions: 1) Who do 

firms contact in the development of radical innovations? 2) What information is provided 

by the customer? 3) When during the process does the firm obtain technology and market 

information from the customer?  Results from the medical device market (N=152) show 

specific characteristics of the customer, that they provide both technology and market 

information, and that the information varies during the development process.  The level 

of technology information obtained from the customer decreases linearly from the idea 

generation stage, and the level of market information obtained from the customer forms a 

U-shaped curve with the highest levels of information at idea generation and launch with 

a decrease during the development stage.

Introduction 

Radical innovations challenge the preexisting technologies and concepts of a 

market (Garcia and Calantone 2002; Henderson and Clark 1990), so their development 

may differ from that of incremental innovations.  One of the differences in the 

development of radical and incremental innovations may be from whom firms obtain 

133 


information.  Conventional wisdom suggests that the best new product development 

(NPD) strategy results from being close to the customer (Krishnan and Ulrich 2001; 

Urban and Hauser 1993; Urban and von Hippel 1988).  For example, the lead user 

method requires firms to solicit ideas from advanced and innovative users (Franke and 

von Hippel 2003) and, if the “right” users provide ideas to the firm, the result is s 

successful novel product (von Hippel 1998; von Hippel 1986).  An opposing view is that 

current customers may be unable to visualize the potential of a new radical technology 

and/or market.  Hence, firms that get too close to customers may hinder or mislead the 

firm in the successful development of radically new products (Christensen and Bower 

1996).  Before the benefit of customer information may be determined, firms must 

identify who will be utilized to provide information in the development of a radical 

innovation. 

To identify what information the customer can supply, radical innovations must 

be defined  A product can be considered radical for one or both of two reasons (Garcia 

and Calantone 2002; Henderson and Clark 1990).  It may use a radical technology to 

satisfy a current market need, for example, when iPod music players began replacing 

music CDs. Or, there may be an entirely new market opened by the innovation, such as 

when Apple introduced the ability of the iPod to download TV and videos. Thus, these 

two dimensions of radical innovations may be distinguished and (consequently) two 

different types of information that can be supplied by customers during the product 

development process:  technology and market information. 

When should firms seek information from the customer?  While there are a host 

of different models of the NPD process (Booz 1982; Song and Montoya-Weiss 1998), 

 134


Crawford and Di Benedetto’s (2000) model may be condensed into three core stages: 

idea generation, development, and product launch.  Lead user research has only studied 

the impact of such users in the first stage of NPD (von Hippel 2006), this research 

extends von Hipple’s work to investigate when customers provide information in NPD. 

In summary, this research addresses the following research questions: 

1.  Who is the customer that firms contact in the development of radical innovations? 
2.  What types of information are provided by the customer? 
3.  When during the NPD process does the firm obtain technology and market 

information from the customer? 

 

These questions are addressed by developing a model of the information and timing of 

customer information acquisition in the development of radical innovations.  The model 

is tested with survey data obtained from key informants in 152 medical device firms.  

 

 

4.2 

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development 

4.2.1  Who is the Customer? 

 

To delve into the idea of customer information, the first consideration is “who” is 

the customer?  The characteristics of the customer are likely to influence the information 

that they provide to firms’ developing radical innovations.  Characteristics of the 

customer emerge from different streams of research.  These include incremental 

innovations, the lead user methodology, disruptive innovations, and the diffusion of 

innovations. 

 

 135


4.2.1.1 

Incremental Innovations 

 

The utilization of the customer in incremental innovations is well documented 

(Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1986) and provides insight into the possible utilization of the 

customer in radical innovations.  First, in incremental improvements or innovations of a 

product, the customer typically has either direct experience with or knowledge of the 

product to be improved (Abernathy and Utterback 1978), whereas the majority of 

customers may not be able to recognize their need for a radical innovation.  

 

Secondly, for an incremental innovation, there is a market with well-defined 

boundaries from which to solicit customers.  In contrast, a market may not exist during 

the development of a radical innovation (Christensen and Bower 1996), thereby 

increasing the difficulty of obtaining both potential customers and relevant customer 

information.  Two successful radical inventions one hundred years apart, the telephone 

and the Internet, are examples of radical innovations developed without an existing 

market from which to draw customer input.  While the body of evidence supporting the 

role of the customer in the development of incremental innovations implies some benefit 

for including customers in the development of radical innovations (de Brentani 2001), 

this inclusion is far from agreed upon and may relate to who the customer may be. 

 

4.2.1.2  Lead User Research 

 

The lead user method proposed by von Hippel (1986) provides a customer 

intensive method of developing new product ideas.  Lead users “face needs that will be 

general in a marketplace at some subsequent time, and are positioned to benefit 

significantly by obtaining a solution to those needs” (Urban and von Hippel 1988).  

 136


Within the lead user method there are three potential types of lead users, 1) lead users 

from the target industry, 2) lead users from an analogous market that can transfer 

technical information from their market, and 3) lead users familiar with attributes similar 

to those in the target industry (Thomke and Nimgade 1998). 

 

The definition of the lead users and the potential types of lead users suggest that a 

lead user participating in the NPD process is able to provide product ideas and/ or 

solutions to the developing firm.  In contrast to traditional marketing techniques which 

attempt only to assess a customer’s needs, the lead user method may elicit both customer 

needs and product ideas (Lilien et al. 2002).  Consequently, lead users are more advanced 

in their needs and knowledge than average customers. 

 

4.2.1.3  Disruptive Innovations 

In contrast to lead users, Christensen suggests that although customers play a 

positive role in incremental innovations (Christensen 1992a), they play a negative role in 

radical innovations (Christensen 1992b).  Christensen contrasts disruptive innovations, 

defined as “those innovations that disrupted or redefined the performance trajectory, with 

sustaining innovations, defined as “those innovations that sustained or reinforced 

established trajectories of product performance” (Christensen and Bower 1996).”  These 

terms parallel the distinctions between radical and incremental innovations.   

Christensen proposed that a firm’s current customers lead the firm to develop 

incremental innovations.  This results from a desire by the firm to keep their customers 

satisfied and attend to the firm’s current source of business.  This attention to the current 

customer results in not only a disproportionate amount “mind-share” at the firm but also 

 137


in the allocation of resources in the development of incremental innovations to the 

exclusion of radical innovations.  Alternatively, new entrants to the market develop the 

disruptive innovations that redefine the current technology’s performance curve. 

 

Christensen’s research provides a potential answer to the question of how strong, 

sophisticated firms could fall prey to these new entrants.  Utilizing a resource allocation 

model, Christensen found that the incumbent firms were in many cases developing 

similar products to those launched by the new entrants, but the resources put toward these 

products were often reallocated to the incremental projects because of the perception of 

an immediate need by the customer.  Thus, Christensen suggests that input from current 

customers with their average needs results in incremental innovations, while radical 

innovations result from new entrants to the market that may not rely on customer input.  

Christensen’s work (1992a; 1992b; 1996) does not explicitly define the user, but instead 

suggests that current customers tend to express requirements consistent with their current 

needs. 

 

4.2.1.4  Diffusion of Innovations – Technology Adoption 

Rogers’ (1995) study in the diffusion of innovation has yielded a technology 

adoption curve (Figure 4-1) based upon the cumulative number of technology adoptions 

of an innovation.  The curve segments the adopters of an innovation into five different 

categories: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards.  This 

schema has been used to explain the diffusion of many different technologies and by 

Moore (1991) to address the difficulty of an innovation to cross the “chasm” between the 

early adopters and the majority.  This curve has been used in the literature to describe the 

 138


adopters of a particular innovation, and classify a customer by when they adopt an 

innovation.   

Thomke and Nimgade (1998) place lead users in the innovator category, clearly 

ahead of the early adopters, because of their need for products and services that do not 

yet exist in the market.  In contrast, the issues identified in the disruptive innovation 

research involve an incumbent firm’s reliance upon the “average” user.  Consequently, 

the average user may exist in the middle of the technology adoption curve, between the 

early and late majority.  Considering a single product, it is reasonable to conclude that the 

customers adopting an innovation at the halfway point of the products lifecycle will not 

be the forward thinking, innovative, risk-taking type of customers.  Therefore, if a firm 

developing a new product solicits information from this “average” user, as Christensen 

states, an incremental product will most likely result. 

Not only does a customer’s position on the technology adoption lifecycle 

influence the role of the customer in NPD, but in addition, it may influence the type of 

information contributed to the new product development process.  A benefit of the lead 

user method over typical marketing practices noted in the literature is the ability of the 

lead user method to generate both user needs and product solutions to meet those needs, 

thus implying some measure of both market and technical information.  In contrast, 

typical marketing techniques may result in the identification of user needs, but as 

Christensen and Bower (1996) identifies the average user contributes information leading 

to incremental innovations. 

It follows then that the customers best suited to the development of radical 

innovations would be the most innovative and forward thinking.  Utilizing Rogers’ 

 139


(1995) technology adoption categories, customers that would be the most beneficial to 

the NPD process may be the innovators and early adopters.   

 

4.2.1.5  Hypothesis 1 

 

The development of radical innovations requires specialized information.  The 

need for this specialized information results from the firm developing either a new 

technology or a new market.  Consequently, information on the new technology and 

market may not be obtained from an average user or customer.  The inability of the 

average user to generate the information the firm requires, leads the firm to seek that 

information from more advanced users or customers. 

H1: During the development of radical innovations, firms seek information from 
advanced customers. 
 
 
4.2.2  What information is provided? 

An inherent difficulty with radical innovations both new to the technology and 

new to the market is that consumer, technological, and competitive uncertainties (Souder 

and Moenaert 1992) exist in abundance.  If the customer cannot understand the 

innovation, they may only provide general market information, with little information 

regarding the application of a specific technology. Eliciting beneficial information from 

the customer is one of many challenges facing firms developing radical innovations, but 

what information should firms seek to obtain from customers? 

 

For the development of a radical innovation firms face several sources of uncertainty.  

Among these uncertainties, technology and market uncertainties are paramount in NPD.  

Firms seeking information from their customers in the development of radical innovations 

 140


should seek technology and market information. 

H2a: Firms will obtain technology information from customers during the development 
of radical innovations. 

 

H2b: Firms will obtain market information from customers during the development of 
radical innovations. 
 
 
4.2.3  When is the information provided? 

This research addresses a specific aspect of the NPD process, the acquisition of 

customer information.  As stated earlier, the NPD process may be distilled into three key 

sets of activities: 1) Idea Generation, 2) Development, and 3) Product Launch.  The idea 

generation stage requires the evaluation of a firm’s marketplace or potential marketplace 

to determine a possible unmet need.  The development stage represents the transition 

from ideas into designs.  During the launch stage, products are taken from the design 

drawings and are molded into physical products that can be manufactured and sold. These 

stages suggest discrete steps within a firm, but they often overlap to accelerate the NPD 

process (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995).  We predict that, because the information needs of 

the firm vary across the stages of NPD, the extent of information obtained from the 

customer is likely to vary across the stages of the NPD process, with the importance and 

relevance of the customer’s information changing with each stage. 

H3a: The level of technology information obtained from the customer in the development 
of a radical innovation will vary by the stage of the NPD process (idea generation, 
development, and product launch) in which such information is obtained. 

 

H3b: The level of market information obtained from the customer in the development of 
a radical innovation will vary by the stage of the NPD process (idea generation, 
development, and product launch) in which such information is obtained.

4.3  METHOD 

 

4.3.1 

Study Context 

Three factors make the medical device industry an ideal context for the study of 

the role of the customer in the development of radical innovations.  First, from cardiac 

stents to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital X-rays, the $74 billion (FDA 

2004) medical device industry has historically produced numerous innovations that have 

revolutionized segments of the industry.  Second, the federal government has investigated 

deficiencies in the medical devices industry and has identified the NPD process as an 

opportunity to rectify some of the industry’s deficits (FDA 2004).  Third, from a 

managerial and public policy standpoint, there is a substantial benefit from a study of the 

medical devices industry.  Firms may be spending time working with customers when 

there is no need, or they may be avoiding customers when the firms should utilize 

customer input for new health care treatments and devices.  Thus, resolving the role of 

the customer in NPD may help firms, the industry and the patient population. 

 

4.3.2 

Sampling Procedure 

To generate a representative sample of the medical device industry in the United 

States, three sample frames were utilized:  the FDA Medical Device Database (FDA 

2006),  members of InHealth: The Institute for Health Technology Studies (IHTS), and 

subscribers of the Medical Device & Device Industry trade publication.  The sample 

frames were merged and duplicates eliminated to insure only one contact per firm, 

thereby eliminating the possibility of multiple respondents from the same firm.  Then, the 

 142


merged list was trimmed – using the screening procedures described below -- so that it 

included only firms that might have developed radical innovations.  In addition, survey 

respondents were instructed to identify a radical product they had developed and 

complete the survey with regard to that product.   

Federal law requires the registration of medical devices with the FDA Medical 

Device Database.  The database was screened to obtain active Class II and Class III 

devices (which are typically the most sophisticated) released to the market within the 

prior five years.  This screening process yielded 1018 potential firms, of which 757 firms 

(74%) were randomly sampled.  Of the 757 firms contacted by telephone, 170 agreed to 

accept an email with a description of the study and a link to the online survey.  85 

surveys were completed, yielding an 11.2% response rate. 

The second sample frame consisted of members of InHealth: The Institute for 

Health Technology Studies (InHealth 2006), an organization tasked with promoting the 

development of medical devices.  256 CEOs and other corporate officers associated with 

the IHTS were emailed a request to participate.  27 surveys were completed yielding a 

10.5% response rate. 

The third sample frame consisted of a screened email list from the Medical 

Device & Device Industry trade publication.  This list was screened for finished medical 

device manufacturers, rather than component manufacturers, in the United States, but did 

not allow for the pre-selection of radical innovations.  From this sample frame 4100 

emails were sent, resulting in 58 survey responses.  Researchers have estimated that 10% 

of new products may be classified as radical (de Brentani 2001; Kamel et al. 2003; 

Kleinschmidt and Cooper 1991).  Hence, the effective sample size from the third sample 

 143


frame is approximately (4100 x 10%) 410 firms with 58 responses yielding a response 

rate of 14.1%.   

Combining the responses from the sample frames yields (85 + 27 + 58 =) 170 

observations.  The responses were tested for differences among samples using analysis of 

variance.  The coefficients of the indicator variables were not significantly different from 

zero (p < 0.05).   

 

4.3.3 

Innovation Characteristics 

The unit of analysis for this research is the individual innovation.  The FDA 

system, which classifies products by sophistication and impact on the patient, acts as a 

proxy for innovativeness.  Of the products described by respondents 14% were Class I 

(least regulated), 55% were Class II, 19% were Class III (most regulated), and 11% were 

not classified.  The innovations that the respondents utilized in their responses possessed 

technology newness of 4.8 out of 7 (7 being newest) and market newness of 4.7 out of 7 

(7 representing most innovative devices).  Of those innovations, the majority were 

classified as Class II medical devices (Figure 4-4).  The mean length of time on the 

market for the innovations was 2.75 years (Figure 4-3) and the mean length of time in 

development was from 2 to 3 years (Figure 4-2).  The median selling price of the devices 

was less than $1000 (Figure 4-5) 

 

4.3.4 

Firm Characteristics 

The firms responding to the survey represented a broad spectrum of medical 

device manufacturers.  Questions regarding the firm characteristics were presented to 

 144


allow for a response related to the firm or business unit.  This allows for a small division 

of a large corporation to provide meaningful data rather than providing a number for the 

total number of employees employed by the corporation.  Consequently, the majority of 

the sample firms had less than 20 employees (Figure 4-6).  In addition to the number of 

employees, the experience of the firm in the medical device market is important to 

capture.  As Figure 4-7 shows, more than 60% of the responding firms had from 5 years 

of experience in medical devices to greater than 20 years of experience.  The sales 

revenue for the respondents firms is moderately equally distributed across the range of 

values (Figure 4-8).  These demographic statistics for the respondent firms suggest that 

the sample may be representative of the medical device market. 

 

4.3.5  Key Informants Characteristics 

Informants were required to have knowledge of the new product development of a 

single radical innovation, the type and amount of information that customers’ provided, 

and the ability to describe characteristics of the customers consulted for the product 

development.  Because informant eligibility was based on these requirements, their 

characteristics and job titles varied.  For the total sample, the median level of NPD 

experience for the respondents was from 10 to 20 years and the median level of sales for 

the responding firms was from $1 million to $5 million.  The size of the firm dictated 

what functions where relevant to a particular job title.  The functional areas of the sample 

(see Table 4--1) consisted of 19.0% in R&D, 16.8% in management (VP and CEO level), 

15.1% in regulatory affairs, 13.4% in marketing, 12.3% in engineering, 3.9% in sales, 

and 1.7% in manufacturing. 

 145


4.3.6  Questionnaire Design and Construct Measurement 

Measures of all constructs, except for the customer information levels and NPD 

stages, were drawn from prior research (Table 4-2).  Pretest and pilot testing of the 

survey was utilized to confirm the validity of the constructs in the medical device market.  

All scales used a 7 point Likert-type scale (1=low and 7=high).  Some items were reverse 

coded to evaluate respondent reliability. Because some innovations may be more radical 

than others, technology newness was measured using a six item scale employed by 

Gatignon and Xuereb (1997) which assessed the newness of the technology to the market 

and competitive environment.  Market newness was measured with a five item scale 

developed by Danneels and Kleinschmidt (2001) that assessed the creation of a new 

market as well as whether the firm entered a new market.  Key features of the measures, 

the sources of the scales, and descriptive statistics are described below.   

 

4.3.7  Measures 

 
4.3.7.1  Customer Input. 

The nature and amount of market and technical information obtained from the 

customer was assessed for each stage of the NDP process and for the total process.  For 

measurement purposes, “market information” was defined as information related to 

market size, market growth, competitor information, and other market-type information, 

and “technical information” was defined as information on technology content, technical 

needs, technology uniqueness, and technical trends.  Respondents were asked how much 

market and technology information the firm obtained from the customer during each 

phase of the NPD process.  

 146


4.3.7.2  Customer Characteristics 

The characteristics of the customer informant are critical in determining whether 

an advanced or sophisticated user is providing information in the development of the 

radical innovation.  We utilize a seven item scale implemented in Morrison et al. (2000) 

and Franke and Shah (2003) to assess how innovative the firm judged their customer 

informants.  The scale items for the customer characteristics are presented in Table 4-4.  

The items incorporated in the scale assess: 

1.  Early awareness of products or solutions 
2.  Benefit from early adoption of new products 
3.  If they have tested products for other manufacturers 
4.  Are they regarded as “cutting edge” in their fields 
5.  Have they improved and developed new techniques in their fields 
6.  Did they have needs that were not satisfied by existing products 
7.  Are they  dissatisfied with the existing equipment in the market 

 

To maintain the consistency of our survey instrument, a scale of 1=low and 

7=high was used; rather than the 1=high and 7=low in the original scale.  These items 

classify the advanced customer, their cutting edge recognition of needs, and their 

attempts to solve their needs.   

 

4.3.7.3  Covariates 

Guided by the literature, control variables were collected from each respondent 

(Atuahene-Gima 2005; Baker and Sinkula 1999).  These covariates included the 

functional area and tenure of the respondent, the revenue generated by the product, total 

revenue of the developing firm or business unit, number of employees, number of years 

the firm was in the market, and the list price of the product. 

 147


4.3.7.4  Construct Validity 

The validity of the constructs was assessed following Churchill (1979) and 

Podsakoff et al. (2003).  Table 4-3 presents the correlation of scales, and the within-item 

correlation is reported on the diagonal.  All of the multi-item measures met the suggested 

.70 level for Cronbach’s alpha, and the within-construct item correlations are 

substantially higher than the between-construct item correlations. 

 

4.3.7.5  Descriptive Statistics 

The correlation matrix and descriptive statistics of the data are reported in Table 

4-3.  The data did not exhibit skewness or kurtosis and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for 

normality found the data to be normally distributed at p<.05.  In addition, the data were 

visually inspected to confirm the normality tests.   

 

 

4.4 

Analysis and Results 

4.4.1  Who? - Customer characteristics 

On a Likert scale of one to seven, with 1=low and 7=high, the mean and standard 

deviation for the customer characteristics scale are 5.3 and 1.1.  The customer 

characteristics scale reliability is .86.  Two statistical tests were performed on the scale 

developed from the item data for the customer characteristics.  The first test was to 

determine if the customer characteristics were significantly different from zero and the 

second test was to determine if the characteristics were significantly different from the 

innovator category of customers reported by Franke and Shah (2003). 

 148


To determine if the customer characteristics were statistically different from the 

neutral point, a one-sample T test was used.  The item scales were balanced 7-point 

Likert scales anchored by “Not very accurate (1)” and “Very accurate (7)” as the end-

points and “Neutral” as the midpoint.  The mean value for the Customer Characteristic 

scale is 5.26 with a standard deviation of .86.  The customer characteristic scale is 

statistically different from “Neutral” (t=14.9, p<.001).  See Table 4-5. 

The second one-sample T-test was conducted to determine if the customer 

characteristic scale was different from the results obtained by Franke and Shah (2003).  

They found the mean value for the innovators category to be 4.1 out of 7.  Therefore, 

using a one-sample t-test the customer characteristics of this study were compared to the 

value of 4.1.  This test indicated a statistically significant difference from 4.1 (t=13.7, 

p<.001).  (See Table 4-6.)  The significance of the T-tests indicate support for H1. 

 

4.4.2  What? – Information Types 

A review of the descriptive statistics reveal both technology information and 

market information are obtained from the customer by firms developing radical 

innovations.  Obtaining technology information from the customer supports H2a, while 

obtaining market information supports H2b.   

To test for the differences in information types, three paired samples T-tests were 

conducted.  Because the information levels of both technology and market information 

were ascertained for the three stages of the NPD process, the levels of information were 

paired for each stage to examine the possible differences in technology and market 

information.  The pairs were technology and market information obtained during idea 

 149


generation, the technology and market information obtained during development, and the 

technology and market information obtained during product launch.  See Table 4-7.  This 

test reveals that the technology and market information are statistically different for the 

development stage (p<0.10) and the product launch stage (p<.001). 

4.4.3  When? - The Interaction of Information and Stage 

A repeated measures analysis of variance with two within-subjects factors (stage 

and information type) was conducted to test for differences in the level of information by 

information type and by stage of the NPD process.  (See Table 4- 8.)  There was a main 

effect for NPD stage, F(2,324)=3.737, p=.025, but not for information type, 

F(1,324)=3950, p=.331, and there was an interaction between NPD stage and information 

type, F(2,324)=12.733, p<.001.  As shown in Figure 4-17, there is a decreasing linear 

trend for technology information and a positive U-shaped (quadratic) curve for market 

information. 

To further investigate the within-subject interaction of information type and stage, 

a repeated measures analysis of variance with one within-subject factor (stage) was 

performed separately for technology and market information testing for a linear and 

quadratic trend in each.  For technology information (see Table  4-9) there was a main 

effect for stage, F(2,324)=3.551, p=.030.  For technology information there was a linear 

effect by stage, F(2,324)=5.556, p=.020, but not a quadratic effect.  The decreasing linear 

relation of technology information by stage supports H3a.  For market information (see 

Table 4-10) there was quadratic effect of stage, rather than a linear effect of stage.  The 

within-subjects contrasts indicates a positive quadratic relation of market information and 

stage of the NPD process, F(1,162)=24.723, p<.001, and an insignificant linear relation 

 150


of market information and the stage of the NPD process F(1,162)=.024, p=.876.  The 

finding of market information varying by the stage of NPD process supports H3b.  Thus, 

the information obtained from the customer varies by the type of information and when 

the information is obtained, supporting H3. 

 

 

4.5 

Discussion and Implications 

This study investigates the role of the customer in the development of radical 

innovations.  It looked specifically at: who the customer is and their characteristics, what 

type of information is obtained from the customer, and when during the new product 

development process information is obtained from the customer. 

 

4.5.1  Who is the customer? 

Reviewing the customer characteristics obtained in this study it is evident that the 

customers utilized by the firms in the development of radical innovations are advanced 

users.  While Franke and Shah (2003) found that their innovators scored a 4.1 on their 

customer characteristic scale while non-innovators scored 3.5, the firms in this study 

obtained information from customers scoring 5.3 out of 7.  Given this finding, it appears 

that a “lead user” type customer may be the best source of information in the 

development of new products, and they may provide that information during the entire 

process rather than just in the fuzzy front end of innovation. 

Firms are utilizing information from advanced users, but what does that mean?  

One of the arguments made against customer integration in the NPD of radical 

 151


innovations is that the customer will fail to grasp a concept outside of their normal 

products.  The items in the customer characteristics scale indicate that in many 

circumstances it may be the customer advancing faster than the firm.  If this is the case 

and these advanced users are approaching device manufacturers and pursuing new ideas, 

then the users clearly grasp the advanced concepts.  Perhaps it is the innovativeness of the 

customer that should determine whether they are incorporated into the product 

development process. 

 

4.5.2  What information is obtained? 

The finding for Hypotheses 2a and 2b that both technology and market 

information are obtained from the customer provides support for the premise that 

customers provide useful information during the NPD process for radical innovations.  

The pattern of information obtained during the NPD process indicates that the levels of 

information vary by stage.  Technology information levels show a decreasing linear 

pattern over the NPD process.  This pattern supports the idea that early in the NPD of a 

radical innovation, firms require higher levels of technology information than during the 

rest of the process.  A possible reason for this finding is that the firms attempt to obtain a 

sufficient quantity of information to support the entire NPD process.  Alternatively, 

technology information may be most relevant early in the NPD process for a radical 

innovation, or it is possible that, once a technology is selected for the product, it becomes 

fixed and is not easily changed.   

 

 152


4.5.3  When is the information obtained? 

 

When viewed across the stages of NPD, the level of market information a firm 

obtains from its customers forms a U-shape (Figure 4-17).  Considering the activities 

associated with the NPD process, idea generation requires the assessment of market 

conditions and possibly a search for a new market – so it requires high levels of market 

information.  Next in the process is the development stage, which is more internally 

focused, and tends to center upon the more technical aspects of the products’ creation 

hence it requires less customer information.  During the launch stage, the levels of market 

information increase.  Considering the activities associated with actively pricing and 

marketing the new product, much of the market relevant information may come from the 

customers. 

From the results of the analysis for H3, the levels of technology information are 

highest during the early stage of NPD and decrease linearly as NPD progresses.  This 

suggests that there may be an “appropriate” time for a firm to obtain a particular type of 

information from the customer, but additional research is needed to support this idea.  It 

is important that these results be verified in other industry settings.  

 

 

4.6 

Implications 

This research describes the characteristics of the customer, what information they 

provide, and when they provide it in the development of radical innovations from both a 

substantive and theoretical standpoint.  These findings contribute to theory in three ways.  

First, the characteristics of the customers utilized to obtain information during NPD are 

 153


clearly not those of average users or customers.  This provides an indication that all 

customers are not equal, and that customers may be classified to determine which should 

be involved in the development of radical innovations.  Second, this research highlights 

that technology and market information are obtained from customers during the NPD 

process.  These are just two of many types of information, but their high level of 

relevance to the definition of radical innovations suggests that they may also be highly 

relevant to the development of those radical innovations.  Finally, this research shows 

that information is obtained from customers during the entire NPD process.  This expands 

our understanding of the NPD process where the solicitation of information from 

customers is often modeled as one of the early stages of process, but is not highlighted 

throughout the process.   

From a managerial perspective this research enhances managerial practice in three 

ways.  First, an understanding of the use of market and technology information in the 

development of radical innovations allows firms to focus their information acquisition 

activities on the information type or types most appropriate to the stages of NPD.  

Second, customer information is typically obtained and studied in the early stages of the 

NPD process. This research expands our understanding of the potential benefit of 

customer input by studying firms’ utilization of market and technology information 

obtained from the customer over the entire duration of the NPD process.  Finally, 

managers have a deeper understanding of the relationship between the types of 

information obtained, the stages when the information is obtained, and the characteristics 

of customers to solicit. 

 

 154


4.7 

Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research 

It would be managerially useful to study the mechanisms involved in soliciting 

and eliciting information from the customers.  In addition, other industry contexts may 

reveal differences in the innovativeness of the customer as well as their contribution to 

the NPD process.  Future research is required to understand whether and how rigid 

internal processes interfere with the information components of NPD. 

 

Several questions arise in relation to the types of information and the levels 

obtained during NPD.  Are the levels of information obtained from the customers a result 

of the experience of the firms?  Is there a relation between the timing in which 

information is obtained and the time in which it is actually utilized?

CHAPTER V 

 

CONCLUSION - WHAT IT ALL MEANS 

 

 

This research has investigated aspects of the new product development of radical 

innovations.  These aspects are broken into four broad research questions: do customers 

provide technology and market information, when is the information obtained and is that 

information useful, who are the customers providing information, and how does the 

firm’s organizational learning influence the success of the radical innovation by allowing 

the firm to utilize customer information.  These research questions provide the following 

insight. 

 

Customers were shown to provide technology and market information in the 

development of a radical innovation.  The technology information concerned the 

technology content, technical needs, technology uniqueness, and the technical trends fo 

the firm.  The market information related to the size and growth of the market, competitor 

information, and overall market environment.  These two dimensions of information 

relate directly to the definition of a radical innovation and are integral to making a radical 

innovation radical.   

 

In addition to investigating the types of information obtained from customers, the 

stage of the NPD process in which the information was obtained was also considered.  It 

was found that technology and market information was obtained from the customers 

during three distinct phases of the NPD process: 1) Idea Generation, 2) Development, and 

3) Product Launch.  This finding is significant because it expands upon the Lead User 

 

176


methodology which only considered customer input at the earliest stage of the NPD 

process.  Technology and market information can be obtained from customers during the 

entire process. 

 

In the study of the technology and market information obtained from the 

customer, the technology information obtained from the customer during the idea 

generation stage of development was shown to have a positive influence on the market 

share performance of a radical innovation.  This suggests a positive relation of customer 

information with product business performance, but it is interesting to note that only one 

of six possible information type and stage relations was positive.  It is possible that the 

nature of the regulated medical device market produced industry-effects in the study.  

Future research in other industries may reveal differences in the influence of customer 

information on product business performance. 

 

In order to know whether a firm should obtain information from a customer, they 

should know who might provide beneficial information.  Utilizing multiple research 

streams, the research shows that the technology and market information firms obtained 

was from customers that were above average in their innovativeness as well as other 

customer characteristics.  These customers helped to push the advanced technologies and 

markets by specifying and testing products with the medical device manufacturers. 

 

With an understanding of from whom to obtain information, what information to 

obtain, and when to obtain it, this research addressed the final question related to what 

the firm did with the information.  Information dissemination and information utilization 

where shown to positively influence the performance of the innovations.  In a post-hoc 

analysis, the influence of the information type-stage and organizational learning 

 

177


component interactions on business performance were investigated.  These interactions 

provide a possible explanation for the differences firms face in the development of 

radical innovation.  The level of the firms’ organizational learning should dictate the 

inclusion of information obtained from the customer. 

 

The body of work presented in this dissertation provides a launching point for 

future research by addressing the conflict related to customer inclusion in the NPD of 

radical innovations and the learning capability of the firms.

The Role of the Customer in the Development of Medical Devices 

 1. Introduction

I would like to invite you to be in a study to investigate the role of the customer in the new product 
development of radical innovations. The study looks at the use of customer information in the 
development of radical innovations in the medical device market, and will take from 10-15 minutes of 
your time. At the conclusion of this research project, the results of the study will be made available to 
you. 

What will you do? I would like for you to complete the following survey. This survey will ask you to 
recall the product development process for one specific radical innovation that has been in the 
marketplace for at least one year. With this specific product in mind, you will then answer survey 
questions regarding the role of the customer in the process, the business performance of the product 
after release, the newness of the product to the market and technology, and certain organizational 
factors of your firm. 

What will I be asked? You will be asked questions to establish how new the product was to the 
market and the technology. You will also be asked about the involvment of the customer in the product 
development process and the business performance of the product. 

When will you do this? You may complete the survey at any time. The web site will be active for 2 
weeks. 

Do you have to do this? No, you do not have to take part in this research. If you decide not to 
participate, do not complete any of the online survey questions. If you decide to participate, you can 
change your mind later by not submitting your survey responses online. At the end of the survey, your 
answers will be submitted by clicking the "Done" button. 

Will the results be confidential? In no case will any individual results be reported. While the results 
of this research do not require your name for evaluation of your responses, we will wish to contact 
those who do not respond to determine non-response issues. After the non-response bias has been 
checked, the identifying information in the data will be deleted. The data files will be password 
protected and available only to me and my dissertation adviser, Professor David Dilts. 

What if I have questions? If you have any questions about the study or what you will be asked to do, 
please contact me at 615-322-8494 (or email me at joshua.h.johnson@vanderbilt.edu) or contact my 
Faculty Advisor, Professor David Dilts, at 615-322-2322. For additional information about giving
