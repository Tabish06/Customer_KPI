Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to paper examine goal orientation and organizational
commitment in relation to employees’ job attitudes and performance in a hospital. Speciﬁcally, it
investigates the effects of mastery and performance goals on different facets of organizational
commitment and how these effects impact individuals’ job outcomes.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilized an online survey to collect data from 497
hospital employees. The conceptual model was tested using a three-step mediation procedure of
structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimation.
Findings – The results indicate that while mastery goal is related to the three components of
organizational commitment, performance goal is only related to affective commitment. Although
affective and normative commitment are both related to job satisfaction, only the former is linked to
employees’ performance.
Research limitations/implications – The survey is conducted in an East Asian hospital. To ensure
greater generalizability of the results, future research should be conducted using a broader Asian
sample, preferably, in a different organizational setting, and using longitudinal methods in addition to
online surveys.
Practical implications – When managing employees with Asian backgrounds, establishing mastery
goal orientation can potentially cultivate higher organizational commitment. Managers may consider
aligning affectively and normatively committed employees with more complex job assignments because
these employees typically exhibit desirable job attitudes and innovative job performance.
Originality/value – The contributions are two-fold: managerially and scholarly.
Identifying
employees’ mindset in relation to goal orientation and commitment allows ﬁrms to effectively manage
employees’ performance. The paper also provides evidence for rethinking constructs’ relevancy outside of
North America.

Introduction
Achievement goals and organizational commitment are internal representations of desired
states that guide individuals’ pursuits (Austin and Vancouver, 1996; Meyer and Allen,
1997). Achievement goal theory is based on individuals’ intrinsic disposition which relate
to ambition and goal attainment. To examine goal relevant behaviors, it is essential to
understand the underlying commitment mechanisms that motivate individuals to
perform. While theories of motivation abound, the mediating role of organizational
commitment is less studied. Understanding employees as emotional laborers that manage
challenging goals in service delivery processes is crucial to organizational success
(Korczynski, 2002). In a healthcare setting where expectations for service delivery and
clinical outcomes are high, relating goal orientation to the nature of commitment is
necessary to improve employees’ performance. As pointed out by Ramanujam and
Rousseau (2006), health care providers are facing mainly organizational, not clinical,
challenges. This is especially the case for hospital employees because their daily tasks are
inherently complex and involve high levels of uncertainty. Organizational commitment is
essential for reaching such challenging goals (Klein et al., 1999) as these goals require more
effort and typically have lower chances of success than are easy goals (Latham, 2007).

Previous goal and commitment studies were mainly conducted in North America or
other Western countries, and mostly used students (Bell and Kozlowski, 2002; Meyer et al.,
1993) and sales people samples (Riketta, 2002). These studies viewed goal commitment as
a single construct (Klein et al., 1999; Li and Butler, 2004), and operationalized commitment
unidimensionally. In order to probe the underlying forces that cause desired behaviors, it
is necessary to simultaneously examine goals and commitment as two distinctive
constructs, and assess individuals’ commitment components (Meyer et al., 2004). In
addition, to expand knowledge in this area, it is also important to conduct research in a
non-Western culture using emotional labor samples. To ﬁll this research gap, this paper
proposes a conceptual model that links goal orientation to organizational commitment as a
proximal consequence, and examines the effects of these linkages to employees’ attitudinal
response and job outcomes. We conducted the study in a hospital setting, and to the best of
the authors’ knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to incorporate both attitudinal and
orientation variables to predict employees’ performance in such a setting. Adding to its
potential contributions, this study included multiple facets of job outcomes for a more
balanced viewed of performance assessment.

This paper is divided into ﬁve sections. The ﬁrst section will review the literature on
goal orientation, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, in-role, and innovative
performance. The second section will explain the proposed framework of individuals’ goal
orientation that activates different commitment components, and its inﬂuence on job
attitudes and performance outcomes. Research hypotheses will then be presented. The
third section will discuss research methodology and present analytical work on model
testing, followed by results ﬁndings in the fourth the section. The ﬁnal section will discuss
managerial implication and future research directions.

Goal orientation
A goal is the object of a speciﬁc action. Goals direct individuals’ attention toward goal
relevant actions and create a framework for the interpretation of and reaction to related
events and outcomes (Dweck and Leggett, 1988; Elliot and Dweck, 1988). Substantial
empirical evidence suggests that difﬁcult goals, goals that are not easily attainable, lead

131

to higher performance than easy or “do you best” goals (Latham, 2007). Easy goals often
have no external reference can be deﬁned arbitrarily, and thus lead to a wide range of
performance. When a goal level is speciﬁed (for example, attend to three customers’
requests in 30 minutes), it reduces ambiguity because individuals can then relate goal
attainment through two types of orientations: mastery and performance orientation
(Latham, 2007).

Mastery and performance goal orientations can be distinguished by individuals’ learning
motives. While mastery-oriented individuals have a desire to increase competence by
developing new skills and mastering new situations, performance-oriented individuals have
a desire to demonstrate personal competence relative to others and receive positive
evaluations from others (Button et al., 1996; Farr et al., 1993). The primary distinction
between these two orientations is how the instructions given to employees are framed. A
mastery goal is framed to encourage knowledge or skill acquisition, whereas a performance
goal is framed so that employees will focus on completing speciﬁc tasks. According to the
achievement goal theory, both mastery- and performance-oriented employees are strongly
motivated to meet their respective performance goals (Elliot, 2005). These goal orientations
reﬂect individuals’ interpretations of and reactions to events. Individuals with mastery goals
tend to believe their abilities are malleable, and they approach challenging tasks with an
interest to develop new skills. In contrast, individuals with performance orientations view
challenging tasks as a threats that could reveal incompetence, and such individuals could
withdraw from accomplishing the task (Elliot, 2005).

Organizational commitment
Organizational commitment has been conceptualized as a psychological state or mindset
that binds individuals to a course of action relevant to one or more targets, and a willingness
to persist in a course of action (Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran, 2005). Porter et al. (1974)
deﬁned commitment as a strong belief in and acceptance of the organizational goals,
willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of the organization and a desire to maintain
organizational membership. As such, commitment is different from motivation in that
commitment inﬂuences behavior independently of other motives and attitudes, and may
lead to persistence to a course of action even if this conﬂicts with motives (Meyer et al.,
2004; Meyer and Herscovitch, 2001). One aspect of commitment consideration is rooted
in terms of exchange or reward-cost notions where the emphasis is on the bargaining
between the individual and the organization: the more favorable the exchange, the greater
the individuals’ commitment to the organization (Becker, 1960). Interest in organizational
commitment has been stimulated largely by its demonstrated positive relationship to work
behaviors such as job satisfaction, high productivity, and low turnover (Cohen, 2003), but
the ﬁeld has not conducted enough studies outside the Western countries (Lee et al., 2001;
Meyer et al., 2002).

In recent years, research has shown that employees’ commitment to an organization can
take many forms. Meyer and his colleagues conceptualized organizational commitment
in terms of three distinct psychological states, each of which inﬂuences whether or not a
person will remain with the organization. These three psychological states are referred to
as affective, normative, and continuance commitment. Affective commitment is characterized
by emotional attachment to, identiﬁcation with, and involvement in the organization;
normative commitment is characterized by perceived obligation to remain in the organization
and continuance commitment by recognition of
the costs associated with leaving

the organization. Meyer and Allen (1997) argued that the nature of the commitment leads to
organizational outcomes that are quite different. Although all three commitment components
increase the likelihood of employees maintaining membership in an organization, it is
important to distinguish among these as they can have rather different implications for work
behaviors.

Job satisfaction and performance
Job satisfaction and performance are the two work outcomes included in the current study
due to their substantive usefulness in creating a satisfying work place and increasing
employees’ performance. Job satisfaction is the pleasurable emotional state resulting from
individuals’ job experiences. In essence, job satisfaction is an overall state that is derived
from experiencing a work situation. Studies suggest that if individuals are consistent in
their job satisfaction, then the source of this consistency would likely predict job attitude
and performance (Staw and Cohen-Charash, 2005).

Two types of job performance are incorporated in this study. In-role performance is
related to behavior directed toward prescribed tasks, duties, and responsibilities as
formally documented in the job description (Campbell, 1990). Originally conceptualized by
Kanter (1988),
innovative job performance refers to employees’ creativeness and
problem-solving skills in the work place. Similar to the extra-role performance, innovative
work behavior such as generating, promoting, and realizing creative ideas in the work
place is known to be important and beneﬁcial to the organizational success (Janssen, 2000).

Proposed framework
Grounded in existing literature, our proposed framework posits goal orientation as an
effective predictor of organizational commitment, and we suggest such a relationship
has a direct inﬂuence on employees’ attitude (job satisfaction) and behaviors (job
performance). As shown in Figure 1, organizational commitment is positioned as a
proximal consequence of goal orientation, or a mediator between goal orientation and
the job performance.

Goal orientation leads to commitment
The linkage between goal-oriented behavior and commitment derives from general
psychological processes in which people choose to identify with different things in the
workplace and social systems to identify a purpose in life. When individuals are aware of
goal-oriented action and are committed to pursuing these actions, they are more likely to

carry out these behaviors. Goal-oriented behaviors stem from individuals’ willingness to
pursue speciﬁc actions. Locke et al. (1981) and Locke and Latham (1990) recognize that if
there is no commitment, goal by itself will have no motivational effect to carry out
performance.

Goal commitment has traditionally been examined as a unidimensional construct and
thus the effects of goals on individuals’ commitment remain unknown (Hollenbeck and
Klein, 1987). Previous research viewed goal commitment as a determination to achieve a
goal in that commitment implies exerted efforts over time for goal attainment. A few
studies that examined goal orientation and commitment separately indicated more work
is needed to fully understand the dynamic relationships between these two constructs
(Porter, 2005; Lin and Chang, 2005). Furthermore, Meyer et al. (2004) argued that these
two constructs could be incorporated into a framework where commitment is one of
many energizing forces for motivated behavior.

In this paper, we assert that goals direct individuals’ commitment based on achievement
goals towards developing competence (mastery goal), or achievement goals that are geared
towards demonstrating ability and performance (performance goal) relative to others.
Research has shown that individuals who hold a strong mastery goal mindset tend to buffer
themselves from the negative effects of failure, thereby establishing higher self-efﬁcacy;
individuals with a strong performance goal mindset tend to validate their adequacy by using
others as a reference point, seeking favorable judgments and avoiding negative evaluations.
Both classes of goal orientations have been shown to inﬂuence work behaviors in spite of the
different rationales behind goal directed behaviors (Elliot, 2005).

In line with previous research, our framework posits that the awareness of
goal-oriented actions would lead to individuals’ willingness to pursue speciﬁc actions, and
action will more likely be carried out if commitment exists (Johnson et al., 2006; Klein et al.,
1999; Locke et al., 1981; Locke and Latham, 1990). In this vein, the authors argue that goal
orientation is related to commitment regardless of goal-oriented mindset. Since a mastery
goal indicates a strong desire to perform challenging tasks, it directs attention and effort
toward goal-relevant activities such as problem solving and developing alternative
strategies when faced with difﬁcult tasks (Locke and Latham, 2002). A performance goal
indicates the desire to prove and outperform others, therefore it links to commitment by
seeking approval, demonstrating ability and comparing one’s competency in relation to
others (Locke and Latham, 1990). Owing to the inherent desire to master difﬁcult tasks and
demonstrate performance ability,
individuals strive to develop a commitment for
achievement, in line with the achievement motivation theory (Dweck and Leggett, 1988).
Given that both mastery and performance orientations stem from the desire to perform,
these orientations should be related to all three commitment components. For example,
mastery-oriented individuals have a strong need to develop competencies. These individuals
are more likely to develop liking for organizations that enable them to achieve this goal
(affective commitment), and less likely to leave such organizations because it may be
difﬁcult to ﬁnd another similar organization (continuance commitment) or because they feel
obligated to the organization for providing such opportunities (normative commitment;
Redman and Snape, 2005). In addition, performance-oriented individuals have a strong need
for approval and validation from their peers or workgroups. They are therefore motivated to
hold a stronger sense of membership in the organization to obtain these approval and
validation. This sense of membership to the organization could be manifested in continuance
(sunk costs), normative (felt obligation), and affective (liking) commitment.

Organizational commitment leads to satisfaction and performance
Previous research has documented the positive relationship between organizational
commitment and work outcomes (Jaramillo et al., 2005). Researchers have also found that
different conceptualizations of commitment
impact employees’ work behaviors
differently in terms of job satisfaction and performance (Meyer et al., 2002). Studies on
the relationship between commitment components and job attitudes has shown that
affective commitment is consistently related to overall job satisfaction. Continuance
commitment also frequently correlates with job satisfaction, albeit at a lower magnitude
(Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran, 2005; Mathieu and Zajac, 1990). In a meta-analysis, the
two affectively based commitment components, affective and normative commitment,
are found to have a positive relationship with job satisfaction (Meyer et al., 2002) but the
latter had a lower correlation with job satisfaction. Conversely, continuance commitment
was negatively related to job satisfaction. Employees with high-continuance
commitment are less likely to express satisfaction with their jobs. These individuals
feel that they have to stay in the organization because they have vested interests in it and
leaving would be costly (Becker, 1960).

Even though the three components of commitment generally bind employees to their
organization, empirical studies yield mixed ﬁndings. Studies found affective
commitment had the strongest and most encouraging relationship with organization
speciﬁc outcomes such as task performance and organizational citizenship behavior.
Normative commitment was also positively associated with desirable outcomes, but not
as strongly. Continuance commitment has either no relationship or negatively correlates
with performance (Mathieu and Zajac, 1990; Meyer et al., 2002). Past research also found
weak correlations between attitudinal and continuance commitments and job
performance (Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran, 2005). Both affective and normative
commitment were predictors of extra-role performance such as innovative job
behaviors, but continuance commitment was unrelated (MacKenzie et al., 1998). Based
on various reported ﬁndings, the authors concur with the majority view that affective
and normative commitment are positively associated with, and continuance
commitment is negatively associated with job performance.

Mediation relationship
Goals have an energizing function that can directly and indirectly inﬂuence
organizational outcomes such as training and development (Brett and VandeWalle,
1999), feedback-seeking (VandeWalle and Cummings, 1997), and in-role performance
(Harris et al., 2005). Payne et al. (2007) argued that the relationship between goal
orientation dimensions and organizational consequences, such as job performance and
learning, is indirect and mediated by proximal consequences. They found that goal
orientation is a much stronger predictor of proximal consequences (e.g. self-efﬁcacy and
feedback seeking) than of distal consequences (e.g. academic and job performance).
Furthermore, Locke and Latham (2002) provided such support in their comprehensive
review of goal construct.

The authors propose that organizational commitment is a mediator that inﬂuences
individuals’ goal orientations and work behaviors. When pursuing different goals,
individuals exhibit different degrees of commitment, based on underlying commitment
mechanisms, to carry out speciﬁc tasks. Such commitment mechanisms will predispose
individuals to react in some predictable ways based on the dominancy of commitment


components, and consequently, inﬂuence the levels of job satisfaction and performance
outcomes. There is some research that supports the mediating role organizational
commitment has in both micro (Restubog et al., 2006) and macro (Gong et al., 2009)
organizational research. For example, Restubog et al. (2006) found that affective
commitment mediated the relation between psychological contract breach and
self-reported and supervisor-rated civic virtue, both of which are extra-role behaviors,
but not between psychological contract breach and in-role performance.

Research hypotheses
Since organizational commitment is posited to mediate the relation between goal
orientation and both job satisfaction and job performance, the authors tested the
mediation effects using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) recommended three-step procedure.
First, we tested the effect of goal orientation on two outcome variables (job satisfaction
and performance). A second analysis tests whether goal orientation inﬂuences the
mediator, organizational commitment. A third analysis tests whether the mediator
inﬂuenced job performance, controlling for goal orientation. The last analysis tests the
drop in inﬂuence of goal orientation when the proposed mediator is included in the
model. To expand knowledge of the studied constructs outside the North America, this
study tests the proposed model by positing the aforementioned relationships exist in the
current East Asian sample in the following research hypotheses:

H1. Mastery orientation is positively related to affective, normative, and

continuance commitment.

H2. Performance orientation is positively related to affective, normative, and

continuance commitment.

H3. Both affective and normative commitments are positively related to job

satisfaction.

H4. Continuance commitment is negatively related to job satisfaction.

H5. Affective commitment is positively associated with in-role and innovative job

performance.

H6. Normative commitment is positively associated with in-role and innovative

job performance.

H7. Continuance commitment is negatively associated with in-role and innovative

job performance.

Methods
Research design
The authors collected data using an online survey in a Singapore hospital. The hospital’s
top management communicated the purpose of this research to all service units and
assured anonymity and conﬁdentiality. After several brieﬁngs and a pre-test in a few
service unit, employees received instructions on how to complete the survey in their
designated service units to ensure privacy. An independent agency designed the
web-based survey on multiple screen views of seven-point balanced Likert scales and
collected the data. Numerous steps ensured that the online questionnaire was easy to

read, and the scale points were properly labeled. Survey questions were divided into
several sections with common themes to eliminate confusion. All participants were
computer-literate, as required in their jobs. To take the survey, employees are required to
logon using their network ID as a security measure. They are prompted to read an
introductory page, followed by the informed consent page and a box to check if they
agree to participate. On this screen view, they are informed of their anonymity and how
to contact the researchers if they have any concerns.

Sample
The contacted hospital employs 1,300 employees, approximately 70 percent of which are
employees who have direct contact with patients and their families. All employees were
invited to participate in this research. A total of 656 employees completed the survey. Of
this total, 497 surveys were matched to supervisors’ evaluations, yielding an overall
usable response rate of 55 percent. Quoting various source of information, Ilieva et al.
(2002) found that the average online surveys response rate ranges from 15 to 29 percent.
Thus, the response rate obtained in this study is well above the acceptable rate for an
online survey (Grandolas et al., 2003; Tse, 1998). This high response rate reﬂects top
management’s encouraging employees to participate. In addition, management told
employees it had no inﬂuence on the design of the survey, which was part of a scholarly
project, and would not have access to any identifying information. Table I shows the
respondents’ proﬁles.

Measures
Goal orientations were assessed using Janssen and Van Yperen’s (2004) 19-item scale
consisting of 11 items on mastery orientation and eight items on performance orientation.
These scales had obtained good internal reliability of 0.90 for mastery orientation and
0.91 for performance in Van Yperen and Janssen’s (2002) study. The organizational
commitment scale used was adapted from Meyer et al.’s (1993) 18-item scale with six
items each for assessing affective, normative, and continuance commitment. The alpha
reliabilities are affective a¼ 0.87, normative a¼ 0.73, and continuance a¼ 0.79. Job
satisfaction was assessed using a ﬁve-item scale adapted from Brown and Peterson (1994)
that received reliability of 0.86. For job performance, Podsakoff and MacKenzie’s (1989)
in-role performance scale was used (a¼ 0.85), and Janssen and Van Yperen’s (2004)
nine-item innovative job performance scale was adapted (a¼ 0.98) (see the Appendix for
list of items). All measures are on a seven-point Likert scale. Participants’ immediate
supervisors indicated the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the performance
statements. The descriptive statistics and correlation matrix are presented in Table II.

Results
Measurement model
A conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the factor structure. The
full measurement model consists of eight latent variables; each item is speciﬁed to load
on one speciﬁc latent variable only. The CFA results provide strong evidence of
convergent and discriminant validity. Table III shows that all factor loadings are
signiﬁcant at p , 0.01. In Table III, also, the model ﬁt indices suggest that the full
measurement model ﬁt the data well: x2 ¼ 1,877, df ¼ 917, NNFI ¼ 0.939, CFI ¼ 0.943,
SRMR ¼ 0.041, RMSEA ¼ 0.046 (90 percent CI: 0.043-0.049).

from 0.72 to 0.97, were adequate-to-excellent. Except for continuance commitment
which is marginally lower than the recommended level, all constructs attained an
average variance extracted (AVE) threshold of 0.50, as recommended by Fornell and
Larcker (1981), signifying good discriminant validity of the constructs. Lastly, the
variation in the latent distribution is captured equally well and the responses are
generally excellent between observed and ﬁtted values for the latent variables.

Structural model
The proposed framework in Figure 1 shows the three dimensions of commitment
(affective, normative, and continuance) as the proximal consequences of two exogenous
constructs: mastery and performance goal orientation. Together, these constructs are
expected to inﬂuence job satisfaction and job performance (in-role and innovative job
performance). Since measurement error can degrade the metric quality and curtail the
relationships among variables making them difﬁcult to detect, to mitigate this problem the
authors employed an estimation method that explicitly identiﬁes model measurement
errors. Speciﬁcally, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator via the EQS software is used, and
latent factor scores corresponding to each construct from the preceding CFA analysis are
extracted (Jo¨reskog, 2000).
The results show that x2-statistics are signiﬁcant at p , 0.001, x2 ¼ 2136, df ¼ 930.
As shown in Figure 2, all path coefﬁcients are standardized coefﬁcients and the values in
parentheses represent the respective t-ratios. Since the x2-statistic is known to be overly
sensitive to sample size, incremental (e.g. NFI and CFI) and absolute goodness-of-ﬁt
indices (e.g. SRMR and RMSEA) are used as these indicators provide greater accuracy in
assessing model ﬁt (MacCallum and Austin, 2000). The results show that NFI ¼ 0.982
and CFI ¼ 0.990, are both higher than the 0.90 suggested value for reasonable ﬁt.
Similarly, the SRMR ¼ 0.067 and RMSEA ¼ 0.051 (90 percent CI: 0.048-0.051), which
indicates marginal discrepancies that are narrowly bounded. Lastly, the parsimony
index is NNFI ¼ 0.989, signifying that the proposed framework is a parsimonious
model, providing good ﬁt to the data.

Hypotheses testing
The mediation testing concludes that organizational commitment does not mediate the
relationship between goal orientation and job performance. There is no signiﬁcant
relationship when job satisfaction and innovative performance are regressed on goal
orientations. H1 and H2 hypothesize positive relationships between the two goal
orientation constructs and the three components of organizational commitment. Three
paths running from mastery orientation were found to be statistically signiﬁcant at
p , 0.05; these paths went to affective commitment (b¼ 0.53), normative commitment
(b¼ 0.69), and continuance commitment (b¼ 0.45). Thus, H1 is supported. Contrary to
our hypothesis, performance orientation is negatively related to affective commitment,
b¼ 2 0.21 ( p , 0.05). The path coefﬁcients between performance orientation and the
other two commitment components are not signiﬁcant. Hence, H2 is not supported.

In the third part of the mediation testing, the effects of mediator on job satisfaction
and performance are tested using structural equation technique to assess the overall
structural relationship. H3 hypothesizes a positive relationship between affective-based
commitment components and job satisfaction, and H4 hypothesizes a negative
relationship between cost-based commitment and job satisfaction. At p , 0.05, the path
coefﬁcients from affective commitment and normative commitment to job satisfaction
are 0.17 and 0.53, respectively, supporting H3. Continuance commitment was not related
to job satisfaction. Hence, H4 is not supported. H5 and H6 hypothesize a positive, and
H7 hypothesizes a negative, relationship between commitment components and the two
facets of job performance. At p , 0.05, the path coefﬁcients between affective
commitment and in-role performance is b¼ 0.07 and innovative job performance is
b¼ 0.12, signifying a positive, and signiﬁcant relationship. Thus, H5 is supported.

Contrary to our hypothesis, the path coefﬁcients between normative commitment and
the two facets of job performance are partially signiﬁcant, but in the opposite direction.

Normative commitment has no relationship with in-role performance b¼ 2 0.04
( p . 0.05), and it has a negative but weak relationship with innovative job performance
b¼ 2 0.10 ( p , 0.05). Thus, H6 is not supported. Similarly, the path coefﬁcients
between continuance commitment and the two facets of performance were not
signiﬁcant. Hence, H7 is also not supported.

Discussion
This research constitutes an attempt to extend the extant literature on goal orientation
and organizational commitment. Our results indicate that mastery-oriented individuals
are strongly committed to their organizations regardless of how commitment is
deﬁned. Mastery-oriented individuals emphasize increasing their competence and skills in
a supportive environment and develop a greater liking (affective commitment) for
organizations that support sharpening skills. These individuals also develop a sense of
obligation (normative commitment) to remain in the organization because the organization
provides resources to help satisfy their inner desire to develop more skills. Finally,
mastery-oriented individuals may perceive leaving the organization as losing chances to
improve their competence and skills (continuance commitment); they may fear working in
an organization that places less value on developing competence and skills.

Consistent with previous research, this study found individuals with high affective
and normative commitments generally report satisfaction with their jobs (Meyer and
Herscovitch, 2001; Vandenberg and Lance, 1992). The ﬁndings on commitment may
also reﬂect cultural values. Once a British colony, the majority of Singapore’s population
(75 percent)
is of Chinese decent, so most people embrace traditional Chinese
philosophies in which social order, trust, and loyalty are important social norms. As Siu
(2003) argued, in Asian cultures both affective and normative commitments may be
affected by employees’ sense of obligation and loyalty because those are cultural values.
The effect of these values may be evident in the path coefﬁcients from normative
commitment to job satisfaction; they are much higher than the path from affective
commitment to job satisfaction. The authors also argue that individuals who are
normatively committed may have a greater need to reduce tension caused by their
commitment to the organization as described as a state of cognitive dissonance, and thus
report higher satisfaction with their job (Bateman and Strasser, 1984; Salancik and
Pfeffer, 1978).

Although our hypotheses were generally supported, there were a few unexpected
ﬁndings. First, we found that performance orientation is only moderately related to
affective commitment. Performance-oriented employees may feel more job stress than
their mastery-oriented co-workers and are, therefore, more likely to report lower levels of
affective commitment (Podsakoff et al., 2007). Furthermore, performance-oriented
employees’ expectations of the job and their understanding of job requirements may not
have matched, particularly in a complex health care environment, which led to lower
affective commitment (Wanous, 1973). These performance-oriented employees may also
perceive less organizational support (Moideenkutty et al., 2001); thus, they may
withdraw their sense of obligation to the organization.

Second, this study found that continuance commitment was unrelated to job
satisfaction, which is consistent with previous meta-analyses (Cooper-Hakim and
Viswesvaran, 2005; Meyer et al., 2002). The continuance commitment construct mainly
deals with the continuation of an action, typically remaining with an organization

because of the perceived costs of leaving (Meyer and Allen, 1991). The adapted measure
of job satisfaction focused mainly on participants’ affective attitudes toward their jobs
and may not have captured perceptions that lead to increased continuance commitment
(i.e. satisfaction with pension, satisfaction with seniority). Other research in Asian
contexts has shown similar results (Lee and Gao, 2005).

Third, this study found a weak, negative, but signiﬁcant relationship between
normative commitment and innovative job behavior. As expected, individuals who feel
obligated to remain with an organization are less likely to engage in non-mandatory,
innovative job behaviors. Moreover, in our sample, about 70 percent of the participants
were employed by the hospital for less than ﬁve years. As such, the organization may have
had insufﬁcient time to cultivate normative commitment in these relatively new
employees (Meyer and Allen, 1997). Individuals who are affectively committed to the
organization are most likely to engage in innovative job behaviors, as found in this study.

Limitations
This study contributes to the extant literature on goal orientation and organizational
commitment in the following ways. First, Payne et al.
(2007) found that proximal
consequences of goal orientation mediated its relationship with distal consequences. In this
study, organizational commitment is hypothesized as a proximal consequence of goal
orientation, but our results are mixed. This study found support for the relationship between
mastery orientation and affective and normative commitments in the hypothesized
direction, but not for performance orientation. Future studies should investigate the effects
of antecedents of goal orientation on their relationship to organizational commitment. For
example, achievement and personality variables have been found to affect goal orientation
(Fortunato and Goldblatt, 2006; Phillips and Gully, 1997). It would be prudent to test how
these antecedents affect our model, as evidence shows they impact both job satisfaction and
in-role and innovative job performance (Barrick and Mount, 1991; Ilies et al., 2006).

Second, parallel to the concept of extra-role behavior, innovative performance is used to
capture the employees’ creativity in generating, promoting, and realizing problem-solving
ideas critical to service delivery. Future studies should incorporate organizational
citizenship behaviors such as helping behavior and civic virtue as research has shown that
organizational citizenship behaviors may serve as a critical link between aspects of the
employee-organization relationship and customers’ perceptions of service quality (Bell
and Menguc, 2002).

Third, the constructs used in our study were primarily developed and tested using North
American samples. The generalizability of the three-component model of organizational
commitment outside of North America is subject for further research (Allen and Meyer, 1996;
Lee et al., 2001). Our research supports the generalizability of the three-component model of
organizational commitment in an East Asian context, similar to the work of Lee et al. (2001).
In addition, our data supports the use of measures of goal orientation (Janssen and
Van Yperen, 2004) and job satisfaction in Asian cultures. Future research investigating
these constructs should consider the effects of more distal variables, such as cultural norms,
in goal and commitment research outside of North America.

Finally, while our cross-sectional data showed general support for a link between
affective and normative commitment and job satisfaction, previous research investigating
the causal linkages of latent variables has called for the use of longitudinal designs or the
collection of multiple waves of data (Currivan, 1999; Vandenberg and Lance, 1992). To


IJOA

144

validate our results, we encourage future studies include a longitudinal component and be
conducted using different sample types. Future research should also investigate other
distal and meditational variables in the relationship among goal orientation,
job
satisfaction, and job performance.

Implications for managerial practice
The current study found that mastery-oriented individuals are also committed to the
organization regardless of how their psychological state of commitment is deﬁned.
Employees adjust their performance in response to their interaction with managers and to
the signals they receive through their daily routines. To cultivate mastery orientation,
managers must communicate such that the organization values knowledge or skill
acquisition, in addition to goal completion as an ultimate outcome. In addition, recruitment
materials should emphasize the importance of competence development over competition
in the organization. Since mastery-oriented individuals tend to value organizational
support, organizations should make available training and developmental programs that
enhance skill sets to increase the satisfaction of mastery-oriented individuals
(Papaioannou and Christodoulidis, 2007).

The next managerial implication is related to effective service delivery. Managers can
apply our framework to identify the underlying mechanisms that motivate employees and
assess which commitment facet generates the highest performance, and how it relates to
basic job roles or innovation behaviors. When managers are able to identify affectively
committed employees, managers can then motivate them using more personalized
communication to boost productivity and efﬁciency. Past research has shown that
organizational commitment mediates the relationship between stressors and turnover
intentions and withdrawal behavior (Podsakoff et al., 2007). As such, organizational
commitment serves an important role while working in stressful situations (as is in our
sample) because it helps reduce employee quitting cognitions and withdrawal behaviors.
In summary, the above ﬁndings suggest that creating a mastery goal-oriented culture
can enhance committed behaviors that likely to lead to positive performance. In today’s
knowledge-based organization, generating job enhancement with mastery goal in mind
promotes knowledge development and risk taking. It also allows double-loop learning that
emphasizes questioning of fundamental assumptions, archaic strategies, and obsolete
routines. Understanding employees’ learning behaviors help managers to deﬁne and solve
problems effectively (Argyris and Scho¨n, 1978).
