In today’s highly competitive and rapidly changing business environment, organizations must take full advantage of 
their work force’s creative potential to prosper or even survive. The need to enhance creative performance for long-term 
success is perhaps especially true in the sales profession, where individual and organizational success depends on supply-
ing innovative and useful solutions for customers. Emerging research has shown that a leader’s emotional intelligence 
positively supports workers’ creative performance. Employing a sample of 460 field members, this study extends this 
research by exploring how a sales representative’s emotional intelligence influences his or her creativity and key work 
outcomes. The findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and managerial implications. Limitations and suggestions 
for future research are offered.

Creativity has long been recognized and studied in fields such as 
art and music. In marketing, scholarship on creativity has been 
extensively examined in advertising. Studies have explored the 
factors affecting creativity at the advertising agency, including 
examining the characteristics of a creative person, the creative 
process,  the  client  and  the  advertising  agency  relationship, 
and the climate for creativity (Koslow, Sasser, and Riordan 
2003, 2006; Sasser and Koslow 2008; Verbeke et al. 2008b). 
In recent years, scholars (Zhou and George 2003) and practi-
tioners (Florida 2002) have begun to postulate that creativity 
is also a critical success factor in business and other fields that 
have not traditionally been considered “creative” (Zhou and 
George 2003). In fact, Wang and Netemeyer (2004) and others 
(McAdam and Keogh 2004; Rego et al. 2007) have suggested 
that in today’s highly competitive and rapidly changing busi-
ness environment, organizations must take full advantage of 
their work forces’ creative potential to prosper or to simply 
survive (McAdam and Keogh 2004; Rego et al. 2007; Wang 
and Netemeyer 2004).

It is broadly accepted that more creative individuals and 
organizations  tend  to  have  distinct  advantages  in  the  mar-
ketplace (Amabile 1988; Devanna and Tichy 1990; Kanter 
1983; Oldham and Cummings 1996; Shalley 1995). Perhaps 
that is no more true than in the sales profession, in which 
individual and organizational success depends on supplying 
innovative and useful solutions for customers in a turbulent

environment  (Chonko  and  Jones  2005).  Recognizing  its 
importance, authors often list creativity as an essential charac-
teristic of successful salespeople and sales managers (see, e.g., 
Dubinsky and Ingram 1983; Weitz, Castleberry, and Tanner 
2009).  In  addition,  empirical  research  has  established  the 
positive linkage between salesperson creativity and his or her 
(1) practice of adaptive selling behaviors, (2) job satisfaction, 
(3) sales performance, and (4) likelihood for promotion to 
sales management (Dubinsky and Ingram 1983; Wang and 
Netemeyer 2004).

While research has emerged relating creativity in sales with 
important outcomes, such as job satisfaction and performance, 
to date no research has focused on understanding how to foster 
creative performance in salespeople. However, in other fields, 
research has identified certain factors that have the potential 
to  enhance  or  inhibit  creativity  (Oldham  and  Cummings 
1996; Shin and Zhou 2003; Zhou 2003). One such factor 
is emotional intelligence. Research has identified a positive 
relationship between employee creativity and the emotional 
intelligence of their immediate manager (Rego et al. 2007). 
In an effort to explain this relationship, researchers speculate 
that  emotionally  intelligent  leaders  create  an  environment 
of trust and respect that encourages workers to feel free to 
propose unconventional and goal-oriented ideas. This trust 
and respect can play a critical role in the affect-laden creative 
process, as those that create often experience excitement or 
anguish, depending on the success of their creations.

In  the  present  study,  we  continue  to  explore  the  link 
between emotional intelligence and creativity. Importantly, our

research will make a unique contribution in at least two areas. 
We are the first to study the relationship between emotional 
intelligence and creativity in the area of professional selling. In 
addition, instead of focusing on the emotional intelligence of 
the manager, we shift our research attention to the emotional 
intelligence of the individual worker—the salesperson. This 
approach is consistent with an emerging recognition of the 
important role emotion plays in the buyer–seller interaction 
(Brown, Cron, and Slocum 1997; Kidwell, McFarland, and 
Avila 2007; Kidwell et al. 2011; Rentz et al. 2002). As a first 
step, we briefly discuss the concepts of emotional intelligence 
and creativity in the selling context. Then, we empirically test 
a model depicting that relationship. Finally, we discuss the 
theoretical and managerial implications of this research.

thEorEtical Background and  

rEsEarch hypothEsEs

creativity

Creativity has long held a central role in fields ranging from 
the fine arts and psychology to management studies (Fillis and 
McAuley 2000). Traditionally, creativity has been defined as 
an idea that is novel and appropriate (Amabile 1988; Amabile 
et al. 2005; Sternberg 1988). To be novel, the idea (behavior, 
product, thought, output, etc.) must be new, but that alone 
is not enough to be considered creative. To be creative, the 
idea must also be appropriate, which means it must be useful 
and actionable (Amabile 1988). Creativity has been described 
as a two-step process. The first step looks to develop a novel 
idea and the second step intends to incorporate this idea into 
a strategic response (Sasser and Koslow 2008). In a business 
setting, this definition suggests that calling an advertisement 
containing  a  novel  use  of  color  or  music,  but  lacking  any 
actual  impact  on  business  performance,  creative  would  be 
considered a misnomer.

Over  the  years  the  source  of  creativity  has  been  much 
debated and researched. Traditionally, this research has focused 
on identifying personal characteristics and attributes associ-
ated with creative individuals. For example, some researchers 
have argued that creativity, like many other human abilities, 
has  a  basis  in  biology  through  neurological  or  genetic  dif-
ferences. Unfortunately, neither of these streams of research 
has proved fruitful. In fact, when summarizing the attempts 
to relate creativity to neurology, Gardner states, “You could 
know every bit of neurocircuitry in somebody’s head, and you 
still would not know whether or not that person was creative” 
(2001, p. 130). In like manner, researchers have been unable 
to find any convincing evidence of genetic components to 
creativity (Barron 1972; Reznikoff et al. 1973; Sawyer 2006; 
Vandenberg 1968).

While research indicates that biology has little to do with 
creativity,  research  into  cognitive  styles  and  characteristics 
has been more fruitful. In fact, several cognitive character-
istics,  including  broad  interest,  attraction  to  complexity, 
intuition,  aesthetic sensitivity, toleration of ambiguity,  and 
self-confidence,  have  consistently  been  seen  to  relate  posi-
tively  with  creative  performance  (Oldham  and  Cummings 
1996). In addition, research has found that individuals will 
be more creative in a context in which they experience a high 
level of intrinsic motivation. In other words, the individual is 
excited about the work itself (Amabile 1983, 1987; Oldham 
and Cummings 1996; Shalley 1991), and as a result, is more 
likely to stay focused on the task, to work longer on a problem, 
and to be more likely to take a risk. In particular, research 
has focused on job design and supervisory style as contextual 
factors enhancing or inhibiting workplace creativity. In gen-
eral, jobs that are complex and challenging, with high levels 
of autonomy, variety, significance, and feedback, have been 
seen to encourage higher levels of creativity (Deci, Connell, 
and Ryan 1989; Hackman and Oldham 1980; Oldham and 
Cummings  1996).  In  like  manner,  supportive  supervision 
has been shown to enhance creative achievement (Deci and 
Ryan 1985, 1987; Deci, Connell, and Ryan 1989). In sum, it 
appears that certain cognitive styles and abilities and certain 
situational contexts have the potential to encourage or inhibit 
creative performance.

Emotional intelligence

Emotional intelligence (EI) has been identified as a variable 
that accounts for significant variance in a person’s problem 
solving and social relationships (Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso 
2008).  Several  conceptualizations  of  EI  exist.  One  con-
ceptualization is that EI is “an eclectic mix of traits, many 
dispositional,  such  as  happiness,  self-esteem,  optimism, 
and self-management” (Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso 2008, 
p. 503; Bar-On 2000). Others conceptualize EI as emotional 
and social competencies such as emotional self-awareness, 
empathy, teamwork, and leadership (Boyatzis and Saatcioglu 
2008). However, a generally accepted conceptualization of EI 
has emerged, termed the “integrative model approach” that 
depicts EI as a combination of abilities (Mayer, Roberts, and 
Barsade 2008). EI is defined, by this approach, as “the ability 
to perceive accurately, appraise, and express emotions; the 
ability to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate 
thought; the ability to understand emotion and emotional 
knowledge; and the ability to regulate emotions so as to pro-
mote emotional and intellectual growth” (Mayer and Salovey 
1997, p. 35). This definition and the related “four-branch 
model” that considers EI as combining abilities from four 
areas:  (1)  accurately  perceiving  emotion,  (2)  using  emo-


tions to facilitate thought, (3) understanding emotion, and 
(4) managing emotion (Joseph and Newman 2010b; Mayer 
and Salovey 1997; Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso 2008; Mayer 
et al. 2003) has emerged as the dominant view of EI.

The ability to perceive emotions describes the ability to 
accurately identify one’s own emotions and emotions in oth-
ers. As described by Kidwell, McFarland, and Avila (2007), 
a salesperson that accurately perceives emotions is able to 
accurately pick up on the customer’s emotional response to 
his or her appeal, gain information concerning a customer’s 
psychological state (i.e., comprehension or confusion related 
to a complex product), and empathize with a customer. The 
ability to use emotion means that one can access and create 
emotions to aid judgment and thought. A salesperson can 
use emotion to get his or her client excited about a prod-
uct  or  service  or  to  respond  appropriately  when  a  client 
exhibits confusion about a complex product. The ability to 
understand  emotions  indicates  that  one  can  identify  and 
understand complex emotions and feelings. For example, a 
salesperson can access his or her knowledge of emotions to 
consider  how  the  client’s  emotion  would  impact  decision 
making. In other words, the salesperson can utilize “what-if ” 
conditions to decide on the appropriate client communica-
tion. The ability to regulate emotions means that one can 
be open to feelings and manage one’s own and others’ emo-
tions in making decisions. In fact, Damasio (1994) posited 
that intelligent decision making must include emotion. For 
example, a salesperson that can regulate his or her emotions is 
open to his or her feelings and is able to pay attention to what 
those feelings communicate. By using emotional and rational 
data, the salesperson can make the most favorable decisions 
regarding the client and for his or her organization.

Emotional intelligence and creativity

Recently, a handful of researchers have begun to explore the 
potential contextual link between EI and creativity (Rego et 
al. 2007; Zhou and George 2003). For example, Zhou and 
George (2003) present a conceptual model of how leaders’ 
EI influences their employees’ creativity through five routes: 
identification, information gathering, idea generation, evalu-
ation, and modification. Rego et al. (2007) provide empiri-
cal evidence that leaders’ EI inspires the creativity of their 
employees. In other words, the work force feels encouraged 
to  discover  and  develop  creative  solutions  when  they  feel 
that their leaders are amenable to ideas that may be counter 
to their leaders’ own solutions. Also, workers recognize that 
leaders with high EI can help them handle issues they may 
confront  when  using  creativity  to  address  work  problems 
and  opportunities. Tying  this  stream  of  research  to  the 
creativity literature, the leader possessing high EI creates an

environment that stimulates creativity through behaviors that 
heighten worker’s intrinsic motivation. Figure 1 presents the 
model under investigation in this study.

But what of the EI of the salesperson? As already noted, 
research indicates that individual cognitive styles and char-
acteristics tend to impact creativity. Following this logic, we 
turn our focus on the individual salesperson and propose 
that a salesperson’s own EI can lead to utilizing creativity to 
deal with problems and optimize procedures and processes 
associated with the sales job. A salesperson that deals with 
ever-increasingly  knowledgeable  and  demanding  custom-
ers  must  be  able  to  think  on  his  or  her  feet.  Schutte  et 
al. (2008) describes this sales activity as a high emotional 
affordance situation. Their study indicated that those with 
high  EI  would  be  more  successful  in  such  situations  and 
be able to adapt to accomplish the goal for that situation. 
Rafaeli and Sutton’s emotional labor research (Rafaeli and 
Sutton 1987, 1989; Sutton and Rafaeli 1988) reported that 
customer and organizational outcomes were affected by how 
salespeople  expressed  their  emotions.  Salovey  and  Grewal 
(2005) acknowledge that EI leads to adaptive functioning, 
and  this  ability  could  lead  to  the  salesperson  providing  a 
unique customer solution. For example, in customer interac-
tions, a salesperson can utilize his or her EI to recognize the 
customer’s emotional state, and use his or her knowledge of 
emotions and regulate those emotions to form a response 
that fits the situation. For some customers, the salesperson 
may  have  to  think  outside  the  box  and  provide  a  unique 
solution to meet the customer’s needs. For example, a field 
salesperson may adapt a process or create a specially priced 
bundle of products based on customer demand. Thus, we 
extend the literature from examining the leader’s EI to the 
salesperson’s EI and its impact on creativity with the follow-
ing hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: A salesperson’s emotional intelligence is posi-
tively associated with his or her creativity.

Emotional intelligence and Job outcomes

Over the past decade, researchers have begun exploring the 
relationship  between  EI  and  several  job  outcomes. Two  of 
the  most  studied  outcomes  have  been  job  satisfaction  and 
performance. In both cases, the research has produced mixed 
results. For example, some studies have found weak relation-
ships between EI and job satisfaction (Kafetsios and Loumakou 
2007). Using the Bar-On EI measure, Kafetsios and Loumakou 
(2007) found that only general mood was positively associated 
with job satisfaction and only with younger respondents. Oth-
ers have found stronger positive relationships (Carmeli 2003; 
Lopes et al. 2006; Sy, Tram, and O’Hara 2006; Wong and Law 
2002). These studies investigated senior managers, financial 
analysts, administrative staff, food service employees, and busi-
ness students using different measures of EI. Unfortunately, to 
this point no empirical studies have addressed the relationship 
between EI and job satisfaction in the selling profession.

We  propose  that  field  member’s  EI  can  positively  influ-
ence job satisfaction. Those with high EI are more skilled at 
appraising their own and others’ emotions and at using and 
regulating emotions for decision making than those with low 
EI. A salesperson with high EI is able to recognize when he or 
she encounters stress or dissatisfaction and is able to regulate 
his or her emotions to deal with the stress experienced. A sales-
person with low levels of EI is less adept at recognizing his or 
her emotions and has fewer skills to manage the experience of 
negative emotions, which leads to decreased job satisfaction.
In addition, those with high EI can use their abilities to 
appraise and use emotions in others. These EI skills are criti-
cal to a salesperson who is a boundary spanner and therefore 
must interact with his or her customers and his or her orga-
nization’s management and coworkers. Using one’s EI skills 
can promote positive social exchanges and increase one’s job 
satisfaction (Kafetsios and Zampetakis 2008; Sy, Tram, and 
O’Hara 2006).

In reference to job performance, while some studies have 
found a positive relationship between EI and different mea-
sures of job performance (Chang and Latham 2004; Lam and 
Kirby 2002; Sy, Tram, and O’Hara 2006), others have found 
either no relationship or an inconsistent relationship (Joseph 
and Newman 2010b; Sosik and Megerian 1999). Sosik and 
Megerian (1999) report that managers who are more self-aware 
and possess higher levels of EI are perceived as more effective 
by both their supervisors and team than those managers who 
are less self-aware. Joseph and Newman’s (2010b) meta-analysis 
using actual job performance measures indicated no relation-
ship between EI and job performance. As with the relationship 
between EI and job satisfaction, much of the variation in the 
findings can be attributed to differences in conceptualization 
and measurement approaches of the constructs. For example, 
while Lam and Kirby (2002) grounded their conceptualiza-

tion and measurement of EI in Mayer and Salovy’s multifactor 
view of EI, Sosik and Megerian (1999) used individual scales 
they selected from the general academic literature to measure 
each of six components (self-awareness, self-monitoring, self-
motivation, interpersonal control, relationship management, 
and empathy) they felt relevant to explaining EI. Conversely, 
Joseph and Newman (2010b) utilized a meta-analysis of previ-
ous research built around their unique cascading view of EI, 
with mixed results. Thus, different measures of EI and job 
performance may be responsible for the inconsistent findings 
seen in previous literature. Perhaps more importantly, a positive 
relationship has been found between EI and job performance 
in sales settings (Kidwell, McFarland, and Avila 2007; Rozell, 
Pettijohn, and Parker 2006; Verbeke et al. 2008a).

Some research supports that appraisal and use of emotions 
leads to better cognitive decision making (Caruso and Salovey 
2004;  Lyubomirsky,  King,  and  Diener  2005),  potentially 
leading to better performance. By recognizing their own emo-
tions, salespeople could utilize them to increase performance. 
For example, a salesperson that recognizes that he or she is 
happy  or  content  could  potentially  provide  more  positive 
interactions  with  his  or  her  customers  and  offer  excellent 
customer service. Rozell, Pettijohn, and Parker (2004) found 
that increased EI is positively correlated with a salesperson’s 
customer orientation. In addition, Kidwell, McFarland, and 
Avila (2007) found that the ability to accurately appraise others’ 
emotions moderates the relationship between adaptive selling 
and  customer-oriented  selling  on  sales  performance. They 
found that salespeople who are better able to appraise their 
customers’ emotions are more effective when using adaptive 
selling and customer-oriented selling behaviors. Research by 
Verbeke et al. (2008a) indicates that when a salesperson pos-
sesses both high cognitive ability and high social competence 
(similar to EI), this combination leads to the highest level of 
sales performance. By recognizing his or her own emotions 
and those of others’ (his or her client), using emotion and 
regulating his or her emotional response, the salesperson with 
high EI should create more positive exchanges with his or her 
customers,  leading  to  higher  levels  of  performance  (Rozell, 
Pettijohn,  and  Parker  2006;  Sy, Tram,  and  O’Hara  2006; 
Wong and Law 2002). Based on the preceding discussion, we 
propose the follow hypothesis:

Hypothesis  2:  A  salesperson’s  emotional  intelligence  is 
positively  associated  with  his  or  her  job  satisfaction  and 
job performance.

creativity and Job outcomes

Some  studies  have  found  a  positive  relationship  between 
creativity and positive affect (Isen, Daubman, and Nowicki 
1987; Isen et al. 1985), as well as, specifically, job satisfac-


tion (Shalley, Gilson, and Blum 2000; Wang and Netemeyer 
2004). Job satisfaction was found to be higher where a work 
environment is in balance with the creativity requirements 
of the job (Shalley, Gilson, and Blum 2000) and with more 
creative salespeople (Wang and Netemeyer 2004). Surprisingly, 
Zhou and George (2001) found that, in some cases (when 
workers possessing a strong desire to remain in their current 
position perceived that coworker and organizational support 
and feedback for creativity was high), dissatisfaction lead to 
higher levels of creativity. That is, Zhou and George (2001) 
reason  that  dissatisfied  employees  who  desire  to  remain  at 
the company use coworker and organizational support and 
feedback to see problems from a different perspective. It also 
may increase their confidence that their creative ideas will be 
supported, leading to improvements on the job.

Developing new and improved ways of doing things is at 
the  core  of  creativity  (Zhou  and  George  2001).  Creativity 
in the workplace can mean that the sales force invents new 
methods or procedures to perform sales tasks or select prod-
ucts or services to better meet customer needs. Creative field 
members are able to adapt sales tasks that may cause frustra-
tion or annoyance in carrying out their job (Zhou and George 
2001). By making unique and useful adjustments to tasks and 
processes that enhance the positive aspects of the sales job, the 
salesperson is able to increase his or her job satisfaction.

Limited research has investigated the relationship between 
creativity  and  job  performance  (see  Gilson  2008).  Gong, 
Huang, and Farh (2009) found that creativity is positively 
related to insurance agents’ supervisors’ ratings of their perfor-
mance and sales performance measures. Wang and Netemeyer 
(2004) found that creativity was positively related to the self-
report performance of billboard-advertising account execu-
tives. Field members may also change existing processes to 
improve efficiency or find a creative solution that is more useful 
to close a sale. Likewise, these forms of workplace creativity 
should enable the sales force to improve their job performance 
(Gong, Huang, and Farh 2009; Wang and Netemeyer 2004; 
Zhou 1998; Zhou and Shalley 2003). Thus, we propose the 
following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3: A salesperson’s creativity is positively associated 
with his or her job satisfaction and job performance.

Our study population was a national group of independent 
sales representatives for a business-to-consumer company in 
the  health  and  beauty  industry. The  organization  is  in  the 
direct  selling  industry  and  uses  a  multilevel  compensation 
plan. The  products  sold  are  in  home,  health,  and  beauty

categories. Independent business leaders provided the sample 
of 933 field members. An e-mail invitation was sent to the 
independent sales representatives that included a link to the 
online  survey.  A  reminder  e-mail  was  sent  one  week  later. 
Five  hundred  and  forty-eight  field  members  clicked  the 
link, leading to 460 completed surveys. This result yielded a 
49.3 percent response rate of all those invited to participate 
in the study and an 83.9 percent response rate of those who 
clicked on the link to the online survey.

The majority of the sample were female (90.0 percent); 
white, non-Hispanic (91.2 percent), and were college educated 
(53.9 percent) (see Table 1). Overall, the respondents were well 
established in sales. The average respondent was 52.4 years old, 
had an average of 13.5 years of sales experience, and had been 
in sales as a field member for an average of 11.8 years. Given 
the large number of female respondents, a review of gender 
by the study’s key variables was conducted. Two differences 
were noted. While both were positive, females reported higher 
levels of self-emotional assessment (SEA) and other-emotional 
assessment (OEA) than male field members (SEA: females, 
μ = 4.45, males, μ = 4.24, p = 0.03; OEA: females, μ = 4.31, 
males, μ = 4.00, p = 0.00). This indicates that female field 
members  rated  themselves  higher  in  identifying  their  own 
and others’ emotions, consistent with Van Rooy et al.’s (2006) 
premise that women score higher on EI. No other differences 
were found by gender. The gender divide may also impact the 
field  members’  customers.  Given  the  assortment  of  home, 
health, and beauty product lines, the respondents’ customers 
could be males or females. We would expect customers for the 
beauty line would be more heavily skewed to females; however,

we did not collect the gender of the field member’s custom-

in the Limitations and Future Research Suggestions section. 
Comparisons of the length of time as a field member by EI 
and creativity were also explored. No differences were found 
to indicate length of time as a field member was significantly 
related to either construct.

measures

EI was measured with the Wong and Law emotional intel-
ligence  scale  (WLEIS)  (Wong  and  Law  2002). This  scale 
measures four dimensions of EI related to the four-branch 
model:  self-emotional  assessment  (SEA),  other-emotional 
assessment (OEA), understanding of others’ emotions (UOE), 
and  regulation  of  others’  emotions  (ROE).  SEA  and  OEA 
embody accurately perceiving emotion. UOE taps use and 
understanding of emotion, while ROE focuses on managing 
emotion.  Libbrecht,  Lievens,  and  Schollaert  (2010)  report 
that the WLEIS “is consistent with the theoretical rationale 
underlying [it] and has received the most empirical support 
in prior research” (2010, p. 1011; see also Law, Wong, and 
Song 2004; Shi and Wang 2007; Wong and Law 2002). This 
self-report  scale  has  been  shown  to  support  its  four-factor 
structure, to have high reliability and convergent and discrimi-
nant validity (Joseph and Newman 2010a; Law et al. 2008; 
Shi and Wang 2007; Wong and Law 2002), and to have the 
validity to predict job satisfaction and job performance (Law 
et al. 2008; Song et al. 2010; Wong and Law 2002).

Creativity was measured using the 13-item scale developed 
by Zhou and George (2001) and used in the Rego et al. (2007) 
study of EI and creativity of top and middle management. 
Consistent with the Amabile (1988) view of creativity, the 

Zhou and George (2001) scale measures creativity as a two-
dimensional construct consisting of new (or novel) and useful 
ideas. Rego et al. (2007) described “useful ideas” as ones where 
workers are the source of “suggesting” or “coming up with” 
creative ideas to improve quality, performance, and meet goals. 
An example of a useful idea item is “I come up with new and 
practical ideas to improve performance.” Conversely, new or 
novel ideas do not necessarily need to be useful in meeting a 
specific goal. An example of a creative idea item is “I exhibit 
creativity on the job when given the opportunity to.” Thus, 
in keeping with the Amabile (1988) view of creativity, highly 
creative ideas are high on both novelty and usefulness.

Job  satisfaction  was  measured  using  the  four  overall-
satisfaction-with-the-job items of the reduced version of the 
seven-dimension job satisfaction scale (Comer, Machleit, and 
Lagace  1989).  Job  performance  was  measured  with  items 
developed by Behrman and Perrault (1982) and Cravens et 
al.  (1993)  and  more  recently  used  in  Piercy,  Cravens,  and 
Lane (2009). Five items measured behavior performance. A 
representative item is “Building effective relationships with 
customers.” Four items measured outcome performance with 
a representative item being, “Achieving annual sales targets 
and other objectives.”

rEsults

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between EI, creativity, and job outcomes. Prior to conducting 
structural equation modeling (SEM), the scales were analyzed 
for unidimensionality. All of the scales produced appropriate 
Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliabilities and none of the 
item-to-total  correlations  or  squared  multiple  correlations 
indicated that any of the scale items should be deleted. The 
reliability estimates for all the constructs exceed 0.70, provid-
ing evidence of internal consistency (Fornell and Larcker 1981; 
Nunnally 1978) and adequate fit (Bagozzi and Yi 1988). The 
results and correlation matrix are presented in Tables 2 and 3, 
respectively.

SEM  was  conducted  to  examine  the  proposed  model’s 
fit. The results indicated good fit and covariance in the data 
(χ2 = 69.66, p = 0.003, goodness-of-fit index [GFI] = 0.98, 
adjusted goodness-of-fit index [AGFI] = 0.95, normed fit index 
[NFI] = 0.98, root mean square residual [RMSR] = 0.028, 
root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.039). 
Standardized path coefficients are shown in Table 4. A confi-
dence interval test was conducted to assess the discriminant 
validity of the model’s constructs. The test provides evidence of 
discriminant validity since none of the 95 percent confidence 
intervals  of  the  factor  correlations  included  1  (Fornell  and 
Larcker 1981). Given that self-reported measures were used 
in this study, Harmon’s confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) 
method was used to test for common method variance (CMV).

The one-factor model yielded a χ2 of 1,068.54 (df [degrees of 
freedom] = 47), whereas χ2 = 69.66 (df = 41) for the proposed 
model. Differences between the key indicators confirmed that 
the one-factor model provides a significantly poorer fit than 
the proposed model does (∆χ2 = 998.88, ∆df = 6 versus critical 
χ2 = 12.59, α = 0.05). These results suggest that CMV is not a 
danger to the findings of this study (Podsakoff et al. 2003).

All  three  hypotheses  were  supported  in  the  model  (see 
Table 4). The results show that a field member’s EI is posi-
tively related to his or her creativity (H1: γ = 0.42, t = 4.76), 
job satisfaction (H2: γ = 0.42, t = 4.76), and job performance 
(H2: γ = 0.42, t = 4.76), supporting H1 and H2. As hypoth-
esized, creativity is also found to be positively related to job 
satisfaction (H3: β = 0.19, t = 3.67) and job performance 
(H3: β = 0.48, t = 8.90). These results support H3. Taken 
together, this study identifies EI and creativity as important 
influences on critical sales work outcomes (job satisfaction 
and job performance) and a field member’s EI is also shown 
to impact his or her creativity.

discussion

While the primary focus of this research was creativity in the 
sales position, important insights were also gleaned into EI 
and sales. Notably, we found a positive relationship between EI 
and two important outcomes that should be important to any 
sales business leader—job satisfaction and job performance. 
While others (Lopes et al. 2006; Sy, Tram, and O’Hara 2006; 
Wong  and  Law  2002)  have  already  observed  this  positive 
relationship, the current study adds to the growing body of 
evidence supporting the important role that EI can play in 
these outcomes, which are critical to the success of any organi-

zation. Importantly, this research extends the previous body of 
knowledge concerning EI in sales by demonstrating a positive 
relationship between EI and creativity in the sales position. 
Further, this research also identifies a link between creativity 
and job satisfaction and job performance. These are results that 
should certainly capture the attention of management.

managerial implications

The fact that this research provides evidence supporting the 
positive link between EI and job satisfaction and job perfor-
mance in the sales position has important implications for 
management. Essentially, management should note that, all 
things  being  equal,  sales  field  members  high  in  EI  should 
tend  to  be  more  satisfied  with  their  jobs  and  have  higher 
performance  levels.  Obviously,  those  are  outcomes  worthy 
of managerial emphasis. Given these important findings, it 
behooves management to attempt to foster higher EI in the 
existing sales force and to screen for candidates with higher lev-
els of EI in the recruiting process. Previous research (Kidwell, 
McFarland, and Avila 2007) has recommended that managers 
should consider sales training that emphasizes the four aspects 
of EI: appraising one’s own emotions, appraising others’ emo-
tions, using emotions, and regulating one’s emotions. Research 
has shown that EI can be learned and one’s EI abilities can 
be improved (see Brackett and Katulak 2007; Chang 2006). 
Sales business leaders can assess their field members’ EI levels 
and use the assessment to identify training and development 
programs (Rozell, Pettijohn, and Parker 2006). Training could 
be developed in house, or a business could hire a certified EI 
trainer to conduct workshops or work individually with field 
members. By understanding their strengths and weaknesses in

regard to EI, field members can invest in working on activities 
to enhance skills that need improvement.

We suggest that these same principles be extended to sales 
recruitment. The results of this study support the use of EI as 
a criteria in recruiting field members (Kidwell, McFarland, 
and Avila 2007; Rozell, Pettijohn, and Parker 2004, 2006). 
By using an EI assessment as one screening tool, team lead-
ers  can  select  sales  candidates  with  higher  EI,  potentially 
influencing the field members’ potential contributions to the 

sales organization. Using EI measurement as a selection tool, 
a company can determine the acceptable range of each EI abil-
ity to identify sales candidates for the recruiting pool (Rozell, 
Pettijohn, and Parker 2006). Importantly, hiring a sales team 
with higher levels of EI could reduce EI training costs for these 
individuals (Kidwell, McFarland, and Avila 2007).

Creativity was the central focus of this research, and the 
results have several important implications for management. 
Clearly, field members who can provide innovative and use-


ful  solutions  to  customers  are  critical  to  an  organization’s 
success. The obvious implication is that creativity should be 
fostered in the sales force. In a marketplace where change is 
a  constant  (Chonko  and  Jones  2005),  field  members  who 
are creative not only increase their performance today but 
are likely able to adapt to changing conditions, leading to 
increased performance in the future. In this way, creativity not 
only benefits the individual salesperson but also contributes 
to the organization’s goals and its success.

One major managerial implication is that EI is an important 
asset in influencing field members to increase their creativity. 
Sales leaders should recognize that those field members who 
have greater EI abilities can be more creative. This observa-
tion gives even more credence to the previous suggestion of 
incorporating EI into selection and training programs.

As with the previous discussion of managerial implications 
of EI, we suggest that creativity be a sales training and selec-
tion component. Previous research has shown that creativity 
can be identified, measured (Wang and Netemeyer 2004), 
and trained (Burroughs et al. 2011; Makel 2009; Ogilvie and 
Simms 2008). Thus, as previously discussed concerning EI, 
the creativity of sales candidates should be assessed and the 
results of that assessment should be considered a selection 
criteria. Further, the creativity of the existing field should be 
assessed, and the results of that assessment should factor into 
the development of the sales training agenda.

Organizational issues can also affect the creativity of the 
sales force. For instance, the firms’ reliance on standardized 
sales approaches may enhance or deter creativity. Often, sales 
training and sales managers encourage the sales force to follow 
a standard set of organizational practices and routines. For 
example, in some sales situations, the sales force is expected 
to deliver a highly standardized sales “pitch” to every pros-
pect and situation they encounter. Such standardized sales 
approaches tend to severely limit salespeople’s use of novel 
sales approaches or techniques as they have been taught to 
continue to use the same sales approaches regardless of the 
sales situation.

A rigid, overly restrictive control system may also discour-
age field members from attempting novel new approaches to 
solving customer issues (Rego et al. 2007; Zhou and George 
2003). In other words, a sales representative that responds to 
changing customer demands and comes up with an innova-
tive way to meet a customer’s needs may be impeded by the 
organization’s control system. We are not suggesting that a 
business should minimize its control system; however, man-
agers should consider how the organization’s control system 
may restrict field member’s willingness and ability to adapt to 
changing customer demands and market conditions. Unless 
the control system is designed to allow a degree of failure, 
sales representatives will feel restricted to their safe harbor 
approaches of the “tried and true.”

theoretical implications

Although not the primary focus of this research, the relation-
ship between EI and job satisfaction and sales performance 
was  explored  in  this  research.  As  in  previous  research,  EI 
is  positively  related  to  sales  performance  (Goleman  1985; 
Kidwell, McFarland, and Avila 2007; Rozell, Pettijohn, and 
Parker 2006). Those field members who have greater EI had 
higher levels of sales performance. A field member’s EI was also 
shown to be positively related to his or her work satisfaction 
(Lopes et al. 2006; Sy, Tram, and O’Hara 2006; Wong and 
Law 2002). Thus, EI skills are important to the sales force by 
positively influencing critical work outcomes (job satisfaction 
and job performance).

While limited research investigating EI and creativity exists 
(Rego et al. 2007; Zhou and George 2003), this is the first 
study that examines this relationship with field members. The 
results show that field members with higher levels of EI can 
utilize their EI skills to develop novel and useful ideas to cre-
ate solutions in the sales position. Thus, sales representatives 
who can appraise and manage their own and others’ emotions 
are  more  likely  to  come  up  with  creative  ideas  and  useful 
solutions. One example is that salespeople may be able to use 
their EI to balance the emotions involved in creative activity. 
Certainly, stepping out of one’s routine can involve feelings of 
anxiety and uncertainty (Zhou and George 2003). Recogniz-
ing negative emotions associated with change and regulating 
them to make an appropriate decision may enable the sales 
field member to adapt a procedure to meet goals or improve 
performance at work. Thus, our results imply that one’s EI 
can help to regulate the affect involved in being creative on 
the job. Gaining a better understanding of how EI works to 
impact creativity offers potential for future research.

This  study  adds  to  the  preliminary  research  that  shows 
that creativity is positively related to job satisfaction and job 
performance. While not traditionally considered as “creative” 
work, the results illustrate that a sales force can create unique 
and useful results that can enhance their job satisfaction and 
job performance.

limitations and FuturE  
rEsEarch suggEstions

As  with  all  research,  this  study  has  some  limitations.  First, 
the  independent  sales  representatives  who  participated  in 
this study represent one company serving a nationwide U.S. 
marketplace.  Care  should  be  taken  in  generalizing  to  other 
industries, product categories, or markets. Second, participants 
in this study were primarily female. In fact, even within the 
same industry, variations in organizational culture could cer-
tainly affect the applicability of our results. Thus, exploring the 
relationship between EI and creativity in other sales situations

and populations should be considered a high research priority. 
Our research indicates gender differences in two aspects of EI. 
Recent studies have found no difference in self-ratings of EI by 
gender (Joseph and Newman 2010b; Taylor and Hood 2011), 
with one study reporting a difference in the WLEIS’s use-of-
emotion (UOE) scale, on which females rated themselves higher 
than men rated themselves (Whitman et al. 2009). In addition, 
Joseph and Newman (2010b) report that females score higher 
on performance-based EI measures. Further research should 
explore  gender  differences  and  gender’s  impact  on  the  field 
member–customer dyad and its impact on EI and creativity. 
Third, all the measures utilized in the current study were 
self-reported, including performance. For future research, we 
recommend that actual sales performance data be collected, if 
possible. Fourth, this study was based on initial studies that 
investigated the relationship between leader EI and field mem-
ber creativity. We recommend that future research investigate 
this relationship between EI and creativity using dyadic data 
between sales managers and their salespeople. This study could 
provide  additional  support  for  the  importance  of  the  sales 
manager to his or her sales team. Finally, some studies have 
shown that training can improve EI; however, these are limited 
to student settings (Brackett and Katuluk 2007; Chang 2006). 
We recommend that empirical research investigate whether sales 
training programs can achieve improvement in EI.

conclusion

This  study  has  shown  that  a  field  member’s  EI  can  foster 
creativity and important work outcomes (job satisfaction and 
job performance). A positive relationship was found between 
EI and creativity and EI and the work outcomes. Creativity 
was also found to be positively related to work satisfaction 
and performance. Given the ever-changing marketplace, this 
research on EI and creativity explores the selling abilities that 
help field members better meet the needs of their customers 
today  and  adapt  to  a  changing  marketplace  and  customer 
demands in the future.
