Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint inﬂuence of dependence and trust in
supply chain relationships on supply chain integration (SCI) and ﬁnancial performance.
Design/methodology/approach – This study develops a dependence-trust-SCI-performance model
and tests it using structural equation modeling based on empirical data collected from 617 manufacturers
in China.
Findings – The results show that trust with customers/suppliers signiﬁcantly inﬂuences SCI. Although
dependence on customers/suppliers has no direct effect on SCI, it improves SCI indirectly through trust
with customers/suppliers. Both supplier integration and customer integration signiﬁcantly improve
ﬁnancial performance.
Practical implications – This study suggests that manufacturers should manage dependence and
trust in supply chain relationships simultaneously to enable SCI. When there is high-level dependence
on customers/suppliers, manufacturers should invest resources to develop trust with those
customers/suppliers. Moreover, to achieve a better ﬁnancial performance, manufacturers should integrate
with both customers and suppliers.
Originality/value – This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence
regarding the direct effect of trust on SCI, and the indirect inﬂuence of dependence on SCI through
trust. This extends extant knowledge regarding the joint impact of dependence and trust on SCI.
Hence, both researchers and practitioners should pay attention to interdependence among different
relationship management practices. Moreover, this study also empirically supports the argument that
SCI improves ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management (SCM) is the systematic, strategic coordination of business
functions and ﬂows of materials, products, information and money within a particular
company and across the businesses in the supply chain (SC) to improve the long-term
performance of the SC as a whole (Mentzer, 2001; Naslund and Williamson, 2010).
Supply chain integration (SCI) has been advocated as a key to improve performance
and to create value in SCM (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Corsten and Felde, 2005;

information sharing,

Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2007; Krause et al., 2007). SCI includes both economic actions,
such as system alignment,
joint investments, and on-going
inter-organizational social relationships among exchange partners (Zhao et al., 2008;
Narasimhan et al., 2009; McCarthy-Byrne and Mentzer, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011).
Based on different theoretical lenses, including social capital theory (Krause et al., 2007;
Villena et al., 2011), resource-based view (Swink et al., 2007; Mahapatra et al., 2010),
resource dependency theory (Crook and Combs, 2007; Yeung et al., 2009), and
transaction cost theory (Wang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011), previous studies found
that relational capital and assets, such as trust, power, relationship commitment, and
dependence, play crucial roles in achieving SCI goals and competitive advantages.

SC relationships are characterized by structural

interdependence and an
asymmetrical distribution of resources, which creates dependence among members
(Crook and Combs, 2007; McCarter and Northcraft, 2007). Dependence refers to the
reliance of one party on the actions of another party to achieve certain goals or
gratiﬁcation (Emerson, 1962). It reﬂects the bargaining power and relationship
importance among partners (Mahapatra et al., 2010). Moreover, it is rare to have equal
dependence in a relationship (Golicic, 2007; Yeung et al., 2007). High-level dependence
might lead to uncertainties and opportunistic behaviors, resulting in conﬂicts that
negatively affect overall collaboration and performance (Corsten and Felde, 2005;
Ireland and Webb, 2007). To balance dependence among partners, ﬁrms need to
develop relational capital through socialization processes (Petersen et al., 2008;
Yeung et al., 2009; Mahapatra et al., 2010). Trust refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm
believes that its exchange partners are honest and/or benevolent (Geyskens et al.,
1998). It reﬂects the willingness and conﬁdence to rely on other parties (Moorman et al.,
1993). As an important form of relational capital, trust is critical for mitigating
exchange hazards and engendering cooperation among SC partners because it reduces
the uncertainty of partners’ actions and opportunism (Yeung et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2011). Trust and dependence exist simultaneously in SC relationships and inﬂuence
integration in different ways (Ireland and Webb, 2007; Krause et al., 2007).
Hence, understanding the independent and joint inﬂuences of dependence and trust on
SCI could help practitioners to efﬁciently and effectively establish and manage their
social ties. However, few empirical studies have simultaneously investigated the
impact of dependence and trust on SCI (Corsten and Felde, 2005; Yeh, 2005;
Laaksonen et al., 2008).

Researchers have argued that

there is lack of evidence (Fabbe-Costes and
Jahre, 2007) and inconsistent ﬁndings (Flynn et al., 2010) regarding the relationship
between SCI and performance. Hence, there is a need to empirically examine the
effects of SCI on ﬁnancial performance from the perspective of both customers and
suppliers (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008). This study aims to investigate the joint
inﬂuences of dependence and trust among SC partners on SCI and ﬁnancial
performance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst review the literature
related to dependence, trust and SCI, and then derive research hypotheses, followed by
a description of the methodology and the results of the empirical analyses. The key
ﬁndings and their implications are discussed in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 concludes
the study and outlines its limitations and future research directions.

2. Literature review and research hypotheses
2.1 Dependence
Dependence in SCM can be deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s need to maintain its business relationships
with SC partners to achieve its goals (Frazier, 1983; Narasimhan et al., 2009). The nature
of task interdependence determines that ﬁrms require resources from the environment to
survive and develop (McCarter and Northcraft, 2007). Because long-term cooperative
agreements can buffer ﬁrms from hostile environments, ﬁrms build SC relationships;
these also create dependence at the same time (Narasimhan et al., 2009). The ability of a
SC member to fulﬁll its partners’ goals as well as its need to acquire external resources
and to manage switching difﬁculties, consolidation in the market, and entry barriers
shape the dependence of the member and its partners (Crook and Combs, 2007; Handley
and Benton, 2012). Hence, SCs are characterized by different levels of dependence
between members, which in turn inﬂuences their operations (Yeung et al., 2007;
Petersen et al., 2008). Dependence in an inter-organizational relationship is critical to a
company’s success and is strategically emphasized by the company (Handley and
Benton, 2012). It indicates the extent to which the manufacturer’s goals are facilitated by
the SC partners’ appropriate actions. SC members usually know the value of the
resources they can offer and the dependence created by them. When one party is heavily
dependent upon another party, it will be locked into the relationship (Narasimhan et al.,
2009). Thus, stronger members might calculate others’ dependences and exert their
power during negotiations to gain advantage (Crook and Combs, 2007).

2.2 Trust
Trust in SCM can be deﬁned as the willingness to rely on a SC partner in whom the
ﬁrm has conﬁdence (Moorman et al., 1993; Sahay, 2003). It has been viewed as critical
relational capital that facilitates cooperative activities among SC partners (Nahapiet
and Ghoshal, 1998; Adler and Kwon, 2002; Yeung et al., 2009). Trust can be developed
by creating an atmosphere in which SC members willingly exceed the minimal
requirements of a relationship to increase the likelihood of success for the SC (Ireland
and Webb, 2007). Prior studies argued that trust is a useful lubricant to deal with social
dilemmas and a fundamental ingredient to maintain cooperation and to avoid conﬂicts
(McCarter and Northcraft, 2007; Yeung et al., 2009). Using the transaction cost theory, it
is argued that trust among SC partners can reduce opportunism and increase speciﬁc
asset investment (Corsten and Felde, 2005; Ireland and Webb, 2007; Wang et al., 2011).
If a manufacturer trusts a partner, it has conﬁdence in the partner based on the
expectation of cooperation, irrespective of its ability to monitor or control the partner’s
actions (Mayer et al., 1995). Hence, establishing trust has become a key method to
uphold long-term cooperative relationships among SC partners.

2.3 Supply chain integration
SCI is a multi-dimensional concept that can be deﬁned as:

[. . .] the degree to which an organization strategically collaborates with its SC partners and
manages intra- and inter-organization processes to achieve effective and efﬁcient ﬂows of
products, services,
information, money, and decisions, with the objective of providing
maximum value to its customers (Zhao et al., 2008, p. 374).

While some scholars examined SCI as a unidimensional construct (Rosenzweig et al.,
2004), others took a broader perspective and described it as internal integration

547

and external integration (Droge et al., 2004; Koufteros et al., 2005; Flynn et al., 2010;
Zhao et al., 2011).

Internal integration recognizes that different departments within a ﬁrm do not act
as functional silos but as part of an integrated process (Chen and Paulraj, 2004).
External integration emphasizes the importance of cooperation and collaboration with
customers and suppliers through various activities, such as strategic alliance,
information sharing, communication, process coordination, joint product development,
and working together (Swink et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2010). We focus speciﬁcally on
external integration because this study examines inter-organizational dependence
and trust with external SC partners. Some empirical studies have suggested that
supplier integration and customer integration play different roles in performance
improvement and capability development (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Swink et al.,
2007; Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008; Flynn et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011).
Therefore, lumping customer integration and supplier integration together might
bias the investigation into dependence, trust, SCI and performance. Hence, we divide
external integration into customer integration and supplier integration. The former
involves the core competency derived from critical customers through information
and knowledge exchange, and process coordination and synchronization, whereas
the latter involves that of critical suppliers, at the strategic, tactical, and operational
levels (Zhao et al., 2008).

The inﬂuences of

inter-organizational relationships on SCI have attracted
considerable attention. Conceptually, Ireland and Webb (2007) argued that a balance
of
trust and power offsets the uncertainties and risks associated with joint
entrepreneurship and learning within SCs. Empirically, using different models,
researchers have found that both trust and dependence play signiﬁcant roles in SCI.
For example, Corsten and Felde (2005) found that both trust and dependence moderate
the effects of supplier collaboration. Yeh (2005) discovered direct inﬂuences of
dependence and trust on SC cooperation. Based on a case study, Laaksonen et al. (2008)
argued that trust and dependence co-evolves in SC relationships, which inﬂuences SC
coordination. McCarthy-Byrne and Mentzer (2011)
found a signiﬁcant direct
relationship between supplier dependence and SCI. However, Petersen et al. (2008)
showed that dependence does not directly inﬂuence supplier integration; rather it has a
signiﬁcant effect on the socialization process, which leads to supplier integration. In the
Chinese context, Yeung et al. (2009) found that trust and power inﬂuence supplier
integration both individually and interactively. Cai et al. (2010) discovered that trust
not only directly inﬂuences information integration but also mediates the effect of
relationship importance. Previous studies have also revealed that there are different
conceptualizations and explanations regarding how dependence and trust jointly
inﬂuence SCI, which calls for further in-depth empirical investigation.

2.4 Research hypotheses
2.4.1 Relationships between dependence and SCI. According to the resource dependence
theory, once the network possesses critical resources for tackling environmental
uncertainties and dynamics, dependence emerges among SC partners (Pfeffer and
Salancik, 1978). The resource-based view indicates that external SC partners are very
important resources because ﬁrms should rely on both their internal and external
capabilities and knowledge to gain competitive advantage (Swink et al., 2007). When the

Proposed model

level of dependence is high, in which scarce and valuable resources are beyond the control
of focal organizations, arm-length SC relationships may fail. Implementing long-term
oriented SCI becomes a critical method for resource acquisition (Swink et al., 2007). Thus, if
a manufacturer is dependent on suppliers and/or customers, it will contribute high levels
of input and work more closely with the customers and/or suppliers to integrate them to
ensure stability in resource acquisition (Petersen et al., 2008; McCarthy-Byrne and
Mentzer, 2011). In contrast, if the dependence level is low, a manufacturer may not be
strategically tied to SC partners. Both the ﬁrm’s and its partners’ possible opportunistic
behaviors would harm future collaborations. The manufacturer might be less likely to
develop long-term oriented integration with its customers/suppliers. As a result, their
relationships are usually transactional and arm’s-length.

Enterprise networking arises as a substitute for institutional privileges for
resources acquisition and competence development. The loose SC relationship may
cause problems because there are critical interdependences among SC partners that are
beyond the control of focal organizations (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). More important,
in the SCM context, if a company is dependent on its partners, then the company needs
help from those partners to achieve its strategic goal and to improve performance, and
it will be difﬁcult for the company to switch to other suppliers (Narasimhan et al., 2009;
Handley and Benton, 2012). Thus, dependence pushes companies to integrate with its
SC partners. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses (Figure 1):

H1. Dependence on customers is positively related to customer integration.

H2. Dependence on suppliers is positively related to supplier integration.

(Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Krause et al., 2007). Morgan and
Hunt (1994) empirically validated the hypothesis that trust engenders cooperation.
Furthermore, Handﬁeld and Bechtel (2002) showed that trust signiﬁcantly contributes to
the long-term stability of a SC and Beth et al. (2003) advocated that trust is placed as a
highest priority in achieving SCI. According to the social capital theory, trust provides
manufacturers the opportunities to access broader sources of information, improve
information quality, relevance and timeliness, and reduce costs and barriers for
information acquisition (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Adler and Kwon, 2002). A high level
of trust between partners enables them to access and share SC resources more efﬁciently
and effectively (Adler and Kwon, 2002). In this way, SC members can acquire external
assets and resources (such as channel access, information regarding pipeline stock and the
quality of suppliers, ﬁnancial capacity, and proprietary technology) from the environment
more quickly and easily, which is essential for coordination and cooperation among SC
partners (Swink et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008). Hence, trust with customers/suppliers tends
to increase the length and depth of integrative relationships (Krause et al., 2007).

Transaction cost theory indicates that trust with customers/suppliers reduces
opportunism and uncertainties, and increases the investment of speciﬁc assets, which
guarantee that the transactions will achieve expected goals (Ireland and Webb, 2007;
Yeung et al., 2009). When a company trusts the goodwill of its SC partner, the company
believes that the partner will not take advantage of it in the transactions and hence is
more likely to work with and rely on the partner for its SC activities (Wang et al., 2011).
Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:

H3. Trust with customers is positively related to customer integration.

H4. Trust with suppliers is positively related to supplier integration.

2.4.3 Relationships between dependence and trust. Dependence among the parties has
been viewed as a key factor in predicting the level of trust in SCs (McCarter and
Northcraft, 2007). According to transaction cost theory, if dependence is high but
manufacturers do not invest to build trust with their SC partners, the partners are more
likely to develop opportunistic relationships (Laaksonen et al., 2008). As dependence
between SC partners increases and becomes more complex, a manufacturer is
stimulated to invest in the relationship to deal with uncertainties and opportunism
(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). In inter-organizational relationship development, trust
comes from one party’s perception of the other’s devotion to the relationship. As
transaction-speciﬁc investments cannot be easily redeployed, ﬁrms’ investments in
speciﬁc assets provide evidence of their trust, not opportunism (Wang et al., 2011).

Trust also provides a possible method to tackle the negative effects of dependence
(McCarter and Northcraft, 2007). When a company is dependent on its SC partner,
the company may want to develop a reciprocal trust relationship to reduce the risk that
a powerful partner might take advantage of its dependence (Zhao et al., 2008).
Hence, dependence can create mutual trust (Ketchen and Hult, 2007). Therefore, we
propose the following hypotheses:

H5. Dependence on customers is positively related to trust with customers.

H6. Dependence on suppliers is positively related to trust with suppliers.

2.4.4 Relationships between SCI and ﬁnancial performance. Previous literature has
linked SCI to different types of performance (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008; Flynn et al.,
2010), especially ﬁnancial performance (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan
and Kim, 2002; Droge et al., 2004; Rosenzweig et al., 2004; Koufteros et al., 2005;
Swink et al., 2007). From the perspective of the resource-based view, SCI can help a ﬁrm
to acquire valuable information and resources from partners, which lead to a better
ﬁnancial performance (Swink et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2010).

Close interactions between customers and manufacturers offer opportunities to
develop mutual forbearance and to improve information accuracy and process
effectiveness (Flynn et al., 2010). More accurate information about customer demands
and preferences, as well as frequent information updating, can speed up the product
design process, improve production planning, reduce inventory obsolescence, and
ensure that the manufacturer is more efﬁcient and responsive to its customers’ needs
and, thus, gains a higher market share (Swink et al., 2007). Supplier integration also
facilitates the mutual exchange of information, which improves the understanding and
anticipation of the manufacturer’s needs (Flynn et al., 2010). Strategic supplier
partnerships improve the manufacturers’ capabilities on cost, quality, ﬂexibility, and
delivery through the design coordination of the product and process, and joint
production planning and scheduling (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). Customer/supplier
integration also generates remarkable opportunities to leverage the intelligence
embedded in collaborative process management, thus enabling manufacturers to
improve efﬁciency, create value for customers, and detect critical demand changes
quickly to design and execute optimal responses, all of which improve overall ﬁnancial
performance (Zhao et al., 2008). Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:

H7. Customer integration is positively related to ﬁnancial performance.

H8. Supplier integration is positively related to ﬁnancial performance.

3. Research methodology
3.1 Questionnaire design
The survey instruments included questions on the demographic proﬁle of the company,
ﬁnancial performance, SCI, trust, and dependence. We used two major dyadic
relationships (manufacturer-major supplier, and manufacturer-major customer) to
represent the trust and dependence of a manufacturer in the SC. Dollar value
contribution was used to identify the major customers and suppliers. Trust with
customers and trust with suppliers were measured using two items each to score the
overall level of goodwill among SC partners. The scales adopted in this study were used
by Morgan and Hunt (1994). Dependence on customers and dependence on suppliers
were measured using four items. These items, which indicate the dependence speciﬁed
between customers and manufacturers and between suppliers and manufacturers,
were modiﬁed from those used by Johnson (1999), which show dependence between
suppliers and buyers. Customer integration and supplier integration were measured
using 11 items. They were largely adopted from the items used by Narasimhan and Kim
(2002), Chen et al. (2004), Cousins and Menguc (2006) and Frohlich and Westbrook (2001).
Similar to the items used by Narasimhan and Kim (2002), most of the items for customer
integration and supplier integration are similar (although some are different), indicating
that
these two constructs are correlated (but different) as two dimensions of


external integration. Financial performance evaluates a ﬁrm’s proﬁtability and market
growth, and the measures were adapted from Narasimhan and Kim (2002), Vickery et al.
(2003) and Frohlich and Westbrook (2001). All
indicators were measured on a
seven-point Likert scale and are listed in the Appendix. Before the full-scale study was
launched, there was a pilot test of the questionnaire using a sample of 15 companies.

3.2 Sampling and data collection
Because of China’s size and economic diversity, we strategically chose ﬁve major
representative cities in China (Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong)
to conduct the survey in 2004. Chongqing is in the early stages of economic reform and
market formation, while Tianjin reﬂects a mid-stage level. Guangzhou and Shanghai
have enjoyed a high degree of economic reform and marketization, and Hong Kong is
one of the freest economies in the world. Although most Hong Kong companies house
their manufacturing operations in mainland China, they use Hong Kong as the hub from
which to control and direct the ﬂows of materials, ﬁnished goods, information, logistics,
and money. The sampling frame consisted of the Yellow Pages of China Telecom in each
of the four cities in mainland China, and the Directory of the Chinese Manufacturers
Association in Hong Kong.

While some studies have demonstrated the beneﬁts of using multiple informants
(Bruggen et al., 2002), the single respondent method is still widely used to investigate
relationship management between companies (Hewett and Bearden, 2001). After the
pilot test of the questionnaire, it was established that the best method was to use one key
informant from each company who was knowledgeable in SCM, and familiar with
purchasing and distribution processes and customer and supplier relationship
management. Such key informants included SC managers, CEO, presidents, senior
executives, vice presidents, senior directors, and senior managers. A single respondent
was carefully selected from each company and was deemed to be the best person for the
survey. This method greatly reduced the costs and time for such a large-scale survey.
Selected companies were contacted by telephone to identify the name and contact
information of the most suitable informants. The best-suited informant was then sent the
questionnaire, along with a cover letter highlighting the objectives of the research and its
potential contributions. Follow-up telephone calls were made to improve the response
rate, and the respondents were contacted to clarify any missing data in their responses.
With the help of a professional marketing survey company and several student helpers,
we conducted a large-scale data collection. Of the 4,569 companies contacted, a total
of 1,356 questionnaires were distributed, and 617 usable samples were collected. The
response rate was 13.5 percent based on the number of companies contacted via telephone
calls and 45.5 percent based on the number of questionnaires distributed. The proﬁles of
the responding companies are presented in Table I.

To assess non-response bias, we compared early and late responses on their physical
assets, annual sales, and number of employees (Armstrong and Overton, 1977); a t-test
showed no signiﬁcant differences. This indicates that the respondents who submitted
their questionnaire after receiving the reminder letter are not signiﬁcantly different from
the earlier ones.

Harman’s one-factor (or single-factor) test of common method bias was performed
on the variables of dependence on customers/suppliers, trust with customers/suppliers,
customer/supplier integration, and ﬁnancial performance (Podsakoff et al., 2003).

The results show that several distinct factors emerged among the variables; the ﬁrst
factor did not account for the majority of the variance of the items. Moreover, the items
comprising the scales were not highly similar in content; the constructs were measured
for items two to 11 and the respondents were familiar with the constructs. Hence, we
conclude that common method variance bias was not an issue in this study.

3.3 Reliability and validity
The descriptive statistics of the constructs are shown in Table II. Exploratory factor
analysis was used to assess the unidimensionality of the scales. The results reveal that
all items have strong loadings on the construct that they are intended to measure and
much lower loadings on the constructs that they are not intended to measure (Tables III
and IV), indicating construct unidimensionality. Cronbach’s a was used to evaluate
construct reliability. Table V shows that all values of Cronbach’s aare larger than 0.70,
which is the threshold value recommended by Flynn et al. (1990). Moreover, both
two-item constructs also have a high signiﬁcant correlation between two indicators.
Therefore, reliability is ensured for this study.

Factor analysis of
dependence and trust

We used conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess convergent and discriminant
validity using the LISREL 8.54 program. In the model, each item was linked to its
corresponding construct and the covariances among those constructs were freely
estimated. The model ﬁt indices are x2 ¼ 2,341.43 with degrees of freedom ¼ 677, root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ¼ 0.069, non-normed ﬁt
index
(NNFI) ¼ 0.96, and comparative ﬁt index (CFI) ¼ 0.96, which indicate that the model
is acceptable (Hu and Bentler, 1999). For the model, all of the factor loadings are greater
than 0.50 and the t-values are greater than 2.0. Therefore, convergent validity is
achieved. To assess discriminant validity, a constrained CFA model was used in which
the correlations among a pair of constructs were ﬁxed to 1.0. This model was
subsequently compared with the original unconstrained model, in which the correlations
among the constructs were freely estimated. A signiﬁcant difference in the x2 statistics
between the ﬁxed and unconstrained models indicates high discriminant validity
(O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998). In this study, 20 differences are signiﬁcant at the
0.01 level and one is signiﬁcant at 0.05 level. Thus, discriminant validity is ensured.

4. Analysis and results
In this study, structural equation modeling was used to estimate the relationships
among different constructs with LISREL 8.54 program based on a sample of 617
companies. The standardized coefﬁcients that are signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level are
shown in Figure 2. The goodness of ﬁt indices for the model are x2 ¼ 2,748.31 with
degrees of freedom ¼ 689, RMSEA ¼ 0.073, NNFI ¼ 0.95, and CFI ¼ 0.96. These
indices are better than the threshold values suggested by Hu and Bentler (1999).
As such, the model can be accepted, suggesting support for H3-H8 but not H1 and H2.
This indicates that dependence on customers/suppliers has a positive inﬂuence on
trust with customers/suppliers but does not directly improve customer/supplier
integration. Trust with customers has a positive inﬂuence on customer integration and

from dependence on customers/suppliers to trust with customers/suppliers and from
trust with customers/suppliers to customer/supplier integration; that is, the indirect
effect of customer integration is 0.56 *0.49 ¼ 0.27, and that of supplier integration is
0.49 *0.44 ¼ 0.22. Sobel’s Z-test was then applied to assess the signiﬁcance of these
indirect effects. The resultant Z-value for the indirect effect of customer integration is
Z ¼ 4.947, which is signiﬁcant at the p , 0.001 level, whereas that of supplier
integration is Z ¼ 5.268, and is also signiﬁcant at the p , 0.001 level. These results
indicate that dependence on customers/suppliers has a signiﬁcant indirect effect on
customer/supplier integration through trust with customers/suppliers.

5. Discussion
The results show that dependence is positively associated with trust, indicating that it
prompts a manufacturer to build trust with customers/suppliers. Generally, trust may
bring potential risks for the trustor because it could be exploited by the trustee
(Villena et al., 2011). Our study shows that when a trustee is dependent on a trustor, the
trustee should take risks to trust the trustor, because he/she can expect reciprocal favors in
the future. For example, ﬁrms that only have one or a few suppliers for key resources have
to develop trust with those suppliers as it is difﬁcult to switch to others. Hence, when a
manufacturer depends on its SC partners to pursue its company goals and deems the
relationships as strategic assets, it may be more likely to trust the partners. This ﬁnding is
also consistent with previous studies; for example, based on the transaction cost theory,
Handﬁeld and Bechtel (2002) proposed for ﬁrms to build close trust-based relationships,
they need to invest in site-speciﬁc assets and contracts according to dependence.

“Trust is found to be a signiﬁcant enabler for SCI, which is consistent with previous
studies” (Yeung et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2010). Manufacturers are likely to want to
integrate with a partner to share valuable resources or learn from that partner when
they believe that its SC partners possess valuable abilities, consider the manufacturers’


IJPDLM
43,7

556

beneﬁts, and would make sacriﬁces for the entire SC. Moreover, when a manufacturer
has an open-minded relationship with its honest SC partners, they can develop a
cooperative culture, facilitating SCI that helps them to solve problems together, reduce
conﬂicts, and share valuable information and other resources.

“Our ﬁndings indicate that trust is a mediator between dependence and SCI.” If a
company depends on its partner, it will invest to build a long-term relationship with the
partner to acquire resources and deal with uncertainties. Such an investment becomes a
speciﬁc asset that cannot be used in other relationships and will reduce the opportunistic
behaviors of the investor. In contrast, this speciﬁc asset increases the opportunism of
partners that do not invest in the relationships. Therefore, the investor needs to develop
trust with its partners to manage or control the potential opportunistic behaviors of the
partners. The investor may not integrate with the partners unless there is trust between
it and its partners. As a result, though dependence has no direct impact on SCI, it
signiﬁcantly inﬂuences SCI indirectly through trust. This reveals that trust and
dependence among partners needs to be managed simultaneously to achieve a fully
integrated SC (Ireland and Webb, 2007). Thus, the balance between trust and
dependence plays a critical role in offsetting the uncertainties and risks associated with
SCI (Petersen et al., 2008). Recently, researchers have noticed that SC relationships do
produce some negative effects. McCarter and Northcraft (2007) argued that SC alliances
represent a form of social dilemma that could lead to defections. Villena et al. (2011)
investigated the “dark side” of social capital and found that too much social capital can
hurt performance. Our study suggests that a key for tackling this “dark side” is to
understand the dynamics among the different kinds of relational capitals and apply
them to complementarities (Ireland and Webb, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Narasimhan et al.,
2009; Yeung et al., 2009).

6. Main implications
This study contributes to the literature by enriching extant knowledge on the enablers
of SCI from the perspective of inter-organizational relationships. Such results also
provide a foundation for researchers to explore how SCs can rely on the interactions and
synergies in relationship management practices to strategically adjust social relations,
to achieve the desired outcomes. It also ﬁlls in some of the gaps exposed in previous
studies. For example, Van der Vaart and Van Donk (2008 p. 48) stated that “less than
one-third of all
the papers reviewed examine both upstream and downstream
relationships of the focal company.” By simultaneously examining the supplier and
customer in terms of dependence, trust, integration, and performance, this study
extends the understanding of relationship management and SCI from the buyer-seller
dyad (Petersen et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) to the supplier-manufacturer-customer
triad. Moreover, taking into account the unique national culture of China, including high
power distance, collectivism, long-term orientation and Guanxi (relationship) networks,
the concept of inter-organizational relationships and the relationships among them may
be unique. For example, regarding the high power distance culture of China, dependence
may play a more important role in inﬂuencing trust than in a low power distance
culture. Regarding collectivism and a long-term orientation culture, dependence and
trust are more effective in improving integration than when concerned with
individualism and a short-term orientation culture. In Chinese Guanxi networks,
dependence, trust, and integration are all relational resources that can bring about

557

competitive advantages. Therefore, it is valuable to test western theories of dependence,
trust, and integration in a Chinese context.

Findings from this study also provide guidelines for executives to direct their
management actions towards achieving better ﬁnancial performance through SCI and
relationship management. Facing today’s ﬁerce competition, companies need to conduct
SCI to leverage external resources to gain sustainable competitive advantages. SCI, in
which information and knowledge are shared, joint planning is made, and problems are
solved together, can be risky as the “lock-in” is dangerous for SCs when dependence is
high. For example, if a major customer that is important for the company’s survival and
strategic goals, switches to another supplier (usually a competitor) to gain key materials,
the customer may leak the company’s knowhow (gained through integration) to the new
supplier. Therefore, this study indicates that a ﬁrm should build and maintain trust, which
is the major device to warrant relational exchange, with SC partners before it initiates SCI.
Firms should take a positive perspective on dependence and view it as an
opportunity to gain trust from SC partners and conduct SCI with them. Managers
should pay attention to the interactions and joint effects of dependence and trust, and
make resource investments to explore their synergies to tackle uncertainties and
opportunistic behaviors in the transaction. This study indicates that through good
relationship management with SC partners, SCI is more likely to occur and better
ﬁnancial performance can be achieved with both customer integration and supplier
integration. This means that integration with customers and suppliers can help
companies to achieve better sales, proﬁts, and market share, reﬂecting that companies
leveraging resources from customers and suppliers in the SC can gain competitive
advantages. Hence, managers should invest resources and efforts in SCI.

7. Conclusion
With the growing awareness of dependence, trust, and SCI over the past decade, it is
important to improve the understandings of these variables and their associated
relationships. This research contributes to this aim by developing and empirically testing
a dependence-trust-SCI-performance model based on a sample of 617 manufacturing ﬁrms
in China. This study shows that dependence on customers/suppliers positively inﬂuences
trust with customers/suppliers, which leads to SCI. It reveals that dependence on
customers/suppliers has positive indirect impacts on SCI through trust, though the direct
effects are insigniﬁcant. We also found that both customer integration and supplier
integration enhance ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performances.

This study has its limitations, which open up avenues for future research. First, it used
a cross-sectional design and the data was collected in 2004. As dependence, trust, and SCI
may develop over time, especially for a rapidly developing economy like China, it would be
useful for future research to examine these factors in a longitudinal study. Second, because
the data were only collected from manufacturers, future studies could extend our ﬁndings
by collecting data from multiple SC members, including suppliers, manufacturers, and
customers. Moreover, although this research provides some interesting ﬁndings regarding
the relationships among dependence, trust, SCI, and performance in China, we cannot
ascertain whether these relationships would be the same in other countries with different
cultures. Future research could examine cross-cultural differences. A further limitation
that should be mentioned is that we used dependence and trust as unidimensional
concepts in this study; future studies could investigate in detail the different dimensions


IJPDLM
43,7

558

of these two concepts and their impacts on SCI and performance. Furthermore, future
studies could explore how the general business conditions in which SCs are embedded
inﬂuence the impact of relationship management on SCI and performance. Last but not
least, we used perceived ﬁnancial performance measures. Future research could extend
this by adopting further items to measure different kinds of performance (e.g. operational
performance) in both subjective and objective ways.
