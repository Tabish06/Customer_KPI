This paper focuses on the interrelationships among the different dimensions of supply chain integration.
Speciﬁcally, it examines the relationship between employee commitment and supply chain integration
dimensions to explain several performance measures, such as ﬂexibility, delivery, quality, inventory and
customer satisfaction. Very little research has been conducted onto this topic, since employee
commitment is rarely included as an antecedent of the effect of supply chain integration on
performance. Seven research models have been analysed with Structural Equation Models using a
multiple-informant international sample of 266 mid-to-large-size manufacturing plants. The ﬁndings
suggest that the relationship between employee commitment and operational performance is fully
mediated by supply chain integration. Employee commitment contributes to improving internal
integration, and internal
integration affects performance both directly and indirectly. Moreover,
obtaining internal integration helps to achieve supplier and customer integration. As a result, companies
should strive to achieve both employee commitment and internal integration, as they mutually reinforce
each other. Similarly, managers should achieve internal integration before external integration and
include external integration at the strategic level in order to reap the greatest advantages from supply
chain integration. Meanwhile, managers should promote employee commitment not only for better
supply chain success, but also to mitigate the barriers of supply chain management implementation.

Introduction

Supply chain management (SCM) has strategic relevance because
increased competitive pressures have pushed many ﬁrms to turn their
supply chains into competitive weapons to enhance performance
(Fine, 1998). Effective SCM is a source of potentially sustainable
competitive advantage for organisations and supply chain integration
(SCI) plays a crucial role in this (Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008).

☆This article was selected from papers presented at the 4th World Conference on
Production and Operations Management (P&OM Amsterdam 2012), co-organized
by the European Operations Management Association (EurOMA), The Production
and Operations Management Society (POMS) and the Japanese Operations Manage-
ment and Strategy Association (JOMSA). The original paper has followed the

However, despite the potential beneﬁts of SCI, the effective integration
of value-added activities along the supply chain (SC) and the compe-
titive inﬂuence of SCI have been questioned. Thus, more empirical
research is needed in this topic (Leuschner et al., 2013).

Despite the fact that numerous studies have addressed SCI, it
can be seen that it is not a well-deﬁned concept (Fabbe-Costes and
Jahre, 2008). SCI does not have a single, accepted deﬁnition or
operationalisation (Pagell, 2004). SCI should consider the strategic,
tactical and operational levels. SCI could be deﬁned as the degree
to which SC members achieve collaborative inter- and intra-
organisational management on the strategic, tactical and opera-
tional levels of activities (and their corresponding physical and
information ﬂows) that, starting with raw materials suppliers, add
value to the product to satisfy the needs of the ﬁnal customer at
the lowest cost and the greatest speed (Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013b).
SCI needs both intra and inter-company integration across the
entire SC in order to work as a single entity (Alfalla-Luque and
Medina-Lopez, 2009). In consequence, SCI research should take
into account internal integration (INTI) and external integration

(EI) with supplier (SI) and customer (CI), as well as the external
integration orientation (EIO).

However, previous research has not always taken the different
dimensions of SCI into account (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008).
Droge et al. (2004) suggest that the joint use of EI and INTI has a
synergistic effect on ﬁrm performance. Other studies show that
one of the reasons that prevents a high level of EI being achieved is
a low level of INTI (Gimenez and Ventura, 2005). Moreover, INTI
seems to be the starting point for broader integration across the
SC. However, there is over emphasis on customer integration (CI)
and supplier integration (SI) alone, excluding the important
central link of INTI (Flynn et al., 2010). As stated by Zhao et al.
(2011), despite increasing research interest in SCI, we still have a
very limited understanding of what inﬂuences SCI and what the
relationships between INTI and EI are. This paper seeks to provide
empirical evidence on this relationship.

The prior literature is not unanimous in stating that the relation-
ship between SCI and performance is positive. Some papers conclude
that a higher level of SCI positively inﬂuences performance (Li et al.,
2009), but others have not been able to demonstrate this relationship
(Swink et al., 2007). So, additional research is necessary to test the
relationship between SCI (separated out into its various dimensions)
and performance. This relationship could be affected by the existence
of variables that act as antecedents. Some studies have found that SCI
has a mediating effect on performance (Vanichchinchai, 2012), but a
limited number of studies have been conducted in this respect. As a
result, determining the antecedents and performance consequences
of SCI is a key focus of recent SCM research (Droge et al., 2012).

The apparent inconsistency in the ﬁndings and doubt about the
relationship between SCI and performance suggest a missing vari-
able. Taking into account the literature, our interest lies in including
employee commitment (EC) as an antecedent in this relationship.
Previous research has analysed the effect as an antecedent of work-
force practices on performance for some operations management
(OM) practices, e.g. TQM, JIT and TPM (Cua et al., 2001) but little
research has been done on the effect of workforce practices in SCI, or
even in SCM in general (Fisher et al., 2010). However, Fawcett et al.
(2008) state that human nature is the primary barrier to successful
SC collaboration both internally and with external SC partners.

This paper therefore focuses on the relationships among the
different dimensions of SCI themselves, and on the relationship
between EC and the SCI dimensions to explain several performance
measures. It analyses EC as an antecedent of the effect of SCI on
performance. For this we use a multiple-informant international
sample originating from the third round of the High Performance
Manufacturing (HPM) project. Fig. 1 shows the research framework.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 establishes the
theories supporting the research, analyses earlier studies and estab-
lishes the hypotheses, objectives and proposed model to be tested.
Section 3 describes the sample and the methodology employed. This
is followed by the results of the study. Finally, the discussion, main
conclusions, contributions, implications for practitioners and aca-
demics, limitations and future research are presented.

2. Theoretical background, research hypotheses and proposed
model

In this section, ﬁrstly an analysis is conducted of the theories
that support the research (Section 2.1). Next, the relationship
among performance, SCI and EC is analysed and seven sets of
hypotheses are established on the basis of a thorough literature
review. Section 2.2 focuses on the relationship between SCI and
performance. The ﬁrst set of hypotheses addresses whether inter-
nal integration is directly related to external integration (H1 and
H2). The second set of hypotheses covers the relationship between
customer and supplier integration and external integration orien-
tation (H3 and H4). The third set analyses whether SCI dimensions
are directly related to performance (H5 and H8). The fourth set
examines whether external
integration orientation acts as a
mediator in the relationship between customer/supplier integra-
tion and performance (H9 and H10) and whether external inte-
gration acts as a mediator in the relationship between internal
integration and performance (H10 and H11). Section 2.3 focuses on
the relationships among EC, SCI and performance. The ﬁfth set of
hypotheses addresses the question whether EC is directly related
to performance (H12). The sixth set covers the relationships
between EC and SCI dimensions (H13–H15). Finally, the seventh
set analyses the mediated effect of internal integration and SCI
(H16–H18). Section 2.4 describes the objective of the paper and
the proposed model.

2.1. Theories supporting the research

In this paper our primary theoretical focus is on the theoretical
framework of the value chain (Porter, 1986) and the resource-
based view (RBV) of the ﬁrm (Peteraf, 1993; Barney, 1991). These
are the two most commonly identiﬁed theories in SCM (Defee
et al., 2010) and workforce management research.

Porter (1986) demonstrated that competitive advantage does
not come about only with the efﬁciency with which any individual
company is managed, but with that of the value chain as a whole.
As such, the value that a company achieves will depend to a great
extent on the relationships it has with its customers and suppliers
(Porter, 1986), i.e. the degree of SCI. SCI is directly involved in the
value-adding processes required to achieve efﬁcient and effective
upstream and downstream ﬂows of products, services, decisions,
and information (Bowersox et al., 2000; Mentzer et al., 2001). An
analysis of a company's SC enables its capabilities to be identiﬁed
by determining the activities in which it has, or can have, a
competitive advantage, and the relationships that exist among
them. The company can then identify the activities it prefers to
carry out itself and those that would be better acquired externally.
Therefore, the organisation has to take a series of strategic
decisions based on the analysis of these business capabilities that
will affect SCM and SCI directly. SCI enables a company to excel at
speciﬁc value-added activities for which it possesses unique

advantages while relying on SC partners to provide the comple-
mentary capabilities it lacks (Dyer and Singh, 1998).

The resource-based view (RBV) considers ﬁrms as collections of
resources, some of which can be considered strategic resources
(Wernerfelt, 1984). The RBV argues that ﬁrms are able to generate
sustained competitive advantage by developing unique ﬁrm
resources and capabilities (Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993). Previous
research has recognised the relevancy of the RBV focus for SCM/
SCI (Olavarrieta and Ellinger, 1997; Leuschner et al., 2013) and for
workforce management (Schroeder et al., 2002; Samad, 2013).

Best-value supply chains reﬂect the assumption that unique
resources exist at the SC level, and that supply chains can be
inimitable competitive weapons (Ketchen and Hult, 2007). SCM
seeks
improved performance through the effective use of
resources and capabilities via the development of internal and
external linkages in order to create a seamlessly coordinated SC;
thus elevating inter-ﬁrm competition to inter-supply chain com-
petition (Barratt and Barratt, 2011). SCI can be seen as a strategic
resource that could result
in a competitive advantage and
improved ﬁrm performance (Barney, 2012). Fine (1998) considers
SCI as the ultimate core capability. SCI
involves restructuring
activities used to link and simplify processes to help ﬁrms allocate,
align, and utilise both internal and external resources (Chen et al.,
2009). INTI and EI can be complex and require unique capabilities
that may be difﬁcult or costly to implement (Barney, 2012).
Therefore, the relevancy of RBV to SCI becomes evident because
of the engagement of both internal and external resources (Chen
et al., 2009).Meanwhile, the workforce can emerge as a key
element for achieving competitive advantage in the SC from the
point-of-view of the RBV (Marin-Garcia et al., 2009; deSarbo et al.,
2007; Schroeder et al., 2002).

Theory suggests that trust-based relationships, common goals,
and system-based rewards are necessary conditions for successful
ﬁrms in the SC (Menon, 2012). Appropriate workforce practices
and a high degree of EC that help these objectives to be accom-
plished can be responsible for developing specialised forms of
human capital that can be difﬁcult to imitate and enable a
sustained competitive advantage to be achieved. According to
Becker and Huselid (1998), this human capital will result in
improved productivity and proﬁtability. Consequently, EC could
play a major role in achieving a sustained competitive advantage
in the context of an integrated SC.

2.2. Supply chain integration and performance

SCI has been a highly researched topic during the last 20 years
(Leuschner et al., 2013), but no consensus has been achieved on
how to measure SCI and operationalisation (Alfalla-Luque et al.,
2013a; Kim, 2013). Some authors examined SCI as a single
construct (Vickery et al., 2003; Sezen, 2008). However, SCI multi-
dimensional constructs have been developed due to the complex
nature of the concept (Gimenez and Ventura, 2005; Kim, 2009).
The most common approach used focuses on inter- and intra-
company integration (Flynn et al., 2010; Droge et al., 2012; Zhao
et al., 2013). An internal–external perspective is essential for
understanding the phenomenon (Chen et al., 2009). The key to
SCI is to develop uninterrupted links with upstream suppliers and
downstream customers along with total
functional
synergy (Flynn et al., 2010). INTI links internally performed work
into a seamless process to support customer requirements
(Bowersox et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2009). It is a process of inter-
departmental interaction and collaboration that brings depart-
ments together into a cohesive organisation (Kahn and Mentzer,
1996). It implies integration between functions or departments
within a single ﬁrm (Koufteros et al., 2010). EI should be achieved

cooperation with key suppliers in order to generate advantages,
such as a reduction in inventory or a decrease in supplier lead time
(Thun, 2010). CI deals with a better understanding of key custo-
mers' needs and with their considerations in the company's
business processes (Thun, 2010). SCI includes both upstream and
downstream players, while INTI provides the foundation for both
(Chen et al., 2009). In consequence, every SC could have a different
level of INTI, CI and SI (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001).

Several papers, including this research, analyse SCI using the
triple SCI scope – INTI, SI, and CI (Swink et al., 2007; Wong and
Boon-itt, 2008; Kim, 2009; Flynn et al., 2010). The literature
suggests that ﬁrms must achieve a relatively high degree of
collaboration between internal processes before initiating EI
(Fawcett and Magnan, 2002; Harrison and Van Hoek, 2005;
Cagliano et al., 2006). One of the major obstacles to fully inte-
grated materials and information ﬂows across the SC seems to be
the inadequacy of the individual ﬁrms'
internal management
systems (Mentzer, 2004). Coordination between functions is a
key factor for achieving intra-organisational integration (Fawcett
and Magnan, 2002). INTI is a prerequisite for EI with supplier and
customer (Vickery et al., 2003; Menon, 2012) and must be well-
established before companies integrate with external parties
(Handﬁeld and Nichols, 2002). Successful SCM presumes INTI
and EI to be in place, but neither is sufﬁcient in itself for having
a successful SC (Min, 2001). The lack of INTI becomes the biggest
obstacle to turning collaborative activities into operational efﬁ-
ciency (Baihaqi and Sohal, 2013). INTI has the potential to affect EI
(Kim, 2013; Germain and Iyer, 2006). A signiﬁcant positive
correlation between INTI and EI has been reported in previous
research (Gimenez and Ventura, 2005; Eng, 2006; Baihaqi and
Sohal, 2013). However, there is a need for more research in this
area to ascertain how INTI interacts with other types of integration
(Zhao et al., 2011; Kim, 2013; Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013a). The
following hypotheses have been proposed in the quest to provide
empirical evidence for these relationships:

H1. INTI is directly and positively related to SI;

H2. INTI is directly and positively related to CI.

The SCI focus frequently fails to consider its strategic nature
(Flynn et al., 2010). Firms need to view organisations as part of a
collaborative network (Menon, 2012) and to strategically collabo-
rate with their SC partners to achieve effective SCI (Flynn et al.,
2010). Partners should work together to jointly achieve greater
success
(efﬁciencies, ﬂexibility, and sustainable competitive
advantage) than can be attained in isolation (Nyaga et al., 2010).
Partnership management has been classiﬁed as a form of core
competency leading to competitive advantage (Miller and
Shamsie, 1996). Bearing this in mind, apart from the analysis of
INTI, SI and CI, our research also considers a strategy perspective,
the external integration orientation (EIO), which implies that the
ﬁrm believes in a collaborative orientation towards key suppliers
and customers (and not an adversarial relationship with them) as
a part of its company strategy. While strategy is different from
operations, integration between the two is critical (Porter, 1986;
Miles and Snow, 1978). While operational collaboration can only
lead to shop-ﬂoor beneﬁts, strategic collaboration should not only
afford shop-ﬂoor beneﬁts, but also strategic beneﬁts (Sanders,
2008). Strategic collaboration with supplier and customer is
considered to be one of the core capabilities that companies need
to remain viable in the current business environment (Bowersox
et al., 2000). Strategic collaborative relationships are expected to
provide greater beneﬁts than transaction-oriented relationships
(Whipple et al., 2010). Taking into account previous research, we

245

will analyse whether SI and CI are positively associated with EIO.
We propose the following hypotheses:

H3. SI is directly and positively related to EIO;

H4. CI is directly and positively related to EIO.

A wide range of different studies on SCI have been carried out,
many of them focusing on the relationship between SCI and
performance (e.g., Sezen, 2008; Kim, 2009; Thun, 2010; Zhao
et al., 2013). In general terms, some papers agree that the higher
the level of integration, the greater the potential beneﬁts (Frohlich
and Westbrook, 2001; Bagchi et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009). Other
studies have not always found a clear relationship between the
level of SCI and performance improvement (Hertz, 2001; Swink et
al., 2007). Therefore, results are not conclusive (Jin et al., 2013).
Detailed tables summarising the relationships between SCI and
performance in previous research can be found in, among others,
Table VII in Fabbe-Costes and Jahre (2008), Table 3 in Van der
Vaart and Van Donk (2008), Table 1 in Sofyalıoğlu and Öztürk
(2012), Table 1 in Jin et al. (2013) and Tables 1 and 2 in Kim (2013).
Two recent meta-analyses of SCI and performance have been
carried out by Leuschner et al. (2013) and Sofyalıoğlu and Öztürk
(2012) based on a sample of peer-reviewed journal articles (86 and 22,
respectively). Both studies have tested the hypothesis “SCI is positively
related to ﬁrm performance” taking into account four scopes of SCI (SI,
CI, EI and INTI) and different measures of performance. Table 1
summarises the results. The comparison of both meta-analyses
conﬁrms the lack of consensus in prior empirical research on how
SCI affects performance. There is, therefore, no consistency in the
ﬁndings on the relationship between SCI and performance. Perhaps

the lack of consensus could be attributed to the different SCI
deﬁnitions, dimensions and operationalisations used in each of the
studies and their different scopes (Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008;
Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013a; Jin et al., 2013). For example, studies that
aggregate SI and CI
in a single construct (EI) may be drawing
inaccurate conclusions (Flynn et al., 2010). The same may be true
when we analyse the performance measures grouped into a single
construct. In the same way, the performance measures tested are very
wide and also apply at different levels of analysis: team, project, plant,
and SC (Turkulainen and Ketokivi, 2012). Another reason could be that
SCI does not have the same impact on performance depending on the
country, industry, plant age, product complexity and plant size (Flynn
et al., 2010). For example, in some contexts it might be better to
negotiate for each purchase than have partnerships (in line with
Transaction Cost Economics). However, SCI is a key element for
improvement in sectors such as the car industry (Gimenez and
Ventura, 2003). In other words, as with RBV, SCI achieves sustainable
competitive advantages and improved performance if partners possess
unique complementary capabilities that can produce distinctive value
and the governance skills needed for effective integration (Jin et al.,
2013; Fawcett et al., 2007). Another factor that could create ambiguity
in the effect of SCI on performance is that the relationship could be
nuanced (Jin et al., 2013). For example, some authors have found that
various operational performance measures mediate the relationship
between SCI and ﬁnancial performance (Vickery et al., 2003; Allred
et al., 2011). Other papers conclude that there are variables that act as
antecedents and SCI has a mediating effect between these antecedents
and performance (Vanichchinchai and Igel, 2011; Vanichchinchai,
2012; Wu et al., 2014).

Sofyalıoğlu and Öztürk (2012) state that there are a few studies
in the literature that test the direct relationship between SCI and
performance, so they suggest more studies to test this relationship.
Leuschner et al. (2013) state the need for additional research to
make statements generalisable. We analyse this relationship in
response to this demand. Although there is no consensus, we
propose the following hypotheses in a positive sense1:

H6. SI is directly and positively related to performance;

H8. EIO is directly and positively related to performance.

Also, taking into account the possible existence of mediated
variables (Jin et al., 2013), we analyse, ﬁrstly, whether the
existence of EIO in a ﬁrm can act as a mediating variable between
either SI or CI and performance. We therefore propose the
following hypotheses:

H9. EIO acts as a mediator in the relationship between SI and
performance;

H10. EIO acts as a mediator in the relationship between CI and
performance.

Secondly, as already indicated, there are many prior studies
that state that having INTI is a prerequisite for attaining adequate
EI (Eng, 2006; Menon, 2012; Kim, 2013; Baihaqi and Sohal, 2013).
For this reason we propose to analyse INTI empirically as an
antecedent of EI, examining the mediating effect of EI (analysed
through the block formed of the SI/CI/EIO constructs) in the INTI-
performance relationship, with the following hypothesis:

H11. The SI/CI/EIO block acts as a mediator in the relationship
between INTI and performance.

2.3. Employee commitment, supply chain integration and
performance

EC is deﬁned as the degree to which a worker identiﬁes with
his/her ﬁrm and shares its goals and values (Fields, 2002; Meyer
et al., 1993; Mowday and Steers, 1979). Employees with high
commitment consider that their company is an organisation for
which it is worth working and which they are proud of working for
(Alfalla-Luque et al., 2012). As a result, they put all their efforts into
working well for the organisation, do so with greater autonomy,
develop core competencies more quickly and, moreover, tend to be
more accepting of any task given to them. The likelihood that the
ﬁrm will achieve better performance therefore rises (Kuo, 2013).

There is clear evidence of the mediating role of EC between
workforce management practices and ﬁrm performance in pre-
vious research in the area of human resources (Elorza et al., 2011;
Patterson et al., 2010). In other words, when the effects of work-
force management practices on performance are analysed without
including EC in the model, these effects are signiﬁcant and
positive. However, when the mediating variable is included, the
direct relationship between workforce management practices and
performance disappears, and only the relationship between work-
force management and EC and the relationship between EC and
performance remain signiﬁcant.

Recent models in the literature on workforce management
(Den Hartog et al., 2004; Elorza et al., 2011; Guest and Conway,
2011; Marin-Garcia, 2013) consider EC as the main mediating
construct for explaining operational performance and customer
satisfaction, both of which affect ﬁnancial performance (Table 2).
Table 2 synthesises the relationships identiﬁed in the prior
literature. The majority of these studies analyse performance
measures grouped into operational and ﬁnancial performances.
This paper has analysed each of the performance measures
(ﬂexibility, delivery, quality, inventory and customer satisfaction)
separately with the aim of providing more detailed empirical
evidence. Therefore, we propose that:

H12. EC is directly and positively related to performance.

Previous literature shows that workforce management is one of
the less studied topics in SCM/SCI (Giunipero et al., 2008; Pandey
et al., 2012; Fisher et al., 2010). This lack of research may perhaps
be due to the research emphasis being put on hard OM topics, such
as JIT, TQM or IT, so more empirical testing needs to be done (Shub
and Stonebraker, 2009). While the relationship between SCI and
performance has been widely analysed in the literature, we ﬁnd a
lack of research with respect to any possible antecedents of this

Table 2

Relationship

relationship (Jin et al., 2013). In other respects, the relationship
among workforce management, EC and performance has also been
studied widely in previous research. However, there are a few
studies that extend the model and connect the two lines of
research. Consequently, this paper seeks to make a contribution
to this line by studying EC as a possible antecedent of SCI.

Opportunities for competitive advantage increasingly lie in
managing people within and between ﬁrms in SC relationships
(Ketchen and Hult, 2007; Fawcett et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2010;
Pandey et al., 2012). In this regard, Mentzer et al. (2001) identify
commitment as one of the antecedents of SCM and Gundlach et al.
(1995) and Lambert et al. (1998) state that it is an important
ingredient for the successful implementation of SCM.

In the SCM literature the studies that address workforce
management usually focus on the inﬂuence that human resources
has on the relationships between the organisations that it com-
prises. Vanichchinchai (2012) states that most SCM frameworks,
such as the SCM frameworks proposed by the Global Supply Chain
Forum (GSCF), include business partner issues but almost totally
ignore the internal employee component. However, the successful
implementation of SCM requires integrating internal functions of
the ﬁrm and effectively linking them with the external operations
of its partner ﬁrms in the SC (Holmberg, 2000). When commit-
ment is encouraged within an individual ﬁrm it will lead that ﬁrm
to act cooperatively with other ﬁrms in implementing SCM (Mello
and Stank, 2005). Therefore, EC issues within the organisation
should be critical in achieving SCM excellence (Halldorsson et al.,
2008; Gowen and Tallon, 2003; Shub and Stonebraker, 2009).
Despite this, the inﬂuence of an organisation's EC on achieving SCI
is a less studied topic (Bayo-Moriones and Merino-Díaz, 2004). We
formulate the following hypotheses in order to provide empirical
evidence on the topic:

H13. EC is directly and positively related to INTI;

H14. EC is directly and positively related to SI;

H15. EC is directly and positively related to CI.

In other respects, as far as we know, only a few studies analyse
the relationships among EC, SCM/SCI and performance (Gowen
and Tallon, 2003; Vanichchinchai and Igel, 2011; Vanichchinchai,
2012). The conclusion of Vanichchinchai and Igel (2011) is that the
SCM practices mediate the effect of TQM on company perfor-
mance, and the explanation for this result is that the EC on which
TQM focuses is a critical foundation for SCM, as it facilitates INTI.
Gowen and Tallon (2003) concludes that EC is crucial for SCM
practices to succeed. EC makes a critical independent contribution

to the success of all of the SC practices. They also conclude that EC
mediates the adverse impact of SCM implementation barriers on
SCM success. Vanichchinchai (2012) found that employee involve-
ment does not only have a direct positive impact on relationships
with suppliers and customers (EI) and performance, but also an
indirect positive impact on performance through EI. Thus, he
found a mediating effect of EI
in the relationship between
employee involvement and performance.

In conclusion, a few prior studies that exist seem to identify a
possible mediating effect of SCI in the relationship between EC and
performance, as has been demonstrated in other OM practices (e.g.
TQM, JIT and TPM). As they analyse both SCI and performance
aggregated into a single construct they do not examine the
relationships between the SCI dimensions or with regard to the
various performance measures. In this study we have analysed the
SCI dimensions and the performance measures in disaggregation
in order to provide more detailed empirical evidence and thus
respond to the demand for greater research into EC as a possible
antecedent of SCI and performance identiﬁed in the literature. The
following hypotheses have been proposed in order to contribute to
progress in this line:

performance measure. This paper contributes to the prior litera-
ture by providing empirical evidence in the six analysis groups
(direct and indirect) by analysing the effects on the ﬁve perfor-
mance measures separately (in H5–H12 and H18).

3. Methodology

3.1. Sample

Our empirical analysis is based on the HPM project database,
the data for which was collected during the project's third round
in 266 mid-to-large-sized manufacturing plants (more than 100
employees) in three industries in 2005–2008 in nine countries
(Table 3). The unit of observation is the manufacturing plant.
A stratiﬁed sampling design (Forza, 2002) was used to obtain an
approximately equal number of plants for each industry–country
combination. All plants within a given country were from different
parent corporations. The average response rate was approximately
65%. Given the sample's characteristics, this research is framed in a
manufacturing context.

H17. INTI acts as a mediator in the relationship between EC
and CI;

H18. SCI acts as a mediator in the relationship between EC and
performance.

2.4. Objectives and proposed model

The general objective of this research is to analyse the relation-
ships between EC (as an antecedent) and SCI to explain several
performance measures. However, in the proposed model (Fig. 2)
we have established hypotheses focusing not only on the media-
tion relationships, but also on the direct relationships between
variables that need more research taking into account the previous
literature. We have therefore analysed the direct relationships
between: (1) the different dimensions of SCI, paying particular
attention to INTI, traditionally underestimated in previous studies
(H1–H4); (2) SCI dimensions and performance (H5–H8); (3) EC
and performance (H12); (4) EC and SCI dimensions (H13–H15). We
have also analysed the mediation relationships of: (5) EI between
INTI and performance (H9–H11); and (6) SCI dimensions between
EC and performance (H16–H18).

Five performance measures have been analysed separately:
ﬂexibility, delivery, quality, inventory and customer satisfaction.
The results have therefore been obtained individually for each

This research uses the HPM third round questionnaire. The
original survey items were based on a wide-ranging review of the
prior OM literature. A panel of experts reviewed the instruments
in order to ensure content validity and a pilot test was conducted
at several plants with pre-tests that had been analysed for
reliability, validity and internal consistency. The international
HPM research questionnaires were reviewed during the ﬁrst and
second rounds. The construction validity, internal consistency and
nomological validity therefore presented strong values in the
scales that were ﬁnally used (Schroeder and Flynn, 2001; Flynn
et al., 1995).

Each questionnaire in this research was tailored to the exper-
tise of the focal informant following the key informant method
(Bagozzi et al., 1991). The items used in the present research were
responded to by at least two different managers/workers (plant
accounting managers, direct labour, human resource managers,
inventory managers, process engineers, plant managers, quality
managers, supervisors) in the plant for information to be triangu-
lated. This gives a transversal
image of a plant so that key
informant bias can be avoided (Van Bruggen et al., 2002) while
simultaneously increasing the validity.

3.3. Operationalisation

The items concerning EC,

INTI, CI, SI, EOI and customer
satisfaction are measured on a 1–7 Likert scale asking informants
for their perception (1¼strongly disagree, 4¼neither agree nor
disagree, 7¼strongly agree). The items concerning operational
performance (delivery, ﬂexibility, inventory and quality) are mea-
sured on a 1–5 Likert scale asking key informants for their
perception of past performance compared to competitors
(1¼poor, low end of industry, 5¼superior). Table 4 shows the
items of each construct. For each item, plant-level data are
calculated as an average value of all the valid responses at the
company. All the constructs used are ﬁrst-order constructs.

3.4. Method of analysis

The HPM project data constitute a broad sample, which enables
the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to be used (Marin-Garcia
et al., 2013). The analyses have been done with the EQS programme

using the maximum verisimilitude parameter estimation method
(Bentler, 2002). Goodness of ﬁt will be evaluated with a robust
method to prevent departures from multivariate normality in the
data. The two-step modelling approach (Schumacker and Lomax,
1996) will be used to check the measurement model and the full
latent structural model. In all cases, an analysis will be carried out
on the psychometric properties of the construct measurement
models. This will verify each construct's goodness of ﬁt, the
signiﬁcance of the load on each of the items and that their
standardised values are greater than 0.6. Composite reliability and
Cronbach's Alpha will also be tested to ensure that they are over
0.7 and that the variance extracted is over 0.4 (Hair et al., 1995).
Discriminant validity will be tested using the conﬁdence interval for
correlations method (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988).

Apart from analysing direct relationships between constructs,
this paper also analyses possible mediating relationships. Media-
tion is one of several different relationships that can occur when a
third construct Z (called the mediator) is included in the analysis
between two other constructs (X-Y, where X is the independent
construct and Y the dependent construct) in such a way that X is
the cause of Z which, in turn, is the cause of Y. Mediation can be
full or partial.
In the case of full mediation the direct effect
between X and Y is no longer signiﬁcant when the mediating
variable (Z) is introduced. In partial mediation the direct effect
diminishes but does not disappear altogether and a direct effect
(X-Y) and an indirect effect (X-Z-Y) exist alongside each other
with the full effect being the sum of the direct and indirect effects.
An alternative situation to mediation may also occur: suppression.
In suppression the direct and indirect effects have opposite
arithmetic signs (Alto and Vallejo, 2011).

Three steps must be taken to test whether a construct acts as a
mediator between other constructs. The standardised loads and
their signiﬁcance must be calculated separately in each of these
three steps (Baron and Kenny, 1986). The ﬁrst step is to analyse the
relationship between X and Z. During the second step, the
relationship between X and Y is analysed. Lastly, X, Y and Z are
included in the model. For a mediating relationship to exist, the
following conditions must all be met simultaneously: a) in step 1,
X must have a signiﬁcant load in the direct path on Z; b) in step 2,
X must have direct effect on Y; c) in step 3, Z must have a
signiﬁcant load in the direct path on Y; and d) X's direct load on

2 The measurement model is also included in the analyses but for greater
clarity only the model's structure is shown. In model 5 each performance construct
has its own path (similar to models 4 and 6), but we have combined several paths
in a single line to make the ﬁgure clearer.

Y should be lower in step 3 than in step 2. In short, testing
mediation implies the prior analysis of the direct relationships
between the constructs, whereby all our hypotheses for both
mediation and direct relationships will be based on the signiﬁ-
cance of the paths of the analyses undertaken in these three steps.
We seek to verify several mediating blocks in our research. The
three steps proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) have been
followed for each of these three proposed mediating blocks. For
this we have established different models (Fig. 3). (1) The ﬁrst
block veriﬁes the possible mediation of EIO in the relationship
between SI or CI and the performance measures (H9 and H10). For
this analysis we shall use models 1, 2 and 3. Versions of model
2 and 3 were constructed and analysed separately for each of the
ﬁve performance constructs in order to prevent pivoting problems
in the SEM parameter estimation process. These models enable the
parameters required for testing hypotheses H3, H4, H6–H8 to be


250

estimated. (2) The second block, studies the possible joint media-
tion of all the EI dimensions in block 1 (SI/CI/EIO) between INTI
and the performance measures (H11). The use of models 1, 3 and
4 is proposed for this and these same models provide the data for
testing hypotheses H1, H2, H5. (3) The third block tests whether
INTI mediates in the relationship between EC and CI and SI (H16
and H17). For this we propose models 1, 5 and 7, which also enable
hypotheses H13, H14 and H15 to be tested. (4) The fourth and last
block enables us to test whether SCI (sequence established in
blocks 1, 2 and 3) acts as a mediator between EC and the
performance measures (H18). Models 4, 5 and 6 are used for this
fourth block and the results can be used to assess hypothesis H12.
Models 4, 5 and 6 in Fig. 3 include all the performance variables
simultaneously, but not integrated in a single construct. Model 5 is
a generalisation of model 3, but only includes the direct paths
among CI, SI and EOI and the performance measures that are
signiﬁcant or do not cause a net suppression effect.

4. Results

Table 5 summarises the descriptive statistics of the constructs
analysed. All of the correlations are positive, and most are
signiﬁcant and of moderate or low intensity. The high correlation
between CI and customer satisfaction stands out while, at the
other extreme, so does the absence of signiﬁcant correlation
between CI and inventory and quality, or between SI and ﬂexibility
and inventory. There is moderate to low correlation between the
performance variables (except in the case of
inventory and
customer satisfaction, which is not signiﬁcant).
The measurement model of all the constructs has adequate
goodness-of-ﬁt indices (normed Chi-squared o5; CFI40.90; IFI
40.90; MIFI 40.90; AGFI 40.90; GFI40.85; and RMSEAo0.08). In
addition (Table 4), all the factor loadings of the items associated with
the ﬁrst-order constructs are signiﬁcant with values of over 0.6 and
the Cronbach's Alpha and compound reliability are over 0.7 (except for

correlations includes one in its 95% conﬁdence interval.

Starting with the ﬁrst block explained in the methodology
section, models 1, 2 and 3 have been analysed in order to test
hypotheses H3, H4 and H6–H10. Table 6 summarises the analyses
for models 2 and 3. The results of model 1 can be seen in
Tables 7 and 9. All three models show good goodness-of-ﬁt. In
addition, all the estimated factor loadings are signiﬁcant. In other
respects, although the correlations between the constructs are all
positive (Table 5), some of the standardised loadings are negative
(Table 6). This is due to a negative net suppression effect which is
produced when the effects of the explanatory constructs reduce
the mediating constructs' variance of error rather than explaining
variation in performance directly (Darmawan and Keeves, 2006;
Howell, 2010).

The analysis of the ﬁrst mediation block (models 1, 2 and 3)
shows that the direct relationships between SI and EIO and
between CI and EIO are signiﬁcant, positive and with a path of
0.473 and 0.169, respectively (model 1, Table 9). This supports H3
and H4. Meanwhile, the direct relationships between SI or CI and
the performance measures are only signiﬁcant in the case of
customer satisfaction (model 2, Table 6) with values of 0.503 for
CI and 0.178 for SI. Therefore hypotheses H6 and H7 have only
been supported for customer satisfaction and not for operational
performance (ﬂexibility, delivery,
inventory and quality). With
respect to the relationship between EIO and performance, the
paths are signiﬁcant and positive for ﬂexibility, delivery, inventory
and quality, but negative for customer satisfaction (model 3,
Table 6). In this case, H8 is accepted for all the performance
measures except customer satisfaction. These results mean that
the mediation of EIO between SI or CI and the operational

performance measures can be considered. There is no mediation
with regard to customer satisfaction, and the relationship between
EIO and customer satisfaction sustains a negative net suppression
when the direct relationships of SI and CI with customer satisfac-
tion are included. As these direct relationships are signiﬁcant, we
shall only consider the direct relationship between SI and CI and
customer satisfaction in subsequent models. To conclude, hypoth-
eses H9 and H10 have been supported for operational performance
but not for customer satisfaction.

Similarly, the second mediation block tests hypotheses H1, H2,
H5 and H11 by analysing models 1, 3 and 4. The direct relation-
ships between INTI and SI or CI are signiﬁcant, with paths of 0.447
and 0.604, respectively (model 1, Table 9). This conﬁrms hypoth-
eses H1 and H2. Likewise, INTI has a direct and signiﬁcant effect on
all the performance measures. The value of the paths is 0.60 for
customer satisfaction, slightly over 0.40 for delivery, ﬂexibility and
quality and 0.30 for inventory (model 4, Table 8). Despite the fact
that model 4 presents a poor ﬁt (Table 7), all the estimated factor
loadings were signiﬁcant and the paths have values that are
consistent with those in model 3, which presents a good ﬁt. As
such, the data support H5.

If we compare the values of the direct effects of INTI on
performance with the constructs relative to EI (SI/CI/EIO) not
included in the model (model 4 in Table 8) with the direct effects
in the model with the mediation block (EI) included (model 3 in
Table 6), we see that there is partial mediation in ﬂexibility, quality
and customer satisfaction (the direct effects are reduced but they
continue to be signiﬁcant and, therefore, there is a direct effect
between INTI and these performance measures, and a separate
indirect effect through EI (SI/CI/EIO)). In other respects, mediation
is full in delivery and inventory. This conﬁrms H11.

For the third mediation block, which tests hypotheses H13–
H17, we shall use models 1, 5 and 7, which present ﬁt indices that
can be considered acceptable on the whole (Table 7). The direct
relationship between EC and INTI is signiﬁcant with a path of
0.636 (model 1, Table 9), which conﬁrms H13. Similarly, the direct
relationships between EC and CI or SI are signiﬁcant, with paths of
0.385 and 0.349, respectively (model 7, Table 9), which enables
hypotheses H14 and H15 to be conﬁrmed. If we compare the
values of the direct relationship between EC and CI or SI in model
5, which includes construct INTI as a mediator (0.017 and 0.153,
respectively, neither of which are signiﬁcant in Table 8), with those
of model 7 (Table 9), it can be observed that there is full mediation
of INTI, the presence of which in the model prevents the direct
relationship from being signiﬁcant when INTI is included as the

mediator. All this allows us to conﬁrm that EC explains INTI
directly and it is through INTI that it acts on the components of
EI. As a result, these data enable us to support H16 and H17.

Lastly, the fourth mediation block uses models 4, 5 and 6 to test
H12 and H18. EC presents a direct relationship with the perfor-
mance measures if no other construct is included in the model.
The path values are signiﬁcant, with values of 0.205 for delivery,
0.252 for inventory, 0.353 for ﬂexibility, 0.359 for quality, and
0.505 for customer satisfaction (model 6, Table 9). These data
conﬁrm H12 for all the performance measures.

In other respects, model 4 (Table 8) conﬁrmed the direct
relationship between EC and INTI and between INTI and the
performance measures. Comparing the direct
relationships
between EC and the performance measures when no other
constructs are included (model 6, Table 9) with the direct relation-
ships between EC and performance measures when the remaining
constructs are included (model 5, Table 8), it can be seen that SCI
(INTI/SI/CI/EIO) acts as a full mediator for EC in ﬂexibility, inven-
tory and quality, as when SCI is included in model 5 the signiﬁcant
paths are no longer signiﬁcant. This generates negative net
suppression for delivery (the direct relationship changes its
arithmetical sign and the direct effects of INTI and EIO increase
compared to model 3, Table 6). If we therefore eliminate this direct
relationship from the ﬁnal model it will be fully mediated. As far as
customer satisfaction is concerned, SCI produces partial mediation,
reducing the direct effect of EC on performance, but without
cancelling it out or making it non-signiﬁcant. For all these reasons
we can therefore consider that H18 has been conﬁrmed.

Given all the above results, the ﬁnal model was established on
the basis of model 5 and omitting all the non-signiﬁcant paths
(EC-ﬂexibility, EC-inventory, EC-quality, EC-CI, EC-SI,
INTI-inventory, INTI-quality, INTI-customer satisfaction) and
those that cause a negative net suppression effect (EC-delivery,
INTI-delivery). The ﬁnal model presents a similar ﬁt to model 5.
The standardised paths are shown in Table 10. These data enable
the direct and indirect effects of the different constructs on the
performance measures to be calculated (Table 11). The ﬁnal model
explains 37.6% of variance in delivery, 25.1% in ﬂexibility, 20.4% in
inventory, 27.0% in quality and 57.5% of variance in customer
satisfaction.

Table 11 summarises the effects of the constructs analysed.
Following Chin (1988), a 40.20 path can be considered strong (as
opposed to simply statistically signiﬁcant). In this case, there are
strong direct relationships between EIO and delivery, quality,
inventory and ﬂexibility. CI only shows strong direct effects on
customer satisfaction and does not appear to strongly affect the
other performance measures. However, SI presents a strong direct
effect on customer satisfaction and moderate indirect effects on

ﬂexibility and inventory; a strong indirect effect on delivery and
quality. Meanwhile, INTI presents strong direct and full effects on
ﬂexibility. Its indirect effects on the performance variables are
strong on customer satisfaction and moderate on delivery, inven-
tory and quality. EC has strong direct and indirect effects on
customer satisfaction and a moderate indirect effect on delivery
and ﬂexibility.

As can be seen in Table 12, the majority of the hypotheses
tested have been supported. The ﬁndings will be discussed in the
following section.

5. Discussion and conclusions

5.1. Research ﬁndings and the previous literature

The hypotheses H1–H4 have been supported. This implies that
the higher the level of INTI, the higher the levels of CI and SI.
In other respects, the existence of SI and CI helps the ﬁrm to believe
in EI's strategic importance (EIO) and this contributes to its future
strategies continuing to seek collaborative relationships with sup-
pliers and customers rather than adversarial relationships, in their
quest for generating processes with added value that enable them
to achieve sustainable competitive advantages (Porter, 1986). The
hypotheses tested provide new empirical evidence and respond to
the call for more research on this topic (Zhao et al., 2011; Kim, 2013;
Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013a). The results are in line with previous

empirical research that found a signiﬁcant positive correlation
between INTI and EI (Gimenez and Ventura, 2005; Koufteros
et al., 2005; Eng, 2006; Koufteros et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011;
Baihaqi and Sohal, 2013). INTI seems to be the starting point for
broader integration across the SC (Harrison and Van Hoek, 2005).
The direct and mediated effects of INTI and EI dimensions on
the performance measures have also been analysed. As explained
in Section 2, the previous literature is not in complete agreement
on this point. The ﬁndings of this research show that INTI has a
direct and signiﬁcant positive effect on all the performance
measures (H5). This result is consistent with several studies
(Droge et al., 2004; Stank et al., 2001; Germain and Iyer, 2006;
Flynn et al., 2010; Huo, 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013;
Danese et al., 2013).

The direct relationships between SI and CI and performance are
only signiﬁcant for customer satisfaction (H6 and H7). However,
the presence of EIO directly affects all the performance measures
except customer satisfaction (H8). EIO is therefore the element
that generates the organisation's strategic commitment to suppli-
ers and customers and enables “operational” efﬁciency to be
improved. This is consistent with Swink et al. (2007) when they
state that the simultaneous strategic integration of customers and
suppliers is considered to be a necessary condition for ensuring
the achievement of signiﬁcant beneﬁts. This seems to show the
importance of including the EI strategic vision with respect to both
customers and suppliers (EIO) achieving operational results com-
pared to either SI or CI individually. On the other hand, customer
satisfaction seems to be directly linked to the existence of SI or CI.
In line with the RBV, EIO can be considered one of the core
capabilities (Bowersox et al., 2000) that provide greater beneﬁts
than adversarial relationships (Whipple et al., 2010). Like the
present research, some studies found that CI did not have a
signiﬁcant direct effect on operational performance (Devaraj
et al., 2007; Danese and Romano, 2011; Danese and Romano,
2013) and that CI and SI had a positive effect on customer
satisfaction (signiﬁcantly higher for CI) (Zhao et al., 2013). Further-
more, there has also been support for SI not being directly related
to operational performance (Stank et al., 2001; Koufteros et al.,
2007; Song and Thieme, 2009, Flynn et al., 2010).

If we were only to take these direct relationships into account,
the above results would be the deﬁnitive ﬁndings, but, as we have
demonstrated, some of the relationships are mediated. As sug-
gested by Jin et al. (2013), a possible origin of the lack of consensus
on the relationships between SCI dimensions and performance is
that these relationships can be nuanced. Indeed, EIO acts as a
mediator in the relationship between SI or CI and the operational
performance measures, but not customer satisfaction (H9 and
H10).
is therefore the inclusion of EIO, considering both
suppliers and customers, what seems to generate an indirect effect
between SI or CI and the improvement in operational perfor-
mance. The full mediation of EI (SI/CI/EIO) between INTI and

delivery and inventory, and a partial mediation for ﬂexibility,
quality and customer satisfaction (H11) has also been conﬁrmed.
In consequence, EI channels the effect of INTI and allows improve-
ments to all the performances measures (with full or partial
mediation). In other words, there are two indirect paths between
INTI and all the performance measures (P), which goes through SI
(INTI-SI-EIO-P) and CI (INTI-CI-EIO-P) and, at the same
time there is also a direct effect on some performance measures
(customer satisfaction, ﬂexibility and quality). These ﬁndings seem
to show that INTI plays a direct role in achieving higher customer
satisfaction, higher ﬂexibility and better quality. However, the
importance of INTI's direct role recedes while EI gains in impor-
tance for explaining the improvement in delivery and inventory.
To put it another way, the initially identiﬁed INTI direct relation-
ship disappears when EI is included in the model, and EI acts with
the full mediation of delivery and inventory. The SCI dimensions
are therefore not independent of each other. These results are in
line with Gimenez and Ventura (2005), who found that EI
mediates the relationship between INTI and operational perfor-
mance measures.

However, the proposed model becomes even more complex
when we include the analysis of the inﬂuence that EC has as an
antecedent of the relationship between SCI and performance. This
paper conﬁrms the existence of the direct relationship between EC
and performance (H12) when no other constructs are identiﬁed as
possibly mediating in this relationship. This result is consistent
with the widely-accepted conclusions found in the literature
that determine that EC contributes to better operational perfor-
mance (Guest, 2001; Samad, 2013; Boselie et al., 2005; Paul and
Anantharaman, 2003; Young and Choi, 2011; Katou 2011; Brown

et al., 2011; Vanichchinchai, 2012) and customer satisfaction
(Moynihan et al., 2001; Nishii et al., 2008).

However, EC's inﬂuence on performance could be nuanced by
other factors in the company, such as SCI. Responding to the call
for knowledge of how this relationship is produced (Cua et al.
2001), SCI has been included as the mediator in the analysis. The
results show that EC has a direct effect on INTI (H13). Having a
committed workforce helps to achieve adequate INTI. Meanwhile,
EC's inﬂuence on SI and CI is conﬁrmed if the analysis of INTI is not
included (H14 and H15). This result is consistent with the prior
literature (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007; Vanichchinchai,
2012). However, when the way that these four aspects interact is
analysed in a more complex model, the full mediation of INTI in
the relationship between EC and SI
is
conﬁrmed, while the direct relationship disappears. This indicates
that the contribution of EC to greater SI and CI is due to the
existence of INTI. As Mentzer et al. (2001) stated, commitment is a
precondition that needs to be in place in order for a company to
achieve inter-ﬁrm coordination, and without INTI, EI cannot
achieve its full potential. Our ﬁndings state that EC directly
beneﬁts INTI and EI through INTI. EC therefore contributes to SCI
through INTI (Vanichchinchai and Igel, 2011).

(H16) and CI

(H17)

When these results are compared to the relationships identi-
ﬁed in the analysis of the SCI dimensions and performance, a
model is identiﬁed in which EC helps SCI to be achieved through
its inﬂuence on INTI. INTI in turn contributes to better perfor-
mance being obtained both directly and through its mediating
inﬂuence on EI. EI also contributes to performance. This would
mean that SCI is mediating the relationship between EC and
performance (H18). The results conﬁrm a full mediation of SCI in
the relationship of EC with each of the operational performance
measures. Having committed employees is therefore an important
element for SCI to achieve better results in delivery, ﬂexibility,
inventory and quality. However, SCI mediation is partial
for
customer satisfaction, as EC has a strong direct effect.

The mediation detected between EC and performance conﬁrms
the results of Gowen and Tallon (2003) and is consistent with past
studies on EC that indicate that it is crucial for the success of SCM
(Dooley and Fryxell, 1999; Dow et al., 1999). Furthermore, the
contribution that EC makes to better SCI plays a core role in
mitigating the adverse impact of SC implementation barriers on
the success of SC practices (Gowen and Tallon, 2003). It is thus clear
that it is necessary to focus on the workforce management factor to
obtain an added advantage/improvement that can become the
source of competitive advantage for the organisation and the SC.
This paper conﬁrms these results by demonstrating that EC, a main
outcome of workforce management, beneﬁts SCI and, through SCI,
improves operational performance. Vanichchinchai (2012) identi-
ﬁed that the relationship between EC and performance was
mediated by EI. Our research completes the relationships identiﬁed
by said author as his model did not consider INTI.

Our results therefore conﬁrm previous research (Pandey et al.,
2012; Gowen and Tallon, 2003; Vanichchinchai and Igel, 2011;
Vanichchinchai, 2012) and contribute greater evidence by specifying
a more complex model which veriﬁes the existence of intermediate
variables to explain the relationships that enable organisational
performance to be improved through workforce management and
SCI. Fawcett et al. (2008) state that workforce management will not
only bridge the current gaps encountered in SCM but allow success
to be improved and greater rewards of SC to be reaped. So, one of
the pillars of SCM success is founded on people.

Summarising our ﬁnal model, we conclude that:

(1) The relationship between EC and the other research constructs
is entirely mediated by INTI, except for the relationship with
customer satisfaction, on which it has strong direct and indirect

effects. The relationship between EC and operational perfor-
mance is fully mediated by SCI, which it affects through INTI,
with the moderate indirect effects of EC on delivery and
ﬂexibility standing out. In consequence, EC plays a key role in
explaining the results obtained with the implementation of SCI.
(2) EC is necessary for INTI to be achieved effectively, and INTI
affects performance both directly and indirectly. INTI has a
direct strong effect on ﬂexibility. However, as we have identi-
ﬁed that EI (SI/CI/EIO) mediates the relationship between INTI
and performance, INTI contributes to customer satisfaction
with a strong indirect effect through EI and to operational
performance with a moderate indirect effect.

(3) With respect to EI, INTI is necessary for EI to achieve results.
We have identiﬁed that EIO mediates the relationships of both
SI and CI with performance. SI and CI only have a direct
inﬂuence on customer satisfaction and they have a strong
effect. The indirect effect of SI is strong on delivery and quality
and moderate on ﬂexibility and inventory. Meanwhile, CI
affects operational performance indirectly and delivery and
quality moderately. Finally, EIO has a strong direct effect on all
operational performance measures, but no relationship is
identiﬁed with customer satisfaction.

(4) All the relationships among EC, SCI dimensions and perfor-
mance analysed in the ﬁnal model explain 37.6% of variance in
delivery, 25.1% in ﬂexibility, 20.4% in inventory, 27.0% in quality
and 57.5% of variance in customer satisfaction (Table 10).

5.2. Contributions

This research makes several contributions. Firstly, this study
has contributed to ﬁlling the gap that exists in the relationships
(direct and mediated) among EC, SCI (considering its dimensions)
and performance (Shub and Stonebraker, 2009; Fisher et al., 2010).
The ﬁnal model contributes new evidence to the literature,
analysing a complex model that relates a set of variables that to
date had not been studied jointly or in such detail. Workforce
management has not been greatly addressed in OM research and a
very few studies have analysed SCI acting as a mediator between
EC and performance (Gowen and Tallon, 2003; Vanichchinchai,
2012). In general terms, the paper attempts to clarify the mediat-
ing effects of SCI between EC and performance in a deﬁnitive
model that nuances the direct relationships initially found.

Secondly, this study contributes to the literature by providing a
detailed study of the direct and indirect effects of each SCI
dimension on each performance measure. Different models were
created for this that enabled the way that the relationships
became nuanced to be observed as mediating constructs and
antecedents were added. With this we provide empirical evidence
that can explain the heterogeneous results in the prior research
that analyses the relationship between SCI and performance.

Thirdly, the paper analyses SCI not as a single construct, but
distinguishing between its various dimensions,
including INTI,
which has been excluded from many papers (Flynn et al., 2010).
This research reinforces the key role of INTI in achieving EI and
performance. It also demonstrates the important role of EIO in
improving operational performance.

Finally, the performance measures have been analysed indepen-
dently and this enables the inﬂuence that EC and SCI dimensions
have on each measure to be seen, as well as more detailed results to
be achieved than if performance are analysed in aggregate terms.

5.3.

Implications for managers

From a practical standpoint, our research offers managers evidence
of the beneﬁts of EC as an antecedent of SCI. Firms could achieve a

255

greater competitive advantage by improving their EC and SCI. In this
regard, senior management should pay special attention to EC and
INTI to achieve all the performance potentials that SCI is capable of,
while also being mindful that EC is a social process that is built up over
a long period of time. The results show that if a ﬁrm achieves EC and
SCI this will impact on all the performance measures (Table 10). The
strongest impact will be on customer satisfaction. Although there will
be less impact on delivery, quality, ﬂexibility and, ﬁnally, on inventory,
it will nonetheless be sufﬁciently strong. Koulikoff-Souviron and
Harrison (2007) stress the central role of workforce practices in
supporting and operationalising SC relationships, but also point out
that, despite this, human resources managers are barely involved in
the management of these relationships. In this line, McCarter et al.
(2005) state that managers assert that workforce management is
fundamental for the success of SCI but, in practice, priority is given to
technical questions, and this huge potential is lost. It would therefore
seem that greater importance should be placed on workforce manage-
ment in the process to accomplish SCI. Studies such as that which we
present here conﬁrm the need for genuinely undertaking the practice
of workforce management and coordinating it with SCM in order to
achieve EC given the evident beneﬁts that it provides to the ﬁrm. EC
can be developed through the implementation or deployment of High
Commitment Work Practices, such as job-based skill training, formal
performance management, job security, job enrichment, work teams,
and suggestion systems. All these practices aim to drive up skill levels,
motivation and empowerment, which are the levers that deploy
worker commitment (Guest, 2001; Patterson et al., 2010; Marin-
Garcia, 2013).

As we have demonstrated, by achieving EC the ﬁrm contributes to
improving INTI and by obtaining INTI it helps to achieve SI and CI.
The results indicate that neither CI nor SI on its own is enough to
improve operational performance, but that EIO is necessary for the
organisation to achieve improvements in operational performance.
As a result, companies should strive to achieve both EC and INTI as
they mutually reinforce each other. Similarly, managers should
achieve INTI before EI and include EI at the strategic level in order
to reap the greatest advantages from SCI. Meanwhile, managers
should promote EC not only for better SC success but also to mitigate
the barriers of SCM implementation (Gowen and Tallon, 2003).

5.4. Limitations and future research

As with all empirical research, our study has its limitations.
Firstly, we share one limitation with the majority of studies
undertaken in the area. We use cross-data and, although we have
used the causality sequence proposed in the prior literature, we
are fully aware that this type of data does not enable the direction
of the causality to be fully tested. Secondly, we have assumed that
EC fully mediates workforce management, not only with respect to
performance, which is an aspect on which evidence can be found
in the prior literature, but also with respect to SCI. This last point
has not been the object of study in the references found.

The data set used was collected during the 2005–2008 period.
Since then, the deployment levels of the constructs analysed may
have changed. In other words, it is very likely that the mean scores
of the constructs would have varied during this time. One reason
for this might be evolving technology; another, the worldwide
economic crisis that had affected all the countries in the sample
population and all productive sectors, impacting especially on the
three sectors in the sample used here. Nonetheless, the objectives
of this research would seem to indicate that, rather than any
changes in the deployment levels of each of the practices, what
might be a limitation of the study is that the measurement or
structural invariance between the date on which the data were
collected and a sample taken at the present time might not be
complied with. In other words, the relationships between the

constructs may have changed due to the new technologies facil-
itating greater internal integration or integration with customers
and suppliers, or due to the economic crisis, or some other variable
that constitutes a change of paradigm between 2005–2008 and
the current time. It would be of great interest to develop future
research with a study using new data, which would address this
issue by analysing whether the more widespread use of informa-
tion technologies or undergoing deep and long-lasting crises have
any effects on construct loads.

Another limitation is that the data are taken from three
industries (electronics, machinery, and automotive components)
that all produce manufacturing products. The results should
therefore be analysed in the context of these sectors, and the
results cannot be stated to hold in other contexts. However, this
research is based on a powerful data set, which allows many of the
limitations of previous studies to overcome, including those linked
to multiple-informant data gathering, sample size, the breadth of
the set of variables envisaged, the use of reliable multi-item scales
and a sampling design by industry and country.

This study's proposed further research model focuses on two
elements, ﬁrstly by extending the analysed model to the left to
include workforce management practices as an antecedent of EC.
This would enable an analysis to be done of whether EC mediates
the relationship between workforce management practices and
SCI and performance (as we have assumed on the basis of the
existing prior literature); thus allowing empirical evidence to be
provided as to whether this mediation exists or not and, if it does,
whether it is full or partial. Secondly, it would be desirable to
extend the model to the right to take in ﬁnancial performance
measures and to analyse whether operational performance med-
iates the relationship between SCI and ﬁnancial performance, as
the prior literature states. The proposed model would thus be
completed and include new causality relationships that would
allow advances to be made in the ﬁeld.

The review of the previous literature on this topic shows that
research has mainly focused on the manufacturing sector, so it
would be interesting to analyse the proposed research model in
the services sector and to conduct a comparative intersectoral
analysis. Also, given the prior literature's lack of consensus on the
results, it would be interesting to carry out qualitative research
(case studies) to help theory building in the ﬁeld.

In other respects, as stated in the literature review, a reason for
the lack of consensus in prior empirical research on how SCI affects
performance can be that SCI does not have the same impact on
performance depending on the country, industry, plant age, product
complexity or plant size. In consequence, further research will go
deeper into the analysis in an attempt to clarify the speciﬁc contexts
in which achieving SCI may not be interesting for improving
organisational performance and competitive advantages.
