Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this study is to draw on several perspectives rarely used in reverse logistics (RL)
research – such as sustainable development, the natural resource-based view and green innovation – to
examine the relationship between RL innovation and environmental and economic performance while
incorporating institutional theory to verify how institutional pressures moderate these relationships.
Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey is used to investigate Taiwan’s electrical,
electronic and information industries, as well as maintenance and retail stores selling computers,
communications and consumer electronics. First, a hierarchical regression analysis is used. Next,
moderating relationships are examined along with the related regulatory, competitor and customer
pressures.
Findings – The results indicate that RL innovation is positively associated with environmental and
economic performance. Moreover, three institutional pressures positively moderated the relationships
between RL innovation and environmental performance. However, investment in greater RL innovation
under higher-level institutional pressures did not always enhance economic performance.
Research limitations/implications – Reverse logistics innovation comprises five components, one
of which is cross-functional
integration, the process of obtaining information from marketing,
production and logistics managers about how their firms created the marketing-operations interface to
better handle RL. However, we obtained RL innovation information only from individual respondents.
In addition, this study focuses on the economic and environmental aspects of RL activities. Future
studies should apply the RL perspective on social sustainability to probe RL issues from sustainability’s
environmental, social and economic points of views.
Practical implications – Contrary to the conventional wisdom that RL imposes costs, reduces
productivity and curbs competitiveness, this study finds that RL innovation can enrich environmental
and economic performances, indicating that firms with more innovative RL capabilities yield more
sustainable outcomes for environmental protection, social responsibility and economic performance.
Originality/value – This study contributes to the RL literature by applying multiple perspectives –
including sustainable development, the natural resource-based view and green innovation – to explore
the relationship between RL innovation and performance while using institutional theory to probe the
moderating effects of institutional pressures on RL innovation and performance.

1. Introduction
Sustainable development is regarded as a vitally important business goal with a
profound impact on firm competitiveness (Hart, 2005; Pfeffer, 2010). Sustainability is an
emerging megatrend that has caused enterprises to rethink their strategies (Lee and
Lam, 2012; Lubin and Esty, 2010) and has driven green innovation (Nidumolu et al.,
2009). The cornerstone of sustainability is the interlocking of the environmental, social
and economic spheres, the development of which should be harmonious (Elkington,
1997). In response to sustainable development concerns about the integration of
economics, environment and society (Carter and Rogers, 2008), reverse logistics (RL) is
seen by many as a promising organizing concept that considers environmental elements
in the management of returned goods (Álvarez et al., 2007; de Brito et al., 2002). RL is the
“[…] process of planning, implementing and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw
materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information from the point of
consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing the value of proper disposal
(Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 1999, p. 2).

The conventional view is that RL imposes costs, slows productivity growth and hinders
competitiveness. For example, Stock et al. (2006) argued that the cost of processing RL
could increase the time required for an outbound shipment by a factor of two or three.
Organizations still consider RL as a “necessary evil” rather than an opportunity for
future performance (Genchev et al., 2011). Thus, the impact of RL is often ignored or, at
least, not well understood by many firms (Huang et al., 2012), although it is widely
accepted that RL can improve customer satisfaction (Li and Olorunniwo, 2008; Richey
et al., 2005) and create cost savings (Jack et al., 2010; Srivastava and Srivastava, 2006).
Firms thus realize the need to develop sustainable initiatives capabilities to allow RL to
create a competitive advantage (Huang et al., 2012; Jack et al., 2010).

The sustainability initiatives capabilities of RL are often referred to as “innovative
RL” (Richey et al., 2005); this has become a topic of interest for both business leaders and
academics. However, little research has been conducted on the efficacy of innovative RL
capabilities (Jack et al., 2010). Innovations are adopted as responses to changes in the
internal and external environments or as preemptive actions taken to influence the
environment (Damanpour, 1992). Hart (2005) argued that, when considering innovation
and repositioning to achieve sustainability, it is important to consider how efficiently
firms operate with their current assets and how well they reposition and acquire new
capabilities for the future by pursuing short- and long-term sustainability creating activities.
Drawing on the literature of green innovation, we argue that RL innovation increases firms’
ability to pursue creative, unusual or novel solutions while performing RL activities based on
the need for sustainable development (Christmann, 2000; Huang and Wu, 2010). Moreover,
we propose that RL innovation positively influences firm performance. Although economic
performance has traditionally been, and continues to be, the first priority for manufacturers,
especially in developing countries such as Taiwan, environmental performance has become
increasingly important. Many Taiwanese firms have started considering and implementing
innovative RL to improve both their environmental and economic performances (Huang
et al., 2012). Thus, this study considers the role of RL’s environmental and economic
performance in meeting the requirement of sustainable development.

Over the past decade, the volume of RL literature has grown considerably. The
theoretical work and empirical research to date have explored the relationship between

external factors (stakeholders) and RL practice (Álvarez et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Benito
and Gonzalez-Benito, 2006). Some papers have examined the internal factors influencing
RL performance from the resource-based view (Daugherty et al., 2001, 2002; Richey et al.,
2005). However, this work is arguably preliminary, and some questions still need to be
addressed. For example, these studies have produced conflicting research findings on
the relationships between RL capabilities and organizational performance, and this
heterogeneity is represented even in the types of pressures organizations face,
explicable through institutional theory (Zhu and Sarkis, 2007). According to the
institutional theory, environmental alignment can be influenced by three pressures:
normative, coercive and mimetic (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Institutional theory has been
identified as potentially valuable to management research; such research is scarce, and
empirical work is nonexistent in the RL literature (Jennings and Zandbergen, 1995; Scott,
2008; Suchman, 1995). In addition, whether the relationships between RL capabilities and
organizational performance are moderated by various institutional pressures has not
been evaluated. We argue that the existence of and response to various institutional
pressures will cause the relationships between RL capabilities and performance to vary.
This study has several objectives. First, it uses the innovation theory (Christmann,
2000; Damanpour, 1992) to examine the relationship between RL innovation and
performance. Second, it uses the institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;
Jennings and Zandbergen, 1995) to explain the institutional pressure moderating the
effects of RL innovation and its related influence on organizational performance. Third,
it examines whether Taiwan’s computer, communications and consumer electronics
(3C) manufacturers and retailers are responding to different isomorphic pressures –
regulatory (coercive), competitor (mimetic) and customer (normative) – resulting in
differing relationships between RL capabilities and environmental and economic
performance. Understanding the relationships among RL innovation, institutional
pressures, and performance is critical for managers in developing countries to manage
their environmental and economic performances strategically. The study’s research
structure is shown in Figure 1.

This study begins by reviewing the RL literature and then provides the theoretical
background and foundation for its hypotheses. The Methodology introduces the
research design, implementation and results of the statistical analysis. The major
research and managerial implications are presented in the Discussion. Finally, the
study’s limitations and suggestions for future research are addressed in the Conclusion.

2. Literature review and hypotheses development
2.1 Related research on RL
In the extant research, the resource-capability-advantage (RCA) theory (Hunt and
Morgan, 1996) provides the framework for examining the impact of developing
RL-related capabilities and outcomes; the number of RL papers that apply the RCA
theory in explorations of RL strategies and practices leading to superior outcomes has
increased. We reviewed the relevant studies and identified two approaches to
developing RL capabilities and enhancing performance to enable firms to manage their
RL activities-information- and innovation-related processes – in a better manner. First,
from an information-support perspective, Daugherty et al.
(2001) found that the
commitment of management resources significantly influenced the achievement of RL
program goals. Daugherty et al. (2005) argued that exploiting information technology

(IT) capabilities is important to the management of RL. They found that information support
for authorizing, tracking and handling returns positively influenced both economic and
service quality-related performance. Olorunniwo and Li (2010) conducted a survey of 600 US
companies and found that IT operational attributes, information sharing and collaboration
can positively impact RL performance. Moreover, Jack et al. (2010) illustrated that RL
capabilities result in cost savings. Second, from an innovative view, Richey et al. (2005)
argued that resources could be used to develop innovative RL capabilities to enhance
performance and gain competitive differentiation. However, they also found that no
significant effect existed between RL innovation and strategic performance or operational
responsiveness. Huang et al. (2012) conducted a survey of 349 Taiwanese high-tech
companies and found that resource commitment positively and significantly influenced
economic and environmental performances. These works have produced mixed results
concerning the relationships between RL capabilities and environmental and economic
performances, and very few studies have explored the relationship between RL
innovation and performance, especially environmental performance.

2.2 RL and sustainable development
Since the publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987 and the subsequent Earth
Summits in Rio de Janeiro (1992) and Johannesburg (2002), sustainable development has
been an urgent global issue. Sustainability involves the integration of environmental,
social and economic criteria and the maintenance of an equitable balance among the
three aspects that foster an organization’s long-term competitiveness (Carter and
Rogers, 2008; Elkington, 1997). The holistic view of sustainable development is
becoming increasingly strategic because it affects firms’ core business and their growth,
profitability and even survival (Álvarez et al., 2007; Lee and Lam, 2012). Reverse
logistics has become a sustainable development issue for several reasons, including
economics, corporate citizenship and legislation. Economic forces dictate that RL
activities such as remanufacturing, materials reuse and product refurbishing can
improve profitability through cost minimization, customer service improvement and


increased revenues (Daugherty et al., 2001; Jack et al., 2010). Corporate citizenship is the
process through which firms place a high priority on addressing climate change or
global warming from environmental and social perspectives (Álvarez et al., 2007; Carter
and Rogers, 2008). The legislation issue refers to the norms imposed by jurisdictions
that dictate firms’ legal obligations (de Brito et al., 2002; Mollenkopf et al., 2011), such as
requiring that manufacturers take back their sold products and reduce their carbon
footprint. Thus, to achieve sustainable development, a firm must continually upgrade
its innovative RL activities. Innovative approaches are recommended for improving
RL’s efficiency and effectiveness and for helping firms gain a competitive advantage
(Daugherty et al., 2005).

2.3 RL innovation
The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, introduced by Wernerfelt (1984), provided
the theoretical framework for this study’s exploration of RL-related capabilities and
performance. The RBV theory focuses on the importance of organizational resources
that are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (Barney, 1991). Based on the
RBV, Hart (1995) developed the natural RBV, which posits that a firm uses its
knowledge of the environmental issues relevant to its business and procedures to act on
and react to those issues. However, Hart (1995) took a different perspective from Barney
(1991) in arguing that a purely “internally-based” competitive approach may prove
inadequate because of the effect of external relations. By contrast, Hart (1995),
recognizing the challenges imposed by both the natural and social environments,
suggested that strategy and competitive advantages tend to be rooted in a firm’s ability
to facilitate environmentally responsible activity. When firms face sustainable
development challenges, Hart (2005) argued, green innovation is an important factor in
how efficiently firms operate using their current assets and how well they develop new
capabilities to gain a competitive advantage. Innovation, the seeking of creative,
unusual or novel solutions to problems or needs (Christmann, 2000), is especially
important for RL because reverse flows are different from standard outbound
operations and require special handling that usually requires additional resource
allocation. Rennings (2000) defined green innovations as:

measures of relevant actors (firms, private households), which: develop new ideas, behaviour,
products and processes, apply or introduce them, and contribute to a reduction of
environmental burdens or to ecologically specified sustainability targets (p. 322).

Therefore, drawing on the green innovation literature, this study defines “RL innovation” as
a firm’s capacity to seek creative or novel ideas, behaviors, products and processes in
carrying out RL activities to reduce environmental burdens and foster sustainable
development (Christmann, 2000; Hart, 2005; Rennings, 2000). Federal Express is an example
of a firm that uses its resources and accumulated knowledge to differentiate itself through
RL innovation. Netreturn, Federal Express’s returns-management system, relies on the
Internet to capture customer information, schedule pick-ups, arrange transportation and
track the status of returned goods. When a logistics manager develops processes that can be
altered rapidly and successfully to fit customer needs, the firm may develop an innovative
capability.

The extant research suggests that one can assess RL innovation by evaluating five
components: customization, formalization, flexibility, information-related ability and


MRR
37,7

620

cross-functional integration (Jack et al., 2010; Mollenkopf et al., 2011; Richey et al., 2005).
Customization is the act of tailoring a product or technology to the special and unique
needs of the customer. One way to develop an innovative capability is customizing RL
technology to fit customer needs. Formalization is the extent of a firm’s rules,
procedures, instructions and communications (Pugh et al., 1968). Studies indicate that
formalization is necessary for managing all aspects of the distribution effort, including
the return movement of goods and services from the market (Genchev et al., 2011).
Innovative approaches to RL can be developed to bypass the standard distribution
formats used for original outbound shipments and apply special decisions, rules and
policies for returns. For example, policies could be developed to speed up the return
authorization process customers use to return merchandise (Richey et al., 2005).
Flexibility is the extent to which one party is willing to make changes to accommodate
a business partner’s needs (Cannon and Homburg, 2001). Information-related ability is a
measure of RL innovation. Jack et al. (2010) argued that RL capabilities include the
internal and external connectivity and usefulness of information, as well as its accuracy
and availability. Finally, another way for a firm to develop innovative capabilities is to
increase cross-functional integration. Cross-functional integration typically involves
facilitating communication among several functions (Troy et al., 2008). Mollenkopf et al.
(2011) argued that cross-functional integration in the RL context can involve the
magnitude of interaction and communication, the level of information sharing, the
degree of coordination and the extent of joint involvement across functions during a
specific return task.

2.4 RL innovation and performance
Sustainability is a wide conception, with interlocking environmental, social and
economic spheres; however, harmonious development among these three spheres is
hard to achieve (Marcus and Fremeth, 2009). Firms can easily evaluate their RL
performance by examining their economic and environmental performances (Sarkis
et al., 2010). Thus, this study focuses on the economic and environmental aspects of RL
activities. Judge and Douglas (1998) defined environmental performance as the level of
organization-wide commitment to environmental excellence relative to a variety of areas
and operational activities. Environmental excellence is the process of
taking
environmental improvement initiatives beyond regulatory compliance and pollution
prevention to create superior environmental performance (Lee and Green, 1994;
McCloskey and Maddock, 1994; O’Dea and Pratt, 1995). We modify Judge and Douglas’s
(1998) definition and define environmental RL performance as the level of
organization-wide
the
implementation of RL. In this study, economic performance is defined as the effectiveness
and efficiency with which firms perform RL, including its operational, financial and
customer service aspects (Autry et al., 2001; Daugherty et al., 2002).

Innovative RL capabilities are the internal capabilities and processes that firms
deploy to carry out their RL activities effectively (Richey et al., 2005; Jack et al., 2010).
Effective RL allows a company to take advantage of inventory reduction and
distribution cost savings and improve customer satisfaction (Li and Olorunniwo, 2008;
Richey et al., 2005; Srivastava and Srivastava, 2006) while enhancing environmental
performance (Huang et al., 2012). Jack et al. (2010) argued that RL capabilities comprise
a bundle of information-related processes, enabling a firm to better manage its RL

activities and positively affect a company’s bottom line by recapturing the value
remaining in the returned product. Moreover, Richey et al. (2005) found that innovative
RL capabilities are positively related to operational service quality. Mollenkopf et al.
(2011) emphasized the need for the cross-functional integration of marketing and
operations when implementing product returns to create customer value. Thus, we posit
the two hypotheses below:

H1. RL innovation is positively related to environmental performance.
H2. RL innovation is positively related to economic performance.

2.5 Moderating effects
Successful organizations are those that most efficiently interact with their
environments; particularly important is the need to understand the ways in which
organizations adapt to, or otherwise interact with, their environments (Oliver, 1997).
Strategy matching, aligning organizational resources with an organization’s context,
especially environmental opportunities and threats, is a major task for decision-makers
(Mollenkopf et al., 2011; Scott, 2008). This study regarded institutional pressures as the
moderators of the relationship between RL innovation and performance. In other words,
the relationship between RL innovation and performance may differ depending upon
the institutional pressure on a firm’s RL strategy. According to Suchman (1995),
institutional theory suggests that firms not only seek profit but also recognize the
importance of achieving social legitimacy. The institutional theory posits that external
forces motivate firms to achieve similar strategic actions (Scott, 2008). DiMaggio and
Powell (1983) argued that managerial decisions are strongly influenced by three
institutional mechanisms – coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism – that create
and diffuse a common set of values, norms and rules to produce similar practices and
structures across organizations sharing an organizational field.
Jennings and
Zandbergen (1995) applied institutional theory to ecologically sustainable organizations
and suggested that institutional forces – coercive, mimetic and normative – are the main
drivers of business sustainability.

Therefore, we propose that all institutional pressures (i.e. coercive, mimetic and
normative) have the capacity to influence an organization’s responsiveness to the
adoption of RL initiatives. First, conformity through coercive pressures occurs via the
influence exerted by those in power. Government agencies are examples of powerful
groups that may influence the actions of an organization (Carter and Ellram, 1998). This
paper defines “environmental regulations” as the coercive pressures driving firms to
implement RL innovation and improve their performance. Second, mimetic pressures
occur when an organization mimics the actions of successful industry competitors.
Firms may follow or “mimic” competitors merely because of their success in
implementing RL innovation. Third, normative pressures cause organizations to
conform in order to be perceived as more legitimate. Customer requirements form the
core normative pressure through which firms implement RL. Therefore, we regard the
major institutional pressures – regulatory, competitor and customer – as moderators.
2.5.1 Regulatory pressures as a moderator. Jennings and Zandbergen (1995) argued
that coercive forces (i.e. regulation and regulatory enforcement) have forced firms to
implement similar industry practices. Regulatory pressures have exerted heterogeneous
influences upon different industries, leading to organizational variations in environmental


MRR
37,7

622

strategies. For example, Walther and Spengler (2005) argued that the adoption of the
European Union’s directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment caused essential
changes in the field of electronic scrap recycling; the directive expands the responsibility of
original equipment manufacturers beyond the usage phase of products to the treatment of
discarded electronic devices at the end of their lives. For instance, to respond to the
requirements for return, Estée Lauder made a small investment of $1.3 million to build its
proprietary RL system of scanners and business intelligence tools linked to an Oracle
database. In the first year, Estée Lauder was able to evaluate 24 per cent more returned
products, reduce its rate of destroyed products from 37 to 27 per cent and save about $0.5
million in labor costs. Estée Lauder has, after a very successful RL project, created a $250
million product line from its returned goods flow, now representing the company’s third
most profitable product line (Jayaraman and Luo, 2007).

The government can control, legislate or otherwise influence an organization’s
policies and practices. Some researchers have argued that the government (i.e. the
regulatory sector) has the greatest influence on a firm’s RL activities (Carter and Ellram,
1998; Canning, 2006). To promote environmental protection, governments in developing
countries have become increasingly concerned about the threat to human and
environmental safety posed by end-of-life phones and other electronic products
exported there for disposal (Huang et al., 2012). Moreover, Álvarez et al. (2007) argued
that regulations influence the implementation of RL programs, a view Fineman and
Clarke (1996) supported by finding that superior resources allow firms to more quickly
and efficiently adapt to regulations and gain advantages over their competitors.
According to Zhu and Sarkis (2007), regulatory pressure can slightly moderate the
relationship between green purchasing and environmental performance. However, they
also emphasized that firms facing greater environmentally focused regulatory
pressures tend to budget additional financial resources for these environmental
practices, reducing their economic performance. Mollenkopf et al. (2011) argued that
regulatory changes seem to have a more negative impact on the relationship between
return management and customer value. Thus, we posit the following hypotheses:

H3. The positive relationship between RL innovation and environmental
performance is stronger in firms facing higher environmental regulation
pressures than in firms facing lower environmental regulation pressures.

H4. The positive relationship between RL innovation and economic performance is
weaker in firms facing higher environmental regulation pressures than in firms
facing lower environmental regulation pressures.

2.5.2 Competitor pressures as a moderator. Firms aim to enhance their legitimacy by
imitating successful competitors, especially when faced with high uncertainty
(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Jennings and Zandbergen (1995) found that many
managers were not certain about how best to respond to environmental issues.
Unsurprisingly, then, research has shown that firms imitate their competitors’
environmental conduct (Bansal and Roth, 2000). Competitors’ actions can influence a
firm’s level of environmental responsibility. For example, Bergh (2002) found that firms
were most strongly influenced to learn about and respond to natural environmental
issues by paying close attention to other firms, including competitors. Some studies
have shown that competitive factors may play a prominent role in corporate
environmental response (Kagan et al., 2003).

Industrial professional groups have also played essential roles in promoting
environmental practices among Taiwanese manufacturers. In recent years, numerous
national and local industrial professional associations have been established in Taiwan
(Huang and Wu, 2010). The activities of industrial professional groups have motivated
firms to implement environmental management practices, improving environmental
performance. Unfortunately, direct and rapid economic performance gains through
environmental practice will probably take longer to appear (Bowen et al., 2001). As a
result, Taiwanese firms may suffer short-term economic losses when seeking to improve
their environmental performance. However, better environmental practices occurring
through competitive pressure will likely create better economic performance in the long
term (Huang et al., 2012).

Additional pressure from competitors and support from industrial professional
groups can both lead to RL innovation and improve environmental performance.
Economic losses are incurred when organizations face competitive pressures to adopt
RL innovation owing to increased investments and shifting resources. If firms’
motivation to implement RL innovation comes primarily from competitive pressures,
economic gains and benefits will be relatively strategic, reflecting long-term rather than
short-term gains. Thus, we propose the following two hypotheses:

H5. The positive relationship between RL innovation and environmental
performance is stronger in firms facing higher competitor pressure than in firms
facing lower competitor pressure.

H6. The positive relationship between RL innovation and economic performance is
stronger in firms facing higher competitor pressure than in firms facing lower
competitor pressure.

2.5.3 Customer pressures as a moderator. Customer pressures motivate organizations to
incorporate environmental practices and respond with in-kind performance improvements
(Kagan et al., 2003). Huang et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of effective customer
participation in the recycling business. Canning (2006) found that consumers’ awareness and
participation is essential in improving the mechanisms for recovering and reusing/recycling
end-of-life equipment
in the UK mobile phone industry. Gonzalez-Benito and
Gonzalez-Benito (2006) stressed that the level of customer pressure affects RL. For instance,
India is Nokia’s second-largest market, but, in a recent survey, Nokia found that only 17 per
cent of Indian consumers knew that they could recycle their phones. To make recycling easy,
Nokia put special bins at retail stores and trained their people to inform customers about the
options for recycling their handsets. As a result, India collected some 68,000 pieces of
equipment in 45 days, and roughly 65-80 per cent of each Nokia device can be recycled
(Nidumolu et al., 2009).

Álvarez et al. (2007) empirically found that customers influence RL activities.
Moreover, Zhu and Sarkis (2007) found that market (i.e. customer) pressure can
moderate the relationship between the eco-design of a green supply chain practice and
environmental performance. According to Jack et al. (2010), if firms do not feel pressure
from customers, they may be reluctant to implement innovative environmental
practices that can create economic benefits: a lack of customer pressure may cause
organizations to weaken their environmental performance and lose customers,
influencing their economic performance. Based on these arguments and the extant
literature, we propose the two hypotheses below:


MRR
37,7

624

H7. The positive relationship between RL innovation and environmental
performance is stronger in firms facing higher pressure from customers than in
firms facing lower pressure from customers.

H8. The positive relationship between RL innovation and economic performance is
stronger in firms facing higher pressure from customers than in firms facing
lower pressure from customers.

3. Methodology
3.1 Sampling and data collection
The survey items in this study were either adapted from previous research or developed
specifically for this study. Most of these items required modification, or at least
translation, before being applied to this study’s context. Thus, in-depth interviews were
conducted with seven business managers involved in RL activities. The managers’
insights, along with an extensive review of the previous literature, helped in the
development of the survey instrument. The measurement was subsequently pretested
on 30 respondents (ten individuals from the academic, consulting and business sectors
and a further 20 representatives of the 3C manufacturing and retail industries). The
comments and suggestions of these respondents were used to improve the readability
and lucidity of our questionnaire.

This study’s sample comprises Taiwanese manufacturers in high-tech industries
and maintenance shops and retailers of 3C items, a sample set that seemed favorable for
a study of RL innovation. Taiwan’s 3C and high-tech industries are not only globally
prominent, but Taiwan is also a major international producer of information products,
electronics and electrical-related products. Taiwan’s high-tech sector, particularly the
information industry, has experienced phenomenal growth in both scale and revenues.
In 1983, there were only 37 high-tech firms located in the Hsinchu Science Park, the first
and largest high-tech industrial park in Taiwan. By 2009, this number had soared to 440,
and together they yielded total revenues amounting to USD28.5 billion (Huang et al.,
2012). Some of Taiwan’s industries, especially the computer and electronics sectors,
have become world leaders in manufacturing. For instance, computer monitors, printed
circuit boards and image scanners produced in Taiwan account for 50 per cent of the
global market share (Huang and Wu, 2010). Moreover, Taiwan’s logistics costs are
increasing every year. The 2010 Taiwan Logistics Yearbook showed that these costs
accounted for 12.07 per cent of Taiwan’s gross domestic product, with the major
customers being firms in the 3C industry, which comprise 38.3 per cent of all industrial
logistics costs (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan R.O.C, 2011). Approximately 2.9
million pieces and 1.7 million units were recovered information and electrical products,
respectively,
in 2009 (Environmental Protection Administration Executive Yuan,
Taiwan R.O.C., 2011). The overall amount of returns in the emerging economy is large
and growing in Taiwan. Furthermore, the Taiwanese Government has promulgated
many new recycling laws and standards, compelling both manufacturers and retailers
to recycle their products. Finally, RL is of paramount importance to 3C retailers (Wu and
Chen, 2006) because of the characteristics of 3C products, which often experience
exceptionally high rates of elimination, as well as complex repair, recycle, reuse and
resale cycles (Daugherty et al., 2001). For example, approximately 3.55 and 1.79 million
information and electrical products, respectively, were returned in Taiwan in 2010
(EPA, Taiwan, 2011). Thus, the overall amount of RL in this developing market is


Logistics

625

clearly large and growing, and the implementation of RL and the results for performance
in Taiwan are therefore worth exploring.

Taiwanese members of the Manufacturers Association of the electrical, electronic
and information industries and the 3C Retailer Association comprise the sample base of
this survey. A random sample of 450 companies from the 3C Retailer Association and
750 manufacturers from the electrical, electronic and information industries was
selected. After pilot testing, we mailed the questionnaires and a small thank-you gift to
the chief executive officers (CEOs) of selected firms on March 19, 2005, as the CEOs had
extensive knowledge of their firm’s situations and green innovation. Questionnaires
were mailed to the marketing, production and logistics managers on March 19, 2012, as
they were assumed to have knowledge of their companies’ RL programs. If the recipient
did not feel qualified to provide the necessary information, he or she was asked to
forward the survey to the most appropriate person within the same company. We made
initial follow-up calls on March 26 and a second round of follow-up calls on April 6. A
total of 322 usable responses were received. This comprised 210 early respondents (for
a 65.2 per cent response rate) and 112 late respondents (for a 34.8 per cent response rate).
The overall effective response rate was thus 26.8 per cent (322/1200). The response rate
by industry is summarized in Table I. The analysis of the non-response bias was
conducted by comparing early and late respondents (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). A
MANOVA was used to test the group differences for all relevant variables. No
significant differences were found (␣⫽ 0.05), suggesting that the non-response bias was
unlikely to have been an issue.

The 322 respondent companies represented a diverse profile of firms of various sizes.
More than 55.2 per cent of the respondents belonged to the small category (with ⬍ 200
employees), 30.7 per cent to the medium category (with between 201 and 500 employees)
and 14.1 per cent to the large category (with ⬎ 501 employees). Of the companies who
responded, approximately 70.2 per cent had an ISO 14001 certification, and about 29.8
per cent did not. Annual company sales ranged from USD2.3 to 26.86 million, with mean
sales of USD9.78 million (according to the exchange rate as of August 1, 2012). Because
the northern part of the country is more industrialized than the southern and eastern
parts, it was not surprising that the majority of the responding firms were located in the
northern part of Taiwan. The respondents included 120 marketing managers, 122
production managers and 80 logistics managers. We collected data only from
individuals in the marketing, production and logistics departments. Respondents’
profiles reflect the viewpoints of their departments. The respondents were senior-level
managers with an average work experience of 13.25 years, of which they had an average
of 5.62 years of experience in RL operations. The respondents were asked to indicate

59, with an average of five employees assigned to that area.

3.2 Measure development
As shown in the conceptual model, four constructs were of primary interest in this
study: institutional pressures, RL innovation, environmental performance and economic
performance. To test the paper’s hypotheses, a survey instrument was developed with
five items for RL innovation, three items for environmental performance, six items for
economic performance and nine items for institutional pressure. Existing scales were
used. Modifications were made as needed to adapt the items to a logistics context. The
measurements of observed variables are presented in Table II.

3.2.1 RL innovation. This study conceptualized RL innovation as a firm’s capacity to
pursue creative or novel ideas, behaviors, products and processes in implementing RL
activities to reduce environmental burdens and foster sustainable development
(Christmann, 2000; Hart, 2005; Rennings, 2000). RL innovation was measured using a
five-item scale derived from the emerging RL literature (Jack et al., 2010; Mollenkopf
et al., 2011; Richey et al., 2005). These RL innovation criteria address several aspects, as
seen in Table II:

• firms pursue RL activities mainly through technology development

(customization);
to better handle returns, firms create their own systems and procedures
(formalization);

• when products are returned, firms are good at finding their own ways of handing

them (flexibility);
to better manage RL activities, firms develop information systems availability
(information-related ability); and
to better handle RL, firms create a connected marketing – operations interface
(functional integration).

•

•

•

A 7-point scale was used (from 1 ⫽ “strongly disagree” to 7 ⫽ “strongly agree”),
applying the average of the five items for subsequent analysis.

3.2.2 Environmental performance. This study conceptualizes RL environmental
performance as an organization-wide commitment to environmental excellence relative
to the implementation of RL. Environmental performance was measured using a
three-item scale derived from the emerging RL literature. Respondents were required to
indicate how effective their companies have been at implementing RL in terms of
compliance with environmental regulations (Autry et al., 2001; Daugherty et al., 2002),
impacts beyond compliance (Daugherty et al., 2002) and
limiting environmental
enhancing a green corporate image (Huang et al., 2012). Respondents were asked to
indicate how effectively they had achieved these environmental RL objectives. Again, a
7-point scale was used (from 1 ⫽ “not at all effective” to 7 ⫽ “extremely effective”),
applying the average of the three items for subsequent analysis.

3.2.3 Economic performance. This study conceptualizes economic performance as
the effectiveness and efficiency with which firms implement RL,
including the
operational, financial and customer service aspects (Autry et al., 2001; Daugherty et al.,
2002). The scale items for measuring economic performance were developed by Autry

et al. (2001) and address cost control, customer service and performance outcomes. Six
items were used: recovery of assets, cost containment, improved profitability, improved
labor productivity, improved customer service and reduced inventory investment.
Respondents were asked to indicate how effective they had been at achieving economic
performance in the implementation of RL. Again, all items were measured on a 7-point
Likert scale (from 1 ⫽ “very little” to 7 ⫽ “substantial”), applying the average of the six
items for subsequent analysis.

3.2.4 Institutional pressures. Respondents were asked to measure institutional
pressures’ level of salience in RL implementation within their companies as exerted by three
external constituents – regulator (coercive) pressure, competitor (mimetic) pressure and
customer (normative) pressure (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007). To
determine the influences of these institutional pressures on RL activities, we used an index
ranking the salience of external constituents as the degree of each constituent’s power,
legitimacy and urgency (Mitchell et al., 1997). These attributes were captured by adapting to,
in the Taiwanese context, the scale developed by Agle et al. (1999). Respondents were first
asked whether the constituent had the power to enforce its claims; second, whether the
claims of this particular constituent were viewed by management as legitimate; and third,
whether the claims of this particular constituent were viewed by management as urgent.
Items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 ⫽ “strongly disagree” to 7 ⫽ “strongly
agree”), applying the average of the three items for subsequent analysis.

In October 1996,

3.2.5 Control variables. We also include Industry category, ISO 14001 certification,
company age and company size as control variables. Binary control variables were used
to distinguish the electrical, electronics and information equipment sectors from the 3C
maintenance and retailer stores. Huang and Wu (2010) found that there were significant
differences in new green product success for the electrical, electronics and information
industries in Taiwan.
ISO 14001 certification, referring to
environmental management systems, was finalized and thereafter diffused globally. To
measure whether the surveyed firms had adopted ISO 14001, its date of certification was
coded. If a firm was ISO 14001 certified, it was coded “1” for that year and “0” otherwise
(Delmas and Toffel, 2008). Company age was calculated as the difference between 2012
and the founding year of the organization. As an organization ages, organizational
efforts to respond to environmental issues may be hindered by organizational inertia
(Egri and Herman, 2000). Because large firms typically face greater environmental
pressure and are typically required to implement better environmental practices to
improve environmental performance, we used company size as the control variable (Zhu
and Sarkis, 2007). Following Child (1972), company size was measured as the natural
logarithmic transformation of the number of full-time employees.

4. Data analysis and results
4.1 Harman one-factor test
Because all the antecedent and consequent variables were measured using items in a
self-reported questionnaire completed by a single respondent, the Harman one-factor
test (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) was used to avoid common method variance (CMV).
This test involves entering all self-reported variables into a factor analysis and
examining the unrotated factor solution. High CMV is indicated by the emergence of a
single factor or by a single general factor that explains the majority of the covariance
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). We entered all 23 self-reported items into a principal

components factor analysis. The results yielded two factors with eigenvalues greater
than one, the first of which explained only 37 per cent of the variation. As no single
dominant factor accounted for a majority of the variation among the self-reported
variables, CMV was deemed unlikely to be a serious problem in the data.

4.2 Reliability and validity
To test the statistical validity of the survey, several statistical tests were performed
on the data. To evaluate the data’s conceptual constructs, a confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) was used to assess the dimensionality and reliability of each scale. A
CFA was performed on all of the responses to validate these constructs by
examining individual
internal consistency and discriminant
validity (Tables II and III).

item reliability,

This study assessed construct

reliability by calculating Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients for each of the RL innovation, performance and institutional pressures. The
test results showed that the alpha coefficients of RL innovation, environmental
performance and economic performance were 0.77, 0.75 and 0.84, respectively. The
alpha coefficients of customer, government and competitor pressures were 0.81, 0.82 and
0.80, respectively. All four constructs had alphas ⬎ 0.70 and were therefore considered
reliable (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). We used the composite reliability and average
variance extracted (AVE) to examine the internal consistency of each latent construct
(Fornell and Larcker, 1981); the values of the composite reliability for each construct
exceeded the threshold value of 0.70. Additionally, the AVE values exceeded the
threshold value of 0.50 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). These results demonstrated that our
measurement model had adequate internal consistency, as shown in Table II.

To assess discriminant validity, the correlations between a given construct and all
other constructs to the AVE for the focal construct were compared and analyzed (Hair
et al., 2006). Table III shows the correlation matrix for the constructs; the diagonal
elements have been replaced by the square root of the constructs’ AVE. Our constructs
demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, as these diagonal elements were greater
than the off-diagonal elements in the corresponding rows and columns.

4.3 Correlation analysis
As a first step in evaluating the strength of the relationships between the constructs,
a bivariate correlation analysis was performed using Pearson’s correlation analysis;
the results are shown in Table III. This analysis showed that all variables in the

model, except RL innovation, were positively related to environmental and economic
performances. It was also found that the moderating variables (i.e. regulator
pressure, competitor pressure and customer pressure) were positively related to the
outcome variables (i.e. environmental and economic performance). While this
correlation analysis of the direct relationships was interesting, it did not provide
further
insights into the interaction linkages between RL innovation and
performance, particularly with institutional pressures as the moderator. The next
step in the analysis was using hierarchical moderated regression analysis to test the
hypothesized relationships.

4.4 Hypotheses testing
4.4.1 RL innovation, environmental performance and moderating effects. This study
followed the variance-partitioning procedures outlined by methodologists (Jaccard and
Turrisi, 2003) and used in the empirical green supply chain management research
(Boon-itt and Wong, 2011; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007). The analysis was conducted in four
steps (see Table IV). First, the control variables, ISO 14001 certification, industry,
company age and company size, were entered into the regression. Second, the RL
innovation variable was entered into the regression. Third, the three moderators were
entered as a block. Fourth, the three interaction terms of RL innovation and each of the
moderators were entered as a block.

The literature suggests that ISO 14001 certification, industry, company age and
company size all influence environmental issues. This study included these variables as
statistical controls in its analysis. As shown in Table IV, Step 2 indicated that being in
the information industry has a positive and significant influence on environmental
performance, implying that there are significant environmental performance differences
among Taiwan’s high-tech industries when they are divided into the electrical,
electronics and information industries. In addition, as shown in Table IV, Step 2 tested
the impact of RL innovation on environmental performance, finding that RL innovation
has a positive and significant influence (p ⬍ 0.00) on environmental performance and
thus providing strong support for Hypothesis 1.

Evidence of moderation exists when interaction terms account for significant
incremental variances in a dependent variable, either individually, signified by the
values of the betas, or collectively, signified by the values of the changes in R2 (Baron
and Kenny, 1986; Boon-itt and Wong, 2011; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007). If the interaction
accounts for a significant amount of incremental variance in the dependent variable, this
is evidence supporting the hypothesis that the three institutional pressures have a
significant moderating effect on the given RL innovation. Following Aiken and West
(1991) and Jaccard and Turrisi (2003), we used “centered” (x ⫽ 0) moderated regression
analysis to minimize the effects of any multicollinearity among the variables comprising
our interaction terms.

To examine the moderating effect of the three institutional pressures – regulatory
(coercive) pressure, competitor (mimetic) pressure and customer (normative) pressure –
on RL innovation and environmental performance, we added these three institutional
pressures as moderator variables in Table IV, Step 3, and subsequently added the three
interaction dimensions into the regression model in Table IV, Step 4. As shown in
Table IV, Step 4, a significant increase in R2 indicates a significant improvement in
model fit over Step 3. The estimated coefficients for the interaction between the RL

innovation and the three institutional pressures are statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.01)
with the anticipated positive sign. Therefore, Hypotheses 3, 5 and 7 are supported.

4.4.2 RL innovation, economic performance and moderating effects. Table V, Step 2,
shows that the ISO 14001 certification has a positive and significant influence on
economic performance, implying that gaining the ISO 14001 certification improves
economic performance. Moreover, Table IV, Step 2, shows that being in the information
or electrical industry or being a 3C maintenance or retail store has a positive and
significant influence on economic performance, implying that there were significant
differences in economic performance among the high-tech industries of Taiwan when
divided into electrical, electronics and information industries. Table V, Step 2, tested the
impact of RL innovation on economic performance. The results show that RL innovation
has a positive and significant influence (p ⬍ 0.00) on economic performance, providing
strong support for Hypothesis 2.

Similarly, to examine the moderating effect of three institutional pressures –
regulatory (coercive), competitor (mimetic) and customer (normative) – on RL
innovation and economic performance, we added these three institutional pressures as
moderator variables in Table V, Step 3, and subsequently added the three interaction
dimensions into the regression model in Table V, Step 4. As shown in Table V, Step 4, a
significant increase in R2 indicates a significant improvement in model fit over Step 3.
The estimated coefficient for the interaction between RL innovation and regulatory
pressures is statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.05), with the anticipated negative sign.
Therefore, Hypothesis 4 is supported. Moreover, the estimated coefficient for the
interaction between RL innovation and competitor pressure is statistically significant
(p ⬍ 0.01), with the anticipated positive sign. Therefore, Hypothesis 6 is supported. The
estimated coefficient for the interaction between RL innovation and customer pressure
is not statistically significant (p ⬎ 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 8 is not supported.

5. Discussion and implications
5.1 Findings
The research provides ample evidence concerning the relationships among resource
commitment, RL capabilities and performance but inconclusive results (Daugherty
et al., 2001, 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Jack et al., 2010; Olorunniwo and Li, 2010; Richey
et al., 2005). Few studies have probed the relationship between RL innovation and
performance,
the
mechanisms that moderate the effects of institutional pressure, including regulatory
(coercive), competitor (mimetic) and customer (normative), remain largely unexamined.
Drawing on green innovation and institutional theory, we built a comprehensive
research framework and conducted a survey of 322 Taiwanese electrical, electronic and
information industry companies and 3C maintenance and retail stores. The results of
this study shed light on these mechanisms by illuminating both the directing and
moderating effects on performance. This study offers several findings.

especially regarding environmental performance. Moreover,

This study indicates that RL innovation can be viewed as one of the antecedents of
performance; RL has been found to be positively correlated to both environmental and
economic performance. These findings support the results of studies that show, for instance,
that effective RL can reduce costs (Jack et al., 2010), increase profitability (Li and
Olorunniwo, 2008), improve customer satisfaction (Daugherty et al., 2001), create customer
value (Mollenkopf et al., 2011) and enhance environmental performance (Huang et al., 2012).

Furthermore, we attempted to clarify the moderating effects of institutional pressures on
the relationships between RL innovation and two dimensions of performance. First,
regulatory pressures significantly positively moderate the relationship between RL
innovation and environmental performance and significantly negatively moderate the
relationships between RL innovation and economic performance. These findings support
the results of studies that emphasized that RL can proactively minimize the threat of
government environmental regulations and can improve a corporation’s green image
(Daugherty et al., 2001; Mollenkopf et al., 2007). The results also show that, when regulatory
pressures cause firms to execute RL innovation, the innovation results in enhanced
environmental performance but reduced economic performance. These findings are similar
to those obtained by Fineman and Clarke (1996), who stressed that a firm’s superior
capabilities allow it to more quickly and efficiently adapt to regulations and thus gain
competitive advantages. Moreover, Mollenkopf et al. (2011) emphasized that regulatory
changes seem to have a more negative impact on returns management and customer value.
Second, competitor pressure significantly and positively moderated the relationships
between RL innovation and environmental and economic performance, respectively. The
results reveal that, when competitor pressure causes firms to perform RL innovation, the
innovation produces enhanced environmental and economic performances. These findings
are similar to those in the study by Bergh (2002), who stressed that firms learn from and
respond to natural environment issues raised by their competitors. Therefore, competition
may allow firms to learn how to implement RL innovation in effective and efficient ways,
producing improved environmental and economic performance over time. Finally, customer
pressure significantly and positively moderated the relationship between RL innovation and
environmental performances but was also found it to insignificantly moderate the
relationship between RL innovation and environmental performance. These results indicate
that, when customer pressure causes firms to perform RL innovation, this innovation results
in improved environmental performance but reduced economic performance. These
findings are consistent with those in Zhu and Sarkis (2007), who argued that Chinese
manufacturers’ adoption of the eco-design practices of global supply chain management
leads to increased environmental performance but decreased economic benefits when
market (customer) pressure exists. Mollenkopf et al. (2011) also argued that external market
changes are making it harder for firms to create customer value.

5.2 Theoretical, practical and managerial implications
Several theoretical implications can be drawn from this study. First, the role of sustainable
development is an important element in understanding RL issues (Álvarez et al., 2007; de
Brito et al., 2002), which is why we used the sustainable development concept (Carter and
Rogers, 2008; Elkington, 1997; Lee and Lam, 2012), which is rarely done, to define and
conceptualize RL. Second, this study combined both the natural resource-based view (Hart,
1995, 2005) and the green innovation perspective (Christmann, 2000; Rennings, 2000) to
capture a broader notion of RL innovation and examine how it influences firms’
performance; few studies have applied the natural resource-based view to investigate how
RL innovation impacts performance. Third, we evaluated RL performance, including both
the environmental and economic dimensions, based on the requirement for sustainable
development. Fourth, previous studies have reached inconsistent findings about RL
capabilities and performance; therefore, this study linked the natural resource-based view
with institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Jennings and Zandbergen, 1995; Scott,


Logistics
innovation

2008; Suchman, 1995) to explore how institutional pressures moderate the relationship
between RL innovation and performance. Finally, we tested the moderating effect of
institutional pressures, the results revealing that the relationships between RL and
environmental performance were moderated by regulatory, competitor and customer
pressures; these findings fit the paradigm of environment, strategy and performance (Oliver,
1997). Some scholars have argued that organizational performance is a consequence of a
practical fit between two or more factors, such as that between organizational environment,
strategy, structure, systems, style and culture (Oliver, 1997). The importance of matching an
organization’s environment and strategy is one of
insights of
organizational theory literature (Oliver, 1997). Another interesting finding is that the
relationship between RL innovation and economic performance was negatively moderated
by regulatory pressure.

the fundamental

This study has practical implications as well. First, RL can incur high costs for a firm.
This study’s results demonstrate that RL innovation (for example, customization,
formalization and flexibility) can be an effective method of reducing costs effectively and
achieving better customer service. Second, although conventional wisdom regards RL as a
cost requirement that slows productivity growth and hinders competitiveness, the findings
of this study indicate that RL innovation can enhance environmental and economic
performance. Therefore, this study suggests that firms should invest more resources in
green creative solutions; for instance, improving RL information systems and technology
would lead to more sustainable environmental protection and economic performance
outcomes. Third, from the institutional view, the findings of this study are of particular
relevance to a firm’s awareness of its external environment. RL systems can help a firm
comply with regulations and environmental laws that push it to manage its RL activities
(Mollenkopf et al., 2007); such systems can help the firm satisfy customer claims and gain
legitimacy, as stressed by the institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Jennings and
Zandbergen, 1995; Scott, 2008). Therefore, this study suggests that, by appropriately
focusing their efforts on RL innovation while attending to the concerns of institutional
pressures, managers can improve environmental and economic performance. Finally, this
work has offered an Asian perspective on RL. Some industries in Taiwan, particularly the
computer and electronics sectors, have become world leaders in manufacturing. For
example, computer monitors, printed circuit boards and image scanners produced in
Taiwan account for 50 per cent of global market share (Huang and Wu, 2010). Investigating
the RL experience among Taiwanese companies provides an important example to other
developing Asian countries of how to perform RL effectively.

capabilities (Jack et al., 2010; Mollenkopf et al., 2011; Richey et al., 2005). Second, RL
involves product returns, source reduction, recycling, materials substitution, reuse of
material, waste disposal, refurbishing, repair and remanufacturing. Obviously, these
processes require communication with various internal and external departments,
customers and vendors. Hence, the results of this study suggest that managers should
ensure frequent communication, cooperation and collaboration among logistics,
production and marketing to improve RL efficiency. In addition, policy setup and
standardized procedures can help reduce conflict and confusion during RL activities.
Third, our results demonstrate that RL innovation impacts environmental and economic

performance: when managers cultivate RL innovation carefully, firms’ environmental
and economic performance can be further enhanced. Fourth, we found that investment
in a higher level of RL innovation under greater institutional pressure will not always
improve economic performance,
isomorphic institutional
pressures influence RL practices in the same way and that careful consideration of RL
innovation and the industrial contextual environment is important for managers in
these situations. Thus, we stress the importance of the institutional theory in
understanding how the relationship between managerial decisions and organizational
performance is influenced by the existence and type of thermal institutional pressures.
Finally, we found that customer pressures insignificantly moderated the relationship
between RL innovation and economic performance. However, this study suggests that
managers should continually pay attention to customer needs, as a lack of customer
pressure could weaken a firm’s environmental performance (Zhu and Sarkis, 2007) and
cause firms to lose customers, impacting economic performance.

5.3 Limitations and future research
Despite this study’s theoretical and practical contributions, it also has some limitations.
First, a single respondent from a firm was asked to respond to the survey; however, no
one person in a firm was in charge of the entire realm of RL activities. Second, the study’s
conceptual framework may require more contextual dimensions than institutional
pressures alone. Adding interaction effects among institutional pressures and more
contextual factors, such as industry complexity, environmental (Delmas and Toffel,
2008) and demand uncertainty (Boon-itt and Wong, 2011) and organizational structure
(Mollenkopf et al., 2011), may explain more variance, and their inclusion would be
discreet. Furthermore, the validity of our results may be limited to contexts specific to
RL practice and strategy in Taiwan. Third, this study integrated green innovation and
institutional theory to consider performance effects. Future research needs to consider
both stakeholder theory (Álvarez et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-Benito,
2006) and other internal factors, such as organizational characteristics (Delmas and
Toffel, 2008), culture (Mollenkopf et al., 2011), managerial strategic posture (Álvarez
et al., 2007) and dynamic capabilities (Huang et al., 2012). Fourth, despite our best efforts,
common method bias through the use of single respondents in our data collection may
not have been completely eliminated. Future study needs to consider multiple
respondents from each plant whenever possible. Fifth, RL innovation contains five
components, one of which is cross-functional
integration; however, we gathered
information from individuals in the marketing, production and logistics departments
only. Future study requires a marketing-operations interface from both parts of the
cross-functional departments during data collection. Finally, this study focused on the
economic and environmental aspects of RL activities. Future study should use the RL
perspective on social sustainability (Sarkis et al., 2010) to explore and test RL issues
from sustainability’s environmental, social and economic angles.
