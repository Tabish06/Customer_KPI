Intellectual capital (IC) offers a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage and is
believed to be the font from which technological development and economic growth may spring.
This study proposes a three-dimensional framework for describing and measuring a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs IC
that includes human capital, intellectual property, and reputational capital. Drawing upon the
resource-based view of the Ô¨Årm, it is argued that in high-technology new ventures (HTNVs) IC
assets offer a unique source of advantage that facilitates entrepreneurship by reducing the risk
and increasing the returns from investments in innovation and venturing. This paper reports the
results of an empirical study of 237 HTNVs in the US that issued an initial public offering
between 1994 and 1998. It is found that these Ô¨Årms‚Äô top management team human capital
diversity and organizational reputation are of greatest signiÔ¨Åcance for their entrepreneurial
performance. Interestingly, these factors far outweigh the insigniÔ¨Åcant effect observed for
intellectual property on subsequent innovation and venturing activities. The implications for
theory and practice are discussed.

1. Introduction

H igh-technology new ventures (HTNVs) have

played a major role in the creation and
growth of today‚Äôs economy. New Ô¨Årms‚Äô success
stems from their resourcefulness, innovativeness,
and commitment to entrepreneurship that allow
them to deÔ¨Åne their competitive arena (Christen-
sen, 1997; Zahra and Bogner, 2000). In creating
many of the industries that deÔ¨Åne the new econ-
omy, HTNVs have been especially adept at em-
ploying their intellectual capital (IC) in ways that
spur corporate entrepreneurship throughout their
operations. Corporate entrepreneurship refers to
innovation and corporate venturing activities ‚Äì
new business entry achieved by expanding the
Ô¨Årm‚Äôs operations into new or existing product
markets (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990; Block and

MacMillan, 1993). Corporate entrepreneurship is
positively associated with superior Ô¨Ånancial per-
formance, particularly for Ô¨Årms operating in
rapidly changing, highly competitive environ-
ments (e.g. Zahra and Covin, 1995; Chandler
et al., 2000; Antoncic and Hisrich, 2001; Lo¬® o¬® f
and Heshmati, 2002).

Innovation and venturing activities involve
substantial risks, but also have the potential for
extraordinary returns. By leveraging their IC,
HTNVs can enhance the probability of success
in entrepreneurial activities, thus reducing the
perceived risk, while increasing their potential
payoff. However, there is an ongoing debate on
what constitutes IC. In general, deÔ¨Ånitions tend to
be broad and focus upon the intangible aspect of
IC. For example, Youndt (1998, p. 15) suggests,
‚ÄòAn organization‚Äôs IC is the aggregate stocks and

information,

Despite the widespread recognition of the impor-
tance of IC for promoting entrepreneurship among
new ventures, this issue has not been the focus of
empirical validation. Theory development, however,
underscores the critical importance of IC within
organizations (e.g. Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998).
This study seeks to Ô¨Åll this gap in the literature. It
invokes the resource-based view of the Ô¨Årm (Wer-
nerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991), which suggests that
control of unique and inimitable knowledge-based
resources enhances Ô¨Årm performance (Grant, 1996;
Lei et al., 1996; Spender, 1996).

A major part of an organization‚Äôs knowledge is
embodied in its IC (Edvinsson and Malone,
1997). We propose that control of such knowl-
edge-based resources can change the perceived
risks and rewards associated with entrepreneurial
actions. Unique resources embodied in IC give
new ventures an advantage by enabling them to
enter new markets, create superior products, and
garner Ô¨Årst mover advantages. If this is the case,
then we can expect the high-technology Ô¨Årm‚Äôs
stock of IC to be positively associated with its
level of corporate entrepreneurship.

This study empirically examines the relation-
ship between IC and entrepreneurial behavior of
HTNVs. The value of this study is twofold. First,
the focus is upon high-technology industries that
form the backbone of the new economy. This
study links IC to a venture‚Äôs entrepreneurial
activities, which are crucial for survival in high-
technology industries. Competition in these in-
dustries is knowledge-based and our study of IC,
therefore, provides a greater understanding of one
of the major sources of competition. Although
Ô¨Årms in high-technology industries tend to exhibit
more signs of entrepreneurship (i.e. high rates of
innovation and frequent venturing activities), not
all high-technology ventures are equally entrepre-
neurial. It is therefore important to understand
factors that are supportive of corporate entrepre-
neurship within this population of Ô¨Årms. Second,
there has been limited research into IC and its
outcomes. This study highlights dimensions of IC
and relates them to corporate entrepreneurship.
Taken together, this study informs the strategic

management literature on the factors that consti-
tute IC and their impact on entrepreneurial be-
havior in HTNVs.

2. Theory and hypotheses

The literature contains a number of deÔ¨Ånitions of
IC. While to some extent there is convergence of
these deÔ¨Ånitions, they also differ in substantial
ways. We suggest that the variety of deÔ¨Ånitions
is largely because of categorization of the assets
that comprise IC. These assets include human
capital, intellectual property, relationships with
external stakeholders, and ‚Äòstructural capital‚Äô
(organizational structure,
information systems,
etc.) (Table 1).

In this study, it is proposed that there are three
distinct sets of assets: human capital, intellectual
property, and reputational capital. The Ô¨Årm‚Äôs
structural capital (also referred to as infrastruc-
ture assets or relational capital) is the one asset
type that seems to cause the most confusion
among the conceptualizations of
IC. Some
authors combine intellectual property and corpo-
rate reputation in the structural capital dimension
(e.g. Edvinsson and Malone, 1997; Roos et al.,
1998). Sveiby (1997) and Youndt (1998) combine
organizational administrative systems with intel-
lectual property rights under the heading of
‚Äòinternal structure‚Äô or ‚Äòorganizational capital.‚Äô
Others limit the deÔ¨Ånition to aspects of the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs
infrastructure (e.g. organizational structure, com-
munication systems, culture, etc.) (e.g. Brooking,
1996).

It is essential to distinguish between knowledge
embodied in a particular form (i.e. human capital,
intellectual property, stakeholder perceptions of
corporate reputation) and the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs ability to
combine knowledge to generate value. Structural
capital represents those routines and processes
directed at integrating the various types of embo-
died knowledge at the organizational level (e.g.
Brooking, 1996). Structural capital such as orga-
nizational culture, organizational structure, and
information systems leverages individual knowl-
edge and makes it organizational (Stewart, 1997).
This distinction is similar to that made by Nelson
and Winter (1982) in their discussion of the
hierarchy of organizational routines. In this hier-
archy, individual knowledge and skills are lower
order routines that are leveraged and integrated
through high-order organizational coordination
mechanisms (Nelson and Winter, 1982; see also,
Floyd and Wooldridge, 1999).

It is desirable that in addition to maintaining
conceptual clarity between the dimensions of IC,
any deÔ¨Ånition should recognize the distinction
between component competencies such as stocks
of knowledge and dynamic capabilities that inte-

grate these components to create value. By doing
so, it is possible to also maintain a clear distinc-
tion between an organization‚Äôs IC and its ability
to exploit this resource. This approach is consis-
tent with the hierarchical view of resources and

capabilities (Nelson and Winter, 1982), with the
notion of potential versus realized capabilities
(Zahra and George, 2002), and with the theore-
tical model of intangible resources proposed by
Hall (1992; 1993). Hall argues that intangible
resources represent the ‚Äòfeedstock‚Äô of the capabil-
ity differentials of Ô¨Årms that in turn result in
sustainable competitive advantage. To include
structural capital within the deÔ¨Ånition of IC,
therefore, confuses the distinction between re-
sources as feedstock, and the capabilities that
they ‚Äòfeed.‚Äô Therefore, we deÔ¨Åne IC as ‚Äòa bundle
of organizational resources comprised of human
capital, intellectual property, and reputational ca-
pital that are tangible and intangible in nature and
can be leveraged to create value.‚Äô

2.1. Human capital and entrepreneurship

Human capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and
abilities of employees. Hambrick and Mason
(1984) posit that the cognitive resources and
values of members of the top management team
have a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence upon a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs strategic
choices. This occurs because the cognitive re-
sources, experiences, and values of top managers
determine how those individuals perceive and
interpret environmental and organizational sti-
muli. Furthermore, managerial values also will
inÔ¨Çuence which strategic alternatives are pursued.
Therefore, observable characteristics
such as
career experiences and education inÔ¨Çuence the
decision making of
teams
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984). In addition, the
relative characteristics of the individuals in a top
management team, such as heterogeneity of edu-
cational background, will also inÔ¨Çuence group
decision-making processes and, therefore, Ô¨Årm
strategy and performance (Smith et al., 1994;
Simons et al., 1999).

top management

Collectively, evidence indicates that the indus-
try experience, education, and other credentials of
the founding entrepreneur and top management
team are associated with the success of new
ventures (e.g. MacMillan et al., 1987; Stuart and
Abetti, 1990; Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Cooper
et al., 1994; Honig, 1998). This may occur as a
result of the inÔ¨Çuence of human capital upon
decision making and creativity. From the per-
spective of decision-making processes, greater
cognitive resources aid problem identiÔ¨Åcation,
formulation, exploration, and problem solving
(e.g. Bantel and Jackson, 1989). A broader cog-
nitive base increases the range of alternative

the impact of

problem deÔ¨Ånitions, the range of possible solu-
tions, and the combination of information. There
is empirical support for the proposition that
individual characteristics such as education, in-
telligence, and cognitive style are associated with
both creativity (e.g. Amabile, 1983; Woodman
and Schoenfeldt, 1989; Oldham and Cummings,
1996) and receptivity to innovative ideas (e.g.
Rogers and Shoemaker, 1971; Kimberly and
Evanisko, 1981). In sum,
top
manager characteristics upon the entrepreneurial
orientation of HTNVs will be signiÔ¨Åcant because
of their position as key decision makers and
members of the organization versus ‚Äòdominant
coalition‚Äô (Cyert and March, 1963). The domi-
nant coalition is expected to be particularly im-
portant in HTNVs because of their typically small
size as compared with established organizations.
In their study on top management teams in US
banks, Bantel and Jackson (1989) report that the
level of innovation was positively associated with
teams that were more educated and more hetero-
geneous with respect to their functional back-
grounds. Similarly, Wiersema and Bantel (1992)
found that the top management team‚Äôs level of
education in general, their level of education in
scientiÔ¨Åc disciplines, and their diversity in terms
of educational specialization were all positively
associated with the propensity to change corpo-
rate strategy. These arguments indicate that the
depth and breadth of the expertise and other
human capital characteristics of the top manage-
ment team are a major organizational resource.
Therefore, it is expected that the human capital of
the management team will have a signiÔ¨Åcant
inÔ¨Çuence upon the entrepreneurial behavior of
HTNVs. Hence, we posit that:

Hypothesis 1a: Stock of human capital in the top
management team will positively inÔ¨Çu-
ence innovation among HTNVs.

Hypothesis 1b: Stock of human capital in the top
management team will positively inÔ¨Çu-
ence venturing among HTNVs.

the aggregate characteristics of

In addition to considering the additive effects
of the stock of the top management team human
capital,
these
groups‚Äô human capital can be expected to be
signiÔ¨Åcant for both innovation and venturing
(e.g. Guzzo and Shea, 1992). An important ag-
gregate characteristic of a group is diversity or
heterogeneity. Blau (1977) has suggested that
heterogeneity of a group can be quantiÔ¨Åed by
2), where p represents
pi

group. In the present context, we expect that
diversity in terms of educational background
and functional experience will have an important
impact upon creativity, innovativeness, and the
range of opportunities for corporate venturing
that this group perceives. Research by Bantel and
colleagues, using Blau‚Äôs
formula, has
shown that top management team diversity is
associated with both innovation and Ô¨Çexibility
(Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Wiersema and Bantel,
1992).

(1977)

Human capital diversity in top management
teams is likely to have a positive association with
both innovation and venturing because diversity
inÔ¨Çuences triggers for knowledge search and or-
ganizational
learning processes. When perfor-
mance gaps are perceived, the top management
team triggers organizational learning and seeks to
identify sources of new information. When top
management team human capital
is diverse in
terms of education and experience, a wider range
of cognitive frames are used to identify perfor-
mance gaps and a broader spectrum of sources of
new knowledge are considered (Weick, 1995).

In addition, the wider range of cognitive frames
will also broaden the knowledge search process
and promote the creativity and opportunity re-
cognition that results from the process of bisocia-
tion. Bisociation depends on the perception of an
idea or piece of knowledge from two distinct
and incompatible perspectives (Koestler, 1966).
When a top management team is diverse in terms
of educational and functional background, they
will be more likely to consider a piece of new
knowledge from diverse and incompatible per-
spectives. As a result, the team will be more
creative in its interpretation of the meaning of
this new knowledge. Empirical studies of group
problem solving support this view that group
diversity is associated with greater creativity
(e.g. Wanous and Yountz, 1986; Guzzo and
Shea, 1992). The above discussion suggests that
the diversity of the top management team‚Äôs edu-
cational and functional backgrounds will enhance
innovation and venturing activities by triggering
learning and facilitating knowledge acquisition
and transformation. We therefore propose the
following hypotheses:

Intellectual capital and corporate entrepreneurship

2.2. Intellectual property and

entrepreneurship

Intellectual property is deÔ¨Åned as legally protected
rights concerning ownership of speciÔ¨Åc intellectual
assets such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
trade secrets. Organizations accumulate intellec-
tual property either through internal development
(e.g. research and development (R&D) in the
case of patents) or through knowledge acquired
through external relationships. There is strong
evidence that internal R&D efforts result in in-
tellectual property indicated by patents (e.g. Chak-
rabarti and Lenard, 1993; Griliches, 1998). The
second source of intellectual property is the knowl-
edge acquired by the Ô¨Årm from external relation-
ships. For example, new ideas obtained from
customers, suppliers, or competitors are an impor-
tant source of innovation and intellectual property
(e.g. Mueller, 1962; von Hippel, 1988). Scholars
have suggested that without internal R&D efforts
a Ô¨Årm will be unable to recognize, assimilate, and
commercially apply new external knowledge (Co-
hen and Levinthal, 1990). Thus, while external
relationships represent an important source of
ideas, the creation of new intellectual property
will ultimately depend on a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs absorptive capa-
city that, in turn, is a function of prior investments
in R&D (Zahra and George, 2002).

Regardless of the form, or source, intellectual
property represents a proprietary technological
advantage (Porter, 1980) that may enable a Ô¨Årm
to proactively enter a new market or implement
new process technologies before its competitors.
Patents create barriers to entry for competitors
(Porter, 1980) and increase the ability of the Ô¨Årm
to obtain a return on its investment in R&D.
Therefore, intellectual property is expected to posi-
tively alter the risk/reward ratio associated with
innovation and venturing into new markets. Pa-
tents also signal a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs technological capabilities
and therefore increase access to resources such as
Ô¨Ånancial capital and alliance partners (Deeds et al.,
1997). Intellectual property rights also enable a
Ô¨Årm to secure future revenues from their invest-
ment in product or process innovations (Karakaya
and Kobu, 1994). Given the empirical support for
the positive impact of intellectual property on Ô¨Årm
resource acquisition and deployment, we posit that:

Hypothesis 2a: Diversity of human capital in the
top management team will positively
inÔ¨Çuence innovation among HTNVs.

Hypothesis 2b: Diversity of human capital in the
top management team will positively
inÔ¨Çuence venturing among HTNVs.

Hypothesis 3a: Stock of intellectual property will
positively inÔ¨Çuence innovation among
HTNVs.

Hypothesis 3b: Stock of intellectual property will
positively inÔ¨Çuence venturing among
HTNVs.

2.3. Reputational capital and

entrepreneurship

A Ô¨Årm‚Äôs reputation represents a third dimension
of IC that is expected to be positively associated
with the entrepreneurial behavior of HTNVs.
Reputation is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äòa perceptual representa-
tion of a company‚Äôs past actions and future
prospects that describes the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs overall appeal
to all of its key constituents when compared with
other leading rivals‚Äô (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72). Re-
putation has an important inÔ¨Çuence upon stake-
holder beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors when
these groups have incomplete information con-
cerning organizational characteristics of interest
(Weigelt and Camerer, 1988).

The rationale for the inÔ¨Çuence of reputation upon
stakeholder behavior is derived from information
economics, speciÔ¨Åcally game theory (e.g. Weigelt
and Camerer, 1988) and signaling theory (e.g.
Wernerfelt, 1988). The key to game theory models
is that each player has a set of privately known
information that reÔ¨Çects their distinct characteristics
(Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). In the case of Ô¨Årms,
this private information includes such things as
strategic preferences, plant capacity, and the quality
of products (e.g. Milgrom and Roberts, 1986).
These characteristics therefore inÔ¨Çuence the prefer-
ences and future behaviors of the organization, for
example the extent to which strict product quality
will be maintained. Fombrun and Shanley (1990)
suggest a number of potential signals that inÔ¨Çuence
reputation with a range of stakeholders: market
signals (market performance, market risk, dividend
policy); accounting signals (accounting proÔ¨Åtability,
accounting risk); institutional signals (institutional
ownership, social responsibility, media visibility,
Ô¨Årm size); and strategy signals (differentiation, di-
versiÔ¨Åcation posture). The role of reputational sig-
nals is to reduce uncertainty as to whether explicit
and implicit contractual claims will be fulÔ¨Ålled
(Cornell and Shapiro, 1987). Therefore, reputation
has the effect of increasing the attractiveness of an
exchange relationship (Smith, 1992; Erdem, 1998).
A positive reputation also reduces the transac-
tion costs associated with an exchange. For ex-
ample, when uncertainty concerning the ability of
the Ô¨Årm to fulÔ¨Åll its implicit and explicit claims is
reduced, the need to specify all potential contin-
gencies in a formal contract is also reduced. This
will reduce the contracting costs for both parties
(Williamson, 1975) and, therefore, will reduce a
Ô¨Årm‚Äôs costs with respect to acquiring resources.
Similarly, when stakeholder perceptions of un-
certainty are reduced, the need to monitor the

relationship is reduced (Williamson, 1975). The
net result of positive reputation signals is to
increase the availability of resources, reduce the
cost of acquiring resources, and increase the
Ô¨Årm‚Äôs Ô¨Çexibility in the acquisition and disposal
of resources. All things equal, potential stake-
holders will seek to contract with the Ô¨Årm with the
best reputation. Therefore, a positive reputation
reduces the cost of attracting customers, inves-
tors, and suppliers (e.g. Beatty, 1989; Michaely
and Shaw, 1995; Xin and Pearce, 1996; Lovett
et al., 1999).

In the case of HTNVs, stakeholders have im-
perfect information concerning the outcomes of
an exchange with the Ô¨Årm: customers are uncer-
tain of product quality; investors are uncertain of
the risk of an investment; suppliers are uncertain
that an organization will reliably fulÔ¨Åll its con-
tractual obligations. By changing stakeholder
perceptions of uncertainty regarding the out-
comes of an exchange with the organization,
reputation reduces the perceived risk of the ex-
change. Ceteris paribus, reduced perceived risk,
increases the propensity of stakeholders to enter
into an exchange with the Ô¨Årm. Furthermore,
contracting costs such as detailed speciÔ¨Åcation
of explicit obligations and monitoring of the
relationship are reduced. The result is an increase
in the availability of resources (i.e. sales, invest-
ment capital, raw materials), a reduction in the
cost of resources, and an increase in the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs
Ô¨Çexibility to acquire and dispose of resources. As
entrepreneurial behavior is a ‚Äòresource consuming
posture‚Äô (Covin and Slevin, 1991, p. 15; see also,
Romanelli, 1987; Guth and Ginsberg, 1990) and
HTNVs themselves have very high resource re-
quirements (e.g. Greene and Brown, 1997), repu-
tation is likely to be positively associated with
entrepreneurial behavior because it helps reduce
these resource constraints. Therefore, we posit:

Hypothesis 4a: Stock of reputational capital will
positively inÔ¨Çuence innovation among
HTNVs.

Hypothesis 4b: Stock of reputational capital will
positively inÔ¨Çuence venturing among
HTNVs.

3. Data and methods

3.1. Sample

All data in this study were obtained from second-
ary sources. Four criteria were used to identify the

142

R&D Management 35, 2, 2005

r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005


Ô¨Årms to be included in the sample. First, the Ô¨Årm
should have undergone an initial public offering
(IPO) of stock in the US during the period 1994‚Äì
1998. Second, it must not have been incorporated
more than 6 years prior to its IPO, thereby
qualifying as a ‚Äònew venture.‚Äô Third, the company
should have remained in business as an indepen-
dent entity for a minimum of 2 years following its
IPO (in order to obtain data on entrepreneur-
ship). Fourth, the Ô¨Årm should compete in one of
the industries deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äòhigh-technology.‚Äô

A two-step process was used to identify high-
technology industries. First, we identiÔ¨Åed those
industries with average R&D expenditures greater
than 5 percent of sales (Littler and Sweeting,
1990). This list was compared with those pub-
lished by the American Electronics Association,
Bureau of the Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (Walcott, 2001). Only when an
industry was identiÔ¨Åed as high tech by four out of
Ô¨Åve of these sources was it included in the sample.
All IPOs in the period 1994‚Äì1998 were identiÔ¨Åed
from announcements in the Investment Dealers
Digest. The Ô¨Årms in high-technology industries
issuing IPO‚Äôs were then screened to identify those
6 years old or less, based upon the year of incor-
poration obtained from Standard and Poors Cor-
porate Descriptions. A Ô¨Ånal step was to screen for
those Ô¨Årms that existed as an independent entity 2
years following the year of IPO using data from
Standard and Poors Research Insight database.
Firms that were either unsuccessful, that had
ceased to operate as a public company, or that
were acquired during this period were deleted from
the study. As public data on these excluded Ô¨Årms
are limited, it is not possible to assess the extent to
which these Ô¨Årms differ from those in the Ô¨Ånal
sample. However, as the reasons for exclusion
from the sample include both success (i.e. acquisi-
tion) and failure, we do not have reason to believe
that these excluded Ô¨Årms bias the results reported
below. The Ô¨Ånal sample size was 237 Ô¨Årms identi-
Ô¨Åed as HTNVs.

3.2. Measures

3.2.1. Dependent variables.
In order to test for
the causality implied in our hypotheses, the de-
pendent variables were all measured with a 2-year
lag following the IPO. Entrepreneurship is deÔ¨Å-
ned as combining innovation and venturing activ-
ities. Measures and their sources are described
below.

Intellectual capital and corporate entrepreneurship

Innovation is measured by the number of new
products, services, and processes and the number
of radical products, services, and processes pro-
duced by a company. The degree to which new
products or services are radical versus incremen-
tal reÔ¨Çects the degree of risk that a Ô¨Årm is willing
to accept (Henderson and Clark, 1990). Data for
these measures were obtained from company
press releases published on Businesswire and PR
Newswire. This measure is consistent with prior
studies utilizing survey measures of innovation
(e.g. Miller and Friesen, 1982; Covin and Slevin,
1991; Zahra, 1993; Zahra and Covin, 1995).
Literature-based measures of innovative output
have been found to be a reliable and valid
approach to measuring this aspect of corporate
entrepreneurship in a range of contexts (e.g.
Chandy and Tellis, 2000; Coombs et al., 1996;
Santarelli and Piergiovanni, 1996; Walker et al.,
2002).

Venturing is indicated by entry into new in-
dustries and business segments through extend-
ing operations, engaging in joint activities with
other organizations, or acquiring other compa-
nies that operate in different industry segments or
markets, or offer different products (e.g. Block
and MacMillan, 1993). Indicators of venturing
activities are the number of acquisitions and the
number of joint ventures or strategic alliances.
These data were obtained from company press
releases (source: Businesswire, PR Newswire).
This is consistent with the operationalization of
venturing activity in prior research on corporate
entrepreneurship (e.g. Zahra, 1996).

3.2.2. Independent variables. Three dimensions
of IC are measured using secondary data from
IPO prospectuses (Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC), EDGAR Database), the US Pa-
tent and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce database, and
company press releases.

Following past research (Bantel and Jackson,
1989), indicators of both the tangible and intan-
gible aspects of human capital include the average
number of advanced degrees held, the diversity of
educational backgrounds (business, science, or hu-
manities), the average number of advanced degrees
in science, the diversity of functional backgrounds
(technical versus non-technical), and the number of
years of experience in similar industries. Diversity
was assessed using Blau‚Äôs (1977) index of hetero-
geneity. This index is formulated as (1 Epi2),
where p is the proportion of group members in
each category and i is the number of different
categories.

These variables indicate the human capital of
the top management team at the point of IPO.
These data were obtained from the IPO prospec-
tuses obtained from the SEC. Firms registering
with the SEC to issue an IPO are required to
include within their prospectus a section listing,
entitled ‚ÄòManagement ‚Äì Executive OfÔ¨Åcers and
Directors,‚Äô which lists the members of the board
of directors and the top management team, their
formal educational qualiÔ¨Åcations and relevant
industry experience. This information contributes
to the market‚Äôs perceived value of
the Ô¨Årm.
Therefore, ventures are expected to report all
relevant education and experience. Prior studies
of top management teams and new ventures have
frequently used this data source (e.g. Beatty and
Zajac, 1994; McGee and Dowling, 1994). The
reliability of this data source is enhanced by the
strict reporting requirements and potential penal-
ties for presenting false information (Beatty and
Zajac, 1994).

The intellectual property controlled by a Ô¨Årm
includes patents, trade secrets, and copyrights.
Patent data obtained from the US Patent and
Trademark OfÔ¨Åce database
(www.uspto.gov)
were used to indicate the intellectual property
controlled by the Ô¨Årm. Data were obtained on
both patents applied for and patents granted
prior to IPO. As the Ô¨Årms are all young and the
process of granting patents is relatively long, the
count of patents granted prior to IPO was sig-
niÔ¨Åcantly smaller than that for patent applica-
tions. Furthermore, as patent information is an
indicator of the underlying stock of IC held by the
Ô¨Årm, patent applications are arguably just as valid
an indicator of this stock as would be patents
granted. The distinction more accurately reÔ¨Çects
whether the stock of knowledge is uniquely pos-
sessed by the patent applicant. In the analyses
below, we focus on patents applied for by the
Ô¨Årms in our sample (the results are the same for
both measures). The measure is the sum of all
patent applications up to the year of IPO. This
measure is consistent with prior patent research
(Narin and Olivastro, 1992; Griliches, 1998).

Past research into corporate reputations sug-
gests that Ô¨Ånancial and accounting measures of
risk and performance, product/service price, ad-
vertising and media visibility are all important
signals that
inÔ¨Çuence stakeholder perceptions
(e.g. Milgrom and Roberts, 1986; Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990). Because of the relatively short life
and relatively limited Ô¨Ånancial performance of
new ventures, in this study we focus upon media
exposure, indicated by the average of the number

of media reports (not including press releases
issued by the organization itself) in the 3 years
prior to IPO (source: Businesswire and PR News-
wire). News reports have been used in prior
research into corporate reputation (e.g. Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990).

3.2.3. Control variables. Three control measures
were included in the analysis: (1) company age at
IPO in years; (2) company size (log of assets); and
(3) industry type. These data were obtained from
Standard and Poors Research Insight.

Following Chandler and Hanks (1998), Ô¨Årm
age was controlled because of its potential inÔ¨Çu-
ence upon a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs growth rate. Growth may be
associated with the rate at which new products
are announced and new ventures are pursued. In
this study, age was measured at date of IPO. Data
on date of incorporation were from Standard and
Poors Corporate Descriptions.

McGee and Dowling (1994) suggest that Ô¨Årm
size is expected to inÔ¨Çuence organizational learn-
ing. Zahra (1996) also suggests the need to control
for the inÔ¨Çuence of Ô¨Årm size because of
its
potential inÔ¨Çuence upon corporate entrepreneur-
ship. The association between size and corporate
entrepreneurship is expected to be curvilinear
(e.g. Kimberly and Evanisko, 1981; Bantel and
Jackson, 1989). Therefore, Ô¨Årm size was measured
as the logarithm of the total assets of the Ô¨Årm.
The data were from Standard and Poors Research
Insight.

As a Ô¨Ånal control variable, Ô¨Årms were categor-
ized by industry. Drawing upon work by Kodama
(1992) and Kotabe and Swan (1995), classiÔ¨Åcation
was based upon the distinction between service
industries, and Type M and Type B manufactur-
ing Ô¨Årms. Type M industries produce products
that are primarily assembled from electronic and
mechanical components; and Type B industries
produce products that are created at the molecu-
lar level and are the result of genetic engineering
and biochemistry (biotechnology, pharmaceutical
and chemical products). Software manufacturers,
technology consultants, and contract research
organizations represent service industries, re-
ferred to here as Type S industries. The signiÔ¨Å-
cance of this distinction in the present study is
that Type M products have weaker patent protec-
tion, while Type B products have more effective
patent protection (Levin et al., 1987). More
generally, we expect that this classiÔ¨Åcation will
capture any signiÔ¨Åcant variation in the value or
use of the three dimensions of IC that are the
focus of this study. ClassiÔ¨Åcation was based upon

144

the Standard Industrial ClassiÔ¨Åcation (SIC) code
for each Ô¨Årm‚Äôs primary products. The source for
these data was Standard and Poors Research
Insight.

3.3. Analysis

The scores on measures of innovation and ventur-
ing variables were combined to create composite
variables for each dimension. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the
number of new products and the number of new
products coded as radical were summed to pro-
vide an indicator of innovation. Similarly, the
number of joint ventures and the number of
acquisitions were summed to provide a composite
indicator of venturing activity.

Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical re-
gression analysis, with separate models for each
of the dependent variables. In Equation (1), we
entered the control measures. In Equation (2), we
entered the human capital variables. In Equation
(3), we entered the intellectual property measure.
In Equation (4), we entered the reputational
capital measure. After each equation, we noted
the change in adjusted R2 and the signiÔ¨Åcance of
change in the F-statistic.

4. Results

Means, standard deviations, and correlations
among the study‚Äôs variables are summarized in
Table 2. Of the seven measures of IC, the number
of degrees in science, educational diversity, and
media exposure had signiÔ¨Åcant correlations with
the outcomes of innovation and venturing.

The results of the hierarchical regression ana-
lyses of innovation and venturing on the measures
of IC are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
In these analyses,
the control variables were
entered Ô¨Årst, followed by human capital, intellec-
tual property, and reputational capital measures.
All models of innovation regressed on the IC
measures were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. With re-
spect to the innovation measure, in addition to
the control variables Ô¨Årm age at IPO and log of
assets, the dummy variables for industry Types M
or B were signiÔ¨Åcant throughout the hierarchical
analysis, with the exception of the Ô¨Ånal model.
This suggests that these relationships may vary
across industry types.

The second model in Table 3 adds the human
capital measures to the analysis. The addition of
these variables resulted in a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant

One of the Ô¨Åve human capital measures ‚Äì educa-
tional diversity ‚Äì was signiÔ¨Åcant (Po0.01). This
indicates support for Hypothesis 2a but not 1a.
The third model in Table 3 added the intellectual
property measure ‚Äì patents applied for ‚Äì to the
analysis. This did not result in a signiÔ¨Åcant change
to R2 for the overall model. Therefore, there is no
support for Hypothesis 3a. In the Ô¨Ånal model in
Table 3, the measure of reputational capital ‚Äì
media exposure ‚Äì was added to the analysis. This
in R2
resulted
(DR2¬º 0.18; F¬º 48.702; Po0.001). The signiÔ¨Å-
cance of the b coefÔ¨Åcient for media exposure
(Po0.01) provides support for Hypothesis 4a.

The results of the hierarchical regression of
venturing on IC are shown in Table 4. All models
were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. In model one, the
dummy variables for industry type were statisti-
cally signiÔ¨Åcant,
indicating that these relation-
ships may vary across industry segments. With
respect to model two, in which human capital
measures were added, there was a statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant change in R2 (DR2¬º 0.058; F¬º 2.528;
Po0.05). However, as for innovation, only the
educational diversity variable was signiÔ¨Åcant.
This result therefore provides support for Hy-
pothesis 2b but not 1b. In model three, patent
applications were added to the analysis. The
inclusion of this variable did not result in a
signiÔ¨Åcant change in R2. Therefore, there is no
support for Hypothesis 3b. In the Ô¨Ånal model,
media exposure was added. This resulted in a
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant change in R2 (DR2¬º 0.206;
F¬º 59.450; Po0.001). These results are suppor-
tive of Hypothesis 4b.

Taken together, the hierarchical regression re-
sults provide no support for Hypotheses 1a and
1b, the relationship between the amount of hu-
man capital in the top management team and a
Ô¨Årm‚Äôs innovation and venturing activities. How-
ever, the results do support Hypotheses 2a and
2b, which proposed a relationship between the
diversity of human capital and measures of cor-
porate entrepreneurship. There is also good sup-
port for Hypotheses 4a and 4b, which proposed a
relationship between reputational capital and
subsequent entrepreneurial behaviors. Hypoth-
eses 3a and 3b, that intellectual property would
be associated with innovation and venturing, did
not receive any support in this analysis.

Because of the consistent signiÔ¨Åcance of the
control variables for industry type, it is instructive
to explore the data further by industry type.
Therefore, we conducted additional post hoc ana-

lyses involving hierarchical regression analysis of
innovation and venturing on the IC measures for
each industry type. These results indicate some
systematic differences across industry categories.
However, given the modest sample sizes for each
industry group, these analyses should be inter-
preted with caution. The results are summarized
in Table 5.

The Ô¨Årst three columns of Table 5 summarize
the regression of innovation upon IC across the
three industry types. The results were substan-
tially different from the previous analysis. The
overall models were signiÔ¨Åcant for both innova-
tion and venturing when applied to the Type M
(Po0.001) and Type S Ô¨Årms (Po0.001). How-
ever, the results for Type B Ô¨Årms were only
marginally signiÔ¨Åcant for innovation (Po0.10)
and not signiÔ¨Åcant for venturing. The results for
the type M Ô¨Årms were most revealing, with only
the variable advanced degrees in science failing to
achieve signiÔ¨Åcance. Both patents applied for
Po0.01) and media exposure (Po0.001) were
signiÔ¨Åcantly related to innovation. However,
three coefÔ¨Åcients ‚Äì the number of advanced
degrees, functional diversity, and patents ‚Äì have
a negative sign. With respect to the Type S Ô¨Årms,
the only signiÔ¨Åcant measure of IC associated with
innovation was media exposure (Po0.001).

A similar effect is seen in the regressions of
venturing on IC across the three industry types.
In this case, fewer variables achieve signiÔ¨Åcance,
and the pattern of signiÔ¨Åcant variables was some-
what different from those for innovation. For
Type M Ô¨Årms, coefÔ¨Åcients for advanced degrees
in science
exposure
(Po0.05) were positive, while functional diversity
is negative (Po0.05). Taken together, these re-
sults provide some additional support for all six
hypotheses, with the strongest results being ob-
served within the subsample of Type M Ô¨Årms
(n¬º 77). The next section presents a discussion of
these results along with implications for practice.

5. Discussion and contributions

The results of this study provide support for our
argument that the dimensions of IC will positively
inÔ¨Çuence corporate entrepreneurship by HTNVs.
The fact that the measurement of independent
variables was chronologically prior to measures
of the dependent variables strengthens our infer-
ences regarding causality. This study suggests that
at least two of the three dimensions of IC are
related to innovation and venturing for all

HTNVs: reputational capital, indicated by media
exposure; and human capital, indicated by educa-
tional diversity and in certain industries, the
extent of advanced scientiÔ¨Åc education of the
top management team. There is no support for
the association between intellectual property and
subsequent innovation and venturing for HTNVs
in our sample.

Drawing on prior literature, we examined Ô¨Åve
aspects of human capital that reÔ¨Çect three types of
information: level of formal education, the less
tangible aspect reÔ¨Çected by industry experience,
and the heterogeneity of perspectives indicated by
functional and educational diversity. Of these
measures, only educational diversity was signiÔ¨Å-
cantly associated with our entrepreneurial out-
come variables for all HTNVs. However, this
variable was important for both innovation and
venturing. It is interesting that diversity but not
level of top management human capital are re-
lated to the innovative performance of organiza-
tions. Given that organizational learning tends to
be a group activity, involving interactive knowl-
edge creation and sharing, it is likely that different
perspectives that result from a heterogeneous
group enhance the creative problem solving pro-
cess. Diverse human capital also implies diverse
sources of social capital and access to a broader
range of social and professional networks from
which new ideas can be acquired and integrated
into the organization. Therefore, in the context of
HTNVs, we Ô¨Ånd support for an idea long ob-
served in group dynamics research: diversity en-

hances creativity at the level of the collective. In
terms of corporate entrepreneurship, top manage-
ment team diversity has a positive inÔ¨Çuence on
both innovation and venturing activities.

Reputational capital was also a signiÔ¨Åcant pre-
dictor of subsequent innovation and venturing
activity for all HTNVs. Similar results were
achieved with both Ô¨Årm initiated Public Relations
(PR) activity and with the media exposure that
was reported here. This provides strong support
for the contention that by generating a positive
reputation, HTNVs reduce the risks that potential
stakeholders (investors, customers, employees,
suppliers) perceive in establishing a relationship
with a new, unproven organization. Reputation
serves to mitigate the problems associated with
the liability of newness and smallness faced by
these new ventures. By signaling capability, re-
putation reduces the cost of acquiring and en-
hances access to resources. By reducing the effect
of resource scarcity, reputational capital therefore
increases the ability of these Ô¨Årms to engage in
innovation and venturing, which are resource-
consuming activities.

We do not believe that these Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çect a
problem of single-method bias for three reasons.
First, although corporate press releases may trig-
ger some media exposure in the short run, this is
only one of many stimuli for media interest in an
organization. The media articles found in Busi-
nesswire and PR Newswire include reports on
lawsuits, industry reports and discussions, reports
on competitors, changes in management, investor

research reports, and other topics that are fre-
quently not the result of company-issued press
releases. Second, even when media reports are the
result of press releases, the lag is likely to be in the
range of a number of days between the press
release and the media article. In this study, there
is a lag of 2‚Äì5 years between the collection of data
from media articles and collection of data from
company press releases. Third, in this study, the
collection of media exposure data from news
media articles precedes the collection of corporate
venturing and innovation data from company-
issued press releases. We are therefore conÔ¨Ådent
that these same press releases did not result in the
media attention that we suggest reÔ¨Çects the asset
of corporate reputational capital.

There are two likely explanations for the lack
of support for intellectual property and several
of the indicators of human capital in these data.
The Ô¨Årst is methodological: correlations among
the three dimensions of IC may be reducing the
statistical power of the analysis. For example,
patents are signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with some
aspects of human capital
including advanced
degrees, advanced degrees in science, and industry
experience (Table 1). This can be expected to
reduce the observed signiÔ¨Åcance of these vari-
ables.

The second explanation is that industry differ-
ences in the relevance or value of intellectual
property and the different aspects of human
capital (e.g. scientiÔ¨Åc education versus industry
experience) contribute to the marginal results.
One source of difference is in terms of the effec-
tiveness of patent protection, or ‚Äòregimes of
appropriability.‚Äô It is known that Type B Ô¨Årms
enjoy more effective protection of intellectual
property from patents than Type M Ô¨Årms (Levin
et al., 1987). Service industries are not explicitly
considered in the Kodama (1992)/Kotabe and
Swan (1995) categories, and have not typically
been included within studies of appropriability
conditions (e.g. Levin et al., 1987). It is more
likely, however, that the value of patents for
service Ô¨Årms (including software companies) re-
Ô¨Çects that of Type M Ô¨Årms rather than Type B
Ô¨Årms. The ease of reverse engineering and ‚Äòwork-
ing around‚Äô patents eliminates their protective
value (Cohen et al., 2000) and reduces the like-
lihood that Type S Ô¨Årms will apply for, or rely
upon, this form of protection for intellectual
property.

As an indicator of the differential value of
intellectual property across industry categories,
it is interesting to note the observed negative

association between patents and innovation in
Type M Ô¨Årms (Po0.01) (Table 5). It is possible
that an emphasis upon patenting new innovations
leads to the consumption of time, managerial
attention, and other resources that could more
effectively be channeled into the production of
new products, services, or processes.

Another source of difference across industry
types that might be anticipated is the strength of
associations between aspects of IC and innova-
tion or venturing measures. For example, the top
management teams of pharmaceutical Ô¨Årms typi-
cally have a larger number of advanced scientiÔ¨Åc
degrees than do the top management teams in
either Type M or Type S Ô¨Årms. However, the
gestation period for new products is relatively
long because of the need for U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval. This means that
HTNVs in Type B industries typically score quite
low on our measures of innovation, while scoring
high on advanced degrees and advanced degrees
in science.

Our post hoc analyses appear to support these
explanations (Table 5). We show different pat-
terns of signiÔ¨Åcance across industry types. We
must interpret these results with caution, how-
ever, because of the limited sample sizes in the
subgroups. In general, even though data were
drawn over multiple years, sample size remains
a limitation in this study. In order to further
explore the complex associations between IC asset
stocks and measures of entrepreneurship or other
performance outcomes,
it will be desirable to
increase sample size for all of the subgroups.
Within-industry designs using the proposed clas-
siÔ¨Åcation of IC would enable cross-Ô¨Årm compar-
isons to be made and stronger conclusions to be
drawn concerning the impact of the three aspects
of IC.

For executives in HTNVs, this study highlights
the role of IC in promoting corporate entrepre-
neurship. This focus draws attention to the need
for accumulating, integrating, and creatively har-
vesting knowledge embodied within the organiza-
tion. It also highlights the complex relationship
between aspects of IC and entrepreneurial activ-
ities. New ventures seeking to sustain innovation
and venturing should attend to the acquisition of
the various types of IC discussed in this research.
However, the particular aspect that receives most
attention will likely be determined by the industry
in which the Ô¨Årm operates.

In conclusion, this research improves our un-
derstanding of IC and entrepreneurship among
HTNVs, a major source of innovation and tech-

nological progress in today‚Äôs economy. Given
that limited empirical research addresses the nat-
ure and consequences of IC in HTNVs, this study
provides a starting point for future work in this
area. Our study makes theoretical distinctions
between the key dimensions of this construct
and contributes to understanding their inÔ¨Çuence
on a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs entrepreneurial behavior. Empirical
support for the role that IC plays in innovation
and venturing activities presented in this article
encourages researchers and practitioners alike to
systematically examine the nature, antecedents,
and consequences of IC.
