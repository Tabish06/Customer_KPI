ABSTRACT
The hypotheses that a ﬁrm’s environmental performance has a positive impact on its
ﬁnancial  performance  and  vice  versa  are  statistically  supported  by  Japanese  data.
However, this tendency for two-way positive interaction appears to be only a relatively
recent phenomenon. The tendency for realizing the two-way interaction is not limited
to the top-scoring ﬁrms in terms of both ﬁnancial and environmental performance.
On the contrary, this is also a trend that can be observed fairly generally. Obviously,
when we consider only scores of those companies that published the relevant infor-
mation in their environmental reports, and conduct the statistical causality test with
such information as additional input to the pooled time-series and cross-section data
of  ﬁnancial  performance,  the  results  become  more  strongly  signiﬁcant.  From  the
recent experience of environmental policies in Japan, we infer that information-based
environmental  policy  measures  are  effective  to  encourage  the  ongoing  transition
toward a more sustainable market economy. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons,

Relationship Between Environmental Performance and Financial Performance

Introduction

WITH THE TIGHTENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE INCREASE IN PEOPLE’S

environmental awareness in recent years, firms are being compelled to spend large amounts
on  environmental  costs  through  measures  such  as  obtaining  ISO14001  certification, 
investing in environmental equipment and developing environmentally friendly products.
However, if we look at the trend over the past few years it appears that a growing number of firms regard
such expenditure not as a ‘cost’ but as an ‘investment’ linked to corporate profit and place their efforts
to tackle environmental issues as a corporate strategy. For example, according to the Environment-Friendly
Company Survey by the Ministry of the Environment (2002, 2004), while 21.0 percent of listed corpo-
rations replied in 1999 that for them tackling environmental issues was ‘one of their most important
business  strategies  and  an  integral  part  of  their  business  activities’,  this  proportion  had  risen  to  27.1
percent by 2003. Awareness among firms appears to be in a process of transition from perceiving envi-
ronmental efforts as one factor affecting business performance to elevating such efforts to the position
of  a  major  strategic  factor.  However,  this  may  not  necessarily  mean  that  market  conditions  in  Japan
have  been  so  firmly  established  that  improvements  in  a  firm’s  environmental  performance  have  a 
positive influence on its corporate profits.

The present study provides a quantitative analysis on the basis of published data about the relation-
ship between firms’ environmental performance and their financial performance.1 Specifically, the analy-
sis has the following two goals:

(1)

to examine, by multiple linear regression analysis, whether environmental performance has a sig-
nificantly positive influence on financial performance and

(2) to examine, using a set of pooled time series and cross-section data, whether there is any statistical

causality from economic performance to environmental performance, or vice versa.

Data Preparation 1: Corporate Performance Indices

Two preceding studies, Russo and Fouts (1997) and Konar and Cohen (2001), obtained the results that
a  firm’s  environmental  performance  does  have  a  statistically  significant  positive  relationship  with  its
financial performance. Following their approach, the first part of the present study attempts similar type
of  hypothetical  testing  from  data  available  for  Japanese  firms.  In  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997),  return  on
assets (ROA) is used as an economic performance index, while the Franklin Research and Development
Corporation’s environmental rating is used as an environmental performance index. Konar and Cohen
(2001), on the other hand, used two variables for environmental performance: Toxic Release Inventory
emission levels, on the one hand, and pending environment-related litigations where the corporation is
the defendant. For the variable concerning financial performance, they used Tobin’s q - 1. Tobin’s q is
the ratio of the market value of a firm’s assets to the replacement value of the firm’s tangible assets, so
that ‘q - 1’ represents the ratio of the market value of intangible assets to the value of tangible assets.
Therefore, the question to be asked is whether the index expressing environmental performance can be
a significant explanatory variable, together with these traditional variables, for a firm’s financial perfor-
mance, i.e. whether the market acknowledges the value of environmental performance as a part of the
firm’s intangible assets.

1 In  this  paper  we  use  the  term  ‘financial’  to  represent  the  bottom  line  of  a  corporation  rather  than  a  traditional  concept  in  financial 
accounting.

Y. Nakao et al.

As explanatory variables, the present study uses ROA (return on assets) and ROE (return on equity),
which are indices of a firm’s profitability. As market-valuation related variables, it also uses proxy vari-
ables for intangible assets such as Tobin’s q - 1, and earnings per share.2 These two types of financial
performance index were used because they would make it possible to examine which of the two alter-
native  types  of  variable  represents  more  adequately  the  influence  of  environmental  performance  on
firms’ financial aspects.

It was decided to use the following variables to explain financial performance, since these were used
in  the  two  previous  studies  and  data  are  readily  available:  (1)  company  scale,  sales;  (2)  growth,  rate  of
increase in revenue (compared to previous year); (3) consumer relevancy, advertising expenses/sales; (4)
R&D, R&D expenses/sales; (5) debt dependence, financial leverage;3 (6) sales/assets ratio, sales/total assets.
As variables that represent environmental performance, Konar and Cohen (2001) used the Pollutant
Release and Transfer Index and the number of environmental litigations. However, if these variables
are  taken  from  corporate  environmental  reports,  the  problem  of  data  comparability  may  arise.4 The
present study adopts a method that is closer to that of Russo and Fouts (1997) and uses the ‘scores’ of
firms covered in the Nikkei Environmental Management Survey carried out each year since 1997 by the
Nihon  Keizai  Shimbun.  This  survey  evaluates  how  firms  have  attempted  to  establish  organizational
structure  and  functions  to  implement  environmental  measures  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas,  chemical
material emissions and other wastes while improving business efficiency at the same time.

Data Preparation 2: Range of Sample Firms and Sectoral Coverage

As mentioned above, the present study uses as its environmental performance indices the ‘score’5 eval-
uated in the Nikkei Environmental Management Survey reports compiled by Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The
sample firms are taken from those firms (listed corporations6) covered in the survey, spreading over 19
categories7 in the manufacturing sector (excluding the energy and construction industries).

From the sixth (2002) and seventh (2003) Nikkei Environmental Management Surveys onwards, over-
seas environmental management has also been assessed together with domestic environmental man-
agement. For these two years, the sample firms are taken from firms whose overseas management was
also assessed in the sixth and seventh Nikkei surveys, and the financial performance data are taken from
the consolidated financial reports of 2002 and 2003. For these sample firms, the overseas environmental
management score can also be used as environmental performance data. The analyses in the sections
‘Estimated Results of Multiple Linear Regression Analysis’, ‘Comparison of Top-Scoring Thirty Firms
and Those in the Lower Half’ and ‘Calculating Long-term Numerical Effects of Environmental Perfor-
mance on Financial Performance’ are based on a set of panel data pooled from these two years.

For the data from the five years during which there was no evaluation related to overseas performance
ranking,  the  domestic  ranking  score  was  used  as  an  environmental  performance  index.  The  use  of
Tobin’s q - 1 as a financial performance index necessitates that we use non-consolidated financial reports

2 I.e. current operating profit divided by average number of shares outstanding.
3 (Debt + minority equity + total shareholders’ equity; sum of two periods)/(total shareholders’ equity; sum of two periods).
4 See, for example, Kanda and Kitamura (2004).
5 The review items of the Nikkei Environmental Management Survey conducted by Nihon Keizai Shimbun have been somewhat different year
by year. In the present study the indices from each year were re-categorized into five. In integrating the indices for five years, some indices
were not included. They are ‘vision’ from the fifth, sixth and seventh surveys, ‘product and distribution measures’ from the fifth and sixth
surveys and ‘product measures’ from the seventh survey.

rather than the corporate group consolidated financial reports. Various financial data were taken from
these reports for the years 1999–2003.8 The analysis in the section ‘Testing Statistical Causality’ is based
on these five years’ data.

Data sources are as follows: (1) environmental performance, Nikkei Environmental Management Survey
Reports (Nihon Keizai Shimbun) published each year; (2) aggregate market value, Kaisha Shikiho (Japan
Company Handbook: Quarterly); (3) basic financial data, Nikkei Financial Data CD-ROM (Nihon Keizai
Shimbun); (4) sample firms’ financial statements.9

Methods of Analysis

The present study is based on two analytical methodologies. The study first tests a null hypothesis, using
multiple linear regression analysis, that a firm’s environmental performance has no positive influence
on its financial performance.10 It then tests a null hypothesis, using pooled cross-section and time series
data, that there is a statistical causality from a firm’s environmental performance to its financial per-
formance (or vice versa) in line with the Granger causality test methodology. The Granger causality test
was originally proposed for time series models, but it has been extended to pooled panel data (Hurlin
and Venet, 2001). From the limitation of data availability, the present study uses a simplified version of
the method of Hurlin and Venet (2001).11

In the first analysis, as explained in the previous section, a multiple regression equation is estimated

with the following specification:

(financial performance) = (constant term) + a1(rate of increase in revenue) 

+ a2(advertising expenses/sales ratio) + a3(R&D expenses/sales ratio)
+ a4(financial leverage) + a5(sales/total assets ratio) 
+ a6(environmental management score) + (error term).

(1)

Earnings per share, ROA, and Tobin’s q - 1 are used as explained variables, while overseas or domes-
tic  environmental  management  indices,  depending  on  the  range  of  covered  firms,  are  used  for  envi-
ronmental  management  scores.  The  expected  signs  on  explanatory  variables  are  as  follows:  rate  of
increase in revenue, +; advertising expenses/sales ratio, +; R&D expenses/sales ratio, +; financial lever-
age, -;  sales/total  assets  ratio, -;  environmental  management  score, +.  Sales/total  assets  ratio  is  con-
sidered as a proxy variable for the reciprocal of the firm’s capital intensity. Since Japan’s international
competitiveness is strong among capital intensive firms, the sign on this variable is expected to be -.
In  the  second  analysis,  the  following  regression  equations  are  estimated  where  t designates  time

period and p the degree of time-lag:

8 The aggregate market value of stock used to calculate Tobin’s q - 1 is calculated from the number of shares issued by each parent company,
since the consolidated number of outstanding shares was not available. For the sake of consistency, therefore, the financial data used for the
larger sample were taken from non-consolidated financial statements. Japanese corporate financial reports record geographically split figures
for some items such as turnover and operating profit but not for other items that we want to use in this analysis. Therefore, it was not possi-
ble to separate out ‘domestic’ components. The proportion of overseas facility is fairly small in most cases, however.
9 Sample firms’ financial statements were used to make up for missing data, or to supplement data not included in the Nikkei Financial Data.
10 This method has been used by many authors with various dependent and explanatory variables. Data used for environmental performance
indices are environmental and social ratings (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Butz and Plattner, 2000), total toxic chemical emissions (Konar and
Cohen, 1997; Molloy et al., 2002), number of environmental law suits against the firm (Konar and Cohen, 1997), and penalties for incompli-
ance against environmental law (Butz and Plattner, 2000). Data used for economic or financial indices are return on assets (Russo and Fouts,
1997), Tobin’s q - 1 (Konar and Cohen, 1997), the Jensen-a values (Butz and Plattner, 2000), and holding period return of stocks (Molloy et
al., 2002). The variable choice in this paper is largely determined by the availability of empirical data. Murphy (2002) provides a useful survey.
11 Many authors are concerned with possible two-way relationships between the environmental and financial/economic performance and also
the existence of common factors that affect both indices. See, for example, the discussion by Molloy et al. (2002). We consider that the idea
of Granger’s statistical causality may be able to shed light on this problem.

If the estimated value of coefficient b( j) does not differ significantly from zero, environmental perfor-
mance does not significantly alter the financial performance and hence is not considered as a causal
factor.

In order to test this as a null hypothesis, the following subsidiary equation is estimated:

where RSS1 is the residual sum of squares in estimated Equation (2), RSS2 is the residual sum of squares
in estimated equation (2¢), N is the number of firms and T is the number of years for which time series
data are available.

The statistic F follows the F-distribution with the degrees of freedom [p + 1, NT - (2p + 1)]. If this sta-
tistic is not statistically significant, the null hypothesis that there is no causal relationship is accepted
and environmental performance is deemed to have no causality relationship to financial performance.
If the performance variables are interchanged, reverse causality relationship (i.e. from financial perfor-
mance to environmental performance) can also be tested. In the following analysis, only the case where
p = 1 is considered due to data limitation.

Estimated Results of Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

Table 1 presents estimated Equation (1) by taking earnings per share as a dependent variable and pooling
2002 and 2003 data for 121 firms. Since advertising expenses/sales ratio was not significant in any esti-
mation, it was eventually removed. Since data over two years were pooled, a fiscal year dummy variable
was introduced, but their coefficients are not presented. The various explanatory variables have a plus
or  minus  signs  as  expected  and,  apart  from  indices  for  domestic  management  system  and  domestic
resource cycling, the environmental management indices have positive and statistically significant coef-
ficients in every case. Overall, overseas environmental management indices exhibit better performance
than domestic management indices. The data for the former index exhibit a much greater variance than
the latter, and it may be the case that the overseas index reflects differences in environmental manage-
ment among firms more clearly. The variances of overseas overall score and of domestic overall score
from the pooled sample of two years were 9853 and 5205 respectively, the former being almost double
the latter, and the p-value for the F-test was 9.2 ¥ 10-7.

This first set of estimation results demonstrates that a firm’s environmental performance does make
a positive contribution to its financial performance as long as we measure the latter by the Nikkei envi-
ronmental management indices. Moreover, in the case of international corporations engaged in global
activities, the contribution to the financial aspect of a firm’s performance is even more marked, a result
that is in agreement with the results of surveys carried out in other countries.

Table  2  shows  the  results  of  similar  tests  performed  with  Tobin’s  q - 1  as  the  dependent  variable.
Whereas in Table 1 financial data from consolidated statements were used, Table 2 uses financial data
from non-consolidated statements because of the need to calculate Tobin’s q - 1. It is for this reason
that slightly fewer firms are covered. As in Table 1, when overseas scores were used, the coefficients for
all the environmental performance indices were statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Another
similarity to Table 1 was that the domestic scores were less significant than the overseas scores.

Comparison of Top-Scoring 30 Firms and Those in the Lower Half

What differences exist between the top 30 firms and those in the lower half in terms of environmental
and  financial  performance?  Since  there  are  various  dimensions  in  environmental  performance  and
financial performance, it may not be appropriate to conclude that there is generally a positive relation-

ship  between  the  two  for  any  firm.  With  this  question  in  mind,  the  top  and  bottom  groups  were 
compared to test whether any statistically significant differences existed between the two groups in 2003
in terms of mean values for the variables used in the study. The results obtained are presented in Table
3.

This table shows the test results concerning the differences in mean values for the various variables
between the two groups, where 278 sample firms were ranked in the order of overall score as obtained
from the Nikkei environmental management surveys (simple average of 2002–2003 values), and the
top 30 firms were categorized as a top group and firms in the lower half as a bottom group.

For all variables except sales/assets ratio, the differences are significant at the p < 0.05 or p < 0.01
levels in the expected direction. From the table it is clear that the differences in financial performance
and  environmental  performance  between  firms  follow  the  same  trend  with  no  particular  difference
depending on the indices. In other words, on the whole, top financial performers and top environmen-
tal performers are on the same side. However, the fact that the results showed relatively small differ-
ence in the index of global warming measures suggests that efforts to tackle global warming are a thorny
issue for all firms in comparison with other environmental management problems.

Testing Statistical Causality

As in Table 2, for 278 firms for which Tobin’s q - 1 and ROA can be calculated from financial data in
their non-consolidated statements, survey data were collected from the seventh back to the third Nikkei
Environmental Management Survey Reports and, taking total domestic environmental score as an envi-
ronmental performance index, statistical tests were performed concerning the hypothesis that statisti-
cal  causality  relationship  exists  from  environmental  performance  indices  to  financial  performance
indices,  or  vice  versa,  according  to  the  method  explained  in  the  section  ‘Methods  of  Analysis’.  The
samples used in the estimation were pooled panel data for four years, three years and two years, respec-
tively, with the latest set involving 2003 and 2002 data. For example, the data set in Table 4 I(1) is data
for 278 firms as pooled over four years, where the dependent variable is Tobin’s q - 1 for which data
were  pooled  over  four  years  and  the  explanatory  variables  are  Tobin’s  q - 1  lagged  one  year,  overall
domestic score from the current year and the same variable lagged one year, all being pooled over four
years.

Table 4 presents the test statistics (F-values and P-values) obtained from the estimated results. For all
estimated results, the sum of the estimated coefficients for the environmental performance indices for
cases I and III, and the sum of estimated coefficients for financial performance indices for cases II and
IV (i.e. coefficients for variables in the current and lagged one-year periods), were positive in sign.

First, as far as the positive influence of environmental performance on financial performance is con-
cerned, the null hypothesis was not rejected for panel data pooled over four years and three years, but
it was rejected, at the p < 0.01 level, for the samples pooled over two years. This means that environ-
mental  performance  does  not  have  a  beneficial  influence  on  financial  performance  in  samples  that
include data for more distant past, whereas the relationship becomes clearer for more up-to-date data.
Second,  turning  to  a  positive  relationship  in  the  opposite  direction,  where  a  good  financial  perfor-
mance  might  provide  greater  extra  resources  to  spare  in  order  to  boost  environmental  performance,
there were cases even among three-year pooled panel data in which the null hypothesis was rejected.
Among two-year pooled panel data, at the p < 0.01 level, this hypothesis was rejected in all cases and a
positively significant relationship recognized. It is also confirmed that a relationship in this direction
exists from an earlier stage, which is certainly a more natural tendency than the other way round.

Putting together the above results, one may conclude that, whereas the trend for a good financial per-
formance to improve environmental performance has already existed for some time, the trend in which
a good environmental performance can improve financial performance is a relatively recent phenome-
non  in  Japan.  The  same  conclusions  are  obtained  irrespective  of  whether  Tobin’s  q - 1  or  return  on
assets is used as an index for the financial performance. In recent periods a mutual influence in both
directions becomes apparent, a result that suggests that at the corporate level positive two-way interac-
tions between the environment and economy are beginning to materialize.12

Table 5 shows the results of similar causality tests on individual environmental management indices
with Tobin’s q - 1 as the financial performance index. For three management indices other than the one
related to global warming measures, positive two-way interactions are observed in the latest samples.
Moreover, it is interesting that, where the environmental management is closely related to public health
(see the results for pollution risk indices), the positive influence of financial performance on environ-
mental performance has been highly significant from an earlier period.

For the purpose of confirmation, tests similar to those for I and II in Table 4 were performed on the
lower 200 firms, ignoring the top 78. In the test with four-year and three-year pooled data, significant
results at the p < 0.05 level were not obtained. On the other hand, in the case of data pooled over the
most recent two years, environmental performance had a significantly positive influence on financial
performance, with F = 4.40 and p = 0.013. Consequently, it would appear that these relationships are
not confined to the top firms, but tend to apply fairly broadly to the firms covered by the Nikkei envi-
ronmental management surveys.

Calculating Long-Term Numerical Effects of Environmental Performance on 
Financial Performance

From Tables 4 and 5, the estimation results for the most recent samples for which the positive influ-
ence  of  environmental  performance  (environmental  management  index)  on  financial  performance
(Tobin’s q - 1) was considered statistically significant at the p < 0.01 level are presented as follows. Values

12 This result suggests that the causation from the environmental side to the financial side and vice versa may not always work simultaneously,
as sometimes suggested by the ‘good management hypothesis.’ The idea of what is good management may change over time, as does the idea
of what is good management for profitability, possibly with some inertia.

From these estimated equations, it is possible to calculate the extent of the long-run influence of envi-
ronmental performance indices on financial performance indices. First, on the premise that the values
for  various  variables  are  equal  in  the  long  run,  the  long-run  estimated  coefficients  from  the  above 
equations can be calculated as 0.000 875 for the overall score, 0.009 92 for the management system
score  and  0.0139  for  the  pollution  risk  score.  Next,  the  mean  values  for  the  278  firms  covered  by 
the 2003 Nikkei environmental management surveys were 532 for the overall score, 53 for the manage-
ment system score and 53 for the pollution risk score. In addition, the mean value of the Tobin’s q - 1’s
denominator for the 278 firms in the same year was 453 711 (million yen). Therefore, for environmen-
tal management indices, if the overall score is increased for example by 10 points and individual indices
increased by one point each, then, the Tobin’s q - 1’s numerator, or the influence on the intangible asset
value, would be 0.000 875 ¥ 10 ¥ 453 711 = 3970; 0.009 92 ¥ 453 711 = 4501; 0.0139 ¥ 453 711 = 6307
(million  yen),  respectively.  In  other  words,  a  ten-point  increase  in  the  overall  score  would  raise, 
on average, the value of intangible assets of the firm by 4 billion yen. Similarly, a one-point increase 
in the management system score would lead to a 4.5 billion yen increase, and a similar increase in the
pollution  risk  score  to  a  6.3  billion  yen  increase  in  the  value  of  intangible  assets  of  the  firm  on 
average.

Conclusions and Policy Implications

Using five years’ financial data from approximately 300 listed firms as well as the results of the Nikkei
environmental  management  surveys,  statistical  analyses  were  performed  to  test  the  hypothesis  that
firms’ perceptions are changing so that they see attempts to tackle environmental issues not as a ‘cost
factor’ but as an ‘important strategic factor’, and these perceptions are indeed supported by the market.
The following conclusions were obtained from the analyses.

(1) The hypotheses that a firm’s environmental performance has a positive impact on its financial per-
formance and vice versa are supported by applying two types of statistical method to Japanese data.
However,  this  tendency  for  positive  two-way  interactions  appears  to  be  only  a  relatively  recent 
phenomenon.

(2) The tendency for realizing the positive two-way interactions is not limited to the top-scoring firms
in terms of both financial and environmental performance. On the contrary, this is also a trend that
can be observed fairly generally among the firms covered by the Nikkei environmental management
surveys.

(3) Indices such as ROA, earnings per share and Tobin’s q - 1 were all useful in representing the finan-

cial performance of the firm in the above tests.

(4) As for the indices in Nikkei environmental management surveys, overseas environmental manage-
ment indices do work better in reflecting a firm’s environmental performance than corresponding

domestic environmental management indices. In addition, while the positive two-way interactions
of the environment and economy was strongly in evidence for indices such as overall score, man-
agement system index and pollution risk index, this positive trend was relatively weak for resource-
cycling and global warming measure indices.

(5) If a firm’s environmental performance is improved in such a way that the score for each individual
index in the Nikkei environmental management surveys increased by one point or its overall score
increased by 10 points, it is estimated that this would lead to a long-run increase in the firm’s intan-
gible assets by roughly 4–6 billion yen.

Environmental  economics  explains  that  environmental  problems  are  typical  examples  of  market
failure where external environmental costs are not automatically internalized in the market system. The
above results, however, suggest an emerging trend that will make it possible for the market mechanism
as a whole, through mutually promoting public and private efforts to internalize the external costs, to
overcome this failure.

The  Ministry  of  Environment  (MoE)  in  Japan  has  pursued  vigorous  resource-cycling  and  chemical
management measures since the middle of the 1990s. Major legislation and its implementation are as
follows. (1) The Container and Packaging Recycling Law was enacted in 1995 and enforced for glass and
PET bottles in 1997 and for paper and plastic packaging and containers in 2000. (2) The Home Appli-
ance Recycling Law was enacted in 1998 and enforced in 2001. (3) The Food Waste Recycling Law was
enacted in 2000 and enforced in 2001. (4) The Construction Material Recycling Law was enacted in
2000  and  enforced  in  2002.  (5)  The  End-of-Life  Vehicle  Recycling  Law  was  enacted  in  2002  and
enforced in 2005. (6) The PRTR Law was enacted in 1997 with step-by-step enforcement: firms’ man-
agement in 2001, reporting in 2002 and disclosure in 2003. At the same time the MoE promoted pub-
lication  of  environmental  reporting  and  adoption  of  an  environmental  accounting  system  by  firms
through various guidelines and other publications starting from 1999.

As a final exercise, we performed a statistical causality test like those in Tables 4 and 5 using the infor-
mation  on  environmental  performance  of  only  those  companies  that  publish  relevant  environmental
data in their environmental/social reports. For this purpose, we used the database managed by the Min-
istry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan. The database, called Environmental Reporting Plaza,13
collects  firms’  environmental/social  reports  for  various  sectors.  We  checked  the  companies  that  pub-
lished  relevant  environmental  data  such  as  total  quantity  of  waste  recycling,  total  quantity  of  PRTR-
related chemicals and environmental accounting data. A dummy variable for each category is constructed
with the value 1 for a listing company and 0 for a company with no data. The environmental perfor-
mance data used in our causality test program are then multiplied by the dummy variable and used as
additional information.

Table 6 summarizes the results. Compared with Table 5, positive contribution of environmental man-
agement to the corporate bottom line is more highly significant and the relation has existed longer. Our
study thus support the idea that governmental measures to encourage voluntary environmental infor-
mation disclosure by private firms are effective informational instruments of environmental policy to
encourage the transition toward a more sustainable market economic system.
