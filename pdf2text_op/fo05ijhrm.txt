Alternative pathways to high-performance
workplaces

Marc Orlitzky and Stephen J. Frenkel

Abstract
In this paper we outline four high workplace performance models, two of
which have high-road or enabling characteristics. These are the strategic human resource
management and organizational trust models, respectively. The second two models – the
labour process and numerical ﬂexibility models – motivate workers to raise productivity
through the use of the stick (coercion) rather than the carrot. Based on a representative
survey of Australian workers, we compare these models in terms of their capacity to
explain relative workplace productivity. We ﬁnd that all four models have some
explanatory power. However, contrary to expectations, the low-road numerical ﬂexibility
model provides the best ﬁt with the data. We interpret this ﬁnding by reference to recent
evidence of workforce trends indicating the attraction and ability of employers to pursue
this pathway toward higher productivity. We conclude with some suggestions for future
research that would assist in developing this line of enquiry.

Introduction

Paralleling management concern with intensiﬁed global competition, the past decade has
seen an explosion of interest by human resource (HR) and industrial relations scholars in
exploring the relationship between HR and work organization variables on the one hand
and ﬁrm or workplace performance on the other (Becker and Huselid, 1998; Wright and
Gardner, 2003). The dominant high-performance work practices (HPWP) paradigm
posits a positive relationship between these variables, although, as we shall see, the
variables differ and the presumed relationships vary in complexity depending on whether
the model is based on universalist or contingency assumptions. Regardless, evidence for
the HPWP paradigm has been mixed, leading scholars to propose many theoretical and
methodological reﬁnements (Becker and Huselid, 1998; Gerhart et al., 2000; Guest,
2001). In addition, reﬂecting an emerging theoretical critique, some scholars have begun
to pursue models based on the conﬂict paradigm (Godard, 2001; Ramsay et al., 2000).
The HPWP paradigm has persisted in spite of variable empirical evidence. This can be
explained by two of its characteristics: the appeal of its underpinning assumptions and its
wide scope, i.e. its capacity to include widely different model speciﬁcations. Using Adler
and Borys’ (1996) distinction between enabling and coercive organization practices, the

HPWP paradigm upholds HR and work organization practices that are designed to enable
employees – i.e. to empower, develop and encourage employees – to work more
effectively. These are practices that bring an integrative solution to what might be a
distributive game: by doing good to employees (implementing high-performance
practices), organizations do well (are rewarded with high performance). The HPWP
paradigm therefore appeals to adherents of the pluralist perspective, offering a non-zero
sum solution to liberal-minded managers. From a contrasting conﬂict perspective, such
practices appear as tactical concessions in what is perceived as a continuing fundamental
conﬂict between capital and labour over the generation and distribution of economic value.
HPWP theory suggests that introducing only one or two enabling practices is
insufﬁcient, for it is the synergies that derive from their mutual interaction that bring the
highest returns. In other words, HPWP is presumed to constitute a system or ‘bundle’
(Ichniowski et al., 1996). This leads to a consideration of the second characteristic –
HPWP’s wide scope. Many HR and work organization practices come under the HPWP
banner. Two reviews noted over twenty-ﬁve different practices (Becker and Gerhart,
1996; Dyer and Reeves, 1995) and in the latter case, based on ﬁve studies, no one practice
was found to be common to this research (Wright and Gardner, 2003: 312). It is not only
the number of practices but also the many performance measures, different levels of
analysis and varying industry coverage that increase the probability of ﬁnding support for
one or another variant of the paradigm. Thus, subjective and objective measures of
performance include productivity, quality, reductions in labour costs, proﬁtability and
market value (Becker and Huselid, 1998; Guest, 2001). Some within-industry studies use
industry-speciﬁc measures (Appelbaum et al., 2000). Levels of analysis include most
commonly the ﬁrm or workplace and much less frequently the business unit (Wright and
Gardner, 2003). Studies vary in coverage from national samples of private-sector
manufacturing and services (Guest et al., 2003; Osterman, 1995), occasionally including
the public sector (Guerrero and Barraud-Didier, 2004), publicly held companies
(Huselid, 1995), the manufacturing sector (Cappelli and Neumark, 2001) or speciﬁc
industries (Dunlop and Weil, 1996; Ichniowski et al., 1997; Paul and Anantharaman,
2003; Youndt et al., 1996). Rarely do we ﬁnd studies focusing on all or most of the
private service sector (Hunter, 2000).

While there are beneﬁts from continuing to reﬁne and test models based on the HPWP
paradigm, it is important to acknowledge that HR and work organization practices
commonly regarded as enabling may be coercive, either because this effect is unintended
or because they are motivated by multiple management goals, with coercive aspects
dominating. This results in varying patterns of subtle and more visible forms of
distributive conﬂict that may enhance or limit workplace performance. Accordingly, we
test both enabling (or ‘high-road’) models and coercive (or ‘low-road’) models of human
resource management. By attempting to compare and assess their respective predictive
power, we are responding to demands for strong inference (Pedhazur and Schmelkin,
1991; Platt, 1964), in which alternative hypotheses or models are clearly speciﬁed a
priori and research is conducted to test the relative validity of these alternative, typically
contrasting, models. In addition, path analysis permits exploration of the causal
mechanisms associated with theory underpinning these different models. This approach
responds to calls for opening the black box that lies between the presence of particular
HR or work organization practices and their impact on performance (Guest, 2001;
Ramsay et al., 2000; Wright and Gardner, 2003).

The paper is organized into ﬁve sections. In the ﬁrst section, we brieﬂy review relevant
research on HPWP and other possible explanations of high performance at the workplace
level. Four high workplace performance models are outlined, two high-road or enabling

1327

models, referred to as the strategic human resource management (SHRM) contingency
model and the organizational trust model respectively, and two low-road models, both
based on conﬂict theory. These are a labour process model and a numerical ﬂexibility
model. The latter takes ﬂexible labour markets and associated external and internal
adjustments in labour inputs (e.g. use of contract and part-time workers and changes in
working hours) as its central feature. The second section describes our data and
measures. Our results are presented in the third section. In the subsequent discussion
section, we interpret our ﬁndings in light of theory and extant economic and institutional
conditions, paying attention to the black box of intervening variables, several of which
speak to the issue of workers’ attitudes and their effects on workplace performance.
We also note some methodological limitations of our analysis. The concluding section
summarizes our key ﬁndings and suggests several important implications for future
research.

People management and workplace performance

trust

In this section, we brieﬂy review people management theory that might help explain
variations in workplace performance. We begin with HPWP theory that assumes that
management’s unilateral action in developing HRM strategy and practice will enable
employees to develop their capabilities, thereby inﬂuencing performance. The second,
organizational
theory, has a similar enabling logic. Derived from industrial
sociology, it posits that trust is central to workplace performance and that management’s
efforts to build trust will foster a congenial employee relations (ER) climate that leads to
high performance. Our two subsequent models emphasize coercion. They are drawn
from political economy, which views management’s pursuit of proﬁt conﬂicting with
workers’ interests in higher pay and improved conditions, resulting in coercive practices
to secure worker compliance. The labour process model posits work intensiﬁcation as the
main inﬂuence on performance, while the numerical ﬂexibility model views a signiﬁcant
proportion of the labour force as a commodity, with management continually tailoring its
supply to changing demand. It is assumed that effective matching will yield high
workplace performance.

High-performance work practices: theory and research

HPWP is an attempt at a unifying theory of people management practice. In essence, the
universal variant of this theory claims that if management implements a speciﬁed set of
employment and work practices, these will lead to higher performance (Boxall and
Purcell, 2003: 47 – 70). Many of these practices – e.g. selective hiring, teamwork,
redesigned jobs, employee participation, teamwork and communication or information
sharing – have been shown to improve performance, but not in a consistent manner
(Appelbaum et al., 2000; Cappelli and Neumark, 2001; Osterman, 1995; Paul and
Anantharaman, 2003; Wood and de Menezes, 1998). The strongest results have been
obtained where models appear to approximate the real world of work and where
measurement and sampling errors are reduced by using special-purpose surveys targeted
at workplaces in speciﬁc industries (Appelbaum et al., 2000; Dunlop and Weil, 1996;
Ichniowski et al., 1997). A common thread running through these studies is that HPWP
contributes to high performance where workers are expected and encouraged to perform
at a high standard. This occurs where HR and work organization practices provide
workers with discretion or control over their work, where they are developed to
work competently, and where they are supported and rewarded by management
to work co-operatively with colleagues. Theory suggests three mechanisms – structural,


1328 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

motivational and cognitive – that lead to high performance. Structural alterations, for
example, the creation of teams or introduction of a new reward system, may provide an
initial rather than continuing improvement in performance. For continuous improvement,
employees need to increase and sustain their motivation at a high level – a possibility
that arises through perceptions and emotions related to greater work satisfaction and
empowerment – and/or cognitive changes need to be introduced. These might include
improved management communication and investment in formal training and/or on-the-
job learning (Adler and Cole, 1993; Appelbaum et al., 2000; Ichniowski et al., 1996).
Evidence for the impact of bundles of HR or work organization practices has been
contradictory, with some studies showing strong evidence (Ichniowski et al., 1997;
MacDufﬁe, 1995) but most others ﬁnding little support for their presence or impact on
performance (e.g. Guest, 2001; Guest et al., 2003; Osterman, 1995; Wood, 1999). The
very limited adoption of such bundles by employers in the US (Gittleman et al., 1998;
Osterman, 1995), the UK (Cully et al., 1999), Australia and European countries (OECD,
1999) tends to conﬁrm that, if bundling has performance advantages, it is probably for a
relatively small proportion of workplaces. This is consistent with the observation, noted
earlier, that no consensus exists on which practices should comprise the bundle. In
addition, proposed bundles are more costly to introduce than one or two practices, and
their pay-off is likely only in circumstances where employees rather than management or
technology can add signiﬁcant value to the ﬁnal product or service (Boxall and Purcell,
2003: 6). This points to the SHRM contingency or ‘ﬁt’ perspective on HPWP (Boxall and
Purcell, 2003: 51 – 61). What evidence is there for this theory?

Before responding to this question, it may be helpful to clarify two kinds of ﬁt.
External ﬁt assumes that the organization has a business strategy that is in tune with its
environment and that there exists a close correspondence between management’s HR
strategy and the business strategy. It also implies that this ﬁt is successfully carried
through in implementing HR and work organization practices. This being so, the
proposition is that the better the external ﬁt, the higher the organization’s performance.
A more complete SHRM model would include internal ﬁt, i.e. consistency in application
of HR and work organization practices among employees doing similar work, and
temporal ﬁt, i.e. maintaining both kinds of alignment over time (Baron and Kreps, 1999).
Despite its theoretical appeal and conﬁrmation in some industry-speciﬁc studies
(Arthur, 1994; Dunlop and Weil, 1996; MacDufﬁe, 1995), the SHRM model has received
little empirical support (Becker and Huselid, 1998: 65; Wright and Sherman, 1999).
Various theoretical and empirical reasons have been advanced to explain this (Becker
and Huselid, 1998; Boxall and Purcell, 2003; Wright and Gardner, 2003), three of which
are worth mentioning here. The ﬁrst is the assumption that, through its business strategy,
there is a good ﬁt or alignment between the organization and its environment. Second,
there is the difﬁculty of obtaining reliable survey data on the many aspects required by
this type of theory and, third, the appropriateness of this approach is questionable when
research is conducted at the workplace level. This is where divisional or operational
strategy is more relevant than the overall business strategy of the ﬁrm (Wright and
Gardner, 2003: 315). Acknowledging these problems and the restrictions placed on
model building in our case by limited survey data, we nevertheless develop and test a
SHRM model.

In this model we hypothesize that the more predictable the environment, the more
likely it is that management will develop an HR strategy that will drive HPWP. These HR
and work organization practices will in turn positively inﬂuence workplace performance.
This is likely to occur through the mechanism of management communication: the more
frequently (and presumably effectively) management gets its message across to

employees, the more employees will understand the connection between their work and
employment prospects and high workplace performance. This will encourage them to
work more effectively, thereby raising workplace productivity.

Insights from industrial sociology and political economy

Organizational trust theory

is inefﬁcient

Hodson (1996, 2001) has been concerned with the antecedents and consequences of
workers achieving dignity at work. His pluralist framework admits conﬂict and co-
operation; it is management action that holds the key to their patterning in particular
workplaces. Where management
in organizing production and in
implementing human resource and work organization practices that ensure worker
dignity,
this leads to worker dissatisfaction and conﬂict between employees and
management and among employees. By contrast, where management organizes
production efﬁciently, and treats workers fairly and respectfully, a high level of
organizational trust is said to prevail. This gives rise to a co-operative ER climate that
encourages worker commitment and extra effort (Hodson, 2004), and hence contributes
to high workplace performance. The practices used to confer dignity on workers are
similar to those identiﬁed by HPWP theorists; for example, high pay, good beneﬁts, jobs
with some discretionary element, employee participation, internal job opportunities, job
security and training (Hodson, 2001, 2004). Hodson’s (2004) analysis also indicates that
high organizational trustworthiness is more likely where product markets are stable,
contracting-out of production or services is limited and local ownership prevails, and
where workplaces are relatively large and employ an ethnically homogeneous, male
workforce. These conditions may be an artefact of Hodson’s sample of ethnographies
rather than being representative of the workplace population. Nevertheless, we are able
to test most elements of this organizational trust model.1

The models addressed so far view particular management practices as having positive
attributes that motivate or facilitate employees to perform more effectively. This
enabling logic differs from the theories that underpin the labour process and numerical
ﬂexibility models, which are based on a coercive logic where work strain and insecurity
associated with fear of unemployment are claimed to be the main forces motivating high
performance.

Labour process theory

As indicated earlier, a conﬂict perspective informs this theory. In an era of ﬂexible
specialization or post-Fordism, workers are no longer expected to simply comply with
management requirements leading to conﬂict over wages, conditions and control.
Instead, they are encouraged to solve problems proactively and generally develop and
use their skills to assist management to compete more effectively. This is not, however, a
new world of benign management, as anticipated and promoted by HPWP adherents.
Rather, it depicts management ‘lifting the bar’ in an era of global competition: work
becomes more intense and job insecurity more clearly spelled out in management
communications. These characteristics complement greater employee discretion within a
system of continuous performance management. The essentially coercive nature of the
model is rooted in the notion that, while workers may have more task autonomy, they feel
more pressure to perform and have less overall control over their working lives. The
labour process model we address has been proposed and tested by Ramsay et al. (2000)
using British survey data.2 The reasoning behind it is that HPWP – practices that appear


1330 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

to promote employee involvement and development and tend to more or less coexist with
one another (Ramsay et al., 2000: 508 – 9) – provide increased job discretion to
employees. While this and HPWP beneﬁt workers, these work practices are claimed to
impose net costs on employees in the form of additional responsibility leading to work
intensiﬁcation and possibly job insecurity, which in turn contribute to job strain. This
coercive context is said to foster more effort (Ramsay et al., 2000: 505), so that, overall,
it is a combination of positive inducements and dominant negative pressure that
contributes to high performance. In effect, an iron ﬁst in a velvet glove.

The prior evidence for the model’s effectiveness in predicting UK labour productivity
is weak. While HPWP were shown to have a signiﬁcant effect on productivity, the
addition of employee discretion, work intensiﬁcation and job insecurity into the
regression analysis made little difference, suggesting that these are not mediating
variables (Ramsay et al., 2000: 519 – 20). Indeed, in the case of job security, there is a
signiﬁcant positive overall effect on productivity, indicating that job security rather than
insecurity is an important variable (which is in line with Pfeffer, 1998, for example).

Numerical ﬂexibility theory

As noted earlier, numerical ﬂexibility theory assumes that labour is a net cost so that
improving pay and conditions fundamentally conﬂicts with management’s proﬁt-
maximizing goal. Labour ﬂexibility is most frequently used to denote numerical, i.e. a
means of tailoring and hence containing costs relative to demand by adjusting the
quantity of labour employed. This contrasts with functional ﬂexibility, which includes
developing employees’ capabilities so that workers perform a wider range of more highly
skilled work tasks. It is the threat or unilateral imposition of numerical ﬂexibility,
through job loss, reduction in working hours or conversion of job status (permanent to
temporary or full-time to part-time), that represents a form of coercion.

In Gordon’s (1996) political economic analysis, American managers use the stick
(numerical ﬂexibility) to motivate workers rather than the carrot (functional ﬂexibility
including HPWP), although he admits that some managers attempt to supplement the
former with the latter, a combination that has long been used by Japanese manufacturing
ﬁrms (Dore, 1973). This combined approach is likely to have spread both internationally
and across industries in recent years (Kalleberg, 2001). The numerical ﬂexibility model
does not deny these tendencies but points to an emphasis on cost containment and hence
numerical ﬂexibility as the main part of the mix. In regard to labour, this means three
things: ﬁrst, keeping unit labour costs as low as possible, hence a preference for using
is relatively plentiful, diligent and amenable (e.g. women and young
labour that
immigrant workers); second, opposition to labour market
including
consultation or negotiation with trade unions; and, third, adjusting labour costs as
rapidly as possible to changes in demand, which in turn means being able readily to
recruit and replace labour. Associated with this model is relatively intense supervision,
which, on the one hand, reinforces a high level of performance, but, on the other hand,
increases payroll costs. However, the widespread use of digital technology counteracts
this tendency by providing effective performance monitoring systems and enabling
workplaces to operate with fewer levels of management and larger spans of control
(Cappelli, 1999: 105).

regulation,

Why should this paradigm be relevant outside the US? First, because ﬂexible labour
markets have become one of the factors commonly believed to account for the success of
the US economy. It is a paradigm that has come to be believed and implemented by many
governments (e.g. Britain and New Zealand in the 1980s and Australia in the 1990s),

1331

which are accused of perpetuating high unemployment. It has also become a convenient
stick for employers and governments to use against trade unions. More fundamentally, it
supports management unilateralism, which is the managers’ preferred option regardless
of their company’s country of origin.

The model we test proposes that management selectively hires part-time, female
employees. These more vulnerable workers can be more easily managed through the use
of external and internal ﬂexibility mechanisms, including use of contractors, selling part
of the business, changes in working hours, changing the number of full-time, part-time or
casual employees and changes in pay. We posit a direct effect of structural change on
performance and, more speculatively, the possibility of these changes being mediated
through an employment relations climate of dissatisfaction and fear.

In analysing the four models, we distinguish between manufacturing and service
sectors. This helps to redress the emphasis that has been placed up to now on
manufacturing. Guest et al. (2003: 306) have shown that the strength of the HR practices-
performance relationship is more robust for manufacturing than for services. Hunter
(2000: 484 – 5) demonstrated that service industries tended to employ different kinds of
HPWP, with more emphasis on numerical ﬂexibility in the form of job sharing and
ﬂexitime and less stress on work organization associated with functional ﬂexibility, for
example, total quality management, teams and job rotation. This may be related to the
higher labour intensity and hence greater relative cost of labour in service ﬁrms (Boxall,
2003). In services,
there is therefore a stronger incentive to utilize labour more
efﬁciently, and in serving mass service and mass-customized markets, this can be done
mainly by ﬂexibly employing low- to medium-skilled employees in some cases with
ameliorative HR practices intended to limit worker discontent (Boxall, 2003: 12 – 14;
Houlihan, 2003); in other words, by pursuing what are essentially low-road models of
high performance. By contrast, in manufacturing located in Western countries, we expect
the adoption of HPWP to reﬂect employment of relatively highly skilled, adaptable
employees whose work is enabled by advanced technology. The emphasis is on
functional ﬂexibility because it is increasingly difﬁcult to compete with low-cost, simple
product manufacturers located in developing countries. We therefore anticipate that, in
comparison with the service sector, high-road models of workplace performance will
characterize high-performance manufacturing. Generally, various industry character-
istics may exert a moderating inﬂuence on the relationship between HPWP and
productivity (Datta et al., 2005).

Methods

Sample and survey procedure

Our study is based on a representative sample of 2001 Australian workplaces employing
twenty or more employees. The sample size corresponds to an overall response rate of 80
per cent (Morehead et al., 1997). The Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey
(AWIRS) used a stratiﬁed sampling strategy, so that the standard errors calculated for
each of the eighteen industry band proportions and each of the ﬁve size-band proportions
were approximately equal.

Each workplace received four questionnaires. For our analysis, we rely on three of
these: the General Management Questionnaire, the Employee Relations Management
Questionnaire and the Employee Survey. The most senior workplace manager completed
the ﬁrst questionnaire, while the most senior HR manager completed the second
questionnaire. In 40 per cent of all workplaces, this person was different from the
manager completing the ﬁrst questionnaire. The Employee Survey was distributed to a


1332 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

random sample of employees in each workplace where the senior manager agreed to this
procedure. Ninety-ﬁve per cent of senior managers consented to the employee survey,
which employees ﬁlled out anonymously. The number of employees surveyed per
workplace depended on workplace size; each employee had about a 1 per cent chance of
being randomly selected.

Table 1 provides an overview of some of the major characteristics of the workplaces
in the sample. The highest proportion of workplaces were in manufacturing (17 per cent),
retail trade (14 per cent) and education (13 per cent) (Morehead et al., 1997: 28). The
Australian Bureau of Statistics judged the management and employee surveys to be
representative. More details about the sampling procedure are provided in Morehead
et al. (1997).

Measures

Table 2 presents the operational deﬁnitions of all variables included in our statistical
analysis, their measurement errors (if applicable) and their source. Whenever possible,
we combined items to form multi-item variables for further statistical analysis. This
aggregation of items made it possible to calculate reliability coefﬁcients for the
respective variable. As Table 2 indicates, many of the measures came from different
questionnaires, thus reducing common source bias.

Because the high-performance work practices (HPWP) variable assumes a central
role in two of our models, it requires more explanation. We decided to investigate a
bundling or systems approach as explained earlier. However, we did not assume that
the HPWP items listed in Table 2 form an internally consistent set of procedures.
Rather, we sought to examine empirically whether this is the case (Guest, 2001: 1099 –
100; Becker and Huselid, 1998: 88 – 90). If HPWP formed a system,
the items
measuring these practices would be internally consistent and, thus, demonstrate a high
coefﬁcient alpha reliability among the items. Our analyses show this not to be the case.
Internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach’s alpha, was only .31. Coefﬁcient alpha,
as an overall measure of internal consistency, was in line with results of other analyses
suggested by Guest (2001) and Becker and Huselid (1998). The items did not comprise
a general factor or several sub-factors nor did they form a cluster on which different

workplaces consistently scored high or low. With the inclusion of other variables
relating to employee enablement (increased discretion and/or capacity to develop
capabilities)
forming the measure of HPWP (e.g. use of appraisals, pay for
performance, team building, etc.), internal consistency was reduced.3

Our dependent variable is labour productivity relative to major competitors. This was
rated by senior workplace manager survey respondents on a 5-point scale. In the absence
of so-called objective performance data from other sources, this variable has the
advantage of being the most proximate and valid of available dependent variables. As
long as there is a relatively wide distribution of responses across several response
categories, the fact that fewer managers claim to be a lot lower than average or a little
lower than average compared to their competitors than is warranted does not invalidate
the measure. In fact, if workplaces with high performance were more likely to respond to
AWIRS than those with low performance, the problem would be one of range restriction,
not measurement invalidity. Range restriction has been shown to attenuate observed
empirical relations between variables (Ghiselli et al., 1981; Thorndike, 1982). Thus, the
possibility of range restriction ought to be considered because the path coefﬁcients (g)
leading to labour productivity might appear smaller than they really are. Viewed from
this perspective, our reported path coefﬁcients are likely to exhibit a conservative
(downward) bias.

A noteworthy implication of using labour productivity as the dependent variable is
that it tends to exclude public-sector workplaces from our analyses. This is because
public-sector workplace managers often do not compare their workplace labour
productivity with competitors (indeed they may not have any). For all four of our models,
the coverage of public-sector workplaces is less than 6 per cent, compared to 19 per cent
in the total sample.

Analytic procedure

We use structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the data. SEM presents causal
processes in a series of simultaneous regression equations applied to the data set and
assesses overall empirical ﬁt with the theoretical speciﬁcation(s). Therefore, SEM allows
not only for an assessment of the validity of the causal model relating various observable
(i.e. one-item) or unobservable (i.e. latent) constructs to each other, but also for an
evaluation of the underlying measurement model of each latent variable. SEM is
particularly useful for cross-sectional research because model ﬁt indicates the extent to
which common method variance (one-factor solution) does not affect the results. SEM
permits examination of direct and indirect (that is, mediated) causal effects, as well as
moderator effects, that is, contingency factors or boundary conditions (such as industry)
that often remained unexplored in the HPWP and strategic human resource management
literature (Boxall and Purcell, 2003). Those studies mainly use multiple regressions,
which do not usually provide evidence about the ‘black box’ between HR practices and
outcome variables such as labour productivity. In a related vein, the testing of mediation
can be more complex and error-prone in multiple regressions than in SEM, which depicts
mediation visually. Moreover, unlike SEM, multiple regressions do not typically correct
for measurement error.

Results

In line with the theory section above, we present our ﬁndings for the different pathways
to higher labour productivity in the following order: (1) SHRM model, (2) organizational
trust model, (3) labour process model and (4) numerical ﬂexibility model. Overall, the

that

ﬁndings suggest
there may be several, very different pathways to enhanced
organizational performance. Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses.
However, overall, the numerical ﬂexibility model demonstrated the best empirical ﬁt
with the data. The four models are sub-divided into manufacturing versus services in
order to examine whether industry context acts a contingency, or moderator.
The SHRM model generally had adequate ﬁt statistics (x2 ¼ 360.90 with 42 degrees of
freedom; goodness of ﬁt index [GFI] ¼ .93; adjusted GFI ¼ .89; Tucker – Lewis Index
¼ .60). As Figure 1 shows, one or two disappointingly small path coefﬁcients may be
responsible for this less than perfect, but still quite good ﬁt overall. The small path
coefﬁcients from communication to trust (.07) and from trust to labour productivity (.07)
may account for the low comparative ﬁt indexes (incremental ﬁt index [IFI] ¼ .70;
comparative ﬁt index [CFI] ¼ .69; relative ﬁt index [RFI] ¼ .57). While these latter two
paths went in a direction consistent with the theoretical model, the other paths were much
larger,
that greater market

thus supporting the model. The ﬁndings suggest

1338 The International Journal of Human Resource Management
unpredictability decreased the likelihood of HRM strategizing (g¼ 2 .45). Conversely,
the more predictable the product market, the more likely it is that management will
develop an HRM strategy. HRM strategy in turn was positively related to the adoption of
HPWP (g¼ .81), which in turn predicted greater management communication
(g¼ .65).
The contingency analysis suggests that the broad industry context functions as an
important moderator of the SHRM model (x2 difference (df ¼ 42) ¼ 289.25; p , .005).
The most noteworthy difference between the SHRM model in manufacturing compared
to service industries is probably the much smaller effect of HRM strategizing to adoption

of HPWP in the service industry (gservice ¼ .20 vs. gmfg. ¼ .85). Furthermore, trust may
have a negligible or even negative impact on labour productivity in manufacturing
(g¼ 2 .04), whereas interpersonal trust between management and service workers
contributed to labour productivity in the service sector (g¼ .11).

The second high-road model, the organizational trust model, suggested that Hodson’s
digniﬁed employment practices would, in combination with management competence,
lead to organizational trust, creating a favourable ER climate and thus resulting in
enhanced labour productivity. With the exception of the path between management
competence and ER climate (g¼ 2 .12, which was expected to be positive), Figure 2
shows that all path coefﬁcients were in the right direction. Most notable and consistent

Orlitzky and Frenkel: Alternative pathways to high-performance workplaces

1339

with the organizational trust model was the positive path between employment practices,
as speciﬁed by Hodson, and ER climate (g¼ .58). Overall, this more complex model
ﬁtted the data about as well as the previous model (x2 ¼ 323.10 with 34 df; GFI ¼ .93;
AGFI ¼ .86; TLI ¼ .56; IFI ¼ .73; CFI ¼ .73; RFI ¼ .53). The root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA ¼ .11) was slightly worse than that of the ﬁrst high-
road model (RMSEA ¼ .10), suggesting that this model would not ﬁt the population
correlation matrix well. The complexity of the model is the most likely culprit.

When manufacturing workplaces were differentiated from service workplaces, the
parameter estimates did not converge and minimization was not achieved. This was the
case even after the four exogenous variables (market unpredictability, proportion of
female workers, workplace size and foreign ownership) were dropped from the model.
Because the subgroup moderator analysis did not converge, no cross-industry differences
can be inferred from the industry moderator analysis of the organizational trust model.
The labour process model includes elements of a high road strategy (e.g. HPWP), but
is largely based on the notion that workers are coerced into high performance. Again,
overall, this model ﬁtted the data quite well (x2 ¼ 356.28 with 73 df; GFI ¼ .93; AGFI
¼ .91; TLI ¼ .79). Considering the relatively high number of variables included in this
model, the RMSEA was quite good (.07), as well as the comparative ﬁt indexes (IFI
¼ .84; CFI ¼ .83; RFI ¼ .75). In this model, the calculated path coefﬁcients were
particularly interesting. In line with the model, HPWP appeared to intensify work
(g¼ .06), albeit not by much, and led to greater job insecurity (g¼ .12). Job discretion
was not affected by HPWP in this model (g¼ .02). Very much in line with the model,
employee-perceived job strain is greatly increased by work intensiﬁcation (g¼ .44),
increased by job insecurity (g¼ .14) and decreased by greater
job discretion
(g¼ 2 .08). However, job strain was not positively related to labour productivity
(g¼ 2 .02).
Also noteworthy is the labour process model’s level of generalizability. The industry
environment did not seem to matter (x2 ¼ 65.15 with 73 df; ns). Although Figure 3b
shows some differences in the path coefﬁcients between workplaces in manufacturing
and services, respectively, the moderator analysis suggests that overall these differences
are negligible.
Our fourth and ﬁnal model is the low-road numerical ﬂexibility model. It has the best
empirical ﬁt overall (x2 ¼ 41.45 with 4 df). All goodness of ﬁt indexes were impressive
(GFI ¼ .98; AGFI ¼ .93; TLI ¼ .92; IFI ¼ .97; CFI ¼ .97; RFI ¼ .91). The
relatively high RMSEA of .11 suggests that the goodness of ﬁt of this model is not only
due to the causal relations being in line with the predictions, but also the relative absence
of latent constructs from this model (i.e. with one exception, one-item measures captured
all variables). This caveat does not detract from the high path coefﬁcients, however. The
proportion of part-time and female workers enhanced workplace numerical ﬂexibility to
a great extent (path coefﬁcients gwere .35 and .34, respectively). Numerical ﬂexibility in
turn strongly predicted higher labour productivity (g¼ .40).4
The contingency analysis suggests that industry sector exerts a moderating inﬂuence,
which is both statistically signiﬁcant (x2 ¼ 22.15 with 4 df; p , .005) and conceptually
interesting. In the manufacturing sector, management adjustment of labour inputs with
changes in demand receives strong empirical support, with the hiring of part-time workers
completely dominating female workers as a means of achieving numerical ﬂexibility.
Although the numerical ﬂexibility model is also valid in the service sector, the causal
relationships are attenuated, with the calculated path coefﬁcients indicating that changes in
part-time and female workforce composition contributed almost equally to numerical
ﬂexibility (g¼ .38 and .27, respectively). However, numerical ﬂexibility affected labour

productivity much less in service than manufacturing workplaces (gsvc ¼ .12 vs. gmfg
¼ .59). In sum, the analyses presented in Figure 4b suggest that the numerical ﬂexibility
model may be slightly more effective in manufacturing than service contexts.

Discussion

In this section we interpret some of the more important and unexpected ﬁndings reported
above. We also mention some of the limitations of our study.

Addressing some of our key ﬁndings in turn, beginning with the SHRM model, the
positive relationship between relatively predictable markets, HR strategy and HPWP can
be interpreted in terms of predictability permitting and encouraging HR planning,

thereby enabling the development of a stable workforce. For employees to be productive,
managers need to provide encouragement and support. They do so by introducing HPWP
and frequently communicating with employees. These practices do not, however, exert a
substantial positive effect on trust, and neither does trust have much impact on labour
productivity. How can these results be explained?

In the wake of considerable organizational restructuring, downsizing, and institutional
change leading to widespread perceptions of employment insecurity (Watson et al.,
2003: 82),5 workers are likely to have become more sceptical of the content of
management communications. Paradoxically, professionalizing communications in the
form of public relations expertise may also work against trust in management. Two
possible explanations for the low trust-productivity relationship are that, ﬁrst, trust is
much less important than management competence – management may not have the
capability to deliver productivity outcomes, and, second, trust in local management is less


1342 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

trust

relevant to worker motivation in an era characterized by corporate headquarters’ control
over investment and management pressure to respond to short-term movements in the
company’s share price. Nevertheless,
in labour-intensive services, where local
management can make a substantial difference to customer outcomes,
in
management is likely to have more inﬂuence: hence the positive, albeit relatively weak
relationship with productivity in service environments. More generally, over the longer
term,
labour productivity may beneﬁt from high trust by attracting high-quality
employees to a company known for its trusting culture and by reducing labour turnover.
The stronger relationship between HRM strategy and HPWP in manufacturing
suggests that the speciﬁc practices that comprise HPWP – viz. rigorous selection,
training and development, employee participation and equal employment/afﬁrmative
action – are more suited to a functionally ﬂexible manufacturing sector than numerically
ﬂexible service industry, a ﬁnding that recalls Hunter’s (2000) results. An explanation of
why communication should be stronger in building trust in manufacturing compared to
services is that in manufacturing workplaces relationships with workers are more
continuous. In service workplaces, there are proportionately more workers employed on
non-standard contracts (Watson et al., 2003). This makes communication more difﬁcult,
and interactions with customers mediate management communications and inﬂuence
how messages are interpreted.

In regard to the organizational trust model, contrary to expectation, a positive ER
climate may indicate an indulgency pattern (Gouldner, 1955) and hence a lack of
pressure to increase labour productivity. This ﬁnding is consistent with some studies that
show little relationship between job satisfaction and performance (Brief, 1998;
Iaffaldano and Muchinsky, 1985).

The surprisingly small positive relationship between supportive employment practices
and management competence suggests that managers who are good at allocating and
utilizing ﬁnancial and physical capital do not necessarily engage in exemplary human
resource practices. These managers are mainly task- rather than people-oriented, and
concerned with creating economic value rather than building organizational competence.
Contrary to expectation, management competence has a negative effect on ER climate.
This contrasts with the strongly positive impact of supportive employment practices.
A possible interpretation of this is that being more efﬁcient may mean more management
control and either less worker discretion or more worker discretion coupled with greater
work responsibility and collegial pressure to perform; in other words, increased work
intensiﬁcation (Boxall and Purcell, 2003). In either case, tension between management
and employees is likely to rise, as indicated by a negative relationship between
management competence and ER climate.

The ﬁnding that foreign-owned workplaces are more likely to use supportive
employment practices, though contrary to Hodson’s (2004) results, is unsurprising, for
multinationals,
to local ﬁrms, are well-known for introducing more
sophisticated HR practices, including higher pay, into their afﬁliate workplaces (Muller-
Camen et al., 2001: 439; Wolf, 2004: 235 – 42).

in contrast

Our results in relation to the labour process model show that, as anticipated, work
intensiﬁcation is strongly and positively related to job strain. This contrasts with the small
negative relationship between job strain and labour productivity, which was expected to
be strongly positive. We interpret this result as indicating that stressful work leads to
lower productivity because health and safety deteriorates, which in turn contributes to
errors, accidents, lower quality work, and possibly also higher absenteeism and higher
labour turnover (Jex, 1998; Lee and Ashforth, 1996). Measurement error may also
account for this weaker than expected ﬁnding since job strain is a single item rather than


Orlitzky and Frenkel: Alternative pathways to high-performance workplaces

1343

multiple items. For services, compared to manufacturing, this relationship is relatively
small and positive, perhaps because service employees feel some obligation to customers
and so are prepared to wear a limited amount of strain in order to not let customers down.
The numerical ﬂexibility model works as predicted and is consistent with a great deal
of evidence that employers have been pursuing numerical ﬂexibility strategies in order to
increase their ability to respond to unpredictable market developments, optimize the use
of new technology, and contain costs in a world of intense competition and excess
capacity in many industries (Watson et al., 2003). For example, casual employment
(temporary work without several basic entitlements) – the largest component of non-
standard employment – has grown much faster than standard employment over the past
twenty years. Its present relative signiﬁcance in Australia is greater (around 25 per cent
of total employment) than in all other OECD countries except Spain. Australia has also
witnessed a substantial growth in part-time work with 29 per cent of total jobs classiﬁed
as part-time in 2002 and an estimated two-thirds of these comprising casual employment
(Pocock et al., 2004). By employing non-standard workers, especially casual employees,
management reap several beneﬁts, including lower costs (through avoidance of maternity
protection, redundancy pay, paid annual leave including public holiday pay and sick
leave), ﬂexibility to dismiss without worker recourse to unfair dismissal protection and a
capacity to intensify work based on the threat of unemployment and very limited union
protection.

The numerical ﬂexibility model shows a highly positive relationship between the
proportion of female workers in workplaces and the number of part-time workers,
thereby indicating that most part-time workers tend to be women. This is conﬁrmed by
data indicating that, in October 2001, 71 per cent of Australian part-time employees were
women (ABS, 2001). The model begs an important question, though: what is the
mechanism through which numerical ﬂexibility leads to higher labour productivity?
The model indicates a direct relationship, suggesting that it is management’s ability
continually to adjust the sourcing and production of goods and/or services to changes in
market demand that makes the difference. In other words, labour productivity in this
model appears to be strongly related to management’s capacity to secure organizational
ﬂexibility rather than relying on employee motivation, knowledge or skills.

We did ﬁnd some sector differences: manufacturing had a stronger positive
relationship between the proportion of part-time employees and numerical ﬂexibility
than services (although both were very strong). However, the variable indicating the
proportion of females in manufacturing had no impact on numerical ﬂexibility compared
with a high positive relationship in services. This suggests that manufacturing
workplaces use a different mix of labour compared to service establishments to secure
numerical ﬂexibility. In manufacturing, part-time workers are employed to meet
management’s numerical ﬂexibility demands and fewer women are employed. These
women tend to be part of the less ﬂexible core, employed mainly as clerical,
administrative and marketing staff, while in services women comprise a much higher
proportion of the workforce and, as mentioned above, part-time workers, such as
hospitality workers, customer service representatives and sales assistants, tend to be
women.

In manufacturing we ﬁnd a strong positive relationship between numerical ﬂexibility
and labour productivity compared to a small positive relationship for services. Why is
this so? Arguably, manufacturing workplaces that use numerical ﬂexibility are strongly
advantaged, while in services it is more commonly used (particularly in the retail, health
and community service, and property and business service sub-sectors) and consequently
does not confer much of a productivity advantage over competitors. This ﬁnding


1344 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

contradicts the proposition we advanced in the theory section of the paper to the effect
that high-road models of workplace performance would tend to be more effective in
manufacturing. It is, however, consistent with the evidence that increasing competition,
coupled with an institutional context conducive to non-standard working and very
limited incentives to train workers (Watson et al., 2003: ch. 10), has resulted in
manufacturing management taking the low road to high performance.

Having completed our analysis, three limitations of the study are worth bearing in
mind. First, our data did not include all concepts relevant to our research topic (e.g. the ﬁt
between business and HR strategies) and provided limited information on some others
(e.g. labour productivity was measured by a single subjective item). Second, although the
data derived from various related surveys, this is a cross-sectional study, which, like
others of its kind (e.g. Delaney and Huselid, 1996; Guthrie, 2001), does not permit
unequivocal interpretations of causal relations. Third, although SEM methodology has
the advantages described in the ‘Methods’ section, it also has three limitations. These are,
ﬁrst, some of the assumptions on which SEM is based (continuous measurement and
multivariate normality) remain untested, although this is unlikely to be a serious
problem.6 Second, unlike multiple regressions, SEM does not directly control for the
inﬂuence of potential confounding variables. When the goodness-of-ﬁt statistics are
above .95, it can be safely assumed that no confounding occurs. However, in our
empirical analyses, goodness of ﬁt was typically below the .95 threshold, so that
confounding remains a possibility.7 Third, because some of the largest path coefﬁcients
were observed between variables from the same survey source, common source bias
might be a problem. Accordingly, we need to be cautious in drawing conclusions from
our analysis.

Conclusion

In this paper we explore four different models that were designed to explain high
workplace performance. The two high-road variants, which we label the strategic HRM
and organizational trust models respectively, display some strong linkages in the right
direction between environmental and structural variables, on the one hand, and mediating
variables (e.g. communication, trust and ER climate), on the other. However, the
inﬂuence of these variables on relative workplace labour productivity is weak. One of the
low-road models – the labour process model – also showed posited mediators mainly
working in the right direction, with little impact, however, on labour productivity. By
contrast, the ﬁnal low-road model demonstrates inﬂuence paths that are both strong and
in the expected direction, with the proportion of part-time workers in manufacturing
accounting for substantially more numerical ﬂexibility than in service workplaces, where
this variable and the proportion of women employees both contribute to numerical
ﬂexibility. This in turn inﬂuences labour productivity, albeit to a considerably smaller
extent than in manufacturing.

We argue that

the institutional context

is conducive to employers pursuing a
numerical ﬂexibility strategy, which, by tailoring the supply of labour to demand, enables
some management to attain high workplace productivity. We need, however, to be
careful about drawing conclusions from these ﬁndings. This is partly because of the
methodological issues raised in the previous section, but also because we are measuring a
narrow, short-term outcome – current workplace productivity compared to competitors.
If a broader, longer-term, multidimensional concept of performance associated with the
idea of sustainable success was used (Paauwe, 2004: ch. 4), the results might have been
very different. We therefore need to pay more attention to developing more


Orlitzky and Frenkel: Alternative pathways to high-performance workplaces

1345

comprehensive dependent variables. Furthermore, our analyses highlight the need for
further theorizing and research on the relationship between mediating variables and
performance. Motivational arguments relying on variables such as communication, trust
and ER climate fail to work as strongly as anticipated. While measurement problems may
account for some of this explanatory failure (particularly in light of Harter et al., 2002),
our ﬁndings may also suggest the potential importance of cognitive processes (such as
organizational learning, knowledge creation, knowledge sharing) and the role of social
capital (Delery and Shaw, 2001) in accounting for high performance. The likely
importance of these processes points to the need for case studies that would generate new
theory and inform survey design so that the ﬁeld can move beyond the HPWP paradigm.

Notes

1 Owing to measurement problems, we were not able to include extent of contracting-out of work,

minorities as a proportion of the workforce and extent of competition in the product market.

2 We question the construct validity of Ramsay et al.’s. (2000: 527) usage of management reports
of changes in labour productivity in the last ﬁve years as a measure of work intensiﬁcation.
Labour productivity may have various sources aside from increased worker effort. Accordingly,
we prefer to use a composite measure of worker perceptions of work intensiﬁcation as indicated
in Table 2.

3 In some cases, internal consistency among this larger set of items was so low that the path
analyses either did not converge or had inadmissible negative error variances. This evidence
casts doubt on the systemic (i.e. internally consistent) nature of HPWP.

4 We tried a variant of the model inserting ER climate as a mediator between numerical ﬂexibility
and labour productivity. This was based on the proposition that practices such as outsourcing of
labour and hiring of mainly casual, part-time workers will lift worker effort through fear of
possible job loss. However, this mediation model did not converge.

5 At the time of the survey (1995 – 6), the economy was growing at around 3 per cent a year
following a recession. Structural change is indicated by reductions in tariff protection
(in manufacturing from 15 per cent in 1989 – 90 to 8 per cent in 1995 – 6) and institutional
change is signalled by decentralization of the industrial relations system, with workplace
bargaining having been formalized in 1994 following major legislative change. By the time the
survey was undertaken, workplace agreements were becoming a common alternative to
arbitrated award provisions (Morehead et al., 1997: 2 – 7).

6 Although violations of these two assumptions are common and usually ignored, an optimal research
strategy would test these assumptions, particularly multivariate normality. While univariate
normality can be tested relatively easily with Q-Q plots, tests of multivariate normality are complex
and none of the common statistical packages offers these x2 plots (Sharma, 1996). However, we
performed tests of univariate normality on all variables, and most did not violate the assumption of
univariate normality. Even if the assumption of multivariate normality was violated, research
suggests that, in practice, this assumption rarely holds (West et al., 1995).

7 To control for such potential confounding variables, we would need to (1) draw on theory and
specify these confounding variables and (2) collect data on them and control for their impact
statistically.
