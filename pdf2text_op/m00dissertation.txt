The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  explore  the  relationship  between  actual 

dyadic sim ilarity and the work outcomes of job satisfaction and performance ratings 

in a Latin American population. Furthermore, this study included a comparison of the 

traditional difference-score analysis o f sim ilarity with a  m ultiple regression modeling 

approach.  Finally, the multiple  regression technique was used to test Organization- 

Based  Self-Esteem  (OBSE)  as  a  moderator  of  the  relationship  between  dyadic 

sim ilarity and work outcomes.

Participants were 30 supervisors and 118 subordinates employed by the Latin 

American affiliates of an U.S. multi-national oil and gas corporation in the Dominican 

Republic,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  Mexico,  Nicaragua,  Panama,  and  Puerto  Rico. 

Respondents  completed  a  questionnaire  comprised  of demographic  items,  beliefs 

about  ideal 

leadership  behaviors,  Organization-Based  Self-Esteem,  and  a  job 

satisfaction  scale.  Furthermore,  supervisors  provided  performance  rating$ for their 

subordinates.  Matching  supervisor  and  subordinate  responses  resulted  in  115 

matched dyad responses for analysis.

An  effect of dyad  sex sim ilarity on  performance  ratings  was  observed.  The 

mean  performance  rating  for  male  subordinates  of  female  supervisors  was 

significantly lower than  for subordinates  in the other three  dyad  sex combinations. 

There was no significant effect for job satisfaction. The use of difference-scores did 

not  reveal  any  relationship  between  dyadic  sim ilarity  on  beliefs  about  ideal

leadership  behaviors  and  performance  ratings  or job  satisfaction.  This  result was 

confirmed by multiple regression analysis. The multiple regression analysis did reveal 

a  relationship between the jo in t effects o f supervisor and subordinate beliefs about 

ideal leadership behaviors and performance ratings which was not symmetrical and 

did not conform to the models implied by the difference score approach.

The  hypothesis  that  OBSE  moderates  the  relationship  between  dyadic 

sim ilarity  on  beliefs about ideal  leadership  behaviors and  work outcomes  was  not 

supported. However, the multiple regression analysis did  reveal a  moderating effect 

of  OBSE  on  the  relationship  between  supervisor  beliefs  about  ideal  leadership 

behaviors  and  performance  ratings.  Subordinates  with  high  OBSE  received 

consistently  higher  performance 

ratings.  For  subordinates  with 

low  OBSE, 

performance  rating?  varied  with  the  supervisors'  rating?  of  ideal 

leadership 

behaviors.

INTRODUCTION

Managing  diversity  in  the  workforce  has  become  an  important  issue  of 

concern  for  U.S.  businesses.  The  root  of this  concern  is  the  realization  that  the 

demographic  profile  of the  available  workforce  in  the  United  States  is  changing 

(Williams & O'Reilly,  1998). At first,  most of the focus  of the concern  and  interest 

about workforce diversity was concentrated on factors of race, gender, and national 

origin.  Organizations  strived  to  understand  and  manage  the  implications  of  being 

composed of members of these various categories.

As the concept of managing diversity evolved,  however,  organizations  have 

come to extend the  reach of their initiatives to address such additional dimensions 

such  as  education, 

religious  affiliation,  marital  status,  sexual  orientation, 

organizational  hierarchy,  cognitive  style,  and  many  other  cultural  and  individual 

attributes.  Some  general  historical  trends  concerning  how  workplace  diversity  has 

been  approached  by U.S. business  have  been  sketched  by Triandis,  Kurowski,  and 

Gelfand  (1994).  They  described  a  transition  in  thought  from  a  perspective  of 

"difference as a deficit" toward a current perspective in which differences are valued. 

In this current perspective, it is acknowledged that diversity in the workforce not only 

exists  but  is  also  increasingly  difficult  to  avoid.  Therefore,  in  the  interest  of

organizational  effectiveness and  success,  workforce  diversity must  be  understood, 

managed and ultim ately valued and appreciated.

Diversity within Work Groups

One approach to understanding diversity in organizations may be termed the 

sociological tradition. This approach considers diversity in terms of heterogeneity of 

workgroup composition (Tsui & O'Reilly, 1989; Tsui, Egan, & O'Reilly,  1992; Watson, 

Kumar  &  Michaelsen,  1993).  Members  of a  workgroup  are  classified  in  terms  of 

varying  demographic  and  cultural  attributes.  In  the  United  States,  the  White, 

American,  middle-aged,  male  worker  is  considered  as  the  starting  point  in  this 

tradition.  The  outcomes  of  group  heterogeneity  along  these  attributes  are  then 

studied.

Research 

in 

this  area  has  tended 

to 

focus  on 

the  advantages  or 

disadvantages  of  workgroup  heterogeneity  on  group  effectiveness.  Typically,  this 

research  has  found  that  diversity  in  workgroups  can  lead  to  increased  creativity, 

better  quality  of  decisions,  and  the  consideration  of  a  broader  range  of  options 

(Triandis, Hall, & Ewen, 1965). Conversely, some of the potential disadvantages that 

may  result  from  diversity  are  outcomes  such  as  delay  in  coming  to  consensus, 

problems  with  group  cohesion,  and  problems  with  communication  (Watson  et  al., 

1993). Additionally,  increasing workgroup heterogeneity in terms of age and tenure 

has been  linked to individual turnover (Ferris, Judge, Chachere,  & Liden, 1991; Tsui 

&  O'Reilly,  1989;  Tsui,  Egan  &  O'Reilly,  1992)  and  work  group  cohesiveness

(Harrison,  Price, & Bell,  1998;  Riordan & Shore,  1997). Triandis e ta l. (1994) have 

also  reviewed some of the potential advantages and  disadvantages which  diversity 

may have for workgroups as borne  out by the research  literature. They also found 

evidence that workgroups that are  more  heterogeneous are  more creative and  are 

more likely to reach high-quality decisions than homogenous groups.

In  summary,  the  potential  advantages  o f workgroup  diversity seem  to  stem 

from the integration o f multiple inputs and  perspectives that can  increase creativity 

and the range of considered solutions. Workgroup diversity, however, can also result 

in  increased  difficulty  in  communication,  in  a  decrease  in  group-cohesion,  and  in 

delay in  reaching consensus.  However,  given  sufficient time,  heterogeneous teams 

may surmount these disadvantages (Watson et al., 1993).

Supervisor-Subordinate Sim ilarity

A  different  approach  to  researching  and  understanding  diversity  in  the 

workplace  may  be  termed  the  Organizational  Psychology tradition.  This  approach 

focuses  attention  to  differences  and  sim ilarities  between  individuals  rather  than 

concentrating on group composition. In practical terms, this means concentrating on 

heterogeneity  at  the  dyadic  level.  In  organizations,  the  dyads  of  most  common 

interest are the ones composed by supervisors and subordinates. For the purposes of 

this  paper,  the term  "dyad”  will  refer to  these  supervisor-subordinate  pairs  rather 

than the  more general  instance of a social  dyad.  Furthermore,  in  a  dyadic context.

the terms "diversity* and "similarity* are interchangeable since they denote opposite 

sides of the same conceptual coin.

Research in dyadic sim ilarity has tended to examine the relationship between 

this  sim ilarity and  various job  outcomes for  dyad  members  such  as  performance 

rating$,  selection  decisions, salary recommendations,  and affective outcomes such 

as  job  satisfaction  and  interpersonal  attraction  (Alliger,  Janak,  Streeter,  Byrne  & 

Turban,  1993). In addition, studies researching the Leader-Member Exchange model 

have  examined  the  relationship  between  supervisor-subordinate  sim ilarity and  the 

development and  quality of dyadic exchange (Basu  & Green,  1995;  Oeluga,  1998; 

Graen & Schiemann, 1978; Liden, Wayne & Stilwell, 1993; McClane, 1991; Phillips & 

Bedeian, 1994). The primary emphasis of this paper is on the particular outcomes of 

performance evaluations and job satisfaction.

Forms of Dyadic Similarity

In  a  discussion  of dyadic sim ilarity, Turban  and  Jones  (1988)  attempted  to 

draw  some  useful  conceptual  distinctions  between  three  forms  of sim ilarity.  They 

named these: actual sim ilarity, perceived sim ilarity, and perceptual congruence.

Actual similarity refers to an objective comparison between two individuals on 

some  attribute.  This  type  of sim ilarity  is  perhaps  easiest to  comprehend  when  it 

refers to directly observable and measurable variables. For these kinds of attributes, 

it is often conceptually simple to consider a match or degree of closeness (e.g., age,

height,  sex).  When  the  attributes  o f  interest  are  psychological  variables,  this 

comparison becomes more conceptually complex.

Perceived similarity refers to a subjective comparison  by an  individual about 

his or her closeness to a target person along some attribute. This type of measure is 

obtained  by asking respondents to make a judgment. Because of the psychological 

nature of this assessment, this judgment of sim ilarity may not be directly related to 

an objective degree of sim ilarity between respondents on the relevant attribute.

Turban  and  Jones  (1988)  posited  perceptual  congruence  to  refer  to  the 

sim ilarity  between 

the  perceptions  (or  evaluations)  of  supervisors  and  of 

subordinates  of  mutually  experienced  cues  or  events.  As  an  example,  they 

considered  perceptions  by  supervisors  and  subordinates  about  those  behaviors 

considered important toward receiving a raise in pay.

There  is  a  conceptual  distinction  between  actual  sim ilarity  and  perceptual 

congruence which calls for elaboration  in  order to avoid confusion. Some confusion 

may occur when the compared attribute is a cognition or an evaluation. For instance, 

Turban and Jones (1988), cited studies by Triandis (1959; 1960) among examples of 

studies considering actual  sim ilarity.  Nevertheless, the type of sim ilarity considered 

in these studies was the sim ilarity between semantic categories used by participants 

to  describe  pictures.  These  were  arguably  studies  of  the  sim ilarity  between 

perceptions  of  mutually  experienced  cues  or  events  and  thus  could  have  been 

termed studies of perceptual congruence.

The term perceptual congruence applies, then, to situations in which there is 

a  comparison  of some  manner  of assessment or judgment o f an  external  cue  or 

event  rather  than  the  comparison  between  levels  of  an  internal  variable.  If  the 

judgment is internal fo r both dyad members, the sim ilarity form is best termed actual 

sim ilarity. As an illustrative example, the term of perceptual congruence would apply 

to the comparison of estimates by dyad members of room temperature. The term of 

actual sim ilarity would apply to a comparison of ratings by each dyad member o f how 

cold they fe lt Clearly, the semantic difference between the two cases can be subtle.

Dimensions of Sim ilarity 

It is important to emphasize that there isn’t  a general, dimensionless quality 

of  “sim ilarity”  (Cronbach  &  Gleser,  1953).  Sim ilarity  is  a  meaningful  concept  only 

inasmuch  as there  is a  dimension  or attribute along which to  make a  comparison. 

Furthermore,  there  are  an  infinite  number of dimensions  along which  people  may 

differ.  Within  the  studies  reviewed  for this  paper,  the  different  dimensions  along 

which sim ilarity has been assessed include various demographic variables (e.g. age, 

sex,  race),  various  attitudes,  values  and  beliefs  (both  work-related  and  personal), 

perceptions  of mutually experienced  events  or organizational  contexts,  and  overall 

perceived sim ilarity.

Generally, the study of the effects of sim ilarity in organizational  research  has 

been  approached  from  a  nomothetic  perspective.  That  is,  researchers  have 

attempted  to  identify  certain  dimensions  along which  sim ilarity  has  an  predictable

effect  on  dyad  members  as  a  group.  Although  this  approach  may  continue  to  be 

fruitful,  it  is  likely that  a  complementary  idiographic  approach  to  these  kinds  of 

questions may be necessary in order to explore adequately these effects. It may be 

that specific dimensions may vary in  importance or salience for each  individual or 

dyad (Wexley, Greenawalt, & Couch, 1980).

How Does Sim ilarity Affect Dyad Outcomes?

A  review  o f the organizational  research  literature  reveals  that there  isn't a 

consensus  regarding  a  single,  unified  explanation  of  the  link  between  dyadic 

sim ilarity and individual outcomes such as job satisfaction or performance. However, 

the  explanations or theories of the underlying mechanism  may be  organized  under 

two basis types: direct and indirect

*Direct" Mechanisms 

Direct  explanations  posit  that  there  is  something  about  actual  sim ilarity 

between dyad  members which facilitates enhanced  performance or causes positive 

affect about the job.  For example,  actual sim ilarity  in  work-related  values  between 

supervisor  and  subordinates  may  lead  to  an  improved  understanding  of  what 

particular  behaviors  may  be  important  to  achieve  a  higher  performance  rating 

(Meglino, Ravlin, & Adkins,  1989).  For instance,  perceiving the work-environment in 

sim ilar ways may lead to more effective communication and  less  role ambiguity for 

sim ilar dyad  members than for dissim ilar members (Wexley, Alexander, Greenawalt, 

& Couch,  1980).  It may also  lead to a  more accurate prediction o f the supervisor's

future  behavior (Wexley &  Pulakos,  1983). Some  researchers  have suggested that 

congruent  perceptions  of  the  work  environment  is  intrinsically  satisfying  and 

rewarding (Pulakos & Wexley, 1983; Wexley, Alexander, Greenawalt, & Couch, 1980).

*Indirect* Mechanisms

Instead of direct effects on  performance and satisfaction, some researchers 

have suggested that sim ilarity may have an  indirect effect on these outcomes.  For 

example, perceiving the other as sim ilar may lead to elevated interpersonal attraction 

(Byrne,  1971) which may be positive and reinforcing. This positive affect could then 

bias performance evaluations. Being perceived as sim ilar may also lead to "similar-to- 

me"  biases  that  could  lead  to  inflated  performance  evaluations,  especially  if the 

evaluator has  high  occupational self-esteem  (Judge & Ferris,  1993; Tsui & O’Reilly, 

1989;  Pulakos  &  Wexley,  1983;  Zalesny  &  Kirsch,  1989).  Mobley  (1982)  has 

suggested that raters are less confident about the accuracy of their ratings of others 

they perceive as different and thus are less likely to make extreme high or low ratings 

to dissimilar others.

Within  the framework of the  Leader-Member  Exchange  (LMX)  model  (Graen,

1976), it has been suggested that in-group status would be more likely to be granted 

to  subordinates  who  were  perceived  as  compatible  and 

trustworthy.  These 

attributions could  be affected  by perceptions of sim ilarity (Graen,  1976;  Kemelgor, 

1982). Greater perceived sim ilarity between dyad members may be positively related 

to  higher quality exchanges (Graen  & Schiemann,  1978;  Kemelgor,  1982;  Steiner,

1988) and mutual dissim ilarity is likely to lead to lower quality exchanges (Pulakos & 

Wexley, 1983).

Moderators of Dyadic Similarity-Individual Outcomes Relationships

To some extent, the inconsistencies found in the strength and direction o f the 

relationship between dyadic sim ilarity and work outcomes may be a function of the 

very  number  of  different  dimension  variables  considered.  Nevertheless,  these 

inconsistencies may also point to the need to consider possible moderator variables 

in  order to  improve  the  understanding of the  relationships  under  study  (Baron  & 

Kenny, 1986).

Several  authors  have suggested  a  variety of possible  moderating variables. 

One such  variable  is Time.  Weiss (1978) suggested  that the  relationship  between 

supervisor-subordinate  sim ilarity and  associated  work  outcomes  may  change  over 

time  as the  result o f a  socializing  process.  Other  authors,  researching the  leader- 

member exchange (LMX)  model,  have also  posited  a  developmental  process which 

moderates the effect of dyadic sim ilarity (Graen  & Schiemann,  1978; Liden, Wayne 

&  Stilwell,  1993;  Steiner,  1988).  Harrison,  Price,  &  Bell,  (1998)  considered  the 

moderating effect o f tim e on the effect of demographic and  attitudinal sim ilarity on 

ratings  of  group  cohesiveness.  They  argued  that  tim e  allowed  group  and  dyad 

members  to  collect  more  information  about  others.  Early  in  group  or  dyad 

membership, member outcomes may be affected  by perceived sim ilarity with easily 

accessible and salient cues such as member sex and race. Over tim e, as group and

member dyads interact, the effect of these cues lessen and  "deeper” sim ilarities in 

attitudes and values become more important.

Self-esteem  is  another  variable  that  has  been  proposed  as  a  potential 

moderator between  dyadic sim ilarity and work outcomes. Self-Esteem and  its work- 

specific version of Organization-Based Self-Esteem (OBSE) has been suggested as an 

interesting  moderator for  a  variety of  work-related  relationships  (Pierce,  Gardner, 

Dunham,  &  Cummings,  1993;  Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  &  Dunham,  1989;  see 

also Tharenou,  1979). More specifically, a few authors have suggested that it might 

moderate the  relationship  o f dyadic sim ilarity and  work outcomes  (S. Adler,  1983; 

Weiss, 1978; Wexley, Alexander, Greenawalt & Couch,  1980; see also Hill & Ritchie,

1977).

A  large  number of other  potential  moderators  have  been  suggested  in  the 

literature. Some of these variables  have been  related to the structure of the job or 

organization  such  as  the  form ality  or  specificity  of  job  roles  (Senger,  1971)  or 

supervisor  span  of  control  or  leadership  style  (Meglino,  Ravlin,  &  Adkins,  1992; 

Wexley,  Alexander,  Greenawalt,  &  Couch,  1980)  or  whether  the  organization  is 

voluntary,  socially-oriented  or  formal,  production-oriented  (Feren,  Carroll  &  Olian, 

1988).  Wexley  et  al.  (1980)  suggested  that  the  importance  or  salience  of  the 

dimensions under consideration to each of the dyad  members  might moderate any 

relationships  with  outcomes.  Wexley  &  Pulakos  (1983)  suggested  that  within  the 

dyad, supervisor effectiveness might moderate the effect of sim ilarity on outcomes.

There  are  undoubtedly  countless  variables  which  may  be  proposed  as 

interesting  moderators  of  relationships  between  dyadic  sim ilarity  and  individual 

outcomes.  Nevertheless,  the  previous  discussion  was focused  on  the  suggestions 

that have been made in the literature more narrowly relevant to this study. It is clear 

from a review of the literature that there has been scant empirical research on these 

or  ariy  other  moderators  of  the  relationship  between  dyadic  sim ilarity  and  work 

outcomes.

Similarity in an International Context

Many U.S. multinationals have incorporated the concept of managing diversity 

and diversity training into their management philosophy and planning and are trying 

to extend the concept to their international operations ("Diversity Training Extends," 

1993; Solomon, 1994). However, the underlying concepts and rationale for diversity 

management are rooted in the business context of the United States. Companies that 

wish to extend their diversity policies to their international operations are faced with 

the  issue  of  understanding  what  diversity  management  would  mean  in  other 

countries  and  cultures.  At  the  very  least,  they  must  understand  whether  the 

principles they employ  in  their domestic  operations  w ill translate to  other cultures 

(Grove & Hallowell, 1995; Laurent 1983).

Nevertheless,  the  study  of  supervisor-subordinate  sim ilarity  has  not  been 

widely extended to  international  populations. A review of literature reveals that with 

few exceptions, the  vast  majority of sim ilarity studies  have  been  conducted  in  the

United  States.  Furthermore,  the  exceptions  have  been  concerned  mostly  with 

demographic  similarity.  There  are,  nonetheless,  good  theoretical  and  practical 

reasons  why  research  efforts should  be  extended  to  other  populations.  Extending 

similarity research to other countries and populations will  help improve the  process 

of  model-building  and  theory development.  The  countless  variables  introduced  by 

different national contexts will force new theories and models to be more robust and 

generaiizabie (N. Adler, 1983; Boyacigiller & Adler, 1991). An example of the type of 

variability  which  different  national  cultures  introduce  may  be  seen  in  Hofstede’s 

(1980)  work  on  national  values.  He  has  found  that  cultures  differ  in  their 

endorsement of four values: masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and 

individualism.  Each  of these values  has  implications for organizational  research  in 

general and the effects of dyadic similarity in particular.

Extending the study of dyadic similarity in organizations to other countries also 

has  practical value.  For instance,  U.S.  companies that expand their operations into 

international  markets will find themselves composed of a greater mix of employees 

from  different  countries.  For these  organizations,  enhanced  understanding  of the 

implications  of  this  increasing  diversity  will  be  necessary  for  a  more  effective 

management of their human resources.

As previously noted, few studies have considered similarity in an international 

context Of these, some have considered the relationship of work group demography 

to  individual outcomes.  For example, for a sample of top-level Japanese managers,

Wiersema  and  Bird  (1993) considered the variables of age,  team tenure,  and  the 

prestige  of  the  university  attended.  They  examined  the  relationship  between  an 

individual's attributes and the composition of his work group. No mention was made 

of sex. They found that managers who were dissimilar from their workgroup in age or 

university prestige were more likely to leave. Kirchmeyer (1995) asked a sample of 

Canadian graduates of a business school to provide information about several work 

experiences such  as challenge and supervisor support.  Measures of organizational 

commitment and  promotions were also taken. She found that dissimilarity with the 

work group along the variables of education and age was  related to  lower reported 

work  group  fit  and  reported  challenge.  In  study  of  the  relationship  of  dyadic 

demographic similarity with  organizational  attachment  in  a  Mexican  manufacturing 

facility,  Pelled  and  Xin  (1997)  found  absenteeism  was  lower  for  same-sex 

subordinate-supervisor  dyads.  The  also  found  that  age  similarity  was  negatively 

associated  with  absenteeism  but  also  negatively  associated  with  organizational 

commitment.

Even 

fewer  studies  have  studied  perceived  similarity  or  perceptual 

congruence with  non-U.S.  populations.  In a  lab study, Steiner (1988) asked  college 

students  in the  United  States and  France to complete a  work-related  value survey. 

Then, the students were asked to  read  vignettes describing a  hypothetical job and 

supervisor  in  either  high-  or  low-LMX  terms.  Finally,  the  students  were  asked  to 

complete  the  value  survey  again  as  they  thought  their  hypothetical  supervisor

(described in the vignette) would have responded. Steiner found that his participants 

ascribed  more similar values to the  imagined supervisor in the  high-LMX condition 

than  in  the  low-LMX  condition.  Furthermore,  French  students  ascribed  greater 

similarity to the imagined supervisor than did the U.S. students.

In  another  lab  study,  Thomas  and  Ravlin  (1995)  showed  videotapes  of  a 

Japanese manager interacting with U.S. subordinates to U.S. employees of Japanese 

manufacturing  firms  in  the  United  States.  The  tapes  were  varied  to  depict  the 

manager acting either in  a typical Japanese  manner or  in  an  "American”  culturally 

adapted  manner.  Culturally  adapted  behavior  by  the  Japanese  manager  was 

positively related to ratings of perceived similarity.  Furthermore, cultural adaptation 

was positively related to perceptions of managerial effectiveness.

Marion-Landais  (1993)  found  a  significant  positive  relationship  with  job 

satisfaction  for  perceived  similarity  and  perceptual  congruence  for  work-related 

values. Interestingly, although the relationship between perceived similarity and facet 

satisfaction  with  supervision  was  positive  and  strong for both  Dominican  and  U.S. 

managers,  this  relationship  did  not  hold  for  actual  similarity.  No  significant 

relationship was found  between facet satisfaction with supervision and actual value 

similarity for  Dominican  managers and  a  negative  relationship  was found  for  U.S. 

managers.

In  summary,  research  in  this  area  has  not  been  extensive.  A search  of the 

literature did  not turn  up any published research directly comparing dyad  members.

Furthermore, other than Marion-Landais (1993) and Pelled and Xin (1997), no other

The Quantification and Analysis o f Similarity 

Difference Scores

In  organizational  research,  similarity  has  often  been  operationalized  for 

analysis by collapsing two component measures into a single index (Edwards, 1994). 

These include indices such as the simple algebraic-difference or discrepancy score (X 

- Y), the absolute value of differences IX- Y |, and squared-difference (X-Y)2.

These kinds of unitary indices, however, are subject to problems and concerns 

which  have  led  to  them  being  considered  undesirable  for  similarity  research 

(Cronbach  &  Furby,  1970;  Edwards,  1994a,  1994b;  Johns,  1981).  Despite these 

problems, however, some researchers have maintained that their use is appropriate 

(Tisak  &  Smith,  1994).  An  important concern  is  parsimony  (Johns,  1981;  Tisak  & 

Smith,  1994;  White,  Crino,  &  Hatfield,  1985). The  concern  is that the  explanatory 

contribution  by  a  difference  score  index  should  be  different  from  any  variance 

explained  by  its  separate  components.  Edwards  (1994a,  -1994b)  argued  that  it  is 

statistically impossible for a difference score index to account for more variance than 

its  component  scores.  In  fact,  the  difference  score  may  confound  the  unitary 

relationship of either of the component terms with the third variable of interest. Tisak 

& Smith (1994), however, argued that this is an empirical question.

1 6

The  most  consistently cited  problem  with  difference  scores  concerns their 

reliability (Edwards,  1994a; Johns, 1981; Tisak & Smith,  1994). The reliability of a 

difference  score  is  a  function  of  the  reliabilities  of  the  individual  component 

measures,  their  variances,  and  their  inter-correlation.  It  can  be  shown  that  the 

reliability  of  a  difference  score  will  be  less  than  the  average  reliability  of  its 

component  measures  as  a  function  of  the  positive  correlation  between  the 

component measures (Johns, 1981; Tisak & Smith, 1994).

Another  potential  problem  with  difference  scores  is  that  they  will  tend  to 

reflect primarily the effect of the component score with the most variance (Edwards, 

1994a,  1994b). This can be a particular problem in studies that compare the scores 

of subordinates with  a set of fewer superiors. Another important concern  regarding 

the  use  of difference  score  indices  may  be  placed  under the  rubric  of  construct- 

validity.  Difference  score  indices  which  involve  absolute  or squared  values  ignore 

information concerning the direction of differences. The implicit assumption  in  using 

these indices is that direction of differences is not important to the underlying model. 

This assumption,  however,  is apparently not explicitly considered  in  many proposed 

models (Edwards, 1994a; Johns, 1981; Tisak & Smith, 1994).

Profile-Similarity Indices

In  organizational  research on similarity, three or more component measures 

are  sometimes  collapsed  into  a  single  profile-similarity  index.  Some  of  the  most 

commonly used are the sum of absolute differences, the sum of squared-differences.

17

the  square  root  of the  sum  of squared-differences,  and  the  correlation  between 

component measure profiles (Cronbach &  Gleser, 1953; Edwards, 1994b).

Limitations of these profile-similarity indices are generally extensions of their 

bivariate counterparts. Furthermore,  in  many cases, the dimensions over which the 

indices  are  collapsed  are  conceptually distinct and  these  indices tend  to  obscure 

their individual effects. Edwards (1994b) argues further that the linear models which 

underlie  these  indices  imply  a  set  of very  restrictive  assumptions  concerning the 

relative  contributions of the  component dimensions.  These  assumptions  are  rarely 

empirically verified.

The profile-similarity index created by calculating the correlation  between the 

matched  individual items (Q) also share these limitations. Additionally,  however, this 

index also confounds the effects of the component dimensions such that observed 

relationships  may represent anything from  the effect of a  single component to the 

combined  effects  of  all  the  components  (Edwards,  1994b).  The  correlation, 

moreover,  indicates similarity in  profile shape and  discards information  on  distance 

between profiles.

Multiple Regression Analysis

The  use  of  multiple  regression  analysis  has  been  suggested  as  a  viable 

alternative  to  the  use  of  difference  scores  (Cronbach,  1958,  Edwards,  1994b). 

Regression  approaches  avoid  the  limitations  surrounding  difference  scores  as 

discussed  above.  Regression  techniques  allow  for  the  analysis  of  the  joint

relationship of supervisor and subordinate scores without necessarily imposing any 

assumed constraints on the relationship. Although  regression techniques avoid the 

problems with  unitary difference scores,  they cannot be  used  with  more than  two 

matched components at a time. These approaches, therefore, are not well-suited to 

the study of profile similarity.

Regression analysis allows for two general approaches to the study of dyadic 

similarity. One is to simply test for the significance of the crossproduct term between 

supervisor and  subordinate scores  (Cronbach,  1958;  Berger-Gross,  1982;  Deluga, 

1998).).  This  test  reveals  whether  the  interaction  between  subordinate  and 

supervisor scores explains any of the variance of the outcome of interest The other 

approach  is to  use  multiple regression  techniques to develop an  explicit estimated 

model  describing the  relationship  between  supervisor and  subordinate scores and 

the  outcome  of interest (Edwards,  1994a;  1994b;  1995;  Edwards &  Parry,  1993). 

Furthermore, an extension of the regression analysis approach allows for the testing 

of moderator variables.

Crossproduct Term in Hierarchical Regression

The crossproduct term is tested by controlling for the individual effects of the 

dyad member scores and testing the effect of the interaction term. The dyad member 

scores, (X and Y), for the dimension along which similarity is being investigated are 

entered as a  block in the first step of a  hierarchical  regression.  In the second step, 

the  crossproduct  term  (XY)  is  entered.  A  significant  increase  in  the  variance

19

accounted for by the regression  model with the crossproduct included is considered 

a  confirmation  of  a  relationship  between  dyadic  similarity  and  the  dependent 

variable.

An  advantage  of  the  hierarchical  regression  technique  is  that  nuisance 

variables can be controlled for by entering them in as a block as a first step, before 

entering the  dyadic scores  of  interest.  A disadvantage  of this technique  is that  it 

doesn't  fully  consider  the  form  of  the  relationship  between  the  dyadic  scores. 

Although  it might indicate that the interaction between the scores is significant, this 

approach does not provide  more  information  about the full form of the  relationship 

between the dyad terms and the outcome of interest

Berger-Gross  (1982)  compared  the  Mahalanobis  D  with  the  regression 

technique mentioned  above in a study of the relationship  between  dyadic similarity 

and  job  stress.  She  asked  first-level  managers  and  their  supervisors  to  rate  the 

importance  of  role  expectations for the job  of first-level  manager.  She also  asked 

subordinates to guess what ratings their supervisors would provide. Berger-Gross was 

able to calculate a similarity index for three kinds of similarity. The first, a measure of 

actual  similarity,  was  the  comparison  of  subordinate  responses  and  supervisor 

responses.  The  second,  a  measure  of  perceived  similarity,  was  the  comparison 

between  subordinate  responses  and  the  subordinate  guesses  as  to  what  their 

supervisors would respond. The third, a measure of perceptual congruence, was the 

comparison  between  the  subordinate  guesses  of  what  their  supervisors  would

respond and the actualsupervisory responses. The dependent variables in her study 

were  four  measures  of  job-related  stress  which  she  regressed  onto  the  three 

similarity indices. Her initial findings indicated the existence of relationships between 

the similarity indices with the job-related stress  measures.  However,  when  Berger- 

Gross applied the regression, technique, she found that the crossproduct terms did 

not add  a significant amount of variance explained to the  model. Furthermore,  she 

found that the majority o f the variance explained was attributable to the subordinate 

guesses of how their supervisors would respond.

Deluga  (1998)  applied  this  regression  technique  in  an  investigation  of the 

relationship  between  subordinate-supervisor  conscientiousness  similarity  and 

supervisor  ratings of subordinate  performance.  In  his analysis,  he first entered  the 

variables of sex, age, organizational tenure for both dyad members along with tenure 

with  supervisor for  subordinates  as  block.  He  then  entered  both  dyad  members' 

responses for the conscientiousness  measure.  Finally,  he  entered the supervisor X 

subordinate  conscientiousness  crossproduct  He found that this  crossproduct term 

added a significant amount of variance explained to his regression model.

Response-Surface Modeling

Edwards (1994a;  1994b) suggested that unitary congruence indices such as 

the algebraic-difference score assume a specific form of the relationship between the 

matched attributes (or component measures) and the dependent outcome which has 

not  necessarily  been  theorized  or  empirically  validated.  As  the  simplest  case,

consider the algebraic-difference score, if the matched characteristics or component 

measures are termed as X and Y then using an algebraic-difference score to predict 

an outcome Z implies the following regression equation: Z = bo + bi(X-Y) + e.

This equation expands to the following:

Z *b a + b iX -b iY  + e 

(1)

If instead of a difference score, the component measures X and Y are used as 

independent  predictors,  the  resulting  unconstrained  regression  equation  is  the 

following:

Z = bo + biX + b2Y + e. 

(2)

A comparison of the unconstrained regression equation (Equation 2) with the 

equation  derived from the difference score (Equation  1)  reveals that the difference 

score equation is a special case of the former with the constraint that the regression 

coefficient for X (b^)  is equal and opposite to the regression  coefficient of Y (- b2 )> 

Edwards (1994b) has pointed out that researchers who have used difference scores 

have tested the significance of the relationship between the index and an outcome. 

This  is  equivalent to  determining whether the  shared  coefficient  b i  in  Equation  1

differs from zero. This is an incomplete analysis, he has argued, since the constraint 

implied  by the difference score  index (b i *  -to)  must also  be demonstrated  to  be 

valid. This can be done by using the unconstrained regression equation (Equation 2) 

and  then  directly testing the difference  between the coefficients  (Cohen  &  Cohen, 

1983,  p.  479-480;  Edwards,  1994b). Another way of verifying the constraint is  by 

testing the difference between the squared multiple correlations attained by both the 

difference score regression equation and unconstrained regression equation (Cohen 

&  Cohen,  1983,  p.  145;  Edwards,  1994b). 

If  the  constraint  is  valid,  the 

unconstrained  equation  should  not  explain  significantly  more  variance  than  the 

constrained equation.

The algebraic-difference score represents a model of the surface relating the 

component  measures  to  the  outcome  which  constitutes  a  plane  in  which  both 

attributes  (X  and  Y)  exhibit  equal  and  opposite  linear  effects  on  the  dependent 

outcome.  A  sample  plot  representing  this  surface  is  displayed  in  Figure  1.  As 

demonstrated in the figure, this model assumes no effect on the third outcome (Z) so 

long as X and  Y equal  each  other. As the  matched  variables depart from  equality, 

there is a symmetrical effect on the outcome variable. The failure to test the implied 

constraint,  however,  means that the researcher has failed to demonstrate that this 

model  is  in fact a  reasonable  representation  of the data. This  incomplete analysis,

alternative models such as one where the components exhibit opposite but unequal 

effects.

The squared-difference score represents the following regression equation: Z

= bo + bi(X-Y)2 + e.

This equation expands to the following:

Z = bo + biX2-2biXY + biY2 + e 

(3)

The  unconstrained  regression  equation  includes  the  same  quadratic terms 

plus the linear terms X and Y as control variables in the following equation :

Z = bo + biX + bzY  + bsX2  + b4XY + bsY2 + e 

(4)

In  this  case,  comparing  the  unconstrained  Equation  4  to  the  constrained 

equation  3  reveals  that  the  squared-difference  score 

imposes  the  following 

constraints on the  unconstrained  equation:  The  regression  coefficients for X and Y 

terms are  both  zero (b i - b2 =0).  Furthermore, the regression  coefficients for the X2 

and Y2 terms are equal to each other (b3 8 bs).  Finally, the regression coefficient X2 

term is twice the size of and opposite in sign to the XY crossproduct term (b4 = -2b3).

Edwards  (1994a;1994b)  proposed 

response-surface  modeling  as  an 

alternative  approach  to  the  analysis  of  similarity  or  congruence  in  organization 

research. The methodology he suggested is based on three basic principles:

1. The relationship between similarity and an outcome should be considered in three 
dimensions.  The  compared  attributes  are  mapped  on  the  X  and  Y  axes  and  the 
outcome variable is mapped on the Z axis;

2. The relationship between similarity and an outcome should be viewed as a three- 
dimensional response-surface; and

3. The models implied by similarity indices should not be imposed a priori on the data 
but  should  instead  be  considered  as testable  hypotheses.  These  models  may  be 
formulated based on theory or derived from analyses of an exploratory nature. If the 
analysis  is  exploratory,  any  model  found  to  best  describe  the  observed  surface 
should be considered tentative pending cross-validation.

Edwards  and  Parry  (1993)  applied  the  regression  modeling technique  in  a 

study of the congruence  between  the  perceived  (X)  and  desired  (Y)  amount of job 

dimensions and  its  relationship  with  various  measures of psychological  strain.  The 

job  dimensions  were job  complexity  and  quantitative  workload.  The  measures  of 

psychological strain  included job dissatisfaction, workload dissatisfaction,  boredom, 

depression,  and  anxiety.  They found  that the  data  did  not support the  constraints 

implied  by the various unitary difference scores. Instead, they found that they could 

describe  the  data  better  with  more  complex  quadratic  and  cubic  polynomial 

regression models.

Edwards (1994b) also applied the regression modeling approach to the study 

of congruence  between  perceived  and  preferred  amounts  of certain job  attributes

and  its  relationship  with  satisfaction  with  these  same  attributes.  Two  groups  of 

participants were included in  his study: MBA students and  business executives. The 

attributes under study for the MBA students reflected time spent on the job engaged 

in 

the  following  activities:  planning/coordination,  decision-making,  processing 

paperwork,  exchanging  information,  and  motivating/rewarding  others.  For  the 

executive  sample,  the  attributes  were  opportunity for growth,  input  into  decisions, 

rewards  received,  and  workload.  For  both  samples,  respondents  were  asked  to 

provide a perceived rating (X) and a preferred (Y) rating for each attribute. They were 

also asked to complete a satisfaction  measure for each  of the attributes.  Edwards 

(1994b)  calculated  a  variety of unitary difference scores,  as  discussed  previously, 

and correlated these indices with the satisfaction measures. Generally, he found that 

most of the difference scores were similarly correlated with the outcome scores.  He 

pointed out, however, that the form  underlying these difference scores was different 

Nevertheless,  there  was  no  evidence  of which  form  best fit the data.  Applying the 

regression modeling technique, he found that in all cases, the constraints implied by 

the difference scores were not supported. The unconstrained models were a better fit 

to  the  data  than  the  constrained  versions.  He  concluded  that  the  forms  of  the 

relationships observed were more complex than what the implied models underlying 

the difference scores could represent.

Actual Similarity

Tsui  and  O'Reilly  (1989)  reviewed  previous  research  which  investigated 

the  correlates  of  demographic  attributes  of  individuals  within  organizational 

settings. The majority of this research was focused on outcomes or relationships 

associated with the demographic characteristics  of individuals.  They suggested 

that  missing  from  this  body of research  was  a  consideration  of the  interaction 

between the demographic characteristics of dyad members. They referred to this 

comparative study of demographic attributes as relational demography because 

it takes into consideration the levels (or values) of demographic variables of one 

dyad  member  relative  to  the  other.  Although  much  of  the  research  in  actual 

similarity  between  supervisors  and  dyads  has  been  of  relational  demography, 

some  other  types  of  variables  that  have  been  compared  include  attitudes, 

values,  and beliefs.

Actual Similarity and Performance

The  results  of  studies  investigating  the  relationship  between  relational 

demographics  and  performance  have  not  been  consistent.  Demographic 

similarity  has  not  been  consistently  found  to  be  associated  with  performance 

ratings.  The demographic attributes along which similarity was found to  have an 

effect  have  also  not  been  consistent.  Mobley  (1982)  found  no  interaction 

between supervisor sex and subordinate sex with performance as the dependent 

variable.  On the other hand, within a sample of 272 managerial dyads, Tsui and 

O'Reilly  (1989) found that subordinates  in  mixed-sex dyads were  rated  as  less 

effective.  Nevertheless, they also included the variables of age,  race,  education,

and job tenure in their study and found no relationship between  similarity along 

these  variables  and 

ratings  of  subordinate  effectiveness.  Similarity 

in 

educational 

level  was  found  to  be  significantly  correlated  to  subordinate 

performance  ratings  by Zalesny  and  Kirsch  (1989)  for a  sample  of corrections 

officers.  They also considered sex,  race,  age,  and tenure in this study although 

they 

found  none  of 

these  demonstrated  a  similarity  relationship  with 

performance.

Although  they  did  not  provide  an  explicit  rationale  for doing  so,  Turban 

and Jones (1988) collapsed the variables of race,  educational  level,  department 

tenure,  and  age  into  a  single  index of demographic similarity.  They found  this 

index to  be modestly correlated with job  performance  ratings.  Judge  and  Ferris 

(1993)  included  age  and  job  tenure  in  a  model-building  study  of  the  social 

context of performance evaluations.  They found a positive  relationship between 

similarity along these variables and supervisor affect.  Furthermore, they found a 

relationship between supervisor affect and ratings of subordinate performance.

The  pattern  of results for studies  of the  relationship  between  attitude  or 

value  similarity  and  performance  is  inconsistent.  Senger  (1971),  for  instance, 

found  a  positive  relationship.  He  asked  managers  to  rank  their  immediate 

subordinates based on "all-around competence." He found that the subordinates 

who  were  ranked  higher  in  competence  tended  to  have  more  similar  value 

orientations  to  the  managers than  did  the  lower ranked  subordinates.  Meglino, 

Ravlin,  and  Adkins  (1989)  found  a  small  yet  significant  negative  correlation

between  supervisor-subordinate work-value similarity and  archival  performance 

ratings.  They  found  that workers  who  ranked  their work-values  on  an  ipsative 

scale  in  a  manner more  similar to their supervisors  tended  to  have  received  a 

lower performance evaluation in quality and quantity dimensions.

Wexley,  Alexander,  Greenawalt,  and Couch  (1980)  asked  participants to 

respond 

to  semantic  differential  scales 

for  seven  concepts  such  as 

responsibility,  loyalty,  and  belief  in  authority.  They  found  a  small  significant 

positive  correlation  for  supervisor-subordinate  similarity  and  performance  only 

for the concept of social  values.  On the other hand,  Zalesny and  Kirsch  (1989) 

no relationship between belief similarity and performance ratings for corrections 

officers and their supervisors.  In this case,  the beliefs in question were attitudes 

concerning the treatment of criminals.  Using a hierarchical  regression approach, 

Deluga 

(1998) 

found 

that 

supervisor-subordinate 

similarity 

on 

a

conscientiousness  scale  was  significantly  related  to  supervisor  ratings  of 

subordinate in-role behavior.

Actual Similarity and Job Satisfaction

Turban  and  Jones  (1988)  found  a  small  negative  correlation  between 

their singular demographic similarity  index and job  satisfaction.  They  indicated 

that this relationship primarily reflected racial similarity.  Subordinates were more 

satisfied  in  mixed-race dyads than  in  same-race  dyads.  They did  not speculate 

on this counter-intuitive finding.

31

Tsui  and  O'Reilly  (1989)  did  not  include  job  satisfaction  in  their  study, 

nevertheless,  subordinates  in  mixed  sex  dyads  reported  higher  levels  of  role 

conflict  and  ambiguity  than  those  in  same-sex  dyads.  The  four  remaining 

studies,  which  have explored the relationship  between  actual  similarity and job 

satisfaction,  have  all  included  attitudes,  values,  or  beliefs  as  independent 

variables.  For each of these, a modest positive relationship has been found.

Kemelgor  (1982)  administered  the  Job  Descriptive  Index  (JDI)  (Smith, 

Kendall,  &  Hulin,  1969)  to  supervisors  and  subordinates  along  with  a  group  of 

bipolar word-pairings.  Using  a factor-analytic procedure,  he  developed  a  value 

scale  of three  dimensions from  the word-pairs.  He  then  scored  the  dimensions 

for each supervisor and subordinate to create a value profile. W ithin their work­

group,  subordinates  were  then  rank-ordered  by  each  of  their  JDI  dimension 

scores.  The  highest  and  lowest  ranking  subordinates  on  each  dimension  had 

their value scale scores compared to their supervisor.  For the satisfaction facets 

of  Work  Itself  and  Supervision,  he  found  that  a  significantly  greater  than 

expected number of supervisor-subordinate comparisons resulted in the highest- 

ranking subordinate having a more similar value profile with supervisor than the 

lowest ranked subordinate.

In two separate studies, Meglino,  Ravlin, and Adkins (1989,  1991) found a 

modest  positive  correlation  between  work-value  similarity  of  supervisors  and 

subordinates  and job-satisfaction.  Subordinates who  were  more  similar to  their 

supervisors  in the rank-ordering of work-related  values  along  an  ipsative  scale

also  tended  to  report  greater job  satisfaction.  Subordinates  who  rank-ordered 

their work-related values more similarly to their supervisors also reported greater

organizational commitment.

Perceptual Congruence 

Perceptual Congruence and Performance

Wexiey,  Alexander,  Greenawalt,  and  Couch 

(1980)  created 

two 

perceptual  congruence  measures:  managerial  congruence  and  subordinate 

congruence.  They defined  managerial  congruence  as  the  comparison  between 

the  manager's  description  of  the  subordinate  and  the  subordinate's  self- 

description  regarding  work-related  attitudes.  Subordinate  congruence  was 

defined  as  the  comparison  between  a  subordinate’s  description  of a  manager 

and the manager’s  self description.  They found that managerial  congruence for 

the  concepts  of  loyalty  and  responsibility  was  positively  correlated  with 

performance ratings of the subordinate (r= .23 and  r= .26 respectively).  Wexiey 

and  Pulakos  (1983)  found further that  subordinate  perceptual  congruence  was 

positively related to subordinate evaluations of managerial performance.

As mentioned previously, Turban and Jones' (1988) studied agreement of 

perceptions  of  the  instrumentality  of  various  job-related  behaviors  toward 

achieving  a  merit  pay  raise.  They  found  that  perceptual  congruence  was 

positively yet weakly related to performance ratings by supervisors (r= .16). They 

were also surprised to find that this form of similarity was not found to be related 

to ratings of suggested pay increases

33

Zalesny  and  Kirsch  (1989)  included  a  measure  of  agreement  between 

supervisors  and  subordinates  about 

the 

relative 

importance  of  various 

performance  dimensions.  They  found  that  dyadic  agreement  concerning  the 

importance  of performance  dimensions  was  positively  and  modestly  correlated 

with performance ratings (r= .27).

Perceptual Congruence and Job Satisfaction

Within  the  context  of  the  LMX  model,  Graen  and  Schiemann  (1978) 

investigated  the  level  of  agreement  within  dyads  regarding  the  perceived 

severity  of  job-related  problems  confronting  the  subordinate.  They  did  not 

include job satisfaction as a dependent variable but they did find that supervisor- 

subordinate dyads which  demonstrated  higher agreement also tended  to  report 

higher quality dyadic relationships (in-group vs.  out-group).  Wexiey,  Alexander, 

Greenawalt,  and  Couch  (1980) 

found 

that  subordinate  congruence  was 

positively related to  subordinate general job  satisfaction  and  most strongly with 

satisfaction with supervision (r= .36 and r= .50) respectively.

Perceived Similarity 

Studies  of  perceived  similarity  between  supervisors  and  subordinates 

have  shown  a  more  consistent  pattern  of  relationships  with  the  outcomes  of 

performance  evaluations  and  job  satisfaction.  Supervisors  who  perceive  their 

subordinates  as  being  more  similar also  tend  to  rate  their performance  higher. 

Subordinates  who  perceive 

themselves  as  being  more  similar 

to 

their 

supervisors also tend to report greater job satisfaction.

Perceived Similarity and Performance

Much of the research  into the effects of perceived  similarity has involved 

lab  studies  in  which  participants  have  been  provided  with  bogus  information 

concerning the attitudes of target individuals.  There has been at least one such 

study  employing  this  methodology,  relevant  to  the  focus  of  this  dissertation. 

Krivonos,  Byme,  and Friedrich (1976) led participants to believe that they would 

be  working  on  a  task  with  another  individual  in  separate  rooms  although  in 

reality, they were performing the task alone. Before starting the task,  participants 

received  bogus  information  about the  attitudes  of the  supposed  co-worker that 

was  manipulated  to  be  similar  or  dissimilar  to  the  participants  own  attitudes. 

Those participants who were told that their supposed co-worker was attitudinaily 

similar, performed better on the task than for the dissim ilar attitude condition.

Feren,  Carroll,  and  Olian  (1988)  asked  participants  view  videotapes  of 

actors playing the role of supervisors of varying degrees of scripted competence. 

Before viewing the tapes,  the participants received  bogus  information  about the 

attitudes  of the  manager they were about to watch.  Participants  had  previously 

completed an attitude survey and thus the researchers were able to  manipulate 

attitude similarity by either matching or not matching the  bogus  information with 

what  the  participants  had  indicated.  Feren  et  al.  asked  participants  to  make 

ratings  of  interpersonal  attraction  for  the  observed  managers.  They  found  a 

strong  main  effect  for  supervisory  competence  on  these  ratings  and  a  weak 

effect for attitude similarity. They found no interaction.

35

Field studies o f perceived  similarity have also found a  moderate positive 

relationship  between  perceived  similarity and  performance  ratings.  Turban and 

Jones  (1988), 

for  example, 

found  that  supervisor  perceived  similarity  of 

subordinates  correlated  positively  with  their  performance  ratings  (r=  .37). 

Interestingly,  subordinate  perceived  similarity  to  supervisors  also  significantly 

correlated  to  supervisory  performance  ratings,  albeit  not  as  strongly  (r=  .19). 

Phillips  and  Bedeian  (1994)  also found  a strong  correlation  between  perceived 

attitudinal similarity and supervisory performance ratings (r= .39).

Pulakos  and  Wexiey  (1983)  asked  dyad  members  to  make  a  judgment 

about  their  similarity  to  the  other  member.  Supervisors  who  perceived  their 

subordinates  as  being  more  sim ilar  to  themselves 

tended 

to  give 

their 

subordinates  higher performance  ratings  (ta2=  .15).  Likewise,  subordinates who 

perceived  their  supervisors  to  be  more  similar  to  themselves  also  tended  to 

received  higher performance  ratings,  although  the  effect  size  was  smaller (o2= 

.02).  Participants  were  not  given  any  explicit  basis  from  which  to  make  their 

judgments.  They  reported  anecdotal  evidence  that  participants  considered  a 

variety  of  factors  such  as  attitudes 

toward 

the  organization  and  work, 

approaches to  dealing  with  difficult job-related  problems,  and  beliefs  about the 

proper way of treating other people,  in making their evaluations.

Perceived Similarity and Job Satisfaction

Not  many  studies  have  directly  examined  the  relationship  between 

perceived  similarity  and  job  satisfaction.  For  perceived  supervisor-subordinate

36

similarity as measured with one item, Turban and Jones (1988) found a positive 

relationship  with  job  satisfaction  (r=  .30).  Subordinates'  perceived  similarity  to 

their  supervisors  was  related  to  positive  evaluations  of  the  work  and  reward 

climate,  supervisor  use  of  punishment  and  rewards,  the  relationship  with  the 

supervisor,  and  role  clarity.  Subordinates  whom  the  supervisor  rated  as  being 

more  similar,  reported  confidence  and  trust  in  their  supervisor,  a  good 

relationship with that supervisor, and little role ambiguity. Marion-Landais (1993) 

also  found  a  strong  relationship  between  perceived  similarity  on  work-related 

values and job satisfaction (r= .39) for a sample of managers.

In  a 

laboratory  study,  Meglino,  Ravlin,  and  Adkins  (1991)  asked 

participants to  rate the values of one of two  leaders depicted on videotape  and 

to  indicate  how satisfied they would be working for this  leader.  They found that 

participants  who  rated  the  leaders  as  having  values  similar  to  their  own  also 

indicated that they would be  more satisfied working for the person.  This finding 

held for both leaders (r=.31  and r=.23).

In  the  absence  of  more  studies  explicitly  considering  a  link  between 

perceived  similarity  and  job  satisfaction,  two  other  studies  which  consider 

leader-member  exchange  quality  are  discussed.  Although  exchange  quality  is 

conceptually  distinct  from  job  satisfaction,  there  is  some  overlap  between  the 

variables.  Strong  correlations  in  the  .40  - .50  range  have  been found  between 

these  variables  (Marion-Landais,  1993;  Vecchio  &  Horn,  1986).  Examining  the

37

relationship between perceived similarity and exchange quality may be indicative 

of similar relationships with job satisfaction.

For  example,  Steiner  (1988) 

investigated 

the  relationship  between 

perceived dyadic value similarity and exchange quality from another direction.  In 

a  laboratory  setting,  he  asked  participants  to  read  a  vignette  describing  an 

hypothetical work situation in either high LMX (in-group) or low LMX (out-group) 

terms.  They  were  then  asked  to  complete  a  value  survey  as  they  believed  a 

hypothetical  supervisor described  in the  situation would  have.  These  attributed 

value  responses  were  compared  to  earlier  self-describing  responses  of  the 

participants using the same scale.  Steiner found that participants who  imagined 

themselves  in  the  "in-group"  or  "high-quality"  exchange  situation  attributed 

greater value  similarity to their imagined  superior than  did those who  imagined 

themselves  in  "out-group"  or "low-quaiity" exchange  situations.  In  a field  study, 

Phillips  and  Bedeian  (1994)  approached  the  relationship  between  perceived 

attitudinal  similarity  and  exchange  quality  in  a  traditional  manner  and  found  a 

modest positive relationship between the two (r= .26).

Summary o f Literature Review 

The  general  trend  across the three forms of similarity defined  by Turban 

and  Jones  (1988)  points  to  a  relationship  between  dyadic  sim ilarity  and  the 

individual  outcomes of job  performance  and job  satisfaction.  Nevertheless,  this 

relationship is not evident for all demographic or attitudinal variables,  and when 

found 

is  relatively  small.  Perceptual  congruence  effects  are  found  more

38

consistently  but  they  are  also  relatively  small.  In  contrast,  the  relationship 

between  perceived  similarity and these  outcomes  appears  to  be  the  strongest, 

but there are few published studies to confirm it.

This Study

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between dyadic 

similarity  and  the  work  outcomes  of performance  and job-related  affect  and  to 

compare  various  analytical  methods  available  for  this  exploration.  These 

outcomes  were  operationalized 

in 

this  study  as  supervisory  ratings  of 

subordinate  performance  and  subordinate  self-ratings  of  job  satisfaction.  To 

provide  continuity  with  the  relational  demography  literature,  this  study  also 

considered  dyadic  similarity  along  the  demographic  variables  of  sex  and  age. 

Furthermore,  this  study also  considered  actual  similarity between  subordinates 

and supervisors concerning beliefs about ideal leadership behaviors.

As  discussed  above,  much  research  on  actual  attitudinal  similarity 

between  supervisors  and  subordinates  has  involved  the  study  of work-related 

values  and  beliefs.  Although  work-related,  these  attitudes  have  tended  to  be 

general  concepts within  the  area  of work  such  as  responsibility,  creativity,  and 

freedom  (e.g.,  Basu  &  Green,  1995;  Kemelgor,  1982;  Senger,  1971;  Wexiey, 

Alexander,  Greenawalt,  &  Couch,  1980).  Beliefs  about 

ideal 

leadership 

behaviors  were  included  in  this  study  because  they  are  attitudes  specifically 

related  to  the  dyadic  situation.  Leadership  behaviors  should  be  relevant  and 

salient  aspects  of the  supervisor-subordinate  dyad.  The  leadership  behaviors

used  in  this  study  were  taken  from  the  dimensions  of  Initiating  Structure, 

Consideration,  and  Tolerance  of  Freedom  taken  from  the  Leader  Behavior 

Description  Questionnaire  (Stogdill,  1963)  because  of  their  rich  tradition  in 

organizational research (Yukl & Van Fleet,  1992).

Four methods were employed to test for the relationships hypothesized in 

the study.  For categorical  independent variables,  the relationship was tested  by 

the  use  of  an  analysis  of variance  approach.  The factors  were the  supervisor 

and subordinate values of the categorical variable of interest (e.g. sex).

With  continuous  independent  variables,  one  of the  methods  employed 

was  the  use  of traditional  unitary discrepancy  scores  as  discussed  previously. 

Two  indices were used as examples of this method: algebraic-difference  scores 

and  squared-difference  scores.  The  existence  of a  relationship  was  tested  by 

correlating  these  scores with  the  dependent  outcomes.  Furthermore,  when  the 

supervisor  and  subordinate  comparisons  were  along  scale  scores,  the  square 

root of the sum of squared-differences  in  item  responses was  used as a further 

index of profile similarity.

The next two methods used for continuous independent variables are less 

traditional  hierarchical  regression  analysis techniques.  The first of these  is  the 

hierarchical  regression  test  of  the  supervisor-subordinate  crossproduct  term. 

This analysis allows for a relatively simple test for dyadic similarity effects while 

avoiding  the  problems  associated  with  difference  scores  as  discussed  above. 

The  second  of  these  methods  is  the  response-surface  modeling  approach.

Similar to the crossproduct test, the regression modeling approach allows for an 

explicit exploration  of the  form  of a n / relationships found  defining  plots  of the 

relationship between supervisor and subordinate variables with the outcomes as 

a three-dimensional response-surface. This method was used to test the models 

implied by the algebraic-difference score and the squared-difference score. This 

method was also used to develop models  estimating  any relationships found  in 

the data.

This study further extends previous work in the area of dyadic similarity by 

applying  the  regression  analysis  techniques  to  test  for  moderator  effects. 

Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  (OBSE)  of  subordinates  was  examined  as  a 

potential  moderator  of  the  relationship  between  dyadic  similarity  and  work 

outcomes. As discussed previously,  Self-Esteem has been proposed  by several 

authors as a potential moderator of similarity-work outcome relationships,  it is a 

relatively stable evaluation that individuals make of themselves concerning their 

worthiness  and  capabilities  (Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  &  Dunham,  1989). 

Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  is  a  more  narrowly  conceived  version  of this 

construct  which  applies  to  the  self-evaluations  of worthiness  and  capabilities 

which arises from the work environment (Pierce et al.,  1989).

Employees with  low OBSE are hypothesized to be  more  reactive to their 

environment for at least two theoretical  reasons.  One reason  is  that employees 

with  low  OBSE  may  be  more  likely  to  imitate  the  behaviors  and  attitudes  of 

others  because  of their own  uncertainty  or  lack  of self-confidence  about  their

own  reactions and feelings and may thus be more responsive to external social 

cues (Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  Dunham,  1989; Weiss,  1978).  It is likely also 

that  supervisors  are  likely  to  be  salient  sources  of  relevant  cues  regarding 

appropriate organizational  and  performance-related  behaviors  (Tsui  & O'Reilly, 

1989).  Employees  with  high  OBSE  are  more  likely  to  be  confident  about  their 

responses  to  work  situations  and  thus  less  likely  to  be  influenced  by  others. 

Alternately,  because  of a  low-level  of self-acceptance  or  approval,  employees 

with  low  OBSE  may  seek  to  gain  the  approval  and  acceptance  of  important 

others  by  modeling  their  behavior and  attitudes  after  important  others  (Pierce, 

Gardner, Cummings,  Dunham,  1989). Again, supervisors are likely to be seen as 

an important other in many work-related situations.

One further extension of this study to the extant dyadic sim ilarity research 

literature  was  the  consideration  of  an  international  sample.  Specifically,  the 

participants  in  this  study were  employees  of local  affiliates  in  various  Spanish­

speaking  Latin American countries of a major U.S.  multinational  corporation.  As 

noted  above,  this  population  has  been  generally  missing  from  the  published 

research literature.

Hypotheses

Consistent with the literature reviewed above,  it is hypothesized that there 

is  a  relationship  between  actual  demographic and  attitudinal  similarity  and  the 

job  outcomes  of  subordinate  job  satisfaction  and  supervisory  performance

ratings.  Where  applicable,  these  relationships  w ill  be  tested  by  difference 

scores, profile similarity indices, and regression analysis.

Hypothesis 1

A)  Job satisfaction will  be  higher for subordinates with  supervisors  of the  same
sex.

B)  Performance  ratings  will  be  higher for subordinates  with  supervisors  of the
same sex.

Hypothesis 2

A)  Job  satisfaction  will  be  higher  for  subordinates  closer  in  age  to  their 
supervisors.

B)  Performance  ratings  will  be  higher  for  subordinates  closer  in  age  to  their 
supervisors.

Hypothesis 3

A)  Job  satisfaction  will  be  higher  for  subordinates  who  are  similar  to  their 
supervisors in the time lived outside their country.

B)  Performance  ratings  will  be  higher for subordinates  who  are  sim ilar to  their 
supervisors in the time lived outside their country.

Hypothesis 4

A)  Job satisfaction will  be higher for subordinates who  are  in  closer agreement 
with their supervisors on ideal leadership behaviors.

B)  Performance  ratings  will  be  higher  for  subordinates  who  are  in  closer 
agreement with their supervisors on ideal leadership behaviors.

METHOD

Subjects

Survey  participants  were  employees  of  local  affiliate  organizations  of a 

major Fortune  100 Oil & Gas corporation in Spanish speaking countries  in  Latin 

America.  These  affiliate  companies  are  located  in  Nicaragua,  Guatemala,  El 

Salvador,  Panama, Dominican Republic,  Puerto Rico, and Mexico.

Response rates are presented  in Table  1.  For supervisors,  the  response 

rate ranged from 20% to 100%.  For subordinates, the response rate ranged from 

27% to 82%.  Only one supervisor in Mexico  returned a  survey form.  During the 

collection,  Puerto Rico and the Dominican  Republic were hit by a hurricane and 

this may have depressed return rates and made final follow-up impractical.

Respondent Demographics

Continuous Variables

Means  for  demographic  information  collected  from  all  respondents  as 

continuous variables are  contained  in Tables 2 through  4.  These  variables  are 

reported  age  in  years  (see  Table  2),  reported  tenure  in  the  organization  in 

months  (see  Table  3),  and  reported  tenure  with  current  supervisor  in  months 

(see Table 4).

Age.  A  one-way analysis  of variance o f the  subordinate  age  by  location 

found a significant main effect for location,  F (6,111)= 3.2093,  MS,™ = 84.05,  p. 

= 0.0061.  A post-hoc Bonferroni  (SPSS for Windows,  1996)  comparison  of age 

by location  indicated a significant difference at the  .05  level  between the means 

for subordinates in  Panama and subordinates in El  Salvador and Puerto Rico. A 

one-way  analysis  of  variance  of  supervisor  age  by  location  failed  to  find  a 

significant main effect for location, F(6,23) = .4142,  MS«,ror= 90.24, p. = .8619.

Organization 

tenure.  A 

two-way  analysis  of  variance  of  reported 

organization  tenure  by  location  and  level  found  no  significant  main  effect  for 

location,  F(6,133)=  2.054.  MSam*  =  74.710,  p.=  .063  although  supervisors

reported significantly longer organizational tenure than subordinates,  F(1,133) = 

10.597, MSerror = 74.710,  p.= .001.

Tenure  with  Supervisors.  A  two-way  analysis  of  variance  failed  to  find 

significant  differences  in  reported  tenure  with  supervisor  either  by  location, 

F(6,131)= 

1.581,  MSamr  =  2.549,  p.=  .157,  or  between  supervisors  and

subordinates, F(1,131)= .278, MSWr0r= 2.549, p.= .599.

Time  Lived Away.  Respondents  were  categorized  by  their  responses  to 

the  amount  of  time  they  had  lived  away  from  their  home  country.  Of  all 

subordinate  respondents,  26%  indicated  having  lived  away  from  their  home 

country for over a year although  9% did  not respond  to the  item.  Of supervisor 

respondents,  60%  reported  having  lived  over  a  year  away  from  their  home 

country (see Table 6).

Nationality.  The  great  majority  of  respondent  worked  in  their  home 

country.  Of  subordinates,  only  3%  were  expatriates.  The  percentage  of 

expatriates for supervisor respondents was 13% (see Table 7).

Procedure

Supervisors with two or more subordinates were identified with the aid  of 

organization charts prepared by the Human Resources Department of each local 

company.  The  standard  format  of the  organization  charts  contained  only  the 

incumbent's  last  name,  initials,  and  organizational  title.  No  other  demographic 

information was available from the organization charts.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  respondents  were  considered  either 

supervisors or subordinates.  Participants who were designated as  subordinates 

in the study may have had supervisory responsibilities in their organization.

Matching  responses  of supervisors with  their subordinates was  a  critical 

requirement of the  study.  In  addition,  local  management  had  expressed  strong 

concerns 

regarding 

the  sensitivity  of 

the 

information 

requested 

from 

respondents, especially with regard to performance evaluations and had insisted 

upon anonymity for survey respondents rather than confidentiality. To meet both 

requirements, a one-way, supervisor-specific coding procedure was developed.

In  each  company,  the  local  Human  Resources  manager coordinated  the 

survey  distribution  and  collection  process  with 

the  researcher  and 

the 

respondents.  For  each  supervisor  and  his  or  her  associated  work  group,  as 

identified  on the organization chart,  a  packet of surveys was  prepared,  with the

supervisor’s name affixed to the packet envelope. All packets for each company 

were  sent  to  the  local  HR  manager  who  then  distributed  the  packets  to  the 

appropriate supervisors.

Each  supervisor's  packet  contained  subordinate  questionnaires,  answer 

sheets,  informed consent forms, and sealable return envelopes for distribution to 

his  or  her  subordinates.  On  each  subordinate  answer  sheet,  the  researcher 

affixed  a  pre-printed  label  with  the  subordinate’s  name.  The  stickers  were 

removable.

Note.
3 Expat- Expatriates are from countries other than their location. 
b Puerto Rican nationals are also considered US Nationals.

Also  included  in  each  supervisor's  package  was  a  supervisor  coding 

sheet  and  a  sheet  of  stickers,  numbered  from  1  to  10.  On  each  supervisor 

coding  sheet,  the  supervisor’s  subordinates  were  listed  in  alphabetical  order. 

Supervisors  were  asked  to  affix  a  numbered  sticker  next  to  each  subordinate 

name  on  the  coding  sheet.  This was  to  be  done  in  random  order.  Supervisors 

were instructed not to return their sheets and to destroy them once their answer 

sheets were properly coded and distributed.

Each  supervisor was  asked to  create  his  or her own  original  supervisor 

code in the form of three  letters and three numbers.  Supervisors were asked to

52

write this code and the appropriate subordinate number (from the stickers on the 

coding sheet) on each subordinate’s answer sheet.

From  their  supervisors,  each  subordinate  thus  received  a  questionnaire 

and an answer sheet identified by a unique supervisor code,  a random number, 

and by his or her own name on a removable sticker.  Subordinates were asked to 

remove  their name  label from their answer sheets  before  returning  them  in the 

envelopes  provided.  The  sealed  envelopes  were  returned  to  the  Human 

Resources Manager who sent them to the researcher via company mail.

In  their  packages,  supervisors  also  received  a  survey  form,  informed 

consent  form,  answer  sheet,  and  return  envelope  for  themselves.  They  were 

asked  to  write  the  unique  code  they  created  on  the  answer  sheet,  in  a  space 

provided. W ithin their survey form, supervisors were asked to make performance 

ratings  on  their  subordinates.  To  maintain  the  anonymity  of the  subordinates, 

supervisory performance ratings were identified with the  numbers that had been 

randomly assigned to each subordinate.

Thus,  once the supervisor and subordinate answer sheets were  returned 

to the  researcher,  it was  impossible to  identify the  respondent.  However,  it was 

still  possible to  match  supervisors (and their ratings) with  subordinates with the 

use  of  the  supervisor-generated  codes  and  the  supervisor  assigned  random

numbers.

Instrumentation

The  survey  questionnaire  forms  for supervisors  and  subordinates  were 

identical  except  the  performance  evaluation  section  and  some  minor  wording 

differences. The survey form was laid out in five sections which corresponded to: 

demographic  information,  a  job-satisfaction  measure,  a  self-esteem  measure, 

three LBDQ subscales, and performance ratings.

Demographic Information

The  first  section  of  the  survey  consisted  of  six  demographic  items. 

Respondents  were  asked  to  provide  information  on  their  sex,  their  age  (in 

years),  organizational  tenure  (in  months),  and  the  length  of  their  tenure  with 

current  supervisor  (in  months).  Respondents  were  also  asked  to  about  their 

nationality and  whether they  had  lived  abroad.  This  last  item was  offered  as  a 

multiple choice between:  less than a year,  more than a year but less than 5,  and 

five years or more.

Job Satisfaction

A  3-item  Job  Satisfaction  scale  developed  by  Cammann,  Fichman, 

Jenkins,  &  Klesh  (1979)  was  used.  In  two  samples  of  university  employees, 

Spector & Jex (1996) found this scale to have an internal consistency of .88 and 

.79.  For a sample of recent university alumni,  Spector & O'Connell  (1994) found 

an  alpha of .91.  Respondents were asked to  rate the extent that they agreed  or 

disagreed with each item on a 6-point Likert response scale.

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


54

Organization-Based Self-Esteem 

The  Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  scale  is  a  10-item  scale  that taps 

into employees feelings of self-esteem as anchored  in the context of their work 

environment.  The  developers  of  the  scale  (Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  & 

Dunham,  1989) report an average alpha reliability of .91  for the scale over seven 

studies  validation  studies.  It was  shown  to  have  an  alpha  reliability of .91  in  a 

later,  separate  study 

(Pierce,  Gardner,  Dunham,  &  Cummings,  1993). 

Respondents were asked  to  rate the  extent that they agreed  or disagreed with 

each item on a 6-point Likert response scale.

Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire Subscales 

Three scales from the  Leader Behavior Description  Questionnaire- Form 

XII  (Stogdill,  1963)  were  adapted  for  use  in  this  study  as  statements  of  ideal 

leadership behaviors.  Each of the scales,  Initiating Structure,  Consideration, and 

Tolerance  of  Freedom,  is  composed  of  10  items.  Respondents  were  asked  to 

rate  the  extent of their  agreement with  each  item  on  a  6-point  Likert  response 

scale as a description of their “ideal” supervisor.

Initiating  Structure  taps  into  the  leader's  task-oriented  behavior  which 

includes  attempts  to  organize  and  define  the  activities  of  group  members. 

Consideration  taps  into  the  leader's  people-oriented  behavior  which  includes 

concern  and  respect  for  group  members.  Tolerance  of  Freedom  taps  into  the 

leader's  behavior  in  allowing  group  members  latitude  and  autonomy  in  doing 

their jobs.

Performance Ratings 

Supervisors  were  asked  to  provide  performance  evaluation  ratings  on 

each  of  their  subordinates  relative  to  others  on  the  dimensions  of  Work, 

Personal,  and  Global  characteristics.  Subordinates  were  asked  to  make  these 

same  ratings  but  only  for  themselves.  Work  was  defined  as  a  measure  of 

quantity and quality of work relative to others.  Personal was defined as personal 

characteristics such as attitude, cooperativeness, and ability to work with others. 

Global was  defined as  an  overall  rating  “considering  everything.”  Respondents 

were  asked  to  make  ratings  on  a  5-point  scale  corresponding  to  the  following 

choices:  "Much  Worse  than  Most",  'W orse  than  Most",  "About  the  Same  as 

Most", "Better than Most", and "Much Better than Most"

Supervisors were asked to assign their ratings to each subordinate using 

the  identifying  numbers  they  had  assigned  on  their  coding  sheet.  On  the 

subordinate  questionnaires,  subordinates  were  asked  to  make  these  same 

ratings but only for themselves.

Scale Translation

Both  the  supervisor  and  subordinate  questionnaires  and  accompanying 

materials  were  presented  in  a  bilingual  format.  All  text was  presented  in  both 

Spanish and English on the same page.  Instructions were separated in separate 

blocks  with  Spanish  on  the  left  and  English  on  the  right.  Each  item  was 

presented in Spanish with the English version underneath  it in a slightly smaller 

font.

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


56

All  scales  and  instructions  were  translated  into  Spanish  and  translated 

independently back into English by three bilingual translators.  These translators 

were selected from  Dominican  Republic,  El  Salvador,  and  Colombia  in  order to 

avoid colloquialisms or idiomatic expressions that may be specific to a particular 

Spanish  speaking  country.  Resulting  differences  in  wording  were  resolved  in 

consultation with the translators until an agreed upon version was produced.

The use of bilingual  translators has been  criticized  because of bilinguals 

may potentially interpret English  items differently than monolinguals  (Hambleton 

&  Bollwark,  1991).  The company  in  which  this  study was  conducted,  however, 

had  an  active  and  long-standing  policy  of  hiring  English/Spanish  bilingual 

employees.  Furthermore,  these  bilingual  employees  would  be  presented  with 

items in both languages and would be less likely to misinterpret the items.

distribution  was  severely  negatively  skewed.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  the  great 

majority  of the  responses  to  the  three  items  was  at  the  top  of the  scale  (see 

Figure  3).  Attenuation  of  correlations  is  to  be  expected  in  the  face  of  severe 

range restriction.

For  each  of  these  scales,  a  level  x  location  analysis  of  variance  was 

conducted  and  the  results  of  these  analyses  are  contained  in  Table  16  (see 

Table  16).  For  Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  (OBSE),  a  significant  main 

effect  was  found  for  location  F(6,121)  =  2.642,  MS,™  =  .556,  p.=.019.  A 

subsequent  post-hoc  Bonferroni  multiple  comparison 

test  (SPSS,  1996) 

indicated  that  there  was  a  significant  difference  at  the  .05  level  between  the 

mean OBSE score for Puerto Rico and the means for Dominican Republic and El 

Salvador.

A  significant  main  effect  for  location  was  also  found  for  the  LBDQ 

subscale  of  Consideration,  F(6,133)=  2.171,  MS,™  = 

.464,  p.=.050.  A 

subsequent post-hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison  test of the means  (SPSS, 

1996) failed to find significant differences between groups  by location at the .05

level.

Scale Inter-Correlations 

The inter-correlation matrix for the scales for all  respondents is contained 

in  Table  17.  All  scales  are  significantly  correlated  except  for  Job  Satisfaction 

which is not significantly correlated with the LBDQ subscale of Consideration nor 

with  the  LBDQ  subscale  of  Initiating  Structure.  The  LBDQ  subscales  show  a 

pattern of intercorrelations with each other, in the order of .70s (see Table 17).

Subordinate-Supervisor Matching 

All  previous  analyses  of respondent  demographics  and  scale  properties 

have  been  based  on  the  sample  of all  respondents  considered  independently.

However, for the purposes of the following analyses which correspond to the test 

of  the  study  hypotheses,  respondents  have  been  matched  as  supervisor- 

subordinate  dyads.  Descriptive  statistics  of  the  resulting  dyads  are  found  in 

Table  18  (see  Table  18).  Of the  118  subordinate  surveys  returned,  116  were 

matched  with  supervisor  responses.  Of  the  30  supervisor  surveys,  all  were 

matched with at  least one  subordinate.  Only a  single supervisor in  Mexico was 

matched with subordinates.

Supervisor scores on the  LBDQ  subscale of Tolerance  of Freedom  were 

found to  be significantly correlated with  subordinate age,  organizational  tenure, 

and tenure with  supervisor.  Supervisor Tolerance of Freedom  scores were also 

found  to  be  negatively  correlated  with  subordinate  Organization  Based  Self- 

Esteem (OBSE).

Supervisory scores on the LBDQ subscale of Consideration were found to 

be negatively correlated with subordinate OBSE. Finally, supervisory self-ratings 

of performance were found  to  be  negatively correlated with  subordinate tenure 

with supervisor.

Hypothesis 1 A- Job Satisfaction and Dyad Sex

A 2 x 2 ANOVA was conducted on Job  Satisfaction with  subordinate and 

supervisor  sex  as  independent  variables.  A  summary  of  this  analysis 

is 

presented  in  Table 20.  No  significant  effect  on  Job  Satisfaction  was  found  for 

either subordinate sex or for supervisor sex (see Table 20).

The cell  means for subordinate job  satisfaction for the  various  dyad  sex 

combinations are presented in Table 21. Although not statistically significant, the 

mean job satisfaction for male subordinates with female supervisors is the lowest 

of the four cells (see Table 21).

A plot was created to explore the distribution of the job satisfaction scores 

as  a  function  of  dyad  sex  composition.  Instead  of actual  values,  the  box  plot 

displays the median,  the 25th and 75th percentile,  and outliers and  is designed to 

allow for easier comparison of distributions between groups. The box plot for the 

four combinations of supervisor-subordinate sex is presented in Figure 4.

For each group, the lower edge of each box represents the 25th percentile 

and the upper edge represents the 75th percentile.  Each box,  therefore,  contains 

50%  of the  cases for that group.  The  horizontal  line  inside  the  box  represents

Outliers  are defined  as  values which  are  1.5  box  lengths  away from  the 

top or bottom edge of the box and are designated with a circle. The smallest and 

largest  values  in  the  distributions,  which  are  within  1.5  box  lengths  from  the 

respective edge, are marked with horizontal bars and lines which are drawn from 

these values to the corresponding edges.

Inspection  of  Figure  4  reveals  that  the  distributions  of  Job  Satisfaction 

scores  are  similar  except  for  the  case  of  male  subordinates  with  female 

supervisors.  There  is  less variability in the distribution  of job satisfaction  scores 

for this group and the median score is lower than for the other combinations.

In  summary,  the analysis  of variance failed to find an effect for dyad  sex 

composition.  Although  the  effect is  not statistically significant,  inspection  of the 

response  patterns,  however,  appears  to  indicate  that  there  may  be  some 

difference  in  the  way  male  subordinates  of  female  supervisors  rate  their  job 

satisfaction compared to all other subordinates.

Hypothesis 1B- Performance Ratings and Dyad Sex 

A 2 x 2 ANOVA was  conducted on  performance ratings with  subordinate

presented  in Table 22. A significant main effect was found for supervisor sex. A 

significant  interaction  effect  of  supervisor  sex  by  subordinate  sex  was  also 

found.

Cell  means  for  performance  ratings  by  supervisor  and  subordinate  sex 

are  presented  in  Table  23.  Mean  performance  rating  by female  supervisors  is 

lower than the mean performance rating by male supervisors.

Inspection of Table 23  reveals that the mean  performance rating of male 

subordinates  by  female  supervisors  seems  to  be  lower  than  for  all  other  cell 

means. To test the significance o f this difference, the dyad sex composition was 

coded  into one variable with four values  reflecting the possible combinations.  A

one-way  analysis  of variance  was  performed  on  performance  ratings  with  this 

coding  variable  as  independent  variable  and  a  subsequent  post-hoc  modified 

LSD  multiple  comparison  test  (SPSS  for  Windows,  1996)  of  the  means  was 

performed.  This  multiple  comparison  test  indicated  that the  mean  performance 

ratings for both male and female subordinates with male supervisors were higher 

than 

the  mean  performance 

rating 

for  male  subordinates  with 

female 

supervisors. No significant difference was found between the mean performance 

rating  for  female  subordinates  with  male  supervisors  and  the  three  other 

supervisor-subordinate sex combinations.

In  order  to  explore  the  distribution  of  the  performance  ratings  as  a

female  supervisors  of  their  male  and  female  subordinates.  The  range  of 

performance ratings of male  subordinates of female supervisors  is greater than 

the range of performance ratings of female subordinates of female  supervisors. 

Furthermore,  all  the  performance  ratings  of  female  subordinates  by  female 

supervisors  are  above  the  median  of  the  performance  ratings  of  male 

subordinates by female supervisors.

In  summary,  the hypothesis that performance  ratings for subordinates  in 

same-sex  dyads  would  be  higher than  different  sex  dyads  was  supported,  but 

only 

for 

females  supervisors. 

In  addition,  performance 

ratings  of  male 

subordinates  of  female  supervisors  were  found  the  lowest  of  all  dyad  sex 

combinations.

Hypothesis 2A- Job Satisfaction and Age Similarity 

The  hypothesized  relationship  between  subordinate-supervisor  age 

similarity and Job Satisfaction was tested with two approaches. The first was the 

correlation  of both  algebraic age  difference  scores  and  squared  age  difference 

scores  with  Job  Satisfaction.  The  second  approach  was  the  application  of two 

multiple regression techniques. The first of these was the crossproduct test. The 

other  was  the  use  of  the  regression  modeling  approach  which  tested  the 

underlying models implied by the difference scores and also tested for any linear 

or quadratic form of an existing relationship.

Difference Score Analysis (Age and Job Satisfaction)

A  difference  score  reflecting  the  degree  of  similarity  in  ages  between 

each  supervisor  and  subordinate  dyad  was  calculated  by  subtracting 

subordinate ages from supervisor ages.  The squared-difference score was also 

calculated  by  squaring  the  algebraic-difference  in  ages.  Neither the  difference 

score, 

r(115)=  .01,  p.=.954,  nor  the  squared-difference  score,  r(115)=  .09, 

p.= 320, was found to be significantly correlated with Job Satisfaction.

Hierarchical Crossproduct Analysis (Age and Job Satisfaction)

A hierarchical  regression model was built in order to test the  incremental 

variance accounted for by the crossproduct term  of supervisor and subordinate 

age in the prediction of Job Satisfaction. As discussed previously, this is a test of 

the interaction between supervisors and subordinate ages.

Since  age was found  to  vary significantly  across  locations,  location  was 

the first variable to be entered  in the regression  equation  as a  control  variable. 

Next,  subordinate  (X)  and  supervisor (Y)  ages were  entered jointly as  a  block. 

Lastly,  the  crossproduct  term  of  supervisor  age  x  subordinate  age  (XY)  was 

entered.  A  summary  of this  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  24.  None  of  three 

blocks entered were significant and none of the blocks entered were associated 

with a significant increment in  R2.  None of the individual terms within the blocks 

had significant regression weights. The hierarchical crossproduct analysis failed 

to find support for an interaction effect between supervisor and subordinate ages 

on Job Satisfaction.

Regression Modeling (Age and Job Satisfaction)

One  purpose  of  the  hierarchical  regression  modeling  approach  is  to 

compare  the  form  of  the  relationship  between  supervisor-subordinate  age 

similarity with the forms  implied  by algebraic-difference  and  squared-difference 

scores.  Furthermore,  if the models implied by these congruence  indices are not 

supported,  the technique allows for the  development of models  which  estimate 

the existing relationship.

The  models  implied  by  the  algebraic-difference  score  and  the  squared* 

difference  score  were  compared  to  their  unconstrained  versions.  This  was 

accomplished  by  calculating  two  regression  equations  for  each  model.  One 

equation  consisted of job satisfaction  scores  regressed  onto the age difference 

score  in  question.  This  was  the  constrained  equation.  The  other  equation 

consisted of job satisfaction scores regressed onto the individual supervisor and 

subordinate  component 

terms  of 

the  difference  score.  This  was 

the 

unconstrained  equation.  The  difference  in  R2  between  the  unconstrained  and 

constrained  regression  equations  was  then  tested  (Cohen  &  Cohen,  1983, 

Edwards,  1995).  If the R2 for the unconstrained equation was greater than the R2 

for  the  constrained  equation,  the  model  implied  by  the  difference  score  not 

supported.

The  constrained  equation  reflecting  the  model  implied  by the  algebraic- 

difference score was built by regressing job satisfaction  scores onto a difference 

score  calculated  by  subtracting  supervisors  age  from  subordinate  age.  The 

unconstrained  equation  consisted  of  job  satisfaction  scores  regressed  onto 

subordinate  age  (X)  and  supervisor  age  (Y).  The  difference  in  R2  for  both  of 

these equations was tested for significance.

A  summary  of  this  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  25.  Neither  the 

constrained difference score model nor the unconstrained model was significant. 

This  analysis  failed  to  support  the  existence  of  a  linear  relationship  between 

supervisor and subordinate ages with job satisfaction.

The  squared-difference  model  was  tested  in  a  similar  fashion.  The 

constrained  model  was  built  by  regressing job  satisfaction  onto  a  single  term 

calculated by squaring the difference between subordinate and supervisor ages 

[(X-Y)2].  The unconstrained equation was built by regressing job satisfaction on 

the  individual  subordinate  (X)  and  supervisor (Y)  ages,  their squared terms  (X2 

and  Y2)  and  the  crossproduct  (XY).  These  terms  were  derived  from  the 

expansion  of  the  squared-difference  term.  The  difference  in  R2  between  the 

unconstrained and  constrained  regression equations was then tested  (Cohen & 

Cohen,  1983,  Edwards,  1995).  If  the  R2  for  the  unconstrained  equation  was 

greater  than  the  R2  for  the  constrained  equation,  the  model  implied  by  the 

difference score not supported.

A summary of this  analysis  is  presented  in Table 26.  The  results  of this 

analysis were similar to the results of the test o f the algebraic-difference model. 

Neither 

the

failed  to  support  the  existence  of a  quadratic  relationship  between  supervisor 

and  subordinate  ages with job  satisfaction.  The  regression  modeling  approach 

failed  to  indicate  that  there  was  any  relationship  between  supervisor  and 

subordinate scores and job satisfaction which could be model by either linear or 

quadratic models.  There was,  therefore,  no relationship found for which to build 

an estimated model.

In  summary,  none  of the  methods  used  to  test the  hypothesis  indicated 

that there was a relationship  between subordinate and supervisor ages and job

satisfaction.

Hypothesis 2B- Performance Ratings and Age Similarity 

The  hypothesized 

relationship  between  subordinate-supervisor  age 

similarity  and  Performance  Ratings  was  tested  with  two  approaches.  The  first 

was  the  correlation  of  both  algebraic age  difference  scores  and  squared  age 

difference  scores  with  performance  ratings.  The  second  approach  was  the 

application  of  two  multiple  regression  techniques.  The  first  of  these  was  the 

crossproduct test.  The other was the use  of the  regression  modeling  approach 

which  tested  the  underlying  models  implied  by  the  difference  scores  and  also 

tested for any linear or quadratic form of an existing relationship.

Difference Score Analysis (Age and Job Satisfaction)

The age difference score was also not found to be significantly correlated 

with  performance  ratings,  r(109)=  .05,  p.=.593,  and  neither  was  the  squared- 

difference score, r(109) =.03, p.=.779.

Hierarchical Crossproduct Analysis (Age and Performance)

A hierarchical regression model was built to test the incremental variance 

accounted for by entering the  crossproduct term  of supervisor and  subordinate 

ages  in  predicting  performance  ratings.  Since  Age  was  found  to  vary  across 

locations,  location was entered first into the equation as a control variable.  Next, 

subordinate (X) and supervisor (Y) ages were entered jointly as a  block.  Lastly,

the crossproduct term of supervisor age x subordinate age (XY) was entered. A 

summary of this analysis is presented in Table 27.  None of three blocks entered 

were  significant  and  none  were  associated  with  a  significant  increment  in  R2. 

None of the individual terms within the blocks had significant regression weights.

The  hierarchical  crossproduct  analysis  failed  to  find  support  for  an 

interaction  effect  between  supervisor  and  subordinate  ages  on  Performance

Regression Modeling (Age and Performance).

The  models  implied  by  the  algebraic-difference  score  and  the  squared- 

difference  score  were  compared  to  their  unconstrained  versions.  This  was 

accomplished  by  calculating  two  regression  equations  for  each  model.  One 

equation consisted performance ratings regressed onto the age difference score 

in question.. This was the constrained equation. The other equation consisted of 

job satisfaction scores regressed onto the individual supervisor and subordinate 

component terms o f the difference  score.  This was the unconstrained equation. 

The  difference  in  R2  between  the  unconstrained  and  constrained  regression 

equations was then tested (Cohen & Cohen,  1983,  Edwards,  1995).  If the R2 for 

the  unconstrained  equation  was  greater  than  the  R2  for  the  constrained 

equation, the model implied by the difference score not supported.

The  constrained  equation  reflecting  the  model  implied  by  the  algebraic- 

difference  score was  built  by  regressing  performance  ratings  onto  a  difference 

score  calculated  by  subtracting  supervisors  age  from  subordinate  age.  The 

unconstrained  equation  consisted  of  performance  ratings  regressed  onto 

subordinate  age  (X)  and  supervisor  age  (Y).  The  difference  in  R2  for  both  of 

these equations was tested for significance.

A  summary  of  this  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  28.  Neither  the 

constrained  difference  score  equation  nor  the  unconstrained  equation  was 

significant.  This  analysis failed  to support the existence  of a  linear relationship 

between supervisor and subordinate ages with performance ratings.

86

The  squared-difference  model  was  tested  in  a  sim ilar  fashion.  The 

constrained  model  was  built regressing performance  ratings  onto  a  single term 

calculated by squaring the difference between subordinate and supervisor ages [ 

(X-Y)2  ].  The  unconstrained  equation  was  built  by  regressing  performance 

ratings  onto  the  individual  subordinate  (X)  and  supervisor  (Y)  ages,  their 

squared terms  (X2 and Y2)  and the crossproduct (XY).  These terms are  derived 

from the expansion of the squared-difference term. The difference in R2 between 

the  unconstrained  and  constrained  regression  equations  was  then  tested 

(Cohen & Cohen,  1983,  Edwards,  1995).  If the R2 for the unconstrained equation 

was  greater  than  the  R2  for  the  constrained  equation,  model  implied  by  the 

difference score not supported.

A summary of this  analysis  is  presented  in  Table 29.  The  results  of this 

analysis was  sim ilar to the test of the algebraic-difference  score model.  Neither 

the  constrained  squared-difference  score  equation  nor  the  unconstrained 

quadratic  equation  was  found  to  be  significant.  This  analysis  failed  to  support 

the  existence  of  a  quadratic  relationship  between  supervisor  and  subordinate 

ages with performance ratings.

which could be model by either linear or quadratic models. There was, therefore, 

no relationship found for which to build an estimated model.

Hypothesis 4A- Job Satisfaction and Similarity on LBDQ

The  hypothesized  relationship  between  subordinate-supervisor  similarity

on  LBDQ  subscale  scores  and  Job  Satisfaction  was 

tested  with 

three

approaches.  The first approach was the correlation of both  algebraic-difference

scores and squared-difference scores with job satisfaction scores.  Secondly,  two

profile similarity measures were also correlated with job satisfaction.  Lastly,  two

multiple  regression  techniques  were  applied.  The  first  of  these  was  the

crossproduct test. The second was the use o f the regression modeling approach

which  tested  the  underlying  models  implied  by  the  difference  scores  and  also

tested for any linear or quadratic form of an existing relationship.

Difference Score Analysis (LBDQ Subscales and Job Satisfaction) 

Algebraic-difference  scores  were  computed  for  each  LBDQ  subscale 

subtracting  the  subordinate  scores  from  the  supervisor  scores.  A  squared- 

difference 

index  was  also  calculated  for  each  subscale  by  squaring  the 

differences  between  supervisors  and  subordinates.  The  correlation  coefficients 

of these difference scores with job satisfaction  are presented  in  Table  34.  Only 

the algebraic-difference score for the Tolerance of Freedom subscale was found 

to be significantly and negatively correlated with job satisfaction  (see Table 34). 

This  indicates  that  smaller  differences  between  supervisor  and  subordinate 

Tolerance of Freedom scores is associated with higher job satisfaction scores.

As  discussed  above,  the  relationship  found  between  the  supervisor- 

subordinate  difference  score  for the  Tolerance  of  Freedom  subscale  and  Job 

Satisfaction  could  in fact be  attributable to  the  effects  of one  of its  component

terms.  In this case,  parsimony can be tested by conducting a  partial  correlation 

of Tolerance of Freedom  difference score with job satisfaction,  while controlling 

for the effect of the individual supervisor and subordinate component terms.

Nevertheless,  a  first-order  partial  correlation  between  the  Tolerance  of 

Freedom  subscale  difference  score  (X-Y)  and  job  satisfaction,  controlling  for 

Subordinate Tolerance of Freedom scores (X),  reduces the relationship to non- 

significance,  n(108)= -.02, p.  = .800. This indicates that the difference score did 

not  account for significant variance  in job  satisfaction  scores  beyond  what was 

attributable to the subordinate Tolerance of Freedom scores.

Profile Correlation (Q) Analysis (LBDQ and Job Satisfaction)

A profile correlation score (Q) was computed for the three LBDQ subscales as 

a  whole  by  correlating  subordinate  responses  with  supervisor  responses  to  each 

item. The Q score was computed for the three LBDQ subscales as a whole, for a total 

of  30  items,  because  the  sensitivity  of correlations  to  the  number  of  component 

pairs.  The  resulting  Q  scores  were  subsequently  submitted  to  a  Rsher  r  to  z 

transformation  (Cohen  &  Cohen,  1983). The  correlation  of this  Zq  score  with  job 

satisfaction was not significant, r(109) = .07, p. = .485.

Hierarchical Crossproduct Analysis (LBDQ Subscales and Job Satisfaction)

For each of the LBDQ subscales, a hierarchical regression model was built to 

test  the  incremental  variance  explained  by  entering  the  crossproduct  term  of 

supervisor and subordinate LBDQ subscale scores in predicting job satisfaction. First, 

subordinate  (X)  and  supervisor (Y)  LBDQ subscale scores were entered  as a  block. 

Then, the crossproduct term (XY) was entered and the corresponding increment in R2 

tested for significance (Tabachnik & Fidell,  1989). A summary of these analyses for 

each of the three LBDQ subscales in presented in Table 36.

For  the  subscaie  of  Consideration,  when  the  individual  subordinate  and 

supervisor scores were entered as a block in the first step, the regression weight for 

supervisor  scores  was  significant  and  negative  although  the  model  was  not 

significant When the subordinate-supervisor crossproduct term was entered into the 

equation  in the second step,  it was not associated with  a significant increase  in  R2

nor  was  the  model  significant.  Furthermore,  in  the  second  step,  none  of  the 

component terms  in  the  model  had  a  significant  regression  coefficient (see Table 

36).

For the subscale of Tolerance of Freedom,  when  the  individual  subordinate 

and supervisor scores were entered as a block in the first step, the regression weight 

for  subordinate  scores  was  significant  and  positive  although  the  model  was  not 

significant. When the subordinate-supervisor crossproduct term was entered into the 

equation  in the second step,  it was not associated with  a significant increase in  R2 

nor  was  the  model  significant  Furthermore,  none  of the  component terms  in  the 

model had a significant regression coefficient (see Table 36).

For the subscale of Initiating Structure, the subordinate and supervisor scores 

entered  in  the first step  were  not significant  either as  a  block or  individually.  The 

entry  of  the  subordinate-supervisor  crossproduct  term  into  the  equation  in  the 

second  step  was  not  associated  with  a  significant  increase  in  R2.  Furthermore, 

neither the  model  or any of the component terms  was found to  be significant (see 

Table 36).

In summary, the  hierarchical test of the subordinate-supervisor crossproduct 

terms  for  each  of  the  LBDQ  subscales  failed  to  find  evidence  of  a  relationship 

between subordinate-supervisor interaction and job satisfaction.

Regression Modeling (LBDQ Subscales and Job Satisfaction)

For each LBDQ subscale, the models implied by the algebraic-difference score 

and  the squared-difference score  were compared  to  their  unconstrained  versions. 

This was accomplished by calculating two regression equations for each model. One 

equation  consisted  of  job  satisfaction  regressed  onto  the  difference  score  in 

question. This was the constrained equation. The other equation was job satisfaction 

regressed  onto  the  component  terms  of  the  difference  score.  This  was  the 

unconstrained  equation.  The  difference  in  R2  between  the  unconstrained  and

constrained regression equations was then tested (Cohen & Cohen, 1983, Edwards, 

1995).  if the  R2 for the  unconstrained  equation  was  greater than  the  R2 for the 

constrained equation, the constraint was not supported.

For the algebraic-difference score, the constrained  regression  equation  was 

calculated  by regressing job satisfaction scores onto the algebraic-difference score 

(X-Y). The unconstrained equation corresponded to job satisfaction scores regressed 

onto subordinate scores (X) and supervisor scores (Y) as a block. For each subscale, 

the R2 for each equation was compared. A summary of these analyses is presented in 

Table 37. With  one exception,  none of the constrained  or unconstrained equations 

was found to be significant.

The exception  was the difference score term  for Tolerance of Freedom.  The 

result of this regression equation parallels the significant correlation found between 

the difference score and job satisfaction. Nevertheless, when subordinate scores are 

controlled  for,  the difference score term  fails to significantly  increase the variance 

explained. This is demonstrated  in the hierarchical regression analysis presented  in 

Table 38.

For each subscale, the  model  implied  by the squared-difference  model  was 

tested  in  a similar manner. The constrained equation was calculated  by regressing 

job satisfaction  scores  onto the  squared-difference term  (X-Y)2.  The  unconstrained 

model  corresponded  to  job  satisfaction  scores  regressed  onto  the  terms  of  the 

unconstrained  quadratic  terms:  subordinate  scores  (X),  supervisor  scores  (Y), 

squared  subordinate  scores  (X2),  squared  supervisor  scores  (Y2),  and 

the 

crossproduct term (XY). These terms are derived from the expansion of the squared- 

difference equation. For each subscale, the difference in R2 between the constrained 

and unconstrained equations was tested (Cohen & Cohen,  1983, Edwards, 1995). A

summary of these analyses is presented in Table 39. Without exception, none of the 

constrained or unconstrained equations was significant.

In summary, the hypothesis of a relationship between subordinate-supervisor 

LBDQ subscale score similarity and job satisfaction was not supported by any of the 

analytical methods used. The tests of the models implied by the difference score and 

the  squared-difference  score  parallel  the  results  found  when  these  indices  were 

correlated directly with job satisfaction. Furthermore, no relationship o f another form 

was found for the joint effect of subordinate-supervisor scores and job satisfaction. 

The only relationship found was attributable to the sole effect of subordinate scores.

Hypothesis 4B- Performance Ratings and Similarity on LBDQ 

The  hypothesized  relationship  between  subordinate-supervisor  similarity  on 

LBDQ subscale scores and  performance  ratings was tested  with three approaches. 

The  first  approach  was  the  correlation  of  both  algebraic-difference  scores  and 

squared-difference scores with  performance  ratings. Secondly,  two  profile similarity 

measures  were  also  correlated  with  performance  ratings.  Lastly,  two  multiple 

regression techniques were applied. The first of these was the crossproduct test. The 

second was the use of the regression modeling approach which tested the underlying 

models implied  by the difference scores and also tested for any linear or quadratic 

form of an existing relationship.

performance ratings. The resulting correlations are presented in Table 40. Except for 

the algebraic-difference score for initiating Structure,  none of the correlations were 

significant. The correlation between the Initiating Structure algebraic-difference score 

and  performance  ratings  was  found  to  be  significant and  positive,  indicating that 

greater differences between subordinate and supervisor scores in Initiating Structure 

are associated with higher performance ratings.

between the Initiating Structure difference score and performance ratings was tested 

by  calculating  a  partial  correlation  of  Initiating  Structure  difference  score  with 

performance ratings while controlling for the effect of the individual supervisor and 

subordinate terms. The first-order partial correlation between the Initiating Structure 

difference  score  and  performance  ratings,  controlling  for  Supervisor  Initiating 

Structure  scores  reduces  the  relationship  to  non-significance, >i(102)  =  .02,  p.  -

supervisory Initiating Structure scores.

Profile Similarity Index (LBDQ Subscales with Performance)

For  each  LBDQ  subscale,  a  profile  similarity  index  was  created  which 

compared the  profile of responses  by subordinates and  supervisors to the  items  in 

the subscale. This  profile similarity index was calculated  by squaring the difference 

between subordinate and supervisor responses to each subscale item and summing 

these differences across all the items in the subscale and the taking the square root 

of  these  summed  squared-differences.  This  profile  similarity  index  was  also 

calculated for the three LBDQ subscales combined as a whole. Correlations between 

these subscale  profile  similarity  indices and  performance  ratings  are  presented  in 

Table 41.  None of the indices for the subscales and the index for all three together 

correlated significantly with performance rating.

Profile Correlation (Q) (LBDQ and Performance)

A profile correlation score (Q) was computed for the three LBDQ subscales as 

a  whole  by  correlating  subordinate  responses  with  supervisor  responses  to  each 

item. The Q score was computed for the three LBDQ subscales as a whole, for a total 

of 30  items,  because  the  sensitivity  of correlations  to  the  number  of component 

pairs.  The  resulting  Q  scores  were  subsequently  submitted  to  a  Fisher  r  to  z 

transformation (Cohen & Cohen,  1983). Higher Zq scores therefore reflected greater 

profile similarity.

A  significant  positive  correlation  was  found  between  the  Zq  score  and 

Performance  Ratings,  r(103)=  .25,  p.=  .011.  In  order to test the  parsimony of the 

profile  similarity  index,  a  partial  correlation  between  the  Q-score  and  performance 

ratings was calculated, controlling for subordinate and supervisor scores on the three 

LBDQ  scales  as  a  whole.  This  second-order  partial  correlation  was  found  to  be

was also associated with higher performance ratings.

Hierarchical Crossproduct Analysis (LBDQ Subscales and Performance).

For each of the LBDQ subscales, a hierarchical regression model was built to 

test  the  incremental  variance  explained  by  entering  the  crossproduct  term  of 

supervisor and subordinate LBDQ subscale scores in predicting performance ratings. 

First, since performance ratings were found to vary significantly with supervisor sex, 

supervisor sex was entered into the equation as a control variable. Then, subordinate 

(X)  and  supervisor  (Y)  LBDQ  subscale  scores  were  entered  as  a  block.  Then,  the 

crossproduct term (XV) was entered and the corresponding increment in R2 tested for 

significance (Tabachnik & Fidell, 1989). A summary of these analyses for each of the 

three LBDQ subscales in presented in Table 42.

As found  in  previous analysis, supervisor sex,  entered  in  the first step,  was 

found to  be significantly related to  performance  ratings. The sign  of the  regression 

coefficient indicated that performance ratings were lower for female supervisors than 

for male supervisors.  Furthermore, for each  subscale, the  regression  coefficient for 

supervisor sex remained significant in all steps (see Table 42).

For the  subscale  of Consideration, the  entry  of subordinate  and  supervisor 

scores as a  block in step 2 was not associated with a significant increase in R2 and 

the  resulting equation  was  not significant.  The  entry of the  subordinate-supervisor 

crossproduct term in step 3 was also not associated with a significant increase in R2 

and the resulting model was also not significant (see Table 42).

For  the  subscale  of  Tolerance  of  Freedom,  the  entry  of  subordinate  and 

supervisor scores as a block in step 2 was associated with a significant increase in 

R2 and the resulting equation was significant. In step 2, the regression coefficient for 

supervisor Tolerance of Freedom scores was significant and positive. The entry of the 

subordinate-supervisor  crossproduct  term  in  step  3  was  not  associated  with  a 

significant increase in  R2 although the resulting equation was significant (see Table 

42).

For  the  subscale  of  Initiating  Structure,  the  entry  of  subordinate  and 

supervisor scores as a  block in step 2 was associated with a significant increase in 

R2 and the resulting equation was significant. The entry of the subordinate-supervisor 

crossproduct term in step 3 was also associated with a significant increase in R2 and 

the  resulting equation  was  also  significant.  Furthermore,  the  regression  weight for 

the  crossproduct term  was  significant and  negative  (see  Table  42).  This  indicates 

that  as  the  difference  between  subordinate  Initiating  Structure  and  supervisor 

Initiating Structure increases, there is some decrease in performance ratings.

In summary, the hypothesis of a relationship between subordinate-supervisor 

agreement  and  performance  ratings  was  supported  for  the  Initiating  Structure 

subscale.

Regression Modeling (LBDQ Subscales and Performance)

For each LBDQ subscale, the models implied by the algebraic-difference score 

and  the  squared-difference  score  were  compared  to  their  unconstrained  versions.

This was accomplished by calculating two regression equations for each model. One 

equation  consisted  o f performance  ratings  regressed  onto  the  difference  score  in 

question. This was the constrained  equation. The other equation  was  performance 

ratings  regressed  onto the  component terms of the  difference  score. This was the 

unconstrained equation.  In  both  cases, a term corresponding to supervisor sex was 

included in the equations since supervisor sex was found to be significantly related to 

performance  ratings.  The  difference  in  R2  between  the  unconstrained  and 

constrained regression equations was then tested (Cohen & Cohen,  1983,  Edwards, 

1995).  if the  R2 for the  unconstrained  equation  was  greater  than  the  R2  for  the 

constrained equation, the constraint was not supported.

For the algebraic-difference  score,  the constrained  regression  equation  was 

calculated by regressing performance ratings onto supervisor sex and the algebraic- 

difference  score  (X-Y).  The  unconstrained  equation  corresponded  to  performance 

rating$ regressed onto supervisor sex, subordinate scores (X) and supervisor scores 

(Y)  as  a  block.  For  each  subscale,  the  R2  for  each  equation  was  compared.  A 

summary of these analyses is presented in Table 43.

Neither the constrained  nor the unconstrained equations were significant for 

the  Consideration  subscale.  Although  the  constrained  equation  was  significant for 

both  the  Tolerance  of  Freedom  and  the 

Initiating  Structure  subscales,  the 

unconstrained  equations for both these subscales accounted  for significantly more

variance.  The  algebraic-difference  score  model  was  not supported  for any  of the 

three subscales (see Table 43).

The  model  implied  by  the  squared-difference  model  was  tested  for  each 

subscale in a similar manner. The constrained equation was calculated by regressing 

performance ratings onto supervisor sex and the squared-difference term (X-Y)2.

The  unconstrained  model  corresponded  to  performance  ratings  regressed 

onto supervisor sex and the terms of the unconstrained quadratic terms: subordinate 

scores (X), supervisor scores (Y), squared subordinate scores (X2), squared supervisor 

scores  (Y2),  and  the  crossproduct  term  (XY).  These  terms  are  derived  from  the 

expansion  of the squared-difference equation. For each subscale, the difference  in 

R2  between  the  constrained  and  unconstrained  equations  was  tested  (Cohen  & 

Cohen,  1983,  Edwards,  1995). A summary of these analyses  is  presented  in  Table 

44.

The  results  of these comparisons were similar to the tests of the algebraic- 

difference  model.  Neither  the  constrained  nor the  unconstrained  equations  were 

significant  for  the  subscale  of  Consideration.  For  the  subscales  of  Tolerance  of 

Freedom  and  Initiating  Structure,  the  unconstrained  equations  accounted  for 

significantly more variance than the constrained equations (see Table 44).

A  summary  of  the  results  of  this  analysis  for  the  Tolerance  of  Freedom 

subscale  is  presented  in  Table  45.  The  entry  of  the  squared  subordinate  and 

supervisor  terms  in  the  third  step  was  the  last  step  which  resulted  in  both  a 

significant equation and a significant increase in variance explained (see Table 45). 

The quadratic model, therefore, was considered the best fitting model.

For the Consideration subscale, neither an unconstrained linear nor quadratic 

model was found to relate subordinate and supervisor scores jointly to performance 

ratings. On the other hand, although the difference score models were not supported, 

unconstrained linear and quadratic models were both found to be significant for the 

subscales of Tolerance  of Freedom  and  Initiating Structure.  In  order to test which 

model was the best fit for the data, a  hierarchical regression equation was built by 

entering supervisor sex in the equation in the first step. In the second step, the linear 

terms of subordinate scores (X) and supervisor scores (Y) were entered jointly. In the 

third  step,  the  quadratic  terms  of  squared  subordinate  scores  (X2)  and  squared 

supervisor scores (Y2) were entered. Finally, the crossproduct term (XY) was entered 

to  complete the  full  quadratic  model.  The  last block  of terms  which  resulted  in  a 

significant regression equation and in a significant increase in  R2 was considered to 

specify the best fitting model.

A  plot  of  the  estimated  surface  of  performance  ratings  as  a  function  of 

supervisor and subordinate Tolerance of Freedom scores is displayed in Figure 6. The 

plotted surface has not been  extended  beyond the  range of the actual subordinate 

and supervisor scores. It reflects, therefore, the restriction of the range of supervisor 

scores to the upper half of the scale range.

The minimum supervisor scale score for Tolerance of Freedom was 3.4. The 

minimum  Tolerance of Freedom score for subordinates was 2.0. The shape of the 

plotted surface is slightly saddle-shaped. The relationship between supervisor scores 

and  performance ratings is generally flatter at the lower scores (near the middle of 

the scale) and curves upward as supervisor scores increase toward the high end of 

the scale. The relationship between subordinate scores and performance ratings is a 

curve which  is higher at the midrange o f the scale and tends to curve down at the 

lower and higher extremities of the scale range (see Figure 6).

For the Initiating Structure subscale, the entry of the squared subordinate and 

supervisor terms (X2 and  Y2)  was  not accompanied  by a  significant  increase  in  R2. 

Nevertheless,  a  significant  increment  in  R2  was  accompanied  by the  entry  of the 

crossproduct term (XY) in the next step. Therefore, the order of entry of these blocks 

was  reversed  for  Initiating Structure.  A summary of the  results  of this  analysis  is 

presented  in Table 46. The best fit for the data was found to be the linear term with 

subordinate scores and supervisor scores and the crossproduct term (see Table 46).

A  plot  of  the  estimated  surface  of  performance  rating?  as  a  function  of 

supervisor and  subordinate  Initiating Structure (IS)  scores  is  displayed  in  Figure  7. 

The  plotted  surface  has  not  been  extended  beyond  the  range  of  the  actual 

subordinate and supervisor scores. The plot depicts, therefore, the restriction of the 

range  of  supervisor  scores  to  the  top  part  of  the  scale  range.  The  minimum 

supervisor IS score was 3.9. The minimum subordinate IS score was 1.9. The shape

of the resulting plot is a twisted  plane. At lower subordinate IS scores, the slope of 

the relationship between performance ratings and supervisor IS score is steeper than 

at higher subordinate IS scores.

Hypothesis 5- OBSE as Moderator

A  hierarchical  regression  procedure,  similar to the test for the  subordinate-

supervisor  crossproduct  term, w a s   used  to  test  for  the  moderating  effect  of

Organization-Based Self-Esteem on the relationship between subordinate-supervisor

LBDQ subscale similarity and the dependent variables of interest in this study. The

following regression  model was tested: Z= bo + biX + IteY +  b3M + b<MX +  bsMY in

which  X  and  Y  are  subordinate  and  supervisor scores  respectively  on  the  LBDQ

subscale and M is the potential moderator OBSE. For each subscale, the subordinate

(X) and supervisor (Y) scores for that subscale and the subordinate OBSE scores (M)

were  entered  as  a  block.  For  the  dependent  variable  of  performance  rating,

supervisor sex was included  in this initial block since it was found to be significantly

related  to  performance  ratings.  The  moderator  product  terms  XM  and  XY  were

entered as a block in the second step and the increase in R2 tested for significance.

The  moderator  hypothesis  was  considered  to  be  supported  if  the  entry  of  the

moderator product terms, while controlling for the component terms, accounted for a

significant increment in R2 (Edwards, 1994b).

Hypothesis 5A: Job Satisfaction as Dependent Variable.

A  summary  of  the  results  of  the  hierarchical  regression  analysis  of  the 

moderating effects of OBSE on the  linear relationship  between  supervisor-similarity 

LBDQ  subscale similarity on  subordinate job satisfaction  is  presented  in  Table 47. 

For each of the three subscales, the entry of the moderated terms into the regression 

model did not result in a significant equation nor did it result in a significant increase

in  R2 (see Table 47). A hypothesized  moderator effect, therefore, was not supported 

for the dependent variable of job satisfaction.

Hypothesis 5B: Performance Ratings as Dependent Variable 

A  summary  of  the  results  of  the  hierarchical  regression  analysis  of  the 

moderating  effects  of  OBSE  on 

the 

linear  relationship  between  supervisor- 

subordinate LBDQ subscale similarity on  performance ratings  is  presented  in Table 

48.

For  the  subscale  of  Consideration,  there  was  no  relationship  between 

subordinate  and  supervisor  scores  and  performance  ratings.  The  moderator 

hypothesis, therefore, was not supported for this subscale. However, the entry of the 

moderator terms  into  the  regression  equations  for the  subscales  of  Tolerance  of 

Freedom  and  Initiating Structure,  while  controlling for the  component terms,  was 

associated with significant increases in explained variance. This indicates support for 

the moderator hypothesis for these two scales (see Table 48).

moderates the  relationship  between  supervisor scores and  performance  ratings,  it 

does  not  affect  the  relationship  between  subordinate  scores  and  performance 

ratings.

A  plot  of the  effect  of  OBSE  on  the  relationship  between  supervisor  and 

subordinate Tolerance of Freedom  scores and  performance  ratings  is  displayed  in 

Figure  8. The corresponding plot for Initiating Structure  is displayed  in  Figure 9.  In 

both  cases, the estimated  surface is depicted  at values of OBSE representing one 

standard deviation below the mean, the mean, and one standard deviation above the 

mean. For both subscales, the plots show that the slope of the relationship between 

supervisor scores and  performance  ratings  levels off as  OBSE  increases.  For  both 

subscales, 

the  slope  of  the 

relationship  between  subordinate  scores  and 

performance rating$ is not affected by the change in level of OBSE (see Figure 7 for 

Tolerance of Freedom and Figure 8 for Initiating Structure).

The hypothesis of the moderating effect of OBSE on the relationship between 

subordinate-supervisor  similarity  and  performance  rating$  was  not  supported. 

Although  a  moderating  effect  was  found  for  OBSE,  its  effect  was  limited  to  the 

relationship between supervisor scores and performance ratings.

DISCUSSION

The  purpose of this study was to extend  organizational  research  into dyadic 

attitudinal similarity and  its  relationship with the work outcomes of job  satisfaction 

and performance ratings into an international population  in  Latin America. A further 

intent  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  the  use  of  multiple  regression  as  an 

alternative  to  traditional  difference  scores  methods.  It was  shown  how  regression 

techniques could not only replicate the results of difference score analyses but could 

also  be  extended  to  test  for  interaction  effects  and  moderators.  A  number  of 

hypotheses were proposed in this study concerning the relationship of both relational 

demography  and  belief similarity  with  the  work  outcomes  of job  satisfaction  and 

performance ratings.

An  interesting  effect  was  found  for the  effect  of  dyad  sex  composition  on 

performance rating$. Although  not significant, the pattern of results for dyad sex job 

satisfaction  scores  mirrored  this finding.  Furthermore,  multiple  regression  analyses 

uncovered  relationships  between  dyad  member  attitudes  on  ideal 

leadership 

behaviors and  performance ratings that did not conform to the relationships implied 

by  difference  scores.  In  other  words,  the  symmetrical  relationships  implied  by 

difference scores were  not supported  by the data.  Instead, the regression analyses 

identified  other which  linked the joint relationship of dyad attitudes to performance

126

ratings.  The  regression  analyses  also  allowed  for the  plotting  of these  estimated 

models. No alternative relationships were found for the outcome of job satisfaction. 

For  both  work  outcomes,  moreover,  no  relationship  was  found  for  dyad  age 

composition.

Finally, the regression approach was extended to test the moderating effect of 

subordinate  Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  on  the  relationship  between  dyadic 

attitude  similarity and the  work  outcomes.  For  both  work outcomes,  however,  the 

hypothesis  was  not  supported.  The  relationship  between  the  dyad  attitudes, 

considered  jointly,  and  the  outcomes  was  not  found  moderated  by  OBSE. 

Nevertheless,  subordinate  OBSE  was  found  to  moderate  the  effect  of  supervisor 

attitudes and the performance ratings they assigned to their subordinates.

Hypothesis h  Dyadic Sex Composition 

It  was  hypothesized 

that  similarity 

in  sex  between  supervisors  and 

subordinates would be related to higher job satisfaction for subordinates and higher 

performance  ratings by supervisors.  For both  outcomes, this  hypothesis was tested 

with an analysis of variance. The analysis of variance of performance ratings by dyad 

sex composition  revealed a  main  effect for supervisor sex and an  interaction effect 

between  supervisor and  subordinate sex.  In  general,  mean  performance  ratings  by 

female supervisors were lower than  ratings by male supervisors,  but this effect was 

accounted for by male subordinates.

127

The  analysis  failed  to  reveal  any  relationship  between  supervisor  and 

subordinate sex and job satisfaction.  However,  inspection  of the distribution  of job 

satisfaction  scores,  revealed  an  interesting  pattern.  The  distributions  for  job 

satisfaction  scores  for  subordinates  in  three  of  the  supervisor-subordinate  sex 

combinations were very similar. The exception was the distribution of scores for male 

subordinates of female supervisors. Furthermore, although not significant, the mean 

job satisfaction for subordinates in this dyad sex combination was the lowest of the 

four combinations. This pattern was not statistically significant,  but it is particularly 

interesting in light of the results of the relationship between performance ratings and 

dyad sex composition.

There  are  two  possible  general  explanations  of  why  male  subordinates  of 

female  supervisors  received  lower  performance  rating^.  One  possibility  is that the 

lower rating$ are the result of a bias on the part of female supervisors. This bias is 

suggested by the similarity-attraction theory (Byrne, 1971; Williams & O'Reilly, 1998). 

Although the differences between the cell means were not all significant, the theory 

is  supported  by  the  pattern  of  the  performance  rating  means  by  dyad  sex 

composition.  Consistent  with  the  similarityattraction  approach,  the  two  highest 

performance rating means were within sex-similar dyads and the two lowest rating$ 

were for the sex-dissimilar dyads. This similarity-attraction approach, however, would 

predict a symmetrical relationship. In this study, the effect was significant only for the

female  supervisors.  Therefore,  the  effect  is  one-sided  and  it  applies  to  female 

supervisors.

Social  comparison  theories,  known  as  Social  Categorization  or  Social 

Identification theories have been proposed as added theoretical mechanisms for the 

effects of similarity within organizations (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Williams & O'Reilly, 

1998). In this approach, individuals are assumed to be motivated to maintain a high 

level  of self-esteem.  One  way this  is  done  is through  comparisons  with  others.  In 

order  to  make  these  comparisons,  individuals  must  first  categorize  or  identify 

themselves to  create  a  basis for comparison.  These  categorizations  are  based  on 

salient characteristics such as sex, age, or status. Once the categorization  is made, 

individuals  may  seek  to  maintain  a  positive  self-identity  by  maximizing  the 

distinctiveness  of  their  category  from  others  and  their  judgments  of  in-group 

individuals may be positively biased compared to judgments of out-group individuals. 

The salience of a characteristic such as sex is based in part on the proportionality of 

this characteristic in the work group or organization.

The  distribution  of  respondents 

in 

this  study 

indicates 

that 

in 

this 

organization,  women  are  in  the  minority,  especially  as  supervisors.  From  a  social 

categorization  theory  perspective,  this  would  make  it  more  likely  that  female 

supervisors would tend to categorize themselves on the basis of sex and be positively 

biased toward female subordinates and negatively biased toward male subordinates.

129

Conversely, being in the majority, male supervisors would be less likely to be affected 

by the sex of their subordinates (Williams & O'Reilly, 1998).

Interestingly,  female supervisors  seem  to  have  lower OBSE scores  (M=4.7) 

than  their  male  counterparts  (M=5.2)  although  the  difference  does  not  reach 

statistical  significance,  F(l,28)*3.45,  MSE*.327,  p.  *.074.  However,  their  self­

performance  rating$  (M=4.25)  are  very  close  to  that  of their  male  counterparts 

(M=4.25). This implies that female supervisors in this company may feel themselves 

to be less valued in the organization than their male counterparts although they rate 

themselves as being equal performers.

The other possible general explanation for the lower performance  ratings by 

female supervisors of male subordinates is that these  ratings  reflect a  “true score” 

reality that the  male subordinates are  lower performers. This  proposition,  however, 

implies  one  of two  corollaries:  either  male  subordinates  are  lower  performers  in 

general  but they  received  positively  biased  appraisals  by  male  supervisors  or only 

male subordinates assigned to female supervisors are lower performers. The testing 

of  these  propositions  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study  since  no  objective 

performance measures are available to serve as criteria for accuracy.

The  relational  demography  literature  indicates that  research  results  on  the 

effects  of sex-differences  have  been  notoriously variable.  Sex  effects  vary  in  their 

magnitude and  in their direction  (Williams &  O'Reilly,  1998).  Lefkowitz  (1994)  has 

suggested that a major reason for this variability is that sex often covaries with other

organizational variables (e.g. job level, status, societal norms,  pay level) which  may 

be related to the outcomes of interest

In  the  United  States,  the  ideal  of equality of the sexes  in  the  workplace  is 

barely  a  generation  old  as  a  widely  held  and  accepted  belief.  We  may  assume, 

therefore,  that  the  exportation  of  this  ideal  to  multinational  operations  and  the 

adoption  by  local  work forces  may  not be  even  that old.  It  may  be  reasonable  to 

speculate,  for  instance,  that  because  of cultural  norms,  women  in  Latin-American 

countries  may tend to find  themselves  in  lower status positions  in  organizations.  It 

would follow, therefore, that on  average, there  might be some differences between 

men  assigned  to  work for  women  and  men  assigned  to  work  for  other  men.  For 

instance, men assigned to work for women may also be lower in status and possibly 

be  lower performers.  Another  possibility  is that  men  who  work for women  may  be 

more  likely  to  resent  their  situation  which  could  lead  to  negative  attitudinal  or 

behavioral outcomes.  Further research should concentrate not only on whether sex- 

differences in  performance ratinga exist within companies in  Latin America  but also 

on why these differences occur.

Hypothesis 2: Age

Difference score and regression techniques were applied to the testing of the 

hypothesized  relationship  between  supervisor-subordinate  age  similarity  and  work 

outcomes. Both methods failed to reveal any such relationship.

131

The  literature  on  the  effect  of  dyadic  age  similarity  on  work  outcomes  is 

scarce and  the findings  inconsistent. As  reviewed  above, Judge and  Ferris  (1993) 

found an indirect relationship between age similarity and  lower performance ratings 

while  Tsui  and  O'Reilly  (1989)  found  no  relationship  between  age  similarity  and 

perceived effectiveness. Williams and O'Reilly (1998) have suggested that the effects 

of age diversity may be very subtle and most likely to have a detectable effect at the 

group level rather than at an individual level of analysts.

If  the  effect  of  age  is  in  fact  subtle,  there  was  perhaps  something  of  a 

restriction  of range within this study. The great majority of respondents were within 

25 and 45 years of age and supervisors were only slightly older.

Hypothesis 3: Time Spent Away 

No support was found for the hypotheses that similarity between supervisors 

and subordinates on the time they had spent away from their home country would be 

related to job satisfaction and performance ratings. In this study, the great majority of 

respondents  had  not lived outside of their home country for more than  a year.  It is 

likely that there was  not enough  variability  in  this  independent variable to find  an 

effect with these outcomes.

Hypothesis 4: LBDQ Subscales 

No  support  for  this  hypothesis  was  found  for  either  job  satisfaction  or 

performance  ratings  when  difference  scores  were  used.  Furthermore,  the  models 

underlying the difference scores were tested using regression techniques and these

analyses further confirmed  the  lack of results for the  difference  scores.  However, 

when  regression methods were used to compare difference score models with their 

unconstrained versions,  other  interesting relationships were found.  In  other words, 

relationships  were  found  between  dyad  scores  and  performance  ratings  which 

differed from the symmetrical models assumed by the difference scores.

Depending  on  how  strictly  similarity  (or  agreement) 

is  defined,  these 

relationships may or may not be considered as support for the hypothesis. They do 

not support the hypothesis if similarity is defined as the equal joint effect of the X and 

Y variables as implied by the difference scores. However, if the joint effects of X and Y 

are allowed to have unequal weights, then the resulting relationships that were found 

are of interest and can be considered at least partial support for the hypothesis.

The results of the difference-score analysis illustrated the concern about the 

parsimony  of  difference  scores,  as  discussed  in  the  critique  of  the  method. 

Parsimony  refers  to  economy  of  explanation  which  means  that  a  more  simple 

explanation for an effect is preferable to a more complex explanation.

The  difference  score  approach  did  not  result  in  support for the  hypothesis 

even though the algebraic difference-score for Tolerance of Freedom was found to be 

significantly correlated  with job  satisfaction  and  the  algebraic-difference  score  for 

Initiating structure was found to be significantly correlated with  performance ratings. 

In  both these cases,  if the analysis were stopped at this point the logical  inference

would be that supervisor and subordinate similarity on these subscales were related 

to the two outcomes. However, this explanation was not parsimonious.

Further  analyses  revealed  that the  difference  scores  had  confounded  the 

effects  of  the  subordinate  and  supervisor  scores.  For  instance,  the  apparent 

relationship  between  the  Tolerance  of  Freedom  (TOF)  difference  score  and  Job 

Satisfaction was,  in fact, mostly attributable to variation  in subordinate scores. That 

is to say, the variance in job satisfaction explained by the TOF difference score was 

more simply explained by the subordinate scores. Similarly, the apparent relationship 

between the Initiating Structure difference score and performance ratings was mostly 

attributable  to  variation  in  supervisor  scores.  That  is  to  say,  the  variance  in 

performance ratings which seemed to be explained by the difference score was more 

simply explained by the supervisor scores.

In  both these cases, therefore, the use of the difference score added a  layer 

of  complexity without adding explanatory  usefulness.  In  other words,  the  variance 

explained  in the outcome variable  by difference score  itself was  not more than the 

variance explained  by one of the contributing variables.  Therefore,  for both  cases, 

the  simplest and  thus  the  best explanation  for the  observed  relationship  was the 

influence  of  the  single  component  term.  The  more  complex  explanation  of  the 

difference  score,  which  involved  two  components  in  a  specific  form,  was  not 

supported.

134

Another concern  highlighted  by the  results  of this study is the form  of the 

relationships  underlying  difference  scores  and  how  well  they  describe  existing 

relationships. As noted, the single component was found to be a better explanation of 

variance in performance ratings than the difference score between subordinate and 

supervisor  Initiating  Structure  scores.  Again,  if the  analysis  were  stopped  at  this 

point  the  inference  would  be  that  there  was  no  similarity  or  agreement  effect 

However,  the  regression  techniques  used  in  this  study  did  find  that  the  joint 

relationship between subordinate and supervisor scores did explain some variance in 

performance  ratings  beyond  the  variance  explained  by  the  individual  component 

scores. This relationship, however, had a different form that what was represented by 

the difference score. If the analyses of the data had been limited to difference score 

models, this existing relationship would have been missed.

A further benefit of the hierarchical regression technique is that it can be used 

to  derive  response-surface  models  which  best  fit  the  data  by  representing  the 

outcome of interest as a function of the two component terms. In this study, the best 

fitting  model  for  performance  ratings  as  a  function  of subordinate  and  supervisor 

Initiating  Structure  scores  was  the  surface  formed  by  the  two  scores  and  their 

crossproduct  The  best  fitting  model  for  performance  ratings  as  a  function  of 

subordinate and supervisor Tolerance of Freedom scores was found to be based on a 

quadratic  equation.  In  this  case,  the  only  term  with  a  significant  regression

135

coefficient was the square of the subordinate scores. The other terms/although not 

significant, had regression coefficients that were comparable in size.

It should  be emphasized that the response-surface models derived from this 

procedure  represent the  best fit to the available data. Therefore,  they represent a 

source of hypotheses about the general relationships among the variables of interest 

If the  form  of  an  obtained  relationship  is  to  be  generalized,  the  model  must  be 

subjected  to  cross-validation.  Furthermore,  until the  generalizability of the  derived 

models is established, it is unwise to over-interpret the forms of the relations and to 

develop complex interpretations of the surface.

Besides the difference scores and the regression techniques, the hypothesis 

was  also  tested  with  a  profile  correlation  index  (Q)  for the  three  LBDQ  subscales 

combined.  Although  the  Q-score  was  found  to  be  significantly  correlated  with 

performance ratings, the interpretation of this result is difficult because it is unclear 

what this congruence measure represents conceptually. The finding indicates that in 

this  data,  there  is  a  modest  relationship  between  performance  rating$  and  the 

agreement between supervisors and subordinates on the profile of their responses to 

the  individual  items  of  the  LBDQ  subscales.  Conceptually,  this  is  different  than 

comparing the scores on the subscales of interest Furthermore, the Q-score ignores 

information on the distance between responses or the elevations of the profiles. The 

profile similarity index includes this information and it was not found to be correlated 

with either outcome.

136

In  summary,  the  hypothesis  was  not supported  when  the  relationship  was 

constrained to models  implied  by the difference scores. When the  relationship was 

unconstrained, some partial support for the hypothesis was found for a specific LBDQ 

subscale. The Q-score also indicated that the profile agreement between subordinate 

and  supervisor  item  responses  was  also  related  to  performance  ratings,  but  this 

relationship is difficult to interpret

Hypothesis 5: Moderating Effect o f Organization-Based Self-Esteem

The hypothesis that Organization-Based  Self-Esteem  (OBSE) would  moderate 

the  effect  of  subordinate-supervisor  similarity  on  LBDQ  subscale  scores  and  the 

outcomes  of interest was  not supported  for either job  satisfaction  or performance 

ratings.  A  moderating  effect was  found  but  it  did  not act  on  both  supervisor and 

subordinate scores. The moderating effect of OBSE was limited to the relationship of 

the individual term of supervisor scores with performance ratings.

As  shown  in  Figure  7  for Tolerance  of  Freedom  and  Figure  8  for  Initiating 

Structure,  OBSE  moderated  the  relationship  between  supervisor  scores  and 

performance  ratings. When  subordinate OBSE was  lower, the  relationship  between 

supervisor  scores  and  performance  ratings  was  stronger,  as  demonstrated  in  the 

slope  of  the  surface  along  the  Y-axis.  As  OBSE  increased,  the  strength  of  the 

relationship  decreased,  as  demonstrated  by the slope of the surface.  In  all  cases, 

there  was  no  relationship  subordinate  scores  and  performance  rating?  was  not 

affected as demonstrated by the lack of a slope for the surface along the X-axis.

137

Interestingly,  subordinate  OBSE  seems  to  moderate  supervisor  behavior. 

Subordinates  with  higher  OBSE  scores  are 

likely  to  receive  uniformly  high 

performance  ratings  from  their supervisors.  However,  for  subordinates  with  lower 

OBSE  scores,  supervisory  performance  ratings  tend  to  covary  with  supervisory 

responses to the LBDQ subscales of Tolerance of Freedom and Initiating Structure.

The  reason  for this  relationship  can  only  be  speculated  on.  It  is  likely that 

subordinates  with  high  OBSE  maintain  this  relatively  stable  and  persistent  self- 

evaluation  based  on  organizational  feedback  of  their  worth  and  value  to  the 

organization.  This  feedback 

is 

likely  to 

include  positive 

feedback  on 

their 

performance.  Furthermore,  supervisors  are  likely  to  also  maintain  stable  and 

persistent evaluations of these  employees.  Perhaps  supervisors converge on  high 

performance  ratings  for  subordinate  with  high  OBSE  scores.  On  the  other  hand, 

employees with  lower OBSE are less likely to be automatically considered to be high 

performers.

As discussed  previously,  individuals with  low OBSE are theorized to  be  more 

reactive  to  external  influences than  individuals  with  high  OBSE.  Therefore,  lower 

OBSE subordinates may be more reactive to supervisor leadership style. Supervisors 

who endorse Tolerance of Freedom  and Initiating Structure  more strongly may also 

influence their low OBSE employees to higher performance.

It may also be the case that supervisors dont tend to have reached a stable, 

enduring assessment of the  performance of low OBSE employees and therefore do

138

not converge on the  uniformly high  ratings.  The  performance  ratings of low OBSE, 

therefore,  may  be  more  varied.  Furthermore,  supervisors  who  are  more  likely  to 

provide higher responses to some of the subscales may also be  more likely to rate 

their subordinates higher on the scales provided.

General Implications 

One major implication of this study is that researchers should be careful when 

conceptualizing and casting research  questions in terms of dyadic similarity. Terms 

such  as  similarity,  agreement,  or  congruence  seem  simple  and  straightforward. 

Nevertheless,  when  these  terms  are  translated  into  testable  propositions,  the 

resulting analyses imply specific relationships between the variables that represent 

specific forms or constraints that were not considered in the original formulation.

This  was  highlighted  by the  hypotheses of this study.  The  hypotheses  were 

cast in terms of similarity and they were tested with the use of difference scores. The 

models  underlying difference  scores  imply a  strict symmetry  between  the  level  or 

proportion  of the attribute  in  question  between the  individuals  being compared.  In 

other words, for similarity to exist, a certain amount of an attribute in one individual 

(X) should correspond to the same amount of the attribute on the  part of the other 

individual  (Y).  The  term  similarity,  therefore,  implies  that  there  is  a  qualitative 

difference  between  individuals  who  are  on  the  X=Y  line  and  everyone  else  with 

varying degrees of the attribute. Furthermore, the relative proximity of each matched

139

pair to  this  line should  also  have some  relative effect on  the  outcome variable  of 

interest. In this study, for instance, this relationship was not supported.

However,  other relationships between X and Y and the outcomes of interest 

may be theoretically interesting, if the conceptualization of the research question or 

its  testing  is  limited  only  to  the  specific  model  implied  by  similarity,  then  other 

potentially  interesting  relationships  will  be  missed.  Clearly,  researchers  must  be 

careful to make the distinction between the very specific relationship of similarity and 

other,  more  varied  possibilities  of joint  effects.  Analysis  should  be  limited  to  the 

similarity relationship only if other possible joint effects, even if not symmetrical, are 

not of interest

Another  implication  of this  study  is  that  regression  analysis  can  be  a  very 

useful tool for the study of similarity and of other relationships between joint effects 

of matched components and outcomes of interest The method is flexible and allows 

for  various  applications.  On  one  hand,  regression  analysis  can  be  used  in  a 

confirmatory manner to test specified models with a priori constraints. For instance, 

as in this study, it can be used to test the models implied by similarity and difference 

score  hypotheses.  On  the  other  hand,  regression  analysis  can  also  be  used  in  an 

exploratory manner to derive models from the data. These derived  models can then 

be treated as hypothesis and subjected to cross-validation. As demonstrated  in this 

study,  another further application  of  regression  analysis  techniques  is  the  test  of 

potential moderators.

The  viability  of  including  moderators  into  organizational  research  on  the 

relationship between dyadic similarity (or interaction) and dyad outcomes is another 

implication  of  this  study.  Although  it  was  not  found  to  moderate  the  effect  of 

similarity  on  performance  ratings,  OBSE  was  found  to  moderate  the  relationship 

between  supervisor  beliefs  concerning  ideal  leadership  behaviors  and  the  ratings 

they assigned  to their subordinates.  Although  this  result was  unexpected,  it does 

point to the need for more complete models of dyadic interaction. As noted before, 

the literature in the area of similarity contains many instances of inconsistent results. 

Relationships  are  often  not  replicated  consistently  between  studies.  In  order  to 

advance understanding in this area, it is necessary to start focusing on the contexts 

in which similarity or interaction effects occur.

Limitations of the Study

One of the major limitations of this study was the very low internal consistency 

of the  Job  Satisfaction  measure.  None  of the  hypothesized  relationships  with Job 

Satisfaction  were found  to  exist.  Unfortunately,  because  of the  unreliability of the 

measure, this is possibly a result of measurement error.

Despite having demonstrated very high  internal consistency in other studies, 

the  alpha  coefficient obtained  for the Job  Satisfaction  measure  in  this  study was 

unacceptably low. The reliability analysis revealed that the three scale items were not 

intercorrelated. Further inspection of the distribution of responses to the scale items 

revealed that the range of responses were severely restricted. As shown in Figure 3,

the great majority of the responses for the scale items were a t the top of the scale. 

Respondents, therefore, uniformly rated their satisfaction at the highest level of the 

scale.

This  pattern  included  the first item  of the scale which  had  been  negatively 

worded.  If these extreme scores were the  result of a  response  set, then  this  item 

would  have shown a pattern of low scores once it was reversed-scored. Since it did 

not, respondents were presumed to have intentionally selected extreme responses to 

the scale items.

For the LBDQ subscales, the range of responses was also somewhat limited. 

Responses were mostly in the higher end of the scales. For modeling,  it would  have 

been  preferable  to  have  responses  in  the  entire  range.  Because  of  the  limited 

responses range, it is unclear whether the relationships derived in the study apply at 

the lower ends of the scale.

The sample size of this study was limited  by the availability of respondents 

and the  response  rate.  It was reasonable and adequate for the  purposes of testing 

the  simple  difference  score  models  and  for  deriving  the  exploratory  models. 

Nevertheless, in order to extend these kinds of analyses to more complex polynomial 

models, the sample size should be larger. For instance, extending the moderator test 

to the quadratic model would have entailed regression equations with eleven terms. 

If  the  benchmark  is  accepted  of  having  at  least  20  times  more  cases  than 

independent variables (Tabachnik & Fidell,  1989), then the sample size would  have

142

had to be twice the size for this analysis.  Furthermore, a larger sample might have 

helped counteract the unreliability of the job satisfaction measure.

Suggestions for Further Research 

An interesting difference was found in this study in the ways male and female 

supervisors rated their subordinates. The reason for this difference is not evident and 

bears further exploration. However, further research should be focused on more than 

merely  replicating  the  effect  Rather,  there  should  be  an  effort  to  elaborate  the 

underlying reasons for sex effects. This elaboration  is particularly interesting for the 

case  of  US  multinational  companies  in  Latin  America.  Most  US  multinational 

companies  espouse  corporate  ideals  which  value  the  diversity  of their  workforce. 

These companies also have personnel  policies which strive for sex neutrality in the 

treatment of their employees. As these values and policies are exported to the Latin 

American context, they tend to come in conflict with some cultural values and norms 

of the host countries. How these values and policies are interpreted and accepted in 

the  host countries is a  rich source of questions for companies as they expand their 

international operations.

Another  intriguing  finding  of  this  study  was  that  the  relationship  between 

subordinate-supervisor  interaction  on  the  LBDQ  subscales  and  the  outcome  of 

performance ratings varied  by subscale. The various analyses in the study failed to 

find  a  relationship for the Consideration  measure  but did find  relationships for the

143

other two measures. Even for these two other subscales, the relationships differed in 

form.

The  three  subscales  were  included  in  the  study to  allow  for  measures  of 

agreement between supervisors and subordinates on ideal leadership behaviors. The 

specific nature of these behaviors was not a major focus of the study. Nevertheless, 

the results imply that these subscales are not generically interchangeable. It seems 

to matter what attitudes or beliefs about the work place are being compared between 

supervisors and subordinates.

A  more  specific  and  in-depth  consideration  of the  underlying  mechanisms 

between dyadic agreement along different attitudes or beliefs may be called for. Why 

did  dyadic  agreement  on  ideal  Consideration 

leadership  relate  differently  to 

performance  rating? than  did dyadic agreement on  Initiating Structure or Tolerance 

of Freedom behaviors? Perhaps it is because of the nature of the behaviors and their 

relationship  with  the  outcome.  Leader  behaviors  which  fall  under  the  rubric  of 

Consideration  are  concerned  with  "softer”  interpersonal  issues  such  as  respect 

warmth,  and  friendliness.  Agreement  or  disagreement  with  a  supervisor  on  what 

constitutes  an  ideal  level  of  these  behaviors  may  just  not  be  as  relevant  to 

performance  rating?  as  agreement  or  disagreement  about  behaviors  relevant  to 

autonomy  or  work-direction.  Perhaps  organizational  culture  is  a  relevant  context 

Might  dyadic  agreement  on  Consideration  behaviors  be  more  important  in  a

voluntary,  informal, or non-production oriented organization than  in  a  more formal, 

production-oriented environment?

As  noted  above,  the  conceptualization  of  research  questions  about dyadic 

agreement in terms of similarity may be unnecessarily limiting. There may be other 

relationships  between  supervisor  and  subordinate  attributes  which  may  be  of 

theoretical  or  practical 

interest  The  use  of  analytical  procedures  such  as 

demonstrated  in this study allow for the test of the specific similarity relationships 

and also the exploration of other possible relationships.

The use of a  more open-ended approach to dyadic effects,  unconstrained  by 

the similarity model,  may lead  researchers to formulate and test hypotheses which 

imply more complex underlying models. For instance, instead of equating congruence 

simply  with  equal  amounts  of  a  given  attribute,  congruence  may  instead  be 

considered  in  terms  of the  match  between  corresponding variables.  For  example, 

congruence  in  leadership  style  between  supervisor  and  subordinates  may  be 

conceptualized  as  a  match  between  the  supervisor's  desire  for  control  and  the 

subordinate’s  need  for autonomy.  The  regression  techniques  demonstrated  in  this 

study could be adapted to testing these non-symmetrical propositions.
