Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this study is twofold: ﬁrst, to explore whether a linkage between
environmental effects and ﬁnancial performance exists; and second, to investigate whether ﬁrms
displaying more environmental effort show a more signiﬁcantly positive relationship between
environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance than those displaying less green effort.
Design/methodology/approach – The study adopts correlation analysis of a sample comprising of
51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries to investigate the possible relationship
between ﬁrm environmental performance (including three measures: sustainable value, sustainable
value margin, and return to cost ratio) and ﬁnancial performance.
Findings – The paper does not ﬁnd a positive relationship between ﬁrm environmental performance
and ﬁnancial performance. Both the Pearson correlations and Spearman’s rho are statistically
insigniﬁcant for both the full sample and the carbon-intensive sectors. When the lag effect on ﬁrm
ﬁnancial performance is considered, the result remains the same. The result suggests that corporate
good guys in Europe do not necessarily reap the rewards of their green effort.
Research limitations/implications – Future research may investigate the relationship between
ﬁrm environmental efforts and ﬁnancial performance across industries with different technologies and
product life cycles, or industries with similar pollutions/emissions or usage pattern of natural
resources, such as the petroleum industry and the transportation industry.
Practical implications – Although it was not possible to ﬁnd a positive association between
environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance, still, being perceived as a green company
may improve a company’s image and reputation, thus attracting more talented workers and
green-conscious customers.
Originality/value – The paper provides a new perspective on the relationship between ﬁrm
environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance in monetary terms by taking a broader view at
the environmental outcomes. While past studies only measure ﬁrm environmental performance based
on damaging impacts to the environment, the research also considers the efﬁciency of resource use by
the ﬁrm.

Corrigendum
It has come to our attention that the paper “Assessing the greenness effort for European
ﬁrms: a resource efﬁciency perspective” by Vincent Yu, Hsiu-I Ting, Yen-Chun Jim Wu
which appeared in Management Decision, Vol. 47, No. 7, 2009 drew upon signiﬁcantly
and did not fully reference earlier papers: (The) ADVANCE Project (2006), Sustainable
Value of European Industry: A Value-based Analysis of
the Environmental
Performance of European Manufacturing Companies, The ADVANCE Project,
Forres and Berlin and Hahn, T., Figge, F. and Barkemeyer, R. “Sustainable value

pp. 496-512. The authors sincerely apologize for this.

1. Introduction
A recent McKinsey poll of 7,751 consumers in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
India, the UK, and the USA shows 87 percent of the respondents are very concerned
about the environmental and social impact of the products they buy (Bonini and
Oppenheim, 2008). Interestingly, this survey suggests that when it comes to actually
buying green goods, words and deeds often part away as no more than one third of the
consumers in the survey are ready to buy green products or already done so.

A number of early studies attempted to establish the relationship between corporate
social responsibility (CSR) and ﬁrm performance but found inconclusive results
(Alexander and Buchholz, 1978; Shane and Spicer, 1983; Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullmann,
1985). Moreover, many researchers have even found in their studies only a negative
relationship between CSR and ﬁrm performance (Shane and Spicer, 1983; Aupperle
et al., 1985; Davidson and Worrel, 1988; Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Brammer et al.,
2005; Becchetti et al., 2007). These results are not only discouraging but also deter ﬁrms
from devoting their efforts to the development of socially responsible initiatives, such
as the development of environmental sustainability. However, such discouraging
results may be due to the measurements used in these studies.

A number of measures to assess corporate contributions to society have been
proposed over the past, namely the reputation index, content analysis of company
publications, and more recently, some published social indices. Some researchers use
the reputation index (Moskowitz, 1972; Fogler and Nutt, 1975; Sturdivant and Ginter,
1977; Spicer, 1978). Other studies use content analysis to analyze the reporting in
various ﬁrm publications, especially in the annual reports (Bowman and Haire, 1975;
Ingram, 1978). More recently, several important indices, such as the Domini 400 Social
Index, the FTSE4Good Index Series, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index have been
adopted (Aslaksen and Synnestvedt, 2003; Cowton, 2004; Schro¨der, 2007; Collison et al.,
2008) in measuring ﬁrm social performance. These indices only consider ﬁrms that are
committed to environmental or social actions, and thus ﬁlter out ﬁrms that are
connected with some speciﬁc industries, such as the tobacco and alcohol industries.

Corporate governance, stakeholder interests, social impression, and environmental
protection are all facets of CSR. In this article, we focus on ﬁrm environmental
performance and its relationship to ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance. To this end, suitable
measures of environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance are needed. This
study adopts several readily available commonly used measures of ﬁnancial
performance. As to the environmental performance measures, sustainability value (SV)
by ADVANCE (2006) is used because it not only considers a ﬁrm’s damage to the

environment, but also how efﬁciently the ﬁrm creates value from natural resources. It
is worth noting that companies use not only economic capital but also environmental
and social resources to produce goods or provide services. Thus, the resource use
efﬁciency of
in measuring ﬁrm
environmental performance. Another reason for the adoption of SV is its intuitive
meaning to management and other stakeholders. The aforementioned measurements
as well as other measurements used in related research all adopt nominal scale
variables, which cannot capture the dynamic nature of the ﬁrm’s efforts in social
responsibility. The SV shows in monetary terms the value that a company creates or
loses resulting from the use of a set of various resources (e.g. CO2, NOx, SOx, VOC, and
CH4 emissions, waste generated, and water used). This makes it easier to determine the
cost of resources in monetary terms and enables us to take the dynamic changes of
ﬁrms’ environmental sustainability into consideration. Thus, following Figge and
Hahn (2004), this study uses sustainable value to measure the ﬁrms’ dynamic effort
and outcome of green management.

The purposes of the present study is twofold: ﬁrst, to explore whether a linkage
between environmental effects and ﬁnancial performance exists; second, to investigate
whether ﬁrms with more environmental efforts show a more signiﬁcantly positive
relationship between environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance than those
with less green efforts. Data from a wide variety of industries comprised of 51
European companies were collected to investigate the relationship between ﬁrm
environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance. The results of this study may
lead to a better understanding of the relationship between ﬁrm environmental
performance and ﬁnancial performance, as well as provide an appropriate explanation
for this relationship, if any. More speciﬁcally, this paper may be able to answer the
question why some companies suffer from acting green.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two brieﬂy reviews the
previous literature on CSR, environmental performance and its tie to ﬁnancial
performance, and the measures adopted in related literature and this study. Section
three presents an overview of our data and methodology. Section four presents
empirical results and Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Literature review
Corporate social responsibility was regarded as “the managerial obligation to take
action to protect and improve both the welfare of society as a whole and the interest of
organizations” (Davis and Blomstrom, 1975). In the last few decades, the relationship
between corporate social performance (CSP) and ﬁnancial performance has attracted
increasing attention in academia as well as in industry. However, the link between CSP
and ﬁnancial performance is still ambiguous at best (Stanwick and Stanwick, 1998).
Pava and Krausz (1996) reviewed 21 studies conducted between 1972 and 1992 and
conclude that 12 of them show a positive association between CSP and ﬁnancial
performance, one demonstrates negative association, and eight show that no
association exists.

A number of studies show a negative relationship between CSP and ﬁnancial
performance (Shane and Spicer, 1983; Aupperle et al., 1985; Davidson and Worrel, 1988;
Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Brammer et al., 2005; Becchetti et al., 2007). One possible
explanation is that companies acting in a socially responsible manner may incur
competitive disadvantages that may otherwise be avoided (Aupperle et al., 1985). This

is consistent with Friedman’s (1970) view that there are few measurable beneﬁts to
socially responsible behavior while there are numerous costs that reduce corporate
proﬁts and shareholder wealth. On the other hand, a number of studies show that there
is a positive relationship between CSP and ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance (Belkaoui, 1976;
Bowman, 1978; Preston, 1978; Wokutch and Spencer, 1987). These inconsistent
empirical results lead to another possibility that there is simply no positive or negative
relationship between social and ﬁnancial performance. Ullmann (1985) argues that
there are many intervening variables between social and ﬁnancial performance and
thus one should not expect a relationship to exist. In addition, the contradicting results
may be due to the method in which the social performance variables are used in those
studies. Such measurement problems may have masked possible linkages, if any,
between CSR and ﬁnancial performance.

Although attempts to establish a linkage between CSP and ﬁnancial performance
have yield mixed results, a number of researchers have found a positive relationship
between ﬁrm environmental performance, a critical component of CSP, and ﬁnancial
performance (King and Lenox, 2008). According to Wood (1991), CSP is comprised of
three major components: the level of corporate social responsibility, the processes of
corporate social responsiveness, and the outcomes of corporate behavior. Based on
Wood’s principles of corporate social responsibility, Stanwick and Stanwick (1998)
argue that the environmental performance of an organization is one of the critical
components in the measurement of CSP. The environmental performance of a ﬁrm may
also be regarded as the output of the ﬁrm’s green effort.

Various measures are adopted in prior studies that try to explore the relationship
between ﬁrm environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance. Tobin’s q (Dowell
et al., 2000), return on assets (Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997), return on
equity (Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997), and return on investment (Hart
and Ahuja, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997) are commonly used to measure the ﬁnancial
performance of an organization. Capital expenditures on pollution control technology
(Spicer, 1978), emissions of toxic chemicals (Hart and Ahuja, 1996), spills and other
plant accidents (Karpoff et al., 1998), lawsuits related to improper disposal of hazardous
waste (Muoghalu et al., 1990), rewards or other recognitions for superior environmental
performance (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996), participation in environmental
management standards (Dowell et al., 2000), and rankings of superior environmental
performers (Russo and Fouts, 1997) are adopted as measurements of environmental
performance. It may be concluded that so far there is no consensus on measures of
environmental performance. For a more complete list of ﬁnancial and environmental
performance measures, readers are referred to King and Lenox (2008). In this study,
another measure, corporate sustainable value, is adopted for the measurement of
corporate environmental performance.

A number of empirical studies revealed that companies with high environmental
performance tend to be more proﬁtable (King and Lenox, 2008). A series of studies
conducted by the Council on Economic Priorities found signiﬁcant correlation between
pollution control expenditures and ﬁnancial performance among pulp and paper ﬁrms
(Spicer, 1978). Russo and Fouts (1997) demonstrated a signiﬁcant positive correlation
between various ﬁnancial returns and an environmental performance index. Clemens
(2006) argued that small ﬁrms beneﬁt from being green. Clarkson et al. (2006) studied
the four most polluting industry in the USA and found that ﬁrms which enjoyed better
environmental performance also enjoyed better subsequent ﬁnancial performance.

King and Lenox (2008) also concluded that environmental performance is positively
associated with ﬁnancial performance. One possible explanation for the positive
association between ﬁrm environmental and ﬁnancial performance is that
environmental effort provides future cost savings by increasing efﬁciency, reducing
compliance costs, and minimizing future liabilities (Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995;
Reinhardt, 1999).

Other research focusing on the market values of green companies also found that
green investment is proﬁtable (Cohen et al., 1995; White, 1996). Dasgupta et al. (1998)
undertook an international event study involving capital markets in Argentina, Chile,
Mexico and Philippines. They concluded that these four countries’ ﬁnancial markets
reward companies having superior environmental performance. Dowell et al. (2000)
concluded that ﬁrms that adopt a single, stringent environmental standard worldwide
tend to have higher market valuations. Butz and Plattner (2000) examined 65 European
securities over a two-year period. They found that the market rewarded those companies
with better environmental performance. More recently, Lo and Sheu (2007) found that
the Tobin’s q of US companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index are greater than
those of non-Sustainable companies. Using common asset pricing models, Ziegler et al.
(2007) found that European stocks are rewarded for better environmental performance.
On the contrary, some recent studies presented different results. In a study using
unbalanced panel data of Czech ﬁrms, Hassel et al. (2005) found that environmental
performance actually hurts ﬁnancial performance by imposing a negative impact on
ﬁrm’s market value. Darnall and Ytterhus (2005) suggested that no statistically
signiﬁcant relationship exists between environmental and ﬁnancial performance. In a
study based on a panel data of Norwegian plants, Telle (2006) found that, after
controlling for omitted plant heterogeneity, much of the previously observed positive
relationship between better environmental and ﬁnancial performance disappeared.

3. Methodology
The EU has long been regarded as the most environmentally conscious region in the
world and a leader in environmental governance. Consequently, the EU has adopted
the most stringent environmental policies and regulations in the world. Therefore, EU
ﬁrms are selected as the subjects of this study. Our sample consists of 65 European
companies included in The ADVANCE Project (2006) funded by the EU and
participating corporations. The project reports the value-based eco-ratings and
relevant data of these 65 European companies from 2001 to 2003. Considering the lag
effect on ﬁrm performance, ﬁnancial performance data of these ﬁrms is collected by the
authors from their annual reports from 2001 to 2007. A total of 14 ﬁrms are dropped
from the sample due to the unavailability of their annual reports. Tables I and II
display the ﬁnal sample distribution. The ﬁnal sample used in our analysis comprises
51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries. A Chi-square test is
performed to verify whether dropping ﬁrms from the original sample alters the sample
distribution. The Chi-square statistics are 14.12 and 4.30 for the country and industry,
respectively (with p-values of 0.52 and 1.00 respectively), which indicates that there is
no signiﬁcant difference in country distribution or industry distribution between the
ﬁnal sample used in this study and the sample of the ADVANCE Project.

Companies from Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden contribute more
than 60 percent of the sample ﬁrms. Nearly 20 percent of the sample ﬁrms belong to the
utility sector. Most of the sample companies (around 86.27 percent) belong to the

carbon-intensive sector according to the classiﬁcation of the Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP) (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2008).

Using data from the ADVANCE Project, three proxies, including sustainable value,
sustainable value margin, and return to cost ratio are adopted to capture the green
management efforts of the companies. Readers are encouraged to refer to the project
source for details. From an opportunity cost perspective, sustainable value represents
the value that is created or lost through the use of a set of different resources by a
company. Seven environmental resources are taken into account:

(1) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions;
(2) nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions;
(3) sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions;
(4) emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC);
(5) methane (CH4) emissions;
(6) waste generation; and
(7) water use.

Five steps are used in calculating sustainable value:

(1) How much of a resource does the company use?
(2) How much return does the company create with these resources?
(3) How much return would the benchmark create with these resources?
(4) Which resources are used in a value-creating way by the company and which

are not?

(5) How much sustainable value does the company create?

The EU15[1]
is used as the benchmark. Sustainable value has been applied to
economic, environmental, and social resources and has been practiced in the ﬁnancial
markets for many decades. Usually, large companies are expected to have larger
sustainable value ﬁgures. Therefore, considering the size effect, two indicators are
used:

(1) sustainable value margin; and
(2) return to cost ratio.

The sustainable value margin is calculated by dividing sustainable value by sales,
which is constructed similarly to the sales margin. It reﬂects how much sustainable
value is created per e100 of sales that the company makes. The return to cost ratio
compares the gross value added to a company to the return the benchmark would have
created with the same amount of resources (opportunity costs), which is a typical
beneﬁt-cost-ratio. A return to cost ratio larger (smaller) than unity indicates that the
company yields more (less) return per unit of resource, i.e. the company uses its bundle
of resources more (less) efﬁciently than the EU15 on average – the company creates
sustainable value.

Four ﬁnancial performance measures are used in our study. EBIT/Assets – the
textbook measure of proﬁtability relative to total capital employed by the ﬁrm – is
used to measure ﬁrm performance, and has been commonly employed in previous
studies (Denis and Denis, 1995; Eberhart et al., 2004; Huson et al., 2004). Other
accounting performance measures: earnings per share (EPS), returns on assets (ROA),
and returns on equity (ROE) are also used in the analysis.

Correlation analysis (both Pearson correlation and Spearman’s rho) is applied to
capture the possible relationship between environmental performance (e.g. sustainable
value) and ﬁnancial performance.

characteristics may inﬂuence the analysis,
further analyses are performed on
subsamples of the carbon-intensive sector, good performers in return to cost ratio and
bad performers in return to cost ratio, respectively.

than the EU15 on average, while with a return to cost ratio of 1:1.89 uses its resources
only about half as efﬁciently as the benchmark. The sustainable value margin is
spread widely, with substantially different values for mean and median (2 138.70 and
2 24.70) and a large standard deviation (327.50). The sustainable value and EPS show
similar patterns, which may be due to that data being collected from a wide variety of
countries and industries.

Tables IV-V demonstrate the correlation coefﬁcients of green measures and
ﬁnancial performance. Panel A (Table IV) shows the coefﬁcients of both Pearson
correlation and Spearman’s rho based on the full sample. The Pearson correlation of
the sustainable value and EBIT/Assets is signiﬁcantly negative. However, since the
sustainable value does not take the ﬁrm size into account, the sustainable value margin
may be a more appropriate measure than sustainable value. It can be seen that the
correlation coefﬁcient of sustainable value margin and EBIT/Assets is insigniﬁcant.
The remaining Pearson correlations and all Spearman’s rho are all insigniﬁcant. The
results reveal that there is no relation between ﬁrm environmental performance and
ﬁnancial performance. Considering the possible lag effect on ﬁnancial performance, the

authors also compute one-year to four-year lag effects of environmental efforts using
the ﬁnancial performance data during the periods of 2002 to 2004, 2003 to 2005, 2004 to
2006, and 2005 to 2007[2], respectively. The results are not included in Tables IV and V
since they are similar to those without considering the lag effect.
Taking the nature of industry into account, Panel B (Table IV) displays the correlation
coefﬁcients for carbon-intensive sectors. Not surprisingly, the result is similar to Panel
A since the carbon-intensive sectors take up a large portion of the full sample. The
empirical results suggest that a signiﬁcant relationship between ﬁrm environmental
performance and ﬁnancial performance is not found within the carbon-intensive sector.
In Panel C of Table V, the authors further investigate whether the green effort of the
sample ﬁrms inﬂuences the relationship between ﬁrm environmental performance and
ﬁnancial performance. Firms that make progress in green measures may have found
their way in green management, and thus a positive relationship between
environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance among those ﬁrms is
expected. By deﬁnition, the return to cost ratio shows the factor by which a
company uses it resources more or less efﬁciently than the benchmark, EU15. The
return to cost ratio comprises two concepts:

(1) greenhouse gas emissions, waste generated, and water use efﬁciency; and
(2)

the comparison with the EU15.

Thus, to determine whether the ﬁrms make progress, we measure the difference in the
return to cost ratio from the present year to the previous year. By doing so, 36
observations are categorized as making progress and another 42 observations as
getting worse. The rest of the observations maintain the same level of the return to cost
ratio.

The results for good performers and bad performers in return to cost ratio are both
insigniﬁcant which is consistent with the previous Panels. In other words, no matter
whether the ﬁrm makes progress or regress in green measures, a relationship between
its environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance cannot be found.

5. Conclusions
The current study attempted to identify whether the good-heartedness of ﬁrms meet
with recompense based on data from 51 European companies of 14 industries across 15
countries. The research ﬁndings in this study suggest that corporate good guys do not
necessarily reap the rewards of their green efforts. The ﬁnding applies to both the full
sample and the carbon-intensive sectors. The result of this study also suggests that
green efforts may not be the reason why some companies are suffering. Simply put,
acting green may have nothing to do with the underperformance of these companies.
There may be other issues associated with these companies that cause their
underperformance.

This paper uses a new measure for ﬁrm environmental performance which takes
into account the efﬁciency of resource use by companies. In this paper, we adopt the
eco-efﬁciency concept to construct a broader measure of environmental performance.
Although the relationship between ﬁrm environmental performance and ﬁnancial
performance could not be found in this study, we believe that environmental
performance should not be measured solely on the damage done to the environment.
While a relationship between ﬁrm environmental performance and ﬁnancial

Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:28 03 February 2017 (PT)
performance could not be found, managers and researchers may still beneﬁt from this
study.

Implications for practitioners
Caution must be taken in interpreting the results of this study. Although we could not
ﬁnd an association between environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance,
previous studies suggested that environmental performance may be positively
associated with other corporate performance measures, such as market value (Dowell
et al., 2000). In addition, being perceived as a green company may improve a company’s
image and reputation, thus attract more talented workers and green-conscious
customers. In this regard, ﬁrms may not only need to act green, but also want to
promote their efforts in environmental
issues. They may start with including
environmental performance in the annual report and other ﬁlings, and be more
forthcoming on environmental exposure and performance. Nevertheless, since there is
no evidence that environmental investment deteriorates ﬁnancial performance; ﬁrms
are encouraged to take the high road toward environmental sustainability. At least, the
impact associated with environmental risks may be reduced. Thus,

investment would do most

Although the samples are taken from European companies, ﬁrms in other region of
the world may still beneﬁt from this research. Since environmental sustainability is a
global issue, sooner or later, the stringent environmental regulations currently been
reinforced in EU countries will be adopted or adapted in other parts of the world. The
truth is that when the stringent global environmental standards are applied to most
countries, ﬁrms will be able to realize the beneﬁts resulted from their green efforts, if
not earlier.

Implications for researchers
This study was a ﬁrst attempt to incorporate resource efﬁciency into the measurement
of environmental performance in studying the possible linkage between environmental
performance and ﬁnancial performance. Our study was constrained by data
availability. Future research may build on this research and supplement the current
data with more variables, such as more nature resources, ﬁrm characteristics, and a
longer time series. Industry level and ﬁrm level analyzes may also be beneﬁcial when
more company data becomes available.

The sustainable value adopted in this research considers only the efﬁciency of water
use, in addition to several environmental damage measures. Other natural resources,
such as forest, cropland, energy sources, may need to be taken into account to form a
more comprehensive measure for natural resource efﬁciency. In addition, although we
consider company attributes such as whether a ﬁrm belongs to the carbon-extensive
sector and found no evidence to support the relationship between environmental and
ﬁnancial performance, possible confounding effects from other ﬁxed ﬁrm attributes
could not be ruled out. On the other hand, it may be that only ﬁrms with certain
attributes can reap the beneﬁts from acting green. Accordingly, “When does a
company beneﬁt/suffer from acting green?” may be an interesting question to explore
as suggested by (King and Lenox, 2008).

Future research may investigate the relationship between ﬁrm environmental
performance and ﬁnancial performance across industries with different technologies

and product life cycles, or industries with similar pollutions/emissions or usage pattern
of natural resources, such as the petroleum industry and the transportation industry.
Finally, we did not consider the effect of causality since a relationship between
environmental performance and ﬁnancial gains could not be found. Even when such an
association is found, which way the relationship run still need to be determined. Do
ﬁrms more proﬁtable invest more in environmental efforts? Or does environmental
performance lead to better ﬁnancial performance? These are important questions that
require further in-depth studies.

To sum up, while ﬁrms of all types around the world are launching green
campaigns, the truth is that going green while keeping competitive can be quite
challenging (Bonini and Oppenheim, 2008). It is critical for a ﬁrm to convince that
corporations can reap a number of potential beneﬁts by going green in the long run.
The ﬁnding of this paper may not be enough to convince the executives from the
perspective of ﬁnancial performance. However, the spillover effect of being greenness
should not be neglected. In addition to the enhancement of ﬁnancial performance, to
name a few, a ﬁrm that establishes a reputation for greenness can do much more than
increase its sales. The better its reputation, the more talented the workers it can attract,
the more loyalty it can strengthen in its customers, the more it can charge for its
product. How environmental efforts might change the reputation, employee
recruitment, and the product price remains a topic for future research.
