Abstract
Purpose – The role of supply managers in driving corporate performance is changing, with an increased
emphasis on supply market intelligence, collaboration, inter-organizational partnerships, and operational
integration with supply partners. These traits are also mirrored in the research on entrepreneurial settings
and ﬁrms. The purpose of this paper is to explore the parallels between supply management roles, and the
entrepreneurial skill sets and mechanisms that have been identiﬁed in prior research.
Design/methodology/approach – A structural equation model, using a sample of 151
manufacturing and service ﬁrms based in the UK, tests this hypothesised model.
Findings – The theoretical framework was supported, with results indicating that entrepreneurial
behaviours (supply market intelligence and supply management inﬂuence) contribute to integration
within the ﬁrm and with suppliers, in order to drive performance improvement.
Practical implications – The results provide support for purchasing managers seeking to improve
performance by changing the recruitment and culture of the supply management function toward an
entrepreneurial orientation.
Originality/value – Although the application of organizational entrepreneurship thinking to supply
management theory is nascent, this paper’s results suggest that further research along these lines may
provide a resilient platform for utilisation of entrepreneurial constructs to explain supply management
principles in buyer-supplier collaboration, relational capital, and organisational outcomes.

Introduction
In the current globally competitive environment, many ﬁrms are turning to supply
management as a core strategic competence that creates competitive advantage. Firms
with proactive and world-class supply management programs are differentiated by

intelligence,

hybrid governance structures, where supply managers work closely with business
stakeholders to scan the supply market, collect market
identify
opportunities to integrate suppliers with internal requirements, deliver value-added
initiatives to create value, and ensure on-going collaboration with key supplier
partners (Cousins et al., 2006b; Liker and Choi, 2004). In spite of these improvements, in
many ﬁrms supply management (or purchasing as it has been called in the past)
remains largely a support function, with little strategic value other than transactional
efﬁciency and cost reduction through “hardnosed” negotiations (Handﬁeld, 2006; Liker
and Choi, 2004). More recently, the value of supply management as a key contributor to
competitive advantage through critical market intelligence, strategic sourcing, and
supplier relationship management has been empirically identiﬁed (Cousins et al.,
2006b; Krause et al., 1998; Liker and Choi, 2004). Recent research also calls on supply
managers to become more proactive in seeking out global sourcing opportunities,
identifying new technologies, and introducing these insights into the organization for
adoption (Giunipero et al., 2008).

These qualities sound very familiar to researchers of corporate entrepreneurship,
and indeed, many of these traits are common characteristics of entrepreneurs. We
explore this linkage further, and seek clarity on whether entrepreneurial roles can be
overlaid onto speciﬁc behaviours associated with strategic supply management in
creating enterprise value. This leads us to an interesting question: do successful supply
management functions behave in an entrepreneurial fashion in managing external
suppliers and internal stakeholder groups? (In this context, we deﬁne supply
management as the process of sourcing goods and services from 1st and 2nd tier
suppliers). While signiﬁcant work has been undertaken in exploring the implications of
entrepreneurial behaviour on ﬁrm market performance (Sarkar et al., 2001a), there is an
increasing interest in the overlap between supply management and entrepreneurship
(Arend and Wisner, 2005; Giunipero et al., 2005; Morris and Calantone, 1991). Our prior
research using the same dataset explored attributes of supply management functions
through cluster analysis (Cousins et al., 2006a).

This line of thinking is explored further through development of a framework that
aligns key entrepreneurial characteristics with attributes of successful supply
management functions. We empirically test a model which posits that the relative
status of supply management and the skill levels of associates in the function lead to
greater internal integration into core business unit strategies. We also explore the impact
on external integration with critical suppliers who provide tacit and spillover effects from
a value chain perspective (Dyer and Chu, 2000; Liker and Choi, 2004; Petersen et al., 2005).

Aligning entrepreneurial and supply management roles
We ﬁrst seek to establish whether there was a parallel between the bodies of literature
in entrepreneurship and supply management. We identify a number of key tenets from
the entrepreneurial literature that is representative of more nascent attributes of supply
managers. We begin with an overview of the entrepreneurship literature, and next
describe speciﬁc attributes of entrepreneurs that align with supply managers.

Entrepreneurship research and theory
The study of entrepreneurship and innovation has a rich and seminal history in
shaping modern management thinking. Early work by Schumpeter (1934) led to

seminal theoretical frameworks for business strategy by Lawrence and Lorsch (1967),
Thompson (1967), Child (1972), Mintzberg (1978), Miller (1983), Miller and Friesen
(1982) and others (Kumar and Seth, 1998; Sarkar et al., 2001a). The primary
contribution of this literature is to establish the key structural and infrastructural
variables associated with innovation in the ﬁrm,
including structural elements
(centralization of authority, organizational resources, differentiation, and integration)
(Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; Rogers and Schoemaker, 1971; Thompson, 1969), as well
as decision-making elements (scanning and control systems, planning horizons, and
consciousness of strategy and conceptualization) (Ansoff, 1965; Cyert and March, 1963;
Miles and Snow, 1978; Miller and Friesen, 1978; Mintzberg, 1973).

One fundamental thread running through this literature is that entrepreneurship is
not associated with a dominant organizational personality (e.g. an independent-minded
owner-manager), but is determined more by the entrepreneurial activity of the ﬁrm
(Miller and Friesen, 1983). As organizations become more complex and are confronted
with increasingly difﬁcult challenges associated with globalization, technology, risk
management, and driving innovation,
the entrepreneurial role emphasized by
Schumpeter (1934) becomes more important than ever. The focus of this line of
thinking is not so much the critical actor (Miller and Friesen, 1983), but the
entrepreneurial management process associated with innovation and management
dynamics is of interest. Recent research by Sorensen (2007) also identiﬁes that larger
ﬁrms with bureaucratic work structures may hinder development of the skills required
for entrepreneurship. Further, this research suggests that people who work for larger,
older ﬁrms are less likely to display entrepreneurial behaviour (Sorensen, 2007).

Are entrepreneurial skills applicable to supply managers?
Entrepreneurial behaviour is held to be vital for ﬁrms of all sizes to prosper in
competitive environments (Covin and Slevin, 1988; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Zahra,
1993). However, the speciﬁc elements that are applicable to supply management
functions are shown in Table I, and are discussed next in more detail.

The supply management literature is nascent in its development of key theoretical
elements (Das and Handﬁeld, 1997), especially in the application of corporate
entrepreneurship theory. Notwithstanding, recent research has begun to explore the
need for entrepreneurial behaviours in supply management and supply networks (Arend
and Wisner, 2005; Giunipero et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2006). In a survey of purchasing
professionals, Morris and Calantone (1991) asked respondents to identify traits of the
entrepreneurial organization. Key traits of an entrepreneurial organization included:
strong leadership at the top, willingness to pursue risks, hands-on management, closeness
to the customer, and aggressiveness in the marketplace. Morris and Calantone’s work was
followed by the work of Giunipero (2005), Arend and Wisner (2005), Hult et al. (2003),
Gonzalez-Padron et al. (2008) and Ireland and Webb (2007). The latter point out that an
entrepreneurial orientation leads to more adaptation decisions, allowing supply chains to
respond to market opportunities efﬁciently with ﬂexibility and agility. These attributes
align strongly with four common properties associated with mature supply management
organizations, characterized by the following (Cousins et al., 2008; Handﬁeld, 2006; Liker
and Choi, 2004; Monczka et al., 2008):

(1) supply market research and intelligence;
(2) supplier integration;

(3) cross-enterprise integration; and
(4) supply management inﬂuence.

Each of these elements is described below.

“opportunity identiﬁcation”, or

Supply market intelligence
The entrepreneurship research signals that entrepreneurs identify needs and
opportunities, just as many supply managers are increasingly being asked to do.
This attribute has been identiﬁed in a variety of works, and is referred to as either
“environmental scanning”,
“entrepreneurial
orientation” (Table I). Similarly, supply managers must also be in a “scanning”
mode to identify opportunities that may exist in supply markets and then bring them
to the attention of internal decision-makers (Handﬁeld, 2006). Prior research (Table I)
establish that market intelligence is an important requirement for innovative supply
chains that combine developments in information and related technologies to improve
operational efﬁciency, enhance service effectiveness, reduce cost, and increase
customer satisfaction (Gonzalez-Padron et al., 2008; Hult and Swan, 2003). The supply
management organization of the future must embrace these concepts to enhance
performance with fewer resources and heightened expectations.

Supplier integration
This evolution of supply management relies on the fact that managers have the core
skills, knowledge, capabilities, management authority, and systems required to not only
identify opportunities, but also to act on them (Handﬁeld, 2006). In this sense, these
actions are similar to the entrepreneurial themes of network and relational capabilities,
described in Table I. At the core of the supply management renaissance is the
proposition that when ﬁrms invest in joint, relationship-speciﬁc assets, engage in
knowledge exchange, and combine resources through governance mechanisms, a
supernormal proﬁt can be derived on the part of both exchange parties. A theoretical
term for this beneﬁt is “relational rent” (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Entrepreneurs are
similarly able to manage networks and alliances, which comprise coordination,
relational skills, market knowledge, and internal communication (Walter et al., 2006).
The relational view of the ﬁrm suggests that buying and supplying ﬁrms systematically
share valuable know-how with each other and make relationship-speciﬁc investments in
return for access to proﬁt from rents generated through collaborative working
arrangements. The vehicle for creating this form of value is through a process known as
strategic sourcing (Handﬁeld, 2006; Liker and Choi, 2004). Strategic sourcing involves
the application of market intelligence to the creation of a supply market portfolio, and the
execution of focused supply market strategies (e.g. leveraging, e-procurement, strategic
alliances) based on opportunity and market characteristics.

Cross-enterprise integration
Once an opportunity is identiﬁed, supply managers need to nurture and manage the
relationship between the ﬁrm and the supplier. This requires close coordination and
integration at many levels. First, supply managers must establish stakeholder
requirements in product and process design and effectively communicate this
information to key suppliers in the form of speciﬁcations, statements of work, and
customer requirements (Cousins et al., 2006b). Second, the sourcing manager must be able

to bring new innovative ideas from suppliers and introduce them to key product
platform design teams for consideration (Cousins et al., 2006b; Hult et al., 2002; Monczka
et al., 2000).

These capabilities have been identiﬁed in many forms in the entrepreneurial
literature. The ability to bring external
information into the ﬁrm was labelled
proactiveness (shaping the environment by introducing new products, technologies,
and administrative techniques into the ﬁrm). This approach involves seizing new
opportunities in the environment and taking preemptive action in response to
perceived opportunity (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Miller and Friesen, 1978). The second
form of boundary spanning, involving taking stakeholder requirements to the supply
market,
is opportunity identiﬁcation (dense communications and administrative
systems across the boundaries of the ﬁrm that drives decision making (Larson, 1992).
Gonzalez-Padron et al. (2008) also show that entrepreneurial innovation affects the
quality of relationships among sourcing participants as well as cycle-time.

Supply management inﬂuence
The ﬁnal characteristic of interest is the ability of the supply management function to
be “taken seriously” within the ﬁrm. This is largely a function of their ability to build a
solid business case around their approach, the ability to inﬂuence key decision makers,
and the level of business acumen within the sourcing function (Giunipero et al., 2004;
Ward et al., 2007). We ﬁnd that
importance in the
entrepreneurial literature as well. Moreover, entrepreneurial ﬁrms have a strong locus
of planning, deﬁned as the use of integrative devices such as committees, task forces,
and integrative personnel to bring important facts to bear upon decisions (Miller and
Friesen, 1983). This capability ensures the active participation of mid-level managers
in the process (Barringer and Bluedorn, 1999). Second, the importance of inﬂuencing
executive managers through greater ﬂexibility and tolerance of risk is important.
Supply managers must be able to manage paradoxes and contradictions between
strategic objectives (Giunipero et al., 2005; Timmons, 1994), yet effectively build a
business case for change with senior executive leaders.

this characteristic is of

Using these key attributes of entrepreneurial behaviour, we next build a model

which identiﬁes the relationship among these parameters (Figure 1).

Application of the entrepreneurial model to supply management
Our application of entrepreneurial characteristics to the critical elements required for
an effective strategic sourcing initiative is based on prior research in this area which
reveals some very clear direct parallels in roles and responsibilities. We developed a
survey to test an integrative model that combined these insights (Figure 1). These are
represented in the following set of six hypotheses below, which are built on parallel
relationships identiﬁed in both the entrepreneurship and supply management
literature.

H1a, H1b – conditions to build
Prior researchers noted that a key attribute common to entrepreneurs is environmental
scanning, which refers to the managerial activity of learning about events and trends
in the organization’s environment (Hambrick, 1981). The philosophical roots of the
scanning concept date back to the ancient Greeks, who believed that success in combat

was dependent upon adequate intelligence for the purpose of making good tactical and
strategic decisions (Box, 1991). Scanning provides managers with information about
events and trends in their relevant environments, which facilitates opportunity
recognition (Bluedorn et al., 1994). More recently, this has been identiﬁed as one of the
elements required for network formation in entrepreneurial settings. Larson (1992)
highlights the importance of reputation, trust, reciprocity, and mutual interdependence
for network structures in entrepreneurial settings, and examines how control
is
exercised in these settings. Speciﬁcally, Larson identiﬁes the pre-conditions for
exchange, conditions to build, and integration and control mechanisms as a process for
network formation. An entrepreneurial orientation also has been shown to allow
supply chains to respond to market opportunities efﬁciently with ﬂexibility and agility
(Gonzalez-Padron et al., 2008; Hult et al., 2002, 2003).

We emphasize the latter two elements in our model shown in Figure 1. Conditions to
build refer to the need for mutual economic advantage, a trial period, and the role of one
ﬁrm as an initiator for the engagement (Larson, 1992). The engagement is further
dependent on the prior set of “pre-conditions for exchange”, namely the rules and
procedures, clear expectations, reciprocity, and trust.

Our model similarly anticipates the need for an entrepreneurial orientation in
scanning the market for opportunities as a predecessor for mutual exchange ((Miller
and Friesen, 1983; Zahra, 1991) which fosters innovation, risk-taking, and proactive
behaviour (Covin, 1991). A critical input into the seven-step strategic sourcing process
is the development of critical insights into current supply market conditions, including
pricing, capacity, emerging supplier capabilities, offshore suppliers, low-cost country
sourcing conditions, socioeconomic impacts on market requirements, and mergers and
acquisitions impacting supply market conditions (Handﬁeld, 2006). The impact of
major disruptions in supply has been found to lead to losses of up to 20 per cent in ﬁrm
shareholder value (Hendricks and Singhal, 2003). The recent rise in commodity prices
led ﬁrms to recognize the need for a scanning capability which allows supply
managers to impact internal resource allocations, planning decisions, and new product

and process development strategic planning processes. The impact of supply market
knowledge on internal strategic planning is expressed in the ﬁrst hypothesis:

H1a. Supply market

intelligence is associated with increased levels of

cross-enterprise integration.

A second condition for network formation identiﬁed by Larson (1992) is the ability to
facilitate and develop strong relationships with suppliers, to pursue sources of product
design knowledge, cost savings opportunities, and regular communication. Such
dialogues build trust and mutual expectations that form the foundation for further
development of the relationship. The entrepreneurial orientation perspective also
suggests that entrepreneurial innovation enables ﬁrms to predict what the market may
become, and that this is often associated with a strong learning orientation where the
ﬁrm is not likely to miss opportunities created by the market (Calantone et al., 2002;
Gonzalez-Padron et al., 2008). This knowledge exchange, and investment
in
relationship-speciﬁc assets is argued to take place under conditions where the
expected value of the combined inﬂows of knowledge and investment exceeds the
expected loss/erosion of advantages due to knowledge spill-overs to competitors (Dyer
and Singh, 1998; Osborn and Hagedoorn, 1997). As such, the tacit nature of tacit
information from external sources, facilitated through identiﬁcation of external
resources via external market intelligence, forms the basis for our second hypothesis:

H1b. Supply market intelligence is associated with increased levels of supplier

integration.

Supply management inﬂuence
The second set of hypotheses associated with our research relates to the need for
integration and control (Larson, 1992), the ﬁnal element in “closing the loop” in
entrepreneurial alliances. Integration and control refers to:

. operational

integration to enhance communication and connect

the

administrative apparatus of each ﬁrm;
strategic interdependence and the ability to control and shape behaviour; and
integration and control through social relations or social control.

.

.

In each case,
integration is created through heightening the ability to inﬂuence
outcomes through operational and social interaction. Inﬂuence also relates to the
concept of locus of planning, which refers to the depth of employee involvement in a
ﬁrm’s strategic planning activities. A deep locus of planning denotes a high level of
employee involvement in the planning process, which is akin to the Japanese-style of
team oriented planning (Reid, 1989).

The importance of supply management inﬂuence on strategic decisions thus
mirrors much of the entrepreneurial literature, whereby the application of integrative
devices such as committees, task forces, and integrative personnel brings importance
facts about the supply base to bear upon decisions (Miller and Friesen, 1983).
Moreover, a deep locus of supply planning legitimizes the active participation of middle
and lower-level supply managers in the planning process (Barringer and Bluedorn,
1999). As a function, entrepreneurship may drive an increased market orientation,
which promotes organizational
learning and drives increased performance

(Hult et al., 2003). This maximizes the diversity of viewpoints and provides a deeper
and more diverse mix of views in the strategic planning process (Dutton and Duncan,
1987; Judge and Ziethaml, 1992). A positive relationship was found to exist between a
deep locus of planning and corporate entrepreneurship intensity (Barringer and
Bluedorn, 1999), leading us to posit that the same impact would apply to supply market
locus of planning and internal strategic planning processes (Giunipero et al., 2005;
Morris and Calantone, 1991):

H2a. Supply management

inﬂuence is associated with increased levels of

cross-enterprise Integration.

The entrepreneurial
literature emphasizes how complex relational and learning
processes that depend on external social networks are critical in acquiring specialized
skills (Powell et al., 1996; Sarkar et al., 2001b). In a parallel manner, we extrapolate this
relationship to posit that as supply management builds credibility as a value-added
resource into the strategic planning process, they may gain greater credibility with
external suppliers (Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Monczka et al., 2000, 1998). These network
capabilities rely on supply management’s ability for coordination, relational skills,
market knowledge, and internal communication (Walter et al., 2006):

H2b. Supply management inﬂuence is associated with increased levels of supplier

integration.

Cross-enterprise relationships drive cross-boundary integration
As noted earlier, proactiveness is one facet of the multidimensional concept of
entrepreneurship (Covin and Slevin, 1989)
that we have embodied in our
conceptualization of cross-enterprise integration. The proactive approach is
associated with shaping the environment by introducing new products, technologies,
and administrative techniques into the ﬁrm (Miller and Friesen, 1978). As Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) explain, a proactive ﬁrm seizes new opportunities and seeks to take
preemptive action to exploit them (Venkatraman, 1989). To some extent, this occurs
when boundary spanners offer transparency to decision makers, thereby inﬂuencing the
entrepreneurial and learning actions within the supply chain (Ireland and Webb, 2007).
The decision-making process that exists within entrepreneurial ﬁrms is an
important element
that can be extended here to cover supply management
situations (Morris and Calantone, 1991). Moreover, as Miller and Friesen (1982, p. 5)
point out:

Given that the organization gathers the appropriate information about the environment and
about organizational performance through its scanning and control systems, and given that
this information is communicated to appropriate decision makers, it is still necessary for this
information to be used and evaluated by executives charged with making key decision.

These early pioneers of entrepreneurship thinking pointed to the length or planning
horizon of decisions (futurity), as well as the consciousness of strategy and degree of
conceptualization (Miles and Snow, 1978; Miller and Friesen, 1978; Mintzberg, 1973).
The extent to which ﬁrms seize external opportunities and act on them is also a function
of the extent to which key individuals from these sources are integrated into enterprise
strategic planning decisions (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Miller and Friesen, 1978).


IJOPM
29,2

110

This situation can be extended to the product design process. While supply
managers may play an important perceived role in product design teams, the net
impact of whether these decisions are acted upon can only be measured when suppliers
are actually brought to the table and participate in the team (Petersen et al., 2005). In the
words of one manager we interviewed, “our engineering team is not willing to listen to
suppliers’ input, although we give them plenty of opportunities to do so”. For instance,
engineers have been known to strongly resist any supplier participation on product
development team meetings (Monczka et al., 2000). In a similar manner, supply
managers with a stronger perceived relationship with top management will also have
the necessary business acumen to make a business case and argue for increased
supplier participation in other processes, such as process design, procurement,
production, and increased system integration (Handﬁeld, 2006). Our model posits that
ﬁrms with a stronger cross-enterprise relationship function will be more emboldened to
approach suppliers and involve them in organizational design and production
processes. This is conceptualized in the following hypothesis:

H3. Cross-enterprise integration is associated with increased levels of supplier

integration.

Supply management impact
A wealth of research supports the proposition that entrepreneurial behaviours lead to
improved ﬁrm performance (Hitt et al., 2001) and supply management performance
(Gonzalez-Padron et al., 2008; Hult et al., 2002, 2003). Moreover, a number of arguments
support the idea that alliance-related proactive behaviour creates value for ﬁrms.
A fundamental argument was presented by Porter (1976), who found that proactive
network formation could advantage ﬁrms and enhance their performance by
increasing entry barriers into their strategic groups, and thus reducing the level of
competitive intensity that they are subject to in the subsequent time period. Even in the
face of multiple sources of dynamism (technological, market and competitive) there is
an increased pay-off for ﬁrms that can form links with partners that possess new and
complementary competencies in the supply chain (Duncan, 1972; Hagedoorn, 1993;
Singh, 1997).

These elements are operationalised via a multi-echelon impact in our research
model. That is, supply management does not have a direct impact on enterprise
sourcing performance. However, the primary impact occurs through three value-added
streams:

(1) direct cost savings attributable to reduced cost of goods sold and improved

(2)

bottom-line shareholder impact (Monczka et al., 1998);
increased supplier integration into new product/process/service development
and associated market share improvements (Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Petersen
et al., 2005); and

(3) protection of shareholder value through supply risk management and

avoidance of shareholder value destruction (Hendricks and Singhal, 2003).

In this manner, we posit that supply management’s inﬂuence on internal planning
processes, as well as integration of suppliers into team-based processes, can have a
measurable impact on buyer performance improvements through reduced cycle time,


improved product design, and improved product quality. As suppliers are better
identiﬁed through supply market intelligence, and over a two to three year period
become more closely aligned with focal ﬁrm team processes through supplier
relationship management
liaisons (Handﬁeld, 2006), we posit an associated
improvement in outcomes. These concepts are reﬂected in the following hypotheses:

The ﬁnal element
improved supplier
relationships. Moreover, above-normal returns are obtainable when ﬁrms can create
or exploit imperfections in strategic factor markets (Barney, 1986). Early movers can
preempt resource spaces of various types, including scarce supply capabilities and
tacit knowledge on new product and service technologies (Lieberman and
Montgomery, 1988). In this respect, innovative supply agreements such as those
found in alliances can be effective in providing governance mechanisms that
facilitate the transmittal and coordinate of tacit knowledge ﬂows, which can be
converted into a source of strategic advantage and relational rents, resulting in
improved ﬁnancial performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Madhok and Tallman, 1998).
Key relationship performance indicators are thus posited to result in improved ﬁrm
ﬁnancial outcomes,
in terms of creating shareholder wealth through improved
market share, relational rents, proﬁtability, and growth. This body of theory forms
the basis for our ﬁnal hypothesis:

H6. Sourcing enterprise performance is associated with increased levels of buyer

ﬁnancial performance.

Research design
Sample characteristics
The hypotheses were tested through a survey that collected information about a
ﬁrm’s strategic supply practices. A sample of 800 UK manufacturing ﬁrms was
surveyed, which included ﬁrms from a database provided by The Chartered
Institute of Purchasing & Supply. Each respondent in the sample was selected
based on job function (purchasing manager or equivalent), plant size (at least 100
employees) and industry sector by SIC code. We received 172 responses, of which
21 were deemed not usable due to missing data. The effective response rate was
thus 18.8 per cent
(151/800). This response rate compares favourably with
other similar studies in the area (Carr and Pearson, 2002; Ragatz et al., 2002;
Rosenzweig et al., 2003).

The characteristics of the sample organizations are shown in Table II, including
number of employees, business unit sales and industry sector. The response by
position was managing director (3 per cent), vice president/director (13 per cent),
purchasing manager (52 per cent), senior buyer (8 per cent), and junior manager
(24 per cent). No signiﬁcant mean differences were detected between either of these
groups. The average length of tenure with the company was 10.16 years providing

Questionnaire administration
The survey and a letter explaining the purpose of the research was mailed to senior
purchasing managers. Efforts were made to enhance the response rate by sending an
e-mail containing the survey to managers two weeks after the initial mailing, and by
offering respondents a composite summary of results (Forza, 2002). The survey was
also pilot tested in two phases. The draft questionnaire was ﬁrst sent to four
academics, expert in the area, and four practitioners who were asked to comment on
the content, clarity and scaling of the instruments. A small number of minor changes
were made as a result of this feedback.

Executive interviews
In completing our research, we also conducted eight 30 minute phone interviews with
supply management executives from a variety of different industries (oil and gas,
electronics, medical devices, transportation and logistics, supply chain consulting, and
others). These interviews explored many of the relationships posited in the survey, and
elicited several important insights that were woven into the analysis and discussion
later in the paper.


Non-response bias
Tests for non-response bias were carried out by comparing early respondents
(responses received within the ﬁrst two weeks) and later respondents (responses
received within the third week or later) (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). A t-test of
difference was conducted on ﬁrm size (employees and sales), and mean responses to
each variable. No statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed at p , 0.05.

Operationalisation of variables
The items used to measure the theoretical constructs were derived from an extensive
review of the extant literature. Each item was measured using a seven-point Likert
scale, with the use of practices anchored at “not at all” ( ¼ 1) and “a very great extent”
( ¼ 7). All items used in the questionnaire are reported in the Appendix.

Supply market intelligence used the scales developed by Carr and Smeltzer (2000)
and Carr et al. (2000) to assess the ability of the function to: monitor changes in the
supplier market; the depth of technical capabilities; and the ability to reduce total costs
of business. Supply management inﬂuence was assessed using the scale of Carr and
Smeltzer (2000) who assessed the extent of top management support, importance to
strategy and importance in the eyes of top managers’.

Cross-enterprise integration was assessed using a three-item scale developed by
Narasimhan and Das (2001), examining the extent to which the purchasing function
integrated with other areas in the ﬁrm,
including new product design, process
improvement and strategy-making. Supplier integration was measured using a
three-item scale modiﬁed from Narasimhan and Kim (2002). The items included the
level of information exchange through IT, the level of supplier participation in product
design, as well as procurement and production.

Performance outcomes were assessed as relationship improvement and ﬁnancial
performance. Sourcing enterprise performance was measured using a three-item scale,
adapted from Kotabe et al. (2003), assessing the degree to which the relationship had,
over the past two to three years, resulted in improved product design, product quality
and reduced lead times for the buyer ﬁrm. Financial performance was assessed on the
basis of return on investment, return on sales, and proﬁt growth, as compared to major
competitors (Carr and Pearson, 2002; Carr and Smeltzer, 2000).

Statistical analysis
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling were adopted to
test our proposed theoretical framework. AMOS 6.0 was employed for this purpose
(Arbuckle, 2005). We assessed model ﬁt using four indices: the x2 test; the comparative
ﬁt index (CFI); the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI); and the root-mean-square error of
approximation index (RMSEA). Discussion of these indices may be found in Gerbing
and Anderson (1992), Hu and Bentler (1999), and Marsh et al. (1996). Satisfactory model
ﬁts are indicated by non-signiﬁcant x2 tests, RMSEA values less than or equal to 0.08,
and TLI and CFI values greater than or equal to 0.90.

The statistical analysis of the data was conducted along a number of stages in order
to satisfy requirements for reliability, validity and unidimensionality. First, Harman’s
one-factor test was used to test for potential common method bias (Podsakoff and
Organ, 1986). A principal component factor analysis, with varimax rotation, yielded six
factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and accounted for 68 per cent of the variance.


IJOPM
29,2

114

The ﬁrst factor explained 21 per cent of the variance, and there was no general factor in
the unrotated factor structure, indicating that common methods bias may not be a
serious problem in the data (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).

The items were then validated via CFA. CFA provides a more stringent test of
construct validity and unidimensionality using latent and manifest variables. Each
construct was made scale-variant by ﬁxing one of the loadings in each construct to a
value of 1.0 (Jo¨reskog and So¨rbom, 1993). Each indicator within the measurement
model was then checked for low factor loadings (, 0.40), high residuals (i.e. normalized
residuals . 2.58), and modiﬁcation indices (. 3.84). Table III provides the loadings and
error terms of the manifest variables onto each latent variable.

A number of procedures were followed to assess convergent validity (Bagozzi and
Yi, 1988) and discriminant validity (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988; Fornell and Larcker,
1981). The convergent validity of the scales (extent to which the measurement items
reﬂect a common underlying construct) was supported, with estimated coefﬁcients of
all indicators being signiﬁcant (t . 2.0). The average variance extracted (AVE), which
measures the variance captured by the indicators relative to measurement error, was
also greater than the 0.50 minimum necessary to justify the use of a construct (Hair
et al., 1998). Composite reliability (CR) values were also calculated to provide a further
assessment of internal consistency. A minimum value of 0.70 is recommended, as it
indicates that around 0.50 of the item’s variance (the squared loading) can be attributed
to the construct of interest (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The lowest CR was 0.77 for
cross-enterprise integration, ranging to 0.90 for buyer ﬁnancial performance.

All tests of discriminant validity were similarly supportive. That is, no conﬁdence
intervals of the correlations for the constructs (f values) included 1.0 ( p , 0.05)
(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988), and the square of the intercorrelations between two
constructs, f2, was less than the AVE estimates of the two constructs. This was true
for all pairs of constructs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The inter-item correlations,
Cronbach’s a, CR, and the values of AVE for the constructs operationalised in this
study are shown in Table IV.
The overall ﬁt of the CFA measurement model to the data were satisfactory:
(x2(120) ¼ 203.21, p ¼ 0.00; TLI ¼ 0.93; CFI ¼ 0.94; and RMSEA ¼ 0.068). These
criteria conﬁrm that the constructs tested in our model satisfy the requirements of
unidimensionality. Reliability was also assessed using Cronbach’s a(Cronbach, 1951).
All six constructs retained acceptable coefﬁcient as, with values ranging from 0.76 for
cross-enterprise integration and supplier integration, through to 0.89 for buyer
ﬁnancial performance. Thus,
the research constructs can be
established, and we now proceed to test the structural model.

Empirical testing of hypothesized structural model
The structural model tests the causal paths among the variables of interest. The
structural model was tested with full information maximum likelihood estimation. The
model (Figure 2) is recursive and hence identiﬁed (Bollen, 1989). The ﬁt indices for
the structural model indicate an acceptable ﬁt to the data: (x2(126) ¼ 206.63, p ¼ 0.00;
TLI ¼ 0.93; CFI ¼ 0.94; RMSEA ¼ 0.065).

Discussion
The results of the hypotheses are next discussed and summarized in terms of key
outcomes and impact on theory development. In particular, we emphasize the validity
of applying entrepreneurial characteristics to the ﬁeld of supply management, and
identify opportunities for further research.

H1a, H1b – supply market intelligence
The results provide solid empirical support for the relationship between supply market
intelligence (a key attribute of entrepreneurial orientation) and increased
cross-enterprise relationship integration.
In addition, H1b was also supported,
identifying the role of supply market intelligence on the likelihood of supplier
integration into team-based production and new product development processes.
These results emphasize that the role of supply management is one that introduces and
fosters innovative, risk-taking, and proactive behaviour (Covin, 1991; Kanter, 1988),
which introduces new thinking into internal team-based processes. Entrepreneurial
ﬁrms that can identify and exploit synergistic value-creating opportunities with
supply partners may be advantaged over those who are either unable, or unwilling to
do so (Dyer and Singh, 1998; McEvily and Zaheer, 1999; Sarkar et al., 2001a).


Moreover, the integration of suppliers into teams to provide technical insights,
supply market trends, and insights into pricing and capacity problems, can be
translated into improved product and process development decisions (Handﬁeld, 2006).
The fact that both purchasing integration into teams, as well as supplier integration on
teams, is facilitated based on the ability of purchasing to provide relevant supply
market intelligence has also been noted in our interviews with executives. One
executive we spoke with at a major catalyst manufacturer noted that:

Supply market intelligence will become the only form of strategic advantage in the future. We
bring insights into the market place on supply market conditions that has won us
[purchasing] the respect and trust of internal business functions such as operations,
marketing, and ﬁnance.

H2a, H2b – supply management inﬂuence
Our second set of hypotheses examined the impact of the entrepreneurial behaviour of
supply management inﬂuence, which was closely aligned to the entrepreneurial
attributes of locus of planning and tolerance of risk. This construct was operationalised
as the relative status of supply management in the organization. Our results found that
supply management’s inﬂuence was a good predictor of the extent to which they had “a
seat at the table” with other business function planning activities. However, this
element was not an effective predictor of the ability of suppliers to be fully integrated
into ﬁrm decision-making processes.

The ﬁrst result suggests that the entrepreneurial facet of entrepreneurship (Covin and
Slevin, 1989) is an important foundation for building an effective supply management
capability. According to Miller and Friesen (1983), ﬁrm proactiveness depends on the
response to the question, “does it shape the environment by introducing new products,
technologies, administrative techniques, or does it merely react?” This approach considers
the possibility that supply management must shape their environment through their own
entrepreneurial actions, and must achieve this through a process of fostering a culture of
relationship building with senior management. Supply management has historically been
in a position of acting as a service function, and was viewed primarily as a tactical function
(Chen et al., 2004). Changing this perception requires a strong supply management leader
who is able to overcome resistance to change and to introduce a bold innovation into the
ﬁrm’s strategic planning processes (Rogers and Schoemaker, 1971). It will also require
someone who is patient and willing to develop a strong relationship with key business unit
and functional leaders. As one senior executive we interviewed noted:

I always approach a business unit president or the head of a function such as HR by ﬁrst
introducing myself, and asking them how I can help them. I then spend a lot of time visiting
with them, and learning about what it is they buy, how they buy it, and from whom. Then
I provide some suggestions as to how I can help them save money or improve their supplier’s
performance through development of a category strategy. But I never try to strong-arm them
into doing anything – instead, I ask if they will let me work on a small pilot project to
demonstrate the capabilities of our supply management team. Once they see what we can do
for them, then we are asked back in again and again.

In this manner, supply management builds credibility with the organization, which
leads to eventual acceptance of supply managers on teams and business unit planning
processes.

H3 – cross-enterprise integration and supplier integration
Cross-enterprise integration was assessed in terms of purchasing representation on
product and process design team meetings, as well as accountability for strategic
results. These factors had a signiﬁcant impact on the extent to which ﬁrms’ integrated
external suppliers via team processes and information systems linkages. This result
also aligns with the prior result – that is, supply management status helps to get the
team a “seat at the table”, but further work has to be done before supplier inputs can be
truly integrated into functional decision making. Supply management inﬂuence
legitimizes the active participation of supply managers in the planning process, and
helps to prevent the potential for good ideas to be left undiscovered simply because
they were not involved in the planning process. This level of participation develops a
base upon which supply management can also bring suppliers to the table. In so doing,
the entrepreneurial process is further escalated by maximizing the diversity of
viewpoints (including external viewpoints provided by suppliers), and minimizes
homogeneity of management teams (Lant et al., 1992). This latter issue can constrain
entrepreneurial activity, as found by studies that identiﬁed a negative relationship
between top management team homogeneity and an openness to innovation and
change (Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Judge and Ziethaml, 1992). Instead, a deeper and
more diverse mix of team players that includes external suppliers can increase the
possibility of new product development and process innovations that lead to success
(Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Petersen et al., 2005).

As one manager from a ﬁnancial services ﬁrm noted:

I welcome supply management’s input. In fact, I would like to have a supply physically
located in my facility, so that I could talk to him every day if I wanted to. This person must
have to have enough connections with the supply community to broker the other people from
the right sources. I don’t necessarily need someone to manage the relationships – but I need
this person to help me run my business!

H4, H5, H6 – impact on sourcing enterprise performance and ﬁnancial performance
Both elements of entrepreneurial behaviour mentioned previously (cross-enterprise
integration and supplier integration) had an impact on both enterprise sourcing
performance and ﬁnancial performance. In capability-based competition, where key
strategic assets are trans-organizational, enterprising ﬁrms that are able to design
alliance networks with key factors of supply are likely to be advantaged, as such
alliances tend to be difﬁcult to duplicate and can lead to sustainable, above-average
market performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Effective integration of supplier concepts
can also facilitate the development of skills and knowledge, increased partnering
options, and cumulative learning that creates additional value (Anand and Khanna,
2000; Sarkar et al., 2001b). Value is created through the learning of new skills and
leveraging the complementary resources of supplier partners (Hitt et al., 2000; Kogut,
1988). Tangible buyer performance metrics including reduced lead time, improved
product designs, and improved product quality create competitive factors which in
turn translate into above-normal market returns and shareholder value. This result
supports prior research linking entrepreneurial orientation and learning to improved
supply management performance in terms of relationships, cycle time, and quality
(Gonzalez-Padron et al., 2008; Hult et al., 2002, 2003). Companies that understand this
relationship have developed truly world-class supply management capabilities, and


have adopted high levels of supplier integration. Not surprisingly, these ﬁrms
(including Toyota, Cisco, Samsung, and others) have shown dramatic ﬁnancial
performance improvements over their competitors.

Managerial implications
Several managerial implications also stem from our results. First, ﬁrms who are seeking
to build improved collaboration with suppliers must recruit and train managers who
have a strong orientation towards building strong internal relationships with
stakeholders, who bring credibility in the form of hiring individuals with strong
supply market knowledge and networks, who can “sell” business units on these
capabilities, and provide consultative support to business unit and functional teams in
the form of supply market intelligence, contracting and negotiation skills, and category
management strategy (Giunipero et al., 2005; Handﬁeld, 2006; Hult et al., 2003). The
importance of team-building skills, leadership skills, and relationship management
skills has been echoed in other research (Giunipero et al., 2006), and provides a strong
basis for future research in this nascent ﬁeld of inquiry.

Second,

the implications of

this research suggest

that supply management
organizations must begin to act in a more entrepreneurial fashion. Some of the
managers also agreed, noting that in some cases they are allowing their category
managers to have free-rein in making independent sourcing strategies, pursuing
innovative and new supplier relationships, and being more accountable for results than
for process. Changing an organizational culture to allow category teams to act in a
more entrepreneurial fashion is certainly a new idea that will require additional
support and research before it becomes established as a best practice for the future.

Limitations and future research
There are several limitations to our ﬁndings. First, we recognize that the causal chain from
entrepreneurial behaviour to ﬁrm performance needs further investigation. Further
research should address indirect effects through mediating variables such as supplier
performance, technological complexity, team-based processes, and industry impacts.
These parameters may vary and inﬂuence the results, since the research on supplier
integration and supply management planning integration is nascent. Other global
variables that have been found to be relevant in the entrepreneurial literature may also
inﬂuence the research, such as ﬁrm size, ﬁrm structure, and management orientation.

Conclusion
The application of entrepreneurial concepts as a lens to study supply management is in
a nascent stage, yet our results complement many other recent studies, and lend
credibility to this theoretical orientation. Moreover, the results provide a strong basis
for the contention that entrepreneurial behaviour is an important attribute for ﬁrms to
seek in building a supply management leadership team.
