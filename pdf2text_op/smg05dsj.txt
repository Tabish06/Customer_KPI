ABSTRACT

Manufacturing ﬁrms are increasingly seeking cost and other competitive advantages by
tightly coupling and managing their relationship with suppliers. Among other mecha-
nisms, interorganizational systems (IOS) that facilitate boundary-spanning activities of
a ﬁrm enable them to effectively manage different types of buyer–supplier relationships.
This study integrates literature from the operations and information systems ﬁelds to
create a joint perspective in understanding the linkages between the nature of the IOS,
buyer–supplier relationships, and manufacturing performance at the dyadic level. Ex-
ternal integration, breadth, and initiation are used to capture IOS functionality, and their
effect on process efﬁciency and sourcing leverage is examined. The study also explores
the differences in how manufacturing ﬁrms use IOS when operating under varying lev-
els of competitive intensity and product standardization. In order to test the research
models and related hypothesis, empirical data on buyer–supplier dyads is collected from
manufacturing ﬁrms. The results show that only higher levels of external integration
that go beyond simple procurement systems, as well as who initiates the IOS, allow
manufacturing ﬁrms to enhance process efﬁciency. In contrast, IOS breadth and IOS ini-
tiation enable manufacturing ﬁrms to enhance sourcing leverage over their suppliers. In
addition, ﬁrms making standardized products in highly competitive environments tend
to achieve higher process efﬁciencies and have higher levels of external integration. The
study shows how speciﬁc IOS decisions allow manufacturing ﬁrms to better manage
their dependence on the supplier for resources and thereby select system functionalities
that are consistent with their own operating environments and the desired supply chain
design.

INTRODUCTION

The increasing trend toward purchasing inputs and other raw materials from out-
side the ﬁrm has raised the importance of supply chain management. The re-
sultant decrease in vertical integration has provided an impetus for managers to
place greater emphasis on managing buyer–supplier relationships in manufactur-
ing ﬁrms. Conner and Prahalad (1996), in supporting this contention, argue that
one source of differential performance between ﬁrms is the way they organize
exchange activity. For effective management of buyer–supplier relationships, or-
ganizations need to choose appropriate relationships ranging from arm’s length
to coordinated relationships, and adapt management practices to ﬁt those rela-
tionships (Bensaou, 1999). In addition, facilitating technologies that consistently
support these relationships are needed. Interorganizational systems (IOS) such as
electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic trading systems, Web-based procure-
ment systems, and supplier relationship management systems have emerged as
important technologies that support boundary-spanning activities associated with
effective management of buyer–supplier relationships. These IOS offer various
functionalities that need to be aligned with the nature of the desired relation-
ship (Choudhury, 1997). An interesting question that arises is how can such an
alignment be achieved? Also, what is the contingent effect of competitive envi-
ronment and product characteristics on how ﬁrms use IOS in a buyer–supplier
relationship context? This study addresses these questions at the dyadic level in
an attempt to enhance our understanding of choices a ﬁrm makes regarding these
systems, their alignment with desired performance outcomes, and their contingent
context.

The next section provides the broad background for the study leading up
to the research objectives. This is followed by a review of the different thrusts
taken in this area by the operations management (OM) and information systems
(IS) ﬁelds, respectively, and a discussion on the need to integrate them. The re-
search framework, including the hypotheses, is then deﬁned. The research method
section describes the process followed in empirically testing the hypotheses. The
results of the study and their implications for both research and practice are then
described.

GENERAL BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

Effective management of buyer–supplier relationships is an important research do-
main (Monczka, Trent, & Callahan, 1994; Tan, 2001). Heide (1994) proposes that
sourcing from the market is a heterogeneous phenomenon. Building on this thesis,
various typologies and taxonomies have been developed over time to categorize
buyer–supplier relationships. Lambert, Emmelhainz, and Gardner (1996) propose
that relationships with suppliers can range from an arm’s length association to
complete functional coordination. Similarly, Bensaou (1999) proposes market ex-
change, captive buyer, captive supplier, and strategic partnerships as distinct types

of relationships with varying characteristics. An interesting insight that emerges is
the contrasting performance outcomes that ﬁrms often aim to achieve from insti-
tuting different types of relationships. For example, ﬁrms may aspire to enhance
their sourcing leverage through accessing detailed information on market prices
and exploiting competitive conditions prevalent in the market in which the supplier
is operating (Hennart, 1993; Ramsay, 1996; Heriot & Kulkarni, 2001). Alterna-
tively, ﬁrms may strive to enhance process efﬁciencies by forging collaborative
relationships through close coupling of processes and extensive information ex-
change between the ﬁrms (Mohr & Spekman, 1994; Monczka, Peterson, Handﬁeld,
& Ragatz, 1998).

Transaction cost economics proposes that the decision to adopt a particular
relationship conﬁguration depends primarily on cost consideration. Firms sourcing
inputs from other ﬁrms incur transaction costs, which may relate to search-related
costs emanating from exploring the marketplace to identify the best alternative.
In the context of enduring relationships, the need for continuous adaptation and
evaluation contribute to transaction costs. Different types of relationships also pose
varying information processing requirements. For example, in an arm’s length as-
sociation, ﬁrms follow the procedure dictated by the standard market transaction.
However, pretransaction information processing requirements that involve iden-
tifying potential alternatives are relatively high. Similarly, partnership-type rela-
tionships require extensive information processing to facilitate mutual adaptations
and process synchronization. Firms need to put in place appropriate mechanisms
that provide the required information processing capacity for effective market
mediation manifested in either building sourcing leverage or enhancing process
efﬁciency.

IOS offer various functionalities that allow ﬁrms to achieve these diverse ob-
jectives and performance outcomes within the context of different types of buyer–
supplier relationships. Cash and Konsynski (1985) deﬁne an IOS as “an automated
information system shared by two or more companies.” In examining the impacts
of IOS within a buyer–supplier context, Johnston and Vitale (1988) propose a
theoretical framework, which argues that using IOS can provide ﬁrms with com-
parative efﬁciency and bargaining power. They argue that IOS can support tightly
coupled processes between ﬁrms. For example, availability of precise and timely
information through the IOS can enable production scheduling to be aligned with
actual usage rather than sales or shipments. This provides comparative efﬁciency
through lower inventory costs, lower costs of coordination, and shorter, more reli-
able response times (Bakos & Brynjolfsson, 1993; Clemons, Reddi, & Row, 1993;
Dai & Kauffman, 2002). On the other hand, IOS can enable ﬁrms to establish one-
to-many linkages and enhance sourcing leverage through altering search-related
costs (Bakos, 1991; Choudhury, Hartzel, & Konsynski, 1998; Subramaniam &
Shaw, 2002). For example, one-to-many links lower the cost of shopping as well
as increase the odds of getting the best prices available. Thus, due consideration
needs to be given to various facets of IOS that support supply chain strategies of
a ﬁrm (Dai & Kauffman, 2002). Such an approach is likely to provide a concep-
tual outline of the various design features that can be incorporated into an IOS. It
also allows for a better understanding of how design and use of IOS can impact
performance outcomes associated with different
types of buyer–supplier

relationships, thereby providing prescriptive implications to managers for effective
deployment of IOS.

Another important aspect in using IOS is the distinction between those ﬁrms
that initiate the system (called the “initiators”) and those that participate in the
system (called the “participants”). Initiators tailor the IOS to their beneﬁt and exert
more control over the participants. Research indicates that initiators are the primary
beneﬁciaries of IOS (Webster, 1995; Riggins & Mukhopadhyay, 1999). Thus, it is
important to consider initiation issues in evaluating how IOS enable ﬁrms to achieve
performance outcomes associated with their supply chain strategies (Hwang, Pegel,
Rao, & Sethi, 1993). Finally, research indicates that competitive conditions in
which a ﬁrm is operating and characteristics of the product being manufactured
by the ﬁrm are two important issues that must be considered within the context
of supply chain management (Fisher, 1997; Ramadas & Spekman, 2000). Limited
guidance, however, is available on what roles competitive conditions and product
characteristics play in a ﬁrm’s decision to use different facets of IOS to support
different types of interﬁrm relationships.

Based on the above review, this study has three key research objectives:
• To examine the impact of various facets of IOS and initiation of the sys-
tem on process efﬁciency and sourcing leverage—the two performance
outcomes that ﬁrms aim at achieving within the context of better manag-
ing their relationships with suppliers.
• To explore differences in the use of IOS between ﬁrms operating under
different competitive conditions and producing products with different
characteristics.
• To provide a broader and more contemporary conceptualization of IOS
that focuses on its design elements (which when conﬁgured appropri-
ately meet organizational needs), rather than focusing on a speciﬁc type
of IOS (such as an EDI). Such an approach is also consistent with the
emergence of Web-based technologies that provide ﬁrms with more op-
tions in selecting and conﬁguring systems developed by different vendor
companies.

The next section reviews literature in this area in both the OM and IS ﬁelds.

MAJOR RESEARCH STREAMS

Research in buyer–supplier relationships and IOS has been addressed from dif-
ferent vantage points in the OM and IS ﬁelds. Researchers in the logistics and
operations area have focused primarily on buyer–supplier relationships and sup-
ply chain issues, with the IOS underemphasized, while the IS literature predomi-
nantly focuses on the nature and types of IOS. The theoretical perspectives used
also show divergence. IS literature predominantly builds its case on transaction
cost economics by asserting that information technology (IT) reduces coordina-
tion costs, ultimately resulting in efﬁciency gains. Game theory, micro-economic
theory, and industrial economics lenses have also been employed to examine the
electronic marketplace phenomenon. On the other hand, research in operations
draws heavily from information economics, strategic management literature, and


Saeed, Malhotra, and Grover

coordination theory. Even though some recent work has attempted to provide a
more integrative view of IOS in a supply chain context (e.g., Premkumar, 2000;
Ahmad & Schroeder, 2001; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2002; Hill & Scudder, 2002),
the research domains have by and large been disparate.

OM Perspective
Literature in the OM domain expounds on various sourcing strategies available to
ﬁrms for sourcing inputs and raw materials. Kraljic (1983) offers a classiﬁcation
framework for categorizing sourcing situations and the appropriate sourcing strat-
egy. Landeros and Monczka (1989) propose vertical integration, taper integration
(a strategy wherein a ﬁrm partly manufactures the product in house and partly buys
the same product from outside suppliers), long-term cooperative relationships, and
competitive spot bidding as some alternatives that are available to a ﬁrm. An im-
portant theme that emerges from this work is that for effective management of the
supply chain, a ﬁrm needs to choose appropriate relationships with suppliers and
structure management processes such that they ﬁt the nature of those relationships.
For example, in the case of competitive spot bidding, a ﬁrm needs to put in place
processes that will enable it to scan the market thoroughly and shop around for the
best possible price. In contrast, long-term cooperative relationships require coor-
dination mechanisms that can facilitate extensive information sharing to optimize
the efﬁciency of the linkages.

Research in the OM area views IOS as a facilitator of coordination between
supply chain partners (Tan, 2001). Edwards, Peters, and Sharman (2001) argue
that in order to gain efﬁciencies, companies need to exchange large amounts of
planning and operational data, ranging from information on annual contracts and
periodic progress reporting to real-time delivery and invoicing data. IOS, espe-
cially supply chain software along with enterprise application integration software
(EAI), provide the opportunity to move toward an extended enterprise business
model. Frohlich and Westbrook (2002) found that using Web-based technolo-
gies to support supply and demand integration enables ﬁrms to achieve higher
levels of performance. Hill and Scudder (2002) contend that using EDI can
facilitate frequent and automatic bidirectional information ﬂows between sup-
ply chain partners, thus enhancing degree of coordination between them. They
found that the depth of EDI use, captured in terms of the extent of use of
11 different transaction sets, each facilitating different types of information ex-
change, enables ﬁrms to better coordinate activities with their suppliers. In order
to gain process efﬁciencies through collaborative or partnership-like relation-
ships, ﬁrms need to expand information ﬂows in the supply chain by institut-
ing IOS that are integrated and facilitate exchange of a comprehensive set of
information.

While the major thrust of this work has been on the creation of more efﬁcient
supply chains, there is recognition that the notion of ﬁt between the technology
and supply chain processes is important to yield better outcomes.

IS Perspective
Transaction cost economics has been the dominant theoretical lens in evaluating the
impact of IOS in IS literature. There is considerable agreement among researchers


370

Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems

on the role of IOS in reducing coordination costs and transaction risk (Malone,
Yates, & Benjamin, 1987; Clemons et al., 1993). However, disagreement exists on
the eventual impact. Some researchers argue for a move toward more market-type
relationships, while others propose more integrated buyer–supplier relationships
(Hess & Kemerer, 1994). Recently, researchers have pointed out that IOS can enable
mixed-mode governance structures, which combine the elements of markets and
hierarchies (Holland & Lockett, 1997; Kambil, Nunes, & Vitale, 1999). IOS can
simultaneously support collaborative relationships and also enable an internalized
market by allowing ﬁrms to establish one-to-many links to retain competition.
For example, integration of systems across organizational boundaries at multiple
process and functional levels can result in effective coordination that may allow
organizations to increase responsiveness and reduce costs (Holland & Lockett,
1997). On the other hand, an electronic trading system can allow an organization
to compare prices and evaluate alternative sources of supply, which may enhance
its sourcing leverage (Bakos, 1991). Riggins and Mukopadhyay (1994) describe
an automatic vending system for which an important component is a database that
contains information on open agreements, quality ratings, and price performance
of suppliers. Similarly, Holland and Lockett (1997) provide an example of an IOS
whereby a bank closely coordinates links with two banks, but also maintains links
with four other banks selected from a large pool of banks. Such a system permits
them to check prices and induce competition.

Researchers have presented various classiﬁcation schemes for categorizing
IOS. Choudhury (1997) proposes electronic markets, electronic dyads, and elec-
tronic monopolies as three distinct types of IOS that can support different types of
buyer–supplier relationships. The differentiating factors among these types of IOS
are the number of ﬁrms with whom the electronic linkage is established, and the
extent to which electronic integration is supported by the IOS. Researchers thus
argue that a trade-off exists between electronic brokerage and electronic integration
effects that are enabled by IOS. Kambil et al. (1999) argue “to achieve beneﬁts
of integration effect, participating companies have to forgo most of the beneﬁts of
participating in an open market.”

Studies in the EDI domain show that intensity in use of EDI technology
(depicted as synchronization of item identiﬁcation codes and number of processes
and functions that are electronically linked between the two ﬁrms through EDI)
can signiﬁcantly reduce order-processing costs, improve inventory management,
and support just-in-time processes (Mukhopadhyay, Kekre, & Kalathur, 1995;
Mukhopadhyay & Kekre, 2002). But when IOS is used to closely couple op-
erations between ﬁrms, it raises switching costs from the buyer’s perspective
and reduces the buyer’s sourcing leverage. On the other hand, having electronic
linkages with a large set of potential suppliers may enable organizations to en-
hance their sourcing leverage (Holland & Lockett, 1997). Thus, the extent to
which the IOS enables closely coordinated structures between the buyer and
the suppliers, and the extent to which it supports electronic linkages with a
broad set of suppliers, constitute two facets of IOS that may impact performance
differently.

In sum, the main thrust of the IS literature is on characteristics of the IOS
and its effect on the nature of the relationship. There is recognition that the way


Saeed, Malhotra, and Grover

371

the IOS is implemented could lead to outcomes that involve not only efﬁciency
improvements, but also greater sourcing leverage.

Synthesis of Literature
Both streams reviewed above provide useful insights. The OM literature examines
sourcing strategies and the use of better information ﬂows to create more efﬁcient
supply chain processes. The IS literature focuses on governance structure and
the role and characteristics of the IOS in inﬂuencing this structure. Both streams
recognize that for effective management of buyer–supplier relationships, ﬁrms need
to maintain a portfolio of relationships that may have different characteristics and
objectives. The two domains are also in agreement regarding the importance of IOS
in facilitating collaborative relationships through improved information ﬂows.

The Johnston and Vitale (1988) framework on impact of IOS effectively cap-
tures the issues emphasized in both research streams. They contend that leveraging
certain functionalities of IOS can enable ﬁrms to achieve comparative efﬁciency
and enhance sourcing leverage. One component of comparative efﬁciency relates
to reduction of costs and enhancement in the reliability of boundary spanning
processes, and is called process efﬁciency. IOS that facilitate comprehensive in-
formation ﬂows through a system-to-system linkage can reduce inventory costs
and provide the beneﬁts of vertical integration (more control, coordination, and
lower costs) (Johnston & Vitale, 1988). Sourcing leverage relates to an increase
in monopsony power through instant and efﬁcient access to alternative sources of
supply. Bakos and Treacy (1986) assert that “in most game theoretic situations,
each side can improve its position, that is develop competitive advantage, by in-
creasing the number of alternatives available. This number is limited by the cost
of the search process.” IOS that facilitate instant access to alternative sources of
supply and market intelligence can enable a ﬁrm to resolve bargaining situations
to its advantage. We draw on the complementary aspects present in the IS and OM
literature, and peg it to the Johnston and Vitale (1988) framework to develop our
research framework.

Two other facets have also been suggested. First is the notion of system initi-
ation. It has been pointed out that the company that initiates, owns, and controls the
IOS may dictate its functioning, which in turn puts the company in a better position
to achieve its performance objectives (Webster, 1995). The use of power to coerce
a supplier to adopt EDI systems has been well documented (Webster, 1995; Crook
& Kumar, 1998; Hart & Saunders, 1998). Thus, in evaluating the performance
impact of IOS use, it is important to consider initiation and the hub-and-spoke
nature of electronic networks (Riggins & Mukhopadhyay, 1999; Mukhopadhyay
& Kekre, 2002). Johnston and Vitale (1988) also indicate that outcomes associated
with comparative efﬁciency and sourcing leverage could be inﬂuenced by who
initiated the IOS and how that initiation enables a ﬁrm to control participation and
access to information. The second facet is the context in which the ﬁrm operates.
Researchers have argued that both the nature of competition in the marketplace,
and the types of products manufactured could inﬂuence not only the nature of the
IOS adopted, but the performance outcomes as well (Grover, 1993; Fisher, 1997;
Magretta, 1998; Kumar, 2001).

RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

Figure 1 represents the main research model. Process efﬁciency and sourcing lever-
age are the two performance outcomes that ﬁrms aim at achieving through institut-
ing different types of relationships with suppliers. In proposing the determinants of
performance, researchers have highlighted the importance of IOS functionalities
and capabilities and IOS initiation issues (Johnston & Vitale, 1988; Boyette et al.,
2002; Hill & Scudder, 2002; Mukhopadhyay & Kekre, 2002). It has also been sug-
gested that the extent to which internal systems of an organization are integrated
enables a ﬁrm to enhance efﬁciencies of boundary-spanning activities. A large
body of research highlights the beneﬁcial impacts of having internal integration
among systems within the organization (Duncan, 1995; Weill & Broadbent, 1999).
However, in the interorganizational context, researchers have proposed that internal
integration may be an important control variable in order to isolate the performance
impacts of IOS (Srinivasan, Kekre, & Mukhopadhyay, 1994) more precisely. In or-
der to enhance model precision, we include the extent to which internal systems of
a ﬁrm are integrated as a control variable. The two other contingent factors driving
our inquiry are the competitive environment in which a ﬁrm operates and the type
of products it manufactures (Figure 1). Subsequent subsections elaborate on the
model variables, their measurement, and the rationale for related hypotheses.

Process Efﬁciency
Process efﬁciency is the likely objective in buyer–supplier relationships that entail
close coordination between buyers and suppliers. The need for adaptation and
synchronization of process in these types of relationships is high. Firms either need
to keep buffers or slack resources to compensate for lack of information (which
adds to the cost), or develop mechanisms for effective coordination. Transaction
cost economics proposes that hierarchy-type structures are cost efﬁcient in high-
coordination conditions. Such structures facilitate extensive sharing of information
required for effective coordination.

A large body of literature in the IS domain argues that using IOS enables a
ﬁrm to reduce coordination costs by facilitating explicit coordination (Clemons et
al., 1993). IOS reduce costs of communicating and processing information. When
information can be readily exchanged and processed, excess capacity or slack re-
sources can be replaced with real-time information that is often much cheaper.
Thus, automation of transactions along with visibility into production, schedul-
ing, inventory, and delivery status can lower transactions costs and safety stock
requirements, and enhance delivery reliability. Clemons et al. (1993) conclude:

These technologies permit remote access to partner’s databases in support of
one’s own operations and scheduling; that is, a buyer can verify a supplier’s
product availability before placing an order for a critical part, or a supplier can
verify the customer’s demand forecasts and manufacturing scheduling before
beginning a large production run.

One aspect within the context of IOS that has received considerable attention
is electronic integration. Zaheer and Venkatraman (1994) propose that electronic
integration has the characteristics of vertical integration but without ownership.
Premkumar (2000) proposes communication, cooperation, and collaboration as
three levels of sophistication in IOS use. At the ﬁrst level, ﬁrms just focus on
automation of the communication process with minimal attention toward integra-
tion of systems. As the ﬁrms progress to higher levels of sophistication, they start
paying attention to integration of external and internal systems. In addition, the
information ﬂows between companies increase to encompass inventory, planning,
and scheduling information. Similarly, EDI diversity, depth, penetration, embed-
dedness, and integration with internal systems of the company have been proposed
to contribute toward enhanced performance (Mukopadhyay et al., 1995; Massetti
& Zmud, 1996; Chatﬁeld & Yetton, 2000; Truman, 2000; Hill & Scudder, 2002).
Establishing integrated EDI links enhances the “procedural speciﬁcity” through re-
design of processes and establishing unique information exchange routines (Zaheer
& Venkataraman, 1994). Mukopadhyay and Kekre (2002) assert:

The integrated EDI allows the customer production department to directly
release electronic orders to PMI without veriﬁcation. In the absence of in-
tegration, the order has to be further veriﬁed by the customer procurement
department as well as engineering department. The integration also eliminates
the need for the order to be printed at PMI and reentered after veriﬁcation, thus
reducing time and errors. Clearly, integration substantially improves the order
processing at each end, therefore increasing procedural speciﬁcity.


374

Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems

Taken together, these prior conceptualizations of systems integration between
buyers and sellers capture the extent of electronic links between various functional
units in the two ﬁrms, high level of system integration between the ﬁrms and with
internal systems of the ﬁrms, and extensive bidirectional sharing of information
on production schedules and inventory levels. We call this overall construct of
systems integration between two ﬁrms as external integration and argue that high
levels of external integration will allow a ﬁrm to gain process efﬁciencies in terms
of reduced coordination costs, improved inventory management, and reliable lead
times (Clemons et al., 1993; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2002). This leads to our ﬁrst
hypothesis.

H1: The extent of external integration is positively related to process

efﬁciency.

Hwang et al. (1993) found that initiators of IOS carefully planned technology,
attained higher levels of internal integration, and achieved greater beneﬁts from
the electronic network. Webster (1995) provides examples of Fordnet and a British
company that mandated the use of EDI systems to their suppliers. By dictating
communication protocols, message standards, product coding, and information
handling procedures through electronic systems, these companies were able to
achieve relatively greater beneﬁts. As a result, the initiating ﬁrms may be able to
structure the IOS to their advantage to better serve their needs, and thus enhance
their process efﬁciency.

H2: The extent to which the IOS is initiated by the buyer ﬁrm is posi-

tively related to process efﬁciency.

Sourcing Leverage
Signiﬁcant literature highlights the ability of an IOS to establish one-to-many
relationships. Establishing electronic linkages with a large number of suppliers
may allow a ﬁrm to get market intelligence, expand its sourcing leverage, and
allow it to negotiate better contracts (Bakos, 1991). It has been pointed out that
electronic markets enable many-to-many interactions, thus providing search cost
beneﬁts and reduced prices (Choudhury et al., 1998). One-to-many links from a
buyer’s perspective fulﬁll a similar purpose. By establishing electronic linkages
with the suppliers that constitute its consideration set, the buying ﬁrm can create
an internalized market in which multiple suppliers can compete for its business.
This concept, which we call IOS breadth, reﬂects the second functionality (apart
from external integration described above) of the IOS, and refers to the extent to
which the IOS can interface with multiple suppliers. It is similar to the EDI breadth
dimension proposed by Massetti and Zmud (1996). The IOS breadth functionality
can enable a ﬁrm to expand the search space and induce competition among a large
number of suppliers through the IOS, thereby providing the focal buyer greater
sourcing leverage.

Sourcing leverage is important in purchase situations in which the ﬁrm needs
to compare alterative sources of supply and the offerings of different suppliers. Ex-
panding search space to identify alternatives is constrained by search-related costs,
which ultimately limit the sourcing leverage of the ﬁrm. Because high search costs
enable the sellers to extract extra rent from the buyers by pricing products above


Saeed, Malhotra, and Grover

375

marginal costs (Bakos & Tracey, 1986), a ﬁrm’s ability to scan the market to gather
intelligence and identify possible sources of supply through greater IOS breadth
can save substantial time and costs. IOS breadth can enable the buyer to explore
the market more thoroughly with minimal search costs, constrain the supplier from
extracting extra rent, induce competition, and eventually lower purchase prices for
the buyer. Thus, the presence of IOS breadth facilitates a greater degree of sourcing
leverage, and forms the basis of our third hypothesis.

H3: The extent of IOS breadth is positively related to sourcing

leverage.

The relationship between external integration and sourcing leverage seems
to have equivocal evidence. Researchers argue that in many industries, ﬁrms have
coerced their suppliers to establish electronic links or lose business (Webster, 1995).
By using IOS to establish closely coordinated processes, these ﬁrms were able to
get visibility into the suppliers’ operations and used it as a bargaining tool (Crook
& Kumar, 1998). As more suppliers get electronically linked to the buyer, this can
increase the sourcing leverage for the buyer.

On the other hand, it has been argued that closely integrated systems increase
switching costs from a buyer’s perspective (Johnston & Vitale, 1988). Integrated
electronic linkages result in procedural speciﬁcity (Mukhopadhyay & Kekre, 2002).
Thus, when a ﬁrm uses information systems to develop partner-speciﬁc processes
and information exchange routines, it increases switching costs, which in turn
results in reduced sourcing leverage.

We believe that the latter argument will prevail, as there is an inherent trade-
off between beneﬁts of electronic integration and those of electronic brokerage
(Malone et al., 1987). It is our contention that ﬁrms utilizing systems that facilitate
external integration will do so to gain the efﬁciency beneﬁts of integration, and, in
the process, will forgo the market-based strategic beneﬁts of sourcing leverage.

H4: The extent of external integration is negatively related to sourcing

leverage.

Initiation of the IOS allows a ﬁrm to conﬁgure its functionalities and features
to its advantage (Webster, 1995). Thus, initiator ﬁrms have leverage to dictate the
network characteristics, which enables them to achieve greater beneﬁts as compared
to the follower ﬁrms. In those purchase situations where gaining more sourcing
leverage may be the dominant performance objective, the initiating ﬁrm may be
able to structure the IOS to achieve this performance outcome.

H5: The extent of IOS initiation is positively related to sourcing lever-

age.

Competitive Intensity and Product Characteristics
As previously highlighted, the environment in which a ﬁrm operates has been pre-
sented as an important determinant of IOS adoption. Researchers argue that by
facilitating real-time information access along with automation of business pro-
cesses, IT systems can enable organizations to respond to dynamic environmental
settings (Kambil & Short, 1994). However, little research has focused on how
use of IOS differs among organizations faced with different levels of competitive
intensity. Research in the IOS adoption domain concludes that ﬁrms faced with


376

Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems

high competitive pressures are more likely to adopt EDI systems (Grover, 1993;
Premkumar, Ramamurthy, & Sree, 1994). It has also been shown that EDI systems,
which increase efﬁciencies within the industry, can provide an effective response
to the competitive environment (Chwelos, Benbasat, & Dexter, 2001). Based on
this presumption, it can be argued that external integration (mechanism for creating
efﬁcient processes) and process efﬁciency will vary across ﬁrms operating under
different levels of competitive intensity.

Product characteristics impact the type of buyer–supplier relationships,
procurement processes, and supply chain management practices. Fisher (1997)
proposes that ﬁrms can produce functional products or innovative products and
that different supply chain strategies and designs are appropriate in each condition.
Another categorization often is made between ﬁrms producing standardized prod-
ucts versus customized products (Saﬁzadeh, Ritzman, & Mallick, 2000). We follow
this approach and argue that product characteristics are likely to play a role in a
ﬁrm’s supply chain strategy and operationalization of IOS. Kumar (2001) argues
that current uses of IOS within a supply chain context mainly support optimiza-
tion of the supply chain. Optimization works best in relatively static supply chains
that have a stable set of supply chain partners and standardized products. Firms
operating in such stable conditions and producing standardized products may reap
greater beneﬁts by using IOS to closely couple operations with a stable set of sup-
pliers. This can allow ﬁrms to collaborate on planning, forecasting, scheduling,
and applying various optimization techniques that use historical data. More formal
relationships aimed at maximizing process efﬁciencies can be sustained with the
vendors. Customized products, on the other hand, are subject to changing customer
preferences. There is minimal historical data available for planning. Even the re-
quirements placed on the buying and manufacturing functions shift rapidly over
time. Moreover, Kumar (2001) contends that “in demand-driven networks tempo-
rary supply chains emerge, operate for the lifespan of the market opportunity, and
then dissolve again.” So, under these conditions, using the IOS to closely couple
processes may not be appropriate (Moshowitz, 1997). Thus, it can be argued that
ﬁrms producing different types of products may show divergence in using IOS as
well as its outcome—process efﬁciency.

Typically, ﬁrms making standardized products will be operating in mature
industry segments in which pressure on proﬁt margins is strong and competitive in-
tensity is high. In contrast, customized products will be made in an environment of
low competitive intensity because there are few players in the market who compete
on the basis of innovation and product variety. These environmental combinations
on product type and competitive intensity are used to examine the joint impact of
competitive intensity and product characteristics on desired IOS features. How-
ever, given the lack of prior theoretical bases for examining this issue, we do not
presuppose directionality and only argue that external integration and process efﬁ-
ciency will be different across ﬁrms facing varying levels of competitive intensity
and producing products with different characteristics.

H6: There will be a difference in the level of external integration
between ﬁrms operating under conditions of high competitive
intensity and producing standardized products as compared to

ﬁrms operating under conditions of low competitive intensity and
producing customized products.

H7: There will be a difference in process efﬁciency between ﬁrms oper-
ating under conditions of high competitive intensity and produc-
ing standardized products as compared to ﬁrms operating under
conditions of low competitive intensity and producing customized
products.

RESEARCH METHOD

Survey methodology was chosen given the context of the study. The data were
collected from manufacturing ﬁrms on organizational-level variables, as well as on
the characteristics of the IOS that support their interaction with the suppliers. This
information relates to the dyadic linkages established between the ﬁrms and their
suppliers. Subsequent methodological issues related to construct measurement,
data collection, and construct validity are discussed next.

Measurement
Table 1 shows the operationalization and measurement of various constructs repre-
sented in our research framework (Figure 1). With respect to dependent variables,
we are interested in measuring two aspects of performance. First, process efﬁciency
was evaluated by asking respondents to rate the extent to which electronic link-
ages allowed the ﬁrm to reduce transaction costs, inventory costs, and uncertainty
in lead times (Mukopadhyay et al., 1995; Narasimhan & Das, 1999; Frohlich &
Westbrook, 2001; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2002). Improvements in process efﬁ-
ciency would tend to reduce manufacturing costs and thus ﬂow directly to the
bottom line. Second, sourcing leverage was measured by asking the respondents
to rate the extent to which electronic linkages enabled the ﬁrm to get leverage over
the ﬁrm’s suppliers, explore alternative sources of supply, and search for alterna-
tive products. (Johnston & Vitale, 1988; Choudhury et al., 1998). The items for
these two measures were adapted from the work of Mahmood and Soon (1991),
Mukhopadhyay et al. (1995), Choudhury et al. (1998), and Narasimhan and Das
(1999).

Extent of systems integration, bidirectional information ﬂows, and electronic
linking of various business functions captured external integration and its various
aspects. It was measured by asking the respondents during our empirical data col-
lection to classify their existing electronic linkages into four progressive stages
(Figure 2). Building on previous conceptualizations, we have captured increasing
levels of unidirectional and bidirectional information ﬂows. The arrows in Fig-
ure 2 capture electronic linkages between various business functions in the ﬁrms
(Massetti & Zmud, 1996; Chatﬁeld & Yetton, 2000) as well as bidirectional in-
formation ﬂow of different types of information between the ﬁrms (Massetti &
Zmud, 1996; Chatﬁeld & Yetton, 2000; Truman, 2000; Hill & Scudder, 2002). At
Stage 1, the buyer ﬁrm transmits orders or requests prices. At Stage 2, the ven-
dor can electronically transmit back inventory status and order completion status
and provide feedback on price checks. However, at both levels, only the purchas-
ing function of the buyer ﬁrm is interacting with the supplier. The combination

Figure 2: External integration of interorganizational systems.

The following levels describe different electronic linkages that your firm may have with your suppliers. Examples of 
the direction and type of information  flows that can exist along  the linkages  are also illustrated within each level. 
Please estimate below in column X the number of vendors with whom such links have been initiated by your firm, 
and in column Y the number of vendors with whom links have been initiated by the vendor.

of these two stages represents an electronic ordering system or an electronic pro-
curement system that automates the ordering process. We call the combination
of Stage 1 and Stage 2 External Integration Level 1, that is, representative of the
procurement process between the buyer and supplier ﬁrms.

At Stages 3 and 4, the planning function also gets involved. Information
related to plans and schedules is exchanged between the supply chain members, ﬁrst
in one direction (Stage 3) and eventually in both directions (Stage 4). Aggregation of
Stages 3 and 4 provides better information for closed-loop planning (e.g., Orlicky &
Plossl, 1994) for the buying ﬁrm, enables production plans and schedules of the two

ﬁrms to mesh well with each other, and facilitates implementation of manufacturing
resource planning (MRP) II systems. The MRP II systems and advanced planning
systems (APS) offered by software vendors implement this conﬁguration, which
we call External Integration Level 2.

The distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 external integration represents
a transition for the buying ﬁrms from using procurement systems to employing
more sophisticated and enterprise-wide APS. Also, Level 1 and Level 2 external
integration corresponds to actual procurement systems, ordering systems, MRP II
systems, and APS that are available in the marketplace from different software
vendors. Speciﬁcally, the base ordering systems offered by I2 and Manugistics
include order queries and processing and inventory checks. Additional modules
can be added to facilitate exchange of information necessary for forecasting, ca-
pacity planning, inventory, and replenishment. Shah, Meyers, and Ward (2002)
and Riggins and Mukhopadhyay (1994) have also used level-based approaches for
capturing integration. Shah et al. (2002) used a three-level approach wherein they
included an IOS capable of only supporting procurement activities in Level 1. IOS
classiﬁed as Level 2 incorporated shared ordering and scheduling systems, while
completely integrated systems were categorized as Level 3. Similarity to existing
systems available in the marketplace, along with evidence that prior studies have
also used a similar approach, were the main rationales for collapsing the four stages
into two levels.

A score for each ﬁrm was computed based on its response, whereby higher
stages of integration were progressively assigned higher weights. Subsequently,
Stages 1 and 2 were aggregated to represent External Integration Level 1, and
Stages 3 and 4 were combined to capture External Integration Level 2. Table 1
illustrates the actual computation for each level in greater detail.

IOS breadth was measured in our study as the number of suppliers with which
the ﬁrm has existing electronic linkages, divided by the total number of suppliers
with which the ﬁrm may routinely interact. Here the main objective was to capture
the potential consideration set the ﬁrm uses when making sourcing decisions, and
within this set, to see how many vendors have established electronic links with
the ﬁrm. This measurement approach has been suggested or used in other studies
as well (Jelassi & Figon, 1994; Massetti & Zmud, 1996; Mendelson & Pillai,
1998).

IOS initiation was evaluated as the number of electronic linkages initi-
ated by the ﬁrm, divided by the total number of electronic linkages that a ﬁrm
has established. Previous conceptualization has mostly investigated this issue as
a dichotomous variable. In our case, ﬁrms were involved in both self-initiated
systems and systems initiated by their suppliers. Thus, the proportion approach
was deemed as more appropriate, because it reﬂects the ﬁrm as the focal unit of
analysis.

The extent to which information systems internal to the ﬁrm are integrated
captures internal integration. This is similar to the concept of internally integrated
supply chain. It goes beyond context-speciﬁc conceptualization (Truman, 2000),
and captures the extent to which the ﬁrm has network facilities to boost connectivity,
and the extent to which sharing of databases across functional areas is enabled
within the ﬁrm.

Competitive intensity was measured in terms of the intensity of rivalry among
ﬁrms in the industry and employed the scale used by Boulding and Staelin (1990).
Competitive rivalry depicts the extent of brand switching, level of market growth,
variance in the size of competition, number of players in the industry, frequency
of introduction of new products, and level of exit costs (Boulding & Staelin, 1990;
Grover, 1993). We measured competitive intensity as the extent to which the ﬁrm
perceives its competition to be intense and the extent to which it competes to retain
its market share. The main objective in using this measurement approach was to
focus on the extent to which the ﬁrm is pressured by its environmental conditions
to be efﬁcient.

The type of product being produced by the company was used to capture
product characteristics. The single-item scale ranged from manufacturing stan-
dard products at one end to manufacturing customized products at the other.
This scheme is consistent with the product-process matrix paradigm prevalent
in OM literature. In addition, Saﬁzadeh et al. (2000) have also used a simi-
lar approach in their study to measure the extent of product standardization or
customization.

Data Sources and Method
Standard and Poor’s Corporation Description (Standard and Poor’s Corporation,
1999) was used to select vice presidents of manufacturing or operations as key
target respondents for the study. The main reason for their selection is based on
their position in the organization and knowledge of issues related to coordination
with the suppliers, and the use of information technology in managing their supplier
relationships.

Manufacturing ﬁrms in the rubber, plastics, and metal fabrication industries
constituted our sample frame. Only companies with sales of $50 million or higher
were included in the sample in order to ensure that ﬁrms of sufﬁcient size that were
likely users of an IOS system were considered. Lists of ﬁrms in the Standard In-
dustrial Classiﬁcations (SIC) 30 (rubber and plastics) and 34 (metal products) were
obtained from the Harris manufacturers directory (Dun & Bradstreet Inc., 2002). A
total of 600 ﬁrms were randomly selected for large-scale data collection. In the ﬁrst
round of mailings, a survey questionnaire was mailed to these 600 companies; 11
questionnaires were returned due to address changes. After a few weeks, follow-up
telephone calls were made to a random sample of non-respondents. In the second
round, 111 additional questionnaires were mailed to companies randomly selected
within the same sample frame. From a total of 700 questionnaires thus mailed, 110
were completed and returned, thereby providing a response rate of approximately
16%. Out of these 110 responses, 39 companies had established electronic links
with their suppliers (one ﬁrm was dropped later due to incomplete information).
While small, an IOS adoption rate of 35% (39/110) represented in our sample
is typically representative of the adoption rate of IOS systems reported in other
studies (Chwelos et al., 2001).

Previous research suggests that one way to test for non-response bias is to
compare early and late respondents (Newman, 1962). Tests conducted to compare
study variables between early and late respondents showed only internal integration

(p = .008) to be signiﬁcantly different. It has also been suggested that late and
non-respondents show similar characteristics (Newman, 1962). Tests showed no
signiﬁcant difference in sales volume (p = .22) between early and late respondents,
thereby conﬁrming to a certain extent that non-response bias was not an issue in
our sample. Data from the 38 companies that had established electronic linkages
were used for testing the research framework. The sales proﬁle of the sample ﬁrms
is shown in Table 2.

Construct Reliability and Validity
As described previously, some constructs were measured using objective data,
while measures for other constructs were adapted from previous studies. Table 3
shows the mean values and standard deviations of all the variables and performance
measures, while Table 4 presents the reliability and ﬁrst-order correlations among
the variables. Cronbach α values were found to be within the acceptable range. Data
were also tested for conformance to conducting ordinary least squares regression.
We found no outlying observations, no multicollinearity among the variables, and
no violation of the assumption about constant variance of error terms (Neter, Kutner,
Nachtsheim, & Wasserman, 1990).

Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems

Table 5 provides the results for exploratory factor analysis with Varimax
rotation for those variables that were measured by multi-item scales. Distinct fac-
tors pertaining to competitive intensity, internal integration, process efﬁciency, and
sourcing leverage were obtained with little evidence of cross-loading. One mea-
surement item capturing sourcing leverage cross-loaded on internal integration
(Table 5). Cross-loadings raise issues regarding discriminant validity. However,
these constructs are conceptually distinct; one is an antecedent, while the other is a
dependent variable. This minimizes the seriousness of the problem as compared to
cross-loadings between items that constitute only independent variables. The re-
sults show that the scales displayed acceptable levels of convergent validity (high
items loading on the construct) and reliability.

RESULTS

Three models were speciﬁed in order to test the hypotheses. These models use
regression analysis, clustering, and use of non-parametric tests. Models 1 and 2 are
used to test H1–H5, while Model 3 tests H6 and H7.

Proposed Research Models

Model 2

where PE = Process Efﬁciency, SL = Sourcing Leverage, II = Internal Inte-
gration, EI (L1) (L2) = External Integration, IOB = IOS Breadth, and IOI = IOS
Initiation.

To test for differences in external integration and process efﬁciency between
organizations facing varying conditions of competitive intensity and product char-
acteristics, the sample was segmented into groups. Cluster analysis was used for
identiﬁcation of group membership. The driving factor in using cluster analysis
was to identify groups that would be as heterogeneous as possible in terms of
competitive intensity and product characteristics. Once distinct groups were iden-
tiﬁed, we could then test for differences between the groups on variables of interest
(i.e., external integration and process efﬁciency). First, hierarchical cluster analysis
was used to identify the number of groups. The solution based on Ward’s method
(Sharma, 1996) suggested a two-group solution to be appropriate (Table 6). The
results were compared to the group assignments obtained through non-hierarchical
clustering. The comparison between the group assignments suggested by the two
procedures revealed a 93% agreement on group membership. Due to small sam-
ple size within each group, we used the Mann Whitney test (Conover, 1999) (a
non-parametric test) to test for differences. Conover (1999) argues that the asymp-
totic relative efﬁciency of the Mann Whitney test is never bad as compared to the
two-sample t test. Thus, the Mann-Whitney test is more reliable.

Model Results
Model 1 focuses on evaluating the impact of IOS facets on process efﬁciency.
Table 7 provides the results for Model 1. The results show support for the positive
inﬂuence of External Integration Level 2 (p = .008) and IOS initiation (p < .005)

on process efﬁciency, thus supporting H2 and partially supporting H1 after ac-
counting for the variance explained by internal integration. Model 2 investigates
the impact of IOS characteristics on sourcing leverage (Table 8). The results show
signiﬁcant relationship between IOS breadth and sourcing leverage (p < .001), and
IOS initiation and sourcing leverage (p = .017), thus supporting H4 and H5. The
relationship between external integration and sourcing leverage, although negative,
is not signiﬁcant. Thus, H3 was not supported. Overall, the results point toward
differential impact of IOS facets on performance. In addition, if the ﬁrm initiated
the electronic links, it is able not only to enhance process efﬁciency but also to
increase sourcing leverage. The results of the regression analysis show that R2 for
the two models is .365 and .387, respectively, which falls in the medium-size effect.
The observed power for the overall regression analysis is computed at .90 and .91,
above the recommended guideline of .80 (Cohen, 1988).

Model 3 examines differences in external integration and process efﬁciency
between groups facing different levels of competitive intensity and producing
products with different characteristics (Table 9). Group 1 contains ﬁrms operating

Group 2 includes companies operating in low competitive intensity conditions and
producing customized products. The results for external integration use show that
Group 1 had signiﬁcantly higher External Integration Level 2 and process efﬁ-
ciency than Group 2. However, the difference in External Integration Level 1 was
not signiﬁcant.

DISCUSSION

IOS are becoming a dominant technology that impacts the management and execu-
tion of boundary-spanning activities that ﬁrms undertake to manage relationships
with suppliers. Our study proposes that the various facets of IOS need to be taken
into consideration when exploring these impacts. The study found that the level
of external integration is an important determinant of process efﬁciency. However,
it is evident from the analysis that a ﬁrm needs more than a traditional ordering
system or a procurement system to enhance efﬁciency. An integrated IOS that not
only automates the ordering process but also enables the ﬁrms to undertake joint
planning and forecasting is pivotal for gaining efﬁciency beneﬁts.

This logic is also supported by research in the supply chain area, in which
researchers have consistently found that extensive sharing of information enhances
performance (Cachon & Fisher, 2000; Krajewski & Wei, 2000). Cachon and Fisher
(2000) argue that within a supply chain context, open information exchange pol-
icy can allow organizations to reduce batch sizes and also reduce lead times for
material ﬂows. Increasing the information exchange between buyers and suppliers
on multiple levels such as planning, ordering, and inventories can result in signif-
icant process improvements. Thus, external integration at a higher level can sup-
port better management of collaborative relationships and enable ﬁrms to achieve
higher efﬁciency. However, external integration was not related to sourcing lever-
age, whereas a negative relationship was predicted. A plausible reason for such a
ﬁnding could be due to two countervailing forces at work. On one hand, integration
as argued earlier may increase switching costs, thereby reducing sourcing lever-
age for the buyer. On the other hand, powerful buyers who drive integration may
increase information visibility and compel suppliers to change their processes and
information-sharing routines. This could in turn increase sourcing leverage for the
buyer. The positive correlation between process efﬁciency and sourcing leverage
(Table 4) may indicate support for this perspective. While our data do not have the
granularity to separate these effects, the dyadic power structure could affect this
relationship.

Results show a positive association between IOS breadth and sourcing lever-
age. Establishing links with a large number of potential suppliers allows a ﬁrm to
gather market intelligence and explore alternative sources of supply (Bakos, 1991;
Choudhury et al., 1998). The predominant impact of this facet of IOS, therefore, is
on search-related activities that enable a ﬁrm to expand the alternatives that are con-
sidered and enhance sourcing leverage. These results support the brokerage effect
of IOS. The signiﬁcant results for IOS initiation are in line with previous studies.
As an initiator of the IOS, the ﬁrm has control over the design of the system. Hwang
et al. (1993) found that initiators carefully planned the IOS and, therefore, were


388

able to achieve greater beneﬁts. Thus, structuring of the system by implementing
functionalities may enable ﬁrms to enhance both process efﬁciencies and sourcing
leverage over the suppliers.

Due to increases in outsourcing activity in recent years, ﬁrms are relatively
more dependent on their suppliers. Performance in terms of cost, quality, and
customer responsiveness to some extent depends on the supplier base of a ﬁrm.
Within this context, results for the joint role of competitive intensity and product
standardization on IOS use (to support supply chain management activities) por-
tray an interesting picture. As shown in Table 9, we found that Group 1 (standard
product/high competitive intensity) gained signiﬁcantly higher process efﬁciencies
and also depicted higher levels of external integration as compared to Group 2 (cus-
tomized products/low competitive intensity). Firms operating in highly competitive
environments and producing standardized products need to consistently focus on
process improvements to reduce costs and stay competitive. A plausible approach
in such conditions is to closely integrate activities with the supplier base (Zhu
& Kraemer, 2002). This constitutes an effective interorganizational structural re-
sponse to reducing slack in the supply chain.

Firms in Group 1 have more to gain from sharing planning, scheduling, and
inventory information with the suppliers. For example, the link between Wal-Mart
and Warner-Lambert for a product such as Listerine provides an illustration in this
regard (Bresnahan, 1998; Manugistics Inc., 2003). Both companies extensively
use information technology in managing this relationship and thereby gain process
efﬁciencies.

The case of DDM plastics, a company producing bumpers and instrumental
panels for automotives, provides further insights into the results. The company was
founded in 1989 in Ontario, Canada and employs 600 employees (Agilisys Inc.,
2000). DDM produces relatively standardized products and operates in a highly
competitive environment. These conditions pose consistent pressure on margins.
On the other hand, producing standard products means that plans and forecasts
are relatively accurate. Thus, DDM provides a good case in which a supply chain
optimization approach can lead to process efﬁciencies.

DDM identiﬁed that it had to keep a high level of safety stock due to lack
of information sharing with the suppliers. In addition, data accuracy was severely
compromised due to manual exchange of documents and reentry of data. This
also led to lack of trust on information residing in the internal system and redun-
dant coordination through exchange of faxes between DDM and its suppliers. The
company realized that efﬁciency gains could be achieved by using IOS to support
collaborative practices with the suppliers. In 1999, the company introduced a sys-
tem called SupplyWEB. It was an Internet-based system that was managed by the
company and totally integrated with its enterprise resource planning (ERP) sys-
tem. The suppliers could access the SupplyWEB through a standard Web browser.
The system enabled the suppliers to access planning information, purchasing infor-
mation, material releases, in-transit information, cumulative receipt information,
defective part notices, purchase part approval status, Kanban pull signal, and ship-
ment history. The system also enabled the suppliers to send corrective action plans,
shipment information, and advanced shipment notices. Integration between Sup-
plyWEB and DDM’s ERP system allowed automatic data exchange between the

two systems. The reduction in data entry errors and automation of the purchasing
processes allowed DDM to signiﬁcantly reduce transactions costs. The high level
of information sharing allowed DDM to lower its inventory levels and also reduce
uncertainty in lead times. For example, advanced shipment notices (ASN) sent by
the suppliers alerted DDM regarding which order would arrive at what time. Once
the order arrived, bar codes were scanned and that information was automatically
matched with the ASN. Thus, SupplyWEB enabled DDM to optimize supply chain
processes through supporting collaborative practices with its suppliers. DDM has
plans to add additional functionalities that would allow the company to share other
critical information with its suppliers.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO PRACTICE AND RESEARCH

Our study shows that higher levels of external integration and IOS initiation sig-
niﬁcantly contribute toward enhancing process efﬁciencies, while IOS breadth and
IOS initiation allow ﬁrms to gain sourcing leverage over their suppliers. Firms can
squeeze out slack from the dyadic linkage by increasing the intensity of interaction
and bidirectional information ﬂows through external integration. Higher levels of
IOS breadth may enable ﬁrms to gather market intelligence and compare different
options and thus gain sourcing leverage. We also provide evidence that ﬁrms pro-
ducing standardized products and facing a highly competitive environment can gain
process efﬁciency by using IOS with higher levels of external integration, while
merely linking at a lower level through simple procurement systems will not sufﬁce
in meeting the stated objective. Cumulatively, the results support our hypotheses
that various facets of IOS allow ﬁrms to achieve different performance objectives
related to buyer–supplier relationships. Managers need to carefully consider the
underlying objectives they intend to achieve by employing various facets of IOS
to support relationships with their suppliers.

It has been argued that using IOS to institute multiple trading mechanisms
may allow organizations to quickly tailor systems to their transactional needs
(Kambil et al., 1999). This is a complex issue. Firms may be able to increase
sourcing leverage by electronically linking with potential suppliers to gain market
intelligence. However, process improvements can be achieved only if sufﬁcient
depth in electronic links is established through integrated systems that support ex-
tensive information ﬂows. Recommendations offered here can assist managers in
recognizing the various facets of IOS and making appropriate decisions regarding
the adoption and use of IOS that offer different functionalities.

While the results of our study point toward the heterogeneity in IOS use,
generalization of these ﬁndings outside the industries represented in the sample
frame should be done cautiously. Researchers investigating adoption and impact of
IOS also need to broaden their conceptualization of IOS to include a much broader
repertoire of the latest Web-based procurement systems and supplier relationship
management systems. This will not only enrich our understanding of various facets
of IOS, but also will lead to more speciﬁc insights and prescriptive implications.
For example, the study by Hart and Saunders (1998) investigated two facets of
EDI use, and found that different factors affect each facet. Similarly, researchers
endeavoring to explore adoption and impact of Web-based procurement systems


390

Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems

need to give due consideration to the functionalities of such systems. In addition,
future studies can build on this work by exploring the differences between IOS use
and their impacts based on Fine’s (1998) notion of environmental dynamism called
clockspeed and Fisher’s (1997) categorization of functional versus innovative prod-
ucts. Another interesting issue that can be addressed is to simultaneously explore
the performance impact of information systems and organizational based mecha-
nisms, and determine whether one substitutes for or synergistically reinforces the
other. [Received: August 2003. Accepted: March 2005.]
