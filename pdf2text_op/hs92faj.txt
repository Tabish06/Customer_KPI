conclusions of the study,  are not
inconsistent with the interest rate
parity theorem.  The latter relates
interest rate differentials between
pairs of countries to a one-point
market estimate of expected ex-
change rate movements,  as opposed
to historical volatilities arourid a
mean value, which are treated
here.

change value of all the future cash
fiows of a foreign bond on their
respective payment dates effectively

transforms the bond into a  US-
dollar asset—that is,  one sensitive
to the U.S.  interest rate environ-
ment.  Except for  tbe rare case of a
temporary yield advantage,  this de-
feats the purpose of foreign bond
investing. Instead,  short-dated for-
wards can be used to hedge the
foreign exchange risk,  while retain-
ing the foreign interest rate expo-
sure of the bond.  In  "Measuring the
Risk of Foreign Bonds," op. cit., 1
describe this strategy and estimate
the remaining risk due to the lack
of a perfect hedge.

Size  Effects  in  the  Market Valuation  of  Fundamental  Factors

Mark Hirschey, School of
Business, University of
Kansas and  Richard S.
Spencer,  Concord Capital
Management

Cash fiow, growth, risk
(beta), research and devel-
opment  and advertising
expenditures are all key
fundamental  factors that
help determine the  eamings
prospects of  individual
companies. This note dem-
onstrates how the market
valuation  of these funda-
mental factors  varies over
firm-size classes during the
different economic  condi-
tions and  market environ-
ments of the 16-year period
1975-90.  The results offer
useful input  to the prospects
for  small-capitalization
stocks in the 1990s.

Information  about  cash  flow,
growth and risk (beta) offers use-
ful insights into a firm's profit and
dividend  potential.  As  a  result,
such fundamental  factors  have an
important influence  on the firm's
current  market  valuation.  This
note  considers  the  extent  to
which  firm  size  influences  the

market  valuation  of  fundamental
factors.

The Potential for Size  Effects
Growth-stock  investors  expect  a
firm's life  cycle  to  follow  a pre-
dictable  pattern  of  rapid  growth,
maturation  and  decline.  Accord-
ing to this view, a relatively large
portion  of  the  market  value  of
smaller  firms  is  determined  by
growth  opportunities,  whereas
the value  of  large firms is  more
closely  related  to  cash  flows  de-
rived from assets in place. Impor-
tant  size-based  differences  in  the
market  valuations  of  cash  flow
and  growth  opportunities  would
be consistent with this view.

Size  effects  have  already  been
detected  in  the  market  valuation
of risk factors. Using a multifac-
tor  pricing  model,  Chan  and
Chen  provide  evidence  that  the
higher average retums earned by
small-cap  stocks  can  be  justified
by their idiosyncratic risks.^ Their
results suggest that the commonly
reported  "abnormal"  retums  to
small-cap  stocks  arise  from  the
feilure of traditional valuation ap-
proaches  to  reflect  the  multidi-
mensional risk attributes of small-
cap stocks.

Size effects may also influence the
market  valuation  of  less  com-
monly  recognized  fundamental
factors  such  as  research  and  de-
velopment (R&D) and advertising
expenditures. Recent studies sug-

gest  that  small  firms  (spending
less  than  $2  million  on  R&D)
appear  more  efficient  than  their
larger  competitors,  in  that  they
are  able  to  generate  a  relatively
larger number of patents per dol-
lar of R&D expenditure.^ This is a
controversial  conclusion,  how-
ever, given differences  in propen-
sities to patent between small and
large firms. The success of many
small high-tech firms may depend
on  patents,  and  they  can  be  ex-
pected to pursue patent opportu-
nities vigorously. Few large, well-
established  firms  depend  upon
continuing patenting activity.

Similarly,  a  size-based  compari-
son of the market value effects of
advertising  expenditures  may  of-
fer  interesting  evidence  on  the
importance of size to market val-
uation. Economists  have long ar-
gued  that economies of scale de-
rived  from  the  advantages  of
promotion  in  large  geographic
markets  and  the  large-scale  pur-
chase  of  media  services  create
significant  advantages  for  large
firms.^ Unlike  the  case  of R&D,
where a positive small-firm  differ-
ential is possible, a positive large-
firm  differential  is expected in the
case  of  the  market  valuation  of
advertising expenditures.

Data and Method

For  the  16-year  period  1975-90,
we looked at data from the annual
Compustat  industrial,  full  cover-
age and research tapes, assuming

u

a 90-day reporting lag. All data are
thus  as  of  the  end  of  the first
quarter  (April  30).  The  overall
sample  is limited  to those firms
having a market  value of at least
$100  million  (share  price  times
shares  outstanding,  price-ad-
justed  to 4/30/86)  to ensure  data
comparability  over  time  and to
minimize  any  problems  caused
by  reporting  errors  and lack of
liquidity among very small firms.
For  example,  R&D  expenditures
of  less  than  |1  million  need not
be  disclosed  under  current  ac-
counting requirements, and a dis-
quieting increase in reporting er-
rors  is  likely  should  very  small
firms  (less than $100 million mar-
ket value) be considered. To min-
imize the effects  of reporting er-
rors  in  market  value  and  cash
fiow  data,  we  truncated  a  few
(generally five to 10) outliers per
year at three standard deviations.

We  divided  all  the  companies
with  complete  data  that  passed
the  valuation  screen  into  three
separate groups based upon their
market-value  rankings.  In 1990,
for example, the small-size group
includes  all  sample  companies
with  market  values  below  $263
million,  the  medium-size  group
includes those firms with  market
values  between  $263  and  $948
million, and the large-size group
includes firms with market values
in  excess  of  $948  million. The
1990 mean  market  value  is  $167
million for small-size firms, $508
million  for  medium-size  firms,
$4.9  billion  for  large-size  firms
and $1.9 billion for all companies.

The small-size group  considered
in  this  study  is  well  above  the
smallest  quintile of firms consid-
ered by Banz and other studies of
size  effects  on  stock  returns."*
Standard & Poor's new 400-stock
MidCap index includes what S&P
regards as medium-sized  compa-
nies with  1991 market values be-
tween  $200 and $5 billion.^ Both
the  small  and  medium-size
groups  considered  in  this  study
correspond  roughly  with  what
S&P regards as mid-cap stocks.

We measure market  valuation by
relative  excess  valuation—the
market  value  of  common  stock
minus  stockholders'  equity, both
normalized  by sales. Relative ex-
cess  valuation  consistently  re-
flects  the relative  difference  be-
tween  market  and  accounting
values  over  large  cross-section
samples of firms. The 1990 mean
for  the normalized  excess valua-
tion  variable  is  1.120 for  small
firms,  0.944  for  medium  firms,
0.771 for large firms and 0.941 for
the overall sample.

We measure cash flow as the sum
of net income  plus  depreciation
plus  deferred  taxes,  all  normal-
ized by sales. We use a three-year
average to minimize transitory in-
fiuences.  Anticipated  growth
should  have  a positive  effect  on
market value if future investments
are  expected  to  earn  above-
normal rates of return and if such
growth  is an important  determi-
nant  of  these  investments.  We
measure expected growth using a
composite  factor  developed  by
BARRA, Inc. and based on histor-
ical five-year changes  in tangible
assets,  earnings,  payout  ratio,
sales  and  yield,  plus  earnings
growth  projections  provided  by
the Institutional Brokers Estimate
System (IBES). The growth  factor
is normalized with a mean of zero
and a range of -1-5 to - 5, where
higher-growth  companies  have a
growth  factor  greater  than  zero.
We measure risk using a multidi-
mensional historical  fundamen-
tal  beta  factor  provided  by
BARRA,  Inc.  This  risk  measure
seeks  to  reduce  risk  estimation
error  by allowing for changes in
the  operation  of  the  firm  that
have  affected  its underlying  risk
posture. Among the fundamental
infiuences  considered  are  the
variance  of cash  flows,  earnings
covariability,  eamings/price  ratio
covariability, and growih in earn-
ings per share and assets.

Finally, we consider the effects of
R&D and advertising to allow for
potentially  long-lived  influences
on the size, duration and stability
of  future  cash fiows. Both R&D

Results

Tables  I through  V illustrate the
effect  of firm size on the market
valuation  of each  respective fun-
damental  factor  over  each sub-
sample of companies.^ Cash fiow
is important in each period and in
each  size  class,  except  for small
firms during  1978 and 1990. The
relevance of cash fiow to market
valuation  is obvious,  as is a  pat-
tern  of differences  in the valua-
tion  of  cash  flow  across  size
classes. In  10 of 16 periods, the
market  appears  to  place  a  rela-
tively greater weight on the cash
fiow  numbers  reported  by me-
dium versus small firms. No similar
difference is apparent for medium
versus  large  firms.  Valuation  of
cash  fiow is  typically  higher for
large  than  for  small firms, how-
ever, and the difference  is statisti-
cally  significant  in  seven  of 16
periods. This suggests that factors
describing expected cash flow are
somewhat  more  important  for
large than for small  firms.

The market valuation of growth is
surprisingly  consistent  across size


classes. The  effects  of  the  multidi
mensional growth factor on market
valuation  are  uniformly  positive
and of a consistent order of magni-
tude  across  small,  medium  and
lai^e  firms.  These  results  contra-
dict  the  notion  that  a  relatively
greater portion of the market value
of  small  firms  is accounted  for  by
growth  opportunities,  while  a
greater portion of the value of lar^e
firms is accounted  for  by assets in
place.

As might be anticipated  from  pre-
vious  research  on  the  relevance
of multifactor  pricing models, the
advantages  of  measuring  risk  us-
ing  a fundamental  beta  approach
are  most  apparent  in  the  case  of
small  firms.  Fundamental  beta  is
closely  related  to  the  market  val-
uation  of  small  firms  in  12 of  16
periods.  Conversely,  a  significant
negative  link  between  risk  and
market valuation  for medium  and
large firms occurs during only six
of  16  periods.  Statistically  speak-
ing,  the  influence  of  the  funda-
mental  beta  risk  factor  on  market
value  is  relatively  more  negative
for  small  than  for  medium  firms
and  for  medium  than  for  large
firms  in  six  of  16  instances.  It  is
more  negative  for  small  than  for
large  firms  in  10  of  16  periods.
These  findings  support  the  hy-
pothesis that the higher returns to
investments  in small firms can  be
justified  by the additional  idiosyn-
cratic  risks  that  are  captured  by a
multidimensional 
fundamental
beta  approach.

The  relevance  of  R&D to  market
valuation  within  each  size class is
clearly  apparent,  as  are  striking
differences  in  the  market  valua-
tion  of  R&D expenditures  across
size  classes.  In  10  of  16  periods,
the  market  valuation  of  R&D  is
greater for medium  than for  large
firms.  In  no  instance  is  the  con-
verse  (altemative)  hypothesis  of
large-firm  superiority  supported.
In  11  of  16  periods,  the  market
valuation  of  R&D  is  greater  for
small than  for large firms. In  only

valuation of R&D for small versus
medium firms is apparent, overall
results clearly do not support the
notion of large-firm superiority in
R&D effectiveness.  R&D appears
to  be  an  important  factor  in  the
valuation of firms of all sizes, but
is vitally important for small com-
panies.  These  results  may  imply
that the risk-reducing benefits  of-
fered  by  patent  protection  are
especially  important  to  small
firms.  Altematively,  the  market
may  place  a  relatively  higher
value  on  small  firms  wliose
growth  options  are  specifically
tied to R&D expenditures.

In contrast to the uniformly posi-
tive  market  value  effects  of  cash
fiow, growth  and  R&D, advertis-
ing  expenditures  seem  relevant
only in the case of large firms. In
12 of 16 periods, advertising has a
strongly positive infiuence on the
market value of large firms. Sim-
ilar  effects  are  observed  in  only
one of  16 periods for small firms
and  in  only  three  of  16  periods
for medium companies. These re-
sults suggest that the market value
effect  of advertising  is much  less
consistent than the effects of R&D
and  other  more  commonly  per-
ceived fundamental  factors..

Conclusions

Two main  conclusions  seem  rel-
evant.  First,  the  market  value  ef-
fects  of  fundamental  factors  are
surprisingly  consistent  over  an
extended  period  of  widely vary-
ing interest rates and general eco-
nomic conditions. Second, the in-
fiuences  of  fundamental  factors
appear to be affected by firm size.
More specifically,

•  cash  flow  is  important  in
each  period  and  each  size
class, but it is most important
for  relatively large  firms;

•  growth has a uniformly posi-
tive  market-value  infiuence
on  small, medium  and  large
firms;

•  the link between  fundamen-
tal  beta  and  market  value  is
strong for small firms but not
for  medium  and large firms,
suggesting that retums to in-
vesting  in  small  firms  may
indeed  be  affected  by  idio-
syncratic  risks;

•  R&D has a dramatic effect  on
the  market  values  of all size
classes, but its strength is in-
versely related to firm size;

•  advertising  expenditures
have a durable effect on mar-
ket value only in the case of
large  firms.^

7.  On a theoretical level, sales normal-
ization may create problems because
adveriising expenditures can exert
an  independent influence on rruirket
value and sales revenues  However,
no significant problem is apparent
in this study;  normalization using
accounting book value numbers
yields virtually identical results. Also
see Hirschey,  "Market Structure," op.
cit.

8.  Taken as a whole,  the explanatory
variables as a group are able to ex-
plain an average 32.1% of the an-
nual  variation in excess valuation
within the overall sample.  Using a
one-tailed F-test,  the level of explana-
tion provided as measured by the
coefficient of determination is easily
significant at the 1% level during
each year of the 1975-90 period.  In
terms of individual coefficient esti-
mates for  the overall sample,  the ef-
fects of cashflow, growth and R&D
are positive and statistically signifi-
cant (at the 1% level)  in all 16 peri-
ods. Advertising intensity has the ex-
pected positive effect in only six of 16
periods whereas risk has tbe expected
negative influence in  13 of 16 peri-
ods (both at the 5% level). Direc-
tional t-tests are also conducted for
hypotheses that the marginal effect
(slope coefficient) of each fundamen-
tal factor  in the market value equa-
tion is equal across relevant pairs of
small-cap vs.  medium-cap,  medium-
cap vs.  large-cap,  and small-cap vs.
large-cap firms. A positive and signif-
icant t-statistic implies that the rele-
vant coefficient is greater for  a given
size class.  Complete results are avail-
able on request.
