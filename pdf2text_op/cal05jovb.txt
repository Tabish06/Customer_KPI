Abstract

This study examined the mediating inXuence of trust in organization (TIO) and organiza-
tion-based  self-esteem  (OBSE)  on  the  relationship  between  perceived  organization  support
(POS) and its work outcomes. Data were obtained from employee–supervisor dyads from multi-
ple organizations located in a major city in southern China. Structural equation modeling results
revealed that: (a) POS related to TIO and OBSE and (b) TIO and OBSE fully mediated the rela-
tionship between POS and the work outcomes of organizational commitment and in-role per-
formance, but partially mediated the POS–organizational citizenship behavior relationship.

1. Introduction

Much research on the employment relationship is predicated on the view that it
constitutes an employee’s trade of eVort and loyalty for tangible beneWts (e.g., pay)

and  social  rewards  (e.g.,  self-esteem)  obtained  from  the  organization  (March  &
Simons,  1958;  Mowday,  Porter,  &  Steers,  1982).  This  view  dovetails  with  social
exchange  theory  which  explains  the  formation  and  maintenance  of  interpersonal
relationships in terms of the reciprocation of valued resources between two interact-
ing individuals (Blau, 1964; Gouldner, 1960). Increasingly, social exchange theory has
provided  the  conceptual  lens  with  which  to  view  the  employment  relationship.  A
major social exchange mechanism in an organizational context is perceived organiza-
tional support (POS). Eisenberger and his associates (Eisenberger, Fasolo, & Davis –
LaMastro,  1990;  Eisenberger,  Huntington,  Hutchison,  &  Sowa,  1986)  coined  the
term POS to describe employees’ “global beliefs concerning the extent to which the
organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being.” A steady
stream  of  research  has  since  provided  evidence  linking  POS  to  myriad  employee
work outcomes such as organizational commitment, job satisfaction, reduced turn-
over, job performance, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) (Eisenberger
et al., 1990: Moorman, Blakely, & NiehoV, 1998; Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002; Set-
toon, Bennett, & Liden, 1996; Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997).

However, much of this research adopted a direct or main eVect approach prompt-
ing  Armeli,  Eisenberger,  Fasolo,  and  Lynch  (1998,  p.  289)  to  comment  that  “less
attention has been given to the mechanisms presumed to underlie the positive rela-
tionship  between  POS  and  work-related  outcomes.”  Since  Armeli  et  al.’s  (1998)
observation,  only  a  few  studies  have  examined  the  mechanisms  that  underpin  the
relationship between POS and its demonstrated work outcomes. Eisenberger, Armeli,
Rexwinkel,  Lynch,  and  Rhoades  (2001)  and  Whitener  (2001)  reported  support  for
the  social  exchange-based  mediators  of  felt  obligation  and  trust  in  management,
respectively. The importance of the employee–organization relationship in a chang-
ing employment context coupled with the demonstrated outcomes of POS (Rhoades
& Eisenberger, 2002) suggest a need for research to continue to examine the mecha-
nisms through which POS inXuences these work outcomes. Accordingly, the current
study examined the mediating inXuences of trust in organization (TIO) and organiza-
tion-based self-esteem (OBSE) on the relationship between POS and the work out-
comes  of  organizational  commitment, 
in-role  performance,  and  OCB.  The
hypothesized mediators stem from the organization’s treatment of its employees. As
indicators  of  the  quality  of  the  employee–organization  relationship,  they  are  more
proximal  to  the  work  outcomes  and  should  therefore  mediate  the  relationship
between POS and the work outcomes examined in the current study.

Although much research on POS has been done in the West, research on POS in
collectivistic cultures is still very limited (Yoon & Lim, 1999). Accordingly, we con-
ducted the current study in China to ascertain the applicability of POS theory to the
Eastern collectivistic cultures.

2. Literature review and hypotheses

As noted earlier, POS has been found to be related to myriad employee work out-
comes (Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002). Based on the extant literature, we expect POS

459

to  be  related  to  the  work  outcomes  of  organizational  commitment,  in-role  perfor-
mance and OCB. This is because the organization’s favorable treatment of employees
engenders feelings of obligation to reciprocate or equalize the exchange by demon-
strating positive work attitudes and behaviors that beneWt the organization. The pos-
itive  association  between  POS  and  work  outcomes  may  come  from  the  emotional
resources  provided  by  the  work  context.  Kahn  (1993)  suggests  that  the  extent  to
which co-workers are care-givers or care-seekers relative to one another shapes their
abilities to perform their roles eVectively. To the extent that the organization cares to
fulWll  employees’  needs,  promoting  their  best  interests,  and  valuing  their  contribu-
tion, employees develop trust and self-worth that are beneWcial to the organization.

2.1. The mediating role of trust in organization

Trust has been deWned as a “psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability  based  upon  positive  expectations  of  the  intention  or  behavior  of
another” (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). Employees have been noted to
distinguish between two trust referents (a) speciWc individuals or groups (e.g., super-
visor and co-workers) and (b) generalized representatives (e.g., employer). Research
that has focused on the latter has used trust in management and trust in employer or
organization interchangeably (Whitener, 1997). POS and trust in organization (TIO)
represent distinct but related constructs. POS stems from the tendency of employees
to ascribe dispositional traits to the organization (Eisenberger et al., 1986; Levinson,
1965). Consequently, the favorable treatment employees receive at the hands of rep-
resentatives of the organization are ascribed to the organization and interpreted as
evidence of the organization’s care and concern about their well-being. As reciprocal
acts of beneWt which are not negotiated, social exchange entails risk and uncertainty
because  the  exchange  partner  might  never  or  only  minimally  reciprocate  beneWts
received.  This  makes  trust  an  essential  condition  for  the  establishment  of  social
exchange. Blau (1964, p. 94) noted that “since there is no way to assure an appropri-
ate return for a favor, social exchange requires trusting others to discharge their obli-
gations.”  Eisenberger  et  al.  (1990,  p.  57)  argued  that  POS  “creates  trust  that  the
organization will fulWll its exchange obligation of noticing and rewarding employee
eVorts made on its behalf.” Whitener (2001) reported POS to be related to trust in
management.  An  organization’s  care  and  concern  about  the  well-being  of  an
employee will convey information about the organization’s benevolence and good-
will  leading  to  perceptions  of  its  trustworthiness  in  the  eyes  of  the  employee.  We
therefore, expect POS to be related to trust in organization.

Hypothesis 1a. POS relates positively to trust in organization.

Informed by the norm of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960), Dirks and Ferrin (2002)
posited  a  relationship-oriented  explanation  of  the  inXuence  of  trust  on  employee
work outcomes. They argued that a relationship-oriented explanation is based on an
individual’s  willingness  to  reciprocate  care  and  consideration  expressed  by  a  focal
partner.  Accordingly,  employees  who  perceive  the  organization  as  demonstrating


460

Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

care and consideration for their well-being reciprocate this sentiment in the form of
positive work outcomes that beneWt the organization. TIO has been shown to be pos-
itively  related  to organizational  commitment  and OCB  (Aryee,  Budhwar, &  Chen,
2002;  Gopinath  &  Becker,  2000;  Robinson,  1996;  Whitener,  2001).  Given  that  a
social exchange relationship is characterized by mutual loyalty, good-will and sup-
port, and as a manifestation of social exchange, we expect trust in organization to
mediate the relationship between POS and the work outcomes examined (cf., Konov-
sky & Pugh, 1994).

Hypothesis 1b. TIO mediates the relationship between POS and the work outcomes
of organizational commitment, in-role performance and OCB.

2.2. The mediating role of OBSE

Following the suggestion that the power of an attitude to predict a behavior is a
function  of  how  closely  that  attitude  is  related  to  the  act  in  question  (Fishbein  &
Ajzen,  1975;  Tharenou,  1979),  Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  and  Dunham  (1989)
developed  and  validated  an  organization-speciWc  measure  of  self-esteem  (OBSE).
They deWned OBSE as the “self-perceived value that individuals have of themselves
as organization members acting within an organizational context” (Pierce et al., 1989,
p. 625) . Individuals with high OBSE perceive themselves as trusted, valued, and con-
tributing members of the organization.

A feature of the work environment that may inXuence OBSE is the organization’s
treatment of its employees and the identity relevant information that such a treat-
ment  communicates  to  the  employee.  The  reXected  appraisal  stemming  from  an
employee’s organizational treatment provide the “integrated experiential base upon
which  employee  beliefs  about  self-worth,  including  OBSE,  develop”  (McAllister  &
Bigley, 2001). Further, Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002) proposed that POS may con-
tribute to an employee’s feeling of competence and worth, and by implication OBSE.
Following the preceding logic, we expect POS to be related to OBSE.

Hypothesis 2a. POS relates positively to OBSE.

Although the motivational underpinning of the inXuence of POS on its demon-
strated work outcomes has been explicated in terms of social exchange theory (Eisen-
berger et al., 2002), the self-concept has also been shown to provide the motivational
underpinning of work outcomes (Brief & Aldag, 1981; Gecas, 1982; Korman, 1970;
Leonard, Beauvais, & Scholl, 1999; Shamir, 1991). As a self-concept based motiva-
tional  theory,  OBSE  has  been  found  to  be  related  to  job  performance,  citizenship
behavior (Chattopadhyay, 1999; Pierce et al., 1989; Van Dyne, Vandewalle, Kostova,
Latham, & Cummings, 2000), and organizational commitment (Pierce et al., 1989).
The inXuence of OBSE on its demonstrated outcomes has been explicated in terms of
the fundamental need of human beings to maintain or enhance the phenomenal self.
High OBSE  individuals are likely to develop and maintain positive work attitudes
and  to  exhibit  a  high  level  of  job  performance.  As  a  primary  source  of  their  self-


Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

461

concept, high OBSE individuals will attach a high value to organizational member-
ship leading to high levels of organizational commitment. Similarly, consistent with
their  self-concept  as  valued  and  contributing  members  of  the  organization,  high
OBSE individuals will be more motivated to perform at high levels and to engage in
citizenship behaviors. POS constitutes a situational characteristic that translates into
OBSE, which in turn, serves as a motivational underpinning of the work outcomes
examined in this study.

Hypothesis 2b. OBSE mediates the relationship between POS and the work outcomes
of organizational commitment, in-role performance and OCB.

3. Method

3.1. Sample and procedure

Respondents  were  employees  of  multiple  organizations  enrolled  in  a  part-time
MBA program oVered by a premier Chinese university located in a major city in a
southern province of the People’s Republic of China. Program instructors distributed
questionnaire packages to respondents. Each respondent was also requested to for-
ward a separate questionnaire package to his/her immediate supervisor. A cover let-
ter  was  attached  to both subordinate  and  supervisor  questionnaires  explaining the
objectives  of  the  survey  and  providing  an  assurance  of  the  conWdentiality  of
responses. Stamped self-addressed envelopes were provided for returning completed
questionnaires to the instructors.

A total of 217 completed questionnaires were received from subordinates and 192
from supervisors representing a response rate of 72.3 and 64%, respectively. After delet-
ing records of unmatched supervisor–subordinate pairs, a total of 190 supervisor–sub-
ordinate  dyads  remained  and  constituted  the  sample  for  this  study.  Of  the  190
respondents, 55.2% were men, the average age was 29.52 years (SDD 4.57), the average
organizational tenure was 5.31 years (SDD 4.57) and the average dyad tenure was 3.61
years (SDD 6.53). Respondents reported an average of 15 years education and repre-
sented diverse occupational backgrounds such as accounting/Wnance (11%), sales/mar-
keting  (19.4%),  consumer  services  (12.6%),  human  resources/administration  (14.7%),
production/manufacturing  (10.5%),  research  and  development  (7.3%),  and  computer
systems/engineering (4.6%) while 19% did not indicate their occupational background.
The supervisors reported an average of 34.60 years (SDD 7.32), 15.94 years of edu-
cation (SDD 1.57), and 7.21 years of organizational tenure (SDD 6.95). Twenty-four
percentage of them were Wrst line supervisors, 56.8% middle managers, and 17.7% top
managers. Sixty-nine percentage of the supervisors were men.

3.2. Measures

The survey instrument was in Chinese but was initially constructed in English. To
assure equivalence of the measures in the Chinese and English versions, the survey


462

Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

instrument was translated into Chinese and then back translated independently into
English (Brislin, 1980) by three experienced bilingual researchers. The back transla-
tion procedure helped insure an accurate prose translation that was de-centred from
a literal English language translation (Werner & Campbell, 1970).

3.2.1. POS

A  9-item  shortened  version  of  the  Survey  of  Perceived  Organizational  Support
(Eisenberger et al., 1990; Wayne, Shore, Bommer, & Tetrick, 2002) was used to mea-
sure  POS.  Response  options  ranged  from  (1)  ‘strongly  disagree’  to  (5)  ‘strongly
agree.’ Sample items include “My organization really cares about my well-being” and
“Help is available from my organization when I have a problem.” The scale’s ♡ reli-
ability of .91 in this  study compares favorably to  the .92  reported by Wayne  et al.
(2002).

3.2.2. OBSE

A  10-item  scale  developed  by  Pierce  et  al.  (1989)  was  used  to  measure  OBSE.
Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (7) ‘strongly agree.’ Sample
items are “I count around here” and “I am taken seriously around here.” The scale’s
♡ reliability in this study is .91.

3.2.3. Trust in organization

A 7-item scale by Gabarro and Athos (1978) was used to measure TIO. Response
options  ranged  from  (1)  ‘strongly  disagree’  to  (7)  ‘strongly  agree.’  Sample  items
are “My employer is open and frank with me” and “I can expect my employer to
treat me in a consistent and predictable manner.” The scale’s ♡ reliability in this study
is .93.

3.2.4. In-role performance

A  4-item  scale  by  Farh  and  Cheng  (1999)  was  used  to  measure  in-role  perfor-
mance. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (7) ‘strongly agree.’
Sample items are “This subordinate makes an important contribution to the overall
performance  of  our  work  unit”  and  “This  subordinate  can  always  fulWll  the  jobs
assigned by the supervisor in time.” The scale’s ♡ reliability in this study is .87.

3.2.5. Organizational citizenship behavior

We focused on the OCB dimensions of boosterism and conscientiousness because
they  reXect  our  interest  in  organizationally  directed  citizenship  behaviors  (Master-
son, Lewis, Goldman, & Taylor, 2000). Two separate 3-item scales by Farh, Earley,
and Lin (1997) were used to measure conscientiousness and boosterism (labeled as
identiWcation  in  Farh  et  al.’s  study)  dimensions  of  OCB.  Farh  et  al’s  multidimen-
sional OCB scale was developed in Taiwan but has since been shown to have ade-
quate psychometric properties in the PRC (Chen & Francesco, 2003; Chen, Tsui, &
Farh, 2002; Hui, Law, & Chen, 1999). Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly
disagree’ to (7) ‘strongly agree.’ A sample item for conscientiousness is “This subor-
dinate complies with company rules and procedures even when nobody watches and


Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

463

no evidence can be traced” and for boosterism is “This subordinate makes construc-
tive suggestions that can improve the operation of the company.” The ♡ reliability for
conscientiousness is .79 and for boosterism is .80.

3.2.6. Organizational commitment

An 8-item scale by Allen and Meyer (1990) was used to measure the aVective com-
ponent of organizational commitment. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly
disagree’ to (7) ‘strongly  agree.’ Sample  items  are “I  really feel  as  if  this  organiza-
tion’s problems are my own” and “I feel emotionally attached to this organization.”
The scale’s ♡ reliability in this study is .87.

3.3. Data analysis

A  two-step  procedure  involving  conWrmatory  factor  analysis  (CFA)  and  struc-
tural equation modeling (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988; Medsker, Williams, & Holo-
han, 1994) was employed to test the hypotheses. In the Wrst step, we conducted CFA
to examine the distinctiveness of the variables used in the study. In the second step,
we used a model comparison procedure to evaluate our structural models. Given the
small sample size relative to the measurement items, we adopted procedures used by
previous  researchers  to  reduce  the  number  of  items  (Bagozzi  &  Heatherton,  1994;
Brooke et al., 1988). We reduced the number of items by creating three indicators for
each  construct.  Scores  for  each  indicator  were  then  computed  as  the  mean  of
the scores on the items that constituted each indicator. Data with listwise deletion
of missing values were used for the LISREL analysis resulting in a  Wnal sample size
of 186.

In conducting the CFA, we compared a 7-factor model with three 6-factor models
(6-factor Model 1 to Model 3), a 5-factor model, a 1-factor model, and a null model.
In the 7-factor Model, Wve constructs and two sub-constructs (OCB consists of two
sub-constructs, conscientiousness and boosterism) were treated as seven independent
factors. In the 6-factor Model 1, POS and OBSE items were loaded on one factor. In
the 6-factor Model 2, POS and TIO items were loaded on one factor. In the 6-factor
Model 3, the two OCB dimensions (conscientiousness and boosterism) were loaded
on  one  factor.  In  the  5-factor  Model,  in-role  performance,  conscientiousness,  and
boosterism items were loaded on one factor. In the 1-factor Model, all variables stud-
ied were loaded on one factor.

To test the hypothesized mediating role of OBSE and TIO, we  Wrst assessed the
following conditions for mediation: (a) the independent variable must be related to
the mediator; (b) the independent variable must be related to the dependent variable;
(c) the mediator must be related to the dependent variable; and (d) the independent
variable  must  have  no  eVect  on  the  dependent  variable  when  the  mediator  is  held
constant (full mediation) or should become signiWcantly smaller (partial mediation)
(Baron  &  Kenny,  1986).  We  compared  four  partially  mediated  models  with  the
hypothesized fully mediated model to examine the fourth condition of mediation.

To  assess  model  Wt,  we  used  the  overall  model  chi-square  measure  (♻2),  the
Tucker–Lewis  Index  (TLI,  Tucker &  Lewis, 1973),  the  goodness-of-Wt index  (GFI,


464

Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993), the comparative  Wt index (CFI, Bentler, 1990), and the
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA, Browne & Cudeck, 1993).

4. Results

Table 1 presents the CFA results. As shown in that table, the  Wt indices revealed
support for the hypothesized 7-factor model suggesting support for the distinctive-
ness of the constructs used in this study.

Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations of the vari-
ables studied. As shown in that table, POS, OBSE, and TIO were related to the out-
come variables in the expected direction.

To test the hypothesized model, we Wrst assessed the conditions of mediation (cf.,
Prussia & Kinicki, 1996, p. 192). First, correlation coeYcients indicated that POS was
signiWcantly correlated with all three work outcomes (see Table 2). Second, baseline
structural  or  hypothesized  model  results  showed  that  POS  signiWcantly  inXuenced

Note. In the 7-factor Model,  Wve constructs and two sub-constructs (OCB consists of two sub-con-
structs,  conscientiousness  and  boosterism)  were  treated  as  seven  independent  factors.  In  the  6-factor

ism, and conscientiousness.

the hypothesized mediators (OBSE and TIO) providing support for Hypothesis 1a
and Hypothesis 2a (see Fig. 1). The third condition was also satisWed as the results
showed that OBSE and TIO signiWcantly inXuenced the three work outcomes.

To evaluate the fourth condition for mediation, we compared the Wt of four partial
mediating  models  to  our  hypothesized  model.  As  shown  in  Table  3,  the  Wt  indices
revealed partially mediated model D to be our best  Wtting model indicating partial
support for Hypothesis 1a and Hypothesis 1b.

Fig. 1 presents the LISREL estimates for the paths in the best  Wtting model. As
shown in that  Wgure, OBSE and TIO fully mediated the relationship between POS
and  the  three  work  outcomes  of  organizational  commitment,  in-role  performance,
and  boosterism.  However,  OBSE  and  TIO  partially  mediated  the  relationship
between POS and conscientiousness.

5. Discussion

This  study  examined  the  mediating  role  of  TIO  and  OBSE  in  the  relationship
between  POS  and  employee  work  outcomes  in  China.  Consistent  with  social
exchange formulations, POS related positively to TIO (Whitener, 2001). The favor-
able treatment that employees receive from the organization constitutes an opportu-
nity for the organization not only to initiate a social exchange relationship with its
employees but, also to demonstrate its trustworthiness in the eyes of employees. Blau
(1964, pp. 94) argued that “Only social exchange tends to engender feelings of per-
sonal obligations, gratitude and trust, purely economic exchange as such does not.”
The Wndings further revealed that POS related positively to OBSE suggesting that the
experience of being valued by the organization and being favorably treated increases

one’s feeling of self-worth in the context of work (Pierce et al., 1989). The messages
inherent  in  the  organization’s  favorable  treatment  of  its  employees  constitute
reXected appraisal as to who they are (Gecas, 1982; Rosenberg, 1979) or the extent to
which they are valued leading to OBSE. The present Wnding indicates that organiza-
tional support of and care for the employee whether conceptualized at the organiza-
tional  level  as  organizational  care  or  at  the  individual  level  as  POS,  represents  a
“fundamental contextual source of OBSE” (McAllister & Bigley, 2001).

Consistent with the extant literature (Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002), our Wndings
further  revealed  POS  to  be  related  to  the  work  outcomes  examined.  This  suggests
that employees reciprocate the organization’s favorable treatment by incorporating
organizational membership and role status into their social identity as well as engag-
ing in behaviors that promote trust and OBSE. Trust in organization leads employees
to  promote  the  well-being  of  the  organization  through  positive  work  outcomes,
thereby,  cementing  the  establishment  of  a  social  exchange  relationship  with  the
employing organization. It is noteworthy that TIO fully mediated the POS and orga-
nizational commitment relationship, while Eisenberger et al. (2001) reported that felt
obligation  partially  mediated  the  POS–organizational  commitment  relationship.
However, consistent with the mediating inXuence of TIO in the present study, Eisen-
berger  et  al.  (2001)  reported  that  felt  obligation  fully  mediated  the  relationship
between  POS  and  the  behavioral  outcomes  of  in-role  performance  and  organiza-
tional spontaneity, an extra-role behavior.

Consistent with our expectations and Pierce et al.’s (1989) Wndings, OBSE related
to  the  work  outcomes  examined.  Further,  with  the  exception  of  conscientiousness,

OBSE fully mediated the POS–work outcome relationships. Support for the mediat-
ing inXuence of OBSE is explicable in terms of cognitive consistency theory, which
posits that individuals are motivated to engage in behaviors that are consistent with
their self-concept (Brockner, 1988; Korman, 1970). The mediating inXuence of OBSE
in the present study and positive aVectivity in the Eisenberger et al.’s (2001) study,
suggest a need to integrate self-concept theory into explanations of the relationship
between POS and its demonstrated work outcomes. Beyond the mediated inXuence
of POS on the work outcomes, the results revealed a direct relationship between POS
and conscientiousness. The POS–conscientiousness relationship may stem from the
potential  of  POS  to  satisfy  the  self-esteem  needs  of  employees  which  not  only
enhances  their  identiWcation  with  the  organization  but  also  their  willingness  to  go
beyond the call of duty in their task performance.

As with any research, the present one has a number of limitations. A Wrst limita-
tion is the cross-sectional design which means that cause–eVect relations cannot be
inferred from our Wndings. For example, OBSE and the behavioral outcomes may be
reciprocally related. Perhaps because employees engage in these behaviors, they may
come to perceive themselves as valued and contributing members of the organization.
Future research that employs a longitudinal design may be better placed to ascertain
the causal basis of the relationships examined in this study.

A second limitation is the possibility of method variance inXating the relationships
between the self-report measures. This is because, with the exception of the behav-
ioral  outcomes  which  were  based  on  supervisor  ratings,  all  other  measures  were
based on self-reports. Since these measures reXect individual perceptions, it is diYcult
to obtain data on them from sources other than the respondents. The CFA results,
however, revealed the measures to be distinct which should minimize concerns about
method variance. Further Crampton and Wagner (1994) provided evidence to sug-
gest  that  percept–percept  inXation  is  not  as  severe  as  is  generally  claimed.  A  third
limitation is our failure to control for the eVects of other social exchange mechanisms
for  example,  leader–member  exchange  (LMX).  There  is  research  evidence  in  both
individualist and collectivist societies that LMX is better able to predict supervisor-
related  than  organization-related  outcomes  (Hui,  Lee,  &  Rousseau,  2004;  Wayne
et al., 2002). Given that in-role performance may also represent a supervisor-related
outcome, future research should include social exchange processes at both levels if we
are to unambiguously explain the motivational underpinnings of myriad behavioral
outcomes.  A  Wnal limitation  is the use  of  part-time  MBA  students  which  makes  it
impossible to control for such contextual variables as size and nature of task. This
limitation is, however, counterbalanced by the use of employees from multiple orga-
nizations which enhances the generalizability of our Wndings.

These  limitations  notwithstanding,  the  present  Wndings  provide  support  for  the
generalizability of POS theory to a collectivist, relationship-centered cultural context.
SpeciWcally, it replicated the demonstrated inXuence of POS on the employee work
outcomes of organizational commitment, in-role performance and OCB. Further and
more  importantly,  the  Wndings  provide  an  explanation  for  why  POS  is  related  to
these work outcomes. Support for the mediational role of TIO and OBSE highlight
the motivational underpinnings of the POS–work outcome relationships. Lastly, the


468

Z.X. Chen et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 66 (2005) 457–470

Wndings support the role of POS as an antecedent of TIO and OBSE. The extent to
which the organization values employees’ contributions and cares about their well-
being promotes trust in the organization as well as provides the “experiential base for
the development of OBSE.”

To  conclude,  the  present  study  provides  an  explanation  for  why  POS  has  been
shown  to  be  related  to  important  work  outcomes  (Rhoades  &  Eisenberger,  2002).
Although  previous  research  has  examined  POS  as  an  antecedent,  outcome  and  a
mediator, there is a dearth of research that has examined why it is related to its dem-
onstrated outcomes (Eisenberger et al., 2001; Whitener, 2001). Given the increasing
interest  in  the employee–organization relationship in a changing  employment con-
text, it is hoped that the present study will provide an impetus for research that tests
organizational support theory particularly in cross-cultural contexts.
