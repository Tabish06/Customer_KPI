THE  EFFECTS  OF HUMAN RESOURCE  MANAGEMENT 

DECISIONS  ON SHAREHOLDER  VALUE 

JOHN  M. ABOWD,  GEORGE  T. MILKOVICH,  and JOHN  M. HANNON* 

Using an event study methodology, the authors investigate whether 
human resource decisions of firms (such as  decisions concerning 
compensation and benefits or staffing) announced in the Wall Street 
Journal in 1980 and  1987 discernibly affected either the level or 
variation of abnormal total shareholder return. They find no consistent 
pattern of increased or decreased valuation in response to any of five 
categories of HR announcements, even after controlling for the likely 
effect of such announcements on total compensation costs. On the other 
hand, announcements of permanent staff reductions and shutdowns or 
relocations were associated with significant increases in the variation of 
abnormal total shareholder return around the announcement date, 
which indicates that HR decisions in those two categories do affect 
shareholders' predictions of firms' performance. 

T HE  relation between human resource 
decisions and  organizational perfor- 
mance is a  central issue in the study of 
managerial decision-making. Despite the 
considerable attention professionals and 
academics  have  given to  the increased

importance of effective human resource 
management, fewer researchers have fo- 
cused on the effects of human resource 
management decisions  on  organization 
performance than on the determinants of 
the  HR  decisions  themselves. (For  a 
discussion of  this point, see  Dyer  and 
Holder 1988; Schuler 1987; Kleiner et al. 
1987; and  Ulrich 1987.) One  reason for 
the relative scarcity of this type of research 
may be  the  absence  of  well-developed 
theories, other than the  price-theoretic 
models that emphasize the relation be- 
tween unit compensation costs and employ- 
ment, that relate strategic HR decisions to 
medium-term and  long-term corporate 
outcomes. In  addition, little effort has 
been made to create a  taxonomy of the 
relevant HR strategies that might be used 
to  measure  the  effects of  alternative 
decisions on organizational performance. 
The  organizational performance out- 
comes  most commonly considered  are

plans  on  employee suggestions, perfor- 
mance, and  satisfaction (Schuster 1983, 
1984;  Bullock  and  Lawler  1984),  the 
effects of merit pay on performance and 
satisfaction (Pearce and Perry 1983; Hen- 
eman  1984), and  the effects of flexible 
work schedules on attendance, absentee- 
ism, and  satisfaction (Gannon, Norland, 
and  Robeson  1983)  are  all  examples. 
Other research argues that the percep- 
tions of organizational stakeholders (stock- 
holders, employees, managers, and regu- 
latory agencies) regarding the constituents 
of HR activities are the relevant outcomes 
(Tsui 1987). This type of analysis has been 
conducted using a  variety of HR-related 
indexes as measures of performance (Fitz- 
enz 1984), including productivity estimates 
(for example, the ratio of sales revenue to 
total employee salaries and  the ratio of 
production volume  to  labor  use)  and 
staffing rates (for example, turnover rates, 
promotion rates, and offer/hire rates). A 
series of studies has applied cost-benefit 
analysis  to  some  of  these  indexes 
(Boudreau,  in press; Cascio  1987;  Alex- 
ander and Barrick 1987). 

Other authors have examined the rela- 
tion of HR decisions to the economic per- 
formance of organizations. Economic per- 
formance has been defined using accounting 
measures (for example, net income, return 
on assets, and return on equity) and using 
financial market measures of shareholder 
wealth (holding period dividends plus cap- 
ital gains). Research in this genre includes 
studies examining the effects of new collec- 
tive bargaining agreements (Abowd 1989), 
concession bargaining (Becker 1987), strikes 
(Neumann 1980; Becker and Olson 1986; 
Tracy 1987, 1988), executive compensation 
(Baker, Jensen, and Murphy 1988; Brick- 
ley, Bhagat, and Lease 1985; Tehranian and 
Waegelein 1985; Gomez-Mejia, Tosi, and 
Hinkin 1987), and executive succession (Re- 
inganum  1985;  Etebari, Horrigan, and 
Landwehr 1987; Lubatkin, Chung, Rogers, 
and Owers 1989). 

To  summarize, research on the relation 
between human resource decisions and or- 
ganizational performance appears to have 
focused most on immediate outcomes (be- 
haviors and attitudes), less on intermediate 

outcomes (accounting measures, financial 
health, and economic outcomes), and hardly 
at all on ultimate outcomes like survival. (For 
a rare example of the third kind of investi- 
gation, see Thorndike 1949.) It may be, of 
course, that HR decisions operate directly 
on the immediate outcomes and only indi- 
rectly on the intermediate economic and ul- 
timate survival outcomes. 

In this study we attempt to analyze the 
effects of HR  decisions on  shareholder 
wealth. We do  so recognizing that stock 
market measures  of  firm performance 
may  have  too  much  "noise"  in  many 
situations to permit detection of the direct 
effects of  HR  policies  and  practices. 
Recent evidence documenting the direct 
effects of labor relations events on  the 
shareholder value  of the firm suggests, 
however, that similar effects may be found 
for other  HR  decisions  (Abowd  1989; 
Becker  and  Olson  1987;  Ruback  and 
Zimmerman 1984; Tracy 1988). 

An important feature of these studies is 
their use  of an  economic model of the 
information content of the HR announce- 
ment.  This  model  predicts which an- 
nouncements should  be  associated with 
increased shareholder wealth (events asso- 
ciated with unexpected decreases in total 
compensation or increases in profitability) 
and  which  announcements  should  be 
associated  with  decreased  shareholder 
wealth (events associated with unexpected 
increases in  total compensation or  de- 
creases  in  profitability). These  studies 
have  focused on  specific types of  HR 
management events (primarily contract 
negotiations and  strikes) and  have used 
models appropriate for these events. 

We  have  no  general model  that can 
classify HR  events  by  their  expected 
effects on  shareholder  wealth.  Conse- 
quently, we use conventional event study 
methods in an  effort to detect (1)  any 
significant direct effects of HR announce- 
ments on shareholder wealth and (2) any 
evidence that market reactions of unpre- 
dictable direction occur. 

Assessing HR Decision Effects 

Using the Event Study Methodology 
We  use  the event study methodology

developed in accounting and finance (Ball 
and  Brown  1968;  Beaver  1968;  Fama, 
Fisher, Jensen, and Roll 1969) and applied 
in the recent labor relations studies cited 
above.  The  basic premise of the event 
study is that capital markets react immedi- 
ately to new information that materially 
affects the future profitability of the firm. 
An event is an announcement by the firm 
or  an  action  in  the  marketplace that 
conveys incremental information to stock 
market  participants allowing  them  to 
revise prior expectations regarding the 
prospects of a corporation or identifiable 
group of corporations (Patell 1976). 

The  efficient markets hypothesis im- 
plies that this new information will rapidly 
diffuse throughout the market, and some 
market participants will act on the infor- 
mation in a manner that changes the value 
of  shareholders' wealth  to  reflect the 
consequences of the new information. A 
change in either the expected future cash 
flows or the riskiness of a  firm's stock, 
which will affect the discount rate used to 
reduce case  flows to present value, will 
result in a change in the price of the firm's 
common stock. If the change in expected 
cash flows or riskiness is expected to be 
advantageous, the price of the stock will 
rise. If the change in expected cash flows 
or riskiness is expected to be harmful, the 
price of the stock will decline. 

Depending on the firm's capital struc- 
ture, shareholder value may be  equated 
with the total value of the firm or it may 
constitute some  portion of  total  firm 
value.  Regardless of  the  firm's capital 
structure, the event study methodology 
defines firm performance in  terms of 
changes in  shareholder value,  which is 
generally called total shareholder return. 
The Event Study Structure 

Although event studies use many differ- 
ent techniques, they involve five general 
steps  (see  Bowman  1983;  Brown  and 
Warner 1980, 1985;  and  Schwert 1981). 
The  steps are: (1)  identify the events of 
interest; (2) model the normal (expected) 
total shareholder returns; (3) estimate the 
abnormal (unexpected) total shareholder 
returns;  (4)  organize  and  group  the 

abnormal returns according to event type; 
and  (5)  analyze summary measures for 
abnormal returns by event type. 

The  event of interest may be a  single 
action affecting a group of firms simulta- 
neously, such as a new regulatory agency 
announcement, or  an  action  affecting 
different firms at various times, such as 
numerous firms making layoff announce- 
ments. The most critical component of the 
event measurement is the determination 
of the time when the public first learned 
that the event occurred (see Brown and 
Warner 1980, 1985). This date is called 
the event date. 

The importance of correctly ascertaining 
the event date stems from a property of stock 
returns implied by the efficient markets hy- 
pothesis and empirically valid for total share- 
holder returns of firms with active capital 
markets-stock returns are neither serially 
correlated nor serially cross-correlated. 
Hence, on any given date a sample of ab- 
normal returns has a zero mean. Further, a 
sample of cumulative abnormal returns (the 
sum of abnormal returns over a specified 
time interval) also has a zero mean. When 
abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal 
returns are computed for a group of firms 
that experienced a similar event, using the 
event date as the reference point, the aver- 
age abnormal return for the group has a 
positive (negative) mean if the event is as- 
sociated with the arrival of favorable (unfa- 
vorable) information on the market. Similar 
arguments hold for the cumulative abnor- 
mal return over a time interval that includes 
the event date. Other influences on total 
shareholder return are  effectively con- 
trolled by the statistical properties cited 
above. When the direction of the effect can- 
not be predicted ex ante, the variance of ab- 
normal returns and cumulative abnormal 
returns is greater on and around the event 
date than for a reference period before or 
after that date. 

The estimation of the expected return is 
accomplished by statistical modeling of the 
relation between total shareholder return 
over a given holding period (typically one 
day or one month) with the total share- 
holder return for the same holding period 
arising from the capital market, a diversi-

fied portfolio of common stocks (typically a 
broad-based portfolio of common stocks 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange). 
The  abnormal return is computed as the 
difference between the holding period total 
shareholder return and its estimated ex- 
pected value, given the return on the mar- 
ket. The abnormal, or unexpected, return 
is computed for the reference period used 
to estimate the expected return model (typ- 
ically 250 days for daily returns and 5 years 
for monthly returns) and an event period 
surrounding the event date (typically 21 days 
for daily returns and 7 months for monthly 
returns). 

Pit-)/P1i,t-1 

Rit = cti +  P3iRmt +  ARi't 

Formally, in  our  study the abnormal 
return was calculated using the following 
definitions (for daily return data): 
(1)  Rit  =  (Dit  +  Pit- 
where Dit =  dividend per share over day 
t for security i and Pit =  price (ex divi- 
dend) of security i at the end of day t; and 
(2) 
return on  the  market 
where  Rm t  = 
portfolio for day t; (x and Pi =  estimated 
intercept and slope for security i; and ARi t 
=  abnormal return for security i on day t. 
The  price per share has been adjusted 
to reflect the effects of stock splits and 
stock dividends over the period t- 1 to t. 
The  return on  the market portfolio is 
measured by the percentage change in the 
New York Stock Exchange value-weighted 
portfolio including dividends (Center for 
Research in  Security Prices 1987).  The 
estimated abnormal return (the residual 
from the estimated expected return model) 
was calculated as 
(3) 
The  intercept and slope of the expected 
return model  were  estimated over  a 
253-day period during the calendar year 
preceding  the  event  date  (called  the 
estimation period). The same intercept and 
slope  were  used  to  calculate abnormal 
returns in  the period  surrounding the 
event  date  (called  the  event  period). 
Abnormal returns have a zero mean over 
the  estimation period  because  of  the 

ARit -Ri  -  (&i +  Pi Rm,t) 

properties of ordinary least squares, the 
technique used for estimation. 

The  abnormal returns were grouped 
according to a classification system devel- 
oped  for the HR  events. Statistics, based 
on the abnormal returns, were computed 
for the event period, generally 5 days-2 
days before the event, the event day itself, 
and 2 days after the event. Hence, when 
daily returns are used, t =  0 for the event 
day; the day before the announcement is t 
=  -1;  and the day after the announce- 
ment is t =  1. Abnormal returns were 
grouped by event type and day relative to 
the event day (t), and then averaged across 
firms. The average abnormal return for a 
day t is defined as: 

N 

(4) 

AAR, = 

ARjtIN 

where ARit =  abnormal return for firm i 
on event day t and N =  number of events 
in the group. 

Average cumulative abnormal returns 
(average CARs) were also computed for 
the event period and an eight-day period 
preceding t =  -2  (see Fama et al. 1969). 
The formula used was:

where I is the relevant event group and t1 
and t2 are the beginning day and ending 
day of the period. 

To  estimate changes in the variance of 
abnormal returns, we calculated variance 
ratio statistics based on the five-day event 
period and the 253-day estimation period.

the formula:

mated). The  denominator is divided by

Methodology for Evaluating 

HR Events 

Definitions 

Previous HR-based  event studies have 
evaluated the effects of one specific type 
of event (for example, wage settlements or 
executive compensation plans) on  share- 
holder value. In this study, we examine a 
broad range of human resource decisions 
for the years 1980 and  1987. The  events 
were grouped into five major classes and 
nine distinct subcategories based on their 
likely effects on total compensation costs: 
(1)  general HR  system changes-no  sub- 
categories; (2) compensation and benefits- 
(a) increase, (b) decrease; (3) staffing-(a) 
permanent reduction, (b) temporary reduc- 
tion, (c) recall or increase; (4) relocation or 
shutdown-(a)  relocation, (b)  shutdown; 
(5)  miscellaneous-(a)  health and  safety; 
(b)  all others (not estimated because  of 
noncomparability across years). 

Event Data: Source and Dating 

The  sample for this study includes all 
firms with traded securities on the New 
York Stock Exchange in  1980  or  1987. 
The source for events and the event dates 
is the Wall Street Journal. From our review 
of all 1980 and 1987 issues of the WSJ, we 
identified 452 events associated with 154 
firms in 1980 and  195 events associated 
with 102 firms in 1987. The  event date 
was taken as the date that the information 
was provided to the market via publication 
in the WSJ. (The  Data Appendix lists all 
events for the calendar years 1980 and 
1987  by  event  type  and  subcategory, 
including a synopsis of the WSJ articles.) 
Although deficiencies associated with the 
use of the WSJ and the Wall Street Journal 
Index have been noted (Thompson  1985; 

Thompson,  Olsen,  and  Dietrich  1987, 
1988),  the majority of event studies in 
accounting, finance, and  labor  relations 
have used one or both of these sources. 

The total shareholder return and stock 
price information for those firms experi- 
encing HR events was extracted from the 
Center for Research in  Security Prices 
(CRSP)  daily stock returns file (1987).  In 
this study, the daily return, which reflects 
dividends paid  plus  the change  in  the 
price of the security for each trading day, 
was  used.  In  order to  account for the 
possibility that information was leaked to 
the market prior to the announcement of 
the event in the Wall Street Journal, an 
event window spanning two days before 
the event through two days after the event 
was evaluated. In order to allow for the 
possibility that  the  information slowly 
leaked  into  the  market, an  eight-day 
period  beginning ten  days  before  the 
event and  ending three days before the 
event was also studied. 

Expected Security Price Reactions 

The  announcement of  a  human  re- 
source decision has several potential ef- 
fects. If  an  announced  action is  inter- 
preted  as  an  attempt  to  improve 
performance, it may be seen as beneficial. 
Alternatively, if it is perceived as an act of 
desperation, it may send a negative signal 
to the market and the firm's shareholders. 
Of course, shareholders and  the market 
may be  indifferent to the HR  decisions 
described in the "events." 

The major difficulty in categorizing the 
events is determining the element of new 
information or  "surprise" in  each  an- 
nouncement. Events that can be directly 
quantified  (for  example,  earnings  an- 
nouncements or new collective bargains) 
are amenable to a statistical model separat- 
ing the expected and unexpected compo- 
nents  of  the  announcement.  For  the 
events we  examine  here,  however, no 
direct model of the expected announce- 
ment is available. Instead, we categorize 
events by the direction of the effect on 
total compensation costs (when that effect 
can  be  determined); however, we  must

note that even when an event (such as a 
staffing increase or  a  compensation in- 
crease) is known to increase total compen- 
sation costs, the unexpected component of 
the increase is not necessarily positive. 

We can speculate that certain informa- 
tion conveyed to the market through HR 
events would be unexpected. On the one 
hand, if the managers of the firm are 
always acting in  the  shareholders' best 
interest, the expected effect of any HR 
change is to increase the value of share- 
holders' wealth. This  expected effect is 
capitalized into the security price gradu- 
ally as the information about the general 
HR  environment at the firm is revealed. 
The  new  information content- unex- 
pected  part-of  every type of  HR  an- 
nouncement, then, must be  positive on 
average. On the other hand, the announce- 
ments also may contain some new informa- 
tion about the state of the product market 
(or other relevant economic factors). In 
these cases, the unexpected effects of the 
announcement will, on  average,  imply 
positive security price effects when the 
product market information is good and 
negative security price effects when the 
product market information is bad. 

Consider  the  case  of  a  permanent 
staffing reduction. The  first-order effect 
of this change is to reduce total compensa- 
tion costs and to reduce output (or at least 
productive capacity) within the organiza- 
tion. If the staffing reduction is in the 
shareholders' best interests, costs fall by 
more than the reduction in sales revenue, 
so  that  profits rise.  On  average,  the 
unexpected  component of  the  staffing 
change should have a  positive effect on 
stock prices for this reason. If, however, 
the staffing reduction is greater than the 
market expectation based  on  economic 
conditions in  the  firm's industry, the 
unexpected component of the announce- 
ment also includes new information that 
the product market (or other economic 
conditions) are worse than expected. This 
part of the unexpected component of the 
staffing change will have a negative effect 
on stock prices. It is very difficult to model 
the net effect of such influences on stock 
prices without a comprehensive model for 

decomposing the announcement into an 
expected component and unexpected com- 
ponents  that  reflect new  information 
about HR  policies and  new information 
about the state of the product market. 

Before considering the results of our 
event study, we  report the results of a 
statistical analysis of the magnitude, vari- 
ability, and  sample  size  required  for 
estimability of the average abnormal re- 
turn caused  by unexpected  changes  in 
sales, cost of  goods  sold, operating in- 
come, direct wage expense, and sales less 
direct wage expense. The experiment was 
conducted using 3,450 firms from Stan- 
dard  and  Poor's  COMPUSTAT 
annual 
financial data  files. For  each  firm we 
calculated net sales, cost of goods  sold, 
operating income, estimated direct wage 
expenses, and  sales less direct wage ex- 
penses. We estimated the present value of 
the after-tax change in cash flow resulting 
from a  one  percent change in each  of 
these quantities holding all other income 
statement items constant. The  present 
value was calculated using horizons of one 
year, three years, and infinity. The abnor- 
mal return was estimated as the ratio of 
the present value of the change in cash 
flow  divided  by  the  December  1979 
market value of the company's common 
stock. 

This experiment, summarized in Table 
1, reveals the difficulty of measuring the 
effect of HR events on stock prices when 
the effect on other economic factors can 
be  perfectly controlled and  when  the 
effect on  other factors cannot be  con- 
trolled at all. The table shows the average 
abnormal return associated with the unex- 
pected increase, the cross-sectional stan- 
dard deviation of the average abnormal 
return, and an estimate of the number of 
events required to detect the abnormal 
return given the cross-sectional standard 
deviation and the average standard devia- 
tion of daily abnormal returns (.03;  see 
Brown and Warner 1985). 

An  unexpected  1 %  increase in direct 
wage expenses that is expected to last only 
one year produces an average abnormal 
return of only -.43%  and  has enough 
variability to require 979  events for an

about  the  product  market, it  will  be 
virtually impossible to detect the effect 
with stock price data. On the other hand, 
if the unexpected 1% increase in direct 
wage  expenses  is  associated with a  1% 
increase in  sales-that  is,  if the  event 
signals an unexpected increase in profit- 
able production-then only 68 events will 
be  required  to  detect  it  even  if  the 
duration is only one year. 

The  signs of the abnormal returns in 
Table  1 can be reversed to discuss down- 
turns. If a  1%  decrease in direct wage 
costs (perhaps from an unexpected layoff 
of  one  percent of  the  work force) is 
expected  to  last  three years, then the 
direct  wage  effect (+  1.17%)  may  be 
detected with 143 events. If the HR event 
also signals a  1% downturn in sales, then 
the -4.85%  effect is detectable with only 
19 events. 

The  detectability of larger stock price 
changes arising from HR events involving 
larger unexpected changes  in  costs or 
direct wages can be  estimated from the 
infinite horizon  rows of  Table  1.  An 
unexpected change of 10% in direct wage 

costs that lasts only one year is essentially 
the same as a 1% change that lasts forever. 
It should therefore be detectable with 22 
events, provided  those  events are  not 
associated with the introduction of other 
information. 

Finally, in order to provide some addi- 
tional guidance regarding the magnitude 
of the estimated effects, we discuss the 
portfolio consequences of various abnor- 
mal  returns. An  average  CAR  of  1 % 
means that a portfolio consisting of stocks 
about to experience the event will increase 
in value (on average) 1 % between the close 
of business on day t = - 3 and the close of 
business on day t= 2. If the event could be 
forecasted perfectly, then a  1%  holding 
period return could be realized (gross of 
trading costs) by assembling such a portfo- 
lio  on  day  t = - 3  and  liquidating the 
positions on day t= 2.  Average CARs of 
1% for five-day event periods are econom- 
ically significant, although not particularly 
large.  For  HR  events, our  estimated 
absolute  CARs  ranged  from  .02%  to 
2.68%.  For  industrial relations events, 
absolute CARs have been estimated in the 
1.5%  to  3%  range.  (See  Ruback  and 
Zimmerman  1984;  Becker  and  Olson 
1986; and Tracy 1988.)

Estimation Procedure 

The usual procedure for calculating the 
expected total shareholder return from 
daily return data is to use an estimation 
period of about 250 days that ends about 
one month before the event period begins 
(see Brown and Warner 1985). We modi- 
fied this procedure because of the relative 
frequency with which some  HR  events 
occur. Events such as permanent reduc- 
tion announcements may, and did, occur 
once  or  more  for a  given  firm in  a 
particular year.  For  example,  General 
Electric made five such work force reduc- 
tion announcements in  1980.  Further- 
more, any number of  combinations of 
event types may be experienced by firms 
in our study within a  given period. For 
instance, in  1980,  Firestone announced 
plans to shut down five plants (3/20/80) 

and initiated permanent layoffs of white- 
collar workers (5/5/80). 

To account for this potential multiplicity 

of HR events, which is attributable to the 
broad nature of the HR policies, we chose 
to modify the time frame for the market 
model estimation process. We have used 
returns for each firm from the preceding 
calendar year to generate our expected 
returns. This procedure reduces the po- 
tential for including confounding events 
in the estimation period. The  abnormal 
return was then derived from the differ- 
ence between the observed and the pre- 
dicted returns. The abnormal return may 
be  generated for any number of  days 
before or after the event. We  chose to 
analyze abnormal returns for days  -2, 
-  1, 0, 1, and 2. The cumulative abnormal 
return was computed for the 5-day period 
from day - 2 through day + 2. A second

Results 

In this section we discuss the results for 
average cumulative abnormal returns and 
variance ratios for each  of the analysis 
years. There is a separate discussion of the 
1980 and 1987 studies. The CAR analyses 
were performed for all events and for the 
first event for each company. The  vari- 
ance ratio studies were performed using 
the first event for each company. 
1980 Abnormal Returns 

All events. In  1980 there were 452  HR 

events in  154 firms. Staffing-temporary 
reduction (157), staffing-permanent reduc- 
tion (87),  and  shutdown (80)  events oc- 
curred most frequently, as seen in Table 2. 
In  general, the  results in  this table 

indicate that the stock market did  not 
react predictably to most of the human 
resource interventions announced in 1980. 
Only the staffing-recall/increase subcate- 
gory had a relatively large positive average 
cumulative abnormal return (average CAR) 
for the 5-day period (+.95%  ?  1.37%). 
The  staffing-temporary reduction event 
had an average CAR of -1.19%  ?  .45%, 
which is the only statistically significant 
average  CAR  during the event period. 
The negative cumulative abnormal return 
for staffing-temporary reduction remains 
statistically significant when the data for 
all events in  1980 and  1987 are pooled 
(-1.11%  ?  .43%). 

First events. In an attempt to isolate the 
effects of  the  human  resource  events 
under study, a second set of analyses was 
performed for the 1980 sample using only 
the first event for each  firm. In  1980, 
there were 154 such events for 154 firms. 
When only the first event was considered, 
the  shutdown (43),  staffing-permanent

reduction (38),  and  staffing-temporary 
reduction  (25)  events  were  the  most 
frequent, as shown in Table 3. 

With the exception of the compensation- 
increase category, which was negative for 
the "all events" and positive for the "first 
events only," the associations observed for 
the overall sample have the same direc- 
tions in the first event only sample. As in 
the all events sample, the first event only 
subset exhibits a  large negative average 
CAR for the staffing-temporary reduction 
category. This  negative average  CAR is 
also significant for the pooled  1980 and 
1987  first event  analysis  (-  2.11%  ? 
1.00%). 

1987 Abnormal Returns 

All events. In  1987, there were a  total 

of 195 events. Staffing-permanent reduc- 
tion  (88)  was  the  predominant event 
type. General human resource (28)  and 
shutdown (24)  were the next most fre- 
quent event types, as can be seen in Table 
4. 

The  1987 results also show a  general 
lack of predictability in the stock market 
reaction to the HR events. In three of the 
nine  categories (compensation-increase, 
compensation-decrease, and  shutdown) 
the direction of the relationship is  the 
same as in 1980, although no average CAR 
is statistically significant at conventional 
levels. 

First events. In 1987, there were 102 first 
events, as  defined  previously, for  102 
firms. Considering only the first events,

and shutdown (18)  events occurred with 
the greatest frequency, as shown in Table 
5. 

Comparing the total 1987 sample with 
the first event only subset, we see that two 
important  categories  (compensation- 
increase and  staffing-permanent reduc- 
tion) have changes in average CAR signs. 
These  changes are influential enough to 
result in different signs for the average 
CAR  values  for the  all  events sample 
(+.12%)  and the first event only subset 
(-  .15%). Again, no cumulative abnormal 
returns are statistically significant. 

Variance Changes 

In  order  to  determine whether the 
variability of abnormal returns changes 
around the event date, we computed the 
ratio of abnormal return variances for the 

event period  relative to  the estimation 
period. Figure 1 displays a  histogram of 
these variance ratios for the first event 
sample in 1980 compared to the theoreti- 
cal F-distribution that would be obtained 
in the absence of variance shifts around 
the event. The  many large values of the 
variance ratio that are  apparent in the 
figure seem to rule out the hypothesis of 
no change in abnormal return variance. 
This  impression is  confirmed by  the 
Kolmogorov D-statistic (D = .1 1 1, probabil- 
ity value <  .01). The  new information in 
the HR events is moving stock prices, but 
not in a predictable direction. 

Figure 2 shows a similar histogram for 
the 1987 first event sample. Again, there 
are too many large variance ratios, com- 
pared to the theoretical F distribution, to 
accept  the  hypothesis of  no  variance 
change. The  Kolmogorov D-statistic con-

firms this conclusion (D =.147,  probability 
value <  .01). 

Having concluded that there is evidence 
of a variance shift surrounding the event 
period in both 1980 and 1987, we exam- 
ined lists of the events associated with the 
large variance shifts. For the year 1980 
there  were  26  events  in  the  largest 
variance ratio category. Seven  of these 
events were permanent staff reductions 
and nine were plant shutdowns. Although 
we were not able to predict the average 
effects of  these  events  precisely, the 
variance ratios confirm that such events 
are  associated with large swings in  the 
stock price. Similarly, for 1987, there were 
13  events in  the largest variance ratio 
category. Nine were associated with perma- 
nent  reductions in  force, one  was  a 
shutdown, and one was a relocation. The 
results for 1987 are consistent with the 
1980 variance results. Major reductions in 
staff or  changes  in  plant location are 

associated with large abnormal returns of 
unpredictable direction. An analysis of the 
1980 and 1987 variance ratios for all first 
events associated with permanent reduc- 
tions of  staff supports this conclusion 
(Shapiro-Wilk statistic =  .869, probability 
value  <.01  for  1980,  and  W  =  .150, 
probability value <.01  for 1987). Analysis 
of the 1980 and  1987 variance ratios for 
all first events associated with plant shut- 
downs was inconclusive. 

A final issue that arises in connection with 
the finding that HR events increase the vari- 
ance of abnormal returns around the an- 
nouncement date is the possibility that HR 
decisions are selected for announcement in 
the Wall Street Journal precisely because of 
their likely impact on stock returns. We con- 
tacted the WSJ in an effort to determine 
the sources and coverage of HR news sto- 
ries. The  two primary sources are com- 
pany press releases and reporters covering 
a geographic region or company. Most an-

nouncements originate as  press releases, 
and most descriptive stories originate from 
beat reporters; all stories are written by WSJ 
reporters. Press release information is in- 
vestigated by the reporter and is not printed 
verbatim as distributed by the company. 
The Journal's goal is to write a story on the 
same day the information is received, and 
almost all press releases about HR changes 
result in some news coverage. Some com- 
panies routinely disclose more information 
in the form of press releases and general 
interviews than other companies (private 
correspondence, 1989). 

It  seems  likely that company  policy 
regarding HR event press releases affects 
the probability of the event appearing in 
the WSJ, and hence that certain compa- 
nies are more likely than others to appear 
in our analysis. It does not follow, how- 
ever, that certain stories are more likely to 
appear  for that company. The  tests we 
performed for changing variances con- 

trolled for the individual company's abnor- 
mal return variability; therefore, the pos- 
sibility that  high  variance  companies 
disclose more HR information would not 
bias our results. 

Conclusion 

In this study, we extended the use of 
the event study methodology to consider 
the effects of  a  variety of  human  re- 
source decisions on  shareholder return. 
Human resource announcements occur fre- 
quently, at  least  as  compared  to  the 
accounting, control, and regulatory events 
that are often the focus of event studies. 
The  magnitude and  variability of  the 
theoretical abnormal  returns associated 
with unambiguous HR events-events that 
signal an unexpected increase or decrease 
in compensation costs holding other com- 
ponents of cash flow constant-are  such 
that our task was a difficult one from the 


216-S 

JOHN ABOWD,  GEORGE  MILKOVICH,  AND JOHN  HANNON 

outset.  Furthermore, most  HR  events 
apparently are  not  unambiguous  new 
information. The  temporary staff reduc- 
tion event, which had a significant nega- 
tive cumulative abnormal return, must 
contain some additional bad  news about 
the product market, since by itself a staff 
reduction reduces compensation costs. 

Like all other event studies, our conclu- 
sions rely on the assumptions that we have 
(1) properly identified and (2) adequately 
isolated true events. We believe, however, 
that human  resource  management an- 
nouncements constitute valid events. Bow- 
man (1983:561)  has argued that "a very 
broad interpretation should be placed on 
what constitutes an  event." Becker and 
Olson  (1987)  also  suggest that capital 
market research supports the proposition 
that  the  market reacts  to  managerial 
decisions affecting cash flows and maximiz- 

ing  price  per  share.  Certainly human 
resource management decisions meet these 
qualifications. 

Our results indicate that the direction of 
the effect of HR management events is dif- 
ficult to predict absent a more fully speci- 
fied model for the unexpected change in 
total compensation expense and organiza- 
tional efficiency associated with the an- 
nouncement. Our finding of increased vari- 
ance  in  abnormal  shareholder  return 
associated with HR  announcements sug- 
gests, however, that these events do pro- 
vide  information that influences stock 
prices. In future research it might be use- 
ful to extend this concept to other HR in- 
tervention types, longer time periods, and 
broader samples than New York Stock Ex- 
change firms, and to use models that ex- 
plicitly consider the new information con- 
tent of the announcements themselves.
