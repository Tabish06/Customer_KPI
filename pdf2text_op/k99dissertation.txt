CHAPTER I 

Introduction

Despite equivocal findings regarding the link between employee satisfaction and 

performance (e.g., Iaffaldano & Muchinsky,  1985), recent changes in the study of this 

relationship have shed new light on the issue.  In prior research (e.g., Brayfield & Crockett,

1955), the relationship was explored at the individual level, with performance typically 

operationalized in terms of individual productivity (i.e., units produced compared to a standard). 

Ostroff (1992), however, articulated reasons why it may be more appropriate to assess 

relationships at the organizational level of analysis, examining employee attitudes (e.g., 

satisfaction) as they collectively relate to overall organizational performance.  In addition, there 

has also been a shift in how performance has been operationalized.  At the individual level of 

analysis, Organ (1988) has conceptualized performance in terms of organizational citizenship 

behaviors, or engaging in pro-organizational  behaviors which are not directly required by one’s 

work role.  Organ argues that behaviors benefiting one’s team or organization are more likely to 

follow from positive job attitudes than an increase in one’s productivity level, which is often not 

under an individual’s direct control.  For example, even if increased job satisfaction did result in 

greater individual effort, one’s productivity still may not rise, as it may be impeded by factors 

such as personal ability or work flow problems (Ostroff,  1992; Staw,  1986).

At the organizational level of analysis, measures of performance are moving beyond a 

myopic focus on financial indicators and increasingly view performance as multi-faceted.  One 

of the most notable examples of this expansive conceptualization of organizational performance 

is the Malcolm Baldrige National Award for Quality, sponsored by the U.S. Department of 

Commerce.  In order to be in contention for receiving this award, an organization must

demonstrate an infrastructure supportive of quality-oriented practices, all of which must revolve 

around a demonstrated customer orientation.  Certified examiners evaluate qualifying 

organizations on a host of factors, including the organization’s leadership, strategic planning 

efforts, its customer and market focus, how the organization uses and analyzes information, its 

human resource focus, process management and the organization’s actual business results.  An 

awarding-winning organization is able to demonstrate alignment among these seven criteria, as 

manifested by its customer and market focused strategy and action plans (Malcolm Baldrige 

National Quality Award  1998 Criteria for Performance Excellence).

Other models of organizational performance measurement have also been developed 

which incorporate customer-oriented outcomes, such as customer satisfaction, customer 

perceptions of service quality and customer perceptions of organizational practices.  The 

Conference Board, an organization which promotes progress in the business enterprise system 

through research protocols and forums for discussion, has outlined an organizational 

performance measurement system which metaphorically employs an automobile dashboard 

(Brancato,  1997).  The “dashboard” is comprised of key performance measures, or surface level 

indicators, monitored by management.  Each surface level indicator, in turn, is governed by 

several underlying indicators,  facilitating an in-depth analysis of the problem when an indicator 

“turns on.”  The dashboard model recognizes that certain antecedents, which differ depending on 

the nature of an organization’s business, drive financial performance.

In keeping with its name, a “balanced scorecard” approach to measuring organizational 

performance (Kaplan & Norton,  1993) conceptualizes performance in terms of maintaining a 

balance between the traditional financial indicators of success and other nonfinancial 

performance measures, revolving around internal processes, organizational learning and

development and the organization’s customer orientation.  All of these models of organizational 

performance measurement stress the importance o f linking performance measures to the overall 

strategic direction of the company and are useful for helping management keep tabs on the means 

to achieving the end of improved financial performance.

Broad approaches to performance measurement have followed from the growing 

dominance of the service economy.  Figures through  1997 show that service organizations now 

comprise over 20% of the Gross Domestic Product, compared to about 17% for manufacturing 

firms (U.S. Department of Commerce - Bureau of Economic Analysis,  1998).  Only a decade 

ago, these percentages were reversed.  In addition to the growth of the service economy, many 

manufacturers are taking on characteristics of service firms in an effort to differentiate 

themselves (Bowen, Siehl & Schneider,  1989).  Auto maker Saturn, for example, has an Internet 

site where potential buyers can configure cars according to their own specifications.  There are. 

however, some important differences between providers of goods and providers of services.  Key 

among these is intangibility; a service and the experience of the service occur simultaneously, 

while a good can be experienced at different times, places and in different contexts (Schneider & 

Bowen,  1985; Zeithaml, Parasuraman & Berry.  1985; Zemke,  1989).  Booms and Nyquist (1981) 

note the difference between services and goods in terms of end product differences and assembly 

differences, with the latter a consequence of the former.  Because products are tangible, distinct 

phases of product assembly are visible in manufacturing firms, whereas in service firms, service 

delivery and customer consumption occur simultaneously.  Thus, “The process is also the 

product” (Booms & Nyquist,  1981; p.  173).

The high degree of personal interaction between employee and customer in the provision 

of a service suggests that customer perceptions of service quality are driven primarily by

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


subjective evaluations of the intangible elements of a service interaction, such as how the 

customer was treated by the service representative (Bowen et al.,  1989).  This is important 

because customer satisfaction can lead to customer loyalty, resulting in a potential increase in 

intent to repurchase or return to the organization (Jones & Sasser,  1995).

By some estimates, an increase in customer loyalty (i.e., completely satisfying customers, 

versus merely satisfying them) of 5% can translate into profit increases ranging from 25% to 

85% (Reichheld & Sasser,  1990).  Heskett and colleagues (Heskett, Jones, Loveman, Sasser & 

Schlesinger,  1994; Heskett, Sasser & Schlesinger,  1997) proposed a framework which 

hypothesizes causal linkages between employee attitudes, service capabilities and bottom-line 

business outcomes, such as organizational profitability.  Rucci, Kim and Quin (1998) recently 

found evidence supporting the linkages hypothesized by Heskett et al. (1997).  Additionally, 

Anderson, Fornell and Lehmann (1994) found that firms with higher levels of customer 

satisfaction do realize greater economic returns, but that these returns are not immediately 

realized.

Others have taken a more cautious view of the link between customer satisfaction and 

profitability.  Schneider (1991), for instance, outlined circumstances under which it may not be 

realistic to expect a relationship between customer satisfaction and profitability.  Thompson 

(1996) found a non-significant, but negative correlation between customer satisfaction and 

contribution margin, a measure of profitability, across 71  districts of a utility provider.  Wiley 

(1991) even speculated that increasing customer satisfaction may come at too high a cost in some 

cases, making improved financial performance difficult to achieve.

At present it is unclear how non-financial measures of organizational performance, such 

as employee and customer attitudes and perceptions of organizational practices, relate to

R eproduced  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without  perm ission.


financial measures of organizational performance, such as profitability.  All else equal, the 

organization which can retain its customer base should be most profitable, since it is cheaper to 

retain customers than it is to obtain new customers (Heskett et al., 1997).  Again, all else equal, 

the road to improved financial performance should be more smooth if an organization can satisfy 

its customers to the extent they become loyal repeat customers and generate referral business 

(Jones & Sasser,  1995).  Indeed, Anderson et al. (1994) contend that customer relationships 

should be viewed as an asset, worthy of investment to grow and cultivate, instead of as an 

expense.

Human behavior is an unpredictable (Katz & Kahn,  1978), yet crucial determinant of 

service quality (Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry.  1985).  Therefore, if organizations hope to 

improve financial performance through increased customer satisfaction, it is important for 

organizations to understand both the behavioral dynamics between employees and customers 

during service interactions (i.e., the behaviors exhibited by service personnel and their effect on 

customers), as well as the factors which cause employees to exhibit certain behaviors in service 

interactions.  In short, in a service economy it is of paramount importance that organizations 

understand what it takes to make customers happy in addition to the role employees play toward 

that end.

In the manufacturing era, when organizational output was predominantly in the fonn of a 

tangible good or product, striving to understand how employee attitudes affected production, or 

could be leveraged to increase production, made sense.  In a service economy, it is useful to 

understand the relationship between employee attitudes and customer attitudes, such as customer 

satisfaction.  Since customers are often active participants in the service they receive (Schneider 

& Bowen,  1985), satisfaction with that service is an important indicator of organizational

performance in a service environment.  To the extent relationships between employee and 

customer attitudes are understood, organizations would undoubtedly benefit in terms of 

leveraging their resources to maximize customer satisfaction.

Customer Perceptions of Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction:  Distinct Customer

Attitudes

Zeithaml, Berry and Parasuraman (1991) noted a conceptual distinction between 

customer perceptions of service quality and customer satisfaction.  Service quality has been 

conceptualized as the difference between what a consumer expects and what the consumer 

believes was actually delivered in a service interaction (Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry,  1985; 

Zeithaml, Parasuraman & Berry,  1990; Zeithaml et al.,  1991).  Customer satisfaction, on the 

other hand, has been viewed as a global consumer judgment o f how satisfying all facets of a 

product or service were perceived to be after using a product or engaging in a service transaction 

(Churchill & Surprenant,  1982).  Endorsing a similar definition, Wilkie (1994) views customer 

satisfaction as an emotional response occurring after the evaluation of a product or service. 

Gotlieb, Grewal and Brown (1994) provided evidence supportive of the conceptual distinction 

between perceived quality and consumer satisfaction, finding that satisfaction is influenced by 

perceived quality.

An overall model of service quality has been operationalized by Zeithaml, Parasuraman 

and Berry (Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry,  1985; Zeithaml, Parasuraman & Berry,  1990; 

Zeithaml et al.,  1991) in terms of multiple service performance gaps:  Gap  1) the gap between 

customer expectations and management perceptions of customer expectations; Gap 2) the gap 

between management perceptions of customer expectations and the translation of these 

perceptions into specific service quality specifications; Gap 3) the gap between service quality

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


specifications and actual service delivery; Gap 4) the gap between actual service delivery and 

external communications affecting customer expectations.  These four gaps are useful for 

understanding the etiology of Gap 5, which is between expected and perceived service.

Zeithaml and colleagues (Zeithaml, Berry & Parasuraman,  1988; Zeithaml et al.,  1990; 

Parasuraman, Berry & Zeithaml,  1990) extended their initial model of service quality by 

proposing  10 evaluative criteria thought to directly influence customer perceptions of service 

quality (i.e., Gap 5).  They also proposed a set of organizational conditions hypothesized to either 

widen or narrow each of the first four gaps (see Zeithaml et al.,  1990 for a complete discussion). 

Thus, these authors conceptualize service quality as the difference between expected and 

perceived service, which is a joint function of four service performance gaps and  10 criteria 

customers use to evaluate service.

While there may be a conceptual distinction between perceived service quality and 

customer satisfaction, the distinction has not always been recognized.  For instance, some authors 

(e.g., Schlesinger & Zomitsky,  1991; Tomow & Wiley,  1991) have operationalized customer 

satisfaction in terms of overall satisfaction as well as customer perceptions of other facets of the 

service interaction.  The distinction between service quality and satisfaction is noted, but for 

purposes of the current study, they may be viewed collectively as customer attitudes.

Major Findings in Linking Employee and Customer Attitudes 

The work of Schneider and his colleagues (e.g., Schneider et al.,  1980; Schneider & 

Bowen,  1985) sparked much interest in the relationship between employee and customer 

attitudes.  In addition to Schneider et al.’s early studies, in which data were collected from bank 

employees and customers, others have explored employee-customer links in financial service 

organizations (Brown & Mitchell,  1993; Johnson,  1996; Paradise-Tomow,  1991; Reynierse &

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


Harker,  1992; Ryan, Schmit & Johnson,  1996; Schlesinger & Zomitsky, 1991; Schneider, 

Ashworth, Higgs & Carr,  1996; Schneider, White & Paul,  1998).  Employee-customer attitude 

linkages have been investigated in other employment settings as well, including healthcare 

(Atkins, Stevenson Marshall & Javalgi,  1996), guest services (R. Thompson,  1993; Weaver, 

1994), manufacturing (Tompkins,  1992), retail (Rucci, et al.,  1998; Schlesinger & Heskett, 

1991a; Ulrich, Halbrook, Meder, Stuchlik & Thorpe,  1991; Wiley,  1991) and in other 

organizations providing various specialized services (Schmit & Allscheid,  1995; Thompson, 

1996; Tomow & Wiley,  1991).  Several general conclusions regarding the relationship between 

employee and customer attitudes can be drawn from these studies.

Employees and Customers Share Similar Perceptions of Service Quality

Employees and customers alike have been shown to have similar perceptions of service 

quality and of various service practices. This can be explained by the degree of psychological 

closeness between the employee and customer during a service encounter (Schneider & Bowen, 

1993,  1995).  Adams (1976) characterizes boundary role personnel as being more 

psychologically removed and sometimes physically further away from the organization than its 

other members, but they still represent the organization to the external environment.  Because of 

the boundary role person’s proximity to the external environment, the employee is in a position 

to empathize with the customer, gaining insight into how those being served perceive the 

interaction (Bitner, Booms & Mohr,  1994).  Moreover, since the customer often shares in the 

provision of the service (e.g., filling out paperwork, communicating information to a customer 

service representative), or at the very least has a clear vantage point from which to observe the 

employee’s actions, the customer is able to gain insight into the organization.  Since the 

boundary between employee and customer is often blurred, with both working together toward a

common goal (i.e., completing the service encounter), these two parties share similar perceptions 

of the service encounter.

Schneider et al. (1980) were among the first to examine and find evidence for the 

relationship between employee and customer perceptions of overall service quality; in other 

words, customers perceived higher levels of service at the same time that employees felt they 

were delivering higher levels of service.  Schneider and Bowen (1985) replicated this finding.  In 

addition to similar perceptions of overall service quality, both studies (i.e., Schneider et al.,  1980 

and Schneider & Bowen,  1985) found evidence of shared perceptions regarding other facets of 

service delivery, including strong relationships between employee perceptions of their own 

service orientation and customer perceptions of employee courtesy, as well as between employee 

perceptions of effective branch management and customer perceptions of the branch’s 

administrative effectiveness.  Both of these employee variables (i.e., service orientation and 

perceptions of branch management), as well as employee perceptions that the branch attempted 

to retain its customers and supported employees with equipment and supplies were related to 

customers’ perceptions of overall service quality.  Schlesinger and Zomitsky (1991) found that 

employees’ perceptions that they were able to deliver quality service was strongly related to 

multiple facets of customer satisfaction, such as ease of doing business.  Others have found that 

employees’ customer orientation is related to customer satisfaction with multiple facets of 

service delivery (Wiley,  1991) as well as customer perceptions that employees engage in more 

service-related behaviors (Reynierse & Harker,  1992).

Taken together, these studies lend credence to the idea that customers and employees will 

have similar perceptions o f the service encounter because of the degree of psychological 

closeness during the transaction (Schneider & Bowen,  1993; Ulrich et al.,  1991).  Thus, when

10

employees believe they are providing good service, research suggests customers believe they are 

receiving good service.

Employee Perceptions of the Work Environment are Related to Customer Attitudes

Employee perceptions of particular facets of their work environment are linked to 

customer attitudes.  The more resources employees need to expend coping with impediments to 

effective performance, the less they will have available to spend in service of the customer 

(Schneider & Bowen,  1995).  Consequently, as discussed in the previous section, customers are 

able to perceive the various manifestations of reduced service levels.  On the other hand, 

customers perceive manifestations of enhanced service levels as well.  The notion that there are 

certain facets of the work environment having the potential to improve the service levels 

provided by employees has been termed “work facilitation” (Schneider & Bowen,  1985).

The theme of work facilitation was explicated further recently by Schneider, White and 

Paul (1998).  These authors conceptualize facilitative work conditions (i.e., leadership, 

participation, computer support and training) as only one-half of a set of “foundation issues” 

necessary to support a climate for service (i.e., an infrastructure conducive to the delivery of 

quality service).  The other half of a foundation for service rests on internal service quality, the 

quality of inputs obtained from other areas within the organization (Gulledge,  1991).  Although 

Schneider et al. (1998) did find evidence of divergent validity for these two foundation 

constructs (i.e., facilitative work conditions and internal service quality), no further 

differentiation will be made, since, for purposes of the present paper they are conceptually 

similar.  Internal service quality can be viewed as a single facilitative work condition necessary 

for the delivery of quality service.

Schneider and Bowen (1985) extended the results of Schneider et al., (1980) through their 

examination of the role human resources practices play in governing customer perceptions of 

service quality.  Schneider and Bowen (1985) found a pattern of strong relationships between 

employee perceptions of five human resources practices and customer perceptions of employee 

morale, branch administrative practices and overall quality.  Additionally, to the extent 

employees did not perceive impediments to task performance, customers reported more favorable 

sentiments about the service they received.  In a related vein, Schlesinger and Zomitsky (1991) 

found a pattern of relationships between service representatives’ self-perceived service capability 

and customer satisfaction with a service representative’s competence, interest in helping, general 

concern and availability.  In the organization they studied, Schlesinger and Zomitsky (1991) 

found that positive perceptions of supervisory practices, as well as organizational practices 

facilitating employees’  ability to meet customer needs, were the primary determinants of self­

perceived service capability.  The themes of supervisory satisfaction, latitude on the job to meet 

customer demands and strong internal communications were also observed by Thompson (1996) 

as drivers of customer satisfaction.  Wiley (1991) found customers were more satisfied on a 

variety of service dimensions when employees at a particular retail store were satisfied with 

various facets of the work environment, such as working conditions, co-worker relations, 

supervisory practices, emphasis placed on training, staffing and scheduling and communications. 

He also found customers were more satisfied to the extent employees perceived fewer obstacles 

to performing their job.

Not only do employees and customers share similar perceptions of the service encounter 

(Schneider,  1991), but customer perceptions are related to the attitudes employees have about 

their work environment; specifically, whether or not the work environment supports employees

in their efforts to deliver quality service.  Overall, customers appear to have more favorable 

impressions regarding the service they receive from organizations fostering an environment in 

which employees are able to devote themselves to providing better service.

Delivering Quality Service Requires More than a Friendly Demeanor

Czepiel (1980) stated that “...no amount of pleasant ambiance or smiling can offset a core 

service never provided” (p. 13).  Results from Schneider et al., (1980), for example, support this 

statement, showing that customer satisfaction is driven by both the interpersonal aspects of 

employee-customer communications as well as the ability to deliver  the expected service.

Efforts to manage employees having extensive customer contact (Hartline & Ferrell,  1996) 

therefore need to be more systemic, focusing on more than training employees to exhibit 

stereotypical customer service-oriented behaviors, such as smiling.  Since production and 

consumption occur simultaneously in a service interaction, the interpersonal aspects o f the 

service interaction are important, but an infrastructure must be in place which fosters and 

encourages the exhibition of service oriented behaviors.  Berry and Parasuraman (1991) assert 

that, “How service personnel conduct themselves in the customers’ presence—how they act, what 

they say, what they don’t say, their overall appearance—influences whether customers buy from 

the firm again” (p. 8).  The interpersonal portion of the service interaction will be more pleasing 

to customers to the extent the organization follows a service strategy and is organized for quality 

service (Berry,  1995).

Schneider and Bowen (1995) discuss in some detail what it takes to create an 

infrastructure which supports front-line service personnel in their efforts to deliver quality 

service.  In short, they suggest the necessity of adopting a “service logic” and outline an 

approach for weaving together an organization’s multiple functionalities in such a way that they

all work together in service of the customer.  This approach involves a joint consideration and 

management o f the internal work processes and human interactions which take place between 

employee and customer.  Schlesinger and Heskett (1991a,  1991b) also describe an approach for 

remedying the cycle of failure in service delivery.  Believing poor service delivery is perpetuated 

by management’s cynical view of the labor pool for service positions, Schlesinger and Heskett 

(1991b) review the common elements of strategies used by successful service providers.  All of 

the elements revolve around creating an environment in which service representatives can 

successfully deliver quality service, including employee selection, new employee socialization 

processes, providing an empowering environment, training employees about their role in 

satisfying customers and how it relates to overall organizational success and providing 

employees with feedback for performance improvement.  The resulting customer culture 

(Schneider & Bowen,  1995) results in increased customer satisfaction by creating an 

environment in which employees take greater personal responsibility for organizational success 

(Tomow & Wiley,  1991).

Since it is impossible for an organization to specifically regulate each and every 

interaction between employee and customer, organizations can create a situation where service 

employees regulate their own behavior in the service interaction by creating a culture where 

customer service is the norm.  A climate for service should not only foster the development of 

internal processes facilitating the delivery of customer service, but it should also increase 

customer satisfaction with the interpersonal facet of the service interaction by mitigating the 

likelihood a service worker is perceived as forcing, or faking sincerity due to characteristics of 

the work environment (Ashforth & Humphrey,  1993).  Gulledge (1991) optimistically states,

“It’s possible for quality, as perceived by the external customer, to be very high because of

extraordinary effort on the part of the contact employee in overcoming other deficiencies” (p.

47).  It seems doubtful, however, that even the most conscientious of employees would engage in 

such citizenship behaviors for very long, since, as Zemke (1989) puts it, “Front-line employees 

won’t - and can’t - fight City Hall for very long” (p. 202).  Adams (1976) states that boundary 

role persons are in a unique position to exercise influence over the external environment; it is up 

to management, however, to ensure that this potential is tapped.

Further Findings Stemming from the Use of More Sophisticated Data Analytic Techniques

While the topic of links between employee and customer attitudes has received much 

attention since Schneider and his colleagues first started examining the issue 20 years ago, 

research has only recently progressed beyond showing simple relationships between employee 

and customer variables.  Many of the studies cited above make use of simple correlations as the 

primary data analytic technique.  This shortcoming has also recently been noted by Schneider et 

al. (1998).  The use of more sophisticated statistical techniques enables researchers to address 

more complex research questions, and in some cases strengthens our confidence in findings by 

fortifying the degree to which causal inferences can be made.  Recent years have shown 

structural equation modeling to be extremely useful for extending the linkage research 

theoretically and methodologically.

Schmit and Allscheid (1995) used Bagozzi’s (1992) theoretical model of attitudes, 

intentions and behaviors to explain the relationship between employee attitudes and customer 

satisfaction.  Employing a path model, they found support for the idea that employees evaluate, 

or form impressions, about multiple facets of the work environment (i.e., climate appraisal), 

resulting in a net level of affect (i.e., an emotional response).  Affect, in turn, drives service

15

intentions (i.e., a coping response) which ultimately result in tangible customer service behaviors 

with which customers may or may not be satisfied.

Johnson (1996) addressed a gap in the literature by looking at employee perceptions of 

specific facets of a service climate in relation to customers’ satisfaction with a variety of specific 

service attributes.  He found that each of the  11  service climate dimensions examined was related 

to at least one dimension of customer satisfaction.  Johnson (1996) also found that service 

climate dimensions were differentially related to personal vs. nonpersonal facets o f customer 

satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction with bank statements and banking convenience (nonpersonal 

facets) were related most strongly to service support (i.e., internal cooperation and teamwork) 

and management’s service orientation, respectively.  Results of this study demonstrate that 

employee and customer variables are related even when these two constituencies do not 

personally interact.  Creating an infrastructure for quality service supports not only the 

interpersonal aspects of the service interaction, but also the tangible aspects of service delivery.

In the first study of its kind, Ryan et al. (1996) examined the direction of causality in the 

relationship between employee and customer variables (i.e., whether employee attitudes lead to 

customer satisfaction, or vice-versa).  The employees in this study were front-line service 

representatives of an automobile financing company and interacted with customers via telephone 

and mail.  Analyzing data at two separate points in time, these authors found support for the 

proposition that customer satisfaction leads to employee morale, a significant finding given that 

much of the conventional business wisdom assumes the opposite type of relationship (e.g.,

Heskett et al.,  1997; Thompson,  1993; Tompkins,  1992; Weaver,  1994; Wolf & Gering,  1997). 

One explanation offered by Ryan et al. (1996) for this finding is that employee attitudes may be 

directly influenced by the types of interactions employees typically have with customers in

16

course of performing their job duties.  Given the boundary-spanning role of many front-line 

service representatives, the vast majority of on-the-job time is spent interacting with customers. 

As Ryan et al. state, “Where customers are a primary part of the situation, it seems plausible that 

they will be a situational influence on the attitudes of a unit” (p. 875).  Ryan et al., (1996) 

suggest the type of service interaction be explored in future linkage research.

Schneider et al., (1998) extended Ryan et al. (1996) by providing a second study 

addressing the issue o f direction of causality in a sample of bank tellers.  Schneider et al. (1998) 

found support for a reciprocal relationship between employee and customer variables, using a 

cross-lagged panel analysis of data collected at two different time intervals (two years apart).

They reported paths of equal magnitude leading from global service climate at Time  1  to overall 

customer perceptions of service quality at Time 2 and overall customer perceptions of service 

quality at Time  1  and global service climate at Time 2, indicating that service climate and 

customer perceptions of service quality are interdependent.  Schneider et al., (1998) suggest this 

interdependency of service climate and customer perceptions of service quality occurs through a 

feedback mechanism in which customer data are fed back to employees, resulting in 

organizational changes bolstering the service climate.  Ultimately, the improved service climate 

results in increased perceptions of service quality.

As mentioned, it has not been uncommon for contemporary discussions of employee- 

customer relationships to implicitly assume a direction of causality running from employee to 

customer (Heskett et al.,  1997; Rucci et al.,  1998).  Results, however, of perhaps the two most 

methodologically rigorous studies to date addressing the question of direction of causality, fail to 

confirm this assumption.  Indeed, Ryan et al. (1996) found that customer satisfaction leads to

17

employee morale and Schneider et al., (1998) found an interdependent relationship between 

employee and customer attitudes.  At present, it is unclear what accounts for these differences.

The linkage research to date supports a relationship between employee and customer 

attitudes, however questions do remain.  Research which increases our theoretical understanding 

would be helpful in formulating specific hypotheses about employee attitude-customer attitude 

relationships.  As Ryan et al. (1996) suggested, the type of service interaction an employee has 

with a customer may be a variable worth exploring in this vein.  No research to date has explored 

what effect job type has on the relationship between employee and customer attitudes.  Different 

jobs are accompanied by different sets of expectations; the expectations associated with different 

work roles have implications for how, and under what circumstances, employees interact with 

customers.  Variability in role requirements may in turn affect the relationship between employee 

and customer attitudes.

Role Theory

Role theory can potentially offer insight into the relationship between employee and 

customer attitudes by providing a framework for examining employee-customer interactions 

associated with various work roles.  The concept of role has been described using the theater as a 

metaphor for explaining behavior in organizations (Biddle,  1986; Sarbin & Allen,  1968); just as 

actors play a part on stage, members of an organization “play” a part by “acting” consistently 

with the expectations associated with their job, or work role.  Biddle (1986) succinctly 

summarized this view as it plays out in organizational functioning:  “...role theory may be said to 

concern itself with a triad of concepts:  patterned and characteristic social behaviors, parts or 

identities that are assumed by social participants, and scripts or expectations for behavior that are 

understood by all and adhered to by performers” (p. 68).  Similarly, Katz and Kahn’s (1978)

18

definition of role behavior centers around the recurring behaviors o f a focal person as they 

intertwine with the repeatable aspects of others’ behavior in predictably converting inputs to 

outputs.

The behaviors which define a work role are manifestations of role expectations, which 

can come from a variety of sources, including job descriptions, supervisors, organizational 

members performing the same role and organizational members performing other roles. 

Customers also have expectations of the service personnel with which they interact.  Of course, 

organizational behavior is not as clean-cut as simply acting out a role consistent with 

expectations, since people do not act like automatons, mindlessly carrying out a predetermined 

set of duties.  From a role theory perspective, performing one’s job becomes muddled by other 

factors (Katz & Kahn,  1978) such as role conflict (i.e., receiving conflicting expectations from 

others), role ambiguity (i.e., not being clear about expectations), taking on multiple roles, 

organizational and environmental factors and personality characteristics of the focal person, as 

well as those of others with which the focal person interacts (see Katz & Kahn,  1978 for a 

complete discussion of the organization as a system of roles).

Role conflict and role ambiguity have consistently been cited as key barricades to the 

delivery of quality service (e.g., Berry,  1995; Hartline & Ferrell,  1996; Zeithaml et al.,  1988; 

Zeithaml et al.,  1990).  Employees have less resources to allocate towards serving customers 

when obstacles are present, and consequently become unable or unwilling to perform the tasks, 

or engage in the behaviors required to meet customers’ expectations.  Examples of obstacles in 

the work environment impeding task performance include a lack of preparatory training to handle 

the job, poor internal communications and a lack of efficient work processes necessary to ensure 

a smooth work flow.  When these types of obstacles dominate the work environment, service

workers lose clarity about what it is they should be doing to serve the customer and how it 

should be done (i.e., suffer from role ambiguity).  Obstacles also have the potential to lead to 

inconsistent expectations about who should be doing what (i.e., lead to role conflict).  For 

instance, consider an employee in a bank’s customer service call center who receives a request 

from a customer to waive the fee associated with a late loan payment.  The customer explains the 

late payment was a simple oversight due to a hectic work schedule.  By viewing the customer’s 

payment history at their work station, the service representative is able to verify the customer’s 

contention that it is the first and only late payment in five years.  If no mechanism is in place to 

help employees handle such requests, it is likely the service representative will perceive conflict 

between the customer’s request and management’s expectation that employees not give away 

potential revenues (i.e., waive fees for late payments).  Ultimately, such a seemingly insignificant 

transaction could lead to the loss of a bank’s most preferred type of customer, one who 

consistently pays on time and requires no collection effort.

Zeithaml et al. (1988,  1990) posit that both role conflict and role ambiguity are partially 

responsible for the service performance gap between management’s exact specifications of 

service quality and the service which is actually delivered.  Parasuraman et. al. (1990) found 

some support for this, but suggested any deleterious effects might successfully be counteracted 

by a strong sense of teamwork and high degrees of both employee-job fit and technology-job fit. 

Hartline and Ferrell (1996) found that the negative effects of role ambiguity are augmented by 

role conflict as service workers try to grapple with the competing demands placed on them by 

customers and their own organization.  To make matters worse Hartline and Ferrell also found 

that role ambiguity decreases the self-efficacy of service workers, which has obvious 

implications for these workers’  ability to effectively service customers.  Berry (1995) suggests

20

the challenge o f developing clear service standards which serve as guides for employee behavior, 

noting that role ambiguity can result from no service standards, too many service standards, 

service standards which are too general and service standards which are not connected with 

performance measurement.

An exposition by Shamir (1980) suggests that role conflict can stem from other factors as 

well.  He described distinctions between “subordinate service roles” (e.g., bank teller, cab driver, 

restaurant server) and professional service providers.  Specifically, he noted the former type of 

service worker lacks a particular area of professional expertise and hence, does not set out to alter 

their clients’ behavior in any significant way.  Additionally, the subordinate service worker deals 

with clients whose participation in the service is voluntary (as opposed to being rushed to a 

hospital, for instance), or o f the customers’ own volition.  These two factors converge, resulting 

in the relatively lower status of the service worker compared to the customer.

Shamir (1980) posits that the subordinate status of the service worker results in role 

conflict, and that varied types of person-role conflict (i.e., role demands of the job running 

against an employee’s internal standards) or intersender conflict (i.e., different role expectations 

from different sources) can result in varied responses from the subordinate service worker.

Given that some researchers (e.g., Hartline & Ferrell,  1996) have found evidence that role 

conflict and role ambiguity result in a reduced ability to serve the customer, thereby lowering 

perceptions of service quality, it is important to understand the possible impact of performing a 

service role having the potential to breed role conflict or role ambiguity.  Shamir (1980) 

reviewed several possible employee reactions to role conflict, including avoidance of contact 

with customer, psychological withdrawal and a corresponding increase in the automaticity of 

behavior, overacting (thereby increasing identification with the work role), attempting to control

21

the interaction and attempting to educate the customer.  While it is arguable whether some 

positions are inherently subservient, Shamir’s (1980) commentary does shed light on the 

potential consequences of a service provider perceiving themselves as subservient to the 

customer.

Depending on the given situation and surrounding circumstances, each type of reaction 

discussed by Shamir (1980) might be expected to differentially affect the relationship between 

employee and customer attitudes.  For instance, attempts to educate a customer about a choice 

they have made could be perceived as either intrusiveness or helpfulness, depending on how the 

service worker handles the task and how receptive the customer is to such advances.  Even 

psychological withdrawal resulting in performing one’s duties in a state of mindless automaticity 

might not result in lowered perceptions of service quality, if it is expected and inconsequential to 

the service interaction at hand (Soloman, Surprenant, Czepiel & Gutman,  1985).  When paying 

the cashier at a gas station, who, in urban environments is often seated behind a sheet of bullet­

proof glass, satisfaction is probably driven by the cashier’s ability to complete transactions in a 

timely manner, and not by their ability to engage customers in friendly banter.

The type of job being performed has implications for how an employee interacts with a 

customer (if at all), because each job comes with its own associated set of expectations.  Linkage 

studies to date have typically involved incumbents of a single job type (e.g., all bank tellers; 

Brown and Mitchell,  1993  is an exception).  Moreover, much of these data have been collected 

from individuals holding similar types of front-line service jobs (e.g., bank tellers, hotel clerks, 

airline check-in and ticket handlers, restaurant personnel).  Although authors have not typically 

provided much substantive information about the job duties of these service personnel, most 

appear to primarily handle routine, predictable transactions as well as some customer complaints.

22

To cope with role conflict and role ambiguity in these front-line service jobs, various approaches 

have been recommended for facilitating effective task performance, such as creating a service 

logic (Schneider & Bowen,  1995) or a climate for service (Schneider et al.,  1998).

Despite the ubiquity of front-line service personnel, there are other types of service 

workers.  For instance, a customer has the potential to interact with several employees holding 

different jobs at an insurance agency.  In addition to a customer service representative who may 

take preliminary information when a claim is filed, a customer might also interact with 

representatives from underwriting and claims adjustment.  One can imagine the different types of 

interactions a customer might have with these individuals, ranging from a relatively innocuous 

interaction with a front-line service representative, who gathers information, to the potentially 

hostile interaction with a claims adjuster who denies a claim.  In a hospital setting, a patient 

interacts with many more individuals than physicians, such as admissions personnel, nursing 

staff, laboratory technicians and other skilled professionals such as respiratory, speech and 

occupational therapists.  It would be beneficial to study multiple job types within a single 

organization to examine whether different types of service interactions, in the context of a single 

service offering (e.g., a stay in the hospital) are differentially related to customer attitudes.

Exploring theTvpe of Service Interaction for its Effects on Emplovee-Customer Attitude

Relationships

There is some evidence to suggest that the type of service interaction is a variable worth 

exploring in linkage research.  Bitner et al., (1994) pointed out that both Schneider et al. (1980) 

and Schneider and Bowen (1985) demonstrated positive relationships between employee and 

customer perceptions of service quality in a sample of bank tellers but that Brown and Swartz 

(1989) reported a clear divergence in perceptions of the service delivered between physicians and

23

their patients.  Both jobs (e.g., bank teller and physician) clearly involve a high degree of 

interaction with the customer, yet these researchers drew dissimilar conclusions regarding the 

convergence of employee and customer perceptions.  While it is unclear exactly what could 

account for this discrepancy, there are a couple of possible explanations.  Most noticeable is the 

difference in job type; bank tellers are essentially front-line service representatives, performing 

what Shamir (1980) termed a subordinate service role, while physicians are professional service 

providers.  Service agents with a greater degree of power and status relative to the customer (e.g., 

physicians) have more latitude to deliver services in a manner somewhat different from what 

customers might expect (Ashforth & Humphrey,  1993).  In light of the individual discretion 

associated with the service delivery practices of physicians,  it is not all that surprising that 

differences in perceptions would exist in this sample, more so than in a sample o f bank tellers. 

However, another possible explanation is that Bitner et al.’s (1994) conclusions regarding the 

findings of Brown and Swartz (1989) are suspect, and that based on the data presented in Brown 

and Swartz, it is not really possible to ascertain if their findings are in opposition to those of 

Schneider and his colleagues.  Specifically, Bitner et al.’s conclusion of a lack of correlation 

between employee and customer perceptions in Brown and Swartz seems tenuous, given Brown 

and Swartz’s use of gap, or difference scores.1

1  It should be noted that the conclusions reached by Bitner et al., (1994) regarding Brown and 
Swartz (1989) are somewhat unclear.  In reference to the Brown and Swartz article, Bitner et al. 
state, “These researchers gathered data on patient experiences with their physicians and 
compared them with the physicians’ perceptions of their patients’ experiences.  The differences 
they found were rather large and inversely related to patient satisfaction” (p. 96).  Brown and 
Swartz employed gap scores in their study.  The gap score in question was computed as client 
experiences minus professional perceptions of client experiences.  Participants responded to 
positively phrased items using a five-point Likert-type scale, with 5 indicating a strong level of 
agreement.  Brown and Swartz hypothesized that, “The level of positive client evaluation [as 
measured by a single overall satisfaction item] of the professional service is related positively to

2 4

Stronger evidence of the possibility that the type o f service interaction makes a difference 

in the relationship between employee and customer attitudes can be found in Brown and Mitchell 

(1993), who studied the obstacles to effective service delivery in a sample of tellers and account 

representatives within the same banking organization.  They speculated that each position’s 

obstacles to performance would differentially affect customer satisfaction, depending on the 

amount o f customer contact and the degree to which persons holding different positions can 

control the rate at which they come into contact with customers.  Different degrees of customer 

contact imply different job duties, and thus different obstacles to performing these duties.  Bank 

tellers have more contact with customers than do account representatives, who perform duties 

such as opening new accounts for customers.  In the sample of tellers, Brown and Mitchell 

(1993) found that the largest negative correlates of customer perceptions of employee 

friendliness and of overall customer satisfaction stemmed from disruptions to employee work 

breaks and problems with co-workers.  In contrast to the social obstacles in the teller sample, 

customer satisfaction was negatively related to more technical work issues in the sample of

gap 3” (p. 93). To the contrary of Bitner et al.’s conclusions, Brown and Swartz found strong 
positive correlations between the gap scores (i.e., client experiences minus professional 
perceptions of client experiences) and the overall measure of satisfaction.  Regardless of the 
veracity of Bitner et al.’s conclusions regarding Brown and Swartz’s findings, the choice to cite 
Brown and Swartz as research standing in contradiction to Schneider and his colleagues should 
be questioned unequivocally.  Schneider et al., (1980) and Schneider and Bowen (1985) found 
correlations between employee and customer perceptions of service.  Because of the use of gap, 
or difference scores, similar conclusions can not be confirmed or denied based on the data 
presented in Brown and Swartz.  It is possible for patient and physician perceptions to 
consistently covary; thus, patient and physician perceptions could be strongly correlated, while 
still showing “gaps” when looking at difference scores across cases of data.  For instance, 
consider the following example item used in the Brown and Swartz study, “My doctor hears what
I have to say” (p. 95).  If 10 patients all strongly agreed with the statement (i.e., used a 5 on the 
response scale) and each physician’s perception o f their patient’s experience was neutral on the 
item (i.e., used a 3 on the response scale), each case of data would have an associated gap score 
of 2 (i.e., 5-3), yet patient and physician perceptions would be perfectly correlated.

account representatives.  It is unclear in this study if all customers had contact with both types of 

employees, or only one to the exclusion of the other.  This is important because example items 

from the customer satisfaction survey suggest that both employee groups (i.e., tellers and account 

representatives) were referenced in the question; thus it is unclear exactly how employee and 

customer attitudes were linked explicitly by job type.  Regardless, this study does suggest the 

merit in simultaneously studying multiple job types (i.e., types o f service interactions) within the 

same organization.

Further evidence that the type of service interaction is a variable worth exploring can be 

found by contrasting the findings reported by Ryan et al. (1996) and Schneider et al. (1998). 

Although both supplied the caveat that their research was not unequivocal proof of a causal 

direction between employee and customer attitudes, their results are suggestive of differences in 

samples of employees which appear to be similar on the surface.  Both Ryan et al. and Schneider 

et al. used samples o f front-line service representatives in financial institutions, however those in 

the Ryan et al. study dealt with clients experiencing problems, such as lost payments or 

delinquency on loan payments.  Those in the Schneider et al. study appear to have handled more 

routine, or at least affectively neutral banking transactions.  Recall that in Ryan et al. evidence 

was found for a causal direction leading from customer satisfaction to employee morale and in 

Schneider et al. evidence was found for a reciprocal, or interdependent relationship between 

employee perceptions of a service climate and customer perceptions of service quality.

Given the types of problems customers experienced (a lost payment or carrying an 

account in delinquency), Ryan et al. (1996) speculated, and found some evidence for the notion 

that negative affectivity flowed from customers to the employees who interacted with them.

Using Shamir’s (1980) framework, reduced employee morale in Ryan et al. may have stemmed

from the barrage of negativity flowing from delinquent customers, resulting in service 

representatives psychologically withdrawing from their work roles and performing their duties in 

an automatic fashion to mitigate the effects of these undesirable interactions.2  Because of their 

withdrawal, employees may have done little to reciprocate, or influence customer perceptions, as 

individuals occupying boundary roles are uniquely qualified to do (Adams,  1976).  In recognition 

of the difficult position some service representatives routinely find themselves in as a function of 

their work role, Shamir (1980) suggests it would be prudent for management to take steps to train 

and prepare their service personnel to cope with unpleasant service interactions to reduce role 

conflict and the consequential role stress (Katz & Kahn,  1978).  As mentioned throughout this 

paper, by creating a service logic (Schneider & Bowen,  1995) or paying attention to the 

foundation issues necessary for a service climate (Schneider et al.,  1998), a service worker might 

be in a better position to foster goodwill during the service interaction.

Soloman et al. (1985) defined expectations in the service encounter in terms of the 

expected role behaviors associated with both employee and customer in a service interaction.

That is, customers will be less satisfied with the service transaction when the service provider 

deviates from expected role behaviors in a manner deemed undesirable by the customer. 

According to Soloman et al. (1985) many service encounters, however, are low in involvement, 

making each party’s expected role behaviors fairly predictable.  For instance, in a retail store the 

customer takes merchandise to a cashier, who informs the customer how much to pay.  The 

customer pays for the merchandise with cash, check or credit card and the cashier may then issue

a receipt, bag the merchandise or both.  Solman et al. speculate that these routine service 

encounters occur in a state of mindlessness, sometimes resulting in no customer evaluation. 

Conversely, a service provider’s behaviors become more conspicuous, and thus scrutinized more 

closely in personal interactions where a customer has a high degree of involvement.  In general, 

Soloman et al. (1985) postulate that, “...satisfaction is positively related to predictability for low 

involvement services, and positively related to flexibility/personalization in the case of high 

involvement services” (p.  107).

Through their research, Zeithaml et al. (1990) identified  10 dimensions of service quality 

influencing customers’ assessment of the service interaction (tangibles, reliability, 

responsiveness, competence, courtesy, credibility, security, access, communication and 

understanding the customer).  As put forth by Soloman et al. (1985), customers expect service 

personnel to do certain things or behave in a certain way, depending on the nature of the service 

interaction.  Zeithaml et al.’s (1990) model of service quality provides a means for classifying 

these expected role behaviors3.  The different types of service interactions in which customers 

can possibly engage is practically endless, and customers do not expect or value the same thing 

in all of these interactions.

The literature on emotional labor (e.g., Hochschild,  1979) offers another useful 

perspective for considering differences in service interactions and the implications this has for 

the employee-customer attitude relationship.  Ashforth and Humphrey (1993) defined emotional

contact, thus some of the customers in the study may not have participated in service interactions 
voluntarily.
3  While Zeithaml et al.’s (1990b) model explicates  10 separate dimensions of service quality, not 
all of these dimensions make appropriate categories for classifying the behaviors of service 
personnel.  For instance, the tangibles dimension refers to the appearance of the physical aspects 
in a service interaction, such as facilities, equipment and personnel.

labor as “the display of expected emotions by service agents during service encounters” (p. 88). 

They argue that service positions have an associated set of “display rules” which define the 

appropriate exhibition of an employee’s emotion during a given service interaction.  In 

displaying these emotions, employees may either act in accordance with expectations, or they 

may display genuine emotion, depending on how much the employee identifies with their service 

role.  Given that the service interaction is a human interaction (Soloman et al.,  1985), customer 

perceptions of the interpersonal aspects of the service interaction play a part in perceptions of 

service quality (Zeithaml, Parasuraman & Berry,  1990).  The service interaction stands a greater 

chance of being deemed high quality to the extent service representatives’ behaviors are viewed 

as genuine, in customers’ eyes.  In keeping with the principle of partial inclusion (Katz & Kahn, 

1978), to the extent employees lend more of themselves to their work, the interaction stands a 

greater chance being perceived as sincere.

Ashforth and Humphrey (1993) state that expectations regarding appropriate emotional 

displays are governed by general societal norms, and as such can be ascertained by observing 

customer expectations.  They note, however, that expectations could possibly vary as a function 

of several factors, including occupation and the particular service being rendered.  In a healthcare 

setting, it is quite conceivable that patients have different expectations of the personnel with 

whom they interact.  John (1991) stated that recipients of healthcare services have dual needs: 

medical needs (i.e., the technical quality of the medical care received) and psychosocial needs 

(i.e., how the medical care is actually delivered).  He argues that it is incumbent on nurses and 

physicians to satisfy the psychosocial needs of patients, given the high degree of personal contact 

they have with patients relative to other hospital staff.  In terms of expected emotional displays 

from hospital staff, then, a patient might expect more compassion from a nurse than from the lab

technician who intermittently draws blood.  Beyond expected emotional displays, a description 

of the hospital nursing staff by Atkins et al. (1996) suggests differences in general expectations 

that patients may hold regarding those filling different healthcare roles:  “Because the nursing 

staff spends more time with the patient than any other member of the health care team, patients 

tend to associate nurses with the interpersonal or ‘hotel’ aspects of care, including accessibility 

and availability of care, continuity of care, patient convenience, and physical environment...” (p. 

17).  Thus, it appears that healthcare administrators place great emphasis on the staffs of nurses 

and physicians in governing customers’ perceptions of healthcare quality.  It is less clear, 

however, what role other healthcare personnel play when customers evaluate quality.

The delivery of healthcare can not be viewed as a singular service interaction, as can 

placing an order at a fast food restaurant.  A visit to the hospital involves multiple interactions 

with service personnel holding different sets of responsibilities.  It is unclear, however, how 

patients’ expectations may differ as a function of what type of staff person they interact with. 

Some expectations may cut across positions, from lab technician to physician; because of the 

personal nature of the services rendered, healthcare is a high involvement service interaction for 

customers, and as such recipients expect their psychosocial needs be met (John,  1991), or stated 

differently, that medical services be delivered humanistically and respectfully (Bitran & Hoech, 

1990).  Other expectations may pertain to some provider positions, but not others.  For instance, 

due to the high level of contact with their nurses and physicians, patients expect a high degree of 

personal involvement from these two groups of service providers in the course of their 

interactions (Atkins et al.  1996; John,  1991).  Quite possibly, this level of interaction is not 

expected from the respiratory therapist, or other medical professional, who visits a patient less 

frequently than a nurse and acts in supporting fashion to the physician.

Hypotheses

The hypotheses in this study are based on the early work o f Schneider and his colleagues 

(Schneider et al.,  1980; Schneider & Bowen,  1985), who demonstrated a relationship between 

employee and customer perceptions of service, and subsequently a relationship between 

employee perceptions of their work environment and customer attitudes.  While this early work 

was useful for establishing links, other research may be used to fine tune what is known about 

the relationships between employee and customer attitudes.  Specifically, there is some research 

suggestive of the notion that the type of service interaction, which is governed largely by the 

duties and responsibilities associated with a job, can differentially affect the relationship between 

employee and customer attitudes.  Stated differently, the duties and responsibilities associated 

with different work roles (Biddle,  1986; Katz & Kahn,  1978) result in different types of service 

interactions, leading to potential differences in employee-customer attitude relationships (e.g., 

Brown & Mitchell,  1993).

Initial exploratory analyses were performed in order to formulate more specific 

hypotheses than would have otherwise been possible.  Efforts were first undertaken to determine 

the underlying factor structure of both the employee and patient satisfaction data sets.  The factor 

analyses were useful for articulating which specific facets of employee satisfaction might be 

related to patient satisfaction.

Hypothesis  la .  There will be a positive relationship between employee and customer 

attitudes.4  Schneider et al. (1980) and Schneider and Bowen (1985) established a relationship 

between employee and customer attitudes.

4  As originally formulated and phrased, the hypotheses were to be tested using structural 
equation modeling as the primary data analytic technique.  For instance, Hypothesis la  could

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


31

Hypothesis lb.  The relationship between employee and customer attitudes will be 

stronger for those positions involving greater contact with the patient.  Brown and Mitchell 

(1993) found support for the notion that this relationship would be stronger for service personnel 

with a high degree of customer contact, since the element of human interaction is weighed 

heavily in evaluating service quality (Zeithaml et al., 1990).

In the current study, it was expected the strongest relationships between employee and 

patient attitudes would be found between nurses and patients, since nurses are involved with 

patients at a deeper level and have more frequency of contact relative to other patient care 

positions involved in this study.  Next, it was expected that relationships would exist between 

those positions delivering patient care, but which do not play a central role in the coordination of 

care (i.e., are more focused and specialized in nature, in terms of the purpose of interaction with 

the patient).  Generally speaking, these positions also involve less contact with the patient in 

terms of frequency.  Exemplars are staff positions in the following areas:  respiratory therapy, 

laboratory, x-ray/radiology, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.  Finally, 

it was expected the relationships of the lowest strength would be between patients and employees 

working in environmental services (room and hospital cleanliness), dietary services (food 

delivery), general admissions and billing.

have been tested by examining fit indices for a model linking a latent employee satisfaction 
variable with a latent customer satisfaction variable across all job types included in the study. 
Ryan et al. (1996) took this approach in testing a similarly phrased hypothesis.  Hypothesis lb 
could have been tested using a multi-sample structural equation model, assessing model fit for 
each of several different job types.  Hypothesis 2 could have been tested by assessing the 
strength of path coefficients between latent employee attitude dimensions and a latent customer 
satisfaction variable for different job types as specified in the hypothesis.  As discussed in 
Chapter III, sample size restrictions eliminated structural equation modeling as a viable data 
analytic technique.  Under alternative correlational analyses, the falsifiability of Hypothesis  la is

Hypothesis 2.  For those positions involving a greater degree of customer contact, 

employee attitudes regarding the social aspects of the work environment (e.g., attitudes about the 

work environment involving interactions with co-workers) will be most strongly related to 

customer attitudes.  For those positions involving a lesser degree of customer contact, employee 

attitudes regarding the technical aspects o f the work environment (e.g., administrative 

practices/policies) will be most strongly related to customer attitudes.  Support for this 

hypothesis comes from Brown and Mitchell (1993), who found that the social aspects of the job 

were more strongly related to customer attitudes for service personnel with more customer 

contact because this facet of the employee’s work environment was most visible to the customer.

In the current study, it was expected that nurses’ satisfaction with their co-workers, 

supervisor and satisfaction with recognition for good performance would be most strongly 

related to patient satisfaction.  It was also expected that nurses’ perceptions of their feeling 

informed about organizational events, their understanding of the healthcare industry and their 

satisfaction with administrative policies and procedures would be related to patient satisfaction 

but to a lesser extent than the aforementioned variables.  The reason for this is that while nurses 

have the greatest frequency of contact with patients, they are also involved with patients on a 

technical level (vis-a-vis Brown & Mitchell,  1993).  For staff positions in the areas of respiratory 

therapy, laboratory, x-ray/radiology, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, 

the variables demonstrating the strongest relationship to patient satisfaction were expected to be 

feeling informed about organizational events, understanding of the healthcare industry and their 

satisfaction with administrative policies and procedures.

open to question and might be more appropriately viewed as a general research question. 
Hypotheses  lb and 2 were still able to be adequately addressed.

CHAPTER II 

Method 

Research Participants

Attitudinal data were collected from the employees and patients o f a healthcare system 

located in the Northwestern part of Ohio.  A total of 6,000 employee opinion surveys were 

printed and made available to employees at five distinct hospitals, members of the healthcare 

system’s Primary Care Network (i.e., separate doctors’ offices located throughout the region) and 

members of the healthcare system’s regional staff (i.e., management).  Participation in the survey 

process was voluntary.  Additionally, all employees in the healthcare system were eligible to 

participate, regardless of job level, location, department, tenure, gender, ethnic group or age. 

Physicians were the only exception; the work-related issues and concerns facing this group are 

often sufficiently different from the issues facing the rest of the hospital staff to warrant a 

separate survey instrument; this was the case in the hospital system’s current survey process.

Discharged patients were contacted at random by a third-party vendor and asked to 

volunteer 10 minutes of their time to participate in a telephone survey about their recent inpatient 

stay at a particular hospital.

Employee Attitude Measure

The 58-item survey instrument used in the present study was developed by Stanard & 

Associates, Inc., a private consulting firm in Chicago, Illinois, in conjunction with the client 

healthcare organization.  Survey categories and items reflect the organizational issues of most 

importance to the client healthcare organization.  Since the survey instrument was customized for 

the client organization, no a-priori psychometric properties for the instrument were available.  As 

mentioned, the instrument contains 58 items, each of which belongs to one of 13 rationally

derived survey categories, which are as follows:  1) administration, 2) co-workers, 3) supervisor, 

4) involvement/empowerment, 5) department, 6) job and organization satisfaction, 7) career 

development, 8) communication, 9) pay/benefits,  10) respect/fairness,  11) job security,  12) 

recognition,  13) regionalization.  Responses to the 58 items were collected using a five-point 

scale (i.e., strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree and don’t know/not applicable). 

Each location was given the option of adding up to four unique items to survey, however only 

the 58 items common across all locations were used in analyses.  Finally, respondents were 

invited to respond to an open-ended question.  The items appearing on the survey instrument are 

listed in Appendix A.

Demographic Variables

Location.  Employees identified their job location as one of the five hospitals, the 

Primary Care Network, or Regional Staff.

Job Code.  Employees identified themselves as belonging to one of three management 

groups, or one of seven non management groups.  The three choices under “Management” were:

1) Administration (i.e., CEO, VPs, Chiefs), 2) Department Head or 3) All Others (i.e., managers, 

supervisors, assistant managers).  The seven choices under “Non Management” were:  1) 

Business Office and Clerical (i.e., clerks, secretaries, typists, cashiers, unit secretaries, buyers, 

receptionists, office coordinators, transcriptionists), 2) RN (i.e., staff nurses, RN charge nurses, 

clinical specialists, RN education instructors, etc.), 3) Other Professionals (i.e., nurse 

practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, 

speech pathologists, dieticians, social workers, respiratory therapists, medical technologists, 

exercise physiologists, physicists, radiological technologists, programmers, systems analysts, 

etc.), 4) Technicians (i.e., LPNs, phlebotomists, medical laboratory technicians, surgery

35

technicians, respiratory therapy technicians, graphics technicians, mental health technicians, 

paramedics, EMTs, COTAs, LPTAs), 5) Service Workers (i.e., nursing assistants, environmental 

service workers, dietary workers, store room assistants, transporters, couriers, patient care 

technicians, orderlies, central supply workers, aides), 6) Skilled and Unskilled Maintenance 

Workers (i.e., bio-med, technicians, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, mechanics, maintenance 

workers, etc.) and 7) Security.

Job Status.  Employees indicated their job status by selecting one of the following three 

categories:  1) full-time, 2) part-time or 3) all others (e.g., contract workers, .individuals 

temporarily working at a location or facility).

Length of Service.  Employees indicated their tenure as:  1) less than one year, 2) one to 

four years, 3) five to ten years, 4) eleven to twenty years or 5) twenty years or more.  The non­

mutual exclusivity of the Length of Service response options (i.e., if an individual had 20 years 

of service, it is unclear whether one would choose response option 4 or 5) was an error in survey 

development which went undetected.  While unfortunate, this oversight should not pose a threat 

to the current study, given that Length of Service is not a variable being formally explored.

Shift.  Employees indicated their work shift by selecting one of the following four 

options:  1) day, 2) evening, 3) night or 4) rotate.

Racial Heritage.  Employees from only one of the five hospitals were asked to indicate 

their racial heritage.  Employees identified themselves as belonging to one of the following five 

options ethnic groups:  1) White, 2) Black, 3) Hispanic, 4) Asian/Pacific Islander or 5) Native 

American/Alaskan Native.

Gender.  Employees from only one of the five hospitals were asked to indicate their 

gender (this is the same hospital which asked respondents to identify their racial heritage).

Employees identified themselves as either male or female.  The single hospital which chose to 

collect race and gender data was also the largest of the five participating hospitals, and as such 

deemed this information potentially useful.  The other hospitals did not anticipate that significant 

value would be added to the survey process by collecting such data.

Supervisor.  Employees from all locations identified their immediate supervisor. 

Respondents at each location were provided with list of supervisors and were asked to select 

their immediate supervisor from a list accompanying the survey instrument.

Patient Attitude Measure 

The Adult Inpatient Survey is a telephone interview protocol developed by a third-party 

vendor to the client healthcare organization.  The third-party vendor routinely obtains the records 

of patients discharged from the client healthcare organization.  Patients are contacted 

approximately one month after discharge via telephone, informed about the purpose of the call 

and asked if they would like to participate in a survey regarding their recent inpatient stay which 

will last about 10 minutes.  The interview protocol asks patients about the following topics or 

personnel groups:  1) finding the hospital/hospital signage, 2) admissions, 3) food, 4) 

room/hospital cleanliness, 5) nurses, 6) doctors, 7) x-ray/radiology staff, 8) laboratory staff, 9) 

physical therapy staff,  10) occupational therapy staff,  11) respiratory therapy staff,  12) speech 

therapy staff,  13) home care,  14) billing,  15) overall satisfaction and 16) current medical 

condition.

The vast majority of the items appearing on the patient interview protocol employed a 

five-point Likert-type response scale (i.e., strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly 

agree).  Interviewees were not presented with them as response options, but interviewers could

37

also code a response with “Don’t Know” or “Refused.”  The items appearing on the patient 

interview protocol are listed in Appendix B.

Classifying Healthcare Positions 

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of the type o f service 

interaction on the relationship between employee and customer attitudes.  Although job code 

information was collected from respondents, it was necessary to further classify the healthcare 

positions according to the type of customer contact.  For instance, the Other Professionals job 

code category on the employee survey contained a disparate group of professional positions.

Both a respiratory therapist and an occupational therapist would have used the same job code 

category, but it was not clear whether or not incumbents in these positions interact with patients 

in similar ways.  The job code information was certainly useful, but further classifying positions 

provided another means of addressing the research questions.

Job descriptive information was collected from the client healthcare organization for each 

position for which employee and patient attitude data were available.  Additionally, general 

position descriptions from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles were reviewed.  Insight 

regarding the differences in service positions at the client healthcare organization were also 

gained by examining existing taxonomies of service functions.

Chase (1978,  1981) has examined the provision of services from an operations 

management standpoint.  Specifically, he has examined the efficiency of the service delivery 

process.  He maintains that the extent to which the degree of contact an employee has with a 

customer is reduced or mechanized will have implications for the efficiency with which that 

service may be rendered.  This stems, in large part, from Chase's (1978) assertion that service 

systems involving a high degree of customer contact are more difficult to control due to the

3 8

element o f unpredictability introduced by human behavior.  Chase (1978) classified service 

systems by the degree of customer contact required during the creation of a service.  His 

classification scheme ranges from low contact to high contact and covers four distinct types of 

service systems:  1) manufacturing, 2) quasimanufacturing, 3) mixed service and 4) pure service.

While Chase (1978) classified the delivery of health care as a pure service, involving a 

high degree of customer contact, it is possible (and indeed likely) that not all health care service 

positions involve the same degree of customer contact, or type of customer contact.  Booms and 

Nyquist (1981) developed an approach for classifying the types of communications which take 

place between employee and customer as a function of the type of service position and the 

associated communication demands placed on employees by customers.  In large part, their 

approach segregates service roles by the depth of customer contact associated with a particular 

position.  Table  1  summarizes the key differences among service provider roles by job type, 

according to Booms and Nyquist (1981).  The “Type 1” service worker describes most front-line 

service personnel — individuals serving as the first and primary point of contact between the 

customer and the firm who are responsible for handling routine transactions, responding in 

limited fashion to basic inquiries, concerns and requests and establishing customer relationships 

quickly.  Although they were not prominent in the early 1980’s, when Booms and Nyquist 

formulated their taxonomy, workers in customer service call centers might also fall under the 

Type  1  category.  Compared to Type  1  workers, “Type 2” workers have service interactions 

which are longer in duration, repeat or ongoing in nature and are at a deeper level.  Type 2 

workers are generally not interchangeable.  In Booms and Nyquist’s taxonomy, the “Type 3” 

service worker engages in the most complex communications with customers.  As is the case 

with the Type 2 worker, Type 3 workers are generally not interchangeable.  Because interactions

are complex and dynamic in nature and may not be repeatable, there is a cumulative build-up of

knowledge and trust which takes place between the customer and service provider.

Healthcare positions were classified rationally by the author, with the assistance of 

human resource professionals at each participating hospital.  Job descriptive information 

provided by the client healthcare organization and the position descriptions obtained from the 

Dictionary of Occupational Titles were also useful for shedding light on differences and 

similarities in healthcare roles.  Human resource professionals at each hospital were provided 

with a list of work groups and asked which were most similar in terms of the type of interaction

with the patient.  The work groups each person was asked about mirrored those work groups 

referenced on the patient satisfaction survey.

To help guide the discussion, participants were shown a copy of Booms and Nyquist’s 

(1981) taxonomy of communications functions.  Participants were also prompted with a list of 

additional considerations, such as the frequency of patient contact (e.g., hourly, daily, 

sporadically during the course of an inpatient visit, etc.), the type of contact (e.g., whether or not 

verbal communication is required), the scheduled versus unscheduled nature of the visit and the 

context of the contact (e.g., delivery of patient care, provision of an administrative service, etc.). 

In keeping with the literature reviewed earlier, others factors the participants were asked to 

consider in clustering service roles included whether incumbents in any job group were more 

likely than others to perform extra-role behaviors, whether incumbents in any particular job 

group were more or less likely to be put in a position where sincerity is faked and whether 

incumbents in any particular job group were more or less likely to be viewed by the patient as 

subservient in status.  Appropriate definitions of these terms and concepts were provided to 

participants and additional questions were answered where necessary.

Based on input from all sources and materials, job groups were clustered as follows:  1) 

nursing staff and emergency admissions personnel, 2) respiratory therapy staff, laboratory staff 

and x-ray/radiology staff, 3) physical therapy staff, occupational therapy staff and speech therapy 

staff, 4) environmental services and dietary services and 5) general admissions and billing.  At 

first glance, nursing staff and emergency admissions personnel may seem to be an odd 

combination, but after conversations with human resource personnel, the emergency admissions 

area can in some respects be viewed as another nursing unit.  The primary function of the work 

group has more to do with treating a patient than with an administrative interaction.  Also, most

of the employee data captured from emergency admissions departments were from nurses, as 

opposed to business office or clerical personnel.

Respiratory therapy, laboratory and x-ray/radiology were grouped together because of 

similarities in the type of interaction all have with the patient.  As put by one of the human 

resource professionals, jobs in these areas make extensive use of apparatus, whereas jobs in 

physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy (the next clustering of groups) are 

more relationship-oriented.  Another way of putting it might be to say that in the first case (i.e., 

respiratory therapy, laboratory and x-ray/radiology) things are being done to the patient, whereas 

in the second case (i.e., physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy) things are 

being done with the patient.  Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy also 

share the characteristic of being recuperative in the sense that they help patient rebuild life skills 

and are conducive to being done on an outpatient basis.

Environmental services and dietary services were grouped together because these groups 

are both indirectly involved with patients during the course of an inpatient visit, as opposed to 

before or after a visit (as is the case with general admissions and billing).  The interactions 

environmental and dietary services personnel have with patients do not involve the delivery of 

patient care, nor are they administrative in nature; they share the trait of providing the patient 

with “comfort care” (i.e., a clean environment and food).  The general admissions and billing 

areas were grouped together because of their administrative nature and because they are distinct 

from other work groups in that incumbents in these areas do not routinely interact with patients 

while they are receiving inpatient care.

It should be noted there was not 100% unanimity among human resource personnel about 

how work groups should be clustered.  The author met with or discussed matters with human

resource personnel from each hospital separately, not as a group.  Furthermore, to avoid any 

response bias, the author did not disclose how their counterparts responded.  Time was limited 

for discussions with the hospital human resource personnel due to on-going organizational 

activities, but it may have been the case that consensus could have been reached had the author 

requested a meeting where all parties could attend.  In any event, the groupings outlined above 

are reasonable and represent the general sentiment of the human resource personnel interviewed.

Forming Emplovee-Patient Links at the Work Group Level 

Analyses in this study were performed at the work unit level.  This section describes how 

links were formed between the employee and patient data sets at the work group level. 

Participants in the employee survey identified their location, job type, immediate supervisor and 

identified themselves as performing one of several different types of jobs.  Thus, employee data 

could be aggregated by hospital, by supervisor and job type.

For each record of patient satisfaction data, there was an associated location identifier and 

nursing discharge unit.  This information made it possible to ascertain the hospital, and more 

specifically, the particular nursing unit from which each patient was ultimately discharged.

While it is possible that a patient could have spent time in more than a single nursing unit in the 

course of their inpatient stay, this was the organizing device used by the client healthcare 

organization in tracking its patient satisfaction data.  Thus, in forming work group links, it was 

possible to aggregate patient satisfaction data to the nursing discharge unit level, and then to 

match those data with data obtained from hospital employees reporting to the supervisor of a 

particular discharge unit.

To summarize, the organizing device for the employee data was the first line of 

supervision for a particular department within a particular hospital.  On the patient side of the

analysis, data were grouped by nursing discharge unit within each hospital.  For example, data 

from patients discharged from Nursing Unit A in Hospital A were aggregated and linked with 

aggregated data from employees indicating they reported to the supervisor of Nursing Unit A in 

Hospital A.

In addition to asking patients questions about their satisfaction with nurses, patients were 

also asked about their satisfaction with hospital staff performing other functions (e.g., laboratory 

staff, x-ray/radiology staff, etc.) and about other factors not directly attributable to any particular 

hospital department (e.g., the staff working well together to coordinate patient care).  This was 

potentially problematic given that patient data were organized only by nursing discharge unit. 

Stated differently, other than the nursing discharge unit information, there were no organizing 

variables in the patient data providing for an easy match-up of non-nursing-related patient 

satisfaction data with the appropriate employee work groups.

To address this problem and provide some means of linking relevant patient data with the 

relevant employee data, a workable solution was required.  The approach taken was to replicate 

the entire patient satisfaction data matrix several times and separately link it with the appropriate 

employee data.  This was done each time patient satisfaction information could clearly be 

associated with an identifiable employee work group through the creation of linkage codes.

These manually created linkage codes were similar to the already available nursing discharge 

unit codes, but for non-nursing-related patient satisfaction data.  The matching process was 

facilitated through the use of organizational charts, records and by in-depth discussions with 

helpful staff at each location.  For example, patient satisfaction information regarding the x- 

ray/radiology staff in Hospital A was linked to hospital employees indicating they reported to the 

supervisor of x-ray/radiology in Hospital A; patient satisfaction information regarding x-

ray/radiology staff in Hospital B was linked to hospital employees indicating they reported to the 

supervisor of x-ray/radiology in Hospital B, and so on.

The approach just described was followed for the following work areas:  x-ray/radiology, 

physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, nurses, emergency 

admissions, general admissions, billing, environmental services (i.e., those responsible for 

hospital and room cleanliness) and dietary services (i.e., food service).  The result of this process 

was a patient satisfaction matrix  11  times its original size, since the original matrix was 

replicated once for each work group for which patient data could be matched with employee 

data.  Next, this large patient satisfaction data matrix was aggregated by the previously described 

linkage variable, created specifically for matching patient and employee data.  This resulted in a 

patient satisfaction data matrix 21  (a location variable, the linkage variable and  19 patient 

satisfaction variables) x 66 in size.  The linkage process resulted in 66 distinct groups of data for 

which employee and patient attitudes could be matched.

Given that the type of service interaction was a key variable in the current study, 

information regarding job code and service code needed to be folded in.  Service code refers to 

the classifying of similar healthcare positions, discussed earlier.  As with the various job codes, 

service code is simply a nominal variable which was created to group together those work groups 

having similar interactions with patients.

The employee satisfaction data were aggregated by the job code(s) reporting to a 

particular supervisor within a particular hospital.  For instance, the supervisor of a nursing unit 

may have had business office and clerical personnel (i.e., job code 23), registered nurses (i.e., job 

code 24), technicians (i.e., job code 26) and service workers (i.e., job code 27) all reporting to her 

or him.  Data for each job code were aggregated and identified as all reporting to the same

supervisor.  Continuing with the example, data obtained from patients discharged from this 

nursing unit were replicated and linked separately to each of the aggregated job code groups.  In 

this case then, four work group units would have been available for analysis, all with the same 

service code of 1, since it is a nursing work group.  This resulted in 248 work groups available 

for analysis.  Job code by service code breakouts can be seen in Table 2.

The end result of the linkage process was a data matrix consisting of employee 

satisfaction variables and patient satisfaction variables, with a job code and service code for each 

case of data.  Thus, it was possible to obtain employee by patient correlation matrices for the 

same job code across different department types as well as matrices for similar work groups 

(departments) across different job codes.

It is important to note that all of the patient satisfaction variables outlined in Table 6 

(discussed later) were computed for each separate replication of the patient data (i.e., the data set 

created for the purpose of linking patient satisfaction with x-ray/radiology with employees 

working in x-ray/radiology, etc.).  Thus, for example, it was possible examine relationships 

between nurses’ satisfaction with different facets of the work environment with patients’ 

satisfaction with the x-ray/radiology staff.  Although there was no a-priori reason to suspect 

relationships would exist, this turned out to be a useful approach as it resembled a multi- 

trait/multi-methods approach for establishing construct validity.  In other words, it provided a 

useful approach for testing whether or not correlations were present where both expected and 

unexpected.

In forming the employee-patient links, there were a few special considerations needing to 

be taken into account.  In some instances, there was more than one supervisor of a hospital unit 

for which patient data were available.  In these situations, patient data were assigned to each 

supervisor, as opposed to aggregating employee data across multiple supervisors.  Similarly, in a 

few instances a patient satisfaction variable could refer to more than one hospital work group 

(e.g., different areas of specialty under the general category of x-ray/radiology); in these cases, 

patient data were replicated and assigned to each distinct work group.  This approach was taken 

primarily in an effort to prevent further reduction in work group n-size.  In other instances, a 

single person supervised more than one department for which patient data were available.  In 

these situations, patient data from the distinct hospital departments were aggregated and linked 

with the single grouping of employee data.  The overall objective was to link the patient 

satisfaction data with the employee groups which served those patients.  Handling these

situations in manner described was the best way o f accomplishing this objective while still 

ensuring large enough group sizes were available for analysis after aggregation.

Given the manner in which job code information was collected, it was prudent to be 

concerned about the homogeneity o f employee groups reporting to a particular supervisor.  For 

instance, the Other Professionals job category covered such disparate positions as respiratory 

therapist and programmer.  Concerns about group heterogeneity arose when multiple respondents 

all reported to the same supervisor and selected the same job code.  For example, if patients 

indicated their satisfaction with the respiratory therapy staff, the data could be inappropriately 

linked with employees other than the respiratory therapy staff.  This conceivably could have been 

the case had their been programmers or systems analysts (who used the same Other Professionals 

job code as did respiratory therapists) reporting to the supervisor of a respiratory therapy 

department.  Human resource professionals at each participating hospital in the client healthcare 

organization unanimously agreed that reasonable inferences could be made about the 

composition of employee groups based on their job code and to whom they reported.

One final note is warranted about aggregating the employee data.  As mentioned, data 

from all respondents using the same job code and reporting to the same supervisor were 

aggregated.  The number of employee survey respondents using the same job code and reporting 

to the same supervisor ranged from  1  to 31.  Once again, to prevent further loss in groups of data 

available for analysis, groups with a size of 1 were retained and used as though the values were 

obtained by aggregating several employees’  responses.

Data Aggregation

Since data analyses were performed at the work unit level, it is necessary to review the 

methodological issues associated with data aggregation.  In relating employee attitude variables

with customer satisfaction, or other organizational performance variables, one of the most 

important methodological questions pertains to choosing an appropriate unit of analysis.  In cases 

where it is not possible or feasible to collect data pertaining to groups or organizational level 

variables, researchers often rely on aggregates of information collected at the individual level to 

serve as surrogates of these plural variables.  A decision must be made, however, about which 

unit of analysis best addresses the research question (see Schneider and Bowen,  1985 for an 

example).  Moreover, if aggregation is deemed appropriate, justification should be provided for 

the decision.  In  1980, when Schneider et al. authored their seminal article linking employee and 

customer perceptions of service climate, literature regarding the statistical justification for 

aggregation was not well developed.  Despite this state of affairs, they recognized the importance 

of the issue and provided a rationale for aggregation rooted in the theory of shared perceptions 

(Drexler,  1977; Holland,  1976).

The appropriateness of the decision to aggregate has important implications for data 

interpretation.  On one hand, inappropriately aggregating data can lead to drawing inaccurate 

conclusions (James,  1982), while on the other hand, analyzing data at a different level of analysis 

can illuminate important relationships.  For instance, despite the seemingly intuitive relationship 

between satisfaction and productivity, researchers have been unable to marshal significant 

evidence for this connection at the individual level of analysis (Iaffaldano & Muchinsky,  1985). 

Staw (1986) opined that “the pursuit of the happy/productive worker has seemed a worthwhile 

though difficult endeavor, one that might be achieved if we greatly increase our knowledge of 

work attitudes and behavior.”  Ostroff s  1992 study played an important role in increasing what 

is known about the level of analysis in the relationship between attitude and performance 

variables.  She found an increase in the magnitude of the correlations between satisfaction and

performance when the relationship was explored at the organizational level.  Iaffaldano and 

Muchinsky estimated the individual-level correlation between satisfaction and productivity to be 

.17, while at the organizational level of analysis, Ostroff (1992) found satisfaction-performance 

correlations between .11  and .54 with an average correlation of .28.  Ostroff (1992) offers several 

explanations for why satisfaction-performance relationships have not been robust at the 

individual level, including criterion deficiency in performance variables, constraints on 

performance beyond an employee’s control and individual differences in skills, abilities, 

motivation or personality.  She also notes as possible explanations the fact that attenuated 

performance is but one of several possible responses to dissatisfaction and that individual level 

performance outcomes fail to embody the interactions and task interdependencies which could 

result in increased performance at a more global level of the organization.

While there are potential benefits to analyzing data at different levels of analysis, whether 

or not data should be aggregated from a statistical viewpoint is an issue to consider which has 

implications for the validity of conclusions drawn.  Progress has been made in terms of 

statistically gauging the appropriateness of aggregating data collected at the individual level. 

Arguments for aggregating individual level attitudinal data are based on the idea that people in 

the same or similar settings should have similar perceptions of their environment.  This view is 

epitomized by the attraction-selection-attrition theoretical framework (Schneider,  1987; 

Schneider, Goldstein & Smith,  1995), which hypothesizes that organizations become more 

homogenous over time, thereby making it reasonable to assume that an organization’s members 

should perceive their environment in a similar fashion (Schneider & Bowen,  1985).  Given this 

conceptual underpinning, it follows that one should be able to obtain a measure of within group 

interrater agreement to assess the similarity in individual responses on perceptual measures.

James, Demaree and Wolf (1984,1993) proposed rwg as one such measure of agreement among 

individuals’ rating o f a single target (e.g., a survey item).  rwg may also be conceptualized as a 

measure of rater interchangeability.  James (1982) suggests using two derivations of the 

intraclass correlation to assist in deciding the appropriateness of aggregating data.  Schmit and 

Allscheid (1995) described ICC(l) as an estimate of the proportion o f variance in individuals’ 

responses accounted for by differences in offices o f a security systems organization.  ICC(2) may 

be interpreted as an estimate of the reliability of means at the level of analysis under study 

(James,  1982).

As noted by James (1982) and Ostroff (1993), generalizing results obtained at one level 

of analysis to other levels of analysis can lead to erroneous conclusions about the data.  As an 

examnle of this aggregation bias, James cites the work of Drexler (1977).  In Drexler’s climate 

study of multiple organizations, the author reported the percentage of variance in climate 

perceptions attributable to the organization.  In reaching his conclusions, Drexler aggregated data 

collected at the individual level to the workgroup level and subsequently performed analyses on 

this group level variable.  As James (1982) notes about this study, “...the term aggregation bias 

is used in this context to refer to a fallacy of the wrong level, where estimates of perceptual 

agreement based on aggregates (means) are erroneously interpreted as applying to estimates of 

agreement based on individuals (p. 225).”  James goes on to conclude that performing the 

analysis in this manner in this particular case resulted in an inflated estimate of the relationship 

which existed at the individual level.  Ostroff s work (e.g., Ostroff,  1993) has also been useful 

for illuminating the relationships between individual-level and organizational-level correlations 

and the circumstances under which they are similar or different.

Despite the importance of aggregation-related issues, it is a subject which has received 

mixed attention in the literature.  Statistical justification (i.e., rwg, ICC(l) or ICC(2)) for 

aggregation has not typically been presented at all in publications with a more applied orientation 

(e.g., Atkins et al., 1996; Paradise-Tomow,  1991; Ulrich et al.,  1991).  Indeed, justification for 

aggregation in these reports has been little more than a statement that the chosen unit of analysis 

made conceptual sense.  Publications with a greater research emphasis have reported data in 

argument for aggregation.  For instance, Schmit and Allscheid (1995) reported ICC(l) and 

ICC(2) and Johnson (1996) and Ryan et al. (1996) reported rlvg and ICC(2).

Exploratory Analyses

Employee Satisfaction Survey

Of the 6,000 employee surveys made available to participants, 4,016 were returned.

Exact information about the number of employees working in the healthcare system was not 

available.  Using the number of surveys printed as a proxy for the total number of employees, the 

response rate on the employee survey was approximately 67%.  The actual response rate may 

have been a bit higher, given that extra copies of the survey are typically printed as a 

precautionary measure.

Table 3 displays the number of employee survey respondents broken out by location and 

job type.  Of the 4,106 surveys returned 3,580 contained responses for both location and job type. 

Patient satisfaction data were available only from four hospitals (Hospitals V, C, T and W in 

Table 3), thus employee data from the other locations were not used in addressing the research 

questions.  Patient data were available for the two largest and two smallest hospitals in the 

system.  At commencement of this study, patient data for Hospital R were just starting to be 

collected and were therefore unavailable for analysis.  The Primary Care group represents 

multiple offices scattered around the region with relatively few individuals at each of these 

smaller locations.  Patient data were not collected for this group and would not have been 

included if available, given that all other patient data stemmed from inpatient visits (i.e., 

involved a stay in a hospital); visits to primary care outlets can be characterized as “office visits.” 

For the most part, the Regional Staff group was not directly involved in the delivery of patient 

care, and consequently had no corresponding patient satisfaction data.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to ascertain the underlying 

factor structure of the employee data.  One-half of the total data set, or 2,018 cases of the 

employee data were randomly selected and submitted to an exploratory factor analysis with 

maximum likelihood extraction, direct oblimin rotation and pairwise deletion of cases. 

MacCallum (1998) recently suggested this factor analytic approach is often more appropriate 

than the traditionally used principal components analysis with varimax rotation.  The maximum 

likelihood / direct oblimin approach does not unrealistically assume underlying factors are 

orthogonal and, according to MacCallum, provides greater accountability for the correlations 

among measured variables.

The survey was originally rationally constructed and conceived of as measuring  13 

distinct facets of the work environment.  As Gorsuch (1983) noted, however, factor analysis 

often yields a more parsimonious set of variables with which to work than that afforded through 

rational means.  Results of the factor analysis suggested an eight-factor solution was appropriate, 

accounting for approximately 48% of the variance. Labels were then derived which best seemed

to capture the essence of each variable cluster; the labels given were:  Administration (16 items), 

Supervisor (9 items), Co-Workers (6 items), Professional Orientation or Ethic (7 items), Feeling 

Informed (2 items), Recognition (3 items), Industry Understanding (5  items) and Pride / 

Satisfaction (3 items).

A principal components analysis with varimax rotation was also conducted on the same 

sample of data.  Overall, item clusters were the same or largely similar.  Subsequent analyses 

were based on the factor structure obtained with maximum likelihood extraction and direct 

oblimin rotation, since the simple structure associated with this technique was slightly more 

interpretable.

Items appearing under each factor and their corresponding factor loadings appear in Table 

4.  For the most part the labels are self-explanatory, but a few notes are warranted.  Most items 

loading on the Administration factor contained the word “administration” or “organization” and 

referenced policies, practices or the organization in general terms.  The item cluster labeled 

Professional Orientation or Ethic at first glance appears to be comprised of disparate concepts, 

but upon closer examination reveals a theme relating to respondents’ understanding that their 

jobs involve the provision of an important professional service (i.e., the delivery of healthcare). 

The items in the Industry Understanding  factor pertain to an understanding of why the client 

healthcare organization was formed and to whether or not employees feel they are 

knowledgeable about changes in the healthcare industry and the implications of those changes 

for their jobs.  Seven of the 58 employee survey items (6,  11,  12,  15, 24, 32 and 52) did not 

register factor loadings of at least .30 and thus were not used in subsequent analyses, with one 

exception (described later).

Random  sam ple o f  2.008  cases out o f 4 .0 16 subm itted.

Using the hold-out sample of employee survey data (i.e., the remaining 2008 cases), the 

factor structure outlined in Table 4 was submitted to a confirmatory factor analysis using 

LISREL 8.20 (Joreskog & Sorbom,  1998) to test its stability.  The covariance matrix of the 51 

indicator variables was used to obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the 

measurement model.  As is often the case with large sample sizes and structural equation 

modeling analyses, a significant chi-square was obtained (chi-square= 15,346.16; df=l 196;

p<.001).

In situations such as this, other fit indices are more appropriate.  Browne and Cudeck 

(1993) suggest a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) lower than .05 indicates 

the data fit the model well and an RMSEA between .05 and .08 indicates a reasonable fit.  In the

current analysis, an RMSEA o f .081 was obtained.  Browne and Cudeck (1993) also suggest 

looking at the 90% confidence interval for the RMSEA point estimate; if the lower bound is 

above .05, the model should be rejected.  The confidence interval could not be obtained in the 

current analysis due to the small chi-square p-value.

Other indices which shed light on model fit in the current analysis include the Goodness 

of Fit Index (GFI; .75), the Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI; .73), the Root Mean Square 

Residual (RMR; .072), the Normed Fit Index (NFI; .81) and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI;

.83).  All of these indices improved slightly when looking at the total sample (i.e., 2008 cases 

each from the exploratory and confirmatory samples), with the RMSEA going down to .078.

Taking the large sample size into account and because reasonable RMR and RMSEA 

values were obtained, the measurement model was used for subsequent analyses.  Scale means 

were computed for the eight employee satisfaction dimensions identified via factor analyses, 

with variables receiving unit weights.  Scale scores for two other variables were also computed 

for subsequent analyses.  First, all 51  items loading on the eight employee variables were 

combined to form an overall employee satisfaction variable.

Second, three survey items were combined to form a customer orientation variable.

Based on a review of the survey items before conducting the exploratory factor analysis, it was 

anticipated a customer orientation factor would emerge, most likely consisting of the following 

items:  item  1) “I believe my department is customer focused", item 21) “The confidentiality of 

information about patients and their families is respected in my department” and item 24) “This 

organization cares about the well-being of its patients/clients.”  Items  1  and 21  loaded on the 

previously described Professional Orientation factor.  Item 24 also loaded on this factor, but 

carried a loading less than .30.  Given that the research questions in the current study revolve

around linking employee and patient attitudes, it was appropriate to somehow tap into 

employees’ perceptions of their own customer orientation, and by extension, each work group’s 

perceived customer orientation.  Toward this end, items  1  and 21, which loaded on the 

Professional Orientation or Ethic scale, were also used in conjunction with item 24 to form a 

Customer Orientation scale.

A total of 10 employee satisfaction variables were used in subsequent analyses (Table 8 

shows the scale reliabilities for these variables on the diagonal).  One of the original  13 rationally 

derived scales, entitled Pay and Benefits, contained two items.  One was an external equity item 

regarding pay while the other was a similarly phrased item regarding benefits.  Neither of these 

items loaded on any of the eight factors identified as part of the exploratory factor analysis, nor 

was there mutual association strong enough to be empirically considered a separate factor.  Prior 

research has not shown compelling evidence to suggest these are important linkage variables, 

thus they were eliminated from further analyses.

Patient Satisfaction Survey

The same factor analytic approach taken with the employee satisfaction data was 

attempted with the patient satisfaction data.  Only items responded to with a Strongly Disagree to 

Strongly Agree scale were retained for the factor analysis since these were items which dealt 

directly with facets of patient satisfaction.  For instance, items asking about a patient’s perceived 

state of health were excluded (specifically, items 3, 34, 35 and 43-48 were excluded).  Item 9 

(“The food was served at the right temperature”) was also excluded from the analysis because 

data for this item were inadvertently excluded from the data set received by the author.  Out of 

4,207 total cases of data 2,103 were randomly selected for an exploratory factor analysis with 

maximum likelihood estimation, direct oblimin rotation and pairwise deletion of cases.  The

analysis could not proceed, however, since the covariance matrix was not positive definite. 

Changing to listwise deletion of cases to address the problem was not feasible because the size of 

the data set would have been so drastically reduced in size that further analyses would not have 

been possible.

In an attempt to shed light on the factor structure of the patient satisfaction data, all 4,207 

cases were submitted.  Results indicated a seven factor solution might be appropriate, but after 

25 iterations no local minimum could be found with maximum likelihood extraction.  Raising the 

threshold to 50 iterations did not help matters.  Next, the 4,207 cases were submitted to a 

principal components analysis with varimax rotation.  Results still suggested a seven factor 

solution, accounting for about 68% of the variance.  Table 5 displays the results of this 

exploratory factor analysis.

In general, items pertaining to a particular topic area appeared to cluster together, but 

many items displayed loadings greater than .30 on more than one factor.  The survey asked 

respondents about their overall satisfaction with several distinct workgroups, other than nurses 

and doctors.  These groups were the physical therapy staff, speech therapy staff, occupational 

therapy staff, respiratory therapy staff, x-ray/radiology staff and the laboratory staff.  These six 

items (i.e., one overall satisfaction item pertaining to each workgroup) all clustered together to 

form their own factor, which is not too surprising given their similarity in content and their 

contiguous positioning in the questionnaire.

Given the fact the primary purpose of the current study was to link patients’ attitudes 

about different hospital service providers with the attitudes of employees performing those 

services, and because of the tenuous results of the factor analysis, a decision was made to derive 

patient satisfaction scale scores based on a rational grouping of survey items.  Unfortunately, for 

six of the workgroups (i.e., physical therapy staff, speech therapy staff, occupational therapy 

staff, respiratory therapy staff, x-ray/radiology staff and laboratory staff) only a single overall

satisfaction item was available.  Only single items were also available for the variables of food 

(since data for one variable was inadvertently omitted) and control of pain.

The patient satisfaction variables used in subsequent analyses, and the items comprising 

these variables are listed in Table 6.  Since the factor analysis of the patient satisfaction data 

indicated the first six items statistically, if not rationally, clustered together, an overall “Therapy” 

variable was created, combining overall satisfaction with the six distinct workgroups.  An 

explanation of Emergency Admissions and General Admissions is also warranted; only one of 

these scale scores was computed for each patient, depending on how the patient was admitted. 

Employee satisfaction data was not collected from doctors, but patients’ satisfaction with doctors 

was left in for exploratory purposes.  Finally, an overall patient satisfaction variable was 

computed as a composite o f all of the other patient satisfaction items used in subsequent 

analyses.

There were 4,207 cases of patient satisfaction data available for analysis.  As mentioned, 

patient data were only available for four out of the five hospitals for which employee data were 

collected.  Since the nature of the inpatient visit differs by patient, not all of the patient 

satisfaction variables outlined in Table 6 could be computed for each patient.  Table 7 shows 

how many individual cases of data were available for each patient variable broken down by 

hospital.

Employee Satisfaction Data 

ICC(l) and ICC(2) were the intraclass correlation coefficients used to examine the 

appropriateness of aggregating the employee data to the level of work group or department 

supervisor.  ICC(1) is the estimated proportion of variance in employees’ responses accounted 

for by differences in the department in which an employee works (i.e., operationalized here as 

the supervisor to whom an employee reports).  Schmit and Allscheid (1995) describe ICC(2) as

an estimate of the reliability at the group level, or the correlation between the mean and the mean 

of another hypothetical group drawn from the same population.

The aggregation statistics reported below were computed using only data from the four 

hospitals under study, although a review of these data for all seven locations for which employee 

data were collected yielded very similar results.  ICC(l) values ranged from .23 to .33 while 

ICC(2) values ranged from .53 to .73.  ICC(l) and ICC(2) values, respectively, for each 

employee dimension are as follows:  administration (ADMIN; .29, .65), supervisor (SUPER; .31, 

.69), co-workers (COWRK;  .33, .73), profession orientation or ethic (ETHIC; .26, .62), feeling 

informed (INFO;  .26, .61), recognition (RECOG; .26, .58), understanding o f the industry 

(INDUS, .23, .53), overall pride and satisfaction with the organization (SATIS; .25, .57), 

composite overall satisfaction variable (OVRAL; .31, .70) and customer orientation (CUST; .26, 

.60).  ICC(1) values were all above the mean value o f . 12 typically found, as reported by James 

(1982).  However, most of the ICC(2) values were below the .70 threshold used by some 

researchers (e.g., Schmit & Allscheid).  In general, the aggregation statistics suggested the work 

group was the appropriate level of analysis for the employee data.  By contrast, other aggregation 

statistics suggested the hospital, or location level of analysis may not be appropriate; ICC(l) 

values ranged from 0 to .02, indicating practically no variance in the employee attitude data was 

accounted for by location.  ICC(2) values became more sporadic and ranged from .56 to .95.

Table 8 shows the means, standard deviations, inter-correlations, and reliabilities of the 

employee satisfaction dimensions.  The Professional Orientation or Ethic dimension had the 

highest overall mean, probably because the items comprising the scale were somewhat 

susceptible to a positive response bias.  Satisfaction with Administration was lowest, which is 

not unusual in employee satisfaction research where management appears to take the brunt of

employees’ criticism.  The employee satisfaction dimensions were highly inter-correlated, with 

all variable combinations significant at p<.01  (two-tailed).  Overall, the reliabilities were at 

acceptable levels for research purposes (Nunnally & Bernstein,  1994), with the exception of the 

additional Customer Orientation variable (.63).  Reliability analyses indicated the homogeneity 

of none of the scales would be improved by eliminating an additional variable.

Table 9 displays the means and standard deviations for the employee satisfaction 

variables broken out by each hospital for which patient satisfaction data were available.  Table  10 

shows the results of a one-way ANOVA, testing for significant differences in the group means of 

employee satisfaction variables across hospitals.  Differences were found for Administration, 

Professional Orientation or Ethic, Recognition, Industry Understanding, Pride/Satisfaction, the 

Overall Composite variable and the additional Customer Orientation Variable.  Approaching 

significance were the remaining variables (Supervisor, Co-Workers and Feeling Informed).

Table  11  outlines the results of post-hoc Tukey and Scheffe tests, showing homogenous 

subgroups, or specifically which group means were significantly different from others.  In all 

cases, the Scheffe test results, considered to be safer in reducing Type I error (Gravetter & 

Wallnau,  1988), mirror the Tukey test results.  Results, however, should be interpreted with a 

certain degree of caution given the drastically different n-sizes available for analysis.

Table  12 displays results of stepwise multiple regression analyses conducted to assess 

which employee satisfaction variables were related to overall organizational pride and 

satisfaction.  The analyses were conducted for all hospitals combined and for each hospital 

individually.  In general, results indicate employees’ satisfaction with administrative policies and 

procedures, professional orientation and understanding of the healthcare industry is predictive of 

overall organizational pride and satisfaction.  For Hospital T, Supervisor also emerged as being 

related to Pride/Satisfaction.

Patient Satisfaction Data 

Table  13 shows the means, standard deviations and inter-correlations for the patient 

satisfaction scales.  It also shows the reliabilities for scales comprised o f at last two items.  As 

with the employee satisfaction dimensions, patient satisfaction variables were highly inter- 

correlated, as all variable combinations were significant at p<.01.  A scale reliability could not be 

computed for the Overall Composite variable (i.e., the combination of all variables) due to an 

insufficient number of cases required for the listwise deletion of cases.  Also, the Signs variable 

(comprised of items  1  and 2) was not used in subsequent analyses for two reasons.  First, it was 

questionable whether any of the patient care positions involved in the current study had direct 

control over hospital signage and second, the scale reliability associated with this variable was 

demonstrably lower than that of other variables with at least two items.

2.  Scale reliabilities are on  the diagonal.  (N/A) on the diagonal indicates scale reliability could not be computed either bccuusc the patient satisfaction variable comprised only a single item or 
because listwise deletion o f cases resulted in too few cases to compute a reliability estimate.
3.  All correlations significant at p<.OI  (two-tailed).
4.  A correlation between Emergency and General Admissions could not be computed since cither one variable or the other was computed for each record.

Table 14 displays the means and standard deviations for the patient satisfaction variables 

broken out by hospital.  Table  15 shows the results of a one-way ANOVA, testing for significant 

differences in the group means of patient satisfaction variables across hospitals.  Differences 

were found for General Admissions, Room and Hospital Cleanliness and Food.  Approaching 

significance at an alpha-level of .05 were Home Care and Staff Satisfaction.

Table  16 outlines the results of post-hoc Tukey and Scheffe tests for the patient 

satisfaction data, showing homogenous subgroups, or specifically which group means were 

significantly different from others.  As with the employee data, Scheffe tests mirror results of the 

Tukey tests.  Again, however, results should be interpreted with a certain degree of caution given 

the different n-sizes available for analysis from each hospital.  In general, the data suggest that 

patients in the two smaller hospitals (T and W) were more satisfied than patients in the larger 

hospitals (V and C).  Although the differences were not great, it also appears that patients are 

most satisfied with Hospital W and least satisfied with Hospital V.

Table  17 displays results of stepwise multiple regression analyses to identify which 

patient satisfaction variables were related to Overall Satisfaction (not the Composite variable). 

The analyses were conducted for all hospitals combined and for each hospital individually.  In 

general, results indicate patients’  satisfaction with how well the staff worked together to 

coordinate care and satisfaction with nurses was related to overall patient satisfaction.  Variable 

entry and removal criteria (i.e., F-value) were relaxed (to .10 and .15, respectively, from .05 and 

. 10) for analysis with Hospital  W.  Results indicate that for Hospital W, patient satisfaction with 

the physical therapy staff is most predictive of overall patient satisfaction, however, this result is 

tenuous, given the relaxed entry and removal criteria.

Employee and Patient Satisfaction Data 

As mentioned earlier, structural equation modeling was not a viable data analytic 

technique due to the small number o f employee-patient work group links available for analysis. 

Instead, hypotheses were examined using multiple correlation matrices, facilitating a review of 

relationships between employee and patient attitudes as a function of both the type of job being 

performed as well as the service area in which the job is performed.

Tables 18-20 outline the correlations between employee and patient attitude variables 

across all work groups.  The differences between these tables pertain to data replication strategies 

and break-out procedures for the job code variable (each table is described more fully below). 

Tables 21  to 30, display the correlations between employee and patient variables broken out by 

different job codes (i.e., Tables 21-25) and service codes (i.e., Tables 26-30).

Table  18 displays the correlations between employee and patient variables for the 66 

original work groups for which both employee and patient data were available.  For these 66 

work groups, there was no replication of patient data in cases where more than one supervisor 

had responsibility for a particular work group for which patient data were available, or for cases 

where more than one work group was a reference point for a patient satisfaction variable.

Table  19 displays the same correlations, however additional work groups were created in 

instances where more than a single supervisor was associated with a particular work group, or in 

cases where more than a single work group was a potential point of reference for a patient 

satisfaction variable.  As outlined in the Forming the Work Unit Links Section, patient data were 

replicated in these instances and linked to the different employee work groups.

Hypothesis  la stated a relationship between overall employee and patient attitudes would 

be found.5  Tables  18 to 20 are most useful for addressing this hypothesis.  In general it appears 

that employee attitudes are related to patient attitudes across multiple work groups.  Looking at 

the global measure of patient satisfaction (i.e., patient SATIS) across facets of employee 

satisfaction in Tables  18,  19, and 20, relationships are small, but generally in the expected 

direction.  Across Tables  18,  19 and 20, correlations range from 0 to .182.  Employees’ attitudes 

regarding hospital administration (ADMIN), their professional orientation or ethic (ETHIC), 

whether or not they feel informed about organizational activities (INFO) and their overall pride

5  As a result of the correlational approach to addressing the hypotheses, the reader is reminded 
that Hypothesis  la, which predicted a positive relationship between employee and patient 
attitudes, might be better viewed as a research question to be addressed in general terms.  The 
reason for this is that using correlations between multiple employee variables and patient

and satisfaction with the organization (employee SATIS) were most related to global patient 

satisfaction.

Reviewing patients’ satisfaction with hospital staff (i.e., perceptions of how well the staff 

worked together to coordinate care and how well the staff communicated with family and 

friends) is also useful understanding general relationships between employee and patient 

attitudes.  Again, relationships were in the expected direction overall, but quite small.  Facets of 

the work environment most strongly related to staff satisfaction were administration (ADMIN), 

professional orientation or ethic (ETHIC), feeling informed about organizational activities 

(INFO) and industry understanding (INDUS).  Somewhat surprising is the lack of a relationship 

between employees’ satisfaction with their co-workers and patients’ staff satisfaction; one might 

have intuitively thought patients’ satisfaction with hospital staff might have been related to how 

well employees perceived they get along with co-workers.

Consistent patterns of correlations across Tables  18.  19 and 20 were also observed for 

patients’  satisfaction with food (FOOD), physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) 

and multiple facets of employee satisfaction.  Looking across these three correlation matrices, 

which are best suited for exploring an overall link between employee and patient attitudes, a 

scattering of other significant correlations can be observed.  However the ephemeral nature of 

most of the correlations as a function of how the data were combined (i.e., the data replication 

strategies already described for Tables  18,  19 and 20) suggests these relationships should be 

interpreted with caution.

variables to address the hypothesis, the phrasing of Hypothesis  1 a may be viewed as nebulous. 
The lack of specificity in phrasing raises the question of whether the hypothesis is falsifiable.

Tables 21  to 25 show correlation matrices associated with different job codes, while 

Tables 26 to 30 display correlation matrices associated with different service codes.  Correlation 

matrices are only shown for job and service codes with an n-size of 30 or more.  Looking at the 

job code by service code breakouts in Table 2, a group size of thirty appeared to be a good 

arbitrary point facilitating examination of the hypotheses (i.e., examining employee-customer 

attitude relationships across different service positions), while recognizing that some of the 

matrices had n-sizes too low for any meaningful inference.

A cursory review of the correlations across Tables 21  to 30 provides further evidence for 

a general relationship between employee and customer attitudes in a healthcare setting, but that 

this relationship might be different for different service roles.

Thus, enough evidence appears to be present to confirm support for Hypothesis  1 a; 

employee attitudes do appear to be related to patient attitudes across work groups in the four 

hospitals under study.

Hypothesis  1 b predicted the strongest relationship between employee and patient 

attitudes would be found between nurses and patients, followed by those positions involved in 

the delivery of patient care but that do not play as central a role as do nurses.  Finally, it was 

expected that relationships would be weakest for those service roles requiring interaction with 

patients but which do not deliver any patient care.

Complete support for Hypothesis  lb was not found, as evidenced by the lack of any 

relationship between nurses’ attitudes about their work environment and patients’  satisfaction 

with the nursing care they received.  However, some support was found for Hypothesis  1 b in that 

attitudes pertaining to several facets of the work environment were positively related to patient 

satisfaction for the Other Professional and Technician job groups (i.e., those delivering patient

care, but not playing as central a role as do nurses).  Additionally, practically no relationships 

were observed between the attitudes of billing office/clerical personnel and patients’ satisfaction 

with any facet of their inpatient visit (i.e., those having contact with patient, but not in the 

capacity of delivering an actual healthcare service).

Table 21  displays the correlations between patient attitudes and the attitudes of business 

office/clerical employees.  Table 2 indicates that most of these service employees worked in 

nursing departments, with only a few working in non healthcare provider departments (i.e., 

service code 5).  As can be seen in Table 21, the appears to be practically no relationship 

between patient and employee attitudes for this group of service personnel.

Table 22 is useful for understanding relationships between nurses’ attitudes about their 

work environment and patient satisfaction, since this is the correlation matrix which isolates the 

job code associated with nurses.  Once again, correlations are in the expected direction between 

patients’ global satisfaction (patient SATIS) and nurses’ satisfaction with multiple facets of the 

work environment, particularly with administration (ADMIN), feeling informed (INFO) and 

pride and satisfaction with the organization (employee SATIS).  Consistent positive relationships 

were also observed between patients’  satisfaction with the physical therapy staff (PT), the 

occupational therapy staff (OT) and food (FOOD) and all facets of the work environment. 

Perhaps most interesting, however, is the lack of any consistent pattern o f relationships between 

patients’ satisfaction with nursing care and nurses’ attitudes regarding their work environment. 

Indeed, a significant negative correlation (r = -.319, p<.05) was observed between patients’ 

satisfaction with nurses and nurses’ satisfaction with their supervision (SUPER).  Also 

noteworthy is the finding that nurses’ perceptions of how informed they felt regarding 

organizational activities was related to several facets of patient satisfaction other than global 

patient satisfaction (patient SATIS).  These variables include patients’ attitudes regarding the 

laboratory staff (LAB), the food (FOOD), pain management (PAIN) and the hospital staff 

(STAFF).

Additional insight regarding the relationship between nurses’ attitudes about the work 

environment and patient satisfaction can be gleaned from Table 26.  This table displays the 

correlations between patient satisfaction and the satisfaction of employees working in nursing 

units.  Job code by service code breakouts in Table 2 indicate that nursing units have the most 

variety in terms of workforce composition (i.e., almost all job codes are represented in nursing 

units).  For correlations between patients’ global satisfaction and satisfaction of employees 

working in nursing units, very similar relationships were observed as with only nurses (who 

almost exclusively worked in nursing units).  In addition, however, significant correlations were 

also observed between patients’ global satisfaction and employees’ professional orientation 

(ETHIC) and understanding of the healthcare industry (INDUS).  Again, consistent positive

relationships were observed between patients’ satisfaction with the food and employees’ attitudes 

regarding multiple facets o f the work environment.  A consistent pattern of positive, and in all 

cases but one, significant correlations was found between nursing unit employees’ professional 

orientation (ETHIC), industry understanding (INDUS) and pride/satisfaction in the organization 

(employee SATIS) and patients’ satisfaction with pain management (PAIN), staff satisfaction 

(STAFF) and global satisfaction (patient SATIS).  Conversations with hospital human resource 

personnel revealed nursing units are primarily responsible for managing patients’ pain and 

comfort; thus the limited emergence of relationships between patients’ satisfaction with this facet 

of care and nursing unit employees’ attitudes about specific facets of their work environment is 

not surprising.  Also, once again, a significant negative correlation was observed between 

patients’ satisfaction with nursing care and employees’ satisfaction (i.e., those working in 

nursing units) with their direct supervision.

Tables 23 and 24 show correlations between patient and employee attitudes for the Other 

Professionals job code and the Technicians job code (job codes 25  and 26, respectively).  These 

tables are useful for assessing the relationships between employee and patient attitudes for those 

work groups delivering patient care, but not playing as central a role as do nurses.  Based on 

Hypothesis  lb, it was anticipated that employee-patient relationships for these service positions 

would be less strong than for nurses.  Most employee survey respondents using the Other 

Professionals job code were from respiratory therapy, laboratory, x-ray/radiology, physical 

therapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy departments, however, a few were from nursing 

units.  With respect to the Other Professionals job group, a few noteworthy relationships were 

observable between patient and employee attitudes.  Patients’ satisfaction with the physical and 

occupational therapy staffs (PT and OT) was related in the expected direction with professionals’

(which, as a group, was comprised in part of physical and occupational therapy staffs) attitudes 

regarding their direct supervision (SUPER) and recognition for good performance (RECOG). 

Significant positive relationships were also observed between patients’ satisfaction with 

respiratory and speech therapy staffs and professionals’ (i.e., those using the Other Professionals 

job code) professional orientation or ethic (ETHIC).

A trend of positive and mostly significant relationships can be observed in Table 24 

between patients’ satisfaction with the x-ray /radiology, laboratory, physical therapy, 

occupational therapy, respiratory therapy and speech therapy staffs and technicians’ professional 

orientation or ethic (ETHIC) and understanding of the healthcare industry (INDUS). 

Understanding of the healthcare industry was also related to patients’  satisfaction with how well

their pain was managed.  As can be seen in Table 2, many technicians work in departments 

providing professional services (i.e., x-ray/radiology, laboratory, physical therapy, occupational 

therapy, respiratory therapy and speech therapy), but more actually work in nursing units.  Thus 

in drawing inferences about workers who do not play a central coordinating role in the delivery 

of healthcare, a more pure analysis would have been to isolate and analyze data for technicians 

not working in nursing units; unfortunately, however, n-sizes prohibited this.

It is unclear if the data in Table 25 are useful for addressing Hypothesis  lb (i.e., the 

prediction that relationships between employee and patient attitudes would be weakest for those 

service positions having contact with the patient, but not directly delivering a healthcare service) 

because about half of the service worker work groups are in nursing units, as can be seen in

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.

Table 2.  Nursing assistants, who have a more direct role in providing a healthcare service than 

do workers in environmental and dietary services, used the same job code as workers in 

environmental and dietary services.  On the other hand, the service rendered by service 

employees working in a nursing unit may be so low-end as to not be recognizable as a healthcare 

service.  Thus, it is unclear what role Table 25 plays in the interpretation process.

Table 27 displays the correlations between patient satisfaction and employees in Service 

Code 2 (i.e., different service positions working in respiratory therapy, laboratory or x- 

ray/radiology departments).  Table 28 combines this information with that for Service Code 3 

(i.e.,  individuals working in physical, occupational or speech therapy departments).  Service 

Codes 2 and 3  were combined to shed additional light on Hypothesis  lb (i.e., to increase the n-

size available for analysis o f work groups directly delivering healthcare services, but which were 

not nursing units).  As already discussed, these two service code areas were different enough to 

warrant separate classification, but they are similar in that these work areas are involved in the 

direct delivery of healthcare services.  Overall, the pattern of correlations is largely similar across 

Tables 27 and 28 and the combining of data did not yield an abrupt change in correlations.

Many of the relationships in Tables 27 and 28 are significantly negative and in the 

opposite direction from what was hypothesized.  For instance, in Table 28, employees’ 

professional orientation or ethic (ETHIC) is positively associated with patients’ satisfaction with 

the x-ray/radiology and respiratory therapy staffs, but negatively associated with their 

satisfaction with the laboratory, physical therapy and occupational therapy staffs.  Additionally, 

from Table 28 it can be seen that all significant correlations between patients’ satisfaction with 

the staff and global satisfaction are negatively related to employees’ attitudes regarding many 

facets of the work environment.

In Hypothesis  1 b it was predicted that relationships between employee and patient 

attitudes would be weakest for those service positions having contact with the patient, but not 

directly delivering a healthcare service.  Table 21  displays correlations between patient 

satisfaction variables and business office/clerical work groups (i.e., job code 23); Table 25 

displays this information for service workers (i.e., job code 27); Table 29 shows this information 

for service code 4 (i.e., those work groups or job codes in the areas of environmental and dietary 

services); Table 30 combines information from service code 5 (i.e., those work groups or job 

codes in the areas of general admissions and billing).  Table 30 was created for the same reason 

as was Table 28; to increase the n-size available for analysis.  Combining data was appropriate 

since departments for both service codes 4 and 5 were similar in that interaction occurred with

98

the patient, but not in the capacity of directly delivering a healthcare service (recall that service 

code 4 was assigned to environment and dietary service departments and service code 5 was 

assigned to general admissions and billing departments).

Judging from Table 23, it appears that business office/clerical employees’ perceptions of 

the work environment are unrelated to patient satisfaction, although some correlations between 

patients’  satisfaction with billing appear to be headed in the right direction.  Specifically, 

correlations were highest, though not significant, for employees’ attitudes regarding 

administration, their professional orientation, feeling informed and their understanding of the 

healthcare industry.  As mentioned, it is not clear how helpful Table 25 is in addressing 

Hypothesis  lb.

Tables 29 and 30 show that the customer orientation variable (CUST) created for the 

employee data appears to be related to patients’  satisfaction with general admissions (GEADM), 

room and hospital cleanliness (CLEAN) and food (FOOD), but not to billing (BILL).  As 

explained earlier, the customer orientation variable has some items in common with the 

professional orientation (ETHIC) variable.  Thus, it is not surprising to see correlations for these 

two variables followed the same general pattern, but reached significance more often for 

customer orientation (CUST).

Overall, it appears that Hypothesis  lb was not supported.  Indeed it was disconfirmed as 

soon as it was discovered that there was no apparent relationship between patients' satisfaction 

with their nursing care and nurses’ attitudes regarding their work environment.  Disconfirmation 

of Hypothesis  lb does not necessarily indicate that employee attitudes are not differentially 

related to patient attitudes as a function of service role; it does indicate, however, that these 

relationships did not emerge as expected.  For instance, nurses’ attitudes regarding

administration, feeling informed and pride and satisfaction with the organization were related to 

patients’ global satisfaction with their inpatient visit.  As discussed at length above, this was not

the case for other work groups.

Hypothesis 2 predicted that patients’ satisfaction with the nursing care they received 

would be most strongly related to nurses’ satisfaction with their co-workers, direct supervision 

and recognition for good performance.  It was also expected that to a lesser extent, nurses’ 

perceptions of feeling informed about organizational events, their understanding of the healthcare 

industry and their satisfaction with administrative policies and procedures would be related 

patients’ satisfaction.

For staff position in the areas of respiratory therapy, laboratory, x-ray/radiology, physical 

therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, the variables demonstrating the strongest 

relationship to patient satisfaction were expected to be feeling informed about organizational 

events, their understanding of the healthcare industry and their satisfaction with administrative 

policies and procedures.  Specific hypotheses about service positions not directly involved in the 

delivery of a healthcare service were not formulated.

Overall, no clear trends emerged to suggest support for this hypothesis.  The employee 

variables appearing to have the most relevance to patient satisfaction across all correlation 

matrices appear to be workers’ profession orientation or ethic (ETHIC) and their understanding 

of the healthcare industry.  To a lesser extent, employees’  satisfaction with administrative 

policies and procedures (ADMIN) and employees’ overall pride and satisfaction in the 

organization emerged as variables with some relevance to patient satisfaction.

CHAPTER IV 

Discussion

The current study was conducted in an attempt to examine the relationships between 

employee and customer attitudes across multiple job types, or service roles within a single 

service environment.  Much of the linkage research to date has examined a single service 

position across multiple locations of the same service environment (e.g., bank tellers across 

multiple bank branches, or store clerks across multiple retail outlets).  This original line of 

inquiry was useful for establishing evidence that employees and customers do share similar 

perceptions o f service quality and that employee attitudes about the work environment are related 

to customer satisfaction.  However, little research has been geared toward understanding if these 

relationships hold up across the different types of service workers with which customers interact 

in the course of a more complex service encounter.

A limited amount of prior research was suggestive of the notion that the type of service 

interaction is a variable worth examining.  For instance, data obtained by Ryan et al. (1996) 

raised the possibility that the direction of causality could flow from customers to employees as a 

function of the type of service interaction.  Specifically, their data suggested the possibility of 

negative affectivity flowing from customers with credit problems to the employees servicing 

those customers.  Additionally, Brown and Mitchell (1993) found support for differential 

employee-customer attitude relationships across two different service positions in a bank setting. 

Again, however, the service positions under analysis can be characterized as front-line.  Thus, 

another defining characteristic of prior linkage research is that the service interactions under 

study have been largely short-lived, or transitory in nature and have been relatively 

uncomplicated.

104

The purpose of the current study was to try to advance the state of the linkage research by 

exploring the role of the type of service interaction on the relationship between employee and 

customer attitudes.  As a result of this focus, the current study differs from prior linkage research 

in at least three important ways.  First, the type of service being rendered (i.e., the delivery of 

healthcare services) was considerably more complex than in the vast majority of prior research 

efforts and particularly salient to the service recipient.  Second, as a direct function of the service 

complexity, service interactions were on-going.  In other words, individuals admitted to a 

hospital for an inpatient stay become part of the service environment and obviously do not leave 

the service environment after completing a particular transaction.  Third, as already mentioned, 

the current study examined multiple service roles in the context of a single service environment, 

as opposed to the same service role across many replications of the service context.

Exploring the role of the type of service interaction on the relationship between employee 

and customer attitudes in a single service environment is important because it can shed light on 

questions previously unaddressed.  For instance, it was unclear if the employee-customer attitude 

relationships found in the past would be observed in more complex service positions, and if so, if 

they would be as strong (vis-a-vis Schneider et. al.,  1980; Schneider & Bowen,  1985).  It was 

also unclear if customers can distinguish among the multiple service positions with which they 

interact over an extended period of time, or if they generalize their global satisfaction across 

service positions.  Additionally, it was unclear if different facets of employee satisfaction would 

be related to customer satisfaction as a function of the type of service role being performed (vis- 

a-vis Brown & Mitchell,  1993).

Shedding light on these issues is not only beneficial for theory building purposes, but also 

for yielding information with which to guide management’s actions.  For instance understanding,

105

which facets of work environment are most closely related to customer satisfaction as a function 

o f service position could enable management to differentially focus its efforts.  Just as marketers 

aim efforts at specific demographic groups, human resource professionals and management 

teams could direct organization development efforts in a more focused fashion.

In the present study, employee attitude data collected from individuals performing a 

variety of roles in a hospital setting were linked with attitude data from patients with whom the 

employees interacted during the course of an inpatient hospital visit.  Difficulties in establishing 

employee-patient links in the present analysis were illustrative of the challenges researchers can 

expect to face when attempting to conduct linkage analyses in the context of more complex 

service interactions and in situations where customers have interactions with numerous service 

personnel over an extended amount of time (i.e., days, as opposed to minutes for a typical 

banking transaction).

General Conclusions

Despite the difficulties in establishing employee-patient links, there does appear to be 

some evidence suggesting that employees’ attitudes about their work environment are related to 

patients’  attitudes about the service they received during their inpatient visit.  This is consistent 

with much of the prior linkage research which has already established this type of finding (e.g., 

Schneider et al.,  1980; Schneider & Bowen,  1985).  In this study, a trend of small, but positive 

correlations was observed across all work groups (i.e., across all work groups combined) 

between employees’  satisfaction with several facets of the work environment and patients’ global 

satisfaction with their inpatient visit.  The employee variables having the strongest relationship 

with overall patient satisfaction revolved around administrative practices, professional

106

orientation, feeling informed abut organizational activities and overall pride and satisfaction with 

the organization.

More pertinent to the hypotheses of this particular study, however, is the issue of whether 

the type of service being performed has an effect on the relationship between employee and 

customer attitudes in a healthcare setting.  Addressing this question would have been made easier 

in the current study had all cells in Table 2 (job code by service code breakouts) had adequate 

representation.  Thus, for example, similarities and differences could have been assessed for 

technicians working in nursing units (i.e., service code  1) versus those working in respiratory, 

laboratory or x-ray/radiology departments (i.e., service code 2).  Work group n-sizes prohibited 

these analyses, however.  Instead, analyses were conducted for all groups of technicians, 

regardless of the type of department in which they worked (i.e., analyzing a job code across 

multiple service codes).  Conversely, analyses could also only be performed across job codes 

within a particular department type (i.e., analyzing nurses, other professionals, technicians and 

service workers within nursing units, or service code  1).

Results of this study provide at least preliminary evidence that the type of service 

interaction has an effect on the relationship between employee and customer attitudes in a 

healthcare setting.  As mentioned earlier, it was not possible to gain meaningful insight into all 

job codes for which employee data were collected, since there were not enough aggregated work 

groups to link with corresponding patient satisfaction data.  Tables 21-25 display the correlations 

between patient attitudes and groups of employees using job codes 23 (business office/clerical),

24 (RN) 25 (other professionals), 26 (technicians) and 27 (service workers). Insight regarding 

employee-customer attitude relationships can be gained when these tables are examined for 

general patterns or trends.

107

There was little relationship between patients’ attitudes and the attitudes of business 

office/clerical personnel (Table 21).  The relationship between this group’s industry 

understanding and patients’ global satisfaction did reach significance (p<.05), however.  Looking 

at Table 2, it can be seen that the vast majority of these service positions were in nursing units. 

Thus, the dearth of correlations makes sense given that business office/clerical personnel have 

less contact with patients when working in nursing units as, opposed to in the billing or 

admissions areas where primary job responsibilities are more likely to involve direct 

communication with the customer.

Nurses’ attitudes regarding all facets of their work environment were positively related to 

patients’ global satisfaction with the hospital and their inpatient stay.  Specifically, correlations 

for nurses’ attitudes regarding administration, feeling informed and overall pride and satisfaction 

in their organization were significantly related to the global patient satisfaction variable (p<.05). 

These findings are consistent with the fact that in analyses involving only patient data, patients’ 

satisfaction with nurses emerged as a stable predictor of global patient satisfaction across 

hospitals.

With respect to patients’ attitudes regarding their nursing care and nurses’  attitudes 

regarding their work environment, practically no significant relationships can be observed in 

Table 22.  The one exception was a negative correlation between patients’ nursing satisfaction 

and nurses’ attitudes regarding direct supervision (-.319, p<.05).  A non-significant negative 

relationship was also observed for nurses’ attitudes about their co-workers.  Interestingly, Table 

22 shows a pattern of positive, and mostly significant, correlations between patients’  satisfaction 

with the x-ray/radiology, laboratory, physical therapy and occupational therapy staffs and nurses’ 

satisfaction with multiple facets of the work environment.  It seems more plausible to have

108

expected a relationship between patients’ satisfaction with nursing care and nurses’ attitudes 

about the work environment.  These correlations may be spurious, however, given the data 

aggregation/replication strategy employed and the relatively small number of patients rendering 

an opinion about these work groups, particularly for the areas of physical and occupational 

therapy (as can be seen in Table 7).

Personnel designating themselves as an “other professional” (i.e., job code 25), worked 

mostly in nursing units (i.e., service code 1) or in respiratory therapy, laboratory or x- 

ray/radiology departments (i.e., service code 2).  Since the patient satisfaction questionnaire 

referenced the x-ray/radiology staff, the laboratory staff, etc., it makes more sense to reference 

Tables 27 and 28 to shed light on relationships between patient attitudes and non-nursing 

deliverers of healthcare services.  Table 27 combines data for the similar service positions of 

respiratory therapy, laboratory and x-ray/radiology (see Classifying the Healthcare Positions for 

more information) and looks at employee data across job codes for relationships with patient 

satisfaction (note that this corresponds to service code 2 in Table 2).  Looking at the data from 

this vantage point shows a consistent pattern of negative relationships between patients’ global 

satisfaction and employees’ attitudes about the work environment, with employees’ attitudes 

about co-workers significant at the .05 level and employees’ professional orientation significant 

at the .01  level.  Employees’ attitudes about their work environment across the work areas of 

respiratory therapy, laboratory or x-ray/radiology generally demonstrated positive relationships 

with patients’ satisfaction with the x-ray/radiology staff and the respiratory therapy staff, but 

negative relationships with the laboratory staff.

Table 28 combines service codes 2 and 3 and looks at the relationship between patient 

satisfaction and employee attitudes across job codes in all non-nursing providers of healthcare

services (i.e., those working in respiratory therapy, laboratory, x-ray/radiology, physical therapy, 

occupational therapy and speech therapy).  There were not enough work groups for analysis 

within service code 3 (i.e., physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy), but since 

this service code is similar to service code 2 (i.e., respiratory therapy, laboratory, x- 

ray/radiology) in that both are non-nursing direct providers of a healthcare service, they were 

combined for exploratory purposes.  What is most noteworthy about Table 28 is the pattern of 

relationships between employees’ professional orientation and patients’ satisfaction with over 

half o f the patient variables.  Again, some of these relationships were negative instead of 

positive, as expected.

Table 24 displays the correlations between patients’ satisfaction and technicians’ attitudes 

about the work environment.  Table 2 indicates that almost all groups of technicians work in 

either nursing units (i.e., service code  1) or in respiratory therapy, laboratory or x-ray/radiology 

departments (i.e., service code 2).  Technicians’ attitudes about the work environment were not 

related to patients’ global satisfaction with their inpatient visit.  However, these employees’ 

professional orientation and understanding of the healthcare industry were positively related to 

patients’ satisfaction with staffs in respiratory therapy, x-ray/radiology, laboratory, physical 

therapy and occupational therapy.  Relationships were small, or nonexistent for speech therapy 

and nursing care.  Again, however, some correlations were found where they were not expected; 

employees’ attitudes from one work group were related to patients’ attitudes about another group 

(i.e., professional orientation and understanding of the healthcare industry for this group of 

employees was related to patients’ satisfaction with the physical and occupational therapy staffs).

Table 2 indicates service workers worked predominantly in nursing units and in 

environmental or dietary service areas.  For this reason, it is more useful to review Tables 29 and

30 to assess relationships between patients’ attitudes and employees’ attitudes working in 

departments not directly involved in the delivery o f a healthcare service.  Table 29 examines 

employee and patient attitudes for employees working in environmental and dietary services, 

while Table 30 combines employee data for employees working in environmental and dietary 

services with data for those working in general admissions and billing.  Both tables show a 

consistent pattern of relationships between these service workers’ customer orientation (CUST) 

and patients’ attitudes regarding multiple facets of inpatient satisfaction.

As discussed earlier, the customer orientation variable was created from a subset of items 

appearing on the professional orientation variable (ETHIC) and the addition of another customer 

service-related item.  For this reason, some degree of overlap would have been expected in terms 

of the relationships which emerged between these two employee variables and the patient 

variables.  This did not appear to be the case, however, as professional orientation showed little 

relationship to patient satisfaction for employees providing these support services.  The primary 

difference between the professional orientation and customer orientation variables pertained to 

employees’ understanding of department and organizational goals, perceiving encouragement to 

continually improve and perceiving work as worthwhile and important.  The lack of any pattern 

of relationship between patient satisfaction and employees’ professional orientation may be 

reflective of how employees in these departments view their work.  Perhaps employees in these 

areas care about and respect patients (i.e., exhibit a customer orientation), but fail to understand 

their work in the larger scheme of the organization’s operations (i.e., perceive an understanding 

of department and organizational goals, accountability for getting work done or encouragement 

to continually improve).

Ill

Emotional Labor

The emotional labor literature is useful for establishing a context within which some the 

unusual findings in this study might make a bit of sense, such as the negative relationship found 

between nurses’ satisfaction with their direct supervision and patients’ satisfaction with the 

nursing care they received.  There was a similar finding for personnel holding different positions 

in support service groups (e.g., across job codes in the areas of environmental services, dietary 

services, general admissions and billing; see Table 30) between attitudes about direct supervision 

and patients’ global satisfaction with their inpatient visit and with their satisfaction with how the 

staff worked together to coordinate their care.

Emotional labor has to do with the effects of acting consistently with expected display 

behaviors associated with the job.  As defined earlier, emotional labor refers to “the display of 

expected emotions by sen/ice agents during service encounters” (Ashforth & Humphrey; p. 88). 

For nurses, patients might expect the expression of concern or empathy.  Indeed, several of the 

human resource experts interviewed for this study indicated this is an important aspect of their 

job.  All else equal, it is probably easier for a nurse to devote more resources (i.e., concern and 

empathy) to the patient when he or she is satisfied with the work environment.  The provision of 

healthcare is no doubt an important service; incumbents holding the nursing position may be able 

to compensate for disaffection in such a way that it (i.e., the disaffection) is not readily apparent 

to recipient of care.  If this is case, it is possible that nurses and service workers in this study 

were compensating for the dissatisfaction with their direct supervision and that this was 

perceived positively by patients.

Indeed, this mode of operation would be consistent with one of the response patterns to 

role conflict discussed by Shamir (1980).  According to Shamir, persons experiencing role

112

conflict may respond by overacting, thereby increasing identification with their service role.  In 

this case, nurses may have been overacting in terms of the expression o f empathy and concern to 

the positive reaction of patients.  Discussions with human resource personnel from each 

participating hospital indicated that by virtue of their position (i.e., coordinating patient care, 

having close physical proximity to patients and frequently having contact with patients) nurses 

have a proclivity to engage in extra-role behaviors.  Engaging in extra-role behaviors may be an 

avenue by which overacting is manifested.  Citizenship behaviors are often performed for 

reasons other than pure altruism (Liden & Mitchell,  1988; Bolino,  1999); in this case, citizenship 

behaviors may have been used to reduce the perceived dissonance brought about by job 

disaffection.

Subservient Service Role Status 

A brief discussion with the compensation manager for the healthcare organization 

revealed that technicians do have a fair amount of contact with patients, but often perform 

undesirable work or work delegated to them by professionals who work in more skilled positions 

requiring more education.  It is possible that technicians may view themselves as quasi­

professionals, given their frequent interaction with patients, but presumably self-perceived lower 

status among direct providers of healthcare.  In other words, it seems highly possible that 

technicians are probably able to notice that they do not interact with patients at as high an 

intellectual level as do others directly delivering healthcare services.

In Shamir’s (1980) terms, then, technicians may view themselves as performing 

subservient service roles relative to others delivering healthcare services in a hospital setting.  In 

this light, technicians’ perceptions of their professional orientation and understanding of the 

healthcare industry as variables most strongly related to patients’ satisfaction with the staffs in x-

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


113

ray/radiology, laboratory, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy and speech 

therapy makes a certain degree of sense.  The fact that these variables for work groups 

performing this service role demonstrated consistent positive relationships with patient 

satisfaction in the aforementioned areas could possibility indicate technicians’ desire to be 

viewed as professionals.  Apparently, it has not gone unnoticed by patients when workers 

performing this role take their job seriously (i.e., have a strong professional orientation) and 

understand the changes in the healthcare industry and the implications those changes have for 

individuals performing his service role.

Appropriate Level of Analysis in a Healthcare Setting 

In a hospital setting, the patient is theoretically at the center of all organizational efforts. 

Thus in this type of environment, all employees are essentially boundary role personnel (Adams, 

1976), constantly interacting with and providing services to constituents external to the 

organization.  Given the attentional resources devoted to patients by practically all service groups 

examined in this study, the question arises as to whether patients are truly able to differentiate 

among those serving them.  Human resource experts all indicated that personnel are required to 

wear nametags bearing an employee’s work area (in addition to one’s name) and stated personnel 

typically introduce themselves and the purpose of a service encounter before it begins.  For 

instance, one might say, “Hello, my name is Sue from x-ray/radiology.  I’m going to be taking a 

chest x-ray today.”  Despite these efforts, it is plausible that patients do not always know the 

specific work group or department from which an employee originates.

Many patients are not familiar with the intricacies of the healthcare delivery system and 

consequently may mistake one person wearing surgical scrubs for another.  For instance, it seems 

questionable whether a patient could differentiate between a technician and a service worker both

reporting to the supervisor of a nursing unit.  An appropriate analogy might be to ask a novice 

sports fan to distinguish among the individuals playing different positions in a team sport.  To 

the untrained eye, it may appear as if the guard and the center are both working toward the goal 

of scoring a basket in a basketball game.  While this may be true in a basic sense, each position 

has a more refined set of responsibilities associated with it.  Similarly, patients may sense 

differences in roles and responsibilities among hospital staff with which they interact in a global 

sense, but may be unable to tease out the specifics.

An inpatient visit can be extremely complex in terms of the different personnel with 

which a patient can potentially interact over the course of several days (the average length of an 

inpatient visit across over 4,000 cases of patient satisfaction data was approximately four days).

It might be the case that patients generalize their sentiments about the care they receive to 

multiple facets of the hospital environment,  including other work groups, the food and 

environmental surroundings.  Indeed, in several cases, employee attitude variables were 

inexplicably related to patients’ satisfaction with the food.  In other words, patients may form a 

global impression about their satisfaction with an inpatient visit, using it as the basis for 

answering questions about other specific facets of the care they received.  Deviations from this 

global impression may occur when a patient can recall a critical incident, or specific instance 

with a specific person, thereby eliciting an exception rating.

The fact that many significant relationships emerged, but were not all expected or in the 

expected direction, could indicate that the most appropriate level of analysis in a healthcare 

setting is the physical facility (e.g., hospital, or other type of treatment center) in which the 

patient is served and not the work groups with which patients interact.  If patients are unable to 

distinguish among the personnel with which they interact, the most appropriate level of analysis

115

would be at the hospital level for gauging overall satisfaction with an inpatient visit.  However, 

this may complicate the linkage of patient data with employee data in this type of setting. 

Aggregation statistics associated with with the employee data suggested the work group level 

was more appropriate than the hospital level.

Direction of Causality

Much of the popular business wisdom has implicitly assumed the direction of causality in 

relating employee and customer attitudes runs from the employee to the customer.  Others, such 

as the developers of the Service Profit Chain model (Heskett et al.,  1997), state this assumption a 

bit more explicitly and adhere to the maxim that satisfied employees lead to satisfied customers. 

To the author’s knowledge, only two studies have been published to date with the 

methodological rigor to sufficiently address issues relating to the direction of causality.  The 

specifics of Ryan et al. (1996) and Schneider et al. (1998) have been reviewed elsewhere in this 

paper, but one fact bears repeating.  Neither of these studies found support for the notion that 

satisfied employees exclusively lead to satisfied customers.  Ryan et al. (1996) found support for 

the idea that customer satisfaction leads to employee satisfaction while Schneider et al. (1998) 

found support for a reciprocal relationship.

In the present study, direction of causality could not be assessed due limitations in the 

data (i.e., sample size restrictions and the fact that data were not available for different points in 

time); nonetheless, it is an issue worth considering.  Ryan et al. (1996) stated service workers 

might be especially susceptible to external organizational influences given that these workers 

often have more contact with customers than with co-workers, supervisors or management. 

Operating under this assumption, it seems plausible that different directions in causality might be 

observable within a healthcare setting given the differences in frequency and depth of contact

1 1 6

among boundary role personnel.  For instance, patient attitudes may have a greater impact on 

nurses than on service workers, since nurses are more intricately involved with patients during 

the course of an inpatient visit.  Conversely, employees performing support service roles (i.e., 

delivering food, keeping the hospital environment clean, changing supplies in patients’ rooms) 

may be more likely to impact patients’ attitudes than be influenced by patients’ attitudes.

Another interesting way of viewing issues relating to the direction of causality pertains to 

the type of service being rendered to the customer.  As Ryan et al. (1996) noted, conventional 

business wisdom posits a positive relationship between the amount of interaction with the 

customer and customer satisfaction.  Depending on the service offering, however, this may not 

make much sense.  For example, Ryan et al. noted one possible explanation for employee 

satisfaction being influenced by customer satisfaction was that customers being served were 

having credit problems, and thus probably did not relish the service being delivered (i.e., 

collecting on bad debt and/or working out repayment plans).  Similarly, patients in the hospital 

may not relish the service being delivered; most likely, patients view an inpatient hospital visit as 

necessary, but not desirable.  One can envision other service sectors where patrons do not 

necessarily seek out a particular service offering, but require it nonetheless (e.g., funeral 

services).  As a result of the potentially unpleasurable manner with which patients view the 

delivery of healthcare services, healthcare employees may be more susceptible to situational 

influences than are other service workers.

One difference between the delivery of healthcare and collecting on delinquent loans (vis- 

a-vis Ryan et al.,  1996) is that recipients of healthcare might be more likely to believe that 

service personnel want to help and are truly interested in the welfare of the customer (i.e., 

patient).  It is doubtful the same can be said for customers of a financing company who are

117

behind on payments; these customers seem more likely to view the organization and its boundary 

personnel with suspicion, which is likely to affect the entire tone of the service interaction.  Even 

in situations where customers are likely to perceive the service encounter as a “necessary evil” it 

is reasonable to believe the organization can take steps to positively impact customer attitudes. 

Indeed, this is what Schneider et al. (1998) appear to be describing when they talk about a 

climate for service.

According to Schneider et al. (1998), foundation issues lay the groundwork for a climate 

for service.  Foundation issues pertain to facilitative work conditions and the quality of 

interdepartment service, both of which are necessary for a work group to be prepared to deliver 

quality service.  Schneider et al. (1998) explained in some detail the role of a climate for service 

in the interdependent, or reciprocal relationship they observed between employee and customer 

attitudes in a retail banking environment.  Regardless of the nature of the service being rendered, 

it seems there is always an opportunity to deliver quality service and foster goodwill with 

customers, and the concepts of foundation issues and a climate for service are vehicles toward 

that end.  This raises the question of whether or not an observed direction of causality could used 

for organizational diagnostic purposes, being symptomatic of some organizational problem and 

whether or not the direction o f causality is malleable.  In the context of Ryan et al. (1996), 

causality leading from customer attitudes to employee morale might alternatively be viewed as 

having less to do with the type of service being rendered and more to do with the state of 

management and organizational practices in place to assist service personnel with their duties 

and responsibilities.  For instance, the results of Ryan et al. (1996), tentative as they may be, 

raise the question of whether the service personnel in their study were trained well enough to 

cope with and handle the negative affectivity directed their way by customers.

118

In the current study, similarities between the facets of the work environment most 

strongly related to patient attitudes and Schneider et al.’s (1998) foundation issues could be 

observed.  The facets of the work environment most strongly related to patient satisfaction 

revolved around employees’ attitudes regarding administrative practices and policies, perceived 

professional orientation, feeling informed about organizational activities and overall pride and 

satisfaction with the organization.  A review of the items associated with these employee attitude 

dimensions (see Table 4) suggests a theme of task facilitation, or the removal of obstacles 

impeding the delivery of quality service.  It is difficult to speculate about the direction of 

causality in the current study without the appropriate data, however it can be said that perhaps 

the most advantageous position for an organization is achieving a reciprocal relationship between 

employee and customer attitudes.  Foundation issues in the work environment are necessary for a 

climate for service, which can ultimately impact customer attitudes.  However, being 

organizationally open to customer feedback can be helpful for making adjustments in the service 

environment, which can further enhance customer attitudes.

Implications for Management 

Contemporary models of organizational performance (e.g., the balanced scorecard 

approach; Kaplan & Norton,  1993) stress the importance of aligning policies, practices and 

culture with the organization’s strategic vision for current and future operations.  In simpler 

terms, what an organization’s members do, and how they act, should be congruent with where 

the organization wants to go.  In the healthcare arena, this all but necessitates keeping tabs on 

patient satisfaction.  With the advent of tools like the internet, a powerful means of quickly 

disseminating and gaining access to information, consumers are in perhaps the best position ever 

to make educated decisions in selecting a healthcare provider.  Indeed, the term “market-driven

119

healthcare” (Herzlinger,  1997) is reflective of the fact that consumers have choices in making 

healthcare-related decisions and that the healthcare industry is being forced to respond.

While monitoring and striving to improve patient satisfaction will continue to play an 

integral role in healthcare organizations’ vision for current and future operations, the question 

remains as to how increased levels of patient satisfaction can be attained.  While there are 

obviously no simple answers to this question, the assessment of employee and customer attitudes 

has the potential to play an effective role in providing management with useful information in 

assessing alignment between where the organization wants to go and what it is doing to get there. 

This is true in the healthcare industry as well as other service industries.

Using Focused Employee and Customer Surveys in Linkage Research

As noted by Heskett et al. (1997) and by Schneider et al. (1998), employees working at 

the boundary of the organization (i.e., those employees having extensive customer contact) are in 

an excellent position to observe, and report back to management about what is and is not 

working in service of the customer.  Similarly, customers themselves are poised to offer feedback 

about perceptions of service quality and overall satisfaction.  Organizational surveys can be an 

effective tool for tapping into the perceptions of both employees and customers, but the survey 

instrument should be developed with a particular need or issue in mind.  Survey efforts need to 

move beyond the assessment of general employee or customer satisfaction and towards the 

assessment of employee and customer attitudes in more focused fashion.  This is especially true 

if organizations seek to link, or establish relationships between employee and customer 

perceptions in an effort to identify where policies, practices and cultural elements of the work 

environment are aligned with overall company direction.

Attitude surveys can provide management needed information with which to set or 

change company direction, but the purpose of all survey efforts should be clearly defined up 

front and should logically lead into the survey design process.  This approach was outlined 

recently by Schneider et al. (1996), as it was employed in a large insurance organization.  In 

particular, they developed employee survey content around the seven elements of the 

organization’s business strategy with an emphasis on identifying the policies and practices in 

place to support those elements.  Using the survey as a communications tool, employees were 

asked about what was actually going on in the organization as opposed to how they felt. 

Ultimately this information was associated with customer satisfaction ratings and used to identify 

policies and practices both fostering and impeding the delivery of quality service.  The focused 

use of an organizational survey in this case was described by Schneider et al. (1998) in the 

following manner:  “...our purpose was not to test some theory of organizational functioning but 

to establish those facets of the strategy most strongly reflected in important business outcomes” 

(p. 699).

Organizing Data for Enhanced Utility in Linkage Research

Equally important as identifying relevant survey content is ensuring the data can be 

organized as needed to address the issue(s) at hand.  For example, if one goal is to establish 

relationships between organizational functioning at the work group level and customer 

satisfaction with that particular work group, data need to be captured and organized at that level.

It does the organization little good to ask about satisfaction with a particular work group without 

building in the capability to sort data appropriately.  While this may appear obvious, it is a point 

which often does not get the attention it deserves during the survey development process.  For 

instance, linking employee data, customer data and organizational performance data across

121

multiple branches of a retail bank will permit conclusions only at the bank branch level.  Asking 

customers about their satisfaction with different service personnel within the branch office will 

provide management with little additional insight unless employees are also asked to identify 

their respective roles.

To be sure, needs and uses for survey data often arise which can not be forecasted prior to 

the survey process.  However, to the extent data can be collected at as fine a level of detail as 

possible, without becoming administratively untenable or causing concern among respondents 

about anonymity, organizations will be better positioned to get the most out of the data they have 

taken the time to collect.  It is not uncommon for users of survey data to think about only the 

immediate need at the time data are collected.  However, users of survey data should be 

reminded of the potential use of their data sets at some point in the future.  It takes only a little 

foresight to collect a bit of extra information up front, but significant benefit could be realized at 

some point in the future by tapping into archival data.

Implications for Action at the Client Healthcare Organization

The employee and patient data used in the current study were collected independently of 

each other, without anticipating the linkage of the two data sets.  It is often the case, as it was 

here, that employee attitude data is used primarily by an organization’s human resource function 

and customer satisfaction data is used by marketing or strategic planning groups.  While valuable 

information can be gained by examining data from different sources in isolation of each other, 

further value-add can be derived by examining these data in conjunction with each other, or with 

data from still other sources (e.g., work group performance data, organizational financial 

performance, etc.); this may necessitate working cooperatively with other organizational units, 

such as finance or accounting.  The client healthcare organization in this study is encouraged to

122

review its strategic plan for the express purpose of ascertaining where employee and patient 

attitude survey processes could provide helpful information in identifying gaps between where 

the organization is currently and where it wants to go.  Of course, using existing survey processes 

to address different or additional organizational issues may necessitate alteration in one or both 

the actual survey instrument, or the process by which data are collected.

If the organization wished to pursue the exploration of attitude linkages between 

employees and patients at the work group level, it should first do so in a manner consistent with 

the organization’s overall strategic direction.  Beyond this obvious fact however, it should 

reconsider how data are collected on both the employee and patient sides of the equation.  In the 

current study employee-patient linkages were formed, but indirectly.  Ultimately, the goal of the 

employee-patient linkage process should be to properly match patient attitudes with the attitudes 

of employees who served those patients to provide management with information to guide future 

action.  Toward this end, employee data could be collected in more specific fashion, moving 

beyond general job code categories and toward specific job titles.  This would be a useful step 

because the human resource function of the organization maintains job descriptive information, 

providing details about how incumbents in each role interact with and serve patients.  It is 

important to note that management would not need to receive (or pay a survey vendor for) 

individual reports for each and every job title, but the information would be captured to facilitate 

“behind the scenes” analyses capable of addressing strategic imperatives.

On the patient side of the equation, steps could be taken to more accurately track which 

work groups patients have contact with during the course of their inpatient visit.  For instance, 

when asking about satisfaction with the x-ray/radiology staff, it is possible that more than one 

hospital department could be classified as x-ray/radiology; some patients may have had contact

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


123

with only one o f these while other patients may have had contact with more than one.  This is 

problematic even if patient satisfaction data is used in isolation of employee attitude (or other) 

data, since it is unclear to which work group a patient referenced when a response to a survey 

item was provided.  The more specific the manner in which data are captured, the more specific 

the feedback which can be given.

Obtaining patient attitude data about specific services received from particular work 

groups, and then accurately matching that information with attitude data collected from the 

employee work groups serving those patients should yield more substantive information with 

which to guide management’s efforts.  In the current study, patient attitude data were collected 

about multiple job groups (i.e., x-ray/radiology, laboratory, respiratory therapy, etc.), however, 

the data were organized only by nursing discharge unit (i.e., the nursing unit from which patients 

are ultimately discharged).  Even though the data regarding these non-nursing work units is 

communicated back to the relevant work groups, its use is still of questionable utility given the 

global phrasing of the survey items employed.  For instance, asking about global satisfaction 

about a particular work group does not provide any information about how concrete 

improvements could be made.  It may make more sense to ask patients about their perceptions of 

the service quality associated with the core service or services provided by each work group.  For 

instance, instead of asking about overall satisfaction with the x-ray/radiology staff, patients 

might be asked if they were treated with respect and dignity, or if their privacy was respected 

during the testing procedures.  Issues such as these are probably important to patients receiving 

this service since, for example, disrobing is often required for such tests.  Low reports of 

satisfaction in this area provide management with some concrete direction for improvement.

124

Another way in which current employee and patient survey processes may be redesigned 

is to identify a “typical path,” or sequence of departments patients receiving a particular type of 

care usually go through on their road to recovery.  For instance patients receiving neonatal care 

might typically receive one set of services from a variety o f work groups, while cardiac patients 

no doubt receive a different set of services.  While it is unclear if tracking patients’ inpatient 

visits from start to finish is administratively or practically feasible, one can imagine a mass- 

customization approach to assessing patient satisfaction.  When patients are contacted to 

participate in the satisfaction interview protocol, the questions they are asked could be tailored to 

the specific services they received.  With respect to the employee data collected, employees 

could be asked about the effectiveness of the policies and practices in place to support delivery of 

the core service associated with each work group.  Such an approach would provide management 

with targeted information for improvement.

In terms of making targeted improvements as a result of findings in this study, a few 

courses of action could be taken.  Although the relationships were not strong, Table 20 does 

suggest that employees’ attitudes about a few facets of the work environment are positively 

related to patients’ global satisfaction with their inpatient visit.  To some extent, the areas where 

significant relationships were observed (i.e., administrative policies and practices, professional 

orientation, feeling informed and overall pride and satisfaction with the organization) resemble 

the foundation issues discussed by Schneider et al. (1998) as being a necessary condition to 

establish a climate for service.  In short, foundations issues are defined as factors in the work 

environment supporting work behaviors (Schneider et al.,  1998).  The individual items in the 

survey categories just mentioned pertain to conflict resolution and issues of fairness 

(administrative policies and practices); understanding department and organizational goals,

125

realizing the importance of one’s work and having a continuous improvement orientation 

(professional orientation); and feeling informed about changes, activities and events in the 

organization (feeling informed).  Management is encouraged to raise the level of cognizance 

among its ranks regarding the relationships between these facets of the work environment and 

patient satisfaction, and to disseminate this information to staff employees as well.  Such 

communications should serve as an affirmation that what goes on in the organization on a day-to- 

day basis does matter in the eyes of those being served.

It was expected that attitudes about the work environment would be more strongly related 

to patient satisfaction for some job types than others and that the facets of the work environment 

most related to patient satisfaction would vary as a function of job type.  By and large, the 

evidence gathered in this study did not confirm these expectations.  However, a few findings in 

this vein are worth noting and do have implications for practice.  Table 24 shows that 

technicians’ professional orientation and understanding of the healthcare industry were related to 

patients’ satisfaction with most of the staff areas in which technicians work (i.e., respiratory 

therapy, x-ray/radiology, laboratory, physical therapy and occupational therapy).  While it is 

somewhat unclear why these facets of the work environment were positively related to patients’ 

satisfaction with the aforementioned work groups for technicians and not for the employees in 

the “Other Professionals” job group (who also work extensively in non-nursing work groups 

directly providing healthcare services), the result suggests a potentially useful management 

action.

Rucci et al. (1998) discussed the use of learning maps at Sears to teach employees about 

changes in the retailing environment as well as the implications of those changes for employees’ 

jobs.  Given that understanding of the healthcare industry was a factor related to patients’

satisfaction with certain facets of their inpatient visit (i.e., care received from the work areas 

mentioned above), the use o f learning maps or some other mechanism to teach technicians about 

industry changes could be beneficial.  As discussed earlier, the fact that professional orientation 

and industry understanding were related to patient satisfaction for technicians, but not others, 

may stem from a desire for an increased professional status relative to other professionals and 

nurses.  Regardless of the explanation, strides could be made by taking a more active role in 

fostering an understanding about regionalization and other changes the organization has gone 

through as a result of industry change.  While the benefit of this increased understanding may be 

most pronounced for technicians, other employee groups may benefit as well.

The use of customer service training, or training personnel about appropriate service- 

oriented behaviors should be most appropriate for personnel working in areas providing non­

healthcare services.  Tables 29 and 30 provide preliminary evidence that these service workers’ 

customer orientation was related positively with patients’ satisfaction with these service areas. 

Employees working in environmental services, dietary' services, general admissions and billing 

most closely resemble the type of front-line service worker explored in much of the prior linkage 

research in which it was also found that self-perceived service orientation was related to 

customer attitudes (e.g., Schlesinger & Zomitsky, 1991; Wiley,  1991).  Thus, management’s 

efforts should be geared towards maintaining or improving these workers’ perceived customer 

orientation.  Again, this most likely encompasses paying attention to foundation issues, or the 

factors in the work environment supportive of the delivery of quality service.  Since no 

relationships were observed between patient satisfaction and these workers’ attitudes about 

administrative policies and practices (discussed previously as a possible foundation issue),

management is encouraged to explore further what obstacles may be impeding desired work 

behaviors in the areas of environmental services, dietary services, general admissions and billing.

Finally, no relationships emerged between patients’ satisfaction with their nursing care 

and nurses’ attitudes about the work environment, except for a negative relationship between 

patients’ satisfaction in this area and nurses satisfaction with direct supervision.  The lack of any 

observable relationship may mean that nurses are experienced coping with the less desirable 

aspects of their work environment and that nurses’ workplace concerns are transparent in the 

view of their patients.  While this may be the case, management should be advised of the 

continued level of importance which should be placed on enabling this important contingency of 

service providers to perform their work effectively in the eyes of patients.

Limitations of the Current Study 

While the data appear to suggest the type of service interaction does play a part in the 

relationship between employee and customer attitudes, a few notes of caution are in order.  First, 

every attempt was made to accurately link patient attitudes with the attitudes of employees who 

served those patients.  There is no way to be  100% sure that this process was conducted without 

error, but conversations with human resource personnel and organizational records indicate that 

links established in this study were appropriate.  Ambiguity arises when one considers that 

patients often move from department to department during the course of an inpatient visit, but 

that the organizing device for the patient data was the nursing unit from patients were ultimately 

discharged.  Thus, it is conceivable that when asked about satisfaction with the nursing care they 

received, patients mentally referenced nurses other than those working in the unit from which 

they were discharged.

128

Another undesirable aspect of the current study was the replication of patient satisfaction 

data so that it could be associated with each separate job code within a particular department.

The effects of this replication process are difficult to pinpoint, but no doubt caused some 

spurious relationships to arise.  For instance, many of the relationships emerging between 

employee variables and patients’ satisfaction with physical therapy, occupational therapy, 

respiratory therapy and speech therapy were not expected, and some of these findings are 

presumably statistical artifacts due to the relatively small number of patients responding to 

questions about these groups (see Table 7) and due to the patient data replication strategy.

For the most part, however, conclusions were based on broad trends and patterns in the 

correlations (e.g., an employee variable showing a relationship with multiple patient variables, or 

vice-versa), both within and across matrices (i.e., Tables 18 to 30).

Also an issue in the current study is that the patient satisfaction data did not really get at 

multiple facets o f patient satisfaction, per se, but rather assessed global satisfaction with multiple 

work groups.  In several cases, this global assessment was ascertained with a single item (i.e., 

staffs in x-ray/radiology, laboratory, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy 

and speech therapy), while in other cases it was ascertained with at least two items (e.g., nursing 

care, room/hospital cleanliness).  As has been found in the job satisfaction literature, asking 

about global satisfaction can yield different results from ascertaining global satisfaction by 

computing a composite of multiple, more specific, facets o f satisfaction (Ironson, Smith,

Brannick, Gibson & Paul,  1989).

An alternative approach to gauging patient satisfaction might yield different results as 

well as address the concern that patients do not always realize with whom they are interacting.

For instance, one alternative would be to ask patients questions about the specific services they

129

received, as opposed to asking about global satisfaction with a particular work group.  For 

instance, instead of asking patients about their overall satisfaction with the laboratory staff, they 

could be asked specific questions about the process of having blood drawn, or about other tasks 

performed by personnel in the laboratory.

Despite the difficulties associated with data analysis in the current study, it is a useful 

first step towards understanding the linkage of employee and customer attitudes at a finer level of 

detail.  Services involving front-line personnel make up only a fraction of service offerings in the 

economy, yet the vast majority of the linkage research has concentrated on these job types.  No 

doubt much of the existing linkage research has taken place in a simple service context because 

of the relative methodological ease with which research questions can be addressed.  Without a 

willingness to leam what we can, however, from what are in some cases “messy” data sets, the 

state of a given research protocol (e.g., linkage research) runs the risk of stagnation.  Indeed,

Ryan et al. (1996) had this to say about the general hesitance to work with messy data:  “...unless 

human resource researchers make efforts to link interventions to the data and outcomes 

organizations rely upon, our ability to establish our value in a time of shrinking resources will be 

lessened” (p. 878).

CHAPTER V 

Summary

Prior efforts to establish an empirical relationship between job satisfaction and 

organizational performance have been less than fruitful (e.g., Brayfield & Crockett,  1955; 

Iaffaldano & Muchinsky,  1985).  Current lines of inquiry into this research question, however, 

have expanded the purview of organizational performance to include measures of customer 

satisfaction and customer perceptions of service quality.  Satisfaction of the consumer 

stakeholder group can be viewed as a measure of organizational performance, since satisfied 

customers are more likely to be repeat customers (Jones & Sasser,  1995).  Due to the costs of 

acquiring new customers, organizations strive to retain as much of their current customer base as 

possible in an effort to maximize profitability (Reichheld & Sasser,  1990).

Research to date is suggestive of a relationship between employee and customer attitudes. 

For instance, Schneider, Parkington and Buxton (1980) demonstrated that employees and 

customers share similar perceptions of overall service quality and Schneider and Bowen (1985) 

showed support for the idea that employee perceptions of the work environment are related to 

customer attitudes.

Much of the research in this area, however, has involved only front-line customer service 

representatives (e.g., bank tellers, front-desk personnel at hotels) with extensive amounts of 

customer contact.  Little is known about the relationship between employee and customer 

attitudes for other types of service positions, or about how the employee-customer attitude 

relationships for other positions might differ from those established with the prototypical front­

line customer service representative.  The current study examined multiple job types within a 

single organization to examine whether different types of service interactions are differentially

related to customer attitudes.  Relevant literature from the disciplines of industrial/organizational 

psychology, social psychology and marketing research was reviewed to shed light on why 

differential relationships are expected between employee and customer attitudes, depending on 

the nature of the service interaction.

This study illustrated some o f the challenges associated with linking employee and 

customer attitudes in the context of a complex service interaction.  Overall, however, results 

indicate that employee attitudes were related to patient attitudes in a hospital setting in the 

context of an inpatient visit.  Specifically, employees’ attitudes regarding the organization’s 

administrative policies and practices, employees’ professional orientation, whether or not they 

feel informed about organizational activities and their overall pride and satisfaction with the 

organization were most related to patient's global satisfaction with their inpatient visit.  Facets of 

the work environment most strongly related to patients’ perceptions of how well the staff worked 

together to coordinate care were attitudes regarding administrative policies and practices, 

professional orientation, feeling informed about organizational activities and an understanding of 

the healthcare industry.

In general, results suggested that the type of service interaction does play a role in 

moderating the relationship between employee and customer attitudes.  For example, no 

relationships were found between patient satisfaction and business office/clerical employees’ 

attitudes about the work environment.  Preliminary evidence was found for the notion that facets 

of the work environment were differentially related to patient attitudes, depending on the nature 

of the service role being performed.  Perceived professional orientation and an understanding of 

the healthcare industry, for instance, appeared to be most important for technicians, while 

perceived customer orientation played an important role for service workers.  Results are
