 ABSTRACT: The objective of this study is to examine the market valuation of environ-
 mental capital expenditure investment related to pollution abatement in the pulp and
 paper industry. The total environmental capital expenditure of $8.7 billion by our sample
 firms during 1989-2000 supports the focus on this industry. In order to be capitalized,
 an asset should be associated with future economic benefits. The existing environ-
 mental literature suggests that investors condition their evaluation of the future eco-
 nomic benefits arising from environmental capital expenditure on an assessment of the
 firms' environmental performance. This literature predicts the emergence of two envi-
 ronmental stereotypes: low-polluting firms that overcomply with existing environmental
 regulations, and high-polluting firms that just meet minimal environmental requirements.
 Our valuation evidence indicates that there are incremental economic benefits asso-
 ciated with environmental capital expenditure investment by low-polluting firms but not
 high-polluting firms. We also find that investors use environmental performance infor-
 mation to assess unbooked environmental liabilities, which we interpret to represent
 the future abatement spending obligations of high-polluting firms in the pulp and paper
 industry. We estimate average unbooked liabilities of $560 million for high-polluting
 firms, or 16.6 percent of market capitalization.

 I. INTRODUCTION

 C ompliance with stringent environmental regulations can significantly increase pro-
 duction costs in polluting industries such as pulp and paper, chemical, steel, and
 utilities (Joshi et. al. 2001). The magnitude of the costs to comply with environ-

 mental regulations is such that securities regulators and accounting academics are calling
 for increased accounting disclosure and standardized measurement of corporate environ-
 mental activities (Barth et. al. 1997; Beets and Souther 1999).

 The capitalization of environmental capital expenditure investments (hereafter ECE)
 related to pollution abatement is controversial. Existing accounting standards (FASB 1989,
 1990) require capitalizing such expenditures due to the long-lived nature of pollution abate-
 ment facilities. However, some critics question the capitalization of abatement outlays, since
 such expenditures result in no incremental increase in future economic benefits (CICA
 1993). Consider, for example, the classic issue of asbestos removal costs. Critics would
 argue that such outlays should be expensed as repairs rather than capitalized as betterments.
 Supporters of existing accounting standards argue that abatement costs represent additional
 costs of previously anticipated benefits from the related capital asset and invoke the concept
 of matching to support capitalization. This controversy remains unresolved in the fixed
 assets literature. In contrast, there is a clear consensus that site remediation costs should
 be expensed since there are no incremental future economic benefits.

 We look to the environmental economics literature for guidance on whether future

 incremental economic benefits exist when firms incur abatement outlays. Traditional eco-
 nomic theory suggests that firms should meet only the minimal environmental standards
 prescribed by law a wi nd will be reluctant to spend more than necessary (McCain 1978).
 However, the recent environmental economics literature offers several explanations as to
 why firms may choose to overcomply with existing environmental regulations. Potential
 incremental benefits associated with overcompliance include the creation of "green good-
 will" (Arora and Gangopadhyay 1995), incentives to innovate (Porter and van der Linde
 1995) and raising rivals' costs (Salop and Scheffman 1983, 1987). Low-polluting firms
 enjoy the above benefits whereas the minimum compliance abatement expenditures of high-
 polluting firms represent the costs of environmental externalities now imposed on firms'
 shareholders. In effect, high-polluting firms incur pollution abatement outlays with no in-
 cremental return.

 We examine the market valuation of environmental capital expenditures conditional on
 the firm's environmental performance. Based on the claimed benefits for overcompliance,
 we hypothesize that the market positively values ECE investments for low-polluting firms;
 the market assigns a value of zero to the ECE investments of high-polluting firms; and
 finally, the market assesses the existence of unbooked environmental liabilities (future abate-
 ment spending obligations) for high-polluting firms. Our results are consistent with our
 predictions.

 We explore the above research questions for a single industry, pulp and paper, because
 a single industry setting offers a number of advantages. First, the pulp and paper industry
 in the U.S. is well known for its water and air pollution (see Magat and Viscusi 1990) and
 has faced ever more stringent emission standards since the 1970s. Second, environmental
 performance measures such as toxic release emissions are better specified and measurable

 within a single industry, because the various types of emissions are more homogenous.'
 Finally, our empirical valuation model places restrictions on coefficient estimates that are
 more likely to be satisfied when pooling across firms in a single industry.

 Our findings have implications for a number of important constituents. In order to be
 capitalized, an asset should be associated with future economic benefits. Thus, our study
 provides information on the representational faithfulness of an accounting amount, ECE
 (Barth et al. 2001). Our valuation evidence suggests that there are incremental economic
 benefits associated with the ECE investments of low-, but not high-polluting firms in the
 pulp and paper industry. This finding is useful to the FASB if they reconsider the issue of
 whether to capitalize ECE.2 Second, to management, investors, and to SEC enforcement
 staff who assess MD&A disclosure compliance, our study provides evidence of unbooked
 environmental liabilities for high-polluting firms and a methodology for ranking firms by
 environmental performance. The magnitude of future capital spending obligations related
 to proposed environmental legislation is a specific MD&A disclosure requirement. Third,
 our evidence is of interest to providers of assurance of firm environmental reports. Our
 methodology for reliably ranking pulp and paper firms in terms of environmental perform-
 ance suggests that such performance measures are suitable for audit, thus deterring "green-
 washing" in firm environmental reports (Beets and Souther 1999).3

 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we briefly
 describe the pulp and paper industry regulatory setting, review the relevant literature and
 develop our hypotheses. In the third section, we present the econometric model, followed
 by a description of our data in the fourth section. Finally, we present our empirical results
 in the fifth section, and our sixth section contains the summary and conclusion.

 II. REGULATORY SETTING, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND

 HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT

 Regulatory Setting

 A prominent feature of environmental regulations in the pulp and paper industry is that

 effluent guidelines are established within the variations of Best Available Technology
 (BAT), defined typically as the average effluent quality calculated over the top 50 percent
 of mills at any given point in time. Thus, firms with the best environmental performance
 effectively set the environmental standards and thereby dictate the evolution of future en-
 vironmental regulations, hence future ECE spending for the rest of the industry. This reg-
 ulatory setting provides support for the existence of two types of firms in the pulp and
 paper industry, low- and high-polluting firms. High-polluting firms have latent environmen-
 tal liabilities as a result of future capital spending obligations to comply with ever more
 stringent environmental regulations. Environmental regulations pertaining to the pulp and
 paper industry have become increasingly stringent since the 1970s. According to an industry

 There is increasing evidence that corporate environmental performance indicators may be industry-specific. The
 results of Campbell et al. (1998) suggest that environmental risk exposure is captured by the number of Super-
 fund sites in the chemical industry, but not in the pulp and paper industry. Cormier and Magnan (1997) find
 that water-based environmental performance measures capture future environmental liabilities for firms in the
 pulp and paper industry, but not for firms in the chemical and oil industry. Thus, studies using inter-industry
 samples may be limited in power when compared to single-industry studies.

 2 As a necessary caveat, our valuation relevance evidence is not sufficient for accounting policy deliberation

 because standard setters consider other purposes of accounting information besides valuation relevance. Addi-
 tionally, our evidence does not purport to measure all of the costs and benefits that a standard setter must
 consider when setting standards (Holthausen and Watts 2001).

 3 While external verification of environmental reports is not currently required in the U.S., many corporations

 voluntarily elect to undergo external environmental examination and verification (Beets and Souther 1999, 134).

 survey,4 total industry ECE spending in 2000 constant dollars since 1970 has been $26.5
 billion, of which $15 billion was spent prior to the period we examine, 1989-2000. While
 firm-specific ECE spending data are not publicly available prior to 1989, we assume that
 our sample low-polluting firms outspent high-polluting firms in the 1970s and 1980s in
 order to obtain their best environmental performance status in our sample period. The
 regulatory setting in the pulp and paper industry is dynamic as future discharge standards
 are set according to BAT. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented
 a comprehensive set of stringent water discharge and air emission standards for the pulp
 and paper industry in November 1997, called the "Cluster Rule." The EPA estimated that
 high-polluting firms in the industry needed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in environ-
 mental capital expenditures by November 2001, in order to comply with these new emission
 standards (EPA 1997). The EPA is currently contemplating a new set of water regulations
 to follow the "Cluster Rule" (PPWRC 2000). This setting allows low-polluting firms to
 pursue a "raising rivals' cost" strategy by continued ECE spending.

 The nature of latent environmental liabilities faced by high-polluting firms differs from

 the liability to remediate existing contamination because the former represent spending to
 abate future pollution. Accountants do not accrue abatement-related capital spending com-
 mitments on the balance sheet until the cash expenditure occurs. Nonetheless, the magnitude
 of future capital spending obligations is of interest to the SEC with respect to enforcement
 of required MD&A disclosures. Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K requires companies to
 discuss in their MD&A the impact of proposed environmental legislation on future opera-
 tions and financial conditions (Cole 1991). Our study provides a methodology for reliably
 ranking pulp and paper firms in terms of environmental performance that may be beneficial
 to SEC enforcement staff when monitoring disclosure compliance.

 Accounting Literature

 Existing accounting research has examined how capital markets combine accounting
 information with "other information" for firm valuation. For example, Ittner and Larcker
 (1998) examine whether the release of customer satisfaction measures provides information
 to the market beyond what is captured in current financial statements. They find customer
 satisfaction measures to be economically relevant, even though they are only partially re-
 flected in current accounting earnings and book values. Similarly, Barth et al. (1998) find
 the pricing multiples on book value and net income in a valuation model depend on a firm's
 financial health as measured by bond ratings. Consistent with these arguments, Barth and
 McNichols (1994) and Hughes (2000) employ nonfinancial pollution measures (number of
 Superfund sites and sulfur dioxide emissions, respectively) to show that such measures
 capture the exposure of high-polluting firms to future environmental liabilities. We view
 relative environmental performance data to be a forward-looking nonfinancial measure that
 has the potential to augment the information in current accounting earnings and book values.
 We examine the market valuation of environmental capital spending conditional on relative
 corporate environmental performance, while at the same time allowing for unbooked en-
 vironmental liabilities.5

 5 Johnson (1995) uses valuation methodology to explore, across a number of industries, whether the market
 valuation of ECE is conditional on relative environmental performance. However, Johnson (1995) does not
 control for environmental liabilities. Furthermore, her estimated valuation coefficient on a dollar of ECE in-
 vestment for firms with above-average toxic releases is negative, an estimate we argue should be lower bounded
 at 0.

 Environmental Economics Literature

 The environmental literature provides support for the argument that the value of a dollar
 of current ECE depends on the firm's environmental performance. Specifically, the literature
 suggests that firms have incentives to take a proactive approach to managing environmental
 impacts, with the benefits of overcompliance arising from a number of sources.

 Arora and Gangopadhyay (1995) provide an explanation for overcompliance within the

 context of a duopoly game. In their setting, two rival firms face a segmented market with
 each choosing an emission (pollution control) technology and a price for its product. They
 show that one firm will choose to spend more on emission technology to become a low-
 polluting firm to attract and retain environmentally conscious consumers who are willing
 to pay a premium for the products made by a superior environmental performer (the notion
 of "green goodwill"). Although it is difficult for pulp and paper firms to derive a price
 premium from a homogenous product such as pulp and paper, low-polluting firms are better
 positioned to secure long-term contracts with customers who practice "green" supply-chain
 management (Walton et al. 1998). This is consistent with anecdotal evidence in the financial
 press.6

 Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that environmental regulations can trigger in-

 novations that will improve corporate operational efficiency by the substitution of less costly
 materials, by better utilization of materials in the process, or by converting waste into more
 valuable forms. In addition, best environmental performers enjoy early-mover advantages
 by tapping into the inteational market the inernao at is moving rapidly toward valuing low-pollution
 and energy-efficient products. King and Lenox (2001) report empirical evidence consistent
 with Porter and van der Linde (1995) in this respect. In particular, they report that "greener"
 firms have lower inventory levels compared to the industry average. This evidence is con-
 sistent with the complementary effect that pollution reduction has on operational
 efficiencies.7

 Another economic benefit of maintaining superior environmental performance is to raise

 rivals' costs. Salop and Scheffman (1987) derive a general model in which a dominant firm
 can choose a cost-raising action that will affect the costs of all firms in the industry, and
 cite environmental standards as one example. The dominant firm can use incremental ECE
 spending to convince the regulators that more stringent environmental standards are eco-
 nomically achievable. The BAT standard-setting process previously discussed will force
 high-polluting firms to spend more on ECE in order to comply with more stringent envi-
 ronmental standards, thus leading to higher costs. Higher costigh s in the Salop and Scheffman
 (1987) model lead to an upward shift to the left in the industry supply curve, which in turn
 results in an increase in the market-clearing price. They show that a sufficient condition
 for this cost-raising strategy to be profitable for the dominant firm is that the price increase
 exceeds the increase in average cost for the dominant firm, i.e., the dominant firms will
 enjoy a higher profit margin.8

 6 The "green goodwill" argument is consistent with anecdotal evidence published in the financial press. See Globe

 & Mail (1994).

 7 Weyerhaeuser, one of our sample firms, installed elemental chlorine-free bleaching technologies several years

 before it was required by the "Cluster Rule." The company stated, "We installed them mostly because our
 customers required that we have these kinds of advanced processes in place to meet their requirements." The
 company indicated that the new technologies have "improved the product quality and reduced costs associated
 with operating the facility" (Canning 1998).

 8 The pulp and paper industry is oligopolistic (the four-firm sales concentration ratio in our sample is 47.0 percent).
 This offers support for the existence of dominant firms as required by Salop and Scheffman's (1987) model.
 According to their model, high-polluting firms will not benefit from the cost-raising action if the resulting
 increase in industry price is less than the increase in the average cost of high-polluting firms.

 Clarkson, Li, and Richardson

 To summarize, the environmental economics literature is unambiguous in claiming that
 economic benefits arise from overcompliance. In our industry setting, no single benefit is
 likely to be the sole explanation for overcompliance. Our valuation model evidence per-
 taining to these claimed benefits is indirect in nature. While our descriptive statistics offer
 some direct evidence in support of the claimed benefits, we do not attempt to discriminate
 between these theories as a rationale for overcompliance. Rather, we rely on the common
 insight from all three theories that economic benefits accrue only to firms with superior
 environmental performance. This key insight lends support to our empirical design that
 conditions the investors' assessment of ECE on environmental performance.

 Hypothesis Development

 The claimed benefits to overcompliance in the environmental economics literature lead

 to the following two hypotheses (in alternate form):

 HI: The market positively values ECE investment for low-polluting firms.

 H2: The market assigns a value of zero to the ECE investment of high-polluting firms.

 The basic intuition underlying HI is that incremental ECE spending by low-polluting
 firms may generate economic benefits ("green goodwill," incentives to innovate and raising
 rivals' costs). High-polluting firms do not enjoy these benefits. Instead, their minimum
 compliance abatement expenditures represent the costs of environmental externalities (pol-
 lution) now imposed on firm shareholders (in effect, a capital outlay with no incremental
 return).

 Our third hypothesis flows naturally from the above two. Low-polluting firms create
 value for shareholders when they incur abatement expenditures. Thus, they do not face
 obligations to incur future abatement expenditures with no incremental return to sharehold-
 ers. High-polluting firms, in contrast, face unbooked liabilities to incur future abatement
 spending as emission standards get tougher. From the perspective of shareholders, these
 represent economic liabilities in terms of commitments to incur future capital outlays with
 no associated incremental return. This suggests the following hypothesis:

 H3: The market assesses the existence of unbooked liabilities (future abatement spend-

 ing obligations) for high-polluting firms.

 III. ECONOMETRIC MODEL

 In order to test the above hypotheses, we need a measure of the theoretical construct,
 relative environmental performance. We develop nonfinancial pollution indicators to mea-
 sure environmental performance, which we then use to classify firms as low- versus high-
 polluting. We adopt two alternative measures for relative environmental performance (EP),
 both based on data publicly available from the EPA. Our primary measure, EPTR, uses data
 from the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) about the release and transfer of toxic chem-
 icals from manufacturing facilities. TRI is the sum of all chemicals (in pounds) released to
 air, water, and land in a particular year. Following Konar and Cohen (1997), we calculate
 EPTRI by deflating aggregate TRI by cost of goods sold to obtain a measure of emissions
 relative to production output. This measure identifies the object of regulatory scrutiny,
 namely, the firms' pollution relative to their production scale. As a control for measurement
 error in this proxy, we also employ an additional environmental performance measure,
 EPBOD, which is based on Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). Existing literature in envi-
 ronmental economics uses BOD as a reliable indicator of water pollution for the pulp and

 paper industry (Magat and Viscusi 1990). The BOD data are available from the EPA's
 Permit Compliance System that tracks permit issuance, permit limits, and actual emissions
 pertaining to facilities. BOD data are available in the Permit Compliance System only on
 a mill-by-mill basis along with mill discharge limits. We calculate EPBOD as the ratio of
 the sum of the BOD discharges across the firm's mills divided by the sum of the mill BOD
 discharge limits.9

 We adopt EPTRI as the basis for our primary environmental performance proxy because
 EPTRI reflects environmental performance in all media (water, air, and solid waste disposal)
 and thus is compatible with our ECE measure, which captures spending in all three areas.
 Moreover, complete EPTRI data are available whereas the EPBOD data are somewhat more
 limited. In order to classify firms as low- and high-polluting, we partition the sample at the
 median EPTRI (EPBOD) for that year. We then create an indicator variable, POLLUTE, and
 set this variable to 1 for high-polluting firms.10

 To investigate whether the market uses environmental performance information to as-
 sess the return on ECE investments, we begin with a modified version of the Ohlson (1995)
 valuation model. In light of prior studies that document the existence of unbooked envi-
 ronmental liabilities (Barth and McNichols 1994; Cormier et al. 1993; Cormier and Magnan
 1997; Hughes 2000), we argue that the market uses environmental performance indicators
 as other information that predicts future negative abnormal earnings beyond a knowledge
 of current abnormal earnings, i.e.,

 V= ao + a, BV + a2AE + a3 POLLUTE + e (1)

 where:

 V = market value of common equity in million dollars, measured three months

 after the firm's fiscal year end;

 BV = book value of common equity in million dollars;
 AE = abnormal earnings to common defined as earnings to common equity less an

 assumed cost of capital based on the CAPM times beginning-of-period book
 value of common equity, in million dollars;"

 POLLUTE = an indicator variable assuming the value of 1 for high-polluting firms, and 0

 otherwise; and

 ? = error term.

 9 This measure is structurally similar to the pollution performance index used in Cormier et. al. (1993) and Cormier
 and Magnan (1997), although they use total mill water flow-through (not always available in the EPA's Permit
 Compliance System database) as a weighting factor to aggregate across mills.

 10 To validate that our POLLUTE labeling captures the underlying construct of interest, relative environmental
 performance, we examine the number of environmental violations and prosecutions of 11 of our sample firms
 (five low-polluting and six high-polluting) covered in the Corporate Environmental Profiles Database developed
 by the Investor Responsibility and Research Center. We find that the five low-polluting firms had an average of
 27 environmental violations and prosecutions during the 1992 to 2000 period, while the high-polluting firms
 had an average of 55 environmental violations and prosecutions during the same period. Thus, firms that we
 label high-polluting do have a higher propensity of noncompliance with environmental regulations. Using a
 randomization test (Noreen 1989), the difference between 55 and 27 is statistically significant at the 0.0074
 level (one-tailed).

 l The cost of equity capital is based on the CAPM (ke = RF + 3[E(RM) - RF]) with [ estimated using 60 months
 of historical return data and updated annually, RF equal to 4.5 percent, and the market price of risk ([E(RM)
 - RF]) equal to 6.5 percent. For support for these estimates, see Siegel (1999). Our results are not affected
 when we vary RF and the market price of risk between 3 to 5 percent and 6 to 8 percent, respectively.

 We then modify Equation (1) based on the assumption that current period capital ex-

 penditures predict future abnormal earnings beyond a knowledge of current abnormal earn-
 ings if they represent positive NPV projects.12 We decompose total current perio capital
 expenditure into environmental capital spending (ECE) and nonenvironmental spending
 (NECE). The interaction between ECE and POLLUTE tests whether, as suggested by theory,
 investors value ECE investments conditional on the firm's environmental performance. As
 a control, we add a similar interaction term between NECE and POLLUTE, however, there
 should be no significant interaction between NECE and POLLUTE unless POLLUTE is
 simply proxying for other confounding variables. Our primary empirical model is therefore:

 V = Po + P1 ABV + P2 ECE + P3 ECE*POLLUTE + 1 NECE

 + p5 NECE*POLLUTE + 36 AE + 7 *POLLUTE + v (2)

 where:

 ABV = adjusted book value of common equity equal to book value of common equity
 (BV) minus current period capital expenditure (ECE + NECE), in million dollars;

 ECE = current period (undepreciated) environmental capital expenditure, in million

 dollars;'3

 NECE = current period (undepreciated) nonenvironmental capital expenditure, in million

 dollars;

 v = error term; and

 all remaining termsr are as previously defined.

 In terms of this model, our coefficient tests are as follows:

 P2 > 0 (a test of H1)
 132 + 13 = 0 (a test of H2)
 17 < 0 (a test of H3)

 In Equation (2), 2 represents the valuation coefficient on a dollar of ECE investment

 for low-polluting firms, which is predicted to exceed 0 by HI; furthermore, 12 + 3 rep-
 resents the valuation coefficient on a dollar of ECE investment for high-polluting firms,
 which is predicted to be 0 by H2. Finally, 17 tests whether high-polluting firms have
 unbooked environmental liabilities as predicted by H3. An additional coefficient test is as
 follows:

 12> 1.

 12 Feltham and Ohlson (1996) provide theoretical support for the notion that current capital spending can explain

 goodwill beyond current abnormal earnings. Their accounting-based valuation model implies that the valuation
 coefficient on current capital investment isolated from book value is 0 if there is no incremental cash return
 (see Feltham and Ohlson 1996, 213). We prefer, for the sake of simplicity, to state our primary econometric
 equation in terms of Ohlson (1995).

 13 We discuss issues related to depreciation of current period ECE and NECE and cumulative ECE in the "Ro-

 bustness Checks" subsection.

 Market Valuation of Environmental Capital Expenditures

 Absent measurement error in our environmental performance proxies, ECE investments
 should have a valuation coefficient that exceeds unity in our empirical valuation model, for
 low-polluting firms. Since measurement error typically biases slope coefficients toward 0,
 we prefer to report coefficient tests for 32 against the benchmark of both 0 and unity. In
 order to consider the sensitivity of our results to the unscaled form of our primary econo-
 metric model (Equation (2)), we repeat the analysis after scaling all items (other than
 POLLUTE) by the number of common shares outstanding (Barth and Clinch 2001).

 IV. SAMPLE DATA

 Our sample consists of U.S. pulp and paper companies for which environmental per-

 formance, stock price, and disclosed environmental capital expenditure (ECE) data are
 available during the period 1989-2000. A joint search of Lockwood-Post's Directory of
 Pulp and Paper and Allied Trades (1996) and the Compact Disclosure USA database gen-
 erates 45 public companies listed in the U.S. with pulp and paper mills.14 By examining
 10-Ks, we eliminated 16 of the 45 firms that have only limited operations in the pulp and
 paper sectors, resulting in our final sample of 29 "pure play" pulp and paper companies.
 These companies disclosed ECE spending sometime during the 1989-2000 period, yielding
 a sample of 256 firm-year ECE disclosures.15 The total ECE spending by these companies
 over the sample period is $8.71 billion, which represents about 81 percent of the total
 industry ECE spending, according to the industry survey (referred to earlier).16 This gives
 us reasonable confidence that our sample is representative of the industry. TRI data are
 available for each of the 256 firm-years but BOD data are only available for 183 firm-years.

 Panel A of Table 1 presents distributional statistics for variables in our regression

 models. The sample is broadly distributed along all dimensions. The average annual ECE
 of our sample firms during the 1989 to 2000 period is $34.39 million with annual
 ECE spending ranging from $0.15 million to $190 million. Similarly, the average annual
 NECE is $318.6 million with annual NECE ranging from $0.3 million to $1.39 billion. The
 mean ECE is 9.77 percent of the mean total capital expenditure (ECE + NECE) over the
 sample period. In terms of environmental performance, the average annual EPTRI measure
 is 2.039 (i.e., 2.039 pounds of toxic release per $1,000 of cost of goods sold) and the
 average annual EPBOD measure is 0.449 (i.e., 44.9 percent of limit). The annual EPTRI
 measures range from a low of 0.019 to a high of 14.210 while the EPBOD measures range
 from 0.068 to 1.021.17 For both measures, lower values represent better environmental
 performance. Panel B of Table 1 presents a Pearson correlation matrix after scaling all
 variables we use in regression models, other than EPTRI and EPBOD by common shares

 14 We use the 1996 Lockwood-Post Directory in order to generate as large a sample as possible. The pulp and

 paper industry has gone through some significant consolidations in the late 1990s.

 15 There are only 13 firm-years for which firms were in operation but failed to disclose ECE spending in either

 their annual report or 10-K. Since there is no indication whether the nondisclosure arises because the firms did
 not make ECE expenditures or because they decided not to make the required disclosure, we treat these 13
 observations two ways. Our primary analysis treats these 13 observations as missing observations. Alternatively,
 when we treat these 13 observations as indicating no environmental capital expenditures, the conclusions are
 unaffected.

 16 The survey indicates that the total industry ECE over the same period is about $10.765 billion. The primary

 reason that the total ECE spending of our sample firms is less than 100 percent of the total reported ECE
 spending by the pulp and paper industry is that we restrict our sample to "pure play" public companies, whereas
 the survey includes ECE spending by private as well as public firms with operations in the industry.

 17 A review of the BOD data indicates that this particular sample firm had a very large BOD emission in July

 1990 that far exceeded the discharge limit. The company was back in compliance in 1991 with an EPBOD measure
 of 0.706. Nonetheless, this EPBOD measure is still significant higher than the average EPBOD of 0.523 for our
 sample firms in 1991.

 outstanding. The overlap among the independent variables is modest, with no pair-wise
 correlation exceeding 0.5.18

 Panel C of Table 1 presents descriptive statistics when we classify the sample firms as
 low-polluting and high-polluting firms. We present the descriptive statistics for two sub-
 periods, 1989-1994 (corresponding to cyclical downturn years) and 1995-2000 (corre-
 sponding to recovery years) as well as for the overall sample period. For the overall period,
 the median EPTRI for high-polluting firms is 2.18 pounds per thousand dollars of cost of
 goods sold, versus a corresponding metric of 0.947 for low-polluting firms. The median
 EPBOD measure is 46.2 percent of permit limits, compared to 39.7 percent, for high- versus
 low-polluting firms.

 Further, when dollar ECE is scaled by cost of goods sold, low-polluting firms spend

 less on ECE than their high-polluting rivals: for the 1989-2000 period, annual ECE for
 high-polluting firms averaged 6.5 percent of cost of goods sold (CGS), compared to 3.7
 percent for low-polluting firms. For the years 1999 and 2000, when most of the ECE
 spending in response to the "Cluster Rule" occurred, the (untabulated) median ECEICGS
 of high-polluting firms more than doubled in 1999 relative to 1998 from 2.10 percent to
 4.48 percent, and then increased by a further 50 percent in 2000 relative to 1999 to 6.87
 percent (more than triple the 1998 level). In contrast, the median (untabulated) ECEICGS
 for low-polluting firms declined in both years to historical lows (the figures are 1.50 percent
 in 1998, 1.44 percent in 1999, and 1.40 percent in 2000). Thus, it seems that low-polluting
 firms force up the ECE spending of their rivals as environmental regulations change, while
 at the same time continuing to spend in anticipation of the next round of regulatory change.
 This pattern is consistent with cost raising argument of Salop and Scheffman (1987) out-
 lined in Section II.

 Focusing on the overall period suggests that low-polluting firms are larger (p = 0.007

 for market capitalization and 0.029 for book value of common equity adjusted for current
 period capital expenditures, ABV). These differences are statistically significant in the
 1995-2000 subperiod, but not in the 1989-1994 subperiod. The trends involving profita-
 bility (AE) are of particular interest. For the 1989-1994 period, median abnormal earnings
 are negative, reflecting a cyclical downturn facing the industry, and the difference in prof-
 itability across the two groups is not significant. For the 1995-2000 period, low-polluting
 firms are more profitable and more liquid, consistent with benefits to overcompliance sug-
 gested by theory. In addition, low-polluting firms have higher financial leverage. We discuss
 the implications for our primary inferences of the differences in firm characteristics (size,
 leverage, profitability, and liquidity) across low- and high-polluting firms in the "Robustness
 Checks" subsection of the paper.

 The year-by-year EPTRI and EPBoD data (untabulated) demonstrates that on average, the

 environmental performance of our sample firms is improving over the sample period,
 consistent with continuous ECE spending over time. For instance, the mean EPTRI changes
 from 3.777 in 1989 to 1.644 in 2000. Similarly, we see a significant improvement in the
 mean EPBOD from 0.568 in 1989 to 0.376 in 2000. This implies that we must assess the
 relative environmental performance of our sample firms year by year. As discussed in
 Section III, we create an indicator variable for environmental performance by partitioning
 our sample firms into low- and high-polluting groups based on the median EPTRI (EPBOD)
 measure. It turns out that this partitioning is quite stable over the 12-year study period: the
 average rank correlations for adjacent years are 0.868 and 0.798 for the EPTR and EPBOD

 18 The Spearman rank correlations (untabulated) are very similar to those reported in Table 1.

 measures, respectively. Using EPTRI partitioning, we find only three instances in which firms
 changed group during the 12 years, with two firms moving from the high-polluting to the
 low-polluting group (one in 1991 and one 1992) and one moving from the low-polluting
 group to the high-polluting group (in 1991). One possible reason why we do not see
 significant variation in group membership is that it is difficult for a high-polluting firm to
 catch up in a short period of time. High-polluting firms must spend considerable resources
 to improve EP measures for all their mills in order to improve firm-wide environmental
 performance. In addition, as indicated by Panel C of Table 1, low-polluting firms continue
 to spend to maintain their superior environmental performance status, making it more dif-
 ficult for high-polluting firms to catch up.

 V. RESULTS

 In order to test our hypotheses, we initially run the valuation model (Equation (2)) on

 the pooled sample of firm-year observations using a pooled GLS technique. In a cross-
 sectional time-series sample such as ours, the OLS assumption that all observations are
 independent can lead to misspecificorrelation due to serial coelation of the error terms for
 observations from the same company. The pooled GLS technique allows for cross-sectional
 heteroscedasticity and serial correlation and provides a better specification by using within-
 company correlation coefficients as estimates of the autoregressive parameters for each
 cross-sectional unit. The technique uses estimated autoregressive parameters to transform
 the observations and obtain more efficient estimators. Since we have unbalanced panel data,
 we apply the pooled GLS technique for unbalanced panel data as described in Baltagi
 (1995) and in Baltagi and Chang (1994). For this analysis, we run both an unscaled version
 of the model, a version scaled by common shares (Barth and Clinch 2001), and rank
 regressions.

 While GLS corrects for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, it does not correct for
 cross-sectional coelations in the residuals. Thus, given the problem of cross-sectional
 correlation inherent in a pooled cross-sectional regression (Bernard 1987), we also run
 annual regressions using OLS and report cross-temporal t-statistics for the average coeffi-
 cients. Finally, we report the results of analyses designed to address various robustness
 concerns.

 Pooled Regression Results

 Panel A of Table 2 contains GLS results for Equation (2) (unscaled and scaled) based

 on the pooled sample of 256 firm-years for which TRI data are available.19 The significance
 levels reported below the coefficients for this and subsequent tables are two-tailed, as some
 of these coefficients are not of primary research interest. For the primary coefficient tests,
 reported p-values are one-tailed whenever we have directional predictions. Results are con-
 sistent with all three hypotheses. Regarding HI, the estimated coefficient on ECE (32) is
 2.706, reliably exceeding both zero (p = 0.006) and unity (p = 0.057). Thus, the market
 positively values ECE investment for low-polluting firms, as predicted by HI. Turning next
 to H2, the valuation multiple attached to a dollar of current period ECE for high-polluting
 firms (p2 + P3) is 0.479 (2.706-2.227), an estimate which is as predicted statistically

 19 As previously discussed, the EPTRI measure is remarkably stable over the 12-year study period, with only three
 firms changing partition. To address potential concerns regarding the effect these three firms might have on the
 results, we initially repeat the analysis after dropping them from the sample, finding the results to be qualitatively
 unaffected. In addition, we repeat the analysis after measuring POLLUTE with two-year lagged EPTR, given
 there is a two-year reporting lag between filing and publication of TRI data. Consistent with the stability of
 partition membership, our results remain unchanged.

 insignificant from 0 (p = 0.354). In regard to H3, the negative and significant (p = 0.003)
 estimate of 7 implies that, on average, the market assesses the existence of unbooked
 liabilities for high-polluting firms, as predicted by H3. The coefficient estimate of -560.441
 implies an average unbooked liability of $560.441 million for high-polluting firms, or 16.6
 percent of market capitalization. The average estimates of unbooked environmental liabil-
 ities are 28.6 percent and 16.3 percent of market capitalization, respectively, in Barth and
 McNichols (1994) and Hughes (2000). The results for the scaled model, reported in Panel
 A of Table 2, are consistent with the unscaled analysis. Specifically, all four coefficients
 tests are consistent with the predictions of H1-H3.20

 Given the potential for measurement error for our choice of EP measures, we establish

 that our results are qualitatively similar using an alternate POLLUTE indicator variable
 based on EPBO.21 Panel B of Table 2 reports the analysis for the full model (Equation (2),
 unscaled and scaled) based on a pooled sample of 183 firm-years with ECE and BOD data
 using GLS. All coefficient tests are consistent with the predictions of H1-H3, for both the
 unscaled and scaled models. Specifically, the market positively values ECE investment for
 low- but not high-polluting firms, and assesses the existence of unbooked liabilities for
 high-polluting firms.

 As a control, Panels A and B of Table 2 report the results of tests of an interaction

 between NECE and POLLUTE. For the unscaled model where POLLUTE is based on EPRI,
 Panel A indicates that for low-polluting firms the estimated coefficient on a dollar of NECE
 is 3.439 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the estimated coefficient on the interaction between
 NECE and POLLUTE is insignificantly different from zero (p = 0.372, two-tailed). Thus,
 we infer that POLLUTE is not simply proxying for other confounding variables, as low-
 and high-polluting firms experience the same multiplier on a dollar of NECE.

 As a further control for the choice of deflator, we estimate model (2) in ranks and
 report the results in Table 2, Panel C. Specifically, we rank each variable except POLLUTE
 (i.e., V, ABV, NECE, ECE, and AE) from smallest to largest within each year and then scale
 it to fit between 0 and 1 by dividing by the number of firm-year observations for the given
 year. For example, for the 27 firms with observations in 1994, the firms are first sorted by
 V within that year, ranked from 1 to 27 and then the rankings divided by 27 giving values
 between 1/27 = 0.037 (smallest) and 27/27 = 1.000 (largest). We follow an analogous
 procedure for each of the other variables. POLLUTE remains a (0,1) variable as described
 in Section III, based alternatively on toxic release inventory (EPTRI) and biological oxygen
 demand (EPBoD). The results for the three primary coefficient tests remain the same. The
 coefficient test (132 >1) is not meaningful in rank regressions.

 Annual Regression Results

 Table 3 presents mean coefficient values re-estimating the valuation model (equation

 (2)) using OLS for each of the twelve years of our sample period (1989-2000) and then

 20 Our inferences are unchanged when we repeat the analysis reported in Panel A of Table 2 after scaling all items

 (other than POLLUTE) in Equation (2) by the book value of equity as opposed to the number of common shares
 outstanding. Details are available from the authors upon request.

 21 As Barth and McNichols (1994) point out, the bias in estimated slope coefficients depends on the measurement

 error in included variables and the correlation between that measurement error and relevant omitted variables.
 Since the correlation structure and the omitted variables are unknown, we adopt the simple strategy of an alternate
 EP measure. We view EPBOD as an instrumental variable correlated with EPTRI but uncorrelated with the mea-
 surement error in EPTRI (for support, see Greene 2000, 370). If the estimated slope coefficients are similar with
 an alternate EP measure, this makes a stronger case that such results are not driven by bias due to measurement
 error.

 The analyses are based on the 256 firm-years with ECE and TRI data (1989 (16), 1990 (21), 1991 (24), 1992 (24), 1993 (28), 1994 (27), 1995 (24), 1996 (20), 1997

 b The Abarbenell/Bernard t-statistic adjusts for the estimated first-order autocorrelation in the independent variables over the sample period by adjusting standard errors

 using the following factor: {[( l+p)/(l - (p)] - [2p(1 - pp")/n(l - (p)2]}1/2 where n is the number of years and up is the estimated first-order autocorrelation in the
 yearly coefficients (Abarbanell and Bernard 2000).

 expenditures (in $millions), respectively; AE is the firm's abnormal earnings (in $millions) defined as earnings to common equity less an assumed cost of capital based
 on the CAPM times the book value of common equity; and POLLUTE is the firm's relative environmental performance propensity measure set equal to 0 for firm-

 averaging across the years. We determine annual t-statistics based on White's (1984) con-
 sistent covariance matrix. The average coefficient values are similar to those for the pooled
 analysis presented in Panel A of Table 2. The estimated ECE coefficient (32) is positive in
 11 of the 12 years with It-statisticsl > 1.65 in ten of the 12 years, the ECE*POLLUTE
 interaction term coefficients are negative in 11 years with It-statisticsl > 1.65 in nine years,
 and the estimates of 37 are negative in ten years with It-statisticsl > 1.65 in nine years.

 In order to test for the statistical significance of the mean coefficients, we consider

 several approaches. Following Abarbanell and Bernard (2000), we calculate the standard
 error from the distribution of yearly coefficients and then make an adjustment for serial
 correlation in the coefficients.22 To supplement this measure, we also calculate the two Z-
 statistics (Z, and Z2) employed by Aboody and Lev (1998) and Healy et al. (1987).23 For
 the primary coefficient tests, reported p-values are one-tailed whenever we have directional
 predictions.

 Once again, all four primary coefficient tests are consistent with the predictions of H1-

 H3. Regarding HI, the mean coefficient on ECE for low-polluting firms (r2) is 2.249,
 reliably exceeding both 0 and unity for the Abarbenell and Bernard t-stat and the Z1 and
 Z2 statistics (p ? 0.017). Turning next to H2, the estimate of 12 + P3 for high-polluting
 firms is 0.337 (2.249-1.912), an estimate which is statistically insignificant from 0 (p
 = 0.488, 0.226, and 0.412 for the Abarbenell and Bernard t-statistic, Z1 and Z2, respec-
 tively). In regard to H3, the negative and significant estimate of 17, -468.511, is reliably
 less than 0 (p c 0.005 for the Abarbenell and Bernard t-statistic, Z1 and Z2) and suggests
 that unbooked environmental liabilities exist for high-polluting firms. Thus, the results from
 the annual regressions reinforce conclusions drawn from the pooled regressions.

 Robustness Checks

 We perform a number of sensitivity analyses to ensure that our main results are robust

 and not subject to model misspecification and measurement error. Possible causes of con-
 cern for model misspecification include potential confounds due to omitted variables, the
 impact of observations with negative abnormal earnings, and the use of a dichotomous
 POLLUTE proxy for relative environmental performance. In order to further address po-
 tential measurement error, we also examine the impact of cumulative ECE to incorporate
 difference in firm depreciation policy. We discuss each robustness check below.

 Potential Confounds

 As indicated in Section IV, low- and high-polluting firms differ in their firm character-

 istics (leverage and size for the overall 1989-2000 period: leverage, liquidity, profitability,
 and size, for the 1995-2000 subperiod), and the differences represent potential confounds
 to our main empirical analysis. The pooled and annual analyses presented above show that
 our results are unlikely to have been driven by factors other than environmental perform-
 ance. Specifically, it is unlikely that differences between low- and high-polluting firms
 would be reflected in the ECE-related coefficients but not the NECE-related coefficients if,

 22 The Abarbenell/Bernard t-statistic adjusts for the estimated first-order autocorrelation in the independent vari-
 ables over the sample period by adjusting standard errors using the following factor: {[(1 + yp)/(l - p)]
 - [2yp(l - (p")/n(l - (p)2]}1/2 where n is the number of years and (p is the estimated first-order autocorrelation
 in the yearly coefficients. As noted by Abarbanell and Bernard, this adjustment factor assumes that the serial
 correlation is first-order autoregressive.

 23 The Z, statistic, which assumes residual independence, is (1/n /2) ,=t (til/k,/k, - 21'/2) where ti is the White's

 t-statistic for year n, k, are the degrees of freedom, and n is the number of years (12). The Z2 statistic is: mean
 t-statistic/(standard deviation of t-statistics/ {n - 1 } /2). See White (1984) for further support.

 in fact, POLLUTE simply represents an omitted confounding variable. We present additional
 evidence regarding the role of potential confounds by modifying Equation (2) to allow all
 model coefficients to vary across the environmental performance subsets:

 V = mo + -iABV + lq2ECE + 'q3NECE + x4AE + lsPOLLUTE

 + T16ABV*POLLUTE + 197 ECE*POLLUTE + 18 NECE*POLLUTE
 + 119 AE*POLLUTE + rT (3)

 where all terms are previously defined.

 The results of this analysis, reported in Table 4, are consistent with the results from
 preceding analyses on the four primary coefficient tests. Specifically, the coefficient on ECE
 for low-polluting firms is positive and reliably exceeds both 0 (p = 0.012) and unity (p
 = 0.095); the coefficient on ECE for high-polluting firms (12 + 17) is statistically indistin-
 guishable from 0 (p = 0.424); and the estimate of lq5 is reliably less than 0 (p = 0.007).
 However, of more immediate interest, with the exception of ECE*POLLUTE, none of the
 interaction terms are significant. The p-values on ABV*POLLUTE, NECE*POLLUTE, and

 AE*POLLUTE estimates are 0.394, 0.490, and 0.303, respectively. Further, the results of
 F-tests (untabulated) reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for the high-polluting
 group are equal to 0 for all but ECE. Thus, the only estimated coefficient that differs
 between the low- and high-polluting groups is that on ECE, which reinforces the argument
 that it is unlikely our results are being driven by omitted variables correlated with
 POLLUTE.24

 Assessing the Impact of Negative Abnormal Earnings

 Given the large number of firm-year observations with negative abnormal earnings, we

 modify Equation (2) to allow for different coefficients for firm-years with negative abnormal
 earnings. Since persistence may differ across negative and positive abnormal earnings, re-
 stricting the coefficient to be the same across the two groups potentially results in model
 misspecification. Panel A of Table 5 reports the results for Equation (2) for the 105 firm-
 years when AE is positive. Three of the four coefficient tests are consistent with the pre-
 diction of H1-H3. In Panel B of Table 5, for the 151 firm-years when AE is negative, three
 of the four coefficient tests again are consistent with the predictions of H1-H3, but the
 results re garding H are mixed. Specifically, the coefficient on ECE, 1.729, reliably exceeds
 0 (p = 0.025) but does not reliably exceed unity (p = 0.203). Nonetheless, our results lead
 us to conclude that the main inferences regarding of Hi-H3 are not driven by this potential
 source of model misspecification.25

 Using a Continuous Measure to Capture Relative Environmental Performance

 We repeat the estimation of Equation (2) using a continuous measure, EPTR, instead

 of a dummy variable, POLLUTE, to capture relative environmental performance. A contin-
 uous EP measure implies that low-polluting firms also have unbooked environmental lia-
 bilities. This is inconsistent with theory and intuition. Nonetheless, our results (untabulated)
 are qualitatively equivalent to those reported in Panel A of Table 2 when POLLUTE is
 replaced with a continuous measure, EPTR, in Equation (2). Specifically, all four coefficient
 tests again are consistent with the predictions of H1-H3.

 Depreciation and Cumulative ECE

 The analysis presented above implicitly assumes that 100 percent of current period
 capital expenditures are included in book value of common equity at year-end. Clearly,
 however, the firm will depreciate these expenditures over the useful life of the project,
 including an appropriate portion in the year of outlay. In addition, the analysis does not
 isolate the undepreciated ECE from previous years that is also part of year-end book value.
 Ideally, we would like to base our analysis on only the undepreciated current period ECE
 plus book value of prior years' undepreciated ECE.

 Unfortunately, our sample firms do not disclose a separate depreciation schedule for

 ECE or a separate account for undepreciated ECE. To address these issues, we estimate a
 year-by-year depreciation rate for each of our sample firms based on the reported gross and
 net capital asset account balances, assuming that net increases occur at the midpoint of the
 year. Although an average of the rates that the firm applies to various assets is unlikely to

 24 As a further check for potential confounds, we repeat the estimation of Equation (2) by employing a fixed-

 effects model allowing the intercept to vary by firm, and second including the firm characteristics Leverage,
 Asset Age, and Liquidity as additional variables. Both of these approaches yield results almost identical to those
 reported in Panel A of Table 2.

 25 Our main inferences are also unaffected when we separately estimate Equation (2) for the two subperiods, 1989-

 1994 and 1995-2000, referred to in Panel C of Table 1.

 be appropriate for any specific class of assets, this estimate appears to be the best available
 given the limited disclosures.

 First, we repeat the analysis after applying the estimated depreciation rates to both
 current period ECE and NECE. The pooled GLS results for Equation (2), with ECE and
 NECE now measured as the estimated undepreciated current period ECE and NECE, and
 ABV measured as book value of common equity net of undepreciated current period ECE
 and NECE (untabulated), indicate that our conclusions are robust to this adjustment. We
 find that the coefficient on ECE for low-polluting firms reliably exceeds 0 (p = 0.022) and
 unity (p = 0.065), while the coefficient on ECE for high-polluting firms is not statistically
 distinguishable from 0 (p = 0.305). In addition, the negative and significant estimate of f7
 is reliably less than 0 (p < 0.001). Thus, these results are consistent with the predictions
 of H1-H3.

 Second, for the 15 firms with complete ECE data for the eight-year period (1992-
 1999), we determine the balance of cumulative undepreciated ECE made from 1992 up
 until the end of each of 1997, 1998, and 1999, based on the estimated depreciation rates.
 We then pool the 1997-1999 data (45 firm-years) and estimate the pooled GLS model
 (Equation (2)) with the ECE variable measured as the estimated cumulative undepreciated
 ECE in book value at the end of each of the relevant years. ABV is measured as book value
 of common equity at year-end net of the estimated cumulative undepreciated ECE balance
 and the undepreciated current period NECE. Again, the results (untabulated) are consistent
 with the previous analysis and are consistent with the predictions of H1-H3. Specifically,
 we find that the coefficient on ECE for low-polluting firms reliably exceeds 0 (p = 0.001)
 and unity (p = 0.022), while the coefficient on ECE for high-polluting firms is not statis-
 tically distinguishable from 0 (p = 0.249). We also find the estimate of P is negative and
 reliably less than 0 (p = 0.003).

 Pooling across years, the weighted average annual depreciation rates are 7.8 percent
 and 7.2 percent for low- and high-polluting firms, respectively. The difference is statistically
 indistinguishable from 0 (Mann-Whitey p = 0.559). This finding, together with the above
 sensitivity analyses, allows us to conclude that measurement error with respect to depre-
 ciation and cumulative ECE is not driving our results.

 VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

 The objective of this study is to examine the market valuation of environmental capital
 expenditure investment related to pollution abatement in the pulp and paper industry. Our
 total sample ECE spending of $8.7 billion during 1989-2000 supports the focus on this
 industry. In order to be capitalized, an asset should be associated with future economic
 benefits. The existing environmental literature suggests that investors condition their eval-
 uation of the future economic benefits arising from ECE on an assessment of the firms'
 environmental performance. This literature predicts the emergence of two environmental
 stereotypes: low-polluting firms that overcomply with existing environmental regulations,
 and minimal compliance high-polluting firms. Using the median emission data to partition
 firms, our valuation evidence indicates that there are incremental economic benefits asso-
 ciated with ECE investment by low- but not high-polluting firms. This finding may be
 useful to the FASB if they reconsider the issue of whether to capitalize ECE.

 We also find that investors use environmental performance information to assess un-
 booked environmental liabilities, which we interpret to represent the future abatement
 spending obligations of high-polluting firms in the pulp and paper industry. We estimate
 average unbooked liabilities of $560 million for high-polluting firms, or 16.6 percent of
 market capitalization. These estimates are consistent with the corresponding estimates of

 28.8 percent and 16.3 percent of market capitalization, made by Barth and McNichols
 (1994) and Hughes (2000), respectively, for the industries which they examine. These find-
 ings are beneficial to SEC enforcement staff, because they indicate which types of firms
 face unfavorable capital spending obligations arising from impending environmental leg-
 islation. Finally, our methodology for reliably ranking pulp and paper firms in terms of
 environmental performance measures suggests that such performance measures are suitable
 for audit, which is of interest to providers of assurance of firm environmental reports.

 We stress several limitations regarding our study. First, we provide indirect capital
 market evidence of the claimed benefits to voluntary environmental overcompliance, sug-
 gested by theory and by practitioners. We demonstrate greater profitability of low-polluting
 relative to high-polluting firms in the later years (1995-2000) of our sample. However, we
 leave it to future research to conclusively demonstrate more direct evidence and to discrim-
 inate between the various theories of overcompliance. Second, while our results are robust
 to a variety of robustness checks, the reader should be aware of the potential for measure-
 ment error in our proxies. For example, we could only approximate the depreciation rate
 that our sample firms used for our current and cumulative ECE. Third, a maintained but
 not directly tested assumption is that the label "low polluting" captures a deliberate strategic
 choice on the part of such firms to benefit from overcompliance as suggested by economic
 theory. While we find this assumption plausible given the regulatory setting, whereby low-
 polluting firms dictate the environmental spending of high-polluting firms, and have at-
 tempted to eliminate plausible rival explanations, we do not test this assumption explicitly.
 Fourth, any self-selection bias not controlled for in our tests potentially confounds infer-
 ences. The fact that the high-polluting dummy variable interacts as predicted with environ-
 mental capital expenditures, but is insignificant when interacted with nonenvironmental
 capital expenditures, leads us to conclude that correlated omitted variables are not driving
 our results. This adds credence to our measure of latent environmental liabilities estimated
 with this categorical variable. Finally, our results are confined to a single industry. A useful
 avenue for future research would be to explore whether our ECE findings generalize to
 other industries.
