Testing the relationship of locus of control to

different  performance  dimensions

Philadelphia, PA 19122,  USA

Using a sample of 146 bank tellers, this study  tested  the usefulness  of locus of control
for  explaining  initiative  versus  compliant  performance.  Based  upon  Spector's  (1982)
conceptual work, locus of control showed a negative relationship to initiative perform-
ance and a positive relationship to compliant performance. However, these results were
only found using Spector's (1988) work locus of control measure and not with the Rotter
(1966) measure. Spector's work locus of control measure also explained significant  per-
formance  variance  beyond  controlled  for  individual  and  situational  variables.
Limitations of the study and suggestions for future  research are discussed.

Major  reviews  of  personality—performance 
relationships  (Guion  &  Gottier,  1965;
HoUenbeck  & Whitener,  1988;  Weiss  & Adler,  1984)  have  noted  the general  lack of
significant  results. A recent  review of the personnel selection  literature (Guion & Gibson,
1988)  found  that  ability  tests  consistently  do a better  job of predicting  individual  per-
formance  than  motivational  and  personality  tests. Given  such  disappointing  results, dif-
ferent  'responses' have emerged as to how to increase the relationship between  personality
traits and  individual  performance.

One  'response'  has  been  to increase  the behaviour  or work  'specificity'  of personality
measures  (e.g.  Bem & Funder,  1978;  Buss  & Craik,  1985;  Day & Silverman, 1989;
Gough,  1985; Guion  & Gottier,  1965; Hogan, Hogan  & Busch,  1984; Schneider,  1987).
The results have shown stronger relationships  between work-specific  (versus general) per-
sonality  measures and  performance  outcomes (e.g. Day & Silverman,  1989; Hogan  et al.,
1984). Using  work-specific  measures applies Fisher's (1980) argument  for increasing  our
understanding  of job performance  by relating specific  measures to specific  job behaviours.
A  full  application  of Fisher's  (1980)  argument  for testing  personality—performance
relationships  means  that  researchers  need  to consider  the 'fit' between  personality  mea-
sures  and performance  outcomes  to obtain  maximum  predictability.  Previous  person-
ality—performance  research  has often  neglected  this  'fit'  issue  (Weiss  & Adler,  1984).
Using  a  well-known  personality  trait,  locus  of control  (Rotter,  1966,  1990;  Spector,
1982), this paper will investigate the relationship of two locus of control  measures to dif-
ferent  performance  dimensions.

The performance  criterion

Many  years  ago  industrial  psychologists  (e.g.  Dunnette,  1963; Ghiselli,  1956)  pointed
out  that  multiple performance  measures are needed  to more accurately operationalize  the
performance  criterion.  One  aspect  of  the  performance  criterion  to  consider  involves
whether  particular  dimensions  of performance  reflect  'given-role  requirements'  i.e.  pre-
scribed  or compliant  behaviour, or 'innovative and  spontaneous  behaviour',  which  is per-
formance  beyond  immediate  role  requirements  (Katz,  1964;  Katz  &  Kahn,  1978).
According  to Katz  (1964), innovative  and  spontaneous  behaviour  often  goes  beyond  the
formal  requirements ofa  job and such behaviour is essential to organizational survival and
effectiveness.

One  category  of  innovative  and  spontaneous  behaviour  is  self-training  (Katz,  1964;
Katz  & Kahn,  1978).  Self-training  examines  the  degree  to  which  members  spend  time
and  energy  mastering  knowledge  and  skills either  for  doing  their  own  jobs  better  or  for
preparing  to advance in the organization. Katz (1964) notes that  there may or may not  be
a  requirement  that  employees  self-train,  but  that  such  a performance  dimension  is more
voluntary  or initiative-based  as opposed  to  compliant.

This  study  will  extend  research  on  the  performance  criterion  by  measuring  initiative
and  compliant  dimensions.  'Initiative'  means  that  the  employee  is  performing  beyond
basic  job  requirements,  while  'compliant'  represents  performance  prescribed  by  job
requirements. Katz & Kahn (1978) have noted the need to study both types of behaviours.
It  is expected  that  locus of control will exhibit  a different  relationship  to initiative  versus
compliant  performance.

Locus of control  and  performance

A number of field studies have investigated  the relationship  between  locus of control  and
job  performance.  Mixed  results  have  been  found.  Some  studies  (e.g.  Broedling,  1975;
Hersch & Scheibe,  1967; Majumder,  MacDonald  & Greever,  1977) have found  that  inter-
nals  perform  better  than  externals,  while  other  studies  either  report  no  relationship
between  locus  of  control  and  performance  (e.g. Johnson,  Luthans  &  Hennessey,  1984;
Szilagyi, Sims & Keller,  1976) or that externals perform  better (e.g. Brownell,  1981). One
study  (Tseng,  1970) found  that  internals  were rated  higher  than  externals  by their  train-
ing  instructors  on  some performance  aspects (e.g. work  tolerance, work  knowledge),  but
not on others (e.g. motivation, work skills).

The  Tseng  (1970)  study  illustrates  that  one  issue  affecting  the  locus  of  control-per-
formance  relationship  involves  how  job  performance  is  measured.  In  most  previous
studies (e.g.  Broedling,  1975; Hersch  & Scheibe,  1967; Johnson  et al,  1984;  Majumder
et al,  1977)  the  job performance  measure  has  been  an  ambiguously  defined  supervisory
rating.  This  ambiguity  makes  it  difficult  to  determine  whether  initiative  or  compliant
performance  was being rated. The Szilagyi etal  (1976) study used  10 separate supervisory
ratings, some appearing  to be more  initiative-based  (i.e. initiative  on  job, planning  abil-
ity) while other ratings seemed  more compliance-oriented  (i.e.  dependability,  attendance
and  punctuality).  However,  based  on  a factor  analysis  all  ratings  were  summed  into  an
overall  10-item  supervisory  rating  of  subordinate  job  performance.  This  merging  of
separate ratings could  mask potential  differences  in the  relationship  of locus of control  to
initiative versus compliant  performance.


Locus of control and job performance 

127

By using  an  appropriately  'focused'  locus of control  measure and  separating  initiative
versus  compliant  performance,  a stronger  relationship  between  locus of control  and  per-
formance  should  be  found.  All  of  the  above-mentioned  locus  of  control-performance
studies used the Rotter (1966) scale. Phares (1976) recommended  that researchers develop
more  domain-specific  locus of control  measures  than  the  Rotter  (1966)  scale  to  enhance
the predictiveness  of locus of control. The Rotter  (1966) measure  is very general  because
its items cut  across different  domains (e.g. education, work, politics, life  in general).

Spector (1988) has recently developed  a work locus of control scale. This scale contains
items which  deal with  different  issues (e.g. promotions, getting  a job, dealing  with  one's
boss, job effort)  within one domain, i.e. work. Conceptually, Spector's (1988) measure has
a stronger  'fit'  to work-related  outcomes  than  the  Rotter  (1966)  scale. Using  such  work
outcomes  as  job  satisfaction,  organizational  commitment,  role  stress  and  leadership
behaviour,  Spector  (1988)  found  his  work  locus  of  control  measure  was  significantly
related  to  these  outcomes.  Spector  (1988)  called  for  future  research  to  compare  the  pre-
dictive validity  of his scale against  other  locus of control  measures. This study  will  com-
pare  the  predictive  validity  of  Spector's  (1988)  measure  to  the  Rotter  (1966)  scale  for
initiative  and  compliant  performance.  It  is expected  that  Spector's  measure  will  show a
stronger  relationship  to initiative  and  compliant  performance  than  the Rotter  measure.

According to Spector (1982), internals look to themselves for direction, while externals
depend  on  outside  factors  such  as  their  supervisor  or  company  rules.  Concerning  the
implications  of  locus  of control  for  individual  job performance,  Spector  (1982)  predicts
that:

when tasks or organizational demands require initiative and independence of action, the internal would
be more suitable; when the requirement is for compliance, however, the external would be more appro-
priate (p. 486).

Previous  research has not  tested  this  relationship. It  is expected  that  locus of control  will
be  negatively  related  to  initiative  performance,  but  positively  related  to  compliant  per-
formance.

A  general  limitation  of previous  field  studies  investigating  the  relationship  between
locus of control and performance  is that they failed  to control for relevant correlates of per-
formance  (Rotter,  1990;  Spector,  1982).  Researchers  (e.g.  Davis-Blake  & Pfeffer,  1989)
have noted that  most personality studies are methodologically flawed because they do not
control  for  relevant  situational  and  individual  variables.

Controlling  for  other  performance  correlates

Basic models of employee  job performance  (e.g. Blumberg  & Pringle,  1982; Campbell &
Pritchard,  1976;  Cummings  &  Schwab,  1973;  Porter,  Lawler  &  Hackman,  1975)
acknowledge  that  both  individual  (e.g. ability,  length  of service,  motivation)  and  situa-
tional  (e.g.  working  conditions,  interpersonal  influences)  variables  are  important  for
explaining  one's  job  performance.  Studies  testing  situational  variables  (e.g.  O'Connor,
Peters, Pooyan, Weekly, Frank & Erenkrantz,  1984; Peters, Chassie, Lindholm,  O'Connor
& Rudolf  Kline,  1982; Peters, O'Connor  & Rudolf,  1980; Schuler,  1975; Steel & Mento,
1986) have generally  measured  these variables  through  individual  perceptions.

Although  measuring  a  person's  perception  of  the  situation  can  be  useful  (Peters  &
O'Connor,  1980)  for  explaining  his/her  performance,  'pure'  (i.e.  non-perceptual)  situa-


128

rional  measures  are also  important.  For  example,  in  their  study  of market  and  organiza-
tional  influences  on  bank  employee  outcomes.  Green,  Blank  & Liden  (1983)  used  non-
perceptual  bank  branch context  measures (e.g. market  favourability,  competition,  branch
size  and  activity).  These  contextual  measures  were  found  to  be  significantly  related  to
bank employee  attitudes.

Keepmg  such  measurement  issues  in  mind,  the purpose  of this  study  is to  investigate
further  the  relationship  of  locus  of  control  to  job  performance.  The  following  three
hypotheses  will  be  tested:

HI  Spector's  work  locus  of control  measure  has  a  stronger  relationship  to  initiative  and  compliant  per-

formance  than  the Rotter  measure.

H2  Locus of control  is positively related  to compliant  performance  but  negatively  related  to initiative  per-

formance.

H3  Locus of control  accounts  for  significant  additional  variance  in  initiative  and  compliant  performance

beyond  controlled  for  individual  and  situational  variables.

Subjects and procedure

Method

A survey was voluntarily  administered  to full-time  bank  tellers working  for a large  non-unionized  bank.  The
bank  is located  in  a major  northeast  city  in  the  US. Only  tellers  with  at  least  three  months  of job  experience
were eligible  to participate.  Tellers were asked  to give  their  name and  the  branch  where  they  worked  so  that
their survey answers could  be matched  to subsequently collected  record-based  data. To help preserve  response
confidentiality,  subjects  received  a pre-addressed  business-reply  envelope  with  their  survey  Thus,  completed
surveys  were  mailed  back  to  the  investigator.

A  total  of  174  of  the  258  surveys  sent  out  (67  per  cent)  were  voluntarily  completed  and  returned.  For
twelve  months  after  the  survey, performance  data  were  collected.  However,  over  this  12-month  time  period
the  sample  size was  reduced  from  174  to  146. Twenty-eight  (16  per  cent) subjects  left  the  bank  either  vol-
untarily or involuntarily. A demographic  breakdown  of the  146 tellers showed  that: 89 per cent  were  women;
56  per cent  were  married;  average age was  38  years; average  organizational  tenure  was six years; 80  per  cent
were Caucasian  and  20  per cent  were  minority  group  members,  broken  down  as follows  -  12 per cent  black,
4  per  cent  Hispanic  and  4  per  cent  oriental;  75  per  cent  had  a high  school  education,  16 per  cent  had  some
college  education  and  9  per  cent  had  a college  degree.  Conversations  with  bank  human  resource  personnel
indicated  that  these  sample  demographics  were  representative  of the  bank's  teller  population.  A  comparison
of  later-collected  respondent  performance  to  non-respondent  performance  showed  no significant  mean differ-
ences  in  performance.

Measures

Non-pmeptuat  situational variable. The  branch  grade variable consists of three criteria  -  transactions,  deposits
and  market  sophistication.  Each  branch  is graded  1 (declining/negative)  to  6  (extremely  high)  on  each  cri-
terion,  so that  the score range  for  the  branch  grade  variable  is 3-18.  This  information  allows  for  controlling
inter-branch differences  (e.g. customer  activity  levels in  neighbourhoods  of differing  affluence)  that  may  affect
teller performance.  Bank  management  allowed  the use of each  branch's overall branch grade score for  research
purposes. Similar to Green etal.  (1983) the value of the branch grade variable was assigned  to each teller work-
ing  at  that  branch.

Perceptually-based situational variables.  Prior  to survey development,  12 bank  tellers  were  interviewed  to  iden-
tify  important  situational  variables affecting  their work. These tellers differed  in branch  location,  tenure, per-
formance  and  other  demographics  (e.g. age, education).  A content  analysis  of  these  interviews  showed  three
situational  variables  to  be  particularly  relevant:  work  overload,  superior-subordinate  relationship  and  role
clarity  These  three situational  variables  were measured  on  the  teller survey  using  previously  tested  scales.


Locus of control and  job performance 

129

Work  overload  was  measured  using  a  four-item  scale (Caplan,  Cobb,  French,  Harrison  & Pinneau,  1975)
to assess  the  perceived  pressure  on  tellers. Superior-subordinate  relationship  was measured  by  asking  tellers
about  their  work  relationship  with  their  branch  manager.  A  five-item  scale based  on  Graen's  leader-member
exchange measure was used (Dansereau, Graen & Haga,  1975). Role clarity was measured using Lyons'  (1971)
four-item  measure.  A  five-point  response  scale was used for all  three perceptually-based  situational  variables
(1  =  strongly  disagree,  5  =  strongly  agree).

Individual  variables. The  following  individual  teller  variables  were  measured  -  ability,  locus  of  control  and
length  of service. Ability  was operationalized  through  teller  selection  test  scores on  number  and  name  com-
parison  abilities  (American  Bankers  Association,  1977). The  number  comparison  test  required  subjects  cor-
rectly  to  identify  which  strings  of  numbers  were  duplicated.  The  name  comparison  test  required  the  same
skill  dealing  with  names. Tellers were given  a  five-minute  test.  Scores for  each  test  could  range  from  0-100.
Since  the  number  and  name  comparison  abilities  were  found  to  have  a  moderately  strong  correlation
(r  =  .56), a composite  ability  measure  was  created.  The  overlap  in  these  abilities  reflects  their  emphasis  on
perceptual  speed.

Locus of control.  Two different  scales were used  to  measure  locus of control:  Rotter  (1966) and  Spector  (1988).
Rotter's  scale  is  the  most  well-known  locus  of  control  measure  (Spector,  1982).  It  consists  of  23  items
arranged  in a forced-choice  format.  For each  item  the  respondent  is asked  to choose which  of two  statements,
one  internal  (I) and  one external  (E), s/he  agrees with.  Scores are calculated  by summing  the  total  number  of
external  answers.  A sample  item  is:  lA:  'Many  of the  unhappy  things  in  people's  lives are partly  due  to  bad
luck'  (E) or  IB: 'People's  misfortunes  result  from  the mistakes  they  make' (I).

Spector's  (1988) work  locus of control  scale consists  of  16  items  to  which  subjects  respond  on  a  six-point
scale (1  =  disagree very much, 6  =  agree very much). Consistent  with  Rotter's (1966) measure higher  scores
represent  more  externality.  A sample  item  is: 'Getting  the  job you  want  is mostly  a matter  of luck'.  Spector
(1988) found  the coefficient  alpha of his scale to average  .82 across six samples. Across three samples, Spector
(1988)  found  an  average correlation  of  .54  between  his measure  and  the  Rotter  (1966) scale.

Length of service.  This was measured  by asking  subjects  the number  of years they had  worked  as a teller  for  the
bank.  Length  of  service  (experience)  has  been  linked  to  individual  performance  (e.g.  Blumberg  &  Pringle,
1982;  Schmidt,  Huntet  & Outerbridge,  1986).

Teller performance.  Three  categories  of  teller  performance  were  identified:  productivity,  dollar  shortages  and
self-development.  These categories  represent  three distinct  performance  dimensions.  Each dimension  will  be
described  and  then  discussed  as being  compliant  versus  initiative-based.

Productivity  is  based  upon  the  volume  of work,  i.e.  number  of  transactions  which  a teller  processes.  It  is
expressed  as a monthly  percentage. The corresponding  time  for  the  total  number  of transactions  processed  is
divided  by  the  number  of  hours  worked  to  determine  a  productivity  percentage.  For  example,  if  a  teller
worked  160 hours  in a month  and  120 of those hours could  be accounted  for by various transactions, then  the
monthly  productivity  percentage  would  be 75  per cent  (120/160).

Dollar  shortages  represents  the  amount  of  money  unaccounted  for  (i.e.  lost)  by  financial  transactions.  A
monthly  dollar  shortages  measure  was calculated  for each  teller as part  of the  bank's  standard  operating  pro-
cedure. Thus productivity  and  dollar shortages are quantitative  measures.

Self-development  represents  a  more  qualitative  performance  dimension  and  seems  equivalent  to  Katz's
(1964) self-training  concept. The branch service manager rates each teller's self-development  on a yearly basis.
Self-development  is measured  using  eight  items  which  involve  various  branch  service  skills  (e.g.  automated
teller  work,  running  a drive-through  window, auditing  procedures)  on a  five-point  scale (1  =  unsatisfactory,
5  =  superior).  Factor  analysis  of these  eight  items  showed  that  all  items  loaded  strongly  on  one  factor,  self-
development.

Performance  data  were collected  on  subjects  for  12 months  following  the  survey. Overall  per  cent  average
was used  for  productivity  and  a yearly  total  was used  for  dollar  shortages. Coefficient  alphas  were  calculated
for  productivity  and  dollar shortages  by  using  each  monthly  productivity  and  dollar shortages  measure as an
item. There is a precedent  for using  this procedure (e.g. Adler & Golan,  1981). Coefficient  alpha was also cal-
culated  for  the self-development  measure.

Conceptually  it  is argued  that  productivity  and  dollar  shortages  represent  compliant  performance,  while
self-development  represents  initiative  performance.  Compliant  performance  is role-required  (i.e.  less  volun-
tary), while  initiative  performance  is beyond  one's immediate  role (i.e. more voluntary)  (Katz,  1964).  Dollar
shortages and productivity  represent  the key activities of the teller's job. The teller selection and  training  pro-
cesses are  heavily  orientated  towards  making  sure  that  tellers  learn  how  to  handle  money  quickly  and  accu-
rately  and  process  customer  financial  transactions.  However,  very  little  formal  selection  and  training  is
orientated  toward  self-development.

Once  assigned  to  a particular  branch,  it  is  ultimately  up  to  each  teller  to  master  new  job  behaviours.  In
order  to check  if tellers  perceived  that  they  were given  opportunities  to  learn  new  job  behaviours  they  were
asked  to respond (1  =  disagree very much, 6  =  agree very much) to the item  'I feel that I am given  the oppor-
tunity  to  learn  new  job  behaviours  at  my  branch'.  Mean  response  to  this  question  was 4.23. This  indicates
that  most  tellers  felt  that  chances for  self-training  were  provided.

As  a  means  of  verifying  the  compliant  versus  initiative  distinction  in  performance  dimensions,  assistant
branch  service  managers  in  each  of  the  bank's  G6 branches  were  used  as  independent  judges.  Each  assistant
manager  was asked  to  'think  about  the  three  teller performance  dimensions  of productivity,  dollar  shortages
and self-development  and  rate the degree to which each dimension  goes beyond  the basic job requirements of
teller  work,  where  1 =  does  not  go  beyond  job  requirements;  2  =  goes  a  little  beyond  job  requirements;
3  =  goes somewhat beyond  job requirements; and 4  =  goes a great deal beyond  job requirements'. Using  this
four-point  scale  the  following  means  and  standard  deviations  were  found:  productivity,  1.29  and  .54; dollar
shortages,  1.18  and 
.42;  and  self-development,  3.11  and  .86.  Self-development  was  found  to  have  a
significantly  higher  mean  (p  <  .05) than  either  productivity  or dollar  shortages.

Methodological controls.  Potential  social  desirability  response set  and  frame  of  reference  (i.e. demographics  affect-
ing  perceptions)  biases (Arnold,  Eeldman  & Purbhoo,  1985; O'Reilly,  Parlette  & Bloom,  1980)  were  tested.
Social desirability  was measured  using  the  33-item  Crowne & Marlowe (1964) scale.

Results

Descriptive  statistics, reliabilities  and  intercorrelations  among  study  variables are shown
in Table  1. The self-report  multi-item  variables and performance  measures have adequate
(.70 or greater) coefficient  alphas (Nunnally,  1978). There were no significant  correlations
between social desirability and the other study variables. Also, no significant  relationships
between demographic  variables (i.e. age, gender,  race, education, marital  status) and  per-
ceived  situational  variables  or  locus  of  control  scales  were  found.  These  results  help  to
increase confidence  in  the candidness  of subject  responses.

As shown  in  Table  1, the  Rotter  and  Spector  measures  of locus  of control  show  some
overlap.  The  magnitude  of  the  correlation  between  the  Rotter  and  Spector  measures
(r  =  .50) is consistent  with previous research (Spector,  1988). The situational  variables of
branch  grade,  work  overload,  superior-subordinate  relationship  and  role  clarity  are
basically  independent  of each other. The  negative correlations  between  productivity  and
self-development  (r  =  -  .22) and dollar shortages and self-development  (r  =  —. 17), com-
bined  with  the  weak  but  positive  correlation  (r  =  .12)  between  productivity  and  dollar
shortages, supports the idea that productivity and dollar shortages are 'opposite' (i.e. com-
pliant-based)  from  self-development  (i.e.  initiative-based).  Further  statistical  analysis
indicated  that  productivity  and  self-development  were  normally  distributed,  but  that
dollar shortages was negatively skewed. To reduce the impact  of extreme dollar  shortages
scores, a square root  transformation  was applied  (Cohen  & Cohen,  1983).

Looking  at independent-dependent  variable  relationships, the  results  in Table  1 show
that  number  and  name  comparison  ability  is  significantly  positively  correlated  to  pro-
ductivity  and  negatively  related  to  dollar  shortages.  Since  the  number  and  name  com-

parison  tests were used  for selection,  there is some  restriction  of range on  this  composite
measure  which  would  attenuate  ability—performance  correlations.  Length  of  service  is
significantly  positively  related  to productivity  and  negatively  related  to doUat shortages.
Of the situational  variables, work  overload  shows the strongest  pattern  of correlations  to
the performance  dimensions.

Work  overload  is significantly  positively  related  to productivity  and  dollar  shortages
and  negatively  correlated  to  self-development.  Superior—subordinate  relationship  is
significantly  positively  related  to  self-development.  Branch  grade  and  role  clarity  are
significantly  positively  related  to  productivity.  Overall,  these  independent—dependent
variable  correlations  confirm  that  both  individual  and  situational  variables  are  necessary
for  explaining  performance  (Campbell  & Pritchard,  1976; Cummings  & Schwab,  1973;
Vonetetal.,  1975).

Test of hypotheses

Hypothesis  1 predicted  that  Spector's  (1988) work  locus of control  measure  would  have
a stronger  relationship  to initiative and  compliant performance  than  the Rotter  measure.
The  results  from  Table  1 partially  support  this  hypothesis.  The  Rotter  measure  showed
correlations  of  .15,  —.06,  and  —.08,  to  productivity,  dollar  shortages  and  self-
development,  while  the Spector measure correlated  .27, .05  and  —.30 to these variables.
A  significant  difference  for  self-development  was  found  in  the  expected  direction
(McNemar,  1969).  Spector's  measure  showed  a  significantly  stronger  relationship
{p <  .05) to self-development  than  the  Rotter  measure.

Hypothesis  2 predicted  that  locus of control  would  be positively  related  to  compliant
performance  and  negatively  related  to initiative performance.  The results  in Table  1 pro-
vide  partial  support  for  this  hypothesis.  The  Spector  locus  of  control  measure  was
significantly  positively  related  to  productivity  (r  =  .27)  and  significantly  negatively
related  to self-development  (r  =  —.30). These  two correlations  were significantly  differ-
ent  {p  <  .01)  (McNemar,  1969).  Non-significant  results  were  found  using  the  Rotter
(1966)  measure.

Hypothesis  3 predicted  that  locus  of control  would  account  for  significant  additional
variance  in  initiative  and  compliant  performance,  beyond  controlled  for  individual  and
situational  variables.  The  results  for  this  hypothesis  are  shown  in  Table  2.  Since  the
Spector  locus of control  measure was significantly  related  to productivity  and  self-devel-
opment,  this measure was tested  using  hierarchical  regression analyses as shown  in Table
2.  The  results  support  Hypothesis  3.  Spector's  (1988)  scale  (step  3)  accounted  for
significant  additional  variance  in  productivity  (6 per  cent)  and  self-development  (7  per
cent).  However,  the  Spector  (1988)  measure  did  not  account  for  significant  variance  in
dollar  shortages. The  Rotter  (1966) scale did  not  account  for  significant  additional  vari-
ance in  any performance  measure.

The  hierarchical  regression  equations  also  show  the  contributions  made  to  explained
performance  variance  by demographics  (step  1); individual  variables  -  length  of  service
and  ability  (step  2); the  non-perceptual  situational  variable-branch  grade  (step  3); and
perceptual  situational  variables—work  overload,  superior-subordinate  relationship  and
role clarity  (step 4). Cumulatively,  the  regression  model  for each performance  measure is
significant  {p <  .05).

° Significance of incremental variance.

Overall,  the  predictor  set  results  show  that  neither  demographics  nor  branch  grade
account  for  significant  performance  variance, while  perceptual  situational  variables  con-
sistently account for significant  performance  variance. As a predictor set, length of service
and  ability  have a mixed  impact,  accounting  for  significant  variance  in productivity  and
dollar shortages, but  not  in self-development.  In addition, these regression  findings  were
replicated  while controlling  for  the  impact  of each performance  measure on the other.  In
sum, the  regression  results provide partial  support  for  Hypothesis  3.

Finally,  since  these  regression  analyses  accounted  for  modest  amounts  of  performance
variance  (18  to  26 per  cent), the  possibility  of interactive  effects  was explored.  Previous
locus of control  research (e.g. Spector,  1982) has suggested  that  locus of control can  mod-
erate the relationships of leadership style and  job characteristics  to work outcomes. Based
upon  such  research several interactive  locus of control  (LOC) effects  on performance  were
tested  for,  including:  LOC  X  branch  grade,  LOC  X  superior—subordinate  relationship,
and  LOC  X  role  clarity.  Hollenbeck,  Brief,  Whitener  & Pauli  (1988)  found  that  LOC
interacted  with  aptitude  to predict  performance  for  a sample  of college  students.  In  this

study a LOC  X ability effect  on performance  was tested. No significant  interactive  effects
for LOC were  found.

Discussion

This  study  provides  a  rigorous  test  for  the  utility  of  locus  of  control  in  explaining
employee performance.  Most  previous  research  testing  the  relationship  between  locus of
control  and  job performance  is based  on  cross-sectional,  self-report  data  without  control
variables  (Spector,  1982,  1988). Closer  examination  of the  performance  criterion  (Katz,
1964)  led  to a distinction  being  made  between  compliant  versus  initiative  performance.
Locus  of  control  was  found  to  be  useful  for  explaining  initiative  and  compliant  per-
formance.

The scales used for measuring  locus of control  affected  the study's results. The  Spector
(1988) scale was more strongly  related  to self-development  than  the Rotter  (1966) scale.
In  addition,  the  Spector  (1988)  measure  exhibited  significantly  different  correlations
to  productivity  versus  self-development.  These  results  reinforce  Fisher's 
(1980)
general  argument  concerning  job performance  that  researchers  need  to  consider  the  'fit'
between personality  measures <zW performance  outcomes  to obtain  maximum  predictive
validity.

The Spector measure contains  items  which  only deal  with  the work domain  (e.g. pro-
motions,  job  effort,  getting  a job). The  Rotter  scale, on  the  other  hand,  contains  items
which  cut  across  several  different  domains  (e.g.  life  in  general,  politics,  work).  Previous
locus of control-performance  research has often  neglected  this  'fit'  issue. Such neglect  has
contributed  to  the  inconsistent  relationship  between  locus  of  control  and  performance
(e.g. Brownell,  1981; Majumder  e?<?/.,  1977; Spector,  1982; Szilagyi etal,  1976; Tseng,
1970).

More recent personality research has emphasized  the 'scope of the personality  construct
being  measured'  (Adler  & Weiss,  1988). For example, self-esteem  has been  theorized  to
be a  relevant  personality  variable  for  explaining  work  outcomes  such  as job  satisfaction
and  job performance  (e.g.  Greenhaus,  1971; Korman,  1970).  However,  researchers  (e.g.
Tharenou,  1979)  often  found  non-significant  self-esteem—work  outcome  relationships
when  using global  measures  of self-esteem  (e.g. Rosenberg,  1965). Tharenou  (1979) and
others  (e.g.  Simpson  & Boyle,  1975)  have  argued  that  self-esteem-work  outcome  rela-
tionships would be stronger if more work-specific  self-esteem  measures were used.  Recent
research  (e.g.  Ellis  & Taylor,  1983; Pierce, Gardner,  Cummings  & Dunham,  1989)  sup-
ports  this  argument.  The  results  of  this  study  suggest  a  similar  emphasis  for  applied
research  testing  locus of control.

Finding that  internals exhibited  higher initiative performance,  while externals showed
higher  compliant  performance  supports  Spector's  (1982) work.  However,  additional  dis-
cussion  of  the  'mechanisms'  for  explaining  these  different  relationships  is  needed.
Productivity  was  found  to  be  a compliant  performance  dimension,  heavily  emphasized
during  teller  training  and  subsequent  performance  appraisals  by  their  branch  service
manager.  Externals' sensitivity  to this emphasis on productivity  would  help explain  their
stronger  performance  on  this  dimension  (Spector,  1982). Internals'  stronger  relationship
to self-development  may be partially due to the autonomy which this performance  dimen-
sion  allowed  internals,  since  it  was  beyond  the  basic  requirements  of  the  teller's  job.


Locus of control and job performance 

135

Previous research has shown a positive relationship between internals and perceived  work
autonomy  (Kimmons  & Greenhaus,  1976; Spector,  1982).

Internals  will  attempt  to exert  more  control  if they  perceive  such  control  is linked  to
subsequent  rewards (Rotter,  1966; Spector,  1982). Self-development  was a more  import-
ant  performance  dimension  than  productivity  and  dollar  shortages  for  determining  the
promotability  of tellers to higher-level positions (e.g. head teller, assistant  branch  service
manager). This promotion potential would  motivate internals to emphasize  self-develop-
ment. One strategy for internals could  be to perform  only adequately on productivity  and
dollar shortages, while concentrating on self-development,  because of its higher perceived
reward value. A post hoc study of 60 randomly selected  internal versus external  tellers sup-
ported  this  explanation.  The  internal  tellers  perceived  self-development 
to  have  a
significantly  higher  (p <  .05) mean reward  value than  externals (3.88 vs. 2.47).

One important  result of this study was to highlight  further  the complexity  of the  per-
formance  criterion  (Ghiselli,  1956).  Compliant  and  initiative  performance  dimensions
were found  to be distinguishable.  Unfortunately,  the dimensions  found  in  this  study  are
sample specific. It  is important  for behavioural scientists to continue to study both in-role
or compliant  behaviour  as well  as innovative  and  spontaneous  behaviour  (Katz  & Kahn,
1978). For example. Organizational  Citizenship Behavior  (Organ,  1988) is a generalized
scale  which  measures  certain  types  of compliant  and  innovative  behaviours.  Hopefully,
this  study's  results  will  encourage  research  attempts  to develop  a more generalized  scale
for measuring  self-training.

Certainly future  research  is called for using additional samples, organizations and  mea-
sures  to test  the  findings  of this  study. For example, a bank  teller's  job seems more  com-
pliant  than other jobs (e.g. nurse, research scientist). Beyond using  locus of control,  other
personality  traits  reflecting  a  sense  of  personal  responsibility,  such  as  self-efficacy  (e.g.
Gist,  1987),  could  be  tested  for  their  usefulness  in  accounting  for  compliant  versus
initiative-based  performance.

It  is important  to acknowledge various limitations of this study. Such  limitations  may
partially explain why more performance  variance was not accounted  for. No selection  test
was given  by the bank to predict  self-development.  The branch grade situational  variable
was not  broken  down  into its three components. Perhaps as separate variables these com-
ponents  might  have had a stronger  impact  on  the results.

The  survey  was  restricted  to  tellers  with  more  than  three  months  of  experience  to
ensure  that  subjects  had  some familiarity  with  the  teller position.  However,  this  restric-
tion  might  have reduced  the impact  of the perceived  situational variables. Upon  entry  to
an  organization,  new  employees  can experience  'reality  shock'  (Hughes,  1958),  whereby
their  work  expectations  are disconfirmed.  Initial  work experiences affect  employees'  per-
ceptions of work  load,  role clarity and  relationship with  their  boss (Blau,  1988; Wanous,
1980).  New  employee  perceptions  of  these  variables  may  change  over  a  three-month
period.  Such an interval  could allow  new employees more time  to adapt and  'make sense'
of their  work situation  (Louis,  1980).

Spector's (1988) locus of control measure was only compared  to the Rotter (1966) mea-
sure. Due to survey  length  constraints, other  locus of control  scales (e.g. Levenson,  1973;
Paulhus,  1983) could  not  be used. These scales would  have provided  a stronger  compara-
tive  test.  Future  research  should  compare  the  predictive  validity  of  Spector's  (1988)
measure  to  such  scales. It  is encouraging  that  locus  of control  was  useful  in  accounting

for  performance,  despite  the  potential  for  restriction  of  range  in  individual  differences
when  sampling  from  one organization,  according  to Schneider's  (1987)  attraction-selec-
tion-attrition  framework.

In conclusion,  the results of this study support  Weiss & Adler (1984) that  it would  be
premature to  conclude  that  personality  variables  do  not  have  a  systematic  effect  on
employee outcomes. Organizational  researchers need to search for new ways in which  per-
sonality  constructs  may  be  relevant.  By drawing  attention  to  the  nature  of the  perform-
ance being  measured  in relation  to the scope of the personality  construct  (Adler & Weiss,
1988),  this  paper  can  stimulate  additional  research  on  an  approach  which  should  prove
useful.
