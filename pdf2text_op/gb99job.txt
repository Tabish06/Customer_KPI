perceived workplace factors

Summary

Predictors of employee aggression against coworkers, subordinates, and supervisors
were studied in a sample of 136 men employed full-time. Person behaviors (history of
aggression, amount of alcohol consumed) predicted aggression against a coworker. In
contrast, aggression against a supervisor was predicted by two perceived workplace
factors ( procedural justice, workplace surveillance). However, neither person behaviors
nor perceived workplace factors predicted aggression against a subordinate. In addition,
person behaviors and perceived workplace factors interacted to predict aggression.
First, procedural justice interacted with amount of alcohol consumed in predicting both
aggression against a coworker and aggression against a subordinate. Secondly, both job
security and procedural
justice interacted with history of aggression in predicting
aggression against a subordinate. Finally, job security and amount of alcohol consumed
interacted to predict aggression against a subordinate. Results suggest that both the
understanding and prediction of employee aggression will be enhanced by taking into
account the target of employee aggression, and by including both perceived workplace
factors and person behaviors as predictor variables. Copyright # 1999 John Wiley &

Introduction

Violence increasingly pervades our daily lives, and the workplace is not immune (Leather, Cox
and Farnsworth, 1990; Thomas, 1992). Some work groups are vulnerable to violent incidents in
which the victim is providing a service and the aggressor is a client (e.g., police o(cid:129)cers, social
workers, nurses, and retail sales sta). However, there may be no dierences between occupations
in the likelihood of employees being violent (Toufexis, 1994). It is surprising that aggression and

violence have received limited research attention given that both the frequency and severity of
work-related violent incidents have been increasing (Cawood, 1991; Leather et al., 1990).
Statistics indicate that workplace homicide is the fastest growing form of murder in the United
States (Filipczak, 1993). Furthermore, the incidence of employees killing present or former
employers, which has doubled or tripled over the last decade (Kinney and Johnson, 1993), is the
fastest growing category of workplace violence (Bensimon, 1994). The immense costs of
employee aggression and violence (e.g., lives lost, legal liabilities, lost productivity of victims,
witnesses and survivors, damaged corporate reputation; Barling, 1996; Fox and Levin, 1994),
and the fact that they are increasing, necessitate a theoretically and empirically focused pro-
gramme of study into the nature of these behaviors.

To date, the majority of studies addressing workplace aggression/violence has taken one of
three approaches. First, there are those addressing customer or client-perpetrated violence,
describing elements of jobs, or characteristics of employees, which increase susceptibility to
violence by non-employees (e.g., Breakwell, 1989; Davis, 1987; Kraus, 1987). The second
approach to workplace aggression investigates demographic and psychological correlates,
attempting to isolate employee attitudes (e.g., Merriam, 1977; Moretti, 1986; Slora, et al.,
1991a; Slora, Joy and Terris, 1991b), and/or personal characteristics associated with perpetrators
of workplace violence (e.g., history of violent behavior, domestic disputes, alcohol or substance
abuse; Herman, 1992). Information gleaned from theories and studies emphasizing the person
predictors of counterproductive workplace behaviors has been utilized to create strategies for
prevention and control of such behaviors. For example, in response to employee violence, some
employers are seeking proﬁles of job applicants, or relying heavily on preemployment integrity
tests to maintain greater control in selecting what they believe are the most honest and trustworthy
employees from a pool of job applicants. A third area of research focuses on situational
determinants/correlates of employee violence. However, this area has attracted little attention. To
truly understand the nature of aggressive behavior, we will focus on the predictive roles of both
person behaviors and workplace factors in this research.

Deﬁnition of outcome variable

Although the terms ‘aggression’ and ‘violence’ have been used interchangeably until now, it
should be noted that there are dierences between them. Aggression has been deﬁned as any
behavior where the aggressor delivers a noxious stimulus to another person—with the intent of
harming the other person—and expects that this noxious stimulus will harm the targeted victim
(Geen, 1990). Similarly, violence is deﬁned as an act carried out with the intention, or perceived
intention, of causing physical pain or injury to another person (Straus and Gelles, 1986).
Conceptually then, aggression and violence dier with respect to the nature of harm imposed on
a victim. The consensus in the literature is that if harm inﬂicted is physical in nature, then the
behavior that brought about this harm can be classiﬁed as violent. Support for this distinction
comes from work by Barling et al. (1987) in the area of marital aggression. In their study, two
consistent factors emerged in two separate samples: violence (e.g., hitting, beating, kicking) and
psychological aggression (e.g., insulting, swearing).

Person behaviors

We suggest that two person behaviors, namely alcohol use and a history of the use of aggression,
will predict aggression by employees in the workplace. Because of a paucity of research on

PREDICTING EMPLOYEE AGGRESSION

employee aggression and violence in the workplace, the bases for our predictions of person
behaviors derive from studies on family violence and aggression in general (Barling, 1996).
Such ﬁndings are relevant to an understanding of aggression and violence in the workplace,
because, as is the case of family violence, employees invariably aggress against someone who is
known to them.

There is a wealth of data linking alcohol use and partner aggression in intimate relationships.
This link is consistent in correlational studies of dating (Makepeace, 1987), engaged (Arias,
Samios and O’Leary, 1987) and married (Pan, Neidig and O’Leary, 1994) couples. Further,
ﬁndings from an experimental study demonstrated that the prevalence and frequency of
marital violence decreased one year after participants received treatment for alcoholism
(O’Farrell and Murphy, 1995). With respect to the workplace, substance abuse is common
among workplace murderers (Graham, 1991; Stuart, 1992).

Aggression is relatively stable across time and situations; aggressiveness at eight years of age
has been shown to predict serious antisocial behavior some two decades later (Huesmann et al.,
1984). Research also shows that one’s past use of aggression strongly predicts physical aggression
towards an intimate partner (Malone, Tyree and O’Leary, 1989; Riggs and O’Leary, 1989). In a
workplace context, a history of violent behavior is typical of workplace murderers (Graham,
1991; Stuart, 1992).

Hypothesis 1: The amount of alcohol consumed by employees, and employees’ history
of aggressive behavior, will positively predict the amount of aggression they engage in
at work.

Perceived workplace factors

As mentioned earlier, research over the last decade has primarily addressed person predictors
of employee aggression. However, predicting employee aggression is a complex process, as many
people who ﬁt a violent proﬁle may not actually behave violently at work. It has been well
established that an individual’s behavior is often inﬂuenced by social cues in their environment
(Bandura, 1977). For example, the changing nature of, and increasing stresses within the
workplace are associated with counterproductive workplace behaviors, such as theft, (Greenberg,
1990) and may also be associated with workplace violence (e.g., Barling, 1996; McLean Parks
and Kidder, 1994). Until now however, when workplace factors are discussed as possible deter-
minants of workplace aggression, it is typically done anecdotally. Therefore, our aim is to subject
these often-mentioned workplace variables to empirical scrutiny. In addition, the majority of
research conceptualizes aggression as a lack of self-control or personality ﬂaw. In contrast (and as
suggested by anecdotal evidence) our study (implicitly) views employee aggression as a mode of
social control (i.e., a way that employees express grievances). Therefore, we include workplace
variables that: (1) have often been suggested as potential predictors, (2) have not been tested
empirically, and (3) allow for the possibility of conceptualizing aggression as an expression of
a grievance and not simply as a character ﬂaw (e.g., surveillance of employees as an invasion
of privacy). In doing so, we suggest that four perceived workplace factors will predict work-
place aggression and violence, namely job insecurity, procedural and distributive justice, and
surveillance of employees.

Perhaps one of the most consequential organizational events in the past decade has been
technological changes and downsizing. Changes such as these have led to considerably high
levels of job insecurity in employees. Job insecurity reﬂects the perceived powerlessness to retain

control over one’s job, or valued aspects of one’s job (Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984).
Possible consequences of job insecurity include anxiety and stress (Jick, 1985; Romzek, 1985),
intentions to quit, and decreased job satisfaction, commitment, and trust in the company
(Ashford, Lee and Bobko, 1989). There are no direct links between job insecurity and aggression
in the literature, yet feelings of powerlessness may lead to the use of aggression in an eort to
regain control. In many cases, workplace murderers in the United States were former employees
who had been laid o or disciplined, and returned to seek revenge on the individuals they deemed
responsible for their circumstances (Stuart, 1992).

Another workplace variable of considerable importance is procedural

justice which
includes perceptions of formal procedures and interactional justice. Formal procedures reﬂect
the degree to which fair procedures are perceived to be present and used in an organization.
Interactional justice was identiﬁed by Bies and his colleagues (Bies and Moag, 1986; Tyler and
Bies, 1990), who found that a manager’s actions in carrying out procedures and explaining
decisions to employees are instrumental in determining employees’ perceptions of procedural
justice. Perceptions of procedural injustice are related to counterproductive behaviors such
as employee theft (e.g., Greenberg, 1990, 1993). Some support also exists for a link between
perceived unfairness and employee aggression. For example, organizations that oer eective
grievance and harassment procedures have fewer violent incidents (Northwestern National Life
Insurance Company, 1993). Further, frustration as a function of perceptions of procedural
injustice, was related to verbal aggression at work (Spector, 1975) and several retrospective
investigations have linked unfair discipline (e.g., harassment, coercion, and intimidation of
employees) as the proximal cause of workplace violence (Committee on Post O(cid:129)ce and Civil
Service, 1992).

Unlike procedural justice, distributive justice reﬂects the perceived fairness of the rewards
employees receive for their performance inputs (Folger & Greenberg, 1985). Individuals who feel
inequitably underpaid, strive to restore a balance between their rewards and contributions to a
job; either by lowering their inputs or by attempting to raise their outcomes (Adams, 1963).
Research has supported this notion (Greenberg, 1990, 1993), with employee theft viewed as the
expression of a grievance or a speciﬁc reaction to underpayment inequity. In their recent article,
O’Leary-Kelly, Gri(cid:129)n and Glew (1996) suggest that workplace violence may ensue when
employees perceive valued outcomes (e.g., promotions, compensation) to be distributed unfairly.
Again, retrospective reports note that people who have killed former work colleagues or super-
visors, for example, had been passed over for a promotion or denied a workers’ compensation
claim (Stuart, 1992).

Many organizations make use of human and machine-like supervision and surveillance in the
workplace (e.g., electronic performance monitoring). Some studies have found that monitored
workers report increased stress, decreased social interaction with coworkers and supervisors
(Irving, Higgins and Safayeni, 1986), adverse health consequences (Lund, 1992), and boredom,
tension, anxiety, depression, anger, and fatigue (Smith et al., 1992). Reasons for this may be
speciﬁc to the electronic nature of the surveillance (with, for example, its feelings of loss of
control). Another reason suggested for the above negative personal and workplace consequences
is that electronic surveillance invades the privacy of workers, ‘erod[ing] their sense of dignity and
frustrat[ing] their eorts to do high-quality work . . .’ (Lund, 1992, p. 54). It is possible that other
types of supervision (i.e., non-electronic) will also exert feelings of loss of privacy and/or loss of
control. For example, invasion of privacy is clearly illustrated by some of the surveillance
methods used by the U.S. Postal Service (e.g., monitoring employees’ bathroom visits). Further-
more, in one empirical study, overly close supervision led to verbal aggression against a super-
visor (Day and Hamblin, 1964). The above research ﬁndings reveal that, in addition to person

characteristics, a complete analysis of employee aggression and violence must acknowledge the
contribution of speciﬁc organizational factors.

Hypothesis 2: Feelings of job insecurity, perceptions of procedural injustice, and workplace
surveillance each will be positively associated with aggressive acts at work while perceptions
of distributive injustice will be negatively associated with aggressive acts at work.

In addition to the above predictions, we addressed—in a more exploratory way—two other
research questions in the area of employee aggression. The ﬁrst of these is concerned with
whether the proposed perceived workplace factors will contribute signiﬁcantly to the prediction
of employee aggression and violence over and above the contribution made by person behaviors.
The second question we explored relates to the interaction between person behaviors and
perceived workplace factors in predicting aggressive acts in the workplace.

Interactions between person behaviors and perceived
workplace factors

An understanding of complex human behavior demands consideration of person-by-situation
interactions (Mischel, 1968). The interaction of person behaviors and workplace factors is
apparent in actual incidents of workplace violence. For example, Fox and Levin (1994) note that
the U.S. Postal Service’s ‘authoritarian’ structure may have exacerbated aggressive tendencies
among some of its employees. Empirical studies, too, have found support for person-by-situation
interactions: One study addressing sexual harassment in the workplace observed a signiﬁcant
interaction eect (Dekker and Barling, 1998). Furthermore, Storms and Spector (1987) found
that employees having an external locus of control were more likely to respond to organizational
frustration by engaging in counterproductive behaviors than were people with an internal locus
of control. Therefore, extending beyond the above individual predictions, we explored the
possibility that the interaction between person behaviors and workplace factors would predict
workplace aggression and violence.

Outcome variables: employee aggression against
coworkers, subordinates, and supervisors

Incidents of workplace violence that have attracted increased media attention invariably
consist of murder of former supervisors by subordinates. While this type of violence is worthy
of empirical scrutiny, it also has limited our focus of attention in two important ways: (1) it
limits the scope of behaviors on which we focus; and (2) it limits research to only one type of
victim.

First, although one of the gravest manifestations of workplace violence is bodily injury, in
reality, it represents only a small portion of workplace violence. That is, employees engage in less
serious forms of violence even more frequently than incidents of workplace homicide; however,
these incidents are not as highly publicized or researched as murder. For example, a recent
national victimization survey of 600 civilian workers found that one third of non-lethal violent
incidents were committed by current or former coworkers, supervisors or subordinates (Fox and
Levin, 1994). Furthermore, Northwestern National Life Insurance’s (1993) survey suggests that
each year in the U.S., more than two million employees endure physical attacks, more than six

million employees are threatened in some way, and more than 16 million employees are harassed
(Toufexis, 1994). Like family violence then (Straus, 1979), workplace violence can be concept-
ualized as a continuum ranging from the least harmful behaviors (e.g., shouting) to those that are
extreme and injurious (e.g., severe bodily injury or murder; Slora et al., 1991a; Slora et al.,
1991b). Yet, there is a paucity of research examining these less severe forms of person-directed
workplace violence, even though the frequency of their occurrence suggests that they are worthy
of more focused research attention. It was the aim of this study to explore this full range of
aggressive and violent behaviors.

Concerning the second limitation, the stereotype of the disgruntled employee returning to seek
revenge against a former supervisor has obscured the fact that employees aggress against
coworkers and subordinates as well as supervisors. To redress this, in our study we include
aggression against coworkers, subordinates, and supervisors and investigate whether these three
types of aggression can be dierentiated through their predictors. This second goal is exploratory
in nature as we lack su(cid:129)cient theory and evidence that would provide us with a basis to form
more speciﬁc hypotheses (e.g., which variables might predict aggression against a coworker but
not aggression against a supervisor).

Method

Participants and procedure

Questionnaires were distributed to all 550 non-faculty males employed full-time at a Canadian
university; 136 usable questionnaires were returned (response rate (cid:136) 25 per cent) by mail. In
this study we focused on aggression by male employees because of consistent ﬁndings that men
are more aggressive than women across dierent contexts (e.g., Malone et al., 1989; Marchetti
and McCartney, 1990). Selecting only men would increase the probability of obtaining reports
of aggressive behaviors in the workplace. At the time of data collection, the average age of
participants was 41.2 years (S:D: (cid:136) 9.4; range 23–65), their average income was U.S. $43,345
(S:D: (cid:136) $13; 950; range $14,500–99,000), they worked 40.3 hours per week (S:D: (cid:136) 7.7; range
35–70), and had been employed at the university for 12.1 years (S:D: (cid:136) 8.0; range 25–33). On
average, participants had between three and four years of college or university education. All of
the participants had coworkers, 97 per cent (132) had supervisors, and 68 per cent (92) had
subordinates.

Questionnaires

Descriptive statistics and alpha coe(cid:129)cients for all scales are presented in Table 1. See Table 2 for
an intercorrelation matrix of all scales.

Alcohol consumption was measured with The Quantity–Frequency–Variability Index
(Cahalan, Cisin and Crossley, 1969). First, participants were asked separately how often they
usually drink wine, beer, and liquor. Seventeen participants did not drink any wine, beer, and
liquor at least once per month or more and were asked not to continue with this scale. For those
who drink at least one type of alcohol once per month or more (n (cid:136) 119), the scale’s remaining
nine questions—three for each type of alcohol—are as follows: how often they drink as many as
ﬁve or six glasses, three or four glasses, and one or two glasses at any one time. Participants were

only required to complete all nine questions if they initially reported drinking all three substances
at least once per month. If, for example, they only drink wine once a month (and drink beer and
liquor less than once a month), they were asked to complete only the three questions related to
wine drinking (and ignore the six questions concerning beer and liquor). All nine of these
questions use a 5-point response scale (1 (cid:136) never, 5 (cid:136) nearly every time). The coding is as
follows: Items were summed to form separate composite scores for wine, beer, and liquor
consumption on the basis of how often they drink ﬁve or six glasses, how often they drink three
or four glasses (multiplied by a coe(cid:129)cient of 0.7), and how often they drink one or two glasses
(multiplied by a coe(cid:129)cient of 0.3). This dierential weighting was used to reﬂect severity of
drinking behavior. For example, if weights were not used, a person who routinely drinks ﬁve or
six glasses of wine but never drinks three (or four) or one (or two) glasses of wine would score
the same as a person who always drinks one (or two) glasses of wine but never drinks three
(or four) glasses of wine (i.e., a score of 5). That is, dierent weights were used so that ‘ﬁve or
six drinks at a time’ would be reﬂected as more serious drinking behavior than ‘one or two
drinks at a time’. Finally, the three composite scores were summed to create an overall alcohol
consumption index. The aforementioned 17 participants were assigned a composite score of
zero.

To assess history of aggressive actions, a modiﬁed version of Malone et al.’s (1989) scale was
used. Participants indicated how often they hit their parents, their siblings, or non-family
members, both during high school and post high school. The following changes were made to the
original scale. First, ‘hitting mother’ and ‘hitting father’ were combined into a ‘hitting either
parent’ item because violence against parents is rare (Malone et al., 1989). Second, to assess
verbal aggression, items related to how often participants yelled at and argued with parents,
siblings, and others during high school and post high school were added. Third, participants were
not asked about aggressive behaviors during junior high school because aggressive young adults
are typically aggressive as young teenagers (Huesmann et al., 1984). The responses for this scale
range from 1 (cid:136) never to 5 (cid:136) very frequently.

Job security was assessed using Kuhnert and Vance’s (1992) 18-item scale (e.g., ‘I am not really
sure how long my present job will last’). Responses are scored on a 5-point Likert scale
(1 (cid:136) Strongly disagree, 5 (cid:136) Strongly agree).

The two dimensions of Procedural justice were measured by Moorman’s (1991) Formal
Procedures Scale and Interactional Justice Scale (7 items each). The Formal Procedures Scale
measures the degree to which an organization uses fair procedures. The Interactional Justice
Scale measures perceptions of the interactions that accompany the formal procedures. Responses
for both scales are scored on a 7-point Likert scale (‘Strongly disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’).
Because these two scales were substantially intercorrelated (r(cid:133)136(cid:134) (cid:136) 0.79), they were combined
into a single scale and renamed procedural justice.

Price and Mueller’s (1986) ﬁve item Distributive justice scale measures the extent to which
employees believe that rewards are related to performance inputs. Responses are scored on a
7-point Likert scale ranging from ‘Strongly disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’.

A Workplace surveillance scale was developed for this study as no relevant scale exists. Partici-
pants reported (‘Yes’, ‘No’, or ‘Don’t know’ coded 2, 0, and 1, respectively) on the presence
of seven dierent monitoring devices (e.g., ‘punching a time card ’, ‘timed lunches’, and ‘frequent
employee evaluations’) that might be used by management to monitor employees in their present
workplace.

Outcome variables: employee aggression

There is currently no inventory of aggressive workplace behaviors. Therefore, a measure of
employee aggression was developed based on Straus’s (1979) Conﬂict Tactics Scales. Although
Straus’s (1979) scale was designed to measure the use of reasoning, verbal aggression, and
violence within the family, its list of behaviors is generalizable to other contexts such as the
workplace. The following modiﬁcations and additions were made to the original scale. First, the
introductory wording was changed for applicability to the workplace. Second, the ‘Reasoning’
subscale was omitted. Third, several items were added to the ‘Verbal aggression’ subscale
(‘gossiped about’, ‘spread rumours about’, ‘played mean pranks’, ‘argued with’, ‘name-called’,
‘made rude gestures to’) which subsequently, was renamed ‘Psychological aggression’. Fourth,
two items (‘threatened with a knife or gun’ and ‘used a knife or gun’) were deleted from the
‘Violence’ subscale as it was unlikely that these behaviors occurred in a university setting.
Last, items consisting of two or more behaviors were divided into separate items; ‘insulted
and swore at’ were separated, as were ‘threatened to hit/threatened to throw something at’,
‘push/grab/shove’ and ‘kick/bit/hit with ﬁst’.

This modiﬁed version of the Conﬂict Tactics Scale consists of 22 behaviors ranging from
psychological aggression (e.g., gossiping), to violence (e.g., beating up). Using Straus’s (1979)
scoring system (0 (cid:136) never, 1 (cid:136) once, 2 (cid:136) twice, 3 (cid:136) three to ﬁve times, 4 (cid:136) six to ten times,
5 (cid:136) 11 to 20 times, 6 (cid:136) more than 20 times), participants indicated separately the number of
times they used any of the behaviors against a coworker, subordinate, or supervisor at work
during the past 12 months (or during their current job, if they had been at their job less than a
year). Eighty-two per cent, 74 per cent, and 76 per cent of respondents admitted to at least one
incident of psychological aggression against a coworker, subordinate, and supervisor, respect-
ively (with ‘gossiped about’ and ‘argued with’ having the greatest frequency of occurrence). In
contrast, only two participants engaged in physical aggression; thus, physical aggression was
removed from any further analyses.

Composite scores of verbal aggression against a coworker, subordinate, and supervisor were
derived using Barling et al.’s (1987) procedure: Each item was standardized before summing in
order to obtain relatively low weights for common behaviors (e.g., gossiping), and higher weights
for less frequent behaviors (e.g., beating up).

Results

The data were ﬁrst checked to ensure that they satisﬁed the assumptions of multiple regression.
For example, each predictor variable was linearly related to each of the dependent variables. With
the exception of the three outcome variables, all scales were not signiﬁcantly skewed. Trans-
formations of the dependent variables, however, were not undertaken because transformed
variables are often di(cid:129)cult to interpret, they are generally highly correlated with the original
variables, and because regression analysis is robust under violations of normality (Kirk, 1982).
As mentioned earlier, formal procedures and interactional justice scales were combined in order
to avoid eects of multicollinearity.

One goal of this study was to investigate whether the three types of aggression under investiga-
tion could be dierentiated through their predictors. However, because the three outcome vari-
ables were substantially intercorrelated (suggesting they may not be distinct forms of aggression) it
was neither conceptually nor statistically sound to begin by running separate regression analyses
(i.e., one for each outcome). In other words, high intercorrelations amongst outcome variables
could result in the corresponding regression analyses not being as separate or independent as we
would want them to be, possibly rendering our solution unstable. We therefore, ﬁrst conducted a
canonical correlation analysis which produced three linear combinations, of which two were
signiﬁcant. These two linear combinations demonstrated that the three types of aggression under
investigation were signiﬁcantly distinct to proceed with hierarchical regression analyses.

Next, hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the predictors of employee aggression
against coworkers, subordinates, and supervisors. The predictor variables were entered in three
blocks: demographic variables, person behaviors, and workplace factors. The ﬁrst block includes
three demographic variables (age, education, income), all of which are associated with aggression
(Straus, Gelles and Steinmetz, 1980). Their eects were controlled so that the amount of variance
uniquely accounted for by person behaviors and workplace factors could be assessed. The second
block includes both person behaviors (amount of alcohol and history of aggression). The third
block includes the four workplace factors ( job security, procedural justice, distributive justice,
and workplace surveillance). The order of entry of blocks was predetermined. However, within
each block, no order was speciﬁed because there was no theory stating which of the variables
would be most predictive.

Aggression against a coworker

The results of the hierarchical regression analysis for variables predicting aggression against a
coworker can be found in Table 3. First, neither as a block (4 per cent of the variance, p 4 0.05)
nor alone, do any of the demographic variables account for aggression against a coworker.
Second, hypothesis 1 is supported: After controlling for demographic variables, both the amount
of alcohol consumed and history of aggressive behavior predict aggression against a coworker
b (cid:136) 0.21, p 5 0.05 and b (cid:136) 0.24, p 5 0.01, respectively). Together, these two variables add 12 per
cent of the variance in aggression against a coworker ( p 5 0.01). However, Hypothesis 2 is not
supported because none of the four workplace factors predict aggression against a coworker.
Further, the four workplace factors as a block do not account for a signiﬁcant amount of
variance (2 per cent; p 4 0.05) beyond the variance attributable to demographic variables and
person behaviors.

Aggression against a subordinate

Hypotheses 1 and 2 are not supported for aggression against a subordinate. None of the control
variables, person behaviors, or workplace factors emerge as signiﬁcant predictors of aggression
against a subordinate (see Table 3); they account for 1, 5 and 8 per cent of the variance,
respectively, in aggression against a subordinate (all p 4 0.05).

Aggression against a supervisor

None of the demographic variables predict aggression against a supervisor and, as a block, they
account for only 1 per cent of the variance ( p 4 0.05; see Table 3). Likewise, after controlling for
demographic variables, neither of the person behaviors is a signiﬁcant predictor (i.e., no support
for Hypothesis 1; p 4 0.05); as a block, they account for 3 per cent of the variance in aggression
against a supervisor. In contrast, Hypothesis 2 is partially supported. That is, two of the
workplace factors ( procedural justice and workplace surveillance) signiﬁcantly predict aggression
against a supervisor. Procedural justice is negatively, while workplace surveillance is positively
related to aggression against a supervisor (b (cid:136) (cid:255)0.27, p 5 0.01, b (cid:136) 0.18, p 5 0.05). Further-
more, as a block, perceived workplace factors account for a signiﬁcant amount of variance above
and beyond that attributed to control variables and person behaviors (18 per cent, p 5 0.01).

Person (cid:2) situation interactions

The strategy outlined by Aiken and West (1991) was used to test for interaction eects on
workplace aggression. This procedure requires standardizing all predictors (both person and
workplace variables) and calculating interaction terms by multiplying one standardized person
behavior with one standardized workplace factor. Using hierarchical regression, each outcome
variable is regressed ﬁrst on a person behavior and workplace factor, and then on the interaction
of these two variables. Finally, an F test is used to determine if R2 changes signiﬁcantly from step
one to step two of the regression equation. However, this interaction test is very stringent and,
therefore, reduces the likelihood of detecting small eects. Evans (1985) suggests that an inter-
action term accounting for anything greater than 1 per cent of outcome variance is meaningful
(regardless of statistical signiﬁcance). Thus, we report the results of all
interaction terms
accounting for a minimum of 2.5 per cent of the variance beyond that accounted for by each of
the main eects.

The ﬁrst two signiﬁcant interactions involve procedural justice and amount of alcohol con-
sumed. Speciﬁcally, procedural justice interacts with amount of alcohol consumed in predicting
both aggression against a coworker (R2 (cid:136) 0.04, p 5 0.05) and subordinate (R2 (cid:136) 0.08, p 5 0.01).
Under conditions of low justice perceptions, amount of alcohol consumed is strongly and
positively related to aggression against a coworker (b (cid:136) 0.39, p 5 0.01) and a subordinate
(b (cid:136) 0.39, p 5 0.01). In contrast, amount of alcohol consumed is not a signiﬁcant predictor of
aggression against a coworker (b (cid:136) 0.00, p 4 0.05) or subordinate (b (cid:136) (cid:255)0.26, p 4 0.05) when
perceptions of justice are high.

The remaining three interactions meet the criterion for incremental variance, but are not
signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level; furthermore, all three involve aggression against a subordinate. First,
job security interacts with amount of alcohol consumed (R2 (cid:136) 0.03, p (cid:136) 0.09), and with history

of aggression (R2 (cid:136) 0.03, p (cid:136) 0.08) in predicting aggression against a subordinate. Amount of
alcohol consumed and history of aggression are positively related to aggression against a sub-
ordinate when job security is low (b (cid:136) 0.30, p 5 0.05; b (cid:136) 0.43, p 5 0.01, respectively). In
contrast, when job security is high, neither amount of alcohol consumed (b (cid:136) (cid:255)0.03, p 4 0.05)
nor history of aggression (b (cid:136) 0.00, p 4 0.05) is related to aggression against a subordinate.
Lastly, procedural justice interacts with history of aggression in predicting aggression against a
subordinate (R2 (cid:136) 0.03; p (cid:136) 0.12). When perceived justice is low, history of aggression is
signiﬁcantly related to aggression against a subordinate (b (cid:136) 0.35, p 5 0.05). In contrast, when
perceptions of justice are high, history of aggression is not related to aggression against a
subordinates (b (cid:136) 0.07, p 4 0.05).

Discussion

Results of the analyses concerning the prediction of employee aggression against supervisors,
coworkers, and subordinates are clear-cut. First, after controlling for the eects of three demo-
graphic variables and two person behaviors, two workplace factors predicted aggression against
a supervisor. Employees’ perceptions of procedural justice were negatively associated, and the
number of surveillance methods used to monitor employees positively associated, with aggression
against a supervisor. These results are consistent with empirical (Spector, 1975) and non-
empirical studies (see Bensimon, 1994).

In contrast, after controlling for the eects of demographic variables, aggression against a
coworker was positively and signiﬁcantly predicted by both person behaviors (amount of alcohol
consumed and history of aggression) but not by any workplace factors. This link between alcohol
and employee aggression is consistent with ﬁndings in dierent contexts (Arias et al., 1987;
Makepeace, 1987; O’Farrell and Murphy, 1995; Pan et al., 1994). Aggression against a sub-
ordinate, however, was not predicted signiﬁcantly by any variables in the regression equation.
One possibility is that the sample size was too small; only 92 of the original sample had sub-
ordinates who reported to them.

One plausible explanation for this pattern of ﬁndings is that employees’ aggression is target-
speciﬁc: When dissatisﬁed with aspects of their job, they direct aggression towards those pre-
sumed responsible for their dissatisfaction. Because of the nature of workplace factors invest-
igated in this study ( job insecurity, procedural and distributive justice, workplace surveillance),
one would not expect dissatisfaction regarding these factors to be directed—presumably in the
form of aggression—against coworkers. Similarly, it is possible that employees choose not to
aggress against subordinates because subordinates: (1) do not have the power to improve negative
workplace conditions, and (2) would not necessarily be presumed as the cause of the workplace
dissatisfaction. This explanation remains speculative, however, as the motives underlying
aggressive behavior, or the ‘intent of behavior’, was not measured in the present study.

Consistent with our initial expectations, ﬁve interactions met the criterion of accounting for
at least 2.5 per cent of the variance in workplace aggression: Two of these were statistically
signiﬁcant but the three interactions involving aggression against a subordinate, were not. One
reason for this may be that the sample was substantially smaller for this outcome (n (cid:136) 92 as
opposed to n (cid:136) 136), probably resulting in a power not high enough to yield signiﬁcant inter-
actions.

L. GREENBERG AND J. BARLING

First, procedural justice interacted with amount of alcohol consumed in predicting both
aggression against a coworker and aggression against a subordinate. Secondly, both job security
and procedural justice interacted with history of aggression in predicting aggression against a
subordinate. Finally,
job security and amount of alcohol consumed interacted to predict
agression against a subordinate. The same pattern occurred for each of the above interactions.
More speciﬁcally, when organizational procedures and supervisor–subordinate interactions were
perceived as unfair or when employees were insecure about their jobs, then the amount of alcohol
consumed or employees’ history of aggression was strongly related to aggressive acts at work. In
contrast, when employees perceived the procedures and supervisory actions accompanying
procedures as being fair or when job security was high, amount of alcohol consumed or
employees’ history of aggression was not related to aggression in the workplace.

As is the case with most empirical research, several constraints were placed on the design of this
study which may aect the interpretation and generalizability of results. First, because our data is
cross-sectional, we are not able to make causal inferences regarding predictor/outcome relation-
ships: to enable true causal inferences, longitudinal designs are necessary. Further, while we
could not assess physical violence in the present study, research has shown that psychological
aggression often proceeds physical violence in marriages (Murphy and O’Leary, 1989). It would
be interesting to see, through longitudinal research, if a similar progression of violence occurs in
dierent contexts, such as the workplace.

Second, self-selection bias may have contributed to the low response rate, and limited general-
izability of these ﬁndings. The response rate obtained in this study, although seemingly low, is
consistent with those of studies investigating other controversial behaviors (e.g., sexual harass-
ment; Dekker and Barling, 1998). Furthermore, given the nature of the question under investiga-
tion, social desirability may aect the likelihood of obtaining accurate reports of aggression.
This is of some concern as social desirability may be an issue in self-reported partner-directed
aggression (Arias et al., 1987) and sexual harassment (Dekker and Barling, 1998). However, if
social desirability is operating, self-reported levels of aggression would in all probability,
underestimate true levels, leading to truncated relationships due to a lack of variance. Thus, future
studies relying solely on self-report data should control for social desirability.

Third, because all data is self-report, there is no way to separate method variance from true
score variance. It is possible that method variance bolstered the magnitude of relationships
between predictors and outcomes, but seems unlikely that it resulted in a meaningful pattern of
interactions, as the one we observed. To reduce the possibility of mono-method bias, future
studies should aim to incorporate an external criterion so as not to rely solely on subjects’ reports.
Fourth, the generalizability of our results may also be limited because all participants were
from one workplace and all were men. Although they were asked about their perceptions of
workplace factors, there may have been some restriction of range in their responses because
organizational procedures, and the way they are implemented, will be at least somewhat similar
for employees in the same workplace. Despite popular stereotypes, we obtained few reports of
actual physical violence. One possibility for this is that such behaviors were less likely to occur in
our sample. It would seem, then, that dierent occupational groups experience variable rates of
employee aggression and violence; whether this is due to the type of people hired in dierent
industries or to dierent organizational cultures (or some type of interaction of the two) remains
to be seen. Therefore, because of the limited nature of this sample, replication of this research
across a variety of workplaces and blue-collar and white-collar jobs (with social desirability
controlled) would be useful.

In a similar vein, there is a need for the development of an in-depth measure of workplace
violence; one that is designed to measure a range of interpersonally violent behaviors that are

911

job-related (e.g., serious versus less serious, physical, psychological, verbal). Once the deﬁnition
of workplace violence is broadened, researchers can begin to study the complete range of violent
behaviors. Finally, future studies should also investigate the extent to which additional organ-
izational factors (e.g., quality of supervision, job stress) and person behaviors (drug abuse, non-
work stress) inﬂuence employee aggression.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings are of theoretical importance because they increase our knowledge
concerning the predictors of dierent targets of employee aggression. These ﬁndings also provide
a useful starting point for considering the prevention of employee aggression. Clearly, any
attempts to reduce or control employee aggression must be sensitive to the target of aggression.
In addition, our ﬁndings reveal that recruitment strategies which exclude potentially aggressive
applicants will be insu(cid:129)cient. Instead, successful attempts will be based on a simultaneous focus
of both person behaviors and workplace factors.
