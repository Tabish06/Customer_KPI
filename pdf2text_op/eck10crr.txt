  ABSTRACT 
 Previous research has assumed uniform effects 
of  the  news  media ’ s  influence  on  corporate 
reputation. This study uses theories of media 
system dependency and  ‘ need for orientation ’  
to  examine  contingent  conditions  affecting 
the  degree  of  the  media  influence.  Our 
integrated  measurement  approach  gauging 
media  coverage  and  stakeholder  evaluations 
on  the  same  dimensions  of  reputation  fur-
thered  the  methodological  approach  to  this 
research  area.  We  found  that  stakeholders 
depend more on the news media to learn about 
reputation  dimensions  that  are  difficult  to 
directly  experience  or  observe  and  for  which 
the  news  media  are  the  main  source  of 
information.

 INTRODUCTION 
 The function of media relations is often part 
of  the  strategy  that  organizations  use  for 
building  their  reputations  ( Sheafer,  2001 ; 
 Yoon,  2005 ).  As  previous  media  research 
has revealed, the news media are one of the 
primary  ways  that  the  public  learns  about 
organizations, 
their 
connections  to  matters  of  public  interest 
( Deephouse,  2000 ;   Dutton  and  Dukerich, 
1991 ).  Media  research  on  organizations ’  
media relations efforts and the news media ’ s 
inﬂ uence  on  corporate  reputation  includes 
organizations ’  attempts to work through the 
news media to convey their points of view, 
but also the salience of news coverage about 
organizations on the salience of these ﬁ rms. 
The  predominant  theoretical  framework 
for  media  research  applied  to  organizations 
has been agenda-setting theory ( Carroll and 
McCombs, 2003 ). 

  Carroll and McCombs (2003)  used agenda-
setting  theory  as  a  conceptual  framework 
applied to organizations for examining how

 Media and Reputation 

media visibility and media favorability inﬂ u-
ence the prominence of ﬁ rms, their attributes 
and  the  evaluation  of  ﬁ rms  and  their 
attributes.  The  ﬁ rst  level  of  agenda-setting 
explains how the volume of reports the news 
media devote to ﬁ rms (called media visibil-
ity)  inﬂ uences  the  public ’ s  perceptions  of 
which  ﬁ rms  are  the  most  prominent.  The 
second  level  of  agenda-setting  applied  to 
organizations  suggests  that  the  salience  of 
attributes  described  in  the  context  of  ﬁ rms 
relates to the public ’ s perceptions that those 
attributes  are  the  most  important  attributes 
to know about for those ﬁ rms. 

 Thus  far,  the  ﬁ ndings  for  agenda-setting 
applied to organizations ’  news coverage have 
been somewhat mixed. For instance,  Meijer 
and Kleinnijenhuis (2006)  found support for 
how these media portrayals of these substan-
tive attributes inﬂ uenced ﬁ rms ’  reputations, 
while  Kiousis  et al.  (2007)  found mild sup-
port for only some attributes.  Carroll (2004)  
found  that  the  amount  of  media  coverage 
on  certain  attributes  of  a  company  (eg, 
executive performance and workplace envi-
ronment)  but  not  others  (eg,  ﬁ nancial 
performance, products and services or social 
responsibility)  corresponded  to  the  use  of 
these  attributes  by  the  survey  respondents. 
These  results  provide  some  indication  that 
media  effects  on  corporate  reputation  are 
not uniform and vary in context and degree. 
Thus, the question becomes  under what con-
ditions  do the news media inﬂ uence the pub-
lic ’ s perceptions of corporate reputation? 

 One explanation lies in the differentiated 
information needs and interests of corporate 
stakeholders who evaluate the importance of 
a ﬁ rm ’ s attributes differently ( Helm, 2007 ). 
 Post  et al.  (2002)  deﬁ ne the stakeholders in 
a ﬁ rm as individuals and constituencies that 
contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, 
to wealth-creating capacity and activities, and 
who  are  therefore  its  potential  beneﬁ ciaries 
and / or  risk  bearers.  While  employees,  for 
example,  are  more  interested  in  the  ﬁ rm ’ s 
attributes concerning workplace environment 

conditions, investors ’  information needs are 
more  focused  on  ﬁ nding  out  about  a 
ﬁ rm ’ s economic performance and corporate 
strategy. 

 Drawing  on  media  system  dependency 
theory  ( Ball-Rokeach  and  DeFleur,  1976 ) 
and  need  for  orientation  ( Weaver,  1980 ), 
we argue that stakeholders are more depend-
ent on the news media to learn about those 
attributes  of  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation  that  are 
important to them and on which they feel 
the  need  to  gain  information  compared 
to  those  that  they  ﬁ nd  less  important.  We 
argue, furthermore, that dependency is also 
a factor of availability of information, mean-
ing  that  stakeholders  depend  more  on  the 
news media to learn about such aspects that 
are difﬁ cult to directly experience or observe 
(eg, corporate strategy or social responsibil-
ity).  To  learn  about  such   ‘ unobtrusive ’  
aspects  audience  members  have  not  had 
direct experience with ( Demers  et al. , 1989 ) 
the  news  media  are  often  the  main  source 
of information. 

 To test our assumptions of the inﬂ uence 
of  media  dependency  on  the  relationship 
between  media  coverage  and  corporate 
reputation,  we  developed  a  differentiated 
and  integrated  measurement  instrument. 
Reputation  was  conceptualized  as  a  multi-
dimensional  construct,  and  the  tone  of  the 
news reports was coded on exactly the same 
dimensions as stakeholder evaluations of the 
ﬁ rm.  With  this  instrument,  we  were  also 
able to overcome shortcomings of previous 
research where the measurement was either 
undifferentiated or not integrated. A prom-
inent  automobile  company  served  as  the 
research object. News stories were collected 
and  coded  from  national  and  regional 
newspapers  and  magazines  for  the  period 
of  11  months  before  the  survey  that  was 
conducted  among  295  university  students. 
As  buyers  of  cars,  future  employees  and 
opinion  leaders,  university  students  repre-
sent  one  of  the  auto  company ’ s  important 
stakeholder groups.

 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  

 Corporate Reputation 
 General agreement exists in the literature as 
to  the  importance  of  corporate  reputation. 
Despite  agreement  on  the  importance  of 
corporate reputation, considerable variation 
exists in its deﬁ nition ( Coombs and Holladay, 
2002 ;  Fombrun and Shanley, 1990 ;  Fombrun 
 et al. , 2000 ;  Gotsi and Wilson, 2001 ;  Rindova 
 et   al. ,  2005 ).  Reviewing  over  60  studies 
from  six  different  scholarly  disciplines, 
 Rindova  et al.  (2005)  concluded that schol-
ars have deﬁ ned reputation as assessments of 
particular attributes or collective knowledge 
about  or  recognition  of  a  ﬁ rm.  They  syn-
thesized  and  summarized  these  deﬁ nitions 
to conceptualize organizational reputation as 
comprising  two  dimensions:  stakeholders ’  
perceptions of quality for speciﬁ c attributes 
evaluated in the context of the ﬁ rm and the 
degree to which the ﬁ rm receives large-scale 
collective recognition. 

 While  large-scale  collective  recognition 
can be conceptualized as extensive coverage 
of a ﬁ rm in the media, stakeholders ’  evalu-
ative  perceptions  can  be  described  as  atti-
tudes  ( Rosenberg  and  Hovland,  1960 ). 
Attitudes have been deﬁ ned as psychological 
tendencies  that  are  expressed  by  evaluating 
a  particular  entity  with  some  degree  of 
favor or disfavor ( Eagly and Chaiken, 1993 ). 
According  to  psychologists,  the  evaluative 
component of an attitude comprises cogni-
tive, affective and behavioral responses (eg, 
 Katz  and  Stotland,  1959 ;   Rosenberg  and 
Hovland, 1960  cited in  Eagly and Chaiken, 
1993 ). Responses of the cognitive type are 
often conceptualized as beliefs, where beliefs 
are  associations  people  establish  between 
the  attitude  object  (eg,  a  ﬁ rm)  and  various 
attributes (eg, product quality) ( Fishbein and 
Ajzen,  1975 ).  Evaluative  responses  of  the 
affective type consist of feelings and emotions 
and  the  behavioral  responses  consist  of  the 
overt actions (eg, buying a product) that peo-
ple exhibit in relation to the attitude object. 

 When  referring  to  corporate  reputation, 
we prefer to restrict the concept to the cog-
nitive and affective responses of the attitude. 
The  behavior  a  person  exhibits  as  well  as 
the intention to behave in relation to a ﬁ rm 
shall not be regarded as part of the reputation 
but rather as its desired outcome or ultimate 
goal  the  ﬁ rm  wants  to  achieve  with  its 
stakeholders  (eg,  buying,  applying,  labor-
ing). Based on empirical research, Fombrun 
and colleagues (eg,  Fombrun and Gardberg, 
2000 ;   Fombrun   et  al. ,  2000 )  conclude  that 
people evaluate companies on ﬁ ve cognitive 
dimensions (products and services, ﬁ nancial 
performance, management ’ s vision and lead-
ership,  workplace  environment,  corporate 
social responsibility) as well as one emotional 
dimension (emotional appeal). Each dimension 
is again qualiﬁ ed by various attributes.   

 Hierarchy of Effects 
  Ray (1973)  proposed in his learning hierar-
chy model, which was essentially an exten-
sion of the model proposed by  Lavidge and 
Steiner  (1961) ,  that  for  high  involvement 
products (such as automobiles) the consum-
er is obligated to enter into a learning proc-
ess of ﬁ rst thinking (cognition) then feeling 
(affect) before acting (behavior) in order to 
make  a  satisfying  choice.  Applying  Ray ’ s 
model to corporate reputation, we postulate 
a hierarchy of effects in a way that the cog-
nitive  reputation  dimensions  precede  and 
inﬂ uence the affective dimension, which in 
turn  can  have  an  impact  on  a  person ’ s 
behavioral  intention  and  behavior.  Hence, 
the affective reputation dimension takes on 
the role as mediator between cognition and 
behavior. 

 According  to  this  learning  hierarchy 
model,  the  affective  dimension  is  generally 
important for eliciting a behavioral response. 
The  importance  of  the  different  cognitive 
reputation  dimensions  that  precede  affect, 
however,  depends  on  the  interests  and 
needs of a particular stakeholder group. For 
investors,  for  example,  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  ﬁ nancial

performance and strategy is more important 
than  it  is  for  its  customers,  who  should  be 
particularly interested in the ﬁ rm ’ s products 
and services.  ‘ Importance ’  is considered one 
component  of  attitude  strength.  Strong 
attitudes  have  signiﬁ cant  impact  on  cogni-
tive and affective processes and are powerful 
determinants of behavior ( Petty and Krosnick, 
1995 ).  Therefore,  we  derive  the  rather 
obvious  assumption  that  those  cognitive 
reputation dimensions that are important to 
a  person  exert  a  stronger  inﬂ uence  on  the 
affective dimension and stakeholders ’  behav-
ioral  intentions  than  those  that  are  not  so 
important.  We  propose 
following 
hypothesis: 

the 

  H1:         Cognitive reputation dimensions that are 
considered important by stakeholders exert 
a stronger inﬂ uence on the affective repu-
tation dimension and stakeholders ’  behav-
ioral  intentions  than  cognitive  reputation 
dimensions  that  are  considered  not  so 
important.  

 The question arises as to how the corpo-
rate  reputation  is  formed  in  the  minds  of 
a  ﬁ rm ’ s  stakeholders?  Personal  experience 
is  often  considered  a  powerful  source  for 
attitude  formation  (eg,   Fazio  and  Zanna, 
1981 ). However, not all reputation dimen-
sions  can  easily  be  experienced  in  person 
(eg,  ﬁ nancial  performance);  thus,  people 
often generate attitudes about a ﬁ rm without 
ever having had direct personal contact with 
it  or  any  of  its  products,  services  or  repre-
sentatives.  Information  from  other  sources 
besides  direct  experience  is  important  for 
the formation of attitudes and, consequent-
ly,  reputation.  Third-party  sources  like  the 
news  media  are  considered  particularly 
inﬂ uential  ( Carroll  and  McCombs,  2003 ; 
 Kiousis   et  al. ,  2007  and  Sternthal   et  al ., 
1978 ). The circumstances under which the 
news media exert an inﬂ uence on corporate 
reputation are discussed next.   

 Contingent Conditions of the News 
Media ’ s Inﬂ uence on Reputation 
 Two  theoretical  perspectives  that  explain 
contingent  media  inﬂ uences  on  corporate 
reputation  are  media  system  dependency 
theory  ( Ball-Rokeach  and  DeFleur,  1976 ) 
and  need  for  orientation  ( Weaver,  1980 ). 
We  describe  each  and  then  formulate  a 
hypothesis  about  contingent  conditions  of 
the  news  media ’ s  inﬂ uence  on  corporate 
reputation.  

theory 

system  dependency 

 Media system dependency theory 
 Media 
(eg, 
 Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur, 1976 ) proposes 
an  integral  relationship  among  audiences, 
the  news  media  and  the  larger  social 
and  economic  system.  Ball-Rokeach  and 
DeFleur deﬁ ne dependency as  ‘ a relationship 
in  which  the  satisfaction  of  needs  or  the 
attainment of goals by one party is contin-
gent  upon  the  resources  of  another  party ’  
(p. 6). 

 Firms,  as  part  of  the  economic  system, 
depend upon the news media to reach their 
stakeholders  and  to  foster  their  reputation 
among those individuals or groups who con-
tribute  to  its  wealth-creating  capacity  and 
activities.  Firms  depend  upon  the  news 
media in particular for the dissemination of 
such  information  that  cannot  be  directly 
experienced through consumption or inter-
action  and  that  lacks  credibility  when 
communicated  by  the  ﬁ rms  themselves. 
Communication  about  socially  responsible 
corporate  activities  is  a  good  example  for 
such information. The news media, on the 
other  hand,  depend  on  ﬁ rms  for  content 
that  is  of  interest  to  their  audiences,  and 
oftentimes  they  rely  on  ﬁ rms  to  make 
revenues from advertising. 

 Media system dependency theory outlines 
the  media  dependence  of  individuals  to 
reach  their  personal  goals  ( Ball-Rokeach, 
1985 ).   DeFleur  and  Ball-Rokeach  (1989)  
propose three fundamental goals individuals

 Einwiller, Carroll and Korn 

 Demers   et  al.   (1989)   call  such  aspects 
audience  members  have  not  that  directly 
experienced   ‘ unobtrusive ’ .  Media  depen-
dence  on  unobtrusive  dimensions  should 
be  particularly  pronounced  if  stakeholders 
ﬁ nd  them  important  and  thus  have  the 
goal  to  learn  about  how  ﬁ rms  behave  in 
relation to them.   

 Need for orientation 
 In  a  separate  line  of  research  examining 
contingent  conditions  of  agenda-setting, 
 Weaver  (1980)   argued  that  individuals ’  
need for orientation affects the inﬂ uence of 
media  salience.  In  Weaver ’ s  typology,  a 
high  level  of  interest  in  the  subject  of  a 
message  (eg,  social  responsibility)  coupled 
with  a  high  level  of  uncertainty  regarding 
this subject (eg, the company ’ s behavior or 
stance  toward  social  responsibility)  pro-
duces a strong need for orientation. A mod-
erate  level  of  need  for  orientation  is 
produced  by  either  the  condition  of  high 
interest and low uncertainty or the condi-
tion  of  low  interest  and  high  uncertainty. 
Then, ﬁ nally, the condition of low interest 
combined  with  either  a  low  level  of  un-
certainty  or  a  high  level  of  certainty  pro-
duces  a  low  level  of  need  for  orientation. 
Certainly individuals ’  levels of relevance or 
uncertainty  could  independently  predict 
individuals ’  
seeking  about 
companies ’   behavior  or  stances  on  issues, 
but combining the two variables into a sin-
gle  construct  offers  theoretical  parsimony 
with a wide range of applications ( Weaver 
1980 ) (see  Table 1 ). 

information 

 With  respect  to  media  dependency ’ s 
inﬂ uence  on  individuals ’   attitudes  and  be-
havior  we  cite   Ball-Rokeach  and  DeFleur 
(1976)   who  argue:   ‘ The  greater  the  need 
[to gain information on a certain reputation 
dimension]  and  consequently  the  stronger 
the  dependency 
the 
greater  the  likelihood  that  the  information 
supplied will alter various forms of audience

aim to achieve: understanding (eg, knowing 
about and interpreting ﬁ rms ’  activities), ori-
entation (eg, getting hints on where to buy 
or  work),  and  play  (eg,  having  fun  using 
a  ﬁ rm ’ s  products).   Figure  1   depicts  the 
dependencies  between  ﬁ rms,  the  news 
media and stakeholders. 

 Depending  on  stakeholders ’   goals,  their 
dependence  on  different  sources  and  con-
tents of business media coverage varies.  Fry 
and McCain (1983)  state that media depend-
ence  is  different   ‘ from  condition  to  condi-
tion and from audience segment to audience 
segment ’   (p.  542).  We  argue  that,  ﬁ rstly, 
media  dependence 
is  contingent  upon 
stakeholders ’   goals  concerning  what  they 
want  to  learn  about  a  ﬁ rm,  that  is  what 
reputation  dimensions  they  ﬁ nd  important. 
Potential  employees,  for  example,  have  an 
interest  in  learning  about  the  workplace 
conditions of a ﬁ rm, whereas investors ’  main 
goal  is  to  understand  its  ﬁ nancial  perform-
ance.  Secondly,  media  dependence  is  con-
tingent  upon  whether  the  news  media  are 
the only source or one of a few sources from 
which to obtain the information of interest. 
For example, whereas many ﬁ rms ’  products 
are  available  for  personal  inspection  and 
experience (eg, cars, food, clothes, ie so-called 
search  goods;   Nelson,  1970 ),  information 
on corporate strategy or social responsibility 
is  usually  not  easily  experienced  in  person.

formulate our second hypothesis: 

  H2 :        News media inﬂ uence on corporate repu-
tation is particularly pronounced for those 
reputation  dimensions  that  are  regarded 
as  important  by  stakeholders   and   that 
are  difﬁ cult  to  personally  inspect  or 
experience. 

 METHODOLOGY  

 Context of the Study 
 The  empirical  research  was  conducted  in 
Germany  using  a  prominent  automobile 
company as research object. The automobile 
industry is one of the most important indus-
tries  for  the  German  economy.  According 
to  the  German  Federal  Ministry  of  Eco-
nomics and Technology, every seventh job 
in  the  country  is  directly  or  indirectly 
connected with automobiles.  1   Firms in this 
sector, especially the car producers, are fre-
quently covered in the regional and nation-
al  news  media.  Thus,  our  research  object 
scores  high  on  the  reputation  component 
 ‘ large-scale collective recognition ’  suggested 
by  Rindova  et al.  (2005) . 

 To  test  the  proposed  hypotheses,  two 
types  of  data  were  generated:  survey  data 

and  news  reports.  Previous  research  has 
either  measured  corporate  reputation  as 
one-dimensional ( Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis, 
2006 ) or has aggregated the dimensions into 
an  index  score  ( Kiousis   et  al.   2007 ).  Our 
study  improves  on  previous  research  by 
measuring  news  media  content  about  our 
focal organization matched to the exact same 
dimensions of corporate reputation in stake-
holder  attitudes.  Speciﬁ cally,  news  reports 
on the focal ﬁ rm were coded on the exact 
same  cognitive  reputation  dimensions  that 
were evaluated by respondents in a survey.
This synchronized methodology is a central 
and  unique  element  of  our  research  pre-
sented  here;  it  enables  us  to  gauge  inﬂ u-
ences  of  media  coverage  on  a  particular 
reputation  dimension  on  stakeholder  per-
ceptions on the very same reputation dimen-
sion. Although we were able to use the news 
media  analyses  generated  by  a  professional 
media research ﬁ rm, we conducted original 
survey work among university students.   

 Survey Measures  

reputation 

 Corporate reputation 
 To  develop  a  valid  and  reliable  instrument 
to  measure  the  reputation  of  the  focal 
automobile company we followed a process 
to  measure  latent  constructs  suggested  by 
 Homburg and Giering (1996) . We drew on 
previous  corporate 
research 
and  theory  ( Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990 ; 
 Fombrun  et al. , 2000 ) and conducted inter-
views  with  industry  experts  to  deﬁ ne  the 
reputation dimensions and to generate poten-
tial attributes for measuring those dimensions. 
All  potential  attributes  were  compiled  into 
a  questionnaire.  Independent  judges  (ten 
academics and 30 industry executives) eval-
uated the attributes concerning their ﬁ t with 
the  respective  dimension  as  well  as  ease  of 
responding to them. 

 The  ﬁ nal  instrument  contained  29  att-
ributes to measure ﬁ ve cognitive dimensions 
and  one  affective  dimension  of  corporate

ributes were:

ers, strong brands, fascinating products), 
  innovativeness   (eg,  leader  in  R & D,  best 
innovation for customers, promising prod-
uct pipeline, seminal technologies, innova-
tive potential), 
  social  and  environmental  responsibility   (eg, 
commitment  for  environment,  environ-

petent  top  management,  clear  vision  for 
future, 
leveraging  opportunities,  path 
breaking, convincing strategy), 
  ﬁ nancial performance  (eg, good ﬁ nancial per-
formance,  ﬁ nancially  strong,  ﬁ nancially 
sound, leading role), and 
  emotional appeal  (eg, like ﬁ rm, respect ﬁ rm, 
enthusiastic about ﬁ rm, trust ﬁ rm).   

 In  the  survey,  respondents  were  asked  to 
give their detailed evaluations on the different 
attributes  on  a  scale  from  one   ‘ completely 
disagree ’  to seven  ‘ completely agree ’ .   

 Importance of reputation dimensions 
 To  assess  the  perceived  importance  of  the 
cognitive  reputation  dimensions,  respond-
ents were asked,  ‘ If you judge the reputation 
of  a  company,  how  important  are  the  fol-
lowing  aspects  for  you? ’   The  item  used  a 
7-point scale ranging from 1 ( not important ) 
to 7 ( very important ). The dimension  ‘ prod-
ucts and services ’  was considered most im-
portant  to  the  survey  respondents  when 
judging 
the  reputation  of  a  company 
( M     =    6.29,  SD     =    1.12), followed by  ‘ innova-
tiveness ’   ( M      =     5.62,   SD     =    1.39),   ‘ emotional 
appeal ’   ( M     =    5.38,   SD     =    1.56)  and   ‘ social 
and environmental responsibility ’  ( M     =    5.30, 
 SD     =    1.41).  Least 
the 
 ‘ management  and  corporate 
dimensions 

important  were 

 Information search behavior 
 We asked, how little (1) to how much (7) 
respondents used different sources to gather 
information  on  the  focal  company.  The 
third-party  information  sources  prompted 
were: advertising, reports on TV, articles in 
the daily press, articles in printed magazines, 
online  news,  personal  private  contacts  and 
personal business contacts. Respondents fur-
thermore  indicated  their  print  media  usage 
by  listing  those  titles  (dailies  and  weeklies) 
they  used  frequently  to  gather  information 
on business corporations and business topics. 
Respondents reported to have gathered most 
information about the focal company through 
advertising  ( M     =    5.21,   SD     =    1.56),  reports 
on  TV  ( M     =    4.85,   SD     =    1.57),  the  daily 
press  ( M     =    4.66,   SD     =    1.67)  and  magazines 
( M     =    4.63,   SD     =    1.71).  Of  less  importance 
are  personal  private  contacts  ( M     =    4.16, 
 SD     =    2.17),  online  news  ( M     =    3.27,   SD     =    
1.91) and personal business contacts ( M     =    2.65, 
 SD     =    2.10). This data on respondents ’  print 
media  usage  later  allowed  us  to  match  the 
analysis  from  the  newspaper  or  magazine 
used  most  frequently  by  stakeholders  with 
their  respective  evaluations  of  reputation 
attributes.   

 Behavioral intentions 
 Furthermore, two forms of behavioral inten-
tions were measured: purchasing one of the 
ﬁ rm ’ s  products  and  applying  for  a  job  at 
the  ﬁ rm.  Each  intention  was  measured  by 
assessing  the  likelihood  to  conduct  the 
respective  behavior  oneself  and  to  recom-
mend it to a close friend (1  ‘ very unlikely ’  
to 7  ‘ very likely ’ ).

seven  major  regional  and  geographically 
distributed  German  universities.  The  uni-
versities  were  selected  because  they  were 
regionally dispersed, covering six major eco-
nomic regions of the country and ﬁ ve of the 
seven  Nielsen  areas.  The  market  research 
ﬁ rm  ACNielsen  breaks  up  the  country  of 
Germany  into  seven  areas  that  share  a 
similar economic structure, culture and con-
sumer  behavior.  University  students  are 
an important stakeholder group for the focal 
company,  not  just  as  current  or  potential 
customers  but  also  as  potential  employees 
and  future  opinion  leaders.  There  was  an 
even  distribution  of  gender  (51  percent 
male,  49  percent  female)  and  ﬁ elds  of 
study (29 percent social sciences and human-
ities,  26  percent  economics  and  business, 
18  percent  engineering,  29  percent  natural 
sciences  and  5  percent  other).  The  vast 
majority (96 percent) was younger than 30 
years old. 

 For   H2 ,  we  excluded  72  of  the  295 
respondents  who  either  did  not  frequently 
use  any  print  medium  at  all  or  frequently 
used  a  print  medium  for  which  no  coding 
had  been  conducted.  This  was  to  make 
sure  that  only  those  respondents  who  used 
the  print  titles  analyzed  were  included  in 
the  analysis.  Furthermore,  49  respondents 
who claimed to have gathered little informa-
tion  about  the  focal  company  from  the 
daily press or magazines (scale points 1 – 4 on 
the scale from 1  ‘ very little ’  to 7  ‘ very much ’ ) 
were also excluded from the analyses. 

 Students  were  approached  in  university 
restaurants or cafeterias at the different loca-
tions to participate in a survey on the repu-
tation  of  business  corporations.  Interviews 
were  conducted  in  person  by  means  of  a 
standardized  questionnaire.  After  the  inter-
view, the respondents were given a choco-
late  bar  of  about   $ 1  value  and  debriefed 
about the study. Respondents were told that 
the study was about the reputation of auto-
mobile  ﬁ rms  with  attention  to  one  focal 
company.    

 Secondary Media Analysis of 
News Reports 
 For  H2 , examining the relationship between 
organizations ’  news coverage and corporate 
reputation, we drew on the content analysis 
about  the  focal  company ’ s  newspaper  and 
magazine coverage conducted by the com-
munication research ﬁ rm PRIME Research. 
The news stories were in German. We used 
print media because they were readily avail-
able,  but  also  because  about  73  percent  of 
the  German  population  over  the  age  of 
14  regularly  read  a  newspaper.  In  the  age 
group 20 – 29 years, 59 percent claim to do 
so ( Pasquay, 2007 ). Furthermore, newspaper 
readers have been shown to possess a great-
er  capacity  for  recall  than  those  listening 
to  radio  or  watching  television  ( DeFleur  
et al. , 1992 ). 

 The print media data covered a time span 
of  11  months  just  before  the  survey.  In 
agenda-setting research, scholars have found 
effects from a few days ( Zucker, 1978 ), over 
ﬁ ve months ( Kiousis and McCombs, 2004 ), 
to  up  to  one  year  of  coverage  before  the 
survey  ( Meijer  and  Kleinnijenhuis,  2006 ). 
As  corporate  reputation  does  not  develop  
ad  hoc   but  over  a  longer  period  of  time 
(eg,   Bromley,  1993 ;   Fombrun,  1996 ),  we 
used  news  reports  covering  a  period  of 
11 months preceding the survey. Choosing 
this  rather  long  time  span  corresponds  to 
 Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis ’ s (2006)  design in 
which the dependent variable was, as in our 
research, corporate reputation.  

 Newspapers and magazines 
 For the analyses, we focused on the data for 
those  newspapers  and  magazines  survey 
respondents claimed to use most frequently 
to  gather  information  on  business  corpora-
tions and business topics (question asked in 
the survey; see above). This resulted in a list 
of 20 print media titles, 13 daily newspapers, 
three  weekly / Sunday  newspapers  and  four 
weekly  magazines.  Of  the  20  titles,  eight 
were national, seven regional and ﬁ ve were

ﬁ rm ’ s  news  coverage  referred  to  the  ﬁ rm ’ s 
 ‘ innovativeness ’ .   

 Cognitive reputation dimensions 
 For  each  cognitive  reputation  dimension, 
coders were provided with a list of possible 
content  subsumed  under  the  dimension. 
These  content  lists  contained  all  of  the 
aspects  covered  by  the  indicators  used  to 
measure  the  reputation  dimensions  in  the 
survey. Over the 11-month coding period, 
a  total  of  13,586  units  were  coded  on  one 
of the ﬁ ve cognitive reputation dimensions. 
Hereof, most coverage referred to  ‘ products 
and  services ’   (47  percent),  followed  by 
 ‘ management  and  corporate  strategy ’   (31 
percent),   ‘ ﬁ nancial  performance ’   (14  per-
cent) and  ‘ social and environmental respon-
sibility ’   (7  percent).  Only  1  percent  of  the 

 Tone for cognitive reputation 
dimension 
 The tone for each dimension was rated on 
a scale from     −    3 (very negative) to     +    3 (very 
positive).  Zero  was  ambivalent;  and  nine 
was  coded  as  neutral,  but  it  was  excluded 
from the analyses.

variance-based structural equation modeling 
(SEM). SEM is used extensively particularly 
in  marketing  research  to  analyze  the  inter-
relationships  between  latent  constructs  (eg, 
 Bagozzi,  1980 ).  Data  were  analyzed  using 
the software package SmartPLS 2.0 ( Ringle 
 et al. , 2005 ). In a ﬁ rst step, the measurement 
models  for  each  of  the  constructs  (reputa-
tion  dimensions  and  behavioral  intentions) 
were assessed for reliability and validity (see 
 Table 3 ). 

 The  measured  constructs  rendered  satis-
factory  results  on  all  aspects.  The  indicator 
loadings are above the recommended thresh-
old  of  0.60  (eg,   Bagozzi  and  Baumgartner, 
1994 ) and signiﬁ cant. Signiﬁ cance was esti-
mated  using  the  bootstrapping  procedure 
( Efron  and  Tibshirani,  1993 ).  All   t -values 
were  greater  than  1.96  indicating  that  all 
indicator-construct-relations  are  signiﬁ cant 
at  p     <    0.01. For all constructs, the composite 
reliability  exceeds  0.8,  Cronbach ’ s  alpha  is 
larger  than  0.7,  and  the  average  variance 
extracted  (AVE)  is  greater  than  0.50  (eg, 
 Hair   et  al. ,  1992 ).  Furthermore,  the  AVE 
measures  for  any  two  constructs  that  are 
related  in  the  model  exceed  their  squared 
correlations  indicating  discriminant  validity 
( Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ). 

 In  a  next  step,  we  tested  the  structural 
model.  Signiﬁ cance  of  the  regression  coef-
ﬁ cients  was  again  assessed  using  the  boot-
strapping  procedure.  In  line  with   H1 ,  the 
reputation  dimensions   ‘ products  and  serv-
ices ’  and  ‘ social and environmental respon-
sibility ’ ,  which  are  considered  particularly 
important  by  the  respondents  exert  a  sig-
niﬁ cant  inﬂ uence  on   ‘ emotional  appeal ’ , 
which is in turn strongly related to  ‘ intention 
to  purchase ’   and   ‘ intention  to  apply ’ .  The 
paths connecting the less important dimen-
sions   ‘ management  and  corporate  strategy ’  
and   ‘ emotional  appeal ’   is  only  marginally 
signiﬁ cant  and 
 ‘ ﬁ nancial 
performance ’ ,  which  is  considered  least 
important,  on   ‘ emotional  appeal ’   is  non-
signiﬁ cant. 

the  effect  of 

 Contrary to our hypothesis,  ‘ innovativeness ’  
that  is  the  second  most  important  dimen-
sion,  had  no  direct  effect  on   ‘ emotional 
appeal ’ .  An  explanation  can  be  found  in 
innovation literature (eg, Tidd, Bessant, and 
Pavitt, 2005), where innovativeness is con-
sidered  a  prerequisite  for  manufacturing 
innovative products. We modiﬁ ed the struc-
tural  model  respectively  and  modeled  a 
path from  ‘ innovativeness ’  to  ‘ products and 
services ’   instead  of  to  emotional  appeal  di-
rectly.  The  relationship  registered  highly 
signiﬁ cant  and  so  did  the  indirect  effect  of 
 ‘ innovativeness ’   on   ‘ emotional  appeal ’ .  All 
direct  and  indirect  effects  of  the  structural 
model are depicted in  Table 4 . 

 A  central  criterion  for  evaluating  the 
structural model is the rate of reliability R 2  
of  the  endogenous  constructs   ‘ job  applica-
tion  intention ’   and   ‘ purchase  intention ’ .  2   
The  results  of  R 2   indicate  that  31  percent 
of the variance of  ‘ job application intention ’  
and 39 percent of the variance of  ‘ purchase 
intention ’   is  explained  by  the  preceding 
exogenous  variables.  Furthermore,  61  per-
cent  of  the  variance  of   ‘ emotional  appeal ’  
is explained by the cognitive reputation di-
mensions  and   ‘ innovativeness ’   explains  45 
percent  of   ‘ products  and  services ’ .  All  of 
those  values  are  above  the  recommended 
threshold of 0.3 ( Huber  et al. , 2007 ). 

  H2:         Contingent conditions of the news media. 

  H2  asserted that the news media ’ s inﬂ u-
ence  on  stakeholders ’   perceptions  is  more 
pronounced  when  the  news  coverage  is 
about reputation dimensions that stakehold-
ers  deem  important  to  their  evaluations  of 
reputation  and  these  same  dimensions  are 
difﬁ cult to personally inspect or experience. 
To analyze  H2 , we linked the news reports 
and the survey data. Because the print me-
dia  usage  of  each  respondent  was  known, 
we  were  able  to  match  the  news  reports 
with  the  survey  responses  according  to

ciﬁ cally,  for  each  respondent,  we  inserted 
the  coding  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  media  favorability

into his or her individual datasets. Thereby,

individual  differences 

took 

 In a ﬁ rst step, we ran correlations between 
the tone of the organization ’ s news coverage 
on the cognitive reputation dimensions and 
the respondents ’  evaluations of the ﬁ rm on 
the different dimensions.  3   The news media 
hardly  covered  the  ﬁ rm  concerning  its 
 ‘ innovativeness ’ ;  some  of  the  print  media 
did  not  cover  that  dimension  at  all  in  the 
11-month period. Thus, the tone of cover-
age  on  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  innovativeness  could  not 
be  used  as  a  variable  in  the  analyses.  Apart 
from  correlations,  we  conducted  multiple 
regression  analyses  with  the  tone  of  the 
organization ’ s news coverage on the cognitive 
reputation  dimensions  (except  for   ‘ innova-
tiveness ’ ) as predictors and survey responses 
on  the  different  dimensions  as  criterion 
variables. 

 The only signiﬁ cant effects that emerged 
from  correlation  analyses  were  between 
the tone of the organization ’ s news coverage 
on  the  ﬁ rm ’ s   ‘ social  and  environmental 

responsibility ’  and students ’  evaluations of the 
ﬁ rm  on   ‘ social  and  environmental  responsi-
bility ’ ,  ‘ products and services ’ ,  ‘ management 
and  corporate  strategy ’ ,  and 
 ‘ emotional 
appeal ’  (see  Table 5 ). There were no signiﬁ -
cant  correlations  between  the  tone  of  the 
organization ’ s  news  coverage  on  any  of 
the  other  dimensions  and  students ’   evalua-
tions of the ﬁ rm on the reputation dimen-
sions.  Regression  analyses  backed 
the 
ﬁ nding that only the tone of the organiza-
tion ’ s  news  coverage  on  the  ﬁ rm ’ s   ‘ social 
and  environmental  responsibility ’   is  able 
to  predict  some  of  the  variance  in  the 
dependent  variables.  Using  the  stepwise 
method, a signiﬁ cant model emerged for three 
criteria:   ‘ products  and  services ’   ( F   (1,172)
    =    3.95,  p     <    0.048, Adjusted R 2     =    0.02),  ‘ social 
and environmental responsibility ’  ( F  (1,172)

dimensions  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation.  More 
importantly, we show that those dimensions 
that  our  student  respondents  considered 
most  important  (eg,  products  and  services 
and social and environmental responsibility) 
had a signiﬁ cant direct or indirect effect on 
their  emotions  and  behavioral  intentions. 
The  emotional  appeal  of  the  ﬁ rm  in  turn, 
which was also considered important by the 
students, had a strong impact on their inten-
tion to buy a product or to apply for a job 
at the car manufacturer. In contrast, dimen-
sions that were regarded not very important 
(eg,  management  and  corporate  strategy, 
ﬁ nancial  performance)  did  neither  directly 
nor  indirectly  impact  on  emotions  and 
intentions to apply or purchase. 

 As argued in the theoretical section above, 
individuals ’   goals  and  their  need  to  learn 

about certain aspects of a ﬁ rm drive media 
dependency. In our case, the media depend-
ency  of  our  student  respondents  to  learn 
about the ﬁ rm ’ s  ‘ management and corporate 
strategy ’  and  ‘ ﬁ nancial performance ’  is rath-
er  low  because  of  limited  interest.  In  con-
trast,  learning  about  the  dimensions  that 
are of interest (eg, products and services or 
social and environmental responsibility) can 
be considered a declared goal of the student 
stakeholders. So, how great is an individual ’ s 
dependency  on  the  news  media  to  learn 
about these important dimensions? 

 As cars can be inspected every day on the 
streets and tested before purchase (ie, a typ-
ical  search  good),  media  dependency  to 
learn  about  a  car  manufacturer ’ s  products 
should be rather low. As a ﬁ rm ’ s innovative-
ness  is  at  least  in  part  reﬂ ected  in  their

 Media and Reputation 

products, media dependency to learn about 
a  car  company ’ s  innovativeness  should  also 
be  limited.  How  the  car  manufacturer  acts 
with respect to its social and environmental 
responsibility,  however,  is  more  difﬁ cult 
to  observe  in  everyday  life,  it  is  rather 
unobtrusive. Firms might claim responsible 
behavior  in  their  advertising  or  annual 
reports, but learning about it by independent 
third parties, like the news media, is much 
more credible ( Dawkins, 2005 ). 

 Our  ﬁ ndings  show  that  only  the  media 
salience  on  the  dimension  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  
‘ social and environmental responsibility ’  had 
a  signiﬁ cant  relationship  with  the  respond-
ents ’  evaluation of the ﬁ rm on this very same 
dimension.  Moreover,  media  salience  on 
this  dimension  was  related  to  respondents ’  
evaluation  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  products  and  serv-
ices  and  their  affective  reaction.  We  con-
clude  that  these  correlations  result  from 
the student stakeholders ’  media dependency, 
their need for orientation, and consequent-
ly media awareness concerning information 
on  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  social  responsibility.  This 
media dependency enhanced the likelihood 
that  information  on  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  responsible 
behavior  altered  stakeholders ’   cognitions, 
feelings and behavior.   

 GENERAL DISCUSSION AND 
CONCLUSION 
 With  the  research  presented  here,  we 
unveiled  one  important  caveat  overlooked 
in  previous  research:  the  role  of  differenti-
ated  dependency  of  stakeholders  on  the 
different dimensions of corporate reputation. 
Only  information  about  a  ﬁ rm  for  which 
individuals  depend  on  the  news  media 
to learn about has an inﬂ uence on stakehold-
ers ’   evaluations  of  the  ﬁ rm.  An  important 
element  in  revealing  those  differentiated 
effects was the development of an integrat-
ed  and  novel  method  for  measuring  the 
tone of ﬁ rms ’  news coverage along the same 
dimensions  as  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation  and 

gathering 
individual media usage. 

information  on 

stakeholders ’  

 We  interpret  the  ﬁ ndings  as  evidence 
supportive  of  media  system  dependency 
theory  and  need  for  orientation:  Whereas 
individuals are not dependent on the news 
media to gather information on automobile 
products  (because  individuals  see  them  on 
the  streets  everyday),  they  are  dependent 
thereon  to  learn  about  ﬁ rms ’   social  and 
environmental responsibility. Consequently, 
the way in which the news media covered 
the  focal  ﬁ rm  on  this  dimension  related  to 
stakeholders ’  evaluations of the ﬁ rm on this 
dimension. 

 The  results  bear  important  implications 
for corporate reputation management: Firms 
are  advised  to  be  aware  of  and  systemati-
cally  analyze  their  stakeholders ’   need  for 
orientation and media dependencies. Which 
reputation  dimensions  are  important  to 
stakeholders  and  for  which  dimensions  do 
they  need  the  news  media  to  learn  about 
them? This knowledge is essential in devel-
oping ﬁ rms ’  media strategies for enhancing 
corporate reputation. It shows communica-
tion  managers  which  dimensions 
they 
should place emphasis for enhancing evalu-
ative  perceptions  of  speciﬁ c  stakeholder 
groups,  thereby  rendering  media  relations 
more effective. For the ﬁ rm serving as our 
research case, we found that media salience 
was  highest  for  those  dimensions  where 
the  student  respondents ’   dependency  was 
lowest  (products  and  services,  management 
and  corporate  strategy  and  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance).  Only  seven  percent  of  the 
total  coverage  referred  to  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  social 
and  environmental  responsibility.  Practical 
impli cations  are  obvious  in  that  efforts 
should  be  enhanced  to  attain  more  news 
coverage  by  strengthening  the  news  value 
of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  accomplishments  in  social 
and environmental responsibility. Also, our 
results  suggest  that  the  makers  of  printed 
newspapers  and  magazines  could  increase 
the  attractiveness  of  their  products  for  a

younger audience by covering more content 
which is of interest to this younger audience,  
thereby  preventing  the  churn  rate  from 
increasing. 

 It  is  important  to  repeat  that  media  de-
pendency varies between stakeholder groups. 
Although the student respondents participat-
ing  in  the  survey  were  not  dependent  on 
the news media to learn about the manage-
ment  and  corporate  strategy  of  the  ﬁ rm, 
other  stakeholders  like  investors  or  politi-
cians  might  well  be.  Also,  media  depend-
ency is contingent upon the current situation 
a person is in. A student who is just about 
to  buy  a  new  car  will  have  a  greater  need 
for orientation and thus be more dependent 
on  the  media  to  learn  about  the  products 
of  a  car  company  than  the  student  who  is 
not  about  to  buy  a  car.  Media  relations 
and media planning have to take those con-
ditions  into  account  in  order  to  be  most 
effective. 

 With  the  research  presented,  we  extend 
the  knowledge  on  the  inﬂ uence  of  media 
coverage on corporate reputation by exam-
ining  some  of  the  contingent  conditions 
affecting  the  news  media ’ s  inﬂ uence  on 
corporate  reputation.  Moreover,  our  inte-
grated  measurement  approach  gauging 
media coverage and stakeholder evaluations 
on  the  same  dimensions  of  reputation  fur-
thered  the  methodological  approach  to 
this  research  area.  However,  the  need  for 
more  research  remains.  One  of  the  caveats 
in  existing  research  is  the  cross-sectional 
approach to our data collection that inhibits 
clearly drawn causal inferences. Experimen-
tal  research  can  prove  useful  to  analyze 
speciﬁ c  questions  on  the  directional  inﬂ u-
ence media coverage has on stakeholder at-
titudes. Also, the results of the study ought 
to be replicated with different ﬁ rms, indus-
tries  and  stakeholders.  Finally,  the  role  of 
different  types  of  media  over  and  above 
printed  newspapers  and  magazines  used 
in the present study is an important area to 
explore.

PLS does not generate measures for the global ﬁ t 
of  the  model. While  covariance-based  SEM  aims 
for  the  best  ﬁ t  of  the  empirical  with  the  hypo-

ances  of  the  dependent  variables,  similar  to 
regression analysis ( Wold, 1989 ). Therefore, in PLS 
the measure for goodness of ﬁ t of the model is the
