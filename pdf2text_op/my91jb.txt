 Why Investors Value
 Multinationality*

 I. Introduction

 A substantial portion of business activity is con-
 ducted by multinational firms. Yet relatively lit-
 tle is known about the value of multinationality
 to investors or even if multinationality does in
 fact add to share value. In this article, various
 theories linking multinationality to investment
 value are examined empirically. We begin by
 outlining the basic ideas behind each.

 1. The internalization theory. This theory
 posits that direct foreign investment occurs when
 a firm can increase its value by internalizing mar-
 kets for certain of its intangible assets.1 Such
 assets might include superior production skills,
 patents, marketing abilities, managerial skills, or
 consumer goodwill. These intangible assets have
 some characteristics of public goods in that their
 value is enhanced in direct proportion to the scale
 of the firm's markets. They are also based largely
 on proprietary information and thus cannot be

 We examine the value
 of multinationality to in-
 vestors as reflected in
 firms' q ratios. The pos-
 itive impact of research
 and development and
 advertising spending on
 a firm's q is enhanced
 by multinationality, but
 multinationality itself
 has no significant im-
 pact. This supports the
 internalization the-
 ory's prediction that in-
 tangible assets are nec-
 essary to justify direct
 foreign investment and,
 thus, a recent strand of
 trade literature that as-
 sumes multinational
 firms have intangible
 assets with public good
 properties. Our results
 do not support the hy-
 pothesis that investors
 value multinational
 firms as a means of di-
 versifying their portfo-
 lios internationally.

 exchanged at arm's length for a variety of reasons arising from the
 economics of information as well as from their public good properties.'
 A firm can bypass these transactions difficulties by internalizing the
 markets for such assets. It can enhance its value by expanding abroad
 and controlling foreign operations itself if the expected gains from
 applying the intangibles in a foreign market are sufficient to compen-
 sate for the higher costs of operating a foreign subsidiary. Direct for-
 eign investment thus takes place. The implication is, therefore, that
 multinational firms are firms possessing useful intangible assets, the
 value of which is proportional to the firms' degree of multinationality.3
 2. Imperfect world capital markets. Because of institutional con-
 straints on international capital flows, information asymmetries, or
 other reasons, investors may be prevented from optimally diversifying
 their portfolios internationally in a direct manner. Multinational firms
 offer shareholders international diversification opportunities via their
 direct investments abroad. This is thought by some to enhance their
 share prices at home relative to those of uninational firms.4

 3. Managerial objectives. Managers' objectives may differ from
 share-price maximization, the presumed objective of shareholders.
 There is a large literature in finance arguing that, the more complex
 the corporation, the more difficult it is for shareholders to monitor
 management's decisions.5 This leaves the managers of such firms more
 freedom to act in their own self-interest at the expense of shareholders.
 Multinational firms are arguably uniformly more complex than uni-
 national firms. Furthermore, top managers may favor international di-
 versification because it reduces firm-specific risk and adds to their
 prestige. These goals are likely of little importance to investors. This
 divergence of interests might ceteris paribus reduce the values of multi-
 nationals relative to uninationals.

 4. Tax avoidance and low-cost inputs. We also comment briefly on
 the popular views that multinationality raises the value of a firm be-
 cause it allows the firm more possibilities for tax avoidance and/or
 access to relatively low-cost inputs from abroad, especially from less
 developed countries.

 Briefly, our results are that there is strong evidence in favor of the

 2. See Caves (1986), ch. 1, for a more detailed explanation.
 3. Recent work has connected the internalization theory to trade theory. See, e.g.,
 Helpman (1984), Markusen (1984), Ethier (1986), and Horstman and Markusen (1987).
 These papers develop trade models based on the premise that multinational firms have
 a factor of production that behaves like a public good. Given the growing popularity of
 the internalization theory and the recent incorporation of it in trade theory, it is impor-
 tant to subject the idea to empirical investigation.

 internalization theory and little or no support for the alternatives listed
 above. We find that the degree of multinationality of a firm is positively
 correlated with market value as measured by Tobin's q.6 This suggests
 that the divergence-of-intereats problem of multinationals does not
 dominate other factors that distinguish them. We further find that this
 positive correlation is dependent on the extent of a firm's research and
 development or advertising spending. In other words, the impact of
 spending on these intangibles increases with the extent of a firm's
 multinationality. International diversification per se is not particularly
 valued by investors in the absence of these indicators of investment
 in intangibles and may sometimes even be perceived as a liability. This
 should not be the case if the value of multinationality were due to
 diversification, tax advantages, or lower production costs. It is, how-
 ever, entirely consistent with the internalization theory. Our results
 appear to be quite robust.

 II. Review of the Literature

 Our results are consistent with a number of earlier empirical studies
 of multinationals. Vaupel (1971), Vernon (1971), and Dunning (1973)
 find in simple descriptive studies that multinationals are larger, earn
 higher accounting profits, and spend more on research and develop-
 ment (R & D) and advertising. Using regression analysis, Horst (1972a,
 1972b), Caves (1974), Buckley and Casson (1976, ch. 4), Wolf (1977),
 Pugel (1978, ch. 4), and Dunning (1980) all find a positive relation
 between multinationality and proxies for intangible assets like R & D
 expenditure, advertising, and the proportion of scientists and engineers
 in total employment.

 These earlier studies rely on industry averages rather than individual
 firm data. Since the theoretical linkage between the possession of in-
 tangible assets and multinationality is based on a firm analysis, this is
 a critical problem.

 The value of multinationality to shareholders is not directly exam-
 ined in this earlier empirical literature. According to the internalization
 theory, a multinational firm has an advantage due to firm-specific intan-
 gible assets that allow it to overcome the adversity of doing business
 in a foreign location. If these assets are indeed information based, like
 production skills, marketing skills, and so on, then they behave like
 public goods in that their value increases as a firm becomes more

 6. Under the assumption of financial market efficiency, higher earnings (or costs)
 should be capitalized into share prices. Thus, past multinational expansion should be
 related to high share value (i.e., high q), not high current returns to shareholders. If
 multinational expansion took place before the firm's initial public offering, a high ratio
 of intangible to tangible assets need not imply that public shareholders ever enjoyed
 unusual returns.

 multinational. Therefore equity value should ceteris paribus be posi-
 tively correlated with degree of multinationality in the presence of
 such assets.

 This is a basic assumption underlying recent theoretical international
 trade articles by Helpman (1984), Markusen (1984), Ethier (1986), and
 Horstmann and Markusen (1987). One purpose of this article is to
 search for empirical evidence of such a relation.7

 Empirical evidence for the imperfect world capital market theory is
 less than clear-cut. If barriers to international capital flows prevent
 investors from moving their savings between nations, multinationals
 could provide a substitute means of achieving an optimal level of inter-
 national diversification. This could lead to higher share prices for mul-
 tinationals.8 Agmon and Lessard (1977) find that the rates of returns
 of firms with more sales generated outside the United States are less
 correlated with the U.S. market returns and are more correlated with
 foreign market returns. From this they conclude that investors recog-
 nize the international composition of the activities of U.S. corpora-
 tions. Unfortunately, their study does not shed light on the actual value
 of multinationality to investors because it is based on return data.
 Indeed, Brewer (1981) presents evidence that multinational and uni-
 national firms are on the same capital asset pricing model security line.
 Also, Jacquillat and Solnik (1978) present evidence that multinationals
 are not a good substitute for foreign stocks as a means of international
 diversification.

 Adler (1981) discusses the difficulty in using return data to gauge
 investors' valuation of international diversification through multina-
 tional firms' direct foreign investment. Using an event study, Fatemi
 (1984) shows that the cumulative abnormal return of multinational
 firms around the date of international expansion is positive but is rela-
 tively small when compared with, say, a merger.9 This result does not
 necessarily imply that there is value in international diversification at
 the firm level. For example, a compatible interpretation is that interna-
 tionalization is a positive signal.

 Errunza and Senbet (1981) find that "excess value" is significantly
 positively related to multinationality as measured by the fraction of
 sales due to foreign subsidiaries.10 Errunza and Senbet (1984) confirm

 7. This idea also leads some (e.g., Rugman 1987) to argue that returns on foreign

 direct investment are returns on services.

 8. Adler (1981) and Adler and Dumas (1983) argue that, even if investment markets
 are segmented, investors may still not attach value to any single multinational firm for
 the benefit of indirect international diversification. We return to this point below.

 9. In addition, Fatemi (1984) confirms the Agmon and Lessard (1977) finding and
 also concludes that risk-adjusted returns on multinational and uninational firms behave
 similarly.

 10. Excess value is defined as stock value minus accounting net worth normalized by

 sales.

 their earlier result using other measures of multinationality. A part of
 their latter result is puzzling: when multinationality is measured by
 the number of foreign subsidiaries, a significant negative relation links
 "excess value" and multinationality. Based on these results, they con-
 clude that "there is a valuation effect of international corporate diver-
 sification" and that "costless international corporate intermediation
 through foreign direct investment restores perfect market type results
 by undoing barriers to international capital flows faced by investors."11
 Kim and Lyn (1986) confirm the Errunza and Senbet (1981) study,
 adding R & D and advertising spending as controls and finding positive
 coefficients on these variables. These studies do not control for indus-
 try effects.

 Doukas and Travlos (1988) use an event study methodology to show
 that, when U.S. multinational firms make acquisitions in countries in
 which they have not previously been active, their shareholders gain.
 However, foreign acquisitions, like other complex takeover events,
 have effects that are likely to depend on the detailed financial charac-
 teristics of both the target and bidder (see Lang et al. 1989; Morck et
 al. 1989). Since this information is not readily available for foreign
 targets, basing inferences about the issues raised above on event study
 results is difficult. We therefore employ a cross-sectional approach
 despite the alternative set of difficulties it entails. Morck and Yeung
 (1980) explore these issues in an event study framework.

 In summary, both event study and cross-sectional study work sug-
 gest a link between multinationality and shareholder value. There also
 appears to be a correlation between multinationality and intangible
 assets. In the next section we explore possible reasons for multination-
 ality to affect share value, paying special attention to the role of intan-
 gibles.

 III. Methodology and Description of the Data

 The methodology used in this study builds from earlier studies of mar-
 ket valuation by Modigliani and Miller (1958), Tobin and Brainard
 (1977), and others. We begin with a basic assumption of financial mar-
 ket efficiency, namely, that the market value of a firm (V) is the sum
 of the value of its net tangible assets (T) and its net intangible assets
 (I). Thus,

 V = T +I. (1)

 The market value of a firm is defined as the market value of its
 outstanding common shares plus estimates of the market values of its

 preferred stock and its debt.12 The tangible assets variable is an esti-
 mate of the market value of the firm's plant and equipment plus an
 estimate of the value of its inventory.13 We use 1978 data because
 information about the multinationality and financial characteristics of
 the firms in our sample is most complete for that year.14

 We wish to understand whether multinationality should be consid-
 ered as one of the intangible assets making up I in equation (1). If we
 are to test for this, we must control for other obvious common intangi-
 ble assets. The two most obvious candidates are a stock of technical
 expertise and a stock of consumer goodwill. Research and develop-
 ment spending (RD) is used as a proxy for technical expertise, and
 advertising expenditures (ADV) as a proxy for consumer goodwill.15
 A leverage variable (DEBT) is included to proxy for any variation in
 firm values owing to differences in capital structure.16 We also wish to
 control for intangibles related to sheer size. Multinationals tend to be
 larger, so we must be careful to eliminate any effect owing solely to
 firm size if we are to isolate the impact of multinationality on value.
 To proxy for the value of intangibles related to size, we therefore
 include the value of tangible assets T. Thus we postulate that

 I = POT + JIMN + 32RD + I3ADV + 34DEBT + Y, (2)
 where MN is an as yet unidentified proxy for the dollar value of multi-

 12. The market value of the firms is obtained from the Griliches National Bureau of
 Economic Research (NBER) productivity project's data base as described in Cummins
 et al. (1982). The market value of the common stock is the price per share times the
 number of shares outstanding. The value of the preferred stock is estimated as the
 preferred dividends paid out during the year divided by the Moody's preferred dividend
 rate for medium-risk firms. The value of the firm's long-term debt is estimated by using
 an age-of-debt profile constructed using changes in book value of long-term debt in
 previous years and assuming that only 20-year bonds were issued. Moody's corporate
 BAA bond price series is then used to estimate the market value of the long-term debt.
 The market value of total debt is estimated as the estimated market value of long-term
 debt plus the book value of short-term debt minus the firm's net short-term assets. The
 underlying data are from Standard and Poor's Compustat data base.

 13. This variable is also from the Griliches NBER R & D Master File as described in
 Cummins et al. (1982). The average age of the firm's plant and equipment is deduced by
 dividing accumulated depreciation (gross plant minus net plant) by the current year's
 depreciation. A time series of these age figures is smoothed slightly and then used to
 adjust the book values reported on Compustat for inflation. The book value of the firm's
 inventories is used unless the firm specifies a last in, first out inventory accounting
 method. In that case, inventories are adjusted for inflation in a way analogous to the
 method used for plant and equipment. Again, all underlying data are from the Standard
 and Poor's Compustat tape.

 14. We also performed our basic tests (tables 2-5) using book value of tangible assets
 and a firm value estimate based on book debt and market value of equity. The results
 were qualitatively similar to those presented below.

 15. Research and development spending and advertising expenditures are taken from
 the Griliches NBER R & D Master File as described in Cummins et al. (1982). The
 values are taken from Standard and Poor's Compustat tape. Firms that fail to report
 these variables are assumed to engage in no research and development and advertising.

 16. The variable DEBT is equal to the estimated value of the firm's long-term debt as

 described in n. 12 above plus the book value of current liabilities.

 nationality to the firm. The term Y represents residual intangibles re-
 lated to other factors. Substituting (2) into (1) and dividing through the
 entire equation by T yields a basic equation relating a firm's q to the
 various intangibles as functions of the proxies listed above:

 q = P + Jlmn + j32rd + I3adv + 4debt + v, (3)
 where q is the market value of the firm (V) divided by the replacement
 cost of its tangible assets (T), and where rd, adv, and debt are equal
 to the corresponding variables in equation (2) per dollar of replacement
 cost of tangible assets.17 The variable mn is now assumed to contain
 the effect of multinationality in terms of adding to market value per
 dollar of replacement cost of tangible assets. The effect of scaling by
 T is to control for firm size in all the variables and thus hopefully limit
 problems due to heteroscedasticity in the residual u.

 In order to control for specific intangible assets related to certain
 lines of business, we also include a series of three-digit Standard Indus-
 trial Classification (SIC) code industry dummies (di). For example,
 publishing firms might be expected to have substantially more intangi-
 ble assets per dollar of physical assets than other firms. Because these
 SIC code dummies add up to a vector of ones, we drop the constant
 from our specification. Thus, the equation we employ in our regression
 analysis is

 n

 q = yidi + 31mn + 12rd + I3adv + 4debt + u. (4)

 i=1

 Equation (4) says that a firm's value to shareholders as measured
 by q is a function of its industry (measured by the indicator dummies
 {di}), its research and development spending (rd), its advertising (adv),
 its leverage (debt), and its degree of multinationality (mn).

 We have included the variable mn in equation (4) without specifying
 how to construct a measure of multinationality that would capture the
 effects of foreign direct investment on q. We shall begin with two basic
 measures to use for mn: the number of foreign subsidiaries the firm
 has (subs) and the number of foreign nations in which it has subsidiar-
 ies (nats).18 We shall also use a series of dummies to represent various
 levels of foreign direct investment as measured by subs and nats.

 IV. Empirical Results

 Table 1 contains univariate statistics describing the variables in equa-
 tion (4). The mean Tobin's q for the 1,644 firms in our sample is 81.4%.

 17. Note that the definition of Po has been changed slightly. It should now be one

 (rather than zero) if there are no missing intangibles related to firm size.

 18. These data are obtained from the National Register Publishing Co. (1980/81).

 Note that all three multinationality variables are positively corre-
 lated with higher firm value. In regression 2.1 (see table 2), the number
 of foreign subsidiaries (subs) is substituted for mn as the measure of
 multinationality. In 2.2, an indicator dummy set to one if the firm has
 five or more foreign subsidiaries is used, and in 2.3 we employ an
 indicator dummy for 20 or more foreign subsidiaries. In each case, the
 effect of multinationality is higher firm value. The effect in 2.1 and 2.2
 is highly significant; in 2.3, it is significant at the 10% confidence level.
 Regression 2.1 says that, on average, an additional foreign subsid-
 iary increases q by 0.331% of the value of tangible assets. Regression
 2.2 says that a firm with five or more foreign subsidiaries, on average,
 has a q some 8.41% higher than that of a firm with less than five
 subsidiaries. Regression 2.3 says that the q of a firm with 20 or more
 foreign subsidiaries is likely to be about 10.6% higher than that of firms
 with less than twenty.

 These findings are corroborated by table 3, where the number of
 nations in which the firm has foreign subsidiaries is used to construct
 degree of multinationality variables and where qualitatively similar
 results obtain.

 This positive relationship between multinationality and firm value
 (as measured by q) could be due to several of the theories discussed
 above. Intangible benefits connected with the possession of firm-spe-
 cific assets as described in the internalization theory might be present.
 Diversification opportunities for shareholders who otherwise would
 not be able to invest abroad because of imperfect world capital markets
 would make the stocks of multinationals more valuable.'9 The value
 of multinationality may also stem from more access to tax-avoidance
 methods or lower input costs.

 At first glance, our results appear inconsistent with the managerial
 objectives theory, which predicts that a complex multinational corpo-
 rate structure might allow managers more opportunity to pursue their
 own self-interest at the expense of share-value maximization. This
 theory would imply a negative effect of multinationality on share value.
 We shall return to this point.

 In order to distinguish between the various theories that are consis-
 tent with the results in tables 2 and 3, we refine the structure of our
 regression slightly. The internalization theory suggests that multina-
 tionality augments value because it lets a firm use intangible assets
 such as special know-how, management skills, patents, marketing abil-
 ity, or consumer goodwill on a larger scale. It follows that, if a firm
 lacks such intangibles, multinationality should be of little value. In
 contrast, theories of multinationality having to do with diversification
 opportunities, tax avoidance, labor costs, and so on, predict a value
 to multinationality regardless of whether or not such intangibles are
 present.

 Our R & D variable is included to control for intangibles such as
 special know-how and patents. The advertising variable is included to
 account for intangibles related to marketing sophistication and con-
 sumer goodwill. The internalization theory predicts that the positive
 coefficient (PI) on the degree of multinationality measure in equation
 (4) should be larger for firms whose R & D spending or advertising
 spending is larger. Therefore, we postulate that

 I - oto + oxIrd + o2adv. (5)
 The public good property of the intangibles related to R & D and
 advertising should make them more valuable as the firm becomes
 more multinational. Thus, the internalization theory predicts that ax
 and/or U2 should be positive, while cxo should be zero. The imperfect

 19. Diversification should be better measured by the number of nations in which the
 firm operates than by the number of foreign subsidiaries it controls. However, these two
 measures of multinationality have comparable significance in explaining shareholder
 value. This bodes somewhat ill for the diversification story but is not inconsistent with
 it since the two measures are highly correlated (p = .90, confidence level = 0.0001).

 significant value only to firms with intangibles related to advertising.
 Regression 4.2 employs an indicator dummy set to one if the firm has
 five or more subsidiaries. Here multinationality has significant value
 only for firms with intangibles related to R & D. In regression 4.3,

 value for firms with R & D related intangibles. Note however that the
 point estimate for ?t2 is quite large. Since R & D spending (rd) and
 advertising (adv) are significantly correlated (p = .07, confidence level
 = .0069), we may not be justified in attaching importance to the sig-
 nificance of one versus the other in the various specifications. The
 important point is that the two interaction variables in equation (6)
 have the right sign, and at least one of them is significant. Moreover,
 F-statistics for the joint significance of a. and t2 have probability val-
 ues of less than 1% in all regressions except 5.1, where the value is
 less than 5%.

 It is equally important that, in all regressions in table 4, aoo, which

 measures the direct effect of multinationality, is insignificant. Multina-
 tionality appears to have no significant value unless the firm possesses
 R & D or advertising-related intangible assets. These results together
 provide a strong support for the internalization theory: the value of
 multinationality stems from the possession of intangible assets, and
 the value of these intangible assets increases with the degree of multi-
 nationality.

 These results are corroborated by the estimates in table 5, where
 the number of nations in which the firm has subsidiaries is used to

 construct an analogous set of multinationality variables to those de-
 scribed in table 4. Again, multinationality has no positive impact on
 firm value unless R & D spending or advertising is taking place. In
 regressions 5.2 and 5.3, the size of the positive impact of multination-
 ality is again proportional to R & D and/or advertising expenditures.
 In addition to providing support for the internalization theory, our

 results cast light on other issues. First, our results for cx0 are inconsis-
 tent with the view that international diversification per se at the firm
 level leads to additional investment value. Our findings are consistent
 with the view of Adler and Dumas (1983) that multinationals' stock
 prices will not necessarily be bid up because these firms provide indi-
 rect international portfolio diversification, even if capital markets are
 segmented.

 Second, our results are now not necessarily inconsistent with the
 managerial objective theory. Indeed, in regressions 4.3 and 5.3, where
 cxo comes closest to being significant, its sign is negative. Furthermore,
 ao0 is consistently negative when multinationality is proxied for using
 a dummy indicating a large number of subsidiaries or host countries.
 If multinationality in the absence of R & D or advertising-related intan-
 gibles has a negative effect on firm value, this would indicate that the
 managerial objectives theory might be operational, as well, but that
 it is swamped by the effects of the internalization theory in tables 2
 and 3.

 Third, our results provide no support for theories of the advantages
 of multinationality based on tax avoidance through transfer pricing, or
 other mechanisms, or on lower input costs abroad. Both of these theo-
 ries imply that the multinationality variables themselves and not their
 interactions with R & D or advertising should be positively related to
 firm value. This is not the case.

 As further evidence, table 6 presents a regression explaining q with
 the usual control variables and industry dummies but with three multi-
 nationality measures: the number of subsidiaries in developed coun-
 tries (dc), the number in less developed countries (ldc), and the number
 of subsidiaries in tax havens (th).20 Thus the regression run is

 n

 q = >3 yidi + x1dc + X21dc + X3th

 i=1 (7)

 + P2rd + P3adv + 4debt + u,

 20. Developed countries consist of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and the
 Western European countries. Tax havens consist of the Bahamas, Barbados, the Nether-
 lands Antilles, the Virgin Islands, the Channel Islands, Liechtenstein, etc., and are
 treated separately since they fit into neither primary category. All remaining countries
 are classified here as less-developed countries.

 where dc plus ldc plus th is equal to subs, the total number of foreign
 subsidiaries. Note that X1 is significant at the 10% level and positive,
 while X2 and X3 are both insignificant. This indicates that the value of
 multinationality derives from a presence in other advanced industrial
 economies, not from a presence in inexpensive labor or low cost coun-
 tries. The tax-haven variable is included separately because of the
 difficulty of classifying these countries as developed or less developed.
 A presence in a tax haven does not appear to contribute to shareholder
 wealth. Tax-based theories of the advantage of multinationality do not
 necessarily require a presence in a tax haven. In alternative specifica-
 tions (not shown) allowing interactions of R & D and advertising with
 dc, ldc, and th, only the interactions between dc and intangibles are
 marginally significant. The results for dc's interactions are similar to
 those for sub's interactions shown in table 4. Combining tax havens
 with either of the two main groups does not qualitatively change the
 results for either.

 V. Robustness of the Results

 There are a number of potential pitfalls in our methodology. For exam-
 ple, we may have omitted important variables in the specifications of
 our regression equations, leaving our multinationality measures to
 proxy for these left-out variables.

 We use R & D and advertising spending as proxies for intangible
 assets whose value might be enhanced by multinational expansion such
 as technical expertise and marketing sophistication. Other intangibles,

 InvestorslMultinationalitv 179

 such as superior corporate organization, accumulated production
 skills, and especially management quality, may also be relevant. Un-
 fortunately, it is difficult to come up with reasonable proxies for these
 assets. Growth rates may be inappropriate in this capacity, as a fixation
 on growth maximization, rather than share-price maximization, is of-
 ten regarded as a deviation from good management. Temporarily high
 earnings, profitability, or cash flow are also thought by some authors
 to be associated with the management pursuing goals other than share-
 price maximization.

 If our multinationality measures were proxying for such left-out vari-

 ables, we should expect to find a positive coefficient on cxo. This is not
 the case. Perhaps this is because the link between our multinationality
 variables and these missing factors is too tenuous. It is, however, also
 plausible that R & D and advertising spending are as good proxies for
 managerial skills or other missing factors as any other possible choices
 and are thus already capturing much of the effect of these left-out
 variables.21

 In regressions of the type we are considering, it is common to in-
 clude a measure of firm size and historical performance. The latter is
 often justified as a measure of "growth prospects." Since firm size
 and historical performance are likely correlated with multinationality,
 we now consider these variables. We include the value of tangible
 assets (T) as a measure of firm size and the growth rate of the firm's
 labor force over the previous 3 years (grow) as a measure of growth.
 We thus regress

 n

 q = , yidi + otomn + oalrd mn + ot2adv * mn

 i= 1 (8)

 + P2rd + P3adv + 4debt + P5T + P6grow + v.

 Note that including T in equation (8) implies a T2 term in the initial
 specification. Thus we posit that multinationality may be proxying for
 nonlinear effects in firm size. (Linear effects are already accounted for
 in the constant that is subsumed in the industry dummies.) Similarly,
 the growth rate must be seen as augmenting value per dollar of tangi-
 bles rather than value itself.

 The estimated coefficients of equation (8) are shown in tables 7 and
 8. Note that the multinationality measures and interactions are not
 materially affected. In fact none of the results in any of the tables
 shown is materially altered by the presence of T and grow. Although
 these two variables do not change our results, we exclude them from

 21. Note that the earlier empirical literature sometimes regards R & D and advertising

 as proxies for superior management.

 our basic specifications because they do not seem to fit naturally into
 the chain of reasoning underlying our methodology.22

 The T term, which implies a T2 term in the original specification
 (eq. [2]), can be regarded as a proxy for general economies of scale.
 Apparently, such an effect does not exist.

 The growth rate variable really belongs to a different approach to
 firm valuation. The value of a firm can be determined in two ways.
 The first, from which we derive our methodology, says that the value
 of the firm is the sum of the value of its various net assets. The second
 says the firm's value is the present value of its expected future net
 cash flows. A growth-rate variable definitely belongs in the second
 type of analysis but is inappropriate in our use of the first. This is
 because we are interested in understanding the detailed nature of the

 firms' intangible assets, not merely in controlling for their overall ef-
 fect. Thus equation (8) is an odd sort of leftover-stew specification. It
 is not surprising that grow is significant since the variable does belong
 in an alternative specification of firm value. To include it here, how-
 ever, is to induce a sort of double counting because grow could pick
 up effects owing to R & D, advertising, and perhaps multinationality.
 Another difficulty this article shares with much econometric work
 is that a causal relation is not the same as a correlation. It might be
 that an additional factor not included in our model affects both left- and
 right-hand-side variables. For example, superior management quality
 might cause high q' s as well as higher R & D and advertising invest-
 ment in multinationals. However, some light is cast on the causality
 issue by Morck and Yeung (1990), who use an event study methodol-
 ogy to show that foreign acquisitions increase firm value only if intangi-
 bles are present.

 As discussed in Section III, our Tobin's q variable is based on ac-

 counting data, but it is corrected roughly for the effects of inflation on
 historical costs and of interest-rate changes on long-term debt. These
 corrections may be rougher for firms with substantial tangible assets
 abroad or foreign denominated debt. However, this should not com-
 promise our main result unless it induces a bias related to R & D or
 advertising, which seems unlikely.

 Although we scaled all our variables by the value of the firm's tangi-
 ble assets (T), our regressions all contained significant heteroscedastic-
 ity. We therefore employed heteroscedasticity-consistent standard
 errors (White 1980) throughout. Our parameters and t-ratios are there-
 fore consistent estimates.

 Another potential problem is that our estimates might be influenced
 by transitory macroeconomic factors such as exchange rates or relative
 returns in the U.S. market versus various foreign markets. We there-
 fore repeat all of our regressions using q's and financial measures for
 other years. The coefficients of the various multinationality measures
 and of their interactions with R & D and advertising spending in regres-
 sions based on equation (6), but using financial data from 1976 through
 1980, are shown in tables 9 and 10. Although point estimates and sig-
 nificance levels vary somewhat, the general pattern of positive signs
 and significance is unchanged. The only notable exception is the coef-
 ficients of dummies for five or more host nations or subsidiaries in the
 later years. The lack of significance may be because having five host
 nations or subsidiaries is indicative of marginal, rather than full-blown,
 multinationality. Thus the results in tables 9 and 10 indicate that our
 findings are not an artifact of exchange-rate movements or some other
 transitory factor.23

 Note however that the effect of multinationality in the absence of
 R & D or advertising is negative in most of the specifications in tables
 9 and 10, and significantly so in a few in the column where multination-
 als have more than 20 subsidiaries. We again interpret this as weak
 evidence that a divergence of interests between managers and share-
 holders may reduce firm value in some multinationals. On average,
 however, this effect is more than compensated for by the advantages
 of multinationality in exploiting intangible information-based assets
 where they are present (note tables 2 and 3).

 VI. Conclusions

 This article examines the value of multinationality to investors, as
 measured by its effect on firms' q ratios. We find that the positive

 23. As an additional test of this possibility, we include dummies for the presence of
 the firm in different regions of the world. None of the dummies was significant. In
 particular, there was no apparent difference between subsidiaries in fixed- vs. floating-
 rate jurisdictions.

 multinationality per se does not have any significant impact. Our result
 supports the internalization theory, which holds that intangible assets
 are necessary for direct foreign investment to make sense. It thus lends
 support to a recent strand of trade literature that assumes multinational
 firms have intangible assets with a public goods property.

 Our results do not support the hypothesis that investors value multi-
 national firms as a means of diversifying their portfolios internation-
 ally. Nor do they support theories of the advantages of multinationality
 based either on tax avoidance using transfer pricing, tax havens, and
 so on, or on the use of cheaper labor or other production inputs in
 low-cost countries.

 We find very weak evidence that multinationality in the absence of
 R & D or advertising-related intangibles may reduce firm value. This
 is consistent with the possibility that managers' decisions may be more
 difficult to monitor in large complex multinational firms and that share-
 holders may thus be neglected. Indeed, we cannot rule out the possibil-
 ity that diversification, tax avoidance, and cheaper inputs are aug-
 menting firm value, while manager's neglect of shareholder interests
 is simultaneously reducing it.

 Nonetheless, the important managerial implication of our result is
 that there appears to be one primary justification for international
 expansion: it enhances the scope for using the firm's intangible assets.
 The often claimed benefits-international portfolio diversification, ac-
 cess to inexpensive inputs, and tax avoidance-do not appear to be
 valued by investors in most cases.
