This study uses a sample of 483 employees to investigate how fairness assessments and organi-
zational structure relate to employee mental health. The authors explain these effects using a
social contagion framework, which describes the creation of group effects that would occur in
addition to individual-level influences. They found that the interactive effects of distributive and
procedural  justice  climates  significantly  influence  individual  feelings  of  both  anxiety  and
depression. This effect goes beyond the main effects of justice at the individual level.

The role of employee mental health in the workplace has received increasing attention in
recent years in the organizational literature. The reasons for this interest at a practical level
are clear. The annual cost of lost productivity, increased absenteeism, and turnover because
of  mental  illness  to  U.S.  businesses  has  been  estimated  at  $44  billion  (National  Mental
Health Association, 2007). However, the nature of the underlying constructs of mental health
and differences in the ways mental health has been measured have made understanding both
the antecedents and outcomes of mental health difficult to assess. Suls and Bunde’s (2005)
literature  review, however, identified  depression  and  anxiety  as  two  key  components  of

mental health and affective well-being that are related to cardiovascular disease and other
maladies. Thus, increasing our understanding of factors that may lead to employee anxiety
and  depression  is  an  important  step  toward  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of
employee well-being.

The main purpose of this article is to investigate how work group members’ aggregated per-
ceptions  of  fairness  relate  to  individual  employee  feelings  of  depression  and  anxiety.
Specifically, we capture elements of an organization’s structural policies and norms, derived
from managers’ perspectives as well as aggregate employee views of organizational justice, and
relate these to individual assessments of mental health. As noted, we do this at a climate (work
group) level, with climate defined as a collective set of individual perceptions regarding policies,
practices, and procedures that an organization rewards and supports (Chan, 1998; Kozlowski &
Klein, 2000; Simons & Roberson, 2003). This article represents an early attempt to investigate
the feelings of individual mental health that may develop as a result of the work group’s aggre-
gated view of justice. This is significant, given that group influence on individual perceptions
and feelings of justice has been identified as a likely route to important individual outcomes
(Greenberg, 2006; Moliner, Martinez-Tur, Peiro, Ramos, & Cropanzano, 2005).

In  accomplishing  this, the  study  makes  a  contribution  to  the  literature  in  two  distinct
ways. First, this is the initial study to investigate the interactive influence of climate across
three  critical  elements  of  organizational  justice  (i.e., procedural, distributive, and  interac-
tional). Although climate research has explored the influence of procedural justice relative
to multiple different group and individual outcomes (e.g., group performance; Colquitt, Noe,
& Jackson, 2002), the exploration of distributive and interactional justice climate has just
begun. Such a dearth of distributive climate research, specifically, may be logical given the
likelihood that procedural justice climate is the primary driver of collective team justice per-
ceptions (Roberson & Colquitt, 2005). Still, it is possible to build a theoretical argument for
the inclusion of all climate forms in the justice network (Degoey, 2000; Liao & Rupp, 2005;
Moliner et al. 2005; Roberson & Colquitt, 2005). As Moliner et al. (2005) noted, “Because
shared information and organizational experiences arise out of common interactions, group
members probably share justice perceptions about their organization and their own supervi-
sor” (p.  101).  Such  shared  information  would  logically  flow  in  relation  to  all  prominent
forms  of  justice, thereby  creating  the  potential  for  climate  to  develop  across  procedural,
interactional, and distributive forms of justice (Schminke, Ambrose, & Rupp, 2002).

The second contribution is that this research investigates individual levels of anxiety and
depression as distinct outcomes resulting from aggregate justice perceptions. The role of jus-
tice in relation to mental health is important because organizational researchers are consis-
tently finding that the relationship of organizational justice to employees’ psychological and
physical health is significant (e.g., Elovainio, Kivimaki, & Helkama, 2001; Greenberg, 2004,
2006;  Moliner  et  al., 2005; Tepper, 2001).  Indeed, such  study  of  mental  health  and  well-
being  can  be  linked, at  least  conceptually, to  the  very  early  work  that  found  the  linkage
between distributive justice (as equity) and satisfaction (Adams, 1963, 1965). Furthermore,
recent  studies  have  considered  justice  at  multiple  levels, but  the  current  study  is  the  first
to unite the themes of a justice–mental health relationship with understanding how multiple
levels  of  organizational  justice  are  relevant  in  constructing  an  employee’s  individual
emotional state.

The  remainder  of  the  article  is  structured  as  follows.  First, a  theoretical  background
related to justice climate and associated empirical results is presented. This is followed by
the development of hypotheses and a discussion of the research methodology and results.
Finally, a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications concludes the article.

Theoretical Background

The Construction of Justice Climate

To understand the effects of justice climate, it is important to understand how feelings and
beliefs  of  the  individual  could, in  aggregation  with  other  group  members’ feelings  and
beliefs, explain variance in employee mental health beyond an individual-level measure. To
do this, we highlight the importance of social interaction to the development of individual
perceptions of workplace justice. As Umphress, Labianca, Brass, Kass, and Scholten noted,
“Justice perceptions are not formed in isolation; rather, they are subject to the influences of
those with whom we interact” (2003: 739). Beginning with Deutsch (1983), the social con-
struction  of  justice  has  received  significant  attention  in  the  management  literature  (e.g.,
Greenberg, 2006; Kulik & Ambrose, 1992; Shah, 1998, 2000; Umphress et al., 2003), with
a consistent conclusion that social interactions influence individual perceptions of organiza-
tional justice. Such study has led to the progression of our knowledge of social influence as
it expands to the nature of interactions within teams and work groups where social influences
on individual justice perceptions also have been witnessed (Colquitt, 2004).

Similarly, beyond  the  individual  level, recent  work  by  Roberson  (2006)  highlights  the
importance of social interaction to the creation of collective perceptions of justice. Indeed,
as Degoey (2000) pointed out, collective perceptions within work units are very likely to be
shared  because  of  the  natural  inclination  to  discuss  ambiguous  and  emotionally  charged
events (e.g., the procedures and interactions that lead to the distribution of organizational
resources and rewards). It is through conversing about justice that a shift in individually held
attitudes and behaviors may take place (Degoey, 2000). Such a link to emotion and ambigu-
ity is especially relevant when investigating the influence of justice climate on mental health.
Because  being  confronted  with  injustice  may  cause  emotions, employees  may  cope  with
these stressors by seeking social support and, in the process, develop individual views of jus-
tice that are derived through social interaction (Degoey, 2000).

Finally, the occurrence of collective perceptions of justice highlights the notion that jus-
tice climate may logically take place across any form of (in)justice, be it distributive, proce-
dural, or  interactional.  Because  any  precursor  to  an  individual  judgment  of  justice  may
involve social discourse, it could occur in relation to many types of justice events, such as
dissatisfaction with outcomes received, procedures used, or interpersonal interactions with
management (Degoey, 2000; Greenberg, 2006).

Justice Climate and Previous Research

Building on the perception of a “social” creation of justice perceptions, justice climate has
been previously defined as “group and organization-level justice perceptions” (Liao & Rupp,

2005: 242); “distinct team level cognition” regarding fair treatment for the team as a whole
(Colquitt, Noe, & Jackson, 2002: 84); and “shared perceptions” of team fairness in outcomes,
treatment, and supervisory interaction (Moliner et al., 2005: 101). Regardless of definition, a
key commonality across climate research is the idea of justice perceptions that are constructed
through social interaction and shared among individual employees within a work group.

Whereas definitions of climate are fairly consistent, operationalizations of climate are var-
ied, with several measures of climate appearing in the literature (Chan, 1998). For example,
Colquitt et al. (2002) and Moliner et al. (2005) frame climate as consisting of a level, or group
mean, of justice applied to the group as a whole and strength, or within-group variance of jus-
tice perceptions. Furthermore, to more directly capture the notion of shared perceptions of jus-
tice, a referent-shift method of capturing climate might be used (e.g., Naumann & Bennett,
2000). When using referent-shift measures, respondents are asked about their perception of jus-
tice  with  the  group  in  mind  (e.g., has  the  group  been  treated  well?—Naumann  &  Bennett,
2000). Alternatively, justice climate has been operationalized as the aggregate of individual
responses about justice perceptions, called the direct consensus approach (Chan, 1998; Liao &
Rupp, 2005). Direct consensus represents an average of individual team member justice per-
ceptions  (i.e., the  additive  composition  of  justice  level)  with  an  additional  requirement  that
variation among within-group, individual perceptions be low (Chan, 1998).

In the next section of this article, we develop hypotheses about how the interaction of jus-
tice climates and organizational structure might be associated with the psychological health
of employees.

Hypothesis Development

Depression and anxiety. The dependent variables for this study were two dimensions of
employee mental health: depression and anxiety. These variables were selected because of
their common representation as components of employee affective well-being and mental
health  (Warr, 1990, 1996).  Furthermore, these  two  variables  possess  a  strong  and  logical
association with both individual and group justice variables. Conditions that promote injus-
tice would likely lead to feelings of anxiety and depression, whereas fair situations would
help to temper such feelings. At the group level, such feelings have the potential to be ampli-
fied (Degoey, 2000). Depression is indicated through gloom, despair, and a general lack of
enthusiasm. Anxiety is accompanied by anxiousness, worry, and/or tension, with an inabil-
ity to relax and feel comfortable.

Justice and employee health. The investigation of justice’s link to health-related outcomes
at an individual level has grown (Elovainio et al., 2001; Judge & Colquitt, 2004; Tepper, 2001).
There have been numerous linkages between justice and outcomes such as employee stress
(Elovainio et al., 2001; Judge & Colquitt, 2004), mental health (Tepper, 2001), and insomnia
(Greenberg, 2006). In total, procedural, interactional, and distributive elements of justice have
all been found to have strong influences on employee mental health at the individual level.

For example, Judge and Colquitt (2004) found that procedural justice affected employee
stress, although  this  effect  was  mediated  by  work–family  conflict, whereas  Elovainio  et  al.

(2001) found procedural justice to have a direct effect on employee feelings of strain. Finally,
Tepper (2001) demonstrated the potentially important role of distributive justice when related
to procedural justice and mental health. Tepper found that when distributive injustice existed,
the level of procedural justice (high versus low) became more important. This result suggests
that the importance of procedural justice is minimized when employees feel their rewards are
acceptable. But when distributive injustice exists, employees will use information related to
procedural  justice  to  evaluate  probabilities  of  repeated  future  occurrences  of  unacceptable
(unjust)  events  (Colquitt, 2004).  Similarly, Greenberg  (2006)  found  that  when  distributive
injustice exists, negative effects on mental health (i.e., sleep loss associated with a stressful sit-
uation) are minimized by high levels of interactional justice. This primary logic is consistent
with previous justice research where it has been demonstrated that situations of distributive
injustice create salience for both process and interaction (for a review of justice variable inter-
relationships, see Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001).

Although the above discussion implies a relationship at the individual level, we propose
that individual feelings of anxiety and depression will be further developed based on group
interactions (Degoey, 2000; Moliner et al., 2005). To begin discussion of such an effect, it
must be highlighted that it is the level of distributive justice climate that is being investigated,
meaning that the high or low level of the group mean serves as the focal construct (Colquitt
et al., 2002; Moliner et al., 2005). It is this “average” effect (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000) that
is highlighted, with a focus on minimal perceptual variance across group members implying
the existence of an individually perceived group perception for a just (or unjust) distributive
allocation (i.e., a direct consensus model of climate where parameters are set for acceptable
variance of perception; Chan, 1998). In such instances, climate might approximate the extent
to which an acceptable distributive norm within a given context is being met (i.e., Leventhal,
1976). In this instance, because equity views are being measured, the level of distributive
justice climate would be related to perceptions of how effectively the norm of equity is being
achieved. Given this, the climate influence is based on the premise of a normative belief,
held at individual levels, that relative to what each individual provides for the organization,
“this organization does (not) pay well.”

It is this collective experience of (in)justice that helps to create salience for both proce-
dural  and  interactional  justice  above  and  beyond  those  witnessed  at  the  individual  level.
Specifically, as  perceptions  of  distributive  injustice  among  group  members  increase, the
more important procedural and interactional justice will become (Degoey, 2000; Greenberg,
2006; Tepper, 2001). Working in a context where distributive injustice exists, emotions such
as  anxiety, anger, depression, or  worry  are  likely  to  be  aroused  (Lerner, 1980). And, as
Degoey (2000) described, a normal approach to understanding such injustice is to seek social
perspective, part of which might be the social construction of a view of procedural justice
that helps employees to interpret the meaning of low levels of distributive justice as well as
establish appropriate emotional reactions (Degoey, 2000). Thus, normative individual beliefs
are established through social reinforcement (Wallace, Popp, & Mondore, 2006). In establish-
ing the meaning of low levels of distributive justice, such a social process is also helping to
reduce the effects of uncertainty associated with this element of group work life (Lind & Van
den Bos, 2002). The reduction of uncertainty would further aid in enhancing the tempering
effect of procedural and interactional climate on mental health.

In  essence, employees  will  be  better  able  to  understand  distributive  injustice  if  the
collective belief for both just process and interaction exists, which would help to validate
individual  feelings  of  self-worth  (Degoey, 2000). An  employee  would  perceive  that  out-
comes might be low, but employees, on the whole, are still treated with respect and dignity,
rationale for decisions is provided, and the process to arrive at outcomes is fairly applied
across all. Outcomes might be lower than desired, but no one individual is being selected for
this  injustice, and  the  experience, with  minimal  variance, is  shared  across  all  employees.
Therefore, just processes and interactions can minimize individual feelings of both depres-
sion and anxiety (Greenberg, 2006). Indeed, because attempts at changing the relative level
of distributed outcomes may be difficult, the social construction of a collective perception of
“just” process and interactional treatment may be one of the only ways to come to terms with
a difficult situation, thereby helping employees to maintain individual mental health. This
leads to the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Procedural justice climate will moderate the relationship between distributive justice
climate and both individual (a) depression and (b) anxiety beyond the direct effect of individual-
level justice perceptions.

Hypothesis 2: Interactional justice climate will moderate the relationship between distributive justice
climate and both individual (a) depression and (b) anxiety beyond the direct effect of individual-
level justice perceptions.

Procedural  and  interactional  justice  climate, organization  structure, and  employee
health. Building on Hypotheses 1 and 2, we propose that the direct effects of procedural and
interactional justice climate on individual depression and anxiety will be moderated by orga-
nization structure. Indeed, numerous researchers have suggested the influence of structure
on  the  relevance  of  procedural  and  interactional  justice  at  an  individual  level, with  some
structures making an environment systematically just and others leaving employees wanting
for justice (Ambrose & Schminke, 2003; Shepphard, Lewicki, & Minton, 1992).

At  a  general  level, recent  research  by  Ambrose  and  Schminke  (2003);  Schminke,
Ambrose, and  Cropanzano  (2000);  and  Husted  and  Folger  (2004)  has  called  for  a  closer
examination of the integrated effects of organizational structure and justice. Organizational
structure, defined  as  “the  recurrent  set  of  relationships  between  organization  members”
(Donaldson, 1996: 57), has been proposed to be composed of both mechanistic and organic
forms (Stopford & Baden-Fuller, 1994). Mechanistic structures are rigid and tight, indicative
of  traditional  bureaucratic  environments.  In  such  contexts, centralized  power  is  common,
communication  is  funneled  through  rigid  hierarchical  channels, whereas  job  descriptions
and decision-making styles are highly uniform and formal. On the opposite end of the struc-
tural continuum, organic environments are flexible, loose, and decentralized, with open and
informal  communication  encouraged.  This  structure  allows  employees  the  flexibility  to
adapt (Ambrose & Schminke 2003).

Both  Schminke  et  al.  (2000)  and Ambrose  and  Schminke  (2003)  have  noted  that, until
recently, the relationship between structure and justice has been relatively ignored in the litera-
ture.  Schminke  et  al.  (2000)  did  find  main  effects  between  structure  and  procedural  justice.
However, like Ambrose and Schminke (2003), we are interested in the organizational conditions

under which justice will be related to outcome variables (in our case, the mental health mea-
sures). Specifically, we predict that the justice–mental health links will be affected under dif-
ferent  organizational  structures.  For  this  reason, we  hypothesize  a  moderating  effect  of
structure on justice–mental health relationships. Previous research has demonstrated that struc-
ture interacts with a number of variables to affect organizational performance, innovation, and
job satisfaction (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Slevin & Covin, 1997). What is novel is the inte-
grated  investigation  of  structure  with  justice  climate. At  an  individual  level, Ambrose  and
Schminke (2003) found that the relationship between procedural justice and perceived organi-
zational support was stronger in organizations with a mechanistic structure and that interac-
tional justice was more strongly related to trust in supervisors in organizations with organic
structures. The effect of structure with climate variables, however, remains to be determined,
especially in any relationship with mental health.

Building on previous work, Ambrose and Schminke (2001, 2003) explained that an orga-
nization’s structure can either reinforce an employee’s perception of procedural or interac-
tional justice, thus strengthening the influence of this justice judgment on outcome variables,
or negate an employee’s judgment, thus weakening justice’s effect. Specific to procedural
justice, Ambrose  and  Schminke  (2001, 2003)  demonstrated  the  linkage  of  a  mechanistic
organization structure to five core elements of Leventhal’s (1980) procedural justice rules of
consistency, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, and representativeness. In a mecha-
nistic  environment, these  five  rules  of  process  become  reinforcing  elements  to  employee
judgments  of  procedural  justice, creating  salience  for  this  justice  evaluation. As  a  result,
adherence to such strict standards of process would lead employees to judge an organization
as “procedurally just” and will facilitate employee beliefs that such a system can be relied
upon to be fair (at least within the group). In fact, given the importance employees in a mech-
anistic environment would place on formal rules of process, it would be an absolute neces-
sity that their organization could be judged procedurally just, as this would be the ultimate
standard of justice (Ambrose & Schminke, 2003).

Conversely, interactional justice would become salient in an organic organizational struc-
ture (Ambrose & Schminke, 2003). Because organic structures rely more (than mechanistic
structures)  on  interactional  factors  such  as  elaboration, face-to-face  communication, and
mutual  respect, the  significance  of  these  interactional  influences  in  organic  organizations
should increase the relevance of interactional aspects of justice. That is, for the organic struc-
ture to operate effectively, interactional justice must be high.

Similar to distributive justice climate, we propose that procedural and interactional justice
climate  effects  will  go  beyond  the  influences  found  at  the  individual  level.  Indeed, previous
research  has  suggested  the  possibility  of  justice  climate  significance  for  both  procedural
(described earlier) and interactional justice climate. In relation to interactional justice climate,
Liao  and  Rupp  (2005)  found  that  interactional  climate  did  affect  different  organization-  and
supervisor-focused outcomes (i.e., commitment, satisfaction, and citizenship) beyond individual-
level  effects.  Similarly, work  by  Simons  and  Roberson  (2003)  found  that  department-level
interpersonal justice predicted department-level satisfaction with the supervisor.

Consistent with our conceptualization, the idea of socially derived norms maintained among
individual group members would suggest that employees will be prone to “tuning into” the beliefs

and feelings of others within the work group to learn crucial information regarding the work envi-
ronment (Barsade, 1994; Degoey, 2000). Given that the work environment is formed relative to
the organizational structure, socially constructed norms for appropriate work behaviors, beliefs,
and associated emotions are likely to form. Because of their social construction, such views are
likely to become standards within the group, minimizing the need for reexamination of proce-
dural or interactional justice judgments once such conclusions have been drawn. As Colquitt et
al. (2002) demonstrated, justice perceptions that are revised less frequently tend to have a stronger
influence on outcome variables. That is, employees who do not feel a need to constantly reeval-
uate justice judgments rely on justice heuristics that have been previously developed and used,
thus  strengthening  the  effect  of  such  judgments  on  outcome  variables  (Colquitt  et  al., 2001;
Colquitt et al., 2002). In a mechanistic work group environment, then, the collective belief of pro-
cedural justice would likely help to improve affective well-being and mental health for the indi-
vidual  (Degoey, 2000)  because  of  the  consistency  of  such  a  conclusion  with  the  work
environment. Similarly, in an organic environment, the group desire for the existence of interac-
tional  justice—the  fact  that  a  supervisor  is  normatively  perceived  as  respectful  and  caring—
should help to improve individual affective well-being. This leads to the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3: Organizational structure will moderate the negative relationship between procedural
justice climate and both individual (a) depression and (b) anxiety beyond the direct effect of
individual-level  justice  perceptions. Within  a  highly  mechanistic  structure, the  negative  rela-
tionship of procedural justice climate will be strengthened. Within a highly organic structure, the
negative relationship of interactional justice climate will be strengthened.

Sample

Method

Two night undergraduate human resources management classes in a large northeastern uni-
versity were offered extra credit for distributing questionnaires to employees within their work
group at their place of employment. Students were told to consider a “work group” as a col-
lection of employees, including themselves, who are interdependent in their tasks, who share
responsibility for work outcomes, and who were seen by themselves and others as a social
entity (Colquitt et al., 2002). The students were instructed to distribute a survey to every indi-
vidual who would fall under this definition (i.e., not just friends and close coworkers). Students
who  could  not  fulfill  this  requirement  (i.e., were  not  employed  or  were  not  part  of  a  work
group) were given alternative options for earning the extra credit points.

Although control over who was actually completing the questionnaires may be a concern,
we tried to address this issue by providing a self-addressed, postage-paid envelope with each
questionnaire  and  instructed  participants  that  each  respondent  was  to  return  the  question-
naire individually in his or her sealed envelope via mail. Also, coders of the data were trained
by the researchers to check responses for any cases where it appeared that the same person
filled out multiple questionnaires (similar color ink or other indications), and students were
warned that the questionnaires would be so inspected, with loss of credit as a penalty for not
following instructions. Only four questionnaires were found that appeared to have the above
characteristics, prompting their exclusion from the analysis.

For the study, two questionnaires were used. Students were instructed to distribute one
version  of  the  questionnaire  to  fellow  group  employees  and  a  different  version  (with  the
organizational structure items) to the group’s immediate manager or supervisor. Using this
technique, 677 responses were obtained from 72 different groups. The number of respon-
dents from a single group ranged from 3 to 10. We eliminated groups with fewer than seven
members (a total of five groups). Next, because only 56 managers reported, we dropped 16
additional groups. With these steps, the sample size was ultimately reduced to 483. For the
sample, 57.5% of the respondents were female. Forty-three percent of respondents were 20
to 29 years old, 29% were 30 to 39 years old, 22% were 40 to 49 years old, and 6% were
older  than  50  years.  High  school  was  the  highest  education  level  attained  for  30.9%  of
respondents, with  29.4%  having  2  years  of  college, and  26.6%  having  a  4-year  degree.
Respondents had been employed in their jobs an average of 4.8 years. Twenty-one percent
of the work groups were in retail or wholesale trade. Seven percent were in manufacturing,
with the rest being in hospitals, real estate, insurance, and transportation.

Measures

Scales for all the study variables are shown in the appendix.

Depression and anxiety. We measured depression and anxiety using the scale from Axtell
et  al.  (2002).  This  is  a  shortened  version  of  Warr’s  (1990)  Anxiety-Contentment  and
Depression-Enthusiasm Scales. The scales were developed to assess anxiety as low pleasure
and high mental arousal, whereas depression can be thought of as exhibiting low levels of
pleasure and arousal (Warr, 1996). Previous research has illustrated the distinction between
anxiety  and  depression  through  demonstrating  differential  relationships  with  other  study
variables  that  reflect  the  expected  arousal  and  pleasure  dimensions  (Warr, 1990).
Respondents were presented with six adjectives and were asked to describe how often these
apply to them at work. Responses were captured on a 5-point scale ranging from never to all
the time. For each scale, three of the items were reverse coded so that a higher number indi-
cated  increased  depression  or  anxiety.  The  depression  scale  had  a  reliability  estimate
(Cronbach’s alpha) of .84, and the anxiety scale had a reliability estimate of .83.

Organizational justice. The justice measures were from Colquitt (2001). Procedural justice
was measured with a seven-item scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .87). Distributive justice was mea-
sured using four items (Cronbach’s alpha = .94). Interactional justice was a nine-item scale
(Cronbach’s alpha = .94). Responses ranged from 1 (to a small extent) to 7 (to a large extent).

Justice climate (collective perceptions of justice). The phenomenon of interest is climate,
which we measured by averaging each group member’s justice perceptions and assigning to
each member the group rating. Because we used an individual referent, rather than asking
respondents  their  perceptions  of  the  group  experience, we  called  this  measure  collective
perceptions of justice to distinguish it from the referent shift approach. This was done for
each type of justice. Averaging to get a collective perception of justice score follows Chan’s

(1998) direct consensus approach and has been used in other studies using justice climate as
a construct (Liao & Rupp, 2005).

The primary rationale for this choice lies in its consistency with the specific prior climate
research (i.e., Liao & Rupp, 2005) that served as the formative basis for much of our con-
ceptualization and analysis. Furthermore, the direct consensus approach is consistent with
the conceptualization and analysis of collective, or aggregate, perceptions of justice, as dis-
cussed in the introduction to this research.

Organizational structure. Similar to Ambrose and Schminke (2003), we used Khandwalla’s
(1976/1977) seven-item scale, which measured the degree to which departments had mecha-
nistic or organic characteristics. Manager respondents (as opposed to employees for the previ-
ous scales) indicated on a 7-point scale the degree to which paired statements described the
structure of their department. Responses were coded so that higher values represented a more
mechanistic structure. The reliability estimate for this scale was .82.

Controls. We controlled for age, gender, tenure, and educational level because they may
be related to working conditions (Samuel, Ben-Avi, Luz, & Green, 1995). Educational level
was coded as 1 = high school , 2 = up to 2 years of college, 3 = 4 years of college, and 5 =
graduate/professional school.

Analyses

To determine construct validity, we ran a confirmatory factor analysis for each set of focal
constructs reported by employees (i.e., distributive, procedural, and interactional collective
perceptions  of  justice, depression, and  anxiety).  To  assess  the  convergent  and  discriminant
validity of the focal constructs, we estimated a five-factor confirmatory measurement model. All
five constructs were latent variables. Each questionnaire item loaded only on its latent construct (or
first-order factor). The overall model provides a satisfactory fit to the data ( χ =559.9, p < .001, df
= 228; Goodness-of-Fit Index [GFI] = 0.92; Confirmatory Fit Index [CFI] = 0.93; Incremental Fit
Index [IFI] = 0.93; and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.07), indicating
the unidimensionality of the measures (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). In addition, all factor
loadings were highly significant (p < .001), and the composite reliabilities of all constructs
exceeded the usual benchmark of .60 (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). To further assess discriminant
validity, several additional confirmatory factor analysis models were run in which each pair
of factor correlations was constrained to unity. The fit of each new model was then compared
to  the  original  unconstrained  model.  All  measures  showed  evidence  of  discrimination.
Furthermore, model chi-square difference tests were performed comparing the hypothesized
measurement  model  to  a  null  model  (chi-square  difference  of  1,578.87), a  model  where
depression and anxiety were combined (chi-square difference of 220.12), and a model where
interactional  justice  was  decomposed  into  both  interpersonal  and  informational  elements
(chi-square difference of 175.99). All differences in chi-square were significant at p < .01,
suggesting the measurement model was appropriate. Descriptive statistics and bivariate cor-
relations between the study variables are shown in Table 1.

Spell, Arnold / A Multi-Level Analysis of Organizational Justice

735

The  data  were  multilevel, with  individual-level  constructs  (anxiety  and  depression)
regressed on individual-Level 1 ratings of justice, the control variables, and group-level con-
structs (the Level 2 collective perceptions of justice variables, where employees were nested
within  groups). We  used  the  employee’s  individual  rating  of  procedural, distributive, and
interactional justice as the Level 1 variables for justice.

We used hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the data, after justifying aggregation of
the  individual-level  data  to  group-level  variables.  This  provides  a  robust  examination  of
models combining individual- and group-level variables (Liao & Rupp, 2005; Mossholder,
Bennett, & Martin, 1998; Singer, 1998). The analysis proceeds first by determining intercept
and slope terms describing the relationship between predictors and the dependent variables
in each work unit; this is typically called the Level 1 (within-units) analysis. The intercept
and slope terms from this analysis were then the dependent variables used for a between-unit
(Level 2) analysis (the collective perception of justice variables). Analyses were performed
using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) program PROC MIXED.

00 was 1.28; for anxiety, the estimate for τ

The  hypotheses  made  predictions  about  group-level  variables  and  interactions  between
them in relation to individual-level mental health constructs. Before testing these hypotheses,
we determined if there was significant variance between the groups with respect to the depen-
dent variables. Null models with no predictors were estimated for each dependent variable to
get the significance level of the Level 2 residual variance of the intercept (represented as τ
00).
For depression, the estimated τ
00 was 2.59. Chi-square
statistics indicated both of these values were significantly different from 0 (p < .01). These esti-
mates  indicated  that  there  were  significant  differences  between  the  work  groups  for  both
depression and anxiety. The estimates for the residual, or σ2, 13.19 for depression, and 20.26
for  anxiety, were  both  significant, indicating  that  there  is  also  significant  variation  among
employees within the work groups. The intraclass correlation gives the proportion of total vari-
ance because of between-group differences. We used the formula given by Singer (1998) to cal-
culate this proportion as .09 for depression and .11 for anxiety. The clustering of these scores
within the groups suggests that an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis of these
data would give misleading results (Singer, 1998). Although the program does not report model
R2s like OLS, we did calculate the proportions of explainable variance between groups and pro-
portion of variance within groups compared to the null models.

To further justify aggregation of the individual-level data, within-group reliability statistics
were  calculated  (rwg(j))  for  each  of  the  aggregated  (collective  perception)  variables  (James,
Demaree, & Wolf, 1984). For distributive justice, these values ranged from .98 to .44 with three
departments below .70; for interactional, the range was .94 to .70 with no departments below;
and for procedural, the range was .96 to .45 with six departments below (although four of these
were above .65). We reran the analyses dropping the departments under .70, and the results
were  the  same  in  terms  of  significance  levels  and  negligible  change  in  coefficient  values.
Similar to Liao and Rupp’s (2005) approach, we did additional tests to check the validity of the
group-level constructs. We did a one-way analysis of variance and found that the between-
groups variance on each of the collective perception variables was significant (p < .001). The
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were also calculated. The ICCs were calculated using
employee individual ratings of justice. The values for the interrater reliability index (ICC1) and

reliability of group average (ICC2) for each collective perception variable were as follows:
procedural justice collective perception, .44 and .85; distributive justice collective perception,
.78 and .93; and interactional justice collective perception, .63 and .92. The ICC1 compares the
variance between the work groups with the variance within groups using the individual ratings
of each respondent. The ICC2 assesses between and within variability using the average rat-
ings of employees. All of these values were above the recommended levels proposed for group-
level variables by Schneider, White, and Paul (1998), and our values were well above those
reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., Liao & Rupp, 2005). Taken together, these results
seem to justify aggregation of the justice scores.

Mean centering of the predictor variables was done as recommended in Singer (1998).
This is also recommended to address any concerns regarding multicollinearity, particularly
with respect to interaction terms.

Results

The results for the hierarchical linear modeling appear in Table 2 where depression was
the dependent variable and in Table 3 for anxiety as the dependent variable. From left to
right, each table has a column showing just an intercept (the null model), a model with only
control variables, a model with the Level 1 main effects, a model with Level 1 main effects
and  interactions, a  model  with  Level  1  main  effects  and  interactions  plus  Level  2  main
effects, and finally a full model with Level 1 and 2 main effects and interactions.

For the depression models, all three types of justice (procedural, distributive, and inter-
actional) at the individual level (p < .05) were significantly and (as would be expected) neg-
atively related to depression. As predicted by Hypothesis 1, in the full model, the interaction
of  distributive  and  procedural  justice  collective  perception  was  related  to  depression  (t =
2.12, p < .05). Also as predicted by Hypothesis 1, the interaction of distributive justice and
procedural justice collective perception was related to anxiety (t = 2.73, p < .01).

The significant finding related to the interaction of Level 2 procedural and distributive
justice indicated that higher levels of procedural justice collective perceptions will “buffer”
the negative relationship between distributive justice collective perceptions and both depres-
sion and anxiety. The nature of this relationship is depicted in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
To plot these interactions, procedural justice collective perceptions took on the value of one
standard deviation above (high level) and one standard deviation below (low level) the mean.
The equation for the slopes in Figure 1 is Depression = B+ mi (PJ), where B is the intercept,
PJ is procedural justice collective perceptions, mi=1 is the slope of the line for the low proce-
dural justice condition and mi=2 is the slope for the condition of high procedural justice. For
Figure 2 with anxiety as the y axis, the equation is Anxiety = B + mi (PJ).

Support for Hypothesis 2 was not found, as the interactional justice and distributive jus-
tice interaction of collective perceptions was not significant for either dependent variable.
Also, contrary to Hypothesis 3, the interaction of organizational structure with either proce-
dural or interactional justice collective perceptions to influence individual-level anxiety and
depression failed to reach a level of significance.

contrasted to the models with independent variables included, where the variance compo-
nents are conditional. Turning to depression, results in Table 2 show that variance within
groups  (σ2)  changed  from  13.19  to  11.26  when  Level  1  main  effects  were  added.  From
Singer’s (1998) discussion, this means that the main-effects model diminished within-group
variance by the proportion (13.19-11.26)/13.19, which is .15. The full model with Level 2

main effects and interactions variables yielded a τ
00 value of 0.71, compared 1.28 in the null
model. This represents between–work group variance and, similar calculations to the above,
means the model with Level 2 components explained 45% (.45) of the explainable variance
between the work groups. Note that this is not the same thing as an OLS-based R2 statistic.
It represents the fraction of explainable variation that was explained by the model (Singer,
1998). Also, the weaker significance level (p < .05, t = 2.02) for the between-group variance
in the full model suggests there was less explainable variance present when compared with
the τ

00 value in the null model for depression (significant at p < .01, t = 2.71).
Based  on  the  covariance  parameters, calculations  like  those  done  for  the  depression
model showed that for anxiety, the Level 1 components diminished within-group variance by
(20.26-18.99)/20.26, which was .06 of the explainable variance within groups. The model
with all variables except Level 2 interactions explained 18% of explainable variance between
groups.  Upon  adding  the  Level  2  interactions, the  full  model  yielded  a τ
00 value  of  1.90,
down from 2.59 in the null model. This means Level 2 components after including interac-
tions explained 27% (.27) of the explainable variance between the work groups.

Discussion

The main contribution of this research was a demonstration that aggregate perceptions of
justice within a work group are significantly related to individual feelings of anxiety and
depression. Specifically, the interactive effect of distributive and procedural climate percep-
tions was a significant predictor of individual-level employee mental health, whereas orga-
nizational structure and interactional climate seemed less relevant. Such a finding highlights
the potential importance of distributive justice climate and warrants its future inclusion in
justice climate research, especially in an interactive form. Furthermore, the group-level inter-
relationships  were  above  and  beyond  the  direct  effects  of  individual  justice  perceptions.
Procedural and distributive justice climate interacted to affect anxiety and depression even
after accounting for individual levels of procedural, distributive, and interactional justice (or
associated individual-level interactions among these variables).

The findings of this study provide evidence that employee mental health is related to char-
acteristics of the work group’s justice climate. We found important interrelationships among
two types of justice climate and individual-level mental health. We showed that individual-
level  feelings  of  mental  health  were  related  to  the  justice  climate  as  developed  among
coworkers within the same work group. The multi-level analysis showed that, in fact, justice
climate accounted for a larger proportion of variance in mental health than individual-level
justice  perceptions.  Overall, the  results  showed  that  an  employee’s  mental  health  can  be
related to group-level phenomena as well as individual-level effects.

Justice Climate and Mental Health of Coworkers

Although  the  results  could  be  interpreted  in  light  of  individual-level  responses, it  is
important to recognize the multi-level, nested structure of the data used here. We found that
the climate of justice perceptions within a work group is related to differences in individual

levels of mental health among group members. This supports the premise that a socially
constructed, collective view of justice has implications for understanding the psychological
well-being of employees (Moliner et al., 2005). That is, the climate predicted how a given
individual within the group will feel. Such findings can be assessed in light of Liao and Rupp
(2005), who found justice climate to be related to organizational citizenship, although our
findings concerned more general attitudes connected to the work and considered interactions
of climate with structural elements.

Overall, of the variance in depression that was explained by between-group differences
(9% of all the variance in depression), 45% was accounted for by climate. For anxiety, 11%
of the variance was explained by between-group differences, 27% of which was accounted
for by climate. The individual-level variables accounted for 15% and 7% of the explained
within-group differences for depression and anxiety, respectively. It should also be noted that
we  did  not  observe  any  individual-level  interactions  or  group-level  main  effects, both  of
which have been obtained in previous research.

Interactions of Justice Climate Components and Mental Health

We found that procedural justice climate moderated the relationship between distributive
justice  climate  and  feelings  of  anxiety  and  depression, in  agreement  with  Hypothesis  1.
Although we did not study the emergence of climate and thus cannot provide evidence of a
social construction process, it could be the case that socially formed judgments of process
may moderate the negative effect of low distributive justice climate through a socially con-
structed judgment that the process used to arrive at outcomes is fair, even if the outcomes
themselves could be “better” (assuming higher is better). Furthermore, the significance of
the interaction suggests situations of low distributive justice climate make process examina-
tion more important to understand the nature of the inequity and the long-term effects of
maintaining group identity and minimizing discrepant feelings (Colquitt et al., 2002; Lind &
Van den Bos, 2002).

Although the interaction of distributive and procedural climate was significant, the influ-
ence  of  interactional  justice  climate  was  nonsignificant. As  Roberson  and  Colquitt  noted,
“Interactional justice [climate] should have somewhat weaker effects [than procedural jus-
tice], given that it originates in interpersonal exchanges with organizational representatives”
(2005: 598-599). Although Roberson and Colquitt were talking about this effect at a general
level, we think that it would be particularly true in relation to depression and anxiety. The
group might have a socially constructed feeling about a particular supervisor that is consis-
tent among employees, for example, but it would still be the result of individual interactions
that  would  likely  drive  one’s  psychological  well-being.  As  Greenberg  (2006)  found,
individual-level interactional justice is a logical moderator of distributive injustice, but the
data here suggest that consistent perceptions among a group that a supervisor is respectful
and courteous are not enough to overcome injustice in a significant manner. Still, given that
Moliner et al. (2005) did find significance in relation to interactional justice climate level and
employee exhaustion, further investigation is warranted.

Interaction of Mechanistic Structure and Justice Climate

Hypothesis 3 was not supported. Thus, as with interactional justice, structure appears less
important with climate variables than at the individual level (e.g., Ambrose & Schminke, 2003).
These effects may have been weaker than expected because the importance of a just process is
more salient for easing mental health in relation to ambiguous or uncertain events, such as low
distributive outcomes, rather than in reaffirming something of a more known nature, such as
organizational structure. That is, because understanding of just process or interactions within a
given organizational structure is less likely to be revisited once achieved (i.e., Colquitt et al.,
2002), the  socially  derived, aggregate  elements  of  climate  may  be  less  salient  than  when
attempting to gain understanding of distributive events, which could easily be recurrent.

Limitations

As with all studies, this one had limitations. First, this study used cross-sectional data col-
lection, asking about recent feelings of depression and anxiety, which was somewhat limit-
ing in relation to the potentially chronic nature of these dependent variables. However, recent
feelings would be more ably retrieved, shared, and linked with justice recollections.

We used a consensus approach to measure our Level 2 justice variables and not a refer-
ent  shift  measure. Although  the  consensus  approach  has  been  employed  in  other  justice
research, much of the recent literature recommends the referent shift approach. However, the
consensus-based measures have produced similar results to the referent shift method.

Another concern might be the conceptual overlap between anxiety and depression given
the  correlation  of  .61  between  the  two  scales.  But  in  a  recent  literature  review, Suls  and
Bunde (2005) concluded that depression, anxiety, and anger, although related, can be dis-
criminated with self-reports, and any evidence of overlap did not mean that the constructs
lack distinctive qualities (as demonstrated through confirmatory analysis).

Although we did several tests to check whether aggregation to the group level was appro-
priate, we  did  not  consider  the  degree  of  interaction  or  interdependence  on  a  daily  basis
between the groups. However, the results suggested the connections between the study vari-
ables occurred across a variety of groups.

Finally, there were unmeasured variables and relationships that might have contributed to
variation in our dependent variables, but our chief interest was specifically how aggregate
feelings of justice interact among themselves and with an overlaying structure. Our findings
represent an attempt to understand those particular relationships, and we pointed out how
justice perceptions at the group level, especially second-order effects, were correlated with
mental health of coworkers.

Managerial Implications

The findings presented here suggest the important role that collective perceptions of jus-
tice  played  in  the  formation  of  individual  employees’ mental  health.  Managers  should  be

aware of perceptions that develop and are shared in a work group. Water cooler and break
room talk can coalesce to have important effects on individual members of the group, specif-
ically in relation to justice judgments. Therefore, a manager’s understanding of the consis-
tency of individual employee perceptions of justice cannot be overstated. A consistently held
group  judgment  of  low  distributive  justice  combined  with  low  procedural  justice  would
likely have a horrible effect on the mental health of individual group members.

Another  implication  (and  direction  for  future  research)  concerns  actual  behavior  of
employees. Although our study is limited to affective states following Warr’s (1990, 1996)
models of mental health, the connection between these affective states and how employees
may behave in response to them is what concerns managers. Behavior arising out of dimin-
ished well-being might include, but not be limited to, absenteeism, turnover, reduced pro-
ductivity, and the free rider phenomenon in a work group. Although that is beyond the scope
of this article, our study pointed out the importance and value of considering effects across
levels  of  analysis, from  individual  to  group  and  larger  organizational  contexts, in  under-
standing employee mental health.
