We argue that conscientiousness is a context-speciﬁc disposition and its relationship
with contextual and innovative performance will be activated in certain organizational
cultures. We hypothesized that
the relationship between conscientiousness and
contextual performance would be higher in outcome-oriented cultures and the
relationship between conscientiousness and innovative job performance would be higher
in innovation-oriented cultures. These two hypotheses were not supported. We further
hypothesized and found support that conscientiousness and contextual and innovative
performance relationships are stronger in combined outcome- and innovation-oriented
cultures. Our results indicate that these two cultural values complement each other in
facilitating positive outcomes for conscientious employees.

Introduction

Conscientiousness has played an important role in recent interests in dispositional factors
that may affect employee behaviors such as performance. Quantitative reviews of the
conscientiousness – performance relationship have been encouraging. For example, Hurtz
and Donovan (2000) estimated the average corrected criterion-related validity for the
relationship between global conscientiousness and job performance to be 0.22. Recent
meta-analyses also reported that the overall average corrected validity coefﬁcients are
typically in the range of 0.09 – 0.20 (Barrick and Mount 1991; Tett, Jackson and Rothstein
1991). Conscientiousness has also been linked to other behavioral outcomes including
effective job-seeking behavior (Wanberg, Watt and Rumsey 1996), retention (Barrick,
Mount and Strauss 1994), and attendance at work (Judge, Martocchio and Thoresen 1997),
as well as intrinsic (various facets of satisfaction) and extrinsic (occupational status and
income) career success (Judge, Higgins, Thoresen and Barrick 1999). In summary, of the
major ﬁve factors, conscientiousness has shown the most consistent relationship with job
and task performance (Barrick, Mount and Judge 2001).

There is also variability, however, in the relationship between conscientiousness and
performance (Witt and Ferris 2003). Recent ﬁndings suggest that conscientiousness can
have a negative effect on performance outcomes when conscientious employees have to

perform under time pressure (Tett, Jackson, Rothstein and Reddon 1999) or to perform in
learning contexts (Colquitt, LePine and Noe 2000). These results have encouraged scholars
to look for moderators of the relationship between conscientiousness and performance
(Witt and Ferris 2003; Byrne, Stoner, Thompson and Hochwarter 2005). They have found
support for the moderating effects of variables such as job autonomy (Barrick and Mount
1993), social skill (Witt and Ferris 2003), organizational politics (Witt, Kacmar, Carlson
and Zivnuska 2002), work effort, and psychological climate (Byrne et al. 2005). In addition,
person – environment ﬁt (Simmering, Colquitt, Noe and Porter 2003) has predicted the
conscientiousness – development relationship.

Consistent with the line of research on moderators of the conscientiousness –
performance relationship, we suggest that the variability in the predictive power of
conscientiousness across studies may be accounted for by how contextual factors moderate
the effects of dispositional factors on employee behaviors. The person – situation interaction
framework has suggested the importance of considering the interactive effects of person
and situational variables in shaping human behaviors (cf. Simmering et al. 2003; Tett and
Burnett 2003; Buss 2009). Schneider (1975, 2001) suggests that organizational culture is an
important contextual variable and proposes that individuals actualize their potential when
organization culture is congruent with their own capabilities, work values, and interests.
In conscientious research, there is suggestive evidence that organizational contextual
variables would moderate the conscientiousness – performance relationship. For example,
time pressure, learning contexts, and situational variables point to the importance of
different contexts in shaping the conscientiousness – performance relationship.

Adopting the person–situation interactive framework, we theorize how a contextual
factor – organizational culture – would moderate the relationship between conscientiousness
and two types of performance – contextual performance (Borman and Motowidlo 1997) and
innovative performance (Scott and Bruce 1994). We discuss why conscientious employees
are more likely to attend to contextual cues. We operationalize contextual cues as outcome
orientation and innovation orientation (Tsui, Wang and Xin 2006). We argue that the
existence of strong outcome-oriented and innovation-oriented cultures in companies will
activate conscientiousness and focus it more on high performance, an effect that will be less
pronounced in cultures with low levels of these orientations. We further argue that these two
cultural dimensions complement each other
in facilitating positive outcomes for
conscientious employees. In the following sections, we ﬁrst examine the conscientious-
ness–performance relationship and then outcome and innovation orientations as cultural
characteristics. Finally, we consider the conscientiousness–performance relationship within
cultures characterized by different levels of outcome and innovation orientations.

Theoretical background and hypotheses

The conscientiousness – performance relationship

Conscientious people tend to be reliable, hardworking, self-disciplined, and persevering
(McCrae and Costa 1987). Conscientiousness indicates that a person feels a strong sense of
responsibility for aspects of their lives that are relevant to them. When a person is
conscientious, they carefully examine their duties to ensure that they are acting and
thinking in a consistent manner with their own beliefs. They think before they act; they
plan, prioritize, and follow rules and procedures (Witt 2002). McCrae and Costa (1999)
suggest that conscientious individuals often have long-term plans, technical expertise, and
an organized support network. Conscientious employees are more likely to take initiatives
in, be responsible for, and maintain sustained effort in accomplishing their tasks. In

H. Wang et al.

summary, conscientious employees are by nature more motivated to sustain their effort
in accomplishing their tasks effectively. Thus, it is of little surprise that conscientious is an
important dispositional predictor of job performance as high performance on many jobs
requires this kind of motivation.

Conscientiousness is closely related to van Scotter and Motowidlo’s (1996) job
dedication deﬁnition, which is exempliﬁed through behaviors such as following rules,
working hard, and taking initiative (Witt et al. 2002). Witt et al. (2002) posited that
conscientiousness relates positively to job dedication because highly conscientious
workers seek opportunities to do the right thing, pay attention to and identify what needs
to be done, and follow the rules (Witt and Ferris 2003). Thus, contextual performance is
motivation based and is conceptually tied to conscientiousness. One dimension of
contextual performance is job dedication, which is exempliﬁed through behaviors such as
following rules, working hard, and taking initiative (Witt et al. 2002). Job dedication is
directly related to conscientiousness as conscientious employees are more likely to follow
rules, work hard, and take initiatives. The other dimension of contextual performance is
interpersonal facilitation, which is an interpersonally oriented behavior that contributes to
organizational goal accomplishment (van Scotter and Motowidlo 1996). According to
Witt and Ferris (2003, p. 810), conscientiousness should also predict interpersonal
facilitation because ‘conscientious workers are likely to listen and attend to the details
important to others, respect social protocol, and be thorough in following up on matters
important to others, creating the impression of cooperation and sensitivity’. Another type
of performance that may be related to conscientiousness is innovative performance
(Miron, Erez and Naveh 2004) or the implementation of creative and new ideas. The
implementation of new ideas often requires competent, self-disciplined, and dutiful
conscientious people (Costa and McCrae 1992). Technically competent employees who
give up early because of frequent failures would lose out in innovative performance to
even less technically competent employees if the latter employees stay with their jobs.
Thus, employees who have sustained motivation in continuously hacking on the task are
more likely to innovate.

Organizations may differ in how they prioritize and what they deﬁne as important
components of performance. Miron et al. (2004) note that there is a body of literature on
variations in organizational cultures – the embodiment of what is of high priority and
important as codiﬁed in a set of values, norms, and rules. Some organizations emphasize
process and/or quality, and innovation, whereas others emphasize outcomes and efﬁciency.
In this case, what is emphasized in a speciﬁc context, for example, in terms of organizational
culture, may shape the relationship between conscientiousness and contextual and
innovative performance.

Outcome-oriented and innovation-oriented cultures

Considering the main characteristics of conscientious employees, it is hardly surprising
that despite the consistent positive effects of conscientiousness on performance, the
conscientiousness – performance relationship has variability. We suggest
this
variability can be examined in terms of a contextual variable – organizational culture.
As discussed above, conscientious employees are reliable, hardworking, self-disciplined,
and persevering. These characteristics suggest that conscientious employees are more
likely to sustain consistent and inordinate effort in completing their work. With such effort,
it is more likely that employees perform well in their jobs. Conscientious employees are
also mindful of what is required from them. For example, conscientious employees follow

that

rules and procedures. They also seek opportunities to do the right thing and pay attention to
and identify what needs to be done. Because of this tendency to pay attention to the
requirements of the speciﬁc context, or organizational culture, conscientious employees are
more likely to put effort into speciﬁc components of their performance as suggested by the
situation they are in. Consequently, conscientious employees are likely to interpret what is
required of them by an organization and exert disproportional effort by setting priorities into
these components of performance. Conscientious employees are likely to exert sustainable
and inordinate efforts into areas that are of higher priorities. Organizations may differ in
how they prioritize and what they deﬁne as important components of performance. In this
case, what is emphasized in a speciﬁc context, for example, in terms of organizational
culture, may shape the relationship between conscientiousness and performance.

Organizational culture is a set of beliefs and values shared by members of the same
organization that inﬂuences their behaviors (Schein 1990, 1999; O’Reilly, Chatman and
Caldwell 1991). Culture reﬂects common ways of thinking and behaving. According to
O’Reilly et al. (1991), outcome-oriented organizations are demanding and bent on
achieving results. An outcome-oriented culture emphasizes efﬁciency and productivity,
stresses the importance of getting things done, presses for on-time delivery of products and
services, and maintains a faster pace than that of competitors while simultaneously
controlling operational costs (Miron et al. 2004). An innovative culture reﬂects a learning
orientation (Amabile 1996; Glynn 1996) that facilitates inventiveness (Cohen and
Levinthal 1990) combined with the pursuit of new and prospective knowledge (Levinthal
and March 1993). Organizations with an innovative culture emphasize readiness to accept
changes (Tsui et al. 2006).

According to Miron et al. (2004),

the literature is inconsistent regarding the
relationships between cultural dimensions that promote innovation, performance quality,
and efﬁciency. Similar to the description offered by Sutcliffe, Sitkin and Browning (1999),
the ﬁrst approach suggests the trade-off between cultures, for example, emphasizing
innovation or exploration versus cultures emphasizing control or reliability of outcomes.
This approach suggests that the innovation orientation competes with efﬁciency whereas the
outcome orientation emphasizing control competes with innovation. Thus, the approach
suggests that innovation- and outcome-oriented cultures are at the expense of each other.
The second approach describes these two cultural orientations as independent dimensions
that are important to organizations as in the study of O’Reilly et al. (1991). The third
approach presents a synergistic system whereby both cultural orientations can be mutually
reinforcing. It may be necessary for organizations to provide rules, routines, and standards,
and at the same time emphasize the creation of innovative knowledge. Our intention is to
compare the competing, independent, and balanced approaches in affecting contextual and
innovative job performance. The ﬁrst two hypotheses reﬂect our prediction regarding
the independent approach and the third hypothesis reﬂects our prediction regarding the
competing and balanced approaches.

Culture as a moderator of the conscientiousness – performance relationship

Trait activation theory proposes that the presence of a trait is not enough to activate its
effect. However, the presence of trait-relevant contextual cues would activate such effects
(Tett and Burnett 2003). Tett and Burnett’s (2003) person – situation interactionist or trait
activation model of job performance explicitly focuses on situations as moderators of
personality trait expression and in evaluation of those expressions as job performance.
Personality traits are expressed as responses to trait-relevant situational cues (Tett and


178

H. Wang et al.

Guterman 2000). For example, if a time-focused individual is confronted with waiting in
long lines, this situation would activate the individual to ﬁnd a shorter line.

Tett and Burnett (2003) propose three sources or levels of trait-relevant cues – task,
social, and organizational – as moderators of the personality trait relationship with job
performance. We focus on the organizational cues of outcome- and innovation-oriented
organizational cultures. Tett and Burnett (2003) note that culture and climate provide
unique opportunities for personality trait expressions. Their notion is supported by Judge
and Cable’s (1997) ﬁnding that people prefer to work in cultures similar to their own
personalities. We argue that the individual’s propensity to engage in job-related behavior
is strongly inﬂuenced by their work context, which may either inhibit or facilitate its effect
on individual behavior (Schneider 1975; Michel 1977). For example, if an organization’s
culture is congruent with an individual’s work values, interest, and capabilities, it is likely
that the individual will be happier and more productive.

In this study, we propose that organizational cultural elements related to outcome and
innovation orientation are contextual factors that should moderate the relationship
between conscientiousness and contextual job performance. An outcome-oriented culture,
where people in the organization are concerned about product quantity and results, should
activate conscientious employees to work hard, be reliable, and be disciplined. Such an
organizational context should lead to higher levels of individual performance. Recently,
Miron et al. (2004) found that the interaction between conscientiousness and an outcome-
oriented culture yielded a positive effect on performance efﬁciency. Miron et al.’s study
suggested that a culture that promotes an outcome orientation is a fertile environment for
conscientious employees. Such an organizational culture provides conscientious
employees the opportunity to express themselves because they are achievement oriented
(hardworking and persistent), dependable (responsible and careful), and orderly (plan
oriented and organized). Therefore, we predict that

H1:

An outcome-oriented culture moderates the relationship between conscientious-
ness and contextual performance. Speciﬁcally, conscientious employees have
higher levels of performance in a culture that has a high outcome orientation.

In addition to replicating the positive relationship between conscientiousness and
contextual performance, we also examine the less-studied relationship between
conscientiousness and innovative job performance. Innovative job performance can be
deﬁned as intentional idea generation, idea promotion, and idea realization within a work
role, work group, or organization in order to improve individual, group, or organization
performance (Kanter 1988; Scott and Bruce 1994; Janssen and van Yperen 2004).
Conscientiousness includes traits that reﬂect being careful,
thorough, responsible,
organized, hardworking, and persevering (Barrick and Mount 1991). As these traits reﬂect
caring for the organization’s success or goal accomplishment, conscientious employees
may also demonstrate innovative job performance given the appropriate organizational
context.

Similarly, an innovative organizational context can serve as an important sense-
making function (Weick 1993) for conscientious employees. An innovative organizational
culture may activate a conscientious individual to become creative and innovative.
Innovative job performance is more likely to occur when the culture supports innovation
(Miron et al. 2004). Just as an outcome-oriented organizational culture can activate a
conscientious employee to perform on a higher level, an innovative organizational culture
should also activate conscientious employees to express themselves by being more
creative and innovative. This is because an innovative culture tends to provide employees

with more ﬂexibility in determining the best way to accomplish tasks and gives them the
discretion to take risks (Scott and Bruce 1994; Byrne et al. 2005). We argue that an
innovative organizational culture will activate high levels of performance in conscientious
employees. Speciﬁcally, we predict that

H2:

An innovation-oriented culture moderates the relationship between conscientious-
ness and innovative performance. Speciﬁcally, conscientious employees have
higher levels of innovative performance in a culture that is high in innovation
orientation.

We contend that both innovative- and outcome-oriented cultures should be used to
balance the strictness of producing results with the ﬂexibility and conditions for
innovation. Therefore, we suggest, as in the balanced and not in the competing approach,
that both cultural orientations are necessary to activate both contextual and innovative job
performance in conscientious individuals. As suggested earlier, conscientious individuals
have a high need for achievement and an outcome-oriented organizational culture would
activate their values for contextual performance, whereas an innovative organizational
culture would activate their motivation to innovate. It is possible that these two cultural
orientations would jointly activate higher contextual and innovative performance in
conscientious people. This is because although an outcome-oriented culture would set the
performance norms for conscientious people, the innovation-oriented culture would entice
them to, based on the understood performance norms, go beyond simply doing a good job.
Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:

H3:

The relationship between conscientiousness and contextual and innovative
performance is
jointly moderated by innovation- and outcome-oriented
cultures such that the effect of conscientiousness on contextual and innovative
performance will be greater when the levels of both cultural orientations
are high.

Methods

This study was conducted from 13 subsidiaries of the electronics ﬁrm in the areas of
telecommunications, information technology, and home appliances in China. Ownership
by this Japanese ﬁrm varied in these companies from 50 to 100%, as told to us in interviews
with key informants. These supervisors’ managers (21 in total) attended a management
training seminar conducted by one of the authors. Each manager was invited to help collect
data for our study. These 21 managers were asked to select ﬁve of their employees at the
supervisor level who reported directly to them (the total number of supervisors was thus
105) to participate in the study. These supervisors were instructed to randomly select two of
their subordinates to participate in the study. Separate questionnaires were developed and
administered to the supervisors and their two subordinates. Each subordinate completed the
questionnaire on conscientiousness, and provided demographic information. The
supervisors reported on their beliefs regarding the organization’s culture. They were also
asked to evaluate each subordinate’s contextual and innovative job performance.
Respondents were assured that their responses would be kept conﬁdential. A pre-addressed,
postage paid envelope allowed participants to return their completed questionnaire directly
to the researchers. By deleting the unmatched dyads, the ﬁnal sample consisted of 176
employees and 92 immediate managers. The response rates for the supervisor and
subordinate sample were 86.7 and 82.4%, respectively.

H. Wang et al.

Of the 176 subordinate respondents, 50.9% were male, with an average age of 28.48
years (SD ¼ 4.21), organizational tenure of 4.17 years (SD ¼ 3.65), post-secondary
education of 7.09 years (SD ¼ 1.86), and a relationship with their immediate supervisors
for 3.07 years (SD ¼ 2.80). Among the 92 supervisors, 68.7% were male, with an average
age of 35.19 years (SD ¼ 5.02) and organizational tenure of 7.28 years (SD ¼ 3.74). All
held college degrees and 65.8% of them held a middle- or upper-level managerial position.

Measures

Subordinate measures

To assure measure equivalence in the Chinese and English versions of the questionnaires,
scales used in this study were translated into Chinese and then translated independently
back into English (Brislin 1980). Expert
judges in Chinese also examined the
questionnaire to ensure that the items were interpretable in Chinese.

As in Miron et al. (2004), conscientiousness was measured using two sub-dimensions of
self-discipline and achievement striving. According to Miron et al. (2004), these two sub-
dimensions are most relevant for predicting outcome orientation and efﬁcient performance.
The four-item scale used a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ‘strongly disagree’ to 5
‘strongly agree.’ The items were ‘I try to excel in everything I do’; ‘I determine my pace of
work in order to accomplish the tasks on time’; ‘I work hard to fulﬁll my objectives’; and ‘ I
am self-disciplined.’ Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient was 0.82.

Supervisor measures

As in Tsui et al. (2006), culture was assessed by the supervisors, who were asked to indicate
on a 5-point scale the extent to which each item described the company’s outcome-oriented
culture. The scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Outcome-
oriented culture was measured with three items, ‘aiming for the highest performance,’
‘caring for society’s development,’ and ‘emphasizing economic as well as social proﬁts’
(Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.74). Innovation-oriented culture was measured with three items, ‘ready
to accept changes,’ ‘developing new products and services continuously,’ and ‘encouraging
innovation’ (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.62). Cronbach’s a for innovation-oriented culture, though
marginal, was still within the acceptable range for scales in the developmental stage
(Nunnally 1978).

Innovative job performance was assessed using Janssen’s (2000, 2001) 9-item scale of
individual innovation in the workplace, which draws on Kanter’s (1988) work on the
stages of innovation. Three items refer to idea generation, three items to idea promotion,
and the remaining three to idea realization. Immediate supervisors rated how often the
employee performed the nine innovative work behaviors in the workplace (1, ‘never’ to 5,
‘always’). Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for this scale was 0.93.

Supervisors rated their subordinates’ individual contextual performance using the
Chinese version of a 15-item scale developed by van Scotter and Motowidlo (1996), which
was later translated by Wang, Law and Chen (2002). Response options ranged from (1) ‘not
at all likely’ to (5) ‘extremely likely.’ Following the stem ‘While performing his or her job,
how likely is it that this employee would . . . ,’ supervisors rated the likelihood that an
immediate subordinate would ‘ . . . praise coworkers when they are successful?’
(interpersonal facilitation) and ‘ . . . persist in overcoming obstacles to complete a task?’
(job dedication). Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for interpersonal facilitation was 0.76 and for job
dedication it was 0.86.

Control variables

We included several demographic controls that may inﬂuence our variables of interest.
The respondents’ age, gender, educational level, and organizational tenure (measured in
years) were obtained from subordinate surveys.

Results

The individual measures used in the present study had sufﬁcient internal consistency.
Subordinates provided information on conscientiousness only. Supervisors provided
information on both culture dimensions and performance. To examine the psychometric
properties of the variables from the same source (i.e. supervisors), we ran a conﬁrmatory
factor analysis (CFA) on these variables using LISREL 8.03. As we had quite a few
indicators in our model (34) relative to the sample size after deleting cases with missing
data (N ¼ 176), we simpliﬁed the structural model by reducing the number of indicators
for some of the constructs. The number of items was reduced by averaging the items with
the highest and lowest factor loadings from our exploratory factor analyses. Then, the
items with the next highest and the next lowest loadings were averaged to form the second
new indicator of each construct. This procedure of reducing the number of indicators has
been frequently used in the structural equation modeling literature for increasing statistical
power (Mathieu and Farr 1991; Mathieu, Hofmann and Farr 1993). The ﬁt indices yielded
acceptable results (X 2 ¼ 243.42, degree of section ¼ 94, p , 0.01; CFI ¼ 0.94,
IFI ¼ 0.94; RMSR ¼ 0.05).

Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, correlations, and coefﬁcient alpha
reliabilities for the variables used in this study. Table 2 presents the hierarchical moderated
regressions to test our hypotheses (Cohen and Cohen 1983). We followed the same general
procedure for each of the hierarchical moderated multiple regressions. The ﬁrst step
consisted of entering age, gender, education, and organizational tenure as control variables
as one block into the equation. In the second step, we entered the two independent variables
of conscientiousness and outcome-oriented or innovation-oriented cultures. On the
ﬁnal step, we entered the cross-product term. Support for a moderating effect exists if the R 2
for the interaction term is signiﬁcant. To support the speciﬁc effect hypothesized, the slopes
of the interaction terms must be in the predicted direction.

As shown in Table 2, no two-way interaction term was signiﬁcant. However, the three-
way interaction between conscientiousness, innovation-oriented, and outcome-oriented
cultures signiﬁcantly predicted both the interpersonal facilitation dimension of contextual
performance (DR 2 ¼ 0.02, DF ¼ 3.40, p , 0.10) and innovative performance
(DR 2 ¼ 0.03, DF ¼ 4.91, p , 0.05). Figure 1(a,d) shows the interactions. Figure 1(a)
shows that when innovation-oriented and outcome-oriented cultures are low, there is no
relationship between conscientiousness and interpersonal facilitation. However, with high
levels of innovation-oriented culture, the conscientious employees show lower levels of
interpersonal facilitation when the outcome-oriented culture is low. Figure 1(b) shows that
when the outcome-oriented culture is high, more conscientious employees show lower
levels of interpersonal facilitation when the innovation-oriented culture is low. Moreover,
when both cultural orientations are high, the conscientious employees display higher
levels of interpersonal facilitation than when the innovation-oriented culture is low.

Figure 1(c,d) shows the interactive relationships on innovative job performance.
Similar to the effects on interpersonal facilitation, when both cultural orientations are low,
there is a weak relationship between conscientiousness and innovative job performance.
However, as just shown in Figure 1(a), when the outcome-oriented culture is high and the

innovation-oriented culture is low, the more conscientiousness employees show lower
levels of innovative job performance. Figure 1(d) shows that when the outcome-oriented
culture is high and the innovation-oriented culture is low, there is no relationship between
conscientiousness and innovative job performance. However, when both cultural
orientations are high, the more conscientious employees have higher levels of innovative
job performance than the less conscientious employees have. In summary, the form of the
relationship supports the third hypothesis as it reveals that conscientious employees
showed higher contextual and innovative performance when both innovation-oriented and
outcome-oriented cultures are high outcome than when both these cultures orientations are
low. As such, our results support the balanced approach and do not support the competing
or the independent approaches of both cultural orientations on innovation and contextual
performance.

Discussion and conclusions

Using trait activation theory, we hypothesized that conscientiousness and contextual
performance would be positively related when accompanied by an outcome-oriented
culture and that conscientiousness and innovative performance would be strongly related
when accompanied by an innovation-oriented organizational culture. We further

hypothesized that contextual and innovative performance would be strongest when
accompanied by outcome-oriented and innovation-oriented cultures. The results of our
study show that the two-way interactions were not signiﬁcant. However, conscientious-
ness was positively related to contextual (interpersonal facilitation) and innovative job
performance when the unit’s culture promotes both innovation and outcomes. Similar to
Byrne et al. (2005), our results suggest being conscientious is not enough to affect
performance unless the organization promotes cultural norms or contextual cues to
facilitate contextual and innovative job performance.

The results of our study suggest that emphasizing one pole only (either innovation- or
outcome-oriented culture) for conscientious employees is not good enough for positive
organizational outcomes such as higher contextual or innovative job performance. Rather,
it is important for organizations to focus on both types of cultures. In support of the
balanced approach, our study suggests that the cultural values of innovation and outcome
orientation can co-exist (Levinthal and March 1993; Brown and Eisenhardt 1998; Adler,
Goldoftas and Levin 1999; Argote 1999; Miron et al. 2004). This approach emphasizes the
need to balance these two apparently opposing values. Thus, balancing the norms for
producing results on time with a ﬂexibility that ensures proper conditions for innovation
appears to be best for conscientious employees in our context. Our study is the ﬁrst to show
that both cultural types can co-exist to facilitate performance in conscientious employees.

Theoretical contributions

Results of our study make potential contributions to the personality and motivation
literature. First, we have identiﬁed organizational culture, in addition to psychological
climate and work effort (Byrne et al. 2005), social skill, and social skill awareness (Witt and
Ferris 2003) as moderators of the conscientiousness and work outcome relationship. Second,
as in Byrne et al. 2005, we examine organizational culture as another theoretically relevant
moderator via trait activation theory and extend the theoretical perspective to suggest that
the relationships of conscientiousness to outcomes depend on the speciﬁc organizational
context. Variability in contexts can activate conscientious individuals to act in ways that are
consistent with the environment they are in. Third, as evidenced by the lack of two-way
interactions, our results suggest that an outcome- or innovation-oriented culture does not
have independent nor competing effects on conscientious employees for higher contextual
or innovative job performance. That is, when the innovation culture is strong and the
outcome orientation is weak,
the relationships between conscientiousness with
interpersonal facilitation and innovative job performance are weak. It is when both
cultural norms are strong that the relationships between conscientiousness and interpersonal
facilitation and innovative job performance are strong. These two cultural norms do have
complementary effects in activating conscientious employees to make greater contributions
to the organization. It is possible that when there is little or no outcome orientation,
conscientious employees may try too hard and not be focused enough. With an outcome
orientation, conscientious employees are much more focused and can direct their effort at
contextual and innovative job performance. Our results indicate that the two cultural
orientations have complementary effects rather than having competing or independent
effects on conscientious employees.

Consistent with previous meta-analytic studies, conscientiousness was positively
related to contextual performance across jobs and occupations (Barrick and Mount 1991;
Tett et al. 1991; Mount and Barrick 1995; Hurtz and Donovan 2000; Dudley, Orvis,
Lebiecki and Cortina 2006). Thus, people who see themselves as hardworking, reliable,


186

H. Wang et al.

and organized appear to perform better than those who believe they do not possess these
characteristics. These conscientious people also showed higher levels of innovative
performance in our sample. Future studies may go beyond studying the associations
between conscientiousness with task and contextual performance to include innovative
performance. This is because, in order to be competitive, organizations need to ﬁnd the
right balance between focusing on efﬁciency and productivity versus giving employees
the freedom to adapt to problems and opportunities.

Limitations and future research

This study has several limitations. The ﬁrst is that common method bias may be a
concern. With the exception of conscientiousness, information on most variables in this
study was provided by the supervisors. We also followed the recommendations from
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee and Podasakoff (2003) in conducting the Harman one-factor
test. Results of this test indicated a very bad ﬁt and, therefore, we do not believe that
common method variance affected our results. Furthermore, common method variance
should not be a signiﬁcant threat in a study that tests moderating effects (i.e. different
relationships at different levels of a speciﬁed variable). Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler and
Martin (1997) note that if common method variance explains signiﬁcant relationships,
there is no reason why there should be a signiﬁcant relationship at one level of a variable
but not at another.

Second, our study was conducted in one organization. Although this may reduce the
generalizability of our ﬁndings, testing our hypothesized model in one organization
reduces the likelihood that contextual factors such as industry type might affect our results.
However, our ﬁndings are consistent with other studies because conscientiousness was
also positively related to in-role performance and contextual performance. Future studies
should examine other contextual situations that may also activate higher levels of
contribution in conscientious individuals.

Practical implications and conclusion

Our ﬁndings, together with recent research, suggest the utility of examining the role of
theoretically relevant contextual effects in moderating the relationship between
conscientiousness and performance. Our results indicated that conscientious people can
have strong innovative job performance provided that they work in the appropriate work
context. It is not enough simply to select the right people and place them in the appropriate
jobs. It is also important to provide the appropriate norms or cultural values that can
cultivate people’s performance.
