 Managers from 24 geopolitical entities provided data on work locus of control, job
 satisfaction, psychological strain, physical strain, and individualism/collectivism. The
 hypothesis that the salutary effects of perceived control on well-being are universal
 was supported because relations of work locus of control with well-being at work were
 similar in almost all the sampled areas. Furthermore, the individualism/collectivism
 level of each sample did not moderate the magnitude of correlations of work locus of
 control with measures of well-being. Findings indicate that control beliefs contribute to
 well-being universally, but we suggest that how control is manifested can still differ.

 Many authors have noted that cross-national
 management research is now needed more than
 ever because it can no longer be assumed that
 American concepts and theories transcend culture
 and national boundaries (e.g., Boyacigiller & Adler,
 1991; Peng, Peterson, & Shyi, 1991; Trompenaars &
 Hampden-Turner, 1998). For instance, the issue of
 employee control, both as a perception and as a
 generalized belief (locus of control), has played a
 primary role in theories of organizational behavior
 and stress (Ganster & Fusilier, 1989) in the U.S.
 and other Western management literature. In the
 present study, we examined whether control be-
 liefs operate in a similar way universally by pro-
 viding results from 24 geopolitical entitiesl regard-
 ing how locus of control in the workplace relates to
 job satisfaction and well-being.

 beliefs are an important component of emotional
 adjustment and ability to handle stress in general
 life (e.g., Kobasa, Maddi, & Kahn, 1982) and at work
 (Spector, 1982). Locus of control in the workplace
 in particular (that is, belief that one has control at
 work) has likewise been linked to employee well-
 being (e.g., Spector, 1988; Spector & O'Connell,
 1994). In sum, research supports the notion that
 internality is associated with positive well-being
 both on and off the job. Our first hypothesis states
 the universality of such a relation:

 Hypothesis 1. Work locus of control will be
 correlated with measures of well-being (inter-
 nality associated with positive well-being) uni-
 versally across nations and territories.

 THEORY AND HYPOTHESES

 Locus of Control as an Exclusively
 Western Phenomenon

 Locus of Control as a Universal Component of
 Well-Being

 Prominent theories have linked perceptions of
 control in various forms to employee well-being
 (broadly conceptualized to include positive atti-
 tudes and absence of physical and psychological
 symptoms) as well as to other variables. For exam-
 ple, in their job characteristics model, Hackman
 and Oldham (1976) considered autonomy to be a
 major cause of job satisfaction and positive adjust-
 ment to work. In Karasek's (1979) demands-control
 stress model, the hypothesis is that control at work
 buffers the impact of job stressors on well-being.
 Spector's (1986) meta-analysis showed that per-
 ceived autonomy and participation at work were
 related to job satisfaction and other measures of
 well-being. In their review of the workplace control
 literature, Ganster and Fusilier (1989) concluded
 that control was a vital element of well-being. In
 addition, management approaches that empower
 employees by giving them more control have been
 advocated as both effective and humane (Block,
 1993; Lawler, Mohrman, & Ledford, 1995).

 Research has shown the importance of not only
 perceptions of control in the immediate work envi-
 ronment, but also of a person's more general beliefs
 about control. Locus of control, perhaps the most
 studied control-related variable, reflects a person's
 belief in personal control in life (internality) rather
 than in control by outside forces or individuals
 (externality). It has been noted that internal control

 1 Most of the entities were nation-states. However,

 Hong Kong and Taiwan were included, as well as the
 People's Republic of China (PRC).

 There is reason to expect cross-national differ-
 ences in how work locus of control might relate to
 well-being (Pervin, 1999). Individualism/collectiv-
 ism has been studied extensively in relation to
 culture. As Triandis (1995) explained, individual-
 ism is a tendency for people to view themselves as
 independent entities who are motivated primarily
 by their own goals and preferences. It has been
 described as a reflection of the independent self
 (Markus & Kitayama, 1998) and an expression of
 the need for self-sufficiency (Kagitgibasi, 1994).
 Collectivism is a tendency for individuals to view
 themselves as parts of one or more social groups
 whose motivation is based mainly on group goals
 and norms. It has been described as a reflection of
 the interdependent self (Markus & Kitayama, 1998)
 and an expression of the need for relatedness
 (Kagitgibasi, 1994). Nations considered to be indi-
 vidualistic are to be found primarily in the Anglo-
 European world, whereas nations considered col-
 lectivistic come from Asia and Latin America, as
 well as other regions of the world.

 Gudykunst (1998) noted that members of indi-
 vidualistic cultures are taught to value indepen-
 dence and achievement through their own actions.
 They view themselves and others as having direct
 control over various aspects of life. Members of
 collectivist cultures are taught to value harmony
 and solidarity with others (Markus & Kitayama,
 1991). Because they accept subordination of indi-
 vidual to group interests, they view the group as
 having legitimate control over their actions. These
 differences can be seen clearly in a study by Lund-
 berg and Peterson (1994), who found that Japanese
 considered work autonomy to be less important
 than did Americans. Smith, Trompenaars, and Du-

 Spector et al.

 gan (1995) also found that, at the country level,
 individualism was associated with a belief in indi-
 vidual autonomy.

 Weisz, Rothbaum, and Blackburn (1984) com-

 pared views of control in the individualist United
 States and collectivist Japan. They noted that in the
 United States, the emphasis is on primary control,
 in which individuals attempt direct control over
 situations through independent action. In Japan,
 there is more emphasis on secondary control,
 whereby individuals experience feelings of control
 indirectly, either by aligning themselves with pow-
 erful others or by modifying interpretations of a
 situation, thereby controlling its effects (that is, by
 regulating emotional reactions). Our United States-
 developed locus of control scales mainly reflect
 beliefs about primary control, neglecting the sec-
 ondary control that may be more important in other
 nations.

 1998; Markus & Kitayama, 1998). Thus, we would
 expect an individual trait such as locus of control
 to be predictive of attitudes and behavior more
 consistently in individualist countries. Finally, in
 individualist countries, people are encouraged to
 autonomously regulate their distress (Friedlmeier &
 Trommsdorff, 1999) rather than to seek consolation
 from others, thereby making personal control a
 more important element of well-being. In contrast,
 collectivist emotional regulation is more depen-
 dent on others.

 In summary, a belief in personal control should

 be more efficacious in individualist than in collec-
 tivist countries. This leads to our second hypothesis:

 Hypothesis 2. Individualism/collectivism will
 moderate the relation between locus of control
 and well-being in such a way that this relation-
 ship will be stronger in individualist countries.

 The Current Study

 There have been several studies of general locus

 of control in the cross-cultural domain, but find-
 ings have been somewhat inconsistent (Hui, 1982;
 Smith, Trompenaars, & Dugan, 1995). Studies have
 shown that, in general, Confucian Asians (such as
 the Chinese and Japanese) are more external in
 their locus of control than are the more individu-
 alistic Americans and other Western nationals
 (Hamid, 1994; Hui, 1982). Arguments have been
 advanced that the people of the former Soviet block
 nations in Eastern Europe should also be more ex-
 ternal in their locus of control than the people of
 Western nations owing to the prior state-dominated
 system that limited individual control over work
 and other life domains (Frese, Kring, Soose, & Zem-
 pel, 1996; Tobacyk & Tobacyk, 1992).

 From a theoretical perspective, for several rea-
 sons we would predict that the relation between
 locus of control and well-being will be smaller in
 collectivist than in individualist countries. First,
 collectivists are socialized to subordinate their own
 personal control, and thus a collectivist will de-
 velop secondary, rather than primary, control strat-
 egies to deal with his or her environment. Second,
 in collectivist countries, people expect to have lim-
 ited direct and immediate personal control, and so
 failure to have it will be less distressing. In the
 United States and other individualist nations, it
 might be argued that having an external locus of
 control is actually an indicator of poor adjustment
 (Phares, 1976).

 Third, it has been maintained that the idea of

 behavior being driven by stable dispositions is very
 much rooted in individualism, whereas behavior in
 collectivist societies is more context-specific and
 driven by the environment (Church & Lonner,

 In this report, we describe results of a study
 conducted in 24 geopolitical entities spread across
 five continents. The aim was to choose locations so
 that a wide range of cultures and individualism/
 collectivism would be represented. We chose sev-
 eral Anglo and Western European nations to repre-
 sent the individualist category and both Asian and
 Eastern European entities to represent collectivism.
 Since our purpose was to compare employees' lo-
 cus of control across geopolitical entities, we at-
 tempted to hold the nature of the jobs constant as
 much as possible and to make our samples as rep-
 resentative as possible. We chose the manager role
 as one that exists across nations and tried to select
 participants who were representative of this occu-
 pation in each country. We collected demographic
 information on age, education, gender, marital sta-
 tus, and organizational tenure to serve as controls.
 Furthermore, we included a measure of individu-
 alism in our survey, to provide an up-to-date mea-
 sure reflecting the values of the managers them-
 selves. This measure provided a more accurate
 indication of individualism for each sampled entity
 than archival measures that might not reflect pos-
 sible change over place and time would have pro-
 vided. Finally, we decided to assess locus of con-
 trol specifically in the workplace. Beliefs about
 control can vary across domains of life (Phares,
 1976). However, since our interest was in the rela-
 tion of work-related factors to well-being, it seemed
 most appropriate to assess beliefs about workplace
 control rather than control in general.

 METHODS

 Samples and Participants

 The results reported here are part of the Collab-

 orative International Study of Managerial Stress
 (CISMS), established in 1996 by the two project
 directors (C. L. Cooper and P. E. Spector). Follow-
 ing the approach of Peterson and Smith and their
 colleagues (1995), the project directors compiled a
 list of geopolitical entities that would represent a
 broad range of cultures. For each entity, researchers
 were invited to participate. Each of these invitees
 was either personally acquainted with, or was re-
 ferred by people known to, the project directors.
 Data were available for 24 samples (see Table 1,
 below), but data on individualism/collectivism
 were not collected in Australia, making it necessary
 to leave out this sample for the test of Hypothesis 2.
 (As was noted, we use the term "geopolitical enti-
 ties" because we have three Chinese samples, from
 the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.) In our 24 sam-
 ples, five of the eight "country clusters" designated
 by Ronen and Shenkar (1985) were represented
 (Anglo, Far Eastern, Germanic, Latin, European,
 and Nordic), as well as all four of the areas those
 authors labeled "independents" (Brazil, India, Is-
 rael, and Japan). Additional details on this project
 can be obtained from the authors or at the following
 Web site: http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/-spector.

 The original plan was to keep participants' job
 type constant (manager) and to collect data using
 methods that would achieve reasonable represen-
 tativeness. Although we achieved the first objective
 in every case, the second was more difficult. In five
 samples, data were collected in only one or two
 organizations (the PRC, Germany, India, Romania,
 and the United Kingdom), and in Sweden eight
 organizations were represented. In the remaining
 samples, procedures were used to cover a wide
 range of organizations. This was accomplished in
 some instances by sampling members of manage-
 ment organizations such as the chamber of com-
 merce (in Canada, for instance), or an institute of
 management (in New Zealand, for one). In other
 cases, we conducted mail surveys using a manage-
 ment directory as a sampling frame (Hong Kong
 was one such case), or by mailing questionnaires to
 a random sample of managers in businesses and
 offices in a city (in the United States). Multiple
 methods and locations were used in some samples
 to expand representativeness (in Hong Kong,
 Spain, and the United States, among others).

 Participants were 5,185 managers from 24 geopo-
 litical entities who completed our questionnaire
 voluntarily and for no compensation. Sample sizes
 varied considerably, from 61 for France to 515 for

 Japan. The samples varied considerably on the de-
 mographic variables of gender, marital status, edu-
 cation level, age, and organizational tenure (a sum-
 mary of sample characteristics is available from the
 senior author). Although we report the simpler sta-
 tistics here, we also ran hypothesis tests with these
 demographic variables as controls, to rule out the
 possibility that our findings could be explained by
 demographic differences between samples.

 Measures and Procedures

 Our questionnaire included the Occupational

 Stress Indicator-2 (OSI2), which contains measures
 of well-being (Cooper & Williams, 1996); the Work
 Locus of Control Scale (WLCS; Spector, 1988); the
 Values Survey Module 1994 (VSM94; Hofstede,
 1994; not used in Australia); and additional demo-
 graphic questions.

 The WLCS is a 16-item scale that assesses em-

 ployee beliefs about their control at work in gen-
 eral. Half the items are written to indicate an exter-
 nal locus of control (for example, "Getting the job
 you want is mostly a matter of luck") and half to
 indicate an internal locus (for example, "Promo-
 tions are given to employees who perform well on
 the job"). For all items, the six response choices
 range from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."
 High scores represent externality and low scores,
 internality. Spector (1988) reported an internal
 consistency (coefficient alpha) of .75 to .85 in six
 U.S. samples. The scale has been shown to relate as
 expected to job satisfaction, control at work, role
 stress, and perceptions of supervisor style, and it
 has been shown to correlate from .49 to .57 with
 Rotter's (1966) general locus of control scale (Spec-
 tor, 1988). It has also been found to be related to
 both job performance (Blau, 1993) and counterpro-
 ductive behavior at work (Fox & Spector, 1999).
 The OSI2 is a 90-item short form of the Occupa-

 tional Stress Indicator (OSI; Cooper, Sloan, & Wil-
 liams, 1988). Most available reliability and validity
 data concern the longer version (e.g., Robertson,
 Cooper, & Williams, 1990). Job satisfaction was as-
 sessed with 12 items concerning a respondent's
 organization and his or her work itself. Items had
 six response choices ranging from "very much dis-
 satisfaction" to "very much satisfaction." A sample
 item is "Communication and the way information
 flows around the organization." Psychological
 well-being was assessed with the 12-item mental
 strain scale that asks about psychological reactions
 at work. All items had six response choices, but the
 choices varied across items. For example, the item
 "Are there times at work when you feel so exasper-
 ated that you sit back and think to yourself that 'life

 is all really just too much effort?"' had choices
 ranging from "never" to "often." Physical well-
 being was assessed with the 6-item physical strain
 scale that asks about somatic symptoms, such as
 shortness of breath and muscle trembling. The six
 response choices ranged from "never" to "very fre-
 quently." For all three scales, high scores repre-
 sented high levels of well-being-that is, high sat-
 isfaction and low psychological and physical
 symptoms. Robertson et al. (1990) reported coeffi-
 cient alpha reliabilities for the original OSI of .85,
 .88, and .78, respectively. Validation evidence for
 the most recent version of the OSI was summarized
 in Williams and Cooper (1998).

 The Values Survey Module assesses five cultural
 values, including individualism/collectivism. It
 contains four items for which respondents indicate
 importance, using five response choices ranging
 from "of very little or no importance" to "of utmost
 importance." The items ask about having sufficient
 time for a personal life, having good working con-
 ditions, having job security, and having an element
 of variety and adventure in one's job. High scores
 represent an individualist orientation, and low
 scores, a collectivist orientation. We computed
 scores by differentially weighting the items and
 adding a constant, resulting in means for countries
 that typically range from about 0 to the low 100s.
 Hofstede (1994) noted that the VSM94 is only ap-
 propriate at the aggregate or country level of anal-
 ysis rather than at the individual level of analysis.
 The CISMS project directors put together the En-
 glish version of the questionnaire. In 8 samples
 (Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Af-
 rica, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
 States) the questionnaire were administered in En-
 glish. In 16 samples, the questionnaires were trans-
 lated into the native language of the area. Each of
 the non-English versions was translated into the
 appropriate language and then independently
 back-translated to assure language equivalence.
 Where translation equivalence was not maintained,
 portions were retranslated and then retested until
 the meanings of the two versions were as close as
 possible.

 provided by van de Vijver and Leung (1997: 60). In
 48 of 114 comparisons, the U.S. alpha was signifi-
 cantly higher than that for the other sample, and 38
 of these differences involved translations of the
 scales. These results should not be surprising, as
 often internal consistency declines with translation
 (e.g., DeFrank, Ivancevich, & Schweiger, 1988;
 Iwata, Roberts, & Kawakami, 1995).

 We also tested for scale transportability by con-

 ducting "pairwise" multisample variance-covari-
 ance equality tests on the items for each individual
 scale using LISREL 8 (J6reskog & S6rbom, 1992).
 This comparison of the equality of interitem covari-
 ances (for each of the four scales separately) across
 samples is the most stringent test of factor equality
 that is frequently used for comparing scales across
 samples (e.g., Riordan & Vandenberg, 1994;
 Schaubroeck & Green, 1989). We limited the anal-
 yses to only those samples that had at least 200
 participants with complete data on each scale,
 since this method is designed for large samples.
 Since the scales were developed in English-speak-
 ing Anglo nations (the United Kingdom and United
 States), we chose our largest sample that fit that
 category-namely, New Zealand-as a standard,
 and we then compared it to the samples for Aus-
 tralia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Poland, Slovenia,
 Taiwan, and Ukraine. Our view was that this wide
 range of samples should provide a clear indication
 of transportability. Table 1 shows that for six fit
 indexes, the three well-being measures met the
 widely accepted .90 or higher standard in 87 per-
 cent of cases across the included countries. Fit was
 almost as good for the WLCS, with a third of the
 statistics .90 or higher, and almost three-fourths at
 .85 or higher, across all the fit indexes combined.
 The only clearly poor fit was for Taiwan. The table
 also shows the chi-square values for each analysis,
 all but four of which were significant. However, it
 is generally recognized that chi-square is overly
 sensitive to sample size, so we placed more empha-
 sis on the fit indexes in interpretation.

 RESULTS

 Measurement Transportability

 Test of Hypothesis 1

 These scales maintained adequate internal con-
 sistency reliabilities as assessed with the widely
 accepted .70 coefficient alpha standard (Nunnally,
 1978) in 91 out of 96 cases (coefficient alphas are
 available from the first author). We compared the
 U.S. alpha (as a standard) with all others, using an
 F-test (1 - smaller alpha/i - larger alpha, with n -
 1 degrees of freedom associated with each alpha)

 Correlations were computed between locus of

 control and the three well-being indicators for each
 of our 24 samples as a test of Hypothesis 1. Table 2
 shows these correlations. In addition, using a z-test
 for independent correlations, we took the correla-
 tion from the U.S. sample as a standard and com-
 pared it with the corresponding correlation for each
 other geopolitical entity to see if there were signif-

 icant differences (see Table 2). Since there were
 large differences in sample sizes, care should be
 taken in interpreting comparative significance lev-
 els. Finally, we ran multiple regression analyses of
 each well-being variable on work locus of control
 and the five demographic variables to see if results
 were affected. In no case was significance lost for
 work locus of control, showing that demographic
 differences among samples hardly account for our
 results.

 The most consistent correlations were between

 the United Kingdom correlation of work locus of
 control with psychological strain was an outlier
 and far lower than would be expected (r = -.06)
 from values for the other five Anglo countries,
 which ranged from -.31 to -.40. When the United
 Kingdom was removed, the resulting correlation of
 -.40 just missed statistical significance (p < .07),
 and was in the expected direction, with the stron-
 ger relations between work locus of control and
 psychological strain being associated with higher
 individualism.

 DISCUSSION

 Is the Relationship between Work Locus of
 Control and Well-Being Universal?

 As noted, we tested Hypothesis 1 by comparing

 locus of control and job satisfaction. All the sam-
 ples had a significant, negative correlation on these
 variables, except France, which had a small sample
 size but a correlation close in magnitude to most
 other samples'. Furthermore, no sample's correla-
 tion was significantly different from that for the
 United States. Relations between locus of control
 and psychological well-being had a little more dis-
 persion. Three samples had nonsignificant correla-
 tions, and four had correlations significantly
 smaller than that for the United States. For physical
 strain, seven correlations were nonsignificant, and
 ten were significantly lower than that for the
 United States.

 Test of Hypothesis 2: Individualism/Collectivism
 as a Moderator of the Locus of Control-
 Well-Being Relationship

 To test Hypothesis 2, stating that individualism/

 collectivism would serve as a moderator, we
 checked to see if the individualism/collectivism
 value found for each sample related to the magni-
 tude of the correlation between work locus of con-
 trol and each well-being measure for that sample.
 We did this by computing the correlations between
 the mean individualism/collectivism scores and
 the corresponding magnitude of correlation be-
 tween work locus of control and each measure of
 well-being. That is, we separately matched each
 sample's mean for individualism/collectivism with
 the correlation values in columns 2, 3, and 4 of
 Table 2. The two statistics are both summaries of
 country samples, one a correlation coefficient and
 the other a mean. Correlating such summary statis-
 tics is a practice often seen in meta-analysis; for
 example, Carsten and Spector (1997) computed
 correlations between correlation coefficients from
 studies and the unemployment rates at the times
 the studies were conducted.

 The correlations were -.07, -.25, and .12, for job
 satisfaction, psychological well-being, and physi-
 cal well-being, respectively, and each was nonsig-
 nificant, thus failing to support the moderator hy-
 pothesis. An inspection of the results showed that

 the correlations of work locus of control and well-
 being for our 24 samples. We examined whether or
 not these correlations were statistically significant
 and whether they differed significantly from the
 U.S. correlations used as the standard. For job sat-
 isfaction, our results support the first hypothesis.
 Correlations ranged from -.50 to -.23, with all but
 the one for France (which had a very small sample)
 being statistically significant. Relations with psy-
 chological well-being were a little less consistent,
 but in most cases were supportive of Hypothesis 1.
 For three samples, correlations were both nonsig-
 nificant and significantly lower than the U.S. one
 (Bulgaria, Romania, and the United Kingdom).
 However, it should be noted that, owing to cultural
 similarities, the United Kingdom would be ex-
 pected not to differ from the United States.

 Relations with physical well-being, however,
 failed to show consistent support for universality.
 Seven samples had nonsignificant values (Belgium,
 the PRC, Estonia, France, Hong Kong, South Africa,
 and the United Kingdom), and ten had values sig-
 nificantly lower than the U.S. value. Although
 France was not significantly lower than the United
 States, its correlation was only -.12 and, as noted,
 its sample was very small. Thus, in half the cases,
 the relatively strong relation seen in the United
 States (-.39) was not replicated. Therefore, we can
 conclude that, unlike job satisfaction, physical
 well-being is not universally associated with be-
 liefs in low control at work.

 Individualism/Collectivism as a Moderator of
 Work Locus of Control and Well-Being

 Our second hypothesis was that individualism/

 collectivism would moderate relations between
 work locus of control and well-being in such a way

 that they would be stronger in individualist na-
 tions. We tested this hypothesis by combining the
 intracultural analysis (Leung & Bond, 1989), in-
 volving computing correlations separately for each
 geopolitical entity sample, with an intercultural
 analysis involving relating the magnitude of those
 correlations with each sample's mean individual-
 ism/collectivism score. We failed to find support
 for this prediction, as individualism/collectivism
 did not significantly moderate relations between
 work locus of control and well-being. Even when
 we removed the United Kingdom from our analysis
 because its results were an outlier among Anglo
 nations, at best we found only marginal signifi-
 cance for one well-being measure. In light of our
 support for Hypothesis 1 with job satisfaction and
 psychological well-being, such a relation would
 seem doubtful, but it is surprising that we didn't
 find it for physical well-being, where relations
 were not universal.

 There are at least three methodological explana-
 tions, which are not necessarily mutually exclu-
 sive, for the failure to support our second hypoth-
 esis. First, at the intercultural level, our number of
 samples (23 for individualism/collectivism) was
 quite small, thus reducing the statistical power to
 detect significant effects at traditional probability
 levels of less than .05. Second, the Hofstede (1994)
 VSM94 four-item individualism/collectivism mea-
 sure is global and unidimensional. It assesses indi-
 vidualism/collectivism on a single continuum, but
 it has been recognized that individualism/collec-
 tivism is complex and multidimensional (Ho &
 Chiu, 1994; Triandis, 1995). It may be only certain
 aspects of individualism/collectivism that moder-
 ate, rather than the global dimension assessed by
 the VSM94. Furthermore, using these same data we
 have found that the internal consistency of the
 VSM94 individualism/collectivism scale is poor in
 many samples (Spector et al., 2001). Perhaps a
 more psychometrically sound scale would have
 yielded better results. However, it should be noted
 that the Hofstede scale has been used extensively,
 and much of the cross-national literature is based
 on its findings. Furthermore, Hofstede (1984) re-
 ported on 16 of our geopolitical entities in his orig-
 inal work on cultural values using an earlier
 version of the Values Survey Module. A rank-order
 correlation comparing our ranks with his was .71,
 showing strong agreement between his order and
 ours (see Spector et al., 2001).

 Third, although we attempted to make our sam-

 more organizations. However, had this been a seri-
 ous issue, we would have expected our first hy-
 pothesis to have been unsupported as well, and we
 likely would not have found such good agreement
 with Hofstede on individualism/collectivism.

 Study Limitations

 Five of our variables were assessed via self-

 reports, but the crucial variable of geopolitical en-
 tity was not. It seems unlikely that monomethod
 bias or method variance accounted for the consis-
 tent relations observed between locus of control
 and other variables. First, the idea that all variables
 in a questionnaire are related to a degree owing to
 the method itself has found very little support
 (Spector, 1987; Spector & Brannick, 1995). In fact,
 an inspection of Table 1 shows that quite a few of
 our correlations were nonsignificant, a finding that
 provides an argument against pervasive method
 variance. It is still possible that certain variables
 shared biases and that these were widespread cross-
 nationally. The best recognized biases are "re-
 sponse sets" and "social desirability." Response
 sets have been noted as varying considerably across
 countries (Triandis, 1994; van de Vijver & Leung,
 1997), even within collectivists, which would de-
 crease the likelihood of similar findings across our
 samples. Social desirability seems a highly un-
 likely explanation since the WLCS is unrelated to it
 (Spector, 1988), and little relation has been found
 between social desirability and job satisfaction
 (Spector, 1987; Spector & Brannick, 1995).

 Conclusions and Management Implications

 We found that the relation of work locus of con-

 trol to job satisfaction was consistent across all 24
 samples in our study, despite a wide range of cul-
 tural differences among them. We found consis-
 tency in almost all samples for the relation between
 work locus of control and psychological well-
 being. However, the U.S. findings of internality
 being associated with reduced physical well-being
 did not hold across our samples. In half of our
 samples, the U.S. correlation was significantly
 higher than the comparison. Thus, we can con-
 clude that the relation of work locus of control may
 be universal in terms of job satisfaction and psy-
 chological well-being, but it does not generalize as
 broadly with physical well-being.

 What is intriguing about the findings regarding

 ples as representative as possible, in a few cases
 data came from just a few organizations. Thus, it is
 possible that results in some samples deviated
 somewhat from what might have been found with

 physical well-being is that they do not follow an
 easily interpretable pattern. The geopolitical enti-
 ties whose samples either differed from the United
 States or failed to be significantly different from

 zero included members of country clusters as di-
 verse as the Anglo cluster (New Zealand, South
 Africa, and the United Kingdom), Western Europe
 (Belgium, France, and Sweden), Eastern Europe
 (Estonia and Slovenia), and Asia (the PRC, Hong
 Kong, Japan, and Taiwan). Only the Asian samples
 were consistent, as there were other Anglo, West-
 ern Europe, and Eastern Europe samples that did
 not differ from the United States. Continued re-
 search is needed to determine why the physical
 well-being results were so unpredictably variable.
 The explanation of such variability does not seem
 to lie with individualism/collectivism, at least in
 the global manner assessed by the Hofstede scale
 employed here. Work-related legislation that favors
 humane working conditions, good diets, availabil-
 ity of health care, and a plethora of economic and
 social factors may account for differences in phys-
 ical well-being across nations. This issue is partic-
 ularly important since it is physical well-being that
 likely relates most closely with physical health and
 illness.

 Although our results hint that stimulating beliefs
 of control among managers is a healthy organiza-
 tional strategy across countries, our data do not
 pinpoint the specific forms of control that may
 have the best adaptive effects in each country. That
 is, despite similarities in relations, it is likely that
 the ways in which people translate their control
 beliefs into action varies across nations. As Trian-
 dis (1994) noted, etic constructs have emic aspects,
 as individual cultures find their own ways of ex-
 pressing them. Thus, the manifestation of control
 can differ across societies, even though individuals
 might score the same. In the United States, a person
 who is internal expects to have personal, direct
 control over a job, but in a collectivist society, a
 person who is internal may expect to have indirect
 control via the cultivation of personal relationships
 with others. Certainly individuals in powerful po-
 sitions in collectivist nations such as Japan believe
 in their ability to exert control, but they likely see
 that control as coming from their networks of rela-
 tionships with others. Their counterparts in the
 United States more likely see themselves as having
 personal power less linked to others. Given a con-
 trol scale, each might tend to interpret the items
 somewhat differently, but in a way consistent with
 his or her own cultural context.

 control beliefs and perceptions are a causal agent in
 producing well-being, the opposite is also possible.
 It may well be that individuals who are well
 adapted to their culture have experienced certain
 successes that enhance beliefs about control. These
 successes contribute to positive attitudes and well-
 being, so that control beliefs are the effect rather
 than the cause. Again, this phenomenon might oc-
 cur universally across cultures, although the pre-
 cise contexts might vary.

 As suggested by the popularity of management
 approaches emphasizing autonomy and empower-
 ment, beliefs of control are a vital element in the
 management of organizations in the West, and our
 results suggest that they can be just as important
 elsewhere. Whereas most prior research on control
 beliefs was limited to reporting mean country dif-
 ferences in general locus of control, our study was
 designed to test theoretical hypotheses concerning
 universality of relations, not just means, specifi-
 cally in the workplace. We have shown that, for job
 satisfaction and psychological well-being, work
 locus of control relations generalize. However, it
 would be premature to assume that Anglo-Euro-
 pean management approaches that promote indi-
 vidual autonomy and empowerment will work uni-
 versally to enhance well-being. Beliefs about
 control and, presumably, perceptions of control at
 work must be culturally appropriate for the context
 in which people live, and exploring such context
 differences should be the next direction for inter-
 national control research.
