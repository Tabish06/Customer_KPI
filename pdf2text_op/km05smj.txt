To help understand how ﬁrms develop and maintain dynamic capabilities, we examine the effects
of the dynamics, management, and governance of R&D and marketing resource deployments
on ﬁrm-level economic performance. In a sample of technology-based entrepreneurial ﬁrms,
we ﬁnd that a history of increased investments in marketing is an enduring source of compet-
itive advantage. We also ﬁnd that managers’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc experience positively moderates the
relationship between R&D deployment intensity and economic returns. In addition, institutional
ownership boosts economic returns from marketing deployments by subjecting these deployments
to increased scrutiny and by sending positive signals to the market about the ﬁrm. Copyright ©

Firms differ signiﬁcantly in their efforts in devel-
oping resources and dynamic capabilities, which
may have effects on ﬁrm-level economic perfor-
mance (Helfat, 1994; Henderson, 1994). Because
resource deployments are converted into rent-
generating dynamic capabilities over time, under-
standing the role of history of investments can
offer fundamental insights for uncovering the rela-
tionship between ﬁrm-level dynamic capabilities
and superior economic performance. Two ﬁrms

ﬁrm’s resources and capabilities and the supe-
rior resource allocation decisions that are unique
to each ﬁrm. Penrose (1995) also emphasizes
that
the neglect of agency problems in mod-
ern corporations can jeopardize the efﬁcient and
innovative processes of resource deployments for
building dynamic capabilities. Thus, this empiri-
cal paper examines the inﬂuence of both manage-
ment and corporate governance factors on resource
deployments in R&D and marketing. Focusing
on entrepreneurial ﬁrms that completed an ini-
tial public offering (IPO),
this paper analyzes
the impact of ﬁrm-speciﬁc managerial knowledge
and institutional investor ownership on the stock
market-based measure of ﬁrm-level economic per-
formance.

This paper offers at least three contributions to
the strategic management ﬁeld. First, by focusing
on the history of dynamics in resource deploy-
ments,
this paper highlights and examines the
role of path dependency in investments leading to
development and maintenance of innovation and
marketing capabilities. Second, this paper reveals
the role of top management experience on effec-
tive deployment of R&D investments. Third, this
paper demonstrates the guardianship roles of insti-
tutional investors for marketing investments that
are potentially more subject to agency problems
than R&D investments.

HISTORY OF RESOURCE
DEPLOYMENTS

Investments in R&D and marketing constitute tan-
gible efforts to build and maintain innovative
and marketing capabilities, and ﬁrms often dif-
fer signiﬁcantly in the intensity of such tangible
efforts (Hill and Snell, 1988; Mosakowski, 1993).
The history of resource deployments can be espe-
cially important if an entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s strate-
gic intent is to develop a distinctive innovative
capability. The development of R&D processes
and organizational routines is evolutionary (Nelson
and Winter, 1982), and substantive early invest-
ments in R&D capability may produce superior
absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990;
Lieberman, 1989). A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity
for assimilating new information and knowledge
is modiﬁed through path-dependent processes of
human and material resource interactions, and the
ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity is limited by the current

knowledge endowment of the ﬁrm (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990; Penrose, 1959). Firms with inter-
rupted past investments may have a smaller and
weaker knowledge endowment and consequently
a more limited learning capacity at a given point
in time. Firms with a history of increased efforts
in developing technological know-how over time
may gain a strategic competitive advantage over
their counterparts that show weak commitment to
intense resource deployments (Kor, 2001).

Similarly, an overall marketing capability in-
volves knowledge of and care for current and
future needs and wants of customers, informative
and differentiating advertising, and commitment to
customer service (Mosakowski, 1993), which typ-
ically requires persistent and timely investments
in marketing. The endowment of investments in
marketing and distribution serves as an isolating
mechanism (Mahoney and Pandian, 1992), affects
a ﬁrm’s likelihood and timing of entry into emerg-
ing markets (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988;
Mitchell, 1989), and makes it more costly and dif-
ﬁcult for outsiders to enter the market (Thomas,
1996). Development of an overall marketing capa-
bility and brand equity may require augmented
investments in marketing for multiple years (Batra
et al., 1995). A ﬁrm’s history of past investments
can have continued economic value for the ﬁrm
in the present and future because these invest-
ments help the ﬁrm learn and absorb new knowl-
edge more efﬁciently. Thus, a history of increased
efforts to build capabilities will have a synergistic
effect (or positive spillover effect) on the current
economic ﬁrm-level performance.

Hypothesis 1a: Firms with a history of increased
resource deployments in R&D will achieve supe-
rior economic ﬁrm-level performance than ﬁrms
that lack such deployments.

Hypothesis 1b: Firms with a history of increased
resource deployments in marketing will achieve
superior economic ﬁrm-level performance than
ﬁrms that lack such deployments.

MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
OF RESOURCE DEPLOYMENTS

To identify the impact of R&D strategies on eco-
nomic performance, it is important to know not
only how much is spent but also how effectively

R&D is deployed (Ettlie, 1998; Schoonhoven,
Eisenhardt, and Lyman 1990). This empirical paper
thus focuses on the inﬂuence of management and
corporate governance on the success of resource
deployments.

Resource-based theory maintains that managers’
ﬁrm-speciﬁc experience involving tacit knowledge
of a ﬁrm’s resources and capabilities allows man-
agers to make more informed resource allocation
decisions that are unique to each ﬁrm. Compared
to managers who are relatively new to the ﬁrm,
managers with ﬁrm-speciﬁc experience are more
likely to envision a superior ‘subjective oppor-
tunity set for the ﬁrm’ (Penrose, 1959) because
these managers have experience-based and often
tacit knowledge of existing ﬁrm-level capabili-
ties and organizational routines. Because man-
agers with ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge can assess
more precisely which opportunities emerging in
the environment ﬁt better dynamically with inter-
nal ﬁrm strengths and weaknesses,
these man-
agers know better which opportunities to pur-
sue.

Intimate knowledge of the ﬁrm and its organi-
zational capabilities can be critical in the effective
allocation of limited ﬁnancial and human resources
of entrepreneurial ﬁrms among competing R&D
projects. A strategic manager with tacit knowl-
edge of employee skills and interests can more
precisely assess the likelihood of success among
multiple avenues of R&D investments and thus
dedicate resources to high-margin R&D projects
in which the ﬁrm is more likely to achieve sus-
tainable competitive advantage. Also, managers’
knowledge of employees enables these managers
to match more effectively employee skills to jobs
and employees to each other in team settings
(Prescott and Visscher, 1980). Superior matching
of employee skills to R&D projects and teams typ-
ically boosts the productivity of R&D investments
in creating dynamic capabilities and sustainable
competitive advantage. Further, managers’ experi-
ence with ﬁrm’s products and technology may be
critical for efﬁcient and effective deployment of
resources to build superior relationships with cus-
tomers and distributors (Kor, 2003). While prior
management experience in the industry may be
helpful, it is not a sufﬁcient substitute for tacit
managerial knowledge of ﬁrm-speciﬁc relation-
ships between the ﬁrm and its buyers. Accordingly,
we posit:

Hypothesis 2a: As the executives’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc
experience increases, ﬁrms will achieve higher
economic returns from R&D investments.

Hypothesis 2b: As the executives’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc
experience increases, ﬁrms will achieve higher
economic returns from marketing investments.

While resource-based theory sheds light on appro-
priate management of a ﬁrm’s resources, agency
theory deals with the proper governance of re-
source decisions. In public corporations, positive
agency theory (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Jensen
and Meckling, 1976) indicates potential conﬂict
of economic interest between owners and man-
agers as their agents. In the absence of a proper
mix of corporate governance mechanisms (Sun-
daramurthy, 1996), economic resources of the ﬁrm
may be deployed inappropriately, and the qual-
ity of resource deployment decisions may suffer.
Resource-based theory has neglected the potential
presence of the agency problem (Penrose, 1995),
which may impede sufﬁcient consideration of an
efﬁcient deployment of resources and capabilities
(Kor and Mahoney, 2000).

In the empirical context of this paper (i.e., in the
context of technology ﬁrms that have completed an
initial public offering), ownership by institutional
investors constitutes one of the more visible forms
of corporate governance. The ownership structure
of entrepreneurial IPO ﬁrms receives close atten-
tion from the business press and the stock market,
and the presence of institutional owners is inter-
preted as a market signal of the credibility of
new business ventures. Unlike other forms of gov-
ernance where it is more difﬁcult to assess the
governance effectiveness (e.g., the independence
and objectivity of boards), both product and capital
markets can readily observe institutional investor
ownership.

Institutional investors can provide effective mon-
itoring and governance because their block own-
ership and large voting power make it easier
and more economically rewarding to inﬂuence a
ﬁrm’s strategic decisions (Sundaramurthy, 1996).
Institutional owners’ overall positive effect on a
ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance (McConnell and Ser-
vaes, 1990) may partly be driven by adoption of
proper resource deployment strategies, particularly
in the business context of high-technology en-
trepreneurial ﬁrms. Unlike managers, institutional
investors may not become involved in speciﬁc

R&D decisions such as allocation of funds among
competing projects. However, institutional inves-
tors may have an indirect positive inﬂuence on
the economic returns from R&D because man-
agers arguably act more in the economic interest
of shareholders in R&D-related decisions when
these managers are under the surveillance of insti-
tutional guardians. This agency theory argument
is consistent with empirical evidence that institu-
tional investor ownership is positively related to
R&D spending (David, Hitt, and Gimeno, 2001;
Hoskisson et al., 2002). However, these empiri-
cal studies indicate direct effects of institutional
investors on returns to R&D intensity, whereas
we focus on the moderating effects of institutional
ownership on the returns to resource deployments.
The presence of institutional investors may be
particularly important for the deployment of re-
sources towards building a rent-generating mar-
keting capability. When monitored by institutional
investors, managers may be less likely to use mar-
keting investments to pursue nonproﬁt-maximizing
goals such as aggressive sales growth at
the
expense of future proﬁtability. Also, institutional
investors may contribute to the success of mar-
keting deployments by improving the legitimacy
of the entrepreneurial ﬁrm in the eyes of institu-
tional customers and distributors. Because ﬁnan-
cial backing of institutional investors is a posi-
tive indicator of credibility, stability, and higher
survival rates for entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Brav and
Gompers, 1997; Megginson and Weiss, 1991), cus-
tomers may be more comfortable in purchasing
new, high-technology products from ﬁrms with
such ﬁnancial backing. Thus, institutional investor
ownership ampliﬁes the positive economic returns
from both R&D and marketing deployments.

Hypothesis 3a: As the institutional investor own-
ership increases, ﬁrms will achieve higher
economic returns from R&D investments.

Hypothesis 3b: As the institutional investor own-
ership increases, ﬁrms will achieve higher eco-
nomic returns from marketing investments.

METHODS AND RESULTS

Sample and variables
The empirical data set for this research paper
consists of 60 technology-based entrepreneurial

ﬁrms that completed an initial public offering in
the medical, surgical, and dental instruments indus-
try (SIC = 384) between 1990 and 1995. We col-
lected data on these ﬁrms until 1999. We gath-
ered data on investments, management, and gov-
ernance from prospectus and proxy statements, and
we compiled stock market-based performance data
from Compustat ﬁles.

For the dependent variable, we use a proxy for
Tobin’s q as a stock market-based measure of
ﬁrm-level economic performance. As a dynamic,
forward-looking measure of ﬁrm-level economic
performance, Tobin’s q reﬂects the stock market’s
expectations about
the future growth and prof-
itability potential of the company (Montgomery
and Wernerfelt, 1988). A stock market-based mea-
sure is appropriate in assessing the moderating
role of corporate governance on economic returns
to resource deployments, where the focus is eco-
nomic value creation for shareholders. Tobin’s q is
deﬁned as the ratio of market value of the ﬁrm to
the replacement cost of its assets, where the extent
to which q is greater than one indicates how much
economic value a ﬁrm creates for shareholders
(Montgomery and Wernerfelt, 1988). As a proxy
for Tobin’s q, we use the ratio of sum of (1) market
value of equity and (2) book value of total debt to
the book value of total assets. There are more com-
plex measures of Tobin’s q that try to capture the
replacement value of ﬁrm’s assets; however, these
approaches may induce sample selection bias as a
result of data unavailability (DaDalt, Donaldson,
and Garner, 2003).

Percentage increase in R&D (or marketing) dep-
loyments captures the magnitude of changes in a
ﬁrm’s resource deployments over multiple years.
After conducting an in-depth examination of all
prospectuses about the discovery process and tim-
ing of new product development, it became clear
that, in this industry, R&D investments convert
into revenue-generating products typically within
a period of 3 years. We also project that marketing
investments to build a strong brand name and close
relationships with customers and distributors have
economic performance effects longer than 1 year
(Batra et al., 1995). Accordingly, to capture the
historical dynamics in investment levels, we cal-
culate the average percentage increase in R&D
(and marketing) investments during the previous
3 years. This continuous measure captures relative
magnitude of the changes in the level of dollar
investments in R&D and marketing over 3 years.

Top management ﬁrm-speciﬁc experience is
measured as average ﬁrm tenure (i.e., the num-
ber of years that managers spent in a particular
ﬁrm) of the top managers. Institutional investor
ownership is calculated as the total percentage of
ownership by institutional investors (e.g., pension
funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, invest-
ment ﬁrms, venture capital ﬁrms) (Mahoney, Sun-
daramurthy, and Mahoney, 1997).

Based on prior empirical research in the cor-
porate governance and resource deployments lit-
erature (e.g., Mahoney et al., 1997; Mosakowski,
1993), we controlled for ﬁrm size (total assets),
ﬁrm age (years since incorporation), separation of
CEO and chairperson positions, the ratio of out-
sider directors on the board, and the stock own-
ership percentage of top managers. The ratio of
outsider directors is calculated as the proportion
of outside directors appointed before the current
CEO took ofﬁce. The management stock owner-
ship variable is calculated as the total percentage
of common stock owned by the top executives
(Mahoney et al., 1997).

Resource deployment intensity, which we use
both to calculate the interaction variables and as

control variables, is measured separately for R&D
and marketing deployments. Investment intensity
variables can be calculated as the level of invest-
ments divided by the ﬁrm’s sales, assets, or number
of employees (Ettlie, 1998). We standardize invest-
ments by total assets because some ﬁrms do not
have sales in the early years of product develop-
ment. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics, and
Table 2 presents the results of

analysis.

Analysis and results

The hypotheses presented in this research paper are
tested using repeated observations on the same set
of cross-sectional units. A random effects model
is used to analyze the panel data because the
alternative dummy approach is costly in degrees
of freedom lost. In our sample, Hausman’s test
for orthogonality of the random effects (Greene,
2000) indicates that estimation results of dummy
and random effects are consistent, and individual
effects are uncorrelated with the other variables in
the model.

As shown in Model 1 of Table 2, the variable
of percentage increase in marketing deployments
is statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.10);
therefore,
Hypothesis 1b is supported. Models 2–4 present
the analysis of moderating effects, where cen-
tered values of continuous independent variables
are used because of the presence of multiplica-
tive interaction terms. In support of Hypothesis 2a,
ﬁrm-speciﬁc experience of top managers has a pos-
itive moderating effect on economic returns from
R&D (Model 2). Further, in support of Hypothe-
sis 3b, Model 3 indicates that the percentage of
institutional ownership positively moderates the
relationship between marketing deployment inten-
sity and ﬁrm-level economic performance. These
two moderating effects are also statistically signif-
icant when all interaction variables are included in
Model 4.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We argued that both the historical dynamics and
the management and governance of
resource
deployments inﬂuence the economic performance
consequences of ﬁrms’ technology and marketing-
related investments. We ﬁnd that, after controlling

intensities, a history of
for yearly investment
increased marketing investments over a 3-year
period results in an additive, synergistic effect
on current ﬁrm-level economic performance. The
stock market projects that past efforts in devel-
opment and maintenance of relationships with the
buyers contribute signiﬁcantly to the strength of
the current marketing capabilities in generating
superior stockholder returns. Thus, with regard to
marketing deployments in the medical and sur-
gical instruments industry, a history of increased
efforts for developing and maintaining marketing
capabilities is an enduring source of competitive
advantage.

Empirical evidence also shows that, regardless
of the recent past resource deployment dynamics of
the ﬁrm, competitive advantage from R&D invest-
ments erodes quickly. Empirical results almost cer-
tainly have face validity in the light of the history
of global competition, where among the leading
U.S., European, and Asian companies only those
ﬁrms with intense R&D investments were able to
attain sustainable competitive positions (Franko,
1989). Essentially,
if existing R&D capabilities
are not renewed, in a high-velocity business world
of time-based competition where players are in a

highly competitive race to deliver superior value
to customers, economic rents from prior ﬁrm-level
capabilities dissipate rapidly.

In addition, the positive moderating effect of
management experience on R&D deployments
suggests that R&D investments are better man-
aged when strategic managers possess ﬁrm-speciﬁc
knowledge of resources and dynamic capabilities.
The stock market reaction suggests a commonly
held view that a manager with tacit knowledge of
employee skills and interests can more accurately
dedicate funds to high-margin R&D projects and
also can do a superior job of matching of employee
skills to R&D projects, resulting in superior eco-
nomic performance. This empirical ﬁnding cor-
roborates the resource-based view that managers
play a crucial catalyst role in the conversion of
resources into rent-generating dynamic capabilities
(Mahoney, 1995; Penrose, 1959).

Furthermore, our research ﬁndings corroborate
the view that institutional investors play a guardian
role for the IPO ﬁrms’ marketing investments that
are more subject to agency problems than R&D
investments. Under low levels of institutional own-
ership, marketing deployments can potentially be
used for nonproﬁt-maximizing goals such as boost-
ing market share in the short term through aggres-
sive promotions to distributors. In the case of IPO
ﬁrms, institutional ownership sends a positive mar-
ket signal to both potential and existing clients of
the ﬁrm about the credibility of the ﬁrm and the
quality of the ﬁrm’s products and services. These
positive market signals can be critical to the eco-
nomic success of entrepreneurial ﬁrms due to the
high level of uncertainty about future economic
performance of new ventures and new products.

In conclusion, we have shown that a history of
increased efforts and dynamics, and effective man-
agement and governance of resource deployments,
increase economic returns. Future research that
examines the generalizability of these empirical
ﬁndings and uncovers industry-speciﬁc relation-
ships between resource deployments and ﬁrm-level
economic performance looks quite promising.
