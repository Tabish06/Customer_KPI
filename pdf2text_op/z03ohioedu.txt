ABSTRACT 

 

Employees’ psychological contracts are receiving increased attention in the 

 
organizational literature, although our understanding of the relationship between 
perceived breaches of the contract and feelings of anger and other negative emotions 
associated with psychological contract violation remains limited.  The present study 
sought to explain the development of feelings of psychological contract violation through 
the attributions employees make for the breaches they perceive.  The entailment model, 
borrowed from the marital satisfaction literature, was used as the framework for 
understanding the impact of causal, responsibility and blame attributions on 
psychological contract violation.  A secondary goal of this study was to explore the 
relationship between psychological contract violation, organizational cynicism, 
organizational citizenship behaviors and workplace deviance behaviors, to determine 
whether it makes sense to consider psychological contract violation, not psychological 
contract breach, as the more proximal influence on those attitudinal and behavioral 
outcomes.

attributions were able to explain additional variance beyond that accounted for by causal 
attributions.  In contrast to a full entailment view of attributions, blame attributions were

not able to account for additional variance in psychological contract violation beyond that 
accounted for by causal and responsibility attributions.  Another test of the full entailment 
model, using structural equation modeling, indicated that the model had mediocre fit.  
Despite this mediocre fit, the paths from causal to responsibility attributions, 
responsibility to blame attributions and blame attributions to contract violation were all 
large, indicating support for the entailment model.   
 
In the secondary analyses involving psychological contract violation, the results 
indicated that psychological contract violation added to the prediction of organizational 
citizenship behaviors, workplace deviance behaviors and organizational cynicism, 
beyond the predictive power of psychological contract breach.  Therefore, the majority of 
prior studies that have looked only at the relationship between psychological contract 
breach and organizational outcomes have ignored an important relationship between 
psychological contract violation and these same outcomes.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

 

 
When individuals accept job offers to work within particular organizations, they 
are often promised certain things by the organization in exchange for their work within 
that organization.  These promises may be made prior to the employee’s entry into the 
organization or at any time after they are hired.  The content of these promises varies, and 
the promises may be either made explicitly through written or oral assurances by 
members of the organization, or may be implied by training manuals, human resources 
policy guides or other organizational literature.  As with any contract, there is potential 
for either party to fail to live up to their end of the bargain.  For the present study, I am 
concerned with the emotional and behavioral effects that result from the employee’s 
perception that one or more promises have been broken by the organization.  This 
perception that the organization has broken one or more promises is known as 
psychological contract breach. 

Estimates of the number of psychological contract breaches occurring in 

organizations range from 25 percent (Turnley & Feldman, 1998) to over 90 percent 
(Robinson & Wolfe Morrison, 2000).  The majority of studies report that over half of 
employees perceive that important explicit or implied promises made to them by their 
organizations have gone unfulfilled.  With the current state of the economy, including the 

1 


increased prevalence of layoffs at large organizations like IBM, Quest, AOL Time 
Warner, and Worldcom, it seems likely that the prevalence of breaches will increase in 
the near future.  Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of the 
consequences of these breaches.  Current research supports a link between breaches and 
important work behaviors and attitudes, however, very little research exists that would 
help to explain the process through which breaches come to affect relevant organizational 
outcomes.  Only by understanding this process can we provide organizational leaders 
with the information needed to minimize the negative impact of psychological contract 
breaches.   

The present study seeks to explain the development of feelings of contract 

violation (e.g., anger, frustration, betrayal) through the attributions employees make for 
the breaches they perceive.  In other words, the kinds of reasons employees come up with 
to explain perceived contract breaches are thought to be responsible for the degree of 
negative impact these breaches have on the emotions employees feel.  As Lester, Turnley, 
Bloodgood, and Bolino (2002) note, “although prior research has discussed attributions 
for psychological contract breach in theoretical terms, empirical research in this area is 
lacking” (p. 43).  The entailment model, borrowed from the marital satisfaction literature 
(Fincham & Bradbury, 1987a), will be used as the framework for understanding the 
impact of causal, responsibility and blame attributions on the negative emotions 
associated with contract violation (see Figure 1).  An additional goal of this study is to 
explore the relationship between contract violation and organizational cynicism, 
organizational citizenship behaviors and workplace deviance behaviors (see Figure 2).  
An understanding of the process by which psychological contract breaches turn into 

2 


feelings of violation would become even more important to the extent that the negative 
emotions associated with violation are found to be related to important individual and 
organizational outcomes.      

I will begin with a definition of the psychological contract, including its 

relationship to similar constructs like unmet expectations.  Then I will summarize the 
existing research regarding psychological contracts.  I will then move into a discussion of 
attributions and how they have been applied in the organizational literature.  Following 
this discussion, I will integrate the attribution and psychological contract literatures and 
identify articles that have measured both sets of variables.  Next I will identify the 
importance of research on emotions and how this research ties into work on both 
attributions and psychological contracts.  I will then describe three key outcome 
variables: organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), workplace deviance behaviors 
and organizational cynicism.  Finally, I will integrate much of the information from each 
of the aforementioned sections and will conclude with the identification and explanation 
of the specific hypotheses of the current research.   

Psychological Contracts Defined 

Psychological contracts have been referred to as “individual beliefs, shaped by the 

organization, regarding terms of an exchange agreement between individuals and their 
organization” (Rousseau, 1995, p. 9).  They have also been referred to as relatively stable 
mental models that employees hold regarding promises the organization has made to 
them in exchange for their efforts on behalf of the organization (Rousseau, 1995).  
Psychological contracts involve interpretation on the part of the employee (and the 
employer), as many of the terms incorporated into the psychological contract are not 

3 


written down anywhere for either the organization or its employees to refer to.  Even 
when some terms of the contract are written down, the meaning of these terms can vary 
according to each specific employee’s interpretation, hence making the contracts 
inherently psychological or perceptual.   

Psychological contracts are different from traditional legal contracts that require 
an offer, acceptance of the terms of the offer, and some consideration or payment in order 
for the contract to be legally binding.  Psychological contracts can also be distinguished 
from normative, social, and implied contracts (Rousseau, 1995).  Normative contracts 
involve a shared psychological contract across a group of organizational members.  
Normative contracts exist when several employees perceive the same element or 
elements to be part of their individual psychological contracts.  For instance, if all 
employees in a particular department feel that it is appropriate to use their sick leave even 
when they are healthy, then sick leave becomes equivalent to vacation, and its use in this 
manner becomes part of their normative contract (and thus part of each specific 
employee’s individual psychological contract).  Social contracts are broader than 
normative contracts, and represent beliefs regarding appropriate behavior in a society.  
They are not based on promises, but the values associated with social contracts influence 
the nature of the other types of contracts formed within a particular society.  Finally, 
implied contracts represent the interpretations that people outside the organization make 
regarding terms of an employee’s psychological contract (Rousseau, 1995).   
Elements of the Psychological Contract 

Although psychological contracts are best conceptualized at the individual level, 
some researchers have looked for patterns or themes in the types of contracts that may 

4 


exist.  In order to simplify the nature of psychological contracts and to define overarching 
patterns, Rousseau (1990; 1995) has described transactional and relational contracts as 
two ends of the contract continuum.  Transactional contracts typically focus on short-
term monetary exchanges between employees and employers.  Employees with 
transactional contracts typically have limited personal involvement in the job and plan to 
work for the organization no more than a couple of years.  These employees will use their 
existing skills, and will not be encouraged to develop new ones.  The terms of a 
transactional contract are readily observable and understood by people outside the 
organization, and are expected to remain constant over time (Rousseau, 1995).     
Relational contracts entail mutual interdependence and a greater amount of emotional 
involvement.  Employees within a relational contract will develop company-specific 
skills and will look forward to long-term employment in the organization.  Relational 
contracts involve both written and unwritten characteristics that are subject to change and 
readjustment throughout the life of the contract.       

 To the extent that a large group of employees can be described as having either a 

transactional or relational psychological contract with their organization, the contract 
becomes normative.  Thus, while individual psychological contracts are important in their 
own right, it would also be possible to explore the group level aggregate form of the 
contract (i.e., its transactional or relational nature).  This is similar to research on 
psychological climate or collective climates in which the individual employee’s 
perception of the climate is important and commonalities across perceptions of groups 
(e.g., departments, teams) of employees are also thought to relate to important 
organizational outcomes (cf. Jones & James, 1979).   

5 


I will now use an example from my own organizational experience to illustrate 

 
the formation of the psychological contract.  When I was first brought into the 
organization, I was not sure what to expect.  I looked at the human resources intranet site 
to obtain information regarding corporate policies.  I then compared these policies to the 
way things were being done in our department.  Through my daily interactions with my 
project team members, my performance coach, and my other co-workers, I formed 
opinions of my psychological contract.  I started to determine, based on promotion 
patterns around me, that working hard and being successful on projects that were of high 
importance and visibility would lead to more rapid advancement.  I also learned that 
advancement was based on leading these projects, not just being a team member.  In 
talking with the head of our department, I got the impression that dissertation research 
was highly valued and would receive a great deal of support, including basically free 
reign to collect data.  When I spoke with one of my coworkers, I found out that he had 
already had a positive experience conducting research within this organization.  Thus, it 
seemed that if I worked hard and was successful on projects with high visibility that often 
required additional travel time and longer hours, the organization would provide me with 
rapid advancement and the opportunity to collect dissertation data.   
 
To continue my example, if I was provided with the ability to collect dissertation 
data, I would perceive this aspect of my psychological contract to be fulfilled.  If, on the 
other hand, I were to see several individuals being promoted without meeting the criteria 
outlined above, and I was not promoted, I would perceive a breach in this area of my 
psychological contract.  The effect that this breach would have on my emotions and 
behaviors would probably depend in part on why I thought the breach occurred (i.e., the 

6 


attributions I made), how important this aspect of my employment relationship was to 
me, and how many other aspects of my psychological contract were fulfilled or breached. 
 
The above example indicates the individual nature of psychological contracts.  
Other individuals within the same organization would probably not have “dissertation 
research” as an element of their psychological contracts.  Perhaps some individuals 
would focus on their perceptions of what the organization is promising in terms of work-
family balance, the opportunity to learn new skills, or any number of additional aspects. 
The Changing Nature of Psychological Contracts 

Recent research indicates that today’s business environment has caused the old 
relational psychological contracts emphasizing reciprocity, equity, loyalty, attachment 
and long-term commitment to change (Sparrow, 2000).  This is due, in part, to the 
increased speed of technological change, the use of contingent workers as a larger portion 
of the workforce, higher levels of global competition, the recent downturn in the 
economy and its associated mass layoffs.  The new psychological contract emphasizes 
personal responsibility for career development, commitment to a particular type of work 
rather than a specific organization, and expectations of job insecurity (Cavanaugh & Noe, 
1999).   

Many workers grew up knowing nothing other than the traditional, more 

paternalistic, relational contract, in which they expected the organization to take care of 
them for their entire careers as long as they came to work each day and did their job.  For 
these workers, the transition from an exchange of loyalty, compliance and expertise for 
security, regular promotions and salary increases can be very difficult.  “Many middle 

7 


managers and professionals are feeling angry and deceived” (Herriot & Pemberton, 1996, 
p. 335) as the transition shakes the foundation of their relationship with the organization.   
The Distinction Between Psychological Contract Breach and Violation 

Although information about the formation and nature of psychological contracts is 

important, the present study is more concerned with what happens when specific 
employees feel that elements of their contracts have gone unfulfilled.  Two terms, breach 
and violation, have been used to describe this lack of fulfillment of aspects of the 
psychological contract.  Much like in the early research on management and leadership, 
in which the terms “manager” and “leader” were used interchangeably, the terms breach 
and violation have been used interchangeably in the majority of the existing 
psychological contracts literature.  More recently, important distinctions have been made 
between these two constructs.  Contract “breach” can be thought of as the belief that an 
employee has not received all that they were promised or as a cognitive perception that 
the organization has failed to fulfill one or more elements of the psychological contract.  
The emotions that can, in certain circumstances, flow from a perceived breach, represent 
what Morrison and Robinson (1997) label violation.  These emotions can include 
disappointment, frustration, betrayal, anger, resentment, bitterness, indignation and 
outrage. 

In order to reduce confusion during this literature review, the more recent 

distinction between breach and violation will be utilized when describing the results of 
past studies.  If the authors were studying contract breach but labeled it violation, I will 
refer to it as breach.  Thus the important conceptual distinction identified by Robinson 

8 


and Morrison (1997) will be maintained and the two terms, breach and violation, will be 
used appropriately, not interchangeably.  
The Difference Between Psychological Contracts and Expectations 
The discrepancy between what a person experiences on the job, and what they 
 
expected to experience before joining the organization, has been referred to as unmet 
expectations (Porter & Steers, 1973).  Unmet expectations have received attention in 
several areas of organizational behavior, including recruitment source research (Wanous 
& Colella, 1989; Zottoli & Wanous, 2000), realistic job previews (Wanous, Poland, 
Premack, & Davis, 1992), organizational socialization (Feldman, 1976), and person-
organization fit (Saks & Ashforth, 1997).  Unmet expectations are important to a variety 
of organizational constructs, and have been found to correlate negatively with job 
satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intention to remain with the organization 
(Wanous et al., 1992). 

Although expectations are an important phenomenon in organizational behavior, 

they are distinguishable from psychological contracts.  Psychological contracts are 
believed to represent a deeper construct that goes beyond what a new employee expects 
as they enter an organization.  Although the expectations employees have before entering 
the organization may influence their perceptions of the contract that exists between 
themselves and the organization, this does not mean that the psychological contract is 
equivalent to expectations.  The psychological contract will represent the employee’s 
interpretation of the information conveyed to them during recruitment and selection, and 
their initial socialization period.  Characteristics of the organization (e.g., personnel 
manuals, HR intranet websites, newsletters) can influence an employee’s perception of 

9 


what the organization is promising them.  These promises may or may not represent what 
the individual employee expected before joining the organization.      

Two studies have specifically addressed the added contribution of psychological 

contracts to the more familiar, and more widely researched, construct of met 
expectations.  In one such article, Robinson (1996) found that the relationship between 
psychological contract breach and the civic virtue form of organizational citizenship 
behaviors (a form of citizenship behavior indicating employee involvement in, and 
concern about, the life of the organization) was not at all mediated by unmet 
expectations.  The relationship between psychological contract breach and intent to 
remain with the organization was only partially mediated by unmet expectations.  Finally, 
the relationship between contract breach and performance was fully mediated by unmet 
expectations.  In light of these results, Robinson noted that unmet expectations alone 
were not sufficient to account for the effects of psychological contract breach.  Thus, 
while related, these constructs “are in fact distinct” (p. 14).  In the second study, Turnley 
and Feldman (2000) found that unmet expectations did not mediate the relationship 
between contract breaches and in-role job performance.  In addition, unmet expectations 
only partially mediated the relationship between contract breaches and both intent to quit 
and organizational citizenship behaviors.  The authors noted that their results are 
encouraging for individuals interested in pursuing research on psychological contracts, as 
the results indicate that psychological contract breaches have a significant impact on 
employee behaviors above and beyond the effects of unmet expectations and job 
dissatisfaction.  Based on these two studies, and the theoretical arguments of Rousseau 

10 


(1995) and Rousseau and Tijoriwala (1998), psychological contracts, while related to 
expectations, are indeed separate constructs that merit additional research.  

Empirical Research on Psychological Contracts 

In one of the earliest empirical articles to address the issue of psychological 

Much of the early research on psychological contracts consisted of attempts to 
ascertain the specific underlying dimensions of employees’ psychological contracts, 
attempts to understand the prevalence of contract breaches across these dimensions, or 
explorations of the relationship between breaches of the psychological contract and 
employee behaviors and attitudes. 
Dimensions of the Psychological Contract 
 
contracts, Rousseau (1990) attempted to gain an understanding of the various dimensions 
(or facets) of the psychological contract that employees view as important.  She measured 
advancement, high pay, performance-based pay, training, job security, development and 
support.  As she was also concerned with the employee’s role in the psychological 
contract, Rousseau measured employee obligations, including overtime, loyalty, extra-
role behaviors, notice before leaving, transfers within the company, and minimum stays.  
The remaining studies described below have focused almost entirely on the employee’s 
perspective regarding breaches of employer obligations.  

Robinson and Rousseau (1994) conducted qualitative analyses that provided 

information regarding the makeup of the psychological contract.  They found that 
breaches occurred in just about every area of human resource management, with 
training/development, compensation and promotion being the most frequently reported 
breaches.  Additional breaches mentioned by at least 25 percent of respondents included

Robinson (1996) measured similar categories to Rousseau (1990), including 

the nature of the job, job security, feedback, management of change, responsibility, and 
people.   
 
promotion/advancement, high pay, pay based on current level of performance, training, 
long-term job security, career development, and sufficient power and responsibility. 
 
Turnley and Feldman (1999a) reported that contract breaches involving job 
security, compensation and opportunities for advancement were most prevalent.  Other 
breached elements of the psychological contract included pay raises, bonuses, salary, 
retirement benefits, healthcare benefits, overall benefits, decision-making input, training, 
responsibility, organizational support, supervisory support, job challenge, career 
development, and feedback.  These breach types both share similarities with, and expand 
upon, the types included by Robinson and Rousseau (1994).  In a later study, Turnley and 
Feldman (2000) used the same contract elements as Turnley and Feldman (1999a). 
 
psychological contract.  The first factor, autonomy and control, included the freedom to 
be creative, autonomy and control, participation in decision making, increasing 
responsibilities, opportunities to develop new skills, enough resources to do the job and 
adequate equipment to perform the job.  The second factor, organizational rewards, was 
composed of a flexible work schedule, job security, a competitive salary, and a safe work 
environment.  Factor three, organizational benefits, included health care, retirement and 
vacation benefits, along with tuition reimbursement.  Factor four, growth and 
development, contained continual professional training, opportunities for personal 
growth, career guidance and mentoring and job training. 

Kickul and Lester (2001) found support for a four-factor model of the

Kickul, Neuman, Parker, and Finkl (2002) expanded upon the list of employer 

promises and perceived breaches created by Kickul and Lester (2001).  They added 
opportunities for promotion and advancement, well-defined job responsibilities, pay and 
bonuses tied to performance, recognition of accomplishments, a reasonable workload, 
meaningful work, and challenging and interesting work.    

Based on the studies outlined above, we are left with the understanding that 

basically any characteristic of the organization or aspect of the work environment can 
become part of a particular employee’s psychological contract.  The most frequently 
studied aspects are summarized in Table 1.  As indicated in the table, breaches regarding 
pay, advancement opportunities, training/development, job security, amount of 
responsibility and organizational support have been analyzed most frequently.   
Prevalence of Contract Breach 

Several articles have reported information regarding the prevalence of 

psychological contract breach.  Robinson and Rousseau (1994) found that approximately 
55 percent of their sample of 128 recent MBA graduates had experienced some form of 
psychological contract breach.  In contrast, Turnley and Feldman (1998) reported only a 
25 percent incidence of contract breach.  Turnley and Feldman (2000) reported varying 
degrees of contract breach across their four samples, with an average of 52 percent of 
employees reporting some degree of breach.  In addition, 81 percent of employees 
reported that at least one of the specific employment aspects (e.g., pay, recognition) was 
breached.  Robinson and Morrison (2000) found that 94 percent of respondents 
experienced some degree of contract breach.  Cassar (2001) reported breach frequency 
ranging from 30 percent for rapid advancement to 89 percent for long-term job security.  

13 


Lester et al. (2002) reported that 65 percent of employees believed that at least one 
element of their psychological contract was breached.  Supervisors of these employees 
perceived that the employees’ contracts were breached less frequently (41 percent) than 
reported by the employees themselves.  Conway and Briner (2002a) reported that 69 
percent of employees reported at least one broken promise over a ten day period.  Finally, 
in the most recent of the studies, Turnley, Bolino, Lester and Bloodgood (2003) found 
that 49 percent of the employees in their sample reported receiving less than they were 
promised on either the pay or supportive employment relationship dimensions of their 
psychological contracts.  

As indicated in Table 2, the overall prevalence of psychological contract breach 

across these studies ranges from a low of 25 percent to a high of 94 percent, with the 
majority of studies reporting frequencies of breach in excess of 50 percent, and an 
average breach percentage across studies of 66 percent.  As several of these studies were 
conducted during positive economic times, the prevalence of these breaches is likely to 
be even higher in today’s weakened U.S. economy.     
Methods of Measuring Psychological Contracts and Contract Breach 

Several different methods of operationalizing psychological contract breach have 

been employed.  These methods range from a global indication of breach to scales that 
tap into several specific elements of the employee’s psychological contract.  One of the 
first methods of measuring contract breach consisted of asking employees to respond to a 
single item indicating how well their contracts had been fulfilled.  The scale for this item 
ranged from very poorly fulfilled to very well fulfilled (Robinson & Rousseau, 1994).  A 
related method of assessing global perceptions of contract breach, through responses to a 

14 


five-item scale, has been employed by Robinson and Morrison (2000).  In longitudinal 
studies (e.g., Robinson, 1996), the most common measure of psychological contract 
breach has been formed by subtracting employees’ perceptions of the employer’s 
obligations upon initial hiring from fulfillment of those obligations after some time 
interval (typically 18-24 months) has passed.   

Turnley and Feldman (2000) used a dimensional measure of the psychological 
contract instead of a global measure.  Their measure of contract breach incorporates 
multiple items addressing 16 different aspects of the employment relationship.  In 
addition, the measure allows respondents to indicate whether each aspect of their contract 
was unfulfilled, fulfilled, or over-fulfilled.  Turnley and Feldman (1999a) used a similar 
dimensional measure of contract breach.  However, they calculated perceptions of breach 
by multiplying the importance of each element of the psychological contract (obtained 
from employee ratings) by the degree to which that element was unfulfilled.   

The Turnley and Feldman (1999a, 2000) measures assume that each element 

listed is part of every employee’s psychological contract with the organization.  To get 
around this issue, Kickul and Lester (2001) and Kickul et al. (2002) provided an even 
more comprehensive list of aspects of the employment relationship and asked employees 
to indicate which aspects the organization had promised them.  Then employees were 
asked to indicate the extent to which each promised aspect had been fulfilled by their 
employer.  Aspects that had not been promised, and thus were not elements of a 
particular employee’s psychological contract, were not rated.  In Conway and Briner’s 
(2002a) daily diary study of psychological contract breach, the authors provided

Many of the early psychological contract studies utilized samples of current or 

participants with an open-ended response format and asked them to describe every 
promise the organization had broken on that day. 
Types of Samples Used 
 
recently graduated MBA students, whereas some more recent studies have explored 
different populations.  Robinson and Rousseau (1994) followed up on the same MBA 
alumni sample used by Rousseau (1990), and included 128 respondents in their analyses.  
Robinson (1996) surveyed 125 MBA alumni on three different occasions over a 30 
month period, and Robinson and Morrison (2000) obtained a sample of 147 recently 
graduated MBA alumni.  Kickul and Lester’s (2001) study included 183 employees who 
were enrolled in a part-time MBA program and Kickul et al. (2002) included 165 
employees enrolled in the same program.  Turnley and Feldman (1998) obtained a sample 
of 541 managers and executive level employees, including 213 recent MBA graduates, 
223 managers and executives from a Fortune 500 bank, and 105 employees from a state 
agency.  Turnley and Feldman (1999a) added 263 expatriates and managers in 
international business to the same sample used by Turnley and Feldman (1998), bringing 
the total sample size to 804.  This same 804 employee sample was utilized by Turnley 
and Feldman (2000).  Lester et al. (2002) obtained a sample of 134 supervisor-
subordinate dyads.  Sixty-four of these individuals were employees enrolled in an 
evening MBA program and 66 were employees from the telecommunications center of a 
national healthcare company.  Conway and Briner’s (2002a) sample included 21 
employees from a major banking retail institution in the United Kingdom and 24 part-
time students in an Organizational Behavior Masters program.          

16 


Taking all of the studies summarized above as a whole, the majority of the 
research has been conducted using small samples of recently graduated MBAs with 
relatively little work experience.  There were, however, cases where longer tenured 
employees from specific companies were the focus of the research.  Unfortunately, 
several of the samples used in these published studies are not independent from one 
another.  Both Robinson and Rousseau (1994) and Rousseau (1994) used the same 
sample of MBA graduates and three different Turnley and Feldman (1998, 1999a, 2000) 
articles used samples with at least partial overlap.  Therefore, additional research on 
larger samples within specific organizations, and across a variety of organizations, is 
necessary. 
The Relationship Between Contract Breach and Employee Attitudes and Behaviors 

In order to justify the addition of the psychological contract construct into the 

organizational vernacular, much of the research has focused on the relationship between 
psychological contract breaches and important employee attitudes and behaviors.  
Robinson and Rousseau (1994) looked for initial confirmation of a relationship between 
psychological contract breach and employee trust, satisfaction and retention.  In 
accordance with their predictions, breach was negatively related to employee trust, 
satisfaction, intent to remain with the organization, and actual turnover.  The specific 
breach-outcome correlations from the Robinson and Rousseau (1994) study, along with 
results from the remaining studies reviewed below, can be found in Table 3.  
 
In a longitudinal study of psychological contract breach, Robinson (1996) found 
that psychological contract breach was negatively related to employee task performance 
(a self-rating of in-role work performance), a measure of contextual performance (the

Turnley and Feldman (1998) examined psychological contract breaches during 

civic virtue form of organizational citizenship behaviors), and intent to remain with the 
organization.  In addition, those individuals who had already left their employer (actual 
turnover) had reported significantly greater levels of psychological contract breach. 
 
corporate restructuring.  Not surprisingly, individuals in organizations undergoing 
downsizing, reorganizations or mergers were more likely to perceive that their contracts 
had been breached.  In order to examine the potential effects of contract breach, Turnley 
and Feldman used the Exit, Voice, Loyalty and Neglect (EVLN) framework (Hirschman, 
1970).  Unfortunately, no correlations between contract breach and EVLN outcomes 
were reported in this study.  We do know, however, that employees in the restructuring 
organizations, along with reporting a higher number of breaches, were more likely to 
intend to quit their jobs and engage in job search behaviors.  These employees also 
reported lower affective commitment and lower organizational citizenship behaviors 
(OCBs).   
 
and Neglect (EVLN) framework (Hirschman, 1970) to categorize potential outcomes of 
contract breach.  The authors found that perceptions of contract breach were positively 
correlated with attempts to leave the organization (exit) and efforts to talk to upper 
management regarding necessary changes (voice).  Contract breach perceptions were 
negatively correlated with organizational citizenship behaviors (loyalty) and in-role 
performance (neglect).  In addition, only partial support was found for attractive 
employment alternatives, justification for the breaches, and procedural justice as

relationship between psychological contract breach and three types of employee 
behavior: intent to quit, neglect of in-role job duties, and OCBs.  In support of their main 
hypotheses, Turnley and Feldman (2000) found that psychological contract breach was

outcomes: satisfaction (with the job or the organization), trust (in the organization or 
one’s supervisor), intent to quit, turnover, organizational citizenship behaviors (several 
different types), performance (archival sources, individual ratings, supervisor ratings), 
workplace deviance behaviors, contract violation (including various dimensions of

Table 4 presents the results of the 10 separate meta-analyses.  The mean weighted effect 
sizes for the breach-outcome relationships range from -.066 for organizational 
commitment to -.519 for satisfaction.   

As outlined above, the majority of studies have identified relationships between 
perceived psychological contract breach and several important employee behaviors or 
other outcomes.  Identifying the existence of these relationships was an important step in 
our understanding of psychological contracts.  However, now that we know these 
relationships exist, it is important to understand why they exist, and in what situations the 
results of contract breaches will be the most severe. 
Attributions 

Attributions concern how individuals make sense of their own behavior and the 

behavior of other organizational members.  Attributions are relevant to the study of 
psychological contracts because they can help explicate the kinds of employee cognitions 
that will lead to the poorest individual and organizational outcomes (affect/emotions, 
attitudes, behaviors).  A recent book by Martinko (1995) takes a look at attributions from 
an organizational perspective.  The foreword to that text, written by Bernard Weiner, 

20 


indicates that “putting attribution theory in the context of organizational behavior should 
be of great benefit” (p. 5) to individuals working on research in organizations.  
Conceptual and empirical articles incorporating attributions as an explanatory mechanism 
for organizational events can be found in the areas of leadership (cf., Green & Mitchell, 
1979; Farquhar, 1995), performance appraisal (cf., Feldman, 1981), psychological 
contracts (cf., Lester et al., 2002; Morrison & Robinson, 1997), and other areas.  The 
recent application in the psychological contracts literature is of greatest importance to the 
present study.   

Several authors have pointed to the need for an attributional approach to 
psychological contracts because attribution theory has the potential to explain the 
relationship between cognitions of psychological contract breach and the negative 
emotions associated with psychological contract violation.  For instance, Turnley and 
Feldman (2000) indicated that future research should examine mediators other than 
unmet expectations and job satisfaction.  They proposed that attributions regarding why 
the contract breaches developed could potentially mediate the relationship between 
contract breaches and employee behaviors.  Lester et al. (2002) recommend examining 
“how the attributions that employees make when they perceive a breach of their 
psychological contract influence their attitudes and behaviors” (p. 54).  In addition, 
Conway and Briner (2002a) proposed that the perceived responsibility of the organization 
for the contract breach may result in an attribution of blame by the employee, and that 
this blame attribution may lead to feelings of resentment.

Although the recent application of attribution theory to the literature on 

A Detailed Attributional Perspective of the Breach!Violation Relationship 
 
psychological contracts is interesting, researchers have thus far failed to make explicit the 
types of attributions being studied.  For example, Lester et al. (2002) looked at 
attributions of reneging, disruption, and incongruence.  Reneging is believed to occur 
when the organization intentionally fails to keep one or more commitments with 
employees.  Disruption is hypothesized to occur when the organization is unable to live 
up to its promises, generally due to factors in the business environment that may have 
changed.  Incongruence is perceived when employees recognize that the terms of the 
employment relationship have been misconstrued (i.e., there is a genuine 
misunderstanding).  Unfortunately, Lester et al. (2002) did not relate these attributions to 
the typical categories of attributions discussed outside of the organizational literature 
(e.g., causal, responsibility, blame).  In addition, Robinson and Morrison (2000) only 
looked at reneging and incongruence, without separating reneging into its two types 
(inability to fulfill obligations versus unwillingness to fulfill obligations).  This is 
important, as an employee’s perception that the organization has deliberately or willingly 
failed to fulfill its obligations (i.e., elements of the psychological contract) is likely to be 
met with a stronger negative response than the perception that the organization was 
unable to fulfill those obligations. 
 
found within other disciplines, including the social psychological literature (e.g., Shaver, 
1985; Shaver & Drown, 1986; Weiner, 1995) the marital satisfaction literature (e.g., 
Fincham & Bradbury, 1987; Lussier, Sabourin, & Wright, 1993), and the literature on 

 Fortunately, useful models for separating various types of attributions can be 

22 


parent-child relationships (e.g., Brody, Arias, & Fincham, 1996; Springer, 2001).  These 
literatures have broken attributions down into three main types: causal attributions, 
responsibility attributions, and blame attributions.   

Causal attributions represent explanations for the occurrence of an event.  Weiner 
(1986) has proposed several causal dimensions that can serve as explanations for events, 
including locus of causality (internal/external; person/situation), stability 
(stable/unstable), controllability (controllable/not controllable), and globality 
(global/specific).  If an individual is faced with a negative event and attributes it to 
internal characteristics of someone else (internal attribution), believes that the cause is 
likely to be present again in the future (stable attribution), that the other individual 
controls whether the event occurs (controllable attribution), and the cause affects other 
areas of the person’s relationship with that other individual (global attribution), they are 
likely to respond more negatively.   

Although causal attributions are important, Bradbury and Fincham (1990) and 
Shaver (1985) propose that once an individual has determined the cause of a negative 
event, they focus on responsibility attributions.  These attributions involve the 
individual’s belief that the other individual is accountable or answerable for the event that 
has occurred.  Intentionality is one major factor influencing judgments of responsibility.  
Although it was originally proposed by Weiner (1986) as another potential causal 
attribution, intentionality may make more sense as a basic element of responsibility 
attributions (Bradbury & Fincham, 1990).  Once the individual makes a responsibility 
attribution regarding the other individual’s behavior, they then make “an evaluative 
judgment concerning the implicated individual’s liability for censure” (p. 18), or a blame 

23 


attribution.  It is the blame attributions that are believed to be most strongly linked to 
outcomes like marital distress. 

The sequence or ordering of attributions from causal to responsibility to blame 

has been labeled the entailment model (Fincham & Jaspars, 1980).  The underlying 
premise of the entailment model is that questions of responsibility only arise when 
another individual is believed to have caused an event, and judgments of blame only 
occur when an individual is deemed responsible for the event they have caused.  A 
depiction of the basic entailment model can be found in Figure 1.    
Empirical Support for the Entailment Model of Attributions 
 
Several studies have attempted to provide support for the entailment model, and 
all have occurred outside of the organizational context.  Although there is a good deal of 
supportive research, not all studies have reached the same conclusions regarding the 
validity of this model. 
 
causal, responsibility and blame attributions.  In the first study, mothers of fifth grade 
children were asked to make attributions for their parent-child conflicts.  Support was 
found for a model in which the relationship between causal attributions and blame 
attributions is mediated by responsibility attributions.  Causal attributions were correlated 
with responsibility attributions (r = .41) and responsibility attributions were correlated 
with blame attributions (r = .44).  In the second study, married couples were asked to 
make similar attributions for conflicts in their relationships.  Again, support was found 
for the entailment model, although the correlation between causal attributions and 
responsibility attributions (r = .19) was low and non-significant (likely due to the small

stronger (r = .66). 
 
responsibility attributions were related to marital dissatisfaction, but to the same degree.  
In this study, the measure of responsibility included blame items, thus the separate effects 
of responsibility and blame could not be determined.  Although supportive of the 
influence of attributions in general as predictors of marital satisfaction, this study failed 
to support the entailment model.  The authors proposed that this might be due to the fact 
that issues of accountability and blame were not as salient to this sample as they were for 
severely distressed couples seeking therapy.  It is also interesting to note that, due to the 
longitudinal nature of this study, Fincham and Bradbury were able to obtain information 
regarding the direction of causality.  They found that attributions predicted later marital 
satisfaction, whereas marital satisfaction did not influence subsequent attributions.  At 
least in this situation, cognitions influenced affect more than the reverse.   
 
(RAM) to establish consistent measurement of causal, responsibility and blame 
attributions.  They then used this newly created measure in three related studies.  In their 
first study, these three types of attributions were all found to be correlated with anger, but 
to different degrees.  For wives, anger correlated .37, .45, and .60 with causal, 
responsibility and blame attributions, respectively.  For husbands, the same relationships 
yielded correlations of .26, .56, and .65.  Thus blame attributions were found to be the 
most strongly related to anger.  In their examination of partial correlations, responsibility 
and blame attributions were related to anger after controlling for the effects of causal

attributions.  The correlation between causal attributions and anger was nonsignificant 
after partialling out either responsibility or blame.  When controlling for blame, the 
correlation between responsibility attributions and anger was nonsignificant.  The authors 
noted that this pattern of results was consistent with the entailment model (i.e., 
cause!responsibility!blame!anger).   
 
length of the RAM scale and shortened it to include only causal attributions and a 
composite of responsibility and blame attributions.  Their results supported the difference 
between causal and responsibility attributions, with responsibility attributions being more 
strongly linked to whining and anger.  Unfortunately, the consideration of responsibility 
and blame attributions as one construct made it impossible to test a full entailment model.     

In studies two and three, Fincham and Bradbury (1992) were concerned with the 

Most tests of the entailment model have been conducted in pieces, rather than in a 
comprehensive model, due to the small sample sizes that have prohibited the use of more 
comprehensive analyses.  In contrast to the typical pattern, Lussier, Sabourin, and Wright 
(1993) obtained a large enough sample (206 couples) that they were able to apply 
structural equation modeling to examine the entailment model of attributions.  Separate 
models were tested for husbands’ attributions for their wive’s behaviors and wive’s 
attributions for their husbands’ behaviors.  For wives, there was a significant direct path 
between causal and blame attributions (β = .164), which would not be predicted by the 
entailment model.  However, in support of the model, there were significant paths 
between causality and responsibility (β = .554) and responsibility and blame (β = .775) 
attributions.  The husband data fit the entailment model even better than the wife data, 
with significant paths between causality and responsibility (β = .563) and responsibility 

26 


Davey, Fincham, Beach and Brody (2001) used structural equation modeling to 

and blame (β = .679) attributions.  There was no significant direct path from causality to 
blame for husbands.  When the outcome measure of marital adjustment was added to the 
models, the husband data still conformed to the entailment model, with some minor 
changes to the beta weights of each specific path.  Blame was found to be negatively 
related to marital adjustment (β = -.363).  For the wife data, an additional path from 
responsibility to marital adjustment (β = -.291) was necessary to adequately explain their 
attribution process.       
 
explore the relationship between causal attributions, responsibility attributions (actually a 
combination of responsibility and blame attributions), and conflict.  Using factor analysis, 
they first determined that the two types of attributions are distinct constructs that can be 
analyzed separately.  Then they found that the relationship between causal attributions 
and conflict was fully mediated by responsibility attributions.  This pattern of 
relationships is supportive of the entailment model in which causal attributions! 
responsibility attributions!outcomes.  This study could have been made even more 
interesting if the authors had separated blame attributions to explore the relationship 
between responsibility and blame attributions.  In addition, if the authors had included a 
measure of affect (e.g., anger), they would have been able to explore the full entailment 
model along with potential affective and behavioral responses.  In other words, a model 
predicting causal attributions!responsibility attributions!blame attributions!anger! 
conflict could have been explored.    
 
has received support from several studies, including those that have incorporated the 

Although universal support for the full entailment model does not exist, the model

most robust methods of data analysis.  The causal!responsibility and 
responsibility!outcomes portions of the model seem to have the most support.  Some 
questions remain regarding whether responsibility and blame attributions represent 
distinct constructs that are worthy of separate analysis as part of the entailment model.  
Therefore, it appears logical to attempt to apply this model in an organizational setting to 
determine the extent of support it receives. 
Application of the Detailed Attributions to an Organizational Setting 

The model of attributions proposed above has not, to my knowledge, been applied 

in an organizational setting, nor has it been used to explain aspects of the  
organization!employee relationship like psychological contract breaches.  Although the 
marital satisfaction literature involves attributions between closely interacting individuals 
(typically spouses), similar attributions would be relevant to the relationship between 
employees and their employers.  In addition, the level of authority or power possessed by 
the organization will be greater than that of the typical employee.  Although some 
marriages will have a power disparity between husband and wife, an even more 
appropriate analogy would be the parent-child relationship.  The parent would be akin to 
the organization, and the employee would be akin to the child.  Attributions, similar to 
the ones discussed above, have been applied to the literature on parent-child relationships 
(Springer, 2001).  This relationship analogy (parent-child or husband-wife) was referred 
to in Rousseau’s (1995) work on psychological contracts. 

One possible difference that exists when applying attributions in an organizational 

setting is the more nebulous term “organization” as it does not have a single referent.  
When employees talk about the organization, they may be talking about the CEO, the 

28 


President, the Top Management Team, the Culture, the specific department they work 
within, or something else.  What is interesting is the possibility that different referents or 
“promise-makers” should be considered when studying the promises made to employees 
and breaches of the psychological contract (Marks, 2001).  This would be similar to the 
approach taken with the construct of organizational commitment (Becker & Billings, 
1993; Reichers, 1985).  Although the global construct of organizational commitment is 
important, these researchers were more concerned with the foci or constituencies to 
which employees could become committed (e.g., the organization as a whole, the 
supervisor, the work group, top management).  The typical employee does not have 
access to all of the behaviors exhibited by each of these constituencies of the 
“organization”.  Thus, the accuracy of their attributions may be called into question.  
However, it is not the accuracy of the attributions that influences the emotions employees 
feel, it is the attributions themselves, regardless of their veracity.  The psychological 
contracts literature rests on a similar premise.  Perceived breaches of the psychological 
contract influence employee emotions and behaviors, regardless of whether the breaches 
actually occurred.   
Application of the Entailment Model To Extant Psychological Contracts Research 
 
Although both conceptual and empirical works regarding psychological contracts 
have included some mention of attributions, the types of attributions considered are not 
always the same, and have not been well defined.  Application of the entailment model 
should enable us to make more consistent predictions based on years of research on 
attributions outside of the organizational setting.  To clarify my point, I will now outline 

29 


Robinson and Morrison (2000) recognized the importance of studying attributions 

several shortcomings of the existing attribution studies being conducted within the 
psychological contracts literature. 
 
in relation to psychological contract violation.  However, their conceptualization and 
operationalization of attributions mixed different types of attributions, without making it 
clear why they were doing so (or whether they recognized they were doing so).   

The part of their methods section outlining the types of attributions they were 
studying referred to “causal attributions” even though it appears that they were mostly 
concerned with responsibility attributions, as defined above.  Some of this confusion may 
come from the way attributions were defined by Morrison and Robinson (1997).  In their 
conceptual article, the authors noted that an organization could renege on a promise 
unintentionally or intentionally.  Recall that intent is generally defined as a responsibility 
attribution (Bradbury & Fincham, 1990; Shaver, 1985).  In order to explain the difference 
between unintentional and intentional reneging, Morrison and Robinson noted that 
unintentional reneging could result from the organization’s inability to live up to the 
contract, possibly due to unexpected circumstances like a changing internal or external 
business environment.  Such circumstances would represent a situational attribution (that 
could potentially deflect responsibility away from the organization), although the authors 
did not refer to it in this manner.  Similarly, the research conducted since the Morrison 
and Robinson (1997) article has failed to distinguish casual from responsibility 
attributions.   

In addition, no study has looked specifically at blame attributions even though 

blame, compared to the other two attribution types, should be the one most closely related 

30 


to anger and other feelings associated with psychological contract violation (Clore, 
Ortony, Dienes, & Fujita, 1993; Fincham & Bradbury, 1992; Ortony, Clore, & Collins, 
1988).  This is noteworthy, as Robinson and Morrison talk about attributions causing “the 
employee to blame the organization” (p. 532) though they do not incorporate a direct 
measure of blame in their study.     

Although the Morrison and Robinson (1997) article makes reference to causation, 
responsibility, and blame, the research that has been conducted regarding the relationship 
between psychological contract breach and psychological contract violation does not 
incorporate this distinction.  Therefore, in order to gain a better understanding of the 
factors that influence psychological contract violation, it is necessary to conduct research 
within this theoretical framework.  In this manner, the attributions incorporated into each 
study will be made explicit, it will be easier to build upon prior research, and we will 
more rapidly gain insight into the kinds of attributions that are most important to consider 
when attempting to mitigate or eliminate the negative feelings associated with 
psychological contract violation. 
Attributions and Psychological Contracts Combined 
 
process through which feelings of psychological contract violation develop, Morrison and 
Robinson (1997) created a model specifically to explain the development of contract 
violation.  In doing so, they made the conceptual distinction between psychological  
contract breach and psychological contract violation (as described earlier).     
 
Although the Morrison and Robinson (1997) model begins with a thorough 
 
depiction of when psychological contract breaches are perceived by employees, that 

In recognition of the fact that little research has been conducted regarding the 

31 


portion of the model is not as relevant to the present study.  The latter portion of their 
model, which attempts to explain circumstances under which psychological contract 
breaches will result in the negative feelings represented by psychological contract 
violation, is directly relevant to the current study.  Morrison and Robinson outlined the 
following elements of the interpretation process leading from perceived breach to 
violation: outcome assessment, attributions, fairness judgments, and social contract.   

In their model, outcome assessment includes both the perceived magnitude of the 

breach and the implications of the breach.  The most intense feelings of psychological 
contract violation are expected to develop when the magnitude of the psychological 
contract breach (i.e., the size of the discrepancy between what the employee believes the 
organization has promised them and what they believe the organization has actually 
provided) is large, and when it negatively affects other highly valued or important 
outcomes.   

Attributions of causation, responsibility and blame are mentioned by Morrison 

and Robinson, but the authors do not distinguish among them.  They do, however, 
introduce the concepts of reneging and incongruence in an attempt to explain the 
circumstances in which employees will perceive that contract breaches have occurred 
(the initial portion of their model).  Reneging is thought to occur when the organization 
knowingly fails to meet a contractual obligation.  This can happen either because the 
organization is unable to meet the obligation (e.g., possibly due to the current state of the 
economy or a change in the business environment) or the organization is unwilling to 
meet the obligation (e.g., the organization may never have intended to keep the promise, 
or may have changed its mind after the promise was made).  Incongruence occurs when 

32 


Morrison and Robinson include both procedural and interactional fairness 

Finally, the social contract can influence the degree of violation felt by employees 

the organization believes it has lived up to its end of the bargain, but the employee feels 
that the organization has failed to do so.  As psychological contracts are often implied by 
the organization’s culture and policies, not written down in a formal contract signed upon 
initial hiring, there is generally room for misinterpretation on the part of both the 
organization and the employee.   
 
judgments as moderators of the relationship between breach and violation.  Thus, to the 
extent that an employee believes that the breach of their psychological contract is due to 
unfair organizational procedures or that their interactions with the organization have been 
poor, the breach is more likely to lead to psychological contract violation. 
 
experiencing breaches of contract.  When the actions of the organization are in 
contradiction to the prevailing social contract (i.e., norms for behavior within the 
organization), the employee is more likely to experience psychological contract violation. 
 
empirical research.  The present study will focus specifically on how the different types 
of attributions employees make influence the relationship between psychological contract 
breach psychological contract violation.  Before discussing this purpose in more detail, it 
is necessary to provide some background regarding the empirical studies of psychological 
contract breach, violation and attributions that have been conducted since the Morrison 
and Robinson (1997) model was proposed. 
 
 

Each of the elements proposed by Morrison and Robinson (1997) deserves 

33 


Empirical Studies of Psychological Contract Breach, Violation and Attributions 

Within the past two years, the focus has begun to shift toward a more thorough 

understanding of the relationship between breach and violation.  This is in contrast to the 
early studies reviewed above that focused mainly on the relationship between breach 
perceptions and employee attitudes and behaviors.   

Robinson and Wolfe Morrison (2000) conducted a partial test of the theoretical 

model they had previously proposed (Morrison & Robinson, 1997).  In order to 
operationalize their conceptual distinction between psychological contract breach and 
psychological contract violation, Robinson and Wolfe Morrison (2000) created scales to 
address each construct.  The results of a factor analysis indicated that the two constructs 
are indeed different from one another.  Along with demonstrating both a conceptual and 
empirical distinction between psychological contract breach and psychological contract 
violation, the authors were interested in an exploration of when and why breaches 
sometimes lead to violation.  Robinson and Morrison (2000) examined both attributions 
and perceived fairness as potential explanations.  Contrary to their hypotheses, neither the 
attributions employees made nor perceptions of fairness were significantly related to 
violation.  However, the interaction of attributions and fairness was found to moderate 
the breach!violation relationship such that attributions had more of an effect under 
unfair conditions than under fair conditions. 

In a case study of psychological contracts, Pate and Malone (2000) interviewed 
former employees of a factory that had closed five years prior to the interviews.  They 
found that there were strong emotional responses associated with psychological contract 
violation, including anger, hatred, betrayal, revenge and blame, even after several years 

34 


had passed.  These feelings were accompanied by the employees’ perception that the 
organization was able to maintain the contract, but was simply unwilling to do so.  
Unfortunately, measures of responsibility and blame attributions were not part of Pate 
and Malone’s study.   

Conway and Briner (2002a) reported that broken promises (psychological 
contract breaches) were positively related to depression and anxiety, and exceeded 
promises were positively related to enthusiasm.  In addition, broken promises were 
specifically related to feelings of betrayal (versus feeling hurt) and exceeded promises 
were more likely to lead to feelings of self worth.  Although they only used a single item 
measure, the authors did attempt to obtain information regarding the attributions 
employees made for the perceived breaches of contract.  Through these analyses, the 
authors determined that holding the employer responsible for the breach of contract was 
only related to stronger feelings of betrayal.  Overall, this study adds to our knowledge of 
psychological contracts by examining them at a more fine-grained level of analysis than 
in prior studies.  The study also provided general support for the Morrison and Robinson 
(1997) model of psychological contract violation, although the degree of impact that 
attributions have on the breach!violation linkage is still in question. 
 
attributions for psychological contract breach.  They looked at both forms of reneging 
proposed by Morrison and Robinson (1997), but labeled them differently.  In the Lester et 
al. article, reneging involved the organization’s intentional failure to keep its 
commitments, and disruption involved an organization’s inability to live up to its 
commitments due to factors in the economy or business environment.  Lester et al. also 

Lester at al. (2002) explored the relationship between supervisor and subordinate 

35 


Lester et al. (2002) found that employees were much more likely to attribute 

included incongruence, or a misunderstanding between the organization and the 
employee, as another attribution that employees could make.  Finally, the authors were 
the first to describe nullification, the employee’s belief that they had failed to live up to 
their own end of the contract, thus making it unnecessary for the organization to fulfill its 
portion.  As one would expect, due to perceptual biases (e.g., self-serving bias), no 
employees chose nullification as their explanation for why the psychological contract 
breach occurred.    
 
psychological contract breaches to reneging or incongruence, whereas their supervisors 
were more likely to attribute those breaches to disruption.  Overall, employees were most 
likely to attribute breaches to reneging, followed by disruption, then incongruence.  As 
reneging would be the attribution expected to have the greatest negative impact on 
psychological contract violation (of the three attributions included in Lester’s study), it is 
important to note that it was the most frequently chosen explanation for psychological 
contract breaches.  Unfortunately, the authors did not explore attributions as the link 
between psychological contract breach and psychological contract violation.  The authors 
also ignored the distinction made by Morrison and Robinson (1997) regarding breach 
versus violation and examined only the relationship between psychological contract 
breach (not violation) and two outcomes, commitment and performance.  This is similar 
to much of the early research on psychological contracts described previously, as it 
ignores the affective and emotional aspects of psychological contract violation which are 
believed to be the more proximal link to these, and other, important outcomes.  As 
Sparrow (2000) indicated, the time has come to make the distinction between 

36 


commonplace breaches of the psychological contract and the more meaningful, affect-
laden, and psychologically significant feelings of psychological contract violation.   

Emotions 

Although affective responses like anger and frustration (and others) are likely to 
mediate the psychological contract breach! employee behavior relationship, no studies 
have provided empirical data to either support or refute this belief.  Muchinsky (2000) 
believes that researchers have neglected the topic of emotions in organizational research.  
He feels that “the time has come in organizational behavior to acknowledge emotions as a 
legitimate domain of scientific inquiry” (p. 803).  Muchinsky does not believe that we 
should abandon research on cognitive processes, but that we should specifically 
incorporate emotions, both as independent and dependent variables, into our theories and 
research.  As if in response to Muchinsky’s plea for the recognition of emotions as an 
integral part of organizational behavior, Lord, Klimoski, and Kanfer (2002) devoted 
nearly 500 pages to this topic.  In their text, Lord et al. echo Muchinsky’s beliefs about 
the importance of emotions in the workplace and provide an overview of the existing 
research, along with directions for future research.  One of the main points of their text is 
that “many work behaviors may have strong and consistent linkages to negative emotions 
(thus) attempts to change behavioral patterns without first changing associated emotions 
are likely to be unsuccessful” (p. 10).   
General Background Regarding Emotions 
 
Although it is possible to organize emotions in a variety of ways, one simple way 
to define the wide array of emotions is through the use of an affect circumplex (Russell & 
Barrett, 1999).  This circumplex can be composed of two dimensions, activation (ranging 

37 


Weiss and Cropanzano (1996) developed Affect Events Theory (AET), the best 

from unactivated to activated) and pleasantness (ranging from unpleasant to pleasant).  
The pleasantness category bears resemblance to the constructs of positive and negative 
affectivity.  Through the use of these two dimensions, it is possible to categorize many 
different types of emotions.  For example, emotions like anger, distress and fear would be 
relatively high on the activation dimension and relatively high in unpleasantness.  
Emotions like relaxed, content, and calm would be relatively high on the pleasantness 
dimension but closer to the unactivated end of the activation continuum.   
Affective Events Theory and Contract Violation 
 
known model of the structure, causes and consequences of affective experiences at work.  
In this model, they described how features of the work environment would make aversive 
workplace events more or less likely.  These aversive events, when present and perceived 
by employees, would have the potential to create negative affect.  This negative affect is 
thought to be linked to both work attitudes and workplace behaviors.  Several individual 
difference variables were proposed as potential moderators of the work event!affective 
reaction relationship and the affective reaction!affect-driven behaviors relationship.  
 
Following the AET model, certain workplace characteristics, including human 
resources policies and other organizational policies, would influence the degree to which 
employees face aversive events.  From a psychological contracts standpoint, the 
difference between what was promised to an employee and what was delivered could be 
perceived as an aversive event.  These aversive events would be expected to lead to 
negative job affect, including anger and other emotions described by Robinson and 
Morrison (1997).  Although not mentioned in AET, the attributions employees make for 

38 


the aversive events would be likely to impact the degree of affect experienced.  Other 
individual differences like emotion regulation tendencies and negative affectivity would 
also be expected to influence the strength of this relationship (Glomb, Steel, & Arvey, 
2002).  Negative affect, including anger and other elements of the psychological contract 
violation construct, would then influence employee behaviors and work attitudes.  For the 
purposes of the present study, the relevant behavioral and attitudinal outcome measures 
resulting from negative affective reactions are organizational citizenship behaviors, 
workplace deviance behaviors and organizational cynicism.     
Emotion Regulation 

As mentioned above, Affective Events Theory proposes that individuals who are 

better at regulating their emotions will be less likely to experience negative affective 
reactions like anger (Ashkanasy & Daus, 2002; Glomb et al., 2002; Weiss & Cropanzano, 
1996).  It is likely that an individual’s ability to regulate their emotions will influence the 
degree to which they feel negative emotions (i.e., psychological contract violation) when 
confronted with a particular aversive stimulus like a breach of their psychological 
contract.  This belief has not yet been tested in the psychological contracts literature, but 
support for the consideration of emotion regulation as a moderator of cognition!affect 
relationships is derived from the Affective Events Theory model.   

Organizational Cynicism 

The concept of cynicism is receiving increased attention by both researchers and 

 
practitioners.  Kanter and Mirvis (1989) devoted an entire book to the concept of 
cynicism as applied to life in general and to the workplace specifically.  The cartoon strip 
Dilbert has been cited as representative of the cynicism felt by many employees across a 

39 


variety of organizations.  Motion pictures have also provided examples of cynicism.  The 
movie Roger and Me (Moore, 1989) provides a highly critical view of the closing of 
several automobile manufacturing plants in Michigan by General Motors, and the 
accompanying layoffs of thousands of workers (Bateman, Sakano, & Fujita, 1992).  
Another example of the influence of media depictions of cynicism is the movie Office 
Space (Judge, 1999).  Although this movie uses humor, rather than a negative reality-
based situation, it does depict negative attitudes toward organizational change, 
organizational consultants and the organizations they are supposed to be helping.  In 
addition, current events like the Microsoft anti-trust case (and the related movie 
Antitrust), the Enron debacle, including the shredding of documents by the once well-
respected Arthur Andersen organization, the accounting errors and theft that have pushed 
Worldcom to bankruptcy, and the cutbacks in customer service implemented by several 
bankrupt airlines, provide a business environment that invites the cynical perspective.   
Different Kinds of Cynicism Represented in Organizational Research 

Researchers from many different disciplines and perspectives have studied some 
form of the construct known as “cynicism”.  Cynicism has been studied as a personality 
trait, as a reaction to societal institutions and as a reaction to the practices of large 
businesses.  Cynicism has also been researched in reference to different occupations, the 
specific organizations within which employees work, the specific demands of the jobs 
employees hold, and the ineffective organizational attempts at managing large scale 
change. 

When studied as a personality trait, cynicism has its roots in the Cynical Hostility 

subscale of the Cook and Medley (1954) Scale.  This view of cynicism holds that 

40 


individuals have deep-rooted perceptions of the world around them, and believe that the 
world is full of dishonest, untrustworthy, uncaring and selfish people.   

Cynicism has also been studied as a negative feeling towards society and its 
institutions.  Abraham (2000) indicates that this form of cynicism may have roots in 
breaches of the social contract.  For example, individuals raised to believe in the 
American Dream, emphasizing job security, home ownership, an affordable education, 
rising prosperity and improved economic prospects for future generations, may feel like 
this social contract has not been fulfilled.     

Although it probably falls within the general category of societal/institutional 

cynicism, cynicism about businesses or organizations is more specific in that its referent 
is organizations, not all societal institutions.  This form of cynicism represents the 
public’s perceptions of big business in general, and is not directly tied to the specific 
organization in which a particular employee works.  This form of cynicism is influenced 
by movies, television, books, newspapers, magazines and other media.       

Occupational cynicism is at a slightly lower level of analysis than business 

cynicism, in that it refers to cynicism towards one specific industry or occupation, not all 
businesses.  This form of cynicism represents an individual’s view of the particular 
occupation in which they, or others, are working.  For example, a recent survey indicated 
that the American public is cynical about the Health and Financial industry, including 
insurance companies.   

Work or job-related cynicism has often been studied within the literature on 

burnout (Burke, 2001; Leiter & Harvie, 1997).  Typical professions studied include those 
that provide assistance to the public and/or have a great deal of customer contact, 

41 


Another form of cynicism that has received recent attention in the literature is 

including police officers, hospital workers and flight attendants.  Although this form of 
cynicism is related to the type of organization within which an individual works, 
cynicism is said to form because of the job tasks being performed and organizational 
influences on the job tasks, not due to an employee’s overall feelings about their 
profession or occupation (Abraham, 2000).   
 
Cynicism About Organizational Change (CAOC).  This form of cynicism can be thought 
of as a reaction to failed change efforts and a “pessimistic outlook for successful change 
and blaming those responsible for lacking the motivation and/or the ability to effect 
successful change” (Wanous, Reichers, & Austin, 2000, p. 135).  It has also been 
described as the belief that efforts at change or improvement are doomed to failure, even 
though the problems are at least theoretically fixable (Agars & Vance, 1997; Vance, 
Brooks, & Tesluk, 1995).  In addition, Stanley and Meyer (1999) have defined change 
cynicism as a “questioning of management’s stated or implied motives for a specific 
organizational change” (p. 2).   

Finally, organizational cynicism represents what many researchers are referring to 

when they use the term “cynicism”, and is the form of cynicism that is relevant to the 
present research.  As defined by Dean, Brandes, and Dharwadkar (1998), organizational 
cynicism represents “a negative attitude towards one’s employing organization, 
comprising three dimensions: 1) a belief that the organization lacks integrity; 2) negative 
affect toward the organization; and 3) tendencies to disparaging and critical behaviors 
toward the organization that are consistent with these beliefs and affect” (p. 345).  Few 
empirical studies have specifically addressed organizational cynicism, as defined by 

42 


Dean et al. (1998), as its own construct.  A detailed description of empirical research on 
the variety of forms of cynicism is outside the scope of the present study, however, I will 
provide some information regarding the specific findings relating to organizational 
cynicism.   

 

Bateman, Sakano, and Fujita (1992) were concerned mainly with the formation of 

organizational cynicism.  In their study, they found that viewing the movie Roger and 
Me, with its negative depiction of General Motors’ plant closings in Flint, Michigan, 
tended to increase feelings of organizational cynicism towards GM. 

 

Andersson and Bateman (1997) conducted a laboratory experiment to explore the 
antecedents of organizational cynicism along with the effects of organizational cynicism 
on several employee behaviors.  They found that when the organization’s CEO was 
portrayed as highly compensated, when the organizational was performing poorly, and 
when the organization had announced harsh and immediate layoffs, respondents reported 
higher levels of organizational cynicism.  In addition, organizational cynicism was 
negatively correlated with intentions to perform organizational citizenship behaviors.   
Brandes, Dharwadkar, and Dean (1999) created an organizational cynicism scale 
based on their earlier theoretical contribution to the literature (Dean et al., 1998).  They 
obtained data from 129 supervisor-subordinate pairs regarding organizational cynicism 
and several outcome variables.  In support of their hypotheses, organizational cynicism 
was found to be negatively correlated with organizational commitment (r = -.66), in-role 
behaviors (r = -.21), and self-reported participation in employee involvement activities  
(r = -.46).  The hypothesized negative relationship between cynicism and organizational 
citizenship behaviors was not found in this study.       

43 


Based on the studies mentioned above, the organizational cynicism literature 
appears to be at a more primitive level than the literature on psychological contract 
breach.  The cynicism literature can still benefit from further explorations of the 
predictors and consequences of organizational cynicism.   
Organizational Cynicism as a Result of Psychological Contract Violation 
 
contract violation was believed to be related to employee cynicism.  In that study, use of 
the term violation was more in line with what I have been referring to in this paper as 
psychological contract breach.  Andersson proposed that “violations of psychological and 
implied contracts are the primary determinants of employee cynicism” (p. 1400).   
Since the 1996 conceptual article, Andersson has not published any articles 

Andersson (1996) proposed a theoretical framework in which psychological 

incorporating psychological contracts as a predictor of cynicism.  The closest thing was 
the study by Andersson and Bateman (1997), which explored several predictors of 
cynicism in the workplace.  Unfortunately, the authors did not conduct this study within 
the framework of contract violation. 

Another study addressing the link between psychological contracts and cynicism 

was conducted by Pate, Martin, and Staines (2000).  The authors proposed a model in 
which psychological contract breach leads to psychological contract violation and 
psychological contract violation, in turn, leads to increased cynicism.  Their study was 
able to provide some support for this model, although it came in the form of a case study 
of two plants of a Scottish industrial textiles firm.     

Agars and Vance (1997) conducted a study of the value of cynics’ comments on 

an organizational climate survey.  Although their study was not meant to be an 

44 


examination of the relationship between contract violation and cynicism, they did report 
that the comments written by organizational cynics (operationalized in their study as 
individuals who were cynical about organizational change) expressed more anger and 
frustration than the comments of non-cynics.  These qualitative data reveal that at least 
two of the key emotions associated with psychological contract violation are present in 
organizational cynics.  However, as the authors did not specifically study psychological 
contract breach or violation, several other precursors to these negative emotions are also 
plausible.  

Spreitzer and Mishra (2000) created a stress-based framework of survivor 
responses to downsizing in which they define four major archetypes of survivor 
responses, including a cynical response.  The cynical response is defined as an active and 
destructive response that is characterized by anger, disgust, resentment, cynicism, 
blaming others, moral outrage, badmouthing, and retaliating.  It is interesting to note that 
some of the emotions and cognitions mentioned in Spreitzer and Mishra’s cynical 
response are the same as the ones thought to be involved in feelings of psychological 
contract violation.  Spreitzer and Mishra even feel that “cynical survivors may perceive a 
blatant violation of their psychological contract” (p. 99), although they did not provide 
any data to support this assertion. 

Since Andersson’s (1996) conceptual article was published, no empirical articles 

testing the psychological contract violation!cynicism linkage have appeared in the 
published literature.  Therefore an analysis of the relationship between contract violation 
and cynicism is needed, and will be examined in this study.   

 
45 


Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs) 

A great deal of research has been conducted on organizational citizenship 

behaviors and the related constructs of contextual performance, extrarole behavior, and 
prosocial behavior.  OCBs represent the individual contributions in the workplace that go 
beyond role requirements and are often not specifically rewarded by the organization.  
These discretionary individual behaviors tend to promote the effective functioning of the 
organization (LePine, Erez, & Johnson, 2002; Organ & Ryan, 1995).  Examples of OCBs 
include helping co-workers to get caught up when they have been absent, going out of 
your way to make new employees feel welcome, defending the organization when other 
employees criticize it and showing pride when representing the organization in public.  In 
a recent article, Lee and Allen (2002) proposed a new target-based conceptualization of 
OCBs in which OCBs directed at the organization as a whole (OCBOs) can be 
differentiated from OCBs directed at individuals within the organization (OCBIs).  In 
their conceptualization, the first two examples of OCBs listed above would represent 
OCBIs, and the next two examples would represent OCBOs.     

For the purposes of the present study, the link between the emotions employees 

experience on the job and OCBs is relevant.  Several studies have explored the 
relationship between trait affect (i.e., positive and negative affectivity) and OCBs, or 
individual emotions and OCBs.  We also have information regarding the relative impact 
of general mood states and cognitive appraisals of job outcomes on the performance of 
OCBs.   

Kickul and Lester (2001) found that negative affect toward the organization (a 
construct made up of anger, frustration, spite, distress, disappointment, hostility, and 

46 


related emotions) was negatively correlated with two out of the four forms of 
organizational citizenship behavior measured in their study.  Negative affect toward the 
organization was negatively related to the loyal boosterism and personal industry 
measures of OCB, but not the interpersonal helping or individual initiative measures.  
Kickul and Lester offered a potential explanation for this finding, indicating that loyal 
boosterism and personal industry represent OCBs directed at the organization as a whole 
(OCBOs in the Lee & Allen, 2002 conceptualization), whereas interpersonal helping and 
individual initiative represent OCBs directed at other individuals in the organization 
(OCBIs).  Due to the fact that employees were asked to report the negative affect that 
they felt toward the organization in general, it makes sense that these feelings were most 
strongly related to OCBOs rather than OCBIs. 

Organ and Konovsky (1989) explored the relationship between job cognitions, 

mood state, and OCBs.  They reported that the relationship between job cognitions 
(including overall perceptions of the job and specific pay perceptions) and OCBs was 
stronger than the relationship between either negative or positive affect and OCBs.   
In contrast, George (1991) found that positive mood at work accounted for unique 
variance in prosocial behavior beyond that accounted for by fairness cognitions.     
In a previous meta-analysis, Organ and Ryan (1995) found a small positive 

correlation between positive affectivity and OCBs, but no relationship between negative 
affectivity and OCBs.  They also found weak relationships between conscientiousness 
and agreeableness and OCBs.  Perceptions of fairness, satisfaction, leader supportiveness 
and commitment yielded stronger relationships with OCBs than the personality variables.   

47 


In a more recent meta-analysis, LePine et al. (2002) examined some of the same 
variables that were considered by Organ and Ryan (1995).  They reported correlations 
between OCBs and satisfaction (r = .20), commitment (r = .17), fairness perceptions (r = 
.20), leader support (r = .25) and conscientiousness (r = .19).  Unfortunately, they did not 
report any correlations between any trait or state affect or emotion measures and OCBs.   

Using their distinction between OCBOs and OCBIs, Lee and Allen (2002) 
proposed that job affect would contribute more to the prediction of OCBIs, and job 
cognitions would contribute more to the prediction of OCBOs.  Their results indicated 
that job affect marginally significantly increased the variance explained in OCBIs over 
job cognitions, whereas job cognitions did not explain increased variance above and 
beyond job affect.  For OCBOs, job cognitions explained additional variance beyond that 
accounted for by job affect, but job affect did not add predictive power beyond job 
cognitions.  Another interesting finding of their study was the fact that individual, 
discrete negative emotions (specifically, fear) added predictive value to OCBIs, above 
and beyond the general measure of negative affect.  A similar relationship did not hold 
for discrete positive emotions.     

Much of the existing research on OCBs and psychological contracts has taken 

place in the context of psychological contract breach, not the more affect-laden construct 
of psychological contract violation.  Thus, while we know that psychological contract 
breach has been found to correlate negatively with the performance of OCBs (Robinson, 
1996; Turnley & Feldman, 2000; Turnley & Feldman, 1999a), we do not know how 
strong this relationship is for psychological contract violation.  Based on the correlations 
between positive affect, negative affect, or specific emotions and OCBs noted above, it is

reasonable to believe that there will be a significant negative relationship between 
psychological contract violation and the performance of OCBs.  As in the Kickul and 
Lester (2001) study, it is likely that this relationship will be stronger for OCBOs than 
OCBIs.  Because the present research includes a cognitive measure of psychological 
contract breach along with an affective measure of psychological contract violation, it 
will be possible to examine the relative strength of these two relationships.    

Workplace Deviance Behaviors (WDBs) 

Workplace deviance behavior represents “voluntary behavior that violates 
 
significant organizational norms and, in doing so, threatens the well-being of the 
organization or its members, or both” (Bennett & Robinson, 2000, p. 349).  Recent 
research on workplace deviance behaviors has reached a similar target-based 
conceptualization to the one discussed in the above section on OCBs.  It is now viewed as 
important to separate workplace deviance behaviors that are directed at the organization 
(WDO) from those that are directed primarily at individuals within the organization 
(WDI).  Part of the reason for the separation is that different predictors may be more 
relevant to one target of deviance than another.  In the present study, for example, 
organizational cynicism is likely to be more closely linked to deviant behaviors directed 
at the organization, as the referent in both cases is the organization, not its individual 
members.  In addition, because psychological contract breach and violation are measured 
with an organizational referent in the present study, these variables would also be 
expected to correlate more strongly with organizationally directed deviant behaviors than 
interpersonally directed deviant behaviors.   

49 


The incorporation of workplace deviance and other antisocial behaviors, as 

 
potential results of psychological contract violation, has been suggested by Turnley and 
Feldman (1999b).  However, most of the prior research on psychological contracts has 
not included measures of workplace deviance or has only looked at breach!deviance 
relationships not violation!deviance relationships.  Part of the reason may have to do 
with the difficulty of obtaining organizations that are willing to allow this type of 
information to be gathered from their employees.  It may also be due to the fact that most 
studies have been concerned with the linkage between psychological contract breach and 
common behavioral outcomes.   The concept of psychological contract violation itself 
(and its associated negative emotions, including anger) has not often been included in the 
research, even though a link between feelings of anger and frustration and deviant 
behaviors has been reported in the deviance and antisocial behavior literatures (Spector, 
1997).   

Specific Hypotheses 

Several specific propositions may be derived from the literature review provided 
above.  These propositions basically fall into two categories.  The first category includes 
all hypotheses related to a test of the entailment model, and thus is concerned with 
attributions for psychological contract breach and how they influence psychological 
contract violation.  These hypotheses are targeted towards gaining a better understanding 
of the process through which psychological contract breach influences psychological 
contract violation.  The second category includes general relationships among 
psychological contract breach, psychological contract violation and key outcome 
variables like organizational cynicism, OCBIs, OCBOs, WDIs, and WDOs.  Some of 

50 


these relationships are analyzed in an attempt to replicate previous findings (e.g., 
breach!outcomes) and others attempt to go beyond those findings (e.g., violation or 
negative emotions!outcomes).      
Hypotheses Related to the Entailment Model 
Hypothesis #1 

Causal attributions, responsibility attributions and blame 
attributions will be positively intercorrelated. 

The findings from the marital literature have consistently demonstrated that 

causal, responsibility and blame attributions are positively intercorrelated (cf. Davey et 
al., 2001; Fincham & Bradbury, 1987a, 1987b, 1992; Lussier et al., 1993).  Although the 
employee-employer relationship is not exactly the same type of relationship as the 
relationship between spouses, the pattern of relationships is expected to generalize to the 
organizational sample.   
Hypothesis #2 

The correlation between causal and blame attributions will be 
smaller than either the correlation between responsibility and 
blame attributions or the correlation between causal and 
responsibility attributions. 

A pattern of correlations in which blame and responsibility attributions are  

strongly related, causal and responsibility attributions are strongly related, and causal and  
blame attributions are less strongly related would also be expected based on the marital  
literature outlined above.  Although this pattern of correlations would not, in and of itself,  
provide conclusive support for an entailment model of attributions, it would suggest that  
such a model is at least plausible.  The more robust test of the entailment model is found  
in hypothesis 7.  

51 


Hypothesis #3 

The correlation between blame attributions and psychological 
contract violation will be stronger than the correlation between 
either causal attributions and psychological contract violation or 
responsibility attributions and psychological contract violation. 

Again, based on the entailment model research, we would expect blame 

attributions to be most strongly correlated with the negative affect associated with 
psychological contract violation, much as blame attributions have been the most strongly 
correlated with marital adjustment (Lussier et al., 2003), anger (Fincham & Bradbury, 
1992) and marital conflict (Davey et al., 2001).  In addition, Ortony et al. (1988) have 
indicated that when an individual is displeased about an undesirable event (e.g., 
psychological contract breach) and disapproves of someone else’s blameworthy action 
(e.g., blame’s the organization for breaching the contract), feelings of anger, outrage, 
irritation, annoyance, indignation, and rage are likely to result.  Several of these emotions 
are represented at part of the construct of psychological contract violation.       
Hypothesis #4 

 

Causal, responsibility and blame attributions will each separately 
explain a significant amount of variance in psychological contract 
violation. 
After accounting for the variance explained by causal attributions 
in the prediction of psychological contract violation, responsibility 
attributions will explain additional variance. 
After accounting for the variance explained by causal and 
responsibility attributions in the prediction of psychological 

Hypothesis #5 

Hypothesis #6 

52 


contract violation, blame attributions will explain additional 
variance in this relationship. 

Hypotheses 4, 5 and 6 each explore pieces of the entailment model.  Based on 

 
prior research in the marital satisfaction literature, we would expect that all three 
attribution types would explain significant amounts of variance in the prediction of 
psychological contract violation.  This, in and of itself, is not enough to support the 
entailment model, so we would also expect responsibility attributions to explain 
additional variance beyond that accounted for by causal attributions.  We would then 
expect blame attributions to explain additional variance beyond that accounted for by 
either of the other two attributions.   
Hypothesis #7 

An entailment model of causal, responsibility and blame 
attributions in which causal attributions lead to responsibility 
attributions, which lead to blame attributions, which lead to 
psychological contract violation, will fit the data well.   

The entailment attribution model from the marital satisfaction literature (Fincham 
 
& Bradbury, 1987a) provides the foundation for Hypothesis 7 and is depicted in Figure 3. 
Although several studies conducted in the marital literature provide at least partial  
support for the entailment model, there are studies that have reported findings that  
are inconsistent with this model.  For example, Fincham and Bradbury (1987b) found that 
causal and responsibility attributions were both positively correlated with marital 
dissatisfaction, however the strength of these relationships was similar and offered no 
support for a stronger link between responsibility attributions and marital dissatisfaction.     

53 


Bringing the entailment model into the organizational literature will help to provide a 
robust test of this model as the test is taking place outside of the literature within which 
the model was created.  Support for the entailment model obtained from an organizational 
sample would provide further justification for continued use of this model to explain 
emotional and behavioral outcomes across domains.   
Hypotheses Related to the Relationship Between Breach, Violation and Outcomes 
Hypothesis #8 

When aspects of the psychological contract that are deemed more 
important by an employee are breached, the employees will be 
more likely to experience psychological contract violation.  In 
other words, a multiplicative combination of breaches and their 
importance ratings will be positively correlated with psychological 
contract violation. 

As indicated in Morrison and Robinson’s (1997) theoretical model, the most 

intense feelings of violation are expected to develop when the magnitude of the contract 
breach is large, and when it negatively affects other highly valued or important outcomes.   
Hypothesis #9 

The strength of the relationship between psychological contract 
breach and psychological contract violation will be moderated by 
the individual’s emotion regulation ability.   

Based on Affective Events Theory, it is likely that individuals who are able to 

more effectively regulate their own emotions will be less likely to experience the 
negative emotions associated with psychological contract violation, even though they 
perceive that a breach of their psychological contract has occurred. 

54 


Hypothesis #10 

Psychological contract violation will be positively correlated with 
organizational cynicism. 

Based on the theoretical model proposed by Andersson (1996), it is likely that the 

 
negative emotions associated with psychological contract violation will be positively 
correlated with the attitudinal measure of organizational cynicism. 
Hypothesis #11 

Psychological contract violation will be negatively correlated with 
organizational citizenship behaviors. 

Kickul and Lester (2001) and other researchers have identified a link between 

 
negative affect toward the organization and OCBs.  As psychological contract violation 
basically represents a cluster of three main negative emotions, these feelings should be 
associated with lower levels of OCBs. 
Hypothesis #12 

Psychological contract violation will be more strongly negatively 
correlated with organizational citizenship behaviors directed at the 
organization than organizational citizenship behaviors directed at 
individuals within the organization. 

The referent for contract breaches and violation examined in this study is the 

 
organization, not some subset of the organization (e.g., work group, supervisor, 
department).  Therefore, it is likely that the negative feelings associated with 
psychological contract violation will be more strongly associated with behaviors directed 
at the organization, not its specific members.   
Hypothesis #13 

Psychological contract violation will be positively correlated with 
workplace deviance behaviors 

55 


 
Turnley and Feldman (1999b) proposed a link between psychological contract 
violation and workplace deviance behaviors.  This link makes sense as anger and other 
elements of psychological contract violation are thought to be precursors to workplace 
deviance behaviors.   
Hypothesis #14 

Psychological contract violation will be more strongly positively 
correlated with workplace deviance behaviors directed at the 
organization than with workplace deviance behaviors directed at 
individuals within the organization 

As with OCBs, the referent for contract breaches and violation examined in this 

 
study is the organization, not some subset of the organization (e.g., work group, 
supervisor, department).  Therefore, it is likely that the negative feelings associated with 
psychological contract violation will be more strongly associated with behaviors directed 
at the organization, not its specific members.   
Hypothesis #15 

The correlations between psychological contract violation and 
organizational citizenship behaviors, workplace deviance 
behaviors, and organizational cynicism will be stronger than the 
correlations between psychological contract breach and these same 
variables. 

Although no studies have addressed differences in the strength of the 

 
breach!outcomes and violation!outcomes relationships, it is likely that the affective 
response of psychological contract violation will be more closely linked to negative 
employee attitudes and behaviors.  This proposition is supported by Affective Events 
Theory. 

56 


Hypothesis #16 

Organizational cynicism will be positively correlated with 
workplace deviance behaviors 

As organizational cynicism represents a negative workplace attitude, it is believed 

 
to be associated with an increased frequency of engagement in deviant behaviors. 
Hypothesis #17 
Organizational cynicism will be negatively correlated with 
organizational citizenship behaviors 

Following the same logic as hypothesis 16, organizational cynicism is believed to 

 
be associated with a decreased frequency of engagement in organizational citizenship 
behaviors.

CHAPTER 2: METHOD 

 

Participants and Procedures 

Pilot Sample Participants 

Fifty employees of a large government organization completed a survey 

containing the key constructs in this study.  At the time employees were surveyed, this 
government organization was undergoing a large-scale organizational change effort that 
included a reduction in force.  Individuals within this organization received new 
communications every few weeks regarding who was and was not losing their job.  The 
environment within this organization suited itself very well to the study of psychological 
contract violation, hence the inclusion of this organization as the pilot sample.   

The 50 individuals who filled out the survey had a mean age of 41-45 years, had 
been in their current position for 5-10 years and had been with the organization for 10-15 
years.  The majority of respondents were male (64%) and in non-managerial positions 
(76%).  A more specific breakdown of pilot sample participant characteristics, as they 
compare to the full sample characteristics, can be found in Table 5.   
Pilot Sample Procedures 

In order to obtain survey data from the government organization, the surveys were 

handed out during a break at a stress management conference sponsored by the 
organization.  Only individuals who agreed to fill out the survey were given the survey to 

58 


complete.  This agreement, plus the ability to follow up with individuals during the 
conference, allowed for a response rate of 100 percent of the individuals who originally 
agreed to complete the survey.  The individual handing out the surveys was given 
specific instructions to read to the respondents when handing out the survey.  These 
instructions are similar to the ones printed on the survey itself, and similar to the five 
minute overview I provided when handing out the surveys in the large insurance 
organization (see next section). 

It should be noted that because employees in the large government organization 
were attending a stress management conference, it is possible that their responses may 
have been influenced by the context within which they were completing the surveys.  For 
instance, their employment relationship was likely to be more salient to them at the time 
they completed the surveys.  This relevance of the survey content may have contributed 
to the high response rate and also may have caused employees to make more negative 
ratings on the survey than they would have in their normal work environment.  However, 
if employees trusted the individual handing out the surveys and perceived that the stress 
management program was useful (and not just a ploy by the organization to gloss over 
the real issues), their responses on the survey could have been less extreme than if they 
completed the survey back at their organization.  Overall, the prevalence of psychological 
contract breach in this sample was slightly higher than that of the full sample, but it is 
unclear whether this is a direct result of the setting in which the survey was completed or 
real differences based on the fact that this organization was undergoing a larger degree of 
organizational change than the insurance organization. 
 

59 


 
Full Sample Participants and Procedures 

The full sample consisted of several groups of individuals from a large Fortune 

500 Insurance Company (N=303), a few individuals from a large internet 
communications company (N=5), and individuals from the large government 
organization that was used for the pilot and described above (N=50).  As indicated above, 
the greatest number of respondents was obtained from the large insurance organization.  
For the combined sample, the mean age of the employees was in the 31-35 year category.  
Note that this is a lower average than for the pilot sample in which no individuals were 
under the age of 36.  Most employees in the full sample were male (63%) and were at 
non-managerial levels in the organization (73%).  The mean tenure in their current 
position was 1-2 years and their mean tenure with the organization was 3-4 years.  
Employees in the full sample thus had shorter tenure in both their specific positions and 
their organizations than individuals in the pilot sample.     

Large insurance organization—training department participants.  
Thirty-five of the individuals from the large insurance organization were part of 
the organization’s training department.  These individuals held positions ranging from 
Director (the highest level) to intern (the lowest level).  Although all individuals worked 
in the same department, their job functions differed.  Representative functions performed 
by individuals in this department included administrative support for training classes, 
instructors for training classes, designers/developers of training programs, 
designers/developers of broader performance improvement solutions in addition to 
training, web designers/developers, and systems support.  The mean age of individuals in 

60 


this sub-sample was 31-35 years, their mean tenure in their current positions was 2-3 
years and their mean tenure with the organization was 3-4 years.  Fifty-three percent of 
these individuals were female and 17 percent held managerial positions. 
Large insurance organization—training department procedures. 
Individuals in the training department were introduced to the survey during an 

organizational communication meeting.  I was given 20 minutes to introduce my survey 
and ask the employees to fill it out.  The surveys were then placed in employees’ office 
mailboxes.  A box with a small slit in it was placed near the employee mailboxes for 
returned surveys.  In order to boost response rates, follow up e-mails were sent each week 
for the next three weeks.  The response rate for this sub-group within the insurance 
organization was 70 percent.  

Large insurance organization—claims and sales department participants. 
The sample also consisted of 268 individuals from several other positions within 

the insurance organization who were attending training conducted by the department 
mentioned above.  These individuals held jobs such as claims representative, claims 
manager, insurance agent, office manager and sales manager and ranged in organizational 
tenure from new hires to over 20 years.  Demographic breakdowns for these participants 
may be found in Table 6.  The mean age for Property Claims Associates (individuals who 
handle homeowners insurance claims) was 31-35 years, their mean tenure in their current 
position was between 6 months and 1 year, and their mean tenure with the organization 
was 2-3 years.  Seventy-seven percent of these individuals were male and only 7 percent 
held managerial positions within the organization.          

61 


The mean age for Casualty Claims Associates (individuals who handle auto 
accident liability decisions and injuries) was 25-30 years, their mean tenure in their 
current position was 1-2 years, and their mean tenure with the organization was 2-3 years.  
Fifty-eight percent of these individuals were female and none of them held managerial 
positions within the organization.          

The mean age for Auto Claims Associates (individuals who handle auto insurance 
vehicle claims) was 36-40 years, their mean tenure in their current position was 1-2 years, 
and their mean tenure with the organization was 3-4 years.  Seventy-nine percent of these 
individuals were male and 12 percent held managerial positions within the organization.          

The mean age for Sales Employees (insurance agents, associate agents, sales 
managers and office managers) was 36-40 years, their mean tenure in their current 
position was 2-3 years, and their mean tenure with the organization was 3-4 years.  Fifty-
seven percent of these individuals were male and 17 percent held managerial positions 
within the organization.       

Large insurance organization—claims and sales department procedures. 
For this sample, data were collected over a period of four months of training 

classes (approximately 10-20 participants in each class), in order to ensure that a 
sufficient sample size was obtained.  Approximately 30 minutes were set aside for the 
presentation of my survey during each training class conducted within the training center 
during that four month timeframe.  During the first five minutes, I described the purpose 
of my study (in generic terms), my status as both a full time employee and a graduate 
student, and the instructions for filling out the survey.  I paraphrased the instructions 
printed on the cover page of the survey (see Appendix C).  I explained that the survey 

62 


was part of my dissertation research, that participation was voluntary, that their responses 
would be anonymous and the results would not be shared with the management of their 
organization.  I indicated that the survey would take about 20-30 minutes to complete, 
and encouraged participants to read the instructions for each section before making their 
responses.  Finally, each participant was encouraged to take the cover sheet (which 
contained my OSU e-mail address) in case they wanted to contact me for a summary of 
the results, or to set up a one on one interview.  Based on the fact that I was physically 
present when asking people to fill out the survey, and the fact that time had already been 
set aside during which no other training materials were being presented, the vast majority 
of individuals chose to complete the survey.  A few individuals returned blank copies or 
refused to fill out the survey, and the total response rate for this group was 96 percent.   
 

Internet communications company participants. 
For the internet communications company sample, only 5 individuals responded 
to the survey.  This small number was due to the fact that this sample was a convenience 
sample obtained by a contact within the organization.  In addition, the downturn in the 
economy and subsequent layoffs within this organization caused members of the 
organization to be wary about filling out this type of survey.  As a result, only five (out of 
20) individuals returned the survey, for a response rate of 25 percent.  Based on the small 
number of individuals from this organization, no specific demographic breakdowns are 
presented. 

Internet communications company procedures. 
To obtain participation in this study, my contact handed the survey out to 20 web 
developers and graphic designers, with instructions to complete it on their own time.  My 

63 


contact explained that the survey was voluntary and anonymous, and that the respondents 
could direct their questions, or requests for results, to me.  The specific directions that 
were provided on the survey itself can be found on the first page of Appendix C.   

Measures Used 

A self-report survey methodology was employed in order to determine whether 
the attributions employees make for breaches of their psychological contracts influence 
their reactions to those breaches in the form of feelings of psychological contract 
violation.  Several forms of the questionnaire were used, depending upon the specific 
sample.  At a minimum, each questionnaire consisted of global and specific measures of 
psychological contract breach, attributions (causal, responsibility, and blame), negative 
emotions, psychological contract violation, positive emotions, organizational cynicism 
and organizational citizenship behaviors.  Workplace deviance behaviors were included 
as an additional variable on the pilot questionnaire and on the small number of surveys 
from the large internet communications company.  Emotion regulation was included for 
the large insurance organization and the internet communications company, but was not 
included in the pilot questionnaire.   
Psychological Contract Breach 

Dimensional breach measure. 
An 18-item measure incorporating six types of contract breach was used, as in 
Lester et al. (2002).  Attribution ratings were made for each of the six main types of 
contract breach (not all 18 items making up the six types).  As mentioned previously, the 
six types of contract breach I included were Benefits (two items), Pay (three items), 
Advancement Opportunities (three items), The Work Itself (four items), Resource 

64 


Support (two items), and A Good Employment Relationship (four items).  In prior 
research, Lester et al. reported Cronbach’s alpha reliability of .89 for the 18-item scale.  
In addition, Turnley and Feldman (2000) provided validity evidence in the form of a .70 
correlation between a similar 16-item measure of psychological contract breach and a 
single item, global measure that had been used in previous research by Robinson and 
Rousseau (1994).  For the full sample in the present study, the reliability of the 
dimensional contract breach scale was .89, and the correlation between this scale and the 
global measure of contract breach was .56.  In addition, reliability levels were also good 
for each breach dimension taken separately, including Benefits (α=.78), Pay (α=.90), 
Advancement Opportunities (α=.91), The Work Itself (α=.88), Resource Support 
(α=.92), and A Good Employment Relationship (α=.86). 

Global breach measure. 
Robinson and Morrison’s (2000) global measure of psychological contract breach 

was also used in this study.  The only change to this measure was the inclusion of the 
words “to me” in the first item of the measure.  The item, with my additional wording in 
parentheses, was as follows: “Almost all the promises made (to me) by my employer 
during recruitment have been kept so far”.  The addition of these two small words is 
important as the psychological contract, and its associated promises, are taken at the 
individual level.  Without the addition of the words “to me”, the employee might perceive 
that we were asking them to evaluate all the promises that were made across employees 
at that organization, not just the ones specifically made to them.  In the other four items 
created by Robinson and Morrison, the “to me” referent exists, thus those items did not 
require any modification.  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .91 in the present study. 

65 


Causal, Responsibility, and Blame Attributions 

Causal attributions were measured with a modified version of the Relationship 
Attribution Measure (RAM) scale developed by Fincham and Bradbury (1992).  Three 
types of causal attributions, locus of causality, stability, and globality were measured, 
with a single item for each type.       

Responsibility attributions were also measured with a modified version of the 
RAM scale developed by Fincham and Bradbury (1992).  Two types of responsibility 
attributions, intentionality and selfishness were used, with single items for each type.  In 
addition, an overall item directly asking about responsibility was used. 

Like causality and responsibility attributions, blame attributions were measured 
with a modified version of the RAM scale developed by Fincham and Bradbury (1992).  
A direct single item measure of blame was used as this has been advocated as the best 
way to assess blame (Bradbury & Fincham, 1990).  In addition, as Shaver (1985) has 
indicated that one manifestation of blaming someone is to desire that they be punished or 
reprimanded for their actions, an additional item tapping into this aspect of blame was 
included.  

In past research, overall indexes of attributions have been formed to represent 

causal and responsibility attributions.  Fincham and Bradbury (1987) advocated summing 
all items pertaining to causal attributions.  Thus, a causal attribution scale was formed for 
the present study by summing the different causal dimensions (locus within the 
organization, and the global and stable nature of the cause) across all elements of the 
psychological contract that had been breached.  A similar process was used to form either 
a responsibility or blame attribution index, with higher scores indicating endorsement of 

66 


the attributions that are hypothesized to be related to negative emotions and other 
negative outcomes.  Fincham and Bradbury (1987) and Davey et al. (2001) have reported 
internal consistency reliabilities ranging from .71 to .90 for causality and responsibility 
scales used in the marital satisfaction literature, with the majority of the reliabilities 
clustering in the low .80s.  In the present study, causal, responsibility, and blame 
attributions had alpha reliabilities of .60, .81 and .74, respectively.  The .60 reliability for 
causal attributions indicates that the three different elements of this attribution (locus 
within the organization, and the global and stable nature of the cause) may be tapping 
into somewhat different information.  It is also possible that the lower reliability is due to 
meaningful differences in perceptions of causality across the various dimensions of the 
psychological contract.  However, as there are no specific hypotheses predicted for each 
type of causal attribution separately, the causal scale will still be used in the analyses, 
with the caveat that the scale may be more heterogeneous than previously believed.    
Although not part of the Fincham and Bradbury (1992) measure, I included an 

item to address whether the employee felt that there was a misunderstanding between the 
organization and themselves that led to the contract breach.  This item was included as it 
represented the “incongruence” form of breach that had been suggested by Morrison and 
Robinson (1997).  This item was included to ensure that the attributions included in this 
study cover the types of attributions that have been suggested in previous conceptual and 
empirical work, along with adding additional, more specifically defined, types.  In this 
way, comparisons to prior work can be made, along with the new insights that will be 
obtained with the more explicit definition of the types of attributions being considered.  
An additional benefit of this item was identified during the pilot study.  As this item 

67 


would be expected to correlate negatively with blame and responsibility attributions, it 
can be used to indicate irregular (possibly rushed or random) response patterns on the 
part of respondents.  For example, if an employee indicates that they hold the 
organization responsible for their breach of contract and blame them for it as well, it does 
not make sense that they would also indicate that the breach was due to a genuine 
misunderstanding between themselves and the organization.  If patterns of this nature 
were found, they would tend to call into question the responses of these employees. 
Psychological Contract Violation 

A four-item measure created by Robinson and Morrison (2000) was used to 

measure contract violation.  In the only study to use this scale, Robinson and Morrison 
reported a distinction between this measure of violation and a five-item measure of 
perceived breach.  In their factor analysis, the two scales loaded on different factors.  In 
addition, they reported an alpha reliability of .92 for the violation scale.  The reliability of 
.92 found in the present study also supports the high internal consistency of this scale.  
Negative Emotions  
 
Several additional negative emotions were included to supplement the items on 
the psychological contract violation scale.  These emotions include feeling hurt, outrage 
and resentment, and were borrowed from Conway and Briner (2002a).  Although not part 
of Robinson and Morrison’s (2000) contract violation scale, these negative emotions 
represent additional types of feelings that have been identified in theoretical writings 
(e.g., Morrison & Robinson, 1997) as potential results of perceived breaches of the 
psychological contract.  In fact, one could argue that a strong correlation between these 
items and the contract violation measure would indicate that we might want to consider 

68 


broadening the measure of contract violation to include additional emotions.  In the 
present study, the alpha reliability of the negative emotions scale was .89. 
Positive Emotions 
Although secondary to the main purpose of this study, positive emotions were 
 
included based on the possibility that they would result from over-fulfillment of several 
dimensions of the psychological contract.  The positive emotions included feeling cared 
for, valued, pride, respect and admiration.  These positive emotions were also borrowed 
from Conway and Briner (2002a) and achieved an alpha reliability of .91.   
Organizational Cynicism 

A 14-item measure of organizational cynicism, created by Brandes, Dharwadkar, 
and Dean (1999), was used.  Brandes et al. conducted both exploratory and confirmatory 
factor analyses in order to make the determination on the final 14 items to be included in 
the measure.  In line with reasoning provided by Dean, Brandes, and Dharwadkar (1998), 
this measure of organizational cynicism treats cynicism as an attitude and thus 
incorporates cognitive, affective and behavioral components.  Although the authors did 
not report an internal consistency reliability for their organizational cynicism measure, I 
found the internal consistency reliability to be high (α=.94).   
Organizational Citizenship Behaviors 
 
developed by Lee and Allen (2002) was chosen for inclusion in this study.  This measure 
included an 8-item subscale for OCBs directed at the organization (OCBO scale) and an 
8-item subscale for OCBs directed at individuals within the organization (OCBI scale).  
Confirmatory factor analyses have supported the separation of these two constructs and 

The new 16-item measure of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), 

69 


reliabilities of .83 for the OCBO scale and .88 for the OCBI scale were reported by Lee 
and Allen.  The present study found similar reliabilities to those reported previously for 
both the OCBO scale (α=.83) and OCBI scale (α=.85).  
Workplace Deviance Behaviors 
 
Bennett and Robinson’s (2000) workplace deviance measures were chosen for 
inclusion in this study.  The seven-item interpersonal deviance scale, measuring deviant 
behaviors directed at other workers, was incorporated without changes.  Reliabilities of 
.81 for the organizational deviance scale, and .78 for the interpersonal deviance scale, 
were reported by Bennett and Robinson.  For the present study, the 12-item 
organizational deviance scale, measuring deviant behaviors directed at the organization, 
was shortened to nine items.  The three removed items dealt with falsifying receipts to get 
reimbursement for business expenses beyond what was owed, using an illegal drug or 
consuming alcohol on the job, and dragging out work in order to get overtime.  The first 
two items were deemed to be too negative (or even illegal) by the main sponsoring 
organization and thus the benefits of the additional information obtained were 
outweighed by the potential for offending participants.  The third item was not relevant as 
the majority of employees were exempt (under the Fair Labor Standards Act), salaried 
and thus not eligible for overtime.  The removal of these three items is probably not 
problematic as Lee and Allen (2002) had to drop these items from their analyses anyway.  
Over 90 percent of their respondents indicated that they had never engaged in these 
activities.  As mentioned previously, the workplace deviance scales were only included 
for the government organization and the internet communications company, based on 
constraints imposed by the large insurance organization.   

70 


The emotion regulation scale was derived from items used by Mayer and Stevens 

Emotion Regulation 
 
(1994) and Kokkonen and Pulkkinen (1999).  The wording of the items was changed 
slightly for incorporation into the present study.  Each item was changed to tap into an 
individual’s overall propensity to regulate their negative emotions, versus an indication of 
whether they regulated their emotions after a particular event.  Thus, in my study, the 
measure of emotion regulation used is more of a personality measure as individuals are 
making one overall rating for each item and not making ratings for each dimension of 
their psychological contract that was breached.  The reliability for this scale in the present 
study was .83.  This scale was not present on the pilot surveys administered to the large 
government organization. 
Single-Item Measures 

Along with the scales used to tap into the key constructs for this study, several 

single-item measures were included.  These items were concerned with the length of time 
between the occurrence of a psychological contract breach and survey completion, 
whether the employee felt that the organization was aware of the breach of their 
psychological contract, the extent to which the employee felt that the breach was still 
present (i.e., had not been satisfactorily remedied), the extent to which the organization 
had made attempts to remedy the breach and the extent to which the employee felt that 
their organization was undergoing major changes.  Each of these single items was 
included based on the belief that they could influence the size of the relationships 
between several key variables in the study.

CHAPTER 3: RESULTS 

 

General Results Information 

Prevalence and Dimensions of Psychological Contract Breach 
In the present study, 58 percent of the survey respondents indicated that at least 
 
one dimension of their psychological contract had been breached.  This percentage was 
calculated using the methods of Turnley et al. (2002) and is comparable to the prevalence 
of contract breach found in several prior studies (see Table 2).  When looking at the 
percentage of respondents whose overall scale scores for the dimensional measure of 
breach were in the “received slightly less than promised” or “received much less than 
promised” categories, the percentage is lower (30.3%).  This percentage is similar, 
however, to the one that was calculated in the same manner by Turnley and Feldman 
(1998).  The disparity between the 58% and 30% comes from the fact that respondents 
could indicate receiving less than promised for one item on a specific breach dimension, 
but indicate that they had received more than promised on the other item(s).  In this case, 
receiving less than promised on the one item would count as a breach of contract for that 
item when using the Turnley et al. (2002) calculation, but the overall scale score would 
indicate that, on average, no breach had occurred (using the Turnley & Feldman, 1998 
calculation).  Yet another way of looking at the degree of breach present in the current 
sample is to examine the mean for the overall dimensional breach measure.  Table 8 

72 


presents this mean and indicates that, on average, employees reported receiving about the 
same as what was promised or slightly more than what was promised.   

For the global breach scale, only 34 percent of employees indicated that their 

organization had failed to fulfill the promises that were made to them.  This percentage 
represents any individuals whose average response for the scale fell into one of the three 
“agree” points on the scale.  This percentage is lower than what has typically been 
reported for global measures of contract breach, but is very similar to the dimensional 
breach prevalence in the present study, when calculated using Turnley and Feldman’s 
(1998) method.     
 
As the present study was concerned not just with the overall measures of breach, 
but with the six specific dimensions as well, it makes sense to explore the prevalence of 
each of them separately.  The percentage of employees indicating that they had received 
less than what was promised, or much less than what was promised, was computed based 
on the mean scale scores for each breach dimension.  These results can be found in Table 
8.  Employees felt that they most frequently received much less or less than promised for 
Pay (25.4%) then the Employment Relationship (22.3%), then Resource Support 
(19.3%), Advancement (19.0%), Benefits (17.9%), and finally The Work Itself (7.5%).  
When computing these percentages again, this time using the Turnley et al. (2002) 
method, they are 27.4 percent for Pay, 26 percent for the Employment Relationship, 21 
percent for Advancement, 19.6 percent for Resource Support, 19 percent for Benefits and 
11 percent for The Work Itself.  As with the overall measures of breach, additional 
information can be obtained for the specific breach elements by examining their means.  
Means for five of the six dimensions indicate that employees felt their organizations had 

73 


In the present study, even though more than half of the sample experienced a 

generally upheld their side of the contract.  Pay is the only dimension identified in Table 
8 that indicates a psychological contract breach, and its magnitude is very small (.05).  
This pattern of means is similar to that obtained by Lester et al. (2002).   
Prevalence of Contract Violation and Other Outcomes 
 
breach of at least one dimension of their psychological contract, the frequency of 
endorsement of the major negative outcomes (i.e., violation, negative emotions, cynicism, 
WDIs, WDOs) was relatively low.  As seen in Table 8, only 21.1 percent of employees 
expressed agreement with the contract violation items and only 16.3 percent expressed 
agreement with the negative emotion items.  Over 87 percent of employees expressed 
agreement with the positive emotion items, 53.5 percent engaged in OCBOs on a weekly 
or daily basis, and 62.1 percent engaged in OCBIs on a weekly or daily basis.  In 
addition, most employees either never engaged in WDOs (81.1%) or WDIs (90.6%), or 
engaged in them no more than once per year.  The only negative outcome variable that 
employees endorsed more frequently was cynicism, with over 39 percent of employees 
indicating some form of agreement with these items.  Thus, even though many of the 
correlations described in future sections are significant, and strong relationships between 
several variables will be reported, we must keep in mind that the majority of employees 
are neither feeling strong negative emotions nor engaging in negative behaviors with high 
frequency.  This is similar to what Lester et al. (2002) found in their sample of 
supervisors and subordinates.  By saying this, my intent is not to minimize the 
importance of conducting research on psychological contracts, but to explain that there 
are many individuals within organizations, even in today’s weakened economy, who look 

74 


upon their employment relationship in a positive light.  Thus, any interventions targeted 
at remedying breaches will not apply equally well across individuals within the 
organization.        

Results for Factor Analyses of Major Variables 

Causal, Responsibility and Blame Attributions 

In order to make sure that a three factor attribution model makes more sense than 

either a single “attributions” factor or a dual factor model, I used CEFATOOL® to 
conduct an exploratory factor analysis with a target rotation indicating the theoretical 
framework containing three separate factors.  The target rotation attempts to discover the 
three factors that I indicated—casual, responsibility and blame attributions.  The results 
of this analysis revealed a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of .048.  
According to the criteria proposed by Browne and Cudeck (1993), an RMSEA of less 
than .05 indicates good fit, an RMSEA of .05-.08 indicates reasonable fit, an RMSEA of 
.08-.10 indicates mediocre fit and an RMSEA above .10 indicates unacceptable fit.  Thus, 
the point estimate of the RMSEA in this case indicates good fit for the three-factor 
solution.  When we explore the 90 percent confidence interval around this estimate, 
however, we find that it ranges from 0.00 to .106, which is a range from perfect fit to 
unacceptable fit.  Therefore it is difficult to determine, based on this estimate alone, 
whether a three-factor model fits the data well, as the estimate is somewhat unstable.   
When looking at the rotated factor matrix in Table 9, we find that some of the 
factor loadings support the hypothesized three-factor model, although there are several 
exceptions.  In the first column, the first three rows should be indicators of the causal 
attributions factor, however the factor loading for the first item is very small and the 

75 


factor loading for the second item is only moderate.  A similar pattern exists for 
responsibility attributions, in which the third item in that scale has a small loading and the 
second item’s factor loading is moderate.  For blame attributions, the second item only 
loads moderately on this factor.  In addition to some weak loadings where we would 
expect strong ones, there are also higher magnitude loadings where we would expect 
them to be small.  The blame attributions factor provides the best examples of this as the 
first and sixth items each have loadings above .50.  The problem with this is that items 
one and six are supposed to reflect causal and responsibility attributions, respectively.      
There is reason to believe, from the marital satisfaction literature, that individuals 
are sometimes unable to make a distinction between responsibility and blame attributions.  
To explore this possibility, I conducted another exploratory factor analysis with a target 
rotation, this time in an attempt to fit a two-factor model (one causal factor and one 
combined responsibility/blame factor) to the data.  The factor loadings for this model can 
be found in Table 10.  The factor loadings are less interpretable than they were with the 
three-factor solution, as there are several high loadings on the causal attributions factor 
for items that were included in the study to measure responsibility or blame attributions.  
In addition, the RMSEA is .069, with a 90 percent confidence interval from .028 to .108, 
indicating reasonable fit.  Although this model appears to fit slightly worse than the 
three-factor model, the confidence intervals for the two models overlap, indicating no 
statistically significant difference between the models. 

Based on the results obtained for the three and two factor solutions, I chose to 
explore the possibility that a single attributions factor would account for the data best.  
The factor loadings for this single factor solution are reported in Table 11.  Although 

76 


Although not related to any theoretical viewpoint, I also looked at a four-factor 

there are several loadings above .70, the loadings for the first three items are near .50, 
indicating that they don’t load as strongly on the combined attributions factor.  Although 
this model is the most parsimonious, the RMSEA was .112 with a 90 percent confidence 
interval from .085 to .141.  The point estimate falls in the poor fit range and the 
confidence interval’s lower limit represents mediocre fit while the upper limit represents 
unacceptable fit.  Based on these results, it appears that this model fits worse than either a 
two or three-factor model.  However, once again, the confidence intervals overlap, 
indicating no statistically significant difference between this model and the others.    
 
model to determine how well it would fit the data and whether it would generate an 
interpretable pattern of loadings.  The point estimate of the RMSEA for this model was 
0.00, however the 90 percent confidence interval ranged from 0.00 to .117, indicating that 
even with the addition of another factor, this model does not account for the data any 
better than the other models.   
 
advocate the use of the Expected Cross Validation Index (ECVI), especially with smaller 
sample sizes, to determine which model will generalize best to the population.  Table 12 
reports the number of parameters, degrees of freedom, RMSEA point estimate, RMSEA 
90 percent confidence interval, ECVI, and ECVI confidence interval for the one, two, 
three and four factor models.  The model with the lowest ECVI is expected to generalize 
best to the population, and for models represented in Table 12, the lowest ECVI is .334, 
which corresponds to a three-factor solution.  As the point estimate for the RMSEA also 

When trying to determine the number of factors, Browne and Cudeck (1993) 

77 


indicates good fit for a three-factor solution, and this solution has a theoretical basis in 
the literature, a three-factor solution is preferred.   
 
Although the information from the exploratory factor analysis provided some 
support for a three-factor solution, even stronger support would be provided with a 
confirmatory factor analysis.  Thus, the next step was to conduct a confirmatory factor 
analysis using RAMONA.  This is a more robust test of the three-factor solution in that 
the factor loadings that, based on theory, should be close to zero are actually specified to 
be zero.  The other factor loadings are left as free parameters to be estimated by the 
program (See Table 13).  Unfortunately, the RMSEA for the confirmatory factor analysis 
was .121, with a 90 percent confidence interval from .092 to .152, indicating poor fit.  
Similar RMSEAs and confidence intervals were found for two factor and single factor 
models, thus making it difficult to make a clear decision on the number of factors actually 
present.  As the three-factor model fit best in the exploratory analyses and fit no worse in 
the confirmatory factor analyses, I believe the three-factor solution provides the best 
overall indication of the attributions present in the current study.   
Psychological Contract Breach and Violation 
 
breach measure and psychological contract violation in order to determine whether the 
two-factor structure reported by Robinson and Morrison (2000) could be replicated.  The 
first factor analysis included a target rotation in which the hypothesized two-factor 
solution was entered as the target.  The results of this factor analysis indicated that the 
two-factor solution had reasonable fit, with an RMSEA of .065 and a 90 percent 
confidence interval from .042 (good fit) to .089 (mediocre fit).  A single factor structure 

Exploratory factor analyses were performed for the global psychological contract 

78 


was explored next, revealing an RMSEA of .245 with a 90 percent confidence interval 
from .228 to .262.  Based on the fact that the confidence intervals for the one and two 
factor solutions have no overlap, the two-factor solution fits the data significantly better 
than the one factor solution.  In addition, when fitting a three-factor model to the data, the 
third factor appears to be a unique factor, with a strong loading on only one manifest 
variable.  An examination of the eigenvalues on a scree plot indicates a leveling off of the 
eigenvalues after the second factor (see Figure 8).  Although some researchers would 
only retain factor 1 because it has the only eigenvalue greater than one, I feel that, based 
on the scree plot, and the fact that the eigenvalue of the second factor is .92, it makes 
more sense to include this factor.  This information, combined with the interpretability of 
the factors seen in Table 14, provides support for a two-factor solution. 
 
As with the attribution variables, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed for 
the global psychological contract breach and contract violation variables, as it represents 
a more robust test of the 2-factor solution.  The RAMONA model for this analysis can be 
found in Figure 10.  The 2-factor solution did provide a significantly better fit to the data 
(RMSEA = .152; 90% CI from .134 to .170) than a single factor solution (RMSEA = 
.245; 90% CI from .228 to .262), based on non-overlapping 90 percent confidence 
intervals for the 2 RMSEA point estimates.  However, the RMSEA for the two-factor 
solution was still in a range that would be considered poor fit.  A three-factor solution 
was not explored because of a lack of theoretical rationale for greater than two factors, 
thus making it impossible to specify a three-factor solution to be tested via confirmatory 
factor analysis. 

79 


An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine whether Lee and 

OCBIs and OCBOs 
 
Allen’s (2002) two-factor representation for OCBIs and OCBOs would be supported in 
the present study.  The results of this analysis revealed that the two-factor solution only 
had mediocre fit (RMSEA = .095; 90% CI from .084 to .105), although many of the 
factor loadings are of a magnitude that would be expected for the two-factor model (See 
Table 15).  In addition to the mediocre fit of the two-factor solution, the eigenvalues 
suggested the possibility that three or even four factors might be present.  The first four 
eigenvalues were 6.7, 1.3, 1.1 and .94.  Some researchers advocate keeping factors with 
eigenvalues greater than 1.0.  In this case, that would represent a three-factor solution.  
As the fourth eigenvalue is close to one, a four factor solution should not be ignored.  Use 
of a scree plot of the eigenvalues in this case does not clarify the number of factors to be 
retained as the drop off between eigenvalues (after the first) is very small (see Figure 9).  
Likewise, comparison of fit measures (RMSEAs) across the one, two, three and four 
factor models does not clearly identify which model is best, as all of the RMSEAs fall 
within the mediocre fit range.     
WDIs and WDOs 

Due to the small number of participants who responded to the workplace deviance 

items, no factor analysis was conducted, as the results would be highly unstable. 

Results for Hypotheses Related to the Entailment Model 

This section will present the results that relate to the entailment attributions 

 
model, and the next section will present the results dealing with the relationship between 
psychological contract breach, psychological contract violation and employee attitudes 

80 


and behaviors.  A summary of the results for each of the main hypotheses can be found in 
Table 16. 
Hypothesis #1 

Causal attributions, responsibility attributions and blame 
attributions will be positively intercorrelated. 

Hypothesis 1 predicted positive correlations between causal, responsibility, and 

blame attributions.  As the only individuals who made attributions were those who 
indicated at least one breach of an element of their psychological contract, the effective 
sample size for these analyses was 208, not the full sample of 358.  Causal and 
responsibility attributions were correlated at .632 (p<.01), causal and blame attributions 
were correlated at .619 (p<.01), and responsibility and blame attributions were correlated 
at .784 (p<.01).  Thus, Hypothesis 1 received support.  These correlations, along with the 
correlation matrix for the other major variables in this study, may be found in Table 17.   
Hypothesis #2 

The correlation between causal and blame attributions will be 
smaller than either the correlation between responsibility and 
blame attributions or the correlation between causal and 
responsibility attributions. 

As indicated above, the observed correlation in the sample between causal and 
 
blame attributions (r=.619) was smaller than the correlation between responsibility and 
blame attributions (r=.784) or the correlation between causal and responsibility 
attributions (r=.632).  When making inferences about the difference between these 
correlations in the population, we find that the correlation between causal and blame 
attributions is smaller than the correlation between responsibility and blame attributions 
(p<.05; 95% confidence interval around the difference from .11 to .22).  However, the 

81 


correlation between causal and blame attributions was not smaller than the correlation 
between causal and responsibility attributions (p>.05; 95% confidence interval from -.03 
to .05)  

The pattern of relationships is in the right direction, although the magnitude of 

only one of the two correlation differences was great enough to reach statistical 
significance.  It thus makes sense to explore the remaining hypotheses below as they will 
shed more light on the relationships between these attribution variables. 
Hypothesis #3 

The correlation between blame attributions and psychological 
contract violation will be stronger than the correlation between 
either causal attributions and psychological contract violation or 
responsibility attributions and psychological contract violation. 
 
The correlation between blame attributions and psychological contract violation 
was .574, the correlation between responsibility attributions and psychological contract 
violation was .603 and the correlation between causal attributions and psychological 
contract violation was .614.  The pattern of these correlations is directly opposite what 
was predicted in hypothesis 3, thus, even without significance testing this hypothesis is 
not supported.  Statistical significance tests indicate that the three correlations are not 
different from one another at an alpha of .05. 
Hypothesis #4 

Causal, responsibility and blame attributions will each separately 
explain a significant amount of variance in psychological contract 
violation. 

Before testing any hypotheses dealing with hierarchical linear regression, it is 
 
important to understand and test the assumptions underlying the use of this statistical 

82 


method.  These assumptions include normality of errors, linearity of the relationship 
between variables and homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance).  In order to feel more 
confident about interpreting the confidence intervals and significance tests derived from 
the hierarchical regressions described below, several diagnostic tests were performed.  
Although these tests were performed for all regression equations examined below, the 
results are very similar, thus only the diagnostics for the equation in which causal 
attributions predict contract violation will be presented, for illustration purposes.  First, to 
examine the normality of errors assumption, I created a cumulative distribution P-P plot 
in which expected residuals are plotted on the Y axis and observed residuals are plotted 
on the X axis (See Figure 7).  Because the scatterplot wavers above and below the 
diagonal line (instead of concentrating on one side of the line) the normality of errors 
assumption appears to hold.  I next looked at the scatterplot of residuals (on the Y axis) 
by predicted values or estimates (on the X axis).  Based on the scatterplot in Figure 8, the 
data do appear to be linear, however a close examination of this graph reveals that the 
homogeneity of variance assumption may not be met.  Instead of having a uniform scatter 
of points above and below the horizontal line, the points appear to be slightly more 
concentrated near the line for lower values of the estimate and more disperse around the 
line for higher values of the estimate.  As heteroscedasticity can influence the confidence 
intervals and significance tests, I performed a variance stabilizing transformation and 
created a new variable by taking the square root of psychological contract violation.  I 
then ran the regression again, with the stabilized psychological contract violation variable 
as the dependent variable.  The results for this regression were very similar to those 
reported above, thus the violation of the homoscedasticity assumption is very minor.  

83 


Because of the small effect on the regression results, and the difficulty of interpretation 
caused by such a transformation of the dependent variable, all remaining analyses will be 
reported without such a transformation.   

In addition to testing the above assumptions, it is also necessary to examine 
outliers and influential data points.  Outliers can be identified by looking at the same 
graph used to determine whether the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions were 
met.  Another way to explore outliers is to look for studentized residuals with a 
magnitude of three or greater.  An examination of the graph does not indicate the 
presence of any outliers.  Similarly, an examination of the studentized residuals indicates 
that none are of a magnitude of three or greater.  Finally, it is important to check for 
influential data points using Cook’s Distance and leverage scores, as data points with 
scores above one for Cook’s Distance or leverage can actually change the results of 
significance tests for the beta weights in the regression model.  For the regression of 
psychological contract violation on causal attributions, no data points were unduly 
influential (See Figure 9).   

Hypothesis 4 was tested with several hierarchical linear regressions.  To 

determine whether causal attributions would explain variance in contract violation, the 
major demographic control variables of age, gender, management level, tenure in current 
position and tenure in current organization were entered into the equation first.  These 
variables explained 6 percent of the variance in contract violation, although the only 
significant beta weight was for tenure in current position (β=.176, p<.05).  When adding 
causal attributions to the equation, almost 38 percent of the variance in contract violation 
was accounted for, mostly due to the significant beta weight for causal attributions 

84 


(β=.608, p<.05).  To determine the separate effects of responsibility attributions on 
contract violation, I entered responsibility attributions into the equation containing just 
the control variables.  This regression equation accounted for 38 percent of the variance 
in contract violation, with a significant beta weight for responsibility (β=.600, p<.05).  
Finally, to determine the independent effects of blame attributions on contract violation, I 
entered blame attributions into an equation containing only the control variables.  This 
equation explained almost 34 percent of the variance in psychological contract violation, 
with a significant beta weight for blame attributions (β=.561, p<.05).   
 
explain variance in psychological contract violation.  Obviously, since the three 
attribution types are strongly correlated with one another, we need to determine not just 
their independent effects, but their combined effects on psychological contract violation. 
Hypothesis #5 
After accounting for the variance explained by causal attributions 
in the prediction of psychological contract violation, responsibility 
attributions will explain additional variance. 

Hypothesis 4 was supported in that each attribution was able to independently 

 
To test hypothesis 5, I added responsibility attributions to the regression equation 
that already contained all of the demographic control variables and causal attributions.  
Responsibility attributions did explain additional variance in psychological contract 
violation, with a beta weight of .373 (p<.05).  As indicated in Table 18, the amount of 
variance accounted for (R2) increased from .378 in the equation containing casual 
attributions to .460 in the equation containing both causal and responsibility attributions, 
thus supporting hypothesis 5.   

85 


Hypothesis #6 

After accounting for the variance explained by causal and 
responsibility attributions in the prediction of psychological 
contract violation, blame attributions will explain additional 
variance in this relationship. 

Hierarchical linear regression was again used to test Hypothesis 6, and the results 

 
are presented in Table 18.  Blame attributions were added to the equation that already 
contained demographics, causal attributions and responsibility attributions.  In contrast to 
what was predicted by hypothesis 6, the beta weight for blame attributions was non-
significant (β=.132, p>.05) as was the change in R2 from .460 to .466.    
Hypothesis #7 

An entailment model of causal, responsibility and blame 
attributions in which causal attributions lead to responsibility 
attributions, which lead to blame attributions, which lead to 
psychological contract violation, will fit the data well.   

 
To test hypothesis 7, I fit the proposed entailment model to the data using the 
RAMONA software that is part of the SYSTAT statistical package.  The entailment 
model represented the hypothesized causal relationships between causal attributions, 
responsibility attributions, blame attributions and psychological contract violation (see 
Figure 3).  The RMSEA for this model was .087, which indicated mediocre fit to the data.  
The 90 percent confidence interval around the RMSEA ranged from .069 (reasonable fit) 
to .098 (mediocre fit).  In addition to determining whether the overall model fits well, or 
poorly, it is important to examine each of the parameters estimated within the model, to 
make sure that the results make sense in relation to existing theory.  The entailment 
model is basically a factor analysis model that also includes directional paths (instead of 

86 


correlations) among the four latent variables.  In order for the factor analysis portion of 
the model to be supported, large parameter estimates would be expected for the paths 
from each latent factor to its indicators.  For causal attributions, the parameter values 
were .551 (90% CI from .455 to .646), .583 (90% CI from .490 to .676) and .598 (90% CI 
from .507 to .690).  For responsibility attributions, the parameter values were .815 (90% 
CI from .769 to .862), .790 (90% CI from .739 to .840) and .698 (90% CI from .632 to 
.764).  For blame attributions, the parameter estimates were .769 (90% CI from .715 to 
.824) and .758 (90% CI from .702 to .815).  For psychological contract violation, the 
corresponding parameters were .805 (90% CI from .760 to .851), .919 (90% CI from .892 
to .945), .853 (90% CI from .816 to .890) and .864 (90% CI from .829 to .899).  It is 
interesting to note that the parameter estimates for causal attributions are lower than what 
we would expect to find if there was strong support for a unidimensional causal 
attributions factor.  This finding is not surprising, given the low reliability of the causal 
attributions scale alluded to in a previous section.  The other three latent variables have 
relatively strong loadings on each of their corresponding scale items, with the strongest 
relationships appearing for contract violation.   

When examining the directional paths in the model, we find that causal 

attributions have a strong influence on responsibility attributions (β=.939, 90% CI from 
.859 to 1).  The path from responsibility attributions to blame attributions is more 
difficult to interpret as it was estimated to be 1.00, which is on its boundary.  The path 
from blame attributions to contract violation was .718, with a 90 percent confidence 
interval from .651 to .785.  Each of these paths is indicative of support for the entailment 
model in that causal attributions have a strong effect on responsibility attributions, which 

87 


have a strong effect on blame attributions, which have a strong effect on psychological 
contract violation.  The corresponding error variances for the major paths among latent 
variables in the model indicate that only 12 percent of the variance in responsibility 
attributions is unaccounted for by causal attributions, none of the variance in blame 
attributions is unaccounted for by responsibility attributions (note that this parameter 
estimate is on its boundary), and 48 percent of the variance in psychological contract 
violation is unaccounted for by blame attributions.    

Results for Hypotheses Related to the Relationship Between Breach,  

Hypothesis #8 

Violation and Outcomes 

When aspects of the psychological contract that are deemed more 
important by an employee are breached, the employees will be 
more likely to experience psychological contract violation.  In 
other words, a multiplicative combination of breaches and their 
importance ratings will be positively correlated with psychological 
contract violation. 

To test this hypothesis, I formed a variable by multiplying each dimension of 

 
psychological contract breach by its corresponding importance rating and then averaging 
these ratings across all six breach dimensions.  The correlation between this breach x 
importance variable and contract violation was found to be .494.  Hypothesis 8 was 
supported in that the breach x importance variable did predict psychological contract 
violation.  In a supplemental analysis, I performed a hierarchical regression to determine 
whether the breach x importance variable would account for additional variance in 
psychological contract violation beyond that accounted for by the dimensional breach 

88 


measure.  The breach x importance variable was added to an equation predicting 
psychological contract violation from the dimensional breach measure.  This regression 
revealed only a non-significant one percent increase in R-squared with the addition of the 
breach x importance variable, along with a non-significant beta weight (β=-.248, p>.05).   
Hypothesis #9 

The strength of the relationship between psychological contract 
breach and psychological contract violation will be moderated by 
the individual’s emotion regulation ability. 

To test hypothesis 9, a series of hierarchical regressions were performed.  In order 
 
to decrease any potential problems with multicollinearity of the interaction term with the 
two variables it was created from, the independent variables were first centered around 
their means.  The interaction term was then calculated from these centered variables.  The 
linear transformation of these variables has no impact on the strength of the relationship 
between the interaction term and the dependent variable in the equation (Cohen & Cohen, 
1983).  In the first regression equation, all control variables were entered.  Breach 
(centered) was entered next and was found to predict contract violation (β=.767, p<.01).  
Emotion regulation (centered) was entered next, and did not explain additional variance 
in contract violation (β=.004, p>.05).  Finally, the breach x emotion regulation product 
term was entered, but did not explain any additional variance in psychological contract 
violation (β=-.025, p>.05).  In order for emotion regulation to moderate the 
breach!violation relationship, the regression equation that included the interaction term 
should have explained additional variance in psychological contract violation.  Therefore, 
emotion regulation does not act as a moderator, in contrast to what was predicted in 
hypothesis 9.  This means that individuals with higher emotion regulation abilities are 

89 


just as likely to feel the negative effects of psychological contract violation as individuals 
who do not possess these emotion regulation abilities. 
Hypothesis #10 

Psychological contract violation will be positively correlated with  
organizational cynicism. 

As indicated in the correlation table (Table 17), the correlation between 

 
psychological contract violation and organizational cynicism was .83 (p<.01), indicating 
a very strong relationship between these 2 variables, and thus supporting hypothesis 10.   
Hypothesis #11 
Psychological contract violation will be negatively correlated with 
organizational citizenship behaviors. 

The correlation between psychological contract violation and OCBOs was -.20 

 
(p<.01) and the correlation between psychological contract violation and OCBIs was -.08 
(p>.05).  Although both correlations were in the expected direction, only the correlation 
for OCBOs reached statistical significance, thus providing only partial support for 
hypothesis 11.  These results indicate that individuals experiencing the negative emotions 
associated with psychological contract violation are less likely to engage in citizenship 
behaviors that have a positive effect on the organization.  The lack of a significant 
relationship between psychological contract violation and OCBIs makes sense given that 
the target of violation in the present study was the organization, not the individuals within 
the organization.   
Hypothesis #12 

Psychological contract violation will be more strongly negatively 
correlated with organizational citizenship behaviors directed at the 
organization than organizational citizenship behaviors directed at 
individuals within the organization. 

90 


In order to test hypothesis 12, I examined the difference between the 2 

 
correlations reported in hypothesis 11.  This difference of .12 was significant (p<.05; 
95% CI from .04 to .20), thus supporting hypothesis 12.  It makes sense that individuals 
are able to decrease their contribution to the organization, but not their willingness to 
help other individuals within the organization, in response to the negative emotions they 
feel towards the organization.   
Hypothesis #13 

Psychological contract violation will be positively correlated with 
workplace deviance behaviors 

In support of hypothesis 13, contract violation was found to be positively 

 
correlated with both WDIs (r=.317, p<.05) and WDOs (r=.319, p<.05).  When feeling 
negative emotions associated with psychological contract violation, employees are more 
likely to engage in deviant workplace behaviors directed at either the organization itself 
or individuals within the organization. 
Hypothesis #14  

Psychological contract violation will be more strongly positively 
correlated with workplace deviance behaviors directed at the 
organization than with workplace deviance behaviors directed at 
individuals within the organization 

 
No support was found for hypothesis 14, as the magnitude of the correlation 
between WDOs and psychological contract violation was virtually identical to the 
magnitude of the correlation between WDIs and psychological contract violation.  The 
difference between the two correlations was only .002, which was not significantly 
different from zero (p>.05).  This finding is in contrast to the finding for OCBOs and 

91 


OCBIs, in which employees were able to differentiate between the organizational and 
individual targets.  
Hypothesis #15  

The correlations between psychological contract violation and 
organizational citizenship behaviors, workplace deviance 
behaviors, and organizational cynicism will be stronger than the 
correlations between psychological contract breach and these same 
variables. 

Table 19 reports a comparison of the correlations between psychological contract 

 
violation, global psychological contract breach, dimensional psychological contract 
breach, OCBIs, OCBOs, WDIs, WDOs, and Organizational Cynicism.  The magnitude of 
each of the sample correlations is greater for psychological contract violation than for 
either of the psychological contract breach measures.  A comparison of the correlations 
for psychological contract violation and global psychological contract breach reveals 
significant differences for WDIs (d=.18, p<.05) and cynicism (d=.15, p<.01), but not for 
OCBOs (d=-.04, p>.05), OCBIs (d=-.01, p>.05) or WDOs (d=.10, p>.05).  Similar 
comparisons of the correlations for psychological contract violation and the dimensional 
psychological contract breach measure identify significant differences for WDIs (d=.41, 
p<.01), cynicism (d=.43, p<.01) and OCBOs (d=-.11, p<.05), but not for OCBIs (d=-.02, 
p>.05) or WDOs (d=.08, p>.05).  Based on this information, hypothesis 15 was mostly 
supported.  Psychological contract violation had a stronger relationship with workplace 
deviance behaviors directed at the organization, organizational cynicism and OCBOs 
than at least one form of contract breach.  The differences for OCBIs and WDOs were in 

92 


As hypothesis 15 is concerned with the usefulness of considering the affect-laden 

the right direction, but did not reach a high enough magnitude to achieve statistical 
significance.     
 
construct of psychological contract violation, in addition to the cognitive construct of 
psychological contract breach, it makes sense to explore the degree to which 
psychological contract violation explains additional variance in the outcome variables 
(WDIs, WDOs, OCBIs, OCBOs, and cynicism) beyond that explained by psychological 
contract breach.  This type of analysis is even more important in the current situation due 
to the strong correlations between psychological contract violation and both global and 
dimensional psychological contract breach.  To provide further support for considering 
psychological contract violation as the proximal influence on the major outcome 
variables (and a mediator of the breach!outcome relationships), I performed several 
hierarchical regressions.  In order for psychological contract violation to be considered a 
mediator, we would expect a significant beta weight for the relationship between 
psychological contract breach and psychological contract violation, a significant beta 
weight for the relationship between psychological contract violation and the outcome in 
question (e.g., OCBI, OCBO, WDI, WDO, cynicism), and a non-significant (or at least 
small in magnitude) beta weight for the direct relationship between psychological 
contract breach and the outcome in question. 

The first set of hierarchical regressions examined the additional variance 

accounted for by psychological contract violation beyond that accounted for by global 
psychological contract breach.  Separate regressions were run for each outcome variable 
mentioned above.  The second set of hierarchical regressions examined the additional 

93 


To examine the influence of global psychological contract breach and 

variance accounted for by psychological contract violation above and beyond that 
accounted for by dimensional psychological contract breach.    
Global contract breach and contract violation 
 
psychological contract violation on OCBOs, the control variables of age, gender, 
management position, tenure in current position and tenure with current organization 
were entered first into the equation.  When global psychological contract breach was 
added to the equation, it accounted for additional variance in OCBOs (β=-.144, p<.05).  
Then, when psychological contract violation was added to the equation that included the 
control variables and global breach, the beta weight for breach became non-significant 
(β=-.033, p>.05) and the beta weight for psychological contract violation was marginally 
significant (β=-.145, p<.10), indicating that psychological contract violation was able to 
add to the prediction of OCBOs (albeit to a small degree).   

The same type of regression analysis was then conducted for OCBIs.  For the 
equation containing the control variables and psychological contract breach, the beta 
weight for breach was -.045 (p>.05).  When psychological contract violation was added 
to the equation, the beta weight for breach remained non-significant and the beta weight 
for violation was also non-significant (β=-.089, p>.05).  Thus, neither psychological 
contract breach nor psychological contract violation was able to explain a significant 
amount of the variance in OCBIs. 

For WDOs, adding breach to the equation consisting of control variables did 

account for a marginally significant amount of the variance in WDOs (β=.277, p<.10).  
Adding psychological contract violation to this equation resulted in a non-significant beta 

94 


For organizational cynicism, global psychological contract breach did explain 

weight for psychological contract breach (β=.088, p>.10), however the addition of 
psychological contract violation did not explain a significant amount of additional 
variance (β=.289, p>.10) in WDOs, despite the relatively high magnitude of the beta 
weight.  Recall that the analyses for the workplace deviance variables are only based on a 
sample of 53 individuals, thus power to detect actual differences is relatively low for the 
analyses incorporating these variables, even using an alpha level of .10. 
 
For WDIs, breach did not account for additional variance beyond that accounted 
for by the control variables (β=.153, p>.10).  When psychological contract violation was 
added to the equation, it was able to account for a marginally significant amount of the 
variance in WDIs (β=.380, p<.10).   
 
additional variance beyond that accounted for by the control variables (β=.658, p<.05).  
When psychological contract violation was added to this equation, it explained additional 
variance (β=.680, p<.05) and the beta weight for psychological contract breach was 
reduced (β=.136, p<.05), but still able to account for some of the variance in 
organizational cynicism.  Thus, although psychological contract breach was still a 
significant predictor of organizational cynicism, psychological contract violation did 
account for additional variance in cynicism beyond that accounted for by breach. 
 
The results of these regression equations are similar to the results for the 
differences between correlations described earlier.  The regressions indicate that 
psychological contract violation is able to explain additional variance beyond that 
explained by global psychological contract breach, and thus act as a mediator for 
OCBOs, WDIs, and organizational cynicism, but not for OCBIs or WDOs. 

95 


Dimensional contract breach and contract violation 
 
The same regression analyses reported above were also conducted for the 
dimensional contract breach measure, to see if there would be any differences.  
Psychological contract violation was able to explain additional variance beyond the 
dimensional psychological contract breach measure for OCBOs (β=-.125, p<.05), WDOs 
(β=.321, p<.05), WDIs (β=.348, p<.05) and organizational cynicism (β=.774, p<.05), but 
not for OCBIs (β=.007, p>.05).  This is a similar pattern to what was observed for the 
global psychological contract breach measure, except that some beta weights are a bit 
stronger here, and the beta weight for psychological contract violation in the prediction of 
WDOs has reached significance.   
 
psychological contract violation is able to explain additional variance in the major 
outcome variables beyond the variance explained by either the global or dimensional 
psychological contract breach measure.  Based on the above analyses, psychological 
contract violation either partially or fully mediated the relationship between at least one 
form of psychological contract breach and OCBOs, WDOs, WDIs and cynicism.    
Hypothesis #16 
Organizational cynicism will be positively correlated with 
workplace deviance behaviors 

In conclusion, there is a good deal of support for hypothesis 15, in that 

As seen in table 15, organizational cynicism was found to be positively correlated 

 
with both WDOs (r=.38, p<.01) and WDIs (r=.47, p<.01).  Thus, individuals who are 
more cynical about their organization are more likely to engage in deviance behaviors 
directed at either the organization or individuals within the organization.  It is interesting 
to note that the magnitude of the correlation is slightly higher for WDIs than WDOs, 

96 


which is in the opposite direction to what would be expected based on the fact that the 
organization is the target of cynicism measured in this study.  Although it would follow 
logically that cynical individuals would be more likely to direct their deviant behavior at 
the organization, the results indicate that cynical individuals are just as likely to direct 
their deviant behaviors at other individuals within the organization (d=.09, p>.05; 95% CI 
from -.22 to .40).   
Hypothesis #17 

Organizational cynicism will be negatively correlated with 
organizational citizenship behaviors 

 
Organizational cynicism was found to be negatively correlated with both OCBOs 
(r=-.31, p<.01) and OCBIs (r=-.16, p<.05).  The magnitude of the correlations is in the 
expected direction, based on the belief that individuals who are feeling cynical towards 
their organization would be less likely to perform extra behaviors that would benefit the 
organization.  Because the target of cynicism is organizational, not individual, cynical 
individuals would not be expected to allow their cynical feelings to affect their behaviors 
towards their individual colleagues to the same extent as their behaviors towards the 
organization as a whole.  The difference between the two correlations supports the belief 
that individuals who are cynical towards the organization are more likely to restrict their 
OCBs directed at the organization than their OCBs directed at individuals within the 
organization (d=-.15, p<.05, 95% CI from -.23 to -.07).   

Qualitative Data 

Along with the quantitative data used to test the main hypotheses of this study, I 

also gathered qualitative data.  These data were obtained from the comments box 

97 


provided on the survey itself, as well as from interviews with employees of the large 
insurance organization. 
Comments on Survey 
Over 100 of the 358 employees who responded to the survey wrote comments 
 
regarding the specific breach of their psychological contract that had the greatest effect 
on them.  Representative comments are provided in Table 20.  Ten of these comments 
specifically identified the Employment Relationship as the breach with the most impact, 
9 described Advancement Opportunities, 8 described Benefits, 7 implicated Pay, 4 
described breaches dealing with Resource Support and 10 described breaches that 
overlapped with two or more breach dimensions.  In order to illustrate the types of breach 
employees had experienced, I will describe one example of each breach dimension.   
One office manager in an agent’s office indicated a breach in her Employment 

Relationship when she was not told during the hiring process that her agency was a pilot 
program that would be transferred over to an independent agency within the next year.  
Based on this transfer to the independent agency, it was very possible that the office 
manager could lose her job.  It is interesting to note that this breach of contract reflects 
the withholding of information, which caused the individual to believe that their job was 
secure, rather than an overt promise that went unfulfilled.  The promise of long term 
employment was inferred by the office manager, and the insurance organization gave her 
no reason to doubt her inference.   

Regarding Advancement Opportunities, one claims employee indicated that, 
during his interview he was given the impression that he could move up into the fraud 
unit.  After being in the organization for a short time, he found out that he does not have 

98 


enough experience for that unit.  Since movement to that unit was a major selling point 
for accepting his current position with the organization, this employee was very 
disappointed to find out that the promised career path is unattainable.   
For the Benefits dimension of psychological contract breach, one employee chose 
 
his health plan based upon the doctors listed in the provider directory, because all of his 
family doctors were within the covered network.  The first time members of the family 
had to go to their respective doctors, they found out that the doctors were not in their plan 
after all.  After speaking with human resources about this, the employee learned that the 
health plan in question had been under investigation before being chosen by his 
employer.  This employee further went on to indicate that he blames his organization’s 
human resources department slightly for this because they had not looked deeper into 
their choice of providers and had distributed inaccurate information. 

For Pay, one employee from the large insurance organization reported switching 

from being a Casualty Claims Associate to a Property Claims Associate based on the 
advise of her hiring manager.  This manager indicated to her that he had more in his 
budget for raises for Property Claims Associates.  After switching functional areas, the 
employee’s raise after her next performance evaluation was the smallest one she had 
received during her tenure with the organization.     

For resource support, one insurance agent indicated that a change in technology 

did not live up to the promises that were made at the time when the organization was 
introducing and rolling out the new system.  After using the system a few times, the agent 
realized that it did not reward the long-term claim-free customer like it was supposed to.  
Not only did this system breach the agent’s psychological contract, but it also had the 

99 


potential to breach the psychological contract of policyholders, if the agent had already 
talked to them about the benefits of the new system (i.e., lower insurance premiums for 
people who had not filed claims).    

In addition to employees indicating breaches of individual dimensions of their 
psychological contract, several employees indicated breaches that overlapped several 
categories.  As the instructions asked employees to “describe in your own words, the 
organization’s breach of promise that has had the most impact on you (if any)”, it is 
interesting that several people wrote responses that crossed multiple categories.  Perhaps 
this is indicative of the fact that when employees perceive one breach, they are more 
likely to perceive others as well.  When looking back at the quantitative data for the 
present study, we find that 57 percent of the individuals reporting at least one breach 
actually reported multiple breaches.  Thus breaches of single dimensions of the 
psychological contract are less prevalent than multiple dimension breaches (at least in the 
present sample).  As an example of one of these multiple dimension breaches, an 
employee in the insurance organization felt that she was not receiving fair and 
competitive pay for her performance.  Although it wasn’t always the case, she recently 
began to feel that her organization was ignoring her time, effort and level of performance, 
along with her overall contribution to the organization.  She also indicated that the 
criteria for earning a promotion were not clear, and were different from the competency 
based promotion system that the organization purports to use.  Several feelings resulted 
from her breach perceptions, including frustration, anxiety, disrespect and inequity.      
 
reflect unmet expectations, and not necessarily breaches of some type of implicit or 

It is interesting to note that the comments written by some employees appeared to 

100 


explicit promise that was made to them by the organization.  It is difficult to tell whether 
this was, in fact, the case or whether it was more a reflection of the small amount of 
explanation that some individuals chose to provide in the comments box.  Either way, 
despite the fact that there is support for considering unmet expectations and 
psychological contract breach as distinct constructs (Turnley & Feldman, 2000), this 
distinction may not always be obvious to all employees completing the surveys.  Thus, 
qualitative information, like the information gathered in the present study, can help us to 
understand what employees are thinking about when responding to the survey items.  
Additional qualitative studies, potentially using a daily diary methodology similar to 
Conway and Briner (2002), one on one interviews or focus groups will provide additional 
insight into psychological contract breach, including the attribution process and the types 
of emotions experienced by these employees.   
Interviews 

Additional comments were provided by a member of the claims staff and an 

intern whose internship was not being extended.  These comments were provided in one 
on one interviews I had with each individual, thus I was able to obtain more information 
than what the typical survey respondent wrote in the comments box.  A summary of these 
comments can be found in the last two rows of Table 20. 
 
In addition to these interviews with employees of the training department within 
the large insurance organization, I was also able to interview the Officer in charge of the 
training department to get his perspective regarding elements of the psychological 
contract that employees would feel had been breached.  We also discussed the results of 
the most recent Leadership Effectiveness Survey (described in the next section), 

101 


The Officer also mentioned that because individuals in his training department 

including how he thought the results were related to contract breach.  At the start of our 
conversation, the Officer indicated that he thought several contracts existed for 
employees in his training department.  He felt that employees perceive contracts with the 
overall company itself, the department within the large insurance organization, their 
immediate supervisors, and with the team leads they work with on day-to-day projects.  
His thought was that the contracts with the organization would be the most stable, and the 
contracts with team leads would be the most likely to fluctuate over time.   
 
varied in terms of age, personality, schooling, past experiences and other characteristics, 
no single contract would represent everyone well.  There would be clusters of varying 
interests within the organization that would lead to the development of different 
psychological contracts.  He also mentioned that there isn’t really one set contract that is 
made with each employee as they enter the organization, although they all do go through 
a similar orientation process and learn to expect certain things from the training 
department that may be different from (and often are different from) other places they 
have worked before (either within or outside of the large insurance organization).   
The Officer explained that one of the goals of the training organization was to 
 
make individuals more marketable for when they leave for other positions within or 
outside of the insurance organization.  However, during the conversation, this individual 
explained that he felt employees were responsible for asking their coach (supervisor/team 
lead) when they didn’t understand something.  He also felt that employees were 
responsible for seeking out information on their own versus having it communicated to 
them at a detailed level, and for guiding their own development.  He knows that 

102 


individuals have previously expressed concern about not being placed on projects that 
fulfill their developmental needs.  Although he values the development of each 
individual, he feels that it is not always possible to get people the types of projects they 
would prefer, as all projects that come into the organization need to be staffed.   
 
Towards the end of this interview, the Officer mentioned that one of the 
challenges his organization faces is that the employees within the organization seem to 
break down into two main groups.  The first group consists of disgruntled team members 
who do not understand what is going on or why, and may have unrealistic expectations 
regarding how things should be run.  The second group consists of happy employees who 
understand what is going on and the reasons why the organization does things the way it 
does.   
 
It is interesting to note that there are some disconnects between the beliefs of the 
head of the training organization and the individual employees, as indicated by scores on 
the Leadership Effectiveness Survey described below.  One specific disconnect concerns 
the “disgruntled” team members.  The Officer knows about these individuals but is not 
making specific attempts to repair their psychological contracts, thus making it unlikely 
that their situation will improve. 
Relationship Between Contract Breach Survey Data and Other Existing Organizational 
Surveys at the Large Insurance Organization 
 
those being measured by other surveys in the large insurance organization.  
Representative results and comments from the surveys administered at the large 

The survey used in the present study contains some constructs that are similar to 

103 


insurance organization will be presented below, along with an indication of how the 
constructs measured on those surveys relate to the present study. 
 

Leadership effectiveness survey. 
The Leadership Effectiveness Survey has been used by the training and 

The 15 categories measured on the LES survey include Communication, 

development department within the large insurance organization for the past 7 years.  
Every 6 months, members of the department are asked to complete this survey to measure 
the health of the department and identify opportunities for improvement.  Although not 
specifically developed to assess psychological contract breach, the survey does contain 
categories that are similar to the 6 major categories of breach included in my study. 
 
Empowerment, Performance Management, Teamwork, Support, Personal Growth, Job 
Satisfaction, Diversity, Organizational Structure, Vision, Continuous Improvement 
Process, Customer Service, Rewards/Recognition, Performance Improvement Process, 
and Working Environment.  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a copy of this survey 
due to its proprietary nature. 
 
Advancement Opportunities breach category in the present study.  The 
Rewards/Recognition category on the LES corresponds to the Pay breach dimension; the 
Empowerment, Teamwork, Job Satisfaction, and Working Environment categories on the 
LES each tap into the same types of information present on the Work Itself breach 
dimension; the Support category on the LES contains an item similar to the two items 
included in the Resource Support breach dimension.  In addition, the Support and Job 
Satisfaction categories roughly correspond to the Good Employment Relationship 

The Personal Growth category on the LES survey roughly corresponds to the 

104 


Although the LES survey provided a quantitative indication of employee 

category.  There are no corresponding categories on the LES for the Benefits dimension 
included in my study. 
 
The lowest scoring categories on the last administration of the LES were Personal 
Growth, Performance Management, Rewards/Recognition and Communication.  Two of 
these dimensions, Personal Growth and Rewards/Recognition correspond roughly to 
breach dimensions on my survey that employees felt were breached.   
 
perspectives, two focus groups were convened to provide more detail regarding the 
specific issues of concern to employees.  The opinions within these focus groups were 
somewhat mixed, indicating the variety of elements that are part of each employee’s 
psychological contract.  On the whole, employees felt that there should be more 
communication from the organization’s Leadership Team, and more communication from 
their coaches regarding development opportunities, promotion decisions, and job 
opportunities.  It is interesting to note that several things employees are asking for are the 
same things that the Officer in charge of the organization feels they should be finding out 
for themselves. 

Employee engagement survey. 
Within the past 3 years, the large insurance organization began to administer an 

 
Employee Engagement Survey to a random sample of employees throughout the 
company.  For the present purposes, I will report the results for the Claims employees, as 
these individuals make up the majority of the insurance organization sample.  The 
Employee Engagement Survey contains items designed to measure many different 
dimensions of the employment relationship, and includes items tapping into each of the 

105 


The results for 2002 indicate that the lowest ratings were obtained for the Pay and 

dimensions on my survey.  It also contains items related to the performance of OCBs, 
intention to quit, and other constructs proposed to relate to employee engagement.  
Again, I am unable to include a copy of this survey due to its proprietary nature. 
 
Benefits categories.  Only 45 percent of employees felt that their most recent pay 
adjustment was based primarily on their performance and even fewer employees (37%) 
felt that they were paid fairly for the contributions they made to the organization.  Forty-
eight percent of employees felt that the benefits package provided to them met their 
needs.  Other low scoring categories included Advancement Opportunities (54%) and 
Resource Support (58%).  The Work Itself (66%) and A Good Employment Relationship 
(68%) were actually 2 of the higher scoring categories on the Employee Engagement 
Survey. 
 
psychological contract breaches to the data obtained from the organizational surveys, it 
does make sense that there is a good deal of overlap between them.  What would be really 
interesting would be to collect information regarding the extent to which each of the 
items on the employee engagement survey was promised to employees, and whether the 
dimensions of the psychological contract that were breached have a larger effect on 
employee satisfaction, engagement, OCBs, and other outcomes than individual survey 
items that had not been promised to employees.  An even more interesting question to 
explore is the possibility that including items on the employee engagement survey 
actually causes employees to interpret those items as promises, even if they had not 
previously done so.  In other words, does including an item that asks employees whether 

Although it is impossible to match the survey respondents’ data regarding 

106 


The qualitative data presented above were collected to supplement the 

they know what career opportunities are available to them imply that this information 
should have been provided by the organization all along?  If it hasn’t been provided in the 
past, should they interpret this item to mean that this is something that will be provided in

quantitative data on my survey, and to give life to some of the constructs measured on 
that survey.  Although I spent a lot of time describing the statistical relationships among 
variables and testing several hypotheses, this information has been enhanced greatly by a 
consideration of the context within which those data were collected and the insights into 
the minds of the respondents.  It is these insights, often in employees’ own words, not in 
the form of a theoretical construct, that are often missing when attention is paid solely to 
quantitative data and analyses.

CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION 

 

In this section, I will discuss the empirical results of the present study, including 
 
how they compare to prior results in the psychological contracts and marital satisfaction 
literatures, potential limitations of the current study, topics for future research, and 
organizational implications of the findings. 

 

Summary of Results 

The primary goal of the present study was to explain the development of feelings 
of psychological contract violation through the different types of attributions employees 
make for the breaches they perceive.  The entailment model, borrowed from the marital 
literature, was used as the framework for understanding the impact of causal, 
responsibility and blame attributions on psychological contract violation.  A secondary 
goal of this study was to explore the relationship between psychological contract 
violation, organizational cynicism, organizational citizenship behaviors and workplace 
deviance behaviors.  Because psychological contract violation is the more affect-laden 
construct, it was expected to have a stronger relationship with these outcomes than 
psychological contract breach.  Such a finding would provide support for movement 
away from the sole measurement of psychological contract breach toward the 
measurement of psychological contract violation.   
 

108 


The results indicated that, as expected, causal, responsibility and blame 

 
Attributions and Violation 
 
attributions each separately mediated the relationship between psychological contract 
breach and psychological contract violation.  The separate effects of each attribution are 
interesting, as they document the importance of considering the attributions employees 
make for breaches of their psychological contract.  Due to the fact that these 3 
attributions were strongly correlated with one another, their combined effects on 
psychological contract violation were also assessed.  Only causal and responsibility 
attributions were able to explain additional variance in psychological contract violation 
beyond that accounted for by the control variables.  In opposition to my hypothesis, and 
in opposition to what would be expected with a full entailment model, blame attributions 
did not explain additional variance in psychological contract violation beyond that 
accounted for by the other two attributions.  This result is interesting, as it parallels a 
trend in several studies within the marital literature to combine measures of responsibility 
and blame attributions.  What is perplexing about this finding is the amount of support 
there is in the literature for blame as the proximal influence on negative emotions and 
related negative behaviors (cf. Clore et al., 1993; Lind, 1997; Ortony et al., 1988).  If 
blame cannot be meaningfully operationalized as a construct that is distinct from 
responsibility, it will be difficult to test this theoretical distinction.  Future research 
should explore additional items that may better represent the construct of blame than 
those used in the present study.  

109 


The full entailment model, including all three types of attributions, in a sequence, 

 
predicting psychological contract violation only had mediocre fit to the data.  This 
information alone is not enough to reject an entailment explanation for the data, as 
several of the paths in the model were of the expected magnitude and direction.  Causal 
attributions had a strong influence on responsibility attributions, responsibility 
attributions had a strong influence on blame attributions, and blame attributions had a 
strong influence on psychological contract violation.  Although blame attributions did not 
add predictive power to the regression equation that already contained both causal and 
responsibility attributions, blame attributions did exert a significant direct influence on 
psychological contract violation when tested using structural equation modeling.  It must 
be noted that the path from responsibility to blame was on its boundary, indicating that 
RAMONA was having some trouble fitting the model to the data.  To make sure that the 
model estimation difficulties were not due to the RAMONA program, I ran the same 
analyses using LISREL 8 and obtained very similar results.   

Based on the results of the structural equation model analysis, it is very difficult 

Along with the questions about the validity of the entailment model, there are 

to determine whether the entailment model should be retained or not.  Therefore, 
additional research, using a different sample of employees, should be conducted to clarify 
the results from the present study. 
 
concerns about the proper factor structure for causal, responsibility and blame 
attributions.  Although a three-factor model appeared to fit the data best, it was not 
entirely clear that each attribution was distinct from the others.  Some support for the 
distinctiveness of causal and responsibility attributions came from the fact that 

110 


responsibility attributions were able to explain additional variance in the regression 
equation predicting violation.  Future research should make efforts to minimize the 
overlap between the three types of attributions, possibly by choosing different items to 
represent some of the attributions.  One explanation for the overlap between the three 
attributions is that the majority of employees were making attributions for events that 
occurred some time in the past, possibly even years ago.  Thus, distinctions that they 
might have made between the three attributions when the breach was more salient in their 
minds could not be made as easily in retrospect.  A similar explanation was provided by 
Fincham and Bradbury (1987) who indicated that responsibility attributions may not have 
added to the explanation of marital distress beyond causal attributions in their study 
because their sample consisted of non-distressed couples for whom judgments of 
responsibility might not have been as important.   

The proper factor structure for psychological contract breach and violation was 

also somewhat unclear in the present research.  Although Robinson and Morrison (2000) 
had previously reported evidence for a two-factor solution, they did so by exploring the 
factor weights and differential relationships between psychological contract breach, 
violation and major outcomes in their study.  They did not employ confirmatory factor 
analytic techniques, so it is difficult to directly compare their results to mine.  Based on 
the use of confirmatory factor analytic techniques in the present study, the two-factor 
solution fit the data better than a one factor solution, but the fit was still not within 
acceptable levels for model fit.  However, the fact that psychological contract breach and 
psychological contract violation had different relationships with each of the key outcome 
variables provided support for their distinctiveness.  Future research must attempt to 

111 


Both psychological contract breach and psychological contract violation were 

clarify the relationship between psychological contract breach and psychological contract 
violation.  
Breach, Violation and Individual Outcomes 
In contrast to my predictions, neither the importance of the contract breach nor the 
 
employee’s emotion regulation ability moderated the relationship between psychological 
contract breach and psychological contract violation.  Part of this result may be due to 
restriction of range in these two variables, as most employees rated each of the six breach 
dimensions as very important and agreed or strongly agreed with the statements regarding 
regulation of their emotions.     
 
found to be related to several of the individual outcomes measured in this study.  
Psychological contract breach was positively correlated with psychological contract 
violation, organizational cynicism and WDOs.  Psychological contract breach was also 
negatively correlated with OCBOs, but not correlated with either OCBIs or WDIs.  When 
comparing the magnitude of the correlations from my study to those of the meta-analysis 
described in the introduction section, we find many similarities.  For example, the 
relationship between global psychological contract breach and OCBOs in my study was  
-.16, as compared to -.22 in the meta-analysis and the .22 correlation between global 
breach and WDOs in my study was similar to the .28 correlation in the meta-analysis.  
The relationship between global breach and psychological contract violation in my study 
(r=.78) was higher than that reported in the meta-analysis (r=.42), although the 
relationship for the dimensional breach measure used in my study (r=.48) was similar in 

112 


magnitude to the correlations in prior studies.  Thus, the results from the present study are 
generally in line with previous research on psychological contracts.    

Psychological contract violation was positively correlated with organizational 

Taking all of the regression analyses for global and dimensional psychological 

cynicism, WDIs and WDOs, and negatively correlated with OCBOs.  In addition, 
psychological contract violation was more strongly related to OCBOs than OCBIs, but 
not WDOs versus WDIs.  Unfortunately, no meta-analytic comparisons are possible for 
psychological contract violation, as there are too few studies reporting a relationship 
between violation and other relevant workplace attitudes and behaviors. 
 
contract breach, psychological contract violation, and individual outcomes as a whole, we 
find that psychological contract violation was generally able to explain additional 
variance in the dependent variables beyond what could be accounted for by psychological 
contract breach.  Psychological contract violation was a mediator of the relationship 
between at least one form of psychological contract breach and OCBOs, WDIs, WDOs 
and organizational cynicism.  These findings imply that it is more important to consider 
psychological contract violation than psychological contract breach, when attempting to 
predict individual attitudes and behaviors within an organization.  Therefore, the majority 
of prior studies that have looked only at the relationship between psychological contract 
breach and organizational outcomes have been ignoring an important relationship 
between psychological contract violation and these same outcomes. 
Potential Limitations of the Present Study 

One of the limitations of this study relates to the potential for common method 

 
variance to inflate the relationships among key constructs.  This potential is present 

113 


because the data were collected from a single source (the individual employee) for all of 
the variables.  Typically, this limitation is just recognized and acknowledged, with the 
understanding that little can be done about it.  However, a recent article by Lindell and 
Whitney (2001) provided a partial correlation method that allows for an adjustment of the 
observed correlations for common method variance contamination.  This adjustment will 
allow me to determine whether the conclusions about the practical and statistical 
significance of the relationships among variables in my study have been influenced by 
the presence of common method variance. 
 
Lindell and Whitney (2001) advocated choosing the smallest correlation between 
the predictors and criterion in the data set, and using that value in the partial correlation 
adjustment.  Although it is preferable to include a variable in the study that is expected to 
have no correlation with the others and use it in this analysis, I had not included such a 
variable in my study.  Fortunately, although unexpectedly, the importance variable was 
not strongly correlated with the majority of variables in my study.  I will demonstrate the 
Lindell and Whitney method using the relationship between global psychological contract 
breach and psychological contract violation.  The smallest correlation I found for the 
relationship between the predictors and psychological contract violation was .03 for the 
importance measure.  I then used this correlation as the estimate of common method 
variance in my study.  After using the equations provided by Lindell and Whitney, I 
determined that the original correlation of .78 between global psychological contract 
breach and psychological contract violation was only reduced to a correlation of .77   
once method variance was taken into account.  When using the same formula for the 
relationship between psychological contract violation and OCBOs, using an even more 

114 


conservative method variance estimate of .05, we find that the correlation of .20 is 
reduced to .16.  This reduced correlation is still statistically and practically significant.  
 
The majority of relationships in my study are not affected by taking common 
method variance into account, however a few of the relationships that were based on 
smaller sample sizes, or were at marginal significance level to begin with, would be 
affected by taking method variance into account.  Therefore, the overall effects of method 
variance in this study do not appear to be extremely large, however they are important to 
consider as they have the potential to make some of the smaller, marginally significant 
correlations, non-significant. 
 
In addition to the results of the Lindell and Whitney (2001) analysis, the fact that 
several correlations in my sample had magnitudes of zero or very close to zero, indicates 
that the presence of method variance was not inflating all correlations.  In addition, the 
results for the key variables are similar to (and in some cases smaller than) those that 
were obtained in the meta-analysis I conducted.      
It is also important to note that this study was cross-sectional, as all responses to 
 
the survey were collected from employees at a single point in time.  Because several of 
the hypotheses imply a specific direction of causality among variables, it is important to 
realize that the conclusions we draw from this study are only inferences about causality.  
This is true even when more robust methods like structural equation modeling were used, 
as reversing directional paths can provide the same model fit to the data.  Additional 
research using longitudinal designs in which perceptions of breach are measured at one 
point in time and perceptions of contract violation or other outcomes are measured at 
future points in time would be helpful.  It will be important to determine the causal 

115 


sequence among these variables, as some researchers have questioned whether cognitions 
precede emotions and have proposed the opposite causal sequence.  Of course, these 
types of studies require additional time and impose additional constraints on the 
sponsoring organization that may not always make these types of designs feasible.  
Future studies could employ controlled laboratory simulations to establish causality 
among the variables.  There are, however, tradeoffs for conducting such a study in the 
laboratory, including the reduced psychological fidelity of the experimental setting, or the 
likelihood that the sample would consist of undergraduate participants, thus limiting 
generalizations to the population of employees in organizations.   
 
made for breaches of their psychological contracts, the overall sample size of 358 was 
reduced to a sample of about 200 for any analyses involving attributions.  Although the 
overall sample was larger than several of the samples from previous psychological 
contract research, the sample of 200 for the attribution factor analyses, regressions and 
structural equation models was not as large.  In addition, the sample size of about 50 for 
analyses involving workplace deviance was small, thus any results involving these 
variables should be replicated in future work.   

Because the current study was concerned mainly with the attributions employees 

Larger sample sizes, especially for the structural equation models, would help to 
create more stable parameter estimates and narrower corresponding confidence intervals.  
It should be mentioned, however, that even the reduced sample of 200 was large enough 
to provide appropriate amounts of statistical power.  For the structural equation models 
examined in this study, the power to detect a difference between good model fit and poor 

116 


model fit was over .80, and, since several models did not fit the data well, adequate 
power was obviously not an issue.   

Topics for Future Research 

Breach of the Customer’s Psychological Contract 

Most of the research on psychological contracts has focused on the effects of 

breaches of an employee’s psychological contract.  An important direction for future 
research would be to consider breaches of the customer’s psychological contract.  Breach 
of customer contracts was alluded to in Rousseau’s (1995) book, although she did not 
devote much space to this topic.  It is likely that the downturn in the economy is having 
an effect both on employees within organizations and on customers who rely on those 
organizations for goods or services.  As an example, although it is important to consider 
the effect that the restructuring of the major airlines is having on its employees, it is also 
important to understand how customers of these airlines feel about the changes.  
Customers of the major airlines have been affected by reduced flight schedules, higher 
costs, longer wait times, additional baggage restrictions and the elimination of meals on 
most cross-country flights.  It would be interesting to look at how customers interpret the 
changes that the airlines are making (i.e., what types of causal, responsibility and blame 
attributions they form) and how their interpretations influence psychological contract 
violation.   

Another example comes from my own personal experience of purchasing a home 

computer from a company over the internet.  I was a bit wary of doing so, but was 
convinced by their 24/7 service policy and their assurances that if anything went wrong I 
could contact them any time of the day or night.  About six months after I purchased the 

117 


computer, it failed to start up correctly one evening, so I called the 1-800 number for 
assistance.  I learned that their new business hours were 8am-6pm, a significant reduction 
from what I was promised.  I was angry and felt cheated, so I wrote a letter to the 
organization explaining my frustration with this change.  In the future, I will not be 
purchasing a computer from that company again.     

  Organizations that are concerned with customer engagement (not just employee 
engagement) realize that the relationship between their organization and their customers 
is extremely important.  These organizations realize that the customer’s relationship with 
the organization is based on mental images created by its brands, direct experiences with 
its products or services, or through human interactions with employees or other 
representatives of the organization.  Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina (2002) note that 
customers develop emotional engagement with an organization when they feel that the 
organization “always delivers on what they promise” (p. 173), thus implying few if any 
breaches of the customer’s psychological contract.  As with the psychological contracts 
of employees, some of the promises (e.g., timeline for returning a rebate coupon, a free-
trial usage period, a product return policy) “are formally presented and agreed upon by 
customers, but some other(s) are not” (p. 176).       

  The number of examples of breaches of customer psychological contracts far 

outweighs the amount of empirical research on the topic.  The study of breaches of a 
customer’s psychological contract is, therefore, a very interesting and potentially fruitful 
avenue of exploration for future research.   
 
 

118 


The present study was concerned solely with the overall organization as the target 

Target of the Contract Breach 
 
of contract breach.  Although this makes data collection a bit easier, this focus does 
ignore the additional targets that employees may perceive contracts with.  For example, 
Rousseau (1995) has indicated that recruiters, managers, mentors, coworkers and top 
management may be the target of a particular employee’s psychological contract.  Marks 
(2001) indicated that we should parallel the work that has been done on foci of 
commitment and consider the employee’s psychological contract to be multifaceted.  In 
this way, we would be able to examine the relative importance of the different targets of 
an employee’s psychological contract.  For example, an employee who spends little time 
exploring HR policies and practices within their organization is more likely to be 
influenced by day to day interactions with coworkers or a manager.  In order to get a true 
picture of an employee’s psychological contract, it will be important to understand the 
relative contribution of each potential promise made within the organization.  In doing so, 
future research will be able to provide a better understanding of which types of contract 
breach have the largest impact on certain types of individuals.  As there is currently little 
existing research that explores multiple foci of the psychological contract, it may be 
beneficial to begin new research in this domain with an emphasis on qualitative data 
gathering. 
Legal Implications of Contract Breach 
The present study has focused mainly on the emotions employees experience in 
 
response to a perceived breach of their psychological contract, along with the outcomes 
of organizational citizenship and workplace deviance behaviors.  When employees 

119 


perceive that there has been a breach of their psychological contract that was due to the 
organization, and they hold the organization responsible for that breach, they tend to feel 
the negative emotions associated with contract violation.  It is possible that, in certain 
circumstances, employees will be angry and resentful enough to sue the organization over 
this breach (Stone, 2001).  Lind (1997) indicated that “the attribution of blame is one of 
the most important single factors in personal injury claiming” (p. 158).  It is therefore 
likely that bringing the study of attributions into the legal arena is a worthwhile endeavor. 
An interesting goal of future research would be to explore the prevalence of court 
 
cases that arise from perceived breaches of an employee’s psychological contract.  Many 
court cases dealing with breach of implied contract may actually represent aspects of the 
psychological contract that have been breached.  The degree to which court cases include 
allusions to breaches of the psychological contract could be ascertained through a policy 
capturing study examining the types of contract breach that are most often present in 
court cases, and their effect on the outcome of those cases.   
Organizational Implications of the Findings 

One of the implications of the findings from the present research is that the way 
employees interpret the breaches of their psychological contract influences their affective 
and behavioral reaction to the breaches.  Based on this finding, it will be important for 
future research to focus on the things organizations can do to avoid these adverse 
employee reactions.  Obviously, the best thing to do would be to ensure that no breaches 
occur in the first place.  As this is probably an unrealistic goal, the organization could 
benefit from knowing what to do when they know that they are about to make a decision 
that will breach the psychological contract of several employees (or they become aware 

120 


that breaches have already occurred).  The work of Rousseau and Tijoriwala (1999) on 
social accounts and motivated reasoning informs us that the message organizations send 
to employees has the potential, if crafted correctly, to mitigate the organization’s 
responsibility.  They also found, however, that many of the employees in their sample did 
not believe the organization’s social account, thus highlighting the importance of 
employees’ trust in management for such accounts to be successful at minimizing 
psychological contract violation.  In a related study, Korsgaard, Brodt and Whitener 
(2002) found that the greater the trustworthy behavior by the manager (e.g., open 
communication and demonstration of concern for employees) the lower the tendency for 
employees to attribute responsibility to the manager or the organization. 

Conclusion 

The present study has added to our understanding of psychological contracts by 
clarifying the role of attributions in the development of psychological contract violation.  
In addition, this study integrated a model from the marital satisfaction literature in an 
attempt to cross validate it in an organizational setting.  This study has also enhanced our 
knowledge about the relative importance of contract violation (emotions) versus contract 
breach (cognitive perceptions) in the prediction of several key individual attitudinal and 
behavioral outcomes.  As the study of psychological contracts is still in its preliminary 
stages, much additional research along several different lines (e.g., customer contact 
breach, multiple foci, legal claims) is yet to be conducted before we have a full picture of 
the influence of psychological contracts in organizations.

APPENDIX B:  PILOT SURVEY AT THE LARGE GOVERNMENT 

ORGANIZATION 

GENERAL SURVEY INSTRUCTIONS 

 
 

The attached survey is part of my dissertation research in the Industrial-

Organizational Psychology program at the Ohio State University.  This research deals 
with employees’ perceptions of various aspects of their work environment and the 
emotions employees feel while they are at work. 

 
Your participation in completing this survey is purely voluntary, and the results 

will not be shared with the management of your organization.  Your participation is 
completely anonymous--there is no need to include your name on this survey.  The 
survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. 
 
If you have any questions about this survey, or are interested in obtaining a 
summary of the overall results, please contact Michael Zottoli at zottoli.1@osu.edu.  
Thank you very much for your participation. 
 
Sincerely, 

 

 

Michael A. Zottoli, M.A.

SECTION 3 

 

During the recruitment process and after hiring, organizations often make commitments or promises to 
employees regarding aspects of their work and the organization in general.  These promises may be 
explicit, in the form of spoken assurances from a recruiter, supervisor, or coworker.  These promises may 
also be implicit, or inferred, based upon aspects of the organization’s culture, vision/strategy, the human 
resource policies, and other documents.   
 
For the items below, please indicate the extent to which the amount you actually received from your 
organization compares to the amount that the organization had committed or promised to provide to you.  
Your responses should be made on the following scale:

APPENDIX C: SURVEY FOR FULL SAMPLE AT THE LARGE INSURANCE 

ORGANIZATION 

GENERAL SURVEY INSTRUCTIONS 

 
 

The attached survey is part of my dissertation (Ph.D.) research in the Industrial-
Organizational Psychology program at the Ohio State University.  This research deals 
with employees’ perceptions of various aspects of their work environment and the 
emotions employees feel while they are at work.

 SECTION 1 

 

During the recruitment process and after hiring, organizations often make commitments or promises to employees regarding  
aspects of their work and the organization in general.  These promises may be explicit, in the form of spoken assurances from a  
recruiter, supervisor, or coworker.  These promises may also be implicit, or inferred, based upon aspects of the organization’s  
culture, vision/strategy, observations of the outcomes of others in the organization, the human resource policies, and other  
documents.   
 
For the items below, indicate the extent to which the amount you have actually received from Org. X compares to the amount that 
Org. X had committed or promised to provide to you.  Please circle the appropriate responses.  Your responses should be made on  
the following scale:

Hypothesis Number & Description 

Was Hypothesis Supported? 

1  Causal, responsibility and blame attributions will 

be positively correlated 
The causal-blame correlation will be smaller than 
either the responsibility-blame or causal-
responsibility correlations 
The blame-violation correlation will be stronger 
than either the causal-violation or responsibility-
violation correlations 

2 

3 

4  Causal, responsibility and blame attributions will 
each separately explain a significant amount of 
variance in psychological contract violation 

5  Responsibility attributions will explain additional 

variance in psychological contract violation beyond 
causal attributions 

6  Blame attributions will explain additional variance 

in psychological contract violation beyond both 
causal and responsibility attributions 

7  An entailment model of attributions will be the best 
fitting model for the data 
8  A breach x importance variable will correlate 
positively with psychological contract violation 
9 
The breach-violation relationship will be moderated 
by emotion regulation 
10  Psychological contract violation will be positively 
correlated with organizational cynicism 
11  Psychological contract violation will be negatively 
correlated with organizational citizenship behaviors 
12  Psychological contract violation will be more 
strongly negatively correlated with OCBOs than 
OCBIs  

13  Psychological contract violation will be positively 

correlated with workplace deviance behaviors

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s Psychological 

Contract 

They promised more vacation to me than I was given 
I received better benefits working in the field than at Home 
Office.  We are an insurance company, so I thought the benefits 
package would be much better than it is (after all, our medical 
insurance is through a company we own and run).  At this 
training department, I assumed that I would be respected.  Some 
do respect me, and some don't.  Otherwise, the training 
department has done a good job of setting expectations and then 
delivering a bit more than promised. 
I am surprised to find out about the lack of good benefits, 
particularly medical benefits 
I chose my health plan based on the doctors in the directory.  All 
of my family doctors were in there.  When we actually had to go 
to our respective doctors, they were not on our plan after all.  The 
health plan had been under investigation prior to Organization X 
choosing them.  I blame Organization X’s HR slightly for this for 
not looking deeper into their choice of providers. 
Breach because I was not provided the IRA/401K that I had been 
promised.  This was mostly due to a lack of communication and 
mutual initiative. 
Our health benefits have changed and are now worse than what 
we were told coming in 
My employer agreed to pay for insurance, but it didn't happen 
After a certain number of years, the disability coverage was 
supposed to be paid at 100% by the company.  I am now required 
to pay a portion. 
I was promised a base salary of one amount, but my actual hiring 
base salary was lower.  I accepted it due to a higher than expected 
commissions rate and a favorable market.  I determined that I 
could more than make up the money. 
I switched from Casualty to Property because I was told by the 
hiring manager that he had more money to give out raises in 
Property.  When I got my raise the last PE, it was the smallest 
raise I had received yet.

Table 20: Continued 
 
 

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s 

Psychological Contract 

I was promised higher pay than what I have received 
The MRV has changed since I was hired and my salary has not 
increased despite meets or exceeds performance evaluations. 
I was promised a bonus for coming to work here, but it hasn't 
happened yet. 
I was told I would receive a raise upon attainment of an agent's 
license, but it didn't happen. 
Monetary/salary promises were broken right after being hired. 
I was promised advancement opportunities, but I recently 
found out that without a college degree I am stuck where I'm 
at. 
I was recently told I cannot be promoted to Special Claims Rep 
unless I move out to the field 
Based on my initial interactions with the organization, I was of 
the impression that there would be more opportunities for 
growth and training. 
I was told I would be promoted to attorney representative 
status quickly, but it now appears that won't happen even 
though I have received positive performance evaluations. 
It is not so much a breach of promise but a misunderstanding.  
I was given the impression that I would receive a lot of 
specialized training to do my job, but now I am being told that 
it is not in the budget. 
When I was interviewed, I was given the impression that I 
could move up into SIU.  I've come to find out that I don't have 
enough experience for that unit.  That was a major selling point 
for taking this job with Organization X, and was therefore very 
disappointing to find that it's unattainable. 
Simply, failure to place me in an agency after successfully 
(very positive sales results far in excess of minimums to pass 
program) completing mentee program 6 months ago.

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s Psychological 

Contract 

The failure of career opportunities that had been described to me, 
and the opportunity to advance that didn't happen 
Although it is supposed to be, in the training department and at 
Organization X as a whole, performance-based advancement is not 
used.  Honesty in the criteria used for advancement is not there.  
The things that are officially valued are not the same as what is 
actually valued.  There is dishonesty in compensation for the 
duties assigned.  Less is paid than what the employee's 
responsibility would indicate as appropriate. 
I was told there would be a training period but yet was given 
claims on a larger scale due to inadequate staffing prior to my 
arrival. 
The change in technology, specifically New System X, did not live 
up to the promises as Organization X did not reward the long-term 
claim free client as they promised. 
The system we use to do our business has fallen short of the 
company's and our agency's expectations. 
The only breach item is that there is no sales management capable 
of supporting us.  The first one I had left the company and the new 
one barely communicates--one e-mail every two weeks, one visit 
every 6 months.  There is no feeling of accomplishment for the 
agent level.   
The number of hours to be worked is greater than what I had been 
told. 

The last few years it has seemed like the company cares less and 
less about its employees and more and more about their bottom 
line.

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s 

Psychological Contract 

The only possible breach is workload.  I was told that a lower 
number of claims were handled per month, per adjuster.  The 
actual number is somewhat higher.  However, I feel this 
breach is due to current weather conditions, and not due to a 
pattern of intentional misleading by the hiring manager. 
For the most part, I knew exactly what I was getting.  
However, as Nationwide tries to control more and more from 
the corporate level it makes things much more difficult at the 
local level.  Also, as they shift costs to the agents, they don't 
shift additional regular revenues.  They run on the faulty 
assumption that big agent equals good agent. 
I was told that unless I did something that would cause me to 
lose my license I would have a job as long as I wanted it.  
Now I hear that unless I produce at a set level, I could be out. 
Promised markets to write business with Organization X, and 
the only restrictions to writing would be loss ratio or total 
non-writing.  Production in certain areas gives an opportunity 
to work other lines; you can't just write whatever line of 
business you want.  This was not mentioned in the contract 
or hiring. 
I was NOT notified that my agency was a pilot program 
when I was hired, and that this year will be a transition into 
an independent agency which means I would have to find 
another job because the new agent might not keep the 
existing employees. 
The personal treatment I've received is below any normal 
standards.  My superior is unable to contain his frustration 
without belittling others. 
I was affected both personally and professionally.  There is 
no job security in big business and you're completely 
expendable.  Your skills and abilities are NOT taken into 
consideration at all when major changes/choices are made.  
This occurred in my last department not my current one. 
The last few years it has seemed like the company cares less 
and less about its employees and more and more about their 
bottom line.

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s 

Psychological Contract 

I just finished a program in which I will become a 
principal agent, but the agency I was offered was not 
profitable.  I did not have the resources to continue the 
operation.  I believe that Organization X will not offer me 
another opportunity.  Organization X, in my opinion, 
offered a no win situation.  It was not a valid or fair offer. 
I've been with Organization X for over a year with no 
performance review and no pay raise (promised through 
annual HR communications and corporate policy).  There 
was also another PERSONAL experience with 
Organization X that I won't discuss. 
My plan has been challenged by reduced commissions 
and major rate increases and policy/product changes.  We 
were loaded up with expenses and things are getting more 
and more difficult.  The hours and demands of the job 
negatively impact the quality of my life.  I'm wondering if 
it is all worth it considering I've worked for 5 years with 
no pay increase and now I'll be making $20,000 less than 
planned! 
I was told we had pay for performance at Organization X, 
but it appears to be based on numbers that are derived 
from an unknown source.  Management is unable to 
maintain a functioning workplace environment.  
Management has often said/promised one thing and then 
delivered something else--for example, level of pay, 
numbers of staff, job details, profit sharing plan, company 
car plan. 
I feel that my efforts are not valued and that I was 
promised compensation levels that have not been met. 
Fair and competitive pay for my performance.  In recent 
months, I feel as if Organization X has ignored my time, 
effort, and level of performance in my current job as well 
as my overall contribution to the organization.  I am 
unsure of exactly what it takes in order to earn a 
promotion/raise (realizing that performing at a certain 
level of competency apparently does not mean the same 
thing to me as it does to someone else).  This breach of 
promise has directly resulted in feelings of frustration, 
anxiety, disrespect and inequity.

Comments Relating to Breach of the Employee’s Psychological 

Contract 

Hiring manager advised that I would be promoted within the year.  I 
upheld my end of the bargain and they did not promote me.  
Promotions are not based on individual performance. 
When I was hired, I was told, by my hiring manager, that I did not 
have to pay any expenses for the company car.  I discovered that my 
pay was being reduced for the car expense and approached 
management.  I was told that nothing could be done.  During my 
interview, the "Free Car" was used as a bargaining chip, in place of 
salary, to get me to sign on. 
I feel that my efforts are not valued and that I was promised 
compensation levels that have not been met. 

There have been promises to communicate more, but it does not seem 
to be happening. 
I was originally brought in as the liaison to the field claims 
organization, but this has now changed hands multiple times.  In 
addition, my job duties used to include writing PEs for other 
instructors, but that responsibility has been removed, thus making the 
position different from what was promised in the job description.  In 
addition, I do not feel that certain higher level members of the 
organization treat me with respect.  Pay is also not consistent across 
individuals doing the same job.  I now have a desire to do less work 
due to my growing frustration with the way things are being done.      
I was told during the interview process that the organization values 
providing ongoing feedback to interns regarding their performance, 
including the things they are doing well and areas for improvement.  I 
feel resentful because the first time I heard about any performance 
issues was in a conversation with multiple members of the 
organization, not just the team lead, and I was not given an 
opportunity to improve before my internship ended.
