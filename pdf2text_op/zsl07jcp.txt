Abstract

Increasing pressures from a variety of directions have caused the Chinese automobile supply chain managers to consider and initiate imple-
mentation of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to improve both their economic and environmental performance. Expanding on
some earlier work investigating general GSCM practices in China, this paper explores the GSCM pressures/drivers (motivators), initiatives and
performance of the automotive supply chain using an empirical analysis of 89 automotive enterprises within China. The results show that the
Chinese automobile supply chain enterprises have experienced high and increasing regulatory and market pressures and at the same time have
strong internal drivers for GSCM practice adoption. However, their GSCM implementation, especially with consideration of external relation-
ships, is poor. Therefore, GSCM implementation has only slightly improved environmental and operational performance, and has not resulted in
signiﬁcant economic performance improvement. In furthering this analysis we investigate one speciﬁc organization in this supply chain, the
Dalian Diesel Engine Plant, and how this pioneering company has addressed the issues identiﬁed by the broader empirical analysis.

1. Introduction

The automotive industry together with its supporting supply
chains is expected to encounter what is conceivably the largest
growth of any industry in China and potentially represents the
most lucrative automotive market in the world during the next
few decades [1,2]. Commensurate with this growth is an envi-
ronmental burden, which is unequaled since China’s move to-
wards a market economy integrated with the rest of the world
(i.e. China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)).
The management and planning to mitigate this nascent

environmental burden caused by the Chinese automotive in-
dustry and their respective supply chains will require signiﬁ-
cant thought and foresight.

Environmental

issues ranging from local, regional and
global
implications of air emissions, solid waste disposal
and natural resource usage will all have to be monitored and
managed during these growth phases. Scarcity of resources
and this environmental burden have caused Chinese govern-
mental agencies to further tighten environmental regulations
or offer innovative programs to address these issues [3,4].
Simultaneously,
there has been increased environmental
awareness by the Chinese public and communities further
pressuring industry to alleviate their environmental burdens
[5,6]. Through economic globalization, Chinese companies
have also experienced environmental pressures through their
international customers or partners [7]. For example, Bristol-
Myers Squibb, IBM and Xerox have encouraged their Chinese

suppliers to develop environmental management systems con-
sistent with ISO 14001, while Ford, GM and Toyota have re-
quired their Chinese suppliers to obtain the ISO 14001
certiﬁcation [8].

China, still considered as a developing nation, has also in-
creased its emphasis on economic development, while seeking
to maintain a balance with environmental protection. These
many-faceted pressures have made it a struggle for organiza-
tions to balance economic beneﬁts and environmental perfor-
mance [9], and China’s automotive industry and supply
chains have not been excluded from this balancing act.

All stages of a product’s life cycle will inﬂuence a supply
chain’s environmental burden, from resource extraction, to
manufacturing, use and reuse, ﬁnal recycling, or disposal. To
improve their environmental performance, Chinese manufac-
turers have implemented various kinds of environmental prac-
tices such as ISO14001 certiﬁcation and cleaner production.
As a more systematic and integrated strategy, green supply
chain management (GSCM) has emerged as an important
new innovation that helps organizations develop ‘winewin’
strategies that achieve proﬁt and market share objectives by
lowering their environmental risks and impacts, while raising
their ecological efﬁciency [10].

Rigorous investigation of environmental sustainability is-
sues facing the automotive supply chain in China is virtually
non-existent. We focus on these issues in this paper. Even
though we parlay this study within the context of GSCM,
many of the practices and policies that are investigated are
broader in scope covering numerous dimensions of corporate
environmental sustainability. To explore the environmental
sustainability issues we enhance (through a larger sample
size) some of our previous empirical work focusing exclu-
sively on the automotive supply chain. The empirical results
provide an overview of the general industry and its practices.
To provide some depth to these results and our analysis, we
further detail a case study investigation of one organization’s
operations in the automotive supply chain and its focus on en-
vironmental sustainability issues deﬁned by our empirical
study. Both the empirical study and the more detailed case
study will help to inform our discussion on managerial, policy,
and research directions for environmental sustainability in the
Chinese automotive supply chain.

After a brief description of China’s automotive supply
chain implications for environmental sustainability in indus-
try, we provide an overview of drivers, GSCM practices,
and performance issues in Section 2. Then in Section 3,
we provide details of an empirical study on the GSCM pres-
sure/drivers,
the industry
based on a survey for 89 enterprises in China’s automotive
supply chain. To further enhance the depth of the survey
evaluation, we provide a detailed analysis on one Chinese
automobile engine manufacturer, the Dalian Diesel Engine
Plant (DDEP) evaluating some of their practices in Section
4. In Section 5, implications of results are discussed and
suggestions for enhancing environmental sustainability of
Chinese automotive supply chains are presented. Summaries
and conclusions are presented in Section 6.

2. The Chinese automotive industry and supply chain

Vehicle production has seen a dramatic increase in China
[11]. Thus, environmental burdens and resource shortages re-
lated to the Chinese automotive industry have become increas-
ingly serious. Greening the supply chains is one important
strategy for the Chinese automotive industry’s sustainability,
environmentally, economically and socially.

2.1. An overview of the Chinese automotive industry

China’s automotive industry started in the 1950s, but rapid
modernization and development began in the 1990s. The value
added of China’s auto industry in 2002 was US$19.1 billion,
50% higher than the previous year, and accounting for 6%
of all value added from manufacturing [12]. As of 2002,
33.5 million Chinese were employed in the automotive indus-
try and directly related sectors; one out of 22 workers in China
worked in these sectors. The Chinese auto industry has be-
come the world’s fourth largest vehicle producer, with an ex-
ceptionally high projected growth rate of 20e30% annually
for the next 10 years. The auto sector’s contribution to China’s
total GDP growth could be as high as 20% [13].

In 2003,

total automobile sales in China were about
4.45 million, including 4.39 million made in China (an in-
crease of 34.2% over 2002). These sales rank third following
the USA (12 million), Japan (8 million), and more than those
in Germany (3.5 million). It was estimated that China will
soon become the second largest producer in the world given
current growth rates [14]. In 2004, the Chinese automotive in-
dustry continuously expanded. From January to August of
2004, total production and sales of automobiles in China
were 3.40 million and 3.28 million, respectively, increases of
21.1% and 19.2% compared to automobile production and
sales in 2003 [15].

The Chinese automotive industry has focused its efforts on
its domestic market. However, some companies have started to
export products by cooperating with international partners.
Assembling BMW cars, Brilliance Jinbei announced the plan
to export the Zhonghua sedan to Europe with a tentative target
of 20,000 vehicles. Jiangling Motors, in a partnership with
Ford, has supplied an independent importer and distributor
in the Netherlands with the Landwind SUV, and has plans to
expand into Germany. FAW-Hongta Yunnan Automobile
hopes to sell up to 10,000 vehicles of the Happy Emissary
minicar [16]. These extended partnerships have both economic
and environmental inﬂuences on operations throughout the
Chinese automotive supply chain, as described in Section 2.2.

2.2. Environmental sustainability of the Chinese
automotive industry

The Chinese automotive industry’s rapid growth relates to
two major dimensions affecting environmental sustainability,
environmental burden and resource shortage.

The number of vehicles produced and used in China has
been sharply increasing [13,17]. Thus, air pollution has


Q. Zhu et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 15 (2007) 1041e1052

1043

become a serious problem, especially in big cities. Such con-
tinuous or even accelerating growth in vehicles in China has
added to concerns regarding further environmental degrada-
tion. Even though air quality has improved in recent years, it
is still a major concern. Vehicles, replacing industrial pollu-
tion, have become a major source of air pollution in China.
A report of the World Bank in 2002 indicated that China has
made progress in lowering industrial pollution and coal-
burning, but vehicle-related pollution has risen [18]. For
example, NOx emissions in Beijing were decreased by 17%
from 1988 to 2000, but
increased by 7.1% in 2002 and
increased again in 2003 [13]. These environmental burden
statistics have implications for the automotive supply chains
in attempting to design more environmentally sound products
through eco-design practices by cooperating with and learning
through their supply chain partnerships.

The growth in car production and usage has been a critical
factor in the growth of consumption of numerous resources,
especially metals. Given an estimate that China will produce
over 6 million vehicle units in 2005, it is expected that there
will be signiﬁcant increases in imports of metals. For example,
most of the high-quality galvanized sheet metal used in vehicle
bodies has to be imported [19]. The rapid and continuous
growth of China’s vehicle population has also brought great
challenges to China’s energy resource security. The large
transportation system in China is based on gasoline and diesel
fuels, which would dramatically increase China’s dependence
on oil imports. A sobering fact is if China’s vehicles per capita
were the same as the United States, the oil demand in China
would exceed the worldwide oil production by 18% [13].
The consumption of these resources has implications for re-
source recovery and more efﬁcient use of materials throughout
the automotive supply chain.

With globalization, Chinese automobile companies have to
compete with their international counterparts. After China’s
entry into the WTO, the automotive industry is one of the
most affected industries [20]. As a result, the Chinese automo-
bile supply chains have struggled to improve their economic
and
simultaneously. Thus,
GSCM practices have emerged as a systematic approach
within the automobile industry in China to balance the eco-
nomic and environmental sustainability of ﬁrms.

environmental

performance

As China’s automotive market continues to mature, the role
of GSCM will also evolve. That is, with the greater availability
of spare parts and older cars, the linkage of resource recovery
systems with suppliers and customers will need to be made
collaboratively. Improving (effectiveness and efﬁciency) this
collaborative relationship and infrastructure will be required
for global competitiveness.

2.3. GSCM pressure, practices and performance in the
Chinese automobile industry

Chinese automobile companies have experienced increas-
ing environmental pressure while simultaneously recognizing
various beneﬁts and incentives to green their supply chains
[21,22]. Internal awareness is a key dimension for enterprises

to implement environmental practices such as GSCM. Proac-
tive companies usually have greater implementation of envi-
ronmental practices beyond requirements of
laws and
regulations, while reactive companies only seek compliance
with regulatory requirements. In China, the diversity in the
adoption rates has seen some automobile supply chain compa-
nies proactively implementing environmental strategies such
as green purchasing and eco-design [23]. Yet, compared to
some other industries, e.g. the Chinese electronic industry,
GSCM practice in the Chinese automotive supply chains is
lagging [21,22]. Many automotive supply chain enterprises
considered or initiated some GSCM practices such as invest-
ment recovery, eco-design and internal environmental man-
agement. However, investment recovery and development of
recycled material markets in China have not received much at-
tention. One main reason is due to the nascent Chinese con-
sumer popularity of automobiles, and recycling of used cars
is not currently under careful consideration. That is to say
the maturation of the automotive market is still progressing
and has yet to create a critical mass to be economically worth-
while for development of a used parts market. However, a reg-
ulated automobile take-back system has been in operation in
China since October of 2004. This take-back system forces
manufacturers to consider environmental effects in the whole
life cycle [23], and thus providing motivation for organizations
to further pursue GSCM practices and closing the automobile
supply chain loop.

Following China’s entry into the WTO, Chinese enterprises
have more opportunities to establish relationships with foreign
enterprises in the same supply chain. An automobile company,
DDEP, which is the case study company introduced in this pa-
per, established a close relationship with their downstream
customers and cooperated with international partners such as
Mercedes-Benz by GSCM initiatives such as green purchasing
[24]. However, exporting products or becoming suppliers of
foreign customers in China requires Chinese enterprises to ad-
dress and overcome ‘green barriers’ and increase their interna-
tional competitive ability [25]. Ford, GM and Toyota have
required their Chinese suppliers to be certiﬁed with ISO
14001 [8]. Environmental advantages can bring opportunities
for suppliers. We now address these and other issues using em-
pirical information and a case study analysis.

3. Methodology and survey results

3.1. Research methodology

3.1.1. Questionnaire development

The empirical data used in this study consist of questionnaire
responses from managers in Chinese automotive supply chain
enterprises. The questionnaire contained three sections: (a)
items affecting or motivating implementation (pressures/
drivers); (b) current GSCM practice adoption; (c) corresponding
performance. Eighteen items in part one (pressures/drivers)
were developed on the basis of a number of sources from the
literature [7,26e28] and questions were answered using
a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale (e.g. 1 ¼ not at all important,


1044

Q. Zhu et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 15 (2007) 1041e1052

2 ¼ not important, 3 ¼ not thinking about it, 4 ¼ important,
5 ¼ extremely important). Development of the 23 items in
part two (GSCM practices) were based on industrial expert input
and from the literature [29e31]. Questions in part two were an-
swered using a ﬁve-point scale (1 ¼ not considering it,
2 ¼ planning to consider
it, 3 ¼ considering it currently,
4 ¼ initiating implementation, 5 ¼ implementing success-
fully). The 21 questions in the third section of the questionnaire
were developed by the authors with a focus on environmental
performance, ﬁnancial performance and operational perfor-
mance. Questions about the inﬂuence of implementing GSCM
on these performance factors were answered using a ﬁve-point
scale (1 ¼ not at all, 2 ¼ a little bit, 3 ¼ to some degree,
4 ¼ relatively signiﬁcant, and 5 ¼ signiﬁcant). To avoid confus-
ing respondents on three different ﬁve-point scales, we provided
a brief explanation of the three groups of items at the beginning
of each section in the survey questionnaire. Detailed items for
GSCM drivers/pressures, practice and performance are shown
in Appendix A.

3.1.2. Data collection and sampling characteristics

This study targeted managers at middle or higher manage-
ment levels. Following previous studies such as Carter et al.
[32], we considered that mid-level managers such as those
in a purchasing department could facilitate incremental adop-
tion of environmental practices, which is consistent with our
ﬁndings from extensive corporate interviews with over one
hundred companies before we launched our survey research.
Furthermore, Bowen et al. [33], who completed a study with
middle managers, found positive relationships between middle
managers’ perceptions of corporate environmental proactivity
and GSCM [33,34].

We administered our survey using convenience sampling
during training workshops at the School of Management at
Dalian University of Technology.1 An additional two conve-
nience sample surveys were conducted to acquire the informa-
tion over a two year period from February 2003 to April 2005.
A total of 145 surveys were administered to automotive supply
chain mid-level managers. After consolidation of multiple
respondents from the same organization (e.g. multi-plant orga-
nizations), we arrived at a ﬁnal sample of 89 unique organiza-
tional responses.

Before the initiation of each training workshop, the objective
of the survey together with the GSCM concepts were brieﬂy in-
troduced to the targeted respondents to ensure that they had a full
understanding of the items in the survey questionnaire. We were
present with the study respondents while they were completing

of Management at Dalian University of Technology was established in 1980.
The Center was directly proposed by Mr. Deng Xiaoping, and is the ﬁrst joint
training project between Chinese and American stakeholders. Since 2001, it
has been one of nine training bases for industries in China designated by
the State Economic & Trade Commission. In recent years, the center has pro-
vided training for manager in the Chinese automotive industry. Since managers
involved in training programs are representatives from these industries
throughout China, we can argue that responses from them during two work-
shops can generally represent situations in China for these industries.

the questionnaire, and answered the questions they had about the
survey questionnaire. Subsequent to the survey, we followed up
those returned questionnaires containing unclear answers and
interviewed the respondents concerned.

A majority of the respondents belonged to state-owned en-
terprises or publicly owned enterprises who were transitioned
from state owned enterprises (n ¼ 77) accounting for 86.5% of
our study samples. Company sizes of the respondents in terms
of employee establishment range from under 1000 to over
5000 employees. A majority of the respondent enterprises
fall into the medium-sized and large-sized company cate-
gories, i.e., between 1000 and 5000. In sum, 15 respondent en-
terprises have less

than 1000 employees

3.2. Survey results

3.2.1. Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics, alpha coefﬁcients and item-total corre-
lations are used to initially analyze the survey data after applica-
tion of a principal components factor analysis (see Table 1). All
of the factors for GSCM drivers/pressures, practices and perfor-
mance have a reliability (alpha) value above 0.70, the threshold
value recommended by Nunnally and Bernstein [35]. All the
factors of GSCM practice and performance have high item-total
correlation values, i.e., >0.60, to their corresponding higher-
level constructs. Although the four factors of GSCM drivers/
pressure have relatively low item-total correlations, their values
were considered acceptable, i.e., >0.40, for an exploratory re-
search study like this study. On the basis of the alpha coefﬁcients
and item-total correlations, we conﬁrmed the four factors on
GSCM pressures/drivers,
i.e., regulation, market, supplier
drivers and internal incentives, and the ﬁve factors for GSCM
practices, i.e., internal environmental management, green pur-
chasing, customer cooperation with environmental concerns,
investment recovery, and eco-design. We also classiﬁed com-
pany performance into four dimensions, namely, environmental,
positive economic, negative economic and operational.

As seen in Table 1, Chinese automotive supply chain enter-
prises have experienced signiﬁcant pressures and incentives to
implement GSCM, with mean values over 4.00 for the four
driver factors. Among these drivers/pressures, regulative (leg-
islative) pressures are the highest with a mean value of 4.38.
Market pressure is the second important driver for the Chinese
automotive supply chains to implement GSCM, with a mean
value of 4.28. Legislative (coercive) and normative (image/
marketing) pressures seem to play larger roles as drivers in
this industry. Supply chain pressures (e.g. from customers
and suppliers) do not seem to play as large a role.

GSCM practices’ adoption rate lagged, with mean values
below 3.55 for all the ﬁve GSCM factors, especially for green
purchasing with the lowest mean value of 2.82. The relatively
higher standard deviations for the GSCM practices, i.e., over
1.00, indicate that the implementation level of GSCM is imbal-
anced, with organizations covering the spectrum of innovation

from pioneering ﬁrms at the cutting edge of practice to those
who are lagging considerably. Further analyses indicate a frac-
tion of Chinese automotive supply chain enterprises have initi-
ated GSCM with mean values over 4.00 (4 ¼ initiating
implementation). Seventeen enterprises indicate a mean value
over 4.00 (19.1%) for internal environmental management, 10
enterprises (11.2%) for green purchasing, 9 (10.1%) for cus-
tomer cooperation, 22 (24.7%) for investment recovery and 29
(32.6%) for eco-design.

All GSCM performance dimensions are ranked higher to
some degree, with mean values consistently within the 3.00
(3 ¼ to some degree) and 4.00 (4 ¼ relatively signiﬁcant) ranges.
In this study we deﬁne beneﬁts gained through GSCM as
positive economic improvements, including decrease of cost
for materials purchasing, decrease of cost for energy consump-
tion, decrease of fees for waste treatment and waste discharge,
and decrease of ﬁnes for environmental accidents. Also, we de-
ﬁne related negative economic performance as increase in in-
vestment, increase in operational cost, increase in training
cost and increase of costs for purchasing environmentally
friendly materials. Table 1 indicates that negative economic
performance with a mean value of 3.39 is slightly more signif-
icant than positive economic performance with a mean value of
3.24 as a consequence of organizations implementing GSCM.
In summary, our initial survey results show that Chinese au-
tomobile enterprises have experienced high regulatory and
market pressures and at the same time have strong internal
drivers for implementing GSCM. However, their GSCM im-
plementation, especially on external relationships such as
green purchasing and customer cooperation with environmen-
tal concerns, is weak. These enterprises have only planned to
consider or at most are considering corporate environmental
management and GSCM implementation. Therefore, GSCM
implementation has only slightly improved environmental
and operational performance, but has not resulted in signiﬁ-
cant improvements in economic performance.

3.2.2. Relationships among drivers, practices and
performance: a regression analysis

To examine if GSCM pressures are related to the GSCM
practices and, in turn, if the practices are related to perfor-
mance, we performed regression analyses to examine the rela-
tionships. In the regression models, each factor for GSCM
drivers/pressures, GSCM practices, and performance were av-
eraged from their underlying measurement items to form a sin-
gle indicator factor. The summary factors were subsequently
used for the regression analyses. The use of the summary fac-
tors can reduce the model complexity and allow us to test the
relationships based on small sample size (n ¼ 89).

We include company size as a control variable in the re-
gression analysis. This is to account for the possibility that
the size of the ﬁrm may inﬂuence the extent of their imple-
mentation of GSCM practices. The four factors of GSCM
pressures/drivers (regulative, market, suppliers and internal)
were treated as independent variables and we examined their
impact on the GSCM factors (Internal environmental manage-
ment, green purchasing, customer cooperation, investment re-
covery, and eco-design) in ﬁve regression models. Similarly,
the ﬁve GSCM factors were deﬁned as independent variables
and regressed on each of the performance dimension (environ-
mental, positive economic, negative economic, and opera-
tional) in a second set of four separate regression models.
Nine total regressions are determined with the following
functional forms:

Before proceeding, we examined the variance inﬂation fac-
tor (VIF) to determine the potential existence of multicolli-
nearity. The largest of the resulting VIF scores in all of the
regression models in Tables 2 and 3 were 2.49 and 3.31
respectively,
i.e., well below the maximum level of 10.0
suggested by Mason and Perreault [36], indicating that multi-
collinearity should not be a problem with our data. The inter-
correlations between the study variables are summarized in
Table 4.

The regression analysis shows that there is one signiﬁcant
relationship between GSCM pressures/ drivers on the practice,
i.e., a signiﬁcant positive impact of internal pressures on in-
vestment recovery (b ¼ 0.636). We also note that ﬁrm size
has a signiﬁcant negative impact on internal environmental man-
agement (b ¼  0.335), green purchasing (b ¼  0.302), cus-
tomer cooperation (b ¼  0.230) and eco-design (b ¼  0.365).
The GSCM pressures/drivers seem to have no signiﬁcant
impact on the GSCM practices with respect to internal envi-
ronmental management practices, green purchasing, customer
cooperation and eco-design. An explanation is that
the
Chinese enterprises may face similar and very early pressures/
drivers, but react at a different pace when adopting GSCM
practices. Since most of these organizations are at early adop-
tion stages in implementing GSCM practices, the impact of
these pressures on the extent of their GSCM implementation
may be more obvious as the pressures become more prevalent
and adoptions mature. The variance explained in each of the
regression models are: 10.1% of the variance in internal envi-
ronmental management, 4.7% of the variance in green pur-
chasing, 4.8% of the variance in customer cooperation, 27%
of the variance in investment recovery, and 16.3% of the var-
iance in eco-design. The variance explained indicates the per-
centage of change in a dependent variable (e.g. GSCM
practices) that can be collectively predicted by the indepen-
dent variables (e.g. GSCM pressures) in a regression model.
For instance, 27% of changes in a GSCM practice on invest-
ment recovery can be accounted for by the four GSCM drivers.
The variance explained provides us information to interpret
the strengths of the collective impact of the independent vari-
ables on a dependent variable in our regression analyses.

The results in Table 3 indicate that Internal environmental
management has signiﬁcant positive impact on environmental
performance (b ¼ 0.663), positive economic performance
(b ¼ 0.467), and negative performance (b ¼ 0.630), but not
on operational performance. The two factors of GSCM on
green purchasing and customer cooperation have signiﬁcant
impact only on environmental performance, but not on the
other performance aspects. It should be noted that the impact
of green purchasing on environmental performance is negative
(b ¼  0.482), while the impact from customer cooperation is
positive (b ¼ 0.443). As for impact of investment recovery and
eco-design, the former only has negative impact (b ¼  0.303)
on negative economic performance, while the latter has no im-
pact for all the four performance aspects. Lastly, the control
variable of ﬁrm size only has impact (b ¼ 0.399) on negative
economic performance among the performance aspects. The
variance explained in each of the regression models are:
42.9% of the variance in environmental performance, 26.1%
of the variance in positive economic performance, 32.7% of
the variance in negative economic performance, and 32.0%
of the variance in operational performance.

4. Case study

To provide depth and enhancement (e.g. initial evaluation
of causal relationships among factors) to our empirical ﬁnd-
ings, we provide a detailed analysis on one Chinese automo-
bile engine manufacturer,
the Dalian Diesel Engine Plant
(DDEP), evaluating some of their GSCM practices. This com-
pany has initiated GSCM practices that exemplify various per-
formance improvements.

DDEP, established in 1951, was one of the key plants for
the design and manufacture of diesel engines in China. The
plant has over 2000 employees with total assets of 2 billion
RMB (about US$0.24 billion) and production capacity of
150,000 engines per year. DDEP produces over 140 types of
diesel engines, and each type needs over 2000 components
and more than 100 raw or auxiliary materials. In the past,
the plant produced most of its components and materials.
However, the plant currently outsources over 90% of its parts,

representing over 70% of the value of the product. The plant
classiﬁes suppliers into three categories, strategic partners,
long-term close cooperators, and contractors. The plant cur-
rently has 120 suppliers including 16 strategic partners.

The plant has over 300 products, covering three series
(light, middle and heavy), and including ﬁve models
(CA4DC, CA4DS, CA6DE, CA6DF, and DEUTZ). The power
of manufactured engines ranges from 62 to 236 kW, and thus
the plant has enough product ﬂexibility capability to supply
engines for trucks, cars, special vehicles and engineering ma-
chines. Besides its main customer, First Automobile Works
(FAW) of China, the plant also supplies parts and engines
for over 50 domestic vehicle manufacturers that export vehi-
cles to dozens of countries and regions. Thus, we can observe
that the inﬂuence of this one engine manufacturer has the po-
tential to be quite broad. Even though at this time it primarily
supplies one OEM, there is movement to develop additional
partnerships that can cause its products to inﬂuence even
greater number of transport vehicle supply chains.

In the next section we describe the increasing pressures
causing DDEP to initiate various GSCM-related practices.
As a result, the plant has improved their environmental image
and gained economic beneﬁts.

4.1. GSCM drivers/pressure in the Dalian Diesel
Engine Plant

Diesel engine vehicles are traditional heavy polluters. In
China, the Air Pollution Prevention and Abatement Law was
enacted in 1987, and has been modiﬁed twice in 1995 and
2000, becoming increasingly strict. The law requires all com-
panies to manufacture vehicles with air emissions below
speciﬁed standards. At the same time, the law encourages pro-
duction of vehicles using cleaner energy. The plant facility is
also located in Dalian, a region with a reputation as one of the
cleanest and greenest cities in China. Thus, the municipality
has exerted extra pressure for the plant to improve and main-
tain its environmentally sound image. This type of pressure
varies by municipalities, but is clearly evident
in Dalian.
DDEP has also been quite cognizant of the automobile take-
back system that has been implemented since Oct. 1 of 2004

in China, which forces manufacturers to consider environmen-
tal effects in the whole life cycle of their products.

Managers within DDEP have also experienced motivational
drivers and pressures from their customers. For example, the
director of the Purchasing and Supply Department, informed
the interview team that the environmental requirements from
customers and regulations are immense challenges for the
plant, but he was also aware that they can bring opportunities
such as competitive advantages within the market, if they are
appropriately implemented.

As a subsidiary of the First Automobile Works (FAW),
DDEP sells over 90% of its products to its parent company.
FAW and Dongfeng Motor Corporation are two main manufac-
turers producing medium and heavy diesel vehicles in China.
With globalization, especially after China’s entry into the
WTO, international manufacturers such as Volvo, Isuzu, Hita-
chi and Hyundai have entered into the Chinese market by
directly selling vehicles and gradually establishing joint
ventures. DDEP recently established a plant on May 26, 2005
that is expected to be a joint venture between DDEP and
DEUTZ,
Increased
globalization and partnership formation is evidence of high
volatility in the Chinese automotive market with competitive
pressures continuing to increase. In designing and developing
products, major requirements for product functionalities from
consumers include reliability, durability, diesel consumption,
and air emissions. As a result, diesel vehicle manufacturers
have tried to improve their environmental image to keep or
gain market share. This pressure is currently channeled from
customers to FAW through DDEP.

further expanding DDEP’s inﬂuence.

Managers made clear that suppliers’ business continuity is
also a main concern for DDEP. Diesel engines are complex
products, and their environmental performance depends on
several key components. Thus, DDEP has the responsibility
to ensure that their suppliers meet various environmental stan-
dards. The Marketing Department Director made clear that ev-
ery effort is made to purchase all materials and components
from suppliers with strong reputations for both quality and en-
vironmental credibility. Thus DDEP practices monitoring of
its suppliers’ internal environmental management programs
to avoid a situation where suppliers will stop or delay

production due to environmental issues, that is, to maintain
business continuity and reduce risk. Managers also realize
that suppliers’ advances in environmental practices can pro-
mote the advancement of DDEP’s own environmental
practices.

Competitors’ environmental practices were also seen as
motivation (pressures/drivers) for DDEP to implement envi-
ronmental management. The DDEP general manager empha-
sized that environmental improvement is a core competitive
organizational dimension for which they continue to build
competency. In his view, DDEP would lose signiﬁcant com-
petitive advantages if they don’t make continuous improve-
ment efforts on environmental management. For example,
the Chaoyang Diesel Engine Plant, a subsidiary of the Dong-
feng Engine Corporation and direct competitor to DDEP, has
improved its environmental image through technological inno-
vation. Another subsidiary of the FAW and even more direct
competitor to DDEP, the Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant, recently
marketed its new green motors. Even though DDEP is a pio-
neering plant on environmental management, in recent years
it has continuously observed internal and external competitors
with an environmentally competitive dimension. Maintaining
this competitive edge and image is a main motivation for
DDEP to implement GSCM-based practices.

4.2. GSCM practices in the Dalian Diesel Engine Plant

As a pioneering automobile company, DDEP has initiated
multiple dimensions of GSCM practices, including internal
environmental management, green purchasing, green market-
ing and eco-design.

Producing environmentally sound engines is one key di-
mension DDEP uses to establish their environmental image,
and thus gain and keep competitiveness. Within this compet-
itive market, senior managers in the DDEP put forward a call
of ‘‘Green plant, environmental engines’’. They have worked
on furthering their environmental image by producing diesel
engines with low emissions, low diesel consumption, low
noise, as well as high dynamic functions and reliability. To
at least maintain and potentially improve its environmental
performance, DDEP has invested over 12 million RMB (about
US$1.45 million) since 2001. The plant purchased equipment
for emission puriﬁcation, noise elimination and wastewater
treatment, which greatly improved its internal environmental
conditions. In 2003, DDEP initiated a waste water reuse
project, and became the ﬁrst company realizing ‘‘zero emis-
sions’’ for both industrial and municipal waste water in
Dalian, which is very important in a municipality that is con-
sistently threatened with water shortages [24]. To complete
this program the plant
invested 2.59 million RMB (about
US$0.313 million) for a wastewater treatment project by using
ﬂocculation, bio-chemical, ultra-ﬁltration and reverse osmosis
technologies.

In November 2003, DDEP became TUVISO/TS16949 cer-
tiﬁed, which is an international quality management standard
for the automobile industry that encompasses product design
installation and service
and development, manufacturing,

functions within the organization. Such certiﬁcation facilitates
DDEP’s entry into the global automotive market
[37].
Leveraging this
experience with internationally based
standards, DDEP has also been seeking ISO14001 and
OHSMS18001 certiﬁcation.

Environmental issues are main concerns for DDEP during
its product design and development. The Product Develop-
ment Director in DDEP stated that environmental require-
ments are quickly becoming primary priorities, even over
economic beneﬁts. To help them address this management pri-
ority the plant closely cooperates with research institutes and
universities on eco-design projects. As an example of this suc-
cess, since April 2004, all products produced by the DDEP
meet the Europe II emission standards [37].

The plant has also implemented cleaner production activi-
ties in its production stages focusing on source reduction
and waste prevention. The plant implements collaborative de-
velopment efforts with its suppliers, which include environ-
mental considerations, and these efforts and programs are
driven by the organization’s internal environmental strategy
and policy. Customer collaboration is also evident here. For
different types of vehicles, road conditions and consumer char-
acteristics,
jointly
develop improved engines that consume less fuel, while main-
taining suitable performance standards (including acceleration
and cooling systems capabilities).

the plant and its main customer, FAW,

The signiﬁcance of outsourcing practiced by DDEP re-
quires them to more closely monitor supplier environmental
practices to guarantee both quality and environmental perfor-
mance requirements. The plant not only collects environmen-
tal
information related to suppliers, but also establishes
a database on environmental situations for main component
suppliers [23]. The plant jointly implements research on sub-
stitute materials and technologies to improve environmental
practices with those partners and even joins in some of these
innovation programs with competitors. At the same time, the
plant also outsources other non-manufacturing functions,
such as logistics functions to help achieve their goals of
just-in-time (JIT) production. This outsourcing requires mon-
itoring of its distribution and transportation environmental
and economic performance. JIT provides a managerial chal-
lenge since JIT’s minimization of waste philosophy is environ-
mentally sound, yet, more frequent delivery requirements
weaken transportation energy efﬁciency, causing environmen-
tally detrimental consequences.

eco-design

DDEP has

implemented

programs
through coordination and cooperation with international pio-
neers such as DEUTZ. One innovation implemented by
DDEP is a joint quality evaluation program with both sup-
pliers and customers. The plant classiﬁes components into
three types. The ﬁrst type of components is related to life
and safety; the second type is related to product functions,
capability and precision; and the third type is mainly joint
(connecting) parts. DDEP considers it necessary to imple-
ment quality evaluation for the ﬁrst and the second types
of components due to more importance placed on these char-
acteristics by customers. In the past, suppliers implemented

quality evaluation for newly developed products. However,
DDEP had to complete quality evaluation as well when com-
ponents were sent to its warehouse. Now, DDEP sends staff
to suppliers to implement joint quality evaluations. This ap-
proach avoids a second quality evaluation in the plant, saves
additional quality evaluating equipment for DDEP, and also
facilitates communication between DDEP and its suppliers.
Using similar quality evaluation programs with its cus-
tomers, DDEP also improves efﬁciency and reduces costs.
DDEP considers such programs environmentally friendly
since their philosophy is that
improvements in efﬁciency
(while reducing costs) represents improvements in environ-
mental performance, primarily due to fewer resources con-
sumed or wastes discarded.

4.3. GSCM performance in the Dalian Diesel
Engine Plant

GSCM efforts by DDEP have improved its environmental
performance and created opportunities such as enlarging its
market share. This environmental performance improvement
is supported through various awards and initiatives achieved.
In 2003, DDEP was one of nine companies recognized as an
environmental protection model company by the local envi-
ronmental planning board. In 2004, the plant received another
award and was also nominated as one of the hundred best sup-
pliers in the automobile industry in China [38]. Such awards
have greatly improved DDEP’s environmental
image. As
stated above, China will require all vehicles to meet Euro II
emission standards. DDEP products have already met these
standards as of April 2005 [38].

DDEP has enlarged its market, in part, due to its continuous
GSCM practices. In 2004, DDEP produced 100,188 diesel en-
gines, 22.28% more than in 2003 and sold 101,550 diesel en-
gines, 22.35% more than in 2003. Both sales and production
are the highest on record in DDEP’s 53-year history of the
plant [38]. The limited accounting and performance manage-
ment operational practices in DDEP make it difﬁcult to deter-
mine where GSCM practice adoption has contributed to
performance. For example, without meeting certain environ-
mental requirements in their products and processes, it is prob-
ably very unlikely that they would be able to stay in business,
much less thriving in this environment. What is clear is that
they continue to perform well on a variety of performance fac-
tors even with GSCM practice increases.

DDEP has improved both environmental and economic per-
formance through GSCM related practices. It is complying
with regulatory and market pressures by offering innovative
and environmentally sound products. However, the plant has
also faced numerous challenges. Prices for energy and raw
materials have continuously increased. Emission standards
have become increasingly strict. For example, the Federal gov-
ernment recently announced plans to implement Euro III stan-
dards on emissions by the end of 2005. These continued
pressures and forces will cause not only DDEP to adopt and
advance GSCM innovation, but other manufacturers will
need to react as well.

5. Discussion

Q. Zhu et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 15 (2007) 1041e1052

In both the empirical analysis and the case study we have
observed that Chinese automotive organizations are feeling
multiple pressures and are also reacting with multiple and
diverse sets of actions. The organization in the case study is
a relatively more innovative organization when it comes to
adopting GSCM practices and practicing environmental
sustainability. The pressures they feel are similar to other
automotive supply chain members, but their size and partner-
ships seem to allow them advantages that may not exist in
other organizations, to respond to these pressures. Yet, these
multi-faceted isomorphic pressures faced by the automotive
supply chain including regulatory and global market pressures
will eventually cause automotive supply chain organizations
to adopt a baseline level of many of these practices. Indus-
try-wise we have observed some minor relationships between
pressures and adoption rates, but the case study company
clearly points to a causal relationship that exists for these
relationships with management indicating that many of the
GSCM practices were driven by these pressures. This infor-
mation cannot be gleaned from the empirical data alone. It
is expected that these causal relationships probably exist for
other organizations within the Chinese automotive supply
chain.

Another observation that can be made from the case study
and with implications for the overall industry not yet observed
in the empirical data, is that different pressures will cause
adoption of different practices. For example, we see that do-
mestic regulatory pressures from emissions laws and automo-
bile take-back legislation will
inﬂuence eco-design and
investment recovery practice adoption in the automotive sup-
ply chain, whereas supply chain and market pressures will in-
ﬂuence cooperative efforts and green purchasing practices.
These are issues and factors that can be investigated in later,
longitudinal, studies of environmental sustainability within
the supply chain.

Another issue that arose from the case study is that even
though there are relationships that exist either implicitly or ex-
plicitly between GSCM practice adoption and performance in
the empirical study, the tangible and direct results are not al-
ways clear. The capability to monitor and measure perfor-
mance and tie them to certain GSCM practices is something
that is difﬁcult to do, but may be necessary for further adop-
tion of these practices when other organizations attempt to
make a ‘business case’ for adoption of these practices. Our
data in the empirical study were perceptually based; the case
study brings into question whether these perceptions can be
tied to performance. Even within the case study company, en-
vironmental performance measurements were not explicitly
recorded and that tying the ﬁnancial measures to speciﬁc prac-
tices is an extremely difﬁcult proposition. The research value
of having these measurements is clear, but practical manage-
rial value is something that is necessary for long-term im-
provements and practice adoption decisions.

From a more general legislative and policy perspective, it is
regulations with strict enforcement are

that strict

clear

important motivators and drivers for companies to consider en-
vironmental issues through their whole supply chains. In addi-
tion, publicizing pioneer environmentally friendly companies,
such as through environmental awards by the Dalian munici-
pality, can be an incentive for companies, whose environmen-
tal performance reaches beyond environmental regulations, to
make continuous efforts on environmental improvements. This
relates to the inﬂuence of image of the organization not only
from the community’s perspective, but also within the supply
chain as an exemplary organization with which to do business,
whether it is as a customer or vendor.

6. Summary and conclusions

After China’s entry into the WTO, the Chinese automobile
industry, and its corresponding supply chains, has faced chal-
lenges instilled by their international counterparts. Entry into
the WTO has also meant that the growth in transportation ve-
hicle and component demands by consumers, organizations,
and international partners will skyrocket. It is expected that
China will become one of the largest producers and users of
automobiles and their parts. As a result, Chinese automobile
supply chains have struggled to improve their economic and
environmental performance (and sustainability)
simulta-
neously. Thus, GSCM practices have emerged as systematic
approaches for the automobile industry in China.

Correspondingly, Chinese automobile enterprises have ex-
perienced high regulatory and market pressures and at the
same time have strong internal drivers for GSCM practice
adoption. However, their GSCM practice implementation, es-
pecially on external relationships such as green purchasing and
customer cooperation focusing on environmental concerns, is
lagging. In most cases these enterprises have only planned
to consider or, at most, considering corporate environmental
management and GSCM implementation. Therefore, GSCM
implementation has only slightly improved environmental
and operational performance, and has not resulted in signiﬁ-
cant economic performance. The relationship between pres-
sures and GSCM practice adoption at
this time is not
entirely clear. It is expected that as time progresses the rela-
tionships between the increasing pressures and nascent
GSCM practices will become clearer. In our case study, we
see evidence of these direct relationships within a more pio-
neering organization. A detailed analysis on one Chinese auto-
mobile engine manufacturer indicates that with the pressures
and drivers, pioneering companies such as the Dalian Diesel
Engine Plant have initiated GSCM practices, bringing about
various performance improvements. The causal relationship,
based on discussions with management, between these three
factors becomes more evident. Thus, it is our belief that these
relationships will also exist in the broader industry and its sup-
ply chains.

This study is not without its limitations. The sample only
included a convenience sample of organizations. The respon-
dents were not randomly selected. However, it is one of the
few studies that has considered the environmental sustainabil-
ity practices and implications of an emerging economy in the

automobile industry and provides a valuable snapshot of the
situation in China. This initial study calls for a longitudinal
and broad-based investigation to arrive at a more lucid picture
of environmental sustainability practices in the Chinese auto-
motive supply chain.
