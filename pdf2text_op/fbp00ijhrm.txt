The  effect  of  human  resource
management  practices  on   rm
performance  in  Russia

Carl  F.  Fey,  Ingmar  Bj¨orkman  and Antonina  Pavlovskaya

Abstract Based on 101 foreign  rms operating in Russia, the effect of human resource
management (HRM) on  rm performance in Russia is investigated. This is accomplished
by  developing  and  testing  a  model  including  HR  outcomes  (motivation,  retention  and
development) as a mediating variable between HRM practices and  rm performance. Our
study  provides  some  support  for  the  use  of  HRM  outcomes  as  a  mediating  variable
between  HRM  practices  and   rm  performance.  The  results  also  indicate  that  non-
technical  training  and  high  salaries  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  HR  outcomes  for
managers  while  job  security  is  the  most  important  predictor  of  HR  outcomes  for  non-
managerial employees. Thus, our study provides support for the importance of including
both  managers  and  non-managers  in  the  same  study,  but  treating  them  separately.  In
addition,  results indicate  a  direct  positive  relationship  between  managerial  promotions
based on merit and  rm performance for managers and job security and performance for
non-managers.

Keywords Human  resource  management;   rm  performance:  Russia;  multinational
corporations.

The impact of human resource management (HRM) on organizational performance has
emerged as the  dominant  research issue in  the  personnel/HRM  eld,  and  some of  the
initial  results  have  been  promising  (see Becker  and  Gerhart,  1996;  Dyer and  Reeves,
1995;  Guest,  1997  for  recent  reviews).  However,  clearly  the   eld  needs  more
conceptual and empirical work (Becker and Gerhart, 1996). In particular, there is a need
to develop and test a more sophisticated theory of HRM, i.e. what HRM accomplishes
and  how.  Empirically,  most  work  has  been  done  on  the  relationship  between  HRM
practices and measures of  rm ( nancial) performance or market value, and, while there
is a recognition  of the need of studies that include intervening  variables between HRM
practices  and   rm  performance,  few  such  studies  exist  (Becker  and  Gerhart,  1996;
Becker  et  al.  1997;  Guest,  1997).  In  addition,  virtually  all  extant  research  has  been
conducted  in  North  America  on  the  operations  of  domestic   rms.  Hence,  empirical
studies  are  needed  in  other  settings  and  on  the  subsidiaries  of  multinational   rms.

To   ll  this  void,  the  objective  of  this  study  is to  examine  the  relationship  between
HRM  practices  for  managers  and  non-managerial  employees  and  foreign  subsidiary

performance  in  Russia.  Several  authors  have  pointed  to  the  importance  of  HRM  in
Russia  and  provided  anecdotal  discussions  about  HRM  there  (e.g.  Vikhanski  and
Puffer, 1993;  Shekshnia, 1994,  1998;  May, Young, and Ledgerwood, 1998).  Moreover,
Puffer  (1993)  has conducted  a thorough  study  of  one  dimension  of  HRM in  Russia –
compensation  systems,  but  this  study  did  not  explicitly  link  use  of  different
compensation  systems  to   rm  performance.  However,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,
ours  is  the   rst extensive  study  of  HRM  in  the  Russian  context.

Literature  review  and  hypotheses

During  the  last  decade,  the  personnel/HRM   eld  has  shifted  from  a  micro  focus  on
individual  HRM  practices  to  a  debate  on  how  HRM  as  a  more  holistic  management
approach  may  contribute  to  the  competitive  advantage  of  the  organization.  Three
different  perspectives  have  been  used  in  recent  research  on  the  relationship  between
HRM and  organizational  performance: the  effects of  individual  ‘high  performance’ or
‘best’  HRM  practices,  the  effects  of  internally  appropriate  combinations  (‘con gura-
tional   t’)  of  HRM  practices,  and  the  effects  of  appropriate  (‘strategic’)   t  between
strategy and HRM practices (Delery and Doty, 1996). The results obtained to date have
been  mixed,  but  at  least  some  empirical  support  has  been  obtained  for  each  of  the
perspectives.  However,  since few studies  have  included  data on  HR outcomes,  we do
not know much about the causalities involved (Becker and Gerhart, 1996; Becker et al.,
1997;  Guest, 1997).  Therefore, as suggested as badly  needed by Guest (1997),  a major
contribution  of  the  present  study  will  be  to  investigate  the  role  of  HRM  outcomes
(motivation,  retention,  and  capability  development)  as  a  mediating  variable  between
HRM practices  and   rm  performance.

It  has been  proposed  that the HR outcomes competence development  and employee
motivation will meditate the relationship between HRM practices and  rm performance
(Huselid,  1995;  MacDuf e,  1995;  Becker  et  al.,  1997).  In  other  words,  employee
performance  arguably  depends  on  employee  skills  and  competencies  plus  high
motivation: when employees possess high skills and knowledge they are more likely to
help  the  company  perform  well,  and  when  employees  are  motivated  they  are  more
likely  to  contribute  signi cantly  to  the  success of  their  organization.  Research should
therefore examine the extent to which HRM practices contribute to the development of
employee  skills  and  competencies as  well  as  motivation.

However, in  addition  to motivation  and capability  development,  employee  retention
is also likely to be important for  rm performance. Unless the company is able to retain
its employees, it will not be able to capitalize on the human assets developed within the
organization. Employee retention may be particularly important in the Russian context,
where  there  is  a  serious  shortage  of  well-trained  people  and  where  the  turnover  of
strategically  important  staff  who  have  undergone  training  is  a  problem  for  foreign
companies  (Shekshnia,  1994).  Mark  Shaver,  General  Manager  of  Coca  Cola  Russia,
provided  a  typical  view  to  the  authors  in  an  interview  in  Moscow  in  November
1997:

Because there is a shortage of trained workers in Russia, retaining employees is a large
problem  for  all   rms  in  Russia.  We  do  much  better  than  most  of  our  competitors  at
retaining employees, but it is still an issue we are very concerned about. Nobody  wants
to  spend  the  time  and  money  it  takes  to  develop  an  effective employee  and  then  lose
them.

As  a  result  of  the  above,  research  set  in  the  Russian  context  also  needs  to  include
employee  retention  as  a key  HR outcome.

Figure  1 Effects of  HRM  practices on  HRM  outcomes  and   rm  performance

To sum up,  we propose  that  the HR outcomes,  competence development,  employee
motivation and retention together will be in uenced by the HRM practices of the  rm,
and  that  the  HR  outcomes  will  mediate  the  relationship  between  HRM  practices  and
 rm  performance  (Guest,  1997).  Additionally,  there  may  be  a  direct  effect  of  HRM
practices  on   rm  performance.  Figure  1  presents  the  conceptual  framework  for  this
study.

The following  sections will develop hypotheses  concerning  the relationship between
HRM  practices  and  HR  outcomes  as  well  as   rm  performance.  Subsequently,
hypotheses  concerning  other  factors  explaining   rm performance  will  be  developed.

HRM  practices

Several researches have studied the effect of certain individual  HRM practices on  rm
performance (e.g. Delaney and Huselid, 1996;  Koch and McGrath, 1996) or the overall
use  of  high-performance  HRM  practices  (Huselid,  1995;  Koch  and  McGrath,  1996;
Huselid  et al.,  1997).  These studies  have  shown  a positive  relationship  between high-
performance  HRM  practices  and  organizational  performance  outcomes  or   nancial
performance/market value.  However,  there is no clear list  of  ‘high-performance  HRM
practices’ (Pfeffer, 1995; Becker and Gerhart, 1996;  Guest, 1997). In the present study,
we  have  included  HRM  practices  that,  according  to  the  literature,  can  be  expected  to
in uence  the  HR  outcomes  employee  motivation,  skills/knowledge  development  and
retention.

Incentive  systems Most  studies  have  included  performance-based  compensation  as
one of the high-performance HRM practices (e.g. Arthur, 1994; Delery and Doty, 1996;
Huselid,  1995;  MacDuf e,  1995),  and  Delery  and  Doty  (1996)  even  identi ed
performance-based compensation as the single strongest predictor of  rm performance.


4 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

Empirical  studies  on  the  relationship  between  performance-related  pay  and  company
performance  have  generally  found  a  positive  relationship.1 Studies  on  the  market
reaction  to  the  adoption  of  incentive  plans  have  also  reported  positive  stock-market
reactions  (see  Rajagopalan,  1997).  Employee  motivation  is  arguably  a  crucial
intermediate  variable  between  a  performance-based  compensation  system  and   rm
performance. Based on expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964), it can be expected that, if the
company provides rewards desired by the employee in question, this employee is more
likely  to  perform  in  a  way that  will  bring  him/her the  reward.

Company-internal promotions  based on merit rather than seniority may also enhance
employee  motivation  and  employee  retention  (Guest,  1997).  Both  performance-based
compensation  and  merit-based  promotion  can  be  viewed  as  ingredients  in  organiz-
ational incentive systems that serve to encourage individual  performance and retention
(Huselid,  1995).

Job security Companies that provide their employees with job security signal a long-
standing  commitment  to  their  workforce.  As  argued  by  Pfeffer, ‘norms  of  reciprocity
tend  to  guarantee  that  this  commitment  is  repaid.  However,  an  employer  that  signals
through  words  and  deed  that  its  employees  are  dispensable  is  not  likely  to  generate
much loyalty, commitment, or willingness to expend extra effort for the organization’s
bene t’ (1995:  58).  In their  study  on employees in the US banking  sector, Delery and
Doty (1996)  also  found  some support  for  a positive  relationship  between employment
security and  rm performance. The authors attribute the relationship to a higher level of
employee  commitment  and  motivation  in  banks  with  secure  jobs.  Additionally,
employment  security  may  help  align  the  interests  of  employees  and  owners.  Agency
problems  are  reduced  because,  when  job  security  exists,  the  employees,  like
shareholders,  are concerned  about  the  long-term  success of  the   rm.

Employee training and career planning
It can be expected that  rm investments in
both  technical and  non-technical  training  will  have  a positive  impact on  the  extent  to
which  the  rm actually  succeeds in developing  the  skills/knowledge  of its employees.
Given  the  limited  resources  that  all   rms have,  an  important  question  for   rms is  the
appropriate  division  between  technical  and  non-technical  training.  Training  was
included  as  a  high-performance  HRM  practice  in,  among  others,  Huselid  (1995),
MacDuf e  (1995)  and  Koch  and  McGrath  (1996).  Firms  with  superior  training
programmes may also experience lower staff turnover than companies that neglect staff
development.  In   rms  with  good  technical  and  non-technical  training  programmes,
employees are likely to realize that their market value develops more favourably than in
other   rms.  Therefore,  it  is  in  their  own  interest  to  remain  longer  in  the   rm.

Companies  may  use  career  management  programmes  to  assist  their  employees  in
career  planning.  When  the  company  provides  this  service,  one  important  aim  is  to
identify  sequences  of  job  assignments  that  help  employees  gain  the  skills  and
knowledge  viewed  as  important  in  the  company.  A  company  career  planning  system
that functions well may also encourage employees to take more responsibility  for their
own  development,  including  the  development  of  skills  viewed  as  signi cant  in  the
company (Doyle, 1997). It should be noted that a career planning system not only helps
ensure that employees have the skills they need to advance in the company; it may also
help ensure that employees possess the mix of skills that the  rm believes are important
for  its future success. In  other words,  the  provision  of  career planning  assistance may
have  a  positive  effect  on  the  level  and  type  of  skills  and  knowledge  in  the
company.

Decentralization Several  studies  have  identi ed  extensive  use  of  teamwork  and
decentralization  of  decision  making  as  important  high-performance  HRM  practices
(Arthur,  1994;  MacDuf e,  1995;  Pfeffer,  1995).  Both  practices  refer  to  a  non-
hierarchical mode  of  rm operations  that, among other things,  may enhance employee
commitment  to  the  organization.  This  is  consistent  with  research which  suggests  that
employee  participation  can  have  a  statistically  signi cant,  albeit  relatively  small,
positive  effect on  satisfaction  and  performance at  work  (Wagner,  1994).

Internal  promotion The  availability  of  career possibilities  within  the   rm  tends  to
promote a higher degree of organizational commitment among employees (Guest, 1997)
who  perceive career possibilities  with  the   rm.  Additionally,  an emphasis on  internal
promotion is likely to provide a sense of fairness and justice among the employees who
note  that  organizational  tenure  is  valued  in  the  company  (Pfeffer,  1995).  Therefore,
promotion  from  within  is  likely  to  be associated  with  low  employee  turnover.

Complaint  resolution  systems The  existence  of  a  well-functioning  complaint
resolution system may also help alleviate situations of perceived injustice or con icts in
the  company.  Both  the  process  of  handling  the  complaint  and  the  outcome  of  the
process  may  in uence  employee  perceptions  of  how  the   rm  deals  with  the  situation
(Morrison and Robinson,  1997).  To the extent that a complaint is properly handled, the
employee  is  more  likely  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  commitment to  the  organization.
Thus, the introduction  of a system for handling complaints may, in turn, lead to a lower
voluntary  turnover.

People tend to compare their remuneration with other people in the same or a similar
situation.  Paying  high  salaries may have  a  positive  motivational  effect on  employees.
To the extent that company employees perceive that other  rms provide their staff with
higher  salaries,  they  are  more  likely  to  become  dissatis ed  and  possibly  leave  the
company  (Roberts,  1997).  As  argued  earlier in  this  paper,  the  problem  of  retention  is
particularly acute in Russia, and paying salaries that are higher than those paid by other
prospective  employers  is  likely  to  be  one  way  to  alleviate this  problem.

As  a  result  of  the  above,  the  following  hypotheses  will  be  tested in  this  paper:

Hypothesis 1:

The  use  of  individual  performance-based  incentives  is  positively
related  to  a)  HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm performance.

Hypothesis 2:

The  use  of  employee  merit  rather  than  seniority  as  the  basis  for
promotion  is  positively  related  to  a)  HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm
performance.

Hypothesis 3:

The presence of job security is positively related to a) HR outcomes
and  b)   rm  performance.

Hypothesis 4:

An emphasis on providing  technical training is positively  related to
a) HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm  performance.

Hypothesis 5:

An  emphasis  on  providing  non-technical  training  is  positively
related  to  a)  HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm performance.

Hypothesis 6:

The extent of career planning provided is positively related to a) HR
outcomes  and  b)   rm  performance.

Hypothesis 7:

A  positive  relationship  exists  between  decentralization  of  decision
making  and  a)  HR outcomes  and  b)   rm performance.

Hypothesis 8:

A  positive  relationship  exists  between  an  emphasis  on  internal
promotion  and  a)  HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm performance.

Hypothesis 9:

A  positive  relationship  exists  between  the  use  of  complaint
resolution  systems  and  a)  HR  outcomes  and  b)   rm performance.

Hypothesis 10: A  positive  relationship  exists  between  higher  salaries  and  a)  HR

outcomes  and  b)   rm  performance.

Firm  performance
HR  outcomes The  HR  outcomes  are,  in  turn,  expected  to  explain  some  of  the
variance  in   rm  performance  (Becker  et al.,  1997;  Guest,  1997).  Thus,  the  following
hypothesis  will  be  tested:

Hypothesis 11: A  positive  relationship  exists  between  HR  outcomes  and   rm

performance.

HRM-strategy  alignment Scholars  have  suggested  that  a  good   t  between  HR
strategies and the business strategy of the  rm tends to lead to superior outcomes (e.g.
Delery and Doty,  1996).  In  other words,  when  the  company’s HRM practices support
 rm  strategy,  superior  performance  is  expected.  Empirically,  the  Miles  and  Snow
(1978, 1984) or Porter (1980) strategic types have been used to classify  rm strategies.
Research  has  provided  some,  although  not  entirely  consistent,  support  for  a  positive
strategic   t  effect.

The relatively weak support for the effects of strategic  t on organizational outcomes
should come as no big surprise as it is very dif cult to specify what constitutes good  t
in research across  rms and industries (Becker and Gerhart, 1996). In fact, the resource-
based  view  (Barney,  1991)  suggests  that  the  appropriate  con gurational  and  strategic
alignment  of HRM practices may be idiosyncratic  and  complex. Even  if  the resource-
based  view  deals  with  sustained competitive  advantages,  as  opposed  to  competitive
advantages, the above properties may be involved  also in the latter case. Furthermore,
the whole idea of ‘ t’ with a certain strategy ‘seems inappropriate for a world in which
there  are  high  levels  of  dynamic  and  unpredictable  change’  (Hiltrop,  1996:  630).
Therefore, instead of examining the statistical relationship between HRM practices and
measures of  rm generic strategies, it may be more appropriate to analyse the degree to
which  companies  actively  pursue  the  alignment  of  strategy  and  HRM  practices.  This
approach enables researchers to collect data on the process of alignment, i.e. the extent
to  which  there  is  an  on-going  con gurational  strategic  alignment  of  HRM  in  an  area
which  is  constantly  changing  (Mabey  and  Salaman,  1995).  Therefore,  the  following
hypothesis  will  be  tested:

Hypothesis 12: The more closely HRM practices are aligned with  rm strategy, the

better the   rm  performance.

Methodology

Sample
A list of 395 foreign  rms operating in Russia was constructed based on lists of Finnish,
Swedish, US, German and British  rms operating in Russia. To be part of the list  rms

had to  be active, have  at least  fteen employees, have been  operating  in Russia for at
least  three  years  and  be  located  in  Moscow  or  St  Petersburg  (Russia’s  two  largest
cities). Joint ventures with at least 80 per cent foreign ownership were treated as foreign
 rms for this study since in practice it has been found that they tend to be managed as
wholly  foreign-owned  subsidiaries  (Makino,  1995).

Contact  was made  with  a human  resource manager or  senior  manager in  each   rm
and the project was explained. Because of considerable fear of anonymous  researchers
in Russia (likely  a result of a desire for secrecy following  communism), in most cases
a personal meeting was arranged with the manager to explain  the project further, learn
more about  the  respondent’s  rm and  HRM practices, and  get  the  questionnaire   lled
out.  In some cases questionnaires  were simply faxed to the manager. Non-respondents
were reminded by telephone  three times to complete the questionnaire.  In cases where
the questionnaire had not been received after three telephone calls, additional copies of
the questionnaire and reminder letter were faxed to the respondent, followed by a  nal
follow-up  telephone call. This process resulted in 101  responses, representing a 25 per
cent response  rate, which  is good  for  a  challenging  environment  like  Russia.

Among  the  respondents  were  thirty-eight  HRM  managers  and  sixty-three  senior
managers. Seven T tests were used to investigate the difference between means for the
subsamples  of  HRM  managers  and  senior  managers  for  the  HRM  outcome  variables
and   rm  performance.  Because  no  signi cant  differences  were  uncovered,  the  two
subgroups  were combined  in  the  analysis  that  follows.

The  participating   rms  were from a variety  of  foreign  countries:  33  from USA, 29
from Sweden,  21  from  Finland,  9  from  Germany  and  9  from Britain.  Seven  one-way
analyses  of  variance  were  conducted  to  test  for  the  possible  differences  in  means
between the subsamples of  rms from different foreign countries for the HRM outcome
variables and  rm performance. No signi cant differences were found.  As a result, the
 rms from  different  foreign  countries  were combined  into  one  sample  in  the  analysis
that  follows.  The  participating   rms  also  varied  in  size  with  forty  having  15–49
employees,  seventeen  having  50–99  employees,  twelve  having  100–199  employees,
twenty-two  having  200–999  employees  and  ten  having  1000  or  more  employees.

Questionnaire  construction

Whereas most previous studies have evaluated HRM practices for the entire  rm or one
selected  group  of  employees  only,  in  this  research  we  studied  HRM  practices  and
outcomes  separately  for  managers  and  other  employees.  At  the  same  time,  as  our
objective was to obtain data from a large number of foreign companies in Russia, it was
essential  to  keep  the  questionnaire  as  short  as  possible.  We  therefore  decided  to  use
single-item  measures  of  the  constructs.  While  this  prevented  us  from  being  able  to
analyse the data using  structural equation  modelling  techniques  like LISREL and PLS,
we did manage to collect data from more  rms in Russia than any other study of which
we  are aware.

The  questionnaire  was  pretested on  a sample of   ve  managers in  Russia and  slight
adjustments were made as a result. The questionnaire  was then translated into  Russian
using  a thorough  translation-back  translation  procedure.

Independent  variables

Based  on  an  extensive  review  of  the  HRM literature,  a  list  of  items  was  compiled  to
describe HRM practices that  rms used. Drawing on, among others, the questions in the
research instrument used by Huselid (1995),  the respondents  in the present study  were


8 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

“to a little extent” and 5 5

asked: ‘to what extent are each of the following  human resource management practices
used  in  your   rm  for  i)  managers  (excluding  expatriates)  and  ii)  other  employees.
Please choose a number between 1 and 5, where 1 5
“to a
great extent”.’ It  should  be  noted  that  our  scales had  different  anchors  than  Huselid’s
did.  The  following  HRM  practices  were included:  ‘Individual  performance  appraisals
help determine compensation;  assisting employees in  career planning;  decentralization
of decision making; complaint resolution system; employee merit, not seniority, used to
determine  promotion;  emphasis  on  providing 
technical  training  for  employees;
emphasis  on  providing  non-technical  training  for  employees.’  Also  job  security  was
measured  through  a   ve-point  subjective  measurement scale (‘Managers  in  your   rm
feel  their  jobs  are  secure’  and  ‘Other  employees  in  your   rm  feel  their  jobs  are
secure’).

To measure the alignment of HRM practices and strategy the respondents were asked
to  respond  to  the  following  statement:  ‘your   rm  conducts  a  formal  analysis  to
determine  how  best  to  adjust  human  resource  management  practices  to   t  with   rm
strategy’, with  responses  ranging  on  a  ve-point  scale from  ‘not  at all’ (1)  ‘to  a great
extent’  (5).

Dependent  variables

The  HR  outcomes  were  measured  using   ve-point  subjective  scales  ranging  from  1
(poor) to 5 (excellent). Delaney and Huselid (1996) have previously used similar scales.
The  respondents  were  asked  to  evaluate  their   rm’s  performance  in:  ‘developing
managers’ skills/knowledge;  developing  non-managerial employees’ skills/knowledge;
motivating  managers;  motivating  non-managerial  employees;  retaining  managers;
retaining  non-managerial  employees’.  The  scales  for  each  of  the  HR  outcomes
competence development, employee motivation and retention were then combined into
a single scale. These three HR outcomes were combined into a single scale because they
were highly  correlated (the alpha for managers was 0.747,  while it was 0.733  for non-
managers).

The  primary  performance  measure of   rm  performance  was  a   ve-point  subjective
“poor” and
managerial assessment (‘How is your  rm’s overall performance where 1 5
5  5
“outstanding”?’).  This  measure is  desirable  for  two  reasons.  First,  since  Russian
accounting standards are still emerging,  rms use different accounting standards which
makes it virtually impossible to obtain comparable  nancial information. Second, since
foreign companies operating in Russia have diverse goals (e.g. gain market share, learn
about the market, make short-term pro t, etc.), it is inappropriate to compare the short-
term  nancial performance of  rms with differing  goals. A subjective measure of  rm
performance enables the managers to factor the  rm’s goals when assessing the  rm’s
performance.  While  it  is  true  that  perceptual  data  may  introduce  limitations  through
increased  measurement  error  and  the  potential  for  mono-method  bias,  the  bene ts
outweigh  the  risks.  Further,  there  is  precedent  for  using  such  measures  in  similar
research  (e.g.  Delaney  and  Huselid,  1996;  Youndt  et  al.,  1996).  Additionally,  prior
research has  shown  that  subjective  measures of   rm  performance  correlate  well  with
objective  measures of   rm performance  (Geringer  and  Hebert,  1991;  Powell,  1992).
Data  were  also  collected  on  two  other  measures  of   rm  performance  –  a  six-item
subjective performance scale measuring  different  dimensions  of   rm performance and
an  industry-speci c  subjective  measure  of  performance.  However,  since  these  two
measures of  rm performance were highly correlated at greater than .60 with the single-


Fey  et  al.:  Effect  of  HRM practices  on   rm performance  in  Russia

9

item  subjective  general  measure of   rm  performance,  it  was  decided  to  use  only  this
measure of   rm  performance.

The  data

Since  rms in the sample were from a variety of manufacturing  and service industries,
industry  was controlled  for. Information  on industry  classi cation, largely correspond-
ing  to  two  digit  SIC  codes,  was  collected.  Industries  that  had  fewer  than   ve
respondents  were  combined  into  ‘other  manufacturing’  or  ‘other  services’  to  save
degrees  of  freedom  in  the  analysis.  As  a  result,  dummy  variables  for  SIC6  (food,
tobacco and textile), 7 (wood, wood products, pulp and paper) 9 (other manufacturing),
10  (computer  services), 13 (banking,  insurance  and  real estate) and 18  (wholesale and
retail trade) were included in the analyses. SIC19 (other services) was omitted from the
analysis so that the models would not be overdetermined. When all models were re-run
with SIC19 in and SIC18 removed, SIC19 was not signi cant in any of the models (not
reported  here).

The  number  of  years that  a  rm has operated  in  Russia might  also  in uence HRM
outcomes and  rm performance. Companies with more experience in Russia may have
gone through  a learning process concerning how to operate in the Russian context, and
a positive relationship may exist between  rm experience in Russia and HRM outcomes
as  well  as   rm  performance.  Therefore,  the  number  of  years  that  the   rm  had  been
operating  in  Russia  was  included  as a  control  variable.

Finally,  rm size was controlled for. The log of the number of employees was taken

so  that  a  few  large   rms  would  not  affect the  results  disproportionately.

Tables  1A  and  1B  provide  the  means,  standard  deviations  and  bivariate  Pearson
correlations for the main variables used in the regression equations.  Interaction effects
of various independent variables were also investigated. However, including interaction
effects led  to  sign  changes  in  coef cients and  other  strange  behaviour,  indicating  that
we  did  not  have  enough  observations  to  test  interaction  effects (Greene,  1997).  As  a
result,  in  the  analysis  that  follows  we  will  not  present  any  models  with  interaction
effects.  Path  analysis  (Alwin  and  Hauser,  1975)  was  used  to  analyse  our  data  and
investigate  the  importance  of  including  a  mediating  variable  ‘HR  outcomes’  in  our
model.

Results

The  regression results on  HR outcomes indicate  that only  one of  the control  variables
signi cantly  affected  HR  outcomes  (see  models  1  and  2  in  Table  2):   rm  size  is
negatively  related with HR outcomes for managers, but  not for other employees. Both
the  regression  model  for  managers  and  that  for  non-managers  were  statistically
signi cant,  with  adjusted  R2 of  0.467  and  0.245  respectively.

For  managers,  non-technical  training  and  salary  level  of  the   rm  are  positively
related with increased HR outcomes (motivation, retention and capability development).
The  fact that  non-technical  training  was  a  determinant  of  HR  outcomes  for  managers
but  was only  marginally  signi cant (p,
.10)  for  non-managers is understandable  since
the skills learned in non-technical training tend to play a larger role in managers’ work
than in other employees’ daily activities. Thus,  they should  have a larger in uence on
managerial  employees’  development.  Furthermore,   rms  with  an  extensive  non-
technical  training  programme,  the  type  of  training  much  in  demand  in  Russia  today
(Shekshnia,  1994),  are  more  likely  to  retain  their  managers  since  these  managers  are
eager to increase their knowledge.  In fact, in a series of forty  interviews conducted by

12 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

the  authors  of  this  paper  in  the  autumn  of 1999,  managers were willing  to  give up  an
average of $1100  of  a one-time bonus  to attend a one-week training  programme.  This
is  remarkable  since  most  of  the  managers  interviewed  had  monthly  salaries  ranging
from $600  to  $1500.  Compared  with  the  situation  for  non-managers,  it  is more likely
that a well-functioning labour market exist for managers. Managerial employees tend to
have  more  job  options  and  be  more  mobile  than  non-managerial  employees,  and
compensation  is likely  to be one  of  the  factors determining  whether  managers change
from  one  employer  to  another.  Therefore,  paying  high  salaries  may  not  only  have  a
positive  motivational  effect  but  may  also  discourage  managers  from  leaving  the
company.  Decentralization  of  decision-making  authority  was  also  signi cantly  pos-
itively  related  to  increased  HRM  outcomes  (motivation,  retention,  etc.).  This  makes
sense  because  most  managers  like  being  empowered  and,  in  addition,  empowering
middle managers enables a  rm to be more responsive and take better advantage of the

knowledge  of  all  members  of  its  organization,  making  that   rm  a  more  ef cient  and
enjoyable  place  to  work.

Job  security  was  the  key  determinant  of  HR  outcomes  for  non-managers.  Thus,  it
appears that non-managerial employees, who are in great abundance given the high real
unemployment in Russia, place a premium on job  security. In other words, they would
probably  prefer a slightly  lower  xed salary to an uncertain salary which is likely,  but
not de nitely to be higher. Russians’ preference for job security is understandable given
that  they  have  extremely  high  uncertainty  avoidance  (Naumov,  1996).

The results of the regression equations on  rm performance are reported in Table 3.
These  regression  models  were  also  signi cant.  No  control  variable  was  statistically
signi cant.  The  salary  levels  of  both  managers  and  non-managers  were  signi cantly
related with  rm performance. The causality here is somewhat unclear. It is conceivable

that   rms  that  perform  well  are  in  a  better  position  to  pay  both  managers  and  non-
managers high  salaries. However,  the  path  analysis  reported  in  Table  5  indicates  that,
for  managers,  salary  level  is  a  signi cant  predictor  of  HR  outcomes  which  in  turn
contributes to explaining   rm performance. In other words, there is some indication  of
an  indirect  effect of  managerial  salary level  on   rm  performance.

For managers, the existence of a merit-based promotion system was also signi cantly
related  with   rm  performance.  This  is  understandable  given  that  most  managers  are
very career driven. For non-managers, who are less career driven and instead are more
concerned  about  having  a  stable  job,  job  security  was  a  direct  determinant  of   rm
performance.

One  of  the  key  questions  examined  in  this  paper  is  the  possible  existence  of  HR
outcomes  as  a  mediating  variable  between  HRM  practices  and   rm  performance
(hypothesis  11). Adding the HR outcome variable to the models increased the adjusted
R2 for  both  managers  and  non-managers.  However,  HR  outcome  was  statistically
signi cant only  for managers. Path  analyses (see Tables 4  and 5)  further  indicate that
the  indirect  path  from  various  HRM  practices  through  HR  outcomes  to   rm
performance  is  substantively  signi cant  for  managers  but  not  for  non-managers.

Fey  et  al.:  Effect  of  HRM practices  on   rm performance  in  Russia

15

Perhaps  this  is  the  case  because  it  is  more  important  for  a   rm  that  managers  (as
opposed to non-managers) are retained by the  rm, well-motivated and well-trained (the
components  of HR outcomes). If a  rm has managers who are retained, motivated and
well-trained,  it  appears  that  the   rm  is  more  capable  of  dealing  with  workers  of  any
type than if the reverse situation were to exist. Hence, partial support was obtained  for
hypothesis  11.

It is also important to note that no support  was provided  for HRM practice–strategy
 t being  an important determinant of  rm performance (hypothesis  12).  As previously
mentioned,  the  literature  has  included  considerable  debate  about  the  effect  of  a   t
between  HRM practices  and  strategy  on   rm  performance.

A  summary  of  the  hypotheses  that  received  support  is  reported  in  Table  6.

Conclusions

This  paper  adds  to  previous  work  in  the   eld  by  testing  a  model  that  includes  HR
outcome  (motivation,  retention  and  development)  as  a  mediating  variable  between
HRM  practices  and   rm  performance.  The  paper  also  contributes  by  breaking  HRM
practices  into  HRM  practices  for  managers  and  HRM  practices  for  non-managerial
employees (and including  both in the same study).  An additional strength of this study
is that  it  moves beyond  the  US context  where most previous  HRM research has been
conducted  and  is  instead  based  on  a  large  sample  (101  foreign   rms)  in  the  Russian
context  where  very  few  systematic  managerial  studies  of  any  type  have  been
conducted.

The paper has several key conclusions, which should be of interest to academics and
managers. Perhaps  most signi cantly,  our  study  provides  some  support  for  the  use  of

HR outcomes  as a mediating  variable  between HRM  practices and   rm  performance.
Thus,  our  research suggests  that  a  model  which  depicts  a  direct  relationship  between
HRM practices and  rm performance is too simplistic and does not show the causalities
involved. This addresses the call of Becker and Gerhart (1996) and Guest (1997) to test
models  with  mediating  variables such  as  HRM  outcomes.  However,  in  our  study  HR
outcomes was substantive  as a mediating variable mainly for managers, while there is
little indication  of such a path for non-managers.  Further  research is clearly warranted
on  this  topic.

This  study  presents evidence  that  providing  non-technical  training  and  having  high
salaries were found  to  be  positively  associated  with  HR  outcomes  for  managers.  Job
security  was  a  strong  predictor  of  HR  outcomes  for  non-managerial  employees.  In
addition,  there was a direct positive relationship between managerial promotions  based
on  merits and   rm performance.

This study  has demonstrated that different HRM policies are optimal for managerial
and non-managerial employees. As a result, future studies are urged to investigate HRM
practices for  both  groups  of  employees  separately  (but  in  the  same study)  rather  than
lumping  both  groups  together  as  many  previous  studies  have  done.

Salary  level  was  revealed  to  be  signi cantly  associated  with   rm  performance  for
both managers and non-managers in our study. In addition,  promoting  managers based
on merit was positively associated with  rm performance while ensuring job security of
non-managerial  employees  was  a  key  non-managerial  determinant  of   rm  per-
formance.

Our hypotheses were developed based on existing HRM theories that were primarily
developed in the USA. As can be seen from Table 6, only some of our hypotheses were
supported  in  this  study.  The  hypotheses  that  were  supported  indicate  which  HRM
practices are most critical in the Russian context. One possible interpretation of the fact
that not all hypotheses were supported  is that HRM theories need some adjustment for
national  contexts.  As  a  result,  additional  future  research  in  non-US  settings  is  likely
to  be  helpful  in  advancing  our  understanding  of  the  effects  of  HRM  on   rm
performance.

Like all research, this study has some limitations which future research can build on.
This  paper  begins  to  explore  the  question  of  causality.  However,  causality  can  only
really  be  tested  with  data  collected  at  different  points  in  time.  Thus,  the   eld  would
greatly  bene t from some time-series studies  in  the  future.  In addition,  a weakness of
this study is that all data are collected from a single source. Future studies are urged to
have different people/sources evaluate a  rm’s performance and HRM practices. Future
studies  are  also  urged  to  try  to  minimize  the  use  of  single-item  scales. Finally,  if  the
appropriate  data  exist,  it  would  be  interesting  to  use  a  modern  causal  modelling
technique  like  LISREL  or  PLS  for  analysis  in  future  studies.
