 Previous research has found that product recall announcements in the automobile industry
 are associated with negative abnormal returns. We extend this research by examining
 announcements of product recalls and products taken off the market outside the automobile
 industry. We find negative abnormal returns for these announcements and that the returns
 are significantly more negative when products are replaced (or the purchase price is returned)
 than when the products are checked and repaired. We find only limited evidence that
 government-ordered recalls produce more negative returns than voluntary recalls.

 There is debate in the literature over the size of
 the stock market's reaction to product recall
 announcements. Jarrell and Peltzman (1985)
 find automobile recalls to be associated with
 significantly negative abnormal stock returns and
 argue that shareholder losses would encourage
 managers to refrain from selling significantly
 defective products. On the other hand, Bromiley
 and Marcus (1989) find smaller negative returns
 and argue that the stock market response is too
 small to provide a sufficient deterrent. Both
 studies, however, are based on product recalls
 in the automotive industry. Automobile defect
 recalls occur so frequently that the security
 markets likely anticipate the probable long run
 effects of a recall announcement on cashflow,
 risk, and value, so the impact of a specific
 announcement may have only a small effect.
 Correcting for some of the methodological
 problems in earlier research, Hoffer et al. (1988)
 show that abnormal returns for automobile recalls
 may be statistically insignificant. In the only
 study to date that looks at nonautomotive recalls,
 Pruitt and Peterson (1986) find a statistically

 significant negative abnormal return associated
 with recall announcements. This previous
 research has considered all recalls to be homo-
 geneous. However, recalls may vary considerably
 in their information content so further research
 on recalls is warranted.

 We examine the information content of product
 recalls by measuring the stock market reaction
 to recalls that occur in industries other than the
 automobile industry. We compare the information
 content of various types of recall and product-
 related announcements (e.g. recalls to replace a
 product vs. recalls to repair a product; govern-
 ment-ordered recalls vs. voluntary recalls; recalls
 vs. products taken off the market).

 In relating stock price behavior to a manage-
 ment activity, we are responding to the calls
 to establish closer research relationships on
 problems where organizational economics and
 strategic management interface (Barney, 1990;
 Bettis, 1983; Hesterly et al., 1990; Jemison, 1981;
 Oviatt, 1988; Peavy, 1984). Stock price behavior is
 increasingly recognized as an important strategic
 variable (Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986; Rappa-
 port, 1981). Stock price is important strategically
 since it affects raising money in the capital markets
 and fighting predators and because stockholders

 are an important constituency. Further, it is
 important to relate stock price behavior to identifi-
 able cases of management success or failure
 (product recalls, in our case). Application of event
 methodology is one way to do this. The approach
 was suggested first by Cochran and Wood (1984),
 and it has since been employed by others such as
 Davidson and Worrell (1988).

 or cost refund, or they can simply provide notice
 to repair or check the condition of a product.
 We expect that announcements that replace a
 product or refund the purchase price will be
 more costly and will provide a more negative
 signal to the market than those notifying of the
 need for repair or a check of a product. The
 specific hypothesis is as follows:

 RESEARCH ISSUES

 Jarrell and Peltzman (1985) stated that negative
 abnormal returns associated with recalls will act
 as a deterrent to a manager knowingly producing
 substandard products. Bromiley and Marcus
 (1989) question this contention in part because
 they find the abnormal returns associated with
 automobile recalls to be smaller than found by
 Jarrell and Peltzman. Due to the measurement
 problems associated with automobile recalls, it
 is necessary to look beyond the automobile
 industry. Thus, we test whether non-automobile
 recalls are associated with abnormal returns.

 We extend earlier research by examining the
 information content of recall announcements.
 There is considerable evidence that suggests that
 different types of announcements provide the
 security market with varying signals (Ross, 1977;
 Myers and Majluf, 1984). Recalls can either be
 for product replacement or cost refund, or they
 can be to simply repair or examine a product.
 Recalls can be voluntary, or they can be ordered
 by the government. In addition to recalls,
 products are sometimes taken off the market.
 Each of these types of announcements may
 contain different information so the stock market
 may react differently to them.

 This study examines the abnormal returns
 associated with nonautomobile product recall
 announcements. Given that a recall is generally
 expensive to conduct, we would expect the firm's
 value to be negatively affected. There also may
 be a loss in consumer confidence that could affect
 future cashflows and further reduce value. This
 suggests the first hypothesis:

 Hypothesis 1: Product recall announcements
 will be associated with negative abnormal stock
 returns.

 Recalls can either be for product replacement

 Hypothesis 2: The abnormal returns associ-
 ated with recall announcements that replace the
 product or returtn the purchase price will be
 more negative than those that announce a repair
 or check of a product.

 Signaling may also depend upon who initiated
 the recall. We test the difference between
 government-ordered vs. voluntary recall
 announcements. A government-ordered recall
 would include any recall specifically ordered by
 the federal or state government or one of their
 agencies. A voluntary recall is one coming
 specifically from the producer of the product. A
 voluntary recall may actually reassure consumers
 that the company willingly stands behind its
 products, while a government-ordered recall may
 provide the opposite signal. A government-
 ordered recall may also signal that the product is
 so defective that the government had to step in to
 correct the situation. We expect that the stock
 market will react more negatively to government-
 ordered recalls than voluntary recalls.

 Hypothesis 3: Government-ordered recall
 announcements will be associated with signifi-
 cantly more negative abnormal returns than
 voluntary recall announcements.

 Other kinds of product problem announce-
 ments may have similar effects, as in cases in
 which products are taken off the market. When
 products are taken off the market, the firm
 agrees to no longer sell the item, but no mention
 of recalling previously sold products is made.
 These announcements imply a reduction in future
 revenues for the firm, so we expect the market
 to react negatively to these announcements. We
 hypothesize that:

 Hypothesis 4: There will be negative abnormal
 returns associated with the announcements that
 products are taken off the market.

 Product recalls have at least two potential
 costs. The first is the direct cost of the recall,
 and the second is the reduction in future revenues
 from the bad publicity of the announcement.
 Announcements of products taken off the market
 will not entail specific recall costs, but will have
 the potential for reduction in future revenues.

 When products are taken off the market there
 will be bad publicity and a reduction of future
 revenues because of lost sales. The loss of future
 revenues should reduce the firm's expected
 cashflows and its intrinsic value, and there should
 be negative abnormal stock returns as a result.
 On the other hand, revenue may decline sub-
 sequent to a recall announcement from the
 negative publicity, but when products are taken
 off the market we expect that revenue may
 decline even more because the product cannot
 be sold.'

 Hypothesis 5: The stock market will react
 more negatively to announcements of products
 taken off the market than to recall announce-
 ments.

 THE DATA

 We located announcements of product recalls
 and products taken off the market by examining
 the Wall Street Journal Index over the 20-year
 period 1968 through 1987. To be included in our
 sample, the common stock of the recalling
 company had to be listed on either the New York
 or American Stock Exchange. This restriction
 permits the use of the CRSP (Center for Research
 in Security Prices at the University of Chicago)
 tapes for stock return data. We eliminated any
 recall or problem product announcements in
 the automobile industry. (There were more
 automobile recalls from the 'Big Three' producers
 than for all other announcements in our sample
 combined.)

 We also eliminated any announcements made
 when the Wall Street Journal printed any other

 ' An example of this kind of announcement includes the
 removal of three-wheel all-terrain vehicles from the market
 for future sales because the government determined that they
 were extremely dangerous. However, previously sold three-
 wheel ATV's were not recalled.

 Research Notes and Communications 469

 article about the company over the interval -1
 to 1. This restriction helps to reduce the chance
 that our data are contaminated or biased by
 other contemporaneous announcements. We
 include only the first announcement for a
 particular product. For example, if there is
 negative publicity about the problem causing the
 recall or elimination from the market in the Wall
 Street Journal or a product lawsuit prior to the
 recall announcement, we do not include this
 company in our sample.

 Finally, we found 28 recall announcements by
 tire manufacturers, 22 of them made by three
 companies. While this number does not create
 as big a problem as that of the automobile
 industry, there was still a problem with overlap-
 ping event dates. Therefore, we eliminated these
 firms from consideration.

 Our final sample includes 133 nonautomobile
 or tire industry recalls. Of these announcements,
 112 were to replace the product (or return the
 pu-rchase price), and 21 were for product repairs.
 Because announcements often conflicted, in some
 cases it was impossible to determine who initiated
 the various recalls. For example, some recalls
 were called 'voluntary' even though a government
 agency apparently had initiated an earlier investi-
 gation. In these cases, or in other ambiguous
 cases, we eliminated these recalls from consider-
 ation in the recall-origin tests. Consequently, we
 found only 31 government-ordered recalls and
 20 voluntary recalls, but since the ambiguous
 cases were deleted from consideration, we are
 confident of the origin in these cases. We found
 an additional 27 instances of problem products
 taken off the market with no apparent recall of
 the previously sold products.

 METHODOLOGY

 We use the standard event time methodology to
 measure the prediction errors in the study.
 Since this procedure is fairly standard, we only
 summarize it here. An appendix is available from
 the authors which contains the details and
 equations of the approach.

 Using daily security return data, we estimate
 the market model parameters from day -291 to
 day -91 in relationship to the initial Wall Street
 Journal announcement on day 0. We compute
 daily prediction errors for each company for each

 day over the event time -90 to 90. These daily
 prediction errors can be averaged cross-sectionally
 and summed across various subintervals of time
 to compute mean cumulative prediction errors
 (MCPEs). We use the test statistics described in
 Dodd and Warner (1983) to determine if the
 MCPEs are significantly different from zero.

 RESULTS

 Table 1 contains the MCPE results for the recall
 announcements. For each interval the first
 number in the column is the MCPE, and the test
 statistic appears underneath in parentheses. For
 this total sample of 133 recalls, the MCPE
 on day -1 is -0.0036 (Z = -2.93) which is
 significant at the 0.001 level. The MCPEs on
 days 0 and 1 are insignificantly negative, but a
 combined 3-day MCPE over the announcement
 interval -1 to 1 is -0.0068 (Z = -2.80) and is
 statistically significant at the 0.001 level. These
 results support Hypothesis 1 because the market
 reacts negatively at the time of the recall
 announcements. The announcement effect
 appears to be confined primarily to the 3-
 day announcement period interval because the
 MCPEs for all other test intervals are insignifi-
 cantly different from zero.

 In the next set of columns we provide statistics
 to test the second hypothesis by comparing the
 MCPEs for recalls that replace the product (or
 return the purchase price) with those that simply
 repair and/or check a product. For the 112
 replacements, the MCPE for day -1 is -0.0040
 (Z = -2.77) and for the interval - 1 to 1 is
 -0.0078 (Z = -3.02). These results are signifi-
 cant at the 0.001 level. For the 21 cases of
 repair/check recalls none of the MCPEs is
 statistically significant.

 In the next column we directly compare the
 two types of recalls. Over every interval (except
 day 1) the replacement recalls are nominally
 more negative than the repair/check recalls. This
 difference is statistically significant on day 0 and
 over the interval -1 to 1 at the 0.05 level.2 As
 Hypothesis 2 predicts, the announcement period

 2 We use a one-tailed test of significance in these tests for
 consistency in the table. As we have hypothesized the
 direction of the difference, a one-tailed test may be more
 appropriate than a two-tailed test.

 MCPEs are more negative for the replace or
 refund recalls than for those recalls that only
 repair or check the product.

 In the next set of three columns in Table 1,
 we test Hypothesis 3 by comparing government-
 ordered recalls to voluntary recalls. For the
 31 government-ordered recalls, the MCPE is
 significant on several days and intervals. On day
 -1 the MCPE is -0.0042 (Z = -2.12), and on
 day 1 the MCPE is -0.0064 (Z = -2.26). Both
 MCPEs are significant at the 0.05 level. Over
 the interval -1 to 1 the MCPE is -0.0120
 (Z = -2.73), which is significant at the 0.01
 level. For the government-ordered recalls the
 entire test interval -90 to 90 has an MCPE of
 -0.0704 (Z = -2.26), but most of this MCPE
 occurs during the announcement period and
 during the 90 days subsequent to the announce-
 ment. Over the interval - 1 to 90, which is
 the combined announcement period and post-
 announcement period (not shown in the table)
 the MCPE is -0.0519 (Z = -2.03) and is
 statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The
 government-ordered recall firms lose over 5% of
 their value during the announcement period and
 the subsequent time period.

 For the strictly voluntary recalls, only the
 MCPE over the -1 to 1 interval is statistically
 significant at conventional significance levels. It
 is -0.0112 (Z = -1.83), which is significant at
 the 0.05 level.

 While the government-ordered recalls are
 associated with statistically significant negative
 abnormal returns, and the voluntary recalls have
 only marginally significant results, the difference
 between the samples is not statistically significant
 over most of the intervals despite the nominal
 difference in MCPE size. Only over the interval
 -90 to -10 do the government-ordered recalls
 produce significantly more negative MCPEs than
 do the voluntary recalls. Since these differences
 are rarely significant, the results provide only
 very limited support for Hypothesis 3. The only
 support for the hypothesis is that the government-
 ordered recalls do produce significant results,
 while voluntary recalls do not.

 The Table's last set of columns provide statistics
 to test Hypothesis 4 and Hypothesis 5. These
 columns show the MCPE results for the 27 cases
 where products were taken off the market with
 no apparent recall of previously sold products.
 The MCPEs are significantly negative on day

 -1, on day 1, and over the interval -1 to 1. The
 3-day announcement period MCPE is -0.0238
 (Z = -4.54), and is significant at better than the
 0.001 level. In 3 days these firms lose more than
 2.3 percent of their value which provides support
 for Hypothesis 4.

 In a recall, the company generally replaces the
 problem item while, despite negative publicity,
 it may continue to sell the product. When a
 product is taken off the market, the company
 loses all future revenues from the product and
 may suffer adverse publicity as well. Comparison
 of the MCPE results of the products taken off
 the market to the total recall sample reveals that
 the market reacts more negatively to products
 being taken off the market. The differences in
 the MCPEs over the interval -1 to 1 and on
 day -1 are significant at the 0.001 level. This
 evidence supports Hypothesis 5.

 DISCUSSION

 In this study, we examine the stock market's
 reaction to announcements of product recalls and
 to announcements of products taken off the
 market. The study is more than just a test of
 stock market efficiency. It relates stock prices,
 an important strategic variable (Lubatkin and
 Shrieves, 1986; Rappaport, 1981) to a measure
 of management failure (product recalls).

 Unlike most of the previous product-recall
 research (Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Jarrell and
 Peltzman, 1985; Hoffer et al., 1987) we examine
 only recalls that occur in other than the auto-
 mobile or tire industry. Our results indicate
 that the stock market reacts significantly and
 negatively to recall announcements.

 In addition, this manuscript extends the prior
 recall research in several ways. First, we compared
 those recalls that replaced the product (or
 returned the purchase price) to those that
 only repaired or checked the product. We
 hypothesized and found that the abnormal returns
 associated with those that replace the product or
 return the purchase price are more negative than
 those that repair or check the product. Second,
 we compared government-ordered recalls to those
 undertaken voluntarily by the company. We
 hypothesized that the stock market would react
 more negatively to government-ordered recalls,
 but found only limited support for this hypothesis.

 Finally, we examined the cases in which products
 are taken off the market, but not recalled.
 Our results show that the market reacts more
 negatively to these announcements than it does
 to recall announcements. A product recall implies
 a reduction in future revenues because of bad
 publicity in addition to the direct cost of
 conducting the recall. The announcements for
 products taken off the market have only the
 reduction in future revenues since there are no
 recall costs. Because the announcements for
 products taken off the market have larger
 negative returns than the recalls, we conclude
 that it is the negative publicity accompanied by
 the potential reduction in future revenues from
 lost sales that accounts for this market reaction.
 These findings could indicate one of two things.
 First, if we assume that either knowingly or
 unknowingly producing and selling defective
 products is an example of corporate social
 irresponsibility, the negative stock market reac-
 tions that we observe may imply a link between
 shareholder wealth and socially irresponsible
 corporate behavior. On the other hand, the
 reactions may only indicate that the stock market
 is reacting to anticipated lower demand for a firm's
 products, because of the negative publicity of the
 announcements. The relationship between stock
 prices and social responsibility may thus be more
 indirect. It is important to carefully further
 document the underlying conditions of these
 announcements to understand their full impact.

 These results have ramifications for corporate
 governance, for investment decisions in factors that
 increase product reliability, and public relations.
 Future research may need to be directed at how
 different crisis management techniques used by
 companies at the time of product recalls help to
 mitigate the damage to shareholder wealth. In
 addition, future research ought to return to the
 debate between Bromiley and Marcus (1989) and
 Jarrell and Peltzman (1985), and examine the
 agency cost-related question about whether the
 stock price reaction associated with product recalls
 is sufficient to induce managers to ensure product
 reliability to avoid future recalls.
