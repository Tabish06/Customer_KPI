Cross-selling additional services to existing customers is an important task for multi-
service companies. This paper examines whether and how a corporate reputation
inﬂuences customers’ economically orientated (that is, perceived beneﬁts of buying
new services from current supplier) and relationship perceptions (that is, evaluations
of relationship strength and supplier’s offerings) and, in turn, their cross-buying
intentions. Good corporate reputations build customer cross-buying intentions by
increasing customers’ expected service quality, decreasing information costs, and
enhancing trust and affective commitment. Survey data from the Taiwanese life
insurance industry support the arguments, and the results offer some important
extensions to cross-buying theory.

Keywords: cross-buying intentions; corporate reputations; customer perceptions

Introduction

Cross-buying, which occurs when customers purchase additional services from the same
company, has been the topic of increasing research and empirical attention in recent
years. Because it enhances customer lifetime value, broadens customers’ relationship
with the company, increases the probability that a customer will stay with the company
(Reinartz & Kumar, 2003), and reduces the company’s customer acquisition expenditures
(Reichheld & Sasser, 1990), customer cross-buying and its antecedents represent important
topics, especially to companies that sell multiple services.

Corporate reputations are critical marketing activities for the successful marketing of
a service, in that reputation reﬂects the history of a company’s actions and thereby affects
buyers’ choices (Anderson & Weitz, 1992; Weiss, Anderson, & MacInnis, 1999). A strong
reputation may induce positive customer attitudes towards the company’s products
(Brown & Dacin, 1997; Erdem & Swait, 2004) and higher buying intentions for new
services (Yoon, Guffey, & Kijewski, 1993). However, an important, still unanswered
question considers whether corporate reputations inﬂuence cross-buying intentions and
how. For instance, what kind of perceptions of the company does a corporate reputation
inﬂuence? In what way does corporate reputation ultimately affect a customer’s decision
to cross-buy from the focal company? Because corporate reputations often involve
investments of huge sums of money, knowledge about their inﬂuence on cross-buying
would be extremely valuable for service companies.

Prior research focuses primarily on the inﬂuence of customers’ relationship percep-
tions (e.g. trust, affective commitment) on cross-buying decisions (Johnson & Grayson,
2005; Verhoef, Franses, & Hoekstra, 2002). Relationship perceptions include customers’
evaluations of the relationship strength and a supplier’s offerings (Verhoef, 2003).
Although relationship perceptions undoubtedly affect cross-buying, Bolton, Lemon and
Verhoef (2004) and Ngobo (2004) suggest other perceptions. Speciﬁcally, Bolton et al.
(2004) indicate that customers are usually not sufﬁciently familiar with new services
when they cross-buy, so they must conduct elaborate search and incur high information
costs. Ngobo (2004) argues that customers’ main concern when buying additional services
from the current company pertains to the company’s ability to offer high-quality services
in different areas. These observations imply that customers take economic beneﬁts into
account when making a cross-buying decision. Thus, ‘economically orientated’ percep-
tions, such as information cost savings and expected service quality, may inﬂuence
customer cross-buying intentions.

The inﬂuences of corporate reputations on customer perceptions appear in research
across disciplines. On the one hand, information economics demonstrates that corporate
reputations convey quality information, providing value signals in situations marked by
information complexity or inadequacy (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Kirmani & Rao,
2000; Shapiro, 1983). On the other hand, research in marketing indicates that good
reputations foster trust and conﬁdence (Doney & Cannon, 1997; Dowling, 2004). These
ﬁndings suggest that corporate reputations may inﬂuence both economically orientated
and relationship perceptions, which in turn inﬂuence customer cross-buying decisions.
Despite the potential importance of cross-buying processes, the role of corporate reputations
has received little research attention.

This study builds on these ideas by investigating whether and how corporate reputa-
tions may inﬂuence customers’ economically orientated and relationship perceptions
and therefore their cross-buying intentions. Speciﬁcally, we examine the mediating
effects of expected service quality, information cost savings, trust, and affective commit-
ment in a model that features both corporate reputation and cross-buying. Although these
hypothesized links already have conceptual support from one or more studies, they have
not previously appeared in a comprehensive, empirically supported model that incorpor-
ates these constructs and explores their effects on cross-buying in a service context.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In the next section, we offer a lit-
erature review of cross-buying and corporate reputations. We then develop our conceptual
framework and present the research hypotheses. We ﬁnally test our conceptual framework
empirically and conclude with the implications of the study.

Literature review

Cross-buying and its antecedents

Cross-buying, or ‘add-on’ buying, reﬂects the breadth of a relationship. Recent studies
consider the effect of marketing activities on cross-buying, including loyalty programmes
and direct mailings (e.g. De Wulf, Odekerken-Schro¨der, & Iacobucci, 2001; Verhoef,
2003), corporate reputations (Jeng, 2008), and acquisition channels (Verhoef &
Donkers, 2005). Previous studies also examine the inﬂuence of customers’ relationship
perceptions on cross-buying,
including commitment (Bolton et al., 2004; Verhoef,
2003; Verhoef et al., 2002), satisfaction (Ngobo, 2004; Verhoef, Franses, & Hoekstra,
2001), and payment equity (Verhoef et al., 2001). Although this previous research
offers some important insights, the role of economically orientated perceptions has been

virtually ignored. More important, the effect of the marketing activities on customer
perceptions and thus on customer behaviour has not been investigated (Verhoef, 2003).

Perceived corporate reputations

A corporate reputation refers to the global perception of the extent to which a company may
be held in high esteem or regard (Weiss et al., 1999). Corporate reputation summarizes the
company’s past and present behaviours. Furthermore, good reputation perceptions have been
linked to positive customer attitudes towards the company’s products (Brown & Dacin, 1997;
Erdem & Swait, 2004), enhanced buying intentions (Yoon et al., 1993), higher customer
loyalty (Andreassen & Lindenstad, 1998; Saxton, 1998), higher cross-buying intentions
(Jeng, 2008), greater competitive advantage (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; McMillan &
Joshi, 1997), and lower transaction costs (Compe´s Lo´pez & Poole, 1998).

Economic models suggest that corporate reputation serves as a credible market signal
when consumers face imperfect information (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Kirmani & Rao,
2000; Martin & Camarero, 2005; Shapiro, 1983). Developing a good reputation requires
signiﬁcant investments (Kirmani & Rao, 2000), so companies are reluctant to jeopardize
their reputations by acting opportunistically (Doney & Cannon, 1997; Tsler, 1980).
Service marketers also recognize that corporate reputations and brand names provide
quality signals (Bolton et al., 2004).

Conceptual model and hypotheses

Using previous research as a foundation, we formulate a corporate reputation – cross-
buying model with economically orientated and relationship perceptions as the mediating
variables (Figure 1). We next present the theory that supports the relationships detailed in
our proposed model.

Economically orientated perceptions

Economic models of buyer behaviour posit that consumers weigh the beneﬁts and costs of
a particular decision (Hauser & Wernerfelt, 1990; Ratchford, 1982). Therefore, we ﬁrst
propose that expected service quality and information cost savings represent two key

economically orientated perceptions that affect the customer cross-buying process. Our
associated hypotheses pertain to how a corporate reputation might inﬂuence cross-
buying intentions through these economically orientated perceptions.

Expected service quality refers to customers’ perception of the quality of new services.
Customers cannot indicate their perceptions of the service quality of a service they have
not yet bought. As Dabholkar (1996) suggests, expectations are the only types of evalu-
ations that customers can develop about service quality. Expected service quality, as
opposed to traditional service quality models based on the alignment of expectations
and perceptions (e.g. Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1988), offers a better measure in
a cross-buying context. Consumers incur costs to gather and process information to
reduce their uncertainty (Shugan, 1980), including expenditures of time and money and
psychological costs (Erdem & Swait, 1998). In summary, expected service quality and
information cost savings reﬂect perceptions of the beneﬁts of cross-buying from a
current service company.

Customers usually are not sufﬁciently familiar with either new services or their qual-
ities in a cross-buying context (Bolton et al., 2004). Because reputations convey quality
information, and companies’ investments in reputations can raise the credibility of their
claims about unobservable quality (Kirmani & Rao, 2000), a good reputation might
increase the expected quality of new services offered by the company (Brown & Dacin,
1997; Nayyar, 1990, 1993).

Moreover, Ngobo (2004) suggests that a company’s ability to deliver high-quality ser-
vices associated with different activities is a main consideration for customers who want to
cross-buy. If the expected quality of new services offered by the current company is high,
customers should be more willing to purchase additional services (Anderson, Fornell, &
Rust, 1997; Bolton et al., 2004; Zeithaml, Berry, & Parasuraman, 1996). Therefore, we
hypothesize:

H1: A high reputation increases the expected quality of new services from the focal company.
H2: Customers’ cross-buying intentions increase if the expected quality of new services from
the focal company increases.

Customers must search information and incur information costs when they want to buy
additional services (Bolton et al., 2004). Prior research shows that a good reputation
creates value for customers by decreasing their perceived information costs (Dowling,
2004; Shugan, 1980; Srinivasan & Ratchford, 1991), which then increases customers’
expected utility (Erdem & Swait, 2004). Thus, if the focal company has a good reputation,
customers may buy new services from it to save information costs and simplify their
decision making task. In other words, a good reputation minimizes customers’ information
costs and in turn increases their cross-buying intentions. Thus, we hypothesize:

H3: A high corporate reputation decreases customers’ information costs of cross-buying.
H4: Customers cross-buying intentions increase if the information costs of cross-buying from
the focal company decrease.

Relationship perceptions

Morgan and Hunt (1994) theorize that trust and (affective) commitment are key mediating
constructs in successful relational exchange. Trust refers to the perception of conﬁdence in
the exchange partner’s reliability and integrity (Morgan & Hunt, 1994), whereas affective
commitment is the desire to maintain a relationship, based on feelings of loyalty and
afﬁliation (Bolton et al., 2004; Gundlach, Achrol, & Mentzer, 1995).


The Service Industries Journal

855

Research on industrial marketing suggests that a supplier’s reputation can foster buyers’
trust and conﬁdence through the process of transference. A good reputation easily transfers
across buyers and thus enhances the credibility of the supplier (Anderson & Weitz, 1989;
Doney & Cannon, 1997; Ganesan, 1994). Consistent with these studies, we hypothesize
that corporate reputation is a positive determinant of the customers’ trust.

H5: A corporate reputation positively affects customers’ trust in the company.

In accordance with relationship marketing theory (Morgan & Hunt, 1994), we also
consider trust a mediating variable that leads to affective commitment. Because affective
commitment involves potential vulnerability and sacriﬁce, people are unlikely to be com-
mitted unless trust already exists (Garbarino & Johnson, 1999). Prior research also pro-
vides empirical support for a positive main effect of trust on affective commitment
(Anderson & Weitz, 1989; Geyskens, Steenkamp, Scheer, & Kumar, 1996; Morgan &
Hunt, 1994). Thus, we hypothesize that the greater a customer’s trust in a company, the
greater is his or her motivation to continue the relationship for affective reasons.

H6: Customers’ trust in the company positively affects their affective commitment.

Relationship marketing theory also suggests that because affectively committed custo-
mers believe they are connected to the company, they exhibit positive behaviour towards it
and are less likely to buy from other companies (Dick & Basu, 1994; Morgan & Hunt,
1994). In other words, affectively committed customers tend to buy additional services
from the focal company rather than from other companies. The idea also receives
support from Verhoef (2003) and Bolton et al. (2004).

H7: Customers’ cross-buying intentions increase if affective commitment increases.

Research method

Research context

We test our model in the context of the life insurance industry in Taiwan. Several factors
motivated the selection of this industry. First, life insurance companies usually sell different
types of insurance products (e.g. whole life insurance, investment-linked products, health
insurance) to their customers. Thus, cross-selling helps determine marketplace success in
this industry. Second, practitioner (e.g. Schu¨rmann, 2006) and preliminary ﬁeld interviews
indicate that considerable differences in corporate reputation exist in this industry, which
enables us to observe the potential impact of corporate reputations on cross-buying
decisions. Third, life insurance is complex and difﬁcult for customers to evaluate, even
after purchase and use (Zeithaml, 1981). Quality variability and the costs of collecting
information vary substantially, and trust and affective commitment appear particularly
important in such a high-credence service context (Martin & Camarero, 2005; Singh &
Sirdeshmukh, 2000; Verhoef et al., 2002). Therefore, corporate reputations, economically
orientated perceptions (including expected service quality and information cost savings),
relationship perceptions (including trust and affective commitment), and cross-buying
intentions should play important roles in this relationship, and this service category fulﬁls
the requirement of variation in the different constructs.

Although some life insurance companies offer other ﬁnancial products, such as loans,
selling life insurance products remains the most important business for all companies in
Taiwan in terms of the percentage of products sold (approximately 90%). As a result,
we limit this study to the category of life insurance products, consistent with prior
cross-buying research (e.g. Jeng, 2008; Verhoef, 2003; Verhoef et al., 2002).

Data collection

S.-P. Jeng

Information was collected from adult consumers, drawn from among shopping mall visi-
tors in northern Taiwan, to obtain variance in respondents’ age and gender. We also sought
even coverage across the time of day and day of the week that the interview took place to
reduce possible shopping pattern biases. An average of 37% of the approached visitors
participated. We thus recruited a total of 402 subjects, of whom 32 were eliminated due
to missing data. Sixty percent of the sample were women, 32% were 20 – 30 years of
age, 31% were 31 – 40 years of age, and 37% were older than 40 years.

To ensure subjects could answer our questions, we interviewed only those respondents
who indicated they owned life insurance (we previously obtained consent). Respondents
answered the questions with regard to their current life insurance companies.

Measures

We use multi-item scales to measure the model constructs (Table 1 contains the scale items)
and employ established measures with minor modiﬁcations to suit the study context.
Measures of corporate reputation come from Weiss et al. (1999) and capture generalized
reputation perceptions, consistent with a unidimensional perspective on reputation (e.g.
Weiss et al., 1999; Yoon et al., 1993). We adapt the measures of expected service quality
from Dabholkar (1996). The information cost savings measure comes from Erdem and
Swait (1998). For the trust measure, we rely on Crosby, Evans and Cowles (1990), and
for affective commitment, we use Anderson and Weitz (1992) scale. Finally, we adopt
the measures of cross-buying intentions from Jeng (2008) and modify them as necessary.
Respondents, therefore, consider buying an additional life insurance product and state the
likelihood of buying from their current life insurance company.

Results

Overall model evaluation

We report the correlation matrix, means, and standard deviations in Table 2. The model
achieves identiﬁcation, and the ﬁt indices suggest that the model adequately represents
the input data (goodness-of-ﬁt
index
(AGFI) ¼ 0.93, non-normed ﬁt
index
(CFI) ¼ 0.99, root mean residual (RMR) ¼ 0.04, root mean squared error of approxi-
mation (RMSEA) ¼ 0.02, x2 ¼ 191.49, p . 0.05). All indices exceeded the recommended
threshold levels (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988).

index (GFI) ¼ 0.95, adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt

index (NNFI) ¼ 0.97,

To assess scale validity, we use conﬁrmatory factor analysis. In Table 1, we detail the
composite reliabilities and variances extracted. Acceptable discriminate validity exists,
because all variables produce average variances extracted that are greater than 0.50
(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). All measures also achieve good reliability, with composite
reliabilities greater than 0.70 (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). Each of the 21 observable indicators
loads signiﬁcantly (a¼ 0.001) on the intended factors, in support of the convergent
validity of scale items (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). We use Harman’s one-factor test
of common method bias (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003) and obtain
several distinct factors from among the variables. In addition, the correlation matrix
(Table 2) does not indicate any highly correlated variables; common method bias usually
results in extremely high correlations (r . 0.90) (Bagozzi, Yi, & Phillips, 1991). Therefore,
we may conclude that common method variance bias is not a problem, and the results
conﬁrm the tenability of the proposed measurement model.

Examination of hypothesized relationships

The results of the structural model are presented in Table 3 to interpret the causal relation-
ships. Corporate reputation has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on expected service quality
(path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.89, p , 0.05), in support of H1. Expected service quality has a
signiﬁcant and positive effect on cross-buying intentions (path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.31,
p , 0.05), in support of H2. Corporate reputation also has a signiﬁcant and positive
effect on information cost savings (path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.79, p , 0.05), consistent with
H3, and information cost savings have a signiﬁcant and positive effect on cross-buying
intentions (path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.16, p , 0.05), consistent with H4.
Furthermore, it is found that corporate reputation has a signiﬁcant and positive
effect on trust (path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.78, p , 0.05), in support of H5. In turn, trust has a

effect on cross-buying intentions (path coefﬁcient ¼ 0.44, p , 0.05), consistent with H7.
In summary, corporate reputation positively affects expected service quality and decreases
information costs; as a result, it increases customers’ cross-buying intentions. A corporate
reputation also positively increases trust and affective commitment, which lead to higher
cross-buying intentions.

Discussion

This study aims to increase the understanding of whether and how a corporate reputation
inﬂuences customers’ cross-buying intentions. The results obtained indicate that on the
one hand, corporate reputations increase the expected service quality of new services
from the current company and decrease customers’ information costs, which enhances
cross-buying intentions. On the other hand, corporate reputations positively affect trust
and affective commitment, which increase cross-buying intentions. The tested model
thus contributes to extant literature by offering an integrative synthesis of insights from
previous studies. To the best of our knowledge, this study also is the ﬁrst to examine
empirically the effects of economically orientated perceptions on cross-buying intentions.
The results have several key implications for both theory and practice. In terms of
theory, the results highlight the importance of corporate reputations in customer cross-
buying literature, consistent with Jeng (2008). Previous work is extended and it is
demonstrated that a good reputation contributes to cross-buying intentions by affecting
both relationship and economically orientated perceptions. Our study also suggests the
importance of incorporating economically orientated perceptions. Reinartz and Kumar
(2000) suggest that customers in lengthy relationships are more value conscious; we
argue in addition that expected service quality and information cost savings represent
two critical economically orientated perceptions that affect cross-buying intentions.

Moreover, previous research suggests that relationship perceptions inﬂuence cross-
buying (e.g. Bolton et al., 2004) and has called for investigations of the inﬂuence of
marketing activities on marketing relationship perceptions and,
thus, on customer
behaviour (e.g. Verhoef, 2003). We respond to this call by examining the inﬂuence of a
corporate reputation on trust, affective commitment, and, ultimately, cross-buying inten-
tions. This research therefore demonstrates that corporate reputations can serve as useful
relationship marketing activities that increase customers’ cross-buying intentions by
enhancing their relationship perceptions.

In terms of practice, our ﬁndings suggest that it is worthwhile for service companies to
invest in their reputations to increase customers’ cross-buying intentions. Good reputa-
tions can foster trust and conﬁdence, create affectively committed customers, and thus
increase intentions to cross-buy from the current company. Moreover, good reputation
signals the company’s ability to deliver high-quality new services.

Our ﬁndings further imply that good reputations may facilitate customers’ cross-
buying by reducing their information costs. This effect may be even more important for
a non-expert, highly involved customer in high-risk purchase situations (Dowling,
2004). Such customers usually suffer from information overload, but corporate reputation
can decrease their information costs and simplify their decision making task. These study
ﬁndings apply to various marketing contexts, including life insurance, ﬁnancial invest-
ments, and other such high-involvement services.

Limitation and future research

We acknowledge several limitations of this research. First, in the life insurance industry,
the degree of consistency among the offered services tends to be relatively high, which
limits the generalizability of our results. Although our results may hold – prior research
has already suggested that corporate reputation and brand name can be more important
factors for companies that offer less consistent services (e.g. Bolton et al., 2004;
Verhoef et al., 2001) – additional research should study the effect of corporate reputations
on cross-buying intentions within companies that offer less consistent services.

Second, we use intentions as opposed to behaviour as the study object. Customers
purchase insurance products infrequently, and as a result, it is difﬁcult to determine the
correct point in time to observe actual behaviour. Third, we employ cross-sectional
data, which limits our ability to determine empirically the causal relations implied in
our hypotheses. Further research therefore should address the issue of causality.

Fourth, the insights from this research are based on perceptual and intention measures
provided by previous studies. Further research could supplement these measures with
more qualitative methodologies, such as conducting in-depth interviews with respondents.
Additional insights from such interpretive research might provide a richer understanding
of the process by which corporate reputation inﬂuence customers. For example, what
interpretations do customers attach to the word ‘good reputation’ or ‘bad reputation’?
Do those interpretations vary across different purchase behaviours? What
traits or
actions associated with reputations are mentioned most often? Future studies should
also investigate the customer-based trust and commitment constructs in a cross-buying
context.

Fifth, although our purposive quota sampling offers a realistic test of the hypotheses
(Calder, Phillips, & Tybout, 1981), to generalize the ﬁndings to the broader population
with conﬁdence, further testing must go beyond a non-probability sample. Finally, repli-
cations could test the model in other cultures. More detailed analysis of culture-speciﬁc
moderators of reputation effects should be conducted.
