ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the impact of downsizing
on a ﬁrm’s reputation for corporate social perform-
ance (RCSP). Drawing on the downsizing, corpo-
rate reputation and social responsibility literatures,
a number of hypotheses concerning the impact of
downsizing, and particularly the types of down-
sizing, on a ﬁrm’s reputation for corporate social
performance are developed and empirically tested.
The main ﬁndings of this study are that, while
downsizing seems to have a negative impact on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP, when one takes into account the
kind of managerial action that led to downsizing
(layoffs and/or divestitures), this impact differs
between the two stakeholder groups,
industry
executives and ﬁnancial analysts, which were
investigated. This study also found that a high
ﬁnancial performance prior to downsizing led to a
greater negative impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP.

KEYWORDS: corporate reputation, corpo-
rate social performance, downsizing, layoffs,
divestitures.

INTRODUCTION
Downsizing is not only one of the most
painful experiences in the life of corporations
and their employees, but, according to many
strategic management researchers,
there is
also no convincing evidence that it actually
leads to superior organisational performance
in the long term (Cascio et al. 1997; De
Meuse et al. 1997). This controversy has led
to much discussion concerning the relation-
ship between downsizing and the notion of
corporate social performance in the popular
media (Sloan and Underwood 1996), but
surprisingly little discussion in the academic
literature (Van Buren 2000). This paper con-
tributes to the investigation of this issue by
empirically investigating the impact
that
downsizing has on the ﬁrm’s reputation for
corporate social performance (RCSP).

Understanding the potential

impact of
downsizing on the ﬁrm’s RCSP is very
important
for the following two reasons.
First, since the corporate reputation of a ﬁrm
can be a signiﬁcant source of sustainable
competitive advantage (Fombrun 1996; Hall
1992, 1993; McMillan and Maheshkumar

The impact of downsizing on the corporate reputation for social performance

1997; Roberts and Dowling 1997), a better
understanding of the impact of such a con-
troversial measure as downsizing on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP (and therefore on the ﬁrm’s
overall reputation) can only assist managers
in protecting the ﬁrm’s reputation. Secondly,
a better understanding of the potential impact
of downsizing on the ﬁrm’s reputation —
through its impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP —
can assist managers and public administrators
to better determine the effectiveness of
downsizing. Because, even if downsizing has
under certain conditions positive, short-term
effects on the proﬁtability and/or competi-
tiveness of ﬁrms — a position for which
signiﬁcant doubts exist in the literature —
these gains could be easily offset by more
longer-term negative effects on the ﬁrm’s
reputation.

There are two major reasons why down-
sizing decisions should be expected to have
an impact on a ﬁrm’s RCSP. First, according
to Van Buren (2000), there are implicit social
and psychological contracts that relate to the
ethical obligations of managers towards their
employees. Since the social responsibility of
the ﬁrm — an integral part of a ﬁrm’s social
performance (Wood 1991) — encompasses
the society’s ethical expectations on the ﬁrm
(Carroll 1979), it is reasonable to expect that
downsizing decisions will have a negative
impact on a ﬁrm’s RCSP. Secondly, even if
it has been argued that downsizing practices
have been granted a legitimate business prac-
tice status (Lamertz and Baum 1998), this has
been the result of a schema packing process
which initially had an ethical dimension to it
(McKinley et al. 2000). In addition,
this
initial ethical dimension of downsizing will
most likely have left an imprint on that part
of the ﬁrm’s reputation which refers to its
social performance.

Building on these two lines of reasoning,
and drawing on the relevant literature on
downsizing, corporate social performance
and corporate reputation, this paper elabo-
rates on the relationship between downsizing

the major concepts of

and reputation for corporate social perform-
ance by developing a number of hypotheses,
which are tested with the use of data drawn
from Fortune’s America’s Most Admired Cor-
porations
survey, and from the
Wall Street Journal Index. More speciﬁcally,
the paper proceeds as
the remainder of
follows. First,
the
paper, downsizing and RCSP are discussed.
Secondly, drawing on the relevant literature,
a number of hypotheses concerning the
potential impact of downsizing on the ﬁrm’s
RCSP are developed. Thirdly, the method-
ology of the study is described, followed by a
presentation of its main ﬁndings. The paper
concludes with a discussion of its contribu-
tions, implications and limitations.

MAJOR CONCEPTS
In this section, the main constructs of the
paper — downsizing and RCSP — are
presented and discussed. The purpose of the
following section is to facilitate the develop-
ment of testable hypotheses concerning the
impact of downsizing on the ﬁrm’s RCSP.

Reputation for corporate social performance
The notion of RCSP can be seen as a
dimension of the ﬁrm’s overall reputation,
deﬁned by Fombrun (1997: 37) as ‘the over-
all estimation in which a particular company
is held by its various constituents’, a deﬁni-
tion, which allows for a number of different
aspects or dimensions of corporate reputation
(Zyglidopoulos and Phillips 1999; Zyglido-
poulos 2001). In this paper, the focus is on
the estimation of the ﬁrm’s constituents, with
respect
social performance,
deﬁned by Wood (1991) as:

to the ﬁrm’s

‘A business organization’s conﬁguration of
principles of social responsibility, processes of
social responsiveness, and politics, programs,
and observable outcomes as they relate to the
ﬁrm’s societal relationships’ (Wood 1991: 691).

In short, the term ‘reputation for corporate
social performance’ (RCSP) refers to the


ﬁrm’s reputation for principles, processes and
outcomes related to the social impact of the
ﬁrm’s operations.

As a ﬁrm resource, the RCSP is potentially
signiﬁcant for two reasons. First, within the
business and society ﬁeld, RCSP has been
seen as a mediating variable between corpo-
rate social performance (CSP) and corporate
ﬁnancial performance (CFP). In other words,
the implicit (if not explicit) position of the
ﬁeld is that CSP has an impact on the ﬁrm’s
proﬁtability through its
inﬂuence on the
ﬁrm’s reputation. Support for this position
has been recently provided by Orlitzky et al.
(2003: 403), who performed a meta-analysis
of 52 studies (yielding a total sample size of
33,878 observations), and found not only
that CSP appears to be highly correlated with
CFP, but also that the reputational indices of
CSP ‘are more highly correlated with corpo-
rate ﬁnancial performance (CFP) than are
other indicators of CSP’.

Secondly, viewing matters from the corpo-
rate reputation literature, the ﬁrm’s RCSP is
part of the overall reputation of a ﬁrm, which,
according to most resource-based view the-
orists, is one of the most important intangible
resources of a business ﬁrm, because it can be
a major source of competitive advantage
(Barney 1991; Dierickx and Cool 1989;
Fombrun 1996; Hall 1992, 1993; McMillan
and Maheshkumar 1997; Roberts and Dowl-
ing 1997). Despite the potential contribution
that a ﬁrm’s RCSP can have on the overall
reputation of the ﬁrm, there is evidence that a
ﬁrm’s RCSP can directly inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s
competitive position, by signalling to pro-
spective employees the attractiveness of the
ﬁrm as an employer (Turban et al. 1997;
Greening and Turban 2000) and therefore
inﬂuencing the ﬁrm’s ability to attract and
retain talented personnel, a signiﬁcant factor
for a ﬁrm’s competitive position.

Thus, understanding the potential impact
of downsizing activities on the ﬁrm’s RCSP
contributes to our understanding of the factors
that inﬂuence a valuable ﬁrm resource within

two different literature streams — business
and society, and corporate reputation.

Downsizing
According to Cameron (1996: 1050), the
term ‘downsizing’ is used in the literature ‘to
encompass a whole range of activities from
personnel layoffs and hiring freezes to con-
solidations and mergers of organizational
units’. In this paper, following Cascio et al.
(1997), downsizing refers to signiﬁcant and
intentional reductions in personnel. In other
words, not just any reduction in personnel
can be considered as downsizing, as it is quite
possible that reductions in personnel could
have been the result of employees leaving the
ﬁrm,
for whatever reason, on their own
accord, without this fact indicating any in-
tention on the part of the ﬁrm’s management
(McKinley et al. 2000).

Regarding the extent of downsizing,
although there are no clear guidelines as to
what is the critical point where an intentional
reduction in personnel would be referred to
as ‘downsizing’,
in practice, Cascio et al.
(1997) use the term to refer solely to reduc-
tions in employment greater than or equal to
5 per cent of the ﬁrm’s workforce. This way,
by focusing only on signiﬁcant reductions in
personnel, it is also easier for researchers to
avoid the classiﬁcation of the potential invo-
luntary erosion of a ﬁrm’s resource base as
downsizing (McKinley et al. 2000; Freeman
and Cameron 1993), as personnel reductions
of that magnitude (greater than or equal to 5
per cent) are most likely to be intentional.

But the type of action that leads to a
reduction in personnel, categorised as ‘down-
sizing’, is also important for the purposes of
this paper, as reductions in employment can
result from two kinds of managerial actions
— layoffs (Burton et al. 1996; Worrell et al.
1991) and divestiture of organisational divi-
sions (Hoskisson and Hitt 1994; Hoskisson
et al. 1994). This distinction is important,
because it will be argued in the following
section that these two types of downsizing

activities, layoffs and divestitures, are expected
to have differing impacts on a ﬁrm’s RCSP.

HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT
There are two reasons why downsizing, and
especially downsizing through layoffs, should
have a negative impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP.
First, there are implicit psychological and
social contracts between managers and their
employees (Van Buren 2000) which might
depict downsizing through layoffs as unethi-
cal, even if no law is broken. Secondly, the
negative impact
that downsizing through
extensive layoffs usually has on the lives of
employees and the communities surrounding
the ﬁrm can only have a negative impact on
the ﬁrm’s RCSP, which rests with the ﬁrm’s
stakeholders, after all. This is especially the
case since downsizing as a result of this nega-
tive impact on communities has been given a
rather negative spin by the popular media
(Sloan and Underwood 1996; The New
York Times Special Report 1996).

Van Buren (2000) argues that, despite the
fact that downsizing — through layoffs — is
a legal practice within the US labour market,
it has the potential of being unethical when
its practice violates implicit psychological and
social contracts between employees and their
organisation — as represented by its man-
agers. Psychological contracts are ‘individual
beliefs, shaped by the organization, regarding
terms of an exchange agreement between
individuals and their organization’ (Rousseau
1995: 9; cited in Van Buren 2000), whereas
social contracts deﬁne the ‘normative ground
rules’ through which societies inﬂuence the
fairness of
implicit contractual agreements
between individuals and corporations (Do-
naldson and Dunfee 1994). The criterion for
whether a particular managerial practice vio-
lates
social and/or psychological
contracts is, according to Van Buren (2000:
208), the ‘reasonable third party’ one, which
has been extensively ‘used in the legal con-
text
to determine liability and to assign
damages’.

implicit

Page 14

It seems that in many cases of downsizing
through layoffs, a ‘reasonable third party’
would also be expected to perceive such a
violation, because of the extent to which the
‘rules of the game’ seem to differ for top
managers vis-a`-vis all other employees. Of
course, one might say that economic down-
turns make downsizings through layoffs in-
evitable, and this is true. But a reasonable
outsider might also notice that top US man-
agers not only get paid a multiple over their
lowest ranking employees that is signiﬁcantly
higher than their colleagues in Europe and
Japan, but also do not have to suffer any
greater level of risk for this increased rate
of return. This is especially the case as the
risk for economic downturns
is regularly
absorbed by worker layoffs and rehirings
(Cappelli et al. 1997), a phenomenon that
has been compared with ‘a ‘‘revolving door’’,
in which corporations routinely displace and
hire large segments of their workforces in a
permanent
(The
Economist 1996; Naik 1998; cited in McKin-
ley et al. 2000). Furthermore, this unfairness,
which a reasonable outsider might perceive,
is only accentuated when proﬁtable ﬁrms
engage in downsizing, despite the fact that
no proﬁtability crisis is looming over the
corporation. In short, one might reasonably
in many cases of downsizing
argue that
through layoffs,
implicit psychological and
social contracts between employees and their
organisation are being violated, especially
when the corporation is proﬁtable.

restructuring

process’

Another reason why downsizing through
layoffs might have a negative impact on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP is the negative social impact
that such activities have on different commu-
nities, along with the negative media atten-
tion that such developments have attracted in
the popular media. According to Uchitelle
and Kleinﬁeld (1996), 43 million jobs were
lost in the USA in the period from 1979 to
1996 (cited in McKinley et al. 2000). Even
though most of the laid-off workers even-
tually found jobs again, the displacement,


uncertainty, hardship and grievance asso-
ciated with the loss of a job has attracted a
great deal of negative attention in the popular
media (Sloan and Underwood 1996; The
New York Times Special Report 1996). In
one case, Newsweek,
in an article entitled
‘The Hit Men’,
(Sloan and Underwood
1996), made the connection between the
number of workers
laid off by a Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) and the CEO’s
compensation as his/her stock options appre-
ciated in the stock market. Given that the
impact of the media on the reputation of a
ﬁrm has been well established in the litera-
ture,1 it is reasonable to expect that a ﬁrm’s
RCSP is negatively inﬂuenced by such nega-
tive media attention concerning the social
implications of the ﬁrm’s actions.

From the discussion above, hypotheses 1

and 2 follow:

H1: Downsizing events (and especially downsizing
through layoffs) will have a negative impact on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP.

H2: Firm proﬁtability will
intensify the negative
impact that downsizing through layoffs will have on
the ﬁrm’s RCSP.

The reputation of a ﬁrm (and in this case
its RCSP), however, is not a homogeneous
construct and might differ between stake-
holder groups, a notion referred to as stake-
holder speciﬁcity (Zyglidopoulos and Phillips
1999; Zyglidopoulos 2001); this might also
be true for the reactions of different stake-
holder groups to particular actions of a ﬁrm.
In other words,
it is possible for a ﬁrm’s
downsizing to have a negative impact on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP with industry employees, while
it has a neutral (or even a positive) impact on
the ﬁrm’s RCSP with the industry’s man-
agers or investor community.

In particular, Lamertz and Baum (1998)
found that
the practice of downsizing
(through layoffs) has been legitimised within
the management community, at least in the
Canadian context, where the study took

place. Moreover, McKinley et al. 2000)
argued that this has been the result of a
schema packing process, which initially had
an ethical dimension to it. They argue that
the schema ‘downsizing is effective’ even-
tually became institutionalised within the
managerial community — despite the fact
that academic research into the matter has
not proven this to be the case — and that the
issue of whether downsizing is, or is not,
ethical was eventually abandoned. Therefore,
it would be reasonable, if the Lemertz and
Baum (1998) ﬁndings and the McKinley
et al. (2000) argument holds true, for the
to perceive
managerial
downsizing through layoffs as
something
harming the ﬁrm’s RCSP, a claim that one
cannot make, for the reasons discussed above,
regarding other stakeholder groups such as
employees, the general public or even con-
sumers.

community not

But, given that there is not enough evi-
dence in the literature to more accurately
predict the reactions of different stakeholder
groups to a ﬁrm’s downsizing through lay-
offs, this discussion can be summed up in the
following, rather general, third hypothesis:

H3: Downsizing through layoffs will have a different
impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP with various stakeholder
groups.

But, while downsizing through layoffs
is
generally expected to have a negative impact
on the ﬁrm’s RCSP, this is not the case for
downsizing through divestitures. In other
words,
to
believe that downsizing through divestitures
will not have a negative impact (and will
most probably have no impact) on the ﬁrm’s
RCSP. First, in downsizing through divesti-
tures, the ethical responsibility of managers
(which we argued above can be found in
implicit psychological and social contracts) is
transferred to the new owners (or managers).
As a result, the ﬁrm’s RCSP is only indirectly
implicated in any potential layoffs by the new
management. Secondly, unlike downsizing

through layoffs,
the divesting of business
units never had an ethical dimension to it.
On the contrary, it was always seen as part of
the corporate strategy prerogative of the ﬁrm
managers. Even when criticised by the man-
agement and academic press as an admission
of failure, divestitures were seen as being part
of
the corporation’s strategic realignment.
Hypothesis 4 follows:

H4: Downsizing through divestiture (the sale of a
particular division) will not have a negative impact on
the ﬁrm’s RCSP.

METHODOLOGY
Data sources and data collection
To test
the above hypotheses, data from
two sources were used. In measuring the
type of downsizing that a ﬁrm was involved
in during a particular period, data originated
from the Wall Street Journal Index, which
is published yearly by the Wall Street Journal
and consists of summaries of all the news
coverage related to a particular company for
a given year. In measuring the RCSP of a
ﬁrm, employee count and ﬁnancial per-
formance data from Fortune’s AMAC survey
were used. The AMAC survey has been
conducted yearly since 1983 by Fortune
magazine, and rates the reputation of the
ﬁve to ten largest companies in each of the
46 industries from the Fortune 1,000 list of
the year prior to the survey. The reputation
of each company is rated according to eight
key attributes: (1) quality of management,
(2) quality of products or
(3)
innovativeness, (4) ability to attract, develop
long-term
and keep talented people,
investment value,
soundness,
(7) use of corporate assets and (8) commun-
ity and environmental responsibility. These
ratings use an 11-point scale (0 ¼ poor, 10
¼ excellent).

services,

In this paper, the scores on ‘community
and environmental responsibility’ are used as
indicators of a ﬁrm’s RCSP. The sample of
respondents consists of executives and out-

Page 16

side directors of the Fortune 1000 companies
and investment analysts who cover these
ﬁrms. Taking advantage of the fact that the
survey draws on two different constituents,
the scores of executives and investment ana-
lysts are used separately as indicators of a
ﬁrm’s RCSP with two different stakeholder
groups — the ﬁrm’s competitors within a
given industry and the ﬁnancial community.
Over its life time,
the survey has had a
response rate of about 50 per cent, and while
the number of questionnaires mailed has
differed from year to year, it has always been
up at about the 8,000 mark. Questionnaires
were mailed in the early autumn and were
followed up by two subsequent mailings,
phone calls and faxes. The AMAC survey has
been criticised for its ﬁnancial halo (Brown
and Perry 1995; Fryxel and Wang 1994), and
its usefulness has been questioned; however,
further research has shown that if one con-
trols for ﬁnancial performance, the AMAC
survey is an adequate indicator of a ﬁrm’s
RCSP (Carter and Dukerich 1998; Szwaj-
kowski and Figlewicz 1997, 1999).

Deﬁnition and measurement of variables
In investigating the above hypotheses, three
kinds of variables were used — indepen-
dent, dependent and control variables. In-
dependent variables consisted of variables
measuring the downsizing activities of the
various ﬁrms; dependent variables captured
the yearly changes in the ﬁrms’ RCSP; and
control variables were used for factors that
might inﬂuence the outcome of the statis-
tical analyses (such as prior levels of corpo-
rate reputation, ﬁrm size and ﬁrm ﬁnancial
performance). Companies that appeared in
the 1988 and 1991 AMAC surveys where
selected for this study, providing 537 data
points for statistical analysis. Also, the Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov test with Lilliefors sig-
niﬁcance correction was performed in all of
the above variables and none was found to
deviate signiﬁcantly from normality.

(DOWN-l),

Independent variables
Following Cascio et al. (1997), downsizing
was operationalised through an indicator
variable as a reduction in the yearly employee
count greater than or equal to 5 per cent
(DOWN). From the 537 data points refer-
ring to company-years, 151 instances of
downsizing were identiﬁed. In addition, the
type of downsizing was operationalised in
such a way as
the way
(through layoffs or divestitures) it was per-
formed. More speciﬁcally,
three indicator
variables were used to operationalise the four
possible states: a ﬁrm downsizing through
layoffs
through divestitures
(DOWN-d) and both through divestitures
and layoffs (DOWN-dl). The fourth possible
state referred to a ﬁrm that did not downsize
in any way during the given year. In order to
identify which of the 151 instances of down-
sizing were due to layoffs, divestitures or
both, a graduate student, specially trained
and under
the
author, went through the Wall Street Journal
Index for the relevant years and classiﬁed the
downsizing instances accordingly. The result
was that from the 151 instances of down-
sizing, 17 were classiﬁed as layoffs (DOWN-
l), 51 were classiﬁed as divestitures (DOWN-
d) and 25 were classiﬁed as both layoffs and
divestitures (DOWN-dl). For 58 downsizing
instances no information was
found, and
these instances, erring on the side of caution,
were excluded from the regression models
dealing with the types of downsizing and the
ﬁrm’s RCSP.

Dependent variables
A ﬁrm’s RCSP was measured through the
yearly differences in the AMAC index of the
ﬁrm’s reputation for ‘community and envir-
onmental responsibility’ (DCR), a practice
that is well accepted in the business and
society ﬁeld (Wood 1995; Szwajkowski and
Figlewicz 1999; Zyglidopoulos 2001). Be-
cause two populations (industry executives
and ﬁnancial analysts) are surveyed every

year, however, two further measurements of
this variable were possible: one for the yearly
changes in RCSP as rated by the industry
executives (DCR-e), and one for the yearly
changes in RCSP as rated by the ﬁnancial
analysts of the industry (DCR-a). DCR-e
was used as an indicator for the ﬁrm’s RCSP
among its competitors within its industry and
DCR-a was used as an indicator of the ﬁrm’s
RCSP within the ﬁnancial community. In
other words, the two measures were used as
indicators of
the ﬁrm’s RCSP with two
different stakeholder groups.

Control variables
First, ﬁnancial performance had to be con-
trolled for because it had been found to
correlate signiﬁcantly with corporate reputa-
tion (Brown and Perry 1995; McGuire et al.
1990). A return on assets (ROA) ratio was
used for these purposes because not only was
it easily available through the AMAC data-
base, but it also exhibited ‘stability and com-
parability across ﬁrms’, according to Kim
et al. (1989). But because the dependent
variables were yearly changes of scores for
the ﬁrm’s RCSP, it was considered more
appropriate to control for changes in ROA
(DROA) from the year prior to the down-
sizing event. In addition, in about half of the
regression models, it was necessary to control
for the ROA for the year before the down-
sizing event took place. This was deemed
necessary because hypothesis 2 predicts a
negative interaction effect between the ﬁrm’s
ﬁnancial
downsizing
through layoffs. Furthermore, the ﬁrm’s ﬁ-
nancial performance prior to the downsizing
events would most likely be involved in such
an interaction.

Secondly, prior levels of RCSP — the
previous year in this case – were controlled
for because prior levels of corporate reputa-
tion (CR) could possibly have had an impact
on the way in which ﬁrm stakeholders re-
acted to speciﬁc events (Fiol and Kovoor-
Misra 1997). Since the dependent variables

larger ﬁrms receive more media attention,
which could have an impact on reputational
ratings. Firm size was measured using the

Statistical analysis
Multivariate regression was considered to
be an appropriate method for this study,
because, despite the fact
that some ﬁrms
appeared in two points in time, there was no
pattern in the data-collecting process and
therefore autocorrelation and heteroscedasti-
city problems were quite unlikely; and, in-
deed, none were
found. Overall, 12
regression models were used,
six models
dealing with the impact of downsizing — as
a greater than or equal to 5 per cent reduc-
tion in the ﬁrm’s number of employees —
on the ﬁrm’s RCSP, and six models dealing
with the impact of the type of downsizing on
the ﬁrm’s RCSP. In addition, for all of the
regressions, normality tests for the residuals
were conducted and it was found that the
residuals of all the models did not deviate
from normality or exhibit any kind of pat-
tern.

gating the impact of downsizing (as a reduc-
tion in personnel greater than or equal to 5

tional scores (model 1; p , 0.001), execu-
tive reputational scores (model 3; p , 0.001)

on the ﬁrm’s RCSP, was also found for the
models investigating the changes in the col-
lective (model 7; p , 0.01) and executive
(model 9; p , 0.05) reputational scores (see
Table 3). In model 11, however, which
investigated the impact of the type of down-
sizing on the changes in the reputational
scores of investment analysts, the coefﬁcient
of the relevant variable (DOWN-l) did not
reach a level of signiﬁcance, even though it
was negative, as predicted by hypothesis 1.

Hypothesis 2 predicts that a negative inter-
action effect between downsizing through
layoffs and prior ﬁnancial performance of the
corporation will exist, and partial support for
this hypothesis was found. Speciﬁcally, sup-
port for this hypothesis was found in model 8
(p , 0.05) for changes in collective scores for
RCSP and marginally for model 9 (p , 0.10)
for changes in scores for RCSP of executives.
But in model 12, dealing with the changes in
scores for RCSP for investment analysts, the
coefﬁcient of the relevant variable did not
reach a level of signiﬁcance, even though it
was negative, as predicted (see Table 3).

Hypothesis 3, applied to the two speciﬁc
constituents of our study, executives and
analysts, predicts that the impact of down-
sizing through layoffs on the changes in the
scores for RCSP will differ between industry
executives and investment analysts. Support
for this hypothesis can be seen by comparing
the relevant coefﬁcients of model 9 with
those of model 11, and the coefﬁcients of
model 10 with those of model 12. In particu-
lar, by comparing model 9 (industry execu-

The impact of downsizing on the corporate reputation for social performance

tives) with model 11 (investment analysts),
we can see that, while industry executives
reacted negatively in a statistically signiﬁcant
way to downsizing events through layoffs
(p , 0.05), through divestitures (p , 0.001)
and through both layoffs and divestitures
(p , 0.01), the reactions of investment ana-
lysts did not reach a statistically signiﬁcant
level concerning layoffs and divestitures. Ana-
lysts even reacted in a positive way in the case
of divestitures, and although they did react
negatively when faced with companies en-
gaged in both layoffs and divestitures, this was
statistically at a lower marginal level of sig-
niﬁcance (p , 0.10) than was the case for the
industry executives. In other words, our ﬁnd-
ings support hypothesis 3, that different stake-
holder groups would re-evaluate their notion
of a ﬁrm’s RCSP in different ways when faced
with the same downsizing events.

Finally, hypothesis 4 predicted that down-
sizing through divestitures would not have a
negative impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP. Find-
ings in models 7, 8, 9 and 10, however, did
not support this hypothesis, as the coefﬁcients
for downsizing through divestiture were con-
stantly negative in all of these models, dealing
with the changes in collective and executive
scores of RCSP, with all of the coefﬁcients
reaching levels of statistical signiﬁcance (see
Table 3). Partial support for this hypothesis,
however, was found in models 11 and 12,
which dealt with the changes in the scores of
RCSP of investment analysts, as the relevant
coefﬁcients were not only positive, but statis-
tically not signiﬁcant, as predicted by hypoth-
esis 4. Therefore, one can say, at best, that
partial support for this hypothesis was found,
or that the ﬁndings are inconclusive, with
hypothesis 4 applying to the behaviour of the
investment community, but not the behav-
iour of the industry executives.

Wood 1995; Zyglidopoulos 2001), and one
dealing with the issue of downsizing and its
impacts on the ﬁrm’s competitiveness and
public image (Cascio et al. 1997; McKinley
et al. 2000).

Within the ﬁrst literature stream, the ﬁnd-
ings of this study that downsizing events have
a negative impact on the ﬁrm’s RCSP in-
dicate that despite the legitimation of down-
sizing as a managerial practice (Lamertz and
Baum 1998), there might still be implicit
psychological and social contracts related to
the ethical responsibilities of managers to-
wards their employees (Van Buren 2000)
which downsizing decisions violate,
thus
having a negative impact on the ﬁrm’s
RCSP. In addition, the ﬁndings of this study
support Freeman’s (1994) argument that ‘the
separation thesis’ — the assumption that the
moral and ﬁnancial consequences of manage-
rial action can be clearly separated — is
simplistic and does not always hold true.

(Zyglidopoulos

Concerning the perception of a ﬁrm’s
RCSP among different stakeholder groups,
the ﬁndings of this study indicate support for
what has been labelled ‘the stakeholder speci-
ﬁcity hypothesis’
2001;
Zyglidopoulos and Phillips 1999). According
to this hypothesis, the reputation of a ﬁrm
will not only differ between different stake-
holder groups, but particular events will also
have a different impact on the perceptions of
the ﬁrm’s reputation between different stake-
holder groups. In this case, our ﬁndings
indicate that downsizing events are perceived
differently by industry executives and invest-
ment analysts, and, as it has been argued
before, given the cognitive proximity of
these two groups, it is reasonable to expect
greater
stakeholder
groups which are further apart with respect
to their assumptions, beliefs and interests
(Zyglidopoulos 2001).

DISCUSSION
The ﬁndings from this study contribute to at
least two literature streams, one dealing with
the ﬁrm’s RCSP (Brown and Perry 1995;

Moreover, within the downsizing litera-
ture, our ﬁndings highlight the importance
of corporate reputation — in this case RCSP
— in evaluating the long-term implications

Page 22


of downsizing decisions. For example, given
the ﬁndings from this study, combined with
the results of Turban and Greening (1997), it
is quite possible that companies that want to
rehire qualiﬁed employees after a downsizing
cycle will ﬁnd it harder to do so because of
the damage that downsizing has had on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP. In addition, the ﬁndings of this
study highlight the different ways that the
same managerial action — downsizing in this
case — can be perceived differently by
various stakeholder groups.

Limitations and implications
Despite its contribution to the understanding
of the impact of downsizing activities on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP, this study has at least two major
limitations. First, it is limited by the fact that
the AMAC survey deals with larger, well-
established ﬁrms, and only monitors
the
reputation of ﬁrms among industry execu-
tives and investment analysts. Therefore,
further research needs to address the issues
raised by the hypotheses proposed here, by
investigating the impact of downsizing activ-
ities on the notions of reputation held by a
more diverse selection of stakeholders, and
by investigating the matter on a more diverse
population of ﬁrms. Secondly, another lim-
itation of this study is that, given its method-
ology,
it does not examine in depth any
instances of downsizing, and thus it might be
missing out on numerous ways
through
which downsizing activities might have an
impact on the perception of the ﬁrm’s RCSP
with particular stakeholder groups. In other
words, this kind of study into the impact of
downsizing activities on the ﬁrm’s RCSP
needs
to be supplemented by qualitative
studies that could plausibly come closer to
revealing the richness of the possible inter-
actions that link downsizing activities with a
ﬁrm’s reputation.

Concerning the management of public
affairs, this study also highlights the fact that
public affairs managers have to deal with the
public implications of managerial actions

which are damaging for the ﬁrm’s image, but
are often out of their control or inﬂuence.
Therefore, the public affairs function, one
could argue, should quite often start within
the ﬁrm boundaries, by trying to point out to
the appropriate line managers the long-term
effects that different actions might have on
the ﬁrm’s reputation.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate
the impact of downsizing on a ﬁrm’s RCSP.
After drawing on a number of
relevant
literature streams (downsizing, corporate re-
putation and social responsibility), a number
of hypotheses concerning the impact of
downsizing on the ﬁrm’s RCSP were devel-
oped and tested, with the main ﬁndings from
this study summed up as follows. First, it was
found that downsizing has a negative impact
on the ﬁrm’s RCSP. Secondly, when one
takes into consideration the type of manage-
rial action that was behind the downsizing of
a particular ﬁrm (layoffs and/or divestitures),
the impact from downsizing activities differs
between the two stakeholder groups investi-
gated here: industry executives and ﬁnancial
analysts. Finally,
it was found that higher
ﬁnancial performance prior to downsizing
leads to a greater negative impact on the
ﬁrm’s RCSP.

NOTE
(1) For example, Weinberger and Romeo (1989)
found that negative media attention has a
negative impact on corporate reputation, and
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) found that any
kind of increase in (negative, positive, mixed
or neutral) media attention has a negative
impact on corporate reputation. Moreover,
even though Wartick (1992: 43) found no
statistically signiﬁcant association between
changes in corporate reputation and changes
in the amount of media attention, he found
that the tone of media attention was ‘a key
factor associated with both the direction of
the change in corporate reputation and the
total movement of the change’.
