This study investigates the moderating role of culture and relationship age in the relationship between
customer-based corporate reputation (CBR) and customer loyalty using data from two service contexts
(retailing and fast-food restaurants) in three countries (France, the U.K., and the U.S.) that differ with regards
to two cultural values—uncertainty avoidance and time orientation. Results suggest that CBR has similar
effects on affective and intentional loyalty in all three countries. However, culture interacts with relationship
age, such that relationship age magniﬁes the effect of CBR in France, while relationship age suppresses CBR's
effect in the U.K. and the U.S. The authors provide explanations for these effects based on cultural theories.
Managerial and research implications are developed.

1. Introduction

Research into corporate reputation is enjoying a surge of
popularity in the management and marketing literatures (Johnson
and Grayson, 2005; Lafferty and Goldsmith, 1999; Veloutsou and
Moutinho, 2009). Studies show positive effects of corporate reputa-
tion on important downstream variables such as trust, word of mouth,
loyalty and spending (e.g., Caruana and Ewing, 2009; Graham and
Bansal, 2007; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Shamma and Hassan, 2009;
Walsh et al., 2009a, 2009b). However, researchers have paid little
attention to how culture affects various reputation–customer out-
come relationships, even though cultural values and norms are
important inﬂuences on how people interpret information and
behave (De Mooij, 2004; Hofstede, 2001).

Given this gap, this study examines how national culture
moderates the relationship between customer-based corporate
reputation (hereafter referred to as CBR) and affective and intentional
loyalty in countries or cultures differing in levels of uncertainty
avoidance (Hofstede, 2001). Customers view a ﬁrm's reputation as a
signal that helps them to predict the ﬁrm's future behavior, which
explains the risk-reducing function of corporate reputation (Fombrun

et al., 2000; Ruth and York, 2004; Walsh et al., 2009b). Thus, CBR may
be a particularly strong predictor of consumer behavior in cultures
with high uncertainty avoidance, where consumers seek to reduce
ambiguities and avoid unpredictable situations.

Another gap in the literature is how the age of the relationship
(RA) the customer has with the ﬁrm affects the relationship between
CBR and loyalty. “RA” refers to the amount of time (e.g., years)
customers spend in a business relationship. Raimondo et al. (2008)
call for more research on RA in relation to corporate reputation and
the present study heeds this call. However, examining the moderating
role of RA without specifying its interactions with culture provides
only a limited picture of RA's inﬂuence on consumers' reactions,
because cultural differences in how consumers decode signals and
behave relate to their time orientations (Hall, 1959; House, Hanges,
Jarvidan, Dorfman and Gupta (2004)). National culture may explain
why reputation–loyalty relationships vary over time, which previous
studies fail to examine. Thus, a second objective of this study focuses
on the moderating role of RA on CBR and customer loyalty based on
time orientation differences. Due to the greater long-term orientation
of the French versus U.K. or U.S. citizens, RA and culture may interact,
such that RA magniﬁes the positive effect of CBR on loyalty in France,
while suppressing CBR's effect in the U.K. and U.S.

Finally, although a good reputation is an important driver of
customer loyalty (Andreassen and Lindestad, 1998; Walsh et al.,
2009b), no study examines the impact of CBR on loyalty dimensions.
To gain insights as to how CBR affects customer loyalty, CBR's
differential effect on two dimensions of
loyalty—affective and
intentional (Oliver, 1997) receive attention here.

In summary, the present study extends previous work by assessing
1) the differential impact of corporate reputation on both affective
and intentional loyalty, 2) the moderating role of culture, and 3) the
interaction of culture and RA on the CBR–loyalty relationships.

2. Background and hypotheses

2.1. Corporate reputation from a customer perspective

Walsh and Beatty (2007, p. 129) deﬁne customer-based reputation
(CBR) as “the customer's overall evaluation of a ﬁrm based on his or her
reactions to the ﬁrm's goods, services, communication activities,
interactions with the ﬁrm and/or its representatives or constituencies
(such as employees, management, or other customers) and/or known
corporate activities.” CBR is a multi-dimensional attitude, comprised of
ﬁve dimensions: customer orientation, good employer, reliable and
ﬁnancially strong company, product and service quality, and social and
environmental responsibility. The CBR scale appears to be valid across
service contexts and cultures (Walsh et al., 2009a,b; Walsh and Beatty,
2007). Corporate reputation associates with key marketing outcomes,
such as trust (Fombrun and van Riel, 1997), satisfaction (Davies et al.,
2002), loyalty (Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Walsh et al., 2009b) and
customers' voluntary behaviors (Bartikowski and Walsh, 2011).

Regarding the CBR–loyalty link, previous studies predominantly
use unidimensional
loyalty measures (e.g., Shamma and Hassan,
2009; Walsh et al., 2009a,b). This tendency is a shortcoming because
investigating multiple dimensions of customer loyalty, such as
affective and intentional loyalty, allows for a better understanding
of real behaviors (e.g., Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001; Han et al.,
2008; Kumar, 2008; Oliver, 1997). Thus, this study employs measures
for both affective and intentional loyalty, and speciﬁes differences in
regards to how CBR links to them. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the
hypothesized effects.

2.2. Direct effects

transacting parties possess different amounts of information about
the transaction (e.g., Kirmani and Rao, 2000). Especially under
conditions of high uncertainty, customers search for more information
before making a decision (Erdem et al., 2002) to minimize or avoid
losses (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).

Customers' loyalty responses to reputation signals involve processes
of cognitive learning and recall. As a result, consumers store reputation
traits in their memories, as positive or negative associations with the
ﬁrm. The more the ﬁrm associates with positive traits, the more likely
customers are to make future purchases, as cognitive consistency theory
(Festinger, 1957) suggests.

This process of learning attitudinal dispositions and reacting to
them is in line with traditional hierarchy-of-effects models, which
posit that customers, before engaging in behavior, progress through a
sequence of information processing steps from building awareness
and arousing interest to cognitive and affective or emotional
evaluations (Palda, 1966). This theory suggests that behavior is the
outcome of a conscious and rational decision process. Kirmani and Rao
(2000, p. 66) argue that customers expect ﬁrms to honor the implicit
commitment conveyed through signals, because not doing so is
economically unwise. Although customers may show different
hierarchical sequences of reactions (Barry and Howard, 1990), a
growing research consensus suggests that cognitive and affective
evaluations of reputation signals ultimately form behavioral inten-
tions. Central to the idea of hierarchical reactions is the argument that
a favorable response at one level is a necessary, but not sufﬁcient
condition, for a favorable response at the next hierarchical level. The
basic pattern of cognitive and emotional reactions towards reputation
signals preceding behavior suggests that CBR more likely changes
affective loyalty in the earlier steps of the hierarchy ﬁrst and most
strongly. Thus, CBR's inﬂuence on affective loyalty may be stronger
and more positive than CBR's inﬂuence on intentional loyalty.

H1. CBR has a greater positive impact on affective loyalty than on
intentional loyalty.

Signaling theory suggests that customers use a company's
reputation as an external information cue to judge a ﬁrm's quality
and to form attitudes about the ﬁrm (cf. Spence, 1973; Walsh et al.,
2009b). The importance of signals as drivers of customers' attitudes
and behavior arises from information asymmetry—the premise that

2.3. Culture moderation

Cultural differences in terms of uncertainty avoidance (UA) may
particularly affect the way customers use reputation cues to develop
loyalty toward a ﬁrm. “UA” reﬂects a society's tolerance for uncertainty

and ambiguity. Following Hofstede (2001), France is particularly high
and the U.K. and U.S. are low on this dimension.

People from countries with higher UA scores tend to be more
resistant to change and shun ambiguous situations (Hofstede, 1980,
2001). This suggests that these individuals will be more reliant on
information cues, such as a ﬁrm's reputation in forming their attitudes
and behaviors. Erdem and his colleagues (Erdem et al., 2002) report a
greater effect of brand credibility on brand choice when individuals
are high on UA. Similarly, Reimann et al. (2008) show that the effect of
service quality (a dimension of reputation in the CBR scale) on
customer satisfaction is stronger for higher versus lower UA-cultures.
While customers from lower UA cultures also value credible ﬁrms,
they may use the ﬁrm's reputation less to guide their behavior.

longer-term relationships (Palmer and Schoorman, 1999; Usunier and
Lee, 2009). Anglo-Saxon cultures, such as the U.K. and the U.S., tend to
be monochronic (e.g., Graham, 1981; Hall, 1983), while Latin cultures,
such as the French, are more polychronic (Brodowsky et al., 2006; Hall
and Hall, 1990). In summary, long-lasting relationships may strength-
en the positive effect of CBR on loyalty in France. This effect is
predicted because the French are higher on LTO (Hofstede, 2001),
higher in past orientation House et al. (2004), and may be more
committed to relationships due to their greater use of polychronic
usage of time (Hall and Hall, 1990; Palmer and Schoorman, 1999;
Usunier and Lee, 2009) than people from the U.K. and U.S. On the
contrary, the positive effect of CBR will tend to wear off over time for
the more short-term orientated citizens of the U.K. and the U.S.

H2. National culture moderates the relationship between CBR and
customer loyalty, such that the relationship between CBR.

H3. The interaction of culture and RA moderates the relationships
between CBR and loyalty, such that:

H2a. Affective loyalty is weaker for respondents in lower UA countries
(U.K. and U.S.) than for respondents in a higher UA country (France).

H2b. Intentional
loyalty is weaker for respondents in lower UA
countries (U.K. and U.S.) than for respondents in a higher UA country
(France).

2.4. The moderation of relationship age (RA) by culture

The time customers spend in a business relationship may
moderate links between critical customer variables (cf., Raimondo
et al., 2008; Seiders, Voss, Grewal and Godfrey (2005); Verhoef, 2003).
For example, Verhoef et al. (2002) report a negative interaction
between commitment and RA, indicating that the positive effect of
commitment decreases over time. They argue that customers in later
phases of a relationship are more aware of the negative effects of long-
lasting relationships, such as higher switching cost. Similarly,
satisfaction is a strong determinant of intentional loyalty only in the
early stages of a relationship (Raimondo et al., 2008); thus, customers
may be more demanding over time, and the positive effect of
reputation on loyalty may wear off, producing a negative interaction
between RA and CBR on loyalty.

However, time orientations are different across cultures, which
muddy the picture. That is, not only does RA moderate the reputation–
loyalty relationship, but also this moderating effect differs across
cultures with different time orientations. Hofstede's (2001) long-term
orientation (LTO) dimension of culture emphasizes tradition, steadiness
and reciprocation. Bearden et al. (2006, p. 457) deﬁne LTO as “the
cultural value of viewing time holistically, valuing both the past and the
future, rather than deeming actions important only for their effects in
the here and now or the short term.” Thus, individuals higher on LTO
value planning, tradition and preserving relationships. The U.K. and the
U.S. cultures score lower on LTO than the French culture (Hofstede,
2001). Excluding Asian countries, France scores among the highest in
LTO (Hofstede, 2001). Thus, individuals from the U.K. and the U.S. may
be more short-term focused, while French customers may value long-
lasting relationships (Hofstede, 2001).

Similarly, the GLOBE study (House et al., 2002, 2004) suggests that
individuals in the U.K. and the U.S. are high in future orientation, while
French citizens are low on this dimension (Ashkanasy et al., 2002).
Future-oriented people focus on planning for a better tomorrow,
tending to lead them to neglect personal and social interactions; in
contrast, past-oriented people prefer sustaining favorable experiences,
often resulting in frequent repetition of past behaviors and maintenance
of established relationships (House et al., 2004; Keough et al., 1999).

Hall (1976, 1983), providing another perspective on cultural
differences in time orientation, differentiates between monochronic
and polychronic usage of time. Monochronic societies accustom to
short-term relationships, while polychronic individuals may have

3. Method

3.1. Samples and measures

In the three countries (France, the U.K., and the U.S.), marketing
students recruited a convenience sample of individuals to complete an
online survey. This approach appears in other studies, as well (e.g.,
Arnold and Reynolds, 2003; Walsh and Beatty, 2007). In the present
study, the researchers forwarded a hyperlink to an online question-
naire to qualiﬁed respondents, who evaluated a self-chosen service
provider in one of two categories: retailing or fast food. These service
categories are similar with respect to their higher levels of tangible
components, the presence of contact personal, low exit barriers and
overall low provider selection risk for customers, with the assumption
of no category effects (tested later). Respondents ﬁrst named a retail
company (fast-food restaurant) they know from experience. Next,
they evaluated the reputation of the chosen company and indicated
their affective and intentional loyalty on multi-item Likert-type scales
(1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Speciﬁcally, 15 items
from Walsh and Beatty (2007) capture the ﬁve dimensions of CBR.

Four items for each dimension of loyalty, drawn and adapted from
Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001) and Arnold and Reynolds (2003),
measure affective and intentional loyalties. The items for affective
loyalty measure respondents' feelings about the relationship they
have with the chosen company, and the items for intentional loyalty
measure their intentions to do business with this company in the
future. Additionally, an item asking the respondents for the length of
time they did business with the ﬁrm measures RA. All items appear in
the appendix. The French questionnaire underwent a standard
translation-back-translation procedure with two bilingual native
English and two bilingual native French speakers (Van Auken et al.,
2006), with no problems noted.

Table 1 provides a description of the sample (n=1105 across the
three countries), as well as mean years of relationships with their
chosen company. The χ²-independence tests suggest that demo-
graphics (age and gender) are not contingent on country (p N.1).
Finally, the researchers contacted 10% of the respondents to validate
the sample, with no problems noted.

3.2. Measurement evaluation

The measurement model was evaluated separately from the
structural relations between the constructs in terms of cross-
category- and cross-cultural measurement invariance (Steenkamp
and Baumgartner, 1998), as well as convergent and discriminant
validity (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). First, exploratory factor
analyses (EFA), using an oblique (PROMAX) rotation, was conducted
for each country and service category. All items load in all countries on
their target factors, and all models explain more than 69% of the
variance; thus, the assumed factor structure is reasonable.

In the next step, the researchers assessed the cross-category
measurement invariance of the data within the countries and then,
they assessed whether the direct effects of CBR on affective and
intentional loyalties are contingent on the service category. Country-
wise multigroup modeling was used with the service categories as
groups. The results of a series of χ²-differences tests suggest full
measurement invariance across service categories (p N.1 in all
countries), as well as equality of the direct effects of CBR on affective
and intentional loyalties across categories (p N.1 in all countries),
allowing for data pooling.

Next, the researchers investigated cross-cultural measurement
invariance by conducting a multi-group CFA with the three countries
as groups and CBR as a reﬂective ﬁve-dimensional second-order
construct (Walsh and Beatty, 2007). The model ﬁt was excellent
(Table 2: Baseline Model A). The analysis supports conﬁgural
invariance, with the items loading substantially on their target factors
and the correlations between the factors below unity in all countries.
Next, the researchers tested metric invariance by constraining the
factor loadings to be the same across the countries (Table 2: Model B).
The increase in χ² is signiﬁcant (p b.01), suggesting decreased ﬁt
compared to the baseline model A. Thus, the analysis does not support
full measurement invariance across the countries. Partial measure-
ment equivalence is a reasonable compromise for cross-cultural
comparisons to be meaningful (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998).
To test for partial metric invariance, equality constraints were relaxed

for items with comparably high modiﬁcation indices (MI), and for
which item content may differ across the cultures based on the
researchers' judgment. Partial measurement invariance occurred after
relaxing one equality constraint per ﬁrst-order construct (see
Appendix). The χ² difference tests indicate equality (p N.05) of the
partially constrained model C compared to the baseline model A
(Table 2).

Next, the researchers examined the convergent and discriminant
validity of the measures. Cronbach's α are greater than .8 for all
constructs in all countries, and average variance extracted (AVEs) are
consistently greater than .5 (Table 3). The AVEs are greater than the
squared correlation between the constructs (Table 3). Thus, conver-
gent and discriminant validity of the measured constructs exist across
the three countries' data (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).

3.3. Test of the hypotheses

Regression analysis provides a reasonable approach for estimat-
ing direct as well as interaction effects of continuous variables and
thus, tests the hypotheses in this study (Baron and Kenny, 1986;
Frazier et al., 2004). Speciﬁcally, two multiple regression models
(one for each loyalty dimension) are conducted per country.
Composites were computed for CBR and the two loyalty dimensions,
while for RA, the natural logarithm was computed, assuming that
the effects of RA are not linear but diminish at higher levels (e.g.
Raimondo et al., 2008; Verhoef et al., 2002). Diminishing effects of
RA may exist at higher levels because of diminishing sensitivity, as
described in prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).
Predictor and moderator variables are z-transformed (Frazier et
al., 2004). The models also include interaction terms, computed by
multiplying the standardized scores for CBR with the standardized
natural logarithm of RA, which allows for a test of the moderating
role of RA. All regressions are signiﬁcant (p b.01) with R2s between
.36 and .47 (Table 4).

Hypothesis H1 assumes that CBR is associated with a higher
increase in affective loyalty than intentional
loyalty. Within the
countries, the two loyalty dimensions stem from the same sample of
respondents, so they are dependent. Williams' (1959) test is the most
appropriate for testing the difference between correlations for
dependent variables (Steiger, 1980). The test yields a t-value to
compare the correlations between the dependent variables, while also
factoring in their correlations with the predictor variable. The results
indicate that the relationship between CBR and affective loyalty is
greater than that of CBR and intentional loyalty in all countries
(Table 4). However, the differences are signiﬁcant only for France (.61
vs. .53; (p b.05)) and the U.K. (.67 vs. .61; (p b.05)), but not for the U.S.
(.61 vs. .59). Thus, the analysis partially supports H1.

Hypothesis H2 posits that national culture moderates the CBR–
loyalty relationships, such that the links between CBR and affective
loyalty (H2a) and intentional loyalty (H2b) should be stronger for
French respondents than for individuals from the U.K. and the U.S. To
test the hypotheses, the non-standardized regression coefﬁcients
associated with CBR are compared between cultures, separately for

each loyalty model. Results indicate that the relationships between
CBR and affective loyalty are in the hypothesized direction but not
statistically different in comparing the French and U.K. data, failing to
support H2a (.47 vs. .45; p N.05). However, in comparing the French
and U.S. data, the differences are signiﬁcant, as hypothesized (.47 vs.

pattern of results occurs for intentional
loyalty, that is, the
relationship between CBR and intentional loyalty is not different for
France versus the U.K. (.42 vs. .40; p N.05), whereas the difference is in
the hypothesized direction for France versus the U.S. (.42 vs.
.31;
p b.05). Thus, the analysis partially supports H2b.

Following Hypothesis H3, culture and relationship age (RA) should
interact to affect the relationships between CBR and customers'
affective and intentional
loyalties differentially. Speciﬁcally, the
expectation was that RA would magnify the positive effect of CBR
on affective and intentional loyalties in the French data (H3a, b), while
suppressing the effect in the U.K. and the U.S. data (H3c, d). The
analysis supports these hypotheses.
In the French sample, the
interaction terms (CBR ⁎ RA) are positive and different from zero
(AFF: .09; BEH: .11; p b.01), indicating the effect of CBR on loyalty
tends to increase over time or age of the relationship, supporting H3a
and H3b (Table 4). For the U.K. and the U.S. samples the interaction
terms are negative for both affective (U.K.: −.10; U.S.: −.07; p b.01)
and intentional loyalty (U.K.: −.11; U.S.: −.08; p b.05), supporting H3c
and H3d, that is, over time or relationship age the effect of reputation
on loyalty decreases for respondents in these countries.

The study delivers new insights beyond the known positive effects
of CBR on affective and intentional loyalty. First, the study partially
conﬁrms that there is a hierarchy-of-effects effect, with CBR having a
stronger impact on affective than on intentional loyalty in France and
the U.K., as hypothesized in H1. Thus, in these countries CBR seems to
be more effective in changing affective loyalty over intentional loyalty.
However, the data from the U.S. sample do not exhibit the same
hierarchy-of-effects' effect. Here, the effects of CBR are comparably
weaker and yet similar in strength for both loyalty dimensions. This
ﬁnding may be due to differences in uncertainty avoidance (UA) of
these cultures. While Hofstede (2001) suggests that the French are
higher on UA than U.K. or U.S. citizens, the GLOBE study shows that
the U.S. (country mean: 4.15) scores lowest on this dimension, while
France (country mean: 4.43) and the U.K. (country mean: 4.65) score
higher (Ashkanasy et al., 2002; House et al., 2004). Thus, the study's
results resonate with ﬁndings from the GLOBE study, suggesting that
individuals from France and the U.K. are more resistant to changing
intentions after a change in attitude, than Americans, due to their
greater tendency to avoid uncertain outcomes.

Second, the relationships between CBR and customer loyalties may
differ between individuals from high versus low UA countries. Study
results show that the links between CBR and affective/intentional
loyalty are weaker in the U.S. than in France, as hypothesized.
However, no such differences exist in comparing French and U.K. data.
While these results partially refute H2, they again resonate with the
classiﬁcation of the U.K. as a high UA country according to the GLOBE
study (Ashkanasy et al., 2002). Thus, based on the GLOBE study, UA
appears to offer an adequate explanation for the link between CBR and
loyalty in the U.K., which is equivalent to the link found in France, and
stronger than in the U.S. Several authors address the deﬁnition of
cultural value dimensions, the methods used to assess them, the
meaning of the proposed country scores, as well as their appropri-
ateness for hypotheses generation (e.g., Hofstede, 2006; Javidan et al.,
2006; Schwartz and Bilsky, 1990; Soares et al., 2007). The present
study contributes to this discussion in that the GLOBE classiﬁcation on
the UA dimension (relative to the three countries studied here)
appears to better reﬂect the idea that reputation signals reduce
consumption-related uncertainties and ambiguities more so in high
versus low UA cultures.

Third, the effects of reputation appear to depend on the length of
customer-business relationships (RA), while the moderating role of
RA may vary across cultures due to cultural differences in time-
orientation. RA interacts with culture such that RA magniﬁes the
positive effect of CBR on loyalty in France (a rather long-term oriented
culture), but suppresses this effect in the U.K. and the U.S. (where both
cultures are more short-term oriented), supporting H3. These ﬁndings
suggest that looking at RA alone, without taking into account cultural
circumstances, provides a less than complete picture.

4.1. Managerial issues

The strength of reputation signals varies across cultures depending
on the cultural value of UA. Reputation is most effective in improving
loyalty in cultures higher on UA, based on the GLOBE study. The study
also shows that a hierarchy-of-effects concept may apply, such that
affective loyalty precedes intentional
loyalty. Managers should
consider that changes in customer behavior might be a consequence
of successively changing affective and intentional loyalty.

However, this hierarchy is not the same for all cultures. While
customers from France and the UK show hierarchical reactions, such
that the effects of overall CBR on affective loyalty are stronger than on
intentional loyalty, no such hierarchy exists for customers from the
US.

Thus, management should evaluate the effectiveness of reputa-
tion-building programs at different levels of loyalty to improve the
diagnostic value of reputation assessments. Additionally, managers
should consider that not all dimensions of CBR are equally effective in
inﬂuencing loyalty at its different levels. Investigating how the single
dimensions of CBR affect attitudinal or intentional loyalty may guide
managers in determining a mix of reputation signals that most
effectively inﬂuence affective or intentional loyalty.

Finally, differences across cultures appear when relationship age is
considered. Speciﬁcally long-term oriented (LTO) French customers
tend to build stronger relationships with their service provider over
time, suggesting that a long-lasting relationship complements and
reinforces the reputation cue in this culture. On the contrary, low LTO
customers from the U.K. and the U.S. seem less prone to use reputation
in the later stages of their relationships, and thus, the positive effects
of CBR-related perceptions wear off over time. This ﬁnding indicates
that a service ﬁrm's focus on their reputation for customers from the
U.K. and the U.S. should occur early in the relationship, because
investing in reputation development later in the relationship may not
be as valuable. However, service managers in France could beneﬁt
from nurturing their customers' perceptions of the ﬁrm's reputation
throughout the lifetime of the relationship.

4.2. Limitations and future research

As with all empirical studies, this study suffers some limitations.
First, the contexts involved may offer only limited generalizability
since both settings are low in involvement and risk. Future research
might explore these issues across diverse service contexts. Services for
which customers perceive higher switching risks (such as banking)
may provide different results with respect to the moderating roles of
culture and RA. However, given that the ﬁndings applied equally well
in both contexts is encouraging.

Second, this study analyzes data at a particular point in time,
which assumes that no time lag exists between a good reputation and
customers' affective and intentional loyalty. A good reputation builds
over time, but can also take a hit through a corporate crisis or service
failures. Future research should use longitudinal data to explore how
reputation evolves and how long it takes to affect relevant
downstream variables meaningfully. Instead of using self-reported
data for relationship age and loyalty, researchers might use behavioral
data, for example from CRM databases.

Third, noting that this sample is a convenience sample, the
representativeness of the data collected or the countries chosen is
unknown. For example, additional differences across these countries
in other cultural values or based on other aspects (e.g. the
infrastructure of the industries selected) are not accounted for.
Moreover, future researchers should measure cultural values individ-
ually, rather than assuming their values from their country of
residence.

4.3. Conclusion

To gain a better understanding of the CBR–outcomes link, the
differential effect of different types of moderators need examination.
This study draws from existing research and incorporates two
moderators, culture and relationship age. By showing the differential
effect of these variables on the relationships between CBR and several
loyalty dimensions, this study contributes to the theoretical and
methodological discourse on this topic. Further, by demonstrating the
moderating role of relationship age, this study offers international
service managers an effective way to view and manage corporate
reputation and loyalty. We hope this research encourages further
research on the boundary conditions surrounding the inﬂuence of
corporate reputation.
