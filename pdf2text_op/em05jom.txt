This study proposes and tests a model for top-management influence on innovations. Three
research questions are addressed: Is top managers’ influence on innovation a function of their
leadership? Does socio-cultural context directly affect leadership? and, Does sociocultural con-
text moderate the relationship of leadership with top-management influence on innovation? These
questions are investigated with data from 12 European countries. The results show that leadership
factors have strong effects on top-management innovation influence. In support of the culture-spe-
cific view of leadership, sociocultural context directly influences leadership and moderates its
relationship with organizational innovation.

modern corporation . . . lies more in its intellectualcapabilities than in its hard assets” (2002:
4). Successful innovation requires an active and highly sophisticated coordination of the
efforts of a number of key participants (Bundy, 2002; Henry, 2001): idea generators, gatekeep-
ers, innovators, intrapreneurs, project leaders, and innovation champions. The last ones
defend the innovation against the tide of opponents, make sure that the new ideas will be intro-
duced coherently within the company’s policies and strategies, and motivate employees to
implement those new ideas. Although top managers play many of these roles, they get
engaged most often as innovation champions (Drucker, 1985; Howell & Higgins, 1990;
Kickul & Gundry, 2001).

There are numerous studies on innovation (Bundy, 2002), but important questions still
remain unanswered. Two debates stand out. First, although the innovation literature and theo-
ries of leadership effectiveness (e.g., Howell & Avolio, 1993; Howell & Higgins, 1990) por-
tray top managers as natural leaders who can greatly influence innovation and the organiza-
tion’s chances of survival and growth, organizational ecology research downplays the role of
micro-level factors. Among them are managers’ choices and top managers’ (TM) leadership.
Second, some leadership researchers (cf. Bass, 1996, 1998) have put forward the idea that cer-
tain leadership factors (particularly, transformational leadership) are universally endorsed and
effective. However, cross-cultural researchers (Bjerke, 1999; Elenkov, 2002; Hosftede, 2001;
Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner, 2002) argue that the endorsement and effectiveness of a
given leadership factor are culture-specific. In particular, those researchers assert that (a)
meeting followers’ expectations of leader behavior is likely to result in higher leadership
effectiveness, and (b) followers’ expectations critically depend on the specificity of the socio-
cultural context.

In light of these controversies, several interrelated issues merit further research. In the first
place, what is the extent to which leadership factors affect TM influence on innovations, an
important aspect of innovation? Surprisingly, innovation research has paid relatively little
attention to this topic. Second, what is the impact, if any, of social culture on TM leadership?
Third, does sociocultural context affect the impact of TM leadership on TM innovation influ-
ence, and how? We expect that research on the third issue could confirm or disprove whether
national (social) culture is a contextual variable likely to moderate the effects of leadership
(Antonakis, Avolio, & Sivasubramaniam, 2003). This is important for clarifying whether
given leadership factors are universal or culture-specific.

We integrate the concepts of leadership, sociocultural context, and strategic innovation in
developing a conceptual model on TM influence on innovation, in which we suggest that (a)
TM influence on innovation is a function of TM leadership factors, (b) sociocultural context
directly affects leadership factors, and (c) sociocultural context moderates the relationship of
TM leadership factors with TM influence on innovation (Figure 1).

TM Leadership and Influence on Innovation

Although the concept of leadership has existed throughout recorded history (Dorfman,
1996), researchers still disagree about its importance. On one hand, organizational ecology

theory suggests that the environment determines organizational structure and influences orga-
nizational systems not through choice by managers but by selecting out those organizations
that do not fit (Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Environmental forces drive the evolution of organi-
zations, and populations of organizations survive or fail regardless of the actions taken by
managers. Accordingly, managerial actions, including leadership, are conceptualized to have
little effect on organizational outcomes. Organizational ecology theory has provided a basis
for hundreds of studies into the fate of organizations and industries and has evolved into a par-
adigm that according to some researchers (e.g., Van Witteloostuijn, 2000) has a “bright
future.”

On the other hand, research on innovation (Henry, 2001; Sastry, 1999; West, Borrill,
Dawson, Brodbeck, Shapiro, & Haward, 2003) and leader effectiveness studies (e.g., Den
Hartog & Verburg, 1997; Howell & Avolio, 1993; Howell & Higgins, 1990) posit that TMs
positively influence outcomes of innovation processes in organizations. Research on innova-
tion has devoted increasing attention on the effects of leadership on various aspects of those
processes (Howell & Avolio, 1993; Sastry, 1999; West et al., 2003). Notably, West and col-
leagues (2003) have recently found that leadership has strong influence on creativity and inno-
vation, as the reported standardized regression coefficients have been above .50.

Leadership effectiveness studies have sought to identify the components of effective lead-
ership and to measure its outcomes. Thus, Howell and Avolio (1993) have found that the com-
ponents of TM leadership are closely associated with TM support for innovation. Kisfalvi and
Pitcher (2003) have provided evidence that the CEO character—and by extension, leader-
ship—has a critical impact on organizational processes and strategic choices that affect
innovation.

The full-range leadership theory (FRLT; Avolio, 1999; Bass, 1985, 1998) has been one of
the most important recent developments in leadership studies. It presents leadership through
three higher order factors: transformational leadership, developmental/transactional leader-
ship, and corrective/avoidant leadership (Avolio, Bass, & Jung, 1999), which comprise nine
lower order factors (Antonakis et al., 2003). Transformational leadership encompasses four
lower factors: idealized influence (attributed) referring to the degree to which the leader is per-
ceived as being confident and powerful and focusing on higher order ideals, idealized influ-
ence (behavior) describing the leader’s charismatic actions that convey a sense of values and
mission, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation. Developmental/transactional
leadership consists of two components: individualized consideration and contingent reward
leadership. Last, corrective/avoidant leadership encompasses three components: active man-
agement by exception that takes place when the leader looks for mistakes and introduces rules
to prevent them, passive management by exception referring to situations when the leader
intervenes after noncompliance has occurred or when mistakes have already been made, and
laissez-faire leadership.

Leadership factors affect TM influence on innovation in several ways: through internaliza-
tion/personal identification, encouraging diversity of opinions, providing protected environ-
ments, and compliance (Henry, 2001; Nutt, 2002; Yukl, 2002). For example, the leader’s ide-
alized influence and inspirational motivation behaviors may influence the outcomes of
innovation through two related and complementary mechanisms: internalization and personal
identification. Internalization refers to a process in which followers accept the leader’s values
as their own, whereas personal identification occurs when followers seek to emulate a leader’s
behavior (Yukl, 2002). When the leader’s values emphasize innovation, his or her idealized
influence and inspirational motivation behaviors induce followers to accept these values as
their own (internalization) and imitate the leader’s behavior (personal identification). Follow-
ers engage in innovation-enhancing activities because they seek to gain approval from the
leader to satisfy their needs for acceptance and esteem. Howell and Avolio (1993) found sup-
port for a positive relationship between intellectual stimulation and leaders’ support for inno-
vation. A leader’s intellectual stimulation behavior is closely associated with encouraging
diversity of opinions, which stimulates new ideas and experimentation that are integral parts
of the innovation process (Bundy, 2002; Henry, 2001).

Furthermore, a leader’s individualized consideration provides a protected environment that
facilitates organizational innovation (Nutt, 2002). Contingent-reward leadership and active
management by exception influence innovation through inducing compliance (Yukl, 2002).
Followers carry out the leader’s requests or directions to obtain promised rewards or to avoid a
punishment. Thus, contingent reward leadership and active management by exception rely on
open communication, which is important for innovation (Kickul & Gundry, 2001).

The influence of TM on innovation is described by the perceptions of the key actors in the
innovation process concerning the extent of TM influence on recent and shortly anticipated
outcomes of the innovation process. We have studied TM influence on two types of strategic
innovation—product/market innovations and organizational innovations—that have been
brought forward in the research by Hoffman and Hegarty (1993) and others.

Product/Market Innovation

TMs rarely influence product/market innovations directly because their involvement may
be counterproductive if perceived as “micromanagement.” These innovations are often carried
out by lower and middle-level managers and nonmanagerial employees. TMs influence such
innovations mostly indirectly through allowing autonomy and encouraging intrapreneurial or
corporate venturing behavior (Burgelman, 1983). Their leadership behaviors are important.
For example, through contingent reward leadership, a manager sets up expectations and objec-
tives for product/market innovations and commits to rewarding successes. Exercising ideal-
ized influence, TMs who have been successful product or market innovators themselves may
serve as role models to subordinates. Leaders also provide inspirational motivation through
challenging followers to do their best work (Avolio, 1999; Bass, 1998). This logically implies
stronger TM influence on product/market innovations.

Hypothesis 1a: Leadership explains a significant amount of the variance in top management influ-

ence on product/market innovations.

Organizational Innovation

TM influence on organizational innovations is rather different from their influence on
product/market innovations. First, whereas the latter is geared externally toward the market,
the former aims at making changes that are essentially internal to the organization. Second,
although the impact of TMs on successful product/market innovation is indirect, they have to
get both indirectly and directly involved in the process of organizational innovation to secure
its success. By virtue of their positions, TMs directly influence organizational innovations as
they set up the organizational structure, processes, and culture that support innovation and
take a leadership role in implementing organizational innovation. Third, although most prod-
uct/market innovations are discrete, most organizational innovations are epitomized by con-
tinuous processes that often permeate the whole organization (Westphal & Gulati, 1997). For
example, innovations in the organizational structure often encourage integration across many
departments and functions (Kanter, 1985).

TMs are often able to resolve the uncertainty inherent in organizational innovation through
formulating and communicating a compelling vision (Den Hartog & Verburg, 1997). Through
idealized influence, TMs mobilize the trust and respect that subordinates have toward them to
lend credence to organizational innovations. Through contingent reward leadership, TMs
establish the goals of organizational innovations and the criteria on which employees will be
judged. Using individualized consideration leadership, TMs provide coaching and support to
aid the implementation of organizational innovation. When they practice manage by excep-
tion, they monitor the shortcomings of organizational innovation and introduce corrections.
They may also use intellectual stimulation to promote followers’efforts and creativity through
questioning assumptions and reframing problems, thus increasing TM influence on organiza-
tional innovation. Hence, leadership factors will be related to organizational innovation as well:

Hypothesis 1b: Leadership explains a significant amount of the variance in top management influ-

ence on organizational innovations.

Sociocultural Context and Leadership

Social culture influences the way in which decisions in organizations are made, including
decisions concerning innovations (Hofstede, 2001; Schneider & Barsoux, 2003; Shane,
1992). The study of social culture has been profoundly influenced by Hofstede (1980, 2001)
who has identified five cultural-value dimensions that represent the essence of national or
social culture: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism (as opposed to collectiv-
ism), masculinity (as opposed to femininity), and long-term orientation. Other conceptualiza-
tions about how social cultures differ have been offered by Schwartz (1992) and Trompenaars
(1993). Schwartz and his associates identified three polar dimensions of social culture:
embeddedness versus autonomy, hierarchy versus egalitarianism, and mastery versus har-
mony. Trompenaars (1993) defined and empirically supported five cultural dimensions: uni-
versalism versus particularism, individualism versus collectivism (communitarianism), neu-
tral versus emotional, specific versus diffuse, and achievement versus ascription. He also
examined the ways in which people deal with the concept of time and relate to the environ-
ment. A recent analysis of Trompenaars’s data (Smith, Dugan, & Trompenaars, 1996) yielded
two main dimensions of sociocultural variation: loyal involvement–utilitarian involvement
and conservatism–egalitarian commitment.

Sociocultural Context

One cannot help noticing that the conceptualizations offered by Hofstede, Schwartz, and
Trompenaars share some remarkable similarities, despite being conducted at different times,
with different samples, and using different methods. For example, Hofstede’s individual-
ism-collectivism is quite similar to Schwartz’s embeddedness-autonomy and Trompenaars’s
individualism-collectivism (communitarianism). Hofstede’s power distance appears to
be very similar to Schwartz’s hierarchy-egalitarianism and Trompenaars’s conservatism–
egalitarian commitment. This consistency of results lends validity to the approach of investi-
gating differences in social cultures by focusing on differences in sets of sociocultural values.
We have decided to use Hofstede’s cultural-value dimensions in this study because they have
been widely used to measure culture as a factor at the macro-environmental level that affects
managerial choices, leadership factors, and organizational innovations (e.g., Ardichvili &
Kuchinke, 2002; Chong & Park, 2003; Elenkov, 1998; Shane, 1992).

Research on leadership in the Western countries has focused on the ability of individuals to
influence organizational members toward the accomplishment of goals (Yukl, 2002). Most
recently, some researchers have argued that there is a trend toward universalism for leadership.
In particular, Bass stated that “although the model of transformational and transactional lead-
ership may have needs for adjustments and fine-tuning as we move across cultures, particu-
larly into non-Western, overall, it holds up as having considerable universal potential” (1996:
754).

However, a number of recent studies suggest that sociocultural context could greatly influ-
ence the leadership process and effectiveness of leadership factors as well as the endorsement
of leadership factors in a particular social culture (Ardichvili & Kuchinke, 2002; Brodbeck
et al., 2000; Elenkov, 2002; Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner, 2002; Zander, 1997). Different
leadership prototypes would be expected to occur in societies that have different sociocultural
profiles (Dorfman, 1996; Hofstede, 2001). The evaluation and meaning of leader behaviors
and characteristics may also greatly vary in different sociocultural contexts (Trompenaars &
Hampden-Turner, 2002). Recent research has suggested that leadership factors should be con-
sistent with the dominant sociocultural values in order to be effective. Supporters of this view
argue that, first, people from different cultures may have different ideas and expectations about
the nature of leaders and leadership. Second, individuals are perceived as leaders to the extent
to which their behaviors match the behavior expected of a prototypical leader. Third, meeting
followers’ higher perceptions of leadership behavior is likely to result in higher leadership
effectiveness (Thomas & Ravlin, 1995). In brief, the culture-specific leadership view posits
that differences in the sociocultural context influence who is likely to be perceived as a leader
and what leadership behavior is most likely to be effective. We, therefore, propose the
following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: Sociocultural context explains a significant amount of the variance in leadership

factors.

The Moderating Role of Sociocultural Context

National (social) culture is a contextual variable likely to moderate the effects of leadership
(Antonakis et al., 2003). Hoffman and Hegarty (1993) provided empirical evidence that social
culture affects the relationship of managerial activities to TM innovation influence. Tyler,
Lind, and Huo (1995) showed that subordinates exposed to the influence of low–power dis-
tance social values are more likely than followers in high–power distance societies to have
stronger personal connections with superiors and to identify more closely with the goals set by
the leaders. This implies that followers in a relatively lower power distance culture are more
likely to get actively involved in innovation processes promoted by TMs and to perceive stron-
ger TM influence on innovation.

Indeed, one may argue that the effects of leadership on criterion variables would possibly
be influenced by the sociocultural context. For example, the effects of contingent reward lead-
ership—a behavior focused on clarifying role and task requirements and providing followers
with material or psychological rewards contingent on the fulfillment of contractual obliga-
tions—would reasonably be stronger in low–power distance cultures (in which trust between
the parties involved in the transaction may come more easily). In contrast, the effects of ideal-
ized influence (attributed)—a leadership factor essentially referring to whether the leader is
perceived as being confident and powerful—would logically be much stronger in high–power
distance sociocultural contexts (in which employees expect more assertive and autocratic
leadership). In addition, the effects of idealized influence (behavior)—a leadership factor
referring to charismatic actions of the leader that are centered on values, beliefs, and a sense of
mission—would understandably be greater in high–uncertainty avoidance sociocultural con-


388

texts (in which the followers find it natural to turn to a leader in their search for answers to the
most pressing problems). However, the effects of intellectual stimulation—a behavior essen-
tially referring to leader actions that challenge followers to think creatively—would logically
be stronger in low–uncertainty avoidance cultures (characterized by support for risk taking
and acceptance of new changes).

Moreover, one could argue that the effects of both active and passive management by
exception—leadership behaviors involving punitive corrective actions—would be greatly
magnified in highly masculine cultures (in which self-assertiveness, task orientation, and less
caring for the feelings of others are dominant values). In contrast, the effects of inspirational
motivation (a behavior referring to the ways leaders energize their followers) and individual-
ized consideration (a factor referring to leader behavior that contributes to follower satisfac-
tion by advising, supporting, and paying attention to the individual needs of followers) would
be both highly amplified in low-masculinity sociocultural contexts, in which caring for others
and nurturing followers’ ideas are dominant values. Therefore, we propose that sociocultural
values affect in a complex way the relationship of TM leadership to TM innovation influence.
We expect that the moderation effects of sociocultural context will be stronger if the diversity
along cultural-value dimensions is greater.

Hypothesis 3a: Sociocultural context moderates the impact of TM leadership on product/market

innovations.

Hypothesis 3b: Sociocultural context moderates the impact of TM leadership on organizational

innovations.

Method

Sampling Plan

The data for the present study were collected at several stages. Initially, government
sources were used to derive a sample of 468 single-business firms or business units located in
12 European nations. Titular heads (e.g., CEOs or presidents) of each one of the firms or busi-
ness units included in the initial sample were asked to participate in the study. Upon agree-
ment, those business leaders were requested to provide information about the main product(s),
age and size (i.e., number of employees) of their organizational units, as well as contact infor-
mation for up to five more top-level managers (i.e., managers who were their immediate sub-
ordinates) and for up to five key participants in the innovation processes (e.g., idea generators,
intrapreneurs, or project leaders).

The titular heads of 297 European firms or business units formally agreed to participate and
provided the requested information. At the next stage, 2,271 surveys were mailed out to the
already identified individuals. The surveys had two versions. The first one was for the TMs
immediately subordinated to the titular heads, and it included items from the latest publicly
available version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, but not measures of TM inno-
vation influence. The second one was for the other key participants in the innovation process,
and it included items measuring TM innovation influence, but not measures of leadership fac-

tors. This way, the survey design resolved one of the most serious problems associated with
leadership research—measuring both leadership factors and the effects of leadership using
one and the same source of information. The questionnaires were translated into French,
Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Russian because these languages repre-
sent the working languages of the surveyed respondents. For each survey, the English version
of the respective questionnaire was translated into another language and then back-translated
into English to ensure semantic reliability (Brislin, 1980). Differences between the translation
and the back-translation for each version were reconciled by the translator, the back-translator,
and a third person fluent in the respective language. In addition, survey components were
included in the study only after their cross-cultural equivalence was established following pro-
cedures recommended by Van de Vijver and Leung (1997).

A total of 1,774 individuals (270 titular heads, 783 immediate subordinates, and 721 key
participants in the innovation processes) provided complete and usable sets of data. This rep-
resented a 78% response rate. The respondents in that sample were 68% male and 32% female.
The 270 business units were located in the following countries: 15 in Belgium, 28 in France,
23 in Spain, 34 in Germany, 14 in the German part of Switzerland, 21 in Austria, 16 in Norway,
24 in Sweden, 23 in Finland, 34 in Russia, 22 in Ukraine, and 16 in Belarus. These were either
single-business firms (54%) or distinct business units (46%) of diversified companies.

Measures

TM influence on product/market and organizational innovation. We used two dependent
variables—influence of TMs on product/market and on organizational innovation—which we
developed and validated for this study. We measured them through the perceptions of key
actors in the innovation process about the extent of TM influence on recent or shortly antici-
pated outcomes of the innovation process. This approach reflects the presence of a time lag
between management actions on innovation and the final results of innovation processes
(Bundy, 2002; Henry, 2001).

We used Hoffman and Hegarty’s (1993) scales for Product/Market Innovation and Admin-
istrative Innovation Decision, as well as the one by Hoffman (1999) for Influence on Organi-
zational Innovations as a point of departure. The relatively small number of items in those
scales (implying a threat to content validity) and our review of the extant literature on innova-
tion management prompted us to do additional work and improve these measures. Conse-
quently, we used Smith and McCarthy’s (1995) Expert Judges Review Procedure (EJRP) to
develop measures that would provide an adequate representation of the respective constructs.
For this purpose, we selected nine experts enrolled in an Executive MBA Program at a major
university in the northeastern United States. We supplied them with descriptions of the specifi-
cations of the domains of product/market innovations and organizational innovations, based
on the information provided by Damanpour (1996), Hoffman and Hegarty (1993), and
Hoffman (1999). We then asked the expert judges to review the match between item represen-
tation and construct domain specifications and to add or delete items. That procedure was fol-
lowed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed with LISREL VIII (Jöreskog &
Sörbom, 1996) using an analysis sample of 145 managers working for companies in the

midsouthern states. The results from CFA provided evidence for content validity of the newly
developed measures for product/market and organizational innovation (Table 1).

Next, we followed Bagozzi, Yi, and Phillips (1991) who recommended CFA as a superior
technique to the traditional factor analysis and multitrait/multimethod approaches for examin-
ing construct validity of scale measures. We also took advantage of Judd and McClelland’s
(1998) integrated conception of construct validity emphasizing the importance of convergent
and discriminant validity. The average variance R2 for the items loading on both product/mar-
ket (.67) and organizational innovation (.61) exceeded the minimum threshold of .50, thus
providing evidence for convergent validity (Carr, 2002; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). The
squared correlation between the two constructs (.48) was smaller than the average R2 for each
of them, providing evidence for their discriminant validity.

We performed a CFA on a second sample to confirm the goodness of fit of the newly devel-
oped measures. This replication sample consisted of 121 managers working for companies in
the northeastern states. The Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) was .96, the Adjusted Good-
ness-of-Fit Index (AGFI) was .95, and the root mean square residual (RMSR) was .04, respec-
tively, indicating a very good fit for the two-factor model (Bentler, 1990). The internal consis-
tency reliability (Cronbach’s a) of the scale for product market innovation was .79 and for
organizational innovation was .77.

The survey on TM innovation influence included instructions to the respondents—all of
whom were key participants in innovation processes at their business units—to rate the extent
of TM influence on the items for product/market and organizational innovation using a 5-point
Likert-type scale (1 = no influence, 5 = dominant influence). Individual ratings for TM influ-
ence on innovation at each of the business units were averaged. Respondents were instructed
to consider the TM influence on recent innovations (during the past year) as well as on speci-
fied innovations that they anticipated would take place in the nearest future (within the next
2 years).

Sociocultural context. The sociocultural context was operationalized by using Hofstede’s
cultural-value indices for power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity,
and long-term orientation. Hosftede’s cultural-value orientations have been used in many
cross-cultural studies but at the same time have been a subject of intense scholarly debate (cf.
Baskerville, 2003; McSweeney, 2002). Although it is outside the scope of this article to com-
ment on the arguments of the researchers involved in that discussion, we note that Hofstede’s
cultural-value indexes were theoretically substantiated (cf. Ricks, Toyne, & Martinez, 1990)
and also empirically validated (Sondergaard, 1994).

As no prior study provided adequate information about sociocultural values of some of the
nations included in our study and reported data were often old, we collected and analyzed data
from more than 6,000 students and company employees in the studied 12 countries. There
were at least 500 respondents in each national sample. CFA of these data provided evidence
for structural equivalence for the power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and
masculinity indexes, but not for the long-term orientation index. Consequently, we decided to
exclude that index from our measure of sociocultural context. To avoid the threat of “ecologi-
cal fallacy” (Hofstede, 2001), we aggregated the data for all respondents of each nation to
compute the scores for cultural-value orientations.

Leadership factors. The independent variables of TM leadership factors were measured by
the latest publicly available version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Avolio et al.
(1999) provided evidence for the construct, convergent, and discriminant validity of the model
consisting of the three higher order leadership factors, whereas Antonakis et al. (2003)
obtained similar results validating the model comprising the nine lower order factors. The nine
scales used to measure leadership were (a) idealized influence (behavior) (a = .80), (b) ideal-
ized influence (attributed) (a = .81), (c) inspirational motivation (a = .74), (d) intellectual
stimulation (a = .79), (e) individualized consideration (a = .80), (f) contingent reward leader-
ship (a = .81), (g) active management by exception (a = .74), (h), passive management by
exception (a = .71), and (i) laissez-faire leadership (a = .72).

Each item of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire was rated on a 5-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (frequent, if not always). Strict measures were taken to
ensure the anonymity of the respondents. The TMs, immediately subordinated to the respec-
tive titular heads, rated their leaders on each of the nine leadership factors. Individual ratings
for each of the 270 leaders were then averaged resulting in the same number of sets of compos-
ite leadership ratings. The use of this procedure involving multiple raters greatly reduced the
threat of social desirability in the responses (Hoffman & Hegarty, 1993).

Control variables. Industry was measured as a categorical variable. We evaluated the infor-
mation about the main product(s) of the business units in our study, and we found that each of
them can be placed in one of following industry categories at the three-digit North American
Industry Classification System level: manufacture of machinery, computer and electronic
products, electrical equipment and appliances, transport equipment, furniture and related
products, apparel, food products, and chemicals. Business unit dependence was measured as a

categorical variable, reflecting whether the business unit is an independent firm, a division of a
diversified corporation, or a subsidiary of an organization. Organizational age was measured
as a continuous variable reflecting the number of years, rounded to the second character after
the decimal point, during which the business unit was in active operation. Business unit size
was operationalized as the natural logarithm of the number of employees, a standard measure
in management research (e.g., Guthrie, 2001).

Results

Top Management Leadership and Influence on Innovation

Descriptive statistics and correlations are presented in Table 2. Hypotheses 1a and 1b pro-
posed that leadership explains a significant amount of the variance in top management influ-
ence on product/market and organizational innovations, respectively. We tested them through
hierarchical multiple regression analyses (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). The base model included
the control variables for industry and organization context (entered first into the model), vari-
ables for the sociocultural context (entered after industry and organization context variables
into the model), and leadership factors (entered last). The analysis strongly supported these
two hypotheses (Table 3). Leadership variables explained nearly half of the variance in TM
influence on innovations: D R2 of .47 for product/market and .48 for organizational innova-
tions. Laissez-faire leadership was negatively related with influence on organizational innova-
tion (b = –.10, p < .05). Passive and active management by exception were positively and sig-
nificantly related with product/market (b s .09 and .11, p < .05, respectively), but not with
organizational innovation. All other six leadership factors were, as predicted, positively asso-
ciated with both dependent variables (b s from .17 to .30, p < .01 to p < .001).

Sociocultural Context and Leadership

Hypothesis 2 proposed that the sociocultural context explains a significant amount of the
variance in leadership factors. We regressed the three higher order leadership factors on
Hofstede’s cultural values (Table 4). The results provided support for the hypothesized direct
effect of social culture on leadership: The variables for sociocultural context explained .07 of
the variance for corrective avoidant leadership (p < .01), .14 for developmental/transactional
(p < .001), and .12 for transformational leadership (p < .001). Power distance was positively
and significantly related to all three leadership factors (b s .17, .19, and .12, respectively; at
least p < .01). Uncertainty avoidance was also significantly associated with all leadership fac-
tors: positively with corrective-avoidant and developmental/transactional leadership (b s .16
and .15, p < .01), and negatively with transformational leadership (b = –.11, p < .05). Individu-
alism was positively and significantly related to developmental/transactional and
transformational leadership (b s .21 and .19, p < .001), but not with corrective-avoidant leader-
ship. Finally, masculinity was negatively and significantly associated with developmen-
tal/transactional leadership (b = –.09, p < .05), but not with the other two leadership factors.

The Moderating Role of Sociocultural Context

Hypotheses 3a and 3b proposed that sociocultural context moderates the relationships of
TM leadership with, respectively, their influence on product/market and organizational inno-
vation. We tested them through moderated regression analyses with interaction terms, as sug-
gested by Stone and Hollenbeck (1989). After the control variables, we entered terms for the
direct effect of the predictor (leadership), the direct effect of the moderator (sociocultural con-
text), and an interaction term (a product of the two preceding terms). The interaction terms
explained a modest but significant proportion of the variance in organizational innovation
(D R2 = .04, p < .05) but added only .01 explained variance for product/market innovation (n.s.)
(Table 5). Thus, these results provided support only for Hypothesis 3b. We then explored the
nature of the interactions between leadership and sociocultural context for TM influence on
organizational innovation in more depth. Table 6 reports the betas for those interactions.

These results demonstrated that the sociocultural context exercised a complex pattern of
effects on the relationship of TM leadership with innovation influence. All lower order leader-
ship factors of the FRLT, except laissez-faire leadership, exhibited significant interactions.
Moreover, five of the leadership factors had significant interactions with three of the four cul-
tural-value orientations. Furthermore, idealized influence (attributed and behavior), individu-
alized consideration, and passive management by exception were more strongly related to TM
influence on organizational innovation in higher power distance cultures than in lower power
distance cultures (b s of .29, p < .001; .21, p < .01; .14, p < .05; and .16, p < .05, respectively).
At the same time, the effect was the opposite regarding intellectual stimulation (b = –.17, p <
.05). Furthermore, individualized consideration, contingent reward leadership, and active
management by exception were more strongly related to TM influence on organizational

innovation in higher uncertainty-avoidance cultures than in weaker uncertainty-avoidance
cultures (b s .15, p < .05; .22, p < .01; and .16, p < .05). In contrast, inspirational motivation (b =
–.13, p < .05) and intellectual stimulation (b = –.26, p < .01) were more weakly related to TM
influence on organizational innovation in higher uncertainty-avoidance cultures. Individualis-
tic cultures appear to reinforce the effect of inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation,
and active management by exception (b s .17, p < .05; .21, p < .01; and .12, p < .05) but weaken
the impact of attributed idealized influence (b = –.13, p < .05). Finally, idealized influence
(behavior), individualized consideration, and active management by exception proved to have
stronger effects on innovation influence in more masculine societies (b s .13, .15, and .14, all at
p < .05). However, inspirational motivation and individualized consideration appeared to have
stronger effects in more feminine societies (b s –.20 and –.23, both at p < .01).

Discussion

Summary of Results

The theoretical model this article develops has largely been supported: We have ascer-
tained the presence of positive and significant effects of leadership on TM influence on prod-
uct/market and organizational innovations. That result is consistent with the findings of the
studies on innovation (Henry, 2001; Sastry, 1999) and leader effectiveness (Howell & Avolio,
1993; Howell & Higgins, 1990). In this way, we have contributed to the resolution of one of


398

Journal of Management / June 2005

the biggest controversies in management research—about the importance of organizational
environment versus the importance of micro factors like leadership (Thomas, 2002).

Our results indicate that sociocultural context plays a complex role for the relationship of
leadership with TM innovation influence. First, sociocultural context proved to have a direct
impact on the extent of use of leadership factors. Second, it did moderate the relationship of
leadership with TM influence on organizational innovation. This complex relationship sup-
ports the culture-specific view of leadership (Hofstede, 2001; Thomas & Ravlin, 1995;
Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner, 2002) while challenging the claim that given leadership
factors are universal. Sociocultural value orientations were differentially related with
transformational, developmental/transactional, and corrective-avoidant leadership, suggest-
ing that none of those three higher order leadership factors would be equally endorsed in dif-
ferent social cultures. The contention that transformational leadership is universal rests also
on the assumption that it is overall more effective than other leadership factors (Bass, 1996). In
contrast, we have found that transformational leadership and developmental/transactional
leadership have rather similar effects on TM innovation influence of both types. Besides, that
result has been obtained in a predominantly Western sample (Table 3).

Directions for Future Research

This study reveals the importance of integrating the concepts of leadership, sociocultural
context, and strategic innovation. One of its contributions is in taking the research on leader-
ship and innovation to the international arena. Our findings, and especially the validation of a
two-factor model of TM influence on innovations, strongly suggest that future innovation
research needs to explicitly specify the types of innovation under investigation. It is likely that
many important components of innovation processes and the rate of innovation itself may be
influenced by the sociocultural context. Therefore, future research should explore the com-
plex effects of social culture on the substance and direct output of innovation processes.

Besides, leadership research will be advanced by a continued focus on how leadership
behaviors operate in widely different cultures and identifying optimal leadership profiles spe-
cific to particular cultures (Brodbeck et al., 2000; Koopman et al., 1999). Whereas research on
transformational and transactional leadership has identified an extensive list of key leadership
factors, we suggest that exploring the context of leadership by explicitly incorporating the role
of social culture will be a more appropriate way of searching for effective leadership factors
than trying to identify attributes that may (or may not) be universally endorsed or effective.
Thus, further cross-cultural research is imperative for an improved understanding of leader-
ship as a global concept.

As the success of organizational innovations is dependent on the TMs’ use of appropriate
leadership behaviors and managerial capacity to develop cultural sensitivity, future research
should seek to identify appropriate changes that multinational companies need to make in
their training programs for both expatriate and local managers, strategic planning processes,
and organizational structures. Researchers should advance the understanding of organiza-
tional effectiveness by developing and validating new measures of such changes (e.g., results


Elenkov, Manev / Influence on Innovation

399

of programs for human resource development) as strategically important organizational
outcomes.

Although we have taken strict measures to ensure cross-cultural equivalence and to greatly
diminish social desirability bias, our study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. The
nonrandom sampling design and the relatively smaller sample than the samples in Bass’s
(1985), Hofstede’s (1980), and Trompenaars’s (1993) studies is a limitation to the
generalizability of our results. Also, the participants in our study were predominantly male,
which implies that there may be a gender bias in the data obtained through our surveys.

Implications for Practice

For management practitioners, the implications of this study are that leadership behaviors
may be effective or ineffective depending on the fit with the prevailing cultural values of the
hosting society. Therefore, managers should try to use approaches that correspond most
closely to the prevailing cultural values in their respective host nation. Our results provide
guidance to managers about the general fit of leadership behaviors with sociocultural contexts
as well as the appropriate leadership behaviors for influencing organizational innovation in
different cultures. First (as evidenced in Table 4), the relationship between sociocultural val-
ues and leadership behaviors varies. High power distance is the single cultural dimension that
appears to facilitate all three major leadership factors. This is not surprising given that high
power distance cultures subordinates are “conditioned” (Hofstede, 1980) to expect that
leaders have significant and multifaceted powers.

Taking into consideration the complex moderating effects of sociocultural context estab-
lished in this study, we suggest that specific leadership behaviors facilitate successful innova-
tion processes in particular sociocultural environments. For example, if managers seek to suc-
cessfully and effectively influence organizational innovations in the Russian culture
(characterized by high power distance, estimated score [ES] = 81; medium to low individual-
ism, ES = 54; and relatively high masculinity, ES = 65), leaders would need to rely on cha-
risma, openly demonstrated confidence, and perceived power that epitomize idealized influ-
ence (attributed). Besides, they may need to use active and passive management by exception.
In the Swedish culture (low power distance, ES = 29; low uncertainty avoidance, ES = 36; high
individualism, ES = 70; and low masculinity, ES = 12), managers need to employ inspirational
motivation and intellectual stimulation. In the French culture (described by high power dis-
tance, ES = 71; high uncertainty avoidance, ES = 86; and relatively low masculinity, ES = 49),
individualized consideration is likely to lead most efficiently to successful innovation. Fol-
lowing this train of thoughts, contingent reward leadership would be most useful for effi-
ciently promoting organizational innovation in the German culture (low power distance, ES =
34; high uncertainty avoidance, ES = 67; and high masculinity, ES = 68).

Apparently, more specific knowledge of the effects of sociocultural values can help
researchers and managers in determining which leadership factors are likely to have the great-
est positive effects on innovation-related outcomes, thus improving overall managerial effec-
tiveness and efficiency. We believe that the research on leadership, strategic innovation, and


400

social culture has the potential to reveal many new ways to improve business practice in the
21st century.
