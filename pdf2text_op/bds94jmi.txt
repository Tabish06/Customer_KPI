 Corporate social responsibility as

 an area of scientific inquiry has re-
 ceived little attention in the popular
 and academic press during the last
 decade. Efforts to investigate social
 responsibility and its relationship to
 corporate performance have been
 frustrated by a lack of adequate op-
 erationalizations and measures of so-
 cial responsibility. Regardless of the
 reasons for this inattention to the is-
 sues of corporate responsibility, the
 tide appears to be turning. Recently,
 TIAA-CREF, the largest institutional
 trader in the country, initiated an op-
 tional fund which invests exclusively
 in firms that are deemed socially re-
 sponsible. Such actions suggest that
 corporations will increasingly be
 held accountable for activity of con-
 cern to multiple stakeholder groups.
 As a result there will likely be a re-

 newed interest in identifying the di-
 mensions and consequences of cor-
 porate social responsibilities.

 Cameron has suggested that mul-

 tiple perspectives of organizational
 effectiveness exist and that "consen-
 sus regarding the best, or sufficient,
 set of indicators of effectiveness is
 impossible to obtain" (1986: 541).
 The same arguments can be made
 regarding social performance as a
 specific aspect of overall corporate
 performance. Social responsibility
 continues to be a poorly defined as
 well as difficult to measure concept.
 There appears to be no real agree-
 ment as to what constitutes social
 performance. What is indicated,
 however, is the need to apply meas-
 ures which address multiple criteria
 of social performance. This study at-
 tempts to specify the underlying di-

 mensions of a multiple measure of
 corporate social responsibility and
 investigate the relationship between
 corporate social performance and
 multiple measures of financial per-
 formance. For the purposes of this
 study, corporate social performance
 represents a measure of a firm's at-
 tentiveness to multiple stakeholder
 groups. We employ previously un-
 available objective measures of social
 responsibility which overcome some
 of the methodological problems
 which have stalled prior research ef-
 forts, and propose a working model
 of social responsibility and its rela-
 tionship to financial performance.

 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

 Historically, the responsibility of
 firms was defined purely in eco-
 nomic terms. For example, Friedman
 (1990) considered maximization of
 shareholder wealth as the sole objec-
 tive and responsibility of the well
 managed firm. This perspective gen-
 erally cast corporate activity as a zero-
 sum game. Whatever resources were
 expended in the interests of social
 responsibility came at the expense of
 shareholders (Wartick and Cochran,
 1985). The interests of shareholders
 and other stakeholders were defined
 implicitly as conflicting and mutually
 exclusive.

 1989; Freeman, 1984; Nash, 1990).
 An understanding of such relation-
 ships and an attendant concern for
 the interests of all stakeholder
 groups may force firms to act in a
 socially responsible way regardless of
 their motivation (Sen, 1993).

 Out of these perspectives come
 varied hypotheses regarding the re-
 lationship between social responsi-
 bility and corporate economic per-
 formance. When corporations are
 viewed as economic institutions, a
 negative relationship between social
 responsibility and profitability is as-
 sumed (Ullmann, 1985). The oppos-
 ing hypothesis suggests a positive re-
 lationship between social respon-
 sibility and performance. Proponents
 of this perspective argue that socially
 concerned management is likely to
 also possess the skills necessary to
 achieve superior financial perform-
 ance (Alexander and Buchholz,
 1978; Metzger et al, 1993). A final
 perspective hypothesizes an inverted
 U-shaped correlation between social
 and economic performance. To an
 optimal level, social and economic
 performance are positively related.
 Beyond an optimal level, however,
 social performance and the com-
 mensurate resource allocations neg-
 atively affect economic performance
 (Ullmann, 1985).

 Many criticisms have been leveled
 at this perspective and it seems safe
 to conclude that corporations are no
 longer viewed, even theoretically, as
 solely economic institutions (Sharf-
 man, 1992). At a very minimum,
 there appears to be a consensus that
 firms serve multiple constituencies
 and stakeholder groups whose mem-
 berships are overlapping and whose
 interests are interdependent (Aram,

 EVIDENCE TO-DATE

 The findings reported by the large
 body of work investigating the rela-
 tionship between social and eco-
 nomic performance are inconsistent
 and evidence exists to support each
 of the hypothesized relationships.
 Vance (1975) has applied Moskow-
 itz's (1972) and the Business and So-
 ciety Review's reputational surveys and

 has found a negative relationship be-
 tween social performance and stock
 price changes. The majority of other
 studies have not supported these
 findings. In fact Moskowitz's (1972)
 own study, over a much shorter 6
 months time frame, reveals a positive
 correlation between social perform-
 ance and stock price. Alexander and
 Buchholz (1978) also fail to support
 Vance's findings regarding the Busi-
 ness and Society Review's measures.
 Their finds do not indicate any cor-
 relation between social performance
 and stock returns. Other work em-
 ploying Moskowitz's measures indi-
 cates only a weak positive relation-
 ship between social reputation and
 economic performance when con-
 trolling for the age of the firm's as-
 sets (Cochran and Wood, 1984).
 Sturdivant and Ginter's (1977) re-
 sults show that executives of firms
 classifed as "best" by Moskowitz ex-
 hibit more liberal social attitudes
 and that these attitudes are positively
 associated with both corporate social
 and economic performance.

 Many studies have employed the

 Council on Economic Priorities'
 (1972) pollution control measure as
 a proxy for social performance
 (Bragdon and Marlin, 1972; Bowman
 and Haire, 1975; Folger and Nutt,
 1975; Chen and Metcalf, 1980; Spi-
 cer, 1978a, 1978b). Both Bragdon
 and Marlin (1972) and Spicer
 (1978a) report a positive relation-
 ship between pollution control and
 return on equity (ROE). Other work,
 however, has suggested no correla-
 tion (Folger and Nutt, 1975) or a
 curvilinear correlation (Bowman and
 Haire, 1975) between pollution con-
 trol and ROE and other economic
 performance measures. An explana-
 tion for these conflicting findings is

 provided by Chen and Metcalf
 (1980) who refute earlier results.
 Their work indicates that the positive
 correlation Spicer reports is spurious
 and disappears when firm size is con-
 trolled for.

 More recently, Aupperle, Carroll,

 and Hatfield (1985) used forced
 choice surveys to investigate the re-
 lationship between corporate re-
 sponsibility and economic perform-
 ance. Aupperle et al. (1985) do not
 indicate any relationship between
 CEO attitudes regarding social re-
 sponsibility and corporate profitabil-
 ity. This may be a result of using a
 forced choice self-report survey in-
 strument and subsequent categoriz-
 ing by judges, which inherently sets
 corporate behavior up as a zero-sum
 game. Two research efforts, Mc-
 Guire, Sundgren and Schneeweis
 (1988) and Simerly (1992), used the
 Fortune reputation data to examine
 the corporate responsibility/per-
 formance relationship. McGuire et
 al. (1988) show that prior perform-
 ance is more strongly related to so-
 cial responsibility than subsequent
 performance. This result is not sur-
 prising in light of the "halo effect"
 inherent to the Fortune data. Mc-
 Guire et al. (1988) also found an in-
 verse relationship between social re-
 sponsibility and corporate risk, which
 is consistent with the findings of Spi-
 cer (1978a), as previously noted. Pre-
 sumably this relationship is a func-
 tion of the reduced exposure to
 lawsuits and fines for socially respon-
 sible firms. Another study using the
 Fortune rankings (Simerly, 1992),
 found that firms ranking high on
 corporate social responsibility had
 higher revenues than low ranking
 firms, but also concluded that finan-
 cial performance is impacted by so

 many other variables as to make its
 relationship with social responsibility
 tenuous at best.

 Clearly, the results of previous
 studies present inconsistent evidence
 regarding the relationship between
 corporate social and economic per-
 formance. The explanation for these
 inconsistencies probably lies in the
 fact that the studies have employed
 widely disparate methodologies
 based on mostly subjective self-re-
 ports of responsible actions. The
 methodological approaches and
 their inherent strengths and weak-
 nesses are addressed in the following
 section.

 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

 Social Responsibility Measures

 Previously applied measures of so-
 cial responsibility include reputa-
 tional indexes and forced choice sur-
 vey instruments. This section
 discusses each type of measure.

 Reputational Indexes

 Reputational indexes have been
 the most widely used measures of so-
 cial responsibility. As previously
 noted, the Moskowitz (1972) repu-
 tational measure has been used in
 numerous studies (Moskowitz, 1972;
 Vance, 1975; Sturdivant and Ginter,
 1977; Cochran and Wood, 1984).
 The primary problem associated with
 this measure is its undetermined re-
 liability. Moskowitz provides very lit-
 tle information regarding his assess-
 ment methods. As a result, the
 derivation should be conservatively
 viewed as ad hoc with all the atten-
 dant caveats usually applied to this
 relatively subjective measurement.

 The concerns also apply to the use
 of the Business and Society Review's
 measures also used by Vance (1975)
 and Alexander and Buchholz (1978).
 An equally prevalent reputational
 measure of social responsibility has
 been provided by the Council on Ec-
 onomic Priorities (CEP) (1972). The
 CEP reported the pollution control
 performance of 24 firms in the paper
 and pulp industry. This measure has
 been subsequently used as a proxy
 for social responsibility in numerous
 studies (Bragdon and Martin, 1972;
 Bowman and Haire, 1975; Folger
 and Nutt, 1975; Chen and Metcalf,
 1980; Spicer, 1978a, 1978b). This
 measure is inadequate for several
 reasons. First, it assumes that social
 responsibility is a unidimensional
 concept which can be captured in an
 investigation of the firm's pollution
 control record. This assumption in
 turn requires assuming the common-
 ality of interests of all stakeholder
 groups. The validity of the assump-
 tion is questionable in light of the
 sheer number of affected stake-
 holder groups. Second, the pollution
 control measure has only been pro-
 vided for a single industry. This se-
 verely limits the external validity of
 the findings since it is probably in-
 appropriate to assume that the di-
 mensions of social responsibility are
 similar across industries. The inter-
 ests of stakeholder groups and their
 ability to affect corporate activities
 are also likely to vary with respect to
 the nature of the industry, be it up-
 stream manufacturing, consumer
 products or service oriented.
 McGuire et al. (1988) have more

 recently employed the Fortune repu-
 tational measure which is comprised
 of executive rankings of firm per-
 formance within certain industries.

 Social Responsibility And Corporate Financial Performance 199

 In sum, there are several issues

 bility response bias, it creates other
 problems. A forced choice instru-
 ment creates a zero-sum game, in-
 herently pitting economic and social
 responsibilities against each other.
 Such an approach eliminates the
 possibility that social and economic
 performance may be positively re-
 lated and suggests the possibility that
 their findings of a negative relation-
 ship may be a statistical artifact of the
 methodology.

 The largest 10 firms within each in-
 dustry are rated on eight dimensions:
 financial soundness, long-term in-
 vestment value, use of corporate as-
 sets, quality of management, inno-
 vativeness, quality of products and
 services, ability to hire and maintain
 qualified personnel, and community
 and environmental responsibility. It
 is not clear whether McGuire et al.
 (1988) used only the social respon-
 sibility measure or an aggregate
 measure of all eight dimensions.

 halo since available public informa-
 tion is generally limited to financial
 results. This may explain McGuire et
 al.'s (1988) findings that past per-
 formance is more strongly related to
 social responsibility than future per-
 formance. At a minimum, the evi-
 dence casts suspicion on the use of
 the Fortune reputational survey as a
 valid measure of social responsibility.

 Performance Measures

 Issues regarding the choice of per-
 formance measures are slightly more
 straightforward. Choices are limited
 to relatively common financial ac-
 counting or market based measures.
 There are advantages and disadvan-
 tages associated with each. Account-
 ing based measures are more easily
 manipulated and are historical
 rather than reflective of perform-
 ance expectations. In addition they
 do not allow for the easy incorpo-
 ration of risk considerations and ec-
 onomic and market factors. On the
 other hand, accounting based meas-

 outside the investment community.
 These measures are, however, reflec-
 tive of expectation and incorporate
 risk and market and economic fac-
 tors.

 Hypothesis 2: The dimensions of social re-
 sponsibility are related to alternative meas-
 ures of financial performance in different
 ways.

 The use of accounting and market
 based measures of financial perform-
 ance are not mutually exclusive. In
 light of the fact that inconsistent per-
 formance valuations may have con-
 tributed to the consistent results pre-
 viously reported, this study includes
 both accounting and market based
 measures of performance. More re-
 cent studies have taken this ap-
 proach (McGuire et al. 1985).

 HYPOTHESES

 In total, the previous work points
 to two hypotheses. Specifically, pre-
 vious work points to die existence of
 multiple stakeholder groups who var-
 iously define and measure social and
 overall corporate performance. As
 such, social performance cannot be
 captured using unidimensional
 measures. This study seeks to deter-
 mine the underlying objective di-
 mensions of social responsibility and
 relate them to the concerns of vari-
 ous stakeholder groups.
 Hypothesis 1: Social performance is a multi-
 dimensional construct. Factor analysis will
 produce more than one unique factor.
 Stakeholder groups are likely to ap-
 ply performance criteria most rele-
 vant to their concerns. Conse-
 quently, questions regarding the
 social responsibility/performance re-
 lationship are likely to depend both
 on what social responsibility criteria
 are measured and what performance

 METHODOLOGY

 This study employed the ratings of
 social responsibility reported by the
 Council on Economic Priorities
 (1989). This is the same organization
 which supplied the pollution control
 measure applied in numerous other
 studies. Rankings were available for
 75 consumer product firms in 1988
 and 104 firms in 1989. Firms were
 rated on 10 dimensions of social re-
 sponsibility: contributions to charity,
 advancement of women, advance-
 ment of people of color, defense
 contracts, animal testing, disclosure,
 community outreach, nuclear power,
 involvement in South Africa and en-
 vironmental record. Firms included
 in the 1989 sample were also scored
 on a family benefits measure. This
 measure was excluded from the anal-
 ysis for consistency. Only the 75 firms
 for which there were scores for both
 1988 and 1989 were included in the
 factor analysis. Only including these
 firms allows for an examination of
 the stability of the factors from year
 to year. (See Appendix A for specific
 scoring criteria.) These measures
 represented an improvement over
 previously applied measures and
 more satisfactorily addressed the ma-
 jor measurement issues identified in
 the previous section. That is, they
 represented multiple aspects of so-
 cial performance and were not self-

 reported, but scored by a more ob-
 jective outside source.

 In order to avoid the problems as-
 sociated with performance measures
 addressed in the previous section,
 both accounting and market based
 measures of performance were used.
 This approach inherently acknowl-
 edged the existence of multiple
 stakeholder groups and further al-
 lowed for the possibility that relevant
 performance measures may vary with
 respect to stakeholder groups. Per-
 formance measures included Return
 on Assets (ROA), Excess Market Re-
 turn (EMR) (return on firm minus
 return on market), and Earnings per
 Share (EPS). These performance
 measures were retrieved from the
 Compustat data tapes. The lack of
 performance, employee and share-
 holder data eliminated some firms
 from some procedures.

 The data analysis consisted of a
 two-stage process. First, a factor anal-
 ysis procedure was conducted in an
 attempt to specify the existing un-
 derlying dimensions of social respon-
 sibility. A varimax rotation proce-
 dure was used. Factor analysis
 procedures for 1988 and 1989 were
 conducted independently since the
 firms given for 1989 were inclusive of
 the firms given in 1988 and, conse-
 quently, did not represent independ-
 ent observations. In addition, sepa-
 rate analysis provided some clues
 with regard to the stability of the un-
 derlying dimensions. Only the 75
 firms included in both the 1988 and
 1989 samples were included in the
 factor analysis. Factors with eigenval-
 ues greater than one were retained.
 The second stage of the analysis ex-
 amined the relationship between
 each of the dimensions and corpo-
 rate performance. To accomplish

 this factors scores were computed for
 each firm and input as independent
 variables in regression procedures.
 Separate models for each of the
 three independent variables (ROA,
 EMR, EPS) were specified. This anal-
 ysis was conducted for 1989. Sixteen
 of the 104 firms for which 1989 social
 performance data was available were
 excluded due to lack of financial per-
 formance data. A total of 88 firms
 were included in the 1989 regression
 procedures.

 RESULTS

 Table 1 provides correlations be-

 tween the number of shareholders
 and employees and the social re-
 sponsibility measures. These data
 provide some indication of the influ-
 ence these stakeholder groups may
 have on the activities of the firm. In
 1988, Women, Race, and Disclosure
 are positively correlated with the
 number of shareholders, and non-
 involvement in South Africa and the
 military are negatively correlated
 with the number of shareholders.
 These relationships are consistent
 with the relationship between social
 responsibility measures and the num-
 ber of employees in 1988. In 1989,
 the relationships between social re-
 sponsibility and number of share-
 holders and employees is almost as
 consistent. Positive correlations exist
 between Women and Race and the
 number of employees and the num-
 ber of shareholders. Charity, nonin-
 volvement in Military and South Af-
 rica, Animal rights and Environment
 are negatively related to the number
 of shareholders, and Charity, non-
 involvement in Military, South Africa
 and Environment are also negatively

 correlated witn the number ot em-
 ployees.

 The results of the factor analysis
 are given in Tables 2 and 3. It is im-
 portant to remember at this point
 that high scores always represent the
 * 'socially responsible" position. The
 higher the score on Charity, Women,
 Race, Animal, Disclosure, Commu-
 nity, Environment and Benefits the
 more the firm is involved in these ac-
 tivities. The higher the score on Mil-
 itary, Nuclear and South Africa, the
 less the firm is involved in these ac-
 tivities. In 1988 (Table 2) four factors
 explain a total of 65.17% of the var-
 iance and in 1989 (Table 3) 3 factors
 explain a total of 53.46% of the var-
 iance. The factor pattern is not en-
 tirely consistent from 1988 to 1989,
 but shows stability on a number of
 dimensions. In both years, promo-
 tion of women, promotion of people
 of color (race), disclosure and com-
 munity outreach load heavily on Fac-
 tor 1. Factor 1 explains 22% of the

 variance in ivjöö ana zz7o in iyoy.
 Noninvolvement in military activities
 and concern for the environment
 load on Factor 2 in 1989, and to-
 gether on Factor 3 in 1988. Animal
 rights and noninvolvement in South
 Africa load on a single factor in both
 1988 and 1989. Charitable contri-
 bution also loads positively on this
 factor in 1989. The major difference
 between the two years' factor struc-
 tures is that noninvolvement in nu-
 clear activities and charitable contri-
 butions load together on a separate
 dimension in 1988, but are absorbed
 in Factors 2 and 3 respectively, in
 1989.

 The results of this analysis provide
 clear support for Hypothesis 1. The
 factor analysis indicates the multidi-
 mensionality of social responsibility
 as well as some stability of the un-
 derlying dimensions from year to
 year. Stability is greatest for Factor 1.
 Although Factor 2 in 1988 is ab-
 sorbed into Factors 2 and 3 in 1989,

 Social responsibility is a multidimen-
 sional concept. This conclusion and
 the data are consistent with the
 stakeholder perspective of corporate
 responsibility since the dimensions
 of social responsibility identified in
 the data relate to distinct stakeholder
 groups. Comparing the factor struc-
 ture of 1988 with 1989 also suggests
 that the dimensions of social respon-
 sibility may be fairly stable and be-
 coming more consolidated over
 time. In addition, the regression re-
 sults point to the conclusion that the
 social performance factors do not
 have the same impact on corporate
 economic performance. The discus-
 sion here centers on the analysis of
 the 1989 data.

 are related to business practices or
 internal issues regarding the pro-
 motion of women and people of
 color, disclosure, benefits and com-
 munity outreach. This dimension of
 social responsibility appears to have
 to do with those things which are to
 some extent legally mandated or are
 tangibly related to employee well-be-
 ing. In other words, these activities
 are those which may be seen as hav-
 ing the most direct impact on the
 firm and its productivity. These are
 probably less likely to be overlooked,
 but attention to these issues does not
 imply attention to other corporate
 social responsibilities.

 DISCUSSION

 The three factors identified gen-

 erally reflect Internal Business Prac-
 tices, Line of Business and External
 Concerns, respectively. The primary
 concerns identified in the first factor

 The items loading on the second
 factor represent concerns of external
 stakeholder groups. These items
 have to do with activities which relate
 to the nature of the businesses that
 the firm chooses to operate. Specif-
 ically, noninvolvement in military
 and nuclear activities and environ-
 mental concern load heavily on this
 factor. Military and Nuclear involve-

 ment are directly related to line of
 business choices. While concern for
 the environment does not specifi-
 cally relate to line of business, as
 measured here, it is in large part a
 function of the nature of the chosen
 business and industry.

 Items that comprise the final fac-

 tor (External Concerns) have to do
 with the concerns of external stake-
 holders which do not specifically re-
 late to the firm's line of business.
 These activities have to do with char-
 itable contributions, animal rights
 and involvement in South Africa.

 In sum then, there appears to be

 an internal or more direct-link di-
 mension, an external dimension
 which relates to industry choices,
 and an external dimension which is
 not necessarily related to the choice
 of industry. Firms cannot be classi-
 fied as either socially responsible or
 socially irresponsible since activity
 with respect to one stakeholder
 group does not appear to be related
 to activity involving other stake-
 holder groups. The correlations pro-
 vided indicate that activity on some
 measures of social responsibility is re-
 lated to the number of shareholders
 and employees a firm has. These
 findings may reflect the ability of
 particular stakeholder groups to in-
 fluence the activities of the firm.
 They may also reflect greater levels
 of disposable income among larger
 firms. Of course, it is impossible to
 draw anything other than tentative
 conclusions regarding these correla-
 tions. There are a number of expla-
 nations so causal interpretations of
 these data are not possible. Although
 identifying the determinants of so-
 cial responsibility is beyond the
 scope of this paper, the correlations

 provide evidence of fruitful ground
 for future research.

 The regression results suggest
 some interesting conclusions regard-
 ing the social responsibility/per-
 formance relationship. Hypothesis 2
 states the the dimensions of social re-
 sponsibility are related to alternative
 measures of financial performance
 in different ways. The data provide
 strong support for this conclusion.
 None of the dimensions of social re-
 sponsibility are related to excess mar-
 ket returns (EMR) or earnings per
 share (EPS). Market returns are ac-
 tually reflections of anticipated per-
 formance. This measure is of pri-
 mary interest to the investment
 community. Consequently, the re-
 sults indicate that high levels of per-
 formance on the social responsibility
 dimensions do not affect the invest-
 ment community's view of the antic-
 ipated earnings of the firm. The
 same is true for earnings per share,
 the measure of greatest interest to
 the firm's shareholders. This meas-
 ure is easily manipulatable since it is
 a function of the firm's earnings as
 well as the number of shares out-
 standing. Consequently, this meas-
 ure may not accurately reflect the fi-
 nancial performance of the firm.
 High performance on the social re-
 sponsibility dimensions is not related
 to earnings per share.

 On the contrary, social responsi-
 bility is related to return on assets
 (ROA) . The Line of Business factor
 and the External factor are positively
 and negatively associated with social
 responsibility, respectively. Firms
 that exhibit environmental concern
 and choose industries that are not
 deemed socially irresponsible
 achieve higher asset utilization levels.
 Firms that score high on External

 ing promotion of women and mi-
 norities, community outreach and
 disclosure. The mere presence of
 these activities does not appear to
 enhance corporate performance. It
 may be that these activities are so im-
 portant or are legally mandated to
 the extent that they are necessary but
 insufficient conditions for corporate
 performance. The absence of these
 activities, however, may have severe
 adverse consequences for corporate
 performance.

 The dimensions of social respon-
 sibility are also related to different
 performance measures in different
 ways. Performance on Factors 2
 (Line of Business) and 3 (External
 Concerns) do not impact external
 perceptions of firm performance,
 but apparently does affect actual per-
 formance in terms of ROA. This of
 course presents a dilemma to man-
 agement who are charged with man-
 aging the utilization of the firm's as-
 sets as well as the perceptions of the
 firm's performance. This apparent
 conflict may be eventually resolved
 once the market recognizes the re-
 lationship between social responsi-
 bility and ROA.

 206 Blackburn, Doran and Shrader

 concerns realize lower asset utiliza-
 tion rates. This latter finding is sur-
 prising unless involvement in South
 Africa and low performance on ani-
 mal rights measures are typical of
 high asset utilization industries.

 Interestingly, Internal Business
 Practices are not related to any of the
 measures of financial performance.
 This may indicate that high perform-
 ance on this dimension is a necessary
 but insufficient condition for finan-
 cial performance. Since variables
 loading on this dimension have to do
 with largely legally mandated activi-
 ties, high performance on this di-
 mension may be taken more or less
 for granted. If this is the case, inat-
 tention or excess attention to this di-
 mension may undermine perform-
 ance.

 CONCLUSION

 The findings presented here pro-

 vide strong evidence of the multidi-
 mensionality of social responsibility.
 In addition, the dimensions relate
 more or less to distinct stakeholder
 groups. The implication is that any
 attempt to employ unidimensional
 measures or proxies for social re-
 sponsibility is questionable. In addi-
 tion, the inconsistency of previous
 studies may be attributable to the use
 of such measures. Firms cannot be
 strictly classified as socially responsi-
 ble or irresponsible based on a single
 measure. In general, the measure of
 a firm's social responsibility is very
 much a function of the stakeholder
 group who is evaluating the perform-
 ance.

 The results of this study suggest

 several important conclusions for
 managers attempting to balance the
 conflicting demands of stakeholder
 groups. First, there appear to be mul-
 tiple dimensions to corporate social
 responsibility, further bearing out
 the conclusion that multiple stake-
 holder groups do exist and must be
 managed effectively for the well-be-
 ing of the firm. The assessment of
 the social performance of a firm is
 likely to vaiy depending on the party
 assessing the performance. Given the
 multidimensionality of social per-
 formance, it may be impossible to ad-

 It appears that some aspects of so-

 cially responsible behavior are ex-
 pected. These activities are typified
 by those loading on Factor 1, includ-

 equately address the interests of all
 relevant stakeholders groups. Ulti-
 mately, management may be re-
 quired to weigh the interests of the
 stakeholder groups against each
 other and against the economic wel-
 fare of the firm.

 Second, performance relative to
 the dimensions of social perform-
 ance imply different outcomes for
 economic performance. While social
 performance does not appear to pos-
 itively affect the market's anticipa-
 tion of future performance, it does
 appear to tangibly affect economic
 performance. This is a very impor-
 tant finding and points to a miscon-
 ception the market may have regard-
 ing the benefits of social responsible
 behavior. If this misconception of a
 zero-sum game continues to be main-
 tained, management may be encour-
 aged to view social and economic
 performance as mutually exclusive.
 However, the results presented here
 clearly point to the conclusion that
 they are not mutually exclusive, but
 are in fact, positively related. This is
 consistent with Graves and Waddock
 (1992).

 As interesting as these initial find-
 ings are, there are certain limitations
 to the current study. Overcoming
 these limitations presents promising
 opportunities for future investiga-

 tion. Although the social perform-
 ance measure used here represents
 an improvement over many of the
 previously employed measures, it is
 not without limitations. Applying
 equal weight to the performance
 measures included eliminates infor-
 mation that would be valuable to a
 complete determination of the rela-
 tionship between social and eco-
 nomic performance. In addition, the
 measures employed here should not
 be considered a definitive list of all
 aspects of corporate social perform-
 ance. There are likely to be other sa-
 lient concerns of the various stake-
 holder groups.

 Overcoming these limitations pro-
 vides fruitful ground for future re-
 search. Future work can focus on
 identifying the determinants of so-
 cial performance. Although the data
 presented here show some interest-
 ing correlations between number of
 employees and shareholders and so-
 cial performance, it is impossible to
 determine causality based on these
 results. Additional work is necessary
 to specify the nature of these rela-
 tionships. At a minimum, the results
 presented here point to the impor-
 tance of continuing to investigate the
 relationships between all aspects of
 corporate social and economic per-
 formance.
