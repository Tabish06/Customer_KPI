ABSTRACT. This research explores how consumers
respond to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in
China with a multiproduct, comparative survey. Empir-
ical results conclude that (1) Chinese consumers, who
show a high level of awareness and trust of CSR, are
more likely to transform a good CSR record into positive
corporate evaluation, product association, and purchase
intention; (2) Consumer responses to CSR vary across
different product categories. Those firms selling experi-
ence products (vs. search and credence products) are more
likely to gain consumers’ positive product associations and
purchase support through CSR practices; and (3) The
relationships between consumer demographics and their
CSR responses are not linear, and those consumers with a
middle level of age and income would respond to CSR
more positively. Managerial implications are provided.

KEY WORDS: CSR, consumer responses, product cat-
egory, demographics, China

Introduction

A large number of researches suggest that corporations
of the twenty-ﬁrst century can derive enormous
beneﬁts when they are perceived as being socially
responsible by their stakeholders (Crowther, 2003;

Idowu and Towler, 2004). Among all the stakehold-
ers, one important group that appears to be particu-
larly susceptible to a company’s Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR)
its consumers
(Bhattacharya and Sen, 2004). A growing body of
academic research attests
that CSR has positive
inﬂuence – across a range of product categories – on
consumers’ evaluations and purchase intentions of
company/product (Ellen et al., 2006; Lichtenstein
et al., 2004; Mohr and Webb, 2005; Sen and
Bhattacharya, 2001). The positive link between CSR
and consumer patronage makes managers realize that
CSR is not only an ethical/ideological imperative, but
also an economic one in today’s marketplace (Smith,
2000). More companies are willing to increase their
CSR investment and integrate it into the long-term
strategic plan to maintain or even enhance long-term
market performance (Mahoney and Thorne, 2005).

China has become the world’s largest market. Chi-
nese consumers have already attracted great attention
from not only local enterprises but also multinational
corporations. Therefore, when corporations use CSR
strategy in China, several important questions need to
be addressed: (1) What is the overall situation of con-
sumers’ CSR responses in China? (2) Whether con-
sumer responses to CSR vary across different product
category or not? (3) What is the relationship between
consumer demographics and their CSR responses?
That is, which consumer group with certain demo-
graphic characteristics is more likely to respond to CSR
positively? Answering these questions can help man-
agers understand consumers’ responses to CSR initia-
tives and provide them strategic guidance to implement
CSR programs in China. However, the existing studies
are mainly conducted in the West.

This article attempts to study the above questions
in Chinese market. The rest of this article is structured

implications and
suggesting new directions for future studies.

Literature review and hypothesis
construction

Conceptual deﬁnitions of CSR

A major question for business historically has been
whether corporate decision makers should be con-
cerned with issues other than proﬁtability (Mohr et al.,
2001). For this reason, there is a growing body of
research attempting to deﬁne what it means for a
company to be socially responsible, and many deﬁ-
nitions of CSR are adopted. Perhaps the most oft-
cited deﬁnition of CSR is Carroll’s model (1979)
which designed a four-part conceptualization includ-
ing economic,
legal, ethical, and philanthropic
responsibilities. Ethical responsibilities embody those
standards, norms, or expectations that reﬂect a con-
cern for stakeholders like the environmental, civil
rights, and many other forms; philanthropic respon-
sibilities encompass those corporate actions that are in
response to society’s expectation including business
contributions to the arts, education, or the commu-
nity (Carroll, 1991). Economic and legal responsibil-
ities are the basic level of CSR which must be carried
out by corporations with no doubt. Therefore, the
existing studies mainly discuss CSR practices in higher
levels
(ethical and philanthropic responsibilities)
which are also the primary concerns in this article.

Consumer responses to CSR

Information Processing Theory (IPT) points out that
human information processing includes at least the
following stages that are personal focus of attention,
encoding, and judging in short-term memory;
recoding and reasoning through retrieving long-
term memory; and ﬁnally making a behavioral
response (Miller, 1956). Based on this theory, it is
believed that consumers’ processing of CSR infor-

mation also contains at least four steps: paying atten-
tion to CSR information; judging the sincerity of
CSR actions; reasoning or associating CSR infor-
mation with companies and their products; and ﬁnally
making a behavioral reaction on purchasing. The
above steps correspond to ﬁve important variables in
CSR–consumer
relationship studies: consumers’
awareness of CSR; their trust or attribution of CSR;
their company evaluation (CE); product association
(PA); and purchase intention (PI) inﬂuenced by CSR.
In the current literature, CE, PA, and PI are the most
popular dependent variables, and they are generally
inﬂuenced by consumers’ perceived level rather than
the objective level of ﬁrm’s CSR actions (Becker-
Olsen et al., 2006; Marin et al., 2009). Figure 1 shows
the conceptual model of
research. Speciﬁc
hypotheses are developed in the following sections.

Consumers’ awareness of CSR
Consumers’ awareness of CSR mainly discusses
whether consumers are aware of CSR activities in real
consumptions (Pomering and Dolniar, 2009). In our
conceptual model, consumers’ awareness of CSR is an
exogenous construct susceptible to the political tra-
ditions, cultural, and economic development in a
certain society, and it probably varies from country to
country (Singh et al., 2008). In China, CSR concept
is still
in the early stage (Gao, 2009), and many

Consumer Responses to CSR

199

consumers are not aware of CSR especially in the
ethical and philanthropic level (Bala and Yeung,
2009). The lack of awareness may become an inhibitor
of consumer sensitivity to CSR and explain why CSR
might not be taken into account while appraising a
company and its products (Maignan, 2001; Smith,
2000). On the contrary, the more the consumers are
aware of CSR, the better they understand about CSR
activities (Lee and Shin, 2010); thus, those consumers
with a higher level of awareness or concern of CSR
are more likely to show positive attitudes to the
sponsoring ﬁrm and its products, and a higher level of
PI (Lee and Shin, 2010). Therefore, it may be said that

H1: A higher level of consumers’ awareness of
CSR leads to consumers’ more positive re-
sponses to CSR which are H1-a) Corporate
evaluation; H1-b) Product association; and
H1-c) Purchase intention.

Consumers’ trust of CSR
trust of CSR is generally deﬁned
Consumers’
as consumers’ expectation that the company, as a
sponsor of CSR program, is willing to keep promise
and to fulﬁll obligations with honesty, goodwill,
and non-opportunistic motives (Blomqvist, 1997).
Drumwright (1996) found that even though manag-
ers described ﬁrm’s motives as mixed – serving both
economic as well as social objectives – these same
managers believed that consumers are simplistic in
their judgments about CSR initiatives and view them
as either serving economic ends or reﬂecting sincere
social concerns. A consumer’s trust or attribution of
ﬁrm’s CSR practices is one of the most immediate
consequences of a company’s social performance
(Pivato et al., 2008), and signiﬁcantly affects his/her
subsequent attitudes and actions responding to CSR
(Aqueveque, 2005; Osterhus, 1997; Rifon et al.,
2004). Therefore, it may be said that

H2: Consumers’ trust of CSR mediates the rela-
tionships between consumers’ perceived CSR
and their responses to CSR which are H2-a)
Corporate evaluation; H2-b) Product associa-
tion; and H2-c) Purchase intention.

Moreover, based on the existing empirical results,
it is believed that the consumers’ perceived CSR
levels also have a direct effect on their CSR

responses including CE (Brown and Dacin, 1997;
Ricks, 2005), PA (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), and
PI (Becker-Olsen et al., 2006; Berens et al., 2005;
Carrigan and Attalla, 2001), which means trust of
CSR is a partial mediator in our conceptual model.
Therefore, the following hypothesis is also included:

H3: A higher level of consumers’ perceived CSR
leads to higher level of consumer responses to
CSR which are H3-a) Corporate evaluation;
H3-b) Product association; and H3-c) Pur-
chase intention.

Product category

Earlier studies have suggested that there is an ob-
servable relationship between the characteristics of a
product and the approximate marketing mix for that
product (Miracle, 1965). In other words, if a link
between a product’s characteristics and the con-
sumer’s decision mechanism is established, then a
product classiﬁcation based on these characteristics is
to become useful in developing a framework for
marketing strategy, thereby simplifying the scope of
the manager’s marketing alternatives (Assael, 1974).
Recently, Siegel and Vitaliano (2007) found that there
is a linkage between product category of a ﬁrm and the
ﬁrm’s enthusiasm about CSR. Their ﬁndings indicate
that the ﬁrms selling experience products are more
likely to engage in CSR. Based on Nelson’s (1970)
deﬁnition, products can be classiﬁed into three cate-
gories, namely, search, experience, and credence
ones. Search products’ qualities can be determined by
inspection prior to purchase, while the qualities of
experience products cannot be. The value of credence
products cannot be evaluated even after use (Darby
and Karni, 1973). The reason for ﬁrms selling expe-
rience products performing CSR more actively is
interpreted by the difference of consumer responses to
CSR among different product categories – that is,
experience goods are more likely to be associated with
CSR by consumers. Speciﬁcally, experience goods
must be used or consumed before their true value to
the consumers can be determined (Nelson, 1970);
thus consumers’ notion for CSR when they buy
experience goods is based on the idea that liable and
honest ﬁrms will produce better products, and CSR

can be viewed as a signal of such honesty and reliability
(McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Siegel and Vitaliano,
2007). The above interpretation needs to be empiri-
cally tested (Siegel and Vitaliano, 2007). However, to
the best of our knowledge, most existing studies in the
CSR–consumer relationship domain are conducted
in a context of single industry or without identiﬁed
industry, and little research has been focused on
whether consumer responses to CSR are actually
different among product categories. Therefore, based
on the above statement, the authors propose the fol-
lowing hypothesis:

H4: Product category moderates the relationship
between consumers’ perceived CSR and their
responses to CSR. Speciﬁcally, when consum-
ers receive CSR information of ﬁrm selling
experience goods (vs. search or credence goods),
a higher level of perceived CSR leads to con-
sumers’ more positive responses to CSR which
are H4-a) Corporate evaluations; H4-b) Prod-
uct associations; and H4-c) Product intentions.

In addition,

if consumers’ trust of CSR has a
mediating effect on the relationship between per-
ceived CSR and consumers’ CSR responses
including CE, PA, and PI, then the paths from
consumers’ trust of CSR to CE, PA, or PI will also
be moderated by product category based on the
above statement. Therefore, the following hypoth-
esis is included in the model:

H5: Product category moderates the relationship
between consumers’ trust of CSR and their re-
sponses to CSR. Speciﬁcally, when consumers
receive CSR information of a ﬁrm selling
experience goods (vs. search or credence goods),
a higher level of trust of CSR leads to con-
sumers’ more positive responses to CSR which
are H5-a) Corporate evaluations; H5-b) Prod-
uct associations; and H5-c) Product intentions.

Consumer demographics

Besides product category or characteristics, another
important issue should be considered by managers –
when they decide to adopt CSR strategy to please
consumers – is that which consumer groups will be

more sensitive to CSR. Some scholars have explored
the demographic characteristics of consumers who
respond to CSR more positively or negatively, and
results show that women, higher-education, and
higher-income groups are more supportive of ﬁrm’s
CSR practices (Youn and Kim, 2008), and older
consumers are more likely to favor ethical
issues
through purchasing (Carrigan et al., 2004). However,
the authors believe that the relationship between
consumers’ CSR responses and their demographics
may vary from nation to nation, and in the context
of China, the largest emerging market in the world,
the consumer demographic characteristics of CSR
responses have not been identiﬁed. This study tries to
answer that question and, thus, proposes the follow-
ing hypothesis:

H6: There is a positive relationship between con-
sumers’ corporate evaluation and their demo-
graphics which are H6-a) Age; H6-b) Gender
(dummy variable); H6-c) Income; and H6-d)
Education.

H7: There is a positive relationship between con-
sumers’ product association and their demo-
graphics which are H7-a) Age; H7-b) Gender
(dummy variable); H7-c) Income; and H7-d)
Education.

H8: There is a positive relationship between con-
sumers’ purchase intention and their demo-
graphics which are H8-a) Age; H8-b) Gender
(dummy variable); H8-c) Income; and H8-d)
Education.

Method

Product selection and category

In order to examine the moderating inﬂuence of
product category (search, experience, and credence
product), this study conducts a consumer question-
naire survey in six industries which include house-
hold appliance, traveling, food, apparel, insurance,
and digital trades, and these industries cover a wide
variety of products including refrigerators and air-
conditionings, travel services, yoghurt, sports clothes
and shoes, insurance services, and digital cameras.
Based on the criteria of whether a product’s true

value can be determined prior purchase or not
(Nelson, 1970), or cannot be determined even after
purchase (Darby and Karni, 1973),
the above
products are classiﬁed into three categories:
(1)
search products, such as sports clothes, shoes, and
digital cameras; (2) experience products, such as
refrigerators, air-conditionings, travel services, and
yoghurt; and (3) credence products such as insurance
services.

Sample and data collection

Samples were drawn from shopping mall visitors,
and an average of 69% of the approached visitors
participated. A total number of 1022 questionnaires
were found to be usable. The demographics of the
sample are summarized in Table I. The sub-sample
sizes of the six industries are 163 (appliance), 168
(travel), 173 (food), 166 (apparel), 179 (insurance),
and 173 (digital trades). The authors also sought an
even coverage of the survey time of a day and that of
a week to reduce possible shopping pattern biases.

The data were collected in Sept. 2009. Mall-
intercept
survey was conducted in the cities of
Wuhan and Shanghai. Wuhan is the largest mega
city and a predominant trafﬁc hub in the central
interior area of China. It has a long history (dating
back to 3,500 years ago in the period of Pre-Qin)

for

the ﬁrst

and rich culture of Central Plains. The economic
development and purchasing power of Wuhan is in
the middle level of the country.1 Shanghai is the
largest metropolis in the east coastal area of China.
After 1843, when Shanghai was opened as a com-
mercial port and western civilization came to China
through this port
time, Shanghai
developed rapidly into the national commercial and
economic center, and gradually formed a kind of
combination of the Chinese and Western cultures.
In brief, the difference of economic and culture
between Wuhan and Shanghai represents the dif-
ference between underdeveloped interior areas and
developed coastal areas in China, which is the main
reason that prompted the authors to choose these
two cities to collect data.

The authors used face-to-face investigation pro-
cedure to collect data. Participants were ﬁrst asked to
read a brief material about the basic information of a
ﬁctitious ﬁrm (including industry type and main
products) and its positive CSR record. If the par-
ticipants were unwilling or difﬁcult (like elderly
people) to read the material, then our investigator
would read for them and explain any problem when
respondents ﬁlled the questionnaires. After
the
questionnaire was ﬁlled, each item would be
checked to avoid unclear or blank answers. On
average, each questionnaire lasted for approximately
15 min. On completion,
the participants were

Notes: (1) Elder people were less willing to participate in the survey. (2) In China, the sum of a person’s monthly incomes
in a year usually consists of 1/3–2/3 of his/her total yearly income. The monthly income is ﬁxed but the year-end
performance income is ﬂuctuating and not guaranteed. Thus, people tend to tell their monthly income when asked
about it.

Measures

Measure development
Measures for most of the constructs used in this
study were available in the literature, and were
adapted to suit the language environment of China.
To develop applicable scales, focus groups were used
to examine how consumers describe awareness,
trust, CE, PA, and PI. Then, participants were asked
to give examples how they respond to CSR infor-
mation around them, such as the environmental
activities and donations. These results were helpful
in generating or revising items. Second, in an effort
to enhance face validity, ﬁve experts qualitatively
tested initial items and provided their suggestions, on
which basis, those improperly included items were
reformulated or deleted. Third, equivalence for all
items was sought by conducting back-translation.
Finally, 62 graduate students
(including masters,
doctorates, and MBAs) in a management school
participated in a pretest of the questionnaire and
then stated the problems they encountered while
answering questions. A number of small revisions of
the questionnaire were made on the basis of the
pretest.

Final measures
The independent variable for this study is the con-
sumers’ perceived CSR level. Since our study fo-
cused on the positive effect of CSR on consumers,
the authors ﬁrst showed a ﬁctitious ﬁrm’s positive
CSR record in the beginning of the questionnaire
and asked consumers to grade the ﬁrm’s CSR per-
formance. Appendix I shows the CSR descriptions
for the household appliance industry as an example.
For all the dependent measures, the authors used a
seven-point Likert scales (1 – strongly disagree; 7 –
strongly agree). Appendix II contains all scales with
factor loadings, organized by construct.

Measurement model
The authors conducted a conﬁrmatory factor (CFA)
via Amos 7.0 to assess measurement
reliability,
convergent validity and discriminate validity. The
measurement model has a good ﬁt. v2(215) = 395.38,

p < 0.01, GFI = 0.96, AGFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.95,
RMSEA = 0.05, RMR = 0.07; TLI(NNFI) = 0.93.
All the standardized factor loadings are close to or
higher than 0.60 and signiﬁcant at a = 0.01 (see
Appendix II). Reliability is conﬁrmed with com-
posite reliability index higher
than the recom-
mended level of 0.60 (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988), and
the average variance extracted is higher than the
recommended level of 0.50 (Hair et al., 1998).
Discriminate validity was tested by comparing the
average variance extracted by each construct to the
shared variance between the construct and all other
variables. For each comparison, the explained vari-
ance exceeds all combinations of shared variance
(see Table II).

Results

Structural model for direct and indirect effects

To test
the hypotheses of H1–H3, a structural
equation model was developed via Amos 7.0 (see
Figure 2), and the consumers’ most- and least-
concerned aspects of CSR were also explored
(see Figure 3).

As shown in Figure 2, consumers’ awareness of
CSR has a signiﬁcant and positive impact on their PI
(c = 0.76; p < 0.01), but its positive impact is not
signiﬁcant for CE and PA. Second, a positive path
coefﬁcient is found between perceived CSR and
trust of CSR (c = 0.79, p < 0.01) and between trust
of CSR and CE (c = 0.21, p < 0.05). However, the
paths from trust of CSR to PA (c = 0.12, p > 0.05)
and PI (c = 0.15, p > 0.05) are both found to be
insigniﬁcant. Third, consumers’ perceived CSR
has direct positive inﬂuence on CE (c = 0.69,
p < 0.01), PA (c = 0.38, p < 0.01), and PI (c =
0.58, p < 0.01). Based on the above results, H1-c,
H2-a, H3-a, H3-b, and H3-c are supported, but
H1-a, H1-b, H2-b, and H2-c are not.

Figure 3 shows the consumers’ aspects of CSR
information which are concerned the most or least.
Consumers are asked to choose from six alternatives
which are motive,
results,
expectancy, and commitment, and 33% and 25% of
the respondents choose results and sustainability,
respectively. Only 15% of consumers concern the
most about the motive of CSR. In addition, the

level of consumers’ awareness and trust of CSR in
Wuhan are higher than those in Shanghai, but the
mean values of the other three response variables
have no signiﬁcant difference between two cities
(see Table II).

Moderating effects

The moderating effects of product category pre-
sumed by H4 and H5 are examined by multigroup
analysis via Amos 7.0. The sample is split into three
groups in which consumers receive CSR informa-
tion from a ﬁrm selling search, experience, and
credence products,. Then, multigroup Amos 7.0 is
performed to compare the following two models.
One model controls certain parameter being tested
to be equal across groups (equal model), whereas the

allows

to
vary across groups. The question is whether the
improvement

moving from the restricted to the more general
model. Signiﬁcance can be assessed on the basis of the
chi-square difference between the two models with
the use of a chi-square distribution with one degree of
freedom.

The results of the multigroup Amos analyses are
shown in Table III, As anticipated,
the positive
inﬂuences of perceived CSR on PA and PI are both
stronger, but the path from perceived CSR to CE is
more negative for the subsample involving experi-
ence products than the others. Moreover, the rela-
tionship between trust of CSR and CE is not
signiﬁcantly different across product categories, and
there is no need to test the moderating effects of
product category on the paths from trust of CSR to
PA and PI, because these path coefﬁcients are not
signiﬁcant. Therefore, H4-a is partially supported,
H4-b and H4-c are supported, but H5-a, H5-b, and
H5-c are not supported.

Demographics

relationships between consumers’ demographics and
their responses to CSR – are examined by multiple
linear regression analysis. As shown in Table IV,

Owing to the above results, it is inferred that the
relationships between consumers’ demographics and
their CSR responses
linear.
Therefore, the authors make a cluster analysis based
on dependent variables and thus classify consumers
into three types which are named warm-type,
practical-type, and shrewd-type (see Table V), and
then go to analyze the demographic distributions in
each consumer type (see Table VI).

Warm-type
They are the participants (44%) who are aware of and
trust ﬁrm’s CSR actions, and who show positive

to CSR including CE, PA,

responses
and
PI. Compared with the other two types, consumers
in this type are more likely, middle-aged (40–55
years) and with income ranging from 2000 to
3000 Yuan per month. Therefore, it is inferred that
the middle-class consumer groups are more likely
to positively react to CSR. Thus, This group is
named as ‘‘warm-type.’’

Practical-type
These are the participants (33%) who do not care
about and trust CSR in their daily consumptions,
and generally react to CSR information negatively.
Demographic analysis shows that consumers in this
type are relatively young (18–24 years) and have low
income (below 2000 Yuan per month). This group
is named as ‘‘practical-type.’’

Discussion

The overall situation of consumer responses
to CSR in China

According to IPT, each human being just likes an
information processing system, which takes in infor-
mation from the environment and processes it. The
processing procedure includes several basic stages
including awareness, judging, reasoning, and ﬁnally
behavioral reactions (Miller, 1956). Therefore,
in
order to understand consumer responses to CSR,
companies need to consider not only external out-
comes, such as PI, but also internal ones such as con-
sumers’ awareness, attitudes, and attributions about
why companies are engaging in CSR activities. This is
particularly important in the face of increasing product
differentiation and heightened competition (Bhat-
tacharya and Sen, 2004). This article explores con-
sumers’ overall responses to CSR in Chinese market,
and results show that there is a generally positive link
between CSR and consumers’ corporate evaluation
(Brown and Dacin, 1997; Ricks, 2005), product
association (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001) and purchase
intention (Becker-Olsen et al., 2006; Berens et al.,
2005; Carrigan and Attalla, 2001), which support the
recent suggestions conducted in western countries.
However, these positive links exist provided that
consumers have become aware of CSR information
manipulated by researchers. In daily consumption,
empirical results indicate that consumers show a low
level of general awareness of CSR, and that may be the
main reason why Chinese consumers will probably
not positively respond to CSR in reality (Singh et al.,
2008; Smith, 2000). Furthermore, it has been tested in
our study that consumers who are more aware of CSR
in daily consumption will show a higher level of PI
under CSR stimulus, which probably means that these
consumers have a better understanding of CSR
activities (Lee and Shin, 2010).

In addition, the authors establish consumers’ trust
of CSR as a partial mediator on the relationship
between consumers’ perceived CSR level and their
corporate evaluation, but this partial mediating effect
were not founded in the paths from perceived CSR

to PA and PI. That is, when consumers trust the
sincerity of ﬁrm’s CSR actions, they can transform
this trust to positive attitude toward the sponsoring
ﬁrm (Becker-Olsen et al., 2006), but not to positive
PA and PI. More importantly, Chinese consumers,
for their part, care more about the consequences and
sustainability rather than the motives of a ﬁrm’s CSR
actions (see Figure 3), and that is different from the
existing research indicating that consumers would
respond to CSR based on their perceived motivation
of a ﬁrm’s CSR actions (Ellen et al., 2006). This
result implies that the Chinese consumers are more
result oriented when they face CSR issues.

Consumers’ CSR responses and product category

Recent studies suggest that ﬁrms selling experience
products are doing more CSR practices (Siegel and
Vitaliano, 2007). Our study tries to explain this trend
from a consumer perspective. Results of this study
show that ﬁrms selling experience products are indeed
more likely to gain consumers’ product favor and
purchase support through positive CSR activities.
This results imply that CSR strategy is more suitable
for those companies selling experience products (such
as appliance industry) to achieve product differentia-
tion and make proﬁts, but this kind of companies have
no more advantage in building corporate reputation
through CSR.

However, how can one explain this result in
theory? Based on Petty and Cacioppo’s (1984a, b)
Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) theory, there
are two relatively distinct routes to persuasion. One,
called the central route, says that attitude changes
result from a person’s careful attempt to evaluate the
true merits of the advocated position. The other one,
called the peripheral route, says that attitude changes
occur because a person associates the attitude issue or
object with positive or negative cues or makes a
simple inference about the merits of the advocated
position based on various simple cues in the persua-
sion context (Petty and Cacioppo, 1984a). Ability
and motivation are the two important antecedents of
persuasion route, that is, when a person lacks the
ability or motivation to think about the attitude issue
or object, the peripheral route is hypothesized to
occur (Petty and Cacioppo, 1984b). This theory has
an important implication for explaining consumer


208

responses to CSR among different product catego-
ries. Speciﬁcally,
the true values of experience
products cannot be determined by inspection prior
purchase (Nelson, 1970). Therefore, based on ELM
theory, the authors conclude that, consumers, who
lack the ability to determine the product’s value
before purchasing (i.e., evaluating product
from
central route), are more likely to associate CSR – as a
positive cue or signal of ﬁrm’s honesty and reliability
(McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Siegel and Vitaliano,
2007) – with products by regarding CSR as a
persuasive message in their purchase decisions
(i.e., evaluating product from peripheral route).

Consumer demographics and CSR responses

This study demonstrates that the relationships be-
tween consumer demographics and consumer CSR
responses are not linear according to the regression
results. Therefore, a cluster analysis is conducted,
and three consumer types are identiﬁed based on
their CSR responses; it is found that some consumer
groups are more likely to respond to CSR positively
than others.

the welfare of

First, in the warm-type group, there are more
middle-income consumers aged from 1940s to 1950s
(born in 1950s–1960s). This middle-aged generation
experienced the Cultural Revolution of China, a
movement engineered to indoctrinate young people
with heroism and idealism. This generation sacri-
ﬁced their youth, material comforts, and family life
for
the country (Rosen, 2000).
Therefore, it is logical that this generation is more
likely to support CSR practices that are beneﬁcial to
society and acts out such support by consumptions.
Second, the practical-type group has the more
young people (born in 1980s–1990s) with low-
income, who grow up in the age of globalization and
experienced the Economic Reform of China. This
generation is more materialistic and affected by global
consumer culture (Hung et al., 2007). In their views,
companies are as responsible as they need to be if they
make a quality product, make a proﬁt, and maybe also
treat employees well (Mohr et al., 2001), and so they do
not base their purchasing on ethical and philanthropic
CSR especially under low-income conditions.

Third, in the shrewd-type group, consumers with
higher income and education in the age of 1930s

(born in 1970s) tend to respond to CSR neutrally,
because they are the middle generation affected by
both traditional and modern values, thus they are
more likely to balance between economic and nor-
mative factors, and show a neutral attitude toward
CSR in their consumption.

Management implications

First, this research supports the previous results re-
ported in the literature, suggesting that although
CSR activities in China are still at the beginning stage
(Gao, 2009), businesses operating in China should
note that there exists in China a viable and identiﬁ-
able market segment which considers positively a
company’s CSR activities in their consumptions.
Managers have an opportunity to please these con-
sumers while simultaneously achieving their strategic
objectives and making a contribution to society.

Second, managers

should develop marketing
communications of CSR to draw consumers’ atten-
tions. To win consumers’ trust, marketing commu-
nications could provide details about how ﬁrm’s
CSR programs have helped them to solve social
problems by especially stressing the results and sus-
tainability rather than only introducing the form and
input of their CSR activities.

Third, not all industries will be equally successful in
pleasing consumers by engaging in CSR practices.
Those industries selling experience products (vs. search
and credence products) are more likely to please con-
sumers and make proﬁts through CSR practices.
Although industries selling credence products (such as
insurance and health care) might be more difﬁcult to
affect consumers’ attitudes and behaviors through CSR
strategy, they may be more successful in inﬂuencing
other stakeholders such as the government.

Limitations and directions for further research

In order to understand CSR inﬂuence on consumer
responses (not the brand inﬂuence), the real name of
the CSR sponsoring ﬁrm (instead, a ﬁctitious name)
was not given in the CSR description embedded in
the questionnaires. This kind of study design is often
applied by the scholars in this ﬁeld (e.g., Mohr and
Webb, 2005; Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), although


Consumer Responses to CSR

209

it indeed has some limitations because consumer
responses
to CSR in reality will be inevitably
inﬂuenced by brand preference of a speciﬁc ﬁrm.
Therefore, how CSR activities impact consumers in
the different stage of consumers’ brand recognition
needs to be studied in the future. Second, future
research needs to collect data from more number of
industries to study the mechanism of consumers’
CSR responses and the differences of such mecha-
nism among various product categories. Finally, to
make the sample more representative,
future re-
search should increase the sample size and raise the
proportion of higher-income and elder participants
who are unwilling to accept investigation.

Conclusions

All in all, this study explores the overall situation and
peculiarities of consumer responses to CSR in the
Chinese market, and makes following theoretical
contributions.

First, this study is the ﬁrst one to build the missing
link between product classiﬁcation theory and CSR
theory from consumer perspective. The most strik-
ing outcome is that CSR actions sponsored by ﬁrms
selling experience products can evoke more positive
consumer responses which can be explained by ELM
theory.

the
Chinese consumers are more result-oriented when
they face CSR issues (i.e., Consumers’ most concern
about CSR is not ﬁrm’s real motivation to engage in
CSR, but the consequences and sustainability of
CSR).

Third, the results of this study indicate that the
relationships between consumer demographics and
their CSR responses are not linear, and it is attrib-
uted to the changing social culture and values deeply
rooted in every Chinese generation along with the
economic development of China.

This article reminds managers of ﬁrms operating
in China that CSR strategies in different industries
are unlikely to be equally successful in encouraging

purchasing, and not all consumers are willing to
support CSR in their daily consumption. As a new
marketing function, CSR strategy should be used
and communicated by carefully considering product
and consumer characteristics.
