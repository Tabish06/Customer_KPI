Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this study is to analyse whether CSR practices performed by European
companies (both those CSR practices related to marketing-based strategies and those that are not)
create value. That value creation will be gauged through two variables: reputation and shareholder
value creation.
Design/methodology/approach – To carry out this research, the 120 biggest European companies
whose CSR practices have been analysed by Deloitte and Kinchhoff in The Good Company Ranking
were taken. European ﬁrms have adopted an active stance on CSR and their organisational aspects
and responsibilities related to sustainability are better-founded compared with other companies.
Financial data and reputation were obtained from the Forbes and Fortune websites, respectively.
Findings – The ﬁndings obtained show that all CSR practices, especially those linked to enhancing a
company’s image, have a positive effect on shareholder value creation, given that investors are able to
detect the level of corporate commitment to sustainable development. On the other hand, none of the
typologies of CSR practices undertaken have a relevant inﬂuence on corporate reputation.
Originality/value – The results of this study advise managers to design their CSR strategies with
an orientation to increasing corporate reputation through large investments in CSR which prevent
them from being imitated by direct rivals.

1. Introduction
The triple bottom line (TBL) argues that, in addition to being interested in economic
issues, stakeholders may also be interested in other topics, related to social and/or
environmental issues (Ho and Taylor, 2007). Thus, stakeholders may be concerned
about whether a company is following a socially responsible path or whether a
company is acting in an environmentally friendly way.

Although this idea has been shared when talking about corporate social
responsibility, some studies (e.g. Norman and MacDonald, 2004) criticise it in the
sense that the TBL paradigm may be a rhetorical resource with scarce substance and
may distract managers and investors when they disclose and analyse social and
environmental reports. Therefore, in a context in which companies are making a more
speciﬁc, veriﬁable commitment to CSR and sustainability, it could be considered an
incorrect approach. In the same vein, from the triple bottom line CSR is related to
complex issues such as environmental protection, human resources management,

health and safety at work, relations with local communication media, and relations
with suppliers and consumers.

Within the scope of the current work, the theoretical framework of CSR is focused
on analysing the strategic use of CSR practices, since – according to McWilliams et al.
(2006) – researchers are moving beyond just deﬁning and identifying CSR practices to
examine the strategic role of CSR in organisations. Fombrun and Shanley (1990) point
out that investing in CSR attributes and practices may be important elements of
product differentiation and reputation building. In the same line, Porter and Kramer
(2006, p. 82) obtain that reputation is used by many companies to justify CSR practices
on the grounds that they will improve a company’s image and even raise the value of
its stock. With the purpose of identifying whether CSR practices – both those CSR
practices related to marketing-based strategies and those that are not – generate the
same value creation, we have developed a binary variable that identiﬁes whether
companies’ social behaviour has increased or not in the 2006-2008 period above their
industries’ average. Also, we have controlled for the ﬁrms’ size and industry.

The sample of companies is made up of the 120 largest European companies whose
CSR practices have been analysed by Deloitte and Kirchhoff Consult (2007, 2009)[1].
The results obtained underscore that all CSR practices have a positive effect on
shareholder value creation and investors are able to detect the level of corporate
commitment to sustainable development. On the other hand, none of the types of CSR
practices analysed have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on corporate reputation. This ﬁnding
may suggest some scepticism regarding these issues on behalf of different
stakeholders and interest-groups, perhaps due to their inability to differentiate real
CSR practices.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 develops the strategic use of CSR
practices and RBV theory. In section 3, CSR is analysed as a marketing tool and the
research hypotheses are presented. Section 4 describes the research methods
(population and sample), as well as the dependent, independent and control variables,
and several models based on the variables selected to test the hypotheses are deﬁned.
In section 5, the results of the empirical analysis are given and then discussed in
section 6. Section 7 summarises the main ﬁndings and consequences.

2. Triple bottom-line and CSR: RBV theory
Starting from the concept of TBL given in previous literature and that in this context
we alternatively use together with corporate social responsibility, social responsibility
and sustainable practices, this section will attempt to specify how CSR has come to be
deﬁned in its triple dimension (economic, social and environmental), and to integrate
CSR as a source of competitive advantage.

TBL can be utilised to capture the whole set of values, issues and processes that
companies must address or order to minimise any harm resulting from their practices
and to create economic, social and environmental value (Ho and Taylor, 2007). In this
regard, stakeholders (e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, governments,
community and the general public) may be interested in social or environmental
issues, in addition to economic performance. Thus, stakeholders may be concerned
about whether a company is following a socially responsible path or whether it is
acting in an environmentally friendly way.

In the same vein, from the triple bottom line CSR is related to complex issues such
as environmental protection, human resources management, health and safety at work,
relations with local communication media, and relations with suppliers and consumers.
Hence, companies voluntarily integrate social and environmental concerns in their
operations and interactions with stakeholders (Castelo and Lima, 2006).

In this context, our understanding of CSR should be extended to an examination of
the strategic use of CSR practices. Fombrun and Shanley (1990) established that
investing in CSR attributes and practices may be important elements of product
differentiation and reputation building.

Different theories have been used to explain the behaviour of economic unities
related to CSR issues, such as the agency theory (Friedman, 1970), stakeholder theory
(1984), stewardship theory (Donaldson and Davis, 1991), institutional and classical
economic theories ( Jones, 1995).

In addition to these overall theories that have been used in an attempt to ﬁnd
answers to different problems, other theories more directly linked to CSR have been
developed. For instance, Waldman et al. (2004) apply strategic leadership theory to
CSR, by arguing “that certain aspects of transformational leadership will be positively
correlated with the propensity of ﬁrms to engage in CSR and that these leaders will
employ CSR practices strategically” (McWilliams et al., 2006, p. 3).

Likewise, the resource-based-view of the ﬁrm (RBV) considers that CSR should be
extended to examine the strategic use of CSR practices and the strategic commitment
of companies to CSR. As regards the RBV theory, it was introduced by Wernerfelt
(1984) and developed latterly by Barney (1991), who points out that when “the
resources and capabilities are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable, they can
constitute a source of sustainable competitive advantage”. According to Castelo and
Lima (2006, p. 116) “resources include the assets that the ﬁrm uses to accomplish the
practices they are engaged in to convert inputs into outputs and can be classiﬁed as
tangible or intangible, and capabilities are thus seen as referring to the actions through
which resources are used and that the ﬁrm engages in to get something done and
accomplish its objectives”; consequently, resources and capabilities are used by ﬁrms
to develop and implement their strategies.

Hart (1995) was one of the ﬁrst studies to apply this theory to CSR, focusing
exclusively on environmental social responsibility and arguing that it can be a resource
or capability which leads to a sustained competitive advantage. Russo and Fouts (1997)
test this theory empirically on ﬁrm-level data regarding accounting and environmental
proﬁtability and ﬁnd that companies with higher environmental performance also
have higher ﬁnancial performance. McWilliams et al.
(2002) suggest that CSR
strategies supported by political strategies can be used to create a sustainable
competitive advantage and Hedstrom et al.
indicate that CSR strategies
represent the greatest opportunity currently available to the business world to achieve
greater success through new products and new technologies.

(1998)

According to McWilliams et al. (2006), the application of this theory to CSR would
involve some strategic implications. One of these implications is that, although CSR is
not directly related to a speciﬁc feature of the product or production process, it can be
regarded as an instrument for building and maintaining corporate reputation, by
considering that companies with a good reputation can improve their relationships

environmental
practices

with customers, investors, bankers, suppliers and competitors, at the same time that
they can attract the best employees and motivate current employees.

For Porter and Kramer (2006), strategic CSR involves both inside-out and outside-in
dimensions working in tandem and the essential test that should guide whether CSR is
worthy is if it presents an opportunity to create shared value that is a meaningful
beneﬁt for society, also valuable to the business. They argue that, through strategic
CSR, the company will make the most signiﬁcant social impact and reap the greatest
business beneﬁts.

When CSR is incorporated into value creation, the focus of the debate has to do with
demonstrating the beneﬁts to be had from adopting socially responsible projects.
Along this line, previous studies have shown that organisations with a positive CSR
proﬁle offer a better return for investors (Grossman, 2005). In this sense, Barnett (2007)
presents a conceptual framework that illustrates how ﬁrms generate ﬁnancial returns
from acts of CSR by developing a set of propositions to aid future research on the
contingencies that produce variable ﬁnancial returns to investment
in CSR.
Mainstream uptake of the CSR agenda ultimately reﬂects the growing signiﬁcance
of social responsibility as an indicator of ﬁnancial prosperity.

3. CSR for value creation or CSR as a marketing tool? Research hypotheses
This section analyses some features which can help to identify whether the social and
environmental practices carried out by different international companies are done in
order to enhance corporate reputation and shareholder value creation in line with the
RBV theory described above.

3.1 CSR and reputation
Reputation is an important factor in the social strategy – reputation – ﬁnancial
performance relationship. Within this relationship three kinds of studies can be
featured:

(1)

(2)

(3)

those that deal with the process of generating reputation or social prestige,
which companies obtain through the CSR policies or strategies that they pursue
(e.g. Brammer and Pavelin, 2004; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Toms, 2002);
those that analyse to what extent reputation co-inﬂuences the ﬁnancial
performance of the company (e.g. Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Rose and
Thomsen, 2004); and
those whose aim is to analyse the paradigms as a whole.

This research is encompassed within the ﬁrst group.

Weigelt and Camerer (1988) consider that “the company’s reputation consists of a
set of economic and non-economic attributes, together with the organisation, and
created from its past actions”. Therefore, it can be considered a variable stemming
from the social policy of the company (Fernandez and Luna, 2007). Fombrun (1996, p.
57), for example, describes reputations as strategic assets that “produce tangible
beneﬁts: premium prices for products, lower costs for capital and labour, improved
loyalty from employees, greater latitude in decision making, and a cushion of goodwill
when crises hit”.

Moreover, reputation can be understood as an essential intangible element in the
creation of competitive advantages for companies, especially from the perspective of


MD
48,10

1444

strategic models based on resources and capabilities and environment models, as well.
In this sense, Fombrun (1996) argues that reputation reﬂects a company’s relative
success in fulﬁlling the expectations of multiple stakeholders.

According to Poddi and Vergalli (2009), the concept of reputation seems to be of
fundamental importance for its effects on CSR practices. The basic concept consists of
considering reputation as a consequence and synthesis of a strategic business choice
(Preston and O’Bannon, 1997). The decision to engage in socially responsible practices
is perceived by consumers and by investors as a sign of possible future performance,
especially in developed countries, where most consumers are willing to support CSR
practices launched by corporations (Arli and Lasmono, 2010). Interestingly, Arli and
Lasmono (2010) ﬁnd that perceptions of the extent to which corporate are socially
responsible could be the determining factor when consumers have to buy similar
products with the same price and quality, so that they would buy from the ﬁrm that
has a socially responsible reputation.

On the other hand, although they theoretically recognise a strong link between CSR
practice and a reputation index, because the CSR variable is one of its fundamental
elements, Poddi and Vergalli (2009) ﬁnd that the reputation index is not signiﬁcant,
thereby highlighting either errors in their empirical model or a combination of internal
weights. It should be noted that another key variable in building the reputation
quotient is ﬁnancial performance.

Based on previous literature and the absence of unanimity in the CSR-reputation

relationship, we test the following hypothesis:

H1. Social and environmental practices are positively associated with corporate
reputation and this effect is higher for those ﬁrms that use CSR as a
marketing-based strategy.

3.2 CSR and shareholder value creation
The analysis of the inﬂuence of CSR practices on shareholder value creation should
provide information about whether social and environmental practices undertaken by
international companies create value for stockholders, or in other words, whether they
generate added value.

Shareholder value creation can be deﬁned as the increase in value for shareholders
over and above the expectations that are reﬂected in the proﬁtability required by these
stockholders. According to the shareholder model, the objective of the ﬁrm is to
maximise shareholder wealth through productive and dynamic efﬁciency. In this line,
Brealey and Myers (2002) and Block and Hirt (2000) argue that shareholder wealth
maximisation should be the overall goal of every corporate entity. Maximisation of
shareholders’ wealth ensures that shareholders are adequately compensated for the
risk undertaken (Dufrene and Wong, 1996). Woods and Randall (1989) generally accept
shareholder wealth as the aggregate market value of the common shares which in turn
is assumed to be the present value of the cash ﬂows that accrue to shareholders
discounted at their required rate of return on equity.

From the classical arguments that support the priority of increasing returns on
assets in order to increase proﬁts and stock prices for stockholders, we are witnessing
an evolution towards recent paradigms in which CSR is considered as essential in
shareholder value creation. As a consequence, the debate has focused on evidencing the


Social and
environmental
practices

1445

beneﬁts from adopting socially responsible projects and how this affects shareholder
value creation.

With regard to how to measure shareholder value creation, several performance
measures have been adopted both on the market and in accounting, providing rather
discordant results. The main accounting measures are linked to return on equity,
return on assets, return on capital employed (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Preston and
O’Bannon, 1997; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001), while market measures have to do with
market capitalisation, beta and market value added (Cochran and Wood, 1984;
Alexander and Buchholz, 1978).

Market measures have been defended by Hillman and Keim (2001), because they
“capture the relative success of ﬁrms in maximising shareholder value through
efﬁcient allocation and management of scarce resources”. In the same vein, Mittal et al.
(2008, p. 1439) argue that market measures are relevant in today’s context as these are
the economic performance measures which tell us how much wealth in the real sense
the companies have created for their stakeholders, and also how efﬁciently they are
utilising the capital raised from different stakeholders. If a company is creating
positive market measures, then it should be working in synchronisation with its CSR
metrics.

The utilisation of these measures is also justiﬁed by Hillman and Keim (2001) on the
basis of their ability to capture shareholder value creation. They capture both the
valuation and performance,
for the
shareholders and the overall quality of capital management (Stern Stewart, 1996).

the degree of wealth enrichment

that

is,

Market measures also have advantages when compared to other measures of
shareholder value creation. Lubatkin and Shrieves (1986) and Rappaport (1992)
consider these market measures as preferable to accounting measures because of their
ability to capture the future value of income streams more appropriately. Therefore,
accounting measures of performance, such as return on assets and return on equity, are
less useful because they are not as successful in capturing the long-term value of the
company or value created for shareholders; in addition, accounting measures of
performance have difﬁculty in capturing intangible relationships (Barney, 1991).

From an empirical perspective, the ﬁndings obtained are not conclusive enough. For
instance, Poddi and Vergalli (2009) ﬁnd that the market measure decreases with the
increase of CSR in their research on 417 international companies in 2004, thereby
contradicting the previous result in which market measure is higher in CSR ﬁrms. On
the contrary, Mittal et al. (2008) show a positive relationship between CSR practices
and market measures, signiﬁcant at the 5 per cent level; however, the correlation does
not seem to be very strong. By differentiating some areas into which CSR practices are
typically divided, Hillman and Keim (2001) point out that while community relations is
the only positive and signiﬁcant effect found in the regression analyses, product issues
and environmental issues have an insigniﬁcant and negative relationship with market
measures.

Given that the previous literature does not reach conclusive empirical ﬁndings

despite the theoretical arguments, we will test the following hypothesis:

H2. Social and environmental practices are positively associated with shareholder
value creation and this effect is higher for those ﬁrms that use CSR as a
marketing-based strategy.

4. Research methods
4.1 Population and sample
To carry out this research, we took as a sample the 120 largest European companies
whose CSR practices have been analysed by Deloitte and Kinchhoff (2007, 2009) in The
Good Company Ranking, which has also provided us with data on CSR practices.

We opted for European companies because they have adopted an active stance on
CSR (Van Tulder and Van der Zwart, 2006, pp. 225-229) and have developed the
organisational aspects and sustainability-related responsibilities more deeply than
other companies (Kolk and Pinkse, 2008). In this sense, given that government
regulation is a signiﬁcant determinant of corporate social and environmental
strategies, the European system has focused on encouraging companies to play an
active role, while it has also discouraged the evasive behaviour that ﬁrms display in
other countries, such as the US (Van Tulder and Van der Zwart, 2006, pp. 225-229). In
this line, Albino et al. (2009) analysed the companies included in the Dow Jones
Sustainability World Index, and obtained that the percentage of European companies
adopting environmental strategic approaches is above the sample average.

Financial data and reputation were obtained from the Forbes and Fortune web sites,

respectively.

4.2 Dependent and independent variables
The main variables that are analysed in this work are corporate reputation and
shareholder value creation, which will be the dependent variables; CSR practices form
the independent variable used in our model.

Reputation is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the company is one of the

most admired ﬁrms worldwide according to the Fortune Ranking, and 0, otherwise.

Shareholder value creation is a numerical variable measured by the ratio: [(Market
Value 2 Capital)2008 2 (Market Value 2 Capital)2006]/(Market Value 2 Capital)2006, in
which higher number equals greater value.

CSR is a numerical variable that measures the total points obtained by a speciﬁc
company in The Good Ranking. We have opted for this variable, because The Good
Ranking is considered as a prestigious list of European companies by investors,
analysts, rating agencies, and so on.

Marketing is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the company’s CSR value
has increased in the period 2006 to 2008 above the average of the industry which the
ﬁrm operates in and 0, otherwise.

CSR Marketing is a numerical variable which depicts the interactions of the
variables CSR and Marketing and identiﬁes the practices of the ﬁrms that improve
their behaviour above the average of the industry which they operate in. This
dichotomy aims to determine which companies are making larger investments in CSR,
and, according to McWilliams et al. (2006), would be assimilated to CSR strategies
oriented to marketing, which enable them to differentiate themselves from competitors,
since different stakeholders – and, especially, customers – are able to identify them.

4.3 Control variables
In addition to the dependent and independent variables proposed, Husted and Allen
(2007, p. 602) state that CSR researchers have emphasised the need to control for ﬁrm
size and industry sector, “to ensure that any relationship found between shareholder


Social and
environmental
practices

1447

value creation and social issue participation are not a result of other confounding
variables” (Hillman and Keim, 2001).

Firm size has been considered in previous papers, because it can inﬂuence both
corporate performance and CSR (e.g. Ullmann, 1985; Waddock and Graves, 1997;
Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2008; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2009). The
ﬁndings obtained when testing the inﬂuence of size are diverse. Whereas Hillman and
Keim (2001) obtain a signiﬁcant effect on shareholder value creation, using net income
and sales to represent size, Poddi and Vergalli
(2009) ﬁnd a non-signiﬁcant
relationship. Previous works have employed different measures for corporate size:
number of employees, total assets, total sales and net income; this research uses total
assets.

Different authors (e.g. Waddock and Graves, 1997; Fernandez and Luna, 2007) have
indicated a need to control for industry sector. A review of the inﬂuence of industry
sector on shareholder value creation and corporate reputation in previous works
indicates that the industry does not seem to inﬂuence the ﬁrst variable. As for the effect
on corporate reputation, the relationship is statistically signiﬁcant at the 10 per cent
level. In this research, the industry sector is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if
the company does business in sector k, and 0 otherwise. Moreover, in the model of
shareholder value creation, we include the variation in return on assets from 2006 to
2008, since it is an explanatory variable for market value.

4.4 Analysis technique
Based on the variables selected to test the ﬁrst of the hypotheses proposed, we have
deﬁned the following model (1), in which the corporate reputation is a function of CSR
practices, ﬁrm size and activity sector:

Corporate reputation ¼ fðCSR; CSR Marketing; Size; Activity SectorÞ

ð1aÞ

Model (1) can be empirically estimated by using the equation (1b):
Reputationi ¼ b0 þ b1CSRi þ b2CSRMarketingi þ b3SIZEi þ Skbi SECTORki þ 1 k

¼ 1. . .10

ð1bÞ

To test the second hypothesis proposed, we also estimate the following model (2), in
which shareholder value creation is a function of CSR practices, ﬁrm size and activity
sector.
Shareholder value creation ¼ fðCSR; CSR Marketing; Size; ROA and activity sectorÞ
ð2aÞ

Model (2) can be empirically estimated by using the equation (2b):

Shareholder value creationi ¼ b0 þ b1CSRi þ b2CSR Marketingi þ b3SIZEi

þ b4ROAi þ SkbiSECTORki þ 1 k

¼ 1. . .10

ð2bÞ


MD
48,10

1448

Model (1b) was checked empirically through a logistic regression owing to the binary
nature of the dependent variable, whereas a linear regression was run for model (2b)
given that shareholder value creation is a numerical variable.

5. Results of the empirical analysis
5.1 Statistical description
Tables I and II display the descriptive statistics for the variables used and their
bivariate correlations.

Table II displays the analysis of the relationships between independent and
dependent variables. More speciﬁcally, REPUTATION has a negative relationship
with the control variables FINANCIAL INDUSTRY (2 0.4469) and SIZE (2 0.3791),
and a positive association with the independent variables CSR (0.2796) and CSR
Marketing (0.2679). Also, the variable REPUTATION shows a negative relationship
with the variable CSR (2 0.3721). Signiﬁcant correlations between the independent
variables are not detected, suggesting the absence of multicollinearity problems in the
analysis models proposed.

5.2 Dependence models
The results obtained from estimating models 1b and 2b, designed to test the
hypotheses proposed, are provided in Tables III and IV.

Model 1, which checks the impact of sustainable practices on corporate reputation,
shows an explanatory capacity of 38.20 per cent for a conﬁdence level of 99 per cent
( p-value , 0.01). Only two out of the 12 variables proposed are statistically relevant:
SIZE and CONSUMER GOODS industry, which reﬂect control variables with a
signiﬁcant and positive effect. The remaining control variables have a positive
inﬂuence – except for TECHNOLOGY and UTILITY – but they are non-signiﬁcant
from a statistical perspective.

The independent variables proposed to test the effect of CSR practices, in general,
and marketing-based CSR practices, in particular, on business reputation enable us to
observe that they are positively valued by interest groups, although their effect cannot
be considered as statistically signiﬁcant. Consequently, hypothesis H1 cannot be
accepted.

Model 2, used to check the impact of sustainable practices on value creation for
shareholders, displays an explanatory capacity of 64.20 per cent, for a conﬁdence level
of 99 per cent.

Six out of the 13 variables proposed – four control and two independent variables –
are statistically signiﬁcant. Speciﬁcally, the variables representing oil and gas,

telecommunications, health care and consumer goods industries exhibit a positive and
statistically signiﬁcant impact, for a conﬁdence level of 95 per cent.

The independent variables CSR and CSR marketing positively inﬂuence value
creation for shareholders, for a conﬁdence level of 95 per cent. The ﬁnding that CSR
marketing has a signiﬁcant and positive effect indicates that such practices create
more added value than those featured as non-marketing-based. This result gives
support to the proposed hypothesis H2.

6. Discussion of results
The ﬁndings show that all CSR practices (both those undertaken with a reputational
purpose and those which are not) have a positive effect on shareholder value creation,
so that investors are able to detect the level of corporate commitment to sustainable
development.

These results are in accordance with the ﬁndings obtained previously, such as those
of Mittal et al. (2008) and Hillman and Keim (2001), whose evidence supports a positive
and signiﬁcant relationship between certain CSR practices and market measures
related to value creation for shareholders.

On the other hand, our results linked to shareholder value creation are opposed to
those of Poddi and Vergalli (2009), for whom there is an inverse relationship between
market measures and the increase in CSR practices.

As for our ﬁndings related to corporate reputation, none of the types of CSR
practices analysed evidence a relevant and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on reputation. This
ﬁnding seems to suggest some degree of scepticism regarding these issues on the part
of different interest groups, perhaps due to their inability to differentiate between real
CSR practices or marketing-based CSR practices. In this sense, our ﬁndings are in line
with Poddi and Vergalli (2009), who obtain that the reputation index is not signiﬁcant,
thereby highlighting either errors of their empirical model or a combination of internal
weights.

Therefore, the ﬁndings obtained indicate that all CSR practices undertaken by
companies do create value for shareholders; however, they do not inﬂuence corporate
reputation.

there is an increasing and greater concern about

7. Conclusions
7.1 General conclusions
the social and
Nowadays,
environmental effects of companies’ practices. In this vein, the triple bottom line can be
used to capture the whole set of values, issues and processes that companies must
address in order to minimise any harm resulting from their practices and to create
economic, social and environmental value.

The creation of value beyond the strictly economic value has changed the debate in
current corporations, which may undertake socially responsible practices in order just
to reinforce their reputations or indeed to create real value for shareholders.
Consequently, many corporations can use CSR practices as a marketing tool or
propaganda.

By taking into consideration that the understanding of CSR should be extended to
an examination of the strategic use of CSR practices, especially in a context in which
companies engage in CSR strategically on the basis of the RBV theory, this study has


MD

1452

attempted to provide some insights about whether CSR as a marketing tool oriented to
enhance ﬁrms’ image can be considered as a value driver. The effect of CSR practices
on reputation and shareholder value is analysed. With the purpose of identifying
whether CSR practices – both those CSR practices related to marketing-based
strategies and those which are not – generate the same value creation, we have
developed a binary variable that identiﬁes whether companies’ social behaviour has
increased above their industries’ average or not in the 2006-2008 period.

After studying the effect of CSR practices on a sample of the 120 largest European
ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that all CSR practices, and especially those related to marketing
purposes, that is, those linked to enhancing a company’s image and that we have
denominated CSR marketing, since it identiﬁes the practices of ﬁrms that improve their
behaviour above the average of the industry they operate in and determines which
companies are making larger investments in CSR, and have a positive effect on
shareholder value creation, so that investors are able to detect the level of corporate
commitment to sustainable development.

According to McWilliams et al. (2006) these CSR practices would be assimilated to
CSR strategies oriented to marketing, which enable them to differentiate themselves
from competitors, since different stakeholders – and, especially, customers – are able
to identify them. However, none of the types of CSR practices analysed evidence a
relevant and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on that reputation.

7.2 Managerial implications
The importance of CSR in society is not a fashion issue and is not likely to decrease any
time soon, since as, we have found in our research as well as others authors such as
Mittal et al. (2008) and Hillman and Keim (2001), CSR practices (both those undertaken
with a reputational purpose and those which are not) have a positive effect on
shareholder value creation.

Thus, managers at companies that engage in CSR need to consider what it implies
for the organisation. Moreover, the literature clearly states that a CSR strategy has to
be part of the main company strategy to be successful in the long term (Porter and
Kramer, 2006). And,
in this sense, the ﬁndings of the current work should be
considered by managers when designing a corporate CSR strategy.

More speciﬁcally, managers should consider that, in order to obtain competitive
advantages from these strategies, ﬁrms can increase their investment
in CSR
signiﬁcantly as compared to their competitors, so that the latter will be unable to
imitate them. These situations could lead different stakeholders – clients, investors,
etc. – to be able to appreciate the behaviour of a sustainable company, by comparison
with the remaining companies, which can create added value for the company.

7.3 Limitations and future research
On the one hand, this research should not be regarded as conclusive enough. From our
perspective, future studies should extend the number of practices analysed and the
number of companies used, by employing observations from different countries
worldwide (and not just from European companies), thereby considering different
regulatory contexts. Another issue which can be improved is the time period analysed.
Concerning performance measures, other choices can be employed, such as Tobin’s Q
or accounting measures of performance (e.g. return on assets and return on equity).


Nonetheless, according to the previous literature, these performance measures are less
useful because they are not as successful in capturing the long-term value of the
company or value created for shareholders.
