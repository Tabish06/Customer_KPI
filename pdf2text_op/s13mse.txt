Abstract
Starting  from  the  nature  of  state-owned  enterprises 
(SOEs),  this  paper  has  made  a  empirical  study  on 
influencing factors of Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) performance degree for both state-owned and 
non-state-owned enterprises in China. It shows that 
the enterprise nature is a remarkable influencing factor 
for CSR performance degree. SOEs make more social 
contributions than other types of enterprises, but only in 
terms of social donations, they make less. While small 
size and fast-growing enterprises make much more social 
donations. No matter using social contribution rate or 
social donation rate as the indicator, the operating results 
of both SOEs and non-SOEs have the same significant 
positive impacts on CSR performance degree.
Key words: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR);

1.  RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
Traditionally, SOEs have always been social organizations 
with a large number of social roles and obligations, even 
now they gradually follow the development of economic 
organizations, they seem unlikely to completely get rid 

of their social obligations and become purely economic 
animals. The country has also given SOEs the duties 
of controlling the economic lifeline and stabilizing the 
society. Over the years, SOEs have beard the major tasks 
in the national plans to support the smooth progress of 
reform and opening up as well as economic construction, 
and played important roles in the aspects of supply 
security, market prosperity, distribution adjustment and 
social stabilization. The social and economic system 
of China has fundamentally determined the historical 
mission, existential meaning and social commitments of 
SOEs. Due to the special nature, SOEs should not only 
bear the responsibility of strengthening economic, but 
also the responsibility of a society , which non-SOEs 
would not bear.

However, compared with SOEs, private enterprises 
are the products in society transformation period. As 
surviving outside the state system, the development 
environment  of  private  enterprises  far  cannot  be 
compared  to  that  of  SOEs,  so,  private  enterprises 
consider  more  about  survival,  development  and  the 
pursuit of profit. In recent years, with the economic 
development and the deepening of economic reform, 
the non-SOEs have played increasingly important roles 
in  the  whole  market,  and  also  assumed  more  social 
responsibilities. Therefore, Hypothesis 1:
1.1  Hypothesis 1
Hypothesis 1a: The nature of the ultimate controller has a 
major impact on CSR performance degree. Hypothesis 1b: 
As the ultimate controller, SOEs fulfill more CSRs than 
non-SOEs.

According  to  the  definition  of  Carroll  (2000), 
“CSR encompasses the economic, legal, ethical and 
discretionary (charity) expectations that a society has 
on organizations at a given point in time.” Trotman 
and Bradley (1981) pointed out that the enterprise size 
played an important role in the process of fulfilling CSR,

because the larger enterprises would be subject to more 
community concerns, and therefore necessary to bear 
more social responsibility. Additionally, the study of 
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) also found that the larger 
the enterprise it was, the higher reputation index of CSR 
it owned. Similarly, some other scholars (Atkinson & 
Glaskiewicz, 1988; Useem, 1988; Boatsman & Gupta, 
1996; Buchholtz, 1999) found that the enterprise size 
was  one  of  the  most  important  factors  of  corporate 
donations.  Regardless  of  their  profits,  the  bigger 
enterprises  always  seemed  more  willingly  to  make 
additional contributions for charity. Thompson et al, 
(1993) found that the number of employees of small 
enterprises and corporate donations were positively 
correlated. Also, in the research of impacts of firm size 
and industry type on corporate philanthropy, Louis H 
amaretto  and  Christa  H  amaretto  (Amato  & Amato, 
2007) pointed out that between the scale of enterprise 
and  corporate  philanthropy  expenses,  there  was  an 
existence of a non-linear relationship. On the other hand, 
with the accelerated pace of business growth, corporate 
demand  for  funds,  especially  cash  flow,  is  greatly 
increased, in which case, the cash flow expenditures of 
enterprises to fulfill their social responsibilities are more 
difficult. Therefore, Hypothesis 2:
1.2  Hypothesis 2
Enterprise size (size) has a significant impact on corporate 
philanthropy (Phi).

Hypothesis 2a: The larger enterprise size, the higher 

degree of CSR performance. 

Hypothesis 2b: the rapid growth of enterprise business 

may reduce the performance degree of CSR. 

According to the theory of signal transfer, through 
fulfilling CSR, a good external image of the enterprise 
can be transferred to stakeholders, which gains more 
motivation  to  fulfill  their  CSR  in  future,  forming  a 
virtuous circle. Scholars (Ullmann, 1985; McGuire, 1988; 
Roberts, 1992; Waddock, 1997) pointed out that with idle 
resources, enterprises often used the highest free handling 
and flexibility cash (liquidity) of idle resources to do 
charitable activities, which would generate the behaviors 
of CSR, for example corporate donations. On the other 
hand, the premise of corporate donations is economic 
strength. Therefore, the quality of business performance 
directly determines the number of donations for charitable 
projects (Tian Lihua, Chen Xiaodong, 2007). 

There are some scholars believe that the positive 
correlation between CSR and financial performance is 
based on the ralation that financial results as causes and 
CSR behaviors as results: the better (worse) financial 
results, the better (worse) CSR performance degree. 
Keith et al, (1975) considered the strong profitability of 

large enterprises had a greater impact on social issues. 
Empirical studies of Preston and O’Bannon (1997) also 
verified that the financial results of enterprises had a 
positive influence on social responsibility. McGuire et 
al, (1988) found through empirical evidence that the 
higher late CSR performance degree was due to the 
early financial results. Kraft and Hage (1990) as well as 
Preston et al, (1991) also found that the financial results, 
whether in the early or current, there was a strong positive 
correlation with the social responsibility performance. 

CSR of SOEs have both the non-economic goals and 
economic goals. On the whole, CSR of SOEs focuses 
on non-economic goals, and economic goals serve non-
economic goals. So, the impact of CSR of SOEs affected 
by their business performance is weaker than other types 
of enterprises. Therefore, Hypothesis 3:
1.3  Hypothesis 3
Corporate cash flows and operating results (Cap) have a 
significant impact on corporate philanthropy (Phi). 

Hypothesis 3a: With good surplus performances, 
enterprises have more impetus and abilities to perform 
more CSRs, in the case that the benefits of fullfilling CSR 
outweigh their costs. 

Hypothesis 3b: SOEs as the ultimate controller, the 
impact of their surplus results on social responsibility is 
weaker than those of non-SOEs.

2.    MODEL,  VARIABLE  DEFINITIONS 
AND DESCRIPTIONS
Two methods are used to measure CSR. One is the social 
contribution rate (CE), which is calculated by adding 
the  responsibilities  of  the  various  stakeholders  and 
then dividing by the owner’s equity. The calculation of 
social contribution uses the definition in “strengthening 
the listed corporates social responsibility work notice” 
published by Shanghai Stock Exchange in May 2008. 
CE = (Net profit + Income tax expenses + Business 
taxes and surcharges + Cash paid to and for employees 
+ the current staff remunerations - the previous staff 
remunerations + financial expenses + donations - sewage 
charges and clean-up costs) / owners’ equity. The method 
of calculating social donation (SD) rate is to use the 
total amount of community donations divided by the 
main business incomes. To test the hypothesis, we have 
established the following model (1), (variables are defined 
in Table 1).

It can be seen from Table 3 that if use CE (social 
contribution rate) as a CSR measurable indicator, the 
coefficient of SOE is significantly positive, indicating 
that SOEs make more social contributions than other 
types of corporates; however, the coefficient of SIZE 
do not pass the test of significance, indicating that there 
is no significant relation between the enterprise size 
and corporate contributions to society. The indicator 
of GA coefficient is significantly negative, indicating 
that the faster growth of the enterprise, the less social 
contributions; the coefficient of ROA is significantly 
positive,  and  passes  the  test  of  1%  significance, 
indicating that for non-SOEs, corporate performance 
has a significant positive impact on social contributions. 
The  cross-productterm  of  ROA  and  SOE  has  not

owned Enterprises in China

passed the significance test, indicating that there is no 
significant difference in the impacts of corporate business 
performance on social contributions for SOEs and non-
SOEs. 

But, when SD (social donation rate) is made as the 
measurable indicator, the social contribution of SOEs is 
less than that of other types of corporates. It is believed 
that non-SOEs can improve their reputation through 
donations (Navarro, 1988; Brown, Helland and Smith, 
2006). The empirical results from Shan Li Wei, Gan 
Li and Zheng Tao (2008) support the idea that non-
SOEs have economic motivations to achieve the desired 
advertising effectiveness through donations. Private 
enterprises in the lower degree of information asymmetry 
are more motivated to improve their reputation and 
image by the use of donations. In addition, the property 
right of China’s SOEs belongs to the whole people, so, 
their operating benefits should be also shared by all the 
people, if SOEs use these resources which belong to the 
whole people to do charity, it should be arranged by the 
government, rather than by themselves. 

The larger enterprise size (SIZE), the less donations; 
the  faster  growth  (GA)  of  the  company,  the  more 
donations. Using different indicators, the conclusions are 
the opposite, which is inconsistent with the assumptions. 
We believe that this is due to the different emphases of 
different indicators. To measure the social contribution, 
donations belong to a higher level of social responsibility, 
more biased towards the moral level. And donations can 
improve the reputations for small fast-growing companies 
with more motivations. Just because of this characteristic 
of donations, the coefficient of ROA is significantly 
positive, and passes the significant test of 1%, while the 
cross-productterm of ROA and SOE does not pass the test 
of significance, the empirical results of which is the same 
to those of using social contribution rate as indicator. It 
shows that the better economic foundation of corporates, 
the greater social contributions. However, the social 
contribution performances of SOEs and non-SOEs are not 
significantly different.

CONCLUSION
In  the  impact  of  the  enterprise  nature  on  social 
contributions, different social contribution indicators 
bring different conclusions. Using social contribution 
rate as the measurable indicator of social contributions, 
SOEs make greater social contributions than other types 
of corporates, but when social donation rate as as the 
measurable indicator, SOEs make smaller. Small scale and 
fast-growing corporates make more donations. No matter 
which measurable indicator is used, the social contribution 
performances of SOEs and non-SOEs are both positive 
without significant differences.
