ABSTRACT

In their seminal article Eisenberger.  Huntington.  Hutchinson, and Sowa (1986) 

developed  the theory o f perceived organizational support (POS)  based on social 

exchanges.  The current model expands previous theory by proposing three mediating 

mechanisms  underlying the effects o f POS on employee commitment and turnover 

intentions:  (1) organization-based self-esteem (OBSE). (2) organization-based self- 

concept and (3) employee sense o f obligation to the organization.  Further,  it was 

proposed  that the mediator that is the strongest is determined by the  level at which the 

individual  construes the self (i.e..  individual, relational or collective level o f self:  Brewer 

&  Gardner.  1996).  Finally, the model  proposed that the relationship between  POS and 

employee obligation would be moderated by the degree to which the  individual endorses 

an exchange  ideology.

The proposed model was tested in two studies.  The first study administered

paper-and-pencil questionnaires to employed university students fN = 210).  The results

of Study  1  found support for a relationship between POS and normative commitment

mediated  by  employee sense o f obligation: and between POS and affective and

continuance commitment mediated by OBSE and the self-concept.  A direct effect, but

not a m ediated relationship, was found between POS and turnover intentions.  Some

support was  found  for the moderating  influence o f level o f self on the  POS-mediator

relationship.  Specifically, the relational  level o f self moderated the relationship between

POS and OBSE. and the collective self moderated the relationship betw een POS and 

organization-based self-concept.  In contrast to the moderating effects o f level of self, 

there  w as no m oderating effects o f exchange ideology on the POS-empIovee sense o f 

obligation relationship.

The  second study administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires to emergency 

medical  technicians and paramedics (N=72) and their direct superv isors (N=21). As  in 

Study  1. OBSE and self-concept mediated the relationship between POS and affective 

and continuance commitment.  Additionally. OBSE and self-concept mediated the 

relationship  between POS and job performance.  However,  in contrast to Study  1. 

employee sense o f obligation did not mediate the effects o f POS.  Likewise, level o f sell 

and exchange ideology did not demonstrate the hypothesized moderating effects. 

Explanations for these results and directions  for future research are provided.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

1  am extremely grateful  for the encouragement and support o f the people who 

have touched my  life throughout the past five and a half years.  First.  I  would like to 

thank my  family who has loved and encouraged me each day.  My  husband.  Bob. has 

been a great source o f strength and comfort during the difficult times. 

I am very proud to 

share my  life and accomplishments with him.  My parents. Tom and  Loretta Davies, 

taught me the importance o f dreams and persistence -  now more than ever. I  understand 

that one cannot happen without the other.  My sincerest wish is to  make my parents proud. 

I also wish to thank my  father and mother-in-law. Greg and  Linda Popham.  Their 

generosity  with  love, hope and support have touched me in ways  I  cannot begin to 

express.  Also, many thanks to my brother.  Ron. and sister-in-laws  Rachel  and Colleen 

who  never lost faith  in my ability and encouraged me when  I doubted myself.

Second.  I am  indebted to my advisor. Dr.  Rosalie Hall.  Without her guidance, 

there would be a profound gap in my knowledge, professionalism and humanity.  I  have 

never known her to turn away  from another or to refuse to share her knowledge and time.

I  admire her knowledge and am incredibly honored to have the opportunity to learn from 

her.  I  would also thankful  for the advice and assistance of my committee members:  Dr. 

Rebecca Erickson.  Dr.  Paul  Levy'.  Dr.  Robert Lord, and  Dr. Janice  Yoder.

I  would also like to extend a warm thanks to everyone connected  with the field 

site where data was collected for Study 2. especially  Ron.  Dan. Chuck and Paul.

Likewise.  I  want to express my gratitude to Avatar M anagement Serv ices.  Inc. who 

provided support during the past year -- especially Linda.  Mark. Diane, and everyone else 

who patiently  listened ad nauseam to the details o f the dissertation.  Mark Gardner has 

been a tremendous help by providing his time and assistance in gaining access to the field 

site and  in providing resources for data collection.

Finally.  I  wish to thank the many people who  I  have had the honor o f meeting and 

befriending along the way.  I owe a special thanks to Teri. who shared many  laughs with 

me and helped me  learn the significance of not doing the "Happy  Dance."  Also. I  wish to 

thank Jenn.  who  understands and shares my dreams for the future.  She has been a source 

of inspiration during the last several months and has kept my spirits high.  1  especially 

wish to thank  Marybeth. not only her assistance in coding data,  but also for her 

friendship.  She.  more than anyone, understands the disappointm ents and joys that I  have 

faced — she has always been there to cry with me and cheer me on.

CHAPTER I

STATEMENT OF  PROBLEM

Increasingly organizations have become concerned with the images they portray to

a variety of constituencies.  Organizations are concerned not only with perceptions held

by external constituents, but also with the images held by internal employees (Dutton.

Dukerich. &  Harquail.  1994).  Concern over employee perceptions o f the organization

may  be exacerbated,  in part, by recent trends in downsizing and other unfavorable

organizational decisions (e.g.. pay freezes, decreases in benefits, budget cuts. etc).  These

negative events may  be linked to lower employee loyalty, organizational satisfaction and

work effort (Armstrong-Stassen.  1997).  Also, given the current trend o f low

unemployment, organizations need to be concerned about attracting and retaining high

quality employees.  As such, there has been  interest in  improving employee perceptions

that the organization cares for and is committed to its workforce.

Perceptions that the organization is committed and supportive have obvious

benefits  for the employee.  In the face o f general dissatisfaction with corporate America.

employees may  have an increased need for security within their particular organization.

Likewise, considering the investments -- in time and effort — that employees make in

their organization, employees may be more satisfied overall  when the organization is

perceived as willing to reciprocate. Additionally, organizations which successfully

demonstrate commitment and support may benefit through the development of a highly

dev oted workforce with the willingness to exert extra effort on behalf o f the organization. 

Thus, the ability o f organizations to foster images of support and commitment may be 

essential  to organizational success.

The  idea that organizational actions expressing commitment to employees is 

important has recently been explored in theoretical and empirical works focusing on a 

variable called perceived organizational  support (POS).  Eisenberger.  Huntington. 

Hutchinson, and Sowa (1986) developed the construct o f perceived organizational 

support based on a theory o f social exchange relationships.  These authors suggested that 

due to  perceptions o f organizational support employees  feel obligated to reciprocate the 

commitment that they receive from the organization.  And indeed, empirical studies of 

POS  have demonstrated relationships with relevant employee attitudes such as 

satisfaction, commitment, and turnover intentions.  However, no theoretical or empirical 

research has  investigated alternate reasons for the existence o f the relationship between 

organizational  support and employee attitudes.  This dissertation expands the previous 

model o f organizational support to investigate the potential mediating role of the self in 

POS-outcome relationships.

Perceived Organizational  Support

Perceived organizational support (POS)  is the em ployee's perception that the 

organization  values his or her contributions and  is concerned for the employee's well­

being (Eisenberger et al..  1986).  The perception that the organization is committed to the 

employee  is based on what Eisenberger et al.  referred to as the "anthropomorphic 

ascription o f dispositional traits to the organization" (p.  500).  In other words, employees

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


form an impression o f the organization based on the social and instrumental support 

provided by the organization.  According to  Eisenberger et al.. employee perceptions ot 

support,  in turn, obligate the employee to support the organization's goals and values. 

The  means by  which this relationship occurs is discussed in the  following sections.

Social  Exchange Mechanism

Eisenberger et al. (1986) proposed their theory o f organizational commitment 

based on social  exchange.  Social exchanges involve unspecified obligations to 

reciprocate when one has benefitted from another and are the  foundation for long-term 

social relationships (Blau.  1964).  Social exchanges are unenforceable, ambiguous and. 

therefore,  involve high levels of trust and obligation between the parties o f the exchange. 

According to Eisenberger and colleagues, employees develop general  beliefs regarding 

the organization's concern for employees in order to judge the organization's  willingness 

to meet their needs.  These general beliefs, termed perceptions o f organizational  support 

(POS).  in turn  obligate the individual to repay the organization  for the commitment it has 

demonstrated to the employee.

Thus, because o f a social exchange  mechanism.  POS  has been hypothesized and 

shown to  be positively related to commitment, work effort, organization citizenship 

behaviors, and negatively related to absenteeism and turnover intentions (Eisenberger et 

al..  1986:  Eisenberger.  Fasolo & Davis-Lamastro.  1990).  However, the key theoretical 

link between  POS and work attitudes and behavior -  a sense o f obligation engendered by 

social exchange -  has not been directly measured or tested for mediation.  Although 

Eisenberger et al.  (1986) hypothesized a social exchange mechanism, their research has

only empirically  investigated the moderating effects o f exchange ideology (the general 

belief that people should exert effort in exchange for benefits received). Specifically, they 

show that persons who more strongly believe in reciprocation o f efforts for benefits show 

a stronger relationship between POS and absenteeism (Eisenberger et al..  1986) and work 

effort (Orpen.  1994). This m oderator effect is certainly consistent with the theoretical 

proposition that feelings o f organizational support produce a sense o f indebtedness or 

obligation which in turn influences organizational outcomes.  However, to date no 

research has directly measured the employee sense o f obligation to the specific 

organization, nor has obligation been treated as a mediator o f POS.  Thus, the  first 

contribution o f the current study  is to directly test whether an employee's sense o f 

obligation to the employing organization indeed mediates between POS and 

organizational attitudes and behavior.  Additionally, the study tests whether an 

em ployee's sense of obligation towards the organization (due to  POS)  is stronger if he or 

she strongly endorses an exchange ideology, by proposing and testing  for the moderating 

effects o f exchange ideology on the  POS-obligation relationship.

Alternative Mediating Mechanisms 

A  major contribution o f the current study is to propose that social exchange may 

be only one o f several m echanisms underlying the relationship between POS and 

organizationally-relevant attitudes and behavior. Thus,  in this dissertation I develop an 

argument that the relationship between POS and organizational attitudes and behavior 

(i.e.. affective commitment, continuance commitment, normative commitment, turnover 

intentions, and  in-role job performance) may also be mediated by one or both o f the

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


following self-related mechanisms: (1) the employee's organization-based sense of self­

esteem. or (2) the employee's organization-relevant self-concept (see Figure  1). 

Organization-based self-esteem

In addition to inducing feelings o f indebtedness, perceptions o f organizational 

support may also communicate the worth o f the employee to the organization.  Research 

has demonstrated the importance o f perceptions o f valued others*  opinions o f one’s self 

(i.e..  reflected appraisals) in evaluations o f personal  worth (e.g.. Cooley.  1902:  Lear}-. 

Tambor. Terdal &  Downs.  1995).  Thus, support messages communicated by the 

organization may be important in the formation o f the employee's self-perceived worth in 

organizational  roles.  In essence, when the organization makes investments  in and 

commitments to employees, employees perceive themselves to be important, competent 

and worthwhile within the organization.

Pierce et al. (1989) developed the construct o f organization-based self-esteem 

(OBSE) as an  indicator of the em ployee's perceived worth as communicated by the 

organization.  Thus,  it was hypothesized that POS should be positively  related to OBSE. 

Again,  this relationship may stem  from the importance o f reflected appraisals in the 

evaluation o f self-worth.  Further.  Pierce et al. (1989: see also Korman.  1970) argued that 

workers alter their attitudes and work behavior to create consistency with levels of self­

esteem.  Therefore. OBSE was hypothesized to be the second mediator o f the POS- 

attitude/behavior relationship.

Organization-based self-concept

The third potential mediator is the em ployee's organization-based  self-concept, or 

the em ployee's incorporation o f the organization into the self-concept.  The  proposed 

model suggested that organizational support increases the value o f being an  

organizational  member.  Based on social  identity theory (Ashforth &  M ael.  1989: Tajfel & 

Turner.  1986).  when the organization is viewed as a positively-valued social group, 

employees will alter their self-concepts to incorporate the prototypical characteristics o f 

the organization.  As such,  in the current hypothesized model.  POS  was modeled to be 

positively  related to organization-based self-concept.  Additionally, the literature on self- 

consistency (e.g.. Swann.  1987) suggested that individuals adopt attitudes  and behavior 

that promote a consistent self-view.  Likewise.  Brewer and Gardner (1996) suggested that 

when an individual defines the self as synonymous with a social group, the  individual  is 

motivated  toward protecting and enhancing group welfare as an end  in  itself.  Thus, based 

on  motivations  for self-consistency and group welfare, organization-based, self-concept 

was hypothesized to partially mediate the relationship between  POS and organizational 

attitudes and behavior.

Moderating effects of self-construal

While all three proposed  intervening variables (sense o f obligation, self-esteem, 

self-concept) in die hypothesized model are argued to partially mediate the influence o f 

POS.  it is theoretically useful to determine which o f the three will  play a dominant role. 

Thus,  it is additionally proposed that the level at which the self is construed (i.e.. 

individual, relational, or collective:  Brewer & Gardner.  1996) will  m oderate the

relationship between POS and the three mediating processes.  In other words,  while all 

three mediators may  be relevant for all employees, the mediating path which  is the 

strongest for a given individual will depend on the level at which the self is chronically 

8

construed by that person.

For those  who  identify the self in terms of individual traits differentiating the self 

from others (i.e..  define the self at the individual  level),  the exchange-induced sense of 

obligation to the organization should have the strongest mediating relationship.  For those 

employees who define the self in terms o f interpersonal  relationships with other 

individuals (i.e.. define the self at the relational level), reflected appraisals will  be an 

important source o f self-evaluation, thus organization-based self-esteem (Pierce. Gardner. 

Cummings &  Dunham.  1989) should have the strongest mediating relationship.  Finally, 

for those who define the self in terms o f group membership (i.e.. in terms o f the collective 

level o f self-identity), organization-based self-concept should have the strongest 

mediating relationship.

In sum. the purpose o f the current research was to propose and test a model of 

exchange-related  beliefs and self-structures as mediating mechanisms in the relationship 

between  POS and organizationally-relevant attitudes and behavior.  It was proposed that 

POS  influences organizational attitudes (affective commitment, continuance 

commitment,  normative commitment, turnover intentions, and in-role performance) by 

way of three mediating processes:  sense o f obligation, organization-based self-esteem, 

and organization-based self-concept. The entire model  including all variables discussed 

above and the form o f relationships between them is depicted in  Figure  1.

Methodology

The proposed model was tested using data collected from (1) employed university 

students (Study  1) and (2) employees and their immediate supervisors (Study 2). 

Participants  in the studies completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires measuring POS 

(Survey o f Perceived Organizational Support:  Eisenberger et al..  1986): exchange 

ideology (Eisenberger et al..  1986): employee sense o f obligation: OBSE (Pierce et al..

1989): organization based self-concept (Identification with Psychological Groups. Mael 

& Tetrick.  1992: and Adjective Overlap):  independent level o f self-construal (Singelis. 

1994): relational self-construal (Cross. Bacon. & Morris. 2000): collective self-construal 

(Gabriele &  Gardner.  1999): affective commitment, continuance commitment and 

normativ e commitment (Meyer. Allen. & Smith.  1993). and turnover intentions 

(Cammann.  Fichman. Jenkins. & Klesh.  1983).

Study  1  was conducted in order to investigate the factor structure o f several 

questionnaires  that were either created for the study or for which previous measurement 

information  was ambiguous, and to test the hypothesized model. Study 2 was a 

replication and extension o f Study  1  using data from employees.  The second study also 

collected a measure o f the employee's in-role job performance  from participants'  direct 

supervisors.  The proposed model and specific hypotheses were tested through the use of 

correlation, multiple regression and structural equation modeling.

Model Contributions 

Incorporation o f self-structures into the model o f perceived organizational support 

has both theoretical  and applied value.  First, previous research on organizational support

has not included the self as a primary element o f the model.  Eisenberger et al. (1986:

1990)  suggested that high levels o f POS may  result in the employee incorporating 

organizational  membership into the self-concept.  These authors, however, have not 

expanded upon the role o f the self beyond the needs for esteem, approval and affiliation 

in an exchange  framework (Eisenberger. Cummings. Armeli &  Lynch.  1997);  nor has the 

relationship  between POS and self-structures  been directly tested.  Other researchers 

(Ashforth &  Mael.  1989:  Mael & Ashforth.  1992) have investigated the self-concept in 

terms o f organizational membership and have called for more theory on potential 

antecedents and consequences o f defining the self in regard to the organization.  Thus, 

while the  POS and self literatures are complementary, they have not been incorporated 

within a comprehensive model.

Second, the inclusion o f self-structures may further an understanding o f the 

implications o f the perceived work environment for the individual. To the extent that the 

employee believes the organization cares  for and values employee contributions, his or 

her self-esteem  may  increase.  Increased self-esteem is beneficial  for the welfare o f the 

individual employee.  It may also benefit the organization.  Based on motivations for self- 

consistency. or self-verification, employees may adopt attitudes and behavior that 

maintain  levels o f self-worth (Korman.  1976:  Swann.  1987: Swann &  Read.  1981). 

Therefore, employees may remain with the organization which has provided them with a 

sense o f positive self-worth.  Moreover, if organizations can increase self-esteem  by 

providing a supportive environment, employees may respond with increased job 

satisfaction, affective commitment, and decreased intentions to leave the organization.

11
Additionally, as discussed by Eisenberger et al. (1986). employees may alter their 

self-concepts based on treatment from the organization.  The alteration of the self-concept 

to  be more inclusive o f organizational membership has two  potential  implications  for the 

organization.  First.  Brewer and Gardner (1996) theorize that individuals who define the 

self in terms o f collective group membership are concerned with the welfare o f the group 

as an end in itself.  Thus, such individuals may  be willing to exert effort toward 

organizational goals, not in exchange for personal rewards,  but instead to benefit the 

group as a whole (Ashforth &  Mael.  1989).  Second, organizational attitudes and 

behaviors may be  more resilient to changes  in level o f support because of the desire to 

maintain the self-concept.  Individuals may be more forgiving o f violations o f the 

exchange relationship because to do otherwise would mean altering valued aspects o f the 

self-concept (Swann.  1987).

Thus, em ployees may adopt beneficial organizational  attitudes when treated well 

by organizations.  This phenomenon may.  in part, be due to  social exchange, however, 

such explanations  may not account for the broad range o f attitudes and behaviors affected 

by  POS.  The m ediating  functions o f OBSE and organization-based self-concept may 

more  fully explain the effects o f support on employee attitudes.

Although there are potential gains, there may also be negative consequences  for 

developing highly  identified employees.  While  individuals  may be inclined to  forgive 

minor transgressions on the part o f the organization, employees who define themselves in 

terms o f organizational  membership may be more sensitive to organizational treatment. 

For example. Tyler (1997)  found that employees who draw a large part of their identity

12

from the group are more concerned with the interpersonal treatment from  leaders o f the 

group.  Likewise, there may be more pronounced negative reactions from  individuals with 

strong organization-based self-concepts who are the targets o f downsizing or forced 

retirement.  Thus,  if organizational support is linked to self-esteem and self-identity, 

organizations may also need to enhance perceptions o f procedural  and relational justice in 

decision-making.

Finally, the  findings o f the proposed model suggest ways in w hich the more stable 

aspects of the self (i.e..  levels o f self-representation)  influence perceptions of the 

organization.  The  level o f self allows the investigation, not only o f how the organization 

can alter the self-concept (e.g.. the POS-OBSE relationship), but also o f howr the more 

stable aspects o f self-structures influence the way  in  which organizational actions are 

interpreted.

CHAPTER II 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

The current study investigated the manner by which organizational support 

impacts employee attitudes.  POS  has been defined as employees*  perceptions that the 

organization  is committed to them (Eisenberger et al..  1986).  POS has been  found to 

correlate with multiple organizationally-relevant attitudes and these relationships have 

been explained solely in terms o f a social exchange mechanism.  In other words, 

employees reciprocate the support that they receive by increasing their own loyalty to the 

organization.  However,  it is theorized here that organizational support also changes 

employees*  organization-relevant self-esteem and self-concept.  When support is 

received, employees may then increase their loyalty and other organizationally  beneficial 

attitudes and behavior because the organization represents a valued aspect o f their selves. 

In other words, employees are loyal  to their organization because o f motivations for self- 

consistency and collective welfare.

Chapter two  first presents a review of the relevant literature on perceived 

organizational  support (POS). organization-based self-esteem (OBSE). self-identity, and 

levels o f self-construal.  A model o f the mediating and moderating roles o f self-structures 

in the relationship between POS and organizational attitudes is proposed along with 

specific  research hypotheses.  Finally, the methodology  for formal testing o f the 

hypotheses  is presented.

Perceived Organizational Support 

Definition o f Perceived Organizational  Support 

14

Eisenberger et al. (1986) suggested that employees base their attitudes and 

behaviors on the likelihood that they will benefit from involvement in the organization. 

Employees gauge the likelihood that the organization will reward them based on their 

general  perceptions o f organizational  support.  Perceived organizational support (POS) 

has been defined as perceptions, on the part o f the employee, that the organization cares 

about the em ployee's well-being and values his or her contributions.  In other words.  POS 

is the em ployee's belief that the organization is committed to the individual.  If the 

employee perceives that the organization is committed, the employee will  feel obligated 

to  reciprocate by way of increased effort and  loyalty.

POS  is theorized to develop as a result o f organizational actions as interpreted by 

the individual (Eisenberger et al..  1986;  1990). To the extent that the organization treats 

employees preferentially, and provides job opportunities, resources and developmental 

experiences, the employee will perceive the organization to be committed.  Indeed, 

correlational studies have found POS to be related to training and development 

opportunities,  number o f promotions and tenure (Wayne.  Shore &  Liden.  1997).  feedback 

from supervisor and participation  in goal-setting (Hutchinson & Gartska.  1996). and 

procedural justice in performance appraisal (Fasolo.  1995).  Other researchers have 

theorized about the impact of procedural and relational justice on the development o f 

support perceptions (e.g.. Fasolo.  1995; Shore. Barksdale & Shore.  1995).  Moorman. 

Blakely, and N iehoff (1998) suggested that the procedures used to make decisions

15
communicate the concern the organization has for the employee, consequently  increasing 

perceptions o f support.  Moorman et al. (1998) found strong support for the relationship 

between  procedural justice and POS (factor correlation equal to  .71. pc.001).

Effects o f POS on Employee Attitudes and  Behavior 

According to  Eisenberger and colleagues, employees feel the need to repay  the 

benefits  received  from the organization.  Based on notions o f the norm o f reciprocity and 

social exchange, employees are  faced with vague,  long-term obligations to  repay the 

organization.  One way the debt can be repaid is to adopt positive organizational attitudes 

and behaviors.  In support o f this idea. POS  has shown positive relationships with 

affective commitment, organizational citizenship behaviors, job satisfaction, job 

involvement, suggestions  for improving safety and work effort, as well as negative 

relationships with absenteeism, turnover intentions, work stress, and antagonistic work 

behaviors (Cropanzano.  Howes. Grandey. & Toth.  1997:  Eisenberger et al..  1986: 

Eisenberger et al..  1990: Guzzo. Noonan. &  Elron.  1994;  Hofmann &  Morgeson.  1999: 

Hutchinson.  1997: Jones.  Flynn. & Kelloway.  1995: Nye &  Witt.  1993: Orpen.  1994: 

Randall.  Cropanzano.  Borman. &  Birjulin.  1998:  Settoon. Bennett &  Liden.  1996:  Shore 

& Tetrick.  1991:  Wayne et al..  1997).

In contrast to strong evidence o f relationships with w ork attitudes, mixed results 

have been  found  for the relationship between POS  and actual  in-role job performance.

POS was  found to be positively related to performance  for a sample consisting o f six 

different occupations ( r = .33:  Eisenberger et al..  1990).  However, when examined in a 

multivariate,  structural equation  framework.  POS  has not emerged as a significant

16

predictor o f employee performance. Settoon et al. (1996) found a non-significant path 

between POS and in-role behavior for a sample o f non-supervisorv hospital employees. 

Likewise.  Wayne et al. (1997) found a significant positive univariate correlation between 

POS  and performance ratings (r=.36): however, when tested with a structural equation 

model  including additional performance antecedents.  POS had a nonsignificant 

relationship with performance ratings.  Both the Settoon et al. and the Wayne et al. 

studies involved two sources of support: that from the supervisor (leader-member 

exchange.  LMX) and that from the organization (POS).  It may be that although POS  is 

significantly correlated with in-role performance,  it shares substantial variance with 

LMX.  thus, making it difficult to  find significant effects for POS when  LMX is also  in 

the model.  This explanation makes conceptual sense as supervisors are often key 

communicators o f supportive organizational  practices.  Nevertheless, given that some 

work shows  POS  to be positively related to  in-role performance, it is still  important to 

understand why high POS relates to better performance.

Operationalization of POS Effects as  Exchange Ideology  Interaction 

As mentioned above, the primary mechanism o f POS was theorized to be social 

exchanges between the employee and the organization. As an initial  test o f this 

mechanism.  Eisenberger et al. (1986) investigated the moderating influence of exchange 

ideology on the relationship between POS and organizational attitudes and behavior. 

Exchange ideology  is the general belief that effort should be extended in exchange for 

benefits and rewards. Thus, if social exchanges link POS with organizational attitudes.

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


17

the  POS-attitude relationship should be substantially stronger for those employees who 

endorse an exchange ideology than for those employees who do not.

Some support for the moderating influence o f exchange ideology has been  found. 

For example, exchange ideology moderated the relationship between POS and 

absenteeism (Eisenberger et al..  1990) and jo b performance (Orpen.  1994).  However, to 

date research has not directly examined the relationship between  POS and an  increased 

sense o f personal obligation to repay the organization for rewards actually received. 

Employee sense o f obligation is the belief that one is personally indebted to the 

organization because one has benefitted from the organization.  Exchange ideology, on 

the other hand,  is the belief that people in general should repay the organization  for 

rewards received.  While these two constructs are likely correlated, they are logically 

distinct.  For example, one can have the general  belief that the organization should be 

repaid  for its support, but because he or she has not personally received support, does not 

feel  personally obligated.

Proposal of Mediating Effects o f Obligation 

Based on prior theory and research,  it was hypothesized that POS  increases one's 

personal  sense of obligation to the organization.

H I:  There will be a positive relationship between perceived organizational 

support and employee sense of obligation to the organization.

Additionally, the relationship between POS and an employee's sense of obligation w ill be 

greater to the extent that the individual holds a strong exchange ideology.  In other words, 

individuals who strongly endorse an exchange ideology should be more likely to feel a

high degree o f personal obligation when the organization is perceived as supportive.

18

Thus.

H2:  Exchange ideology will moderate the relationship between perceived 

organizational support and employee sense o f obligation.  There will be a stronger 

positive relationship between perceived organizational support and employee 

sense o f obligation when exchange ideology  is high.

Additionally,  based on Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) theory, obligation resulting 

from social exchanges drive the relationship between perceptions o f support and 

employee attitudes and behavior.  Thus.

H3:  Employee sense o f obligation will partially  mediate the relationship between 

perceived organizational  support and organizational attitudes and behavior.

This general  proposal  implies the test of more specific hypothesized indirect relationships 

one  for each o f the five specific attitudinal or performance outcomes:

H3a:  There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and affective commitment mediated by employee sense o f 

obligation.

H3b:  There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and continuance commitment mediated by employee sense 

o f obligation.

H3c:  There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and normative commitment mediated by employee sense o f 

obligation.

obligation.

o f obligation.

Deficiencies of a Pure Social  Exchange Explanation 

Thus, the primary mechanism explaining the POS-attitude/behavior relationship 

investigated  to date has been employees'  perceived need to reciprocate benefits received. 

However, there are two problematic  issues associated with explaining attitudes and 

behavior purely  from the social exchange perspective.

First, theories o f social exchange do not completely explain why employees would 

exert additional effort on behalf of the organization (e.g.. organizational citizenship 

behaviors) when such efforts exceed what is required to “repay7' the organization. 

Eisenberger et al.  (1990) examined the relationship between POS and employee voluntary 

suggestions  for improvement o f the organization.  They  found that support perceptions 

w ere  positively  related to prosocial suggestions despite the absence o f explicit, direct 

rew ards.  They  suggested that POS creates a sense of trust in the organization and the 

belief that prosocial actions would eventually be rewarded, as evidenced by positive 

relationships between POS and expectations for recognition and monetary benefit.  This 

rationale does seem reasonable, especially  in light o f McNeely and  M eglino's (1994) 

findings that perceptions of reward equity and recognition explained significant variance

20

in prosocial behavior directed at organizations whereas empathy and concern explained 

variance in prosocial behavior directed at individuals.

Nevertheless, studies on groups and social behavior have  found that under 

conditions of social dilemmas, when individuals identify with the group, they will act 

toward the group's  welfare despite lowered personal gain (Dawes. Van de Kragt. & 

Orbell.  1990;  Kramer &  Brewer.  1984).  Thus, individuals under certain conditions may 

exert extra effort toward organizational goals even when personal  recognition and 

monetary rewards are not expected.  Although citizenship behaviors are not included in 

the present study, a finding that self-structures (i.e.. the extent to which the organization 

is  incorporated into the self-concept) mediate the effects of POS offers a potentially much 

richer explanation  for whv POS has been found to relate to citizenship and other 

organizational behaviors  in prior research.  Thus, there is a need to  move beyond 

exchange processes to  fully understand the motivations behind employee behavior.

Second.  POS  has demonstrated positive relationships with employee behaviors 

that do not directly  benefit the organization and thus do not appear to be pan of an 

exchange relationship.  For example. POS  has been found to correlate positively with job 

satisfaction and negatively with work stress.  Social exchange theory does not readily 

explain why  these variables should relate to employee perceptions o f organizational 

support.  However, a potential alternative explanation is that organizational support alters 

the employ ee's self-esteem and self-definition.  The employee will then produce 

beneficial attitudes and behaviors because o f two self-related processes: (1) the desire to 

maintain a consistent view o f the self and (2) to benefit the collective organization which

21

composes part o f the self-concept.  In other words, attitudes and  behavior are not 

"repayments." but instead are contributions to the organization's well-being which 

simultaneously benefit the personal well-being. This approach relies on employee 

motivations  for self-consistency and group welfare to explain POS-outcome relationships.

Inclusion o f self-structures as a mediator through which support influences 

attitudes and behavior represents an important advance in our understanding o f social 

support.  First, self-structures can explain the consistency in attitudes and behavior 

despite fluctuations  in perceived support over time.  Second,  inclusion o f self-structures 

can explain why  some attitudes and behavior not implicated by a social exchange 

mechanism may be influenced  by perceptions of support.  Finally, this line o f research 

argues that the POS has benefits for the employee in terms o f esteem  and positively 

valued self-concept.

Substantial  literature suggests that employees will adopt attitudes supporting 

current notions o f the self (Korman.  1970:  1971;  1976).  Perceptions o f support may 

impact self-esteem and self-concept.  Organizationally-relevant attitudes and behaviors 

may then be altered through motivations to maintain a consistent view o f the self.  Thus, 

employees with positive views of themselves at work (i.e.. high self-esteem at work) w ill 

likely be highly committed, satisfied, and involved in their organizations. Additionally, if 

self-identity  is tied to  the organization, employees will also alter beliefs to create attitudes 

consistent with the self.

Self-Structures

22

Although various structures and configurations o f the self have been proposed 

(cf..  Banaji &  Prentice.  1994;  Markus & Wurf.  1987). two broad themes have emerged 

from the  literature.  It is well-established that the self contains an aspect referred to 

variously as the self-concept or self-identity.  The self-concept refers to knowledge about 

the self in terms of characteristics, traits, roles and group memberships.  Not only does 

the self include such descriptive information, but it also  includes cognitive and affective 

evaluations o f the worth o f the  self, commonly called self-esteem.  Thus, in the current 

study's exploration of the role o f self-identity in the relationship between organizational 

support and outcomes, it was important to include consideration o f both self-esteem and 

self-concept.

Additionally, while effort has previously been directed toward the study o f global 

aspects o f the self (e.g.. global  self-esteem. Rosenberg.  1965). consensus is moving 

toward the  idea of the self as multifaceted,  fluid, and situationally determined (Markus & 

W urf.  1987).  Various dimensions o f the self have been proposed: the  ideal self, the 

actual  self,  individual identity,  relational identity and collective  identity (Brewer & 

Gardner.  1996:  Higgins.  1989:  Triandis.  1989).  Accordingly, the particular aspect o f the 

self which becomes salient at any specific moment depends on the accessibility o f the 

com ponent in memory and the  fit o f the component to environmental  stimuli (Hogg & 

Turner.  1987: Oakes. Turner. &  Haslam.  1991).

There are two important implications o f the idea o f a multifaceted self for the 

current discussion.  First, while the self-at-work is only one potential component

R e p ro d u c e d   with  perm ission  of th e  copyright  ow ner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited without  perm ission.


comprising the self, as the organization becomes a positively valued social group in one's 

life,  it becomes more likely that the self will be identified and evaluated in terms of the 

organizational context.  Second, the manner in which the work environment impacts the 

self-structures will depend, in part, on the way in which the self is already chronically 

construed.  Thus,  if the individual has a tendency to define and evaluate the self in terms 

of collective  memberships, a supportive work environment may  induce the individual to 

define him or herself in terms o f organizational membership.  If instead the self is defined 

at an interpersonal or dyadic level, role performance will become more important, and the 

individual will value information conveying successful  in-role performance which 

communicates one's worth within the organization.  However,  if the  individual  tends to 

define and evaluate the self in terms o f individual characteristics, there will  be a tendency 

to emphasize exchange relationships and  fulfillment of personal obligations to the 

organization.

The next three sections will examine the self-structures specific to organizational 

settings.  In particular it will  be argued that the knowledge and evaluation components o f 

the self are  influenced in part by the treatment the individual receives  from the 

organization.

Organization-Based Self-Esteem 

Definition o f Organization-Based Self-Esteem

In their seminal article.  Pierce. Gardner. Cummings, and  Dunham (1989) 

dev eloped the construct of organization-based self-esteem (OBSE).  OBSE is defined as 

the degree to  which employees perceive themselves as important, meaningful, effectual.

R e p ro d u c e d   with  perm ission  of th e  copyright  ow ner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited without  perm ission.


24
and worthwhile within their employing organization (Pierce et al..  1989).  In other words. 

OBSE  is perceived worth as communicated by the organization.

According to Pierce et al. (1989). OBSE develops within the social context o f the 

organization.  They suggested that OBSE develops as a result o f messages  from others in 

the organization regarding the competence of the employee.  As such. OBSE should 

increase in situations where supervisors provide challenge and praise, where the 

organizational  structure allows employee control, and where the job  itself is complex. 

Each of these antecedents suggests that the employee is capable and does not need 

external guidance in order to perform effectively.

Although no work has investigated antecedents of OBSE  in a longitudinal design, 

several theoretical antecedents have shown significant relationships with OBSE.  For 

example. OBSE has been shown to correlate with general self-esteem (Hall.  Matheson. 

Stems. &  Phillips,  in review;  Pierce et al..  1989; Tang & Gilbert.  1994). job complexity, 

and  managerial respect (Pierce et al..  1989).  Additionally.  Pierce et al.  (1993) found a 

relationship between working conditions and OBSE. when working conditions were 

defined  in terms of role ambiguity, role overload, role conflict, environmental support and 

supervisory support.  Working conditions thus defined are either direct  forms of 

organizational support (i.e.. environmental and supervisory) or are proxies o f support in 

that they demonstrate the organization's appreciation of the employee and concern  for the 

employee's well-being.  Therefore, there are empirically-based reasons to suspect 

perceptions o f support to be linked to higher levels o f OBSE.

Effects o f OBSE on Employee Attitudes and Behavior

According to Pierce et al. (1989). there should be a relationship between OBSE 

and organizational attitudes based on self-consistency mechanisms.  The employee,  in 

order to maintain a consistent view o f the self, will adopt attitudes and behavior that 

affirm their perceptions o f worth within their organizational roles.  In support o f this 

mechanism. OBSE has demonstrated positive relationships with measures o f intrinsic 

motivation, organization citizenship behaviors, jo b  and career satisfaction, organizational 

commitment, turnover intentions, and job performance (Aryee &  Luk.  1996: Carson. 

Carson.  Lanford. &  Roe.  1997: Gardner & Pierce.  1998: Hall et al.. in review:  Pierce et 

al..  1989: Tang & Gilbert.  1994).  Negative relationships have been  found between OBSE 

and turnover intentions (Carson et al..  1997:  Hall et al..  in review) and role ambiguity, 

role conflict, and role overload (Pierce et al..  1993).

Proposal  o f Mediating Effects o f OBSE

In summary. OBSE develops from situations where the organization provides 

messages, opportunities, or structural arrangements that communicate the employee's 

competence and worth.  An increased sense o f self-worth alters employee attitudes and 

behavior to create consistency with high self-valuation.  It is important to note that the 

situations  likely to increase OBSE are also those deemed likely under conditions of high 

perceived organizational support. Thus it is hypothesized that to the extent that the 

employee perceives the organization to care about one's well-being and to  value one's 

contributions, the employee will  be more likely to  increase his or her perceptions o f worth 

within the organization.

26

H4: There will be a positive relationship between perceived organizational 

support and organization-based self-esteem.

Further,  it is argued that individuals will be motivated to maintain a stable 

conceptualization o f the self (Korman.  1976:  Swann.  1987).  Thus, individuals will adopt 

attitudes consistent with evaluations o f self-worth.  As such OBSE was hypothesized to 

mediate the relationship between POS and organizational attitudes based on a motivation 

for self-consistency.

H5:  Organization-based self-esteem will  partially mediate the relationship 

between perceived organizational support and organizational attitudes and 

behavior.

Five more specific hypothesized indirect relationships are proposed in regard to this 

broad proposal:

H5a:There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and affective commitment mediated by organization-based 

self-esteem.

H5b:  There will  be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and continuance commitment mediated by organization- 

based self-esteem.

H5c:  There will  be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and normative commitment mediated by organization- 

based self-esteem.

self-esteem.

H5e:  There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and in-role job performance mediated by organization- 

based self-esteem.

Organization-Based Self-Concept 

While discussed under a variety o f names (e.g.. self-concept, self-identity, self- 

definition: c.f..  Banaji & Prentice.  1994:  Markus &  Wurf.  1987: Tajfel.  1982). the self- 

concept has generally been understood to contain the traits, characteristics, roles and 

groups used  to describe the self. Additionally, the self-concept has been thought to  be 

hierarchical and multifaceted.  Thus it may be  inappropriate to discuss the self-concept, 

rather it may be necessary to distinguish between various domains o f the self (e.g.. the 

self at school, at home, or at work).  Increasingly research has investigated the wide 

variety of self-concepts that exist.  Likewise, the current research will  focus on one 

narrow domain - the self-concept derived from membership in an organization.

The definition o f the self developed through inclusion o f the organization into the 

self-concept was termed organizational identification by Ashforth and Mael (1989). 

However, as they noted, their terminology may cause confusion due to its similarity with 

other constructs (e.g.. work centrality, internalization, and affective commitment).  As 

such, the term "organization-based self-concepf' is used to indicate that aspect of the self 

derived  from  membership within the organization.

The role that the organization plays in self-definition will be discussed in the  next 

two sections.  First, the inclusion of general  social categories into the self-concept will be 

discussed  under the heading o f social identity theory.  Then, the organization as a specific 

social group  will  be addressed along with Ashforth and M aefs (1989) theory of 

organizational  identification.

Social  Identity  Theory

Social  identity theory and categorization theory' (Tajfel.  1982: Tajfel & Turner. 

1986)  contend that the self-concept is composed o f personal and social  identities. 

Personal identity refers to the definition o f the self in terms of unique  individual 

characteristics and traits.  Social  identity', on the other hand, is that aspect o f the self- 

concept based on knowledge o f the self in terms o f membership in social groups along 

with the value and emotional  significance o f that membership (Tajfel.  1981).  The 

literature on social  identity suggests that categorizations o f the self are arranged 

hierarchically, and the identity' activated at any particular moment depends on which 

identity  is  most pertinent to the situation.  This activated identity consequently  influences 

cognition, affect, and behavior (Banaji &  Prentice.  1994).

Self-Categorization.  Individuals transform social categories  into  internal  self­

definitions through the cognitive process of self-categorization (Hogg & Turner.  1987). 

Defining the self in terms o f group membership is theorized to serve the needs  for esteem 

and belonging,  and to  facilitate social understanding.  As such,  incorporation o f social 

groups  into the self-concept is more likely to the extent that the group  is perceived as 

unique and prestigious (Ashforth & Mael.  1989) and allows favorable comparison

29

between one's own group and other out-groups.  Self-categorization is by necessity a 

comparison process operating by a metacontrast principle (Turner. Oakes.  Haslam. & 

McGarty.  1994).  The metacontrast principle implies that individuals will classify 

themselves as members  o f a group to the extent that the self is seen as sim ilar to that 

group and as different from other competing social groups.

An important aspect of self-categorization is that the individual will define the 

self using the attributes  deemed most characteristic, or prototypical, of the group as a 

whole.  Proponents o f self-categorization contend that the self is seen as congruent with 

the social  category'.  In other words, the self and the social group are categorized into a 

single cognitive structure (Hogg & Turner.  1987).  Recent research using reaction time 

methodology has supported the idea o f the self and social group as a unitary  structure. 

Reaction time research has consistently found that individuals are quicker to  respond to 

information that is consistent with the self.  Thus, if there is congruence between the self 

and an  intimate other on a trait, there should be facilitation o f reaction time when 

responding to whether o r not a trait is self-descriptive.  However,  if there is an 

incongruence between self and other on a trait (i.e.. the characteristic describes the self 

but not the other),  reaction times should be inhibited.  Aron. Aron. Tudor, and Nelson

(1991)  conducted a study in which ten couples rated the extent to which trait adjectives 

described themselves, their spouse, and a famous personality.  Later, participants made 

yes/no reaction time decisions regarding the extent to which the same traits again 

described themselves.  These authors hypothesized that to the extent there was a match  in 

descriptiveness o f the trait for the self and the spouse, reaction times should be facilitated:

30
however, a match between the self and the famous other should not impact reaction times. 

In other words, to the extent that there is inclusion o f the other in the self, people should 

be quicker to respond to the descriptiveness o f the trait.  Results supported their 

hypotheses.  Likewise. Smith and Henry (1996). using the same methodology,  found that 

reaction times were facilitated when there was a match between traits descriptive of the 

self and one's  in-group but were unaffected by similarities to an out-group.

As a result o f self-categorization, the individual will view the self as an 

interchangeable m em ber o f the social category', what Turner et al. (1994) termed 

depersonalization.  According to Turner et al. (1994). depersonalization  is a factor in 

group processes.  W hen the individual  incorporates group membership into the self- 

concept. behaviors and attitudes directed toward the group's welfare also benefit the self. 

Consequently,  self-categorization has been used to explain various group behaviors such 

as cooperation,  in-group cohesion, intergroup competition,  norm  formation, stereotyping, 

and group polarization (Banaji & Prentice.  1992:  Hogg & Turner.  1987:  Kramer.  1991: 

Mael & Ashforth.  1992:  McGartv. Turner.  Hogg. David. &  Wetherall.  1992). 

Additionally, self-categorization may impact individual behavior and attitudes such as 

self-enhancement and self-maintenance behavior, physical health, self-stereotyping, and 

perceptions o f justice and entitlement (Hogg & Turner.  1987: James.  Lovato. &  Khoo. 

1994: Lansberg.  1989).  It is important to note again that these effects occur because the 

individual  is acting not towards self-benefit,  but is acting instead toward the benefit of the 

group.

Organizational  Identification

Ashforth and Mael (1989) developed a theory of organizational  internalization 

based on social  identity theory  in which employees come to define the self as 

incorporating organizational  membership.  Much like other social groups, the 

organization may provide members with a source o f meaning, esteem and connectedness. 

As with social  identity theory, organizational  identification predicts that to the extent that 

members identify with their organization, they will perceive themselves as possessing the 

prototypical characteristics o f the group and will view themselves as being 

interchangeable members o f the organization (i.e.. depersonalization).

Antecedents and Consequences o f Organizational Identification.  Several 

antecedents of organizational  identification were proposed in Ashforth and M ael's (1989) 

original  work.  First,  identification was theorized to increase as the organization became 

more distinctive.  Distinctiveness occurs when the organization is easily distinguishable 

from outside organizations (for example, through unique product lines, mission 

statements, community  focus, etc.).  Also, the prestige o f the group  is important  for 

positive identification with the organization.  A third antecedent of identification is the 

saliency o f the out-group.  Saliencv o f the out-group may increase due to direct or indirect 

inter-group competition, threats to resources, or threats to the organizational  image.  Out­

group saliency may  lead in-group members to protect and bolster their own boundaries 

and  identification.  For example. Elsbach and Kramer (1996) identified strategies used by 

MBA  faculty and students to protect and re-affirm their school  identity after receiving 

undesired ratings  from the Business Week poll.  These authors identified several strategies

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


to reaffirm o n e's school identity, including the tendency to highlight valued aspects ot the 

identity  not  included in a Business  Week review.  Although not specifically addressed in 

their study, these results demonstrate an instance in which the out-group (other MBA 

programs)  is made salient, and in-group members react by more clearly defining and 

asserting their collective self-concept.  Finally. Ashforth and  Mael (1989) suggested that 

identification with the organization will occur through traditional  group  formation 

processes (e.g.. similarity, liking, proximity).

Mael and Ashforth (1992) conducted a partial test o f the model o f organizational 

identification  for alumni  from an all-male religious university.  They tested a model  in 

w hich hypothesized antecedents o f identification were the distinctiveness and prestige o f 

the university,  inter- and  intra-university competition,  length o f attendance, recency o f 

membership,  number o f comparable schools attended, presence o f a mentor, satisfaction 

with the university contribution to personal goals, and sentimentality.  Identification with 

the university  w as theorized to  lead to activities which sustained the vitality of the school.

Using a six-item measure o f identification. Mael and Ashforth (1992) found that 

identification was associated with all of the antecedents except inter-university 

competition, attendance at other universities, recency o f attendance, and experience with 

a mentor.  Identification was  found to relate to support for the school  in terms of 

monetary contributions and recruitment of offspring.  Further, identification partially 

mediated the relationship between the antecedents and support for the university.

Two  o f the antecedents tested by Mael and Ashforth (1992) - mentoring and 

satisfaction w ith the university's contribution to personal goals - are especially interesting

R e p ro d u c e d   with  perm ission  of th e  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited without  perm ission.


because these are two variables that may increase perceptions o f support from the 

organization.  In other words, the advice and guidance of a mentor and the belief that the 

university has assisted in the student's achievement should logically  increase the belief 

that the university is committed to the student.  While satisfaction em erged as a 

significant correlate o f identification, mentoring did not.  The reason  for the non­

significant relationship o f mentoring may be due to the nature o f university  life as 

compared to organizations.  In organizations,  mentoring relationships generally have the 

goal  o f socializing the employee to the organization and providing "groom ing" 

opportunities, in essence tying the em ployee's self-concept to that specific organization.

In universities, on the other hand, mentoring relationships are more often aimed at 

acclimating the student to a field o f study rather than the university  specifically.  Mentors 

within organizations may bind the employee to the organization as an institution, thus 

increasing identification, while university mentors may increase  identification with a 

professional  field outside o f the institution.  Thus, mentoring, as well  as other variables 

indicating the organization's commitment,  may still  be an important antecedent of 

identification in organizational settings.

Proposal o f the Mediating  Effects o f Organization-Based Self-Concept

Based on the preceding literature,  it was hypothesized that when employees 

perceive the organization to care for one's well-being and to value o n e's contributions, 

the employee will  incorporate the organization into his or her self-concept.

H6:  There will  be a positive significant relationship between perceived 

organizational support and organization-based self-concept.

34

Further, as was argued in prior sections,  individuals will be motivated to adopt 

attitudes that allow self-consistency (Korman.  1976; Swann.  1987) and protect group 

welfare (Ashforth & M ae l.  1989).  As such, organization-based self-concept should 

partially mediate the relationship between POS and organizational attitudes on the basis 

o f motivations  for self-consistency and group welfare.

H7: Organization-based self-concept will partially mediate the relationship 

between perceived organizational support and organizational attitudes and 

behavior.

Again,  five specific  indirect relationships between POS and organizational attitudes and 

behavior are expected in regard to the above general  hypothesis.

H7a: There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational  support and affective commitment mediated by organization-based 

self-concept.

H7b: There will  be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational  support and continuance commitment mediated by organization- 

based self-concept.

H7c: There will be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and normative commitment mediated by organization- 

based self-concept.

H7d: There will be a significant negative relationship between perceived 

organizational support and turnover intentions mediated by organization-based 

self-concept.

H7e: There will  be a significant positive relationship between perceived 

organizational support and in-role job performance mediated by organization- 

based self-concept.

Levels of Self-Representation 

The previous sections argued for the presence o f three mediators o f the  POS- 

attitude relationship: a sense o f obligation based on social exchange principles, 

organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) based on a motivation for self-consistency, and 

organization-based self-concept based on the motivation for self-consistency and group 

welfare.  The purpose o f the present section is to review the literature on levels o f self­

representation and to explore the role that levels o f self play in determining which o f the 

three mediators will be most important for any particular individual.

The self-concept has generally been recognized as including both personal and 

social  identities (Banaji &  Prentice.  1994: Greenwald & Pratkanis.  1984:  Markus & 

Kityama.  1991: Triandis.  1989).  The personal self is defined as the self as differentiated 

from others, emphasizing unique qualities, traits and personal goals (Triandis.  1989: 

Banaji &  Prentice.  1994).  The social  levels o f identity, on the other hand, define the self 

in terms of membership  in groups and interpersonal  relationships (Banaji &  Prentice. 

1994:  Brewer & Gardner.  1996: Turner etal..  1994).  The relative emphasis on  individual 

versus social  identities has been found to influence not only self-definitions,  but also 

sources of self-worth and social motivation (c.fi.  Brewer & Gardner.  1996:  Markus & 

Kitayama.  1994).

Definition of Three Levels o f Self

Recently. Brewer and Gardner (1996) proposed a theory which differentiates three 

levels o f self construal:  the individual, the interpersonal, and the collective level.  At the 

individual  level.  Brewer and Gardner (1996) suggested that one defines the self in terms 

o f traits that differentiate the self from others through interpersonal  comparison.  At this 

level, the  individual  is motivated to act in self-interested ways (e.g.. maximizing personal 

benefits,  biasing cognition to  favor the self. etc.).

At the interpersonal  level o f self-construal. the self-concept derives from 

interpersonal  relationships with specific others.  The relational  self is evaluated in terms 

o f roles, and self-evaluation derives from reflected appraisals, or self-relevant 

information, as conveyed by others (Brewer & Gardner.  1996).  For example. Baldwin. 

Carrell. and  Lopez (1990) subliminally primed  important relationships by exposing 

students to either an approving or disapproving picture of their advisor.  Students 

subsequently evaluated the quality o f their own research ideas.  Baldwin et al. (1990) 

found that students exposed to the approving stimulus evaluated their ideas more 

positively, while those exposed to the disapproving stimulus evaluated their own ideas 

more harshly.  These results suggest the importance of close interpersonal  relationships  in 

self-evaluations.

According to  Brewer and Gardner (1996). at the group level, collective  identities 

occur when one identifies with the social group and defines the self in terms o f the group 

prototype.  Intergroup comparisons are an important source o f self-worth at the group

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


37

level.  Further,  individuals emphasizing their collective identities are theorized to place 

primary emphasis on the group's well-being, even at the expense o f personal goals. 

Stability  Versus Context-Specific Nature o f Levels o f Self

While there is general agreement that the self can be categorized at different levels 

w ith only one  level  salient at any particular moment (Markus &  Kunda.  1986:  Martindale. 

1980).  there  is less agreement on the factors which determine the  level  that is activated 

(Brewer & Gardner.  1996).  According to social  identity theory, the  level at which the self 

is defined depends on the environmental context.  For example. Turner et al.  (1994) 

found that altering the sex composition o f groups influenced the saliencv o f one's gender 

impacting the  tendency to categorize the self in terms o f gender membership.  Thus, the 

level at which the self is defined depends on whether the environment emphasizes one's 

personal  qualities or social group membership.

Other theories emphasize the stability o f self-representations, suggesting that one 

level  is dominant over others and more  likely to be accessed in self-definitions.  For 

example. Trafimow. Triandis. and Goto (1991)  found that cultural  background influenced 

the tendency to activate either the personal or the collective levels o f the self.  They  found 

that  individuals  from  Western backgrounds tended to retrieve private,  individualistic self­

cognitions. suggesting the primacy o f the personal  level.  Individuals  from collectivistic 

cultures,  in contrast, tended to retrieve collective self-cognitions, suggesting the 

dominance o f the group level  in self-construal.  However. Trafimow et al. (1991. 

experiment 2) also  found that regardless o f cultural  background,  priming either the 

personal or group level  influenced the types o f self-cognition retrieved.  Based on these

38

findings, they suggested that private and collective selves are organized as separate 

cognitive structures and that while one category is dominant, the particular level at which 

the self is defined depends on contextual stimuli.

Several organizational theories have suggested ways in which organizational 

actions may  impact the level at which the self is defined.  For example. Tyler and Lind's

(1992)  relational  model o f justice proposed that one will  perceive a decision to  be  fair 

when the decision-maker acts with neutrality and treats the individual with dignity and 

respect.  As such, the decision-maker may be activating the relational self.  Likewise. 

Shamir.  House, and Arthur (1993) proposed a theory o f charismatic  leadership suggesting 

that leaders may activate followers' collective self-concepts through various methods 

(e.g.. glorifying achievements, vision statements, common  fate. etc.).  Thus it is  likely 

that organizations are able to modify the level at which employees define the self.  It will 

not be argued here that organizations lack control over the  level o f self-construal. 

nevertheless, it is likely that there will be variation, over time and across individuals,  in 

the  level at which the self is defined.  In the current study, the level at which the self is 

most typically defined will  be assessed, cutting across time and situations.  In other 

words.  level  is being assessed as a general trait-like cognitive tendency while still 

recognizing the potential  for the environmental context to alter the current level o f self- 

construal.

Proposal  o f the Moderating Effects o f Level o f Self

The hypothesized model argues that the level at which the self is currently- 

defined.  be  it a result o f cultural differences or context-dependent, determines the

mechanism through which perceptions o f support influence organizational attitudes.

39

Thus.

H8:  Level o f self-construal moderates the relationship between POS and the three 

mediating mechanisms.

First, when the individual  level self-construal  is dominant, the individual will 

primarily be concerned with personal  interests (Brewer & Gardner.  1996) and 

maintaining a balance between contributions to the organization and benefits from the 

organization (Blau.  1964).  Thus when the individual  believes the organization has 

demonstrated concern for the em ployee's well-being, the employee will  feel obligated to 

repay the organization (Eisenberger. et al.  1986). and this relationship will be stronger to 

the extent that the self is defined at the individual  level.

H8a:  Individual  level self-construal moderates the relationship between perceived 

organizational support and employee sense o f obligation.  There will be a stronger 

positive relationship between perceived organizational support and employee 

sense o f obligation when the self is defined at the individual  level.

When  the relational self is dominant, the self will be defined and evaluated  in 

terms o f roles and reflected appraisals (Brewer & Gardner.  1996).  Thus, the individual 

defining the self at the relational level will  be more sensitive to messages that 

communicate  his or her worth within an organizational  role (i.e.. OBSE:  Pierce et al.. 

1989).  Earlier it was proposed that perceptions o f support are one type o f message 

communicating the employee's worth, here it is suggested that the relationship between

POS  and OBSE will  be  stronger to the extent that the self is defined at the relational  level. 

H8b:  Relational  level self-construal moderates the relationship between perceived 

40

organizational support and organization-based self-esteem.  There will be a 

stronger positive relationship between perceived organizational support and 

organization-based self-esteem when the self is defined at the relational  level. 

Finally, when the dominant tendency  is to define the self at the collective level, 

the individual  will tend  to emphasize group memberships and define the self in terms o f 

group prototypes (B rew er & Gardner.  1996).  As was discussed earlier, the organization 

represents one social  group with which individuals may  identify- (Ashforth &  Mael.

1989).  The employee,  then,  would define the self in terms most prototypical o f the group. 

It was previously proposed that POS  is one potential antecedent o f the tendency to define 

the self in terms o f the organization.  Here  it is hypothesized that the relationship between 

POS  and organization-based self-concept will be stronger to the extent that the self is 

defined at the collective  level.

H8c:  Collective  level self-construal  moderates the relationship between perceived 

organizational support and organization-based self-concept.  There will  be a 

stronger positive relationship between perceived organizational support and 

organization-based self-concept when the self is defined at the collective level.

performance, and negatively related to turnover intentions as mediated by three processes: 

(1) the em ployee's sense o f obligation to repay the organization: (2) organization-based 

self-esteem:  and (3) organization-based self-concept.  Moreover, the path which provides 

the strongest mediating relationship depends on which level o f self-construal  is dominant. 

When the self is defined at the individual  level, employee sense o f obligation should be 

the strongest mediator.  When the self is defined at the relational  level. OBSE should 

emerge as the dominant mediating path.  Finally, when the self is defined at the collective 

level, organization-based self-concept should be the strongest mediator. The model  was 

tested  in two studies. Study  1  and Study 2 (a replication and extension study), described 

in more detail  below.

Study  1  was conducted using employed university students. This was conducted in 

order to  investigate the psychometric properties of several questionnaires, some o f which 

were newly developed,  and to test the hypothesized model.  Specifically, two measures 

were developed by the author for use in the Study 1  and Study 2: the Employee Sense of 

Obligation measure (i.e.. the extent to which the individual  feels personally indebted to 

the organization because he or she has received various benefits and rewards) and the 

Adjective Overlap scale (i.e.. the extent to which the self is described as possessing the 

most prototypical  characteristics o f the employing organization).  Also, as discussed  in 

more detail  in Chapter 3. the survey o f perceived organizational  support (SPOS) may or 

may  not represent a unidimensional construct.  If the factor structure of this measure is 

indeed unidimensional, a subset o f  the highest loading items could be selected  from the 

scale  for use  with the full-time employed sample in Study 2.  However, before this step

could be taken, the structure o f the  full SPOS needed to be assessed via exploratory and 

confirmatory  factor analysis.  Likewise. Study  1  allowed several o f the other longer 

measures to  be shortened for use  in the replication study (e.g.. sense o f obligation and 

affective commitment). Additionally, the data from Study  1  allowed tests o f the 

distinctiveness o f other measures o f the model constructs,  using confirmatory  factor 

analytic techniques.

Study  2 used data from  full  time employees in an emergency-response 

organization in a replication and extension o f Study  1.  Employees were asked to 

complete shortened versions o f the measures used in Study  1.  The direct supervisor o f 

respondents were also asked to rate the in-role performance o f their subordinates.  All 

hypotheses are  listed in Table  1.

METHODS 

Participants and Procedures 

Studv  1

This study was conducted to provide a check o f the measures and to  prov ide  tests 

of the hypotheses.  Surveys were distributed to 400 students drawn from introductory' and 

upper level  psychology courses at a Midwestern university.  All participants had to be 

currently employed for 20 or more hours per week in order to qualify for inclusion  in the 

study.  A total o f 308 (77%) o f the surveys were returned.  However, a number o f the 

returned surveys were unuseable:  53  cases were dropped due to  incomplete data on one or 

more scales or careless responding on the Twenty Statements Test combined with 

incomplete data on one or more other scales. 29 were dropped because the respondent 

reported working more than one job or worked fewer than 20 hours a week, and  16 cases 

w ere elim inated due to extreme scores identified by outlier analyses on one or more 

scales.  This left a final sample size o f 210.  Due to the large mortality rate, care was taken 

to ensure that results held with and without the inclusion o f the dropped cases.

Correlation matrices and means were examined to determine if there were differences due 

to  inclusion or exclusion o f the identified cases.  In no  instance did the exclusion o f the 

dropped cases cause a substantive difference in the conclusions drawn  from the study.

A replication and extension study was conducted with full-time employees and 

their direct supervisors.  Surveys were distributed to 580 emergency  medical technicians 

and paramedic employees working at three locations o f a nationwide emergency response 

organization.  Follow-up reminders and duplicate surveys were sent to non-respondents at 

one and two months after the  first survey distribution. A total of 74 (13%) o f the surv eys 

w ere returned.  Two cases were dropped due to missing data on one or more variables, 

leaving a final sample size o f 72 employees.  The direct superv isor o f each participant 

w as contacted and asked to complete a measure o f performance for each target employee. 

Completed surveys were received from 21  supervisors.

Measures

The target respondents in the two studies  first completed a demographics 

questionnaire, then the focal study measures in the  following order:  (1) Twenty 

Statements Test (Kuhn & M cPartland.  1954:  Study  1  only) or three measures o f the level 

o f self (Study 2 only): (2) the Survey o f Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS): (3) 

Exchange  Ideology: (4) Employee Sense o f Obligation: (5) Organization-Based  Self- 

Esteem  (OBSE): (6) measures o f organization-based self-concept [Organizational 

Identification and Adjective Overlap (Study  1  only)]: and (7) measures o f organizational 

attitudes (affective, continuance and normative commitment and turnover intentions).  In 

Study  2.  superv isors completed a measure o f in-role job performance.  Each o f these 

measures  is described in more detail in the  following paragraphs.  Copies of all  measures 

appear in Appendix A.

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


49
Perceived Organizational Support.  Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) 36-item Survey o f 

Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS) was used to measure employee perceptions o f 

support. The SPOS assesses perceptions o f being cared for and valued by the organization 

across a variety o f organizational situations (e.g.. "The organization values my 

contributions to  its well-being”, and "The organization cares about my general 

satisfaction at work”).  Responses were made on a 7-point Likert scale (1= strongly 

disagree:  7= strongly agree).

In previous research, the SPOS  has demonstrated high inter-item reliability (a = 

.97) and  items were  found to load primarily on one factor (Eisenberger et al..  1986).  A 

principal  com ponent factor analysis reported in Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) original study- 

found that one  factor accounted for 48.3  percent o f the total variance.  A minor second 

factor accounted  for 4.4 percent o f the total variance.  Varimax rotation with Kaiser 

normalization  found a two-factor solution with all  items  loading higher on the  first factor. 

However.  Eisenberger et al.'s principle components analysis relied solely on a varimax 

solution which maximizes the item loadings on the  first rotated  factor.  Such a solution 

may  hide sm aller but important factors, especially if the  factors are moderately to highly- 

correlated.  Moreover, no other research has investigated the full  36-item scale.  Thus, the 

full  scale was used in the Study  1  and the factor structure investigated in a preliminary 

analysis with the goal of identifying a good, shorter unidimensional version of the SPOS.

Exchange Ideology. The extent to which employees believe that effort should be 

expended  in exchange  for rewards was assessed with Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) 5-item 

measure o f Exchange Ideology.  An example item  includes. "An employee who is treated

50
badly by the organization should lower his or her work effort."  All responses were given 

on a 7-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree:  7= strongly agree).  Eisenberger et al.

(1986)  found an acceptably high inter-item reliability for the Exchange Ideology measure 

(a  =  .80).

Employee  Sense o f Obligation.  A  10-item  scale was created to measure the extent 

to which the employee personally  feels indebted to the organization because o f benefits 

received (e.g.. ”1  feel a sense of obligation to repay the organization because o f pay 

increases I  have received").  All responses were given on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = 

strongly disagree:  7= strongly agree).

Organization-Based Self-Esteem.  Pierce et al.'s (1989)  10-item measure o f OBSE 

was used to assess the extent to which employees believe they are valued within the 

organizational context.  The OBSE items measure the extent to which the employee feels 

competent and  important (e.g.. *T count around here") within the work setting. 

Respondents  indicated their agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = 

strongly disagree:  7 -  strongly agree).  The scale has demonstrated a high inter-item 

reliability (a =  .91) and has a test-retest reliability o f r = .75  (Pierce et al..  1989).

Organization-Based Self-Concept.  The extent to which the employee has 

incorporated organizational  membership into his or her own self-concept was assessed  in 

two ways.  First. Mael and Tetrick's (1992) ten-item Identification with a Psychological 

Group Scale was modified to reflect identification with the organization.  An example 

item  is "When  I  talk about this organization.  I  usually say  •we'  rather than  •they'."  The 

measure was  found to contain two components,  perceived Shared Experiences and

R e p ro d u c e d  with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  F urther reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


51
perceived Shared Characteristics, with coefficient alpha internal consistency estimates o f 

.81  and  .66. respectively.  Additionally.  Mael and Tetrick (1992) using confirmatory  factor 

analysis  found the identification measure to be distinct from affective commitment.

Second, when an employee incorporates the organization into his or her self- 

concept. the employee perceives the self as containing the characteristics prototypical of 

the group (Ashforth &  Mael.  1989).  Based on the literature, an Adjective Overlap Scale 

was created asking respondents to list ten characteristics most descriptive o f the typical 

organizational member.  Once the respondent generated ten characteristics, he or she then 

rated the extent to which the characteristics were self-descriptive.  Self-descriptiveness 

the ratings were made on  a 7-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree:  5= strongly agree).

Both the Adjective Overlap and the Identification with Psychological Groups 

questionnaires provided measures o f the theoretical  intent behind social  identity theory. 

However, the Identification measure is theoretically appropriate while being more concise 

and easier for participants to use.  Therefore, these two measures were both administered 

in  Study  1  and assessed  for psychometric convergence and redundancy.  However, as 

discussed  in Chapter IV.  Study 2 used only the Identification with Psychological Group 

Scale due to  its simplicity and ease of use.

Affective Com m itm ent. The extent to which respondents feel emotionally 

committed to the organization was assessed using  Meyer. Allen, and  Sm ith's (1993) six 

item Affective Commitment Scale (ACS).  The items (e.g.. "I do not feel a strong sense 

o f belonging to my organization'*, reverse scored) were rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 =

52
strongly disagree:  7= strongly agree).  M eyer et al. (1993) found coefficient alpha internal 

consistency estimates o f .86 (sample  1) and .87 (sample 2).

Continuance Commitment.  Continuance commitment was measured using Meyer 

et al.'s (1993) Continuance Commitment Scale (CCS).  Three  items o f the CCS reflect 

perceptions of the sacrifices associated with leaving the organization (e.g.. “Too much of 

my  life would be disrupted if I decided  I wanted to leave my organization now").  Three 

additional  items tap perceptions regarding the inability to leave the organization because 

o f a lack of alternatives (e.g.. "I  feel  I have too  few options to consider leaving the 

organization").  M cGee and Ford (1987) presented  factor analytic evidence for the 

dimensionality o f the original scale as well as inter-item reliability  for perceived personal 

sacrifice and perceived alternative subscales (a = .71  and .72. respectively).  Meyer et al.

(1993)  found an  inter-item reliability o f .64  for the full scale.

Normative Commitment. The extent to which the individual  feels tied to the 

organization because o f felt moral obligations was assessed using  M eyer et al.'s (1993) 

six  item Normative Commitment Scale.  All  items (e.g.. "I do not feel any  obligation to 

remain with my current employer" reverse coded) were rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 

= strongly disagree:  7 = strongly agree).  The measure has been found to have acceptable 

levels of internal consistency (a = .8: M eyer et al..  1993).

Turnover Intentions. Three items were used to assess participants'  intentions to 

leave the organization.  These items, taken  from the Michigan Organizational Assessment 

Questionnaire (Cammann,  Fichman. Jenkins & Klesh.  1983)  include. "I  will actively 

look for a new jo b   in the next year." "I often think about quitting." and 'T  will probably

look  for a new job in the next year/’  The items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale with

1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.  Klein (1987) reported an internal

consistency o f a = .91  for the measure.

Level o f Self-Representation. Two different measures were used to measure the

level of self-construal that differed by study.  In Study  1. a modified version o f the Twenty

Statements Test (TST:  Kuhn & McPartland.  1954) was used to measure the tendency to

categorize one's self at the individual, relational, or collective level. The original TST

involved providing 20 responses to the stem "I am...".  However, the "I am " stem may

unintentionally  prime the individual level o f self (Brewer & Gardner.  1996).  In order to

avoid the priming o f the individual self, the scale was modified by dropping the “I am"

stem and rewriting the instructions to read:

"There are twenty numbered blanks on the page below.  Please write twenty

statements about yourself in the blanks.  Just give twenty different statements

telling something about you.  Write the statements in the order that they occur to

you.  D on't worry about logic or 'importance.'  Go along fairly  fast."

Responses to the TST were coded into one o f the three categories using the

following criteria adapted from  Watkins.  Yau.  Dahlin. and Wondimu (1997):

Individualistic:  Statements about personal qualities, attitudes, beliefs, states, and 
traits that do not relate to other people.  For example. "I am honest". "I am 
intelligent", and "I am happy."
Relational:  Statements about a small, personal group or a relationship with a 
specific other.  For example. "I am a husband”. "I am a daughter”, and "I am on a 
basketball team."

Collective:  Statements about a large,  impersonal group, demographic 
characteristics and large groups that share a common fate.  Examples include "I 
am a girl” and "I am a student.”

Three scores were generated for each participant representing the proportion o f 

54

responses categorized as individual, relational and collective.

In Study 2. the individual, relational, and collective levels o f self-construal were 

assessed using a total o f nine items.  Three items taken  from Singelis'  (1994) eleven-item 

scale were used to measure the general tendency to define the self at the independent, or 

individual.  level o f self-construal.  Three additional  items taken from Cross.  Bacon, and 

Morris'  (2000) ten-item measure were used to measure the general tendency to define the 

self at the relational  level.  Finally, three items taken from Gabriele and Gardner's (1999) 

ten-item scale were used to measure the general tendency to define the self at the 

collective  level.  These items were chosen based on high factor loadings.  Gabriele and 

Gardner (1999)  found internal consistency reliability estimates (a) o f .69.  .90 and  .90  for 

the individual, relational and collective scales respectively.

D em ographics.  Data were collected on respondents'  age. race, gender, tenure with 

the organization and with current supervisor, years of education,  income and  industry  in 

which the participant is employed.  Occupation was measured by one item taken from the 

General  Social  Survey (Davis & Smith.  1996).  Finally, one open-ended  item measured 

participants'  career goals ("Describe your career goals.  For example, where do you see 

yourself in  five years or ten years from now").

Supervisor Scales.  In Study 2 supervisors responded to a three-item measure o f in­

role job  performance taken from  W illiams and Anderson's (1991) seven-item scale.  The 

seven-item scale had an internal consistency o f a = .91.  Three items were chosen from 

their measure that represented general evaluations o f performance. The items included.

'This employee adequately completes assigned duties”: “This employee performs tasks 

expected o f him  or her”: and "This em ployee meets formal performance requirements o f 

the job."  The em ployee's direct supervisor rated these items on a 7-point Likert scale (1 

55

= strongly disagree:  7 = strongly agree).

Analyses 

Preliminary Analyses

A series o f exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory  factor analyses 

(CFA) along with assessments o f internal consistency (a) examined the psychometric 

characteristics o f the measures.  First, a principal  factors  EFA analysis examined the 

dimensionality  o f the SPOS and the Em ployee Sense of Obligation.  Each o f these scales 

was expected to yield a unidimensional  factor structure.

Second.  EFA was used to create item parcels for the SPOS.  Employee Sense o f 

Obligation. OBSE.  Identification with  Psychological Groups, the Adjective Overlap. 

Affective Com m itm ent Scale, and the Continuance Commitment Scale.  The item parcels 

were used as  indicators o f their respective latent constructs in the SEM described below. 

The parcels were created by calculating the mean o f items with  high commonalities.

Tests o f Model  Fit

A series o f multiple regressions was used to assess the  moderated  relationships  in 

the hypothesized model.  Because o f the non-normality o f the independent variables, 

centered scores  were created for POS. exchange ideology and each o f the three levels o f 

self by subtracting the score from the mean o f the variables.  An  interaction term was then 

created by m ultiplying the centered POS  variable by the centered moderator variable.

5 6
The centered  POS and moderator variable were then entered into the regression equation 

followed by the multiplicative interaction term.  The b-weight o f the interaction term was 

then assessed to determine the significance o f the moderating relationship.

The m ediated relationship between POS and job performance was assessed using 

multiple regression.  Specifically. Baron &  Kenny's (1986) three-step regression model 

was used to assess the relationship between POS and job performance mediated by- 

employee sense o f obligation. OBSE.  and organization-based self-concept.  In the first 

step, the  independent variable must account for significant variance in the mediator.  The 

second step requires that the independent variable account for significant variance in the 

dependent variable.  Third, when entered into the regression equation together, the 

mediator and  the  independent variable must account for significant variance in the 

dependent variable.  Additionally, in order to prove complete mediation, the b-weight of 

the independent variable must be significant in the second step and must drop to non­

significance  in the second step.  If the  b-weight is significant in the second equation and 

appreciably decreases  in magnitude in the third equation, but does not become non­

significant. there  is evidence for partial  mediation.

Finally,  the mediated relationships in the hypothesized model  were tested using 

Structural  Equation Modeling (SEM) through LISREL (Jorskog &  Sorbom.  1993). 

LISREL allows  for a simultaneous test o f the entire model,  including multiple mediators 

and multiple dependent variables, and thus allows an assessment o f which o f the three 

mediators was a stronger mediator o f the POS-dependent variable relationships.

RESULTS 

Study  1  Results

The sample  for Study  1  (N = 210) was 73%  female, and respondents had a mean 

age of 21  years (SD = 4 .11) with a median age o f 19 years.  Most o f the sample was 

Caucasian (86%).  An additional  11% was African-American.  1% was Asian.  1% was 

Hispanic and  1% o f the respondents belonged to other ethnic groups.  The majority of the 

sample (65%) were completing their junior year o f college.  An additional  27% were 

completing the sophomore year, and a smaller percentage (4%) were completing their 

senior year.

The majority o f the sample were employed in the serv ice industry (27.6%). 

followed by sales (24.8%). professional (15.7%) and clerical  industry' (12.9%).  There 

was a wide range o f tenure with the employing organization (M = 20.21  months. SD = 

20.2 months, range o f 1  month to  12 years) and with the current supervisor (M =  16.25. 

SD =  17.03. range o f 1  month to  10 years).  Income  for 87% of the participants was 

S20.000 or less per year.  An additional 8% had incomes  between $20,000 and $30,000 

per year.  Table 2  presents the descriptive statistics and inter-correlations  for all scales 

administered  in Study  1.

purposes:  (1) to  refine the measures of the latent constructs used in the path model by 

shortening them while retaining their validity and unidimensionality. (2) to demonstrate 

the discriminability o f the many conceptually-related constructs  later used in the path 

model, and (3)  test the hypothesized model.  Thus. EFA 's were used to help in the 

identification o f dimensionality problems and in determining those items which had the 

highest factor saturation.  C FA 's were also used to  look at issues o f construct 

dimensionality, and to test for discriminability between measures o f what we hoped were 

related,  but separable, constructs.

Assessment o f Psychometric Characteristics of Measures 

Survey o f Perceived Organizational  Support

Exploratory  Factor Analysis (EFA) was  used  in an initial comparison o f the factor 

structure o f the  full 36-item Survey o f Perceived Organizational  Support (SPOS). 

Specifically, a principal  factors analysis with an oblimin rotation with Kaiser 

Normalization w as used to identify the factor structure underlying the  full  SPOS.  Six 

correlated  factors with eigenvalues over  1.0 accounted  for 61% of the variance.

However, only  the  first five  factors were substantively interpretable. The  loadings o f the 

items on these  five  factors and the factor eigenvalues and  inter-correlations are reported 

in Table 3.  There was a strong primary factor which accounted for 39.5% o f the variance, 

how ever,  the  results fell short o f the unitary  factor structure  found in previous  literature 

(e.g..  Eisenberger. et al..  1986).  The first factor was labeled "Perceived  Exploitation" and 

reflected the em ployee's  fears o f being taken advantage o f by the organization.

O f the eight items with loadings greater than .50 on this  factor, seven were 

negatively-worded items.  The item with the strongest loading on the Perceived 

Exploitation  factor was. " If given the opportunity, the organization would take advantage 

of me (R).” dem onstrating the  factor's representation o f employee distrust and belief in 

63

the exploitative intent o f the organization's actions.

The second  factor. "Fear o f Retribution" reflects the em ployee's fear o f being 

terminated or punished  for poor performance.  This factor had three items with strong 

loadings.  These three item s reflected the belief that the organization would replace the 

employee based on salary costs, efficiency or decreased performance (e.g.. "If the 

organization could hire som eone to replace me at a lower salary  it would." reverse 

scored).  The third  factor was  labeled "Understanding" and contained seven items that 

reflect the em ployee's b elief that the organization will offer understanding and support 

during difficult times.  For example. "The organization would forgive an honest mistake 

on my  part."

The  fourth  factor. "Concern and Caring" reflected the em ployee's belief that the 

organization had a genuine concern  for the em ployee's well-being and satisfaction (e.g.. 

"The organization tries to make my job as interesting as possible").  Seven items loaded 

highly on this  factor.  Finally, the last factor was  labeled "Perceived Value" and reflected 

the degree to which the em ployee believed  the organization sawr him/her as a valuable and 

contributing member (e.g.. "M y supervisors are proud that I am part o f this 

organization").  Eight item s loaded highly on this factor.  As can be seen from the values

reported near the bottom o f Table 3. the  five factors were moderately intercorrelated with 

values of the correlations ranging from .12 to .51.

A shorter unifactorial version o f the SPOS  was desired  for use  in  Study 2 with 

full-time employees.  Creating such a scale seemed plausible given the pattern o f positive, 

moderate intercorrelations among the five SPOS  factors extracted in the  EFA.  These 

correlations  implied the possible presence o f a single higher-order POS  influence on the 

items, as well as the more specific aspects o f POS.  Items  for a shortened scale were 

chosen on the basis o f a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL  8.14 (Joreskog 

&  Sorbom.  1993) and consisted o f the top  12  loading items on a single POS  latent 

construct.  The completely standardized CFA loadings, goodness of fit statistics, and fit 

indices results  for the one-factor model o f perceived organizational  support are shown in 

the  left-most column o f numbers in Table 4.  The chi-square fit statistic  was significant 

( X 5 4 : = l   3 1 .33. e<-05)  . indicating a poor fit o f the structural  model, other fit indices were 

within the acceptable range but were marginal (e.g..  RMSEA = .09: CFI  = .95).  Thus, the 

one-factor model o f perceived organizational  support received moderate support.

While the one-factor model provided an acceptable  fit. there is  reason to suspect 

bias  in responding to the five negatively-worded items.  If this bias is present, it may 

inflate the loadings o f negativelv-worded items in the one-factor model  because the 

method  factor variance is absorbed into the construct-relevant variance (Steinberg & 

Thissen.  1996).  Thus, a second model  was used to test the possibility that method bias 

altered responses to a subset of the POS  items.  This model specified two  latent factors.

one  factor representing the substantive perceived organizational support construct and the 

second  factor representing the method effects o f the reverse-coded items.  The seven 

positively-worded POS  items were constrained to  load only on the support latent variable 

and the  five reverse-worded items loaded on both the support and the methods latent 

variables.  The variance o f the latent factors was constrained to  1.0 and the  factors were 

specified to be orthogonal to each other.  As desired, the chi-square  for the two-factor 

model  was non-significant 

62.98, £>>.05). and the fit indices indicated an excellent

fit (see Table 4).  Therefore there is likely method bias influencing responses to the 

negatively-worded  items.  This irrelevant variance can be controlled  for during 

hypothesized model tests by creating item parcels in a way that removes the irrelevant 

method variance from the construct variance (Hall. Snell. & Faust.  1999:  Steinberg & 

Thissen.  1996).  In  particular, the negatively worded  POS  items were combined  in the 

same  item parcel during tests o f model  fit.

Employee Sense o f Obligation

The ten-item scale developed as a measure o f the em ployee's  felt obligation to 

repay the organization was found to have a two-factor solution using EFA.  A principal 

factors analysis with an oblique rotation was used to assess the factor structure of the ten 

items.  Two  factors were  found to account  for a total o f 71% o f the variance.  The first 

factor was made up o f items 4.  5. 6. 9. and  10.  These items represent the employee's  felt 

need to  increase work effort in order to repay the organization  for various benefits.  This 

factor is named the "Effort" dimension.  The second  factor was made up o f items  1. 2.  3.

7. and  8 and represents the employee's perception that he or she  is  indebted to the

6 7
organization because o f the benefits received.  This factor is the "D ebt" factor.  There was 

a moderately strong, significant correlation between the two  factors (r = .68. p<.05). 

Factor loadings  for the items along with the eigenvalues and  factor correlation are 

presented  in Table 5.

Two confirmatory  factor analyses were performed to test the structural model of 

the  full  Employee Sense o f Obligation Scale.  The first model constrained all of the Effort 

items  to  load on an Effort latent factor and all o f the Debt items to  load on a Debt latent 

factor.  The two  factors were allowed to freely correlate.  The second model constrained 

all o f the  Effort and all o f the Debt items to load on one latent factor.  The variances of 

the  latent variables in both models w'ere fixed to  1.0.

The chi-square goodness o f fit statistics and fit indices for the two-factor and one- 

factor obligation models are shown in Appendix B.  The chi-square for the two-factor 

model  was significant (X3 42=  156.21. p <.05) and had a rather large RMSEA of .14. 

Additionally, the fit indices were all  lower than desirable, ranging  from  .83  to .86. 

However, modification indices indicated that the fit could be improved by adding 

correlated errors between items  1  and 2 and between items 3  and 4.  Rather than specify 

these correlated errors, items  1  and 3  were dropped from the measure resulting in a 

significant improvement in  fit (x,<f =46.58. p<.05) and a lowered  RMSEA o f .087.

The one-factor model  had a much poorer fit than the two-factor model, with a 

significant chi-square (X352= 252.42. p =.05) and a larger RMSEA o f .18.  The fit indices 

were also much lower, ranging from .71  to .78.  Thus, there is reason to suspect that there 

are two dimensions underlying the em ployee's sense o f obligation.  The first one may

generalized  feeling o f debt.

However,  for purposes o f the replication study,  it was preferable to have a shorter, 

unidimensional  measure o f Employee Sense o f Obligation. A shortened obligation scale 

was created by  referring to the one-factor model and taking the  highest five loading items. 

Three items were taken from the Debt dimension and two  items were taken from the 

Effort dimension.  The decision was made to not choose one subscale over the other 

because both dimensions reflect the theoretical intent o f social exchange theory.  Further, 

because the two  dimensions were highly correlated it seemed justifiable to combine items 

from both dim ensions on the shorter scale. The CFA results support the 

unidimensionality and internal consistency o f the short obligation scale.  Standardized 

factor loadings ranged from .57 to .85 (see Table 6). and the model  fit extremely well.

the Identification with Psychological Groups and the Adjective Overlap? In order to 

answer these questions a series o f exploratory and confirmatory  factor analyses were

71

used.

As  found  in previous work. EFA o f all the items o f the Identification with 

Psychological  Groups measure showed two dimensions as evidenced by a scree plot and 

eigenvalues over  1.0. The  10-item scale was  factor analyzed using  principal  factor 

analysis with an oblim in rotation with Kaiser Normalization.  The first dimension 

reflected the extent to which there are shared experiences with the group and the second 

reflected the extent to which the self has shared characteristics with the group. The 

Shared Experiences and Shared Characteristics factors were moderately correlated (r = 

.48).  Factor loadings along with eigenvalues and the factor correlation appear in 

Appendix C.

Before performing the CFA's. the items  from the two scales were combined  into 

item parcels  for ease o f analysis.  These parcels were created on the basis o f the  EFA 

results by  pairing the highest loading item with the lowest loading item, the next highest 

with the next lowest, etc.  Four item parcels were created for the  Identification with 

Psychological Groups measure.  Two o f the parcels reflected the shared characteristics 

dimension  found  by  Mael and Tetrick (1992) and consisted o f the mean o f items 7 and 

10. and  items 8 and 9. respectively.  The other two parcels reflected the Shared 

Experience dimension.  These consisted o f the means o f items  1. 2. and 6. and items 3. 4. 

and 5.  Three additional  item parcels were created  for the Adjective Overlap scale by- 

calculating the means o f items  1. 2.3. and 4;  items 5. 6. and 7: and items 8. 9. and  10.

72

A series o f C FA 's examined the factor structure o f the Identification with 

Psychological Groups and the Adjective Overlap.  It was assumed that the Adjective 

Overlap would correspond to the Shared Characteristics dimension o f the  Identification 

with  Psychological  Groups measure and that both the Adjective Overlap and the Shared 

Characteristics would be distinguishable from the Shared  Experiences dimension.  This 

assumption was tested using four nested models.

The  first model specified three latent variables corresponding to  the Adjective 

Overlap and the two dimensions of the Identification with Psychological  Groups 

measures, respectively.  The model constrained the items  from the Shared Experiences 

dimension to  load only on an Experience latent factor, the items  from the Shared 

Characteristics dimension to load only on a Characteristics latent factor, and the 

Adjective Overlap items to  load on an Overlap latent factor.

The second model specified two latent variables and tested for the distinction 

between the Shared  Experiences dimension  from the Shared Characteristics dimension 

and Adjective Overlap.  It constrained the Shared Experiences items to  load only on an 

Experience latent factor while allowing the Shared Characteristics and Adjective Overlap 

items to  load on a single Characteristics latent factor.  The third model also specified two 

latent variables testing  for the distinction between the Adjective Overlap and the 

combined dimensions o f the Identification with  Psychological Groups.  It constrained the 

Shared Characteristics and the Shared Experiences  items to load on one latent 

Identification  factor and constrained the Adjective Overlap to load only on a latent 

Adjective factor.

73

Finally, the fourth model allowed all the items to load only on one latent 

Identification factor.  For all models the variance o f the latent factors was constrained to 

equal  1.0.  All chi-square goodness o f fit statistics and  fit indices are reported  in Table 7. 

The three-factor model had a non-significant chi-square statistic (Xi i: =  12.69. p=.31) 

indicating a good fit.  The fit indices for this model were high, ranging  from .98  to  1.0. 

with  RMSEA o f .03.  The two-factor model constraining the Shared Characteristics and 

Adjective Overlap to load on the same latent factor,  in contrast, had a chi-square statistic 

o f  Xi;-" =78.03. p <.01.  with fit statistics ranging from 77 to .89.

A chi-square difference test between the three and the two-factor model  indicated 

a significantly  improved  fit for the three-factor model (X :: =65.34  .  p <.01).  Additionally.

an examination o f the Adjusted Goodness o f Fit (AGFI) can allow an assessment o f the 

fit ot  a model adjusted  for the advantage o f lower degrees of freedom  in more complex 

models.  The AGFI  for the three-factor model  was  .95 versus  .77  in the two-factor model. 

Thus, the three-factor model had a superior fit to the two-factor model combining Shared 

Characteristics and the Adjective Overlap.

The third model was also a two-factor model, combining the two dimensions o f 

the  Identification with Psychological Groups on one latent Identification factor and the 

Adjective Overlap on a second latent factor.  This model had a non-significant chi-square 

(Zi5~= 12.88. p>.05).  A chi-square difference test was non-significant (X::= 0.19  . p>.10) 

indicating that the more parsimonious two-factor model does not fit significantly worse 

than the three-factor model.

Finally, the last model constrained all items to load on one latent Identification 

factor.  This model provided a substantially worse fit than the three and two-factor 

models.  However, modification indices indicated the need to specify correlated errors 

between the three adjective overlap manifest variables.  Because this addition to the 

model  was reasonable, a fourth model was tested that loaded all  items on one latent 

Identification  factor and specified correlated errors among the three adjective overlap 

manifest variables. This model had a non-significant chi-square (X u2 -8.92. p>.01) and

had high  fit statistics, ranging  from .99 to  1.0.

A direct test o f the difference between the one-factor model with correlated errors, 

and the two-factor model combining the dimensions o f the Identification with 

Psychological Group, shows the significantly better fit of the two-factor model (y-: =3.96 

p.  >.05).  However, the difference between these two models is small and the theoretical 

rationale supports the idea o f combining the three measures o f self-concept on one  latent 

factor rather than separating them.  Further, the slight tendency  for the Adjective Overlap 

items to  load on a separate factor from the Identification items may be due.  not to a 

distinction in underlying constructs,  but to the difference in response scales.  Therefore, 

there is reason to believe that the three measures o f self-concept all  tap the same 

underlying construct.  Because the results o f the CFA indicated that the Adjective 

Ov erlap was redundant with Shared Characteristics,  the decision was made to eliminate 

the Adjective Overlap scale  from the replication and extension study.  This decision was 

made based on the difficulty o f completing the measure and concern over the length of 

the total  survey.

Psychometric Differentiation o f Measures 

Distinction  Between Support.  Self-Esteem and Self-Concept

One o f the primary goals o f this research is to examine the relationships between 

perceptions o f support, organization-based self-esteem, and organization-based self- 

concept.  However, in order to make compelling claims about these relationships it is  first 

necessary  to demonstrate the separateness o f these constructs.  An initial  principal  factors 

analysis of items  for the SPOS. OBSE and organization-based self-concept scales with an 

oblique rotation with Kaiser Normalization found six eigenvalues over  1.0 with a 

noticeable break after the third factor.  A three-factor solution provided a coherent factor 

solution.  The  POS  items all  loaded highly on the  first factor, which accounted for 38% of 

the variance.  All o f the OBSE items loaded on the second factor accounting  for 9.2% of 

the variance.  However,  for three o f the OBSE items the highest factor loading was on the 

Support  factor and  for one OBSE  item the highest factor loading was on the  Self-Concept 

factor.  All o f the Identification with Psychological Groups  items loaded on the third 

factor accounting  for 8.4% o f the variance, except for item 8  which did not load 

significantly on any of the three factors.  Thus, with the exception of four o f the OBSE 

items, the items clearly loaded on their respective  factors.  In order to confirm the three- 

factor solution, a confirmatory  factor analysis was conducted to test for the differentiation 

between support. OBSE and organization-based self-concept.  Appendix  D reports the 

item  loadings, eigenvalues and factor intercorrelations  for Support. OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept.

As a first step,  item parcels were created for each o f the three constructs.  Three 

parcels were created  for POS by calculating the means of items 3. 23. and 28:  items  1.4. 

and 9:  and items  10. 21. 25. and 27.  The POS  item parcels were com bined in a manner 

that grouped the negatively-worded items in order to remove the effects o f response bias 

from the construct variance.  Three parcels were created for OBSE consisting o f the 

means of items  1.  3. 6. and 7:  items 2. 4. and 5: and  items 8. 9. and  10.  Finally,  four 

parcels were created  for organization-based self-concept consisting o f the means of items 

1. 2. and 6:  items 3. 4. and 5: items 7 and  10: and items 8 and 9.

A three-factor CFA model was tested which specified the existence o f three latent 

variables corresponding to POS. OBSE and organization-based self-concept.  The model 

constrained the three POS item parcels to  load only on the POS  latent variable, the three 

OBSE parcels to  load only on the OBSE  latent and the organization-based  self-concept 

parcels to  load only on the self-concept latent variable.

The model  had a significant chi-square (x3: :=68.38. p<.01). suggesting a poor fit 

o f the model to the covariance matrix.  Nevertheless, the other indices o f fit were high 

(NNFI  = .95: CFI  = .97) with a moderately low error of approximation (RMSEA = .08). 

The modification  indices suggested that allowing for correlated errors between the second 

OBSE item parcel  and the second  POS  item parcel and correlated errors between the third 

OBSE  parcel and the third POS parcel  would increase the fit of the model.  Conceptually, 

freeing these param eter makes sense.  The OBSE parcel reflects the organization's 

communication that it values the employees and the POS parcel reflects concern and 

caring  for the employee.  The specification o f these correlated errors Substantially-

improved the  fit o f the model.  The chi-square was a non-significant (x 3o :=41.64. p>.05) 

with  fit statistics ranging from .96 (GFI) and .99 (CFI) with a RMSEA o f .04.  The 

difference between the two models was significantly different (x: := 24.74. p< 05) 

suggesting that the addition o f the correlated errors substantially  improves the fit o f the 

model.  Thus,  both models point to the ability to discriminate POS. OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept from each other.  The three  latent constructs had 

moderate to high intercorrelations (POS-OBSE = .73:  POS-self-concept = .57; OBSE- 

self-concept = .57  ).

Distinction  Between Support.  Exchange Ideology, and Obligation

W hile previous work has empirically demonstrated the distinction between 

support and other attitudinal variables (e.g.. satisfaction and affective commitment: 

Hutchison.  1997: Shore & Tetrick.  1991). no research has demonstrated the distinction 

between support and belief in an exchange ideology.  Further,  for the purposes o f this 

study,  it was necessary to also determine the separateness o f employee sense o f obligation 

from  both exchange ideology and support.

An  initial  principal  factors analysis using oblimin rotations with Kaiser 

Normalization found a three-factor solution.  The first factor corresponded to the POS 

construct,  the second factor corresponded to the Obligation construct and the third factor 

represented  Exchange Ideology.  The SPOS  items all  loaded only on the Support factor. 

All  of the  items on the Employee Sense o f Obligation scale loaded only on the Obligation 

factor, except for item  10 which also loaded on the Support factor.  All o f the exchange 

ideology  items loaded significantly on the Exchange Ideology  factor except for item  1.

which did not load highly on any factor.  Item loadings, eigenvalues and factor 

intercorrelations appear in Appendix E.

Because the EFA provided strong reason to believe a three-factor solution is the 

best model, a CFA was conducted specifying three latent variables - one for Support, one 

for Obligation and one for Exchange.  As with the other CFA models, item parcels were 

created to use as manifest indicators o f support, exchange ideology and employee sense 

o f obligation.  Three parcels were created for POS by calculating the means o f items 3.

23. and 28:  items  1. 4. and 9: and items  10. 21. 25. and 27.  Item level data were used as 

manifest indicators o f the Exchange Ideology latent variable.  Finally, two parcels  were 

created  for employee sense o f obligation consisting o f the mean of items 7. 8. and 9: and 

items 2 and  10.  The three-factor confirmatory model hypothesized three correlated  latent 

factors (POS. exchange ideology, and obligation).  Each item parcel was constrained to 

load only on  its relevant construct.

The three-factor model had a significant chi-square (Xvf=68.85. p<-05) with high 

fit statistics (CFI = .96; NNFI  = .94; AGFI = .92) and a RMSEA of  .078.  Modification 

indices suggested the benefit of specifying correlated errors between exchange ideology 

items  1  and 2 and between items  1  and 5.  The specification o f these paths improved  fit (x 

;o:=54.20. p<05) with high fit indices (CFI = .97; NNFI = .95: AGFI = .94) and a lower 

RMSEA of .065.  Therefore, the three-factor model distinguishing the POS. Obligation 

and the  Exchange  Ideology latent variables was accepted as the best fitting model.

Tests of Hypothesized Model 

80

Due to the complexity o f the model, the hypotheses were tested in a series o f 

analyses.  First, moderated multiple regression was used to test for the moderating effects 

o f exchange ideology on the POS-Employee Sense o f Obligation relationship.  A second 

series o f moderated multiple regressions was used to test for the moderating effects o f the 

three levels o f self on the  POS-obligation. OBSE and organization-based self-concept 

mediator relationships.  Note that because o f the difficulty o f detecting moderating effects 

in  field studies due to the joint distribution o f independent and moderator variables 

(McClelland & Judd.  1993). a relatively liberal alpha level o f .10 was used to ensure 

adequate power in the statistical test o f the interaction effects.  Finally. SEM was used to 

simultaneously test  for the mediating effects o f obligation, self-esteem and self-concept. 

Moderated Paths

Hypothesis 2 states that exchange ideology' moderates the relationship between 

POS and employee-sense o f obligation.  This hypothesis was tested using multiple 

regression.  POS accounted  for a significant amount o f variance in employee obligation 

If i :us = 84.83. p<.05. R2 =  .29). The addition o f exchange ideology to the regression 

model  did  not significantly  increment the amount o f variance accounted for in employee 

obligation (AR2 =  .028. p>.05).  Likewise, the addition o f the multiplicative interaction 

term between POS and exchange ideology did not significantly increment the amount of 

variance accounted  for in employee obligation (AR2 = .005. p>.05).  Therefore, the

hypothesized moderating effects o f exchange ideology on the POS-employee obligation 

81

relationship were not supported.

Additional tests o f the moderating role o f exchange ideology w ere conducted in an 

exploratory'  fashion.  Previous work (e.g.. Eisenberger et al..  1986: Orpen.  1994)  found 

that exchange ideology moderated the effects o f POS on outcome variables.  POS had 

significant effects on affective and normative commitment and turnover intentions. 

Exchange ideology,  in contrast, accounted for significant main effects only  for affective 

comment and did not account for any significant variance when entered as a 

multiplicative POS-exchange  ideology term (see Table 8).  Thus, contrary  to  previous 

literature, there w as no evidence o f the moderating influence o f exchange  ideology on 

affective, continuance, or normative commitment or turnover intentions.

Hypothesis 8 states that the three levels o f self-construal moderate the relationship 

betw een  POS and the three mediating variables.  Level o f self-construal  w as measured 

using the Tw enty  Statements Test and calculating the proportion of self-statements 

categorized as independent, relational and collective.  In the regression analyses the three 

levels o f self were treated as a continuous variable.  Nonetheless, an examination of the 

frequency o f the levels o f self found that nearly all  participants (95%) had 51% or more 

of their statements categorized at the individual  level.  The remaining 5% had the 

majority o f their statements categorized at the relational  level.  None o f the participants 

had the majority o f their statements categorized at the collective level.

A  series o f moderated multiple regressions were conducted to test hypothesis 8.

obligation should be the strongest when the individual holds an individualistic self- 

construal.  While POS  had a significant effect on obligation (P = .543. p<.01), neither the 

individual  level of self, nor the POS-individual  interaction accounted  for significant 

amounts of variance in employee sense o f obligation (see Table 9).

Second, the model  hypothesizes that the relationship between POS and OBSE will 

be the strongest when the self is defined at the relational  level of self.  M oderate support 

was found  for this proposition.  The interaction between POS and the relational self was 

statistically significant (P = .100. p = .066). and had a form consistent with the 

hypothesis.  Specifically, the  POS-OBSE relationship was stronger for individuals who 

were more relational. Also, there was a significant main effect of relational  level o f self (P 

= -.092.  p= .09). such that overall. OBSE was lower for the more relational  individuals. 

This was not an especially strong relationship, and may have been due to  increased 

sensitivity of relational  individuals to negative cues about esteem.

Finally, the hypothesized model  predicted that the relationship between POS and 

organization-based self-concept would be strongest for individuals defining the self at the 

collective level. The main effects o f POS and collective level of self accounted  for 

significant amounts o f variance.  And in addition, the interaction term was statistically 

significant (P  = .098. p = .100) and had a form consistent with the hypothesis.

Specifically, the POS-organization-based self-concept relationship was stronger 

for individuals who were more collective.  However, similar to the pattern observed with 

the relational self, there was a significant main effect o f collective level o f self (P = -.145. 

p=  .02). such that overall, organization-based self-concept was  lower for the more

collective individuals.  The fact that these moderating effects were detected in a field 

sample  is rather remarkable given the know difficulty o f finding such effects (McClelland 

86

& Judd.  1993).  Thus, considerable attention should be focused on replicating these 

effects  in larger samples.  Table 9 summarizes the tests o f Hypothesis 8a-c.

Early work on individual and social identities found differences in the way males 

and  females construed the self.  Males tended to emphasize individualistic views o f the 

self and  females tended to emphasize the more social, or collective, views o f the self.

This work, however, did not distinguish between relational and collective levels o f social 

identities.  Recent work by Gabriele and Gardner (1999) suggested that males and 

females also differ in emphasis on relational versus collective levels o f self.  Specifically, 

females tend to have stronger relational selves, emphasizing their involvement in small, 

close groups.  Males on the other hand have stronger collective selves, emphasizing their 

membership  in large, impersonal social groups.  Although Gabriele and G ardner's line o f 

research is not o f central  interest to the model hypothesized in this study,  it is  useful to 

consider, and control for, the impact gender may have in the above moderated multiple 

regressions.

A second series o f regressions were performed, entering the main effects o f 

gender.  POS  and the level o f self in the first step, and entering the multiplicative  POS- 

level o f self interaction term in the second step. Gender did have main effects  for 

employee sense o f obligation and organization-based self-concept, but in no case did the 

addition o f the gender variable alter the substantive conclusion o f the POS-level o f self 

moderator analysis.  Specifically, gender had a main effect on employee sense o f

obligation (P = -.102. p<.10. when entered with relational  self: P  = -.098. p<.10. when 

entered with collective self)- suggesting that overall males were more likely to  feel 

obligated..  Gender also had a main effect on organization-based self-concept (P =  .128. 

p< 05.  when entered with individual self; p = .121. p<.05. when entered with relational 

self:  p  = .113. p<.10. when entered with collective self), suggesting that overall  females 

87

had a stronger organization-based self-concepts.

Mediated  Paths

Structural  Equation Modeling (SEM) using LISREL  8.14 (Jorskog & Sorbom.

1993)  was used to test the mediated paths o f the hypothesized model.  A structural  model

was specified in which three parcels served as manifest indicators o f POS. two parcels

loaded on employee sense o f obligation, three loaded on OBSE.  four loaded on

organization-based self-concept, and two each served as manifest indicators  for affective

and normative commitment.  Item level  indicators were used for both continuance

commitment and turnover intentions.

POS  was allowed to have direct paths to each o f the mediators (obligation.  OBSE.

and self-concept) and each o f the dependent variables (affective, normative and

continuance commitment and turnover intentions).  Each o f the mediators was allowed to

\

have direct paths to the four dependent variables.  No additional  paths were specified.

The metric o f the latent constructs was set by constraining one manifest indicator per 

construct to one.

The hypothesized model provided a fit of X i531= 5 86.71  with moderate  fit indices 

(NNFI  = .86: CFI  = .88;  RMSEA = .08:  SRMR = .11).  Modification indices suggested

seven changes that would drastically  improve the fit o f the model.  Based on the 

modification indices, the following changes were made to the model: (1) the  first turnover 

item  was dropped as a manifest indicator. (2) the  first continuance commitment item was 

dropped as a manifest indicator, (3) a correlated error term between items two and three 

88

on the continuance commitment scale was added. (4) the  first OBSE item parcel was 

dropped as a manifest indicator. (5) a correlated disturbance term between continuance 

com m itm ent and normative commitment was added. (6) a correlated disturbance term 

between organization-based self-concept and employee sense of obligation was added, 

and (7) direct paths were added leading from affective,  normative and continuance 

commitment to turnover intentions.  The most important change to the hypothesized 

model  involves the change  in the relationship between commitment and turnover 

intentions.  According to modification indices the fit o f the model  improves  by allowing 

the three  forms of commitment have direct relationships with turnover intentions.  This 

change was deemed appropriate because it does not change the substantive argument of 

the model  (i.e.. that social exchange and self structures are mediators o f the effects of 

POS)  and because similar models have been tested in previous  literature (e.g.. Guzzo. 

Noonan &  Elron.  1994). Thus, each o f these changes was  logical and in the  instance o f 

the paths  from the commitment variables to turnover intentions, were supported by 

previous  literature. The new' relationship between the three forms of commitment and 

turnover intentions  is depicted in  Figure 3  in reference to the findings o f Study  1.

Overall  Fit and Direct Paths

The revised overall model had excellent fit (Xi842=31 1.79. p>.05) with good  fit

indices (CFI  =  .95: NNFI = .94) and moderately low errors (RM SEA = .06: SRMR = .08). 

Given this evidence o f overall good fit. we can now proceed to evaluate the evidence  for 

the proposed mediators o f the relationship between POS and the organizational outcome 

variables (i.e..  three forms of organizational commitment and turnover intentions).  Table 

10 presents the estimates of the total, direct and indirect path coefficients for each of the 

dependent variables.  Figure 3 presents the model and the coefficients  for all direct paths.

First, as would be expected given the hypothesized mediator effects, perceived 

organizational  support had positive, significant direct effects on the three mediator 

variables:  employee sense of obligation (p =  .18). OBSE (p = .25). organization-based 

self-concept (P = .45).  Again, consistent with the expected mediated relationship. POS 

had non-significant direct effects on the three  forms of commitment, but it did have 

significant indirect effects on these variables as discussed below.  However.  POS did not 

have the expected significant indirect effects on turnover intentions, although it did have 

an unexpected direct effect (P = - .37).

A more detailed look at the mediating relationships showed that, employee sense 

of obligation had positive, significant effects on affective and normative commitment and 

turnover intentions,  but contrary' to expectations, was not related to continuance 

commitment.  Organization-based self-concept had significant relationships with each o f 

the three  forms o f commitment, but was not directly related to turnover intentions. OBSE.

on the other hand, had a significant relationship with affective commitment but was not 

related to any o f the other dependent variables.  Another way o f thinking about these 

relationships  is that although the three commitment variables all showed indirect effects 

of POS. the pattern o f mediator variables carrying the POS effect was different for each 

of the three outcome variables.  And as mentioned earlier, there were no  indirect effects 

of POS  on turnover intentions, although this variable did show significant indirect effects 

of the employee sense o f obligation and organization-based self-concept.  The assessment 

of which mediators contributed more to specific outcome variables  is  further explored in 

the next  few paragraphs.

Overall  Indirect Paths and Mediation

Table  11  presents the indirect path coefficients for each o f the dependent 

variables.  The  indirect coefficient is an omnibus test of the relationship betw een POS 

and the dependent variables mediated by the combined effects o f obligation. OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept.  As can be seen from the values  for the indirect effects 

listed  in the "POS" colum n o f Table  11. perceived organizational  support has significant 

mediated  paths to each o f the three commitment variables, but not to turnover intentions. 

While the omnibus test is informative,  it does not indicate which specific mediator 

variable was most influential  in mediating the effects of POS.  In order to delineate the 

importance o f each  mediator, the specific  indirect path coefficients w ere calculated.

These values appear in Table  11.  The relationship between POS and affective 

commitment was m ost strongly mediated by the organization-based self-concept.

Likewise, the relationship between support and continuance commitment was also most 

strongly  mediated by the organization-based self-concept.  Finally,  for the indirect path 

between  POS and normative commitment, employee sense o f obligation was the strongest 

mediator.

While mediated relationships were found between POS and the commitment 

variables, only a direct relationship was found between support and turnover intentions. 

However, significant indirect paths were found between turnover intentions and two of 

the  m odel's mediators: employee sense of obligation and organization-based self-concept. 

Self-concept had a negative indirect relationship with turnover intentions, with the 

strongest mediating path through affective commitment.

Obligation had a strong,  negative indirect relationship through normative 

commitment, but obligation also had a high, positive direct relationship with turnover 

intentions.  This relationship makes sense when the sample characteristics are considered. 

The sample consisted o f part time employees who were working part time while they 

finished school.  Many o f these individuals may  not have had any  intentions o f remaining 

with the organization prior to  finishing their educations.  Based on principles o f cognitive 

dissonance, these  individuals may have been more likely to leave when they  perceived 

high amounts of obligation to the organization.  In other words, they knew that they 

would not be able to repay the organization in the future and thus,  had higher intentions to 

leav e  in order to reduce the  inconsistency.  At the same time, however.  Employee  Sense 

o f Obligation may lower intentions to leave by increasing commitment due to moral 

obligations to the organization.

Model  Summary

Study  1  supported many o f the hypotheses regarding the mediated paths between 

POS  and employee attitudes.  POS  had significant positive indirect relationships with 

each o f the commitment variables (affective, normative, and continuance).  Specifically, 

in support o f Hypothesis 3c. there was a significant mediated path between  POS and 

normative commitment mediated by employee sense o f obligation.  In support of 

Hypotheses 7a and 7b. there was a significant indirect path between POS and affective 

and continuance commitment mediated by organization-based self-concept.  Contrary to 

Hypotheses 3d. 5d. and 7d. there was no mediated path between POS and turnover 

intentions.  There was. however, a significant negative direct relationship with turnover 

intentions.  Little support was  found  for the moderating effects of exchange  ideology on 

the  relationship between POS and employee-sense o f obligation.  However,  some support 

w as  found  for the moderating role o f level of self-construal.  Specifically,  the relational 

and collective  levels o f self moderated the relationships between POS and OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept, respectively.  These results demonstrate the importance 

o f including the self-related variables in the model o f organizational  support.

Study 2  Results

The sample for Study 2 (N = 72) was 68% male. 90% Caucasian. 6% African- 

Am erican and 4% Hispanic.  Respondents had a mean age o f 35 years (SD =  8.24) with a 

median age o f 34 years and 54% had attended at least one year o f college.  There was a 

wide range o f tenure with the employing organization (M = 82.39 months.  SD = 86.59 

months,  range o f 3  month to 40 years) and with the current supervisor (M  =  56.13. SD =

72.43. range o f 2 month to 40 years).  Income for 57% o f the participants was S40.000 or 

less per year.  An additional  15% had incomes between $40,000 and $60,000 per year 

(the higher income o f this group is due to additional part-time work for local  fire 

departments).  Table  12 presents the descriptive statistics and inter-correlations  for all 

scales administered in Study 2.

Study 2 was conducted in order to replicate key aspects of the hypothesized model 

with a second sample o f full-time employees. The next section presents the results o f the 

moderated multiple regressions and Structural  Equation Models (SEM ) conducted to test 

the hypotheses.

Moderated Paths

As  in  Study  1. a series o f moderated multiple regression analyses were performed 

to test the proposed moderated paths associated with Hypotheses 2 and 8.  The results of 

these tests appear in Table  13.  Again, due to the recognized difficulty  in detecting 

significant moderator effects in field studies (caused by the less than optimal distribution 

of the independent and moderator variables:  McClelland & Judd.  1993) and due to the 

typical  small  effect size for interactions and the small sample size o f Study 2. a liberal 

probability  value o f .10 is taken.

In order to test the moderating effects o f Exchange Ideology on the  POS- 

Employee Sense o f Obligation, a moderated multiple regression was conducted in which 

Exchange Ideology was entered into a regression model,  followed by  POS. and  finally the 

multiplicative interaction term between POS and Exchange Ideology.  While both the 

main effects o f Exchange Ideology and POS accounted  for significant amounts of

variance  in the regression model, the interaction term did not account for additional 

variance (AR: = .015. p>.10).

Additional tests of the moderating role o f exchange  ideology were again 

conducted  in an exploratory  fashion.  In contrast to  Study  1. exchange ideology did have 

significant main effects on many o f the employee attitudes and behaviors.  However, the 

exchange ideologv-POS interaction term was significant only for affective commitment 

(P = -. 181. p =  .08).  And. even here, the interaction was inconsistent with expectations. 

POS  had a stronger relationship with affective commitment when exchange ideology  was 

low rather than high.  Thus, as in Study  1. exchange ideology did not show the expected 

moderator pattern.  The results of these exploratory analyses appear in Table  14.

The moderating effects o f level o f self-construal were next tested through a series 

o f moderated multiple regressions.  For each regression, the effects of POS were added 

first to the regression model,  followed by the level o f self variable, then the multiplicative 

interaction term was added.  Table  14 summarizes these results.  For Employee Sense of 

Obligation, the expected moderating effect of self-construal was not found (P = -.072. 

p>.l 0).  Likewise, the relational self-construal did not moderate the relationship between 

POS and OBSE (P =  .072. p>.10).  Finally, while collective self-construal did not 

moderate the relationship between POS and organization-based self-concept (P = .031. 

p>. 10).  there was an unexpected moderating effect o f individual self-construal (P = -.271. 

p<.01). Specifically, when the individual self-construal was high, the relationship 

between  POS and organization-based self-concept was weaker than when individual self- 

construal was low. Although not hypothesized, this result is consistent with theory.

The effects o f gender were again investigated in response to Gabriele and 

Gardner's (1999)  findings that males and females differ in the level at which the self is 

typically construed.  Gender. POS and the level o f self were entered first into the 

regression equation followed by the POS-level o f self interaction term.  Gender did not 

have a significant main effect for any o f the three mediator variables (i.e.. employee sense 

of obligation. OBSE. organization-based self-concept).  Gender also did not change the 

the substantive conclusions o f the POS-level o f self moderator analyses.

POS-Job  Performance Relationship

Hypotheses 3e. 5e and 7e posit that Employee Sense o f Obligation. OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept, respectively, mediated the relationship between POS and 

job performance.  Due to the low number o f supervisors responding for the job 

performance variable (N =21). these hypotheses could not be tested via Structural 

Equation  M odeling.  Thus. Baron and K enny's (1986) three-step multiple regression 

approach was used to test the mediated relationship between POS and job performance. 

Evidence  for mediation is provided when (1) POS accounts for significant variance in the 

mediator. (2)  POS accounts for significant variance in job performance, and (3) when 

entered  into the regression equation together, the mediator accounts  for significant 

v ariance  in job performance and the coefficient for POS  becomes non-significant.

The mediating role o f employee sense o f obligation was evaluated first.  POS  was 

first used to predict employee sense of obligation.  Second. POS was used to predict job 

performance.  Finally,  POS and obligation were used to predict job performance.  POS did 

account for a significant amount o f variance in employee sense o f obligation and. as can

be seen in the top-m ost line o f Table  15, POS accounted for significant variance in job 

performance with a significant coefficient (P = .485, p<.10).  Finally, when Employee 

Sense of Obligation and POS were entered into the regression model, obligation did not 

account for a significant amount o f variance in job performance.  However, the 

coefficient for POS dropped from .458 when alone in the model to  .398 when entered into 

the regression along with Obligation as would be expected in a mediated relationship. 

This pattern suggests that with a larger sample size, employee sense o f obligation would 

have mediated the relationship between POS and job performance.  Nonetheless, the 

change for the POS coefficient is small, suggesting that the relationship is likely to be 

partially mediated, at best.

The evidence for a mediating role o f OBSE was stronger.  POS accounted for 

significant variance in OBSE (p = .612. p<.05).  When job performance was regressed on 

OBSE and POS. OBSE accounted for a significant amount o f variance (p = .508. p<. 10) 

and  POS no  longer accounted for significant variance (P = .116. p>.10). Thus the 

mediation hypothesis was supported for OBSE.

Finally, organization-based self-concept also mediated the relationship between 

POS and job performance.  POS accounted for a significant amount o f variance in self- 

concept (P =.441.  p<-05)  Likewise, when both POS and self-esteem were entered into a 

regression model,  self-concept accounted for significant variance in job performance (P = 

.438. p<.10), but POS no longer accounted for a significant am ount o f variance (P = .286, 

p>.10). These results supported the hypothesized mediating effects o f organization-based 

self-concept on jo b  performance.

M ediated Paths

1 0 7

Structural  Equation Modeling (SEM ) using LISREL 8.14 (Jorskog & Sorbom. 

1993) was used to test the remaining mediated paths o f the hypothesized model.  A 

structural model was specified in which three parcels served as m anifest indicators of 

POS. two parcels  loaded on employee sense o f obligation, three loaded on OBSE. two 

loaded on organization-based self-concept, and two each served as m anifest indicators for 

continuance com m itm ent and normative commitment.  Item  level  indicators were used 

for both affective commitment and turnover intentions.

POS was allowed to have direct paths to each of the mediators (obligation. OBSE. 

and  self-concept) and each o f the dependent variables (affective, norm ative and 

continuance com m itm ent and turnover intentions).  Each o f the m ediators was allowed to 

have direct paths to the four dependent variables.  A direct path was allowed between 

each o f the three commitment variables and turnover intentions.  No additional  paths 

were specified.  The metric o f the latent constructs was set by constraining one manifest 

indicator per construct to one.

Model  Fit and  Direct Paths

The hypothesized model  provided a fit o f Xi3o2= 198.66. p<.05  with  fit indices o f 

N'NFI  = .86 and CFI = .90. and errors o f  RMSEA = .09 and SRMR = .085.  Thus, there  is 

moderate support for the model.  Nonetheless, modification indices suggested several 

changes that substantially improved the  fit o f the model without detracting  from the 

theoretical  underpinnings o f the model:  (1) a correlated error between two affective 

commitment items (items 3  and  1) was added. (2) a correlated error between two self-

esteem  item parcels (parcels 2 and 3) was added, and (3) a correlated disturbance was 

added between normative commitment and continuance commitment.

The chi-square goodness of fit o f the revised model was Xi2»:=172.94. p<.05  with

acceptable fit statistics (CFI = .93: NNFI =  .91) and low errors (RMSEA = .05:  SRMR = 

.08).  Table  16 presents the estimates o f the total, direct and indirect path coefficients for 

each o f the dependent variables.  Figure 4 presents the model and the coefficients  for all 

direct paths.  All reported coefficients and effects are presented as standardized variables. 

Due to the low sample size the standard error was larger than would be the case if the 

sample size were larger,  thus, a more liberal probability value o f . 10 was used to assess 

the significance o f path coefficients.

As in  Study  1.  POS  had positive significant effects on each o f the three mediator 

variables:  Employee  Sense of Obligation (P = .61. p<.05): OBSE (P =.72. p<.05) and 

Organization-Based  Self-Concept (P = .51. p<.05). Also. POS had non-significant direct 

effects on the three forms o f commitment and turnover intentions, but did have significant 

indirect effects on the attitude variables as would be expected  in a mediated relationship.

The self-related mediators showed significant relationships with several o f the 

dependent variables.  Specifically. OBSE was positively related to affective commitment 

(P  =  .47.  p<.05) and negatively related to continuance commitment (P  = -.95. p<.05). but 

was not related to normative commitment or turnover intentions.  Likewise, organization- 

based self-concept was positively related to affective commitment (P = .59. p<.05). but 

w as not related to any o f the other attitudes.  In contrast to Study  1. employee sense o f

obligation was not significantly related to any o f the attitude variables.  The specific 

I l l

mediated paths are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Overall  Indirect Paths and M ediation

Table  17 presents the indirect path coefficients for each o f the dependent 

variables.  M irroring the results  from Study  1. perceived organizational support has 

significant mediated paths to each o f the three commitment variables, but not to turnover 

intentions.  In order to delineate the importance o f each mediator, the specific indirect 

path coefficients were calculated.  These values appear in Table  17.

The relationship between POS and the three commitment variables were most 

strongly mediated by OBSE as indicated by the following standardized estimates o f the 

indirect path coefficients: affective commitment (P = .34, p<.05); continuance 

commitment (P = -.68. p<.05); normative commitment (P = . 19. p>.05).  The second 

highest mediated path between POS and affective and continuance commitment was 

through organization-based self-concept (P = .30, p<.05 and P = .09. p>.05. respectively), 

and  for the relationship between POS and normative commitment the next highest 

mediator was employee sense o f obligation (P = .10, p>.05).  Thus, employee sense o f 

obligation  had disappointing results in Study 2 as compared to Study  1.  Likewise, 

normative commitment was not significantly mediated by any o f the three mediators 

whereas,  in Study  1, it was strongly mediated by employee sense o f obligation.

Nev ertheless, there is still substantial support for the importance o f self-relevant variables 

in the explanation o f the effects o f POS.

In contrast to Study  1,  POS did not have a significant direct effect on turnover intentions, 

however the magnitude o f the largest indirect effect (i.e.. through OBSE and continuance 

commitment. P = .29) was large enough to suggest that this effect is worth looking for in 

future studies with larger sample sizes.  The only mediating variable to have a significant, 

negative, direct relationship with turnover intentions was OBSE (P = -54).  Additionally. 

OBSE  demonstrated a significant indirect relationship with turnover intentions,  with the 

strongest mediated path through continuance commitment (P = -.40).

Model  Summary

As  found in Study  1. POS was significantly related to each o f the mediators and 

had significant mediated paths to many o f the dependent variables.  Specifically,  in 

support o f Hypotheses 5a and 5b there were significant mediated paths between  POS and 

affective and continuance commitment mediated by OBSE.  Also, in support o f 

Hypothesis  7a. there was a significant mediated relationship between POS and affective 

commitment mediated by organization-based self-concept.  In contrast to the results of 

Study  1. employee sense o f obligation did not emerge as a significant predictor o f 

employee attitudes.  As such, no support was found  for Hypothesis 3  in Study  2. 

Organization-based self-concept was the strongest m ediator o f POS effects  for affective 

and normative commitment in Study  1.  However,  in Study 2 OBSE had the strongest 

mediated relationship between each o f the commitment variables.  The results o f both 

studies thus clearly demonstrate the value of including self-related variables as 

mechanisms underlying the effects o f POS.

Comparison o f Study  1  and Studv 2

Figure 5 compares the standardized direct path coefficients from Studies  1  and 2. 

The bold coefficients are from Study  1.  There was high similarity in the relationships 

between  POS  and the three mediators (i.e.. sense o f obligation. OBSE and organization- 

based self-concept).  Particularly.  POS  was highly, positively related to each of the three 

115

mediators.

However, there are some differences between the two studies in the relationships 

between the mediators and the outcome variables, most noticeable with OBSE.  This 

difference may be due to differences  in multicollinearity between the two studies, 

particularly  in the correlation between OBSE and organization-based self-concept. 

Nonetheless, the differences in the magnitude o f the coefficients are small and.  in most 

cases,  not likely to be significantly different. There may also be theoretical reasons  for the 

differences  in coefficients between the two studies.  For example, as expanded upon  in 

the  Discussion, the participants in Study 2 may have been prevented  from engaging in 

social exchange relationships, thus there may have been reason to expect substantial 

differences in the two samples in the relationships between employee sense of obligation 

and the outcome variables.  Additionally, where differences appear in the significance o f 

the path coefficients between the two studies it is  likely due to the differences in sample 

size in the studies, and thus the power to detect significance.  In support o f this idea, 

notice that  for the most part, where the path is significant in one study  but not in the 

other, the significant path was found  in Study  1.

CHAPTER V 

DISCUSSION

Eisenberger.  Huntington. Hutchinson, and Sowa (1986) defined the construct of 

perceived organizational support (POS) as the employee's belief that the organization is 

committed to the employee.  A  large amount o f research  has subsequently  focused on the 

antecedents and consequences o f high levels o f POS.  However, to date,  research has only 

examined one underlying explanatory mechanism for POS effects, specifically, social 

exchange.  The primary contribution o f the current research is to develop a theory and 

empirically test a model o f alternative, self-related mediators of the effects o f perceived 

organizational support on the organizational outcomes o f commitment, turnover 

intentions and job performance.

The following sections discuss the results  from tests o f the hypothesized model 

and their consequences  for the interpretation and integrity of the proposed model.  The 

contributions o f the model to the existing literature on organizational  support and the self 

are discussed along with possible future extensions o f the model.

Replication o f Previous Findings

Previous research has consistently  found a positive relationship between POS and 

affective commitment (Hutchinson.  1997). jo b  performance (Eisenberger et al..  1990: 

Orpen.  1994;  W ayne et al..  1997) and a negative relationship between POS and turnover

intentions (Guzzo. Noonan. & Elron.  1994).  The current study replicated these  findings.

118

Specifically.  Study  1  and Study 2 both found a positive relationship between POS  and 

affective commitment (P =  .76. Study  1: p = .59 Study  2). with a total o f 78% (Study  1) 

and  71% (Study  2) o f the variance in affective commitment accounted  for by the model. 

Additionally, a positive relationship was found between POS and job performance (P = 

.45).  with a total o f 21%  o f the variance in job performance accounted for by  POS. 

Finally, there was a negative relationship between POS and turnover intentions (P  = -.42. 

Study  1:  p = -.41. Study 2). with a total of 42% (Study  1) and 47%  (Study 2) o f the 

variance accounted  for by the total  model.

Further, previous  work has found that exchange ideology  moderates the 

relationship between POS and various outcome variables (e.g..  Eisenberger et al..  1986: 

Orpen.  1994).  Although  not formally included in the hypothesized model, exploratory 

analyses  investigated the  moderating effects of exchange ideology on the relationship 

betw een POS comm itm ent, turnover intentions and job performance.

In Study  1  the exploratory analyses  investigating the relationship between  POS 

and the three  forms o f commitment and turnover intentions did not find a moderating 

effect for exchange  ideology. 

In Study 2. the interaction term  for POS-exchange 

ideology was significant  for affective commitment (P = -.181. p =  .08). such that the 

relationship between  POS and affective commitment was stronger when exchange 

ideology was  low.  No other evidence was found for moderating effects of exchange 

ideology.  There are two potential reasons for this non-significant  finding.

First, and m ost compelling, is that the previous research that has  found a 

moderating effect o f exchange  ideology has focused on behavioral outcome variables

(e.s.. absenteeism.  Eisenberger et al.,  1986; work, effort. Orpen.  1994).  A close 

examination of the Exchange Ideology questionnaire (Eisenberger et al..  1986) shows 

that, the  items  focus on the exchange o f effort and work for organizational rewards.  As 

such,  it may be that the wording o f the items favors exchange ideology relationships with 

behavioral outcomes but not attitudinal outcomes.  This may explain the lack o f a 

moderating relationship in the current study.  There may have been a non-significant 

relationship between exchange ideology and the attitude variables (i.e.. commitment and 

turnover intentions) because o f the measures insensitivity to those types o f constructs. 

Further, the non-significant relationship with job performance (i.e.. a behavioral outcome) 

may be due to (1) the nature o f field studies that produce nonoptimal distributions o f 

independent and m oderator relationships, the low sample size in this study, and thus,  low 

power to  find the moderated relationship. (McClelland & Judd.  1993) or (2) the low 

variance of the variable due.  potentially, to the supervisor's unwillingness to differentiate 

among their employees or to the nature o f the profession which limits the degree to which 

the supervisors are witness to employee job performance.  With a larger sample and 

reduced  leniency error on the job performance measure, the relationship between POS 

and job performance may have been moderated by POS.

Tests o f Newly Proposed Hypothesized Paths 

The hypothesized  model introduced several additions to the theoretical and 

empirical  research on POS.  These include (1) the introduction o f employee sense of 

obligation as a mediator o f POS effects. (2) the modeling of self-structures as mediators 

o f POS effects. (3) the inclusion o f moderating effects o f exchange ideology on the  POS-

employee sense o f obligation relationship, and (4) the inclusion o f moderating effects of 

level  o f self-construal on the POS-mediator relationships.

Mediated Effects o f POS on Attitudes and Performance 

In general the mediated portions o f the hypothesized model received support as 

evidenced by the non-significant x: test of model  fit in Study  1  and the high fit statistics 

and  low errors  found in both Study  1  and Study 2.  POS was  found to be positively related 

to each o f the three hypothesized mediators:  employee sense o f obligation, organization- 

based self-esteem, and organization-based self-concept.  Furthermore.  POS demonstrated 

mediated relationships with affective, normative, and continuance commitment and job 

performance, but not with turnover intentions.  Table  18 summarizes and compares the 

indirect effects of POS on the outcome variables for both Study  1  and Study 2.

Employee Sense o f Obligation

Based on principles o f social exchange, or the perceived need to reciprocate when 

one has benefitted  from a social  relationship, the model hypothesized that employee sense 

of obligation to the organization would mediate the relationship between POS and 

outcome variables.  Study  1  found that employee sense o f obligation mediated the 

relationship between POS and normative commitment, a form o f commitment based on 

moral  obligations to the organization and coworkers.  However,  in  Study 2. employee 

sense o f obligation did not emerge as a mediator o f any the POS-outcome relationships.

The  lack o f a mediating role for employee sense o f obligation in Study 2 may be 

due to sample characteristics.  Specifically, the Study 2 sample was drawn from 

employees in the health care industry.  Members o f this industry are under a moral

professional code o f conduct that prevents them  from providing inferior service to any 

person.  In other words, these em ployees may not be able to alter their level o f work effort 

in response to unsupportive treatm ent from the organization.  As a consequence,  for this 

sample, employee sense o f obligation may not emerge as a mediator of the POS-outcome 

relationship.  This possibility  should be investigated  in subsequent tests o f the model. 

Specifically,  future tests o f the model should explore the possibility that professional 

norms regarding social exchanges are a limiting factor o f the theory.

Self-Structures

Based on motivations for self-consistency and group welfare, two self-structures 

(OBSE and organization-based self-concept) were posited to mediate the relationship 

between  POS and employee attitudes and behavior.  In Study  1. organization-based self- 

concept was the most prominent mediator o f the relationship between POS and affective 

and continuance commitment.  In contrast, in Study  2. OBSE was the significant mediator 

of these  relationships.

The difference in which self-structure was more important in mediating the effects 

in Study  1  versus Study 2 may be due to two factors.  First, the relationship between 

OBSE and organization-based self-concept was much higher in Study  1  (<£ =  .59) than in 

Study 2  (d> =  .37)  introducing potential collinearity  issues.  Second, the organization used 

in Study 2 has. within the past several years, acquired many smaller organizations which 

provided the same services. Consequently, many o f the employees and supervisors  feel 

alienated  from the organization and often feel higher loyalty to their former employers 

than to the organization.  Therefore it is possible that some o f the employees may not

123

have identified themselves as members o f the organization because of social- 

psychological  factors preventing identification with the social group. For example. 

Ashforth and  Mael (1989) suggested that identification with the organization would be 

greater w hen the organization possessed (1) distinctiveness. (2) prestige, and (3) outgroup 

saliency.  To the extent that the organization in Study 2 lacked these characteristics, its 

employees would fail to identify with the organization.  This possibility' suggests the need 

to  investigate organizational and  individual history as  potential  limiting factors  for the 

current model o f POS.

Comparison o f Mediated Relationships in Studv  1  and Studv 2

It was hypothesized that the effects o f POS on affective,  normative and 

continuance commitment, turnover intentions and job performance would be mediated by 

employee sense o f obligation. OBSE and organization-based self-concept.  A close 

examination o f Table  19 reveals several  interesting patterns in the mediated effects of 

POS on commitment, turnover and job performance within and across Study  1  and Study 

2.  Although generally supportive, the pattern o f relationships was not uniform across ail 

outcome  variables, especially in Study  1.  Additionally, there were meaningful differences 

in the pattern o f coefficients  for continuance commitment across studies.  These patterns 

are discussed  in the next few paragraphs.

First, within Study  1. there was an unexpected, but in retrospect, intuitive, pattern 

of relationships among the mediators and the outcome variables.  Specifically, the effects 

of POS on normative commitment were primarily mediated through employee's sense o f

obligation, but the relationship between POS and other forms o f commitment were due 

124

primarily to  self-related mechanisms.

Each o f these mediated relationships are logical.  First, affective commitment has 

often been described as the employee's loyalty based on emotional commitment and the 

degree to  which the employee incorporates the organization's goals and values into one's 

own value structure (Porter et al..  1874).  Here it was found that the link between support 

and affective commitment was the strongest through the mechanism emphasizing the 

incorporation o f the organization's prototypical characteristics into the self-concept. 

Therefore,  it may be that the mediated relationship between support and affective 

commitment reflects the desire to maintain consistency between conceptualizations o f the 

self as congruent with the organization and one's commitment emphasizing emotionality 

and adoption o f the organization's values.

Second, normative commitment reflects the desire to remain with the organization 

due to moral  obligations to the organization.  The results o f the tested model suggested 

that the relationship between POS and normative commitment is due to an increased 

perception o f being obligated to the organization because of benefits and rewards 

received (i.e..  Employee Sense of Obligation). Thus,  it may be that the  link between 

support and normative commitment is due to social exchange motivations while the link 

between support and affective commitment may be due to motivations to maintain 

consistency between the self-concept and one's attitudes and behavior.

In contrast to the other two forms o f commitment, continuance commitment 

reflects the em ployee's commitment due to the high cost o f leaving the organization.

125

Previous research has consistently found a non-significant relationship between support 

and this form o f commitment.  Here, as well, there was no direct relationship between 

these two variables.  However, there is a significant indirect relationship between support 

and continuance commitment by way o f the self-concept. This  link may occur if 

organizational  support, working through the self-concept,  forces the  individual to see the 

current organization as the only option for maintaining perceptions o f the self.

This pattern o f mediated relationships was not replicated in Study 2. In Study 2. 

employee sense o f obligation did not mediate the relationship between POS and any o f 

the outcome variables.  Again, the reasoning for this may be due to the professional 

responsibilities  for the employees in Study 2.  These employees are not able to modify 

their attitudes and behaviors on the basis o f social exchanges.  This rationale provides an 

explanation  for why employee sense o f obligation does not mediate the relationship 

between POS  and any o f the outcome variables in  Study 2.

A second interesting pattern o f results involves the indirect relationship between 

POS  and continuance commitment across Study  1  and 2.  While the total  indirect 

variance accounted  for in the other dependent variables is approximately equal across 

Study  1  and 2. there is a large difference in variance accounted  for and the total  indirect 

coefficient for continuance commitment (see Table  19).  Specifically,  in Study  1. the total 

indirect relationship between POS and continuance commitment was positive (T = .30) 

and  in Study  2  it was negative (T = -.58).  This pattern may be due to the non-normal 

bimodal distribution o f continuance commitment in Study 2.  it may also be due to the 

characteristics o f the sample and the primary explanatory mechanism  for this effect in

126

Study 2.  Specifically, the effects o f POS on continuance commitment are mainly 

through OBSE.  Thus, when high POS  increases the self-esteem o f these individuals they 

feel empowered and competent and perceive that they have the skills and abilities 

required to  find work outside o f the organization if required.  As such, they may perceive 

that they have little to lose from leaving the organization because they are able to 

maintain their high self-esteem within another organization.

Moderating  Effects of Exchange Ideology 

The model hypothesized that the relationship between POS and employee sense of 

obligation to the organization would be moderated by the strength o f the individuals 

endorsement o f exchange ideology (i.e.. the belief that effort should be exchanged for 

reward).  However,  in both Study  1  and Study 2.  exchange ideology did not account for a 

significant am ount o f variance in employee obligation as a main effect, nor as an 

interaction term with POS.  Therefore, exchange ideology did not moderate the POS- 

obligation relationship as hypothesized.

The reason  for the non-significant moderating role o f exchange ideology may  be 

the characteristics o f the sample.  As discussed above, the moral code o f some 

professions  may prevent the employee from acting in ways consistent with endorsement 

of exchange  ideology.  This reasoning is especially relevant for Study 2. where the 

emergency  response professional  is professionally bound to deliver high quality care 

regardless o f norms o f social exchange or commitment from the organization.  The same 

rationale explains the non-significant direct and mediating effects o f employee sense of 

obligation to the organization in Study 2.  More problematic,  if moral code is responsible

for the non-significant moderation, is why Study  1  did not provide evidence o f 

moderation for exchange ideology.  The answer may be due to the  fact that the 

participants in Study  1  came from multiple industries -  some o f which may hold moral 

professional codes and some which do not.  And thus, averaging across the industries 

127

may nullity  the effects o f exchange ideology.

Moderating  Effects o f Level of Self 

Overall, the results o f Study  1  and 2 provide mixed support for the moderating 

effects o f level  o f self-construal.  In Study  1. the relational self was a significant 

moderator o f the POS-OBSE relationship, with an alpha probability  level o f .10.  Also, 

the collective  level o f self significantly moderated the POS-organization-based self- 

concept relationship, with an alpha probability level of .10.  However. Study 2 does not 

support the hypothesized moderating effects of any of the three levels o f self-construal.

The initial argument o f the model was that the level at which the self is 

chronically construed will  impact the manner in which the individual  is  influenced by 

perceptions o f organizational support.  It may be. however, that the work environment 

fundamentally alters the level at which the self is construed.  In effect, the work 

environment may prime the employee to adopt a level o f self that normally would not be 

activated. This  is the same line o f reasoning used by other researchers to explain the 

effect of environmental context on saliency o f personal and group characteristics (e.g.. 

Banaji &  Prentice.  1994; Turner et al..  1994).  In sum. there is no  instance when the 

environmental context does not influence the self-construal. and as such, it must always 

be considered when measuring the level at which the self is construed.

To date, the majority o f the research of the level o f self-construal has been 

conducted on the differentiation o f the personal self from the interpersonal self (Triandis. 

1989) with only recent investigations into  the division o f the interpersonal self into the 

relational and collective level (Brewer & Gardner.  1996  ).  Further, the measurement of 

these constructs has been focused on the most general  level and has yet to be narrowed to 

the self-at-work dimension.  Use o f a context-specific measure o f level o f self-construal 

(i.e.. work) may uncover the moderating effects o f level o f self on the POS-mediator 

relationship.

Limitations o f Current Studies and Directions for Future Research

There are  limitations that restrict the interpretation o f the results.  First, due to the 

correlational nature o f Studies  1  and 2. causation cannot be inferred from the results.  As 

such, a longitudinal design would be required before any assumptions can be drawn about 

the causal effects o f POS on the mediators or outcome variables.  Future research should 

examine the  longitudinal effects o f POS. especially during orientation periods when the 

employee first develops perceptions regarding the organization and its concern for the 

employee's well-being.

Likewise,  because o f the exclusive use of a survey methodology, and because the 

primary source o f data was the employee, there was the potential  for relationships to 

emerge due to  factors other than the constructs under investigation.  Most troubling was 

the  possibility that observed relationships were due to method bias -  that is. 

measurement-induced distortion in responses resulting  from participant social 

desirability, evaluation apprehension, consistency in responding, negative affectivity. and

other cognitive processes (Cook & Campbell,  1979;  Krosnick.  1999;  Schmitt.  1994). 

Although there is general consensus that the distorting  effects o f method bias cannot be 

completely eliminated, the use o f second sources o f data (e.g., supervisor or peer 

provided measures) can reduce the concern over method-induced effects.  Thus, the use 

o f supervisor provided data and the observed relationship between POS. employee sense 

o f obligation. OBSE. and organization-based self-concept with job performance reduced 

concern over method bias.

Second, the role o f LMX should be investigated, especially given the influence 

this construct has had on understanding the effects o f social exchange on job performance 

.  Previous work has found that the relationship between POS and job performance 

disappears when tested within a multivariate, structural framework including LMX 

(Settoon. et al.:  Wayne et al.,  ).  In other words. POS. while significantly correlated with 

in-role performance, shares substantial variance with LMX.  The multicollinearity 

between POS and LMX makes it difficult to find significant effects for POS  when LMX 

is also  in the model.  Some support can be offered for this  line o f reasoning.  Specifically, 

while not used in other tests o f the model, a measure o f  LMX was obtained  from the 

Study  2  sample.  The  latent correlation between LMX and POS was  = .72. suggesting a 

substantial amount o f shared variance between the two  constructs.  Future expansions on 

the model  should investigate the theoretical and empirical  role o f LMX.

Third, the comments  from respondents in Study 2 regarding their unwillingness to 

compromise patient health due to personal  feelings toward the organization (i.e.. 

unwillingness to  lower work effort under conditions o f low POS). led to concerns over

the generalization o f the results to other populations.  It may be that the particular 

mediator that emerges as most important depends, not as much on level o f self-construal. 

but on the norms o f the industry and occupation.  Thus,  for some professions, social 

exchange may be the primary mechanism for the effects o f POS  while for others it may 

depend more on the role o f self-related variables.  For example,  in organizations where 

the pace of w ork efforts impact the self more than the organization (e.g.. commission- 

based sales) social exchange may not emerge as a mediator because a reduction in efforts 

would damage o ne's own standing.  However, in organizations where one's actions 

impact the organization without being detrimental to the self, social exchanges may again 

play a role.  For example, in Study  1  the majority o f respondents were in the non­

commissioned sales or food service industry, and were thus able to adjust work effort 

without (1) compromising moral professional standards or (2)  impacting the self 

financially or emotionally.  Future research should investigate the role that these  factors 

have on the emergence o f social exchange as a mechanism o f POS.  Specifically, 

organizations should be selected for inclusion in tests o f the model that differ only in 

terms of constraint on involvement in exchange based relationships.  For example,  in the 

automobile sales,  some dealerships base compensation mostly or entirely on commission, 

in other dealerships the salesperson's compensation is hourly or salary.  Structural 

equation models could then test whether the same model work for both organizations by- 

constraining the path models to be equal or whether the organizations differ in the 

mediating  function o f employee sense o f obligation by freeing that path.

Additional efforts should also be given to investigating the role o f level of self- 

construal on the relationship between POS and the mediating variables.  Although the 

results o f the current studies were disappointing, the pattern o f moderation for relational 

and collective self-construal in Study  I  are worth further investigation.  Specifically,  it 

was  found that the relationships between POS and OBSE and  POS and organization- 

based self-concept were stronger to the extent that the relational and collective self- 

construals were high, respectively.  However, the main effects of self-construal  were such 

that at low levels o f POS. people with high relational or collective selves had lower levels 

o f OBSE or organization-based self-concepts.  It may be that level o f self-construal 

makes people more sensitive to information that is counter to their self-beliefs.  For 

example, people with high collective self-construal may be more sensitive to messages 

that they  belong to the group, and when they receive messages that they are not valued 

members (i.e..  low POS) they react against group membership in a more extreme manner 

than  individuals who do not have collective self-construals.

Finally, there is some concern that multicollinearity may  have produced some o f 

the non-significant relationships among employee sense of obligation. OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept and the outcome variables.  This concern is  limited 

though, because the strongest latent correlation among the three mediator variables was <j> 

=  .59 (OBSE-self-concept in Study  1) indicating only a moderate amount o f overlap 

among the constructs.  Nevertheless, this issue should be addressed in future replications 

o f the model.  Additionally, the relatively small sample size o f Study 2 may  have 

produced unstable coefficient estimates in the  SEM analyses and may have reduced the

ability to detect moderating effects.  However, the similar pattern o f results  in Study  1 

limit this concern.  However, again, the model should be replicated using a larger sample 

o f employees across an array o f occupations.

Contributions to the Literature 

Many theories o f social exchange have been developed to explain the 

reciprocation o f work effort for compensation.  Prominent among these is A dam s'  (1965) 

equity  theory .  According to this influential theory, employees calculate the ratio o f 

contributions to the organization to the benefits received from the organization. 

Employees seek to achieve a balanced ratio o f inputs and outcomes and will adjust their 

work effort in order to strike a balance, or achieve equity.  While Adam's theory dealt 

primarily  with economic exchange and the one-sided actions o f the employee, other 

theorists (e.g..  Blau.  1960) addressed the social  nature o f exchange and the reciprocation 

between the organization and the employee.  These ideas are reflected in Eisenberger's 

treatm ent o f social exchange as the underlying mechanism o f POS.  To date, research on 

the mechanism s underlying the effects o f POS have relied solely on social exchange 

principles.  Specifically, research has examined social exchange in (1) the moderating 

effects o f exchange ideology on the POS-outcome relationship and (2)  in comparison 

with other exchange-based constructs (e.g.,  leader-member exchange:  Settoon.  Bennet & 

Liden.  1996).  Although self-structures play an implicit role  in exchange-based theories 

(e.g..  the extent to  which one has high self-esteem is likely to effect the value one places 

on one  s contributions to the organization and subsequently, the amount o f benefits one 

will expect in return), no theories have explicitly incorporated self-structures into models

o f exchange relationships, including POS.  Inclusion o f self-structures is important for 

understanding the on-going nature o f social relationships.  For example, by design, when 

and individual  has benefitted from another and reciprocates, the exchange is complete and 

the relationship ends. Nevertheless, em ployees stay with organizations even during 

downsizing,  pay  freezes and other unfavorable events.  Social exchange would predict 

that employees would exit once the bonds o f the reciprocation were severed.  However, 

the employee-employer relationship is relatively stable suggesting that employees may 

also  be bound by  notions of self tied to the organization.

Additionally,  in today's labor m arket most employees are not dependent on any 

particular organization for compensation.  Rather, employees are able to shop among 

employers and chose those organizations that offer better "exchange rates.” leaving 

organizations to  face ever-increasing labor costs in order to entice employees into 

remaining with the organization.  However, if employees come to identify and develop a 

sense of self-valuation tied to the organization because of organizational  support, 

organizations may  be able to reap the sam e benefits derived from social exchanges 

without the same monetary cost.  The current model  makes three specific contributions 

that further the  literature's understanding o f why and how POS may be able to have these 

effects and influence organizationally-relevant variables.

First, exchange ideology has been  found to moderate the relationship between 

POS and em ployee attitudes and behaviors  in previous research and this relationship has 

been used as evidence o f a social exchange basis  for the effects o f POS.  However, social 

exchange principles have not been modeled as a mediator of the effects o f POS.

Establishing the mediating role o f social exchange is o f paramount importance in order to 

definitively state that social exchange underlies the effects o f POS.  One o f the primary 

contributions o f this study was to clearly demonstrate the mediating function of social 

exchange on the  POS-outcome relationship.

The current research developed a measure o f the employee's sense o f obligation to 

the organization due to social exchange and modeled it as one mediator o f the effects o f 

POS on the outcome variables.  Employee sense o f obligation to the organization was 

measured as the employee's felt debt to the organization because o f monetary and social 

rewards that have been received.  This construct differed from previous 

conceptualizations o f social exchange (e.g.. exchange ideology) because it specifically 

targeted feelings o f obligation to the employing organization when one has benefitted 

from membership in the organization, rather than generalized notions that one should 

reciprocate  when one has benefitted from a social  relationship.  This construct did indeed 

mediate the effects o f POS  in Study  1. demonstrating that social exchanges are one of the 

underlying reasons why POS influences attitudes and behavior and not just an individual 

difference v ariable that strengthens the relationship.

Second, although Eisenberger's conceptualization of POS  is based solely on social 

exchange and the norm of reciprocity, there are several reasons to suspect that the effects 

of POS are due  in part to the em ployee's self-structure.  Previous literature on the self has 

consistently  found that individuals will act in ways that confirm beliefs about the self 

(Swann and  Read.  1981).  Thus, when the organization induces the employee to perceive 

the self in certain ways, the individual will act in ways that maintain, or verify the self.

135
Based on this reasoning, the current model tested the mediating role o f self-esteem based 

on messages o f competency from the organization.

Likewise, researchers studying the self-concept have  found that when the self is 

defined in terms o f the social group, the individual will act in ways that protect the social 

groups (Brewer & Gardner.  1996). Thus, the expanded model o f POS tested for the 

mediating  function o f organization-based self-concept in explaining the relationship 

between POS and commitment, turnover intentions and job performance.  The current 

model presented a rationale  for the addition o f two self-structures (OBSE and 

organization-based self-concept) as mediators of the POS-outcome relationship.

Strong support was found for the mediating effects o f OBSE and organization- 

based self-concept in both Study  I  and Study 2.  This finding advances current 

understanding o f POS which has given little consideration to the role o f the self in 

explaining the effects o f organizational support.

Finally, the results o f Study 2  indicate a potentially  fruitful avenue for building 

upon the current model.  Specifically, employee sense o f obligation failed to emerge as a 

significant m ediator o f POS.  While it is difficult to make any absolute conclusions due to 

the small sample  size,  it is possible that the poor results o f employee sense of obligation 

may be due to the profession o f the employees included  in the sample.  This raised  issues 

over the need to explore profession as an important factor in the POS-outcome 

relationship.  As discussed above, various professions may be limited  in their ability to 

act in terms o f a social exchange, and thus the self-structures become more important in 

explaining the effects o f POS.

CHAPTER VI 

SUMMARY

Perceived organizational support (POS) has been defined as the belief, on the part 

o f the employee, that the organization values and cares  for the employee's well-being 

(Eisenberger.  Huntington.  Hutchinson. & Sovva.  1996).  Based on norms o f reciprocity 

and social exchange.  Eisenberger and colleagues theorized that when employees believe 

that they  have benefitted from the organization, they feel obligated to repay the 

organization by way of increased loyalty and work effort.  Evidence for the social 

exchange basis  for the effects o f POS has been demonstrated in the relationship between 

POS and employee behaviors moderated by exchange  ideology (Eisenberger et al..  1986: 

Orpen.  1994).  These findings suggest that the relationship between  POS and 

organizationallv-relevant variables is stronger when employees believe that they should 

exchange work effort for rewards.

However, there are problematic issues with previous empirical and theoretical

studies on the effects o f POS:  (1) social exchange has not been empirically tested as a

mediator o f the relationship between POS and employee attitudes and behavior, and (2)

social exchange does not readily explain the effects o f POS on employee attitudes and

behavior that do not repay the organization (e.g.. job satisfaction and work stress).  Thus.

a model  was proposed that predicted three mediators o f the effects o f POS: (1) employee

sense o f obligation to the organization, based on the concept o f social exchange. (2)

organization-based self-esteem (OBSE)? based on motivation for self-consistency, and (3) 

organization-based self-concept, based on motivations for self-consistency and group 

welfare.  The model proposed a relationship between POS and employee sense o f 

obligation,  moderated by the em ployee's endorsement o f exchange ideologies.  Also, the 

model  hypothesized that the mechanism (obligation. OBSE. and organization-based self- 

concept)  which has the strongest role is determined by the employee's level o f self- 

construal.

Study  1  administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires to employed university 

students  measuring:  POS (Survey o f Perceived Organizational Support:  Eisenberger et 

al..  1986): exchange ideology (Eisenberger et al..  1986): employee sense o f obligation: 

OBSE (Pierce et al..  1989): organization based self-concept (Identification with 

Psychological Groups. Mael & Tetrick.  1992): Twenty  Statement Test (Kuhn & 

McPartland.  1954): affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative 

commitment (Meyer. Allen. &  Smith.  1993). and turnover intentions (Cammann. 

Fichman. Jenkins. &  Klesh.  1983).

Results partially support the hypothesized model.  Specifically, the relationship 

between  POS and normative commitment was mediated most strongly by employee sense 

of obligation, while the relationships between POS and affective and continuance 

commitment were more strongly mediated by organization-based self-concept and OBSE. 

Exchange  ideology did not moderate the relationship between POS and employee sense 

of obligation.  Finally, the moderating effects o f the level o f self-construal  were 

significant for the relational and collective levels.

Study 2 administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires modified from Study  1  to 

emergency medical technicians and paramedics.  Additionally, the direct supervisors of 

the target respondents were contacted and asked to complete a job performance measure 

and modified versions of the above mentioned variables.  Results were similar to those 

found in Study 2.  The major difference between the studies was that Employee Sense of 

Obligation  failed to emerge as a significant mediator o f the effects o f POS.  This failed 

relationship may be due to the characteristics o f the healthcare profession that prevented 

employees  from altering work effort when the employee perceives  low organizational 

support.  This finding suggests that the relationship between POS and employee attitudes 

and behavior for some professions may not be due to social exchange, but instead depend 

on motivations for self-consistency and group welfare.

In conclusion, while the moderating effects oflevel o f self did not follow the 

predicted pattern, the overall results o f the two studies  indicate the value o f including 

self-related  variables as mediators o f the POS-outcome relationship.  The unique pattern 

of mediating effects  found in Study  1  emphasize this value.  Without the  inclusion of the 

sell-related variables, the indirect effects o f POS on continuance commitment would not 

have been  uncovered.  Future research should investigate the effects o f POS on additional 

attitudinal  and behavior outcomes as mediated by obligation. OBSE. and self-concept. 

Additionally,  future directions  include the investigation o f industry and profession as 

limiting  factors in the model o f the effects o f POS.
