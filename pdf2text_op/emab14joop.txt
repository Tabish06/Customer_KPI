Employees have limited personal time to engage in activities that enable them to recover
from a demanding work environment and perform at a high level. To evaluate the
importance of non-work creative activity, we conducted two studies that examine the
relationships between non-work creative activity, recovery experiences, and perfor-
mance-related behaviours at work. Study 1 included employees who provided self-rated
performance-related outcomes, whereas Study 2 included employees with other-rated
(co-workers and subordinates) performance-related outcomes. Creative activity was
positively associated with recovery experiences (i.e., mastery, control, and relaxation) and
performance-related outcomes (i.e.,
job creativity and extra-role behaviours). The
mediating effects of recovery experiences were examined to better understand the
underlying processes involved in the relationship between creative activity and perfor-
mance-related outcomes. Creative activity was found to have both indirect effects and
direct effects on performance-related outcomes, but the effects varied by the type of
performance-related outcome. The results indicate that organizations may beneÔ¨Åt from
encouraging employees to consider creative activities in their efforts to recover from work.

Practitioner points
 Organizations should increase employee awareness of the beneÔ¨Åts of creative activity on recovery.

Many companies already provide information to employees regarding the importance of speciÔ¨Åc
activities (e.g., eating habits, exercise) on physical health. Information on activities that inÔ¨Çuence
recovery ‚Äì a psychological health consequence ‚Äì should be included in the informational resource
provided to employees.
 Organizations may consider professional development opportunities for employees that involve

creative activities while away from work. Creative activities are likely to provide valuable experiences
of mastery and control, but may also provide employees experiences of discovery that uniquely
inÔ¨Çuence performance-related outcomes. Opportunities used by large organizations, such as Zappos
Inc., include employees bringing their artwork to work to decorate their ofÔ¨Åces. Other options include
memberships to art studios, creative writing resources, and access to musical instruments.

Most employees would likely agree that they highly value their personal time because of
the opportunity to engage in activities that rebuild resources lost while working. To
achieve a state of recovery or recovery experiences, employees engage in (or avoid) an
array of activities (Sonnentag, 2003), such as playing sports, cooking, watching television,
and engaging socially with others (Sonnentag & Zijlstra, 2006). There is increasing
empirical evidence that recovery experiences from activities during one‚Äôs personal time
result in lower perceived job stressors and strain (Etzion, Eden, & Lapidot, 1998;
Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007; Sonnentag, Kuttler, & Fritz, 2010), greater life satisfaction
(Lounsbury & Hoopes, 1986), and improved job performance-related outcomes
(Binnewies, Sonnentag, & Mojza, 2010; Fritz & Sonnentag, 2005; Fritz, Yankelevich,
Zarubin, & Barger, 2010).

Although organizational researchers have explored many non-work activities associ-
ated with recovery experiences, no research has directly explored the effects of creative
activity while away from work. The dearth of organizational research on the relationship
between creative activities and employee recovery experiences is surprising because
creative activity has often been believed by clinical and counselling psychologists to play a
role in recovery from mental health issues, enrich one‚Äôs life, increase personal well-being,
and improve performance in other life domains (Baer, 2012; GrifÔ¨Åths & Corr, 2007;
Ivcevic, 2007; M‚Ç¨ullersdorf & Ivarsson, 2012; Richards, 1990). Personality theorists, such
as Carl Rogers, have also expressed creativity as being an essential element to optimal
human functioning (Rogers, 1963).

A better understanding of the importance of non-work creative activities on employee
recovery experiences and performance-related behaviours will enable organizations to
increase employee awareness of activities that are likely to facilitate effective recovery
from work. Greater awareness of beneÔ¨Åcial activities is essential because people are
unable to spend all of their personal time on activities that have a recovery effect
(Sonnentag, 2001). The current study builds off of the resources often associated with
creativity to empirically examine how creative activities Ô¨Åt within the recovery
experience model (Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007) that has recently dominated organizational
research. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we examine the mediating effects of recovery experiences on the
relationship between creative activity and performance-related outcomes.

Theoretical models
Conservation of resources theory (COR; Hobfoll, 1989), effort-recovery model (Meijman
& Mulder, 1998), and theory of dynamic performance (Beal, Weiss, Barros, & MacDermid,
2005) are complementary theories that describe the importance of leisure activities on an
employee‚Äôs recovery from work and capability of expending effort towards work. COR
(Hobfoll, 1989) is based on the assumption that people strive to obtain, retain, and protect
their resources. In the context of the work environment, COR implies that the demands of
the work environment threaten individual resources. In turn, individuals will strive to
restore and protect their resources by investing resources into activities while away from
work. The effort-recovery model (Meijman & Mulder, 1998) describes the behavioural,
psychological, and physiological response to expending effort towards one‚Äôs work.
Overcoming work demands to accomplish tasks and be a high-contributing employee
requires the use of valuable mental and physical resources, which result in resource
depletion and a need for recovery (Sluiter, van der Beek, & Frings-Dresen, 1999). Recovery
from work occurs when work demands are removed and the person can engage in
activities that are very low in cognitive demands and allows the person to return to their


BeneÔ¨Åting from creative activity

581

baseline level of functioning. Similarly, the theory of dynamic performance (Beal et al.,
2005) suggests that job performance depends upon whether the employee can allocate a
maximum amount of resources to a task. To effectively regulate the allocation of resources
during work, it is crucial for employees to restore and preserve resources during their off
time.

Each of the models emphasizes the importance that leisure activities do not further
deplete the resources necessary to complete one‚Äôs job successfully. Rather, the resources
expended to engage in leisure activities should either restore the resources lost during
work or protect against further resource loss while an employee is not working. In sum, a
leisure activity can positively affect performance-related behaviours at work if the leisure
activity provides resources that are pertinent to resources necessary to complete the work
behaviour. To understand the potential
importance of creative activity on perfor-
mance-related outcomes,
it is necessary to identify the resources creative activity
provides.

Creative activity and recovery experiences
Creative activity while away from work may be a leisure activity that provides employees
essential resources to perform at a high level. Creativity has been debated either to be a
process that involves the exploration of new cognitive pathways and connection of
previously unrelated thoughts (Koestler, 1964) or as a product that is novel, appropriate,
and surprising (Bruner, 1962). Regardless of the deÔ¨Ånition used, creativity can be diffused
in a variety of daily activities, such as doing crafts, decorating a living environment, solving
everyday problems, using humour, and structuring leisure time activities (Murdock &
Ganim, 1993; Runco & Bahleda, 1986; Torrance, 1988). Creative activities are not limited
to common conceptualizations of art, such as painting or music (Ivcevic, 2007). Because
many activities have the potential for being creative for the actor, this study examines
creative activities while away from work broadly (e.g., I engage in creative activity)
without speciÔ¨Åc reference to a medium or type of creative act.

The notion that creative activity provides important resources to a person that can spill
over into other life domains has received considerable attention by social and personality
psychologists (Baer, 2012; Ivcevic, 2007; Kaufman & Baer, 2005; Mayer, 1999). Creative
activity within a single domain is believed to provide resources that enrich one‚Äôs life,
increase personal well-being, and improve performance in other life domains (Baer, 2012;
Ivcevic, 2007; Richards, 1990). Organizational researchers have recognized the impor-
tance of creative activity on recovery from work by including creative activity when
assessing leisure activities in some cases. However, either the creative activity measure
was not included in the analyses (Sonnentag, 2001) or creative activity was only one of
several different activities within a scale assessing a broad range of leisure activities
(Winwood, Bakker, & WineÔ¨Åeld, 2007). Unfortunately, these efforts do not shed light onto
speciÔ¨Åc beneÔ¨Åts of creative activities on recovery experiences and the spillover to the
work environment.

To evaluate recovery from work and resource acquisition, organizational researchers
most often rely on assessing resource-laden experiences. Recovery experiences most
commonly include mastery, control, detachment, and relaxation (Sonnentag & Fritz,
2007). Mastery (e.g., taking a class) is a recovery experience that is characterized by
non-work activities that distract from the job and provide experiences of being challenged
and the opportunity to learn new skills (Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007). Mastery experiences are
likely to result in recovery because they may lead to the acquisition of several internal


582 Kevin J. Eschleman et al.

resources such as skills, competencies, and self-efÔ¨Åcacy (Hobfoll, 1989), as well as foster
positive mood (Parkinson & Totterdell, 1999). Creative activity involves the use and
development of domain-speciÔ¨Åc knowledge, skills, and abilities (Amabile, 1983), which is
similar to a mastery experience. Writing poetry, for example, likely results in the
development of one‚Äôs lexicon or improvement of one‚Äôs ability to articulate thoughts.
Thus, both creative activity and mastery experiences likely provide valuable resources
such as skills, abilities, and competency beliefs that may spill over into the workplace.

Control is characterized by a person‚Äôs ability to choose an activity during leisure time
(Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007). Experience of control during leisure time provides important
resources of self-efÔ¨Åcacy and feelings of competence. Experiences of controllability occur
when people believe that they can inÔ¨Çuence outcomes (Byron, Khazanchi, & Nazarian,
2010). Because creative activity is often characterized by producing a unique outcome
(Amabile, 1983), creative activity is likely to result in greater perceived control over
outcomes. It is important to note that control is also believed to be a prerequisite to
creative activity ‚Äì providing a bidirectional relationship. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, creative activity
requires a sense of freedom from external constraints (Einstein, 1949). Thus, both creative
activity and control experiences are likely to provide valuable resources such as
competency beliefs.

Detachment from work is the process that allows an employee to mentally disengage
his/herself from work (Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007). In other words, detachment is an
employee‚Äôs sense of being away from the work environment (Etzion et al., 1998). For
example, an employee who is inundated and pre-occupied with work emails and job
activities while they are engaging in social activities is unlikely to be detached. Whereas
mastery and control provide resources to an employee, detachment experiences may be
best described as protecting the employee from additional resource loss. Creative activity
involves becoming absorbed within the activity (Golann, 1963), which may enable a
person to forget about other life domains that are irrelevant to the act, such as the work
environment. Thus, creative activity and detachment may enable an employee to protect
from further resource loss due to the work environment.

Relaxation is characterized by a state of low activation and increased positive affect
(Stone, Kennedy-Moore, & Neale, 1995). Activities that may facilitate relaxation include
walks through a beautiful area (Hartig, Evans, Jamner, Davis, & Garling, 2003), listening
to music (Pelletier, 2004), or meditation (Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach,
2004). Creative activity is believed to have a bidirectional relationship with positive
affect (Frederickson, 2001). That is, using an alternative method to complete a task can
result in positive affect (e.g., joy); positive affect can also enable a person to think more
broadly and consider creative opportunities. Creative activity may also involve a
cathartic release of intense negative emotions (Akinola & Mendes, 2008; Talerico, 1986).
Although intense negative emotions are experienced during the creative activity, the
cathartic release provides a positive affective state after the creative activity is
completed. Thus, creative activity and relaxation are likely to provide valuable resources
such as positive affect.

Although we expect positive relationships between creative activities and the four
recovery experiences, it is important to note that direction of causality is inconclusive.
Theoretical models on recovery experiences often describe leisure activities as a causal
source to the underlying recovery experience, which in turn spills over into the work
environment (Sonnentag, 2003; Sonnentag & Zijlstra, 2006). However, we recognize that
recovery experiences and resources are needed to engage in creative activity. COR
(Hobfoll, 1989) describes how people with greater amounts of resources are more

capable of acquiring additional resources and protecting from future resource loss. This
implies a bidirectional
process, which is described as a positive resource spiral,
relationship between actions and resources. This study does not
incorporate a
longitudinal design to evaluate bidirectional relationships; we rely on prior theoretical
models to describe a causal direction of leisure activities affecting recovery resources. In
sum, we hypothesize that creative activity will be positively associated with mastery,
control, detachment, and relaxation experiences because of the shared resources
acquired or the protection of further resource loss.

Hypothesis 1: Creative activity will be positively associated with mastery, control,

detachment, and relaxation experiences.

Creative activity and performance-related outcomes
Creative activity is likely to be associated with performance-related outcomes in part due
to the expected relationship with recovery experiences. That is, we believe that creative
activity provides recovery experiences (see Hypothesis 1) that can be subsequently
transferred to performance-related behaviours in the workplace. As noted in COR,
effort-recovery model, and the theory of dynamic performance, employees engage in
activities that help them acquire and protect resources, which in turn help them put effort
towards tasks in a demanding work environment. Creative activities in a speciÔ¨Åc life
domain (e.g., non-work) are likely to spill over into behaviours in other life domains
(Ivcevic, 2007). The positive spillover is believed to occur when the resources (e.g., skills)
acquired from a creative activity in one domain are also relevant to the other life domain.
Indeed, daily creative activity is believed to be used by people to help solve problems a
person is experiencing in other aspects of life (Richards, 1990). In other words,
employees may engage in creative activity in an effort to cope with the job. If we presume
that creative activity leads to the acquisition or protection of resources (Hypothesis 1),
it is necessary to establish that recovery experiences will affect performance-related
outcomes.

Several performance-related outcomes have been empirically examined in relation to
recovery experiences, such as performing duties prescribed in one‚Äôs job description (task
performance), effort expenditure towards tasks (Fritz & Sonnentag, 2006), proactive
behaviour (Fritz et al., 2010), active learning, job creativity (de Jonge, Spoor, Sonnentag,
Dormann, & van den Tooren, 2012), and performing duties not prescribed in one‚Äôs job
description (extra-role performance; Binnewies et al., 2010). In general, recovery
experiences are positively associated with performance-related outcomes, but the effects
vary between studies.
Inconsistent relationships are commonly found with task
performance; relationships vary between non-signiÔ¨Åcant (Binnewies et al., 2010;
Sanz-Vergel, Demerouti, Bakker, & Moreno-Jimenez, 2011), signiÔ¨Åcant positive correla-
tions (Shimazu, Sonnentag, Kubota, & Kawakami, 2012), and a curvilinear relationship
(Fritz et al., 2010).

Recovery experiences are likely to have more consistent relationships with perfor-
mance-related outcomes that are more volitional. Employees commit resources to
performance behaviours most valued by an organization (Mangos, Steele-Johnson, LaHuis,
& White, 2007), which is likely task performance. As a result, effective recovery
experiences are likely to determine whether an employee has a surplus of resources to
commit to less valued behaviours. Job performance is a multidimensional construct that
includes both task performance and volitional behaviours such as organizational
citizenship behaviours (OCB) and job creativity (Campbell, 1990). OCB (Lee & Allen,


584 Kevin J. Eschleman et al.

2002) are the extra-role behaviours; employees engage in that are not explicitly part of
their job description, which include praising the organization, helping co-workers with
tasks or problems, and building and preserving interpersonal relationships (Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000; Van Dyne & LePine, 1998). Job creativity is the act of
taking risks and thinking of alternative solutions to work problems (Zhou & George,
2001).

Recovery experiences are signiÔ¨Åcantly related to OCB and taking initiative (Binnewies
et al., 2010). Similarly, recovery experiences are associated with effort expenditure
2 weeks after vacation (Fritz & Sonnentag, 2006). There is less research directly
examining the relationship between recovery experiences and job creativity. No
relationship is found between detachment and job creativity (de Jonge et al., 2012), but
other recovery experiences were not assessed. The generally positive relationship
between recovery experiences and performance-related outcomes leads us to expect that
creative activity will be positively associated with performance-related outcomes through
the mediating processes of recovery experiences.

Creative activity may also have a direct effect on performance-related outcomes
because of the acquisition and protection of resources not captured within the current
recovery experience model. Creative activity is likely to result in a discovery experience,
which can result in resource gain and protection from further resource loss. Creative
activity involves a change in perspective through the act of discovery (Amabile, 1983;
Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). Similarly, creative activity may lead to the experience of
increased intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997), which is the enjoyment of an
activity because of an opportunity to explore and actualize a person‚Äôs potential (Ryan &
Deci, 2000). The experience of discovery and intrinsic motivation is not fully captured
within the recovery experience model despite self-enhancement and growth being
recognized as a resource within COR (Hobfoll, 1989). That is, discovery and intrinsic
motivation may lead to personal resources (e.g., self-esteem, self-efÔ¨Åcacy) and protect
from future resource loss by changing one‚Äôs perception of future tasks. A greater sense of
control can be associated with a change in perspective (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), but the
perceptual shift will not necessarily involve the act of discovery that is at the core of
creativity. A similar argument can be made for mastery, which does not necessarily involve
the act of discovery.

Job creativity and OCB are likely to require resources associated with discovery
experiences and intrinsic motivation. Job creativity requires a willingness to behave
differently from one‚Äôs behavioural script and identifying new ways to complete tasks
(Zhou & George, 2001). Engaging in OCB is also linked to intrinsic motivation. For
example, employees were more willing to act on a desire to help others when they were
high in intrinsic motivation (Grant, 2008). Because creative activity is likely to lead to
unique resource acquisition and protection through discovery experiences, we expect
creative activity to be positively associated with performance-related outcomes and the
relationship will be partially mediated by recovery experiences.

Hypothesis 2: Creative activity will be positively associated with performance-related

outcomes (i.e., job creativity, OCB).

Hypothesis 3: The relationship between creative activity and performance-related
job creativity, OCB) will be partially mediated by

outcomes (i.e.,
recovery experiences.

Method

Sample and procedure

Study 1
Participants were recruited using the StudyResponse Project (The StudyResponse
Project, n.d.). The StudyResponse Project database consists of over 80,000 people who
are willing to be participants in online questionnaire-based research and has been used to
recruit participants in several published studies (Bowling & Eschleman, 2010; Judge, Ilies,
& Scott, 2006; Piccolo & Colquitt, 2006). In this study, participants were compensated
with 10 dollars in gift cards to an online store. Data were collected in two waves separated
by approximately 1 month. Creative activity, recovery experiences, and openness to
experience were assessed in Wave 1, whereas performance-related outcomes were
assessed in Wave 2. A total of 83% of the people (N = 341) to whom the survey was
originally sent responded and provided useable data for both waves. Participants held a
wide variety of occupations within the United States (e.g., 30% managerial, 10% education,
8% accounting, 6% administration support), worked an average of 40 hr per week, had an
average job tenure of 10 years, and were an average of 37 years old, and 50% were women.

Study 2
Study 2 was conducted to replicate the Ô¨Åndings of Study 1 using subordinate and
co-worker ratings of performance-related outcomes in an applied setting. We obtained
data of 92 active duty captains from the United States Air Force who were required to
participate in an incentivized 6-week leadership development programme. All Air Force
captains are required to participate in the leadership development programme prior to
their promotion as part of their career progression. Captains complete a survey prior to
entering the programme, which includes demographic information. The researchers
included an assessment of creative activity and recovery experiences within this survey
with the note that the information would not be used as part of their evaluation within the
programme. Performance assessments of the captains were also obtained for programme
evaluation purposes. To evaluate performance, the training programme contacted
randomly selected subordinates and co-workers of the participating captains via email and
ensured participants that the performance evaluations would remain conÔ¨Ådential and
only reported in an aggregate feedback format to the captain being rated. The speciÔ¨Åc job
responsibilities of an Air Force captain varied because of organizational placement.
However, top-performing captains in all placements are expected to acquire skills in
creative performance and OCB, as these skills are important for their rise in rank to major.
In addition, because Air Force ofÔ¨Åcers generally change positions and roles every 2 years,
captains are expected to be highly adaptable and to solve problems they have not
previously encountered. Thus, feedback on the performance criteria assessed in Study 2 is
highly valued by participating captains. The sample was 73% men and an average age of
31 years. All participants had a bachelor‚Äôs degree, and 88% had some form of graduate
school experience.

Measures

Recovery experiences
Participants in both Study 1 and Study 2 rated how often they had several recovery
experiences during their personal time over the past 30 days. The response options were


586 Kevin J. Eschleman et al.

on a 5-point scale and ranged from (1) ‚Äòrarely‚Äô to (5) ‚Äòvery often‚Äô. Mastery (e.g., ‚ÄòI learned
new things‚Äô), control (e.g., ‚ÄòI decided my own schedule‚Äô), detachment (e.g., ‚ÄòI forgot about
work‚Äô), and relaxation (e.g., ‚ÄòI kicked back and relaxed‚Äô) were each assessed with four
items from the Recovery Experiences Questionnaire (Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007). The alpha
reliabilities for recovery experiences ranged from .90 to .95 and .87 to .96 for Study 1 and
Study 2, respectively.

Creative activity
We piloted nine items amongst 250 people working at least 20 hr per week to develop the
creative activity measure. Three items were selected that showed adequate psychometric
properties and face validity. Participants in both Study 1 and Study 2 rated how often they
had engaged in creative activity during their personal time over the past 30 days.
Response options were on a 5-point scale and ranged from (1) ‚Äòrarely‚Äô to (5) ‚Äòvery often‚Äô.
The three items for non-work creative activity were the following: ‚ÄòI took part in creative
tasks‚Äô, ‚ÄòI used the time to explore my creative side‚Äô, and ‚ÄòI expressed myself creatively‚Äô.
The alpha reliabilities for creative activity were .94 and .88 in Study 1 and Study 2,
respectively.

Performance-related outcomes
For both Study 1 and Study 2, performance-related outcomes were examined using
assessments of
job creativity and OCB. Study 1 included self-ratings of perfor-
mance-related outcomes. Study 2 included ratings from subordinates (n = 49) and
co-workers (n = 43). Participants rated how often they (Study 1) or their supervisor/
co-worker (Study 2) engaged in the behaviours at work over the past 30 days.
Response options were on a 5-point scale and ranged from (1) ‚Äòrarely‚Äô to (5) ‚Äòvery
often‚Äô. Measures of job creativity (Zhou & George, 2001), OCB directed interpersonally
(OCB-I), and OCB directed towards the organization (OCB-O; Lee & Allen, 2002)
included 8 items each. The job creativity measure (e.g.,
‚ÄòCome up with creative
solutions to job problems‚Äô) had an alpha reliability of .92 and .68 for Study 1 and Study
2, respectively. The OCB-I measure (e.g., ‚ÄòGo out of the way to make others at work
feel welcome‚Äô) had an alpha reliability of .93 and .76 for Study 1 and Study 2,
respectively. The OCB-O measure (e.g.,
‚ÄòDefend the organization when other
employees criticize it‚Äô) had an alpha reliability of .91 and .89 for Study 1 and Study
2, respectively.

Personality
Study 1 included an assessment of openness to experience that was used as a control
variable. Because creativity and personality may be closely linked (Amabile, 1983; Feist,
1998), it is important to control for one‚Äôs disposition to engage in creative activity when
exploring the relationship between creative activities in multiple life domains. Openness
to experience was selected as a control variable because it is the strongest predictor of
creativity amongst the Ô¨Åve-factor model personality traits (Feist, 1998). Openness to
experience was assessed during Wave 1 using the average of four items (Donnellan,
Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006) on a 7-point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly
agree (7). An example item is ‚ÄòI believe in the importance of art‚Äô. The alpha reliability for
the openness scale was .78.

Results

Model building
ConÔ¨Årmatory factor analyses were conducted using the larger sample in Study 1. Two
Ô¨Åt statistics were used to determine model Ô¨Åt, the root mean square residual (SRMR),
and the comparative Ô¨Åt index (CFI) as per Hu and Bentler (1999), although the
chi-square and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) are also reported. We
ran an 8-factor conÔ¨Årmatory factor analysis with creative activity, each recovery
experience, job creativity, OCB-I, OCB-O, and openness items loading onto distinct, but
covarying, latent factors. The model had adequate Ô¨Åt with v2(413, N = 341) = 990.60,
p < .001, SRMR = .06, CFI = .94, and RMSEA = .06. We also compared the 8-factor
model with different models that had the creative activity items load onto one of the
remaining factors. No other model tested had adequate Ô¨Åt. For example, the second
best-Ô¨Åtted model had creative activity items loading onto the same latent factor as
openness, but Ô¨Åt the data worse than the 8-factor model, Dv2(Ddf = 6) = 391.16,
p < .05.

We used structural equation modelling to assess the mediating effects of
recovery experiences on the relationship between creative activities and perfor-
mance-related outcomes. Separate mediation models were tested for each of the
performance-related outcomes. Structural paths were added from creative activity to
each recovery experience and from each recovery experience to the perfor-
mance-related outcome. The partial mediation model also included a structural path
from creative activity to the performance-related outcome, whereas
the full
mediation model constrained this path to be zero. We used a chi-squared difference
test to determine whether the partial mediation or full mediation model Ô¨Åt the data
best. For both Study 1 and Study 2, partial mediation models were selected for the
job creativity and OCB-I models, whereas full mediation model was selected for
OCB-O.

SRMR = .06, CFI = .93, RMSEA = .06),

In regard to Study 1, a measurement model with covarying latent variables was
examined prior to building partial and full mediation models. In an attempt to control
personality inÔ¨Çuences of creativity, openness to experience was allowed to covary
with all variables in the structural models. The measurement models Ô¨Åt the data

p < .01,
N = 341) = 1001.66, p < .01, SRMR = .06, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .06. The partial
mediation model had adequate Ô¨Åt for job creativity, v2(442, N = 341) = 1066.09,
p < .01, SRMR = .06, CFI = .93, RMSEA = .06, and Ô¨Åt the data better than the full
mediation model, Dv2(Ddf = 1) = 14.32, p < .01. The partial mediation model had
adequate Ô¨Åt for OCB-I, v2(442, N = 341) = 1036.43, p < .01, SRMR = .06, CFI = .93,

Figure 2. Study 2 mediating the effects of recovery experiences on the relationship between creative
activity and performance-related outcomes. Standardized path coefÔ¨Åcients are presented for three
models. a = Model included job creativity. b = Model included OCB-I. c = Model included OCB-O.
The path coefÔ¨Åcients between creative activity and each recovery experience were the same for all three
models.

p < .01), control (b = .40, p < .01), and relaxation (b = .22, p < .01), but not associated
with detachment (b = .05, p > .05). The same pattern of results was found using data
from Study 2. Creative activity was positively associated with mastery (b = .42, p < .01),
control (b = .41, p < .01), and relaxation (b = .22, p < .01), but not associated with
detachment (b =  .14, p > .05).

Creative activity and performance-related outcomes
Full support was found for Hypothesis 2 as creative activity was positively associated
with all three performance-related outcomes in both Study 1 and Study 2. Partial
support was found for Hypothesis 3 because the positive relationships between
creative activity and performance-related outcomes were not consistently mediated by
recovery experiences. In regard to Study 1, creative activity had positive direct effects
on job creativity (b = .33, p < .01) and OCB-I
these
relationships did not include indirect effects through recovery experiences. No direct
effects were present for creative activity on OCB-O because a full mediation model Ô¨Åt
the data best, but an indirect effect of creative activity on OCB-O was found through
control experiences. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, creative activity was positively associated with
control (b = .40, p < .01), which in turn was positively associated with OCB-O
(b = .19, p < .05).

A similar pattern of results was found for Study 2. Creative activity had a positive direct
effect on job creativity (b = .35, p < .01) and OCB-I (b = .25, p < .05), but these
relationships did not include indirect effects through recovery experiences. No direct
effects were present for creative activity on OCB-O because a full mediation model Ô¨Åt the
data best, but an indirect effect of creative activity on OCB-O was found through mastery
experiences. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, creative activity was positively associated with mastery
(b = .42, p < .01), which in turn was positively associated with OCB-O (b = .32,
p < .05). In sum, creative activity had direct effects on job creativity and OCB-I and an
indirect effect on OCB-O.

Discussion

Creative activity and recovery experiences
The current study examined mediating effects of recovery experiences on the
hypothesized relationship between creative activity and performance-related outcomes.
Based on COR, effort-recovery model, and theory of dynamic performance, creative
activities were expected to increase the acquisition of resources or help protect from
further resource loss. In turn, the acquisition and protection of resources would enable
employees to engage in more performance-related behaviours. Partial support was found
for Hypothesis 1, which predicted creative activity to have positive relationships with
recovery experiences. Similar results were found in both Study 1 and Study 2. Creative
activity was positively associated with mastery, control, and relaxation experiences, but
not signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with detachment.

The positive relationships with recovery experiences are likely because creative
activity provides the acquisition of resources, such as the development of skills (Amabile,
1983), beliefs of inÔ¨Çuencing outcomes (Byron et al., 2010), and the experience of positive
affect (Frederickson, 2001). The non-signiÔ¨Åcant relationships between creative activity
and detachment were surprising because creative activity involves absorption into the
task (Golann, 1963). These results indicate that creative activities are not likely used to
protect from further resource loss by detaching from work. Rather, people may choose to
engage in creative activities that are similar to experiences at work, which prevents
detachment because of the shared knowledge, skills, and abilities. A wedding photog-
rapher, for example, may engage landscape photography as a creative activity. The
non-signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between creative activity and detachment may also be
because creative activities are used as a cathartic release of work strain. An employee may
play/write songs, for example, that describe the demands or strain experienced during
work. Overall, the results indicate that creative activities are associated with several
recovery experiences and likely an important activity in the employee recovery process.

Creative activity and performance-related outcomes
Creative activity was expected to be positively associated with performance-related
outcomes, in part due to the mediating effects of recovery experiences. A similar pattern
of results was found in both Study 1 and Study 2. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, employees
who reported greater levels of creative activity were also rated (by themselves and
others) as higher in job creativity, OCB-I, and OCB-O. However, only partial support for
Hypothesis 3 was found because the positive relationships were not consistently
meditated by recovery experiences. The underlying processes for these positive


BeneÔ¨Åting from creative activity

relationships varied by performance-related outcome. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, creative activity had
direct effects on job creativity and OCB-I, but no indirect effects through recovery
experiences. Creative activity had indirect effects on OCB-O through a single recovery
experience, but no direct effects. Although the results do not fully support our hypothesis,
there is considerable consistency across the two studies.

The direct effects of creative activity on job creativity and OCB-I are likely because
creative activity provides a unique recovery experience not accounted for by the current
recovery experience model. Creative activity may provide an experience of discovery and
growth, which includes the discovery of new cognitive pathways (Amabile, 1983;
Csikszentmihalyi, 1997; Ivcevic, 2007; Sarnoff & Cole, 1988) and intrinsic motivation
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). The presence of only direct effects for job creativity and OCB-I
indicates that these performance-related behaviours are most affected by the unique
resources associated with creative activities rather than the common recovery
experiences.

The consistent lack of direct effects for OCB-O is a surprising Ô¨Ånding. Study 1 and Study
2 differed in the mediating recovery experience, but were consistent in that only one
recovery experience fully mediated the effects of creative activity. Control was the
mediating recovery experience in Study 1, whereas mastery was the mediating recovery
experience in Study 2. This may be because mastery and control share many of the same
resources acquired (e.g., self-efÔ¨Åcacy), as indicated by the moderately strong correlation
between the two variables. The consistent lack of direct effects of creative activity on
OCB-O indicates that the unique resources associated with creative activity (e.g.,
discovery experiences and intrinsic motivation) are not essential to engaging in OCB-O.
Employees targeting an organization with OCB may have different motives compared to
when OCB target co-workers. Employees seeking to help an organization, for example,
may engage in the behaviours instrumentally (e.g., to obtain a promotion) rather than for
intrinsic purposes of learning and growth. Instrumentality is believed to inÔ¨Çuence OCB
(Haworth & Levy, 2001; Organ, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, 2006), but there is no prior
research examining whether instrumentality is more likely in OCB-O compared with
OCB-I. Overall, creative activity was consistently associated with performance-related
outcomes, but the current recovery experience model may not always account for these
positive relationships. Creative activity may provide a discovery experience that leads to
the acquisition and protection of resources. The unique resources, in turn, inÔ¨Çuence some
performance-related outcomes.

Future research and limitations
Although organizations may beneÔ¨Åt from fostering creative activity amongst their
employees, additional research is needed to understand why creative activity is associated
with high ratings of performance-related outcomes. To address this limitation, future
research should examine effects of creative activity on other outcomes (e.g., task
performance, state of feeling recovered, energy, effort) and control for other potentially
relevant individual difference antecedents. Also, it is important for future researchers to
empirically identify the unique experience associated with creative activity to better
understand the underlying processes involved in the relationship between creative
activity, recovery experiences, and performance-related outcomes. Although we
expected creative activity to be associated with performance-related outcomes, we did
not expect recovery experiences to have inconsistent or negative (i.e., detachment)
associations with performance-related outcomes. These Ô¨Åndings indicate that the

resources acquired through creative activity may be more transferable across life domains
than mastery, control, detachment, and relaxation experiences. Mastery, for example,
may result in a new set of skills and task-speciÔ¨Åc self-esteem, but these new skills may not
be useful in the job environment. Creative activities, on the other hand, may result in a
cognitive shift from discovery that is less domain speciÔ¨Åc. Unfortunately, the current
study is limited in not assessing a discovery experience variable as a potential mediator.
Another explanation for the consistent positive relationships between creative activity
and performance-related outcomes is due to a methodological limitation. It is possible that
creative activity has more long-term effects than other recovery experiences. Several
researchers have proposed that recovery experiences may have the strongest effect
immediately following the recovery experiences (Sonnentag & Natter, 2004; Trougakos,
Beal, Green, & Weiss, 2008; Westman & Eden, 1997). As a result, the consistent Ô¨Åndings
for creative activity may not be found when examining the predictive validity over time
(e.g., experience sampling). Future research should examine the effects of creative
activity and recovery experiences longitudinally over various time frames.

Longitudinal research will also enable researchers to more accurately infer the
direction of causality between creative activity and the other study variables. Although
leisure activities are generally believed to lead to a state of recovery and a change in work
variables (Sonnentag, 2003; Sonnentag & Zijlstra, 2006), it is possible that recovery
experiences enable a person to engage in more creative activities. For example, people
with more control over their leisure schedules may be able to choose a creative activity.
Similarly, it is possible that employees with higher ratings of job creativity and OCB have
the resources and abilities to engage in creative activity, which implies a causal effect from
performance-related outcomes to creative activity. The use of a quasi-experimental or
experimental design may also enable researchers to better infer causality. Future research
should examine whether manipulations of creative activity can result in changes in
recovery experiences or performance-related outcomes. Researchers, for example, may
recruit participants whom are about to begin a craft/art workshop during their personal
time, which is likely to provide an increase in creative activity. Alternatively, researchers
may pay participants to engage in more creative activities. We caution against this later
strategy as it may inÔ¨Çuence the discovery experience and intrinsic motivation of the
creative activity, which may be vital to the relationship between creative activity and
performance-related outcomes. The need for experimental research with non-work
activities and recovery experiences will not only test the generalizability of the Ô¨Åndings
but also improve the practical
implications for organizations. More speciÔ¨Åcally,
experimental research involving a manipulation of recovery strategies will enable
organizations to become more conÔ¨Ådent in designing programmes that are likely to foster
a speciÔ¨Åc recovery experience.

Practical implications
The current study has important practical implications for organizations: programme
development, programme evaluation, and employee awareness. Unfortunately, develop-
ing and evaluating organizational programmes to foster recovery experiences has
received little research (Hahn, Binnewies, Sonnentag, & Mojza, 2011). Organizations may
consider implementing programmes that encourage creative activity. Large organizations,
such as Zappos Inc., incorporate employee artwork into ofÔ¨Åce decorations. Other similar
activities commonly found in organizations include food cook-offs, cross-discipline
education opportunities, and costume contests during holidays. A more cost-effective and

less intrusive approach for organization is to inform employees that creative activity may
help them recover from the workplace. Employees are unable to spend all of their
personal time on activities that help them recover from work (Sonnentag, 2001) so greater
awareness of the most beneÔ¨Åcial activities is likely to be well received by employees.
Increasing employee awareness also enables the organization to avoid directly interfering
with their employees‚Äô private life.

Summary
Two studies on recovery experiences and performance-related outcomes were con-
ducted using varying methodological approaches. Creative activity was found to be
positively associated with mastery, control, and relaxation experiences. In addition,
creative activity was consistently associated with performance-related outcomes. The
processes underlying this relationship were examined by testing the mediating effects of
recovery experiences. Creative activity had unique direct effects on job creativity and
OCB-I after accounting for potential mediating effects of recovery experiences. Creative
activity did not have unique direct effects on OCB-O, but did have indirect effects through
recovery experiences (either mastery or control). These results indicate that the current
recovery experience model does not account for all underlying experiences involved in
creative activity.
