Abstract. The results of this study show that there is a positive and 
significant relationship between  excess  market value of  multina- 
tional  corporations  and  the  degree  of  international involvement 
as measured by  foreign sales percentage. However, the excess mar- 
ket value is not  determined by the number of foreign subsidiaries, 
nor the interaction between foreign sales and the number of foreign 
subsidiaries. The relationship between excess market value and the 
two  frequently  used measures of monopoly  power-concentration 
ratio and the  Lerner Index-was  also examined. This study found 
that the Lerner Index contributes significantly in explaining excess 
market value  but  concentration ratio does not.  Furthermore, the 
positive and significant coefficients  of advertising and R&D  inten- 
sity  serve as evidence that product market imperfections appear to 
play a bigger role in explaining the excess market value experienc- 
ed by MNCs during our sample period. 

INTRODUCTION 

A number of motivations have been assigned to the corporate international 
operations  of  multinational  corporations.'  Many  extant  theories  on 
foreign  direct investment recognize the  existence  of  imperfections in  the 
product  or  factor  market.  It  is argued by  some  that multinational firms 
invest abroad because they  obtain monopolistic  advantages and hence can 
generate higher profits  than those  achieved by  local  competitors.  Others 
argue that real asset diversification is the major motivation for investing in 
foreign countries.2  The empirical evidence regarding the benefits to share- 
holders  of  multinational  corporations  (MNCs) arising from international 
diversification is, however, inconclusive. Agmon and Lessard (1977)  found 
that  the  higher  the  degree of  an MNC's international involvement,  the

lower its market-assigned measure of systematic risk. Jacquillat and Solnik 
(1978),  on  the  other hand, concluded  that investing in multinationals is a 
poor substitute to international portfolio  diversification. 
Recently,  Errunza and Senbet  (1981,  1984)  investigated the  existence  of 
monopoly  rents associated with international operations in a market-value 
theoretic  framework. They  argued that  advantages arising from interna- 
tional  operations, if  any, would be "priced-out" in a rational and efficient 
market,  and  therefore  an  investigation of  the  rates of  return realized by 
shareholders of  MNCs will  not  capture  the  monopolistic  rents  for  the 
MNCs. In the spirit of Errunza and Senbet, we investigate the determinants 
of  the  excess  market value of  multinational corporations. To the  extent 
that  multinational  corporations possess  the monopolistic  power to  com- 
pete  with  local  competitors,  it is expected that the excess market value of 
MNCs is determined by  the intensity  of  R&D  expenditures and of adver- 
tising  efforts,  which  are believed to  be the  fountainhead of  the  creation 
and maintenance of product market imperfections. 

EXCESS MARKET VALUE OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS 

This note  empirically assesses the  effect  of international operations in the 
market-value theoretic  framework. As in  Errunza and Senbet  (1981),  we 
make no  a priori specification  of the structure of the international capital 
market,  nor  do  we  postulate  the  degree of  international  capital market 
integration.  We only  rely  on  the  functioning  of  the  U.S.  capital market 
and focus on U.S.-based multinationals' excess market valuation. We relate 
the  excess  market valuation to  the  degree of  the  MNCs' international in- 
volvement.  The  basic  generalized relationship  which  serves as  an under- 
pinning for the model is 

VMNC =  VD +VF 

(1) 
That is,  the  value  of  a multinational firm, VMNC, has two  components: 
VD  which  represents  the  present  value  of  cash inflows  from  domestic 
operations  and  VF  which represents the  capitalized value of  the  interna- 
tional  operations.  The  hypothesis  we  want  to  test  is  whether there is  a 
positive  relationship between  market value  (VMNC)  and degree of  inter- 
national involvement  (DI), holding other variables constant.  Since it is not 
such an easy  task to hold constant other variables which influence market 
value, we  deflate the  market value of  firms by  a common yardstick. The 
common  yardstick  we  employ  in  this  study  is  the replacement costs  of 
assets. As we  divide equation  (1)  through by  R, the  replacement costs of 
the assets in place, we have the Tobin's q expression.3 

VMNC=  VD+VF

then  the  current market value of  MNCs will be a positive function of the 
degree of  international involvement. Furthermore, extensive expenditure 
on  advertising and R&D  may create imperfections in the product market, 
such  as entry barriers, thus enhancing the  ability of  firms to  earn mono- 
poly  rents.  Mueller  and  Rogers  (1980),  for  instance,  found  that  ad- 
vertising creates and maintains product differentiation, which may lead to 
entry  barriers. Grabowski and  Mueller (1978)  and Branch (1974)  found 
that firms in  research-intensive industries earn significantly above-average 
returns. We also include measures of  future growth opportunities and of 
monopoly  power.  Thus, we  express  the  functional relationship between 
Tobin's q and its explanatory variables as follows.4 

qMNC =  qMNC(DI,A,RD,G,MP) 

(3) 

where DI  =  degree of international involvement for an MNC 

A  =  intensity of advertising expenditures 
RD=  intensity of research and development expenditure 
G  =  expected growth rate as measured by past growth 
MP =  proxy for monopoly  power 

METHODOLOGY 

Data Sources 
Four  major  publications  that  report  foreign  involvement  measures are 
used. The  Standard and Poor's "Outlook"  and Forbes report foreign sales 
figures. Moody's  Directory  of  Corporate Affiliation  and  Dun  and Brad- 
street's  Corporate Families  and  International  Affiliates  list  the  foreign 
affiliates  of  U.S.-based MNCs. The  1972  Census of  Manufactures is used 
for  data on  monopoly  power.  The Standard and Poor's Compustat Indus- 
trial Tape is utilized  for  all the  other  firm-specific variables in  the  model 
specification. 
This study  uses three different measures of  foreign involvement, namely, 
(1) Foreign Sales as a percentage of total sales (FS), (2) Number of foreign 
affiliates  (NOFA),  and  (3)  FS x NOFA,  an interactive term.5  The study 
also employs  the two most commonly used measures of monopoly  power, 
namely,  (1)  The  four-firm concentration  ratio  (CON) which is  based on 
the value of  shipments of the four largest firms in its industry, and (2) the 
Lerner Index  (LI)  which  is  the  percentage difference between  price and 
marginal cost.6 
The empirical work covers the  sample period from  1974-1978.  There are 
154  firms in  the  sample  with  complete  data for any of  the  years in  the 
sample period. There are 458  observations in all. 

Tests and Results 

A  stepwise  regression procedure  called  the  maximum  R2  improvement 
technique  (MAXR) is used to  test  the  significance of  the variables in  the 


122 

JOURNAL  OF  INTERNATIONAL  BUSINESS  STUDIES,  SPRING  1986 

model.  MAXR calculates the  R2 improvement and the F-statistics reflect- 
ing each variable's contribution to the model if it were to be included. 
The  MAXR method  begins by  finding the  one-variable model  producing 
the highest R2.  It then adds another variable that would yield the greatest 
increase in  R2  by  comparing each variable with all other variables and do- 
ing all possible switches until  no  switch  could  increase R2.  The two-vari- 
able model  achieved is considered the "best" two variable model the tech- 
nique  can  find.  The comparing and switching process is repeated to  find 
the "best" three variable model, and so forth. 
For testing purposes, the model specification is given as a linear form 

V/R = q =ao + a  DI + a2 A+ a3 RD+ a4 G +a  MP+ e 

(4) 

As in  Thomadakis (1977)  and Errunza and Senbet (1981,  1984),  a proxy 
for q is employed in this note. Excess valuation (EV) of MNCs is calculated 
as the difference between the market value of  common equity and its book 
value, normalized by sales, i.e., 

EV  = 

market value of common equity -  net worth 

sales 

Thus, equation (4)  becomes 

EV =  ao + a1

(5) 

The second  DI proxy; NOFA, will be represented by the dummy variable, 
D, whereby it takes a value of one when the NOFA >  10, zero value other- 
wise.  The interactive DI proxy  will then become the product of FS and D 
(FSD).  The  proxy  for monopoly  power,  LI, is measured by  the  percent- 
age difference between sales and operating expenses.7 
The  test  results  for  equation  (4),  using  CON as  a  proxy  for  monopoly 
power, are presented in Table 1. The MAXR procedure entered RD first as 
the  best  one-variable model with R2 equal to  26.4%. As shown in the first 
panel, the  predicted power of  the  model  increased to  33.4% when G was 
included,  to  34.7% for A,  and to  35.6% for  FS.  The results indicate that 
the  excess  market value of  MNCs is more strongly determined by imper- 
fections  in  the  product  market arising from heavy advertising and R&D 
expenditures rather than from financial imperfection.

When the  Lerner Index is used as a proxy  for monopoly  power,  Table 2 
shows that the  LI enters the  model  first with  R2  equal to  49.7% for the 
best one-variable model. Thus, LI becomes the most important contributor 
to  the  explanation  of  the  excess  market value of  MNCs. The predictive 
power  of  the  model  improved significantly  when  LI is  used  instead  of 
CON. The behavior of the other variables is consistent with those in Table 1. 
With respect  to  the  proxies  for the  degree of  international involvement, 
the  signs  of  the  coefficients  are consistent  with  those  predicted  by  the 
model except  for the dummy variable, D, for NOFA, but only FS is signifi- 
cant.  As shown in  the  two  tables, when the DI proxy is introduced to the 
model, R2 improved only for FS, and not for D or FSD. 

CONCLUSION 

This  note  extended  earlier  work  on  the  benefits  of  corporate  multi- 
nationality  by  empirically examining whether the  excess  market value of 
multinational  corporations is  determined by  the  degree of  international

ployed  market  value  in  excess  of  book  value  normalized  by  sales  (EV)  as a 
proxy  for  the  premium  U.S.  investors  may  pay  for  MNCs. 
The  results  of  this  study  show  that  there  is  a positive  and  significant  rela- 
tionship  between  EV  and  the  degree  of  international 
involvement  as 
measured  by  foreign  sales  percentage.  However,  the  EV  is not  determined 
by  the  number  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  nor  the  interaction  between  foreign 
sales  and  the  number  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  The  relationship  between  EV 
and  the  two  frequently  used  measures  of  monopoly  power-concentration 
ratio  and  the  Lerner  Index-was  also  examined.  This  study  found  that  the 
Lerner  Index  contributes  significantly  in  explaining  EV  but  concentration 
ratio  does  not.  Furthermore,  the  positive  and  significant  coefficients  of 
advertising  and  R&D  intensity  serve  as  evidence  that  product  market  im- 
perfections  appear  to  play  a  bigger  role  in  explaining  the  excess  market 
value  experienced  by  MNCs during  our  sample  period.

5.  We thank  an  anonymous  referee  for  suggesting that  we  should  employ  alternative measure of 
international  involvement.  There  are other  measures of  international  involvement  such as foreign 
assets  and  foreign  earnings. We employ  the  number of  foreign  subsidiaries because  earlier studies 
indicated  that  foreign  earnings measure may not  be comparable due to  non-uniformity  of  account- 
ing methods.  Furthermore,  Errunza and  Senbet  (1981)  found  that these measures were not  signifi- 
cant in explaining MNCs' excess  market value. See Errunza and Senbet  (1981)  footnote  19.
