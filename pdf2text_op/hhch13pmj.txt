ABSTRACT  ■

INTRODUCTION ■

Based on a coproduction concept highlighted by
service-dominant logic, this study attempts to
understand the antecedents and consequences
of  user  coproduction  in  information  system
development projects. As a key contribution, we
posit  that  user  coproduction  is  influenced  by
social capital between users and developers; we
then postulate that user coproduction determines
the project outcomes. Paired data collected from
both  user  representatives  and  developers  by
using a survey approach was used to test pro-
posed  hypotheses.  The  results  showed  that
user  coproduction  has  a  positively  significant
influence on project outcomes, and social capi-
tal between user representatives and develop-
ers is also associated with user coproduction.

The management information system department of an organization

has long been considered a support function. In addition, informa-
tion system development (ISD) work is regarded as the crafting of an
artifact  to  support  business  operation.  ISD  is  viewed  as  a  process
through  which  developers  transform  users’  requirements  into  system
design. As a process for transforming users’ needs into a specific informa-
tion technology (IT) artifact, the complex nature of ISD projects raises diffi-
culties  in  fully  capturing  those  user  needs;  as  a  result,  many  ISD  projects
suffer high failure rates. The largest cause of problems is that final systems
do  not  meet  users’  desired  functionality  and  requirements. This  may  not
only lead to extra financial and time costs but also lower users’ satisfaction
(Procaccino & Verner, 2009; Wallace, Keil, & Rai, 2004a). It is important for
users to engage in the design, development, and implementation process to
ensure  that  it  meets  users’  needs,  to  avoid  delay  of  the  project  and  addi-
tional costs, to minimize the difficulties in effectively controlling the proj-
ect, and to maximize the value created (He & King, 2008; Ives & Olson, 1984;
Wallace et al., 2004a).

Recently, some studies urged researchers to view the information systems
(IS)  department  from  a  service  provider  perspective  (e.g.,  Jia  &  Reich,  2011;
Kettinger, Park, & Smith, 2009). As an internal service provider, the goal of the IS
department is to satisfy users’ needs through a simultaneous exchange of pro-
duction and consumption, transformation in the experience, and value (Rai &
Sambamurthy,  2006).  The  IS  department  aims  at  maximizing  values  of  cus-
tomers  through  providing  high-quality  service.  The  value  delivering  is  mainly
done  through  ISD.  The  above  idea  aligns  with  an  emerging  concept,  service-
dominant (S-D) logic, which views service delivering as a value-generating process
(Vargo  &  Akaka,  2009; Vargo  &  Lusch,  2008).  Service  delivery  in  a  knowledge-
intensive business area, such as ISD, is complicated, unstructured, and highly
customized. One important thing for the attainment of the clients’ specific goals
is active involvement in the projects of the clients themselves. S-D logic high-
lights  the  importance  of  coproduction  in  which  service  receivers  should  be
viewed as coproducers in the value-generating process. Customers become one
primary operant resource (in terms of competence or knowledge) that should 
be essential during the service-providing process (Vargo & Lusch, 2004). Their
contribution  to  the  service-delivering  process  is  as  vital  as  that  of  the  service
providers  for  the  maximization  of  the  value  delivered  (Bettencourt,  Ostrom,
Brown, & Roundtree, 2002). Customers should be more active in identifying the

most significant value to them as well as
in  helping  providers  to  customize  and
deliver the most appropriate service.

Through  applying  S-D  logic  in  an
ISD  context,  one  may  predict  that  the
quality of the final system is a function
of the extent to which users and system
developers  are  able  to  work  together
smoothly to coproduce a system capa-
ble  of  supporting  the  business  opera-
tion. Empirical studies have shown that
user coproduction benefits ISD project
process  performance  by  enhancing
knowledge  coproduction  and  coordi-
nation  between  developers  and  users
(Hsu,  Lo,  Lin,  &  Cheng,  2010;  Shim,
Sheu, Chen, Jiang, & Klein, 2010).

However,  two  major  issues  are
noticeable.  First,  it  is  important  for
project  performance  to  be  evaluated
through the two dimensions of process
and  product  (Nidumolu,  1995; Wallace
et  al.,  2004a).  While  process  perfor-
mance  evaluates  the  efficiency  of  the
development work, product performance
represents  the  actual  value  cocreated,
which  should  be  strongly  emphasized.
This indicates the importance of a multi-
dimensional evaluation of value cocre-
ation; therefore, in addition to process
outcome,  there  is  a  need  to  consider
product quality, such as system quality
and user satisfaction. This leads to our
first  research  question:  Can  coproduc-
tion  benefit  major  project  outcomes,
including  project  performance, system
quality,
satisfaction?
Furthermore,  given  the  importance  of
user coproduction, understanding how
to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  copro-
duction becomes a critical question to
address. Another objective of this study
is  to  explore  the  antecedents  of  user
coproduction in an ISD project, guided
by the following research question: Can
social  capital  between  users  and  devel-
opers affect coproduction?

user 

and 

Social capital perspective is adopted
because, by viewing the information sys-
tems developed as one type of intellectu-
al capital, the creation of such capital also
relies  on  the  maturity  of  social  capital
(Nahapiet  &  Ghoshal,  1998). We  further

argue that coproduction is a process that
users  and  developers  exchange  and  use
resources jointly to create new intellectu-
al capital. Because users and developers
are  two  major  stakeholders  in  ISD  proj-
ects,  social  capital  between  these  two
parties should play a critical role in boost-
ing  coproduction.  By  shedding  light  on
the above issues, this study is expected to
contribute to both academia and practi-
tioners.  For  ISD  project  management
research, we examine the importance of
user coproduction with respect to differ-
ent project outcomes and explore possi-
ble  antecedents.  For  practitioners,  this
study highlights the importance of treat-
ing  users  as  coproducers  and  provides
possible  guidance  for  promoting  copro-
duction between users and developers.

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.
The next section presents a brief review
of the extant literature on user partici-
pation,  user  coproduction,  and  social
capital,  whereas  the  third  section  pre-
sents  the  description  of  the  research
methodology  and  data  collection  pro-
cedure. We  then  present  the  results  of
the  data  analysis  and  related  discus-
sions. Finally, we draw conclusions and
discuss the implications of the study for
future research.
Literature Review
From Goods-Dominant Logic to
Service-Dominant Logic
The product has long been the focus of
the  traditional  business  model  utilized
in a manufacturing-oriented economy.
The  traditional  perception  of  value  as
being  generated  through  a  change  in
form during the manufacturing process
is referred to as goods-dominant (G-D)
logic  and  is  based  on  the  value-in-
exchange  meaning  of  value  (Vargo  &
Lusch, 2004). In G-D logic, value is cre-
ated  (manufactured)  by  the  firm  and
distributed  in  the  market,  usually
through  the  exchange  of  goods  and
money. From this perspective, the roles
of  “producers”  and  “consumers”  are
distinct, with value creation often being
regarded  as  a  series  of  activities  per-
formed by the firm.

During the last century, the market-
ing  field  has  grown  to  encompass  the
study  of  positive  issues  (such  as  how
firms and customers go to market) and
normative  issues  (such  as  how  firms
should  market  to  customers;  Vargo  &
Lusch,  2008).  These  changes  have
resulted  in  a  shift  toward  a  new 
economic  environment—a  service
economy,  an  outcome  of  which  is  the
replacement  of  G-D  logic  with  S-D
logic.  The  primary  tenets  of  S-D  logic
are: (1) the conceptualization of service
as a process, rather than a unit of out-
put;  (2)  a  focus  on  dynamic  resources,
such  as  knowledge  and  skills,  rather
than  static  resources,  such  as  natural
resources;  and  (3)  an  understanding  of
value as a collaborative process between
providers and customers, rather than as
the result of the product created by the
producers  and  subsequently  delivered
to customers.

From  an  S-D  perspective,  organiza-
tions  are  service  systems  in  which 
consumers  are  viewed  as  collaborative
partners  with  whom  value  is  shared
(Lusch, Vargo,  & Wessels,  2008; Vargo  &
Lusch,  2004).  Coproduction,  thus,  may
be viewed as “buyer-seller social interac-
tion  and  adaptability  with  a  view  to
attaining further value” (Wikström, 1996,
p.  10).  In  contrast  to  the  traditional
goods-dominant logic, service-dominant
logic emphasizes the importance of the
service  provider  coordinating  with  the
client, who actively participates in prod-
uct design and development. From this
perspective, the customer is viewed as a
collaborative  partner  and  can  provide 
a  complement 
the  knowledge,
resources,  and  equipment  provided  by
the company. Higher new value can be
generated jointly through effective coor-
dination  of 
those  complementary
resources (Wikström, 1996).

From User Participation to User
Coproduction
Because ISD requires the expertise and
insights  of  many  stakeholders,  such  as
developers and users, user participation
in ISD has been receiving considerable

attention from researchers for a decade
(Aladwani,  Rai,  &  Ramaprasad,  2000;
Cavaye, 1995; He & King, 2008; Lynch &
Gregor,  2004;  Olson  &  Ives,  1981;
Swanson, 1974). Generally, user partici-
pation  refers  to  “user  and  developer
who  are  cooperatively  involved  to  the
extent  that  the  activities  of  each  facili-
tate  the  attainment  of  the  ends  of  the
others”  (Swanson,  1974,  p.  181).  In  the
ISD  context,  user  participation 
is
viewed  as  the  behaviors  and  activities
that  users  or  their  representatives  col-
laborate on with the developers during
the project. These activities include dis-
cussions  to  obtain  specifications,  feed-
back,  and  review  (Wagner  &  Piccoli,
2007).  Although  many  studies  assert
that  user  participation  in  an  ISD  can
increase  system  quality  and  enhance
user  satisfaction,  the  actual  effect  of
such participation is debatable (Harris &
Weistroffer,  2009).  Furthermore,  some
researchers continue to report that proj-
ect  performance  is  undermined  by
user–IS  conflicts,  communication  gaps,
and  frequent  modifications  to  require-
ments (Maruping, Venkatesh, & Agarwal,
2009; Shim et al., 2010). This implies the
need to redefine the role of the user in
ISD  projects.  Indeed,  the  relationship
between  user  and  software  developer
continues to evolve into more complex
relations, including client partnerships,
because  systems  and  application  areas
have  become  increasingly  complex
(Markus,  Majchrzak,  &  Gasser,  2002;
Markus & Mao, 2004).

Users  should  be  viewed  as  taking
full responsibility with developers dur-
ing  the  project,  not  just  a  source  of
requirements (Shim et al., 2010); hence,
Bettencourt  and  his  colleagues  (2002)
brought up the term “coproduction”—a
range  of  behaviors  and  activities  that
can contribute to effective functioning
of  the  organization  and  increase  goal
achievement.  Originated  from  public
administration,  coproduction  refers  to
the  activities  that  service  agents  and
citizens  contribute  to  the  delivery  of
service  (Brudney  &  England,  1983;
Sharp,  1980; Whitaker,  1980).  Different

from pure participation in which users
are  viewed  as  passive  requirement
providers,  coproduction  emphasizes
the  active  roles  of  users  and  the  pro-
social  behaviors,  which  can  facilitate
developers to maximize the value created
(Bettencourt et al., 2002).

The  importance  of  coproduction
has been highlighted in a few studies in
the  general  project  management  area;
for  example,  Yates  (2006)  highlighted
the importance of coconstruct between
users  and  technologies.  Chiocchio,
Forgues, Paradis, and Iordanova (2011)
emphasized  the  mediating  role  of 
collaboration  between  different  stake-
holders;  however,  the  coproduction
perspective is relatively new to the ISD
area. We  argue  that  when  information
systems  are  coproduced  by  users  and
developers,  the  final  value  is  deter-
mined  by  the  effectiveness  of  the
coproduction;  therefore,  users  should
be actively involved in the development
process  to  maximize  the  value  created
and  to  ensure  that  the  developed  sys-
tem meets their needs.

In  an  outsourcing  context,  client
coproduction  is  viewed  as  the  client
behaving in a collaborative way to con-
tribute  to  more  optimal  knowledge-
based  project  solutions,  to  maintain
effective working relationships with the
KIBS  (Knowledge  Intensive-Business
Services) firm, and to increase the like-
lihood of goal achievement (Bettencourt
et  al.,  2002).  Based  on  a  concept  by
Bettencourt  and  his  colleagues  (2002),
ISD is viewed as a value coproduction
process  in  which  IS  developers  are
service providers and users are clients.
In  that  process,  users  and  developers
work closely together to determine the
specific  system  requirements  and
implement the final system to support
the  organization’s  daily  operation.  In
other  words,  users  are  considered  as
the  final  customers  of  the  ISD  service
while  they  operate  the  developed  sys-
tem 
lives.
Developers, as service providers, apply
their  technical  capabilities  to  resolve
business problems, the effectiveness of

their  daily  work 

in 

which depends on how well users and
developers  are  able  to  collaboratively
integrate their own domain knowledge
to  generate  innovative  solutions  to
problems.

Bettencourt  and  his  colleagues
(2002)  proposed  seven  major  copro-
duction  behaviors,  which  go  beyond
traditional user participation: commu-
nication openness, shared problem solv-
ing, involvement in project governance,
personal  dedication,  tolerance,  advoca-
cy,  and  accommodation.  Communica-
tion  openness refers  to  the  sharing  of
related  information  between  partners,
such as details of plans, objectives, and
evaluation criteria through formal and
informal  channels  (Smith  &  Barclay,
1997). In our research context, commu-
nication  openness  is  regarded  as  the
extent to which the client and develop-
er  openly  share  with  each  other  infor-
mation  about  the  project  (Bettencourt
et al.). Many projects fail simply as the
result of inadequate information trans-
parency within the development team.
For  example,  developers  tend  to  con-
ceal news about delays to avoid censure
from  stakeholders 
(Petter,  2008).
Developers also complain of not being
informed  about  users’  special  require-
ments or their concerns relating to the
project;  thus,  misunderstandings  and
conflicts  result  from  limited  informa-
tion availability.

Shared  problem  solving refers  to
users acting on their own initiative and
sharing  responsibility  for  developing
solutions  as  well  as  resolving  issues
and  problems  arising 
in  projects
(Bettencourt  et  al.,  2002).  In  contrast
to  the  traditional  user  participation
concept,  the  notion  of  coproduction
emphasizes  the  importance  of  users
engaging 
the  problem-solving
process.  Simply  providing  require-
ments and then waiting for developers
to create the final system is inadequate
and inappropriate. Users need to con-
tribute  expertise  and  effort  to  effec-
tively  resolve  those  non-technical
issues  that  arise  during  the  course  of
the project.

Antecedents and Consequences of User Coproduction in Information System

Involvement  in  project  governance
implies the importance of users taking
an  active  role  in  monitoring  project
progress toward predefined project goals
and  of  their  determining  jointly  with
the  developers  the  milestones  of  the
project  (Bettencourt  et  al.,  2002).  This
has  been  highlighted  in  the  measure-
ment  of  user  participation  (Barki  &
Hartwick,  1994).  This  process  also
ensures  that  the  direction  of  the  ISD
project is correct and actually meets the
users’ current requirements in a highly
uncertain  context  (Hsu,  Chan,  Liu,  &
Chen, 2008).

Personal dedication reflects a sense
of  personal  obligation  toward  project
success (Bettencourt et al., 2002). Users
are  occupied  not  only  by  project 
work,  but  also  by  their  routine  work.
Responsible users should perform indi-
vidual  responsibilities  in  a  persistently
conscientious  and  responsive  manner.
Thus, rather than users attending meet-
ings  but  not  paying  attention  to  the
content  or  contributing  to  the  project,
it is imperative that they actively partic-
ipate  and  influence  the  development
process  in  order  to  ensure  the  devel-
oped system fully accommodates their
needs.

Tolerance refers  to  users’  ability  to
respond  with  understanding  and
patience  to  minor  project  encum-
brances,  glitches,  and  inconveniences
(Bettencourt  et  al.,  2002).  It  is  well
accepted that conflicts are unavoidable
due  to  the  diverse  backgrounds  and
perspectives  of  users  and  developers
(Barki & Hartwick, 1994). To run a proj-
ect  smoothly,  users  and  developers
have  to  weather  such  clashes  and
maintain their focus on the main issue.
Advocacy refers to a vocal advocate
who acts as a salesperson for the proj-
ect,  promoting  its  merits  (Bettencourt
et  al.,  2002).  Because  not  all  end  users
engage in the development process, it is
critical for those who participate in the
process  to  keep  those  non-participant
users updated about the current status
of the project (Markus & Mao, 2004). In a
vein similar to organizational members

who  promote  organizational  ideas  to
outsiders,  user  representatives  should
promote  the  system  concepts  to  non-
representative users in order to increase
the  acceptance  rate  (Moorman  &
Blakely, 1995).

Accommodation refers to the extent
to which users demonstrate the willing-
ness  to  accommodate  the  desires,
approaches,  and  expert  judgment  of
the  developers  (Bettencourt  et  al.,
2002).  Irrational  insistence  may  cause
project  delay  and  harm  the  relation-
ships between users and developers as
well.  It  is  vital,  therefore,  to  reach  a
compromise between users and devel-
opers on certain issues; moreover, users
should  accept  the  expert’s  advice  as
long  as  in  so  doing,  the  initial  project
goal  can  be  achieved.  It  is  crucial  for
users  and  developers  to  adapt  their
ideas and behaviors to the needs of the
other (Heide & Miner, 1992).

Social Capital Theory
In  this  study,  we  proposed  that  social
capital between users and developers is
an important antecedent of user copro-
duction.  This  perspective  is  adopted,
because  coproduction  requires  both
users and developers to work coopera-
tively to reach the project goal. By view-
ing the developed system as one type of
intellectual  capital  cocreated  by  users
and developers, social capital serves as
one important facilitator in the forming
of  high-quality 
intellectual  capital
(Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998).

Social capital, initially appearing in
sociology  studies,  may  be  viewed  as
“the aggregate of the actual or potential
resources,  which  are  linked  to  posses-
sion  of  a  durable  network  of  more  or
less  institutionalized  relationships  of
mutual  acquaintance  or  recognition”
(Bourdieu, 1986, p. 248). With social capi-
tal, individual actors in one social struc-
ture can obtain resources that they do not
possess but are needed to perform certain
actions; in this way, the performance of the
individual actor can be improved. In recent
years,  social  capital  concepts  have  been
offered as  explanations  for  a  variety  of

social  behaviors,  such  as  common
actions  and  community  participation.
For  example,  Nahapiet  and  Ghoshal
(1998) highlighted social capital’s influ-
ence on the creation of intellectual cap-
ital; Atuahene-Gima and Murray (2007)
investigated the impact of social capital
on  exploratory  and  exploitative  learn-
ing  and  new  product  development  in
China;  and  Tsai  and  Ghoshal  (1998)
indicated that social capital influences
resource  exchange.  In  the  IS  arena,
social  capital  has  been  shown  to  have
effects on knowledge sharing (Chiu, Hsu, &
Wang, 2006), knowledge transfer (Rottman,
2008),  knowledge  management  system
usage (He, Qiao, & Wei, 2009), and con-
intention  of 
tinuance 
the  online 
auction 
(Wang  &  Chiang,  2009).
Although  those  studies  adopted  social
capital  theory,  to  our  best  knowledge,
none  of  them  has  attempted  to  apply
social  capital  in  an  SD  context  to
understanding the coproduction issue.
Given the importance of social cap-
ital on the forming of intellectual capi-
tal and that the ISD can be viewed as a
process  of  creating  new  intellectual
capital, we argue that social capital may
serve  as  a  critical  antecedent  of  copro-
duction. For example, open communica-
tion  allows  developers  and  users  to
exchange 
information—an
important  resource  in  ISD  project.
Tolerance  allows  developers  to  focus  on
main  functions—a  major  component  of
new intellectual capital. Accommodation
reduces the barriers resulting from con-
flicts,  thereby  enhancing  resource
exchange. Involvement in project gov-
ernance  allows  users  to  jointly  deter-
mine  the  direction  and  understand
the  current  progress  of  the  project.
Users  may  help  acquire  required
resources  to  improve  the  progress.
Advocacy allows information about the
project  to  be  shared  within  the  user
group. With better understanding of the
systems,  users  who  do  not  engage  in
the  development  are  more  likely  to
embrace  the  new  system  (new  intel-
lectual capital). Shared problem solv-
ing  allows  users  to  contribute  their

resources  to  identify  problems,  help
generate  solutions,  and  evaluate  pos-
sible  solutions.  The  new  developed
system  (intellectual  capital)  is  more
likely  to  be  of  high  quality.  Last,  per-
sonal dedication represents the input
of resources that benefit the quality of
the  new  system,  given  that  resources
from  both  the  user  and  developer
sides are needed to develop new intel-
lectual capital.

the 

Among  previous  studies  that  have
adopted  social  capital  theory,  two
research streams can be classified: treat-
ing three dimensions of social capital as
parallel  elements  (Nahapiet  &  Ghoshal,
1998)  or  as  causal  relationships  among
three constructs (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998).
We  adopted 
first  approach,
because there is no congruence about
the directions of relationships between
paired  social  capitals.  For  example,
structural  social capital  may  enhance
relational  social  capital,  whereas  rela-
tional  social  capital  can  also  lead  to
structural  social  capital.  Given  that
cross-sectional data are not able to clar-
ify the above issue, a parallel perspective
was then adopted in this study.

Nahapiet  and  Ghoshal  (1998)  first
classified  social  capital  into  structural
social  capital,  relational  social  capital,
and  cognitive  social  capital.  Whereas
structural  social  capital  depicts  the
interaction  patterns  between  actors,
relational  social  capital  refers  to  the
quality  of  personal  relationships,  such
as  trust  and  trustworthiness,  norms
and  sanctions,  obligations,  and  expec-
tations. Cognitive social capital reflects
the  extent  to  which  members  in  the
same  community  have  shared  repre-
sentation,  shared  language,  shared
interpretation,  and  shared  mental
models  (Nahapiet  &  Ghoshal).  In  the
next section, we introduce each capital
separately.

Structural Social Capital
In general, structural social capital refers
to the structure of connection or config-
uration  of  an  interacting  network;  it
reflects the modes of interactions among

group  members  (Nahapiet  &  Ghoshal,
1998).  The  frequency  and  intensity  of
interaction often serve as the manifesta-
tions  of  structural  social  capital  (Burt,
1987), which has also been adopted in a
recent IS study to reflect the connection
between users and developers (van den
Hooff  &  Huysman,  2009).  We  followed
past  studies  and  defined  structural
social capital as the frequency of interac-
tions  between  user  representatives  and
developers.  Because  social  interactions
are the power to ensure that both sides
are  able  to  achieve  targets  (Atuahene-
Gima & Murray, 2007), it is expected that
more  interactions  between  users  and
developers  lead  to  increasingly  positive
effects  on  project  performance.
Interaction  between  developers  and
users can be formal or informal, the for-
mer occurring when users attend devel-
opment  meetings.  Informal  interaction
refers  to  non–work-related  interaction
between  two  parties  (e.g.,  communica-
tion  during  leisure  activities  or  during
lunchtime.)

Relational Social Capital
Social capital theory describes relation-
al social capital in terms of the interper-
sonal  relationships  developed  through
the interaction process and the ways in
which  those  ongoing  relationships
affect individuals’ attitudes and behav-
iors  (Granovetter,  1992).  In  this  study,
mutual  trust  between  user  representa-
tives and developers is adopted to rep-
resent relationships between these two
parties.

Mayer,  Davis,  and  Schoorman
(1995) defined trust as “the willingness of
a  party  to  be  vulnerable  to  the  actions 
of another party based on the expecta-
tion that the other will perform a partic-
ular  action  important  to  the  trustee,
irrespective of the ability to monitor or
control  that  other  party”(p.  712). In
addition to not performing opportunistic
behaviors,  people  in  a  relationship  of
trust have greater motivation to engage in
social exchange in general, and coopera-
tive interaction in particular (Nahapiet &
Ghoshal,  1998).  An  empirical  study  has

also indicated that trust plays an impor-
tant role in the willingness of structural
network  participants  to  share  and
exchange  knowledge  (Inkpen  &  Tsang,
2005). Trust between users and IS devel-
opers  enhances  their  belief  in  one
another and increases their willingness
to maintain the relationship (Atuahene-
Gima  &  Murray,  2007). With  trust,  user
representatives  and  IS  developers  are
more  likely  to  respect  and  commit  to
each other (Simons & Peterson, 2000).

Cognitive Social Capital
The cognitive dimension of social capi-
tal theory describes the extent to which
members possess shared meaning and
understanding  (Nahapiet  &  Ghoshal,
1998). The importance of shared under-
standing  has  been  emphasized  in  the
team  mental  model  research  stream.
Good  team  performance  results  from
the  developing  of  a  common  mental
model  among  team  members,  which
encompasses  every  aspect  of  the  sys-
tem  with  which  the  members  interact
(Klimoski  &  Mohammed, 
1994;
Levesque,  Wilson,  &  Wholey,  2001).  A
common  or  shared  mental  model  or
shared  understanding  allows  project
team members to translate information
in  the  same  way  and  to  share  similar
expectations  about  future  situations
(Mohammed,  Ferzandi,  &  Hamilton,
2010;  Rouse,  Cannon-Bowers,  &  Salas,
1992).  Such  a  model  can  also  speed 
up information processing by reducing
information  acquisition  and 
the
searching,  filtering,  coding,  storing,
and retrieval processes.

In  the  ISD  context,  shared  under-
standing or a shared mental model can
be  viewed  as  the  sharing  of  similar
knowledge,  experiences,  and  view-
points  toward  the  project  goal  and
development process among user rep-
resentatives and developers (Ko, Kirsch,
&  King,  2005;  Nelson  &  Cooprider,
1996).  Such  common  knowledge  and
vision  allow  developers  and  user  repre-
sentatives jointly to make decisions in an
efficient way (Davis, Kettinger, & Kunev,
2009);  therefore,  a  better  outcome  can

Research Method
Research Model
The  research  model  of  this  study  is
shown in Figure 1. As indicated, social
capital has an impact on coproduction,
which,  in  turn,  leads  to  better  project
outcomes. In the following, all hypothe-
ses are presented.

Hypotheses

The Relationship Between User
Coproduction and Project Outcomes
System  quality  refers  to  reliability,
response time, ease of use, and ease of
learning  of 
(Belardo,
Karwan, & Wallace, 1982) and can also
be  viewed  as  the  efficiency,  reliability,
accuracy,  ease  of  using,  and  ability  to
generate  the  information  that  users

the  system 

need  (He  &  King,  2008).  High-system
quality can be achieved when informa-
tion  is  fully  exchanged  between  users
and  developers  in  the  coproduction
process (Hsu et al., 2008). For example,
users’  needs  can  be  assured  through
open  communication  between  users
and  developers.  User  representatives
may  help  by  providing  possible  solu-
tions to solving problems, which may in
turn  enhance  the  system’s  reliability
(Moorman & Blakely, 1995).

H1: Uer coproduction is positive-
ly associated with system quality.
User  satisfaction  is  high  when  users
feel  the  developed  system  meets  their
needs,  requirements,  and  expectations
(He & King, 2008). Users are more satisfied
when effective coproduction is observed.
First, users can have a better understand-
ing  of  the  functions,  limitations, and
strengths  of  the  system,  which  can  be

obtained by participating in the devel-
opment  process.  Without  irrational
expectations  of  the  system,  users  are
much  less  likely  to  be  dissatisfied.
Second,  according 
to  Locke  and
Schweiger (1979), a high level of engage-
ment  increases  satisfaction,  because  a
sense of psychological belonging toward
the  system  is  developed  during  the
engaging  process.  User  representatives
take a project as part of their life through
the joint decision-making and problem-
resolving  processes,  through  helping
project governance, and through devot-
ing their individual time to the project.
the  coproduction
Third, 
through 
process,  users’ 
requirements  are
assured and the developed system can
better  reflect  their  actual  needs.  Higher
satisfaction  is,  therefore,  expected.  Last,
effective coproduction requires user rep-
resentatives  to  promote  the  system  to

72

other  users  of  the  group  (Smith  &
Barclay, 1997). Because of this, it will be
easier for other users to accept the sys-
tem  when  they  receive  the  promotion
from user representatives, not develop-
ers; therefore, we hypothesize that:
H2: User and developer’s copro-
duction  is  positively  associated
with user satisfaction.
An  ISD  project  is  a  series  of 
processes—initialization, planning and
control,  execution,  and  termination—
with  a  beginning,  an  end,  and  clearly
identified  inputs  and  outputs  (Cooke-
Davies,  2004).  Project  perfor-mance  is
defined  as  the  efficiency  of  system
development  work  (He  &  King,  2008)
and can be determined by the extent to
which  those  processes  can  be  accom-
plished  with  efficiency  (Cooke-Davies,
2004).  Project  performance  can  be
improved  with  user  coproduction  for
the  following  reasons.  First,  informa-
tion  exchange  between  users  and
developers allows developers to acquire
real  business  needs  in  the  early  stage
and avoid rework in the later stage. The
project  is  more  likely  to  be  accom-
plished within budget and on schedule.
Second,  project  performance 
is
enhanced  when  user  representatives
are  involved  in  problem  resolving
(Tesch,  Sobol,  Klein,  &  Jiang,  2009).
Third,  users  involved  in  project  gover-
nance  help  developers  to  move  in  the
right direction and drive developers to
accomplish  predefined  goals  on  time
(Jones  &  Harrison,  1996).  In  addition,
empirical study has also shown a signif-
icant  relationship  between  coproduc-
tion and development project outcome
(Shim  et  al.,  2010);  therefore,  we
hypothesize that:

H3: User and developer’s copro-
duction  is  positively  associated
with project performance.

From Social Capital to User
Coproduction
Structural social capital refers to the fre-
quency  of  interaction  between  users
and  developers  in  an  ISD  context.  It  is
the  basis  for  information  exchange

(Wasko  &  Faraj,  2005)  and  knowledge
sharing  (van  den  Hooff  &  de  Winter,
2011).  Interaction  can  be  formal  or
informal;  the  former  refers  to  interac-
tions  that  happen  in  specified  project-
related working contexts (such as review
meetings),  whereas  the  latter  refers  to
interactions that take place in non-work
situations (such as casual conversation).
Without  formal  or  informal  interaction
mechanisms,  user  engagement  is  not
likely  to  happen.  Previous  studies  have
indicated that structural social capital is
the  means  to  ensuring  that  things  are
done  and  goals  are  achieved  (Adler  &
Kwon,  2002;  Atuahene-Gima  &  Murray,
2007) and significantly affects informa-
tion 
(Bolino,  Turnley,  &
Bloodgood, 2002; Hanson & Krackhardt,
1993). The informal interaction mecha-
nism serves as a complementary chan-
nel,  which  allows  users  to  openly 
communicate with developers. With the
formal interaction mechanism, such as
participation  in  direction  determina-
tion, 
requirement  elicitation,  and
progress  review,  users  are  allowed  to
jointly  solve  problems  and  involve
themselves 
in  project  governance;
therefore, we hypothesize that:

transfer 

H4: Structural  social  capital  is
positively  associated  with  co-
production.
Coproduction  requires  users  and
developers  to  communicate  with  each
other, and the effectiveness of commu-
nication is determined by the extent to
which  a  shared  understanding  exists
(Bettencourt  et  al.,  2002;  Moorman  &
Blakely,  1995).  By  having  the  same
understanding toward the goal and the
procedure to reach that goal, developers
can accommodate themselves to users’
needs, and users can adjust themselves
to fit the developers’ needs. Good com-
munication  can  possibly  reduce  con-
flicts  and  enhance  joint  problem  solv-
ing; therefore, we hypothesize that:
H5: Cognitive  social  capital  is
positively  associated  with  co-
production.
Trust  is  the  basis  of  interaction. 
It  can  improve  communication  and

information  exchange 
(Duhan  &
Sandvik, 2009; Heide & John, 1992), can
enhance both parties’ emotions, and is
the basis for fostering solidarity, which
also  refers  to  shared  problem  solving
(Duhan  &  Sandvik,  2009;  Kaufmann  &
Stern,  1988).  When  problems  occur,  a
high  level  of  trust  allows  users  and
developers to possess an open attitude
toward  each  other,  which  facilitates
joint problem solving. Trust also refers
to one’s belief that another party won’t
exhibit  opportunistic  behavior  when
there  is  a  chance  to  do  so;  therefore,
users and developers can adjust them-
selves 
to  align  with  each  other
(Bettencourt et al., 2002; Heide & John,
1992). Moreover, trust also allows both
parties to ignore minor issues, such as
deviation  from  predefined  plans,  and
leads  to  commitment,  which  is  the
basis for resource devotion (Bettencourt
et  al.,  2002;  Borman  &  Motowidlo,
1993). Finally, successful system devel-
opment  requires  not  only  developers
but also users to dedicate themselves to
the  development  work.  User  represen-
tatives  are  more  willing  to  spend  time
on  the  project  when  they  have  strong
trust with the developers; therefore, we
hypothesize that:

H6: Relational  social  capital  is
positively  associated  with  co-
production.

Research Methods

Sample and Data Collection
A field survey was conducted to empir-
ically  test  the  hypotheses.  The  target
sample consisted of projects, including
an  in-house  project  and  outsourcing
system  project  in  Taiwan.  Data  were
collected  through  a  matched  pair  sur-
vey  of  user  representatives  and  devel-
opers  from  each  project.  Given  that
coproduction  is  the  process  used  to
engage  in  the  development  process,
there is a need to obtain data from both
developers  and  users  to  comprehend
their respective viewpoints; therefore,
two  versions  of  the  questionnaires
were  developed.  The  measurement
items  used  in  the  survey  were  based

from  Chinese 

on a comprehensive review of the lit-
erature  as well  as  on  expert  opinion.
The measurement was translated from
English into Chinese to make comple-
tion  of  the  questionnaires  easier.  To
assure  the  quality  of  translation,  a
back-translation 
to
English  was  made  by  the  second
author of this study. The survey instru-
ment  was  pretested  with  three  aca-
demic  field  experts  and  three  practic-
ing system developers, and a pilot test
was conducted by delivering question-
naires  to  the  information  department
of a steel company in southern Taiwan.
The pretest and pilot test were used to
assure quality of the operational meas-
ures of the survey. Minor modifications
were made according to feedback from
pretest and pilot test participants.

Data  collection  was  conducted
from  March  through  June  2011.  We
first  contacted  members  of 
the
Information  Manager  Association  in
Taiwan  to  introduce  the  purpose  of
this study and obtain their willingness
to  participate.  A  total  of  500  survey
packages  were  then  sent  to  project
managers  who  agreed  to  participate.
One  survey  package  contained  two
instruments: one for project managers
and  one  for  the  user’s  representative.
In addition to filling the developer ver-
sion  instrument,  project  managers
were  asked  to  recommend  one  user
representative  heavily  involved  in  the
project  to  fill  the  user  version  instru-
ment. In order to avoid selection bias,
both project managers and users were
asked to answer all questions based on
their  experiences  of  the  same  system
development project, which had been
completed most recently. A total of 130
managers  returned  the  survey  and
only  103  users  completed  the  survey;
therefore, the 27 one-side only surveys
were  not  included  in  the  following
analysis.  The  final  response  rate  was
20.6%.  The  demographic  information
sample of 103 pairs is shown in Table 1,
and  the  corresponding  project  demo-
graphic is shown in Table 2.

Constructs and Measurement
The  research  model  includes  seven
constructs:  structural  social  capital,
relational social capital, cognitive social
capital,  user  coproduction,  system
quality,  user  satisfaction,  and  project
performance.  The  measurement  items
were  adopted  from  past  studies  and
revised  based  on  pretest  results.  In
order to fully capture the actual interac-
tion  between  both  parties,  responses
from  both  sides  were  collected.  Both
user  representatives  and  developers
were  asked  to  provide  information  for
social  capital  and  coproduction.  With
respect  to  the  dependent  variables
(excluding project performance, which
had  to  be  assessed  by  project  man-
agers), user representatives were asked
to  detail  their  perceptions  of  system
quality  and  levels  of  satisfaction  with
the  developed  system.  Likert  scales
(ranging  from  1  to  5),  with  anchors
ranging  from  “strongly  disagree”  to
“strongly agree,” were adopted to mea-
sure all indicators. Constructs and their
corresponding  measurements  were
described as follows.

Three 

frequently 

types  of  social  capital
between  user  representatives  and
developers  were  measured.  The  pur-
pose  in  measuring  structural  social
capital was to capture the frequency of
interaction  between  the  two  parties. 
A  total  of  three  items  obtained  from
Patnayakuni,  Rai,  and  Tiwana  (2007)
were  used  to  measure  the  extent  to
which these two parties worked closely
together  and  interacted  with  each
other 
routinely.
Cognitive  social  capital reflected  the
extent  to  which  shared  understanding
existed  between  user  representatives
and  developers.  A  total  of  six  items
adopted  from  Simons  and  Peterson
(2000) were used to capture the extent
to which these two parties were able to
understand  each  other  while  commu-
nicating,  had  similar  previous  experi-
ence,  agreed  on  what  was  important,
and  used  similar  problem-solving
approaches. The purpose in measuring

and 

74

April 2013 ■ Project Management Journal ■ DOI: 10.1002/pmj 

relational  social  capital was  to  assess
the degree of trust between user repre-
sentatives  and  developers.  A  total  of
five  items  adopted  from  Ko  and  col-
leagues (2005) were used to capture the
extent  to  which  users  and  developers
respected each other, showed integrity,
expected  each  other  to  be  truthful,  as
well  as  trusted  and  relied  on  each
other.

User coproduction is a multidimen-
sional construct involving communica-
tion openness, shared problem solving,
personal dedication, tolerance, advoca-
cy,  accommodation,  and  involvement
in  project  governance  (Bettencourt 
et al., 2002). Because the coproduction
concept is complex and data were col-
lected from both users and developers,
user coproduction was operationalized
as  a  second-order  latent  variable.  The
first-order construct contains all seven
components  mentioned  above.  For
communication openness, we used four
items  to  measure  the  extent  to  which
user  representatives  were  willing  to
exchange  information  with  developers
without  reservation  (Heide  &  Miner,
1992).  Shared  problem  solving,  the
extent  to  which  user  representatives
shared  the  responsibility  for  resolving
problems  faced,  was  measured  with
four  items  adopted  from  Heide  and
Miner (1992). For personal dedication, a
total of four items were used to capture
whether  users  worked  above  and
beyond their defined duties (Moorman &
Blakely, 1995). Tolerance was measured,
with three items aimed at capturing the
willingness 
than 
ideal  conditions  without  complaint
(MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Fetter, 1993).
For  advocacy,  a  total  of  four  items
adopted  from  Moorman  and  Blakely
(1995) were used to ascertain the extent
to  which  user  representatives  encour-
aged  other  users  to  use  the  system. 
A total of four items for accommodation
were  used  to  capture  the  degree  to
which  user  representatives  adjusted
their  behavior  to  meet  the  needs  of
developers  (Heide  &  Miner,  1992).

System quality is defined as the suc-
cess  of  the  developed  system  (Wallace,
Keil, & Rai, 2004b). A total of five items
adopted  from  Wallace  and  colleagues
(2004b) were used to capture the extent
to  which  end  users  thought  the  devel-
oped  system  was  reliable,  adaptable,
and  easy  to  use.  User  satisfaction is
defined  as  the  extent  to  which  users
believe the information system available
to them meets their expectations (Chan,
Yim, & Lam, 2010). A total of three items
adopted from Chan and colleagues were
used to measure the perceptions of end
users about the completed information
system. Project performance refers to the
success of the developed system, such as
achieving  the  predefined  schedule  and
budget (Wallace et al., 2004b). A total of
five items adopted from Wallace and col-
leagues  (2004b)  were  used  to  measure
the extent to which system development
work adhered to the predefined budget
and schedule.

In  addition  to  proposed  indepen-
dent  variables,  project  performance
could  be  influenced  by  a  number  of
project characteristics. In order to both
reduce  the  possibility  of  interference
and  understand  the  real  impact  of
coproduction, we controlled the effects
of  project  size,  duration,  and  budget.
These three variables were suspected of
impacting  project  performance,  system
quality,  and  user  satisfaction  and  were
controlled  in  many  studies  (e.g.,  Hsu,
Liang,  Wu,  Klein,  &  Jiang,  2011;  Sauer,
Gemino,  &  Reich,  2007).  Those  three
variables,  in  some  sense,  reflect  the
scope of the project; specifically, coordi-
nation  and  communication  costs
increase  as  the  team  size  increases,
longer  project  duration  implies  a  more
complex project, and projects with high-
er budgets often contain new technolo-
gies. The possibility of meeting the pre-
defined goal with the given resources is
lower when the project is complex.


Reliability and Validity
Reliability and validity are often used to
ensure the quality of the measurement.
Reliability  can  be  ensured  through
composite  reliability,  item-total  corre-
lation 
loading,  and
Cronbach’s alpha. Composite reliability
and alpha values should be higher than
0.7,  the  ITC  should  not  be  lower 
than  0.3,  and  factor  loadings  should
exceed 0.7.

factor 

(ITC), 

Convergent  validity  should  be
ensured  when  multiple  indicators  are
used to assess the construct (Anderson
& Gerbing, 1988) and can be examined
by composite reliability (CR) as well as
average  variance  extracted 
(AVE);
(Fornell  &  Lareker,  1981).  The  conver-
gence indicator AVE is calculated to the
mean  variance  extracted  of  item  load-
ing on the construct. The AVE should be
higher  than  0.5  to  meet  the  validity
standard.  Discriminant  validity  is  the
extent to which indicators of one con-
cept  differ  from  indicators  of  another
concept (Bagozzi & Phillips, 1982). The
results are shown in Table 3. The corre-
lation  between  paired  constructs
should be less than 0.9 and lower than
the  square  root  of  AVE  (Fornell  &
Lareker, 1981). The relevant correlation
information is provided in Table 4. The
results indicate that all values meet the
minimum requirements and, therefore,
the  quality  of  our  measurement  is
assured.

Common  method  bias  might  be  a
potential  problem  when  both  depen-
dent and independent variables are col-
lected from the same respondent at the
same time. In this study, Harman’s one-
factor test was used to examine the pos-
sibility of a common method bias. The
results showed that more than one fac-
tor was extracted, and the variance was
explained  by  a  first  factor  below  30%.
This  indicates  that  common  method
bias is not an issue in this study.

Hypothesis Test: Structural Model
We  applied  partial  least  square  (PLS)
with  a  bootstrapping  technique  to
examine  the  proposed  model  (Chin,

1998). PLS was adopted because several
variables  cannot  meet  the  normality
assumption  required  by  other  tech-
niques  (e.g.,  covariance  structural
equation  modeling).  For  example,  as
shown in Table 4, the kurtosis indices of
almost half the variables exceed the rec-
ommended cut-off value (1.0). Because
data were collected from one developer
and one user for each project, we aver-
aged opinions from both sides to repre-
sent each project; in addition, we treat
coproduction  as  a  second  order  con-
struct. The coefficient and significance
level of each path and R-square of each
dependent are shown in Figure 2.

The  path  coefficients  from  user
coproduction  to  project  performance,
system quality, and user satisfaction are
all positively significant (β ⫽ 0.52, p ⬍
0.01;  β ⫽ 0.60, p ⬍ 0.01;  β ⫽ 0.52,
p ⬍ 0.01;  respectively),  indicating  that
user  coproduction  can  effectively  pro-
mote  project  outcomes;  therefore,  H1,
H2, and H3 are supported. User copro-
duction  explains  a  34.3%  variance  of
system quality, a 26.8% variance of user
satisfaction,  and  a  28.4%  variance  of
project  performance.  Furthermore,
structural  social  capital,  relational
social capital, and cognitive social capi-
tal together explain the 68.4% variance
of  user  coproduction. The  path  coeffi-
cients  from  cognitive,  relational,  and
structural  social  capitals  to  coproduc-
tion  are  all  positively  significant 
(β ⫽ 0.36, p  ⬍ 0.01; β ⫽ 0.33,  p ⬍
0.01; β ⫽ 0.26, p  ⬍ 0.01; respectively),
indicating  that  all  three  types  of  social
capital  contribute  to  coproduction;
therefore, H4,  H5,  and  H6  are  all  sup-
ported. These three forms of social cap-
ital  in  total  explain  the  69.7%  variance
of user coproduction.

Discussion
The results of the research supported the
main  premises  of  the  research:  (1)  user
coproduction has an important impact on
system quality, project performance, and
user satisfaction; and (2) all three forms of
social  capital  have  significant  influences
on user coproduction.

First,  the  results  showed  that  the
paths  from  user  coproduction  to  sys-
tem  quality,  project  performance,  and
user  satisfaction  are  significant.  The
findings were consistent with previous
research, which indicated that high sys-
tem quality is achieved when users par-
ticipate  in  the  development  process
and help to identify the actual require-
ments.  Because  the  developed  system
is able to reflect actual business needs,
a  higher  satisfaction  level  can  be
achieved, and project performance can
also  be  improved  through  clarification
of  the  requirements.  Because  extra
costs and rework effort can be avoided,
the project team is better able to meet
the predefined goal within budget and
on schedule. Furthermore, user copro-
duction  has  more  impact  on  system
quality,  followed  by  project  perfor-
mance  and  user  satisfaction.  Although
the  difference  is  not  extremely  signifi-
cant,  users  are  encouraged  to  perform
coproduction  behaviors  to  assure  the
developed  system  can  better  respond
to their needs.

Second,  the  results  indicated  that
social capital between users and devel-
opers  has  a  positive  impact  on  copro-
duction.  Among  the  three  types  of
social  capital,  cognitive  social  capital
has the most significant effect, followed
by relational and structural social capi-
tal,  respectively. This  implies  that  hav-
ing  shared  understanding  is  the  most
critical  driver  for  coproduction.  In  an
in-house  software  development  con-
text,  given  that  all  functional  depart-
ments  work  together  to  achieve  the
common  goal  of  organizational  suc-
cess,  the  most  essential  foundation  is
the extent to which different players are
able to work together effectively, which
is  heavily  contingent  on  having  a
shared understanding among different
parties.  In  addition,  mutual  trust  also
plays  an  important  role  because  it
reduces barriers (e.g., conflicts), which
may  undermine  users’  willingness  to
engage 
in  the  value  coproducing
process.  Moreover,  although  structural
social  capital  has  a  positive  effect  on

user  coproduction,  its  impact  is  less
than  that  of  cognitive  and  relational
social  capital.  In  other  words,  shared
understanding  and  trust  are  more
important  than  interaction  frequency.
Last,  three  forms  of  social  capital  are
critical for user coproduction, in terms
of  variance  explained;  almost  a  70%
variance of coproduction is explained.

Limitations
Although all proposed hypotheses were
confirmed  in  this  study,  the  research  is
not  without  limitations.  First,  regional
data  were  collected  from  Taiwan  only.
Although social capital theory is a well-
developed  concept  with  a  degree  of
validity,  extending  our  results  to  other
areas should be done with care, because
the weightings of different types of social
capital might vary, depending on the cir-
cumstances. In addition, it is reasonable
to  believe  that  the  importance  of  three
types  of  social  capital  may  vary  under
different  conditions.  Second,  a  cross-
sectional  study  was  used  to  verify  the
proposed relationships. In our research
setting,  user  representatives  and  IS
developers  were  asked  to  respond  to
each  question  after  completion  of  the
project.  Because  social  capital  may  be
dynamic, 
longitudinal  data  might 
be  required  to  understand  the  relative
importance of each type of social capital
at  different  stages  of  the  project. Third,
to limit our instrument in a manageable
manner, we included only one variable in
each  type  of  social  capital.  Future
research may extend the current study by
including other potential variables (such
as  identification,  norms,  or  shared  lan-
guage)  mentioned  by  Nahapiet  and
Ghoshal  (1998).  Finally,  we  included
only  one  user  representative  and  one
developer  for  each  project.  Because
more than one user may participate in a
single project, future studies are encour-
aged to collect data from more than one
respondent  from  each  side  to  truly
reflect actual coproduction.
Conclusions
The purpose of the research has been to
(1)  examine  the  influence  of  user

coproduction  on  different  project  out-
comes (including project performance,
system  quality,  and  user  satisfaction);
and  (2)  explore  the  critical  determi-
nants  of  coproduction  based  on  social
capital theory. A total of 103 data pairs
from  both  developers  and  user  repre-
sentatives  on  the  same  project  in
Taiwan  confirmed  our  proposed
hypotheses.  The  results  indicate  that
user  coproduction  can  effectively  pro-
mote  project  outcomes  and  that  all
three types of social capital have effects
on coproduction. This finding produces
several 
for  academic
researchers  and  practitioners,  as  indi-
cated in the next section.

Academic Implications
Although  user  participation  has  been
widely  studied,  this  is  one  of  the  few
studies  based  on  service-dominant
logic used to understand the important
roles of user representatives in ISD proj-
ects. We successfully demonstrated that
user  coproduction  can  lead  to  higher
project  performance,  better  system
quality,  and  higher  levels  of  user  satis-
faction. Those benefits are obtained by
user  representatives  acting  as  copro-
ducers  who  are  able  to  communicate
openly,  solve  problems  jointly,  tolerate
project glitches, be dedicated to the devel-
opment  process,  adapt  to  the  changing
environment, advocate the new system to
potential users, and be involved in proj-
ect governance. Our results imply that,
rather  than  demonstrating  passive
engagement  in  the  system  develop-
ment  process,  users  should  regard
themselves as service receivers and act
as  active  coproducers  to  ensure  that
value is maximized.

For  social  capital  research,  this
study  provides  further  empirical  evi-
dence  to  show  how  social  capital
between users and developers encour-
ages  users  to  adopt  coproduction
behaviors. Although the importance of
social  capital  on  intellectual  capital
generation  or  resource  exchange  has
been explored in past studies (e.g., Tsai
& Ghoshal, 1998), ours is one of the few

studies to apply this concept in the ISD
context.  The  results  confirmed  our
hypotheses that social capital between
user  representatives  and  IS  developers
is  a  key  antecedent  of  user  coproduc-
tion.  Although  the  importance  of  each
individual  social  capital  has  been
emphasized  by  different  studies,  the
significance  of  all  three  types  of  social
capital also suggests that future studies
should  take  all  types  of  social  capital
into  consideration  when  constructing
research models. We contribute to this
research  stream  by  proposing  a  com-
prehensive  model  to  include  all  three
forms of social capital and by illustrat-
ing  the  relative  importance  of  each
social  capital  for  user  coproduction.
Because  ISD  is  knowledge  intensive
and the final outcomes of such projects
are determined by how well user repre-
sentatives  and  developers  incorporate
their  own  domain  knowledge  to  craft
the final product, it is hardly surprising
that  cognitive  social  capital  has  been
found  to  have  the  greatest  weighting,
followed by relational social capital. We
also  suspect  that  the  relative  impor-
tance of these three types of social cap-
ital  varies  in  different  contexts.  Future
research  is  encouraged  to  clarify  this
issue by introducing different modera-
tors in order to understand the relative
importance of each social capital under
different conditions.

For  user  participation  studies,  we
followed  the  concept  proposed  by
Bettencourt  et  al.  (2002)  and  provided
empirical  evidence  to  confirm  the
importance  of  coproduction.  In  addi-
tion  to  demonstrating  its  impact  on
project outcomes, we explored possible
antecedents  based  on  social  capital
theory. Specifically, we filled the gap in
the extant literature by illustrating that
users  engaged  in  the  coproduction
process  can  indeed  increase  value.
Effective  coproduction  leads  to  higher
system  quality  and  greater  user  satis-
faction; however, this result is not total-
ly  comprehensive  because  we  did  not
include  the  developers’  perceptions  in
the study.

Antecedents and Consequences of User Coproduction in Information System

Finally, we examined our proposed
ideas by collecting opinions from both
developers  and  users.  Because  social
capital exists between users and devel-
opers,  exclusive  reliance  on  one  party
only is insufficient to depict the whole
picture. We believe our result, based on
a  more  comprehensive  perception,  is
able to generate a more robust and pre-
cise conclusion.

Practical Implications
For  practitioners,  the  significant  and
positive  impacts  of  coproduction  on
project  performance,  system  quality,
and  user  satisfaction  affirmed  its  criti-
cal role. In addition, the importance of
social  capital  in  coproduction  implies
that  (1)  managers  should  pay  more
attention  to  user  representative  selec-
tion;  and  (2)  actions  should  be  taken
when  social  capital  is  low  or  even
absent. Among the three types of social
capital,  cognitive  social  capital  is  rela-
tively important, followed by relational
social capital and structural social cap-
ital,  respectively;  therefore,  users  with
ISD experience and knowledge are rec-
ommended because strong ISD experi-
ence  or  knowledge  allows  representa-
tives to adopt more effective coproduc-
tion behaviors. Although users can con-
tribute to projects even without strong
ISD  knowledge,  relevant  experience
and knowledge allow representatives to
better  engage  in  project  governance
and  joint  problem-solving  activities.  A
lack  of  required  knowledge  reduces
users’ capability to express ideas effec-
tively, and in ways that developers can
capture easily, which blocks them from
making effective contributions. On the
other hand, users who have strong rela-
tionships  with  developers  should 
be  chosen  as  representatives.  In  a  cli-
mate  of  mutual  trust,  representatives
are more willing to tolerate minor flaws
and to focus on main functions, making
them  more  likely  to  accommodate
developers’ ideas and to dedicate indi-
vidual time and effort to the project. In
order  to  increase  users’  willingness  to
contribute  to  the  project,  we  strongly

encourage  project  managers  to  nomi-
nate  possible  candidates,  based  on
their  IT  knowledge,  their  relationships
between  development  team  members,
and  their  history  of  interaction  with
developers.  Finally,  some  current  user
participation  practices  should  be
enhanced; for example, users are often
invited  to  engage  in  the  requirement
eliciting stage only. We suggest that they
should be included in regular meetings
to  increase  the  interaction  between
users and developers so as to promote
users’ willingness to perform coproduc-
tion behaviors.

It 

is  not  uncommon  for  new
employees  or  users  without  any  ISD
experience  or  IT  knowledge  to  be
selected  to  participate  in  projects.
When  a  strong  relationship  between
these  two  parties  or  experienced  users
is not available, interventions should be
made  to  enhance  the  social  capital
between  users  and  the  development
team. Workshops  or  training  programs
may  be  provided  to  strengthen  repre-
sentatives’ knowledge and understand-
ing of ISD to facilitate their engagement
to  deepen  their  contributions  toward
the  project.  In  addition,  managers
should  provide  mechanisms  to  allow
users  and  developers  to  interact  with
each other frequently. Orientations, for-
mal meetings, or even informal parties
allow  both  user  representatives  and
developers 
to  exchange  opinions 
and  help  users  to  better  understand
project progress. ■
