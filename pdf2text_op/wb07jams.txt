Customer-based corporate reputation of a service firm:
scale development and validation

Abstract Although corporate reputation has attracted sig-
nificant attention among marketing scholars, current mea-
sures of it do not adequately capture the perceptions of the
most
important stakeholder group, customers, and often
overlook its relationship to important customer-outcome
variables. In this article, we identify dimensions of customer-
based corporate reputation and develop scales to measure
these dimensions (Study 1). Based on comprehensive valida-
tion procedures across three service firm types, we found
support for a five-dimensional scale with the following
dimensions: Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reliable
and Financially Strong Company, Product and Service
Quality, and Social and Environmental Responsibility. In
Study 2, using a second sample, we validate our scale and
examine its relationship with important customer-outcome
variables—customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, and word of
mouth. Most of the reputation dimensions were strongly
associated with important outcome variables, with a few
exceptions. We discuss the results with reference to the
marketing implications.

Introduction

Companies are identified, in part, by the value of their good
name, and there is growing recognition amongst marketing
academics and practitioners that the managerial consider-
ations of reputation are no less significant than those in-
volved with operational,
legal, and financial decisions.
Corporate reputation, as experienced by various stake-
holders, is critical because it helps to reduce transaction
costs, and positively influences both financial and customer-
outcome variables, such as consumer trust and loyalty
(Caruana et al. 2004; Dowling 2001; Kreps and Wilson
1982; Roberts and Dowling 2002; Rose and Thomsen
2004; Shapiro 1983; Williamson 1985). Indeed, Kay (1993)
identified corporate reputation as an important factor in
achieving corporate success and Figlewicz and Szwajkowski
(2002) demonstrate that it strongly covaries with share-
holder evaluation. Several authors suggest that companies
with a good reputation have a competitive advantage and are
likely to attract more customers (Gardberg and Fombrun
2002; Gotsi and Wilson 2001; Groenland 2002).

In order to manage their reputation, service firms need to
measure it and understand its connection with important
customer outcome variables. The topic of conceptualizing
and measuring corporate reputation has attracted consider-
able attention in the marketing and management literature
(Davies et al. 2002; Fombrun 2001; Fombrun and Shanley
1990; Fryxell and Wang 1994; Gardberg and Fombrun 2002;
Wartick 2002). However, previous studies have focused on
samples composed of
industrial customers or multiple
stakeholder groups (Doney and Cannon 1997; Fombrun
et al. 2000),
largely neglecting end-use customers. Our
review of the literature shows that research in this area,
especially with regard to conceptualizing and measuring
corporate reputation, is limited in several respects.

First, Fombrun and Shanley (1990:254) called for
future research that better specifies “the dimensionality of
the [corporate reputation] construct.” It seems their call has
remained largely unanswered. Although several researchers
have examined the problems of measuring corporate
reputation, there is little agreement as to whether corporate
reputation is a unidimensional or multidimensional con-
struct. Recent studies suggest
the latter to be the case
(Davies et al. 2002; Fombrun et al. 2000). Second, previous
studies have mainly focused on identifying sources of
reputation while the potential consequences and correlates
of corporation reputation have received less attention (G.
H. Jones et al. 2000; Selnes 1993; Weiss et al. 1999).
Finally, there is a conspicuous lack of reputation studies
focusing on end-use customers.

In summary, the dearth of empirical studies examining
customers’ perceptions of corporate reputation and their
relationship to customer-related behaviors, along with the
lack of available multidimensional scales, prompted this
study. In this study we investigate the dimensions of the
customer-based corporate reputation construct in a service
context. As a starting point, we draw from an existing
multidimensional scale and exploratory research, to devel-
op a new multidimensional customer-based corporate
reputation measure for service firms, which is subsequently
measured, validated, and applied. We end with a dis-
cussion, which also includes implications and future
research suggestions.

Conceptual background—corporate reputation
and customer outcome variables

The concept of corporate reputation

In the strategy literature, corporate reputation is considered
an intangible asset
that can contribute to a competitive
advantage in the marketplace of goods and services (Barney
2002; Dowling 1994, 2004; Hall 1992; Milgrom and
Roberts 1982). In this context Fombrun (1996) refers to
this intangible asset as reputational capital. Consistent with
the resource-based view of the firm, reputation may be
viewed as a valuable resource that should be managed by
the firm (Barney 2002, 1991; Dowling 2001; van Riel
1997). Fombrun and Shanley (1990) view corporate
reputation as the outcome of a competitive process in
which a firm signals its key characteristics to constituents in
order to maximize its economic and non-economic status.
Essentially, strategy research focuses on obtaining an
advantage over competitors that is sustainable over time
(Mahon 2002).

In the marketing and management literature, corporate
reputation is discussed primarily with regard to people

that have ties to a firm. The concept of reputation is founded
on the general premise that a favorable general estimation
that the public has of an individual or organization will
positively impact on the public’s attitude and behaviors
toward that entity (Fombrun 1996; Fombrun and Rindova
1996; Fombrun and Shanley 1990). A review of the literature
reveals that corporate reputation may be traced back to at
least three business topics: (1) quality management, (2) trans-
action costs research, and (3) market-entry-barriers.

Adopting an information economics perspective, Akerlof
(1970), on the market for used cars, explains how, among
other factors, reputation is a useful
to ensure the
production of quality services and to project information
about it. The quality-enhancing effect of reputation can be
explained by noting that companies offering poor service
quality will be penalized by customers, who will avoid
further purchases and will engage in negative word of
mouth (Fombrun and van Riel 1997).

tool

Creating and sustaining reputation between sellers (com-
panies) and buyers (customers) is an important strategy for
reducing transaction costs (Compés López and Poole 1998).
Companies and customers tend to prefer to deal with
companies that have proven reliable in the past. Implicit
contracts between sellers and buyers are a common form of
agreement, and give rise to varying levels of uncertainty
and transaction costs. Reichheld (1996) argues that as cus-
tomers get
to know the supplier through repeated pur-
chases, they become less dependent on the employees for
information and advice, which, in turn, can be translated
into lower costs.

Moreover, a good reputation may be viewed as a market-
entry barrier for competitors because a good reputation is
difficult to replicate (Dierickx and Cool 1989; Roberts and
Dowling 2002), and building a good reputation incurs costs
(Barney 1991; Hall 1993; Rose and Thomsen 2004). Using
a game theoretical approach, Milgrom and Roberts (1982)
demonstrate that if players continue to engage in the same
action, the opponent players will expect them to play the
same strategy in the future. With this line of reasoning, a
service firm interested in building a strong reputation will
accept costs in the short-run and make an investment in
reputation because the firm expects the long-term benefits
to outweigh the cost. However, a service firm that intends
to enter a mature market might be discouraged to do so due to
the high costs needed to establish their reputation.

Customer-based corporate reputation

Corporate reputation has been addressed in many different
disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, economics,
management, and marketing (Fombrun 1996). See Table 1
for a representative sampling of the diverse definitions

A reputation is therefore a collective assessment of a company’s ability to provide valued outcomes

about a person or other entity, in a stakeholder or interest group

In essence, reputation is a result of the past actions of a firm
Is identical to all stakeholders’ perception of a given firm, i.e. based on what they think they know
about the firm, so a corporation’s reputation may simply reflect people’s perceptions

associated with corporate reputation in the literature. Our
definition of customer-based corporate reputation acknowl-
edges existing definitions of corporate reputation, while
also conceptualizing it as an attitude-like evaluative
judgment of firms.

Drawing on logical partitioning, which involves catego-
rizing definitions with the same properties and labeling
categories (Hunt 1991), allows us to identify common
features among existing definitions. While different authors
suggest different definitions of corporate reputation, most
of these definitions share some common elements. After
examining previous definitions of corporate reputation, we
identified two issues to address: (1) the view that corporate
reputation is a collective phenomenon, and (2) the idea that
corporate reputation is seldom conceptualized as including
direct and indirect interaction experiences.

Most authors who have defined corporate reputation seem
to agree that it is important at a collective level, as their
definitions revolve around a particular stakeholder group’s
ability to recognize and correctly interpret “what a firm
stands for.” An implicit assumption seems to be that all
stakeholders have a shared value system and may also share
similar perceptions of the firm. Such assumptions tend to de-
emphasize the importance of a particularly important
segment—customers, who may have different expectations
and perceptions of a service firm than other stakeholders,
such as stockholders, competitors, and employees.

Furthermore, only a few conceptualizations have repre-
sented corporate reputation as a phenomenon that
is
associated with a firm’s actions and with its customers’
first-hand experiences with the given firm. Only Wang et al.
(2003) and Herbig and Milewicz (1993) suggest
that
corporate reputation results from previous actions of a
given service firm, which a customer will have heard about

or directly experienced him- or herself (see also Dacin and
Brown’s (2002) conceptualization of a closely related
concept, corporate associations).

Thus, in our view and similar to customer satisfaction
that is conceptualized as an attitude-like judgment after a
purchase (Fournier and Mick 1999), corporate reputation
may be viewed as a customer’s evaluation that results from
either or both his or her personal interaction experience
with the service firm, as well as from reputation-relevant
information received about the firm. Fishbein and Ajzen
(1975:6) conceptualize attitudes as learned predispositions
“to respond in a consistently favorable or unfavorable
manner” towards a given object. Sirgy (1985) argues that
goods and services, similar to people, can be conceptual-
ized as having personality images, such as modern or
friendly, suggesting that customers that associate positive
attributes with a firm are likely to form a favorable attitude
toward the firm. In a similar vein, Johnson and Zinkhan
(1990:346) argue that firms, “like individuals, have identi-
fiable characteristics.”

We define customer-based reputation (CBR) as the
customer’s overall evaluation of a firm based on his or
her reactions to the firm’s goods, services, communication
activities, interactions with the firm and/or its representa-
tives or constituencies (such as employees, management, or
other customers) and/or known corporate activities, and
will hereafter be referred to as CBR. This evaluation may
serve as a “quality promise” which could push a firm to
focus on serving its customers with high quality goods and
services with integrity and honesty. If executed well, a
strong CBR can reduce transaction costs and perceived risk
of customers, encourage greater loyalty, and act as a
formidable barrier to entry (Dierickx and Cool 1989; Rose
and Thomsen 2004).


130

J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2007) 35:127–143

In summary, we believe that CBR is a unique concept
that differs from other conceptualizations of corporate
reputation in which various stakeholders view and judge a
firm.
In our conceptualization we explicitly consider
customers’ personal experiences with and perceptions about
a firm. For example, practitioner corporate reputation
ratings such as the U.S.-based Fortune America’s Most
Admired Companies or Germany’s Manager Magazin
rating, primarily rely on the perceptions of senior managers,
directors, and financial analysts, who are not necessarily
customers of the firms they are evaluating. Indeed,
the
Fortune approach was criticized on several grounds, with
Fombrun et al. (2000:245–246) arguing that it relies “on the
perceptions of a limited respondent pool that over-represents
senior managers, directors, and financial analysts.” Fryxell
and Wang (1994) demonstrate that the majority of the eight
Fortune dimensions are related to financial performance.

We argue that different stakeholders may hold different
views of the same firm’s reputation based on their needs,
own economic, social and personal background (Fombrun
1996; Zinkhan et al. 2001) and on their different relation-
ships with the firm (Dowling 2001). Since a firm’s
corporate reputation encapsulates the history of other
people’s experience with a firm (Fombrun 1996), a firm
can have multiple reputations, with a different set of
attributes for different stakeholder groups (Wartick 2002).
For example, whereas customers can assess a service firm’s
service quality and might be able to judge its community
and environmental friendliness, they may struggle to judge
its use of assets. Thus, the various dimensions of corporate
reputation may be perceived differently by different au-
diences and different audiences may attach different
weights to these dimensions or even use somewhat different
criteria to evaluate a firm. We believe these differences are
significant enough to investigate customers’ views of
reputation specifically, as we do in this study.

Corporate reputation and important
customer-outcome variables

In their frequently-cited article, Fombrun and Shanley
(1990:235) argue that “reputational consequences are also
worthy of considerable attention in future research.” We
believe that the importance of corporate reputation ulti-
mately will be assessed on the basis of its impact and
economic relevance to companies. A review of
the
literature shows that a good corporate reputation is thought
to have a positive influence on different monetary as well as
behavior-related constructs. In this study, we examine
important customer-outcome variables related to a good or
bad CBR.

reputations are particularly important

Zinkhan et al. (2001) argue that when stakeholders, such
interact with a firm they often lack the
as customers,
capacity and inclination to gather accurate firm-related
information. A firm’s reputation then becomes a surrogate
indicator of the quality of goods or services. It can be
argued that
in
credence services which are notably difficult for customers
to evaluate (Bromley 2001; Hardaker and Fill 2005). As
Wang et al. (2003:76) argue “Reputation plays an especially
important strategic role in service markets because the pre-
purchase evaluation of service quality is necessarily vague
and incomplete.” Due to their intangibility, the quality of
services may be more difficult to evaluate by consumers
and thus, service firms may be more likely to feel the
effects of reputation than other types of firms (Fombrun
1996; Kim and Choi 2003).

With regard to customer-outcome variables, previous
research suggests that corporate reputation is associated
with (1) customer satisfaction (Davies et al. 2002; Walsh
et al. 2006), (2) loyalty (Fombrun and van Riel 1997; Hall
1992),
(Doney and Cannon 1997), and (4)
positive word of mouth (Fombrun and van Riel 1997;
Groenland 2002).

trust

(3)

Nguyen and Leblanc (2001) argue that reputation can be
used to effectively predict
the outcome of the service-
production process, and can, perhaps, be considered the
most reliable indicator of the service firm’s ability to satisfy
a customer’s desires. We argue that customers care about
reputation as a differentiator since many service firms are
otherwise very similar. Customers may infer higher quality
and/or value when a service firm has a good reputation and
thus, satisfaction should be positively associated with CBR
(Oliver and DeSarbo 1988).

Zinkhan et al. (2001) argue that customers’ perceptions
of a firm are strongly associated with their attitudes toward
the firm, while Roberts and Dowling (2002) suggest that
customers value associations and transactions with high
reputation companies. A positive reputation therefore is
likely to attract and keep loyal customers (Fombrun and
van Riel 1997; Greyser 1999; Hall 1992; Yoon et al. 1993).
Thus, a company’s reputation should be positively associ-
ated with customers’ loyalty to the firm.

Since the benefits of reputation postulated in the liter-
ature are often associated with the reduction of uncertainty,
a positive CBR-trust relationship can be expected. Like
previous researchers (Moorman et al. 1992), we see trust in
terms of willingness to rely on an exchange partner in
whom one has confidence. Thus, a firm with a more
credible reputation will also be more highly trusted by the
customer.

In regards to word of mouth, positive (negative) com-
pany reputations should be associated with more positive
(negative) word of mouth. Customers love to pass along

131

their service experiences with firms, especially when
these experiences are either very good or very poor
(Anderson 1998). Sundaram et al. (1998) found that one
motive for positive or negative word of mouth was “helping
the company.” Thus, it is likely that companies with more
positive reputations have a greater reservoir of goodwill
and their pleased customers will tend to act as company
advocates.

Thus, in Study 2 we examine the relationship between
important customer-outcome variables,
CBR and four
namely (1) Satisfaction, (2) Loyalty, (3) Trust, and (4)
Word of mouth. We anticipate that all CBR dimensions will
be positively associated with these variables. That is, we
believe that firms with better reputations will have more
satisfied, loyal, and trusting customers, who, in turn, may
pass along their positive feelings to others.

The scale development process

To extend previous research on corporate reputation
measures and to develop the CBR scale, we employed
both qualitative and quantitative methods. Following
Churchill’s (1979) paradigm and other scale-development
studies (Arnold and Reynolds 2003; Netemeyer et al.
1995), we generated and extended measures through

qualitative research and exploratory efforts. All of our
initial scale development efforts were conducted in Ger-
many using German respondents and language. The
measures were then translated into English and back-
translated (Sekaran 1983) and the quantitative studies
reported here (Studies 1 and 2) proceeded in English in
the U.S. Study 1 focused on scale refinement, while Study
2, using an independent sample, focused on scale validation
and nomological validity. Figure 1 summarizes the scale
development procedures employed here.

The primary existing multidimensional scale now in the
literature is the Reputation Quotient (RQ). Fombrun et al.
(2000:243) developed this scale and defined corporate
reputation as a “collective assessment of a company’s
ability to provide valued outcomes to a representative group
of stakeholders.” After conducting numerous focus groups
and factor analyses of data sets gathered across multiple
constituencies, Fombrun et al. (2000) concluded that the
RQ consisted of six dimensions that are likely to affect
stakeholders’ behavior and company profits, namely: (1)
Emotional Appeal; (2) Products and Services; (3) Vision and
Leadership; (4) Workplace Environment; (5) Social and
Environmental Responsibility; and (6) Financial Performance.
They used principal components analysis to develop the
RQ, reporting an alpha coefficient for the 20-item scale of
0.84. However, they preferred to treat corporate reputation

as an overall phenomenon rather than breaking it into its six
individual dimensions when testing its reliability.

The corporate reputation scale of Fombrun et al. was
created to be used across constituencies and company types
(Groenland 2002; Walsh and Wiedmann 2004), while our
focus is on customers and service firms only. However,
given its wide acceptance, we choose to use the RQ items
in our scale development work, as well as to conduct
further qualitative and quantitative research to more fully
develop our CBR scale. The RQ appears to capture some
facets of CBR. For example, the RQ dimension Products
and Services is likely to be highly relevant to customers and
is the one most closely associated with the ideas underlying
the SERVQUAL scale (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry,
1988). Accordingly, our scale development procedure
included the 20 RQ items, along with our new items
developed from our qualitative work.

Scale generation

Dimensions of corporate reputation and item generation
Prior to item generation, an open-ended elicitation procedure
(Netemeyer et al. 1995) was conducted to ensure that the
author-generated construct definition was consistent with the
views of corporate reputation by typical customers. Twelve
German business-administration students and ten non-stu-
dents responded to the following statement: “Please provide a
brief description of the firm characteristics and actions that
you would associate with the words ‘good reputation’ or ‘bad
reputation.’ Please be specific in providing traits, actions, and
behaviors you would consider reflective of corporate reputa-
tion.” Informants were asked to expand on their responses in
regards to why they felt as they did. Their responses revolved
around their feelings and cognitions of firms based on their
experiences and interactions with them, which was consistent
with our conceptualization of the construct.

The second qualitative study consisted of 48 depth
interviews which were conducted with German students
majoring in marketing (n=30) and non-students (n=18).
The non-student group was composed of shoppers who
were intercepted in the city center of a major northern
German city and asked to participate. The purpose of the
depth interviews was to uncover different
facets of
corporate reputation that could be further investigated in
the quantitative survey. The interviewers (one of the authors
and three students) used a discussion guide and had specific
instructions as to how to conduct
the interviews. All
individuals were asked the following questions:
& What traits or actions do you associate with the words

“reputation” and “corporate reputation”?

& What distinguishes a good company from a bad company?
& What factors influence a company’s reputation?

Individuals had no difficulty articulating their associa-
tions with the idea of corporate reputation. Consistent with
and expanding on our first qualitative study above, we
noted that corporate reputation tended to be linked to
consumers’ experiences with the actions or
traits of
companies that accrued over time, as well as what they
had heard or had read about a firm.

Further, we noted that on average, each informant made
between seven and eight responses overall. Two of the
researchers carrying out the project coded the responses
independently by themes as they emerged from the
responses (Gremler 2004). They showed a high level of
agreement (Bijou et al. 1968; Hughes and Garrett 1990).
Interrater reliability was calculated with Spearman correla-
tion coefficient between the informants’ assessment and
was r=0.69 (p<0.05). The responses were transcribed and
scrutinized by the researchers. Based on these responses, 40
items were developed by the researchers that seemed to
capture the essence of points made by our informants.
These 40 items were complemented by the 20 RQ items of
Fombrun et al. (2000), which were translated into German
by the authors.

Three marketing academics and two Ph.D. students, not
familiar with the details of the research project, were then
asked to assess the readability of the 60 items. Then eight
managers (from medium to large German firms) and fifteen
students were asked to qualitatively assess the face validity
and construct validity of the items. Using the Q-sort
technique (Funder et al. 2000), each item in the initial pool
was printed on an index card and each judge was asked to
carefully read the card and assign the responses to
categories based on similarity of the representing aspects
of CBR. It was up to the judges to decide on the number of
categories he or she used. One additional category was
included to capture ambiguous or unclear
items. The
proportion of agreement among judges was high, demon-
strating high reliability. Interrater reliability was calculated
with Spearman correlation coefficient between the manager
and student group members’ assessments (r=0.82; p<0.05).
This sorting procedure (Kerlinger 1986; Moore and
Benbasat 1999) produced seven categories of customer-
based corporate reputation with a total of 46 items (including
all twenty RQ items). Fourteen items were dropped because
a number of judges identified them as being too ambiguous
to fit into one of the seven categories that emerged.

The next step consisted of three marketing academics
and two Ph.D. students examining the allocation of cards to
the seven categories by the judges. The aim was to find
appropriate labels for the categories. The academics and Ph.D.
students had to come up with labels individually. Overall, they
used similar labels for the seven categories. All the labels
suggested were scrutinized by the researchers carrying out the
project and when different labels were suggested they were

discussed among the researchers until a label was agreed upon.
The seven dimensions that emerged from this procedure were:
Customer Orientation, Fairness and Social Responsibility,
Financial Performance, Product and Service Quality, Sympa-
thy, Transparency, and Communications and Appearance.
They are defined in Table 2 and shown relative to the RQ
dimensions of Fombrun et al. (2000).

Initial purification The process of item reduction included
several steps. First, two managers, three marketing academ-
ics, and three marketing students formed a panel to further
scrutinize the items. Driven by face-validity considerations,
two items were eliminated by this panel. Next,
three
marketing Ph.D. students were given the conceptual
descriptions of the seven dimensions and asked to rate the
44 items as either “very applicable,” “somewhat applica-
ble,” or “not applicable” relative to the respective dimen-
sion. Items were retained if the judges consistently rated the
item to be at least “somewhat applicable.” This judgment
procedure resulted in the retention of 39 items with five to

items, 2 items measuring perceptions of overall reputation,

Study 1—scale refinement

We conducted an online survey of customers in regards to
their current provider in one of three categories:
their
banking services (32% of the respondents), retailing (32%),
or fast-food restaurants (36%). These services were selected
because they all
involve low to medium amounts of
interaction opportunities and include customer-service

The online questionnaire was accessible through a link
that was sent to marketing students from a major southern
university by e-mail. Students majoring in marketing were
instructed to recruit five people to fill out the survey. Four
of these five people had to be non-students and represent a
range of ages, genders, and professions. The data collection
process lasted three weeks. More than 500 people answered
the questionnaire, representing approximately a 60% re-
sponse rate of those individuals asked to respond. Most
respondents (36%) fell into the 18–29 age group. Table 3
provides a description of the sample characteristics, as well
as mean years of relationships with their chosen company.
In the first step of the measurement procedure, the ap-
propriateness of the 39 items for capturing the seven dimen-
sions of CBR was tested using exploratory factor analysis
(principal axis factor analysis with Oblique rotation).1 A
measure of sampling adequacy value of 0.76 indicated that
the correlation matrix was only moderately adequate for
principal axis analytical purposes. All correlations were
scrutinized and eight items with low item-to-item correla-
tions (r<0.20) were eliminated. Another exploratory factor

1 We conducted a principal axis factor analysis because it tends to be
used when the purpose is to get the least number of factors which can
account for the common variance (correlation), excluding variable-
specific variance (Hatcher 1994; Malhotra 1999). Also, principal axis
factoring allows the dimensions to be related to each other. Oblique
rotation was chosen because we expected the dimensions to be
correlated.

analysis was conducted on the remaining 31 statements; a
minimum eigenvalue of 1 was selected as the criterion for
inclusion (Kim and Mueller 1978). The result was a five-
factor solution that accounted for 66% of variation. A
measure of sampling adequacy value of 0.96 indicated that the
correlation matrix was “marvelous” (Kaiser 1974) for principal
axis analytical purposes. There were no significant cross
loadings on the rotated factors. All items had high factor
loadings of above 0.40 (see Column 1, Table 4).

These five dimensions do a good job of representing the
originally postulated seven dimensions with greater parsi-
mony. We labeled the five new empirically-derived factors,
Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reliable and
Financially Strong Company, Product and Service Quality,
and Social and Environmental Responsibility. These factors
are defined in Table 2 in the last column, while the final
items for each are addressed below.

Customer Orientation includes six, mainly new items
and has the highest eigenvalue (3.55), suggesting its
importance in a CBR measure. Good Employer contains
five items that loaded onto the factors Workplace Environ-
ment (three items), Vision and Leadership (one item), and
Social and Environmental Responsibility (one item) in the

Next,

the five-factor structure identified with the
exploratory factor analysis was tested using confirmatory
factor analysis. A 31-item, five-dimension confirmatory
factor model was estimated using LISREL 8.7, and
inspection of model fit revealed a reasonable overall fit
(GFI=0.90, AGFI=0.90, NNFI=0.90, CFI=0.91, RMR=
0.06, RMSEA=0.08, and χ2=1,128.63, df=329 (χ2/df=
3.43; p<0.001). All 31 items were retained, although some
indicators had coefficients of determination just above the
threshold of 0.40 (standardized loadings ranged from 0.65
to 0.88). The average variances extracted (AVE)2 of each
dimension was above 0.50 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988; Fornell
and Larcker 1981). The results of this confirmatory factor
analysis are reported in Column 2 of Table 4.

Drawing on Ping (2004), the validity of the CBR scale
was determined on the basis of two criteria: content validity
and construct validity. The latter includes discriminant and
convergent validity. In addition, we assess the CBR scale’s
predictive validity. Based on high inter-item correlations
and our qualitative results, the CBR scale appears to be
reasonably content valid.

Evidence of discriminant validity among the dimensions
of our CBR scale was provided by a test suggested by
Fornell and Larcker (1981). Here, discriminant validity
between two factors is shown when individual average
variance extracted for each latent variable exceeds the
squared phi correlation between both latent variables. All
possible pairs of factors passed this test, suggesting the
discriminant validity of the dimensions in our CBR scale.
The correlations range from 0.31 to 0.63. The squared
correlations range from 0.10 to 0.40.

Convergent validity was established by examining the
AVE of each dimension. The AVE is a measure of the
amount of variance captured by a construct from each scale.
The AVE has recommended values of 0.50 or higher to
provide evidence for convergent validity (Fornell and
Larcker 1981). The AVE of the five CBR dimensions
ranged from 0.53 to 0.67, hence indicating convergent
validity. Convergent validity assumes that measures of
constructs that should be theoretically related to each other
are,
in fact, found to be related to each other. Thus,
convergent validity was further assessed by examining the
association between a related measure, overall reputation,
and the CBR scale. A confirmatory factor analysis was
conducted that included the five CBR dimensions and the
overall reputation variable. Overall reputation was mea-
sured by two items, “Has a good reputation in the market”
and “Is highly reputable.” The confirmatory factor analysis
showed that indicators had high loadings on the predicted
factors and yielded strong and significant correlations

2 The AVE roughly corresponds to the Eigenvalue in Exploratory
Factor Analysis.

between the CBR dimensions and the overall reputation
factor (>0.3, p<0.05).

To assess predictive validity, we regressed the two-item
variable measuring overall reputation on our aggregated
CBR scale. Following Fombrun et al. (2000), the 31 CBR
items in Table 4 (from Column 1) were aggregated while
the dependent variable was created by adding together its
two items. The results of the regression analysis shows a
relatively high value for the coefficient of determination
(R2=0.60) and beta value=0.77 (at p<0.01). This strong,
positive relationship provides support for the predictive
the overall
validity of the CBR measure. In addition,
reputation measure was regressed against
the five CBR
dimensions. The CBR items in Table 4 measuring the five
respective dimensions were aggregated to five composite
variables. The results of the regression analysis, which is
reported in the first
two columns of Table 5, shows a
relatively high coefficient of determination (R2=0.62) and
beta values between 0.22 and 0.68 (at p<0.01).

The scale-generation and refinement procedure resulted
in a five-factor structure of the CBR construct. The five
factors have eigenvalues ranging from 3.6 to 1.4, account-
ing for 66% of the variance. Thus, from the analyses
conducted across the scale refinement stage, 31 items were
retained to measure the five dimensions of CBR. To further
validate our scale, we next discuss the confirmatory factor
analysis we conducted on a second sample to assess the
consistency of the underlying structure with the previous
analysis (Churchill 1979).

Study 2—scale validation

Measure testing As in Study 1, data were collected by
means of online questionnaires. Marketing professors and
instructors from four universities in two states (Alabama
and California) assigned students in their classes to obtain
participants after being trained in interviewing techniques.
As in Study 1, students were instructed to recruit five
participants (four non-students and one student) to fill out
the survey. The questionnaire contained our 31 CBR items
as well as the four customer-outcome variables noted
earlier, customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, and word of
mouth. The data collection process lasted 3 weeks. The
online survey generated 698 usable responses across their
current service provider. The same three service categories
used in study 1 were also used in study 2. See Table 3 for
sample characteristics.

The five-factor structure identified with the first sample
was tested with LISREL 8.7 using confirmatory factor
analysis. The sample showed significant loadings for items
on their respective factors. However, the overall fit for the
five-factor structure suffered because of items with low
factor loadings and high error terms. Three of the 31 items

had coefficients of determination below 0.40 (Bagozzi and
Yi 1988) and were dropped to increase model fit. The
starred items in Column 3 of Table 4 are the three deleted
items. Model identification was achieved and the fit indices
suggest that the model adequately represents the input data
(GFI=0.92, AGFI=0.91, NNFI=0.92, CFI=0.97, RMR=
0.04, RMSEA=0.08, and χ2/df=2.9 (p<0.001)). All indices
exceeded the recommended threshold levels (Bagozzi and
Yi 1988; Browne and Cudeck 1993).3

Acceptable convergent validity was achieved with all
five reputation dimensions producing AVE’s exceeding
0.50. All measures had good reliability, with composite
reliabilities larger than 0.60 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988) and all
indicators had coefficients of determination above 0.40.
Taken collectively, these indices suggest a good model fit.
Results of the reliability analysis and the confirmatory
factor analysis are show in Column 3, Table 4. Standard-
ized residuals and modification indices were reviewed with
the intent to pinpoint potential areas of model misspecifi-
cation (cf. Long 1983; Saris et al. 1987). There were no
unreasonable estimates and all
loadings were
significant, hence, we did not re-estimate our model.4

factor

While the theoretical

justification for the first-order
model has been explored to some extent (Fombrun et al.
2000; Walsh and Wiedmann 2004), little theoretical work
can be found that proposes a second-order model of
corporate reputation. After introducing our multidimen-

3 Model identification was also achieved when the data pertaining to
the three service contexts—banking, retailing, fast-food—were ana-
lyzed separately (GFI=0.90/0.92/0.94, AGFI=0.89/0.93/0.93, NNFI=
0.91/0.93/0.95, CFI=0.97/0.96/0.97, RMR=0.03/0.07/0.05, RMSEA=
0.09/0.08/0.07, χ2/df=3.35/3.09/2.66).
4 We also compared our CBR scale with the RQ of Fombrun et al.
(2000) by performing a confirmatory factor analysis on our data for
the RQ items. The CFA resulted in a marginal model fit (GFI=0.76,
AGFI=0.74, NNFI=0.75, CFI=0.87, RMR=0.06 RMSEA=0.09,
χ2/df=5.72); six indicators had a coefficient of determination of less
than 0.40. A re-specified model with 14 items was calculated, which
led to an improved model fit. Overall, the RQ did not represent our
data very well and not as well as our five-dimensional CBR scale.

sional CBR scale, we examined the relative merits of
customer-based corporate reputation as a second-order
construct. Exploring a higher-order conceptualization is
warranted because of the relatively high intercorrelations of
the five dimensions (Anderson and Gerbing 1988). The fit
of the second-order was acceptable, however, provides a
poorer fit than the multidimensional model.5

Because three of the 31 items identified in study 1 were
dropped, we decided to assess the predictive validity of the
more parsimonious 28-item scale. The variable measuring
overall reputation was regressed on the five aggregated
CBR sub scales. The results of the regression analysis,
which are reported in Columns 3 and 4 in Table 5, show a
high coefficient of determination (R2=0.66) and beta values
between 0.19 and 0.65 (at p<0.05).

Assessing nomological validity To establish nomological
validity, we examine how well the CBR scale relates to
other variables. Thus in addition to the CBR scales, the
questionnaire in study 2 included four customer outcome
scales measuring customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, and
word of mouth. These four measures are expected to be
positively associated with corporate reputation. To show a
measure has nomological validity, the correlation between
the measure and other related constructs should behave as
expected in theory (Churchill 1995). The four related
variables were operationalized with three (Customer Satis-
faction, Loyalty, Word of mouth) and six (Trust) items,
respectively. Items for the four outcome measures were
based on prior items in the literature, as noted in Table 6.
The reliability of these scales was assessed with a compo-
site reliability coefficient (ranging from 0.77 to 0.89) and
confirmatory factor analysis, which clearly confirmed the
appropriateness of the operationalizations (see Table 6).

5 The second-order model exhibits a marginal to acceptable fit (GFI=
0.84, AGFI=0.82, NNFI=0.86, CFI=0.87, RMR=0.04, RMSEA=
0.07, and χ2=1392.545, df=345 (χ2/df=4.03, p=0.00)). The χ2/df
value is higher than that of the multidimensional model, but within the
acceptable range of 2–5 (Marsh and Hovecar 1985).

Given the predicted positive association between the five
CBR sub scales and the four outcome variables, correlations
were examined to assess nomological validity. Correlations
and descriptive statistics are provided in Table 7. Seventeen
of the 20 correlations between the reputation dimensions
and the customer outcome variables were significant at p<
0.05. These associations will be discussed below but
overall, the measures correlated in a manner predicted by
theory, supporting nomological validity.

Results by dimension The dimension Product and Service
Quality had the strongest and most consistent correlations for
the CBR dimensions with the outcome variables-trust (0.57),
word of mouth (0.54), customer satisfaction (0.49), and
loyalty (0.45). This dimension is highly relevant because of
its close linkage with customers’ experiences with the service
firm. Through their first-hand experience with the firm,
customers are well equipped to evaluate the firm’s product
and service quality and accordingly use these perceptions in
their evaluation of important outcome variables.

The reputation dimension Good Employer correlates
relatively strongly with all outcome variables—word of
mouth (0.46), trust (0.39), customer satisfaction (0.32), and

treats its employees well and that

Customer Orientation also correlates relatively strongly
with all four outcomes—customer satisfaction (0.40), loyalty
(0.34), word of mouth (0.32), and trust (0.21). This is con-
sistent with previous work (Heskett et al. 1994; Taylor and
Baker 1994) that postulates a strong customer orientation-
satisfaction link. The importance of customer orientation for
service organizations services is widely recognized and there
is empirical support for a link between customer orientated
selling and sales performance (cf. Brown et al. 2002; Saxe
and Weitz 1982).

The dimension Reliable and Financially Strong Compa-
ny correlates with three of the four related measures—trust
(0.38), word of mouth (0.32), and loyalty (0.24), but not
with customer satisfaction. The dimension Social and
Environmental Responsibility had a positive association
only with trust (0.37) and customer satisfaction (0.20), but
not with loyalty or word of mouth. The relatively weaker
and less consistent associations of Reliable and Financially
Strong Company and Social and Environmental Responsi-
bility with the customer-outcome variables suggest
that
these two dimensions are less relevant to consumers in their
relationships with their service firms. In regards to financial
strength, consumers would have less knowledge of their
companies’ strengths and may find this information less
relevant in their dealings with the company. In regards to
responsibility, Page and Fearn (2005) show that the firms’
“public responsibility” matters less to most consumers than
other reputation dimensions. Similarly, Brown and Dacin

(1997:70) argue that strategies geared toward social
responsibility may influence how consumers think about a
company, but “offer consumers little information that is di-
rectly associated with the products and services it produces.”

Discussion

Five of
the seven dimensions of corporate reputation
initially identified in the qualitative studies were supported
by the two stages of quantitative data collection and
assessment: Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reli-
able and Financially Strong Company, Product and Service
Quality, and Social and Environmental Responsibility. We
believe this is an important step in providing the field with
a customer-based corporate reputation scale. Our primary
contribution to theory lies in developing and testing a CBR
scale that captures the views of customers who have
interacted with their service firms.

Further we believe that conceptualizing CBR as a
multidimensional construct has benefits at both the conceptual
and managerial level. Our scale enables marketers to study and
measure customer-based corporate reputation at different
levels of abstraction. To create and use an overall scale
without considering the individual dimensions of corporate
reputation would be to lose the ability to see how these
different dimensions work. Researchers and service firms
should consider both individual CBR dimensions (lower level
of abstraction) and their effects on important outcomes, as well
as the overall CBR score (higher level of abstraction) to learn
about overall attitudes towards the firm. A firm must
understand how it stands on the different dimensions of
reputation in order to know how to improve its corporate
reputation.

The linkages we found between the dimensions and
important customer-outcome variables support our view that
an understanding of corporate reputation is important for
service firms’ strategic marketing activities and effective
communication with different end-use customers. Further, the
proposed dimensions contribute to a greater understanding of
the dimensionality and outcomes of corporate reputation and
builds on previous scale development work (Fombrun et al.
2000; Groenland 2002). In fact, four of our five dimensions
overlapped considerably with the six-dimensional corporate
reputation scale of Fombrun et al. Our findings support our
arguments that corporate reputation is a multidimensional
construct that affects customers’ reactions to the firm.

Through an exhaustive process of scale development we
developed a five dimensional conceptualization of consumer-
based corporate reputation and the corresponding items for
each dimension. We further conducted a series of validity and
reliability assessments across two large scale data collections
in order to insure that our CBR scale adequately captured the
conceptualization we had.

Then to assess the nomological validity of our scale, we
examined the association between these dimensions and four
important consumer outcome variables. Predictably three of
these dimensions were most consistently related to our four
outcome variables—product and service quality, good em-
ployer, and customer orientation. These were also the three
variables with the highest beta coefficients in the regression
analyses in which an overall reputation measure served as the
dependent variable. We say predictably because these are the
variables that have been most tied to consumer outcomes in
the past. For example, product and service quality is
conceptually similar to the SERVQUAL scale, which has
been heavily associated with important outcome variables (cf.
Parasuraman et al. 1990).

Further, it is much harder to conceptually argue that
consumers care about the financial health of the service
companies they interact with (unless it affects them per-
sonally). Also, it is not at all clear that consumers would be
more loyal or more positively disposed towards firms that
are more environmentally concerned. Certainly there are
segments of the market that may be highly concerned about
the company’s corporate environmental consciousness—but
most likely many more are simply interested in the way the
company treats them and their employees (who in turn treat
the customers well). Thus, an examination of market
segments and how they perceive and/or care about
the
company’s policies and practices would be a useful
extension of this research.

Limitations and future research directions

As we seek to understand the value of a good corporate
reputation, there is need for additional research. Also, our
research is not free of limitations, which introduce future
research options. Our findings have several implications in
regards to future research. We concentrated only on service
firms and customers of service firms here. Although it
seems reasonable that these findings would extend to firms
other than service firms, this should be assessed in future
research. For example,
future research could explore
whether an adaptation of the CBR scale would be appro-
priate for manufacturing firms or for service firms that
deliver through self-service technologies or the internet,
which involve less or no interpersonal interaction. Further,
the issue of how non-customers evaluate service firms and
the degree to which the five CBR dimensions are relevant
to non-customers, as well, merits further investigation.

Replications could test the CBR scale in other service
industries and in other cultures. Future research could
examine different service industries, using cross-sectional
data and cross-national data both within and across
industries. Given its importance, it is clear that firms would
want
to know how to manage their customer-based
corporate reputation effectively. Further testing should be
conducted in expanded settings to assess the dimensions
and the scales presented here. We see the scale as a
generalized services CBR scale that can be adapted to
specific circumstances or firms. However, it is important to
note that the purified scale captures broad dimensions of
CBR, yet it is also parsimonious. Future applications of the
CBR scale may also involve additional validity assess-
ments. For example, the CBR scale’s discriminate validity
against related scales could be assessed.

Also similar to research on reputation outcomes, ante-
cedents of CBR have received limited research attention. The
few existing empirical studies focus on predictors of corporate
reputation, such as critical news reports and negative incidents

(cf. Dunbar and Schwalbach 2000), but do not distinguish
between different dimensions of corporate reputation. Thus,
studying how reputation perceptions are formed and impacted
by firm actions would be highly useful.

Finally, prior research suggests that corporate reputa-
tion affects business performance (Rose and Thomsen
2004). Understanding how overall CBR as well as indi-
vidual CBR dimensions affect actual consumer behaviors
and ultimately important marketing metrics, such as sales,
market share, and purchasing rate is an important area of
future research.

Managerial implications

Conventional managerial wisdom holds that attending to
corporate reputation makes good business sense because
relevant commercial and non-commercial factors are af-
fected. Based on the results of this study, a more differ-
entiated analysis seems appropriate. As understanding
customers is fundamental to successful business strategies
of service firms, service firms could use our CBR dimen-
sions to examine their impact on important consequences.
is suited to gather
benchmark data in service firms regarding current levels
of customer-based corporate reputation as well as conduct
periodic checks to measure reputation improvements.
Practitioners can determine overall CBR as well as dimen-
sions of CBR. The CBR scale could serve as a diagnostic
tool that will allow service firms to determine reputation-
relevant areas that are weak and in need of attention.

Our proposed measurement

tool

Our

findings suggest

that an unfavorable corporate
reputation is negatively associated with satisfaction, loyalty,
trust, and word of mouth, and, hence, should be of concern
to companies. By specifying the dimension of reputation
that is most relevant in more detail appropriate steps could
be taken by companies to avoid a negative reputation.
Companies that are able to improve their reputation and
emphasize their social and environmental orientation
toward customers, for example, may be in a better position
to increase satisfaction and build trust.

By analyzing corporate reputation dimensions and their
relationships to relevant outcomes firms could better decide
on which reputation dimensions to focus on. The impor-
tance of the product and service quality dimension can not
be underestimated. Also, we showed the importance of
customer orientation, which is consistent with the consid-
erable literature available on the construct of customer
orientation, even though it is generally not conceived of as
a corporate reputation dimension (Deshpande et al. 1993;
Saxe and Weitz 1982).

Given the supremacy of three of the CBR dimensions,
namely Customer Orientation, Good Employer, and Prod-
uct and Service Quality, firms should focus more of their


J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2007) 35:127–143

141

efforts on these dimensions when practicing reputation
management. For example,
in regards to the Good
Employer dimension service firms could encourage their
employees to talk to customers about what a good employer
the firm is to work for.

Conclusion

their evaluation will

Much marketing and management research has focused on
measuring corporate reputation We proposed here that
customers evaluate service firms differently than other
stakeholders do and that
influence
their behavior toward a firm. Our study attempted to draw
from corporate-reputation research from different academic
disciplines. By developing and testing a CBR scale in three
service industries as well as relating CBR to relevant
customer outcome variables, we contribute to the theoret-
ical and methodological discourse that is relevant in the
context of reputation measurement. From a managerial
perspective, by linking CBR with relevant outcome var-
iables, our scale offers managers an effective way to
manage the reputation of service firms. Recognition of the
importance of the different dimensions of CBR should
enable service firms to develop more sophisticated posi-
tioning and communication strategies. Although in the
present research, three CBR dimensions were particularly
prominent, all five dimensions played some role in terms of
being associated with the four outcome variables. Thus, our
study provides further evidence of
the importance of
corporate reputation.
