I nformation sharing in supply chains has become an important topic over the past decade. This study uses data from

617 Chinese manufacturing ﬁrms to investigate the relationships among competitive environments, supply chain infor-
mation sharing (SCIS), and supply chain performance. The results of structural equation modeling analysis show that (i)
international competition is positively related to all three types of SCIS whereas local competition is not signiﬁcantly
related to any of the three types, (ii) internal information sharing is positively related to external information sharing with
suppliers and customers, and (iii) internal information sharing and information sharing with customers are positively
related to superior supply chain performance, whereas supplier information sharing is not signiﬁcantly related to perfor-
mance. The ﬁndings enhance our understanding of the relationships among competitive environment, SCIS, and supply
chain performance in Chinese manufacturing settings.

1. Introduction

that

As globalization has led to intensiﬁed competition,
supply chain management has become increasingly
important (Jiang et al. 2007, Kumar et al. 2011, Zhao
et al. 2007, 2008). Information sharing (IS) is an effec-
tive way of dealing with the challenges in a competi-
tive environment
includes both local and
international competition (Chatﬁeld et al. 2004, Lee
et al. 1997, Li 2006, Xu 2011, Zhou and Benton 2007).
We distinguish local competition from international
competition mainly by supply chain partners, includ-
ing suppliers and customers, but not by competitors.
For example, Chinese manufacturers who compete
with local competitors for international customers
face international competition, whereas those who
compete with international competitors for local Chi-
nese customers face local competition.

Previous studies have shown that supply chain

improve their operational performance (Krause et al.
2007, Zdravkovic et al. 2011, Zhou and Benton 2007),
ﬁnancial performance (Carr and Kaynak 2007, Mishra
et al. 2007), and supply chain performance (Byrne
and Heavey 2006, Gavirneni 2006). Furthermore,
recent SCIS studies show that IS is helpful for produc-
tion management (Cavusoglu et al. 2012), product
and process management (Ferguson and Ketzenberg
2006, Lee et al. 2011), risk management (Wakolbinger
and Cruz 2011), logistics management (Olorunniwo
and Li 2010, Prajogo and Olhager 2012), relationship
management (Chin-Chun et al. 2008, Ebrahim-Khanj-
ari et al. 2012), etc. However, most prior studies, espe-
cially analytical studies, focus on sharing one or two
types of information such as inventory, forecast, and
order information, in a two-level supply chain con-
sisting of a buyer and a seller. In this study, SCIS
includes internal IS (ISI) among different internal
functions within a ﬁrm,
information sharing with
suppliers, and IS with customers. Furthermore,

multiple types of
information are often shared
between different supply chain partners in both direc-
tions. For example, a manufacturer may share its fore-
cast and production planning information with its
suppliers, whereas its suppliers may share inventory
and production capacity information with the manu-
facturer. The effects of SCIS on performance are often
the results of sharing multiple types of information in
different parts of supply chains. Thus, it is necessary
to use a more holistic approach to investigate the
effects of SCIS on performance. This study empirically
investigates the relationships among three types of
SCIS and their direct and interactive effects on supply
chain performance in three-level supply chains,
which include manufacturers and their major suppli-
ers and customers.

types of

location and informal

When facing different types of competition, compa-
nies need to develop different SCIS capabilities to
cope with competitive environments. For example,
Chinese manufacturers who focus on local markets
and mainly work with local customers and suppliers
may not need a high level of demand IS with their
suppliers and customers because they all know what
is happening in local markets due to their geographi-
cal
information exchanges.
However, Chinese manufacturers who compete in the
international market may have a much greater need
for demand information sharing with their customers
and suppliers to deal with the demand uncertainty in
the market place. Therefore, it is important to investi-
gate how different dimensions of competition inﬂu-
ence different
IS in supply chains.
Understanding the competitive environment and sup-
ply chain management is of particular interest in
China, as its developing economy plays an increas-
ingly important role in global supply chains. China
has had an annual GDP growth rate of approximately
10% for more than two decades and was the world’s
second largest economy in 2010 (behind the United
States). Most Fortune 500 companies have established
manufacturing bases in China (Jiang et al. 2009) and
China’s manufacturing industries are rapidly evolv-
ing and playing an important role in global business
(Aeppel 2008, Areddy 2008, Li 2000, 2005, Powell
2008). It is crucial that today’s business leaders and
academics understand China’s evolving competitive
environment and its important role in supply chain
management. With this background, we used data
collected from manufacturers in China to investigate
how the competitive environment inﬂuences SCIS
and how SCIS inﬂuences supply chain performance.

Speciﬁcally, this study addresses three research
questions. (i) How is the competitive environment
related to the three types of SCIS (i.e., IS with suppli-
ers, IS with customers, and internal IS)? (ii) How is
internal IS related to IS with suppliers and IS with

customers? (iii) How are these three types of SCIS
simultaneously and interactively related to supply
chain performance? This study contributes to the liter-
ature on competition, supply chain management, and
IS by providing empirical evidence of the relationships
among two dimensions of competitive environment,
three types of SCIS, and supply chain performance. The
ﬁndings also provide managerial insights for practi-
tioners to enhance their understanding of China’s
dynamic competitive environment and to improve
supply chain performance through SCIS.

2. Theoretical Background and

Research Hypotheses

2.1. The Competitive Environment
Ward et al. (1995) characterized the competitive envi-
ronment as the degree of competition faced by a com-
pany. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary,
competition in business is “active demand by two or
more organisms or kinds of organisms for some
environmental resource in short supply” (http://
www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/competition).
In supply chain management, competition is related
to the match between demand and supply in the com-
petitive environment. When there is decreasing
demand or excess supply in the market place, compa-
nies will need to offer lower prices or better quality to
their customers to win their orders. As a result, com-
petition will become increasingly ﬁerce among alter-
native suppliers. Competition is a major driver of
company operations (Amoako-Gyampah 2003, Am-
oako-Gyampah and Boye 2001, Badri et al. 2000,
Ward et al. 1995) and has been emphasized by
researchers in the areas of strategic management and
supply chain and operations management. In the area
of strategic management, Balakrishnan and Werner-
felt (1986) examined the relationships between techni-
cal change, competition, and vertical
integration
based on data collected from 93 industries. Hamel
(1991) proposed that competition pushes ﬁrms to
learn from each other and improve their positions in
the strategic alliance. Dodge et al. (1994) argued that
competition inﬂuences problem perception for small
companies. In the area of supply chain and operations
management, Ward et al.
investigated the
effect of competitive environment on business perfor-
mance for 319 ﬁrms in Singapore. On the basis of the
research of Ward et al. (1995), Amoako-Gyampah and
Boye (2001) and Amoako-Gyampah (2003) examined
the role of competitive environment in strategy selec-
tion in Ghana. Badri et al. (2000) further examined the
effects of environments on performance using data
collected in the United Arab Emirates. More recently,
Ha and Tong (2008) identiﬁed the role of IS as a
source of competitive advantage under supply chain

(1995)

competition. Li et al. (2008) examined the moderating
effect of competition on the relationship between
management ties and the performance of domestic
and foreign companies in China.

Whereas prior studies generally view competition
as a single-dimensional concept, this study separates
local competition from international competition.
China is a huge country with large domestic and for-
eign markets. Some Chinese manufacturing ﬁrms
conduct a signiﬁcant volume of business with interna-
tional customers and suppliers, whereas others
mainly serve the domestic market and therefore deal
primarily with local customers and suppliers. Compa-
nies that compete mainly in the international market
may face different competitive pressures compared to
those who compete mainly in the local market.

2.2. Supply Chain Information Sharing
SCIS refers to IS among internal functions within a
company and IS among supply chain partners in a
supply chain, which include ISC and ISS. According
to the Supply Chain Council’s SCOR model, the
three types of IS are separate but necessary compo-
nents of SCIS. The scope of ISI includes the Plan,
Source, Make, Deliver, Source Return, and Deliver
Return processes of a manufacturer. ISS focuses on
the links among boundary spanning processes includ-
ing the supplier’s Deliver and Deliver Return pro-
cesses and the Source and Source Return processes
of the manufacturer. Similarly, ISC focuses on the
links among the manufacturer’s Deliver and Deliver
Return and the customer’s Source and Source Return
processes. As the three dimensions of SCIS focus on
the different processes of a supply chain, they are
conceptually different and have different effects on
supply chain performance. IS can be achieved by for-
mal means using information systems (e.g., elec-
tronic data interchange (EDI), enterprise resource
planning (ERP)) or by informal means, via meetings,
emails, and phone conversations.

SCIS has become a critical topic in supply chain
management in recent years (Frohlich and Westbrook
2002, Li 2006, Zhou and Benton 2007). For example,
ERP software is a typical
information technology
designed to promote ISI (Niu et al. 2011). Many stud-
ies (e.g., Schlie and Goldhar 1995, Small 1999) have
shown that ISI is critical in enhancing a ﬁrm’s produc-
tion planning. Kim and Narasimhan (2002) investi-
gated the effect of internal information integration on
supply chain performance. Li et al. (2011) found that
information technology can help to ensure process
standards through data accuracy,
IS, and timely
communication. With regard to ISS, Devaraj et al.
(2007) studied the sharing of production schedules,
inventory status, and forecasts with suppliers. Froh-
lich and Westbrook (2002) examined supplier integra-

tion based on the sharing of inventory planning and
demand/forecasting information. Frohlich and West-
brook (2001) assessed the sharing of production plans,
inventory mix/levels, and other types of information,
while Gavirneni et al. (1999) studied the effects of
sharing information concerning inventory levels and
inventory ordering policies. Zhao and Xie (2002) and
Zhao et al.
investigated the inﬂuence of
demand and order IS on supply chain performance.
ISC includes the sharing of demand information,
point of sale information, forecast information, and
related information (Aviv 2001, Cachon and Lariviere
2001). Frohlich and Westbrook (2001, 2002) empirically
tested the construct of ISC and suggested that sharing
information (e.g., demand forecasts) with customers is
an important aspect of supply chain management.

(2002a)

2.3. The Effect of the Competitive Environment
on SCIS
The competitive environment has been cited as one of
the key factors that drive the need for SCIS (Dasgupta
et al. 1999, Jain et al. 2011, Zhou and Benton 2007).
Competition requires ﬁrms to offer shorter lead times,
faster responses to customer demands, a greater
degree of customization, and lower costs in uncertain
and volatile environments (Cao and Dowlatshahi
2005, Chiang and Feng 2007, Li et al. 2006). To achieve
performance improvements in these multiple dimen-
sions, ﬁrms must be able to adopt, integrate, and
reconﬁgure internal and external processes to match
the requirements of the rapidly changing environ-
ment (Teece et al. 1997). SCIS can help to update
information and understand business needs. Effective
SCIS can also help companies to acquire and absorb
external knowledge to redesign products/services
quickly and effectively and reconﬁgure and transform
structures and processes to meet customers’ require-
ments in rapidly changing environments. Therefore,
companies need to enhance SCIS in response to
increased competition. Chwelos et al. (2001) and Teo
et al. (2003) found competitive pressure to be a signif-
icant predictor of the intent to adopt EDI. Kumar and
van Dissel (1996) proposed that environmental forces
(e.g., globalization) inﬂuence the collaborative strat-
egy of ﬁrms and their adoption of inter-organizational
information systems.

Different types of SCIS may be necessary to meet
the requirements of different competitive environ-
ments. Companies may choose to emphasize internal,
customer, or supplier IS to meet the requirements of
different competitive environments. Furthermore,
companies that face largely international competition
and deal with foreign customers or suppliers may act
differently than those that engage mainly in local
competition and deal with domestic customers or
suppliers. Many foreign partners of Chinese ﬁrms are

more advanced in using information technology
systems (ITS) as a tool to coordinate their processes.
They tend to rely on technologies and systems to
integrate supply chains to a greater extent than their
Chinese partners and place pressure on their partners
to adopt advanced ITS. As a result, Chinese compa-
nies facing international competition are more likely
than their counterparts engaged in local competition
to adopt formal IS systems and to standardize their
information communication protocols to enhance IS
with their customers and suppliers. Standardizing the
way in which information is communicated is impor-
tant when supply chain partners speak different lan-
guages and operate in different cultures, time zones,
legal environments, and so forth. In addition, by
reducing lead times, cutting costs, and improving
response times, SCIS plays a more important role in
the international business context than in the local
business context. In changing environments, compa-
nies can quickly understand customers’ changing
requirements with the help of ISC. With the help of
ISI and ISS, companies can work with internal func-
tions and suppliers to better satisfy customers. It is
very important for companies competing in the inter-
national market to develop, maintain, reconﬁgure,
and transform operational routines with their global
supply chain partners.

Similarly, SCIS can also help companies to inte-
grate,
learn, reconﬁgure, and transform processes
and activities to cope with competition in local mar-
kets. However, the effect of local competition on
SCIS in China is quite different from that of interna-
tional competition. In China, manufacturers, their
suppliers, and customers are often clustered in a
region due to the unique development policies
adopted by cities, townships, and technological and
economic development areas. The geographical dis-
tances between the manufacturer and its supply
chain partners are relatively small. Furthermore,
manufacturers operating in local markets are rela-
tively weaker in the adoption of information sys-
tems compared with their peers operating in the
international market. They are more likely to use
informal IS methods (e.g., face-to-face interviews,
telephone calls, and business lunches) to deal with
the challenges within the local competitive environ-
ment. In addition, companies are more likely to use
an established guanxi
(Lovett et al.
1999, Xin and Pearce 1996)
to deal with the
competition in the local Chinese markets. Although
companies facing local competition still require SCIS
to improve
the
strength of the effect of local competition on SCIS to
be different from that of international competition.
Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses

2.4. Relationships Between SCIS Variables
From a cooperation perspective, Hillebrand and Bie-
mans (2003) proposed that internal cooperation could
function as a prerequisite coordination mechanism
for external cooperation. From the perspective of
stages theory, internal integration is a prerequisite for
external integration (e.g., King and Teo 1997, Morash
and Clinton 1998, Zhao et al. 2011). Ward and Zhou
(2006) found that within-ﬁrm information technology
(IT) integration and between-ﬁrm IT integration are
positively correlated. In a recent study, Carr and Kay-
nak (2007) investigated the inﬂuence of ISI on ISS and
found that the former improves the latter. However,
they did not investigate ISC.

When a company has a high level of internal IS, it
will be more capable of achieving a high level of
external IS. In particular, when a company has a high
level of ISI, the company will be more likely to learn
from external partners
and understand their
businesses to facilitate external IS. As a result, ISI repre-
sents a capability for learning from external partners
(e.g., Hillebrand and Biemans 2004, Lane et al. 2006,
Zhao et al. 2011). As the supply chain is part of an
overall product offering, ﬁrms across the chain must
act in a concerted effort to maximize its value. In a


556

Production and Operations Management 23(4), pp. 552–569, © 2013 Production and Operations Management Society

way, external IS is an extension of ISI across ﬁrms’
boundaries. This argument rests on the fact
that
external uncertainties and links with customers and
suppliers must be internally integrated into the
appropriate areas of a ﬁrm. This internal relationship
enables ﬁrms to engage in external relationships more
successfully. In other words, without ISI, it would be
extremely difﬁcult for a ﬁrm to achieve external IS.
Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:

H3a: ISI is positively related to ISS.

H3b: ISI is positively related to ISC.

2.5. The Effect of SCIS on Supply Chain
Performance
The majority of previous studies on IS have investi-
gated the effect of one or two types of SCIS on the
ﬁnancial or operational performance of ﬁrms within a
supply chain, with a particular focus on cost and
inventory performance. Only a few studies have
investigated the effect of SCIS on supply chain perfor-
mance (e.g., Byrne and Heavey 2006, Gavirneni 2006,
Yee 2005, Zhao et al. 2002b). Supply chain perfor-
mance refers to the operational performance of the
whole supply chain, including the focal company and
its major supplier chain partners. Conceptually, sup-
ply chain performance measures the overall perfor-
mance of all supply chain members and the links
between them.

SCIS contributes to the improvement of supply
chain performance by reducing both risk and uncer-
tainty in the supply chain process and a better
understanding of supply chain partners’ business
needs and requirements. Both theoretical and empir-
ical studies have shown that IS enhances supply
chain performance (e.g., Cachon and Fisher 2000,
Frohlich and Westbrook 2002, Lee et al. 2000, Schlie
and Goldhar 1995, Zhao and Xie 2002, Zhao et al.
2002a, 2002b). ISC enables manufacturers to react
more quickly to customers’ changing needs, and
helps them to offer more customized products and
services more reliably and at a lower cost. ISS can
also help to reduce lead times and inventory costs
and enables more customized products to be offered
at

improve quality and delivery reliability. ISI can help
to lower costs, shorten lead times, and improve
quality and customer service levels in a dynamic
competitive environment.

reasonable prices.

It

Regarding the effect of ISS, Frohlich and West-
brook (2002) used data collected from 890 UK ﬁrms,
and showed that supplier integration has a positive
inﬂuence on operational performance. Using data
from 120 US manufacturing ﬁrms, Devaraj et al.
(2007) also found that supplier integration has a

positive effect on operational performance. However,
they did not study the effect of supplier integration
while taking into account the effect of ISI. ISS also
enables
joint product design and development
between the manufacturer and suppliers and thus
enhances the innovation performance of supply
chain members (Li and Gao 2008). Therefore, we
propose the following hypothesis:

H4a: ISS is positively related to supply chain
performance.

Regarding ISI, Attaran (1989) found that intra-ﬁrm
information systems enable ﬁrms to reduce their lead
times. Using data from 306 US ﬁrms, Stank et al.
(2001) showed that internal integration has a signiﬁ-
cant positive inﬂuence on overall
logistics perfor-
mance, and Germain and Iyer (2006) also provided
empirical evidence that internal integration positively
inﬂuences such performance. With effective IS among
functions, different functions can work together to
coordinate processes to fulﬁll the changing require-
ments of customers. Therefore, we propose the fol-
lowing hypothesis:

H4b: ISI is positively related to supply chain
performance.

With respect

logistics performance.

to ISC, Frohlich and Westbrook
(2002) found that demand integration has a positive
inﬂuence on operational performance. Both Stank
et al. (2001) and Germain and Iyer (2006) showed
that customer integration has a positive inﬂuence on
overall
In addition to the
above empirical studies, modeling and simulation
studies also suggest that ISC has a positive inﬂu-
ence on supply chain performance. For example,
using a computer simulation method, Zhao and Xie
(2002) and Zhao et al.
(2002a, 2002b) found that
retailers’ provision of demand and planned order
information to manufacturers can help to improve
supply chain performance. Cachon and Fisher
(2000) used a mathematical modeling method to
demonstrate that
sharing demand and
inventory data with suppliers can shorten order
processing lead times. Lee et al. (2000) analytically
showed that retailers’ provision of demand informa-
tion to manufacturers leads to signiﬁcant inventory
reductions, which is generally associated with short
lead times. Because supply chain management is
customer-oriented, ISC is critical to manufacturers’
understanding of customer requirements to enhance
supply chain performance. Therefore, we propose
the following hypothesis:

retailers

H4c: ISC is positively related to supply chain
performance.

Although different types of SCIS have been shown
to enhance supply chain performance, to the best of
our knowledge no study has examined the simultaneous
effects of ISI, ISS, and ISC on supply chain perfor-
mance. Furthermore, little remains known about the
relative effectiveness of these three types of IS and
how they interact with one another to inﬂuence sup-
ply chain performance.

A manufacturer’s efforts in external ISS and ISC
can help it to take full advantage of its ISI to achieve a
better supply chain performance. Similarly, ISI can
enhance the effect of external IS on supply chain per-
formance. Upstream ISS and downstream ISC can
work together to improve supply chain performance.
However, few IS studies have examined the inter-
active effects of the different dimensions of SCIS on
supply chain performance. Regarding supply chain
integration, Germain and Iyer (2006) found that the
interaction between internal and customer integration
is related to logistics performance, which in turn leads
to ﬁnancial performance. Droge et al. (2004) found
that internal integration moderates the effect of exter-
nal integration on performance. Devaraj et al. (2007)
found that customer integration moderates the rela-
tionship between supplier integration and perfor-
mance. Flynn et al.
the
interaction between supplier and customer integra-
tion has a positive effect on operational performance.
Therefore, we hypothesize that two-way and three-
way interactions among the three dimensions of SCIS
inﬂuence supply chain performance:

conﬁrmed that

(2010)

H5a: The interaction between ISS and ISI is posi-
tively related to supply chain performance.

H5b: The interaction between ISC and ISI is pos-
itively related to supply chain performance.

H5c: The interaction between ISS and ISC is pos-
itively related to supply chain performance.

H5d: The interaction among ISS, ISI, and ISC is
positively related to supply chain performance.

2.6. Control Variables
The control variables in this study include company
size, industry, region, and ownership. First, larger
companies may have more resources for supply chain
activities. As a result, they may achieve a higher level
of SCIS and performance in comparison to small com-
panies. In this study, the mean of the latent variable,
which comprises the number of employees, ﬁxed
assets, and sales, is used to measure the control vari-

able Size. Second, companies in different industries
may face different levels of competition and have dif-
ferent levels of SCIS and performance (Devaraj et al.
2007). In this study, the dummy variable Industry1
refers to metal, mechanical, and engineering; Indus-
try2 refers to electronics and electrical; and Industry3
refers to textile and apparel. The base group is other
industries. Third, companies in different regions that
are in different stages of economic development and
companies with different types of ownership and
managerial governances may be in different competi-
tive environments and have different levels of SCIS
and performance. The dummy variable Region1
refers to Guangzhou, Region2 refers to Chongqing,
Region3 refers to Shanghai, and Region4 refers to
Tianjin. Hong Kong is the base group. For the owner-
ship dummy variables, Ownership1 refers to SOE
(state-owned enterprises), Ownership2 refers to COE
(collectively owned enterprises), Ownership3 refers
to POE (privately owned enterprises), and Owner-
ship4 refers to JV (joint ventures). The base group is
FOE (foreign-owned enterprise).

3. Research Methodology

3.1. Data Collection
As China is a large country, we strategically selected
ﬁve cities that represent different economic levels and
are geographically diverse: Chongqing, Tianjin,
Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Chongqing, a
traditional
industrial city in northwestern inland
China, represents a relatively early stage of economic
development. Tianjin, an industrial city in northern
China, is a major city in the Bohai Sea economic devel-
opment area. Guangzhou and Shanghai are located in
the afﬂuent Pearl River Delta (in southern China) and
in the Yangtze River Delta (in eastern China), respec-
tively, and both enjoy a higher degree of economic
development. Hong Kong is one of the most open
economies in the world, and its manufacturers oper-
ate in an environment that is very different from those
prevailing in other Chinese cities. Although they
maintain their headquarters in Hong Kong,
their
manufacturing facilities are located in mainland
China. These ﬁve cities are representative of the vari-
ous regions of China.

To obtain a representative sample of enterprises,
we randomly selected ﬁrms from the China Telecom
yellow pages for the four cities located in mainland
China and from the Chinese Manufacturers Associa-
tion Directory for Hong Kong. The selected ﬁrms rep-
resent a wide range of industries, including chemicals
and petrochemicals, building materials, rubber and
plastics, metals, mechanical and engineering, elec-
tronics and electrical, and textiles and apparel, among
others. The ﬁrms were ﬁrst contacted by telephone to

obtain the contact details of key informants and their
consent to participate in the survey. The key infor-
mants typically held positions such as supply chain
manager, CEO/president, vice president, or director
in charge of marketing and purchasing, and were
knowledgeable about
the company’s internal and
external processes. Self-addressed and stamped enve-
lopes were also provided to facilitate the return of
completed questionnaires. We indicated that if the
respondent felt that he/she was not the best person to
answer certain questions, he/she could ask a more
appropriate person to answer those questions. Both
follow-up phone calls and letters were used to clarify
any difﬁcult questions and to improve the response
rate.

Of the 4569 companies contacted, 1356 agreed to
participate. After several follow-ups, we received 617
valid questionnaires. Among them, approximately
200 were from Hong Kong and approximately 100
from each city in mainland China. Based on the num-
ber of companies initially contacted (number of ques-
tionnaires distributed), the response rate was 13.5%
(45.5%). The response rate for this study is comparable
to or better than other survey-based studies in opera-
tions management (e.g., 7.4% in Nahm et al. 2003) and
supply chain management (e.g., 6.3% in Li et al. 2005).

3.2. Questionnaire Design
To develop reliable and valid measurements, we ﬁrst
undertook a comprehensive review of the literature to
identify existing measures for related constructs.
Wherever possible, we adopted or adapted measure-
ment items that have been validated in previous stud-
ies.
If no existing measures were available, we
developed new items based on our understanding of
the relevant construct, observations made during
company visits, and interviews with practitioners. In
the pilot stage, the managers we interviewed con-
ﬁrmed that they understood the survey questions and
were able to answer them.

The measurement items for the two competitive
environment variables were adapted from those of
Ward et al. (1995), Amoako-Gyampah (2003), Am-
oako-Gyampah and Boye (2001), Huo et al. (2008),
and Wang et al. (2010). For example, the competition
items in Ward et al. (1995), Amoako-Gyampah (2003),
and Amoako-Gyampah and Boye (2001) measured
demand, supply, and competition in local and
international markets. Huo et al. (2008) and Wang
et al. (2010) used local and international competition
to operationalize the concept of competition with the
data from Hong Kong and mainland China, respec-
tively.

SCIS can be measured by either the information
shared or the information systems used for IS, or both.
The measures for ISI were adapted from those of

Narasimhan and Kim (2002) and Braunscheidel and
Suresh (2009). In this study, ISI includes both data
and application integration among internal functions
and covers inventory and logistics IS.

Although the degree of integration among different
functions within a company is easily observable and
relatively objective, the inter-organizational integra-
tion of data and systems is not easily observable, and
integration between different companies does not
depend only on information system capabilities but
also on the relationships among supply chain partners
and the presence of trust and relationship commit-
ment (Zhao et al. 2008, 2011).

The measures for ISS were adapted from those of
Frohlich and Westbrook (2001), Devaraj et al. (2007),
Frohlich and Westbrook (2002), Gavirneni et al.
(1999), Zhao and Xie (2002), and Zhao et al. (2002a).
In this study, ISS includes the sharing of production
schedule/capacity, inventory, and forecasting infor-
mation between a manufacturer and its major sup-
plier. The measures for ISC were adapted from those
of Aviv (2001), Cachon and Lariviere (2001), and
Frohlich and Westbrook (2001, 2002). In this study,
ISC includes the sharing of market information, point
of sale information, demand forecasts, and inventory
information between manufacturers and their major
customers.

The measures for supply chain performance were
adapted from those of Stank et al. (2001), Beamon
(1999), Devaraj et al. (2007), Neely et al. (1995), Stank
et al. (2001), and Vickery et al. (2003). Prior studies
have used a broad range of measures, including cus-
tomer service, ﬂexibility, delivery, lead time, and efﬁ-
ciency. In this study, we measured supply chain
performance with responsiveness to customer needs,
speed of the supply chain process, delivery perfor-
mance, and customer service level.

Each measurement item was rated on a 7-point
Likert scale. For some complicated items, explanations
were provided to facilitate data collection. The survey
questions used for this study and the related descrip-
tive statistics are shown in Table 1. The English
version of the questionnaire was developed and then
translated into Chinese by an operations management
professor in China. The Chinese version was then
translated back into English by another operations
management professor. This translated English ver-
sion was then checked against the original English
version for accuracy. The Chinese version was used
in the mainland Chinese cities and a bilingual version
was used in Hong Kong. Before pre-testing the
questionnaire, the instrument was carefully examined
by academics and supply chain executives. At the
pre-test stage, the questionnaire was sent to a sample
of 15 companies. We visited these companies and con-
ducted face-to-face discussions with executives after

their feedback, we revised the questionnaire to make
it more understandable and relevant to Chinese busi-
ness practices.

Because a single

from each ﬁrm
answered all of the survey questions, we checked for
potential common method bias. An appropriate
arrangement of the order of questionnaire items can
reduce respondents’ consistent motives to a certain
extent and therefore decrease the common method
bias in self-reporting (Podsakoff and Organ 1986,
Podsakoff et al. 2003). In the questionnaire design

stage, we adopted different instructions for different
scales, and the adjacent variables in the conceptual
model were put in distinct sections. The items com-
prising the scales used for competitive environment,
SCIS, and supply chain performance were not highly
similar in terms of their content, and the respondents
were also familiar with them. Harman’s one-factor
test (Hochwarter et al. 2004, Podsakoff and Organ
1986, Podsakoff et al. 2003) revealed several distinct
factors for the variables, suggesting that common
method bias was not an issue. To further assess com-
mon method bias, conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA)

with a single factor was performed (Sanchez and
Brock 1996). The model’s ﬁt
indices (chi-square
(v2) = 6494.72, with degrees of freedom (df) = 405,
non-normed ﬁt index (NNFI) = 0.71, comparative ﬁt
index (CFI) = 0.73, root mean square error of approxi-
mation (RMSEA) = 0.19, and standardized root mean
square residual (SRMR) = 0.15) were unacceptable
and signiﬁcantly worse than those of the measure-
ment CFA model. This suggests that a single factor is
not appropriate; hence, the level of common method
bias is low. As a third test of common method bias,
two measurement models, one that included only the
traits and one that included the traits and a method
factor, were tested and compared (Paulraj et al. 2008,
Podsakoff et al. 2003, Widaman 1985, Williams et al.
1989). The results of the method factor model only
marginally improved the model ﬁt
(RMSEA by
 0.006, NNFI by 0.00, CFI by 0.00, SRMR by  0.008),
with the common method factor accounting for a very
small variance (Paulraj et al. 2008). In summary, we
can conclude that common method bias is not an
issue in this study.

4. Analysis Results

4.1. Respondent Proﬁle
The respondents held executive positions such as
CEO/president, supply chain manager, vice presi-
dent, and director. Among them, 83.2% had been in
their position for 3 years or more. Thus, the respon-
dents were familiar with their ﬁrms and had sufﬁcient
knowledge to complete the survey. The respondent
ﬁrms covered a wide range of industries (Table 2).
The highest percentage (25.5%) of companies were
reported in the metals, mechanical, and engineering
industries, followed by textiles and apparel industries
(17.9%). Regarding ﬁrm size, the median number of
employees was approximately 100 (Table 3). Although
median annual sales were between HK$10 million
and HK$20 million, ﬁrms with sales of less than
HK$5 million accounted for 32% of all reporting
ﬁrms, and 25% of ﬁrms had annual sales of more than
HK$50 million. Approximately one third of the com-
panies were small, with less than 50 employees, one
third were medium-sized companies with 50–200
employees, and one third were large-sized companies
with more than 200 employees. Such a sample repre-
sents a wide range of companies in China.

To test for non-response bias, we compared physi-
cal assets, annual sales, number of employees, and all
variables used in this study between early and late
responses (Handﬁeld and Bechtel 2002, Lessler and
Kalsbeek 1992, Stank et al. 2001). No statistical differ-
ences were found between them at the signiﬁcance
level of 0.05, suggesting that non-response bias was
not a major concern.

4.2. Measurement Development

4.2.1. Unidimensionality and Reliability. A rig-
orous process was used to develop and validate the
survey instrument. We followed a two-step method
to test for construct reliability (Narasimhan and Jaya-
ram 1998). In the ﬁrst step, exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) was performed to ensure the unidimensionality
of the scale items. In the second step, Cronbach’s
alpha and composite reliability were calculated to
assess the reliability of each construct.

For EFA, we used principal component analysis to
determine the main constructs and their related mea-
surement items and Varimax rotation with Kaiser
normalization to clarify the factors (Loehlin 1998)
(Table 4). This resulted in six eigenvalues that were
larger than 1. The scree test also suggested that using
six factors was appropriate. The total variance
explained by these six factors was 69.7%. If an item
loaded on more than one factor and the difference
between factor loadings was less than 0.10 across the
factors, then it was considered to have cross-loadings
(Jambulingam et al. 2005, Kathuria 2000) and was
deleted. CFA was used to further validate the factor
structure. The model ﬁt indices indicated that the
model was acceptable. Therefore, unidimensionality
was ensured.

Cronbach’s alpha is a widely accepted measure of
reliability. The recommended criterion is 0.70 (Hair
et al. 1998). Table 5 shows that all six Cronbach’s


Huo, Zhao, and Zhou: Competitive Environment and Information Sharing
Production and Operations Management 23(4), pp. 552–569, © 2013 Production and Operations Management Society

561

alpha values were above 0.75. In addition, we con-
ducted the corrected item-total correlation (CITC)
reliability test (Kerlinger 1986) and a composite reli-
ability test. Table 5 shows that all CITC values were
larger than 0.50, which was greater than the mini-
mum acceptable value of 0.30, and all composite
reliability values are higher than 0.76, which is
greater than the minimum acceptable value of 0.70.
Therefore, we concluded that the scales were reli-
able.

4.2.2. Validity. Validity determines whether a
scale measures what it is supposed to measure. In this

study, we examined content, convergent, and discri-
minant validity (Bollen 1989). Content validity was
established through our extensive literature review,
feedback received from executives and academics,
and the pilot test.

CFA was used to test convergent and discriminant
validity (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka 1998). In the
convergent validity test, each item was linked to its
corresponding construct, and the covariance among
the constructs was freely estimated. The model ﬁt
(v2 = 1570.53, df = 384, RMSEA = 0.074,
indices
NNFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.053)
indicated
that the model was acceptable (Hu and Bentler 1999).

In addition, all factor loadings had t-values greater
than 2.0, and all factor loadings except one (0.45) were
higher than 0.50, which conﬁrmed the convergent
validity of the scale (Chau 1997). For discriminant
validity testing, we built a constrained CFA model for
each possible pair of latent constructs, in which the
correlation between the paired constructs was ﬁxed to
1.0 (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka 1998). The results
were compared with those of the original uncon-
strained model, in which the correlations were freely
estimated. A signiﬁcant difference in the chi-square
statistics between the ﬁxed and unconstrained models
indicates high discriminant validity (Bagozzi et al.
1991, Chen and Paulraj 2004). In this study, all 21
chi-square differences were found to be signiﬁcant at
the 0.01 level. Therefore, discriminant validity was
achieved.

4.3. Results
We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to esti-
mate the relationships between the constructs, the
results of which are shown in Figure 2. SEM estimates
were generated using LISREL 8.54 with the maximum
likelihood estimation method based on data standard-
ized. As shown in Table 6, the ﬁt indices for our
model were v2 = 1782.90, df = 390, RMSEA = 0.079,
NNFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94, and SRMR = 0.093, suggest-
ing that the model is acceptable. Based on the power
calculation used in MacCullum et al.
the
power of this model was close to 1.00. On the basis of
the results of the structural equation model, we tested

the 11 hypotheses shown in Figure 1. The results are
summarized in Table 7.

To further investigate the interactive effect of ISS on
supply chain performance (Hypotheses 5a–d), we
performed a regression analysis similar to that carried
out in Devaraj et al. (2007) based on the standardized
data using two-tailed tests. The results are shown in
Table 8. In all six models, the dependent variable is
supply chain performance. Although ISS has a signiﬁ-
cant effect on supply chain performance in Model 4,
its effect becomes non-signiﬁcant in Model 5, which
includes ISC. This suggests that ISS has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on supply chain performance when only ISI
and ISS are considered, but is not signiﬁcant when all
three IS variables are considered simultaneously. This
is consistent with the ﬁndings from the structural
equation model. Model 6 includes three two-way
interaction terms and one three-way interaction term.
The p-value of the change in the F-statistic of this
model is 0.205, which suggests that the interaction
effect is non-signiﬁcant. Therefore, hypotheses 5a, 5b,
5c, and 5d are not supported. We also tested the effect
of local and international competition and their inter-
action on SCIS using regression analyses (Table 9);
the main effects are similar to those of the SEM model
and the interactive effect is non-signiﬁcant.

4.4. Robustness Tests
We believe that our ﬁndings are robust because we
used multiple methods to alleviate concerns about
non-response bias, common method bias, and mea-
surement errors. We further used several methods to
test the robustness of our model. First, we randomly
selected 50% of the samples and conducted SEM on
them, and the results were essentially the same. Sec-
ond, we also conducted regression analyses using
supply chain performance as the dependent variable,
and the results (shown in Table 8) support the main

conclusions from the structural equation model.
When we included local and international competi-
tion and their interaction into this regression analyses,
the main results concerning the effects of SCIS on per-
formance remained the same. Third, we also per-
formed regression analyses using ISI, ISS, and ISC as
dependent variables and local and international com-
petition and their interaction as the independent vari-
ables. The results (shown in Table 9) also support the
main conclusions from the SEM analyses. Therefore,
we conclude that our models are robust.

5. Discussion and Managerial

Implications

5.1. The Effect of the Competitive Environment on
SCIS
Figure 2 and Table 7 show that international competi-
tion is positively related to all three types of SCIS, but

that local competition is not signiﬁcantly related to
any type of SCIS. There are several possible explana-
tions for this. First, most of the customers and suppli-
ers of Chinese ﬁrms that deal primarily with local
competition are likely to be local. Many Chinese com-
panies do not have advanced information systems
and process management skills (Pyke et al. 2000,
2002). Therefore, they do not have high levels of for-
mal IS via IT systems and they might have alternative
ways of communicating with local suppliers and cus-
tomers. For example, they can visit their suppliers
and customers in person. As guanxi is a very impor-
tant element in Chinese business relationships (Li
et al. 2008), IS is often carried out on a personal rela-
tionship basis rather than through formal systems
and processes. As our measures mainly capture for-
mal IS as opposed to informal personal IS, we did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between local competi-
tion and SCIS. Many Western customers and suppli-
ers place a greater emphasis on information systems

and formal IS mechanisms. They tend to have more
advanced information systems and often put pressure
on Chinese manufacturers to develop their own IS
and participate in formal IS with them. They also tend
to rely less on informal IS. As a result, Chinese manu-
facturers feel compelled to invest more in their IS to
ensure that they can cooperate with their supply
chain partners in the international market. Therefore,
international competition often forces Chinese ﬁrms
to enhance their IS. These ﬁndings are similar in part
to those of Li et al. (2008), who found that manage-
ment ties had a positive effect on performance for
Chinese domestic ﬁrms, whereas the effect repre-
sented an inverted U-shape for foreign ﬁrms, indicat-
ing that Chinese domestic ﬁrms are more likely to use
guanxi than foreign ﬁrms.

Second, IS becomes more important when supply
chain partners are geographically isolated from one
another. Timely IS can help ﬁrms to understand the
market better, which enables them to introduce new
products into the market in a timely fashion. It also
helps ﬁrms to reduce lead times, provide better cus-
tomer service, and achieve good delivery perfor-
mance. Therefore, ﬁrms that primarily deal with
international rather than local competition are more
likely to develop IS.

Third, the level of uncertainty in the international
market is higher than that in local markets. Because

the transaction costs incurred by ﬁrms conducting
business in the international market are higher than
those incurred by ﬁrms engaged in local markets,
there is a need for the former to undertake more IS
with supply chain partners to help reduce transaction
costs.

Finally, because of the many differences among
countries (e.g., different time zones and languages),
the need for a common IS platform is critical. For
example, it might be necessary for an Asian company
to communicate with an American company using an
information system, as there is a time difference of
roughly 12 hours between Asia and North America.

These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant

implications for
practitioners. Executives need to know when IS is
needed and what types of IS may be useful. Before
ﬁrms decide on their SCIS strategies, they should
consider their competitive environments. For exam-
ple, ﬁrms that face mainly local competition may not
need to participate in formal SCIS to the same extent
as those that face mainly international competition,
who in turn could be required to participate in all
three types of SCIS. For companies in China that are
more engaged in international competition, technolo-
than guanxi. Also these
gies are more important
ﬁrms usually pay greater attention to such advances
(e.g., information systems) to formally share infor-
mation with supply chain partners. In contrast, com-
panies that are mainly engaged in local competition
pay greater attention to guanxi than technologies to
informally share information with supply chain part-
ners, especially when taking into account China’s
special collectivist culture. Companies facing both
international and local competition need to work
hard to improve both technologies and guanxi and
share information by both formal and informal
means. Multinational ﬁrms conducting business in
China need to understand the diversities in cultures
and operating environments and be ﬂexible in their
application of IS.

5.2. The Relationships among the Three Types of
SCIS
The results presented in Figure 2 and Table 7 show
that ISI is positively related to IS with both suppliers
and customers. This suggests that ﬁrms’
internal
information sharing across the different functions
within the ﬁrm is helpful for effective IS with custom-
ers and suppliers. A quick and reliable internal infor-
mation ﬂow can help a ﬁrm to extend the ﬂow of
internal information to its supply chain partners.

Our ﬁndings also provide signiﬁcant managerial
implications for practitioners. As ISI is important for
enhancing external IS, a ﬁrm must develop IS through
investment in information systems that facilitate ISI,
while it develops its IS capability with its suppliers


Huo, Zhao, and Zhou: Competitive Environment and Information Sharing
Production and Operations Management 23(4), pp. 552–569, © 2013 Production and Operations Management Society

565

and customers. This is also consistent with Chinese
guanxi culture. An internal IS guanxi among functions
can help companies to coordinate external IS guanxi
among supply chain partners.

5.3. The Inﬂuence of SCIS on Supply Chain
Performance
Figure 2 shows that ISI and ISC have a signiﬁcant
positive inﬂuence on supply chain performance,
whereas ISS does not. These ﬁndings indicate that it is
important to integrate information both internally
and with customers to improve supply chain perfor-
mance, and these results support the ﬁndings of pre-
vious studies including Stank et al. (2001), Frohlich
and Westbrook (2002), and Germain and Iyer (2006).
Consistent with Stank et al. (2001) and Germain and
Iyer (2006), this study also shows that the effect of ISI
on supply chain performance is greater than that of
ISC, which indicates that ISI is the most important
driver of supply chain performance.

Our ﬁnding that ISS does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
supply chain performance is somewhat surprising
and contradicts the ﬁndings of previous studies,
including Frohlich and Westbrook (2002) and Devaraj
et al. (2007), which show that upstream supply chain
integration has a positive inﬂuence on performance.
However, Devaraj et al. (2007) also reported interac-
tion effects between supplier and customer integra-
tion similar to ours.

The difference between our ﬁndings and those of
previous studies could also be due to several other
factors. First, Frohlich and Westbrook (2002) and Dev-
araj et al. (2007) considered only supplier integration
and customer integration, not internal
integration.
This study, however, simultaneously considers ISS,
ISC, and ISI. The signiﬁcant effect of ISI on perfor-
mance might inﬂuence the effect of ISS on perfor-
mance.
supplier
integration by both Frohlich and Westbrook (2002)
and Devaraj et al. (2007) included IS and other forms
of cooperation, which may greatly enhance perfor-
mance. Third, both Frohlich and Westbrook (2002)
and Devaraj et al. (2007) considered the operational
performance of the focal ﬁrm rather than supply
chain performance per se, whereas this study mea-
sures supply chain performance.

Our ﬁndings have signiﬁcant managerial implica-
tions. When executives are constrained by resources
and have to set priorities for their IS efforts, they
should invest in ISI and ISC because of their signiﬁ-
cant direct effects on supply chain performance. ISS
should be accorded the lowest priority, as it does
not have a direct effect on supply chain perfor-
mance.

In emerging economies such as China, supply chain
management is more difﬁcult than in developed econ-

omies. In the latter, companies have developed inter-
nal operation management capabilities that can be
extended to the management of supply chain part-
ners. However, in the former, focal ﬁrms are simulta-
neously developing internal operations capabilities
and external management capabilities related to their
supply chain partners. This can be difﬁcult for those
companies that have a low level of internal operations
management.

6. Conclusions and Limitations

This study investigates the relationships among
two dimensions of
the competitive environment,
three types of SCIS, and supply chain performance
using data collected from 617 manufacturing ﬁrms
in China, and makes signiﬁcant contributions to
both theory and practice. The major contributions
are as follows.

First, this is the ﬁrst study to investigate the com-
petitive environment and SCIS using a large data set
from China. We found that international competition
is positively related to internal, customer, and sup-
plier IS, whereas local competition is not related to
any of the three types of SCIS. This study also
enriches the literature on the relationship between
competitive environment and supply chain manage-
ment by showing the different effects of local and
international competition on SCIS in China. China is
now playing an increasingly important role in the glo-
bal economy, and as such it is important for both aca-
demicians and practitioners
to understand the
dynamics of the Chinese competitive environment.
Zhao et al. (2006, 2007) pointed out that high-quality
research regarding China will become more critical as
China becomes a more signiﬁcant player in the global
economy. This study provides timely insights into
supply chain management in the Chinese competitive
environment.

Second, the study also enhances the literature on
the effects of SCIS on performance by examining the
simultaneous effects of internal, customer, and sup-
plier IS. Whereas most previous SCIS studies use a
modeling or simulation research method to examine
only one or two types of information shared in one
direction along a two-level supply chain, this study
investigates the effects of three different types of bilat-
eral IS along three-level supply chains. Our ﬁndings
concerning the effects of ISS are signiﬁcantly different
from those of previous studies. The ﬁndings from this
study deepen our understanding of how the three
types of SCIS inﬂuence supply chain performance.
The empirical research method used in this study also
supplements the extant modeling and simulation
procedures used in the SCIS ﬁeld (Fisher 2007, Roth
2007).

Finally, this study contributes to SCIS practices.
Executives can use the ﬁndings to select the most
effective approach of SCIS in different competitive
environments. They can also see how different types
of SCIS inﬂuence supply chain performance.

Although this study makes both theoretical and
practical contributions, it also has a number of limita-
tions and thus we suggest avenues for further
research. First, as we limited our investigation to the
effects of two dimensions of the competitive environ-
ment on SCIS, the ambit of future studies could be
widened to include alternative dimensions. In addi-
tion to competitive environment variables, factors
such as inter-organizational relationships may also
inﬂuence SCIS. Future research could focus on identi-
fying other enablers of SCIS and examine their effects.
Second, although it is important to understand the
relationships among the competitive environment,
SCIS, and supply chain performance in China,
whether the ﬁndings from this study can be general-
ized to other countries is questionable, as the data
were from a single country. Future research could test
and validate the model in other countries to assess its
generalizability. Cross-cultural investigations of infor-
mation sharing mechanisms (such as formal informa-
tion systems vs. informal human interactions) and
how they inﬂuence supply chain performance in dif-
ferent competitive environments might reveal inter-
esting differences in IS behavior and their effect on
supply chain performance. Third, cross-sectional data
were collected from only one respondent
in this
study. Future studies could investigate the causal
relationships among the competitive environment,
SCIS, and supply chain performance using longitudi-
nal data from multiple respondents. Fourth, the rela-
tionship among competitive environments, SCIS, and
performance is complex and may be non-linear.
Future research could explore alternative models to
determine the relationships among environment,
SCIS, and performance.
