Within the context of supply chain integration this study illuminates the role of customer satisfaction
and associated performance impacts through the lens of organizational learning theory. This study
investigates the relationships among internal integration, external integration (i.e. with customers and
suppliers), customer satisfaction, and ﬁnancial performance using survey data collected from 214
manufacturing ﬁrms in China. The results suggest that internal integration signiﬁcantly inﬂuences both
dimensions of external integration, customer and supplier integration; and that supplier integration is
signiﬁcantly and positively related to ﬁnancial performance. The results also show that customer
satisfaction is signiﬁcantly and positively related to ﬁnancial performance and fully mediates the
relationship between customer integration and ﬁnancial performance. Consistent with organizational
learning theory the study shows that internal integration is an enabler for external integration which
suggests that companies need to progress from good internal practices and processes to effective
management of external processes. In particular this study positions the beneﬁts of integration as
accruing from learning and ﬁnancial performance being correlated to information ﬂows. This study
suggests that integration is the mechanism whereby information is transmitted and subsequently
synthesized. The contextualization and organization afforded through internal integration facilitates
determining what information to bring in from outside the organization and knowing what to do with
the information when it arrives. Hence a contribution of this study is to tie supply chain integration to
the literature and principles of organizational learning theory thereby opening a new perspective on
the topic.

Introduction

Supply chain management (SCM) seeks to enhance competitive
performance by closely integrating the internal functions within a
company and effectively linking them with the external operations
of suppliers, customers, and other channel members (Kim, 2009).
Through cross-functional integration within a ﬁrm and integration
with suppliers and/or customers superior supply chain perfor-
mance can be achieved (Kim, 2009; Swink et al., 2007; Van der
Vaart and Van Donk, 2008; Zailani and Rajagopal, 2005; Zhao
et al., 2011). The importance of supply chain integration (SCI) has
been conceptually and empirically addressed in the literature and
has become well accepted by researchers (Flynn et al., 2010;

Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Lau et al., 2010; Mason-Jones and
Towill, 1997).

The beneﬁts of

integrating and coordinating supply chain
partners have been recognized in many industries (Flynn et al.,
2010; Wong et al., 2011), and SCI is considered to be one of the
major factors in improving performance (Van der Vaart and Van
Donk, 2008). Yet there have been a collection of voices indicating
that SCI is not an effective strategy for improving performance
(Bask and Juga, 2001; Christopher and Juttner, 2000; Fabbe-Costes
and Jahre, 2008; Harland, 1996; Power, 2005). Few voices have
made explicit ties to overarching theory and none of which we are
learning theory. Hence one possible
aware to organizational
conclusion must be that the understanding of
integration is
incomplete (Boon-itt and Paul, 2006: Childerhouse and Towill,
2000) and this incomplete understanding regarding the implica-
tions of integration remains a challenge for both researchers and
managers (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008). Consequently, there
have been calls for further empirical research on the link between
integration and performance (Min and Menzer, 2004; Rodrigues
et al., 2004; Stank et al., 2001).

Some studies (e.g. Stevens, 1989, 1990) conceptually describe
the relationship between internal and external integration, but

empirical studies investigating the relationship offer limited evi-
dence and insight (Hillebrand and Biemans, 2003; Zhao et al.,
2011). This could be attributable to the models tested, as they
generally link integration directly to performance. One such study
is that of Braunscheidel and Suresh (2009) which modeled and
found support for the direct link between both internal and
external
integration and agility. The inconsistency of ﬁndings
and calls for additional research on the topic are suggestive of a
missing variable.

Just as integration has been linked to performance, there has
been a signiﬁcant amount of research into the relationship between
customer satisfaction and performance (Heskett et al., 1994, 1997;
Reichheld, 1996). The results show a positive correlation between
satisﬁed customers and performance (Dotson and Allenby, 2010;
Lambert et al., 1998; Narayanan et al., 2011). Since one aim of supply
chain integration is to improve customer satisfaction and customer
satisfaction has been linked to performance, we suggest that
customer satisfaction may be the missing variable.

This study seeks to illuminate the role of customer satisfaction
in the context of SCI and its impact on ﬁnancial performance and
does so through the lens of organizational learning theory. The
study is designed in such a way that we can also provide insight
into the relationship between the two dimensions of SCI: internal
and external integration. Hence a contribution of this study is to
tie SCI to the literature and principles of organizational learning
theory thus opening a new perspective on the topic.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, a
theoretical perspective is offered and research hypotheses are
developed. Second, the study design and methodological proce-
dures are described. Third, the ﬁndings of the study are presented
and discussed, and a set of managerial implications are drawn.
Lastly, we conclude with a brief summation, the main limitations,
and offer topics for future research.

2. Theoretical background and research hypotheses

2.1. Organizational learning theory

Organizational learning is reﬂected in changes in organizational
knowledge (March, 1991). Organizational learning is exempliﬁed by
sensing environmental changes and responding to them (Argyris
and Shon, 1978). The information gained from having sensed a
change in the environment, when contextualized and acted upon,
leads to new knowledge and learning; learning being the applica-
tion of the information for deﬁnitional purposes or the establish-
ment or reﬁnement of a causal relationship (Busche, 2009). Hence a
key aspect of organizational learning is the interaction that takes
place between parties, be they individuals or organizations (Argyris
and Shon, 1978). Knowledge pertains to information related to facts,
concepts,
ideas, observations, and judgements
(Alavi and Leidner, 2001). Taken with the principle that knowledge
is created by the ﬂow of information (Nonaka, 1994), learning is
thus the accumulation of knowledge and the understanding of its
potential beneﬁt.

interpretations,

SCM entails coordinating ﬂows of materials, information, and
funds to create customer value while simultaneously seeking to
improve proﬁtability (Warkentin et al., 2001). Coordination amongst
trading partners requires shared knowledge to enable the effective
management of activities. Hence knowledge becomes a ﬂow in its
own right (Alhashmi et al., 2006) with its success dependent upon
the web of organizational relationships. As such the supply chain, in
particular the integration of trading partners, becomes a mechanism
for transmitting knowledge and building organizational learning.

2.2. Supply chain integration

SCM comprises the integration of key business processes that
entail the provision of products, services, and information adding
value for customers and other stakeholders from design through
delivery, from original suppliers to end user (Gunasekaran and Ngai,
2004; Lambert et al., 1998). If viewed from the perspective of an
actor network (Callon, 1986) then integration can be represented by
Porter's “value chain” (Porter, 1985, 1987). Porter suggests that
enhancing the effectiveness of the linkages between activities
(primary and support) enhances efﬁciency, thereby increasing
proﬁtability. SCI is conceptualized as a process of redeﬁning and
connecting entities through coordinating or sharing information
and resources (Katunzi, 2011). This includes collaboratively mana-
ging intra- and inter-organizational processes to achieve effective
and efﬁcient ﬂows of products, services, information, and money
with the objective of providing maximum value to customers
(Bowersox et al., 1999; Naylor et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2008).

integration and internal

SCI is a multidimensional construct (Flynn et al., 2010). The
literature reveals consensus that there are mainly two types of SCI:
external
integration (Narasimhan and
Kim, 2002; Swink, et al., 2007; Vijayasarathy, 2010). External
integration comprises supplier and customer integration (Droge
et al., 2012). Petersen et al. (2005) indicate that the supplier
integration entails providing information and participating
directly in making decisions. Supplier integration is characterized
by the buyer and upstream supplier having a cooperative relation-
ship. The relationships could potentially include initiatives and
programs fostering linkages between the trading partners. Custo-
mer integration encompasses ﬂows of information, service, and
materials; information ﬂowing back from customer to supplier
and services and materials ﬂowing forward (Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Carter, 1998). In particular,
Wisner et al. (2008) indicate that customer integration entails
understanding the interaction between the supplier's products
and processes and the customer's business. The attention and
resources committed by the supplier for these activities are for the
purpose of helping the customer improve its competitive standing.
As such, customer integration entails incorporating customers in
decisions pertaining to the products sold by the supplier (Pagh and
Cooper, 1998; van Hoek et al., 1998) and encompasses the methods
and strategies employed to improve coordination between the
trading partners (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). Internal integra-
tion is the coordination, collaboration and integration of functional
areas within the ﬁrm (Stock et al., 1998). The aim of internal
integration is that
the departments and functions within a
company function as a cohesive process. To help make the role
of integration in this study clear the research model is shown in

2.3. The effect of internal integration on external integration

There are good theoretical reasons for internal and external
integration to be related. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) suggest that
the ability to assimilate and put to beneﬁcial use new information is
a function of the existing information within the ﬁrm. Carlile and
Rebentisch (2003) build on this by concluding that the ability to put
information to beneﬁcial use depends on how effectively the
information is organized. Hence, information must be able to be
accessed and exchanged within an organization before information
from sources external to the organization can amend it. Furthermore,
the robustness of the information is the limiting factor to what can
be acquired from outside the organization. Given that a signiﬁcant
portion of integration entails the exchange of information, the
principles of organizational learning may be informative; internal
integration entailing the exchange of information within the organi-
zation and external integration the acquisition of information from
outside the organization that can be assimilated and synthesized.

One aspect of organizational learning is sense making (Busche,
2009). Information is codiﬁed and used to develop deﬁnitions and
common understandings. This facilitates communication within the

organization and will facilitate information exchanges for sources
external to the organization since the information brought in will be
contextualized by the deﬁnitions and common understandings within
the organization. It is this basic foundation that enables an organiza-
tion to develop mutually shared knowledge with a trading partner
and consequently increase the level of understanding between the
entities (Cramton, 2001). Further, if organizational learning includes
bringing information from outside, then the outside information must
be able to be contextualized and migrated through the organization.
Hence prerequisite is the ability to manage information ﬂows within
the organization. This antecedent role of internal integration has been
posited in the literature, but not explained theoretically. For example,
Braunscheidel and Suresh (2009) indicate that internal integration
contributes toward developing external integration and Zhao et al.
(2011) support this indication by empirically establishing that orga-
nizations must ﬁrst develop internal integration capabilities through
system-, data-, and process-integration before they can engage in
meaningful integration with external partners. Therefore, we con-
clude that internal integration is antecedent and positively related to
the external
integration dimensions of customer integration and
supplier integration. As such we offer the following hypotheses:

integration and (B) supplier integration.

integration is positively related to (A) customer

2.4. Customer and supplier integration and customer satisfaction

Since customer satisfaction can be conceptualized at least in two
different ways, it may be useful to clarify how we are conceptualizing
it here. Boulding et al. (1993) indicate that customer satisfaction can
be transaction speciﬁc or cumulative. Herein we use the cumulative
conceptualization; the overall evaluation of the purchase consump-
tion experiences over time (Fornell, 1992). Transaction speciﬁc
customer satisfaction may yield meaningful insight into a particular
encounter and may be predictive of additional transactions, but
cumulative satisfaction is a more fundamental conceptualization of a
ﬁrm's past, current, and future performance (Anderson et al., 1994).
Customer satisfaction is an important theoretical as well as practical
issue for most marketers and consumer researchers (Fournier and
Mick, 1999; Jamal and Naser, 2002). This is evidenced by ﬁrms
focusing on customer satisfaction to cultivate loyalty within their
customer base (Levesque and McDougall, 1996; Reichheld, 2003).
As the beneﬁts of increased loyalty are becoming better understood,
customer satisfaction is increasingly becoming a more important
corporate goal (Bitner, 1990; Das et al., 2010; Reichheld, 2009). The
degree to which customer satisfaction can be enhanced depends on
how well the trading partners are integrated (Johnston et al., 2004).
Organizational learning theory helps explain why integration
should be related to customer satisfaction. Mutual knowledge
created through information shared along the supply chain
increases the probability of a common understanding among the
parties (Cramton, 2001). Hence a customer's expectations are kept
consistent with the supply chain's ability to meet the customer's
need; met expectations being correlated with satisﬁed customers,
especially to the extent the customer has contributed to the
mutual knowledge created by the shared information. Further,
knowledge ﬂows are associated with higher levels of performance
(Bontis and Crossan, 2002) and to the extent the performance
improves in dimensions important to the customer, it is reason-
able to expect customer satisfaction to rise (Reichheld, 2003). For
example, through collaboration with customers and suppliers
ﬁrms can learn to tailor service offerings to more closely match
speciﬁc customer requirements (Stank et al., 2001).

Looked at from the perspective of learning curves, given that
integration with customers and suppliers is related to customer
satisfaction and given the relationship between customer satisfac-
tion and loyalty, then there is a larger number of transactions with
the same customers when the ﬁrm is integrated with its trading
partners. Greater numbers of transactions push ﬁrms further
down the curve enabling improved service levels, reduced costs,
greater responsiveness, and improved decision making (Wong
et al., 2011); attributes all related to customer satisfaction.

Nonaka (1994) indicates that socialization and combination are
the ﬁrst two steps in the knowledge creation process. This is
manifested by bringing information into the organization through
integrating with trading partners. Information about customer
requirements, expectations, and preferences can be synthesized
and acted upon to amend or create service and product offerings.
For example, the information exchange afforded through supplier
integration can lead to reduced product development times, more
reliable products, and products with which customers are more
satisﬁed (Carr and Pearson, 2002; Eltantawy et al., 2009; Lau et al.,
2010; Sharland et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2000; Tracey and Tan, 2001;
Vonderembse and Tracey, 1999; Wong et al., 2011). Customer
integration entails gathering information from customers and
combining it with existing information for the purpose of product
and service innovation and improvement (Edvardsson et al., 2012).

This gathering, combining, and externalizing of the information
follows Nonaka's (1994) theory of knowledge creation.

Organization learning theory suggests that knowledge transfer
leads to competitive advantage (Argote and Ingram, 2000). It is
possible that the information gleaned from trading partners could
be embodied in the products and services offered thus leading to a
superior offering through which competitive advantage is attained.
This principle is supported in the operations management literature
as previous studies have shown that the particular way in which
customers are integrated has a major impact on the quality of
information gained, and therefore on product and service develop-
ment and customer satisfaction (Magnusson et al., 2003). Heikkila
(2002) suggests that understanding the customer's situation and
need together with the right product offering contributes to improv-
ing the demand chain, which further leads to superior supply chain
efﬁciency and high customer satisfaction. Since learning theory
suggests and others offer empirical support for a linkage between
integration and customer satisfaction (Homburg and Stock, 2004;
Koufteros et al., 2005; Song and Di Benedetto, 2008), we offer the
following hypotheses:

H2. (A) Customer and (B) supplier integration are positively
related to customer satisfaction.

2.5. Customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance

The importance of customer satisfaction in achieving competi-
tive advantage has been examined in both the service and
manufacturing environments. As suggested by the service–proﬁt
chain (Heskett et al., 1994), there is a positive relationship between
customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance, ceteras paraibus
(Anderson and Mittal, 2000; Chi and Gursoy, 2009).

Customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance are linked
through the increased number of similar transactions and attendant
learning resulting from a higher level of customer loyalty (Reichheld
and Sasser, 1990). Speciﬁcally increased customer satisfaction, which
may be attributable to increased performance resulting from
improved comprehension of customer wants and needs (Weick and
Roberts, 1993), drives increased loyalty which in turn yields a steady
stream of future cash ﬂows (Reichheld and Sasser, 1990). These cash
ﬂows are more steady and certain, in part, because high levels of
customer satisfaction tend to reduce price inelasticity (Garvin, 1988).
This means that a premium can be extracted for the product or
service, or fewer price promotions would be required to ensure
purchase. Furthermore, since there are a greater number of purchases
from the same buyers attributable to increased loyalty, learning effects
reduce transaction costs (Fornell, 1992) and the number of failures
(Crosby, 1979). Given these rationales, we offer the third hypothesis:

H3. Customer
performance.

satisfaction is positively related to ﬁnancial

2.6. Customer and supplier integration and ﬁnancial performance

Since Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) reported that integrating
with customers and suppliers yields better performance than not,
there has been a growing interest concerning the strategic impor-
tance of
integrating suppliers, manufacturers, and customers.
Researchers have found that customer and supplier integration
improve service performance (Droge et al., 2012; Van der Vaart and
Van Donk, 2008), responsiveness (Droge et al., 2004; Flynn et al.,
2010) ﬂexibility (Jacobs et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2011), sales and
market growth (Droge et al., 2004; Kim, 2009), and cost (Jacobs et al.,
2007; Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008). However, not all studies
ﬁnd a direct performance relationship. For example, Vickery et al.
(2003) found that customer service fully mediates the relationship


350

W. Yu et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 146 (2013) 346–358

between integration and ﬁnancial performance. Additionally, many
studies use a mix of market and ﬁnancial performance as the
dependent variable and label it business performance or something
similar (e.g. Flynn et al., 2010; Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). Hence
this study, along with Vickery et al. (2003), is unique in its considera-
tion of purely ﬁnancial performance.

It has become accepted within the literature that the greater
degrees of SCI generally lead to higher levels of performance (Droge
et al., 2004; Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). This outcome is to be
expected when looking at the relationship between integration and
ﬁnancial performance through the lens of organizational learning
theory. Knowledge growth occurs from building upon existing
relationships (Kogut and Zander, 1996) and organizational learning
develops through repetition and variation (Jacobs and Swink, 2011).
The result is that ﬁrms can use the ensuing knowledge, represented
by new information and/or know-how, to create new processes and
relationships which improve their strategic position (Alhashmi
et al., 2006).

Better knowledge management practices lead to improved orga-
nizational efﬁciency (Gold et al., 2001). Integration plays a role in this
by potentially increasing the amount and frequency of information
exchanged and providing multiple opportunities to synthesize it. For
example inventory can be reduced with more frequent and richer
exchanges of information (Manthou et al., 2004) such as a nightly
sharing and analysis of point of sale information. This facilitates
gaining knowledge about cause and effect relationships pertaining to
pricing, volume, and competitor actions. The result is faster responses
to market changes with smaller amounts of working capital com-
mitted to inventory.

Knowledge is created by the ﬂow of information (Nonaka, 1994).
Since the variable cost of electronic integration is low it is reasonable
to expect more frequent information ﬂows with greater richness.
Additional breadth of information via electronic and design integra-
tion act to increase the absorptive capacity of the ﬁrm thereby
creating the opportunity for greater learning (Cohen and Levinthal,
1990). Hence, it is clear that integration leads to learning and there is
a rich literature that supports a linkage from learning to ﬁnancial
performance (Balasubramanian and Lieberman, 2010; Bergh and Lim,
2008; Chien and Tsai, 2012; Yannopoulos et al., 2012). As such we
offer the following hypotheses:

H4. (A) Customer integration and (B) supplier integration are
positively related to ﬁnancial performance.

3. Methodology

3.1. Sampling and data collection

The data for this study were obtained from a primary survey of
manufacturers in China, which, as a global manufacturing center,
plays a very important role in many supply chains (Zhao et al., 2011).
Despite the increasing research interests in operations management
in the Chinese context, few studies on supply chain integration have
been conducted in China (Zhao et al., 2011, 2008; Flynn et al., 2010).
Furthermore, most previous empirical studies (e.g. Gimenez and
Ventura, 2005; Koufteros et al., 2005; Swink et al., 2007) on SCI have
been conducted in the context of developed countries, such as
the U.S. Therefore, there is a need for empirically testing and
validating theories of SCI and relationship management in different
cultural settings (Huff and Kelley, 2003). Studies in developing
countries such as China will allow us to assess the validity of the
SCI arguments posed to date.

Geographically, survey respondents comprise ﬁrms in a number of
regions and provinces, e.g. Beijing and Hebei province (north China),
Henan province (central China), Zhejiang province (east China), and
Guangdong province (south China). To obtain a representative sample,

we used the Yellow Pages of China Telecom in each of the six
provinces as our sampling pool (Flynn et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011).
Many previous studies on SCI (e.g. Flynn et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2008;
Wong et al., 2011) have used a single informant in examining SCI and
relationship management issues between different organizations,
while some researchers (e.g. Bruggen et al., 2002) have demonstrated
the beneﬁts of using multiple informants. Zhao et al. (2011) suggest
that the best way forward is that of a single key informant who is
knowledgeable in supply chain and operations management, in order
to collect reliable data concerning relationship management and SCI.
Consistent with the above discussion, for each randomly selected
manufacturer, we identiﬁed a key informant with the help of guanxi
networks (personal connections with government ofﬁcials, industrial
authorities, and local universities). Typical titles (such as CEO, pre-
sident, director, supply chain manger, operations manager, and
marketing and sales manager) were identiﬁed as our key respondents
because of their knowledge on the level of supply chain and opera-
tions management practices in their ﬁrms. Most of the respondents
had been in their position for more than 5 yr, which suggests that our
informants were knowledgeable about the issues under study. Thus, it
is reasonable to expect that the respondents could offer deep insights
into the functional activities and be knowledgeable about the content
of the inquiry. We contacted the key informants by telephone and
email before sending out the questionnaire, in order to conﬁrm their
knowledge and obtain their preliminary agreement to participate
(Dillman, 2000).

We attempted to maximize the response rate and minimize
response bias in subjective data obtained from the respondents
using several steps suggested by studies on survey research (e.g.
Dillman, 2000; Frohlich, 2002). The questionnaires were sent to 736
manufacturing ﬁrms that agreed to participate in the study. Each
questionnaire was accompanied by a cover letter indicating the
purpose of the study and potential contributions. The letter also
assured complete conﬁdentiality to the respondents. Additionally, to
encourage participation and improve the response rate, the respon-
dents were promised a summary of the study ﬁndings. Following
Frohlich's (2002) suggestion, follow-up calls were made to encourage
completion and return of the questionnaires and to clarify any
questions or concerns that potentially had arisen. A total of 221
completed questionnaires were received. Seven returned question-
naires were discarded due to incomplete information, thus leaving
214 responses for use in the subsequent analyses. The response rate
was 29.1%, which exceeds the recommended number of 20% for
empirical studies in production and operations management
(Malhotra and Grover, 1998). In addition to collecting data on the
main study variables, we also collected demographic data on the
ﬁrms including industry type, sales, and number of employees.
A proﬁle of the respondents is reported in Table 1.

3.2. Non-response bias and common method bias

To assess the threat from non-response bias, we conducted a
test using the extrapolation method suggested by Armstrong and
Overton (1977). We compared early and late responses on their
demographic characteristics of industry type, annual sales, and
number of employees. The t-test results indicate no signiﬁcant
statistical difference (po0.05), which suggests that non-response
bias does not appear to be a major concern in this study.

Since we collected data from a single respondent per company
using the self-reported questionnaire, common method bias might
be an issue (Podsakoff et al., 2003). To evaluate whether this threat
to validity was present, several steps were taken. First, Harmon's
single-factor test of common method bias was used to ensure that
no single factor accounted for the majority of covariance between
the predictor and criterion variables (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The
results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) show ﬁve distinct

factors with eigenvalues above 1.0 and explaining 65.6% of total
variance. The ﬁrst factor explained 31.5% of the variance, which is
not the majority of the total variance. The ﬁnding suggests that the
common method bias does not appear to be a problem. Second, to
further assess common method bias, conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA) was applied to Harman's single-factor model (Flynn et al.,
2010; Podsakoff et al., 2003). The model ﬁt indices of χ2/df
(1451.245/252)¼5.759, CFI¼0.519, IFI¼0.523, TLI¼0.473, RMSEA
¼0.149, and SRMR¼0.135 were unacceptable and were signiﬁ-
cantly worse than those of the measurement model. This suggests
that a single factor model is not acceptable, thus common method
bias is unlikely. Third, a latent factor representing a common
method was added to the measurement model, which is the
strongest test of common method bias (MacKenzie et al., 1993;
Podsakoff et al., 2003; Williams and Anderson, 1994; Zhao et al.,
2011). The resulting ﬁts were not signiﬁcantly different from those
of the measurement model (RMSEA¼0.054 vs. 0.054 for the model
with the common method factor; CF1¼0.939 vs. 0.944; IF1¼0.940
vs. 0.945; TLI¼0.931 vs. 0.932). Also, the item loadings for their
factors are still signiﬁcant in spite of the inclusion of a common
latent factor. As such, we conclude that common method variance
bias is not an issue in this study.

3.3. Measures and questionnaire design

We surveyed the literature to identify valid measures for related
constructs and adapted items from existing scales to measure internal
integration (Flynn et al., 2010; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Zhao et al.,
2011), customer integration (Flynn et al., 2010; Narasimhan and Kim,
2002; Zhao et al., 2011), supplier integration (Flynn et al., 2010;
Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Zhao
et al., 2011), customer satisfaction (Heskett et al., 1994; Kassinis and

Soteriou, 2003) and ﬁnancial performance (Flynn et al., 2010;
Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Terjesena et al., 2011). A seven-point
Likert scale was used for all the above constructs; a higher value
indicated stronger integration, or a better customer satisfaction and
performance. The measurement items are presented in Table 2.

We included four items conceptually related to information
sharing (c.f. Grean and Shaw, 2002) with customers about market
information, point of sales (POS) information, demand forecasts, and
production plans (Flynn et al., 2010; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002;
Stank et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2011). Seven items measure informa-
tion sharing and cooperation with suppliers,
including sharing
information with major suppliers on production schedules, produc-
tion capacity, available inventory, production plans, demand fore-
casts, and inventory levels (Flynn et al., 2010; Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Stank et al., 2001;
Zhao et al., 2011). We also used ﬁve items to measure internal
integration that captured data or information and process integra-
tion, and cross-functional teams and full
integration
(Flynn et al., 2010; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Stank et al., 2001;
Zhao et al., 2011). All these supply chain integration items were
measured on seven-point Likert scales from 1 (not at all) to 7
(extensively).

functional

Andreassen and Lindestad (1998) suggest that the customer
satisfaction indicators should tap into the construct by addressing
overall satisfaction and congruence with expectations. Situational
factors such as non-availability of services may affect the accuracy
of measuring behavioral consequences based on panel data (Bass,
1974). Self-reported measures are less affected by these factors and
thus have an advantage over the measures based on panel data
(Lam et al., 2004). Following the research in customer satisfaction
(e.g. Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003), we collected self-reported
measures of the customer satisfaction construct. Respondents
were asked to rate the degree of agreement or disagreement with
statements relating to customer satisfaction level, on whether
customers' expectations were met or exceeded using a seven-
point scale (1¼ “strongly agree”; 7¼ “strongly disagree”). Survey
respondents had extensive knowledge to answer such questions,
given the level of sophistication of the manufacturers in our
sample and information acquired through independent market
research studies or from manufactures.

Financial performance was measured using ﬁve perceptual
measures, including growth in sales, growth in proﬁt, growth in
market share, return on investment (ROI), and growth in ROI
(Flynn et al., 2010; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Terjesena et al.,
2011). In accordance with previous operations management stu-
dies, our respondents were also asked to assess their performance
relative to the performance of main competitors over the last
3 years. The indicators were measured using a seven-point Likert
scale (ranging from 1 “much worse” to 7 “much better”).

We used ﬁrm size, measured by number of employees, as a
control variable in our model. Firm size was controlled in the
current analyses because larger manufacturers may have more
resources for supply chain activities and possess more fully
developed supply chain integration. As a result, they may achieve
a higher level of supply chain integration compared with small
ﬁrms (Zhao et al., 2011). Additionally, larger ﬁrms will be more
likely to overcome performance threatening liabilities.

Since the scales adapted from the literature were in English, the
original scale was ﬁrst developed in English and then translated
into Chinese, in order to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire
(Zhao et al., 2011). A back-translation process was used to ensure
conceptual equivalence (Cai et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2011).
A number of questions were reworded to improve the accuracy
of the translation and to make it relevant to practices in China.
Before executing the survey, two academics from the ﬁeld of
supply chain and operations management reviewed the initial

measurement scales and provided feedback (Cai et al., 2010). We
then conducted a pilot-test with two directors and one president
in China to ensure that the questions were clear, meaningful,
relevant and easy to interpret (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998).
Minor changes to the scales were made accordingly.

3.4. Reliability and validity

The unidimensionality of the key constructs was assessed by a
conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA results summarized in
Table 2 show that the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) values and the
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) values are well
above the recommended cut-off value of 0.90 and below the
recommended value of 0.08 respectively (Byrne, 2009; Hair
et al., 2006; Hu and Bentler, 1999), which suggests the constructs
are unidimensional. Furthermore, the incremental ﬁt index (IFI)
and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) are also well above the recom-
mended threshold of 0.90 (Hu and Bentler, 1999). In addition,
other ﬁt indices, such as the Chi-square value normalized by
degrees of freedom (χ2/df) and the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA), are also acceptable (Hu and Bentler,
1999). Based on the CFA results, we conclude that the model is
acceptable and unidimensionality conﬁrmed (Byrne, 2009; Hair
et al., 2006; Hu and Bentler, 1999). Table 3 includes the sample
covariance matrix for our data set.

Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient and composite reliability (CR)
were used to examine the reliabilities among the items within
each factor. As shown in Table 2, Cronbach's alpha and composite
reliability of all the constructs exceed the widely recognized rule
of thumb of 0.70, which indicate adequate reliability of the
measurement scales (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Nunnally, 1978;
O'Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998).

We evaluated the convergent validity of each measurement
scale by conducting another CFA using the maximum likelihood
approach (O'Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998). Generally, a construct
with indicator loadings of at least 0.50, a signiﬁcant t-value
(t42.0), or both, is considered to manifest convergent validity
(Hair et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2011). As shown in Table 2, all
construct indicators are statistically signiﬁcant (po0.001) with
factor loadings greater than 0.50, which suggests the theoretical
constructs express convergent validity (Anderson and Gerbing,
1988). The results of the CFA also reveal that the standardized
coefﬁcients manifest the appropriate criteria; speciﬁcally they are
at least twice the standard error and possess signiﬁcant t values.
Therefore, all items are signiﬁcantly related to their underlying
theoretical constructs. Additionally, the average variance extracted
(AVE) of each construct is either close to or exceeds the recom-
mended minimum value of 0.50 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), which
indicates strong convergent validity.

Discriminant validity was examined using Chi-square differ-
ence test (Bagozzi et al., 1991). Signiﬁcant χ2 differences between
all pairs of constructs suggest discriminant validity (Bagozzi et al.,
1991; O'Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998). A constrained CFA model
for every possible pair of latent constructs was examined (the
correlations between the paired constructs were constrained to
1.0). We then compared the constrained model with the original
unconstrained model allowing the correlations among constructs
to be freely estimated (Bagozzi et al., 1991). The results indicate
that all χ2 differences between the ﬁxed and unconstrained model
(po0.05), providing evidence of discriminant
are signiﬁcant
validity between each measurement scale (Bagozzi et al., 1991).
Table 4 summarizes the χ2 for the unconstrained and constrained
models. In addition, Table 5 reports the means, standard devia-
tions, and correlations of all the theoretical constructs. The square

root of the average variance extracted of all the constructs is
greater than the correlation between any pair of them as shown in
Table 5, which provides further evidence of discriminant validity
(Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
4. Results

To test the hypothesized links in our conceptual framework
structural equation modeling (SEM),via AMOS 21, was used in this
study. Anderson and Gerbing (1988) suggested a two-step proce-
dure for applying SEM. The ﬁrst step involves testing the measure-
ment model and the second step involves testing the structural
model. The measurement model basically involves verifying the
unidimensionality of the constructs, which is the same as the CFA
described in the previous section. The second step involves testing
the structural model, which involves verifying structural relation-
ships represented by our hypotheses. The summation of the
hypothesized results can be found in Table 6 and Fig. 2 and are
discussed along with the structural model
in the following
paragraphs.

Although we controlled for each ﬁrm's size, the factor does not
impact on ﬁrm performance (β¼0.026,
have an apparent
p¼0.709). Table 6 indicates that the paths from internal integra-
tion to customer and supplier integration are signiﬁcant at the
0.001 signiﬁcance level. Thus, Hypotheses 1Aand B are fully
supported. The path analytic model also shows that customer
integration has a signiﬁcant positive effect on customer satisfac-
tion and customer satisfaction is signiﬁcantly and positively
related to ﬁnancial performance. However, no signiﬁcance was
found for the path between supplier integration and customer
satisfaction. Thus the results strongly support our Hypotheses 2A
and 3, but reject Hypotheses 2B. Table 6 also illustrates that
supplier integration is signiﬁcantly and positively associated with
ﬁnancial performance, whereas there is no statistically signiﬁcant
direct relationship between customer integration and ﬁnancial
performance. Hence, Hypothesis 4A is rejected, but Hypothesis 4B
is fully supported.

As depicted in Table 7, the overall ﬁts of the structural model
are good, with the CFI, IFI, and TLI well above the recommended
threshold of 0.90 (Hu and Bentler, 1999), the RMSEA less than 0.06
(Hu and Bentler, 1999), and the SRMR less than 0.08 (Hu and
Bentler, 1999).

To identify the extent to which customer satisfaction mediates
the effects of customer integration on ﬁnancial performance, an
additional model that links customer integration and performance
was estimated. As shown in Table 8, the model and results indicate
that customer integration has a signiﬁcant impact on perfor-
mance; however it is through customer satisfaction. Therefore,
per Baron and Kenny (1986), customer satisfaction fully mediates
the effects of customer integration on ﬁnancial performance. To
further validate the relationship we conducted the Sobel test
(Sobel, 1982) to directly examine the signiﬁcance of the mediation
effects since Mackinnon et al. (2002) suggest that the Sobel test is
superior in terms of power and intuitive appeal. The Sobel test
lends additional support for the mediated relationships hypothe-
sized through a change in signiﬁcance of the indirect effect. The
result of the Sobel test (t¼1.961, po0.05) provides support for the
fully mediating effect of customer satisfaction on the relationship
between customer integration and ﬁnancial performance.

external integration, customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance are valid. We found that internal integration signiﬁcantly
inﬂuences both dimensions of external integration, customer and
supplier integration; and that supplier integration is signiﬁcantly
and positively related to ﬁnancial performance. While customer
integration has a signiﬁcant impact on customer satisfaction,
supplier integration does not. Hence, customer satisfaction com-
pletely mediates the effect of customer integration on ﬁnancial
performance whereas the impact of supplier integration is direct.
The purely direct effect of supplier integration on ﬁnancial
performance seems to suggest that supplier integration is trans-
parent to customers; possibly via extra effort on the part of the
manufacturer to make up for any supplier shortcomings. Alter-
natively, one could interpret that customers are simply indifferent
as to the manufacturer's integration with the suppliers, but are

concerned only with the outcome (e.g. timely delivery, proper
quality level).

Our study shows that internal integration is an enabler for
external integration with customers and suppliers, which indicates
that companies need to progress from good internal practices and
processes to effective management of external processes. Our
ﬁnding corroborates previous studies (e.g. Braunscheidel and
Suresh, 2009; Stevens, 1989; Zhao et al., 2011), but adds that
external integration with customers and suppliers signiﬁcantly
contributes to performance improvement either directly or indir-
ectly depending on the type of
integration. This ﬁnding is
consistent with principles of organizational learning stating that
what can be gained from external sources depends upon the
internal resources (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and points to
support for the assertion that competitive advantage can accrue
through knowledge management. This brings up the question as to
whether the corollary between integration and organizational
learning is bidirectional, e.g. since external
integration with
customers and suppliers represents a higher level of capability
(Stevens, 1989; Zhao et al., 2011), does knowledge gained from
external sources represent a higher level than that from internal
sources?

This study evidences the importance for manufacturers to
cooperate closely with their external customers and suppliers by
empirically linking integration with superior ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. In particular, the model explains 15.3% of the variance in
ﬁnancial performance. A potential rationale for this is that building
collaborative relationships with suppliers helps manufacturers
reduce mistakes and wastage in activities across partner ﬁrms
through information sharing and joint planning. External integra-
tion with suppliers allows the manufacturer to be rapidly updated
on the progress of its orders at the supplier's plant and to decide
jointly with the supplier the most appropriate plan modiﬁcations
in order to accommodate ﬁnal customer requests (Danese and
Romano, 2011). Another potential rational is that customer inte-
gration helps a manufacturer better understand customer require-
ments and better forecast customer demand, thus allowing the
manufacturer to provide better quality and more innovative

products at lower cost. These will, in turn, lead to better ﬁnancial
performance. On the other hand, as an antecedent to external
integration,
integration can be embraced by internal
functions in order to establish cooperative plans with external
supply chain partners.

internal

The analysis reveals that customer integration has a signiﬁcant
impact on customer satisfaction, and that customer satisfaction is
positively and signiﬁcantly associated with ﬁnancial performance.
Hence, customer satisfaction is supported as a missing variable that
could explain the inconsistent ﬁndings reported in prior studies.
Because customer integration generates opportunities for exchan-
ging, building, and leveraging the knowledge embedded in colla-
borative processes, manufacturers can reduce costs, create greater
value, and detect demand changes more quickly. These, in turn, will
strengthen customer satisfaction. Within integrated supply chains,
building strong strategic partnerships with customers will facilitate
understanding and anticipation of the customer's needs by the
manufacturer so as to better meet changing requirements. A close
relationship between trading partners provides opportunities for
enhancing the accuracy of demand forecasts. This leads to greater
responsiveness to customers through better product design, pro-
duction planning, and reduced inventory obsolescence (Flynn et al.,
2010). Our ﬁndings suggest that customer satisfaction is crucial
for better ﬁnancial performance, which indicates that an exception-
ally high level of customer service, obtained through a strategic

partnership with the customer, is likely to offer opportunities for
manufacturing success.

Our understanding of the SCI–performance relationship can be
signiﬁcantly expanded by taking into consideration the mediating
effect of customer satisfaction. In particular this research reveals
there is no beneﬁt to performance from customer integration
activities unless customer satisfaction is present. This suggests
that ﬁrms should work closely with customers to better learn
about them and fully understand their needs and requirements so
that satisfaction can be improved. Another interpretation is that
customer integration is one strategy to spur customer satisfaction,
most likely through the information exchange and resultant
learning. In regards to supplier integration, it might be concluded
that market based strategies may be preferable to establishing
long term collaborative relationships since supplier integration
has no signiﬁcant bearing on customer satisfaction.

5.2. Theoretical and managerial implications

Consistent with the above discussion, our study makes a
contribution to the understanding of SCI in the manufacturing
sector on theoretical and managerial fronts. On the theoretical
front, our study ties beneﬁts and rationales for integrating with
trading partners to organizational learning theory and the linkages
it brings. In particular this study positions the beneﬁts of integra-
tion as accruing from learning. It suggests that customer satisfac-
tion is a function of how well the supplier understands the
customer since information ﬂow is correlated with integration
and integration is signiﬁcantly related to ﬁnancial performance.

Our study not only provides insight to a missing variable
(customer satisfaction) that may help explain inconsistencies in
the ﬁndings of prior studies, but also explains the role of learning
in establishing the importance of this variable. By testing the
relationships among internal integration, customer and supplier
integration, customer satisfaction, and ﬁnancial performance we
highlight the critical role of customer satisfaction in linking
integration to ﬁnancial performance. As such this study adds
greater comprehensiveness and richness to the SCI
literature.
An important contribution of the study is that it provides empiri-
cal support for Cohen and Levinthal's (1990) proposition that the
ability to assimilate and put to constructive use new information is
a function of the existing information infrastructure. Simulta-
neously the ﬁndings of this study support the stage perspective
of SCI as suggested by Stevens (1989), who positions internal
integration as antecedent to external integration. Possibly most
signiﬁcantly, this study addresses the matter of why integration is
ﬁnancially beneﬁcial to ﬁrms; organizational learning. This study
suggests that integration is the mechanism whereby information
is transmitted and subsequently synthesized. The contextualiza-
tion and organization afforded through internal integration facil-
itates determining what information to bring in from outside the
organization and knowing what to do with the information when
it arrives. Hence, this research demonstrates the usefulness of
organizational
learning as a theoretical framework for under-
standing integration and more broadly, supply chains.

On a practical front, the ﬁndings of this study have a number of
managerial implications that could provide valuable insights for
manufacturing companies. Our ﬁndings provide managerial guide-
lines for focusing limited resources to achieve better external
integration with customers and suppliers. Speciﬁcally, external
integration may be improved by investing ﬁrst in internal integra-
tion since it should facilitate a greater level of
information
exchange which could in turn lead to greater levels of knowledge
creation and learning. Since the study found that external integra-
tion with customers and suppliers led to improved ﬁrm perfor-
it tends to support the proposition that competitive
mance,


356

W. Yu et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 146 (2013) 346–358

advantage accrues through learning and knowledge creation.
These theory based relationships imply that manufacturers should
extensively integrate their organizations with trading partners by
pursuing a strategy with a broad arc of integration. From both the
downstream and upstream perspectives of the supply chain, ﬁrms
should try to create situations whereby all participants work
together toward recognizing business synergy to compete effec-
tively with other supply chains. Such collaborative advantages
appear to increase ﬁnancial performance for each supply chain
partner. In addition, ﬁndings of this study suggest that customer
satisfaction is crucial for a better ﬁnancial performance and that
better customer service by meeting and/or exceeding customer's
expectations is likely to offer opportunities for revenue and proﬁt
growth. In today's competitive business environment, to remain
competitive and deliver satisfactory ﬁnancial returns to the own-
ers and shareholders, managers depend heavily on effectively
coping with continuous and unexpected changes. The ability to
respond quickly and effectively and to satisfy customer needs has
become a deﬁning characteristic of competitiveness and of man-
ufacturing success. Firms operating in an increasingly dynamic and
competitive marketplace should place greater emphasis on the
development and maintenance of customer satisfaction in order to
gain superior ﬁnancial performance. Because customer satisfaction
fully mediates customer integration–performance connection, it is
necessary for manufacturers to understand the important role of
customer satisfaction in manufacturing success.

5.3. Limitations and future research

Although this study makes signiﬁcant contributions towards the
understanding of SCI, there are some limitations and more opportu-
nities for future research. Perhaps an important limitation of this
study is that the data analyzed is based on managers' self-perceptive
answers. Although most respondents were senior executives and the
questions were well designed and clear, bias arising from respondent
subjectivity and misunderstanding is a possibility. Additionally not
all respondents were at the same level or held the same role within
the ﬁrm. While this potentially introduces extraneous variance in the
data, it may also strengthen the data by incorporating multiple
perspectives.

In future studies, more objective measures based on secondary
evidence may be included for triangulation. Other limitations of the
study relate to single respondent bias. Each person within the
company might have a different perspective of the company's SCI
and customer satisfaction. Having multiple respondents for each
company could improve the study's reliability. Because the survey
data was only collected from manufacturers, future studies can
broaden their scope by collecting data from various supply chain
partners providing services or processed goods. Factors that may
inﬂuence the degree of internal and external integration (such as
business environment, relationship commitment, trust, and power)
(Yeung et al., 2009) are not examined in our study. Future studies
should investigate the impact of these factors on internal and external
integration. Since the business environment is constantly changing,
longitudinal follow-up studies could be designed to identify these
changes and re-examine whether and how these relationships are
changing. Also, in any model in which causality is suggested, long-
itudinal studies will provide for stronger inferences. Therefore, the
model developed in this study could beneﬁt from being tested in a
longitudinal design.

6. Conclusion

This study advances SCI research by developing theories and
internal

providing empirical evidence to explain the effects of

integration, external

integration on external
integration and the mediating effect of
customer satisfaction on the relationship between customer integra-
tion and ﬁnancial performance. Using organizational learning theory,
this study develops a novel approach to explain the complex relation-
ships among internal
integration, customer
satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance. Our structural path analysis
reveals that internal
integration signiﬁcantly inﬂuences external
integration with customers and suppliers, and that the relationship
between customer integration and ﬁnancial performance is fully
mediated by customer satisfaction. Findings from this study also
provide some guidelines for managers to direct their management
actions for improving customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance
through SCI.
