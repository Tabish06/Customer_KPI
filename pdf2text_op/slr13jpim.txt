Shouldn’t Customers Control Customized
Product Development?*
Lydie P. M. Smets, Fred Langerak, and Serge A. Rijsdijk

Nowadays, customized product development (CPD) is increasingly prevalent in business-to-business settings, which
has motivated manufacturers into development approaches wherein the customer plays an active role. When the
customer is merely viewed as a passive receiver of the customized product, the manufacturer won’t be able to truly
empathize with the customer and might lack important suggestions to create and improve the customized product. It is,
after all, the customer that holds pertinent development information and/or expertise. Yet, customers are not always
motivated to participate and often need to be convinced about the manufacturer’s ability to develop customized
products in a timely and cost-effective manner. Prior literature on interorganizational relationships suggests the use of
formal control, i.e., process and/or output control, to fashion activities in line with expectations so that development
goals can be attained. Thereupon, this study posits that the customer’s use of such formal controls may stimulate
customer participation in CPD. In addition, this study investigates whether manufacturers can indeed beneﬁt from
customer participation in CPD through improved new product performance. To accomplish the research objectives,
survey-based and accounting data are collected on 63 collaborative CPD projects between a plastics manufacturer and
its industrial customers. In conjunction with an add-on experimental study regarding the effect of formal control on
customer participation, this study reveals that the customer’s use of formal control signiﬁcantly increases the level
of customer participation in CPD. Additionally, this study conﬁrms that customer participation positively impacts new
product performance. Together, these results imply that letting the customer use process and/or output control helps the
customer to believe more in the pursuit of CPD goals and successful product customization, thereby encouraging
the customer to participate more actively in CPD. Besides, the ﬁndings imply that increased access to market and
customer need-related information obtained through customer participation is indeed critical for successful CPD.

Introduction

developments,
emerging market dynamics, and increasing
market complexity all have augmented the
demand for customized product development (CPD) in
business-to-business settings (Stump, Athaide, and Joshi,
2002). Customers highly value the development of cus-
tomized products because such products meet customers’
needs and wishes. Manufacturers beneﬁt from CPD as
well because, by doing so, customers notice they can
develop appealing products and offer superior customer
value. Yet, CPD does not exist without signiﬁcant effort.
The pertinent needs reside within the customer; the solu-
tions instead are nested within the manufacturer’s know-

how (Fang, Palmatier, and Evans, 2008). To overcome
this challenge, manufacturers increasingly ask customers
to participate in the development process (Terwiesch and
Loch, 2004). For example, Boeing works with National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop space-
craft for the next-generation Constellation Program, and
also Chaparral Steel, Cisco, Microsoft, and SAP repeat-
edly ask imperative customers to join their development
teams (Nambisan, 2002).

Thus, customers increasingly participate in CPD
projects (Athaide and Klink, 2009). Still, many of them
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to express needs (Terwiesch and Loch,
2004) or ideas and values that differ from those of manu-
facturers (Das and Teng, 1998; Grifﬁn and Hauser, 1996;
Vlaar, Van den Bosch, and Volberda, 2006). As such, it is
difﬁcult for manufacturers to develop customized new
products, even when customers engage actively in the
project. Several studies of interorganizational relation-
ships suggest that appropriate controls can help the cus-
tomer and manufacturer achieve mutual understanding
about customer needs and expectations, encourage proper
product development activities, prevent unwelcome

surprises, and reduce ineffective CPD (e.g., Aulakh,
Kotabe, and Sahay, 1996; Das and Teng, 1998; Inkpen
and Currall, 2004). The concept of control has, however,
received little attention in product development contexts,
and the studies that do exist focus on intraorganizational
control (e.g., Bonner, Ruekert, and Walker, 2002; Poskela
and Martinsuo, 2009; Rijsdijk and van den Ende, 2011).
Therefore, our ﬁrst objective is to examine whether the
customer’s use of formal control enhances customer par-
ticipation in CPD.

Second, this study focuses on the impact of customer
participation in CPD on new product performance. Many
authors, among them Terwiesch and Loch (2004), state
that, during development, closely linking the customer to
the manufacturer is key for new product success. Bonner
and Walker (2004) argue, for instance, that interacting
with customers positively affects the market competence
of development
teams, which in turn enhances new
product success. Likewise, Li and Calantone (1998)
report
that customer-involving development projects
improve the quality of development tasks. Moreover, the
customers themselves also increasingly recognize the

beneﬁts from participating in CPD (Fang et al., 2008).
Against
this background, our aim is to verify that
customer participation in CPD adds to new product
performance.

To address our research objectives, survey-based and
accounting data are gathered about 63 collaborative CPD
projects between the plastics division of a large industrial
corporation and its industrial customers. By adding an
experimental study regarding the effect of formal control
on customer participation, this study shows that the cus-
tomer’s use of such control signiﬁcantly increases its
participation in the CPD project. This study also conﬁrms
that customer participation positively affects new product
performance.

Customer Participation in CPD

Product customization refers to the fashioning of a
product to the needs of a particular customer (Stump
et al., 2002) and generally involves the identiﬁcation of
the customer’s needs and the modiﬁcation of the product
to satisfy those needs (Hegde, Kekre, Rajiv, and
Tadikamalla, 2005). Traditionally, manufacturers tended
to see CPD merely as an internal activity (Piller and
Walcher, 2006). However, when a customer is viewed
only as a passive receiver of customized products, the
manufacturer won’t be able to really identify with the
customer and lacks customer ideas to improve and reﬁne
the product (Sawhney, Verona, and Prandelli, 2005). To
obtain more and better information from the customer,
CPD increasingly motivates development approaches that
involve greater customer participation (Athaide and
Klink, 2009; Heide and Miner, 1992). Customer partici-
pation, in this research, is deﬁned as the extent to which
an industrial customer is involved in the manufacturer’s
process for developing customized new products (Fang,
2008). The customer provides product and market infor-
mation and actively contributes to design and develop-
ment activities. In any case,
the customer plays an
important role by presenting the manufacturer with criti-
cal inputs necessary to develop and market new products
that better meet the customer’s needs (Bogers, Afuah,
and Bastian, 2010).

Successful implementation and management of cus-
tomer participation in product development is likely to
grant the manufacturer a signiﬁcant competitive advan-
tage (Hoyer, Chandy, Dorotic, Krafft, and Singh, 2010).
For that reason, many studies elicit managerial practices
that
improve customer participation in development
projects. For example, Nambisan (2002) and Sawhney
et al. (2005) argue that designing virtual environments

enables customers to express their latent needs and
actively participate in the creation of new products.
Developing toolkits for custom design is also expected to
strengthen the effect of customer participation on devel-
opment performance (von Hippel and Katz, 2002). Hoyer
et al. (2010) argue that the customer’s willingness and
ability to engage productively in a partnership depends on
ﬁnancial, social, technical, and psychological motivators.
A number of other researchers suggest that trust develop-
ment and mutual commitment are indispensable for suc-
cessful collaborative product development (Das and
Teng, 1998; Heide and Miner, 1992; Nonaka, 1994). As
an addition to the extant literature, this study focuses on
the customer’s use of formal control as antecedent for
customer participation in CPD.

Conceptual Model and Hypotheses

The conceptual model is presented in Figure 1. The left
side of the model focuses on the impact of the customer’s
use of formal control, i.e., process and output control, on
the customer’s participation in CPD. Process control is
deﬁned as the extent to which the customer controls the
development team by setting procedures and processes to
be followed; output control as the extent to which the
customer controls the development team by setting goals
(Jaworski, Stathakopoulos, and Krishnan, 1993). The
right side of the model reﬂects the link between customer
participation and new product performance in terms of
sales volume. To complete the model, a set of control
variables is included.

The Impact of the Customer’s Use of Control on
Customer Participation

Ouchi (1979) notes that control mechanisms represent the
means to manage an organization and its projects to keep
the focus on and eventually achieve objectives. The wide-

spread proliferation of interorganizational partnerships
has prompted researchers to cross organizational bound-
aries and investigate the efﬁcacy of controls in various
collaborative relationships (e.g., Dekker, 2004; Vlaar
et al., 2006). Aulakh et al. (1996) thus argue that the
manufacturer’s use of control determines trust and per-
formance in distribution or licensing partnerships, and
Inkpen and Currall (2004) assert that controls convince
joint venture partners to act in a trustworthy manner.
Tiwana and Keil (2007) extend this line of research to
investigate how to facilitate the use of controls in out-
sourcing alliances. They ﬁnd that outsourcing ﬁrms
sometimes need specialized knowledge, beyond their
core domain, to govern outsourcing partnerships. The use
of controls does not appear, however, in research into
customer-involved CPD.

Customer participation in CPD is especially important
for manufacturers to get access to “sticky” market need-
related information that resides within the customer (Piller
and Walcher, 2006). Constant information sharing helps
manufacturers to ﬁnd out how customer needs evolve and
emerge during the development process (Fang et al.,
2008). The customer might, however, not be motivated to
share such information (Hoyer et al., 2010), even though
by doing so, the customer helps the manufacturer to better
understand customer needs and to quickly respond to
changes in the market. Often, the customer simply needs to
be convinced about the manufacturer’s ability to develop a
satisfying product against a fair price in a timely manner
(Das and Teng, 2001). This research posits that the cus-
tomer’s use of control should stimulate customer partici-
pation because the customer can, as such,
initiate a
regulatory process that helps ensure the manufacturer
attains desirable CPD goals (Das and Teng, 1998).

Two traditional categories of control mechanisms are
formal and informal control (Jaworski, 1988). Ouchi
(1979) deﬁnes formal control as the articulation of rules
for the collaboration to work; informal control entails the

persistent social
inﬂuence across team members that
leads to mutual understanding and commitment to joint
development goals. This
study focuses on formal
control—not because informal controls are less impor-
tant, but rather because customers can easily specify
formal controls, whereas informal, self-regulating con-
trols cannot be simply imposed.

Two forms of

formal control mechanisms exist:
process and output
(Ouchi, 1979). Process control
implies attempts to inﬂuence the means that lead to the
achievement of desirable results (Jaworski, 1988). With
process control, the customer prescribes a sequence of
steps for the development team to follow, subsequently
monitors the extent to which the team actually follows
established procedures, and ﬁnally evaluates the proce-
dures that have been used to accomplish a given task. The
customer can set the procedures in such a way that,
according to the customer, the probability of actually
achieving project goals is maximized. As such, process
control is expected to increase the customer’s willingness
to participate in the CPD project. Therefore, the follow-
ing hypothesis is suggested:

H1: Process control positively affects the customer’s
participation in CPD.

the development

Output control denotes that the customer focuses on
team achieves ultimately and
what
implies the speciﬁcation, monitoring, and evaluation of
clear, planned goals and objectives for the development
team (Jaworski, 1988). Output control sets directions for
task performance, clariﬁes expectations, and increases
goal correspondence (Das and Teng, 1998). By means of
output control, the customer can drive the development
team to develop a product compliant with requirements
and to ﬁnish the CPD project on time and within budget
(Rijsdijk and van den Ende, 2011). Output control is
therefore also expected to enhance customer participation
in CPD. Thus:

H2: Output control positively affects the customer’s par-
ticipation in CPD.

The Impact of Customer Participation on New
Product Performance

Customer participation has long been considered impor-
tant for successful product development (Carbonell,
Rodríguez-Escudero, and Pujari, 2009). First of all,
manufacturers are expected to beneﬁt from customer par-
ticipation in CPD because the product is more likely to
meet the customer’s needs or those of other customers
(Bogers et al., 2010). The rationale is that through cus-

tomer participation, the manufacturer can probe and learn
how the marketplace and customer needs emerge and
evolve during the development process, enabling the
manufacturer to appropriately adjust the new product
(Fang et al., 2008). As such, customer participation in
CPD also helps manufacturers to sustain the pace of
product development, which is essential for new product
success (Henard and Szymanski, 2001). Furthermore, the
customer’s active participation in the development
project is expected to strengthen the relationship between
the customer and manufacturer and, as such, to increase
the customer’s appreciation of the customized product
(Hoyer et al., 2010). Therefore:

H3: The customer’s participation in CPD positively
affects new product performance.

Methodology

Survey Study

Sample and data collection. The sampling frame con-
siders 128 international, customer-involved CPD projects
undertaken by the plastics manufacturing division of one
of the largest and most diversiﬁed industrial corporations
in the world. It worked, for instance, with car producers
to develop plastics with particular properties, which
could be applied to cars’ interiors; with a wet room solu-
tions company to develop high-quality PVC boards for
the sanitation industry; and with artiﬁcial grass system
manufacturers to develop optimal playing surfaces for
sports ﬁelds. Through such collaborations, the plastics
manufacturer hoped to deliver new or improved products
to participating customers.

This study focuses on a single manufacturer to elimi-
nate important confounding cross-industry and cross-ﬁrm
factors as possible explanations for differences in cus-
tomer participation in CPD (Naveh, 2007). Additionally,
studying projects of a single manufacturer helps to focus
on differences between the CPD projects that cause better
customer participation and reduces concerns about inter-
nal validity. While there is no doubt that the use of mul-
tiple manufacturers would enhance the external validity
of the ﬁndings, this study chooses to emphasize internal
validity over generalizability because it better challenges
the theory being tested.

The data have been collected from the manufacturer’s
side of the dyad because it is the manufacturer that ini-
tiates the development project and that lets the customer
exercise control and participate in the project. Thus, even
if the manufacturer and customer have different views
regarding the use of control and participation, it is the


1246

L. P. M. SMETS ET AL.

manufacturer’s view that is likely to be determinant. Next
to these substantive arguments, daunting practical and
methodological problems arise in collecting and analyz-
ing data collected from both the manufacturer’s and cus-
tomer’s side. Therefore, data have been collected from
the manufacturer only. In doing so, this study is not
unique as using data from one channel partner only is
well accepted in the NPD and marketing literatures
(Bonner, 2010; Carbonell et al., 2009; Lau, Tang, and
Yam, 2010). Although it is not possible to capture the
bilateral aspects of collaborations this way, it eliminates
potential confounding cross-customer factors as possible
explanations for differences in customers’ use of control
and their participation.

Product or technology managers of the CPD projects
serve as key respondents. Prior to the actual data collec-
tion, a pretest with three managers is conducted to ensure
the clarity and readability of the survey. Their feedback
prompted minor modiﬁcations to the questionnaire. Sub-
sequently, an introductory e-mail, containing a content
description and start date of the research and highlighting
the importance of their participation, is sent to the other
managers, followed by an e-mailed link to the online
survey. To increase response rates, the respondents who
had not yet completed the questionnaire were sent two
reminder e-mails with one week in between. Overall, 72
managers responded, though two indicated no customer
involvement in the project. For seven CPD projects, two
questionnaires were received in which case the responses
of the most experienced manager were used. Thus, the
effective response rate was 49.2% (63 of 128). To assess
potential respondent bias, a one-way multivariate analy-
sis of variance was conducted to determine if differences
in the respondents’ background characteristics (e.g.,
technologist, product manager) inﬂuenced the mean
responses. The analysis did not reveal any signiﬁcant
differences.

Measures. Except for new product performance, the
constructs are measured using multi-item scales, with
items obtained from previous research, modiﬁed to ﬁt
the context of this study if necessary. Unless mentioned
otherwise,
the survey questions used 7-point Likert-
type scales, ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree” to
7 = “strongly agree.” The

New product performance. To measure the success
that the new product achieved in the marketplace, in
terms of the new product’s cumulative sales volume, the
actual sales volume ﬁgures are extracted from the com-
pany’s database after which the values are standardized.

Customer participation. Deﬁned as the extent

to
which the customer is actively involved in the develop-
ment project, customer participation is measured using
seven items from Fang (2008) and one from Heide and
Miner (1992).

Formal controls. We measure two types of formal
control: process and output. Process control refers to the
extent to which the customer controlled the development
team by prescribing procedures and processes, measured
by combining three items from Tiwana and Keil (2007)
with two items from Jaworski et al. (1993). For output
control, four items are used from Tiwana and Keil (2007)
and one from Bonner et al. (2002). The respondents were
asked about the extent to which the customer controlled
the development team by specifying goals.

Additional variables. In testing the hypotheses, inter-
dependence and innovativeness are controlled for. Inter-
dependence is measured with a reverse-coded item that
asks how easily the manufacturer could switch to another
customer (Mohr and Spekman, 1994), which is controlled
for because interdependence likely affects a customer’s
motivation to participate in CPD projects. Innovativeness
denotes the extent to which the CPD project is new from
the market’s perspective, which is controlled for because
products that are new to the market affect new product
performance. On four items adapted from Danneels and
Kleinschmidt (2001), respondents indicated on a 7-point
Likert-type scale whether the new product’s market was
1 = “not new at all” to 7 = “totally new.”

Measure unidimensionality, reliability, and validity.
Exploratory factor analysis is used to conﬁrm the unidi-
mensionality of the measures, with an eigenvalue of 1.0
and factor loadings of .30 as threshold values (Steenkamp
and van Trijp, 1991). To examine the reliability and valid-
ity of the main constructs, this study used conﬁrmatory
factor analysis with LISREL. Absolute ﬁt indices tend to
underestimate ﬁt
for small samples (Bentler, 1990;
Gerbing and Anderson, 1992), whereas parsimonious and
incremental ﬁt indices take sample size into account;
therefore, the latter is used to assess model ﬁt. The results
in Appendix A indicate that the parsimonious ﬁt measure
falls well below the recommended threshold of 5.0
(Marsh and Hocevar, 1985), and the relative indices are
well above their threshold value of .90. For all measures,
the composite reliabilities exceed the .70 threshold for
acceptable reliability (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988), and the
average variance extracted (AVE) values exceed .50.
Convergent validity is indicated because all items load
signiﬁcantly on their respective construct (Bagozzi, Yi,

and Phillips, 1991). Discriminant validity is assessed
across the subscales by estimating two-factor ﬁrst-order
models for each possible pair of subscales twice: once
constraining the correlation between the latent variables
to unity and once freeing the parameter. In support of
discriminant validity, the chi-square of the unconstrained
model was in all cases signiﬁcantly lower than the chi-
square of the constrained model. Moreover, an examina-
tion of the 95% conﬁdence intervals around all pairwise
construct correlations also indicated discriminant validity
across the scale because none of the conﬁdence intervals
encompassed the value of 1.0 (Bagozzi et al., 1991).
Finally, the AVE for all pairs of constructs is greater than
the square of the correlation estimates between two con-
structs, also supporting discriminant validity (Fornell and
Larcker, 1981). This evidence of satisfactory psychomet-
ric properties allows averaging the responses to all
remaining items in each scale to form the constructs.

Common method bias. To minimize concerns about
remedial procedures
common method bias,
are
recommended by Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003). Before the data
collection, the pretest minimized item ambiguity and any
comprehension problems for the response process. To
further reduce the possibility of common method bias,
respondents’ anonymity is guaranteed, which should
reduce their evaluation apprehension and their tendency
to provide socially desirable answers or responses con-
sistent with how they think the researcher wants them to
respond. Additionally, Harman’s single-factor test
is
applied, which revealed more than one factor, with a total
variance extracted of 82.5%, and for which the largest
single factor explained only 45.8%. Finally, the customer
participation independent variable uses a subjective

measure, whereas the new product performance depen-
dent variable comes from the company’s database. Thus,
it is impossible for the respondent to bias the relationship
between these two variables, which eliminates possible
effects of consistency motives, social desirability tenden-
cies, or temporary mood states.

Results. The hypothesized relationships are tested in a
series of regression analyses. Table 2 contains the results
of the effect of formal control on customer participation
as well as those of the effect of customer participation on
new product performance.

According to Table 2, H1 and H2 are conﬁrmed
because both process control (b = .45, p < .01) and output
control (b = .34, p < .01) have signiﬁcant and positive
effects on customer participation. As expected, the manu-
facturer’s dependence on the customer is also signiﬁ-
cantly related to customer participation (b = -0.16,
p < .05). An a posteriori test, performed to explore the
interaction effect between the customer’s use of formal

more, Table 2 shows support for H3 since customer par-
ticipation is signiﬁcantly and positively related to new
product performance in terms of sales volume (b = .29,
p < .05). As expected, innovativeness also signiﬁcantly
and positively impacts the new product’s sales volume.

Experimental Study

The survey results are in line with the expectations and
ﬁndings of extant literature, though this study is the ﬁrst
to investigate and conﬁrm a relationship between the
customer’s use of formal control and the extent of its
participation in CPD. Nevertheless, the survey cannot
ﬁrmly establish relationship causality, so an additional,
experimental study is conducted to conﬁrm that the use of
formal control causes an increase in customer participa-
tion, not the other way around (Holland, 1986). Supple-
menting the survey data with experimental data enhances
conﬁdence in this study’s ﬁnding about the impact of the
customer’s use of formal control on customer participa-
tion in CPD and can conﬁrm the ﬁnding is not caused by
a methodological artifact (Jick, 1979). Moreover,
to
better capture the bilateral aspect of the collaboration,
albeit in two separate studies, experimental data are col-
lected from the customer’s perspective.

Subjects. The experiment considers 108 practitioners
from an innovation hotspot in the Netherlands, where
researchers, developers, and entrepreneurs work closely
together to develop new technologies and products. The
age of the subjects ranged from 23 to 63 years, with a
mean of 36.99 years. Seventy-ﬁve percent of the subjects
were male. Participation was voluntary.

Experimental design. The scenario experiment used a
2 ¥ 2 between-subject design with low or high levels of
formal control and interdependence. Accordingly, each
respondent evaluated one scenario with a low or high
formal control description and a low or high interdepen-
dence description. Besides formal control, this study
manipulates the customer’s interdependence because this
variable is expected to be one of the most important
aspects to inﬂuence the customer’s participation in the
CPD project. Figure 2 provides a more detailed descrip-
tion of the scenarios and manipulations.

Procedure. The experimenter carefully explained the
procedure to the respondents in person, and then ran-

domly assigned each participant to one of the four sce-
narios. In all scenarios, the respondents acted as a CPD
project manager of a car manufacturer (i.e., like the
typical customer in our survey-based study) that was col-
laborating in a development project initiated by one of its
plastics suppliers (i.e.,
like the manufacturer in our
survey-based study). The scenarios differed in the extent
of formal control and interdependence. As manipulation
checks, the respondents indicated their perceptions of
formal control and interdependence; they also chose an
extent to which they would collaborate in the plastic
supplier’s development project. During the experiment,
respondents were asked to work individually; if neces-
sary, they could ask the experimenter questions. Finally,
exit interviews with the respondents indicated that the
experiment was sufﬁciently clear.

Measures. All questions in the experiment used
7-point Likert-type scales, ranging from 1 = “strongly
disagree” to 7 = “strongly agree.”

Formal control. The perception of the respondents’
ability to formally control the CPD project was measured
by the extent to which the respondents agreed they could
control the development team by setting goals and speci-
fying procedures.

Customer participation. For this measure, the same
eight items as in the survey study are used: seven items
from Fang (2008) and one from Heide and Miner (1992)
(a = .75).

Interdependence. The level of the respondents’ per-
ception of the car manufacturer being dependent on the
supplier was measured with a reverse-coded item that
asks respondents to what extent they agreed the car
manufacturer could easily switch to another supplier
(Mohr and Spekman, 1994).

Manipulation check. The effects of the experimental
manipulations were investigated for each dependent vari-
able through a series of two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The 2 ¥ 2 ANOVA with formal control and
interdependence as independent variables and the per-
ceived formal control measure as the dependent variable
revealed a main effect for formal control (F = 90.51, d.f. =
1, p < .01). Speciﬁcally, participants in the high formal
control condition scored higher on the formal control
scale (M = 5.54, SD = 1.75) than participants in the low
formal control condition (M = 2.37, SD = 1.73). Neither
the other main effect nor the interaction effect reached
signiﬁcance. A similar ANOVA with interdependence

Figure 2. Customer Interdependence and Formal Control Manipulations

as the dependent measure revealed a main effect for inter-
dependence (F = 58.60, d.f. = 1, p < .01). Speciﬁcally,
participants in the high interdependence condition scored
higher on the interdependence scale (M = 5.85, SD =
1.53) than participants in the low interdependence condi-
tion (M = 3.35, SD = 1.87). Again, neither the other main
effect nor the interaction effect reached signiﬁcance.
These results indicate that the formal control and interde-
pendence manipulations were successful.

Results. To validate that customers with high formal
control indeed contribute more to the CPD project than
customers with low formal control, a 2 ¥ 2 ANOVA is
carried out again. Table 3 reports the means and SDs for
customer participation. The results from the ANOVA are
shown in Table 4 and indicate that
formal control
(F = 21.74, d.f. = 1, p < .01) signiﬁcantly and positively
affects customer participation. The means show that cus-
tomer participation is indeed higher in the high formal

control condition compared with the low formal control
condition, reafﬁrming our survey ﬁnding. As expected,
interdependence (F = 8.54, d.f. = 1, p < .01) also signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuences customer participation, as well as the
interaction between interdependence and formal control
(F = 5.60, d.f. = 1, p < .05). The results of simple contrast

tests show that the customer’s use of formal control is
especially important when the customer’s dependence is
low (b = 1.29, p < .01). When the customer’s dependence
on the manufacturer is high, the use of formal control
increases the customer’s participation to a lesser extent
(b = 0.42, p < .10). Altogether, these ﬁndings show that
the customer’s use of formal control is a key determinant
of the customer’s participation in CPD.

Discussion and Implications

Customer participation research spans a broad variety of
areas, including service provision (e.g., Blazevic and
Lievens, 2007), new service development (e.g., Carbonell
et al., 2009), and coproduction (e.g., Bendapudi and
Leone, 2003). In product development studies, customer
participation is also increasingly important (Hoyer et al.,
2010) because to keep pace with technological develop-
ments and market changes, industrial customers increas-
ingly demand customized products. Successful CPD
usually requires intensive customer–manufacturer inter-
actions to match the manufacturer’s capabilities with the
customer’s needs (Stump et al., 2002). Manufacturers are
therefore eager to ﬁnd ways to stimulate a customer’s
participation in CPD projects.

The survey and experimental results show that one
way to encourage active involvement is the customer’s
use of formal controls. By employing process and output
control, the customer comes to believe more in the pursuit
of CPD goals and successful product customization.
Moreover, by approving the use of these control mecha-
nisms, project managers demonstrate their trust in and
respect for the customer (Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard,
and Werner, 1998). Yet, such customer control also poses
challenges to product development managers because
they no longer control the project alone (Hoyer et al.,
2010). To encourage managers to share control with the
customer, Whitener et al. (1998) recommend establishing
a culture that rewards and supports managers’ efforts to

cede their control. Such a supportive culture exhibits a
friendly, warm, trusting, and open work environment,
toward which members perceive organizational commit-
ment rather than simply an exchange of work for payment
(Akaah, 1993).

In addition to the hypothesized effect of control, our
results reveal a main effect of interdependence on cus-
tomer participation. From the manufacturer’s perspec-
tive, the survey ﬁndings reveal that customers are more
willing to participate in CPD projects if the manufacturer
is less dependent on the customer to execute the devel-
opment project. The implication is that through active
participation customers can try to make it more difﬁcult
for the manufacturer to switch to a competing customer
during the development project (Kumar, Scheer, and
Steenkamp, 1995). As regards the customers’ perspec-
tive, our experimental results show that customer depen-
dence signiﬁcantly increases customers’ willingness to
actively participate in the development project. Together,
these survey and experimental ﬁndings imply that active
customer participation in CPD varies with the level of
asymmetric interdependence between the manufacturer
and customer (Kim and Hsieh, 2003), which sheds new
light on development partner selection decisions.

the value of

Finally, the survey results prove that active customer
participation improves new product sales. This ﬁnding
implies that increased access to market and customer
need-related information is critical for the manufacturer
to maximize
its own capabilities
(Atuahene-Gima and Ko, 2001). Moreover, the results
show that innovations that are new to the market also
positively inﬂuence new product sales, conﬁrming the
ﬁndings from Szymanski, Kroff, and Troy’s (2007) meta-
analysis on product innovativeness and new product per-
formance. Customer participation and new-to-the-market
innovations are negatively correlated though, implying
that manufacturers less often engage customers in the
development project of new-to-the-market innovations.
This is plausible because for this particular new product
type manufacturers might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to identify the

right customer to participate as the market is unfamiliar to
them.

Limitations and Further
Research Directions

The current study’s results must be interpreted with
several limitations in mind. First, the survey only consid-
ered CPD projects undertaken by one manufacturer,
which requires caution regarding the generalizability of
the ﬁndings. However, by doing so, confounding effects
could be ruled out, providing a better test of the proposed
theory. Still, the ﬁndings need additional testing, using
larger and independent samples. Second, the survey used
a single informant approach, which potentially allows for
common method variance, though no evidence is found
for it. Besides, accounting and experimental data are used
to minimize concerns about
impact of
common method bias and address the issue of causality
on two key relationships (Jick, 1979). Still, researchers
should attempt to collect objective measures of customer
participation (e.g., time and money spent) over time to
replicate the results. Third, this research uses two studies
to provide a two-sided view of controlling customer-
involving CPD. Therefore,
future research should
combine both the manufacturer’s and customer’s per-
spective in one and the same study.

the potential

In addition to the extensions to address the limitations
of this study, there are several avenues for research worth
mentioning. First, this study ﬁnds that the customer’s use
of controls increases its participation in CPD, without
distinguishing among different types of customers. Hoyer
et al. (2010) argue that innovators, lead users, emergent
consumers, and market mavens are especially able and
willing to collaborate in development projects. Is the use
of control mechanisms equally important for all custom-
ers participating in CPD? Second, formal controls might
vary in importance, depending on the scope of the col-
laboration. We measure customer participation intensity
from the start to the end of the development project, but
are early involved customers equally motivated to partici-
pate as customers involved only in later stages? Does
customer participation starting from, say, the commer-
cialization phase of the development process ask for
different integration methods? Third, further research
should examine whether the customer’s need to use
formal control declines over the course of the develop-
ment project. Inkpen and Currall (2004) mention that the
maturity of the partnership deﬁnes the balanced use of
controls by the customer. Some customers might prefer
different control mechanisms depending on their role in

the collaboration, whether providing information and
codeveloping (Fang, 2008) or testing ﬁnished products
and providing end-user product support
(Nambisan,
2002).
