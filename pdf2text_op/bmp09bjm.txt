In this paper, we investigate the determinants of corporate reputation, derived from the
assessments of managers and market analysts, of a sample of large UK ﬁrms. Along
with the inﬂuences of a variety of ﬁrm attributes, we ﬁnd a reputational eﬀect associated
with a female presence at board level. This eﬀect varies across sectors and demonstrates
the inﬂuence of a ﬁrm’s stakeholder environment in determining whether a female
presence on the board enhances or harms the reputation of the ﬁrm. The pattern that
emerges indicates that the presence of women on the board is favourably viewed in only
those sectors that operate close to ﬁnal consumers. We argue that the nature of this
eﬀect reﬂects an imperative for equality of representation that highlights the need to
reﬂect gender diversity among customers.

Introduction

Corporate reputation, deﬁned as ‘a perceptual
representation of a company’s past actions and
future prospects that describe the ﬁrm’s overall
appeal to all its key constituents when compared
to other leading rivals’ (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72),
has attracted a signiﬁcant amount of recent
attention in the academic literature (Gardberg
and Fombrun, 2002; Kitchen and Laurence,
2003; MacMillan, Money and Downing, 2002;
Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Sabate and Puente,
2003; Turban and Cable, 2003; Wiedmann,
2002). Signiﬁcant strands of this literature have
examined the meaning and measurement of
reputation (Fryxell and Wang, 1994; Gardberg
and Fombrun, 2002), its antecedents (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990), and its impact on other
aspects of companies such as their ability to
attract customers and good quality employees
(Milgrom and Roberts, 1986; Turban and Cable,
2003). An important contribution by Fryxell and
Wang (1994) highlighted that reputational indices
(such as the Fortune ranking) are most closely
related to a ﬁrm’s reputation as a ﬁnancial

investment (Fryxell and Wang, 1994), suggesting
a close link between external perceptions of the
overall eﬀectiveness of an organization and its
reputation.

Diversity within organizations, principally in
respect of gender, has also been the subject of
considerable recent
research with prominent
strands of research focusing on the challenges
involved in managing a diverse workforce
(Dass and Parker, 1999; Mollica and DeWitt,
1994), the impact of diversity on the performance
of teams and the individuals that compose them
(Bunderson and Sutcliﬀe, 2002; Harrison et al.,
2002; Jehn, Northcraft and Neale, 1999; Randel
and Jaussi, 2003), and the link between diversity
and organizational survival and performance
(Filatotchev and Toms, 2003). Of particular
interest here is the strand in the literature that
focuses upon the diversity of corporate boards of
directors (Bilimoria, 2000; Bilimoria and Piderit,
1994; Carter, Simkins and Simpson, 2003; Singh,
Vinnicombe and Johnson, 2001). This work
has illuminated the typically very low levels of
diversity present in corporate boards, which, it is
argued, represent both a breakdown of corporate
governance and a missed opportunity.

Board diversity has been deﬁned in a variety of
ways. As van der Walt and Ingley (2003) argue,
‘the concept of diversity relates to board compo-
sition and the varied combination of attributes,
characteristics and expertise
contributed by
individual board members’ (p. 219). Within this
deﬁnition, a primary distinction has been made
between demographic
(i.e. observable) and
cognitive
(i.e. unobservable) dimensions of
diversity (e.g. Maznevski, 1994; Milliken and
Martins, 1996), with much of
the existing
empirical work focusing upon demographic
aspects of diversity such as gender, age and
ethnicity (e.g. Conyon and Mallin, 1997; Daily
and Dalton, 2003; Singh, Vinnicombe and
Johnson, 2001). Earlier
in the area
of demographic diversity have raised awareness
of the relative homogeneity of corporate boards
of directors, highlighted the variation across
countries in board diversity, and mapped its
evolving pattern (Catalyst, 2003; Conyon and
Mallin, 1997; Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999;
Vinnicombe and Singh, 2003).

studies

It has been asserted for some time that board
diversity may have signiﬁcant payoﬀs in terms
of
improved board, and thereby corporate,
eﬀectiveness (Van den Berghe and Levrau, 2004;
Vinnicombe and Singh, 2003; van der Walt and
Ingley, 2003), but
there have been very few
systematic attempts to evaluate this view empiri-
cally. This study contributes to the literature by
examining the link between corporate reputation
and the
gender diversity of main boards
of directors. Board diversity may be expected to
improve perceptions of corporate eﬀectiveness
because it is a signal of good corporate governance
(Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Luoma and
Goodstein, 1999; Mattis, 2000; van der Walt and
Ingley, 2003),1 because diversity brings valuable
resources into the boardroom (Burke, 1997, 2000;
Carver, 2002; Cassell, 2000; Conyon and Mallin,
1997), or because diversity can signal a sensitivity of

the organization to the needs and requirements of
particular stakeholder constituencies2 (Bilimoria
and Wheeler, 2000; Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999).
This paper analyses the relationship between
corporate reputation and female presence at board
level for a sample of UK companies. We analyse
reputational data constructed in a similar manner to
the Fortune index (which has often been employed
in US studies of corporate reputation), and make
two main contributions to the literature. First, we
present the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the relation-
ship between corporate reputation and female
representation on corporate boards of directors.
Our analysis permits any reputational eﬀect to vary
across industries. Through this, our study provides
a means of inspecting how female directors are
viewed from outside their organizations. In so
doing, our analysis informs the debate concerning
the demographic asymmetry between corporate
boards and the societies in which they operate.
Second, we conduct one of only very few studies of
the antecedents of corporate reputation drawing on
a multivariate data set that describes the ﬁnancial
performance, social performance, size, R&D and
advertising intensity, and industry of
sample
companies. Our analysis casts light on the drivers
of corporate reputations and, through this, on the
meaning and interpretation of reputational indices.
In the next section, we introduce a conceptual
model of the link between female presence at
board level and corporate reputation and intro-
duce our hypotheses. The following section
describes the data; then the results are reported,
and a ﬁnal
some concluding
remarks and suggestions for practice.

1The recent Higgs Review of the role and eﬀectiveness of
non-executive directorships highlighted that ‘the current
population of non-executive directors
is narrowly
drawn’ (Higgs, 2003, p.13) being mostly ‘white males
nearing retirement age with previous PLC director
experience’ (p. 42). Furthermore, the Review argued
that ‘a commitment to equal opportunities which can be
of motivational as well as reputational importance is
inevitably undermined if the board itself does not follow
the same guiding principles’ (p. 42).

2For example, some institutional investors have begun
to implement diversity screens as part of their invest-
ment practices and a commitment
to diversity in
employment practices is part of the inclusion criteria
for many socially responsible investment indices (e.g.
FTSE4Good). TIA-CREFF, a large American institu-
tional
investor, requires that boards of directors are
composed of ‘qualiﬁed individuals that reﬂect diversity
of experience, gender, race, and age’ (TIA-CREFF,
1997).

number of hypotheses. Our starting point
is
Fombrun and Shanley’s seminal model which
hypothesizes that corporate reputations ‘repre-
sent publics’ cumulative judgements of ﬁrms over
time’, which, in turn, hinge on ﬁrms’ ‘relative
success in fulﬁlling the expectations of multiple
stakeholders’
(Fombrun and Shanley, 1990,
p. 235). A ﬁrm’s current reputation is determined
by the signals that publics receive concerning its
behaviours, whether directly from the ﬁrm or via
other information channels, such as the media or
the stock market. Stakeholders are expected
to have diverse preferences over a ﬁrm’s
actions, process and outcomes, and reputational
assessments
congruence
between the apparent behaviours of the ﬁrm
and the preferences of those publics (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990).

As has been highlighted, this perspective on
reputation generation implies that a given repu-
tational entity (e.g. ﬁrm,
individual, brand or
product)
is likely to have numerous distinct
reputations each of which applies to a particular
from
attribute of
the perceptions of a particular
stakeholder
group (Bromley, 2002; Fryxell and Wang, 1994;
Gardberg and Fombrun, 2002). For example, a
company might simultaneously have a reputation
among actual and potential employees as a
provider of an excellent working environment, a
reputation among investors as a sound invest-
ment, and a reputation among consumers as the
maker of reliable products. Signiﬁcantly, there is
no guarantee that
reputations
are all positive or all negative and hence that,
when combined,
they add up to a useful
‘meta-reputation’
(Bromley, 2002). Therefore,
when exploring the inﬂuences on corporate
reputation,
it is important to be clear about
the content of the particular reputation being
studied and the constituency within which that
reputation is held.

Given the need to contextualize the concept of
reputation under study, we note that the concept
of reputation being studied here is derived from
the perceptions of
in peer
organizations and ﬁnancial analysts. As earlier
research has highlighted,
this method, while
broadly used, generates a measure of reputation
that most closely reﬂects the reputation of an
organization’s

earlier
research, we also acknowledge the importance
of a range of control variables
in shaping
reputational assessments. We will ﬁrst discuss
the link between board diversity and reputation
before discussing these control variables.

The link between corporate reputation and female
presence at board level

Reﬂecting our earlier discussion concerning the
nature of corporate reputation, we now turn to the
relationship between board diversity and reputa-
tion thus deﬁned. Speciﬁcally, we focus upon the
role that
female representation on corporate
boards might be expected to play in shaping
corporate reputations because of a capacity to
inﬂuence perceptions of corporate eﬀectiveness.3
Female directors may inﬂuence the perceptions of
external agents that a board will function more
eﬀectively either because of an expectation that the
presence of female directors will improve board
processes or because
female directors bring
important skills, knowledge and competencies to
the boardroom. In particular, the presence of a
female director may help the organization manage
its relationships with key stakeholder groups such
as employees and customers (Burke, 1997; Carver,
2002; Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999; Singh and
Vinnicombe, 2004).

Board diversity may contribute positively to a
ﬁrm’s reputation because of the perception that
female directors bring distinctive and valuable
resources that enhance board decision-making. If

3Given that a corporation has multiple reputations, it
might also be the case that board diversity plays a role in
shaping aspects of corporate reputation other than that
associated with corporate eﬀectiveness. For example, the
board diversity literature acknowledges that board
diversity can improve the moral reputation of the ﬁrm
because particular stakeholders hold the view that
diversity is ethically good. It may be considered wrong
for individuals to be excluded from the highest echelons
of the business world purely on the grounds of gender
and regardless of ability and one might adhere to an
imperative to enfranchise those constituencies histori-
cally excluded from positions of economic power
(Carver, 2002; Garratt, 1997; Keasey, Thompson and
Wright, 1997). While the drivers of the moral reputation
of corporations are worthy of investigation, this line of
enquiry lies outside the scope of the present analysis.

a variety of valuable abilities are not evenly
distributed across demographic groups, a ﬁrm
that discriminates would forgo access to some
range of these potential resources were they to
exclude certain groups from key decision-making
roles (Westphal and Milton, 2000). This suggests
that there would be signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts
to organizations who select their boards from the
complete pool of available talent rather than
discriminating against particular demographic
characteristics when selecting suitable candidates
(Burke, 1997; Carver, 2002; Cassell, 2000).

there is

It has been suggested that increased diversity
may lead to improvements in workforce motiva-
tion and loyalty (Powell, 1999), and the role of
female directors as providers of much-needed
mentoring for more junior, ambitious female
colleagues has often been cited as a spur for
women to endeavour to reach their career goals
within the ﬁrm (Burgess and Tharenou, 2002;
Catalyst, 1995). Furthermore,
some
evidence that women board members often play
a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing the way in which
products are tailored to the needs of women
(Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999). Singh and
Vinnicombe (2004) observed that a particular
female director felt she had been appointed
because
the
corporate culture to be more customer-oriented,
and had identiﬁed a gap in the board competence
proﬁle’ (p. 484), suggesting that female directors,
and the companies they are appointed by, feel
that diversity arises where it coincides with the
presence of particular skill proﬁles.

‘the board wanted to change

Turning to the inﬂuence of diversity on board
process,
it has been suggested that a female
presence enhances the independence of the board
from top management (Fondas and Sassalos, 2000;
Selby, 2000; van der Walt and Ingley, 2003).
Agency theory has established the importance for
good corporate governance of a board that is not
beholden to those in senior managerial positions
(Fama and Jensen, 1983). In spite of the recogni-
tion that diversity may introduce some practical
problems with board functioning (Erhardt, Werbel
and Shrader, 2003; Knight et al., 1999), it has been
argued that diversity in terms of gender, culture
and education among directors, and non-executive
directors
fosters board
independence and may therefore be perceived
positively by external agents. Selby (2000) makes
this point when noting that ‘directors with diverse

skills, experiences and backgrounds are more likely
to raise questions that add to, rather than simply
echo, the voice of management’ (p. 239). Increased
director independence and improved monitoring
may also lead to ‘enhanced creativity, group
ﬂexibility, and deeper
furthermore,
improved diversity is expected to ‘discourage
groupthink and create an additional
check
on management prerogative’
(Ramirez, 2003,
pp. 848–849). Nicholson and Kiel (2004) argue
that board independence and eﬀectiveness in
carrying out its duties are related to the balance
intellectual capital. A board’s
of a board’s
intellectual capital,
is inﬂuenced by its
human, structural, cultural and social capital
(Nicholson and Kiel, 2004). Diversity may be
expected to play a signiﬁcant role in improving a
board’s human, cultural and social capital, and
thereby play an important role in shaping the
ability of a board to perform its functions.

in turn,

These preceding arguments suggest that board
diversity will contribute to external perceptions of
organizational eﬀectiveness, and we hypothesize:

H1: A female presence at board level improves
reputation.

The industry contexts within which ﬁrms operate
vary in numerous respects, including the compo-
sition and character of their stakeholder consti-
tuencies (Burke, 1997; Pfeﬀer and Salancik, 1978;
Rowley and Berman, 2000). Above, we argued
that the contributions female directors make, by
providing distinctive resources and inﬂuencing
board processes, aﬀect the perceptions of external
agents concerning corporate eﬀectiveness. Here,
we argue that
industry context mediates the
relationship between board diversity and corpo-
rate reputation. Earlier, we argued that female
directors might play an important role in enhan-
cing corporate eﬀectiveness by inspiring, moti-
vating and mentoring female employees (Burgess
and Tharenou, 2002; Catalyst, 1995; Powell,
1999). In this connection, we note that
the
the workforce varies system-
composition of
atically across industries. Therefore, one would
expect the strength of this argument to vary
across industries, applying most strongly to those
industries with the highest proportion of female
employees. Evidence of
such cross-industry
variation is presented in Table 1, which
was
extracted from the British Workplace
Employment Relations Survey 2004. The highest

proportions of women are found in ﬁnancial
services, hotels and restaurants, wholesale and
retail and other business services.

Similarly, we suggested that female directors
bring enhanced reputation because they promote
greater responsiveness to the needs of female
customers (Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999; Singh
and Vinnicombe, 2004). Hence, reﬂecting the fact
that the composition of customer constituencies
varies across industries, the strength of the in-
ﬂuence of female board representation on reputa-
tion may also vary across industries. Industries that
predominantly serve ﬁnal consumers, rather than
business customers, tend to serve relatively high
proportions of females. Such a proximity to ﬁnal
consumers, and/or

services (e.g.
logistics and information manage-
ment), construction and engineering, the isolation
from ﬁnal consumers, and the male-dominated
workforces found in these activities, conspire to
make female consumers relatively unimportant.
Reﬂecting these discussions, we hypothesize
cross-sectoral variation in the relationship between

level and reputation, it is important to recognize
that reputation is determined by many factors
and to control for these factors accordingly.
Drawing
framework
outlined previously, and the ﬁndings of previous
empirical studies, we will consider a range of
ﬁrm attributes including measures of ﬁnancial
performance, ﬁrm size, media visibility, R&D
and advertising intensity, risk, social perfor-
mance and the composition of ownership (Fom-
brun, 1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell
and Wang, 1994). Also,
it may be that, even
controlling for these ﬁrm attributes, reputation
varies systematically across sectors. That is, simply
as a result of being active in a particular sector, a
ﬁrm may be predisposed to a better or worse
reputation than ﬁrms primarily associated with
other sectors.

As we wish to identify the particular reputa-
tional eﬀect of one characteristic of corporate
boards – female presence – we must control for
any other characteristics that may impact on
reputation and be correlated with the presence of
female directors. To this end, the two controls we
include are measures of board size and board
composition (the balance of
executive and
non-executive directors). Both of these factors
may inﬂuence reputational assessments, as they
may reﬂect respectively the resources available to,
and the independence of, boards. Also, given the
association between the addition of women
to boards and board growth, and the fact
that women have been disproportionately accom-
modated in non-executive roles,
it is expected
that both are correlated with the presence of
female directors – as is found to be the case for
our data (see Table 2).

Data

Our sample consists of 199 UK PLCs chosen
largely according to the availability of reputation
data (see below4). Therefore, this sample, while
drawn from a wide range of industrial sectors, is
not randomly selected. Instead, there is a focus
upon the largest ﬁrms within each industrial

4We have reputation data for 240 ﬁrms. However,
restricted availability of other data (principally regard-
ing institutional ownership) necessitated the exclusion of
41 of these ﬁrms from the sample.

Corporate Reputation and Women on the Board

sector,
including about 90% of FTSE 100
companies. Nevertheless, there is considerable
variation in reputational scores both within and
between industrial sectors.

Corporate reputation

and Wang,

1990; Fryxell

To measure corporate reputation we utilize the
‘Britain’s most admired companies’ survey from
Management Today, 2002, which employs a
similar methodology to that used to construct
the Fortune index, a commonly used measure of
the reputations of US ﬁrms (e.g. Fombrun and
Shanley,
1994;
McGuire, Sundgren and Schneeweiss, 1988).
The chairmen, managing directors and selected
main board directors of the ten largest companies
in 24 industrial sectors were surveyed, as were
analysts at a selection of
leading investment
companies. Participants were asked to rate each
company in their sector (excluding their own
company) on a scale of zero (poor)
to ten
(excellent) for their performance in nine criteria:
quality of management; ﬁnancial
soundness;
ability to attract, develop and retain top talent;
quality of products/services; value as a long-term
investment; capacity to innovate; quality of
marketing; community and environmental re-
sponsibility; use of corporate assets. The assess-
ments received for each ﬁrm were averaged across
criteria and respondents to produce a single
reputational score.

Female presence at board level

Our data set identiﬁes all directors on the main
boards of the sample companies. The data set
describes the gender of each director. For each
ﬁrm,
the board under consideration is that
referred to as current in the 2002 Annual Report,
which provides a full list of directors’ names. The
genders of almost all directors were clearly
signalled by their names and titles. For those
remaining, the matter was clariﬁed by the use of
gender-speciﬁc language in a biography given in
the Annual Report (he, she, his, her etc.), by a
photograph given in the Annual Report, by
Internet materials (mainly news articles and the
websites of
foreign companies), or by cross-
referencing across companies within our data set.

r 2008 British Academy of Management.

For use in our regression analysis, we extract our
measure of female presence on the board. We
capture board diversity through a dichotomous
variable that records whether a ﬁrm has at least
one female director (1 if they do; 0 if they do not).
Clearly, this variable focuses on capturing diversity
as reﬂected in the presence/absence of women on
corporate boards rather than reﬂecting the depth
of
female board representation (as, perhaps,
reﬂected in the percentage of a ﬁrm’s directorships
held by women), or the extent of female repre-
sentation on boards (as, perhaps, reﬂected in the
total number of women on a ﬁrm’s board). In part,
our decision to focus on a dichotomous treatment
of board gender diversity stems from the observed
pattern in female representation in our data. Of the
199 companies in our database, only 14% have
more than one female director. This suggests that,
in fact, female representation on corporate boards
is typiﬁed by the presence of a single female
director and, in that sense, our measure captures
an important dimension of board diversity. Never-
theless,
reﬂecting the presence of alternative
measures in the existing literature, we report
robustness checks in our analysis below. From
this database we also extract the two control
variables: board size (the total number of directors
on a ﬁrm’s board) and board composition (the
proportion of directors on a ﬁrm’s board that are
non-executive).

Control variables

A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (the natural
logarithm of the value of total assets), principal
business activity (approximately equivalent to the
three-digit NACE industry), ﬁrm proﬁtability
(measured by the ratio of pre-tax proﬁts to total
assets), R&D intensity (the ratio of R&D
expenditures
to total assets) and corporate
leverage (measured by the ratio of total debt to
total assets) were extracted from accounting data,
courtesy of DataStream. Using the DataStream
industry classiﬁcation, we allocated each ﬁrm to
one of
seven sectors: construction, consumer
manufacturing, consumer services, energy, ﬁnance,
producer manufacturing, producer services. Data
concerning the market performance of sample
companies were obtained from Barra Inc., a
leading risk specialist. We employ a b measure of
the risks associated with stock ownership that

gauges the expected response of a stock to the
overall market.5

As there is no statutory obligation to disclose such
expenditures, ﬁrm-level advertising data are diﬃcult
to obtain for UK ﬁrms. However, media research
agencies monitor the incidence of advertisements at
the brand level throughout the main advertising
media (TV, newspapers, magazines, radio, posters
etc.) and estimate the levels of expenditure incurred.
We construct a dummy variable on the basis of
identiﬁcation, by Marketing magazine in 2002, of a
ﬁrm as one of the ‘Top 100 Advertisers’ or as an
owner of one of the ‘Biggest Brands’ in the UK.
Given that the levels of expenditure on advertising
tail oﬀ dramatically at the foot of these rankings we
are conﬁdent that our methodology allows us to
capture the vast majority of the ﬁrms for which
advertising is a key competitive tool.

Our measure of media visibility was obtained
from the Factiva database, which provides search-
able archives of news content from over 8000
global sources. We gathered data for each of the
calendar years 1998–2002 inclusive, and employed
as our measure the natural logarithm of the average
number of annual news hits. Ownership data were
drawn in June 2002 from a share ownership
analysis database of more than 2000 listed UK
ﬁrms managed by one of the UK’s largest company
registrars. Derived from records of share trading on
the London Stock Exchange, the database disag-
gregates share ownership according to 32 diﬀerent
types of beneﬁcial owner. Following Ryan and
Schneider
(2002) and Johnson and Greening
(1999), we employ a variable that equals the sum
of the proportions of ﬁrm equity held by long-term
institutional
i.e. pension funds,
insurance companies and life assurors.

the
explanatory variables described in the previous
section. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics and
a correlation matrix for key variables.6 Table 3
presents our
regression analysis. Model 1
provides a point of departure with the existing
literature by examining a set of explanatory
variables that overlaps considerably with those
employed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990).
Consistent with Fombrun and Shanley’s results,
we ﬁnd that ﬁrm reputation is positively asso-
ciated with media exposure (p 5 0.073),
the
degree of
long-term institutional ownership
(p 5 0.003) and social performance (p 5 0.073),
and negatively associated with market
risk
(p 5 0.005). Most importantly, Model 1 shows
that the presence of a female director on a ﬁrm’s
board has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on corporate
reputations.7

Models 2 and 3 extend the analysis by allowing
the reputational eﬀect of a female board presence
to vary systematically across sectors through the
inclusion of
interaction eﬀects between the
presence of a female director and the sectoral
dummies,
thereby permitting any. Model 2
presents the results of the interactions expressed
relative to a comparator sector (producer ser-
vices), while Model 3 presents the interactions
relative to all other sectors in order to avoid the

6Diagnostic testing provides evidence of heteroscedasti-
city in one of the regressions presented. In light of this,
we employ White’s method to correct
for bias in
statistical inference. Although White’s method corrects
the bias in standard errors,
it does not correct the
ineﬃciency of the estimators. It would therefore be
better to identify the sources of the heteroscedasticity
and then use either weighted least squares or maximum
likelihood estimation to obtain more eﬃcient estimates.
Unfortunately, we could make no such identiﬁcation.
7As discussed above, there are several ways of measuring
board diversity. We conducted ancillary regressions to
evaluate the robustness of our results to alternative
measures of board diversity. Broadly, the results are
comparable in that both alternative measures (the
number and the percentage of women on a ﬁrm’s board)
are uncorrelated with a ﬁrm’s reputation except in
particular sectors associated with a consumer orienta-
tion. The explanatory power of the models we report in
Table 3 is better than those found in the ancillary
regressions and the pattern of signiﬁcance somewhat
starker, suggesting that reputational assessors attach
greater importance to the presence of a female director,
rather than the number or percentage of female directors
on a board.

arbitrary choice of a comparator sector. The
results demonstrate that the reputational eﬀect of
a female presence on the board is subject to
signiﬁcant cross-sector variation. The ﬁndings
indicate that in two sectors, consumer services
and producer services,

least one female director is positive in consumer
services (p 5 0.032) and negative in producer
services (p 5 0.044).

signiﬁcantly inﬂuences

Taking these models together, we can draw
some conclusions about the suitability of each
speciﬁcation with respect to hypothesis testing.
That signiﬁcant coeﬃcients are associated with a
number of the industry eﬀects and interaction
variables in Models 2 and 3 suggests, consistent
with earlier observations, that it is important to

control
for industry in studies of corporate
reputation, particularly when measures of
reputation are industry-speciﬁc in the sense that
respondents are asked to rate ﬁrms relative to
industry peers (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990) and
that the reputational impact of a female board
presence is contingent upon a ﬁrm’s industry
environment. Therefore, of all the models, Model
3 is the most suitable speciﬁcation and it is this
model that we use to test our hypotheses.

Model 3 provides evidence in support of
Hypothesis 2 (that the relationship between female
presence at board level and reputation varies
across sectors). However, the evidence relating to
Hypothesis 1 is mixed in that there is a positive
reputational eﬀect of a female presence at board
level in only the consumer services sector. We ﬁnd
evidence of a negative reputational eﬀect for female

directors in the producer services sector, and no
signiﬁcant reputational eﬀect in all other industries.
It is worth reﬂecting upon how these ﬁndings
relate to our previous discussion concerning the
potential roles played by proximity to ﬁnal con-
sumers and the gender composition of the workforce
(as reﬂected in Hypothesis 2). It is straightforward to
align the consumer services sectors with a proximity
to ﬁnal consumers. Other sectors, such as ﬁnance
and energy, that serve ﬁnal consumers in fact do so
to a rather limited extent relative to the scale of their
overall operations, which in the case of ﬁnance is
dominated by transactions with corporations and
between traders of various descriptions. To char-
acterize our sectors regarding the gender composi-
tion of the workforce, we will apply a concordance
between these seven sectors and those reported in the
British Workplace Employment Relations Survey
2004 (see Table 1). By doing so, the consumer
services (corresponding to retail, hotels and restau-
rants), producer services (corresponding to whole-
sale and other business
services) and ﬁnance
(corresponding to ﬁnancial services) sectors emerge
as those to be associated with a relatively great
presence of women among the workforce. There-
fore, our ﬁndings suggest that the reputational
payoﬀs from a female presence at board level reside
in those sectors that operate close to ﬁnal consumers,
and are not contingent upon the gender composition
of the workforce. This is evidenced by the lack of
any positive reputational eﬀects associated with
female directors in ﬁnance and producer services.

Concerning the other inﬂuence on corporate
reputation, there is good evidence in support of
positive eﬀects on reputation for ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (p 5 0.059) and long-term institutional own-
ership (p 5 0.004) and a negative eﬀect for market
risk (p 5 0.009). There is also strong evidence that
reputation varies systematically across sectors. The
greatest predisposition to a good reputation lies in
producer services; the greatest predisposition to a
bad reputation resides in the energy and ﬁnance
sectors. Regarding board characteristics, we ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant positive reputational eﬀect associated
with board size (p 5 0.042), but none associated
with board composition.

Conclusion

assessments of managers and market analysts,
of a sample of large UK ﬁrms. Along with the
inﬂuences of a variety of ﬁrm attributes, we ﬁnd a
reputational eﬀect associated with a female
presence at board level. This
eﬀect varies
signiﬁcantly across sectors. The pattern that
emerges indicates that the presence of women
on the board is favourably viewed in only those
sectors that operate close to ﬁnal consumers. We
argue that the nature of this eﬀect reﬂects an
imperative for equality of representation that
highlights the need to reﬂect gender diversity
among customers.

and Downing,

Much of the literature regarding corporate
reputation has centred on empirical study of US
ﬁrms. Our analysis contributes to the small, but
growing, body of work focused upon other
countries (e.g. Kitchen and Laurence, 2003;
MacMillan, Money
2002;
Wiedmann, 2002) and oﬀers an opportunity to
examine the international
robustness of US
ﬁndings. Broadly, our results are consistent with
earlier work in that we ﬁnd reputation to be
aﬀected by a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance, market
risk, the extent of long-term institutional owner-
ship, and the nature of its business activities.
These results suggest that the determinants of
reputation, derived from the assessments of
managers and market analysts, are relatively
robust across countries.

consumers,

Our study shows that the presence of a female

is viewed
positively in industry sectors that are highly
proximate
suggesting
that reputational assessors perceive that female
directors may contribute important resources
that make boards so composed more eﬀective in
such circumstances. Given that this is only one of
several ways in which earlier research has high-
lighted that
female directors might provide
boards with important resources and that we
ﬁnd no evidence in favour of other motives, our
evidence suggests
reputational assessors
adopt a relatively narrow view of the relevant
contributions of women to corporate boards.
Speciﬁcally, the roles of women in enhancing
board independence or as mentors of other
women within organizations do not appear
to be widely recognized among reputational
assessors.

cross-sectional in nature and future attempts to
examine the patterns we have identiﬁed within a
longitudinal
framework would both help to
resolve remaining issues concerning causality
and shed more light on the manner in which the
perception of female directors is evolving across
time, along with incremental increases in their
prevalence and shifts in the perceived norms
regarding female roles within society. Second,
our study, in common with much of the empirical
work in the area conducted in the UK, would
beneﬁt from an improved availability of data,
particularly regarding corporate reputation. We
would welcome time-series reputational data for
a consistent and large sample of companies,
derived from alternative methodologies, such as
those proposed by Gardberg and Fombrun
(2002).
