This paper extends prior supply chain research by building and empirically testing a theoretical model of
the contingency effects of environmental uncertainty (EU) on the relationships between three dimensions
of supply chain integration and four dimensions of operational performance. Based on the contingency
and organizational information processing theories, we argue that under a high EU, the associations
between supplier/customer integration, and delivery and ﬂexibility performance, and those between
internal integration, and product quality and production cost, will be strengthened. These theoretical
propositions are largely conﬁrmed by multi-group and structural path analyses of survey responses col-
lected from 151 of Thailand’s automotive manufacturing plants. This paper contributes to operations
management contingency research and provides theory-driven and empirically proven explanations for
managers to differentiate the effects of internal and external integration efforts under different environ-
mental conditions.

1. Introduction

Growing evidence suggests that supply chain integration (SCI)
has a positive impact on operational performance outcomes, such
as delivery, quality, ﬂexibility and cost (Rosenzweig et al., 2003;
Dröge et al., 2004; Devaraj et al., 2007; Swink et al., 2007; Flynn
et al., 2010). Sousa and Voss (2008) suggested that when the value
of a best practice, such as SCI, is supported by empirical evidence,
research should shift from the justiﬁcation of its value to the under-
standing of the contextual conditions under which it is effective.
Among other factors, environmental uncertainty (EU) has been
identiﬁed as a contextual factor which may affect the effectiveness
of a best practice (Thompson, 1967; Venkatraman, 1989; Souder
et al., 1998).

Some recent studies argue that SCI–performance relationships
are moderated by EU (O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002; Fynes et al.,
2004; Koufteros et al., 2005). However, these studies are prob-
lematic in three areas. First, the use of different approaches in
conceptualizing SCI, performance and EU constructs disallows a
meaningful comparison of, or conclusion about, the contingency

effects of EU. Second, the evidence reported so far indicates that
SCI–performance relationships are not always moderated by EU
(Fynes et al., 2004; Koufteros et al., 2005), and even if moderating
effects exist, their direction varies (O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002).
For example, Koufteros et al. (2005) found insigniﬁcant moderating
effects of EU on the relationships between supplier/customer inte-
gration and quality/product innovation. O’Leary-Kelly and Flores
(2002) found positive relationships between marketing/sales plan-
ning decision integration and ﬁrm performance under a high, but
not a low EU. However, their results surprisingly indicated that the
relationships between manufacturing planning decision integra-
tion and ﬁrm performance are positive under a low, instead of a high
EU. Anchored in the premise that EU creates the need for SCI, some
studies argue that SCI–performance relationships will become sig-
niﬁcant or stronger under a high EU. Such a “theory” cannot explain
the above mixed ﬁndings. The lack of a theoretical explanation is
the third, and perhaps the most pressing issue that deserves more
research attention.

This paper builds and empirically tests a theoretical model to
explain the contingency effects of EU on the salient operational
performance outcomes of SCI. This paper differs from others in
a number of aspects. We conceptualize both SCI and operational
performance as multidimensional constructs, instead of the uni-
dimensional approach applied by others (e.g., Stank et al., 1999;
Rosenzweig et al., 2003). We have collapsed SCI into three dimen-
sions – internal, supplier, and customer integration – to enable the
examination of the performance impacts of different SCI dimen-

sions and to prove that each SCI dimension might be effective under
different environmental conditions (Wong and Boon-itt, 2008).
Furthermore, we examine four areas of operational performance
– delivery, production cost, product quality, and production ﬂex-
ibility – which reﬂect the four key capabilities of a focal ﬁrm in
responding to competition (Schmenner and Swink, 1998). The con-
sideration of multiple performance dimensions not only helps to
explain the mixed ﬁndings in the literature, but also addresses the
need to obtain a holistic understanding of the relationships among
contingencies (in this case, EU), response alternatives (different
dimensions of SCI) and multiple performance criteria (Sousa and
Voss, 2008).

Most importantly, we have integrated the contingency theory
(CT) and organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to
explain the contingency effects of EU. CT posits that ﬁrm per-
formance is dependent on the “ﬁt” between the structure and
processes of a ﬁrm, and the environment (Lawrence and Lorsch,
1967; Thompson, 1967; Miller, 1987). Based on CT, external inte-
gration is expected to “ﬁt” with a high EU (Thompson, 1967). The
OIPT further provides the conceptual foundation upon which such a
“ﬁt” is valuable for ﬁrms to achieve a certain performance. The OIPT
suggests the need to improve information processing capability and
information quality under high uncertainty (Galbraith, 1973). The
OIPT also recognizes that, as an open social–economical system,
a ﬁrm performs business processes within and beyond organiza-
tional boundaries (Thompson, 1967), which suggests the need to
distinguish internal from external integration. Based on the OIPT,
we expect that ﬁrms need external integration to improve infor-
mation processing capability, especially to cope with a high EU.
Speciﬁcally, we argue that delivery and production ﬂexibility are
highly sensitive to uncertainty from the external environment and
therefore, can be improved by external integration, but not internal
integration, under a high EU. On the other hand, product quality and
production cost are more internally dependent (Ragatz et al., 2002)
and therefore, unlike external integration (Dröge et al., 2004), the
impacts of internal integration on product quality and production
cost will be strengthened under a high EU. Based on a survey of
Thailand’s automotive supply chains, our ﬁndings largely support
our contingency arguments.

The novel theories and results of this paper offer numerous
implications to the operations and supply chain management
research on SCI. First, this paper supplements previous studies by
providing theories and supporting evidence to explain why the per-
formance impacts of some SCI dimensions could be strengthened
or weakened, and thus, contributes to operations management
contingency research (Sousa and Voss, 2008). This novel under-
standing is very important for both researchers and managers.
Such an explanation of the contingency effects of EU not only
clariﬁes the tenuous relationships between SCI, operational perfor-
mance and EU (Stonebraker and Liao, 2006), but also contributes
to the building of a contingency theory for SCI. Furthermore, this
paper provides theory-driven and empirically proven explanations
for managers to differentiate the effects of internal and external
integration efforts on various operational performance outcomes
under different environmental conditions. Since integration efforts
involve costs (Souder et al., 1998; O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002)
and risks (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008), it is important to inform
managers precisely which SCI efforts are effective under speciﬁc
environmental conditions.

2.1. Dimensions of supply chain integration (SCI)

The understanding of SCI requires clear construct deﬁnitions
and good measures (Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2008; Flynn et al.,
2010). Following Pagell (2004) and Flynn et al. (2010), SCI is deﬁned
as the strategic collaboration of both intra-organizational and inter-
organizational processes. We have collapsed SCI construct into
three dimensions: customer, supplier and internal integration, to
reﬂect its multidimensionality (Flynn et al., 2010). In this paper,
internal integration is deﬁned as the strategic system of cross-
functioning and collective responsibility across functions (Follett,
1993), where collaboration across product design, procurement,
production, sales and distribution functions takes place to meet
customer requirements at a low total system cost (Morash et al.,
1997). Internal integration efforts break down functional barriers
and facilitate sharing of real-time information across key functions
(Wong et al., 2007).

External integration comprises supplier and customer inte-
gration. Supplier integration involves strategic joint collaboration
between a focal ﬁrm and its suppliers in managing cross-ﬁrm
business processes, including information sharing, strategic part-
nership, collaboration in planning, joint product development, and
so forth (Ettlie and Reza, 1992; Lai et al., 2010; Ragatz et al.,
2002). Likewise, customer integration involves strategic infor-
mation sharing and collaboration between a focal ﬁrm and its
customers which aim to improve visibility and enable joint plan-
ning (Fisher et al., 1994). Customer integration enables a deeper
understanding of market expectations and opportunities, which
contributes to a more accurate and quicker response to customer
needs and requirements (Swink et al., 2007) by matching supply
with demand (Lee et al., 1997). The above deﬁnitions are distinct
from those in some of the existing literature which ignore the dif-
ferences between the dimensions of integration (Stank et al., 1999;
Rosenzweig et al., 2003).

2. Theoretical model and hypotheses

2.2. The SCI–performance relationships

In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne the key theoretical constructs and
then develop a theoretical model and hypotheses to explain the
moderating effects of EU on SCI–performance relationships.

Fig. 1 illustrates our proposed theoretical model which suggests
the impacts of the three SCI dimensions on four operational per-
formance outcomes under the effects of EU. A model is proposed


606

for each SCI dimension because we intend to clarify the distinct
impacts of each SCI dimension under varying EUs.

We ﬁrst examine the relationships between internal, supplier
and customer integration and the four dimensions of operational
performance without taking into consideration the effects of EU.
To understand internal integration–performance relationships, we
draw upon existing knowledge from total quality management
(TQM), product development, and production literature. Internal
integration is arguably the basis of SCI; it removes functional bar-
riers (Flynn et al., 2010) and enables cooperation across internal
functions (Morash et al., 1997). As suggested by the TQM literature,
the successful implementation of quality management requires
a constancy of purpose and breaking down of barriers between
departments (Deming, 1982). With a lack of internal integration,
different functions may work at cross-purposes and result in effort
redundancy and waste of resources, which can have a detrimental
impact on cost and quality performance (Pagell, 2004). Likewise,
the product development literature ascertains that internal inte-
gration enables product design, engineering, manufacturing, and
marketing departments to work closely in supporting concurrent
engineering and design for manufacturing (Crawford, 1992). Inter-
nal integration facilitates cross functional teams to simultaneously
improve product and process designs, which are instrumental to
reducing production cost (Ettlie and Stoll, 1990) and improving
product quality (Rosenzweig et al., 2003). From the production lit-
erature, there are arguments that internal integration enables the
sharing of knowledge across functions and manufacturing plants
(Roth, 1996; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002), and allows for better
coordination of production capacity to improve production ﬂexibil-
ity (Sawhney, 2006) and delivery performance (Dröge et al., 2004).
These theoretical arguments have been supported by numerous
studies which demonstrated positive associations between inter-
nal integration and process efﬁciency (Saeed et al., 2005; Swink
et al., 2007), logistics service performance (Germain and Iyer, 2006;
Stank et al., 2001), delivery performance (Swink et al., 2007), quality
(Swink et al., 2007) and product development cycle time or respon-
siveness (Dröge et al., 2004). All these theoretical arguments and
empirical evidence suggest the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1.
Internal integration is positively associated with (a)
delivery, (b) production cost, (c) product quality, and (d) production
ﬂexibility.

Employing a reductionist approach, we view a focal ﬁrm as an
internal environment and suppliers and customers as its exter-
nal environment. We argue that such an approach allows us to
understand how each SCI dimension operates, as well as how its
performance impacts may be affected by EU. Within a focal ﬁrm,
new product development, marketing, procurement, production
and logistics are major tasks that contribute to operational per-
formance improvement. However, the performance of these tasks
greatly depends on input and collaboration from suppliers and cus-
tomers. Based on the OIPT developed by Galbraith (1973), external
integration supports external routines and processes that collect
accurate demand and supply information essential for the coor-
dination of the above tasks (Stank et al., 1999). With a low level
of supplier and customer integration, a focal ﬁrm is more likely
to receive inaccurate or distorted supply and demand information,
which results in poor production plans, high level of inventory and
poor delivery reliability (Lee et al., 1997).

Furthermore, integration with suppliers and customers pro-
motes cooperation and development of cross-ﬁrm problem-solving
routines (Flynn and Flynn, 1999; Narasimhan and Jayaram, 1998).
This creates mutual understanding and facilitates task coordina-
tion, which help to reduce wastage and redundancy of efforts in
managing supply chain activities across partner ﬁrms (Swink et al.,
2007). More importantly, integration with customers and suppli-

ers helps to resolve conﬂicting objectives and further facilitates
joint efforts in cost and inventory reduction, quality improvement
and new product development, which result in a better time-based
performance, such as delivery and production ﬂexibility (Scannell
et al., 2000; Rosenzweig et al., 2003), and product quality (Scannell
et al., 2000; Ettlie and Reza, 1992; Rosenzweig et al., 2003). Fur-
thermore, external integration improves process ﬂexibility (Ettlie
and Reza, 1992) by allowing supply chain partners to better antic-
ipate and coordinate supply and demand (Flynn et al., 2010). Such
a coordination effort is essential for the improvement of deliv-
ery performance as well as a quick response to changing market
needs. Furthermore, prior studies have ascertained positive associ-
ations between supplier integration and cost (Scannell et al., 2000;
Devaraj et al., 2007), supply chain integration intensity and product
quality and delivery reliability (Rosenzweig et al., 2003), and exter-
nal integration and time-based performance (Dröge et al., 2004).
All these theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest the
following hypotheses.

Hypothesis 2. Supplier integration is positively associated with
(a) delivery, (b) production cost, (c) product quality, and (d) pro-
duction ﬂexibility.

Hypothesis 3. Customer integration is positively associated with
(a) delivery, (b) production cost, (c) product quality, and (d) pro-
duction ﬂexibility.

2.3. The strengths of SCI–performance relationships under EU

Uncertainty can be deﬁned as the inability to assign probabili-
ties to future events (Duncan, 1972) or the difﬁculties to accurately
predict the outcomes of decisions (Downey et al., 1975; Duncan,
1972). In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty aroused from the
external environment of a focal ﬁrm and therefore, call it environ-
mental uncertainty (EU). In the context of a supply chain, EU is
an inherent condition of cross-ﬁrm interactions because the ﬂow
of goods and information involve multiple lines of communication
and tasks across ﬁrms (Miller, 1987), making it difﬁcult to predict
the causal relationships of events. In this paper, EU is considered as a
moderator of SCI–performance relationships. Our main focus is the
strength but not the form of the moderation effect (Venkatraman,
1989). This means we aim to investigate the impact of EU on the
strengths of SCI–performance relationships, but not the joint effect
of SCI dimensions and EU on performance outcomes.

To explain the moderating effects of EU, we have integrated
CT with OIPT. According to the CT, a ﬁrm’s performance is
attributable to the “match” or “ﬁt” between its structure and pro-
cesses with environmental conditions (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967;
Thompson, 1967; Miller, 1987). The CT suggests that ﬁrms often
enact or shape their business environment through a series of
externally oriented strategies when facing uncertainty in their
environment (Thompson, 1967). The CT posits that external inte-
gration is expected to “ﬁt” with a high EU (Thompson, 1967).
Furthermore, the OIPT suggests the need to improve information
processing capability and information quality under high uncer-
tainty (Galbraith, 1973; Thompson, 1967). There is certainly a
need to acquire and process additional and rich information under
a high EU (Stonebraker and Liao, 2006; Koufteros et al., 2005)
because a high EU creates the need to scan the markets. Conse-
quently, this would then require external integrative mechanisms
to collect information (Galbraith, 1973), coordinate and monitor
business activities of partner ﬁrms (Miller, 1992), and facilitate
ﬂexible response and quick decision-making (Sitkin et al., 1994).
These two theories strongly suggest the need to distinguish inter-
nal from external integration, which was previously suggested by
Miller (1992).

607

To further explain the direction of moderating effects, we distin-
guish the mechanisms in which internal and external integration
affect different groups of operational performance outcomes. A
study by Souder et al. (1998) concluded that different integration
dimensions will have different impacts on different performance
measures. We argue that time-based performance outcomes, such
as delivery and production ﬂexibility, are highly sensitive to exter-
nal inputs, such as the accuracy and timeliness of supply and
demand information (Blackburn, 1991). Thus, under a high EU, sup-
plier and customer integration are likely to strengthen delivery
and production ﬂexibility performance. Furthermore, for manu-
facturers operating in a just-in-time (JIT) production environment,
internal integration alone may not be adequate for improving deliv-
ery performance and production ﬂexibility, especially when there
are high levels of demand and supply uncertainties (Schonberger,
1986), where a ﬁrm needs to acquire market information in addi-
tion to coordinate its internal functions. Thus, we posit that, under a
high EU, the associations between internal integration and delivery
performance and production ﬂexibility will not be strengthened,
but those between supplier and customer integration, and delivery
performance and production ﬂexibility, will be strengthened.

On the other hand, product quality and production cost perfor-
mance of a focal ﬁrm heavily relies on internal ﬁt and constancy
of purpose across functions. According to the TQM literature, it is
the sharing of information, constancy of purpose and cooperation
across functions which allow workers to focus on cost reduction
and quality improvement (Deming, 1982; Crawford, 1992). Under a
high EU, cross-functional integration will further enable the explo-
ration and synergy of cross-functional knowledge sharing (Roth,
1996) and therefore, helps to develop new skills and resources
to improve product quality and cost (Sitkin et al., 1994). Thus,
we argue that the associations between internal integration, and
product quality and production cost will be strengthened under a
high EU. A high EU will also create the need for external alignment
with suppliers and customers, but not necessarily improve product
quality and production cost. In fact, the literature on product devel-
opment argues that the performance impact of supplier integration
diminishes under EU. Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995) revealed that
supplier integration has a negative impact, particularly in uncer-
tain environments, as supplier and customer collaboration makes
product development more costly, complicated, time-consuming,
and difﬁcult to manage and control. Furthermore, in the context of
an automotive supply chain, product quality is often regarded as
an order qualiﬁer for supplier qualiﬁcation purpose. Thus, product
quality is not the main focus of supplier and customer integra-
tive efforts, and we do not expect the external integration–product
quality relationships to be strengthened under a high EU. With
the above arguments, we have established the following three
hypotheses.

Hypothesis 4. Under a high EU, the associations between inter-
nal integration and (b) production cost and (c) product quality will
be strengthened, but those between internal integration and (a)
delivery and (d) production ﬂexibility, will not be strengthened.

Hypothesis 5. Under a high EU, the associations between sup-
plier integration and (a) delivery and (d) production ﬂexibility will
be strengthened, but those between supplier integration (b) pro-
duction cost and (c) product quality, will be not strengthened.

Hypothesis 6. Under a high EU, the associations between cus-
tomer integration and (a) delivery and (d) production ﬂexibility will
be strengthened, but those between customer integration and (b)
production cost and (c) product quality, will be not strengthened.

3. Research method

3.1. Sample and data collection

This study focuses on Thailand’s automotive industry, which is
one of the largest motor vehicle manufacturing bases in terms of
gross output and export value in the world currently ranking 13th
globally. According to the Federation of Thai Industries, Thailand
produced approximately 1.7 million motor vehicles in 2010, which
accounted for 10.5 percent of the Thai economy (The Economist
Intelligence Unit, 2010). Compared to 325,000 units produced in
2000, Thailand has the highest production growth rate among
the major Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) motor
vehicle producing countries (Wad, 2009). Furthermore, Thailand’s
automotive industry exports half of the vehicles produced worth
about 250 million U.S. dollars. Thailand is poised to become an
export-oriented auto producing country with exports far sur-
passing domestic use (Janakiraman, 2010). Many foreign major
automakers, including Toyota, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Nissan,
Honda, and Ford, set up their production facilities and operations
in Thailand (Fuller, 2010b) to seize the advantage of low exchange
rate and labor costs (Tabuchi, 2010), and ﬁnancing supports of local
banks (Fuller, 2010a).

We tested our theoretical model through a survey of Thailand’s
automotive industry for four main reasons. First, automotive sup-
ply chains and operational structures have been well documented
in previous research, and SCI is widely adopted in the industry
(Lockström et al., 2010). Secondly, the automotive sector is a lead-
ing Thai industry in implementing SCI strategies (Pantumsinchai,
2002). Thirdly, focusing on a single industry will ensure high inter-
nal validity. Finally, previous studies on the contingency effects
of EU were conducted based largely on samples from developed
countries such as the U.S.; studies in developing countries such
as Thailand will allow us to assess the validity of the contingency
arguments.

The sample for this research was identiﬁed from two sources: (1)
the Directory of the Society of Automotive Engineering of Thailand,
and (2) the Thailand Automotive Industry Directory. A mailing list of
799 automakers and ﬁrst-tier automotive suppliers in Thailand was
established. Sample selection is not an issue because the mailing list
covered the whole population. An address validation exercise was
conducted, which resulted in a ﬁnal mailing list of 724 ﬁrms. Posi-
tions, such as CEO/president, vice president/director, operations
manager, and supply chain manager, were identiﬁed as respon-
dents because of their knowledge on the level of SCI practices and
operational performance in their ﬁrms.

We followed Frohlich’s (2002) suggestion to improve the
response rate by calling all 724 respondents before sending out the
questionnaire. The questionnaire was then sent out in two phases.
In the ﬁrst phase, 116 responses were received. Phone calls were
then made to targeted respondents who did not respond, and con-
sequently, we received 47 additional responses in the second phase.
Twelve returned questionnaires were discarded due to incomplete
responses, which resulted in 151 usable responses. A response rate
of 20.85% is close to the recommended number for empirical stud-
ies in operations management (Malhotra and Grover, 1998). Table 1
summarizes the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Of
the respondents, 12% are automakers, and the rest are different part
suppliers.

Non-response bias was ﬁrst tested by using the extrapolation
method suggested by Armstrong and Overton (1977). A comparison
between early and late responses showed no statistical differences
across the 4 key characteristics and 10 measures at p < 0.05, which
suggests no non-response bias. We further tested non-response
bias by conducting a t-test to check whether there is any signiﬁcant
difference across 4 key characteristics and 10 measures between

dents) to ensure that the indicators were understandable and
relevant to practices in Thailand’s automotive industry. Feedback
from the pilot test was used to improve the wording in some of the
questions.

early respondents and respondents who initially declined to partic-
ipate, but later returned the questionnaires. The t-test results show
no signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05), which suggests no non-response
bias issues.

Since data were collected from a single person at a single point
in time, common method variance (CMV) might be a threat to
the validity of our results. Thus, we segmented the questions that
pertained to the independent (SCI) and dependent (operational
performance) variables into different sections in the questionnaire
(Podsakoff et al., 2003). We conducted the Harman’s one-factor test
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) to ensure that no one general factor
accounted for the majority of covariance between the predictor and
criterion variables. Our factor analysis indicated no single factor,
where the independent and dependent variables load on different
factors with the ﬁrst factor accounting for less than 40% of total
variance, which suggests that there is no CMV problem.

3.2. Measures and questionnaire design

As depicted in Table 2, all measures of our key constructs are
adapted from the literature. We adapted existing scales to measure
internal integration (Stank et al., 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002;
Flynn et al., 2010), supplier and customer integration (Narasimhan
and Kim, 2002; Flynn et al., 2010), delivery, product quality and pro-
duction cost (Ward and Duray, 2000; Boyer and Lewis, 2002), and
production ﬂexibility (Gupta and Somers, 1992; Chang et al., 2003).
EU is conceptualized as a composite measure of supply, demand,
competitive, and technological uncertainties based on the scales
developed by Germain et al. (1994) and Wong et al. (2009). A ﬁve-
point Likert scale was used for all the above constructs; a higher
value indicates a higher level of integration and uncertainty, or a
better performance.

Since the scales adapted from the literature were in English,
they were translated into Thai by two bilingual Thai researchers. A
back-translation process was applied to ensure conceptual equiv-
alence (Cai et al., 2010). Three academics from the ﬁeld of supply
chain and operations management reviewed the initial measure-
ment scales and provided feedback. Next, we invited four expert
judges who have related industry experience to validate the scales
using the Q-Sort method. The Q-Sort method required experts to
sort the scales into groups, in which each group corresponded to
a construct upon agreement (Moore and Benbasat, 1991). The Q-
Sort results suggested acceptable content validity because the scale
achieved a placement score greater than 70% (Moore and Benbasat,
1991). As suggested by Hensley (1999), the revised questionnaire
was pilot-tested with a small-scale survey (21 potential respon-

3.3. Measure validation and reliability

The unidimensionality of the key constructs were assessed by
a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA results summarized
in Table 2 show that the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) values and
the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) values are
well above the recommended cut-off value of 0.90, and below
or equal the recommended value of 0.08, respectively (Hu and
Bentler, 1999), which suggest all the constructs are unidimensional.
Furthermore, the incremental ﬁt index (IFI) and the Tucker-Lewis
index (TLI) are also well above the recommended threshold of 0.90
(Hu and Bentler, 1999).

The reliability of the constructs and scales was assessed using
Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability. As shown in Table 2,
the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability of all the constructs
are greater than 0.70, which indicate adequate reliability of the
measurement scales (Nunnally, 1978; Fornell and Larcker, 1981;
O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998). Following O’Leary-Kelly and
Vokurka’s (1998) suggestion, we evaluated the convergent validity
of each measurement scale by conducting another CFA using the
maximum likelihood approach. As summarized in Table 2, all indi-
cators in their respective constructs have statistically signiﬁcant
(p < 0.05) factor loadings from 0.50 to 0.90, which suggest conver-
gent validity of the theoretical constructs (Anderson and Gerbing,
1988). Furthermore, the average variance extracted (AVE) of each
construct exceeds the recommended minimum value of 0.5 (Fornell
and Larcker, 1981), which indicates strong convergent validity.

Table 3 presents the means, standard deviations, and correla-
tions of all the theoretical constructs. The bivariate correlations
between the SCI and operational performance outcomes range
from 0.33 to 0.46 with signiﬁcances p < 0.01, which indicate
acceptable criterion validity (Nunnally, 1978). The possibility of
multicollinearity among the indicators is assessed by computing
the variance inﬂation factor (VIF), which evaluates the degree to
which each variable can be explained by other variables (Hair et al.,
1998). All VIFs are well below the maximum acceptable cut-off
value of 10, which indicate the absence of multicollinearity (Neter
et al., 1996).

The discriminant validity of the constructs is tested by mea-
suring the degree to which each construct and its indicators are
different from another construct and its indicators. We conducted
a series of (cid:2)2 difference tests between nested CFA models for all
pairs of constructs. For each pair of constructs, we compared the
(cid:2)2 between the unconstrained model (with two constructs varying
freely) and the constrained model (with the correlations between
two constructs constrained to 1) (Bagozzi et al., 1991). Table 4
summarizes the (cid:2)2 for the unconstrained and constrained models.
Signiﬁcant (cid:2)2 differences between all pairs of constructs suggest
discriminant validity (Bagozzi et al., 1991). In addition, the square
root of AVE of all the constructs is greater than the correlation
between any pair of them as shown in Table 3, which indicates
a satisfactory level of discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker,
1981).

Table 5, the overall ﬁts of all three structural models are good,
with the CFI, IFI, and TLI well above the recommended threshold
of 0.90 (Hu and Bentler, 1999), and the SRMR less than 0.08 (Hu
and Bentler, 1999).

Table 5 indicates that internal integration is positively and sig-
niﬁcantly (p < 0.001) associated with the four areas of operational
performance, which lends support for H1a-H1d. Similarly, sup-
plier integration is positively and signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) associated

with the four areas of operational performance, which provides
support for H2a–H2d. Finally, the same holds for customer integra-
tion (p < 0.001), which lends support for H3a–H3d.

group model by dividing the sample into high (n = 75, mean = 3.50)
and low (n = 76, mean = 2.40) EU groups based on the median of
its composite score (Germain et al., 2008). Next, we conducted
multi-group and structural path analyses using AMOS 17.0. A
multi-group analysis for each dimension of the SCI was conducted
to investigate the performance impacts under the inﬂuence of high
and low EUs. This procedure satisﬁes the recommended guidelines
of having at least a couple of cases per free parameter in each
model for each high and low EU group (Marsh et al., 1998). Table 6
summarizes the results of the multi-group and structural path
analyses.

Panel A in Table 6 summarizes the path estimates and (cid:2)2
statistics for the path from internal integration to the various
operational performance outcomes under high and low EUs (H4).
We found signiﬁcant differences in the (cid:2)2 statistics ((cid:2)2 = 82.50,
df = 50, p < 0.05) between the baseline model (e.g., the struc-
tural model parameters varied freely across the two uncertainty
groups), and the constrained model (e.g., structural parameters
constrained to be equal across the two uncertainty groups), which
suggest variance of the model under high and low EUs. We then
tested the equality of the paths between the high and low EU
groups. A signiﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference ((cid:2)2 with p < 0.05) indicates
a moderation effect of the EU. The results showed that the inter-
nal integration–delivery relationship is signiﬁcant but invariant in
terms of its strengths under high and low EUs ((cid:2)2 = 1.09, p > 0.05),
which lends support for H4a. The results further indicated that
the internal integration–production cost relationship is signiﬁcant
under low (ˇ = 0.42, p < 0.01) and high EUs (ˇ = 0.72, p < 0.001).
Based on a signiﬁcant difference in the (cid:2)2 statistics ((cid:2)2 = 4.59,
p < 0.05) and the difference in ˇ, we concluded that the internal
integration–production cost relationship is strengthened under a
high EU, which lends support for H4b. The relationship between
internal integration and product quality is also signiﬁcant under
low (ˇ = 0.58, p < 0.001) and high EUs (ˇ = 0.76, p < 0.001) with a sig-
niﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference ((cid:2)2 = 3.96, p < 0.05), which suggests that the
internal integration–product quality relationship is strengthened
under a high EU, and hence, supports H4c. Finally, the relationship
between internal integration and production ﬂexibility is signiﬁ-
cant under low and high EUs, but the (cid:2)2 difference test suggests
invariance of the relationship across high and low EUs ((cid:2)2 = 1.94,
p > 0.05), and hence, supports H4d.

Panel B of Table 6 shows a repeat of the above analysis for the
supplier integration–performance paths. We also found signiﬁcant
differences in the (cid:2)2 statistics ((cid:2)2 = 79.19, p < 0.05) between the
baseline and constrained models. The results indicated that the
relationship between supplier integration and delivery is signif-
icant under low (ˇ = 0.65, p < 0.001) and high uncertainty groups
(ˇ = 0.72, p < 0.05). While a signiﬁcant difference in the (cid:2)2 statistics
((cid:2)2 = 3.94, p < 0.05) suggests variance, the difference in ˇ suggests
that the supplier integration–delivery relationship is strengthened
under high EU, which lends support for H5a. However, the path
from supplier integration to production cost ((cid:2)2 = 2.38, p > 0.05),
and the path from supplier integration to product quality are found
to have an insigniﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference ((cid:2)2 = 2.52, p > 0.05), which
suggest the absence of a contingency effect, and hence, lend support
to H5b and H5c. Finally, the relationship between supplier integra-
tion and production ﬂexibility is signiﬁcant under low (ˇ = 0.40,
p < 0.05) and high uncertainty groups (ˇ = 0.62, p < 0.05). A signif-
icant difference of the (cid:2)2 statistics ((cid:2)2 = 4.55, p < 0.05) suggests
variance of the path across high and low EUs. These results suggest
that the supplier integration–production ﬂexibility relationship is
strengthened under a high EU, which lends support for H5d.

Lastly, panel C of Table 6 shows a repeat of the above analysis for
the paths from customer integration to operational performance.
We found signiﬁcant differences in the (cid:2)2 statistics ((cid:2)2 = 108.16,
df = 53, p < 0.05) between the baseline and constrained models.

The results showed an insigniﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference between high and
low EU groups for the relationship between customer integration
and delivery ((cid:2)2 = 0.27, p > 0.05), which does not support H6a. The
results indicated that customer integration–production cost and
the customer integration–product quality relationships are posi-
tively signiﬁcant. However, there are no signiﬁcant (cid:2)2 differences
between the customer integration–production cost relationship
((cid:2)2 = 0.28, p > 0.05) and the customer integration–product qual-
ity relationship ((cid:2)2 = 0.47, p > 0.05), and hence, supports H6b
and H6c. Finally, a signiﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference is found between the
high and low uncertainty groups ((cid:2)2 = 3.92, p < 0.05) for the path
from customer integration to production ﬂexibility; its path coef-
ﬁcients are signiﬁcant in both high (ˇ = 0.65, p < 0.001) and low
uncertainty groups (ˇ = 0.47, p < 0.05). A difference in ˇ shows
that the customer integration–production ﬂexibility relationship
is strengthened when the EU is high, which lends support for H6d.

5. Discussion and implications

5.1. Discussion of results

The results of the SCI–performance relationships (H1–H3) sup-
port our expectations and are largely consistent with prior research
studies. Although the value of SCI has been proven by prior studies,
our results further justify the value of the three SCI dimensions in
an emerging country such as Thailand. Our results offer evidence
of the purported impacts of internal, supplier and customer inte-
gration on various operational performance outcomes. Previous
studies have demonstrated the positive impacts of internal inte-
gration on delivery and quality (Dröge et al., 2004; Germain and
Iyer, 2006; Swink et al., 2007); our results further provide evidence
of the positive impacts of internal integration on production cost
and production ﬂexibility. These results reinforce the argument for
the need to remove functional barriers (Flynn et al., 2010) and to
achieve agreement on consistent purposes and cooperation across
functions (Deming, 1982) to reduce cost (Ettlie and Stoll, 1990) and
improve ﬂexibility (Sawhney, 2006).

In terms of the value of external integration, our results demon-
strate positive impacts of both supplier and customer integration
on delivery, product quality, and production cost, consistent with
the results of prior studies (Scannell et al., 2000; Rosenzweig et al.,
2003; Dröge et al., 2004; Devaraj et al., 2007). Our results further
add evidence to the purported positive impacts of supplier and
customer integration on production ﬂexibility (Rosenzweig et al.,
2003). More importantly, our results indicate the beneﬁts of consid-
ering suppliers and customers as the providers of information and
collaboration (Galbraith, 1973) which will improve product devel-
opment, marketing, procurement, production and logistics, and
facilitate information exchange (Lee et al., 1997), task coordination
(Stank et al., 1999), cross-border problem-solving routines (Flynn
and Flynn, 1999), joint cost and inventory reduction (Scannell et al.,
2000).

Although the value of SCI has been recognized, previous lit-
erature lacks a theory which can explain why in some instances,
EU has no effect on an SCI–performance relationship (Koufteros
et al., 2005), but in other instances, an SCI–performance relation-
ship could be strengthened or weakened under the inﬂuence of EU
(O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002). Our results (H4–H6) conﬁrmed
that such complex relationships can largely be explained by our
proposed theories. Our theories are supported by the results which
indicate that internal integration will have greater impacts on prod-
uct quality and production cost under a high EU because these
performance outcomes greatly depend on internal ﬁt, but not exter-
nal input (Ragatz et al., 2002). These results further support the
TQM literature which argues for the importance of constancy of

purpose and cooperation across functions as the foundations for
improving cost and quality (Deming, 1982; Crawford, 1992). Such
foundations will encourage knowledge sharing and development of
new skills when a focal ﬁrm is faced with an uncertain environment
(Roth, 1996; Sitkin et al., 1994). These explanations are conﬁrmed
by further interviews with some respondents who suggested that
Thailand’s automotive industry embraces internal integration to
reduce uncertainty by facilitating internal collaboration amongst
business functions in response to high production cost and to
reduce the defect rate in production (Lai et al., 2008).

Our results further conﬁrm our theoretical premise which sug-
gests that external integration, instead of internal integration, will
have greater impact on delivery and production ﬂexibility under
a high EU because these performance outcomes are sensitive to
external input and collaboration. On the other hand, the absence
of moderating effects of EU on the relationships between sup-
plier/customer integration, and product quality and production
cost is as expected because these two performance outcomes are
less sensitive to external input and collaboration (Ragatz et al.,
2002). Further interviews with some of the respondents suggest
that delivery performance is one of the most important perfor-
mance criteria for automotive ﬁrms. Also, delivery performance
is highly sensitive to external input and coordination. Thus, these
ﬁrms need to work closely by sharing information and joint plan-
ning to ensure continuous input ﬂow, especially when facing a
highly uncertain environment.

Even though our results largely support our contingency the-
ories, one of our hypotheses (H6a) is rejected. We theorized
that both supplier integration–delivery performance and customer
integration–delivery performance relationships are strengthened
under a high EU. Our results indicate that only the former,
not the latter relationship, is strengthened. To gain an in-depth
understanding on this counter-intuitive result, we conducted fur-
ther interviews with Thailand’s automotive industry managers to
identify contextually embedded explanations. Our interviewees
suggested that customer integration is insufﬁcient to improve
delivery performance under a high EU. Instead, internal integration
plays a signiﬁcant role in ensuring coordination between internal
functions to improve delivery performance. This is because, under
a highly uncertain environment, it is difﬁcult for JIT delivery to
the market to correspond with JIT production. As suggested by the
interviewees, although they have customer integration to support
JIT delivery, internal integration is required to support JIT pro-
duction and collaboration amongst business functions to achieve
delivery performance improvements.

5.2. Implications and contributions to theory

The ﬁndings of this paper provide implications and contribu-
tions to SCI and OM theories. The ﬁrst implication is concerned
with the conceptualization of constructs. This paper demonstrates
the beneﬁts of conceptualizing SCI and operational performance as
multidimensional constructs (Dröge et al., 2004; Koufteros et al.,
2005; Devaraj et al., 2007; Swink et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2010).
Unlike some previous studies which conceptualize SCI and/or oper-
ational performance as unidimensional constructs (e.g., Stank et al.,
1999; Rosenzweig et al., 2003), this paper allows us to comprehen-
sively understand the details of SCI–performance relationships at
dimension levels. More importantly, the use of multidimensional
SCI and performance constructs (Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)
allows us to develop a comprehensive model and theory of the con-
tingency effects of EU. Knowledge at this level of particularity could
not be created without taking approaches like ours.

Perhaps the most signiﬁcant contribution of this paper is the
development and testing of a novel theoretical model on the mod-
erating effects of EU on SCI–performance relationships. The model

complements previous studies (O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002;
Fynes et al., 2004; Koufteros et al., 2005), and lays the founda-
tions for the development of a contingency theory of SCI. Our
contribution lies in the approach in which we integrate CT and
OIPT. OIPT allows us to demonstrate the beneﬁt of viewing a
focal ﬁrm and its environment from an organizational informa-
tion processing perspective (Galbraith, 1973), and the importance
of understanding the distinct mechanisms in which internal and
external integration affect the different groups of performance out-
comes. Organizational information processing logic serves as the
basis to identify two contingencies which were previously not
considered in the SCI and OM literature. The ﬁrst contingency
concerns the nature of operational performance outcomes, which
can be divided into time-based externally sensitive and non time-
based internally dependent performance outcomes. The second
contingency concerns the distinct effects of the two groups of
SCIs (internal versus external integration) on these two groups of
performance outcomes under a high EU. Such a novel approach
provides the much needed logical arguments to explain why only
some SCI–performance relationships could be strengthened under
a high EU. In summary, this paper helps to clarify the tenuous and
spotty relationships among EU, SCI and operations performance
(Stonebraker and Liao, 2006), and contributes to contingency oper-
ations management research (Sousa and Voss, 2008).

5.3. Implications and contributions to practice

In terms of implications for managerial practice, this paper
advances the understanding of operations and supply chain man-
agers. Managers are now equipped with theories and supporting
evidence which explain why their SCI efforts to cope with a high
EU do not always bring about desirable operational performance
outcomes. By differentiating internal from external integration,
managers can now understand that both supplier and customer
integration are paramount in providing input to the operational
tasks required to improve time-based and externally sensitive per-
formance outcomes, such as delivery and ﬂexibility under a high EU.
This means that managers should focus on investment in external
integration to improve time-based performance, such as delivery
and ﬂexibility, because these performance outcomes are sensitive
to input and collaboration with suppliers and customers, especially
under a high EU. For instance, in the context of our study, Thailand’s
automotive industry is one of the major car exporters in Asia, and
faces severe competition with Japan and South Korea in seizing
shares in such markets as Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Mid-
dle East (Fuller, 2010b). Integrating with suppliers and customers
becomes crucial for the automakers to secure components and
parts to ensure on-time, reliable, and timely delivery, while main-
taining ﬂexibility in product speciﬁcations, production volume,
customized product features, and product mix changes to compete.
Instead, internal integration is essential for improving non
time-based performance and internally dependent performance
outcomes, such as product quality and production cost under a
high EU. The improvement of product quality and production cost
under a high EU can be achieved by putting more effort into internal
integration, because the performance outcomes are less sensitive
to external input and collaboration, but heavily rely on internal
ﬁt across functions. When allocating investment in integration,
managers with such knowledge will be more competent in estimat-
ing and explaining the performance impacts of various integration
efforts.

5.4. Limitation and future research

This paper has some limitations. It attempts to explain the
performance implications of SCI under the contingency effects


614

C.Y. Wong et al. / Journal of Operations Management 29 (2011) 604–615

of EU, but the performance explanation is likely to be incom-
plete because SCI is not the only approach to mitigate negative
effects of EU. Although EU is a key factor that affects the perfor-
mance of operations, it is not the only contingency factor in the
SCI–performance relationship. Based on the resource dependency
theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), EU may originate from the
nature of inter-organizational dependency (Handﬁeld, 1993). Other
means to mitigate such an uncertainty are, for example, acquir-
ing control over resources to minimize dependence on other ﬁrms.
Thus, when considering inter-dependency as another contingency
factor, other aspects of understanding may be created and differ-
ent managerial implications may emerge. For example, in order to
reduce the disturbance of supply uncertainty in a JIT environment, it
is advisable to take over the responsibility of inbound logistics (Hill
and Vollmann, 1986). Alternatively, legal means may also help to
control the environment. For example, the possession of a patent
may reduce the negative impacts of technological and competitive
uncertainties.

Furthermore, some literature suggests that when integration is
coupled with different ﬁrm structures, there will be different per-
formance implications under different levels of EU. Miller (1987)
argued that integration with bureaucratic mechanisms (with for-
mal control and integration of decisions) is required for a stable
environment, and integration with organic mechanisms is more
effective for an unpredictable environment. Organic mechanisms
such as environment scanning, delegation of authority, and simpli-
ﬁcation of procedures are able to reduce or mitigate uncertainty.
Future studies may extend our research model by including the
bureaucratic–organic nature of focal ﬁrms, and also explore other
contingency factors, such as industrial maturity, order qualiﬁer,
level of outsourcing, etc. (Sousa and Voss, 2008).

To understand the complex contingency effects of EU, this
paper employs a large-scale survey of a single industry. Although
the survey of a single industry has its own advantages, omitting
other industries may decrease the generalizability of the results.
Thus, further large-scale and cross-sectional research is recom-
mended. However, the use of large-scale studies with surveys offers
more statistically generalizable, but potentially superﬁcial ﬁnd-
ings (Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004). In addition, the relationships
among SCI, operational performance, EU and other contextual fac-
tors are rather multi-faceted and complicated (Stonebraker and
Liao, 2006). Even though more theory-testing research is required,
longitudinal and case studies are recommended to fully under-
stand the mechanisms behind each SCI–performance relationship
and the contingency effects of other contextual factors. In order
to meet some of the data analysis criteria (Marsh et al., 1998),
this paper investigates internal, supplier and customer integration
in three separate models, and has therefore ignored the potential
interactions among SCI dimensions. Future research should take
into account the potential interactions and combined performance
impacts among different SCI dimensions (Germain and Iyer, 2006;
Flynn et al., 2010). Finally, this paper focuses on the strength of
the moderating effects, but further studies on their form (the joint
effects of EU and SCI) are required. Such joint effects may be tested
using a moderated regression analysis (Venkatraman, 1989).

6. Conclusion

This paper advances SCI research by developing theories and
providing empirical evidence to explain the contingency effects of
EU on the impacts of three SCI dimensions on four dimensions of
operational performance outcomes. Integrating CT and OIPT, this
paper develops a novel approach and theory to explain the com-
plex relationships among EU, SCI and operational performance.
With this approach, we are able to differentiate the performance

mechanism of internal from external integration, and time-based,
externally dependent performance outcomes, from non time-
based, internally dependent performance outcomes. With this
approach, we are able to explain how and why the impacts of cer-
tain SCI dimensions on speciﬁc operational performance outcomes
can be strengthened.

Such an enhanced understanding has implications for opera-
tions management contingency research (Sousa and Voss, 2008)
and managerial practice. We can further progress from the justiﬁ-
cation of the value of SCI to the explanation of the contexts to which
it is effective. With the theories and ﬁndings of this paper, it is now
possible for managers to stipulate the environmental conditions
to which an appropriate SCI dimension would have on particular
operational performance outcomes. However, the search for con-
tingency effects is still at its infancy stage. Our ﬁndings lay the
grounds to expand SCI research into exploring different means of
reducing or mitigating the impacts of EUs, and the understanding of
other contingency factors. In addition, more qualitative and quan-
titative investigations of the inherently complex interactions and
relationships among SCI, EU, operational performance and other
contextual factors are required.
