 Mobility Barriers and Tobin's q*

 I. Introduction

 The ratio of the market value of the firm to the
 replacement cost of its assets, known as Tobin's
 q, equilibrates to unity if the firm earns no rents.
 The greater the expected level of rents, the
 greater the value of q above unity. 1 This property
 has enabled several industrial organization stud-
 ies to use q as an index of rents in testing the
 relation between market structure and profitabil-
 ity.2 In earlier work, we found that the change of
 market value (the numerator of q) in response to
 new information about the state of business pros-
 pects is different under different market struc-

 1. For the aggregate specification and interpretation of q,
 see Tobin and Brainard (1968) and Tobin (1969, 1978). Papers
 by Sullivan (1974) and Thomadakis (1977) have used variants
 of the q-ratio to identify cross-sectional variation in rents.
 Theoretical macroeconomic analyses of q are undertaken by
 Thomadakis (1976) and Lindenberg and Ross (1981).

 2. For the most recent studies, see Salinger (1984), who
 argues that rents attributable to concentration are bid away
 by labor unions. Smirlock, Gilligan and Marshall (1984) per-
 form a test of the determinants of q using concentration, mar-
 ket share, and barrier indices. Their test ignores the fact that
 valuation is affected by expectations. Hirschey (1985) also
 conducts a test and finds that the role of concentration is
 negative when research and development and advertising ex-
 penditures are included as simultaneous determinants of q.
 His study does not extend to expectational variation.

 The cross-sectional re-
 lation of Tobin's q to
 structural features of
 firms depends on mar-
 ket conditions. Fea-
 tures such as industry
 concentration, advertis-
 ing and research and
 development intensity,
 firm specialization, and
 proxies for the use of
 specialized resources
 can operate as barriers
 to entry or to exit, de-
 pending on the direc-
 tion of expectations.
 Regressions of q on
 structural features over
 periods when the
 "state of the econ-
 omy" was clearly dif-
 ferent strongly confirm
 this view. For exam-
 ple, concentration was
 positively related to q
 in the mid-1960s but
 negatively related in
 the mid-1970s. Coeffi-
 cients for all structural
 variables also changed
 significantly. This im-
 plies that structural
 features must be inter-
 preted as indices of re-
 source flexibility rather
 than as sources of sta-
 ble positive rents.

 tures.3 In this paper, we show that the relation between q and market
 structure is state dependent; that is, it is conditioned by prevailing
 expectations at any particular time period or about any particular firm.
 We argue that, in certain states, higher seller concentration will lead to
 lower rents and to lower values of q.

 The view that q is state dependent is based on the notion that differ-
 ent market structures imply different flexibilities in adjusting to
 changes in "prevailing expectations." We argue that flexibility is re-
 lated to resource mobility and that, as firms use less mobile resources,
 their flexibility is reduced and the relation of q to structural features
 becomes dependent on the state of prevailing expectations. We design
 empirical tests of the relation of q to structural features, such as indus-
 try concentration, firm specialization, and advertising and research and
 development intensities, controlling for the state of prevailing expecta-
 tions. We must, of course, point out that measured q may differ from
 theoretical q since the measurement of replacement cost is subject to
 accounting choices that may lead to errors. This problem afflicts all
 empirical studies that use q. Notwithstanding this problem (which we
 comment on further in the body of the paper), our tests on measured q
 indicate that the hypothesis of state dependence is supported by the
 empirical evidence. The balance of this paper includes our theoretical
 argument in Section II, test design and measurement in Section III,
 empirical results in Section IV, and conclusions in Section V.

 II. On the Determinants of q

 A. q and the Mobility of Resources

 A firm that is at long-run equilibrium, both in real and in financial
 markets, has no incentive to undertake real investment or disinvest-
 ment. Let V be the firm's market value, I the replacement cost of its
 assets, and q the ratio of V to I. A necessary condition for long-run
 equilibrium is that

 dV/dI = 1. (1)

 This condition guarantees that no change in investment can produce
 excess value over the investment itself.4 If it is now assumed that
 marginal and average value per dollar of investment are the same (an
 assumption that we will discuss below), it follows that, at long-run
 equilibrium, we also have

 3. The response was greater in concentrated as compared to atomistic market struc-

 tures (see Lustgarten and Thomadakis 1980).

 4. This is a form of the net present value rule for capital budgeting.

 V

 q_ =V7= 1. (2)

 Condition (2) states that, at long-run equilibrium, the firm's value
 equals the replacement cost of its assets. An alternative statement of
 this condition is, The firm's valuation reflects only the competitive
 compensation to invested capital.

 Long-run equilibrium is constantly disturbed by flows of new infor-
 mation and emergence of new opportunities. These disturbances lead
 to the violation of conditions (1) and (2). New information and new
 opportunities find rapid response in financial markets and lead to
 movement in V. If readjustment in investment is equally rapid, I will
 also move, and a new equilibrium will prevail at which again V = I.
 However, if readjustment in investment is not as rapid as the shifts in
 V, then V may diverge from I (and q from one) for protracted periods.
 Financial markets adjust quickly to information of new opportunities,
 while real markets may adjust much more slowly. The variable V is
 determined in financial markets; I is determined in real markets. If
 these two markets do not adjust simultaneously, divergence of q from
 unity is plausible. Following Lindenberg and Ross (1981), we can then
 state that

 V I + M, (3a)

 and

 q 1? +-y (3b)

 The variable M reflects the capitalized value of rents accruing to the
 firm.

 How do we interpret the case when V > I and q > 1? The value of an
 asset in use can exceed the current cost of production of an equivalent
 asset. Prima facie, this creates an inducement for increased invest-
 ment. The inducement vanishes as, with increased investment, equal-
 ity is reestablished at V = I and q = 1. Increased investment will not
 occur, however, if there are structural or behavioral factors impeding
 it. In that case, q will remain above unity for a protracted time period.
 Would it be possible to observe V < I and q < 1? Let us define the
 replacement cost of an asset as the cost of producing a new asset with
 the same output capacity and service life as the existing asset. If any
 existing asset could always be sold at its replacement cost, q < 1 is not
 possible since I would be the lower limit of V. An asset, however,
 cannot always be sold at its replacement cost if there are substantial
 search costs in the secondhand asset markets or if the asset is so
 specialized that its value in its best alternative use (i.e., liquidation

 value) is lower than its replacement cost. Then it is possible to observe
 V < I and q < 1. Prima facie, V < I creates an incentive for asset
 liquidation at replacement cost. The incentive vanishes if enough liq-
 uidation takes place so that equalities V = I and q = 1 are reestab-
 lished. Liquidation at replacement cost may not occur if it is impeded
 by structural factors (e.g., specialized inputs that lead to imperfect
 markets for secondhand assets). In that case, q can remain below unity
 for a protracted time period while disinvestment takes place through
 depreciation.

 When a condition V > I prevails, the factors that impede the in-
 creased placement of assets in use are considered to be barriers to
 entry of resources. When a condition V < I prevails, the factors that
 impede the increased displacement of assets from a particular use are
 considered to be barriers to exit of resources. These barriers to exit
 signify "lack of liquidity." Our terminology conveys two points. First,
 barriers should not be understood in the restricted sense of obstacles to
 the movement of whole firms but rather in the broader sense of impedi-
 ments to resource movements. Second, structural barriers may inter-
 pose themselves to both inward and outward resource movements, so
 that in reality we can speak of mobility barriers rather than entry
 barriers alone.

 B. Average versus Marginal q

 In Section IIA we made the assumption that marginal and average
 value per dollar of investment are the same. We now wish to discuss
 this further.

 Simple economic analysis of the firm and the industry suggests that
 only an atomistic market structure with a homogeneous product can
 satisfy the condition that q = Mq. The absence of either homogeneity
 (i.e., the existence of product differentiation) or nonatomistic structure
 will therefore imply a divergence of q from Mq. This divergence is of
 intrinsic interest to this study precisely because, where there are im-
 pediments to the mobility of resources, it is likely that output is not
 homogeneous and sellers are not atomistic.

 For empirical purposes we retain two broad assumptions. First, mar-
 ginal returns from investment follow a declining schedule. This implies
 that q > Mq. Second, we assume, following Tobin (1969) and Malkiel,
 von Furstenberg, and Watson (1979), that the rankings of q preserve
 those of Mq. This implies that we can utilize q as a proxy for Mq. Yet,
 we must remember that q is an imperfect proxy for Mq in industrial
 organization studies because the divergence of the two variables is
 itself sensitive to structural features.

 Let us now suppose that a firm facing high mobility barriers owns
 assets of replacement cost I but finds itself in a state s for which I*(s) is

 the optimal level of investment. If mobility barriers prevent adjustment
 of I to I*(s), the firm will exhibit

 or

 Mq(I; s) > 1 if I< I*(s),

 Mq(I; s) < 1 if I > I*(s).

 In the first case, mobility barriers constrain the firm to underinvest-
 ment; in the second, they constrain the firm to overinvestment. Corre-
 spondingly, in the first case they generate positive and in the second
 case negative rents. The severity of mobility barriers will regulate the
 size of positive or negative rents in each case. In a state that requires
 the firm to expand investments, q will increase as barriers become
 higher. In a state that requires the firm to contract investments, q will
 decrease as barriers become higher. If an empirical index of the height
 of barriers were available, the relation of q to this index would be state
 dependent. It would exhibit positive slopes in states that require ex-
 pansion and negative slopes in states that require contraction. The
 empirical relation could be represented as

 Mq = 1 + b(s) B. (4)

 The variable B represents the "height" of entry or exit barriers; dMq/
 dB > 0 is the case for expansion states and dMq/dB < 0 for contraction
 states. In general terms, we can state that

 q = Mq + G(S), (5)

 where G(S) is a positive-valued function of structural features (S) asso-
 ciated with the firm and its industry environment. Combining (4) and
 (5) we obtain

 q = 1 + b(s) * B + G(S). (6)

 C. Mobility Barriers and the Structure of Firms and Industries

 Barriers to the mobility of resources arise from resource specialization.
 Specialization embodies two complementary elements. First, re-
 sources need to be molded or fashioned to a specific use. This process
 takes both time and special knowledge. Thus, for example, it takes
 time and knowledge to train specialized labor, to design and build
 nonstandard equipment or production software, to create a brand name
 through advertising, or to develop new product and production exper-
 tise through research and development programs. Requirements for
 special knowledge and time can operate as impediments to the entry of
 resources for a particular use. Second, resources are highly specific to
 the use or the user and are not readily transferable to other uses or

 users. Their transfer may require extensive refashioning or time and
 expenditure for search. These costs of transfer can operate as impedi-
 ments to the exit of resources from a particular use. Thus, resource
 specialization is the source of both entry and exit barriers to resource
 movements.

 Industrial organization concepts suggest that most of the observable
 structural features of firms and industries are tied to the acquisition,
 organization, and utilization of specialized resources. High advertising
 and research and development intensities are direct indices of the use
 of specialized resources. It is reasonable to argue that concentration is
 also related to the use of specialized resources.

 A barrier to entry can be linked to concentration if the concentrated

 industry utilizes a more specialized set of resources than unconcen-
 trated industries. This view is valid if we recognize that, for economies
 of scale, large plants represent specialized and durable resources.
 More intense use of specialized resources in concentrated industries
 also implies that firms in those industries could face barriers to the exit
 of resources if these cannot be easily transferred to a new line of
 activity when their current use becomes unprofitable. In fact, the non-
 transferability of resources can act as an additional restraint to entry of
 new firms since it creates a risk to the firm in a concentrated industry of
 becoming "locked in" if economic prospects change.

 Another possible index of the utilization of specialized resources is
 the degree of firm specialization in the production of particular com-
 modities. More specialized firms use more specialized resources in the
 form of management quality, human capital, advertising, and techno-
 logical information. More generally, we surmise that, as firms become
 more specialized, they must rely increasingly on external markets for
 the acquisition or disposal of specialized resources. On the other hand,
 more diversified firms can better shift resources among uses internally
 without recourse to external markets. Specialized firms may thus be
 faced with higher mobility barriers linked to the transaction or search
 costs associated with recourse to external markets.

 We use four observable variables as proxies for the use of special-
 ized durable resources: advertising intensity, research and develop-
 ment intensity, industry concentration, and firm specialization. We
 argue that these variables capture the level and severity of entry and
 exit barriers to resouce movements. Our hypothesis can now take a
 specific form. The relation of q to these variables will be state depen-
 dent.

 Going back to equation (6), we note that structural features (S) will

 be used as indices of the severity of barriers (B). If we let

 G(S) = c + do S.

 where d > 0, then (6) becomes

 q = (1 + c) + [d + b(s)] * S. (7)

 The positive-valued coefficient d implies that the response of average q
 to S will exhibit positive values more frequently than negative ones,
 but, nevertheless, the state dependence is maintained through b(s).

 III. Test Design and Measurement of Variables

 A. The Measurement of q

 The ratio of market value to replacement cost of assets has been com-
 puted as follows. The market value of the firm was computed as the
 average of beginning and ending market value of equity plus book
 value of preferred stock and total liabilities for each year. The replace-
 ment cost of assets (also averaged over the beginning and end of each
 year) was computed from the COMPUSTAT Replacement Cost File from
 Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT Services, Inc.5 The replacement cost
 of assets was total assets plus the difference between replacement cost
 and book value of fixed assets. The difference between book value and
 replacement cost of fixed assets was disclosed for 1976-78 by com-
 panies filing under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
 Accounting Series Release 190. For the years prior to 1976, we esti-
 mated replacement cost following the technique used by Lindenberg
 and Ross (1981), as summarized in the Appendix.

 Accounting measures of replacement cost can cause errors in mea-

 sured q as compared to theoretical q. These errors may be either posi-
 tive or negative. A primary source of positive error is the accounting
 treatment of advertising and research and development expenditures
 as current expenses rather than as the cost of acquiring assets.6 This
 leads to understatement of replacement cost and artificial overstate-
 ment of q. Advertising and research and development assets also give
 rise to rents, which are the object of our investigation. The measure-
 ment problem may obscure and distort the size and sign of the rent
 component attributed to advertising and research and development
 assets. Suppose, for example, that a firm has recorded assets with

 5. Averaging over the beginning and end of each year has been used in order to
 eliminate spurious variation at one point in time in the denominator of q, which is a
 measure computed by accountants of discrete intervals that do not necessarily coincide
 with calendar years.

 6. It is also possible that firm-specific human capital is positively correlated with
 advertising and research and development expenditure, and this intensifies the measure-
 ment error associated with these unreported assets.

 replacement cost T and unrecorded assets with replacement cost C. If
 the firm earns no rents, its measured q will be

 q =1+ C >

 The error due to unrecorded assets is always positive. The excess of q
 over unity is created by this bias and has nothing to do with rents. In
 the absence of rents, the error will always amount to the ratio of
 replacement cost of unrecorded to recorded assets, irrespective of pre-
 vailing expectations. Let us suppose, however, that the acquisition of
 an unrecorded asset costing C gives rise to rents of u per dollar of C.
 Then we have

 q - 1 + C(1 + u)

 T

 Since rents are sensitive to prevailing expectations, q will also vary
 across states, given the level of the bias caused by (CIT). It is clear
 that, if we have a measure of CIT and the relation of q to that measure
 shifts across states, this will testify to the existence of state dependent
 rents associated with the utilization of the unrecorded assets. The mea-
 surements of advertising and research and development intensities,
 which we will discuss below, provide good proxies for the ratio CIT.
 Negative errors in measured q can also arise because of accounting
 practices. If assets are acquired in the form of an existing plant, divi-
 sion, or firm, their acquisition price (and the reported replacement
 cost) may include capitalized rents paid to the seller of the assets. This
 type of accounting practice therefore leads to overstatement of re-
 placement costs and concomitant understatement of q.7

 Another problem of measurement may arise from the accuracy with
 which accountants' estimates of replacement cost reflect changes in
 true replacement cost from one period to the next. As we have argued
 in Section II, the divergence of q from unity will be caused by differen-
 tial response of its numerator (market value) and its denominator (re-
 placement cost) to new opportunities. If markets for real assets adjust
 as rapidly as markets for financial assets, and if accountants accurately
 report the value of the firms' assets according to prices observed in real
 asset markets, then measured and theoretical q will never diverge from
 unity. If, however, accountants are not accurate or are slow to adjust
 their estimates in the face of changing prices in real asset markets, then
 measured q may diverge from unity even if theoretical q does not. This
 is a difficulty that pervades all empirical studies using measured q in
 tests of performance-structure relations. Its effect on the validity of

 7. The understatement of q in this case reflects the portion of rents that was passed to

 the seller of the assets.

 tests depends, however, on whether the inflexibility of accounting esti-
 mates varies across firms and industries and is correlated to structural
 features. The implicit assumption in empirical studies-and ours is no
 exception-is that there is no such correlation.

 B. Time Periods and the "Prevailing State of Expectations"
 The simplest way to capture effects of differences in the "prevailing
 state of expectations" is to repeat tests over different time periods.
 The state of the economy changes over time and so do prevailing
 expectations. In the period 1964-78 (covered by our data), the state of
 the economy underwent substantial change. Common and widely held
 perceptions of the economy's course were buoyant in the 1960s but
 somber in the 1970s. Unfortunately, expectations can rarely be directly
 observed or measured. Economists can only infer the prevailing state
 of expectations from data on economic performance. Since the assess-
 ment of expectations will always involve guesswork, a selective sub-
 division of a 15-year period into subperiods may be criticized as arbi-
 trary or self-serving. We have therefore chosen to divide the sample
 uniformly into 4 adjacent subperiods of equal (or nearly equal) length:
 1964-67, 1968-71, 1972-75, and 1976-77. For each subperiod we have
 computed indices of aggregate economic performance that appear in
 table 1 and that enable us to make an assessment of the prevailing state
 of expectations in prespecified time intervals.

 The data in table 1 suggest that, in comparison to 1964-67, economic

 performance declined substantially in all other subperiods. One-year
 growth rates of gross national product (GNP) and investment mark a
 large downturn after 1964-67. Four-year growth rates decline mono-
 tonically. Capacity utilization drops substantially. Aggregate q also
 declines monotonically. Accordingly, we surmise that the level of ex-
 pectations declined seriously between the first and later subperiods. In
 terms of our tests, this suggests a primary hypothesis.

 HYPOTHESIS 1. The magnitude of response of q to structural fea-

 tures will decline significantly from the first to the other subperiods.

 Differences in performance among the last 3 subperiods are not as
 clear cut or as substantial. Between 1968-71 and the adjacent period
 (1973-75), growth rates are similar, but capacity utilization and aggre-
 gate q decline. Between 1972-75 and the last subperiod (1975-77),
 1-year growth rates increase a good deal, medium-term rates still de-
 cline, capacity utilization is stable, and q falls further. From this mixed
 evidence we can only surmise that there is no firm sign of improvement
 of expectations. In terms of our tests this suggests a secondary hy-
 pothesis.8

 HYPOTHESIS 2. The magnitude of response of q to structural fea-

 tures will not increase over the 3 remaining adjacent subperiods.

 Investors' assessments are influenced both by economy-wide and by
 firm-specific expectations. The latter are not so easy to gauge by an
 index independent of q itself. Previous work suggests that the firm's
 sales growth rate can proxy for firm-specific expectations.9 We have
 computed the 4-year geometric rate of sales growth over the interval
 (t - 4, t) for each year t. In our tests, we use this growth rate both as a
 linear and as an interactive determinant of q, where the interaction is
 modeled between the growth rate and the structural features.

 HYPOTHESIS 3. If firm-specific past growth is an index of the state of
 prevailing expectations, then, according to hypothesis 1, the response
 of q to structural features will be sensitive to the level of this index, and
 interactive terms will be significant.

 C. Sample and Data

 The sample consists of all manufacturing firms that were listed on each
 of the following four files: COMPUSTAT Annual Industrial, COMPUSTAT
 Replacement Cost, Economic Information System (EIS), and Census
 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) four-digit Industry Statistics.
 On the basis of these four files, the following independent variables
 were constructed for each firm and each period.

 CON. This is the weighted average seller concentration ratio. The
 EIS data file tabulates the firm's employment in each of the four-digit
 SIC manufacturing industries in which it has operations. We computed
 the weighted average concentration of the firm's markets by using the
 census four-firm concentration ratios and the EIS employment as
 weights. We computed CON only for 1972 because our EIS file cov-
 ered only 1972. Employment weights were converted to value-added

 8. This hypothesis is secondary in the sense that we attach more importance to the

 primary hypothesis, where differences are much more clear cut and well established.

 9. See Thomadakis (1977), who finds that past growth is a proxy for "valuable growth

 opportunities."

 weights by multiplying each firm's industry employment by the value
 added per employee reported by the census for that industry.

 MAX4. This is the share of output in the four-digit SIC industry

 that accounts for the largest portion of the firm's output. This repre-
 sents the amount of specialization as opposed to diversification. Since
 it was derived from the EIS file, the 1972 value was used for all years.

 G. This is the geometric average growth rate of sales over the past

 4 years, from the COMPUSTAT file.

 ADV. This is the ratio of annual advertising expenditure to annual

 fixed capital expenditures, from the COMPUSTAT file. We chose this ratio
 rather than the usual advertising-to-sales intensity because this ratio
 also proxies for the ratio of unrecorded to recorded assets.

 RD. This is the ratio of annual research and development expendi-

 tures to annual fixed capital expenditure, from the COMPUSTAT file.
 Again, we prefer this ratio to the usual research and development-to-
 sales intensity for the same reason as for advertising.

 D. Test Design

 Two test equations are developed on the basis of equation (7). The first
 is a simple linear equation:

 q = at + a1tCON + a2tMAX4 + a3tADV + a4tRD + a5tG. (8)
 We estimate this equation over the 4 subperiods (t = 1964-67, 1968-
 71, 1972-75, 1976-78). If there is, as we surmise, a substantial decline
 in prevailing expectations between 1964-67 and the other subperiods,
 we should obtain

 ai,1964-67 > ait, (9)

 where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, as in equation (8) above, and t represents each of
 the subperiods 1968-71, 1972-75, and 1976-78. If there is also, as we
 surmise, nonimprovement but possible further deterioration of the
 state of expectations over the last 3 subperiods, we should obtain

 ai,1968_71 > ai,1972-75 > ai,1976-78, (10)

 where i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

 The linear growth term G should make a positive contribution to q if

 past sales growth proxies for future prospects. Thus, we should obtain

 a5t > O. (11)

 The possibility that past growth conveys information about firm-spe-
 cific expectations leads to the specification of our second test equation:
 q = aot + a1tCON + a2tMAX4 + a3tADV + a4tRD + a5tG

 ? b1t(CON G) + 2b2t(MAX4 * G) (12)
 ? hdtADV * G) + h4I(RD * G.

 If firm-specific growth expectations interact with structural features
 over and above economy-wide expectations, then the addition of the
 four interactive terms in (12) will enhance the explanatory power of the
 regressions. Further, if firm-specific growth rates signify expectations
 of business prospects in the given line of business, our hypothesis of
 differential response of q to structural features implies that we should
 obtain

 for all i and t.10

 bit > 0 (13)

 IV. Empirical Results

 The results of estimation of equation (8) are shown in table 2. Most of
 the independent variables are statistically significant determinants of q
 in each of the 4 subperiods. In fact, the four regressions as a whole are
 also statistically significant (with respective F-statistics of 11.35, 13.77,
 32.65, and 49.64). Growth and research and development expenditure
 ratios are significant in every period. The other three variables (CON,
 ADV, MAX4) are each significant in 3 out of 4 periods.

 In order to test hypothesis 1 (to see whether coefficients of later

 subperiods are lower than those of 1964-67), we have adopted the
 following procedures. Data from each later subperiod have been
 pooled with those of the first subperiod. Two regressions have been
 estimated in each case: a restricted one that forces coefficients to be
 the same in both subperiods, and an unrestricted one that (by including
 a dummy variable on the intercept and slopes for the later subperiod)
 allows for different coefficients. In this fashion, we can test whether
 the unrestricted regression is more powerful than the restricted one.
 We can also test whether differences in the coefficient of each variable
 between the first and later subperiods are significant. The results of
 these tests are shown in panel A of table 3.

 The findings shown in panel A indicate the following. The hypothesis

 that the response of q to structural features declines after 1964-67 is
 accepted for all subsequent subperiods in the case of concentration and
 the research and development expenditure ratio. It is also accepted in 2
 of the 3 subperiods in the case of the specialization index MAX4. It is
 not accepted, however, for the advertising expenditure ratio. This vari-
 able is notably the only one that obtains an insignificant coefficient in
 1964-67.11

 10. This assertion is valid insofar as we are not dealing with growth of a specific firm in

 new areas of business that are unrelated to its current activities.

 11. One problem with this variable in 1964-67 specifically is that there are a large

 number of zero values, which means either that expenditure was insignificant or that it
 went unreported.

 * Significant at the 5% level.

 In order to test hypothesis 2 (to see whether coefficients are nonin-
 creasing in successive subperiods starting from 1968-71), we have fol-
 lowed the same procedure described above for hypothesis 1. The re-
 sults of tests are shown in panel B of table 3. In no case was there a
 coefficient increase in any period relative to the previous one. In fact,
 the coefficients for the specialization index MAX4 and the RD expendi-
 ture ratio show significant declines. On the other hand, the coefficients
 of concentration and the advertising expenditure ratio show no signifi-
 cant change. We conclude that hypothesis 2 must be accepted.

 Finally, with respect to hypothesis 3 about the effect of firm growth,

 it is clear from the last column of table 2 that it is accepted in every
 subperiod. It is worth noting from table 3 that the coefficient of firm-
 specific growth is substantially larger in the first subperiod than in the
 remaining three. This suggests that economy-wide expectations inter-
 act with firm-specific expectations in a positive direction.

 The finding of a positive and significant role of growth in the determi-
 nation of q can now be followed up by a test of the interactive equation
 (12). The results from this equation are shown in table 4.

 The estimation of interactive coefficients bit leads to ambiguous re-

 sults. Eleven of the bit coefficients obtain positive values, of which only
 seven are significantly different from zero. Five coefficients obtain
 negative values, of which three are significant. Tests of significance,
 however, are probably erroneous because there are severe collin-
 earities present between the interactive and the linear terms as well as
 among the interactive terms themselves.

 Despite the mixed evidence on coefficients bit, two more points are
 available from the estimation of equation (12). The first is that the
 addition of the interactive terms enhances the explanatory power of the
 regression. The F-test on the additional explained variation is signifi-
 cant in each subperiod. 12 The second is that, if we compute the slope of
 q with respect to the structural features from equation (12), its average
 value declines as we move from the first to the last subperiods. In table
 5 we show these average values. Thus, the introduction of interactive
 terms does not overturn the conclusions that we reached from equation
 (8).

 V. Conclusions

 The thesis of this paper is that the relation of Tobin's q to structural
 features of firms is state dependent. This dependence arises because of
 the relation between structural features and mobility barriers. Our em-
 pirical work confirms this state dependence strongly. The response of q
 to concentration, firm specialization, and advertising and research and
 development expenditure varies over time and across firms, as prevail-
 ing expectations also appear to vary. As expectations decline, so do
 the response coefficients. These findings suggest four points.

 1. With regard to methodology, the use of Tobin's q in industrial
 organizations studies must take account of the role of investor expecta-
 tions. Estimations arrived at in a particular time period may not be
 valid in another when the expectational context has changed.

 2. Structural features, such as those tested here, may convey differ-
 ent effects in different times because they can proxy either for barriers
 to entry or for exit barriers.

 12. F-statistics are, respectively, as follows: 1964-67, F(3,964) = 6.39; 1968-71,

 F(3,1060) = 15.18; 1972-75, F(3,1090) = 27.69; and 1976-78, F(3,1086) = 9.85.

 3. Firm-specific expectations, proxied here by past sales growth, are
 a significant determinant of q. The weight of the evidence obtained
 here is that they interact with structural features, and this suggests that
 "growth opportunities" are interlinked to such features. This is an area
 that warrants additional research. Another interesting finding is that
 the effect of firm-specific expectations on q is itself conditioned by the
 economy-wide expectational context.

 4. The role of industry concentration in the determination of q is
 quite variable, shifting from positive to negative over different time
 periods. This clearly argues that the significance that policy has at-
 tached to concentration as an index of acquisition of monopoly rents is
 misplaced. Not only is concentration no guarantee of positive rents,
 but also its role in the overall determination of rents appears rather
 minor. 13

 5. As a last point, we should recall the caveat about measurement
 errors in observed q.'4 The denominator is a number computed by
 accountants. Its slower response to expectations than the response of
 market values in the numerator of q has been interpreted in this paper
 as a sign of the lack of mobility of resources. An alternative possibility
 is that slower response is due to the inflexibility not of resources but of
 accountants. In that case, our findings would imply that accountants'
 responses are systematically different in firms with different structural
 characteristics. It is hard to judge whether this is likely and whether
 such hypothetical behavioral differences are unrelated to underlying
 resource immobilities. In any event, this suggests an interesting subject
 for additional research.

 Appendix

 Computation of q for Years Prior to 1976-78

 The denominator of q, replacement cost of assets (RC), was computed by
 adding two adjustment factors (one for net plant and equipment and one for
 inventory) to the book value of each company's total assets. For the years
 1976-78, the adjustment factors were obtained directly from the COMPUSTAT
 Replacement Cost file. For years prior to 1976, the adjustment factors had to be
 estimated. The following notation is used to explain the adjustment process for
 each company j and year t:

 13. Our findings on concentration furnish different insights on a contradiction that
 Hirschey (1985) finds between his own results and those of Thomadakis (1977). Thoma-
 dakis's tests used data from the mid-1960s. Hirschey's tests used data from the mid-
 1970s. The former found positive and the latter negative concentration effects on variants
 of q. Our tests confirm both and underline the point that the effect of concentration on q
 is dependent on the expectational context.

 14. We thank an anonymous referee for persuasively bringing this point to our atten-

 tion.

 TAjt = total assets using historical cost (HC) values;
 HNPjt = net plant and equipment using HC values;
 RNPjt = net plant and equipment using RC values;
 HINVJ, = inventory using HC values;
 RINVit = inventory using RC values;
 lit = capital expenditures;
 CDjt = current depreciation using HC values;
 djt = CDjt/HNPt-1;
 Pt = capital goods price index (GNP deflator for nonresidential fixed

 investment used);

 Mi = constant component of technical progress;
 gt = time-dependent component of technical progress; and
 RCjt = TAjt + (RNPjt - HNPjt) + (RINVjt - HINVit).

 1. Net plant adjustment. The values of TAjt, HNPjt, and DEPjt were available
 for all years on COMPUSTAT. The values of RNPjt and RINVit were available for
 only 3 years (1976-78) on the COMPUSTAT Replacement Cost File. The value of
 mjt was not observable but was esimated for 2 years (1977 and 1978) using the
 following relations to solve for mj:

 RNPj78 = RNPi77 (1 + P78)/(l + dj78) (1 + mJ78) + I78, (Al)
 RNPj77 = RNP176 (1 + P77)/(1 + d77) (1 + mJ77) + I77. (A2)

 The average of the two solutions, mj = (mJ78 + mJ77 + mJ77)12, was used as the
 company component of technical progress. A time-dependent component of
 technical progress, gt, was taken from the annual estimates of economy-wide
 technical progress made by Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1981). Technical prog-
 ress for each company in each year mjt was obtained by adding to mj the
 difference between our sample-wide average mj (call it m) and the time-depen-
 dent component gt:

 Mit = my + (gt - m). (A3)
 This assured that our sample-wide average technical progress in each year
 prior to 1976 would be equal to the economy-wide technical progress estimated
 by Jorgenson and Fraumeni. Equation (A3) shows each company's specific
 component plus an economy-wide, time-dependent component.

 In order to obtain RNPjt for years prior to 1976, the backward recursion was
 performed starting with the solution for RNPJ-75. The recursion was as follows:

 RNPj76 = RNPJ75 (1 + P76)I(1 + d176) (1 + mJ76) + I76,

 RNPj65 = RNPj64 (1 + p65)/0 + di65) (1 + mJ65) + I65-

 2. Inventory Adjustment. For companies using the first in, first out (FIFO)
 accounting method, RC inventory was identical to the HC inventory:

 RINVjt = HINVjt.

 When FIFO was not used, the adjustment was based on the average costing of
 inventory in which

 RINVit = HINVjt 2Ptl(Pt + Pt - 1),

 where P, is a price index for inventory. Since no price index specific to inven-
