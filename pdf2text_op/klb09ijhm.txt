Given the importance of a ﬁrm’s performance, which is of signiﬁcant interest to many groups of people
including management, shareholders and governments, this study aims to examine the impact of brand
recognition and brand reputation on ﬁrm performance within the U.S. multinational restaurant
company context. The study ﬁndings suggest that brand reputation, in general, has a positive inﬂuence
on a ﬁrm’s value performance but no signiﬁcant relationship with accounting performance. Brand
recognition shows no signiﬁcant relationship with both value and accounting performance measures
controlling for the degree of internationalization of a multinational restaurant company.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been tremendous and sustained growth
in international business. Over 78,000 multinational enterprises
(MNEs) as well as their 780,000 foreign afﬁliates have been
identiﬁed by the United Nations in 2006 (United Nations, 2007),
and about one third of world trade is within multinational
companies (Friedman, 2006).
In this borderless world, many
companies compete not only domestically but also internationally
against products and services from abroad. Daniels et al. (2007)
summarized seven factors that induced globalization: (1) increase in
and expansion of technology, (2) liberalization of cross-border trade
and resource movements, (3) development of services that support
international business, (4) growing consumer pressures on foreign
goods and services, (5) increased global competition, (6) changing
political situations, and (7) expanded cross-national cooperation.

The hospitality industry is not excluded from this trend of
globalization. Seeking the growth opportunities, many domes-
tically started hotels and restaurants have expanded their
operations overseas. According to HOTELS Giants Survey 2008,
the top 15 companies in most countries are operating 34,067 units

in total from 31 (Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts) to 100 countries
(InterContinental Hotels Group). The Standard & Poor’s Restau-
rant Industry Survey (Basham and Menza, 2007) indicates that
overseas expansion of fast-food chains is one of industry trends;
McDonald’s generated about two thirds of its revenue from
overseas markets in 2006, and Yum! Brand generated about 42%.
In their review of strategic management research in the
hospitality industry, Olsen and Roper (1998) indicated inter-
nationalization as one of the four main areas of strategy research;
others being strategic planning, competition and competitive
advantage, and strategic implementation.

Observing the phenomenon of internationalization and its
impacts on business organizations, scholars have developed
theories as to why internationalization occurs and persists.
Transaction cost theory and internalization theory are represen-
tative theories of internationalization, along with agency costs
theory and imperfect capital market theory in economics literature
(Mishra and Gobeli, 1998; Riahi-Belkaoui, 2004; Saudagaran,
2002). However, the two traditional theories (i.e., transaction cost
theory and internalization theory) were criticized by researchers in
the 1990s partly due to the weakness of the logic itself and the
limited explanatory power in the most recent business environ-
ments (Kapler, 2007; Kogut and Zander, 1993; Rugman and
Verbeke, 2003). Accordingly, new theories have emerged and these
include the resource-based view (Barney, 1991), the evolutionary
theory (Kogut and Zander, 1993), the theory of
innovative
enterprise (Lazonick, 2002a,b), and the theory on the various
advantages of internationalization (Nolan et al., 2002).

The transaction cost and internalization theories have tradi-
tionally focused on manufacturing companies, often emphasizing
intangible assets or knowledge, and thus were not directly
applicable to the hospitality industry due to the industry’s
comparatively low level of intangible assets or knowledge. The
theory of Nolan et al. (2002), however, shows a potential
applicability to the hospitality industry. They pointed out that
one of the competitive advantages successful giant international
corporations have in common is brand that is spread through the
globalized mass media. Brand is an important aspect for restaurant
corporations and has been extensively examined in the hospitality
literature (e.g., Laroche and Parsa, 2000; O’Neill and Mattila, 2004;
O’Neill and Xiao, 2006). Therefore, the purpose of the current study
is to examine the impact of brand on the ﬁnancial performance of
U.S. multinational restaurant companies.

Although this study conjectures and tests traditional brand
recognition as an important factor for multinational restaurant
companies, the study also introduces another interesting aspect of
brand: brand reputation. Good reputation is considered as a critical
business asset that brings sustained business success (Barney,
1991; Deephouse, 2000; Riahi-Belkaoui, 2003; Strike et al., 2006).
This study argues that such brand reputation makes its own unique
impact on ﬁrm performance of multinational restaurant compa-
nies in addition to brand recognition.
In examining brand
reputation,
the current study adopted the corporate social
responsibility (CSR) index as a proxy due to its signiﬁcant and
growing importance in building brand reputation in recent years.
By encompassing the two components of brand (i.e., brand
recognition and brand reputation) for U.S. multinational restaurant
companies, it would be meaningful to investigate the separate
effects of the two factors in relation to the ﬁrm’s performances,
which has been a keen interest of stakeholders, managers, and
many others. The study next presents the literature review and
methodology, followed by the results and discussion. Limitations
and suggested future research conclude the study.

2. Literature review

2.1. Internationalization related theories

2.1.1. Imperfect capital market theory

The imperfect capital market theory is based on the ﬁnancial
theory of portfolio diversiﬁcation and links the diversiﬁcation to
riskiness. The portfolio diversiﬁcation theory developed by
Markowitz (1959) argues that investors diversify their portfolio
in order to reduce the risks that accompany their investing
activities. Along the same lines, the imperfect capital markets
theory suggests that investors prefer multinational enterprises
over domestic ﬁrms because they ﬁnd that the investment in the
MNEs is a means of diversifying their portfolio internationally. As
the name of the theory implies, the logic of the theory is rooted in
the imperfection of the market. In global capital markets, the
market is not perfectly efﬁcient, and investors are limited by
institutional constraints on international capital ﬂows, informa-
tion asymmetries, and other challenges. In order to mitigate this
handicap, investors choose to invest in MNEs, expecting the value
of the MNEs to increase (Agmon and Lessard, 1977; Doukas and
Travlos, 1988; Errunza and Senbet, 1981; Fatemi, 1984).

2.1.2. Agency cost theory (a.k.a. managerial objectives theory)

Alternative streams of theories on MNEs focus on international
diversiﬁcation and proﬁtability. The agency cost theory, also called
the managerial objectives theory, sees the relationship as negative.
The theory argues that different objectives and motives exist
between management and shareholders. Thus, management may
pursue their own interest and short-term pecuniary gains ahead of

those of shareholders and long-term value enhancement (Jensen
and Meckling, 1976). As the corporation is more complex, it would
be more difﬁcult for shareholders to monitor managers’ manage-
ment activities whether they act in the shareholders’ interest or in
their own self-interests at the expense of shareholders. In other
words, managers may favor international diversiﬁcation because
the multinational companies are usually more complex. This
difference of interest between shareholders and managers, mixed
with information asymmetry, may lead to a reduction in the value
of multinationals relative to that of domestic ﬁrms (Morck and
Yeung, 1991).

2.1.3. Transaction cost and internalization theory

The transaction cost theory and the internalization theory stem
from theories focusing on the ﬁrm itself rather than on the market
and discusses how multinational ﬁrms emerged and how they
function. The two fundamentals are Coase’s The Nature of the Firm
(1937) and Hymer’s doctoral dissertation (1960), which was
published in 1976.

Coase proposed that a ﬁrm can minimize transaction costs,
which would occur if transacted through markets, by vertically
allocating productive resources within a ﬁrm. He valued the cost
effectiveness of the internalized transactions that a ﬁrm brings in
vertical integration within the organization. Based on the concept
that Coase introduced in 1937, Hymer (1960) analyzed the
territorial expansion of MNEs with two main questions: (1)
How do MNEs successfully engage in production in a foreign
country competing with local ﬁrms that enjoy local advantages;
and (2) Why do ﬁrms choose foreign direct investment rather than
selling or licensing technology to local ﬁrms. His argument was
that MNEs with ﬁrm-speciﬁc advantages such as patents, brand
names, or economies of scale favor foreign direct investment
because the advantage would lead to maximization of the proﬁt
and reduction of the competition.

Following Hymer (1960), transaction cost economists and
internalization economists emerged during the 1970s led by
Williamson (1975) and Buckley and Casson (1976), respectively.
Both groups of scholars developed their theories paying attention
to the intangible assets of MNEs and the competitive structure of
the asset transfer across borders, but their approaches on the
explanation are not the same.

Williamson (1975) focused on the transaction cost involved in
the transfer of the intangible asset and characterized transaction
using three dimensions:
frequency, uncertainty, and asset
speciﬁcity. The more frequently a business, department, or service
is used, the greater the uncertainty involved in a contract or
partnership, and the more valuable the assets in a speciﬁc
transaction, the more likely it is that the transaction costs will
be lower in a hierarchical organization than the market. Other
things being equal, he argued that when transactions involve the
three dimensions (frequency, uncertainty, and asset speciﬁcity),
transaction cost would be reduced by a private business entity’s
vertical integration than by the market. He also argued that the
more complex or new the technology or knowledge, the higher the
transaction costs; therefore, MNE is a solution for minimizing the
transaction costs.

Buckley and Casson (1976) explained a rise of MNEs through
the failure of the market in intangible asset transactions. Multi-
national enterprises choose to expand internally and invest
directly in a foreign country by setting up subsidiaries rather
than expanding externally by issuing licenses to foreign partners
when the ﬁrms possess ﬁrm-speciﬁc intangible assets. Examples of
such assets include superior research and development (R&D)
capability, production skills, patents, managerial skills, marketing
abilities, and consumer goodwill
(Morck and Yeung, 1992;
Saudagaran, 2002). The gains from the internal expansion can


622

Y. Koh et al. / International Journal of Hospitality Management 28 (2009) 620–630

be greater than those of external expansion because the transfer of
intangible assets tends to be difﬁcult to duplicate and requires
higher transaction costs to external parties. The beneﬁts from the
internalization will accordingly lead to enhanced market value
(Chen, 2005; Mishra and Gobeli, 1998; Riahi-Belkaoui, 2004).

The internalization theory was expanded in the 1980s by
scholars including Rugman and Dunning, and rigorous explana-
tions of the existence and functioning of MNEs have been proposed
by them. They concentrated on explaining the reasons why cross-
border transactions in intermediate products are coordinated
within MNE hierarchies, rather than through external markets.

2.1.4. Theories after 1990

The transaction cost and internalization theories ﬂourished
during the 1970s and 1980s, but those were insufﬁcient to explain
all forms of MNEs. Escaping from the traditional view of hierarchy,
companies started approaching the overseas investment from the
perspective of
international alliances. Through international
networking, MNEs tried to obtain the beneﬁts such as risk-sharing,
cost-sharing, growing importance of inter-sectional technology,
search for new products, penetration of markets, and organiza-
tional
learning opportunities (Belussi and Arcangeli, 1998;
Hagedoorn, 1996; Kapler, 2007).

Accordingly, the focus of the internationalization theories
veered away from the transfer of knowledge assets to the
production of knowledge assets (Kapler, 2007) as limitations of
the transaction cost theory/internalization theory arose with the
change of the social and technological context. The weaknesses of
the transaction cost/internalization theory can be summarized as
follows (Kapler, 2007; Kogut and Zander, 1993; Rugman and
Verbeke, 2003):

(1) In practice, it is very difﬁcult to neatly separate productions
costs from transaction costs, and hard to measure the
transaction costs even if they can be deﬁned;

(2) The decision making process is not always rational due to the
conﬂict of interest among managers, or between managers and
shareholders, and so on;

(3) Only one-way ﬂow of knowledge from headquarters to
subsidiaries has been considered, whereas apparent two-
way ﬂows or ﬂows among subsidiaries have been largely
observed as well; and

(4) Reputation and trust are not considered although these play an

important role in business success.

By understanding these limitations, scholars developed new
theories. The most noteworthy examples are the resource-based
view of Barney (1991), the evolutionary theory of Kogut and
Zander (1993), the theory of the innovative enterprise of Lazonick
(2002a,b), and the theory emphasizing the advantages of inter-
nationalization introduced by Nolan et al. (2002). Whereas the
former theories before 1990 placed their interest in the transfer of
knowledge assets, the newer theories view the production of assets
as an essential nutrient for the growth and value maximization of a
ﬁrm. Although the newer theories invariably consider possession
and development of the high-quality intangible assets as a critical
issue of MNE, the approach varies by theory, as reviewed next.

2.1.4.1. The resource-based view. The resource-based view is based
on Penrose’s (1956) theory that treats MNE as a bundle of
resources, but expands the theory by categorizing the resources
into marketing, production, R&D, and home country-based knowl-
edge (Barney, 1991; Kay, 2000). These resources are used in
determining the direction of a ﬁrm’s expansion among further
product specialization, product diversiﬁcation, or foreign produc-
tion. The resource-based theory favors domestic expansion

through product specialization or diversiﬁcation to foreign
production, arguing that the most efﬁcient resource linkages are
to be found in domestic expansion. However, if foreign production
is selected as the most suitable method of expansion, the ﬁrm
should consider modes such as subcontracting, licensing, joint
venture, or franchise.

2.1.4.2. The evolutionary theory. Regarding the evolutionary the-
ory, Kogut and Zander (1993) depicted ﬁrms as social communities
that create tacit knowledge as well as transfer that knowledge
across borders. Market failure is not a necessary factor of the
theory, but the knowledge gain beneﬁts from expansion to foreign
markets are important considerations. The theory purports that
ﬁrms gradually accumulate and recombine knowledge throughout
their multinational network and create future competitive
possibilities. However, the mode of the knowledge transfer
depends on the unique characteristics of each ﬁrm, and efﬁciency
is great in the case of foreign production, but not in licensing.

innovative enterprise. Lazonick (2002a,b),
2.1.4.3. The theory of
introducing his theory of innovative enterprise, argued that the
conventional neoclassical theory such as the transaction cost
theory failed to explain the phenomenon that one or a small
number of ﬁrms can dominate an industry. According to the theory
of innovative enterprise, a monopoly ﬁrm’s large size allows the
ﬁrm to sell more output at a lower price while not being
constrained to produce the proﬁt-maximizing output. The
innovative enterprises may be further subject to increasing costs
in the short term by confronting and transforming the technolo-
gical and market conditions, but eventually generate higher
quality, lower costs products. In order to accomplish this goal,
the innovative ﬁrm requires social conditions which are composed
of a ﬁnancial commitment to sustain until generating ﬁnancial
returns, organizational
integration that creates incentives for
employees’ skills and efforts, and strategic control over the
ﬁnancial commitment and organizational integration.

2.1.4.4. Theory on various advantages of internationalization. Some
other scholars such as Nolan et al. (2002) challenged the prior
economic theories by putting their focus on the advantages of
international operations across borders, rather than emphasizing
transfer of knowledge and transaction costs. Nolan et al. (2002)
highlighted the global business revolution of the 1990s that lead to
the evolution of a small number of giant corporations dominating
the market. The drivers for this evolution include the liberalization
of trade and capital ﬂows, privatization, collapse of communism,
advantages in IT, and migration. They argued that the successful
giant ﬁrms possess competitive advantages through various
sources, including ‘‘core business’’ developed by narrowing down
the business activity, ‘‘brand’’ enhanced by global mass media,
largely increased ‘‘R&D,’’ ‘‘IT’’ expenditures, centralized ‘‘procure-
ment,’’ ‘‘ﬁnancial resources’’ raised by investors who shifted to
global ﬁrms, or ‘‘merger frenzy’’ that helped the growth of large
corporations.

This, the last approach proposed by Nolan et al. (2002), best
explains the global expansion of multinational hospitality ﬁrms,
including multinational restaurant companies, because (1) the
giant-size characteristic of the multinational restaurant companies
ﬁts to the theory, and (2) the restaurant companies have paid less
attention to possession or development of tacit knowledge
compared to traditional manufacturing ﬁrms. Dev et al. (2002)
argued regarding multinational hotel companies that possible loss
of knowledge is not the hotel ﬁrms’ concern; effective transfer or
deployment of knowledge is the main concern because it is critical
to maintain consistency of brand image and operations. Mean-
while, possession or development of tacit knowledge has been


Y. Koh et al. / International Journal of Hospitality Management 28 (2009) 620–630

623

taken seriously by the international expansion strategy of
conventional manufacturing ﬁrms and mainstream international
business theories, and the studies have used R&D expenditure as
a main proxy for intangible assets as well as advertising
expenditure.

Among the competitive advantages that Nolan et al. (2002)
indicated, brand is one of the most representative beneﬁts for
multinational restaurant companies both in general and in an
international setting. That is why brand has been actively studied
in the hospitality context (e.g., Laroche and Parsa, 2000; O’Neill
and Mattila, 2004; O’Neill and Xiao, 2006). As compared to the
signiﬁcance of brand in multinational restaurant companies, the
volume of R&D or IT expenditures of multinational restaurant
companies is relatively small (as compared to that of pharma-
ceutical or auto companies,
for example), and thus is not
applicable to multinational restaurant companies. Also, procure-
ment is an intangible asset that is difﬁcult to ﬁnd reasonable
proxies for (Morck and Yeung, 1991), and ﬁnancial resources and
merger frenzy are societal trends that make the appropriate data
obtained under the multinational restaurant setting very limited
and sparse.

Regarding the concept of brand, brand recognition and
reputation are perceived to be two important factors a company
should essentially hold for its sustainable success (Blumenthal and
Bergstrom, 2003). We adopted and examined these two factors to
represent a restaurant ﬁrm’s brand. According to Denekamp
(1995), advertising expenditures create ﬁrm-speciﬁc assets in the
form of brand recognition. We,
therefore, use advertising
expenditures as a proxy for brand recognition in our model.
Brown (1997) connects a company’s reputation with corporate
social performance (CSP); he advocated that companies with a
positive reputation for CSP have a stronger ability to develop more
loyal customers, employees, and suppliers. Porter and Kramer
(2006) also argued that CSR initiatives are often justiﬁed by
companies that they improve a company’s image and strengthen
its brand. Following these studies, we measure a restaurant ﬁrm’s
CSR participation as a proxy for brand reputation.

2.2. International issues in hospitality literature

Considering that

the current study is dealing with the
restaurant industry, which is a subsector of the hospitality
industry, and to clarify the contribution of this study to the
hospitality literature, it would be meaningful to review prior
hospitality studies in regard to internationalization. In accordance
with the main purpose of this study, the review of hospitality
literature focuses on the ﬁnance/economic issues that relate to
ﬁrm performance. Four leading hospitality journals were selected
for this review as they were in a study by Hu and Racherla (2008).
The four journals and the database sources used for the review and
the examining period for each journal are as follows:

(1) International

Journal of Hospitality Management

(http://
www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02784319) from the
ﬁrst issue in 1982 to the September issue of 2008;

(2) Cornell Hospitality Quarterly (http://www.sciencedirect.com/
science/journal/00108804) from the ﬁrst issue in 1960 to the
May issue of 2008;

(3) Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research (http://www.sage-
pub.com/journal.aspx?pid=102) from the ﬁrst issue in 1976 to
the May issue of 2008; and

(4) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management

(http://www.emeraldinsight.com/info/journals/ijchm.jsp)
from the ﬁrst issue in 1989 to the fourth issue of 2008.

This study categorizes the international ﬁnance/economic-
related hospitality studies by the sub-sector of business, namely,
hotel, restaurant, and hospitality in general. As presented in
Table 1, international ﬁnance/economic issues have been con-
tinually researched in the hospitality context, and articles on the
subject seem to appear more frequently in recent years. It is also
evident that the hotel
industry has been more extensively
researched than the restaurant industry and appeared repeatedly
in the four leading hospitality journals. Although various inter-
national ﬁnance/economic related topics have been examined, the

impact of brand on ﬁrm’s performance, especially considering the
separate impacts of brand recognition and brand reputation, have
not been investigated. The review of the hospitality literature
supports the need of the current study to ﬁll the gap and enrich the
literature.

3. Methodology

This section begins with the description of the model selected in
the current study. The explanation of the main variables and
control variables included in the model follows, whereas the data
collection concludes the section.

3.1. Model

This study examines a relationship of brand recognition and
brand reputation with ﬁrm performance based on Nolan et al.’s
theory of various advantages of internationalization. In particular,
an inverted U-shaped relationship is hypothesized based on
projections that a ﬁrm would initially take beneﬁts from enhancing
its brand recognition and reputation (i.e., positive impact), but
such beneﬁts would diminish and eventually be outweighed by
costs as the ﬁrm exceeds an optimal level of such investments (i.e.,
no or negative impact). Moreover, if a linear relationship, in fact,
empirically exists, an examination of an inverted U-shaped
relationship will most likely reveal such linearity, but not vice
versa.

The model

is constructed to test this inverted U-shaped
relationship from the two aspects of brand (i.e., brand recognition
and brand reputation) with ﬁrm performance, controlling for
degree of internationalization. Based on the literature review,
brand recognition is measured by advertising expenditure
(Denekamp, 1995) and brand reputation by the CSR index (Brown,
1997; Porter and Kramer, 2006). In examining ﬁrm performances,
the study employed two frequently used performance measures:
Tobin’s Q, a value performance measure, and return on assets
(ROA), an accounting performance measure. The study performs
Newey–West analysis because the test effectively corrects the
autocorrelation issue that might be imbedded in the time sequence
of the sample observation as well as the heteroscedasticity issue
(Gujarati, 2003).

where FP represents ﬁrm performance of multinational restaurant
companies, estimated by two different measurements, Q and ROA;
Q is calculated as (MVE + PS + DEBT)/TA, where MVE is the market
value of a ﬁrm’s equity [=(stock price)  (number of shares
outstanding)], PS is a ﬁrm’s preferred stock liquidating value, DEBT
is the value of the ﬁrm’s short-term liabilities net of short-term
assets, plus the book value of the long-term debt, and TA is the
book value of the ﬁrm’s total assets (Chung and Pruitt, 1994); ROA
is return on assets, deﬁned as Operating Income Before
Depreciation (OIBD) divided by total asset; BRC represents brand
recognition, estimated by log of advertisement expenditure; BRC2
represents the quadratic form of BRC; BRP represents brand
reputation, measured by the corporate social responsibility index
from KLD STATS; BRP2 represents the quadratic form of BRP; DOI
represents degree of internationalization, estimated by dividing
the number of
foreign properties by the number of total
properties; SIZE represents ﬁrm size, estimated by log of sales;
LEVERAGE represents a ﬁrm’s capital structure, estimated by debt-
to-equity ratio; MARKET represents market condition, estimated
by the year-end S&P 500 Composite Index, and e represents an
error term.

3.2. Dependent variables

This study examines ﬁrm performance as a dependent variable.
To estimate ﬁrm performance, the study selects two frequently
used ﬁnancial measures to fully investigate the impact of BRC and
BRP on ﬁnancial performance. The two ﬁnancial measurements
include a value performance, Tobin’s Q, and an accounting
performance, ROA.

The two measurements have frequently been used in hospi-
tality studies as well as in mainstream ﬁnancial studies. First,
Tobin’s Q has been chosen as a ﬁnancial performance measure-
ment by researchers for two reasons: (1) it most adequately
reﬂects the stock market value, by comparing the market value
with the value of a company’s assets; and (2) it has been selected as
a measurement for ﬁrm value of multinational companies either in
CSR studies or in other international business studies (Christophe,
1997; Christophe and Pfeiffer, 2002; Dowell et al., 2000; Mishra
and Gobeli, 1998; Morck and Yeung, 1991). Second, ROA has been
recognized as a traditional accounting performance measurement
and is often used in international business and hospitality studies
(e.g., Chaganti and Damanpour, 1991; Gu and Kim, 2001).

3.3. Main variables

Two main variables were selected based on the literature
review: (1) advertising expenditure for brand recognition (BRC)
and (2) CSR index for brand reputation (BRP). Quadratic forms of
each main variable were also included in the model in order to
examine an inverted U-shaped relationship. In calculating the
quadratic forms of BRC and BRP, mean-centered method was used
to alleviate a possible multicollinearity issue: a mean value of
BRC(BRP) was calculated and subsequently the difference between
each observation and the mean value was squared to create the
quadratic forms (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001).

First, BRC represents brand recognition, estimated by log of
advertisement expenditure. The study uses the natural log of
advertisement expenditure following a typical statistical practice to
alleviate violation of the normality assumption in ﬁnancial studies
(e.g., Hua and Upneja, 2007; Leung and Lee, 2006; Walsh et al., 2004).
The advertisement expenditure ﬁgures were found in 10-Ks of the
multinational restaurant companies examined in the current paper.
BRP represents brand reputation, estimated by the corporate
social responsibility index from KLD STATS. It provides snapshots
of a company’s environmental, social, and governance perfor-
mance on a yearly basis. It rates both strength and concerns for
approximately 80 indicators under the following seven issue areas:
community, corporate governance, diversity, employee relations,
environment, human rights, and product. In addition, it rates
concerns for the following controversial issues: alcohol, gambling,
ﬁrearms, military, nuclear power, and tobacco.

The KLD rating database is built up throughout the year using a
variety of sources including surveys, ﬁnancial statements, articles
on companies in the popular press, academic journals, and
government reports. At the end of each year, the compiled set
of data is rated by independent industry experts or issue
specialists. The multiple attributes are rated on a binary scale; 1
is assigned if a strength or concern is detected at a company for
either positive or negative issues and 0 when no strength or
concern is found. In this study, the score 1 for the concern rating
was transformed into  1 in summing up the ﬁnal score for each
company, for each year.

3.4. Control variables

The study includes four control variables in the model: degree
of internationalization (DOI), ﬁrm size (SIZE), capital structure


Y. Koh et al. / International Journal of Hospitality Management 28 (2009) 620–630

625

(LEVERAGE), and market condition (MARKET). The DOI represents
the proportional level of international operations of multinational
restaurant ﬁrms and was included to eliminate its possible
confounding impact on the relationship between main factors
(BRC and BRP) and ﬁrm performance because its positive impact on
ﬁrm value of hotel companies has been found (Lee, 2008). It was
estimated by the number of foreign properties compared to the
number of total properties based on the information obtained at
10-Ks of each company in each year.

Prior studies that took a similar approach to the current study
also had controls for ﬁrm size, leverage, and industry dummies in
their studies (Mishra and Gobeli, 1998; Riahi-Belkaoui, 2004;
Strike et al., 2006; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Inclusion of
industry dummies is not applicable to this study because the
current study focuses solely on the restaurant industry.

Firm size (SIZE) is included in the model to control for any
systematic effect of ﬁrm size on ﬁrm performance. SIZE is
estimated by the natural log of sales following a typical statistical
practice to alleviate violation of the normality assumption in
ﬁnancial studies (e.g., Hua and Upneja, 2007; Leung and Lee, 2006;
Walsh et al., 2004). A positive relationship between SIZE and ﬁrm
performance is expected based on previous research results. Lee
(2008) found a positive relationship between ﬁrm size and Tobin’s
Q for multinational U.S. lodging ﬁrms, and Lee and Upneja (2008)
found a negative relationship between lodging ﬁrm size and cost of
equity capital, suggesting a positive relationship between lodging
ﬁrm size and ﬁrm value. Berk (1995) found a negative relationship
between ﬁrm size and beta, which would suggest a positive
relationship between ﬁrm size and ﬁrm value.

leverage ratio (LEVERAGE)

To control for capital structure of a multinational restaurant
ﬁrm,
is included in the model.
Modigliani and Miller (1958) suggested a positive relationship
between ﬁnancial leverage and cost of capital, thus a negative
relationship between ﬁnancial leverage and ﬁrm value is expected.
MARKET represents market condition, estimated by the year-end
S&P 500 Composite Index. It is included in the model to control for
any systematic effect of market conditions that may confound the
relationship between main factors and ﬁrm performance.

3.5. Data collection

The study collected the data from four sources: (1) the KLD
STATS for CSR data, (2) Compustat for ﬁnancial data, (3) 10-Ks
through hand-collection, and (4) company’s investor relations
departments directly contacted by the author.

The KLD STATS has expanded the number of companies it
covers over the years. Since 1991 it has covered around 650
companies from the S&P 500 Index and Domini 400 Social Index. In
2001 it added Russell 1000 Index companies bringing the number
of coverage companies to 1100, and in 2003 it further expanded the
list to 3100 by including Russell 2000 Index companies. Out of the
entire KLD STATS database from 1991 to 2007, 38 restaurant
companies were initially retrieved according to the publicly held
company index in the restaurant industry obtained from the
Yahoo! Finance website. Fourteen companies out of the 38 initially
retrieved were excluded because they were 100% domestic and
therefore did not qualify for the analysis for this study examining
the multinational restaurant companies. In collecting the number
of foreign properties and total properties in order to calculate DOI,
annual ﬁnancial reports (10Ks) ﬁled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) were utilized.

The other ﬁnancial data for the remaining 24 companies were
collected from Compustat for the matching years that a company
appears on the KLD STATS lists. For example, McDonald’s is on the
list from 1991 through 2007, whereas Yum! Brands appears from
2002 to 2007. When the 10Ks and Compustat did not provide the

required information for the study, the researcher made a request by
contacting the company’s investor relations manager through email.
For example, Brinker International provided their number of
domestic and foreign franchising units via return email so the
author could calculate the degree of internationalization. During the
procedure, all observations from three companies, CKE Restaurant,
Krispy Kreme, and TCBY, were excluded because of the limitations of
data access. Also, one observation of operating income before
depreciation (OIBD) was not accessible for IHOP 2007; therefore, for
the analysis of ROA that uses OIBD as numerator, the number of
observation is one less than the case of Q.

After data collection, additional data screening was conducted.
Five observations, two of Dennis, two of Domino’s Pizza, and one of
Sonic Corporation were eliminated because of their negative values
of debt-to-equity ratio. The study then calculated Mahalonobis
distance scores to check outliers. In accordance with Tabachnick and
Fidell (2001), using a p-value of less than 0.001 identiﬁed no outliers.
As a result, 119 (118) data observations from 19 restaurant
companies remained for the main analysis with Q (ROA). Table 2
presents the list of companies included in the current study.

It should be noted that the number of companies gradually
expanded because the number of companies that KLD STATS
covered has increased over the years; therefore, the ﬁnancial data
for about 75% of the sample were concentrated in the period from
2001 to 2007.

4. Results

The empirical analysis of the current study focuses on the
inverted U-shaped relationship of BRC and ﬁnancial performance
as well as the BRP and ﬁnancial performances of multinational
restaurant companies. Before performing the main analysis, the
Newey–West analysis, the study provides general characteristics
of the study variables through descriptive statistics.

4.1. Descriptive statistics

Table 3 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the variables
examined in the study. All values presented are ﬁrm-level
observations either collected from a database or calculated based
on the data collected from the database. Tobin’s Q (Q) shows a
mean value of 2.10, implying that the average market value of
sampled restaurants is approximately 2.10 times greater than their
replacement costs. The maximum (minimum) value of Q appears
to be 5.909 for Starbucks in 2006 (0.678 for Triarc in 2005). ROA

a All data are at ﬁrm level. DOI represents Degree of Internationalization, estimated by the proportion of the foreign units divided by total units; ADV represents
advertisement expenditure on a yearly basis; CSR represents CSR index from KLD STATs; Q represents Tobin’s Q; ROA is deﬁned as Operating Income Before Depreciation

deﬁned by the year-end index.

presents a mean value of 0.219, ranging from 0.01 for Triarc in 2005
to 0.74 for Brinker International in 2004.

The average amount of advertising expenditure is approxi-
mately $161 million (per year), with a range of $1 million (IHOP in
2006) to $718 million (McDonald’s in 2007). KLD ratings are
distributed from  8 (Yum! Brands in 2005 and 2007) to 8
(Starbucks in 2006 and 2007), with a mean of 0.4. The mean value
of DOI of the sample is 16.7%, varying from 0.1% (Sonic Corporation
in 2006) to 89% (Tim Hortons in 2006).

The amount of sales for the sampled restaurants is, on average,
$4.1 billion with a maximum (minimum) value of $22.8 billion for
McDonald’s in 2007 ($322 million for Morton in 2006). Leverage
ratio (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio) ranges from 0.25 (Starbucks in
1998) to 17.3 (IHOP in 2007), with a mean value of 1.472. S&P 500
Composite Index shows a mean value of 1174.8, with the
maximum (minimum) value of 1469.3 in 1999 (417.1 in 1991).

The study performed Pearson’s correlation test to provide
bivariate relationships between pairs of all variables and also to
check for possible multicollinearity among the independent
variables.
In ﬁnalizing estimation of the study variables, a
normality issue arose; BRC ranges from $1 million to $718.3
million (Table 3), and its distribution appears to be severely
skewed (note: the distribution is not presented in the study). Thus,
the current study uses the natural log of the yearly advertising
expenditure to alleviate the violation of normality assumption.

Results of Pearson’s correlation test are exhibited in Table 4.
Between dependent variables, Q shows a positive and signiﬁcant
correlation with ROA (r = 0.31). In regard to the correlation with
main variables, BRC showed no signiﬁcant relationship with the
dependent variables whereas BRC2 showed a negative and
signiﬁcant relationship with Q (r =  0.18) and ROA (r =  0.24).
BRP and BRP2 exhibit a positive and signiﬁcant correlation with Q
(r = 0.28 and 0.35, respectively).

For control variables, DOI shows a positive and signiﬁcant
correlation with Q (r = 0.35), BRC (r = 0.60) and BRC2 (r = 0.26). SIZE
shows a positive and signiﬁcant correlation with Q (r = 0.20), BRC
(r = 0.84), BRP (r = 0.27), BRP2 (r = 0.29) and DOI (r = 0.698).
LEVERAGE has a negative and signiﬁcant correlation with Q
(r =  0.25) and BRP (r =  0.28). With MARKET, a negative and
signiﬁcant correlation is detected with BRC (r =  0.23) and BRP
(r =  0.30). A negative relationship between MARKET and BRC
exists possibly because restaurant ﬁrms may want to increase
advertising expenditures when ﬁnancial markets are down due to
competitions growing ﬁercer. For the negative relationship
between MARKET and BRP, a possible explanation is that, according
to the managerial opportunism theory (Preston and O’Bannon,
1997), restaurant managers may want to decrease investment in
socially responsible activities because they want to maximize their
own beneﬁts by reducing such investment when the market is
good so that they can increase ﬁrms’ performance which will lead
to bigger bonuses for themselves. However, these explanations are
mere speculations, not based on empirical examinations. More-
over, if considering multiple possible factors that may confound
the relationship between MARKET and BRC (BRP), such negative
relationship may disappear. Since this, again, is a pure speculation,
further research is encouraged to shed more light on this issue.

A few relationships appear to be highly correlated which may
lead to a multicollinearity problem. Therefore, the study estimates
variance inﬂation factor (VIF) in its main analyses to examine the
multicollinearity issue.

4.2. Main ﬁndings

Newey–West analysis is performed for each dependent
variable: Q and ROA. The variance inﬂation factor (VIF) is estimated
in the separate pooled regression analysis to check for the

multicollinearity issue. The VIF values are within the tolerance
range of 10 (Ott and Longnecker, 2001); the highest VIF value is
6.176.

The Newey–West analyses yield mixed results. When regres-
sing Q, brand recognition shows no signiﬁcant impact for either
stages: BRC with a t value of  0.89 and BRC2 with a t value of  1.96.
In other words, no matter what the amount of advertising
expenditure is, Tobin’s Q receives no impact at 0.05 signiﬁcance
level although the negative impact of BRC on Q tends to become
greater as BRC grows. Impact from BRP appears to be positive and
signiﬁcant on Q for the both stages with t value of 2.52 and 4.94 for
BRP and BRP2, respectively, and the degree of the positive
signiﬁcance grows as BRP increases. With regard to ROA, no
impact is found with both BRC and BRC2 with a t value of 0.17 and
 1.38, respectively. Both BRP and BRP2 also present no signiﬁcant
impact on ROA with a t value of  0.12 and 0.04, respectively.

The degree of internationalization (DOI) shows a positive and
signiﬁcant impact on Q that is consistent with the previous
literature that examined multinational hotel companies (Lee,
2008), but no signiﬁcant impact appears to exist on ROA. SIZE
presents no signiﬁcant relationship either with Q or ROA. LEVERAGE
and MARKET exhibit signiﬁcant impacts on Q with t value of  3.32
and 2.52 respectively, but no impact is found on ROA (Table 5).

According to the main analysis, for the both models, SIZE
variable demonstrates an insigniﬁcant impact and there could be
several possible reasons. One potential reason could be because of
a multicollinearity issue. As a Pearson’s correlation test revealed,
SIZE variable highly correlates with BRC (r = 0.84) and DOI
(r = 0.70). Because of these high correlations with other indepen-
dent variables, although its VIFs do not violate the referenced cut-
off point (i.e., 10 according to Ott and Longnecker, 2001), SIZE
variable’s coefﬁcient can be deﬂated (Gujarati, 2003). Another
reason can be because of poor construct validity for SIZE variable;
something other than log of sales used in this study may be a better
measure for a restaurant ﬁrm’s size, for example total assets. Or, it
can be about our speciﬁc sample; our study includes only 19
restaurant ﬁrms, missing all domestically-operated restaurant
corporations, private restaurant companies, and non-U.S. restau-
rant companies. Results can be different for those other ﬁrms
whose characteristics are different from those of our sample ﬁrms.

4.3. Sensitivity analysis

In addition to the control variables included in the main
analysis, the study conducts a sensitivity analysis to control for a
possible confounding effect of restaurant concept (e.g., fast food

and casual dining) and degree of franchising. According to the
concept deﬁned by the sampled companies in their 10Ks, the 19
companies were divided into three groups: fast food, casual dining,
and mixed. Quick-service, fast-casual restaurants, and bakery-
cafe´ s were categorized into fast-food; casual dining restaurants
and mid-scale family restaurants were classiﬁed as casual dining;
and the companies that have restaurants with both concepts were
labeled as mixed. Degree of franchising (DOF) was calculated by
dividing the number of franchised units by total number of units;
the information was obtained from the 10Ks of each company in
each year. Sample sizes of the three groups are 56 (fast-food), 43
(casual dining), and 20 (mixed) for the analysis on Q, and 56, 42,
and 20, respectively, for ROA. The study created two dummy
variables for casual dining (CD) and mixed (MX), with fast food as a
base concept. A value of one was assigned to CD (MX) if the
company was categorized as casual dining (mixed) and zero
otherwise. Results are presented in Table 6.

The analysis on Q produces similar results as did the prior
Newey–West analysis without restaurant concept dummy vari-
ables and the DOF variable; BRC and BRC2 consistently show no
signiﬁcant relationship with Q, but the signiﬁcance of the positive
relationship at BRP disappears, whereas the relationship remains
with BRP2. The restaurant concept variables CD and MX show no
signiﬁcant relationship with Q with a t value of  0.39 and  1.21.
Degree of franchising (DOF) shows no signiﬁcant relationship with
Q with a t value of  1.85 as well.

In terms of ROA, the insigniﬁcant relationship with the main
variables (BRC, BRC2, BRP, and BRP2) remains the same, insignif-
icant. When regressing ROA, the restaurant concepts CD and MX
show no relationship whereas DOF exhibit a negative and
signiﬁcant relationship with a t value of  2.25. This means that
the restaurants concept does not have signiﬁcant impact on ROA.
Also, those restaurants that have more franchising units performed
less in terms of ROA.

Another sensitivity analysis was conducted with another
frequently used accounting performance measurement, return
on equity (ROE). No signiﬁcant relationship was found with any of
the main variables (BRC, BRC2, BRP, and BRP2) nor restaurant
concept and DOF variables.

According to the sensitivity analysis,

three independent
variables (i.e., DOI, SIZE, and MARKET) change their signs when
examined for ROA. The changes could possibly occur due to the
additional three control variables (i.e., two dummy variables for
restaurant concept and degree of franchising). These additional
variables may have systematic impacts on the relationship
between DOI
(SIZE and MARKET) and ROA (i.e., potential

5. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of brand
recognition and brand reputation on ﬁrm performances (i.e., value
and accounting performances) of U.S. multinational restaurant
companies while controlling for degree of internationalization. In
order to fully investigate the relationship, the study tested two
ﬁnancial performance measurements: Tobin’s Q as value perfor-
mance measurement and ROA as accounting performance
measurement.

In regard to ﬁrm value performance, in general, the ﬁndings
yielded a positive impact of brand reputation, whereas no impact
of brand recognition was found. For the relationship between value
performance and brand reputation, the main model without
controlling for restaurant concept and degree of
franchising
suggested a quadratic relationship different from our expectation
of an inverted U-shaped relationship while presenting a positive
impact at both the ﬁrst (BRP) and second stages (BRP2), but to a
greater extent at the second stage. According to the ﬁndings, the
more the restaurant companies exercise the CSR activities, the
more effective of those activities on ﬁrm value performance. It
might happen because the CSR activities provide more beneﬁts
than costs for the restaurants, thus enhances the ﬁrm value. For
example, hiring more diverse workforce or using less plastic cups,
which are considered as CSR activities, would not necessarily
increase costs for the restaurants whilst increasing company brand
reputation, which then could be linked to higher ﬁrm value.
However, further research to empirically examine exact reasons or
causes are strongly encouraged.

The sensitivity analysis, while additionally controlling for
restaurant concept and degree of franchising, suggested that the
positive impact of brand reputation at the ﬁrst stage lessened and
statistically became insigniﬁcant. Still, brand reputation at the
second stage (BRP2) remained positive and signiﬁcant in the
sensitivity analysis. Considering both the main and sensitivity
analyses,
the ﬁndings support a positive impact of brand
reputation on value performance in general.

With regard to accounting performance, no impact of both
brand reputation and brand recognition was detected. The
insigniﬁcant result remained when controlling for restaurant
concept and degree of franchising in the sensitivity analysis.
Furthermore, neither brand recognition or brand reputation
appeared to have impacts on another widely used accounting

performance, ROE. Therefore, this study concludes that brand
recognition and reputation have no impact on accounting
performance.

According to the ﬁndings, the main and some control variables
(e.g., brand recognition, brand reputation, degree of internationa-
lization, and capital structure) of the model seem to be better
factors to explain a restaurant’s value rather than its accounting
performance, possibly because these corporate strategies may be
more about enhancing the ﬁrm value rather than short-term
accounting performance. Moreover, the results may imply that
some factors that affect ROA might have been omitted from the
model. This certainly requires further research.

In sum, based on the results, the present study supports that
U.S.-based multinational restaurant companies may strategically
strengthen their brand reputation (i.e., investing more in CSR
activities) in an attempt to enhance their value performance, but
that does not necessarily enhance accounting performance as well.
Also, the multinational restaurant companies may not expect an
increase of value performance or accounting performance as they
invest more in advertising expenditures. All these ﬁndings are after
controlling for degree of
internationalization, which should
reinforce the validity of our results. The ﬁndings also support
previous research on impacts of internationalization by presenting
a positive impact of degree of internationalization on ﬁrm value
performance (e.g., Errunza and Senbet, 1981; Lee, 2008).

This study makes a contribution to the literature by examining
business issues of multinational hospitality companies which are
growing substantially by size due to the signiﬁcance of globaliza-
tion. In particular, the current study expands the hospitality
literature on brand recognition and corporate reputation studies
by investigating the topic in relation to ﬁnancial performance
within the multinational setting. Brand has been extensively
studied in the hospitality context, but this study differentiated its
value by controlling for degree of internationalization in examin-
ing the impact of brand recognition and brand reputation of
multinational restaurant companies on ﬁnancial performance.

The contribution to hospitality CSR studies is also meaningful.
The study explored CSR issues within the multinational restaurant
company’s context where the need for sector speciﬁc studies has
been indicated by main stream CSR studies (Salzmann et al., 2005).
In spite of the increasing importance of CSR issues in today’s
business environment, little research has been conducted focusing
on this issue thus far for multinational hospitality companies, in
particular, multinational restaurant companies. Speciﬁc research
topics of prior CSR hospitality studies include triggers of socially
responsible actions of UK tour operators (Miller, 2001), CSR issues

among UK pub operators (Jones et al., 2006), tourism certiﬁcate
programs in developing countries (Font and Harris, 2004), and a
report about Phuket, Thailand after the Indian Ocean tsunami
(Henderson, 2007).

In addition, this study contributes to the academic world by
selecting and comparing two frequently used ﬁnancial perfor-
mance indicators—Tobin’s Q for value performance and ROA for
accounting performance—as dependent variables. Given that
studies often examine only one ﬁnancial performance measure
as a dependent variable, this comparison would provide better
insight into the impacts of brand recognition and brand reputation
on two different types of ﬁnancial performance to academics and
industry practitioners in the multinational restaurant companies
setting.

This study also provides insightful guidance for managers and
executives in the multinational hospitality industry, especially
those working for multinational restaurant companies, to develop
strategies to meet stakeholders’ ever-increasing demands. Multi-
national restaurant managers should consider the ﬁndings in
drawing up strategic plans in terms of a ﬁrm’s brand recognition
and brand reputation in relation to ﬁrm performance. Based on the
ﬁndings of the positive impact of brand reputation on value
performance, the managers of multinational restaurant companies
may want to consider increasing their CSR activities when their
ﬁnancial and operational situations allow. There should be ﬁrm
speciﬁc issues and situations that concurrently impact their
strategic plans along with advertising expenditures, CSR activities,
and degree of internationalization, but the ﬁndings should provide
reasonable and general guidelines in their strategy development to
enhance their value performance. A point of caution should be
brought up here in terms of the level of CSR investment. The study
ﬁndings suggest, in general, a positive impact of investing in CSR
activities on value performance. Furthermore, the positive impact
seems to increase as CSR activities become further strengthened.
Therefore, sustained and continued investment in CSR activities of
the restaurant companies are suggested. However, it is hard to
believe that such positive impact will increase indeﬁnitely as the
CSR investment increases. This ﬁnding could be retrieved from our
analysis possibly because the restaurant industry is not mature in
terms of CSR exercises. If this is the case, within the currently
limited CSR investment range, the CSR investments may make a
positive impact on restaurant ﬁrm value, but such positive impact
may not be guaranteed beyond the current CSR investment.
However, this is our mere speculation and a further research
should be conducted to shed more lights on this issue.

The ﬁndings also reveal that investment in the advertising and
CSR activities does not seem to reward multinational restaurant
companies in terms of their accounting performance. This may be
because it takes some time for restaurant companies to realize the
beneﬁts of such investments. However, as was found and
discussed, the ﬁnancial market seems to reward the companies’
efforts in improving their brand reputation by increasing the
companies’ value performance. Therefore, executives and man-
agers of multinational restaurant companies may want to consider
maintaining reasonable or increasing investments in CSR activities
with not a short-term, but a long-term perspective.

The results of this study would beneﬁt multinational restaurant
industry investors or ﬁnancial analysts that monitor their investing
activities as well. By understanding the positive impact of brand
reputation on value performance to a certain level, they may want
to examine CSR activities when they evaluate restaurant industry
investment portfolios with international operations. In investigat-
ing companies’ CSR activities, they may want to develop their own
criteria of assessment using ﬁnancial data, CSR reports, news-
papers, and so forth, or subscribe to reputable rating reports such
as KLD STATS, which the current study used.

6. Limitations and suggested future research

There are several limitations inherent in this study. First, the
current study examined only publicly held multinational restau-
rant companies in the United States. Therefore, the results may not
be applicable to private companies or publicly held companies
based in foreign countries. Although collecting the required data
would be challenging, examining private or non-U.S. multinational
restaurant companies would advance the literature. Second, the
sample size is relatively small. Despite the fact
that data
availability of advertising expenditures, CSR ratings, and degree
of internationalization were limited, the authors’ best effort for the
data collection accomplished 119 samples over 17 years. However,
an increase of the sample size would enhance the statistical power
and generalizability further. Third, the current study limited
performance measures into two: Tobin’s Q for value performance
and ROA for accounting performance. Some other performance
measures such as total shareholder return (TSR) or economic
value-added (EVA) may also be examined in future studies. Lastly,
regarding multicollinearity problem, we used 10 as the cut-off
point following Ott and Longnecker, 2001 as discuss in 4.2. main
ﬁndings. However, if a more stringent rule (e.g., VIF of 3 or 5) is
applied, certain variables appear to have a multicollinearity
problem. This would be a limitation of our study even after we
employed a mean-centered method to reduce such problem. Since
the multicollinearity problem is often a sample-speciﬁc problem,
collecting more samples or different types of companies (e.g., non-
U.S. restaurants) in the future may provide results without the
problem.
