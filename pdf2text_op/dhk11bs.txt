Abstract
Although existing research evaluates how the adoption of proactive envi-
ronmental strategies affects corporate performance, there is little understand-
ing of the organizational mechanisms that link such strategies to competitive 
advantage. It is, therefore, unclear how environmental strategies relate to 
other management strategies that could lead to a competitive advantage. In 
this article, we analyze the organizational capabilities that underlie a firm’s 
ability to generate competitive advantage from the adoption of proactive 
environmental strategies. We develop and test a model where absorptive 
capacity facilitates the development of proactive environmental strategies 
that result in competitive advantage. Results from a survey of 157 German 
chemical firms strongly support the model.

Introduction

117

Whether firms can benefit from being “green” has become an important 
question in the business strategy literature as exemplified by the considerable 
empirical research analyzing the link between beyond-compliance environmental 
strategy and financial performance or competitive advantage (Damania, 2001; 
Dowell, Hart, & Yeung, 2000; King &Lenox, 2001; Konar & Cohen, 2001; 
Margolis & Walsh, 2003; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky, 2008; Orlitzky, 
Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Waddock & Graves, 1997). This 
line of research, however, has produced mixed results. Although some studies 
find a positive link between environmental strategies and financial performance 
(Russo & Fouts, 1997), others depict an insignificant or even negative relation-
ship once a firm has harvested low-hanging fruits (Damania, 2001; McWilliams 
& Siegel, 2000).

Some have argued that one reason for these mixed results might be that the 
question has been phrased in the wrong terms (King & Lenox, 2001; Margolis 
& Walsh, 2003; McWilliams & Siegel, 1999; Reinhardt, 1999; Siegel, 
2009). Instead of asking whether it pays to be green, we ought to be asking 
about the conditions that support successful environmental strategies. Although 
the empirical literature on the link between environmental strategies and 
competitive advantage, mostly rooted in economics, emphasizes external 
drivers such as regulation, we still have little understanding of the organi-
zational mechanisms that link the adoption of environmental management 
practices or strategies to competitive advantage (Marcus, 2005). This omis-
sion could lead to misspecified models that ignore the effect of such orga-
nizational mechanisms on both environmental strategy and competitive 
advantage (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).

Practitioners within the emerging industry of socially responsible investing 
(SRI) provide an interesting perspective on the debate. They argue that envi-
ronmental strategies not only reflect a firm’s stance toward the natural environ-
ment but also represent a good proxy of a firm’s management capabilities.1 
Firms that are well managed also manage their environmental strategies well. 
If this combination is true, are environmental strategies just the tip of the orga-
nizational iceberg? By focusing solely on environmental strategies, are we 
missing the essential foundations of their success? In this study, we argue that 
we need to look beneath the surface, under the tip of the organizational iceberg, 
to get a better understanding of the organizational capabilities that support the 
emergence of successful sustainable strategies.

Research in organizational theory has started to highlight the importance of 
organizational factors as predictors of the adoption of sustainable management 


118

strategies (Delmas & Toffel, 2008; Lenox & King, 2004; Sharma & Henriques, 
2005). However, only a few studies have analyzed the organizational mecha-
nisms that link the adoption of an environmentally proactive strategy to com-
petitive advantage (Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; 
Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Marcus (2005) recently pointed out that “though 
an impressive amount of work has been done, additional research is needed in 
understanding . . . how [an environmental competence] is created, what the 
capabilities upon which it is based are [and] why they might lead to competitive 
advantage” (p. 31). Similarly, Sharma (2005) explains that “we need research 
that identifies different configurations of co-specialized and complementary 
capabilities that generate proactive environmental approaches and competitive 
advantage”(p. 21)

This lack of research, however, is problematic. For management researchers, 
it is important to find out whether differences in environmental strategies and 
their consequences regarding a firm’s competitiveness originate from different 
resource requirements and endowments. Also, for practitioners, it is important 
to be aware of the resource requirements for the implementation of a successful 
environmental strategy. Otherwise, such strategies are likely to result in adverse 
effects on the firm’s competitive advantage.

In this article, we attempt to open the organizational black box and analyze 
the organizational capabilities that underlie a firm’s ability to generate a com-
petitive advantage from their environmental strategy. More specifically, we 
argue that a firm’s absorptive capacity, defined as the “ability to recognize 
the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends” 
(Cohen & Levinthal, 1990, p. 128), provides the foundations for a successful 
environmental strategy. We investigate how a firm’s absorptive capacity can 
impact the adoption of beyond-compliance proactive environmental strategies 
such as “anticipating future regulations and social trends and designing or 
altering operations, processes, and products to prevent negative environmental 
impacts” (Aragon-Correa & Sharma, 2003, p. 73). We further investigate the 
relation of proactive environmental strategies to a firm’s ability to generate 
competitive advantage (i.e., comparative cost, innovation, and reputation ben-
efits) from such a proactive approach. From there, we propose a model that 
predicts a positive relationship between the level of absorptive capacity of a 
firm, its environmental proactivity, and competitive advantage.

To test our model, we surveyed 763 firms in the German chemical industry. 
Results based on responses from 157 firms—including responses from mul-
tirespondents within 54 of the firms—strongly support our hypotheses. Our 
results show that both the development of more proactive environmental strate-
gies and the generation of competitive advantage from this proactivity depend 


Delmas et al. 

119

on the level of absorptive capacity. We find that our model, which links absorp-
tive capacity to environmental proactivity and competitive advantage, has a 
much higher predictive power than the alternative and more conventional model 
that only links environmental proactivity to competitive advantage. These results 
suggest that absorptive capacity facilitates the adoption of proactive environ-
mental strategies that can lead to competitive advantage.

In both its theoretical and empirical domains, this article extends existing 
research. First and foremost, we contribute to the “pays to be green” debate by 
combining research on the link between environmental strategy and competitive 
advantage to the research seeking to explain the adoption of environmental 
proactivity. Our findings suggest that both environmental proactivity and com-
petitive advantage are to some extent attributable to the same underlying general 
organizational capability: absorptive capacity. Our research reveals the funda-
mental role of organizational foundations for successful proactive environmental 
strategies. Second, we mutually connect two previously separated research 
streams. We extend the application of the concept of absorptive capacity beyond 
the technological and managerial to the natural environment.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. First, we review the 
literature on corporate environmental strategy. Second, we develop hypotheses 
linking absorptive capacity, environmental proactivity, and competitive advan-
tage. Third, we describe our methodology and results. A concluding discussion 
follows.

Literature Review
We define proactive environmental strategies as those that seek to reduce the 
environmental impacts of operations beyond regulatory requirements (Sharma, 
2000) and base our argumentation on four constituting elements of environ-
mental proactivity: (a) environmental reporting, (b) operational improvements, 
(c) organizational changes, and (d) regulatory proactivity. This categorization 
is based on Shrivastava (1995a), who outlines how environmental substrategies 
can be characterized comprehensively by applying a “systems view” of orga-
nizations (Katz & Kahn, 1967). First, proactive firms actively promote external 
and internal reporting by consultants and employees (Henriques & Sadorsky, 
1999) through internal and external audits or the release of a sustainability 
report. Proactive firms can also design or alter products and/or organizational 
and operational processes to reduce or prevent negative environmental impact 
(Aragon-Correa & Sharma, 2003) through pollution-prevention or collaborative 
interactions with stakeholders (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Finally, proactive 
firms can aim at influencing others by initiating changes and participating in 


120   

Business & Society 50(1)

the development of future regulations (Aragon-Correa, 1998; Delmas & Mon-
tes-Sancho, 2010).

The literature has identified several opportunities for proactive environmental 
strategies to benefit shareholders directly (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Siegel, 
2009). These include cost savings achieved by preventing pollution, value 
creation strategies achieved through the development of greener products 
(Klassen & Whybark, 1999; Reinhardt, 1998), or benefits resulting from non-
market strategies to influence government regulation so that their rivals are at 
a disadvantage (Shrivastava, 1995). However, we argue that—as with any 
strategy within a firm—the success of these proactive environmental strategies 
will depend on the firm’s organizational capabilities that determine corporate 
success more generally. For example, given the conceptual similarity between 
pollution-prevention and total quality management, it may be possible to accel-
erate the accumulation of resources in the former by integrating it into the latter 
(Roome, 1992). In firms that do not have well-developed quality-management 
processes, there could be barriers to implementing pollution-prevention because 
the strategy requires the voluntary involvement of large numbers of people, 
especially line employees, in continuous-improvement efforts. Surprisingly, 
very few studies have looked at the relation between organizational capabilities, 
environmental proactivity, and competitive advantage. As McWilliams and 
Siegel pointed out, this omission could lead to model misspecification. Using 
the case of R&D, they argue that because environmental proactivity and com-
petitive advantage are strongly correlated to R&D, researchers should disen-
tangle these various effects rather than testing the effect of environmental 
proactivity on competitive advantage alone (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).

Although research has examined the drivers for the adoption of proactive 
environmental strategies, most studies have focused on the influence of external 
stakeholders such as regulators, customers, or environmental nongovernmental 
organizations, rather than on firm organizational capabilities. These studies 
have investigated how the adoption of proactive environmental strategies is 
influenced by environmental legislation and regulations (Carraro, Galeotti, 
&Gallo, 1996; Delmas, 2002; Delmas & Montes-Sancho, 2010; Delmas & 
Montiel, 2008; Delmas, Russo, & Montes-Sancho, 2007; Majumdar & Marcus, 
2001; Rugman & Verbeke, 1998; Russo, 1992), customers (Christmann & 
Taylor, 2001; Delmas & Montiel, 2009), and the desire to improve or maintain 
relations with their communities (Florida & Davison, 2001; Henriques & 
Sadorsky, 1996). Others have shown that managerial perceptions of the impor-
tance of various stakeholder pressures were associated with a more proactive 
environmental stance (Delmas, 2001; Henriques & Sadorsky, 1999; Sharma 
& Henriques, 2005). However, there is comparatively less empirical evidence 


Delmas et al. 

121

on whether organizational capabilities enable firms to adopt such strategies. 
Cordano and Frieze (2000) focus on managers’ attitudes about pollution-
prevention as an important antecedent to pollution-prevention activity. Darnall 
and Edwards (2006) show how firms’ capabilities, resources, and ownership 
structure impact the cost of the adoption of an environmental management 
system. Delmas and Toffel (2008) identify both institutional pressures and 
organizational characteristics as predictors for the choice of a firm’s environ-
mental strategy. Lenox and King (2004) analyze how absorptive capacity 
facilitates the adoption of pollution-prevention practices among manufacturing 
facilities within the information and communications technology industry. 
Empirical research investigating the underlying capabilities that enable firms 
to develop a competitively valuable environmental strategy is even scarcer. 
One exception is the work by Christmann (2000) that shows the importance of 
complementary assets to gain cost competitive advantage.

There is a need to further understand the capabilities that form the basis for 
environmental proactivity (Sharma, 2005). Although such capabilities can take 
many forms, the ability to absorb and transform knowledge is particularly relevant 
to processes and products related to the environment, which span multiple fields 
of expertise and are typically found outside of the firm’s boundaries (Hart, 1995; 
Russo & Fouts, 1997). In addition, this knowledge is often complex, tacit, new to 
the firm, and implies profound changes in business processes (Hart, 1995; Russo 
& Fouts, 1997). As such, firms not only need to acquire knowledge on environ-
mentally proactive technologies, they also need to learn how to build up processes 
that enable them to absorb relevant environmental knowledge.

We argue that absorptive capacity can help firms design or alter operations, 
processes, and products to reduce or prevent negative environmental impact. 
Absorptive capacity can be conceptualized as an integrated system in which 
several individual elements jointly allow a firm to learn from external sources 
(Jansen, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2005). An important insight from the 
literature on absorptive capacity is that prior knowledge allows the uptake and 
integration of new knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Todorova and Durisin 
(2007) detail four main related steps that define absorptive capacity: Knowledge 
acquisition, knowledge assimilation, knowledge transformation, and knowledge 
exploitation. Knowledge acquisition triggers the uptake of new external knowl-
edge, knowledge assimilation refers to the ability to integrate new knowledge, 
and knowledge transformation refers to the ability to derive new insights and 
consequences from the combination of existing and newly acquired knowledge 
(Todorova & Durisin, 2007). Although assimilation simply adds new knowledge 
to the existing knowledge base, transformation creates new knowledge from a 
novel combination of new and existing knowledge. Finally, knowledge exploita-
tion represents the ability to apply and commercialize acquired, assimilated, 


122   

Business & Society 50(1)

and potentially transformed knowledge by creating new operations, products, 
or services, or by altering existing ones. Although R&D is central to the devel-
opment of absorptive capacity, the two terms represent different concepts (Cohen 
& Levinthal, 1990). Investments in R&D represent knowledge acquisition and 
may favor knowledge assimilation, knowledge transformation, and knowledge 
exploitation. However, other factors such as training or manufacturing can 
impact knowledge assimilation, transformation, and exploitation.

Although previous literature has shown the importance of absorptive capac-
ity to turn previously external knowledge into a commercial outcome in high-
technology environments (Lane, Koka, & Pathak, 2006; Lane, Salk, & Lyles, 
2001), it has not yet attempted to link absorptive capacity to the absorption 
of external knowledge in the environmental domain, which is marked by strong 
social and regulatory pressures. The only exception is the work of Lenox and 
King (2004) that shows how the distribution of knowledge within the firm, 
and the role that managers play in administering information to organizational 
subunits, can facilitate the adoption of pollution-prevention practice. However, 
although King and Lenox did demonstrate the importance of management 
support in conjunction with absorptive capacity to facilitate the adoption of 
pollution practices, they did not investigate the effect of absorptive capacity 
on competitive advantage.

In this article, we expand this previous literature by demonstrating how 
absorptive capacity can not only facilitate the acquisition, assimilation, trans-
formation, and exploitation of knowledge related to the natural environment 
through proactive environmental strategies but can also lead firms to gain 
competitive advantage. We argue that absorptive capacity facilitates the adop-
tion of successful environmental strategies because environmental strategies 
require the combination of knowledge from various sources that are often 
outside of the firm. Managing environmental problems is complex and cuts 
across accepted organizational, functional, and disciplinary boundaries (Kemp, 
1997). The interdisciplinarity of environmental issues require access to different 
competencies that exist mostly outside of the firm. Furthermore, the nature of 
environmental issues requires the firm to understand not only consumer but 
also social demands in a proactive way.

Hypotheses
Absorptive Capacity and Environmental Proactivity

Research has shown that knowledge in one field can ease the absorption of 
new knowledge in related fields (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Firms that have 
developed organizational capabilities to acquire new knowledge in their field 


Delmas et al. 

123

will be better able to acquire knowledge related to environmental practices 
and technologies than firms that have not developed such capabilities (Marcus 
& Geffen, 1998). For example, firms that have developed capabilities in estab-
lishing research partnerships can build on these capabilities to launch new 
partnerships focused on emerging environmental technologies. Expertise in 
building partnerships will lower the cost of establishing new partnerships. 
Managers of such firms might also feel more comfortable with the idea of 
engaging in collaborations outside their immediate set of expertise than man-
agers who have never established external partnerships. In addition, high 
levels of absorptive capacity, especially in the form of knowledge assimilation 
and transformation capabilities, will ensure the adequate understanding and 
application of external knowledge. Such absorptive capacity is not simply the 
sum of the individual capacities within the firm. The way in which knowledge 
is distributed within the organization and the structure of communications 
are just as significant (Lenox & King, 2004). Because environmental processes 
span across multiple fields of expertise, firms with good intraorganizational 
communication will be more likely to assimilate and transform external knowl-
edge related to the environment than firms with weaker organizational com-
munication (Pinkse, Kuss, & Hoffmann, 2010). It will be easier, for example, 
to conduct a product life cycle assessment for a firm where information flows 
easily across departments and the supply chain. This relative ease is because 
to implement a life cycle assessment, a company needs to obtain information 
regarding the environmental impact of a product throughout the life of the 
product and of its various components. Finally, knowledge exploitation capa-
bilities allow the firm to reap commercial benefits from environmental proac-
tive strategies. This gain can be achieved, for example, through participation 
in the design of best available techniques that will be chosen by regulatory 
agencies as the industry standard.

In conclusion, we argue that absorptive capacity in the form of knowledge 
acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation is crucial to facilitate 
the development of proactive environmental strategies. This requirement is 
particularly true in the chemical industry, where technological, environmental, 
and general management issues are often closely related. In such a case, prior 
knowledge in one area is also applicable in another and therefore fosters the 
firm’s absorptive capacity across these different domains. From here, we derive 
our first hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: The higher the level of absorptive capacity, the greater the 

environmental proactivity of the firm.

Absorptive Capacity and Competitive Advantage

As outlined in the previous section, we see absorptive capacity as an enabler 
for firms to develop environmental proactivity. In addition, we see absorptive 
capacity as facilitating the generation of competitive advantage from environ-
mental proactivity. In doing so, we use an approach that considers environmental 
proactivity from a strategic perspective (Reinhardt, 1999; Siegel, 2009). We 
base our investigation on three strategies that outline the possible strategic 
spectrum to reconcile competitiveness and environmental proactivity: Compara-
tive cost reduction, value creation strategies aiming at innovation and product 
differentiation, and improved reputation.

Empirical evidence shows that environmentally proactive firms can realize 
significant savings in production costs by preventing pollution compared to 
reactive firms (Christmann, 2000; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Klassen & Whybark, 
1999). Pollution prevention may save not only the cost of installing and 
operating end-of-pipe pollution-control devices, it also may increase pro-
ductivity and efficiency (Porter & van der Linde, 1995; Shrivastava, 1995; 
Smart, 1992). Less waste means better utilization of inputs, resulting in lower 
costs for raw materials and waste disposal. Moreover, environmental pro-
activity might help firms reduce the probability or the cost of uncertain but 
adverse outcomes such as environmental accidents that could lead to business 
interruptions, liability, punitive regulation, or damage to corporate reputations 
(Hart & Milstein, 2003).

We argue that absorptive capacity can leverage comparative cost advantages 
from proactive environmental strategies. Firms with highly developed absorp-
tive capacity are likely to leverage cost advantages when implementing envi-
ronmental changes because of their improved access to a wider variety of 
technologies and resulting flexibility in capability deployment (Zahra & George, 
2002). Moreover, absorptive capacity can help to better assess the benefits of 
new technologies with respect to their ability to reduce potential liability costs, 
legal fees, or product take-back costs, or to leverage production efficiencies 
and waste reduction. Knowledge exploitation ensures the smooth implementa-
tion of these new technologies. The higher the level of absorptive capacity, the 
more easily and the more widely a firm will generate cost benefits from envi-
ronmental proactivity.

Besides objectives of comparative cost reduction, firms can pursue value-
creation strategies by aiming at innovation and product-differentiation benefits 
(Christmann, 2000; Delmas et al., 2007; Hart, 1995; McWilliams & Siegel, 
2001; Porter & van der Linde, 1995) or by seeking an improved image and 


Delmas et al. 

125

reputation based on environmental proactivity (Menon & Menon, 1997; 
Reinhardt, 1998; Shrivastava, 1995). Firms can also aim at imposing a cost on 
their competitors through more stringent regulations if they have already invested 
in technologies required by forthcoming regulation (Shrivastava, 1995; Vogel, 
1995). Absorptive capacity can enable firms to realize differentiation and repu-
tation advantages through proactive environmental strategies (Shrivastava, 
1995). However, to realize these benefits, a firm needs to value, acquire, and 
assimilate knowledge to understand market trends. Furthermore, the firm has 
to use its transformation and exploitation capability to draw conclusions from 
these market trends and to develop or alter processes, products, or services that 
eventually result in a competitive advantage.

Finally, whether the firm is able to generate competitive advantage depends 
on the extent to which competitors are able to replicate such a strategy. 
Because both absorptive capacity and environmental proactivity depend on 
processes that are complex and often tacit (Hart, 1995; Szulanski, 1996), 
they are difficult to imitate (McEvily & Chakravarthy, 2002). In addition, 
in strong regimes of appropriability, a firm can protect its innovation derived 
from absorptive capacity through patents (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Then, 
the cost for knowledge replication is increased for rivals, leading to perfor-
mance differences across firms (Zahra & George, 2002). Christmann outlines 
how such strong conditions of appropriability exist in innovation-driven 
regimes, for example, where firms are environmentally proactive. She explains 
that firms are able to create proprietary solutions and to benefit from them 
(Christmann, 2000).

Summing up, a high level of absorptive capacity enables a firm to turn 
environmental opportunities into competitive advantage, especially compara-
tive cost, innovation, and reputation advantages. From there, state our second 
hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: The higher the level of absorptive capacity, the greater 
the competitive advantage generated from environmental proactive 
strategies.

Figure 1 illustrates our hypotheses. This figure shows that a firm’s absorp-
tive capacity explains both the adoption of environmental proactive strategies 
(Hypothesis 1) and competitive advantage derived from these strategies 
(Hypothesis 2). We therefore do not anticipate the relationship between envi-
ronmental proactivity and competitive advantage to be direct but rather inferred 
from absorptive capacity.

Method
Industry Choice
To limit variance and increase comparability, we focus our empirical analysis 
on one industry in one country: the German chemical industry. This industry 
was chosen because of the salience of environmental concerns and because of 
the importance of research and innovation for competitiveness. The chemical 
industry has a high environmental impact due to, for example, the industry’s 
toxic emissions (Christmann, 2000, 2004; Hoffman, 1999; King & Lenox, 2000; 
Nehrt, 1996). The German chemical industry is affected by environmental 
regulation such as the new European chemicals policy EC/2006/1907 on the 
registration, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemicals (REACH). 
With an average R&D budget of 5.5% of sales, the chemical industry is also 
one of the most research-intensive industries in Germany (VCI, 2007), which 
points towards the importance of knowledge management and absorptive capac-
ity. In addition, in 2006 the German chemical industry was the world’s leading 
exporter of chemical products for the 4th year in a row, with exports valuing 
119.6 billion Euros (VCI, 2007), which highlights a strong national and inter-
national competitive edge. Finally, with roughly 3,500 companies and total 
sales of about 162.2 billion Euros (VCI, 2007), the population of firms in the 
industry is sufficiently large for empirical analysis.

Measures

127

As archival data was not available in our industry context to proxy absorptive 
capacity, proactive environmental strategies, and competitive advantage, we 
opted for a survey approach with a multi-item scheme and multirespondents 
for each firm. This alternative has proved useful in previous research exposed 
to the same challenge (Aragon-Correa, 1998; Christmann, 2000; Delmas & 
Toffel, 2008; Jansen et al., 2005; Sharma, 2000).

As we describe below in greater detail, each of three main variables, that is , 
absorptive capacity, environmental proactivity, and competitive advantage 
through environmental proactivity, was developed based on constructs developed 
by scholars in similar contexts. We asked eight industry experts to check the 
validity of each of these constructs in our setting. We used an iterative process 
where we interviewed a set of experts, took into account their suggestions in 
a revised questionnaire, and presented the new version to the next set of experts 
until we had integrated the views of all eight of the experts. We measured each 
item with a 7-point Likert-type scale (all items are presented in Appendix A).
Measurement of absorptive capacity. Researchers measured absorptive capacity 
using various indicators. For example, Cohen and Levinthal (1990) chose 
R&D intensity as their proxy. Others used a survey approach involving a five-
item scale measuring absorptive capacity (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998; Szulanzki, 
1996). Because absorptive capacity consists of several subcapabilities, we decided 
to measure these individually. We therefore combined the constructs from Jansen 
et al. (2005) with a measure from Jaworski and Kohli (1993). As such, we 
included 14 items to describe our four separate constructs for knowledge acqui-
sition (four items), assimilation (three items), transformation (four items), and 
exploitation (three items).

Measurement of environmental proactivity. Sharma and Vredenburg developed 
a comprehensive set of constructs to measure the proactivity of an environmental 
strategy in their study of the oil and gas industry (Sharma, 2000; Sharma & 
Vredenburg, 1998). We built on their constructs and complemented these with 
an additional construct to reflect the firm’s regulatory proactivity, based on 
Khanna, Koss, Jones, and Ervin (2007). The items were adapted to the chemical 
industry setting by using industry experts as outlined above. The procedure 
resulted in 15 items for four constructs: environmental reporting (three items), 
regulatory proactivity (three items), improvement of operations (four items), 
and environmental partnerships (five items).

Measurement of competitive advantage through environmental proactivity. 
Constructs for estimating the competitive advantage gained from an environ-
mental strategy have been used in a variety of studies (Christmann, 2000; Darnall 


128   

Business & Society 50(1)

& Edwards, 2006; Delmas, 2001; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Because we included 
both private and publicly traded firms, we could not use accounting measures. 
Instead, we used constructs for innovation and comparative cost advantages 
from Christmann (2000) that are based on a multi-item scheme, and comple-
mented these with items for innovation and reputation from the Sharma and 
Vredenburg (1998) study. The constructs were also adapted to the chemical 
industry setting using industry experts as outlined above. During this process, 
we dropped and modified a number of items. The procedure resulted in ten 
items for three main constructs: comparative cost benefits (four items), innova-
tion and differentiation (three items), and reputation and customer relations 
(three items).

Firm size. Firm size has been hypothesized to influence both environmental 
and business performance of firms (Aragon-Correa, 1998; Orlitzky, 2001). We 
controlled for company size using the logarithm of annual sales.

Management support. Researchers have shown the roles of gatekeeper and 
boundary spanner, both inside and outside the firm and between different 
entities within the firm, as drivers of a firm’s absorptive capacity (Lenox & 
King, 2004). Management support has also been found to influence environ-
mental activities and has been thoroughly addressed in strategic management 
research both theoretically and empirically in case study research (Henriques 
& Sadorsky, 1999; Hunt & Auster, 1990; Roome, 1992; Wartick & Cochran, 
1985). In our case, our construct builds on the study conducted in the policy 
domain by Khanna et al. (2007).

Sample Selection and Response Rate
For our empirical analysis, we chose member firms of the chemical industry 
association of Germany, the Verband der Chemischen Industrie (VCI), with 
research and production operations based in Germany: A total of 1,143 member 
firms at the time of the evaluation (July 2007).2 This membership represents 
roughly a third of all chemical companies in Germany, and close to 90% of all 
employees in the German chemical companies. Thus, members of the German 
chemical industry association tend to include the largest chemical companies 
in Germany.

In the following step, we identified the mail addresses and telephone num-
bers of the companies listed in the directory. To obtain a number of independent 
knowledge sources, we contacted the 1,143 companies by phone and requested 


Delmas et al. 

129

contact information for the most knowledgeable person in the areas of firm 
competitiveness, environmental strategy, and knowledge management. Typi-
cally, the contacts were the CEO for firm strategy, the R&D director for knowl-
edge management, and the director of the environmental department for the 
firm’s environmental strategy.

We eliminated 30 firms because the respondents stated that an assessment 
of the actual state of the overall company was not feasible due to a recent 
merger or larger restructuring processes. Finally, we removed 350 firms that 
stated that they had an internal policy not to participate in any voluntary survey. 
These actions reduced the sample to 763 firms.

Subsequently, we administered a personalized questionnaire survey to collect 
firm information for the dependent and independent variables from independent 
knowledge sources. As such, most firms received three individual letters: One 
to the CEO, one to the director of R&D, and one to the director of the environ-
mental department. For each letter, the set of questions depended on the contact 
person’s position and included either the constructs that assessed competitive 
advantage, environmental proactivity and management support, or absorptive 
capacity. In cases where we could identify a single contact person only, for 
example, in smaller companies where the CEO was responsible for all areas, 
we sent a survey questionnaire containing all sets of questions to the identified 
single respondent. Each package held a cover letter, the survey, and an addressed 
and stamped return envelope. In addition, the cover letter offered the options 
to fill in the survey by fax, online, or via phone.3 Four weeks later, we conducted 
a second round of phone calls as a first reminder. Finally, an additional 4 weeks 
later, we sent a last reminder via email.

A total of 271 firms delivered at least one part of the questionnaire (i.e., 
competitive strategy, knowledge management, or environment), which repre-
sents a response rate of 35.5%, whereas 157 firms delivered all parts of the 
questionnaire, which represents a response rate of 20.6%. This result represents 
a satisfactory response rate (Delmas & Toffel, 2008; Hoskisson, Cannella, 
Tihanyi, & Faraci, 2004; McEvily & Chakravarthy, 2002). Out of these 157 firms, 
33 firms had two or three respondents (21%) who responded to different parts 
of the questionnaire. In such cases, we aggregated the responses so that each 
firm represented one observation in the database. We tested sample represen-
tativeness in several ways. First, we searched for differences in the compositions 
of the original and responding sample. To test if some 22 subsectors of the VCI 
within our sample were more likely to respond, we performed a binary logistic 
regression with the dummy variable for response or nonresponse as dependent 
variable. The results show no significant bias regarding any of the investigated 
subsectors. To test whether greener firms were more likely to participate in our 
questionnaire, we used the same methodology to test for the representativeness 


130   

Business & Society 50(1)

of firms participating in the Responsible Care initiative of the chemical industry, 
a special initiative to reduce environmental impact. The results also show no 
significant bias related to participation in Responsible Care.4 Finally, we com-
pared the size distribution of the respondents in our sample to the German 
chemical industry and found a higher representation of larger companies. This 
skew is explained by our sample being based on members of the German 
chemical industry association, which includes the largest German chemical 
firms. We assigned each firm to a predefined size group and performed a paired 
t-test, which revealed differences at a significance level of p = 0.043.

We were also able to dispel concerns of common method bias in our data. 
Common method bias occurs when the instruments the researcher employs 
enter into or affect the score or measures that are being gathered. First, 21% of 
our data includes two or three different respondents, which means that there is 
no common method bias in this subsample of our respondents.5 Second, we did 
not find common bias in the remaining 80% of the data. For this test, we cal-
culated single-factor scores for the main variables absorptive capacity, envi-
ronmental proactivity, and competitive advantage and performed a regression 
between pairs of them. So for example, we would use competitive advantage 
as a dependent variable and absorptive capacity, environmental proactivity, 
number of respondents, and sales as independent variables. If common method 
bias was present, the variable “number of respondents” would be significant 
(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003; Spector, 2006). The variable 
number of respondents was not significant in any of the models. We were 
therefore able to dismiss concerns of common method bias.6

Structural model. We employed structural equation modeling (SEM, 
AMOS Version 7, via maximum likelihood estimates) because of the ability 
of this technique to analyze models based on several latent variables that 
are more complex than multiple regression models (Hardy & Bryman, 
2004). Structural modeling addresses structural and measurement issues 
frequently found in survey-designed research and is increasingly being 
used in strategic-management research (Capron, 1999; Cordano & Frieze, 
2000; Delmas & Toffel, 2008; Sharma, 2000; Shook, Ketchen, Hult, & Kacmar, 
2004; Simonin, 1999).7

The construction of each latent variable can be depicted by a set of linear 

equations of the form:

Y
i

 = β
0

 + X
β
1
i1

 + . . . + X
ip

β
p

 + ε
i

Similarly, the relation between the different latent variables can be described 
with a set of linear equations of the same form. The equations system is solved 
under the side condition to minimize the overall variance error. Often, different 


Delmas et al. 

131

letters are used to distinguish between the latent and observable variables. For 
simplicity and as we focus on the relation between the latent variables only, 
we use a single notation.

As such, in our case the equations system between the three main variables 

can be described as:

CA = β
EP = β

 + X
 + X

β
CA,ACAP
EP,ACAP
β
EP,ACAP

 + X
 + ε

CA

Where CA reflects the overall level of competitive advantage, β

 reflects 
a potential systematic deviation from the neutral level, β
 reflects the 
effect size of absorptive capacity on CA, β
 reflects the effect size of 
environmental proactivity controlled for the effects of absorptive capacity, 
and finally ε
 depicts the error in the variance that cannot be explained by 
any of the variables.

Structural diagnostics. Based on a number of tests, we found a good overall 
fit of the model. For example, the model has a χ2/df ratio of 1108/796 = 1.44, 
which is lower than 2 and therefore implies a good fit of the model (Marsh 
& Hocevar, 1985). We find that the χ2 is statistically significant (p = .000), 
which could suggest some misspecification of the model although it is well 
recognized that this statistic is sensitive to sample size (Arbuckle & Wothke, 
1999). We considered other structural diagnostics for the overall fit of the 
model that are not sensitive to sample size (Bentler, 1990). We calculated 
the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), an estimate of 
the discrepancy between the original and reproduced covariance matrices 
in the population (Steiger, 1990). In our model, the RMSEA of 0.05 is 
within an acceptable range (Cudeck & Browne, 1983). Likewise, we found 
an incremental fit index (IFI; Bollen, 1989) of 0.91, a Tucker Lewis index 
(TLI; Tucker & Lewis, 1973) of 0.90, and a comparative fit index (CFI; 
Bentler & Bonett, 1980) of 0.91. Each of these indices is above the common 
threshold of 0.90 that designates an acceptable fit. In sum, these structural 
diagnostics indicate a very good relative fit of the theoretical model to the 
underlying data.

Measurement Model
The measurement model describes the construction of the latent variables from 
the observed variables. We constructed 12 latent variables from a set of 41 items 
(see Appendix A). We performed a confirmatory factor analysis using principal 
component analysis with Varimax rotation, as well as calculating Cronbach’s

alpha to confirm the loading of our items on the latent variables (details provided 
in Appendix A). Our three main latent variables (absorptive capacity, com-
petitive advantage, and proactive strategies) were derived from 11 of these latent 
variables as shown in Table 1 below. The remaining 12th latent variable is 
management support.

Results
Table 2 presents the results for the hypothesized relations between the main 
variables. We find that absorptive capacity has a positive and significant impact

on environmental proactivity and competitive advantage, and that environmental 
proactivity has a significant and positive impact on competitive advantage. In 
addition, we find two mediation effects: Environmental proactivity mediates 
the relation between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage, and man-
agement support mediates the relationship between absorptive capacity and 
environmental proactivity.

Hypothesis 1. The results for the main relations provided in Table 2 confirm 
Hypothesis 1 that predicted a positive effect from absorptive capacity on the 
generation of environmental proactivity. The path between absorptive capacity 
and environmental proactivity is positive and significant (β = 0.15, p = .043). 
Based on the standardized coefficient, a one standard deviation increase 
in absorptive capacity is associated with a 0.15 increase in environmental

proactivity. However, a closer look infers a mediating role of management 
support. In fact, variations in levels of the independent variable, absorptive 
capacity, account significantly for variations in the management support 
mediator (β = 0.31, p = .005). Furthermore, variations in the mediator signifi-
cantly account for a variation in the dependent variable, environmental pro-
activity (β = 0.70, p < .001). The total standardized effect of absorptive capacity 
on environmental proactivity increases (β = 0.36) when taking into account 
the indirect effect of absorptive capacity on environmental proactivity via 
management support. Moreover, to function as a mediator, the direct relation 
between the independent and the dependent variable needs to weaken substan-
tially when including the mediating variable (Baron & Kenny, 1986). We con-
firmed this condition in a separate model that assessed the influence of 
absorptive capacity on a firm’s environmental proactivity after removing the 
variable management support. Although all structural diagnostics remain similar, 
the significance of the relation between absorptive capacity and environmental 
proactivity increases (β = 0.36, p = .004). Thus, we find strong support for 
Hypothesis 1 yet mediated by management support.

Hypothesis 2. The results confirm the predicted relationship that absorptive 
capacity has a positive effect on the generation of competitive advantage from 
a proactive environmental strategy. The path between absorptive capacity and 
competitive advantage is positive and significant (β = 0.32, p = .020). Based 
on the standardized coefficient, a one standard deviation increase in absorptive 
capacity is associated with a 0.32 increase in competitive advantage.

Although we find that the direct effects of environmental proactivity and 
absorptive capacity on competitive advantage are both significant, we wanted 
to test how these two effects worked together. We therefore calculated the 
indirect effect of absorptive capacity on competitive advantage via environ-
mental proactivity (β = 0.05) and the total effect including the direct and indirect 
effects (β = 0.38). These results show that the total effect is superior to the direct 
effect, implying a partial mediating role for environmental proactivity. We also 
evaluated the existence of the mediating role of the firm’s environmental pro-
activity on competitive advantage by removing the variable environmental 
proactivity from the model, and found an increased significance of the relation 
between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage (β = 0.44, p = .006), 
confirming the mediating role of the firm’s environmental proactivity (Baron 
& Kenny, 1986).

Overall, our results indicate that a significant share of the firm’s environ-
mental proactivity is attributable to the firm’s absorptive capacity, and that 
environmental proactivity is not the only determinant of competitive advantage. 


Delmas et al. 

135

The combination of both environmental proactivity and absorptive capacity 
allows a firm to benefit from its environmental stance.

To compare our model to a more classic test of the effect of environmental 
strategies on competitive advantage, we developed a second alternative model 
in which we omit absorptive capacity. In this model, the significance of the 
direct relationship between environmental strategies and competitive advantage 
increases (β = 0.540, p < .001). However, this alternative model yields worse 
fit statistics than our original model. In sum, our original model adds significant 
explanatory power to a more traditional approach.

Robustness. To ensure the robustness of our data, we validated the findings 
using a number of alternative approaches. First, we wanted to confirm that the 
result would hold for the population of 271 firms. For this confirmation, we 
repeated the different analyses with the larger data sample, considering all 
responses from the 271 firms by taking advantage of AMOS’ full information 
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation routine to handle missing data, which 
allows taking into account all information observed. The model yielded better 
fit indices than the conservative model with 157 firms and supported the two 
hypotheses even more strongly. Although the relationship between environ-
mental proactivity and competitive advantage decreases in significance, the 
relationships between absorptive capacity and environmental proactivity as 
well as competitive advantage become even more significant. As such, this 
model also highlights the role of absorptive capacity to generate value through 
environmental proactivity.8

Second, we wanted to test whether the results were driven by specific ele-
ments of environmental proactivity, absorptive capacity, or competitive advan-
tage. To gain a better insight into the details of the first hypothesized relation, 
we used the factor scores of the different subvariables of competitive advantage, 
environmental proactivity, and absorptive capacity and conducted two multi-
variate analyses (MANCOVA). First, we used the four different individual 
elements of absorptive capacity as well as the interaction term of these elements 
as independent variables and the measures for environmental proactivity as 
dependent variables. In addition, we conducted another MANCOVA exploring 
the different subconstructs of absorptive capacity and competitive advantage. 
We controlled for the number of respondents and company size. Table 3 dis-
plays the results.

The MANCOVA results reflect the findings from the structural equation 
model but allow a more detailed view of the mode of action of absorptive 
capacity. Each individual element does not contribute a specific share to the 
value of absorptive capacity. Instead, the value of absorptive capacity seems

to result from the combined effect of all elements. As such, we find that absorp-
tive capacity is able to unfold only when all four elements are present.

These results further confirm the finding drawn from the structural model. 
We find that the combined effect of all elements turns absorptive capacity into 
a valuable capacity. Interestingly, we also find that some of the elements taken 
individually might be costly to the firms but that their combined interaction 
might not. For example, the construct “exploitation” has a negative and 
significant effect on cost reduction, but the effect becomes positive when 
“exploitation” is combined with the other elements of absorptive capacity.
Third, because we used cross-sectional data that we gathered contemporane-
ously, we tested whether our results were robust to the inclusion of reverse path. 
In the original model, we include paths extending from absorptive capacity to 
environmental proactivity and competitive advantage. We developed an alterna-
tive model that included paths from the subconstructs of competitive advantage 
and environmental proactivity to the main construct of absorptive capacity and 
to the main construct of environmental proactivity. Neither of the new reverse 
paths was statistically significant and the results of this model yielded nearly 
identical estimates of the original hypothesized relationships.

Fourth, another potential concern derives from heterogeneity within our 
sample that is not controlled for in our structural equation model. Specifi-
cally, because our sample includes facilities from several subindustries and 
structural equation modeling techniques do not allow for industry dummies, 
it is possible that unobserved differences between these industries may 
account for some of our results. To test whether our results were sensitive 
to unobserved industry differences, we estimated regression equations cor-
responding to the paths of the structural equations. In these regression analy-
ses, we included additional control variables such as firm size (measured as 
logarithm of annual sales), R&D budget (in share of sales), subindustry (as 
dummy variables for, for example, pharmaceuticals, coatings, and so on), 
and environmental budget. All control variables had no impact on the find-
ings. The results of these regression analyses confirmed the findings of the 
structural model. All hypothesized relationships remain statistically signifi-
cant (p < .001) with the predicted sign.

Discussion and Conclusions,  
and Future Research
We started by asking what constitutes the basis for successful proactive envi-
ronmental strategies. We argued that by studying the link between proactive

environmental strategies and competitive advantage independently from the 
firms’ more general organizational capabilities, researchers might just be 
looking at the tip of the iceberg and missing the most fundamental element of 
the success of proactive environmental strategies. To investigate the less visible 
organizational drivers of the development of successful environmental strate-
gies, we developed a model to investigate the relationship between absorptive 
capacity, environmental proactivity, and competitive advantage. Our findings 
show that the adoption of proactive environmental strategies depends on the 
firm’s level of absorptive capacity, mediated by management support. Similarly, 
the generation of competitive advantage from such a proactive approach seems 
largely fueled by the firm’s absorptive capacity. These results hold contributions 
for both theory and practice.

First, we contribute to the “pays to be green” debate by combining research 
on the link between environmental strategies and competitive advantage with 
the research seeking to explain the rationale for the adoption of environmental 
proactivity. To some extent, the results also suggest spuriousness regarding the 
relation between environmental proactivity and competitive advantage, because 
both variables rely on organizational capability. Previous research had ignored 
that environmental proactivity provides the foundation for such proactive strate-
gies. Because absorptive capacity was not included in previous models, it is 
possible that the effect of environmental proactivity on competitive advantage 
was artificially inflated.

In addition, widen the context of application of the absorptive capacity 
concept. Although many scholars have made use of absorptive capacity in a 
technological context, little research has extended the application of the concept 
beyond this domain (Lane et al., 2006; Lenox & King, 2004; Zahra & George, 
2002). Here, we apply the concept of absorptive capacity beyond a purely 
technological or managerial domain to an external and complex area that simul-
taneously requires the consideration of social, regulatory, technological, and 
managerial issues. Whereas the core of the literature on absorptive capacity 
emphasizes the processes of building up technological knowledge within and 
outside the firm, our work stresses that absorptive capacity can facilitate the 
acquisition of external expertise in the social and regulatory domain. In addi-
tion, we find that absorptive capacity is only realized when upper management 
is driving the process. This finding confirms that when examining the develop-
ment of new strategies it is important to consider the political processes within 
an organization, such as decisions of power holders upon courses of strategic 
action (Child, 1972; Lenox & King, 2004; Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001; Todorova 
& Durisin, 2007).

Our third contribution is of a practical nature, as the findings give strategic 
guidance for firms. Those firms that aim at strengthening their environmental 
competencies without forfeiting their competitiveness should not initially 
invest in environmental measures but rather in their absorptive capacity. 
Having a strong stand in acquiring, assimilating, transforming, and exploiting 
knowledge seems a valuable precondition to realizing benefits from a proactive 
environmental strategy. The applicability of our approach is further supported 
by the fact that the different elements of absorptive capacity relate to distinct 
knowledge management tools. For example, knowledge acquisition refers to 
access to knowledge networks such as universities, participation in research 
alliances, or direct knowledge acquisitions, for example, firm or patent acqui-
sitions. Moreover, the concept of absorptive capacity suggests that knowledge 
contributes best to a firm’s competitive advantage if the respective processes 
are fully integrated within the firm. Conversely, an isolated environmental 
division is unlikely to transfer knowledge to other units. Our work can also 
provide practical guidance to investors who are seeking to understand the link 
between environmental and competitive advantage. Our results confirm socially 
responsible investors’ intuition that environmental proactivity rests on solid 
managerial foundations.

Our research is not without limitations. One should consider a more dynamic 
model where the development of competencies in the firm’s environmental 
strategy—which is an outcome of the firm’s absorptive capacity—increases 
the firm’s absorptive capacity through extending the firm’s knowledge base. 
Therefore, the existence of feedback loops as part of a longer process needs 
further investigation. Although cross-sectional survey data offers advantages 
over archival publicly available data to investigate firms’ organizational capa-
bilities, longitudinal data would allow a more dynamic investigation if it were 
available. Moreover, although the chemical industry provided an excellent context 
because of the salience of environmental concerns, future research should test 
how our model holds for other industrial contexts where environmental issues 
are less significant. Finally, we focused on a single national context. It would 
be interesting to analyze the effect of differing national regulatory settings on 
the relations between absorptive capacity and successful proactive environ-
mental strategies.

Notes
1.  According to Innovest Strategic Value advisors, leaders in Socially Responsible 
Investing research, “Companies’ ability to handle political, environmental, labor, 
and human rights risks are powerful proxies and leading indicators for their overall 
management quality—or the lack thereof.” (http://www.innovestgroup.com/index 
.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=32).

2.  Verband der Chemischen Industrie www.vci.de
3.  62% of the respondents answered by postal mail or by fax and 38% responded by 

filing the online questionnaire.

4.  Results available upon request from the authors (Appendix B, Table B1). Appendix B 
is too long to publish and contains considerable statistical data organized into 
tables. Specific tables in that appendix are referred in notes to this article.

5.  Our data originate from a varying number of independent sources (respondents). 
24.0% of the data (40 responses) used to assess the relation between absorptive 
capacity and environmental proactivity, 19.1% of the data (31 responses) used to 
assess the relation between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage, and 
20.2% of the data (33 responses) used to assess the relations between environmental 
proactivity and competitive advantage stem from independent sources, the rest stem 
from a single respondent.

6.  Results available from the authors (Appendix B ,Table B2).
7.  The structural model is available from the authors upon request (Appendix B, 

Figure B1).

8.  Results available from the authors (Appendix B, Tables B3 and B4).
