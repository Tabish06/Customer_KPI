Market relationships are often inﬂuenced by factors inside of the ﬁrm. Here we examine how the employees'
view of corporate reputation of a merged B2B ﬁrm, assessed by corporate character (empathy, warmth,
integrity and conscientiousness),
inﬂuences their emotional attachment, satisfaction and job security.
Warmth and empathy correlate strongly with satisfaction. Amongst a number of hypothesised ‘proximity’
factors time (e.g. length of service) and space (e.g. work location) had a substantial effect on perceived
warmth and empathy. The interaction of the two had the most signiﬁcant effect on emotional attachment; in
that employees working remotely and of longer standing were the most disaffected. We propose the
employees' length of service and work location as important factors generally in determining their emotional
response to a merger and in predicting where disaffect will be most acute.

1. Introduction

Relationship management is a key to success in business-to-
business (B2B) markets and can involve extensive interactions
between employees and customers (Barnes, 1997; Weitz & Bradford,
1999). Maintaining a positive disposition among employees, in other
words managing their attitude towards the company and maintaining
a positive internal reputation, is consequently important (Cannon &
Perreault, 1999). For example, a negative employee view of corporate
reputation will lead to employee dissatisfaction and turnover (Davies,
Chun, daSilva, & Roper 2003). A key contact employee's leaving can be
a catalyst for the customer to re-evaluate its relationship with the ﬁrm
(Anderson & Robertson 1995; Duboff & Heaton 1999) making that
relationship vulnerable (Bendapudi & Leone, 2002).

While there is considerable research into customer loyalty and
retention, insights into the internal causes of customer disaffection,
particularly in a B2B context, are rare. One source of employee
disaffection and turnover is a major organisational change such as a
merger or acquisition, our empirical context here. To address the
literature gaps, our paper takes an inductive theory building approach
through an exploratory, quantitative study (e.g., Bugelman, 1994;
Eisenhardt & Bourgeois, 1988). We identify the origin of emotional
detachment by considering employee proximity variables; if the
employee worked remotely or in head ofﬁce (space), how long they
had been employed (time), and in which job role/function they were

involved. Our central argument is that while the proximity variables
affect employee views of their company's reputation to a certain
extent, the interaction between background and time, and the
interaction between time and space, are the most signiﬁcant factors
inﬂuencing the level of emotional detachment of employees during
the post-merger phase.

2. Theory and propositions

2.1. Corporate integrity, warmth, empathy

Reputation concerns the associations stakeholders make with any
entity (Brown & Dacin 1997). There are a number of ways of assessing
corporate reputation including what has been labelled as corporate
character (Keller 2003), deﬁned as the collective qualities expressed in
terms of human characteristics that distinguish an organization (Davies
et al. 2003). There are a number of aspects of corporate character
potentially relevant to a positive climate in a post-merger situation:
Integrity, do employees believe the organization is telling them the truth
about what is happening; Empathy, do employees believe the
organization is seeing things through their eyes; Competence, do
employees believe that the organization is capable of delivering on its
promises (Joni,, 2004; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman 1995); and Warmth,
do employees believe the organization is caring and supportive at a time
of great turmoil (Burton, Lauridsen, & Borge 2004; McAllister 1995).

Integrity, is commonly associated with another key corporate
characteristic that of trust. Belief in one's partner's honesty con-
tributes to a perceived supportive climate (Gibb 1964); it reduces
uncertainty (Ellison & Firestone 1974). Empathy emphasises mutual
feelings and relationships coming from interactions with other

people. During a crisis, strong emotional bonds created between
people will enable them to move beyond rational predictions about
the future and take a “leap of faith” (Lewis & Weigert 1985). Others
mention the importance of the conscientiousness aspect of corporate
reputation (Davies et al. 2003; Fombrun 1996), represented by ability
(Mayer et al. 1995), security (Rempel & Holmes 1986), reliability, or
expertise (Joni 2004), each contributing to a positive climate during
post-merger integration. Employees' positive feelings on such
organisational traits are likely to be conducive to beneﬁcial outcomes
such as low labour turnover, high satisfaction and emotional
attachment during an acquisition (e.g., Morrison & Robinson 1997).
Hence, our expectations can be summarised as:

Proposition 1. The employees' perceptions of corporate reputation
(Integrity, Warmth, Empathy, and Conscientiousness) in a merged
organisation will be positively correlated with their emotional
attachment, satisfaction and job security.

2.2. Time, space and role

The links between employee perception of the merged company's
character and their attitudes towards it will be moderated by a
number of contextual factors, particularly those that deﬁne how close
an employee feels to the new organisation. What we label here as
proximity factors will include the amount of time employees had
served prior to the merger, their position in the merged company, and
the physical location of their work base.

2.2.1. Time

While the link between employee tenure and satisfaction is well
documented (e.g., Piercy, Harris, & Lane 2002), there is not a clear
consensus on how one affects the other. The longer in a particular
environment, the better one can predict returns and avoid frustration,
therefore the higher the satisfaction level (Hulin & Smith 1965).
However a negative relationship has also been observed: as people age
in the company they become more negative (Gibson & Klein 1970).

In the merger literature, the resource-based view suggests that
longer-tenured executives are more likely to have unique and non-
transferable knowledge (Cannella & Hambrick 1993) enabling the
acquiring company to create a valuable intangible resource, namely its
reputation (Hall 1992). In contrast the Upper Echelons Perspective
view suggests that executives with long tenure are committed to
established policies and procedures (Katz 1982; March & March 1977)
resist strategic change (Finkelstein & Hambrick 1990), and are less
capable of adapting to uncertainty (Thomas, Litschert, & Ramaswamy
1991). The longer any employee has been with a company prior to a
merger the more investment they will have made as an employee and
the more attachment they will have towards the pre-merger
company. Merger can be a time of perceived loss. Major change can
pose a substantial threat for those employees who have been longest
with an organisation as they may feel they have suffered the greatest
loss. Hence,

Proposition 2. The longer the employee has served either merging
company the less positively they will perceive the merged organisa-
tion and the lower their emotional attachment will be.

2.2.2. Space

Many organisations have two distinctly different categories of
employee when viewed from a spatial perspective: those located in a
head ofﬁce or other large corporate centre and those operating in the
ﬁeld or away from the main building who are physically further away
from central decision making and the seat of power. We would expect
that these ‘outsiders’ would feel more threatened by a merger than
the ‘insiders’ with better access to information and the decision
making process.

Employees who are involved with the merger process tend to be
more favourable towards the merger than those not involved at all
(Shirley (1973).
‘Insiders’, who would have better access to
communication during the post-merger phase are likely to have
more positive attitudes towards the merged organization. ‘Outsiders’
may feel less well informed and be more susceptible to believing
rumour.
In addition one's ofﬁce location can have a symbolic
importance (Bitner 1992) and employees working remotely from
the perceived centre of decision-making could feel inherently less
secure. Hence we would expect:

Proposition 3. Employees working in the head ofﬁce of a merged
company (insiders) will have more positive attitudes towards the
merged company and higher perceived job security than those
working remotely (outsiders).

2.2.3. Job role/status

Another factor, job role and status can shape employee attitude
towards the merged organisation. Managers are more likely to be
involved in key meetings and with shaping the organisation during
the post-merger integration phase and to feel less disaffected due to
their involvement. In a B2B context, the role of relationship marketing
manager is important in keeping key contacts during post-merger
integration and post holders can be offered incentives to stay (Richey,
Kiesslingb, Tokmanc, & Dalelad 2008). Employees in a technical area
would be less likely to be part of the decision making process than
those in a commercial role. Hence:

Proposition 4. Employees working in different roles and with
different status will have differing attitudes towards a merged
company.

2.2.4. Pre-merger background

Finally, post merger attitude will differ depending upon whether
an employee feels part of any in-group or out-group (Hogg 2000;
Taifel 1978, p. 292). The acquirer may be seen as the winner and the
acquired ﬁrm as the loser. Employees in the latter ﬁrm may feel
inferior due to loss of autonomy and status (Hambrick & Cannella
1993) experience higher levels of dissatisfaction and be more hostile
to the new organisation (Covin, Sightler, Kolenko, & Tudor 1996).
However the existing literature rarely compares the differences in
perception between those employed prior to a merger with those who
join afterwards. Many could join because of the opportunities they see
from the merger and be relatively positively disposed; alternatively
they may become disaffected by any dissonance among established
employees. Our expectations were:

Proposition 5. Employees from different backgrounds prior to the
merger (acquired, acquiring and new joiners) will have differing
attitudes towards the merged company.

3. Research methods

3.1. Sample and data collection

To test our propositions and develop our theory we researched the
aftermath of the acquisition by an American company (Company A) of
a German ﬁrm (Company B). Our study of the 160 employees of the
British subsidiary of the merged company (referred to as AB
hereafter) began 18 months after the merger. 107 questionnaires
were distributed and collected personally in the company's head
ofﬁce to maximise response rate. 53 questionnaires were sent by post
to those working remotely (sales and mobile service engineers). 128
with less than 5% missing values were analysed (an 80% response
rate) 40 had worked for A prior to the merger 64 for B and 24 had
joined since the merger (new joiners).

3.2. Measures

3.2.1. Corporate reputation

14 adjective items from 4 dimensions (Integrity, Empathy,
Warmth and Conscientiousness) of the Corporate Character Scale
(Chun, 2005; Davies et al., 2003) were used to assess the aspects of
corporate reputation found relevant to post-merger integration in the
literature review. Empathy was assessed using 4 items (concerned,
reassuring, supportive and agreeable), Integrity 3 items (honest,
sincere, trustworthy), Conscientiousness 3 items (reliable, secure and
hardworking) and Warmth 4 items (friendly, pleasant, open and
straightforward). The Cronbach alphas all exceeded .70. Respondents
were asked to imagine that AB had ‘come to life’ as a person and to
rate each item described that person on a 5 point Likert scale
(1= “strongly disagree”, 5= “strongly agree”). Adopting the person-
iﬁcation metaphor makes it easier for respondents to communicate
their feelings about an organisation.

3.2.2. Satisfaction/changes in satisfaction

Measuring overall satisfaction with the organisation as a whole
was preferred to satisfaction with the merger itself or job-speciﬁc
satisfaction (e.g., Wanous & Lawler 1972, p. 96) as we wished to link
to other organizational level measures. Respondents were asked to
rate their overall satisfaction with AB and whether they would
recommend AB (1 = “very dissatisﬁed” or “strongly disagree”,
5= “very satisﬁed” or “strongly agree”; α=. 73). Respondents were
also asked to recall their satisfaction prior to the merger. The gap
between the two was calculated to create another variable ‘Change in
satisfaction’.

3.2.3. Emotional attachment

Emotional attachment was measured using two items. Respon-
dents indicated their agreement to the propositions ‘I am pleased to
be associated with the merged company (Company AB)’ and ‘I feel an
afﬁnity with Company AB’ (1= “strongly disagree”, 5 = “strongly
agree”, α= 0.70).

3.2.4. Job security

Perceived job security is an indicator of an employee's emotional
state post-merger. Respondents were asked how secure they felt
about the future ‘People here feel conﬁdent and certain about the
future’ (e.g., Goffee & Jones 1996) using a 5-point Likert scale
(1= “strongly disagree”, 5= “strongly agree”).

3.2.5. Employee proximity variables

3.2.5.1. Time (employee tenure). Tenure was assessed by years of
service. 55 had less than 3 years service, 31 between 3–6 years, 21 7–
10 years, and 20 had 11 years or more. The mean was 5.36 years and
the median 4 years.

3.2.5.2. Space. Employees were asked if they “normally worked from
home or remotely from head ofﬁce” (1=yes, 2= no). 37 worked
remotely and 91 in head ofﬁce.

3.2.5.3. Job role/status. Respondents were asked about their role and
job status. 24 had managerial roles, 47 an administrative or sales role,
and 57 worked in technical service and/or production.

In order to assess the level of overlap between the four proximity
variables, cross-tabulation analyses were conducted by background
(Table 1).

Generally the variables were relatively well distributed,

for
example, the respondents in a managerial position were not
dominated by ofﬁce based or longer serving employees. There was
one exception: the employees from Company A were more repre-

4. Results

Table 2a provides descriptive statistics for the categorical variables
and Table 2b correlations for all continuous measures.
Internal
consistency reliabilities for the latter equal or exceed the generally
acceptable level of 0.7 and are reported on the diagonal. There were
signiﬁcant correlations between and across the four character
dimensions (empathy, warmth, conscientiousness and integrity)
and the emotional outcome variables, satisfaction, emotional attach-
ment and job security.

While all four of the character dimensions correlate with the
outcome variables, warmth and empathy had the strongest relation-
ship with emotional attachment (r = .51 for both), satisfaction
(r=.65 and .60 respectively) and change in satisfaction (r=.41,
and .39 respectively). Perceived job security was more correlated with
warmth and conscientiousness (r =.51 for both). Proposition 1 that
employees' perceptions of Integrity, Warmth, Empathy, and Consci-
entiousness will be positively correlated with emotional attachment,
satisfaction and perceived job security is supported.

Next, background, time, space and job role variables were ﬁrst
individually tested against each dependent variable, empathy,
integrity, warmth, conscientiousness,
job security, emotional

attachment will be’ is supported.

4.1. Background

4.3. Space (insiders vs. outsiders)

Background, even when the effects of other variables are excluded,
had a signiﬁcant effect on empathy (p=0.038) and conscientiousness
(p=0.043), employee satisfaction (p=0.003) and change in satisfac-
tion since the merger (p=0.001). Invariably the scores from those who
used to work for A, the acquiring organisation, were the lowest and
those of the new joiners the highest. The most signiﬁcant results were
for change in satisfaction level. Different background was not a
signiﬁcant factor in itself in predicting integrity and emotional
attachment. Proposition 5 ‘Employees from different backgrounds
prior to the merger will have differing attitudes towards the merged
company’ is supported but not in the way we expected. Employees from
the acquired company who we expected to be more emotionally distant
from the new organisation had more positive feelings towards it.

4.2. Time

A similar test was made to compare the responses of those who
worked remotely (outsiders) to those who worked at head ofﬁce
(insiders). More marked differences were apparent. Those working
remotely had a far less favourable view of the ﬁrm particularly on
empathy (p b.001). They were also more likely to have experienced a
larger drop in overall satisfaction since the merger (p =0.018) and to
be less satisﬁed at the time of the survey (p =0.007). The only non-
signiﬁcant results were for conscientiousness (p=0.10), emotional
attachment (p=0.28) and job security (p=0.10). Staffs working in
the head ofﬁce were more positive about AB than staff working
remotely. Proposition 3, ‘Employees working in the head ofﬁce of a
merged company (insiders) will have more positive feelings and
higher perceived job security towards the merged company than
those working remotely (outsiders)’ is supported.

Tenure had a signiﬁcant effect on perceived warmth (p=0.027)
with a marginally signiﬁcant effect on empathy (p=0.075) and
emotional attachment (p = 0.07). The effects on satisfaction
(p=0.003) and change in satisfaction (p=0.035) were the most
signiﬁcant. The longer an employee had worked for the organisation, the
less satisﬁed they were, and the less they saw AB as warm (friendly,
open, straightforward). They were also less likely to be satisﬁed with the
merged ﬁrm, compared to their satisfaction with the ﬁrm before the
merger. The time variable itself had also a marginally signiﬁcant effect
on emotional attachment and empathy. Proposition 2 ‘The longer the
employee has served either merging company the less positively they

4.4. Job role/status

For this analysis staffs were divided into three groups: Senior
management; Administration and sales; Technical and production.
We expected that those with a technical background would be the
most adversely affected by the merger but this was not the case. We
found no signiﬁcant differences between the three functional groups,
other than a marginally signiﬁcant effect on one variable, warmth
(p=0.08). Proposition 4, ‘Employees working in different roles and
having different status will have differing attitudes towards a merged
company’ is not supported.

When respondents were allocated into two groups, managers and
non-managers, we found no signiﬁcant effect of status on outcome
variables except for empathy (p =0.04). Managers tended to see AB as
more supportive, concerned and reassuring. Again due to the large
number of possible relationships tested this is not compelling
evidence to support Proposition 4.

4.5. Interaction effects: three way ANOVA

Main and interaction effects were tested for using General Linear
Modelling (GLM). We ﬁrst tested for main effects with all four
employee proximity variables. There were no signiﬁcant interac-
tion effects that involved job role but signiﬁcant effects with other
combinations. There are issues with complex interaction effects
with large numbers of predictors as they are difﬁcult to interpret,
and the differences between R2 and adjusted R2 can become large,
implying that the R2 may be over-estimated. As job role had
proven not signiﬁcant in the earlier analyses we excluded it to
focus on interactions between the time, space and background
variables.

Each of the three was added to the analysis one at a time to test for
which had the main effect on individual trust variables and affective
outcome variables. The background variables had no signiﬁcant effect
on satisfaction, conscientiousness and empathy but there was an
effect on integrity (p=0.05), as shown in Table 4.

For integrity, the space variable (whether employees worked
remotely or in the head ofﬁce) was the most signiﬁcant factor,
followed by the background variable, whether the individual worked
for either company or had joined since the merger (p=0.05), but no
signiﬁcant interaction effects were found. Space had a signiﬁcant
effect on empathy (p b0.01) and a marginally signiﬁcant interaction
effect with time (p =0.09). For warmth, both time (p=0.03) and
space (p=0.01) were the most signiﬁcant factors but there was no
signiﬁcant interaction effect. An employee who had worked for less
time and who worked in head ofﬁce was more likely to see the
merged company as warm (more friendly and agreeable) but the
combination did not make a signiﬁcant addition.

Emotional attachment was the only emotional outcome variable
that showed evidence of signiﬁcant interaction effects with the
employee proximity variables. None of the three independent
variables had signiﬁcant effects on emotional attachment, but the
interactions between time with background, and time and space were
signiﬁcant (p=0.02 and p=0.03). If employees had worked longer
with Company A (the acquiring ﬁrm), they were less emotionally
attached if they worked remotely. The analyses for job security and
change in satisfaction proved non-signiﬁcant.

5. Discussion

5.1. Warmth and empathy: key character factors

Corporate integrity, empathy, warmth and conscientiousness were
identiﬁed from the literature as likely to inﬂuence employees during
post-merger integration. The generally low scores for satisfaction
(2.82) and emotional attachment (3.12) were associated with
warmth (friendly, open, straightforward) and empathy (reassuring,
concerned, supportive) or rather the lack of both. Employees rated AB
particularly low for concerned, supportive and reassuring (average
scores 2.84, 2.89 and 2.58 respectively). Integrity was not however
strongly correlated with the affective outcome variables. Conscien-
tiousness (reliable, hardworking, and secure) was most strongly
correlated with perceived job security (average score 1.91).

5.2. Time and space: key proximity factors

The time employees had worked for either A or B correlated with
warmth (p=0.03) satisfaction (p b.01) change in satisfaction (p=0.04)
and, marginally, their afﬁnity with AB (p=0.07) (Proposition 2). We
argued earlier that this might be expected as employees of longer
standing had more invested in either ‘old’ company and therefore would
feel a greater loss. Among the four proximity variables, the space
variable had the most consistently signiﬁcant association with the
emotional outcome variables, satisfaction (p=0.01) change in satisfac-
tion (p=0.02) empathy (p b.01) integrity (p=0.04) and warmth.
(p=0.02). Employees working in the head ofﬁce (insiders) had more
positive feelings than those working remotely (outsiders).

To examine the space variable further, a t-test for each individual
item was conducted (see Table 5). The average outsider's views were
typically below the midpoint of the response range and more negative
than those of insiders for all individual items. The differences between
means were signiﬁcant: trustworthy (p=.02), reassuring (p b.01),
supportive (p b.01), agreeable (p =.01), open (p =.01) and overall
satisfaction (p=.01).

Of immediate concern to the senior management of AB was the
low morale among the outsiders as most worked in sales or other
customer facing roles. Customer-contact employees treat customers
in the way they feel they are treated by management (Berkley and
Gupta, 1995) and one can only guess at how customers were being
treated at this time by such disaffected employees.

expected to see more signiﬁcant results in comparing the responses of
those working in different functions, and in particular between those
working in a technical area or in sales where the impact of being able
to offer what had been two previously competing technologies would
have been greatest. Employees from different backgrounds did have
differing feelings towards AB but, employees from Company A, the
acquiring company, were the least positive. They saw less security in
AB and their overall satisfaction levels had fallen the most. Our
explanation, after discussing the results with employees,
is that
Company A employees had expected to do relatively well from the
merger, and felt frustrated by having to compromise with those from
Company B.

6. Conclusion, implications and further study

The origin of employee disaffection with a merger is not
homogenous.
It can vary by background, which of the merging
companies one is from and whether an employee has joined post-
merger. Employees from the acquiring company should not be
presumed to be more favourably disposed towards a merger. While
corporate integrity and conscientiousness are important, warmth and
empathy are particularly relevant when two sub-cultures are likely to
be competing and we would expect this ﬁnding to apply in many
other merger situations and during other signiﬁcant organisational
changes such as a reorganisation or downsizing. An interesting
ﬁnding is the combined importance of physical proximity and time
proximity in building or damaging emotional attachment to the
merged entity. Fig. 1 summarises this interaction in a generalised
form. The more disaffected in our study were those who had been
employed the longest and who worked remotely from head ofﬁce.

Those we label as more ‘emotionally attached’ had been employed
for a relatively short time and worked in the head ofﬁce. The only
exceptions were the new arrivals, who appeared to be more affected
by the negative climate, due to the closer contact they would have at
head ofﬁce with employees of longer standing.

A number of practical implications can be drawn from the study.
Managers need to recognise that different communication strategies
will be needed during a merger for different groups, depending on
their proximity to the newly formed organisation. Most companies

have sales staffs who work remotely. From our study they can be the
most disaffected group in a merger. This offers a simple explanation of
why mergers can lead to sub-optimal market performance in a B2B or
any context where customer relationships are important. To assume
that the main problems will be in the acquired company or at least in
the minor partner to a merger would be wrong. The employees of the
supposed victor are likely to be disaffected if they perceive that they
have not obtained the spoils they feel entitled to, or they feel they
have to take the brunt of the changes inherent in the post-merger
phase.

Our work emphasises the effect on internal reputation of a
signiﬁcant organisational change and how any consequent disaffec-
tion can be exacerbated by a combination of time and space proximity
factors. Our ﬁndings should encourage further research into the
interplay between time and space and its effect on employee
perceptions in other mergers at an organisational level or at an
inter-personal level during any major change. We believe we have
provided evidence that there will be ‘hot spots’ of negative emotional
climate that can be predicted. Managing inter-organisational relation-
ships is often a principal focus in B2B research and we would expect to
see in future studies that these same factors on the vendor side of the

dyad explaining why such relationships may be inﬂuenced by any
changes inside the vendor's organisation.
