Organizational Justice: Evidence of a New Psychosocial 
Predictor of Health

| Marko Elovainio, PhD, Mika Kivimäki, PhD, and Jussi Vahtera, MD, PhD

In today’s rapidly changing work life, organi-
zational justice may become increasingly im-
portant to employees.1,2 Justice includes a pro-
cedural component (the extent to which
decision-making procedures include input
from affected parties, are consistently applied,
suppress bias, and are accurate, correctable,
and ethical) and a relational component (po-
lite, considerate, and fair treatment of individ-
uals).3,4 Prior research shows that perceived
justice is associated with people’s feelings and
behaviors in social interactions,5–8 but its ef-
fects on health are unknown. We therefore
examined the contribution of procedural and
relational justice to employee health.

METHODS

Study Sample

We used employers’ records to identify all

5342 hospital employees (880 men and
4462 women) in the service of the 7 hospi-
tals in 1 of the 23 health care districts in Fin-
land in the beginning of 1998. Altogether,
4076 employees (76%; 506 men and 3570
women) responded to a questionnaire on jus-
tice and other variables. The mean age of the
respondents was 42.6 years (range = 19–63);
7% were doctors (162 men and 142 women),
50% nurses (124 men and 1914 women),
14% x-ray and laboratory staff (21 men and
532 women), 12% administrative staff (49
men and 436 women), and 17% mainte-
nance, cleaning, and other staff (150 men and
546 women).

Measures

Scales of procedural justice (7 items; range
of scale=1–5; mean score of responses=2.8;
SD=0.7; α=.90) and relational justice (6
items; range of scale=1–5; mean score of re-
sponses=3.5; SD=0.9; α=.81) were adopted
from Moorman7 (Figure 1). Both scales have
been associated with organizational commit-
ment, job satisfaction, and retaliation,6,8,9 and
they were moderately interrelated (r=0.30).

Objectives. This study examined the justice of decision-making procedures and interpersonal rela-

tions as a psychosocial predictor of health.

Methods. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between levels of perceived jus-
tice and self-rated health, minor psychiatric disorders, and recorded absences due to sickness in a co-
hort of 506 male and 3570 female hospital employees aged 19 to 63 years.

Results. The odds ratios of poor self-rated health and minor psychiatric disorders associated with
low vs high levels of perceived justice ranged from 1.7 to 2.4.The rates of absence due to sickness among
those perceiving low justice were 1.2 to 1.9 times higher than among those perceiving high justice.These
associations remained significant after adjustment for behavioral risks, workload, job control, and so-
cial support.

Conclusions. Low organizational justice is a risk to the health of employees. (Am J Public Health. 2002;

92:105–108)

The outcome variables were self-rated

health, minor psychiatric morbidity, and re-
corded absence due to sickness (sickness ab-
sence). Poor health was indicated by health
ratings less than good (n = 766).10–12 Minor
psychiatric morbidity was assessed with the

12-item version of the General Health Ques-
tionnaire (α = .80); cases were those that
scored 4 or higher on the questionnaire (n =
920).13–15 Self-certified and medically certi-
fied sick leaves in 1997 and 1998 were ob-
tained from employers’ registers. Self-certified

Scale of procedural justice

Please indicate the degree to which you agree or disagree with the following statements as they apply to the procedures used
at the hospital you work in. Use the following scale: from 5 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree.

1. Procedures are designed to collect accurate information necessary for making decisions.
2. Procedures are designed to provide opportunities to appeal or challenge the decision.
3. Procedures are designed to have all sides affected by the decision represented.
4. Procedures are designed to generate standards so that decisions can be made with consistency.
5. Procedures are designed to hear the concerns of all those affected by the decision.
6. Procedures provide useful feedback regarding the decision and its implementation.
7. Procedures are designed to allow for requests for clarification or additional information about the decision.

Scale of relational justice 

Please answer the following questions about the general behavior of your supervisor at work. Use the following scale: from 5 =
strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree.

1. Your supervisor considered your viewpoint.
2. Your supervisor was able to suppress personal biases.
3. Your supervisor provided you with timely feedback about the decisions and their implications.
4. Your supervisor treated you with kindness and consideration.
5. Your supervisor showed concern for your rights as an employee.
6. Your supervisor took steps to deal with you in a truthful manner.

sickness absences were 3 days or less, while
medically certified absences, for which a phy-
sician’s examination and a medical certificate
were always required, were more than 3
days.16–18

We measured covariates by using the fol-

lowing standard criteria: age, sex, income,
smoking status (never smoker, n = 2797;
former smoker, n = 557; current smoker,
n = 582), alcohol consumption19 (low con-
sumption: 40 g or less of pure alcohol per
week, n = 3090; high consumption: more
than 280 g for men and more than 190 g
for women, n = 396), sedentary lifestyle
(less than half an hour of fast walking per
week; n = 2135),20 and body mass index
(<25 kg/m2, n = 3813; 25–30 kg/m2, n =

1179; >30 kg/m2, n = 350). Psychosocial
factors were workload21,22 (4 items; range =
1–5; mean = 3.5; SD = 0.9; α = .85), job
control23 (9 items; range = 1–5; mean = 3.6;
SD = 0.7; α = .84), and social support24 (6
items; range = 0–30; mean = 12.0; SD = 5.3;
α = .79). 

Statistical Analysis 

Justice and other psychosocial measures
were divided into quartiles and treated as
categorical variables. Associations of justice
variables with self-rated health and minor
psychiatric morbidity, determined by logistic
regression analysis, were expressed as odds
ratios. We studied associations of justice vari-
ables with sickness absences by using Poisson

regression and rate ratios. Ninety-five-percent
confidence intervals were calculated and ad-
justments were made for demographics, be-
havioral risks, and established psychosocial
factors.

RESULTS 

There were no differences between age
groups or sexes in the evaluation of proce-
dural justice (for men, mean = 3.62, SD =
0.93; for women, mean = 3.60, SD = 0.95) or
relational justice (for men, mean = 2.7, SD =
0.82; for women, mean = 2.79, SD = 0.72),
but employees with high income perceived
significantly lower levels of procedural justice
than other employees (χ2
3 = 46.10; P < .001).

 RESEARCH AND PRACTICE 

Among men, low procedural justice was as-

sociated with a 2-fold risk of poor self-rated
health and an almost 4-fold risk of minor psy-
chiatric disorders, but the associations were
not significant after adjustment for other psy-
chosocial factors. Among women, associations
between procedural justice, self-rated health,
and minor psychiatric disorders were signifi-
cant irrespective of adjustments (Table 1). 

Low relational justice was associated with
about a 2-fold risk of poor self-rated health
and minor psychiatric disorders, although in
the fully adjusted models only the association
with minor psychiatric disorders among
women remained significant (Table 1).

Procedural justice and relational justice

were significantly associated with self-

certified and medically certified sickness ab-
sence. The association of relational justice
with medically certified sickness absence
was significantly stronger among men than
among women (P < .01). There were no in-
teractions between sex and procedural jus-
tice (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Organizational justice was associated with
health among both men and women across
most of the health outcomes studied; this was
true not only for those in the medical profes-
sions but also for those with administrative
and maintenance jobs, after adjustment for
other psychosocial factors. 

Relational justice was a stronger predictor
of sickness absence for men than for women.
This difference, however, might reflect not
only a difference between the sexes but also
the fact that hospital occupations are gender
related. For example, over 50% of the physi-
cians were men, whereas over 93% of the
nurses were women. Organizational justice
may have different meanings for members of
highly ranked occupations related to manage-
ment than for shop-floor employees.25 The
size differences between the male and female
samples may also have affected the detected
differences in significance between sexes.

Our results may shed light on the effects

of other psychosocial models of organiza-
tional behavior. Hemingway and Marmot2

The model of effort–reward imbalance31
suggests that high effort spent at work com-
bined with low reward in terms of salary, es-
teem, or job security defines a state of distress
that increases health problems. Our findings
on procedural justice show that people seem
to be affected not only by rewards as such
but also by the procedures used to determine
how they will be distributed. 

Replications with prospective data and with
other kinds of organizations and occupational
groups are still needed to assess the causality
and generalizability of the association be-
tween organizational justice and employee
health.
