This paper investigates if ﬁrms under high institutional pressure donate more to disaster relief than ﬁrms
under lower institutional pressure. By taking Chinese listed companies' donations to May 12, 2008 Wenchuan
earthquake as the sample, this research ﬁnds that large ﬁrms and ﬁrms who have political ties donate a
signiﬁcant more to disaster relief than smaller ﬁrms and ﬁrms who do not have political ties. But the ﬁndings
indicate that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) donate no more than non SOEs, and service companies donate
signiﬁcantly less than non-service companies. The results of this research partly support the institutional
point of view of corporate philanthropy. Firms under high institutional pressure are more likely to donate
more than ﬁrms facing lower institutional pressure.

1. Introduction

Corporate philanthropy, common in the U.S. for about ﬁfty years,
may be the oldest form of corporate social performance (Bartkus et al.,
2002; Mescon and Tilson, 1987). Businesses take philanthropy as a way
to demonstrate their social consciousness (Idowu and Papasolomou,
2007) on the one hand, and to support their ﬁnancial performance
(Marom, 2006) on the other hand.

Some scholars hold that philanthropic giving is motivated by
rational economic considerations of market generation and consumer
cooption, akin to advertising (e.g., Burt, 1983). They argue that
philanthropic giving has potential strategic value for the companies
who conduct it (e.g., Gardberg and Fombrun, 2006; Godfrey, 2005;
Porter and Kramer, 1999, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003), as those donations
help to establish brand recognition and loyalty (Sánchez, 2000), to
enhance ﬁrm image (Brammer et al., 2006; Saiia, 2002), to increase
reputational capital (Gardberg and Fombrun, 2006; Godfrey, 2005),
and to build an environment that favors ﬁrms' strategic position
(Porter and Kramer, 2002). However, despite the positive argument,
empirical research on the relationship between philanthropic giving
and ﬁnancial performance remains mixed or inconsistent (Hillman
and Keim, 2001; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Windsor, 2001).

Others hold that philanthropic giving is more socially determined,
irrespective of the immediate beneﬁts or costs to the ﬁrm (Husted and
Allen, 2006; Marquis et al., 2007; Oliver, 1991). Those scholars, mainly
from an institutional viewpoint, argue that ﬁrms conduct philan-

thropic giving as a response to the increasing institutional or social
pressure. Firms are embedded within a network of relationships that
place pressures on them to conform to certain expectations (Hess and
Warren, 2008). Over time, these expectations form the basis of rules
that “function as myths, which organizations incorporate, gaining
legitimacy, resources, stability, and enhanced survival prospects”
(Meyer and Rowan 1977, p.340). In this point of view, ﬁrms conduct
philanthropic giving so as to secure their legitimacy (DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983; Scott, 1992) and enhance the likelihood of survival
(Oliver, 1991). However, despite the argument from institutional
perspective, very few empirical investigations have been conducted to
test it.

To date many previous studies (e.g., Adams and Hardwick, 1998;
Boatsman and Gupta, 1996; Buchholtz et al., 1999; Waddock and
Graves, 1997; Wang and Coffey, 1992; Wood and Jones, 1995; Zhang
et al., 2009) have examined the effects of ﬁrm size, proﬁtability,
capital structure (more speciﬁcally leverage) and the like on corporate
philanthropy. Although some scholars discussed the effect of ﬁrm size
on philanthropic giving from the point of view of institutional
pressure, it is still hard to conclude that ﬁrms take philanthropic
giving as a response to institutional pressure because large ﬁrms also
have more resources and capability to do so just than smaller ﬁrms (a
resource-based or slack-resource view). Therefore, to support (or
defy) institutional viewpoint of corporate philanthropy, more
evidences are needed. Besides, in spite of theoretical pervasiveness,
empirical research on corporate donation activities needs developing
(Bandeira-de-Mello et al., 2008), especially the empirical research in
developing countries.

The purpose of this article is to identify whether ﬁrms take
philanthropic giving as a response to institutional pressure. More

speciﬁcally, this research tests if the ﬁrms who face high institutional
pressure donate more than those who face lower institutional
pressure. The study offers a unique viewpoint of disaster relief in
the largest developing country, namely China. In the absence of prior
efforts to empirically test the institutional point of view of corporate
social behaviors, this article contributes to our understanding of the
socially responsible behaviors of ﬁrms in institutional context.

The remainder of this paper has the following organization. The
following section (Section 2) reviews the corporate giving in China.
Section 3 discusses the theoretical background and puts forward
relevant hypotheses. Section 4 and 5 test the hypotheses and report
the results respectively. Finally, the paper ends with conclusion and
discussion.

2. Corporate philanthropic giving in China

Although in some developed countries people widely use the term
corporate social responsibility (CSR) as early as the 1970s, it is a
relatively new concept in China (Yang, 2008). Since the implemen-
tation of a reform and openness policy in China in 1978, economy
oriented policy leads to the ignorance of CSR. CSR came into China
only in the mid-1990s on a tidal wave of social responsibility audits
which were launched by numerous multinational organizations
involved in mainly consumer goods and the retail sector (Zhou,
2006). Its expansion and development have to a great extent been in
reaction to export requirements, and initially a wait-and-see strategy
was adopted by the Chinese government (Tian, 2006).

irresponsible behavior (e.g.,

Almost after China's joining in World Trade Organization (WTO) in
2001 was CSR taken seriously in China due to the severe results
caused by the social
labor scandals,
product safety, and air pollution) of business in China and the
criticism from overseas. China is now under great pressure to catch up
with developed countries where CSR has been developing for much
longer. This pressure (to move from a passive approach to a much
more proactive one) comes from the Chinese government who is
altering its attitude and the degree of attention paid to CSR (Tian,
2006).

However, though the all-round CSR is relatively underdeveloped,
corporate philanthropy has never been suspended in China. Thoughts
and practices of philanthropy were widespread early in the feudal
society of China (Meng, 2005). Confucianism, a dominant moral–
political philosophy in China, embodies rich philanthropic thoughts
(Warner and Zhu, 2002). Confucians believe that the nature of human
beings is to achieve happiness and to do good. As a result,
Confucianism advocates people to be benevolent, philanthropic and
humane. Corporate philanthropy is observable everywhere in modern
China. The 1998 ﬂood disaster, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) accident, the 2004 Tsunami of India Ocean, the
2008 frost disaster and the May 12, 2008 Great Wenchuan
Earthquake, witness disaster relief donations from individuals and
companies. Besides, more and more companies contribute their
donations to helping the poor and the disable, supporting education,
sanitation, sports and arts, and the like. But unfortunately, no precise
data is reported by the government to show how much the corporate
donation is.

In recent years, the Chinese government, some Chinese corpora-
tions and civil society have promoted and advocated various CSR
practices (Yang, 2008). In September 2006, the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange released the “Social Responsibility Guidelines for Listed
Companies”. Listed companies are encouraged to follow its CSR
mechanisms and develop CSR reports according to this guideline (Yin
et al., 2007). In year-end 2006, President Hu Jingtao pointed out that
companies should assume their social responsibilities on the China's
Central Conference on Economic Work.
In April 2007, Shanghai
Banking Regulatory Bureau released “Corporate Social Responsibility
Guidelines for Shanghai Banking Financial Institutions” that encourages

banking ﬁnancial institutions to publish their CSR reports. In 2008,
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission
(SASAC) of the State Council, the regulatory body of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) in China, released “the Guiding Advice on Fulﬁlling
Social Responsibility by Central Enterprises”. This guideline stressed the
exemplary role that central corporations should play in carrying out
social responsibility, and included principles and implementation
measures of CSR development (SASAC, 2008).

The advocating and pressure from the government motivates
more and more companies to pay attention to their social responsi-
bility.
In today's China, more and more companies engage in
charitable donation and report their social responsibility publicly.

3. Theoretical background and hypotheses

Institutional theory, with its focus on public opinion and
institutionalized pressure groups and their impact on ﬁrm structures
(Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Oliver, 1991), offers a compelling
explanation for corporate philanthropic giving. Institutional theory
emphasizes that organizational environments are not only technical
but increasingly institutional (Greening and Gray, 1994; Scott and
Meyer, 1983). Institutions specify rules, procedures, and structures for
organizations as a condition of giving legitimacy and support (Meyer
and Rowan 1977).

The cause of institutional pressures refers to the rationale, set of
expectations, or intended objectives that underlie external pressures
for conformity (Oliver, 1991). Institutional constituents that exert
pressures and expectations include not only the state and professions,
as institutions, but also interest groups and public opinion (Oliver,
1991; Scott, 1987). Although all ﬁrms are inevitably undergoing
institutional pressure, different ﬁrms or ﬁrms in different industries
may face and different level of institutional pressure. Some pressures
or expectations forcing ﬁrms to conduct philanthropy may be speciﬁc
to a ﬁrm or affect all ﬁrms in the industry (Hess and Warren, 2008) or
affect certain kind of ﬁrms across different industries.

For example, larger ﬁrms are regarded to be particularly sensitive
to institutional pressures (Hess and Warren, 2008). These ﬁrms face
greater attention from government bodies and the media and are more
vulnerable to institutional pressures than smaller ﬁrms (Goodstein,
1994; Powell, 1991). The underlying reason that larger ﬁrms are more
likely to undergo institutional pressures is their higher “visibility” in the
front of the government and the media or the public. Higher visibility of
a ﬁrm can attract attention from institutional constituents more easily
and thus its managers perceive higher institutional pressures. In China,
the most powerful institutional constituents are the state (or the
government) and the media or the public (Gao, 2007). Therefore, ﬁrms
who have higher visibility in the front of the government, the media
and the public may face higher institutional pressures than ﬁrms who
have lower visibility.

Since large ﬁrms, ﬁrms who have political ties, state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and ﬁrms in service sector tend to have higher
visibility in the front of the state or the media and the public, this
article hypothesizes these ﬁrms have higher propensity to donate
more than smaller ﬁrms, ﬁrms who do not have political ties, non-
SOEs and ﬁrms in non-service sectors.

3.1. Firm size

Firm size is one of antecedents of charitable donations (Burlingame
and Frishkoff, 1996). Large ﬁrms are more visible to the public, receive
more pressures from the institutional constituents such as the
government, the media and the public and have more incentives to
donate to increase their reputation (Brammer and Millington, 2006).
Several studies including Atkinson and Galaskiewicz (1988),
Boatsman and Gupta (1996), Adams and Hardwick (1998), Buchholtz
et al. (1999), Brammer and Millington (2006), and Zhang et al. (2009)


Y. Gao / Journal of Business Research 64 (2011) 1377–1382

1379

conclude that large ﬁrms give more to charity. Useem (1988) ﬁnd that
ﬁrm size is the single most important determinant of corporate giving
and that large ﬁrms appear to contribute relatively more money to
charity regardless of proﬁts. Thompson et al. (1993) observe that
giving by small businesses is positively related to the number of
employees.

Hypothesis 1. Large ﬁrms commit more philanthropic giving than
small ﬁrms.

3.2. Political ties

Literature on government-business networks shows that political
ties are a valuable asset for ﬁrms (Bertrand et al., 2004; Faccio, 2007).
It is even more popular and important in developing countries in
which the government exerts extreme inﬂuence on the operations of
business. A good relationship with the government or public ofﬁcials
can bring a company preferential treatment in the forms of easy
access to limited resources,
increased accessibility to controlled
information, increased possibility of avoiding ﬁnes or taxes, prefer-
ential terms including the granting of credit and protection from
external competitors, and the like (Luo and Chen, 1997; Pearce and
Robinson, 2000; Xin and Pearce, 1996).

However, despite its value, political ties also involve unspeciﬁed
obligations for exchange partners (Blau, 1964). In some cases the
obligations become more coercive than voluntary (Warren et al.,
2004). Firms who have political ties are vulnerable to support
philanthropy because of their visibility in the eyes of the government
and thus feel greater government pressures to conduct CSR (Cowen et
al., 1987).

Hypothesis 2. Firms who have political ties commit more philan-
thropic giving than those who do not have political ties.

3.3. Ownership type

Ownership type is important in philanthropic giving in countries
where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play an important role in
society (Zhang et al., 2009). State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are
special companies having state ownership and control. In addition to
assuming economic responsibility (to preserve and increase the value
of state-owned assets), SOEs also need to share social responsibilities.
“The Guiding Advice on Fulﬁlling Social Responsibility by Central
Enterprises” released by SASAC in China expects the SOEs to become
“leading examples” for all Chinese companies. This legal document
embodies the Chinese central government's attitude toward CSR of
SOEs (Lin, 2010). When the state faces disasters or difﬁculties, SOEs
are required and expected to take their responsibilities proactively.
Besides, SOEs are also in a vulnerable position to support philan-
thropic causes because of their high visibility in the front of the state,
the media and the public. If SOEs do not act as “leading examples” in
sharing social responsibilities, they are going to be questioned by the
state and the public for not to complying with the advocating of
SASAC.

Hypothesis 3. SOEs donate more to charities than non SOEs.

3.4. Industrial type

Firms in different industries face different incentives in supporting
charity. Useem (1988) argues that ﬁrms from industries with high
levels of public contact such as retailing,
insurance or banking
typically give more than ﬁrms from low contact industries such as
mining or primary metals, suggesting that there are differences across
industries in the perceived need for ﬁrms to pursue socially
responsible outcomes. Supporting Useem's (1988) argument, research-
ers ﬁnd that ﬁrms in industries that depend more on consumer sales

(Burt, 1983) or public perceptions (Clotfelter, 1985), and have more
public contact (Fry et al., 1982) tend to give more.

Companies in the service sector depend more on consumer sales
and have high levels of public contact. The high visibility in the front of
consumers and the public force them to satisfy the expectations of the
public. During the past several decades, the expectation or pressure
from the public on ﬁrms to be “socially responsible” continuously
increases (Sethi, 2003). In the context of natural disaster, the public
awareness about disaster relief
fund-raising appeal exerts huge
pressure on ﬁrms to make philanthropic giving. But because of
different visibility in the front of the public, ﬁrms in the service sector
may face more pressures and thus donate more than ﬁrms in the
industrial sector.

Hypothesis 4. Firms in the service sector commit more philanthropic
giving than ﬁrms in the industrial sector.

4. Method

4.1. Data collection

To test the above hypotheses, the study uses the donating behav-
ior of Chinese listed companies in Wenchuan earthquake as the
sample. The May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake caused 69,227
deaths, and 374,643 people injured and 17,923 disappeared. The
direct property loss reaches more than RMB 840 billion (Legal
Evening News, 2008-9-4).

After the earthquake, many Chinese companies initiated disaster
relief donation immediately and voluntarily, while others also
responded to it but somewhat lately. The giving made by companies
includes cash and materials. Most of companies committed their
giving through the hands of non-government organizations (NGOs)
such as the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC), China Foundation for
Poverty Alleviation (CFPA), and China Charity Federation (CCF).

To date, no veriﬁed and complete data exists about the
philanthropic giving of listed companies available. In addition, some
listed companies did not report their earthquake donation in their
annual reports. Contrary to that, the online media in China intensively
report the contributions of companies especially those who made
contribution within May 2008. Therefore, in this study we select the
listed companies collected by the two leading websites in China — the
Baidu.com (http://ﬁnance.baidu.com/hongguan/guonei/2008-05-19/
100237.html) and the Sina.com (http://ﬁnance.sina.com.cn/stock/
blank/wcjiuzai.shtml) — as the sample. These two websites collect
the contributions of thousands of companies. However, among the
companies, there are only 295 listed in Chinese domestic stock
markets. Besides, since the earthquake took place in May 2008,
companies who got listed after May 2008 are not suitable for this
study. Finally, some companies made their donation in mixture of the
company, the employees and their control shareholder. Therefore, if
we cannot distinguish the companies' donation from their employees
or control shareholders, we deleted those companies from our
sample. By doing so, we ﬁnally got a sample consisting of 254 listed
companies.

The donation used in this study includes both cash and materials.
In order to ensure the validity of the data, we checked the data by
comparing them with those reported in each ﬁrm's annual report,
ofﬁcial website, its announcement and CSR report if there is one. By
doing that, we found that several companies donated more than once.
Few companies conducted donation even after the report made by the
two websites (Baidu.com and Sina.com). As a result, we adjusted the
data of those companies. The value of materials is transferred to cash
according to the declaration of the companies. Since the subject we
want to examine is the ﬁrm, the philanthropic giving from individuals
is subtracted from the total contribution.


1380

Y. Gao / Journal of Business Research 64 (2011) 1377–1382

Other data come mainly from the annual report of each company
directly. Besides, since not all companies report the political ties of
their Chairman of the board or chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) in the
annual report, we supplement the data of political ties by searching
them through search engines such as google.com and baidu.com.

4.2. Measurement of variables

This research measures variables in the following ways. Philan-
thropic giving (GIV) is measured by the sum of organization-level
donation in RMB of companies to May 12, 2008 earthquake relief. The
natural logarithm transformation was used to achieve a univariate
normal distribution.

Firm size (SIZE), as in Lenway and Rehbein (1991), is measured as
the total value of assets in RMB at the end of 2007. The natural logarithm
transformation was used to achieve a univariate normal distribution.

Political ties (P_TIE) is deﬁned as either the Chairman of the board
or the CEO of a ﬁrm is at the same time a public ofﬁcial, or a member of
congress (Faccio et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2007), or a member of People's
Political Consultative Conference in early 2008. Firms having political
ties are labeled as 1, otherwise 0.

Ownership type (O_TYP) is a dummy variable in this study with
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) being coded as 1 and otherwise 0. The
distinction among different ownership companies is based on the
identity of the leading or largest shareholder. A company is coded as
SOE when its leading shareholder is the agent of the state (e.g., the
state or local state-owned assets supervision and administration
commission) or another SOE. Other companies are coded as non SOEs.
Industry type (I_TYP) is a dummy variable with service companies
being coded as 1 and otherwise 0. The distinction among different
industrial companies is based on the “Classiﬁcation of Industries for
National Economy” (GB/T4754-2002) of China. This classiﬁcation
divides national economy into three industries, including primary,
secondary and tertiary industry. Companies in primary industry are
relating to agricultural production. Companies in secondary industry
refer mainly to manufacturers. Companies in tertiary industry are
service providers. Therefore, companies in tertiary industry are
regarded as service companies and coded as 1 while companies in
primary and secondary industry are regarded as non service
companies and coded as 0.

This research controls for organizational proﬁtability and leverage.
Literature has found that proﬁtability (Adams and Hardwick, 1998;
Crampton and Patten, 2008; Seifert et al., 2003) and leverage
(Roberts, 1992; Adams and Hardwick, 1998) are associated with
corporate philanthropic giving. Proﬁtability (ROA), as in Bandeira-de-
Mello et al. (2008), is measured as the “Return on Assets” in 2007.
Leverage (LEVE) is measured as the ratio of total debt to the total
value of assets in 2007.

5. Analysis and results

5.1. Descriptive statistics

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the characteristics of ﬁrms. Table 1
shows ﬁrms' donations in absolute value range from RMB 100
thousand to RMB 67 million, with a median donation of 1.45 million.

Firm size is measured by the total value of assets. The biggest
company has up to RMB 8680 billion assets, while the smallest one
has only RMB 150 million. The medium assets are about RMB
3.0 billion.

The median proﬁtability is 4.90%, with the maximum 231.74% and
the minimum −35.91%. The maximum of leverage reaches 156.72%,
while the minimum is only 4.44%. The median of leverage is 53.29%.
Table 2 shows that 104 ﬁrms are state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
which accounts for 40.9% of the total sample. The remainder includes
private, collective, and foreign companies. Firms locate in different
industries, with minority (71 or 28%) of them being in service sector.
120 companies have political ties, which accounts for 47.2% of the
total sample.

5.2. Analysis and results

Table 3 summarizes the means, standard deviations, and Pearson
correlations among the variables. From the Pearson correlations we
can see that leverage (LEVE), ﬁrm size (ln SIZE), political ties (P_TIE),
and ownership type (O_TYP) are signiﬁcantly associated with
corporate philanthropic giving (ln GIV), while ﬁrm's proﬁtability
(PROF) and industrial type (I_TYP) are not signiﬁcantly associated
with corporate philanthropic giving.

Besides, among the independent variables, political ties (P_TIE),
ownership type (O_TYP) and industrial type (I_TYP) are signiﬁcantly
associated with ﬁrm size (ln SIZE), and ownership type (O_TYP) are
signiﬁcantly related to industrial type (I_TYP). The coefﬁcients may
suggest that there may be slight collinearity problem. Therefore, in the
following regression analysis we put the independent variables into
the model one by one. Meanwhile, the values of Tolerance and VIF
(variance inﬂation factor) are also calculated.

In order to further test the hypotheses proposed formerly, multiple
regression analyses are conducted by using Ordinary least square
(OLS) as method and SPSS (16.0 edition) as tool. We ﬁrst test the
effects of controlled variables on dependent variable (corporate
philanthropic giving). Following that we add the four independent
variables into the model step by step. Finally, we put all the variables
into the model. Table 4 reports the results of regression analysis.

From Model (1) we can ﬁnd that the two control variables have a
signiﬁcant effect on corporate philanthropic giving. Both the effects of
proﬁtability and leverage are positive.

From Model (2) to Model (5) we can see when the independent
variables are put into the model one by one, all variables have a
signiﬁcantly positive effect on corporate philanthropic giving at the
level of 0.05 except industrial type (I_TYP).

From Model (6) putting all the variables into the model, the
direction and signiﬁcance of some variables changed. This may
indicate that some signiﬁcant interactions exist among the variables.
According to the rule of thumb in the econometric literature (a VIF
N10 or a tolerance level b0.1 are signs of severe multicollinearity
problems), there is no signiﬁcant collinear relationships among these
independent variables.

According to Model (6), the F value (=41.558) is signiﬁcant
(p b0.01) and adjusted R2 is 0.490, which indicates that the
combination of these variables can explain about 49% of the variance
of the level of corporate philanthropic giving.

Firm size (Ln SIZE) (β= 0.651, p b0.01) is found to have a
signiﬁcant and positive effect on corporate philanthropic disaster
relief giving. This result keeps in line with the ﬁndings of many
previous research (e.g., Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Buchholtz et al.,
1999; Brammer and Millington, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009) and suggests
that large ﬁrms do donate more than smaller ﬁrms. This ﬁnding
conforms to our expectation, and thus Hypothesis 1 is supported.

Political ties (P_TIE) (β=0.258, p b0.01) is found to be signiﬁ-
cantly and positively associated with corporate philanthropic disaster
relief giving. This ﬁnding is in line with our expectation and suggests
that companies who have political ties donate more than those
companies who do not have political ties. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is
supported.

Ownership type (O_TYP) (β=−0.037, p N0.05) is found to have a
negative but insigniﬁcant effect on corporate philanthropic giving.
This ﬁnding suggests that SOEs donate no more than non SOEs. This
result is out of our expectation and thus Hypothesis 2 is not
supported.

Industry type (I_TYP) (β=−0.136, p b0.01) has a negative and
signiﬁcant effect on corporate philanthropy. It suggests that service
companies donate signiﬁcantly less than non service companies. The
result is contrary to our expectation and thus Hypothesis 3 is refused.
Among the control variables, the effect of proﬁtability keeps
signiﬁcant and positive while the effect of leverage changes from
signiﬁcantly positive to insigniﬁcantly negative. The results suggest
that ﬁrms who have high proﬁtability donate more than ﬁrms who
have lower proﬁtability. Firms who have high leverage donate slightly
less than ﬁrms who have lower leverage but the extent is not
signiﬁcant.

6. Conclusion and discussion

This study investigates that if companies in China tend to use
philanthropic disaster relief giving to alleviate their institutional

pressure and thus to build their good images in the front of the
government, the media and the public alike.

The results show that large ﬁrms and ﬁrms who have political ties
donate more than smaller ﬁrms and ﬁrms who do not have political
ties. Since large ﬁrms receive high pressure from the government, the
media and the public, while the ﬁrms who have political ties receive
high pressure from the government, the results of this research partly
support the argument that high institutional pressure leads ﬁrms to
donate more to disaster relief.

However, the study ﬁnds state-owned enterprises (SOEs) donate
no more to disaster relief than non SOEs. This ﬁnding is interesting
and out of our expectation. The possible reason may be that many
SOEs are large ﬁrms and have a large number of employees. The
donation of individual workers in SOEs is so big that even the
organizational donation is less; the amount of donation is still very
signiﬁcant. Therefore, SOEs are not forced to donate more than non
SOEs.

Besides, we ﬁnd that service companies donate signiﬁcantly less
than non service companies. This result is also out of our expectation
and different from the ﬁndings of Burt (1983), Fry et al. (1982) and
Clotfelter (1985). The possible reasons may be that most non-service
companies in our sample produce consumer goods rather than
industrial goods. As a result, they may perceive higher pressure
from consumers than service companies who sell the products. After
all, consumers care more about the manufacturers rather than the
sellers. Therefore, it suggests that further research should divide non
service companies into two categories: those who produce consumer
goods and those who produce industrial goods.

In sum, this research supports the institutional pressure viewpoint
of corporate philanthropy. We demonstrate the usefulness of
institutional theory in explaining the corporate philanthropic beha-
viors. This is different from the mainstream point of view about
corporate philanthropy which argues that ﬁrms conduct philanthropy
based merely on rational economic considerations. Besides, although
Oliver (1991) argues that ﬁrms may engage in “window dressing” and
other symbolic behaviors to avoid sharing social responsibility
genuinely, our research ﬁnds that they are less likely to avoid their
social responsibility under high institutional pressure. Finally, though
many scholars identiﬁed the potential value of political ties (or even
guanxi with other stakeholders) in China, our research demonstrates
that the effect of guanxi is dual. Good guanxi with the government
also increases a ﬁrm's vulnerability to support the government's
needs and expectations.

The limitations of the study lie in the following aspects. First, the
data of charitable donation of ﬁrms used in this study only include the
donations to earthquake relief. Since ﬁrms might contribute to other
socially responsible programs too, the results we get from this study
cannot explain companies' social responsible behavior thoroughly.
Second, some organizational characteristics, such as the ﬁnancial
performance and capital structure, rise and fall frequently, and thus
inﬂuence their capability of supporting philanthropy. Therefore, a
time series analysis should be better than cross-sectional analysis in
explaining the corporate philanthropy.
