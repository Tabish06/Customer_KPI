Business Reputation and Labor Efﬁciency,
Productivity, and Cost

ABSTRACT. Assumed benefits from improved reputa-
tion are often used as motives to drive corporate social
responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Are improved cost effi-
ciencies among these reputation benefits? Cost efficien-
cies and cost management have become more relevant as
revenue streams dry up in these tough economic times.
Can a good reputation aid these efforts to develop cost
efficiencies specifically when managing labor costs? Prior
research hypothesizes that good reputation can create
labor productivity and efficiency benefits. The purpose of
this study is to empirically investigate reputation’s rela-
tionship with labor efficiency,
labor productivity, and
labor cost. Using a sample of highly reputable firms from
Fortune’s America’s Most Admired Companies list and a
corresponding matched sample of ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that
reputation is associated with improved labor efﬁciency
and labor productivity. However, we do not ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant association between reputation and reduced labor
costs. Our study contributes to current research hypoth-
esizing and ﬁnding efﬁciency beneﬁts associated with
good reputation. Documenting these potential reputation
beneﬁts has important implications for CSR activities and
initiatives. It
incorporates
reputation into a more developed model of the rela-
tionship between CSR and performance (Vilanova et al.:
2009, Journal of Business Ethics 87, 57–69). This work is
useful to businesses and supports strategies focused on
‘‘doing well by doing good’’ and maintaining healthy
reputations.

Introduction

The current global economic downturn and result-
ing tough economic times have captured the atten-
tion of the American public, the U.S. government
and certainly world-wide businesses. Uncertainty in
the current recession has caused business activity and
revenues to stagnate. Utilizing resources, controlling
costs, and improving efﬁciencies become increas-
ingly critical in this current lean economic envi-
ronment. What tools can businesses use to create and
improve cost efﬁciencies? In particular, can reputa-
tion be used to improve efﬁciencies and speciﬁcally
labor efﬁciencies?

reputation’s potential beneﬁts drive CSR decisions
and activities. In fact, recent work proposes that
reputation plays a critical role in the relationship
between CSR and performance (Vilanova et al.,
2009; Wu, 2006, p. 163). Our study investigates and
documents reputation’s potential
labor efﬁciency
beneﬁts.

In general, economic efﬁciency is a resource
utilization concept, which refers to the production
of goods and services (i.e., productivity) from a given
quantity (i.e., cost) of resources (Sullivan and Shef-
frin, 2003, p. 15).1 When we speciﬁcally apply this
general efﬁciency concept to labor resources, we
deﬁne labor efﬁciency as a measure of labor pro-
ductivity per unit of labor cost. In other words, labor
efﬁciency is a measure of labor resource utilization.
Prior work hypothesizes that a good reputation is
valuable because, among other beneﬁts, it can create
labor
(Fombrun,
1996; Podolny, 1993). The idea is that good repu-
tation can attract and motivate good employees

less compensation for

(Roberts and Dowling, 2002). Employee attraction
can result in lower labor costs. As good employees are
attracted to reputable ﬁrms, they may be willing to
accept
the employment
opportunity with reputable ﬁrms. Economically
speaking, high-reputation ﬁrms attract employees
resulting in a larger labor supply competing for jobs
with high-reputation ﬁrms. The increased labor
supply drives down wages. In addition, employee
motivation results in a productivity beneﬁt. As good
employees are motivated by the ﬁrm’s reputation,
they may work harder for reputable ﬁrms. The
hypothesized changes in lower labor costs and higher
labor productivity should result in increased labor
efﬁciency.

straightforward as

The relationships between reputation, labor costs,
labor productivity, and labor efﬁciency may not be
as
initially presented. Tension
exists, particularly when it comes to labor costs.
Reputation may not decrease labor costs. High-
reputation ﬁrms may choose to pay employees more
to maintain employee relationships. Market forces
may play the determinative role in setting wages
regardless of employer or employee preferences.
Reputation may actually be associated with higher
labor costs. In fact, if increased labor costs trump
improved productivity beneﬁts,
labor efﬁciency
would decrease. The purpose of our study is to
empirically examine these labor efﬁciency, produc-
tivity, and cost hypotheses.

We use a sample of highly reputable ﬁrms from
Fortune’s Most Admired Companies list along with
a sample of matched ﬁrms to test our hypotheses.
We ﬁnd that reputation is positively associated with
labor efﬁciency. This result is due to a positive
association between reputation and labor produc-
tivity. We ﬁnd no association between reputation
and labor costs.

Our work adds to research supporting the per-
formance beneﬁts of a good reputation. Our results
imply that companies with superior reputation can
attract good employees who work more produc-
tively and efﬁciently. These results should be of
interest
to managers who develop strategies and
engage in behavior leading to or maintaining a po-
sitive corporate reputation – including CSR initia-
tives. Also,
the results can increase individual
investors’ conﬁdence in investing in companies with
superior reputation.

Literature, motivation, and hypotheses
development

Many studies have analyzed the relationship between
CSR and ﬁnancial performance (Chand and Fraser,
2006; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001) and suggested
that performance is indeed a key driver for adopting
CSR (Bansal and Roth, 2000; Haigh and Jones,
2006; Hess et al., 2002; Juholin, 2004; Porter and
Van Der Linde, 1995). Most studies hypothesize a
positive association between CSR and ﬁnancial
performance (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; McWilliams
and Siegel, 2001) although results are inconclusive
(Chand and Fraser, 2006) and the nature of the
relationship between CSR and performance is still
somewhat unclear (Harrison and Freeman, 1999;
McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Porter and Kramer,
2006; Smith, 2003).

Recent work summarizes the general ﬁndings and
conclusions from CSR research through literature
reviews (Beurden and Go¨ ssling, 2008; Roman et al.,
1999), meta-analyses (Allouche and Laroche, 2005;
Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006), and bibliometric
analyses (De Bakker et al., 2005). This work gen-
erally ﬁnds clear empirical evidence for a positive
relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance and, in some cases, a positive relationship
between reputation measures and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. Recently, Vilanova et al. (2009) built on this
work and developed a framework to clarify the
nature of the positive relationship between CSR and
performance dimensions of competitiveness. If CSR
affects performance, the positive CSR–performance
relationship can imply that CSR enhances a com-
pany’s reputation (Nikolai et al., 1976; Wu, 2006,
p. 163). Reputation improvements beneﬁt
the
company’s performance in numerous ways. Vilanova
et al. (2009, p. 63) use these ideas to model a clear
connection between CSR and performance, and this
connection begins with issues of image and reputa-
tion. CSR strongly inﬂuences reputation, and rep-
utation is a key determinant of ﬁrm competitiveness
(Vilanova et al., 2009, p. 60). In other words, CSR
impacts ﬁrm competitiveness mainly through repu-
tation;
reputation links CSR and performance
(Vilanova et al., 2009, p. 63). Figure 1 presents a
modiﬁed and simpliﬁed version of the Vilanova et al.
(2009) model along with some selected literature
supporting the model’s relationships.

in Figure 1. As

In its 2001 Green Paper, the European Union
deﬁnes CSR as
‘‘a concept whereby companies
integrate social and environmental concerns in their
business operations and in their interaction with
their stakeholders on a voluntary basis… [This]
means not only fulﬁlling legal expectations, but also
going beyond compliance and investing ‘‘more’’ into
human capital, the environment and the relations
with stakeholders’’ (Commission of the European
Communities, 2001, p. 6, emphasis added).2 Vila-
nova et al. (2009) identify ﬁve categories of CSR
activities
identiﬁed in Figure 1,
investing ‘‘more’’
into human capital, workplace,
and labor practices is an important CSR component
that could inﬂuence subsequent
labor efﬁciency
performance through reputation effects. Fombrun
(1996, p. 72) deﬁnes reputation as ‘‘a perceptual
representation of a company’s past actions and future
prospects that describe the ﬁrm’s overall appeal to all
its key constituents when compared to other leading
rivals.’’ Roberts and Dowling (2002) suggest that
corporate reputation is a general organizational
attribute that reﬂects the extent to which external
stakeholders view the company as ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘bad.’’
As a key constituent stakeholder group, employees’

views of company reputation and appeal can affect
labor efﬁciency, productivity, and cost which,
in
turn, can affect the company’s overall performance
and competitiveness. Vilanova et al. (2009, pp. 59–
60) propose that competitiveness can be deﬁned and
grouped on ﬁve key dimensions of performance
listed in Figure 1: (1) ﬁnancial performance (Hamel
and Prahalad, 1989), (2) quality and customer satis-
faction (Barney, 1991), (3) innovation (Mintzberg,
1993), (4) image (Kay, 1993), and (5) productivity
and efﬁciency (Porter, 1985). Note that productively
and efﬁciently utilizing resources – including labor
resources, the focus of our work – is among the key
performance dimensions of competitiveness.

Reputation’s performance effects are an important
driver used to sell CSR policies within organiza-
tions. Since reputation is currently an accepted and
valued intangible asset (Schnietz and Epstein, 2005),
managers seem to focus on reputation to force cor-
porate change toward implementing CSR (Vilanova
et al., 2009, p. 63). As a result, reputation acts as a
fundamental driver to initiate and implement CSR
(Vilanova et al., 2009, p. 64). Given the importance
of reputation’s performance effects in driving CSR
activity, the purpose of this article is to build on the

impact of

Reputation becomes an increasingly valuable asset
in turbulent economic times. Strategic management
theory suggests
that good reputation can create
competitive advantages for ﬁrms (Fombrun, 1996).
These advantages can buffer ﬁnancial performance in
insulating reputable businesses
a variety of ways
from the full
tough economic times
(Dowling, 2001). First, reputation can protect rev-
enues (Fombrun, 1996) from economic downturns.
Customers value relationships with high-reputation
ﬁrms and may pay a premium for offerings of high-
reputation ﬁrms especially in uncertain markets and
economies (Shapiro, 1983). Second, good reputation
can help create cost advantages (Podolny, 1993,
pp. 838–841) and is associated with ﬁrm efﬁciencies
(Stuebs and Sun, 2009). Good reputation can
improve trust and relationships with a number of
stakeholders, which can lead to reduced costs and
improved efﬁciencies. Podolny (1993, pp. 838–841)
notes a number of cost reductions that can result
from improved reputation. Since good reputation
attracts customers, advertising costs
for attract-
ing business are lower. Good reputation improves
stakeholder
and lowers
transaction costs. A good reputation can also lower
ﬁnancial costs. Finally, if employees are willing to
accept lower compensation in exchange for a good
reputation (Frank, 1985), they should be willing to
accept less compensation to work for a ﬁrm with a
better reputation.

relationships

and trust

Labor costs generally provide a ready target for
utilization, cost control, and efﬁciency efforts since
they are a signiﬁcant cost component of operations
and production (Blinder, 1990; Freeland et al.,
1979).3 Given the signiﬁcance of
labor costs,
improving the efﬁciency of labor and labor costs is
critical in the current environment. Traditionally,
tying compensation to performance through forms of
contingent compensation4 has been used as a tangible,
extrinsic approach to control, motivate, and improve labor
efﬁciency. In general, forms of variable compensation
and monetary incentives are intended to increase
employee effort, which increases employee perfor-
mance, productivity, and efﬁciency (Bonner and
Sprinkle, 2002).5 In reality, the ﬂexibility and adapt-
ability of contingent, pay-for-performance compen-

sation also shifts risk from the ﬁrm to employees. Note
that using contingent compensation does not neces-
sarily increase total compensation; it makes com-
pensation more ﬂexible and volatile. In fact, ﬁrms use
contingent compensation as a way to manage and
mitigate risk in response to demand uncertainty, labor
supply uncertainty, and turbulence (Bloom and
Milkovich, 1998; Clinton, 1997; Milner and Pinker,
2001; Pinker and Larson, 2003; Stroh et al., 1996). In
sum, compensation policies have been used as an
extrinsic approach to increase labor productivity,
reduce risk, and improve labor efﬁciency by tying
compensation to performance.

a

intangible,

complementary,

Whereas contingent compensation provides an
extrinsic approach to managing labor, reputation
provides an intrinsic approach. Research (e.g., Di-
erickx and Cool, 1989; Fombrun and Shanley,
1990; Herremans et al., 1993; Landon and Smith,
1997) examining the relation between reputation
and performance generally supports a positive rela-
tionship between reputation and various perfor-
mance dimensions. Since reputation can create cost
advantages and is associated with cost efﬁciencies
(Stuebs and Sun, 2009), can a ﬁrm’s reputation be
used as
intrinsic
approach to control, motivate, and improve labor efﬁ-
ciency? Literature has hypothesized that reputation
can generate labor beneﬁts because ‘‘ceteris paribus,
employees prefer
to work for high-reputation
ﬁrms’’ (Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p. 1079). This
employee preference is hypothesized to yield two
results both of which positively affect efﬁciency.
First, there is a productivity result. A good reputation
is a company asset that can attract
talented and
skilled employees. In addition, these employees will

(Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p. 1079). Second,
there could be a cost advantage. As employees prefer
high-
reputation ﬁrms, they are willing to work for a
lower cost ceteris paribus (Podolny, 1993; Roberts
and Dowling, 2002). Economically, this employee
preference for high-reputation ﬁrms increases the
labor supply competing for jobs with high-reputa-
tion ﬁrms. An increased labor supply drives down
wages. Improved labor productivity with lower cost

Tension exists in our hypotheses, however, par-
ticularly the labor cost hypothesis. While a good
reputation can improve labor productivity and, as a
result, labor efﬁciency, there are several reasons why
a good reputation may not lead to decreased labor
costs even if employees would be willing to work for
a lower cost ceteris paribus. First, high-reputation
ﬁrms may not reduce compensation to employees
even if they could. Reputation is built by valuing and
maintaining stakeholder relationships, not by taking
advantage of them to gain cost advantages. Firms
may choose to pay employees more to maintain
employee relationships. Second, market forces play a
role in determining compensation levels across ﬁrms
even if employees are willing to work for less. In
addition, ﬁrms with higher reputations could attract
higher quality employees
(i.e., more productive
employees) at comparable compensation levels. As a
result, a positive relationship between reputation and
labor costs can be hypothesized. In fact, if increased
labor costs trump productivity beneﬁts, reputation
may be negatively associated with labor efﬁciency.
These tensions result in the following alternative
‘‘labor cost increase’’ and ‘‘labor efﬁciency decrease’’
hypotheses. Note that we use H2b to label the labor
cost increase hypothesis to maintain consistency with
our ﬁrst set of hypotheses above.

H2: Labor efﬁciency decrease hypothesis: Reputa
tion is negatively associated with labor efﬁ-
ciency.

H2b: Labor cost increase hypothesis: Reputation is

positively associated with labor costs.

Measurement of labor and reputation variables

In this article, we speciﬁcally hypothesize a positive
relationship between reputation and labor efﬁciency,

and then disaggregate labor efﬁciency into produc-
tivity and cost components to further explore the
fundamental drivers of labor efﬁciency. We use the
following model to explain the relationship between
efﬁciency, productivity, and cost6:

Labor efficiency ¼ Labor productivity

Labor cost

ð1Þ

Labor efﬁciency is a labor resource utilization mea-
sure that is a function of
labor productivity per
unit of labor cost.7 In this study, we measure and
operationalize the labor variables in Eq. 1 as fol-
lows: Labor efﬁciency = Income/Labor Costs, Labor
productivity = Income/employees, Labor cost = La-
bor costs/employees.

‘‘Income’’

in the labor efﬁciency and labor
productivity measures above refers to income be-
fore labor costs. We chose income before labor
costs as our labor output measure because we feel
that it best isolates output attributable to labor gi-
ven the limitations of our data. Using Eq. 2 to
conceptualize income helps us communicate our
choice:
Income ¼ Sales   Labor costs   Capital costs
ð2Þ
Labor and capital are the two primary productive
economic resource categories. Income represents
sales less labor and capital costs. We then rearrange
terms by moving labor costs to yield Eq. 3:

Income + Labor costs ¼ Sales   Capital costs

ðLabor costs=Employees)
ð4Þ
Labor cost measures the average labor cost per em-
ployee. Labor productivity measures the income
generated per employee. Labor efﬁciency then
measures the income generated per unit of labor
cost.

Reputation is hypothesized to be associated with
these labor variables. We use Fortune’s
list of
America’s Most Admired Companies to measure
reputation in two ways.9 The ﬁrst way we measure
reputation is by a simple, dichotomous presence/
absence indicator measurement. We compare ﬁrms
on America’s Most Admired Companies list to a
similar set of matched ﬁrms10 not on America’s Most
Admired Companies list. Our second measure of
reputation uses the actual reputation scores for ﬁrms
on the Most Admired list and is a more detailed
measure of reputation. Fortune’s reputation score can
range from 0 to 10. Higher scores represent better
reputation. The overall score is the mean score
averaging ratings ranging from 0 to 10 from several
key attributes of reputation including: (1) quality of
management, (2) quality of products/service offered,
(3) innovativeness, (4) value as a long term invest-
ment, (5) soundness of ﬁnancial position, (6) ability
to attract/develop/keep talented people, (7) respon-
sibility to the community and environment, and (8)
wise use of corporate assets.

The disaggregated elements of Fortune’s reputa-
tion scores point to positive relationships among
CSR, reputation and labor productivity. The repu-
tation score contains elements related to CSR (e.g.,
responsibility to the community and environment).
Many of the reputation elements also identify cor-
porate responsibilities to various stakeholder groups,
for example: (1) customers: quality of products/ser-
vices offered and innovativeness, (2) employees: abil-
ity to attract/develop/keep talented people.
In
addition, the reputation element ‘‘ability to attract/
develop/keep talented people’’ gives reason to be-
lieve that the reputation score should be positively
related to labor productivity.

The criteria for our reputation and labor variables
drive our sample selection. Our sample data come
from two sources. We obtain reputation data from
Fortune’s company lists of America’s Most Admired
from 2006 to 2008.11 The available
Companies
sample of listed reputation ﬁrms consists of 926 ﬁrm-
year observations. Labor and ﬁnancial data come
from Compustat. Since the list of America’s Most
Admired Companies is published in March, we use
the prior year’s Compustat ﬁnancial data in our
analysis (e.g., ﬁrms on Fortune’s 2006 Most Admired
Companies list use 2005 Compustat data). After
matching our sample of reputable ﬁrms with avail-
able Compustat labor and ﬁnancial data, our ﬁnal
sample consists of 112 ﬁrm-year observations.12
Table I Panel A reconciles
the sample selection
process. Panel B presents the sample’s distribution
across broad industry categories. For instance, 43 out
of
the 112 ﬁrm-year observations are from the
manufacturing industries, while 30 sample ﬁrm-year
observations come from the ﬁnance industries.

We refer to the sample of 112 ﬁrm-year obser-
vations obtained from Fortune’s Most Admired
Companies list as our ‘‘reputation sample.’’ For each
reputation sample ﬁrm, a matched ﬁrm within the
same industry13 and with similar ﬁrm size (measured
by total assets) is selected. We refer to this sample of
matched ﬁrms as our ‘‘matched sample.’’ Together,
our reputation sample and matched sample create
our ‘‘full sample’’ of 224 ﬁrm-year observations.
Table II presents selected descriptive statistics for
reputation sample and matched sample ﬁrms (Panel
A) along with tests for mean differences between the
two samples (Panel B).

The mean labor efﬁciency for reputation sample
ﬁrms in Table II (1.571) is signiﬁcantly higher than
the mean labor efﬁciency for matched sample ﬁrms
(1.033) (pt-test < 0.0001, pWilcoxon < 0.0001). This
result provides initial support for our ﬁrst hypothesis
of a positive relationship between reputation and
labor efﬁciency (H1). Additional results in Table II
indicate that this labor efﬁciency relationship is pri-
marily driven by labor productivity. The signiﬁcant

ﬁrms (118.469) and matched sample ﬁrms (68.354)
provides preliminary support for a positive associa-
tion between reputation and labor productivity
(H1a). There is, however, no difference in labor cost
per employee between sample and matched ﬁrms
providing no initial support for either labor cost
hypothesis (H1b, H2b). The mean labor cost per
employee is
slightly and non-signiﬁcantly (pt-test
= 0.3842, pWilcoxon = 0.0638) higher for reputation
sample ﬁrms (73.362) relative to matched sample
ﬁrms (69.449). The increase in labor efﬁciency for
high-reputation ﬁrms is primarily due to an increase
in labor productivity.

There are no signiﬁcant differences between rep-
utation sample and matched sample ﬁrms on other
control variables according to t-test results: assets,
leverage, and the market-to-book ratio. In addition,
descriptive statistics on reputation score are reported
for reputation sample ﬁrms. The mean score is 6.904.
The Pearson correlation matrix in Table III also
provides initial support for a positive association
between reputation and labor efﬁciency consistent
with the mean differences results.

Labor efﬁciency is positively (0.3089) and signiﬁ-
cantly (p < 0.0001) correlated with the dichotomous

reputation variable, REPU. It
is also statistically
(p < 0.0001) positively (0.4377) correlated with For-
tune’s reputation score, Score. Both correlations lend
additional initial support for the positive association
between reputation and labor efﬁciency (H1). This
result is primarily driven by positive correlations
between labor productivity and the reputation vari-
ables which provide additional support for our labor
productivity increase hypothesis (H1a). Labor pro-
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.0001) positively
ductivity is
(0.3116) correlated with REPU and signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.0001) positively (0.4317) correlated with
Score. There are non-signiﬁcant positive correlations
between labor cost and the reputation variables,
which provide no initial support for H1b or H2b.

Table III reports

some interesting correlations
between the labor variables and the additional con-
trol variables. Speciﬁcally,
the correlation results
indicate why it is important to include these control
variables in subsequent analyses. The central issue is
that capital resources (i.e., assets) can also affect our
labor efﬁciency and labor productivity metrics.
Income before labor costs – the numerator in our
labor efﬁciency and productivity metrics – is not
solely a perfect measure of labor production. Instead,

income is a joint measure of total company pro-
duction from all company resources – both labor
resources and capital resources.14 In other words, the
income numerator is inﬂuenced by both the pro-
ductivity of labor resources and the productivity of
capital resources. However, our labor efﬁciency and
labor productivity denominators (i.e., labor costs and
employees, respectively) are only inﬂuenced by the
quantity of labor resources. Thus, it is possible to
inﬂuence and inﬂate our labor efﬁciency and pro-
ductivity metrics simply by shifting the composition
of production resources from labor to capital.

Additional capital assets can be used to generate
labor
more income with the same amount of
resources. Our labor efﬁciency and productivity
measures would increase as a result. An illustrative
example would be automating a production process

to generate the same or an increased amount of in-
come. A portion of production resources would shift
from labor to capital machinery. The decrease in la-
bor would increase labor efﬁciency and productivity.
This issue inﬂuences our correlation results. We
ﬁnd that companies with more assets are associated
with signiﬁcantly (p = 0.0085) increased (0.1755)
labor efﬁciency and signiﬁcantly (p< 0.0001) in-
creased (0.3112) labor productivity. Additional asset
resources can generate additional income and increase
labor efﬁciency and productivity as a result.

The same issues inﬂuence the market-to-book
(MTB) ratio correlations with labor efﬁciency and
labor productivity. Similar to the efﬁciency and
productivity measures, the MTB ratio’s numerator,
the market value of equity, is inﬂuenced by produc-
tion from both labor resources and capital resources.

the denominator,

However,
the book value of
equity, is only inﬂuenced by capital resources. Unlike
capital assets, labor resources represent ‘‘off balance
sheet’’ resources. They are not included and reported
in a company’s book value (i.e., the denominator of
the MTB ratio).

Shifting resources between capital and labor will
have an opposite effect. Shifting resources from labor
to assets increased labor efﬁciency and productivity by
reducing the ratios’
labor resource denominators
ceteris paribus. However, shifting resources from labor
to assets reduces the MTB ratio. Such a shift will
increase the assets reported in book value, which will
decrease the MTB ratio ceteris paribus. Both labor
efﬁciency and labor productivity are signiﬁcantly

Except for a marginally signiﬁcant (p = 0.0987)
positive (0.1561) correlation between the market-
to-book ratio and reputation score (Score), none of
the additional variables in Table III are signiﬁcantly
correlated with the reputation variables.

Before moving on to more advanced regression
and empirical tests, we can perform additional cor-
relation tests to preliminarily explore the nature of
the causal relationship between reputation and our
labor performance variables. Similar to Preston and
O’Bannon (1997), we compute correlation coefﬁ-
cients between Fortune’s reputation score and the
labor performance variables in both contemporane-
ous and lead–lag combinations to assess the direc-
tional nature of the relationships. Designating each
focal year as Year 2, we compute three reputation
correlation coefﬁcients

labor performance variables (3 9 3 = 9 total repu-
tation–labor performance correlation coefﬁcients in
Table IV):

Reputation lead correlation: Reputation score

Reputation lag correlation: Labor performance
variable (Year 1) versus Reputation score vari-
able (Year 2).

There are a total of 46 usable ﬁrm-year observa-
tions with available data for all the contemporaneous
and lead–lag correlation calculations. Contempora-
neous correlations are relevant both as indicators to
reafﬁrm the direction of the reputation–labor per-
formance relationships and as reference points to
compare the lead–lag results. Our test criterion for
analysis is that the strongest (magnitude and signiﬁ-
cance) of the three correlation test statistics in each
triad of Table IV’s lead–lag correlations indicates the
most important relationship.

The positive (0.5587) contemporaneous correla-
tion between reputation and labor efﬁciency is the
strongest (p < 0.0001) correlation in Panel A. Sim-
ilarly, Panel B reports that the strongest (p = 0.0222)
positive (0.3367) correlation between reputation
and labor productivity is
the contemporaneous
correlation. These results support a contemporane-
ous positive synergy between reputation and both
labor efﬁciency and labor productivity. Panel C
reports no signiﬁcant consistent relationship between
reputation and labor costs. Based on these results, the
relationship between reputation and performance

competitiveness may need to be modiﬁed in Fig-
ure 1 in the case of labor performance variables. The
line connecting reputation and competitiveness
should have arrows going in both directions
reﬂecting the contemporaneous
synergistic rela-
tionship between reputation and labor performance
variables. We will use contemporaneous reputation
and labor performance variables in our regression
analyses based on these results.

Preston and O’Bannon (1997) mention several
qualiﬁcations to this mode of analysis. First, there are
probably some ‘‘halo effects’’ (Wu, 2006, p. 164)
among the reputation ratings, and some of
the
underlying data are known to be serially correlated.
Hence, the data used cannot be assumed to be en-
tirely independent. In addition, the interpretation of
numerical differences among correlation coefﬁcients
is an unsettled issue in statistical theory. For purposes
of analysis, we take all signiﬁcant numerical results at
face value.

Empirical tests

We use regression analyses to test our hypotheses.
The dependent variable in our analyses is one of
the labor performance variables of
(i.e.,
labor efﬁciency, labor productivity, or labor cost)
depending on the hypothesis being tested. The
independent variable of interest in our regressions is

one of the reputation variables (i.e., REPU or Score)
depending on the sample used in the regression. As a
result, we run three different regression analyses on
two samples (i.e., 6 regression analyses = 3 depen-
dent
reputation
variables). The independent
reputation variables
(i.e., REPU and Score) vary between the two sam-
ples’ regressions, while the dependent labor variables
(i.e., labor efﬁciency, labor productivity, and labor
cost) are used in separate regressions within each
sample to test our three hypotheses. First, we use the
full sample of both highly reputable and matched
ﬁrms. In this regression, we use the dichotomous
indicator variable REPU to differentiate between
reputation sample ﬁrms (REPU = 1) and matched
sample ﬁrms (REPU = 0). Consistent with the labor
efﬁciency increase and labor productivity increase
hypotheses, REPU should be positive and signiﬁcant
when labor efﬁciency and labor productivity are
used as dependent variables. REPU could be positive
(H2b) or negative (H1b) when labor cost is used as
the dependent variable according to the labor cost
hypotheses. In addition to reputation, we include
control variables for size, leverage, and the MTB
ratio. Size (i.e., assets) and the MTB ratio are
important control variables given our correlation
results in Table III and our resulting discussion. Our
ﬁrst complete model is as follows:

We also run our regression analysis using only the
reputation sample. This analysis supplements our
initial regression model and should support the initial
regression results. As each of the ﬁrms in our repu-
tation sample has a reputation score, we use that
reputation score (i.e., Score) as our independent
reputation variable in our regression. Score should be
positive when labor efﬁciency and labor productivity
are the dependent labor variables consistent with the
labor efﬁciency increase and labor productivity
increase hypotheses, respectively. According to the
labor cost hypotheses, Score could have a positive
(H2b) or negative (H1b) coefﬁcient when labor cost
is the dependent labor variable. Our second, modi-
ﬁed regression model is presented below:

Results

Labor efﬁciency hypotheses

We present the regression results for the labor efﬁ-
ciency hypotheses in Table V. Panel A reports the
regression results for the full sample of both repu-
tation and matched ﬁrms
(i.e., Eq. 5). Panel B
reports the regression results for the ﬁrms in the
reputation sample only (i.e., Eq. 6).

is positive (0.3821) and signiﬁcant

The labor efﬁciency regression results provide
consistent support for our labor efﬁciency increase
hypothesis (H1) and no support for our labor efﬁ-
ciency decrease hypothesis (H2). The REPU coef-
ﬁcient
(p =
0.0004) in Panel A. The Score coefﬁcient is positive
(0.4234) and signiﬁcant (p < 0.0001) in Panel B.
Both results support the conclusion of a positive
association between reputation and labor efﬁciency.
The assets and MTB ratio control variables are sig-
niﬁcant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0013, respectively)
in Panel A. The coefﬁcient on assets is positive
(0.1252) while the coefﬁcient on the MTB ratio is
negative (-0.0447). These results are consistent with
our discussion of the Pearson correlation results in
Table III. Controlling for assets helps us
isolate
reputation’s relationship with labor efﬁciency. The

next step is to explore the drivers of this positive
association between reputation and labor efﬁciency.

Labor productivity increase hypothesis

Panel A of Table VI reports the regression results
testing the labor productivity hypothesis for the full
sample of all ﬁrms (i.e., Eq. 5). Regression results for
the reputation sample (i.e., Eq. 6) are presented in
Panel B.

The labor productivity regression results support
the labor productivity increase hypothesis. REPU’s
coefﬁcient
is positive (27.6907) and signiﬁcant
(p = 0.003) in Panel A. The Score coefﬁcient is po-
sitive (28.5309) and signiﬁcant (p = 0.0013) in Panel
B. Both results support a positive association be-
tween reputation and labor efﬁciency. Assets are
(p <
positive (16.1752, 13.7821) and signiﬁcant
0.0001, p = 0.0008)
in both Panels A and B,
respectively. The MTB ratio is negative (-3.2806)
and signiﬁcant (p = 0.0063) in Panel A. Again, these
results are consistent with our discussion of
the
Pearson correlation results in Table III. It is impor-
tant to control for assets to help us isolate reputa-
tion’s relationship with labor productivity. Also, the
leverage ratio is negative (-72.2270) and signiﬁcant

reputation and labor productivity appears to be a
driver of the relation between reputation and labor
efﬁciency.

Labor cost hypotheses

The regression results for the labor cost hypothesis
are in Table VII. The results for the full sample are
in Panel A (i.e., Eq. 5) while the results for the
reputation sample are in Panel B (i.e., Eq. 6).

We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant support for either labor
cost hypothesis (H1b or H2b). Both REPU and Score

coefﬁcients
are insigniﬁcantly (p = 0.3663, p =
0.3757, respectively) negative (-4.0354, -2.7919,
respectively), which provides no signiﬁcant support
for any hypothesized association between reputation
and labor costs. However, two of the control vari-
ables have consistent, signiﬁcant relationships with
labor cost. Assets are strongly (p < 0.0001, p <
0.0001) positively (4.4414, 8.5133) associated with
labor costs in Panels A and B, respectively. Larger
ﬁrms are associated with higher labor costs per em-
ployee. Also,
signiﬁcantly
(p = 0.0001, p = 0.0018) negatively (-46.9607,
-50.9611) associated with labor costs per employee.
This result is consistent with the work of Rosett

(2001, 2003). He ﬁnds that labor costs increase ﬁrm
risk. He ﬁnds that ﬁrms decrease their leverage in
response. In summary, our results consistently show
that
reputation is contemporaneously positively
associated with labor efﬁciency, and this result is
primarily driven by the contemporaneous positive
association between reputation and productivity.

Conclusion

Controlling and containing costs is a relevant topic
for businesses in our current, turbulent economic
environment. In this study, we explored whether
there is an association between reputation and labor

efﬁciency. Our work builds on research that
hypothesizes cost advantages for highly reputable
ﬁrms (Fombrun, 1996; Podolny, 1993; Roberts and
Dowling, 2002). We ﬁnd that reputation is posi-
tively associated with labor efﬁciency. While we do
not ﬁnd that reputation is associated with a labor cost
advantage, we do ﬁnd that it is positively associated
with a labor productivity advantage. Our results
contribute to and extend current work that ﬁnds that
highly reputable ﬁrms are more efﬁcient (Stuebs and

Sun, 2009). This work is
expands our understanding of
the beneﬁts and
importance of reputation and is useful to business. It

relationship between CSR and competitiveness. In
other words, these results generate implications for
the use of CSR activities to improve reputation.

The measures we used for labor efﬁciency and
labor productivity created an inherent limitation in
our study. Operating income before labor costs was
used as the numerator in both measures. However,
income is a measure of total company production,
not just an exclusive measure of labor resource pro-
duction. Disaggregating and isolating labor produc-
tion from capital production is a limiting challenge if
not impossible. We used assets as a control variable
in our regressions to address and control for the
potential production effects that capital assets could
have on income in our labor efﬁciency and labor

productivity measures. Future work can explore
alternative ways of isolating labor production and
developing alternative labor production measures.

Additionally, future work can continue to develop
our understanding of the cost efﬁciency beneﬁts of
reputation. For example, Podolny (1993) posits that
reputation affects a number of costs
including
inventory and transaction costs with suppliers,
advertising costs, and ﬁnancing costs in addition to
labor costs. Future work can look at whether repu-
tation is associated with efﬁciencies related to these
other costs as well. This work adds to the literature
uncovering the beneﬁts of a good reputation. It
encourages businesses to continue ‘‘doing well by
doing good’’ and maintain a healthy reputation.

Notes

Marty Stuebs and Li Sun

1 This deﬁnition of efﬁciency is also consistent with
Data Envelopment Analysis
(DEA), a nonparametric
technique that produces measures of performance efﬁ-
ciency by using the ratio of outputs produced to the
cost of
inputs (i.e., a comparison of production with
cost) (Charnes et al., 1978; Cooper et al., 2000; Stuebs
and Sun, 2009).

2 This deﬁnition of CSR is similar to other CSR
deﬁnitions presented over
(Carroll, 1979,
p. 500; Go¨ ssling and Vocht, 2007; Holme and Watts,
1999, p. 3; Wood, 1991, p. 693). Vilanova et al. (2009,
pp. 58–59) group CSR activities into ﬁve categories
presented in Figure 1: (1) CSR vision and governance
activities (Carter et al., 2003; Freeman, 1999; Humble
et al., 1994; Joyner and Payne, 2002; Pruzan, 2001;
Sison, 2000), (2) community relations activities (Free-
man, 1999; Frooman, 1999; Grey, 1996; Hess et al.,
2002; Jones, 1995, Jones and Wicks, 1999), (3) work-

3 For example, Blinder estimates that labor accounts
for at least 70% of total costs in his book on labor prac-
tices in the U.S., Paying for Productivity (1990).

4 Contingent compensation can also include forms of
contingent labor. Contingent labor is ‘‘any job in which
an individual does not have an explicit or implicit con-
tract for long-term employment or one in which the
minimum hours worked can vary in a non-systematic
manner’’ (Polivka, 1996; Polivka and Nardone, 1989,
p. 10). Examples can include part-time employees, tem-
porary employees, temporary agency workers, employ-
ees whose hours vary from week to week, employees
on annual hours contracts, and ﬂextime employees
(Casey et al., 1997).

and Willinger, 2001; Wagner et al., 1988). Sales force
compensation literature suggests that performance-based
contracts improve performance (Basu et al., 1985; Rao,
1990). Banker et al. (2000) found that contingent com-
pensation increases performance in two ways:
(1) a
selection effect and (2) an effort effect.
this decomposition of

labor efﬁciency
into productivity and cost components is similar (after

rearranging terms) to the Du Pont model decomposition
of return on investment (ROI) (Groppelli and Nikbakht,
2000, pp. 444–445). ROI (income/assets) is a measure of
a ﬁrm’s asset productivity. The Du Pont model decom-
poses this productivity measure into efﬁciency and cost
elements. Asset turnover (sales/assets) measures how efﬁ-
ciently a ﬁrm uses assets to generate sales. Return on sales
(income/sales) measures how well a ﬁrm controls costs
and expenses to generate income from sales. The Du

Pont model relates
ity) = Asset Turnover
(efﬁciency) * Return on Sales
(cost control). Efﬁciency, productivity, and cost terms
can be rearranged to yield the relationships in Eq. 1.

7 Note that this labor efﬁciency ratio of productivity
to cost is consistent with the (outputs/inputs) ratio used
in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a nonparametric
statistical technique used to produce measures of perfor-
mance efﬁciency (Charnes et al., 1978; Cooper et al.,
2000; Stuebs and Sun, 2009).

8 We also calculated our labor productivity and labor
efﬁciency measures using Sales instead of Income before
Labor Costs. Unreported regression results and analyses
were qualitatively similar.

9 Using the list of America’s Most Admired Compa-
nies as a proxy for good corporate reputation is consis-
tent with prior work (e.g., Anderson and Smith, 2006;
Damodaran, 2003; McLaughlin et al., 1996; Wang and
Smith, 2008).

tion sample ﬁrm, a matched ﬁrm within the same
industry and with similar ﬁrm size (measured by total
assets) is selected to be a part of the ‘‘matched sample.’’

production from total company resources, it presents a
common issue and challenge whenever it
is used to
measure the production of any isolated resource utiliza-
tion metric: return on assets (ROA) (income/assets) or
return on equity (ROE) (income/equity), for example.

penses. It includes salaries, wages, incentive compensa-
tion, other beneﬁt plans, payroll taxes, pension costs,
