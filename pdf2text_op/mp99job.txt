 Summary Survey participants (N= 175) were drawn from six branches of a major British super-

 market chain. Employees from three branches, who had been selected for transfer to new
 stores, were surveyed before and after relocation to examine the impact of this transition
 on individual well-being. A comparison sample of employees, drawn from similar stores
 but not involved in relocation, was also surveyed. Cross-sectional multiple regression
 analyses found that psychological distress was related to both work demands and
 personal characteristics (gender, neuroticism, locus of control, and social desirability
 response). Furthermore, path analysis revealed that after controlling for prior symptom
 levels, distress during the relocation period was predicted independently by the reloca-
 tion and by work demands. Although in the present study it was not possible to account
 for differences in outcomes between new and comparison store employees in terms of
 changes in measured work characteristics, the negative impact of relocation was found
 to be buffered by perceptions of control and social support. Additionally, the impact of
 high work demands was buffered by Type B personal characteristics. Copyright ( 1999

 Introduction

 Theory and past research suggest that work transitions can be a source of stress, associated with
 negative outcomes in terms of physical and psychological health (Burke, 1988; Levi, 1994). Even
 when changes are intended to be beneficial for employees, the transition period may still carry
 negative side-effects. For example, Karasek (1990) found that Swedish workers who reported
 recent organizational restructuring experienced physical and psychological symptoms during the
 transition, even when the new work structures were superior to previous working conditions.

 Several mechanisms linking change to negative outcomes have been proposed. For instance,

 Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman and Mullan (1981) suggest that humans are 'fundamentally

 intolerant' of change; change creates a state of disequilibrium, and the consequent struggle to
 restore equilibrium makes the organism vulnerable. Others have suggested that the transition
 period is associated with negative work features or 'stressors' which mediate the impact of change
 on individual well-being (Fisher, 1989; Karasek, 1990; Lindorff, 1995). Furthermore, it has been
 suggested that change is only associated with negative consequences under certain conditions.
 That is, the stress of transition can be buffered or moderated by personal and/or social resources
 (Callan, 1993).'

 Mediation describes a mechanism through which workplace transition affects individual well-

 being. More specifically it has been suggested that workplace changes are likely to bring with
 them negative factors such as a temporary loss of control, increased workload and/or reduced
 social support, which in turn have direct negative effects on well-being (Fisher, 1989; Karasek,
 1990). In an empirical study of change, Lindorff (1995) reported that the organizational
 instability associated with mergers and acquisitions increased psychological distress in a sample
 of managers. Similarly Nelson, Cooper and Jackson (1995) found that the association between
 privatization and job dissatisfaction was partially mediated by perceptions of uncertainty among
 utility employees.

 In contrast, moderation refers to specific situational factors or personal characteristics which
 determine whether the transition will be experienced positively or negatively. For example, in a
 study of intracompany transfers, Gerpott (1990) found that those employees who reported high
 interpersonal support did not suffer the increased levels of psychosomatic symptoms reported by
 individuals without such support. Buffering of strain outcomes by high personal control during
 organizational transitions have also been reported (Karasek, 1990; Kotter and Schlesinger, 1979;
 Rafaeli and Sutton, 1986). Furthermore, some studies have shown that the negative effects
 of organizational change were restricted to lower job grades (Ferguson and Cheyne, 1995;
 Olson and Tetrick, 1988). Finally, the compulsory nature of many workplace changes may be
 responsible for negative outcomes: Kirjonen and Hanninen (1986), reported that metal industry
 employees who made voluntary moves in employment showed lower levels of strain symptoms
 than a comparison group who had remained in the same position for at least 5 years.

 Protective personal characteristics, particularly those relating to control beliefs and previous

 experience, have also been implicated as potential buffers of transition stress. For example,
 Ashford (1988) surveyed telephone company employees before and after organizational restruct-
 uring, revealing that responses to change were moderated by an internal locus of control and an
 ability to tolerate ambiguity. Begley and Czajka (1993) used similar methods in a study of
 hospital employees, concluding that perceived stress resulted in strain only for employees with
 low organizational commitment. Likewise, in surveying employees before and after job and home
 relocation, Martin (1995) found that employees showed elevated symptom levels 10 weeks after
 the move, but this effect was moderated by the number moves they had previously made.

 Although not directly testing a buffering hypothesis, other studies have reported associations
 of specific individual differences with more positive outcomes of transition processes. In a study
 of managers moving to newly created jobs, West, Nicholson and Rees (1987) revealed that those
 who were less psychologically stable and with high needs for feedback and predictability,

 ' The distinction between moderation and mediation made throughout this paper is consistent with that described in
 detail by Baron and Kenny (1986). Both moderation and mediation involve the joint action of two independent variables
 in predicting an outcome. Mediator effects reveal the pathways through which an outcome is influenced, such that the
 impact of one variable (e.g. change) on another (e.g. well-being) is transmitted or 'mediated' through a third (e.g. a stress-
 provoking characteristic). In contrast, moderator effects are concerned with the statistical interaction of independent
 variables, in this case describing under what conditions change will be experienced negatively.

 experienced the transition to this inherently unpredictable position as relatively traumatic.
 Similarly, Ashford and Black (1996) reported that individuals with a high desire for control
 played a more active role during organizational entry, resulting in high self-reported performance
 and satisfaction. However, Callan, Terry and Schweitzer (1994) only found evidence of direct
 effects, and not the proposed buffering of coping strategies and social support on well-being
 for lawyers experiencing change: without specific tests of buffering, the evidence reported by
 West et al. and by Ashford and Black, could equally be interpreted as supportive of a main effects
 model.

 Researchers have only rarely been able to examine change as a stressor in a systematic way. In

 reviewing the literature in this area, particular attention is given to the strength of research
 design. The most common, but weakest method is the cross-sectional survey, relying on
 retrospective accounts of the change period, with obvious difficulties of biases in recall, and
 providing little information about the causal direction of observed associations. The studies cited
 above by Karasek (1990), and Kirjonen and Hanninen (1986) were both of this style. Similarly,
 in a retrospective survey of Australian lawyers, Callan et al. (1994) found that lower levels
 of anxiety and depression were linked to judgements of lower levels of recent organizational
 change.

 Longitudinal research has the advantage that baseline levels of well-being can be used to take

 into account chronic symptomatology. Without such control, spurious associations between self-
 reports of negative environmental characteristics and strain outcomes can arise (as discussed by
 Brief, Burke, George, Robinson and Webster, 1988). If conducted over a sufficient time-frame,
 longitudinal studies may also demonstrate the long-term benefits of change. For example, Griffin
 (1991) examined the response to job redesign among bank tellers over 48 months, finding distinct
 results for job satisfaction and performance. Job satisfaction showed initial improvement, but
 then returned to baseline levels, while performance only showed significant improvement after
 24 months, which was sustained to 48 months. In contrast, a longitudinal survey during the
 privatization and structural reorganization of a public utility (Nelson et al., 1995), found that the
 period of privatization was associated with an initial decline in job satisfaction, however a year
 later job satisfaction had risen again. There was also a significant increase in the incidence of
 psychosomatic symptoms over the transition period, which remained high in the follow-up
 period.

 However, in each of these longitudinal studies, there was no comparison or 'no change' group

 in the design, meaning that it is not possible to distinguish between different potential causes of
 the observed trends, such as seasonal fluctuations and wider organizational or economic changes.
 West and Nicholson (1989) overcame this limitation to some extent by conducting a two-wave
 mail survey of 1100 British managers, in which they compared manager groups who had
 experienced different types of job moves. West and Nicholson found that interorganizational and
 upward status job moves were associated with positive outcomes, while immobility can be a form
 of career stagnation. However in this study the 'movers' and 'non-movers' were only disting-
 uished by a self-report measure of job change.

 The quasi-experiment is a stronger design because researchers have more information about,

 and sometimes a degree of control over, the intergroup differences. For example, Theorell, Orth-
 Gomer, Moser, Unden and Eriksson (1995) were able to compare employees who had received a
 stress management intervention under different conditions, with employees who received no
 intervention. They found that the intervention was associated with increased plasma cortisol
 (indicative of distress) in passive worksites, while cortisol decreased in a group which was more
 actively involved with the intervention. An increase in testosterone levels in all groups was
 interpreted as a placebo effect of non-specific attention to the worksites by researchers.

 The Present Study

 The present study was designed to investigate the impact at an individual level of moving to a new
 supermarket branch, where a new edge-of-town branch had been built to replace an older city-
 centre store. This was a compulsory intracompany move in which the majority of employees
 remained in the same status job: the move is therefore without the personal benefits of voluntary
 moves (as noted by Kirjonen and Hanninen, 1986) or upward status and intercompany moves (as
 noted by West and Nicholson, 1989). However, the relatively short distance moved meant that
 employees were not required to move house or otherwise disrupt their domestic life as were the
 employees in Martin's (1995) study.

 Although most employees retained the same job title as in the previous branch, the more

 modern infrastructure of the new premises required updating of some work practices, and the
 staff facilities in the new location were considered to be superior to those in the old premises. The
 new premises were also considerably larger, requiring an expanded management team (usually
 transferred from nearby branches), recruitment of new weekly-paid employees, and reorganiza-
 tion of workgroups. Finally, the opening of a new supermarket generally involves increased
 customer patronage for the thefirst few weeks of trading, although extra staff are scheduled to
 manage this increased workload.

 In summary, although this relocation was less disruptive than some that have been reported in

 the literature, it was also without the advantages such as individual choice or job enrichment. The
 company's previous experience with such moves suggested that the opening period (first 3 months
 of trading) was usually experienced as stressful by employees, but this effect had not previously
 been quantified.

 Three hypotheses about this type of relocation were made:

 Hypothesis 1. Direct effect. The transition period will be associated with reduced individual
 well-being.
 Hypothesis 2. Mediated effect. Following suggestions by Fisher (1989) and Karasek (1990),
 it is predicted that well-being will be affected by the transition through changes in stress-
 provoking work characteristics: a mediation process. Anecdotal evidence from branch
 management suggested that new branch openings tend to involve increased work demands
 (due to a rise in initial customer interest when a new store opens), a decline in social support
 (resulting from rearrangement of established workgroups, and a change in management
 team) and a decrease in perceived control (arising from the uncertainty of work practices in
 the new environment); all work characteristics that have established negative influences
 on individual well-being (e.g. Karasek and Theorell, 1990; Parkes, Mendham and von
 Rabenau, 1994).
 Hypothesis 3. Moderation. The relationship between stress-provoking work conditions
 and strain outcomes will be buffered by positive situational or stress-resilient individual
 characteristics. Regarding potential situational buffers, past research suggests that
 employees with high levels of social support or control do not experience the negative
 consequences of organizational transitions felt by those with low support or control
 (Gerpott, 1990; Rafaeli and Sutton, 1986). Similarly, employees with an internal locus of
 control, or a high desire for control have been suggested to experience lower strain during
 workplace change than individuals without these characteristics (e.g. Ashford, 1988;
 Ashford and Black, 1996).

 Method

 THE EFFECTS OF TRANSITION STRESS 629

 Employee responses to relocation were examined in a quasi-experimental design. Full-time
 employees from three branches, who had been selected for transfer to new stores, were surveyed
 approximately 1 month before and 6 weeks after relocation: a follow-up survey was also made
 after 6 months of trading in the new stores. Furthermore there was a comparison sample of
 employees, drawn from three similar stores but not involved in relocation: each new store was
 paired with a comparison store, and the timing of the surveys was linked to the schedule of
 branch openings.

 Response rates

 Four hundred and twelve questionnaires were sent to the six selected branches. Of these,
 177 employees (43.0 per cent) returned the first questionnaire, and full response to all three
 questionnaires was obtained for 85 participants (20.6 per cent). Response rates were significantly
 higher in comparison stores relative to new branches, among management, and among women.
 Although disappointing, an attrition rate of 50 per cent over a 6-month period is comparable to
 other longitudinal occupational research (e.g. Bateman and Strasser, 1983; Sims, 1977).

 Comparisons between responders and non-responders were possible in terms of several

 variables derived from company records. There were no significant differences in job grade,
 tenure or age. However response rates were significantly higher in the comparison stores relative
 to new branches (X2 = 21.8, 5 df, p < 0.05), and women were more likely to respond than men
 (X2 = 5.64, 1 df, p < 0.05). Comparisons between full and partial responders were made in terms
 of information from the first questionnaire. Employees reporting longer working hours were less
 likely to respond to all three questionnaires (t = 2.27, 381 df, p < 0.05), but there were no
 significant differences in terms of other measured work characteristics, personality traits, or
 strain outcomes. Conclusions drawn from this research therefore may not be fully representative
 of the whole company. However in light of the higher response among participants who were not
 relocated and those reporting shorter working hours, evidence points toward an underestimation
 rather than an exaggeration of strain in this sample.

 Description of sample

 The targeted relocation sample was all full-time employees designated to work in a new branch,
 who at the time of the first survey were already working within the company. In the comparison
 branches, all full-time employees were invited to participate. This sampling strategy therefore
 included employees ranging from senior management to the lowest weekly-paid employees;
 including for example managers, supervisors, cashiers, butchers, bakery staff, shelf-stackers and
 cleaners. By targeting only full-time employees, the sample was slightly biased toward managerial
 employees relative to the company as a whole, as a significant proportion of weekly-paid
 employees are on part-time contracts. In the first survey, participants ranged in age from 16 to
 69 years (mean = 35.98; S.D. = 12.66); they had an average length of service of 7.74 years
 (S.D. = 6.09); and 56.9 per cent of the sample was female.

 Survey measures

 Job grade
 The job grade of each survey respondent was taken from company records, measured on a
 9-point ordinal ranking.

 Demand and control
 Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with seven items concerning pace and challenge
 of work demands, and eight items concerning decision latitude and discretion at work, all
 adapted from Karasek (1979). Each item was rated on a Likert response format from 1 (not at all)
 to 4 (very much indeed). Sample demand items are 'No time to finish tasks' and 'Have to work
 fast'; control items included 'Allows freedom' and 'Allows you to have a say'.

 Hours worked
 All respondents were asked to report the total number of hours worked in the week prior to each
 questionnaire.

 Social support
 Measures of support from colleagues (three items, e.g. 'To what extent are other people at
 work helpful in getting your job done?') and managers (six items; e.g. 'To what extent are senior
 staff concerned about the welfare of those under them?') were taken from House (1981). All items
 were presented in a Likert format from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much), consistent with House's
 original scales.

 Extraversion, neuroticism and social desirability
 Three 12-item scales of the widely used and extensively validated Eysenck Personality
 Questionnaire- Revised (Eysenck, Eysenck and Barrett, 1985) were used to measure differences
 in extraversion, neuroticism and social desirability. Extraverts on this scale are described as
 sociable and outgoing; people who score high on the neuroticism scale tend to be anxious and
 pessimistic; and high scorers on the social desirability scale are seen to present themselves in an
 unrealistically positive light.

 Locus of control
 Spector's (1988) Work Locus of Control Scale contains 16 items, each rated on a Likert scale
 ranging from 1 (disagree very much) to 6 (agree strongly). A high score on this scale indicates an
 external locus of control, that is a tendency to attribute work-related successes and failures to
 external causes such as chance or luck, rather than individual effort.

 Type A behaviour
 The nine items measuring Type A behaviour were taken from the Framingham Type A
 Behaviour Pattern scale (Haynes, Levine, Scotch, Feinleib and Kannel, 1978). People scoring
 high on this scale (Type As) describe themselves as competitive, bossy and impatient.

 THE EFFECTS OF TRANSITION STRESS 631

 Job satisfaction
 A 10-item job satisfaction scale asked respondents to rate aspects of their job on a 4-point
 scale from 'very dissatisfied' (1) to 'very satisfied' (4). Features rated included physical working
 conditions, working hours and shift arrangements, future work prospects, consultation about
 changes, co-workers and the way that abilities are used.

 Psychological distress
 The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, Goldberg, 1978) was used to measure
 general psychological symptom levels. This scale asks respondents to indicate the extent to which
 they have experienced a list of somatic and affective symptoms over the previous 6 weeks, relative
 to their usual level of health on a 4-point scale (scored 0-1-2-3). The scale has been shown to
 have good reliability and validity for working populations (Banks, Clegg, Jackson, Kemp,
 Stafford and Wall, 1980), and has been validated against clinical ratings of mental health
 (Banks, 1983).

 Physical symptoms
 The 7-item somatic symptom scale was taken from the 28-item General Health Questionnaire
 to gauge levels of minor physical complaints (Goldberg and Hillier, 1979). The response format
 is the same as described for the GHQ-12.

 Results

 Descriptive statistics

 The psychometric properties of all questionnaire scales are presented in Table 1, for the first
 survey. Internal consistencies for all scales were acceptably high at time 1 and remained high
 (>0.70) when repeated at times 2 and 3.2 Re-test reliabilities (Pearson r) from time 1 to time 3 are
 also displayed and give an indication of the stability of measures over time. The most stable
 measures, as might be expected, are personality scales, with work characteristics also showing
 high correlations over this time period. Work demands showed the least consistency over time,
 perhaps reflecting the anecdotal reports of increasing workload in new branches. Report of
 somatic symptoms, although significantly correlated, was also relatively unstable over the survey
 period.

 A correlation matrix of questionnaire measures is presented in Table 2, including the repeated

 measures of work characteristics and strain indices for time 2 and time 3. Broadly, the patterns of
 correlations within each survey and across times are quite consistent. For example, perceptions of
 control and social support (from managers as well as colleagues) were highly correlated in all
 three surveys, and over time, suggesting that people who feel they have a supportive work
 environment, also feel they have greater control over their work, a finding that has been reported
 elsewhere (Krause, 1987; Morrison, Cordery and Girardi, 1996). To account for correlations

 among different work characteristics, the assessment of any relationship between specific work
 characteristics and strain needs to be undertaken in a multivariate context.

 Table 2 also reveals that some individual differences (e.g. locus of control) are correlated with

 both work characteristics and strain outcomes, supporting the need to account for individual
 differences in assessing the influence of work characteristics on strain, as argued by Burke, Brief
 and George (1993). However, contrary to arguments about the potential confounding influence
 of neuroticism in this type of research (e.g. Brief et al., 1988; Watson and Clark, 1984),
 neuroticism was only correlated with health-related variables (psychological distress and physical
 symptoms), and not with work characteristics.

 Finally, higher job grade is correlated with lower social desirability response, suggesting
 that more senior managers are more honest in their questionnaire responses than shop-floor
 employees, perhaps relating to greater suspicion of questionnaire research by weekly-paid
 employees.

 Testing for differences between the relocation
 and comparison groups

 Comparing the two quasi-experimental groups before relocation (time 1) revealed that the
 relocation and comparison samples were very similar. Independent samples t-tests showed that
 there were no pre-existing differences on any of the strain indices, nor the personality measures.
 This finding eliminates the possibility that employees were selected for relocation on the basis of
 systematic differences in their health or well-being, or personality characteristics that might be
 expected to relate to individual strain.

 The main difference between the respondent groups was in terms of job grade: the relocation

 sample included a higher proportion of more senior personnel than the comparison sample

 (t = -2.28, df= 168, p < 0.05). The relocation sample also had a longer average tenure with the
 company (t= 2.98, df=198, p < 0.05) and higher levels of perceived control (t= -1.76,
 df= 168, p < 0.05), but as these factors are covariates of job grade (see Table 2), such differences
 are attributable to te observed grade differences. To control statistically for this additional
 difference between the quasi-experimental groups, job grade is included as a covariate in the
 analyses of variance described below. Without such statistical control, any differences observed
 between the relocation and comparison groups could be attributed to differences in job grade
 and/or consequent variation in tenure and perceived control, rather than to the relocation.

 The impact of relocation on individual well-being

 To examine the impact of relocation on strain, the sample with complete data for all three
 questionnaires (N = 85) was divided into employees moving to a 'new branch' (N = 27) and those
 working in a 'comparison branch' (N = 58). Repeated measures analysis of variance was
 conducted on each strain outcome (job satisfaction, psychological distress, physical symptoms),
 the results of which are summarized in Table 3.

 A significant branch type x time interaction for psychological distress was revealed in the
 analysis of variance. The interaction is illustrated in Figure 1 and is consistent with hypothesis 1,
 that relocation is associated with increased levels of strain. Before relocation employees in both
 types of branches reported similar psychological symptom levels. Within the comparison
 branches, personnel maintained this low level of symptoms, whereas personnel moving into a
 new branch experienced higher symptom levels coinciding with the move, which were still
 apparent 6 months after the move.

 In contrast, no significant interaction was evident for either job satisfaction or somatic
 symptom report. Although both measures changed during the survey period, this was not at a
 differential rate in new branches relative to the comparison stores, and can therefore not be
 attributed to the relocation. Job satisfaction showed a steady decline across the three surveys
 (mean satisfaction: TI = 26.98, 72 = 25.52, 73 = 24.89), while somatic symptoms rose during the
 survey, particularly between the first and second waves (mean physical symptoms: T1 = 4.89,
 72 = 6.68, 73 = 5.75). These main effects for time are consistent with wider patterns of change
 observed in the whole of the company during this time, and attributed to organizational
 restructuring. This trend is discussed more fully elsewhere (Moyle, 1995), and therefore the
 analysis of 'relocation stress', presented below, concentrates on psychological distress as the
 strain outcome sensitive to job relocation.

 Explaining variation in psychological distress

 Cross-sectional analysis of the stress
 process before relocation
 The relative contributions of individual differences and work characteristics to experienced
 psychological distress were examined through hierarchical multiple regression for respondents
 with complete data in the first survey (N= 161). A summary of the analysis is presented in
 Table 4. In this form of analysis, the variance in psychological distress accounted for by stable
 individual differences (demographic and personality factors) is statistically controlled before
 consideration of self-reported work characteristics. Thus the significant contribution of the work
 perceptions block cannot be attributed to a confounding of self-reports by dispositional response
 bias, as has been sometimes argued (e.g. Brief et al., 1988; Burke et al., 1993).

 The strong association of neuroticism with symptom report replicates a common finding in the
 literature (e.g. Watson and Clark, 1984; Costa and McCrae, 1987), however in the full simul-
 taneous regression model, including statistical control for neuroticism, there were still significant
 independent effects of other individual and work characteristics. Specifically, in the final model
 psychological distress was associated with gender (female), neuroticism (high), social desirability
 (low), locus of control (external), job grade (managerial) and work demands (high). The finding
 that branch type (new versus comparison) was not significantly associated with strain outcomes in
 this analysis indicates that there were no initial differences between pre-relocation and com-
 parison stores. Therefore differences in strain observed during relocation cannot be attributed to
 pre-existing differences between the two groups.

 Predicting psychological distress
 during relocation
 The cross-sectional analysis, presented above, showed that psychological distress was associated
 with a range of individual differences, but only one work characteristic, work demands. Further-
 more, past research has demonstrated that self-report of symptom levels tends to be stable over
 time, such that the best predictor of future symptom levels is a prior measure of symptom report
 (Grant, Patterson, Olshen and Yager, 1987). Thus, psychological distress at time 2 (the transition
 period), was expected to be predicted by initial (time 1) symptoms levels, perceived demands at
 time 2, and branch type (i.e. 'new' versus 'comparison'). By controlling for the stability of
 symptom report, individual differences were not expected to have any additional influence on
 psychological distress.

 Using multiple regression, this simple direct effects model for the prediction of psycho-

 logical distress during relocation accounted for 43.6 per cent of the variance: a path diagram
 illustrating this model is presented in Figure 2. Neither individual differences, nor additional
 work characteristics and perceptions, subsequently entered into the analysis as a single block,
 added significantly to the prediction of distress (AR2 = 0.10, n.s.). That is, although indi-
 vidual differences, particularly neuroticism, are associated with psychological distress cross-
 sectionally, the influence of stable traits on distress at time 2 is mediated by the measure of
 prior distress.

 Mediation of impact of change by work stressors

 If 'transition stress' is mediated through changes in key work characteristics (stressors), then this
 should be apparent in both repeated measures analysis of variance of work characteristics, and in
 hierarchical regression predicting distress at time 2. Repeated measures ANOVAs of work
 characteristics (hours worked, work demand, control, social support from colleagues and
 managers) did not reveal any statistically significant differences between branch types over the
 survey period. That is, despite the conventional wisdom that the relocation period is associated
 with increased work pressures, this was not reflected using the present measures. Furthermore,
 the regression analysis illustrated in Figure 2, indicated independent contributions of branch type
 and work demands. If the influence of relocation was mediated through work demands, only the
 demands factor would reach statistical significance in a simultaneous regression analysis (Baron
 and Kenny, 1986). There is no evidence for a mediation mechanism in the present analyses: the
 observed differences in psychological distress during relocation could not be accounted for by
 changes in measured work characteristics: hypothesis 2 is not supported.

 Moderation of impact of change by individual
 and situational characteristics

 Building on the direct effects model in Figure 2, two interactive mechanisms which might moder-
 ate psychological symptoms during relocation can be suggested: either the relationship between

 demand and distress, or that between branch type and distress, might be buffered by individual or
 situational characteristics. Multiplicative interaction terms for each potential moderator
 (perceived control, social support, locus of control, Type A behaviour, job grade) with 'branch
 type' and with perceived demands were created and tested in separate hierarchical multiple
 regression analyses (as recommended by Baron and Kenny, 1986).

 Three interaction terms contributed significantly to the prediction of psychological distress at

 time 2: the results of these analyses are summarized in Table 5. The association between high
 demands and distress was buffered by Type B personality. Similarly, the high symptom levels
 associated with relocation to a new store were buffered by both high levels of perceived control
 and high support from managers. Contrary to expectations however, neither locus of control nor
 job grade significantly moderated transition stress.

 To facilitate the interpretation of interaction effects, all independent variables were standard-

 ized before the analysis, and the unstandardized regression coefficients (Bs) were used to graph
 interactions at the average (zero) level of variables not included in the interaction (as recom-
 mended by Finney, Mitchell, Cronkite and Moos, 1984). Figure 3 illustrates the interaction of
 Type A and perceived demands for +? standard deviation on the Type A measure to represent
 Type A and Type B: it is only individuals with Type A characteristics who experience increased
 psychological distress with rising demands. Figure 4 graphs the association between psychological
 distress and managerial support in new and comparison branches. In comparison branches the
 level of managerial support has little impact on psychological distress, while in the new branches
 increasing support was associated with reduced distress. The form of the interaction between
 perceived control and branch type was very similar to that illustrated for managerial support, that
 is high control is associated with reduced symptoms only in the new branches.

 To draw together the three moderation effects presented in Table 5, a further regression

 analysis was conducted incorporating all effects for Type A, managerial support and perceived
 control. However, due to the strong correlation of perceived control and managerial support,
 including both control and support teams simultaneously, resulted in neither interaction term
 reaching statistical significance. It is concluded therefore that the shared variance between these

 Discussion

 Summary of findings

 The quasi-experimental design of this study allowed responses to relocation as a stressor to be
 separated from responses to other work characteristics. In particular, and consistent with
 expectations, employees transferred to new branches showed an increase in psychological distress
 at that time. Furthermore, the use of a standardized symptom inventory (the GHQ-12) allowed
 this effect to be quantified, so that any changes in future relocation practice can be evaluated.
 What was not anticipated was that higher distress levels were sustained over the following
 6 months: it had been expected that employees would have adapted to the new work situation
 within this time.

 THE EFFECTS OF TRANSITION STRESS 643

 Consistent with previous research (e.g. Brief et al., 1988; Costa and McCrae, 1987), cross-
 sectional analysis predicting psychological distress revealed that the majority of explained
 variance in self-reported distress can be attributed to stable individual differences, particularly
 neuroticism, but also gender, social desirability and locus of control. However, contrary to the
 more extreme view that dispositional response bias might underlie all correlations between self-
 reports of stressors and strains (e.g. McCrae, 1990), after statistical control for individual
 differences, work demands made a significant independent contribution to the explanation of
 psychological distress. Furthermore, in longitudinal analyses, the influence of neuroticism and
 other individual differences was shown to be mediated through a measure of prior psychological
 distress.

 Longitudinal path analysis revealed that, after controlling for initial levels of psychological
 symptoms, psychological distress at time 2 was predicted independently by perceived demands
 and by the move to a new store. Contrary to expectations (Fisher, 1989; Karasek, 1990), the
 impact of workplace change was not mediated by demand, control or social support. That is,
 analyses were unable to account for the difference in symptoms between the new and comparison
 stores in terms of differences in work characteristics.

 However, consistent with the literature on Type A behaviour, Type B characteristics were
 found to be adaptive in high work demands, buffering the relationship between perceived
 demands and distress (e.g. Rhodewalt, Sansone, Hill, Chemers and Wysocki, 1991). Further-
 more, the negative effects of relocation were buffered by social support and control at work. Thus,
 consistent with the literature on transition stress, the negative impact of work relocation was
 reduced under conditions of high support and control during the change period (e.g. Gerpott,
 1990; Karasek, 1990). Although past research also suggests that an internal locus of control will
 buffer the negative impact of work transitions (e.g. Ashford, 1988; Callan et al., 1994), neither
 locus of control, nor other individual differences were found to have any influence (either direct
 or moderating) on psychological distress during the transition, after control for prior levels of
 distress.

 Like the study reported by Nelson et al. (1995), in the present analysis negative effects of
 relocation were not moderated by job grade. As there are several differences between these studies
 and those in which job grade does act as a buffer (Ferguson and Cheyne, 1995; Olsen and Tetrick,
 1988), reasons for such a discrepancy can only be speculative: the answer may lie either in
 differences in the types of work being undertaken or in the nature of the organizational change.
 The finding in the cross-sectional hierarchical regression that higher symptom levels were
 experienced by managers than by non-managers is also inconsistent with past research
 (e.g. Marmot, Rose, Shipley and Hamilton, 1978), and suggests that there are unique work
 pressures experienced by management in supermarkets, not documented in other occupational
 contexts.

 Directions for future research

 Although allowing a more rigorous analysis of transition stress than much of the previous
 literature in this area, the present study suffers from several limitations. In particular, the
 relatively low response rate combined with some indication of selection bias operating among
 volunteers. Thus the extent to which conclusions in the analyses presented can be generalized is
 limited: the sample is not necessarily representative of a wider population of supermarket
 employees. Any future research should attempt to increase response rates, for example by
 personal distribution of questionnaires (rather than by mail) or group administration of

 questionnaires in work time to ensure that even the most pressured employees are able to find
 time to contribute to the survey.

 The inability of the present research to support the mediation hypothesis may be due to the fact

 that the measures utilized were not sufficiently sensitive, given the modest nature of the change
 examined. Alternatively, the measures used may not have focused on the most important aspects
 of work during this type of change. Other studies have also had difficulty in demonstrating
 systematic changes in job characteristics with wider organizational changes. In particular Olson
 and Tetrick (1988) found that restructuring was not associated with changes in role clarity, role
 overload, or social support, after controlling for tenure and organizational level. Likewise, Callan
 et al. (1994) failed to find an association between the perceived extent of change and the extent of
 appraised stress. In contrast, Lindorff (1995) reported that it was the uncertainty during
 organizational change that was associated with strain. Future research might focus on measures
 of uncertainty, such as job security, role conflict and role ambiguity as potential mediators of
 transition stress.

 Although using a quasi-experimental research design to examine the impact of relocation, the

 present research still relied on correlational evidence to test buffering hypotheses. An intervention
 whereby social support and/or worker control is manipulated during the change period would
 more rigorously test these factors as potential moderators of transition stress. Similarly, placing
 Type A and B employees into situations of systematically differing work demands would provide
 a stronger test of personality as a buffer of high workload.

 Finally, the time course of workplace transitions has not received sufficient attention

 in the research literature. One exception is a study of job redesign in a group of bank tellers
 by Griffin (1991); distinctly different results for job satisfaction and job performance were
 found 6, 24, and 48 months after the intervention. In the present study, experienced personnel
 professionals suggested that 6 months was a sufficient period for employees to adapt to the new
 work situation. However, survey results revealed that significant differences in psychological
 symptoms between 'new' and 'comparison' branch personnel were still evident after 6 months of
 operation in a new branch. Future research on relocation should examine adaptation over a
 longer period.
