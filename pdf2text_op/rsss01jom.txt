Abstract

The degree to which organizational climate mediates the relationship between human resource
practices and customer satisfaction is investigated for 351 small businesses in the same industry.
Results indicated support for the hypothesized mediated relationship. The indirect effects of HR
practices on customer satisfaction were signiﬁcant and relatively large while the direct effect was
nonsigniﬁcant and near zero. The results were supportive of a social context model of the impact of
human resource practices on organizational outcomes. Limitations of the study and implications for
future research are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

Over the past decade, several researchers have examined the HR practices of organizations
and related those practices to measures of organizational effectiveness (e.g., Gerhart &
Milkovich, 1992; Huselid, 1995; Terpstra & Rozell, 1993). In addition, this research has
spawned an interest in the use of HR practices as a means of effecting organizational strategy
{e.g., see special issues of the Academy of Management Journal [1996(3)] and Human
Resource Management Review [1998(3)]}.

It is the purpose of this study to extend this organizational level research in two ways.
First, we use a sample of relatively small organizations all engaged in the same business
using the same indices of ﬁrm performance. Previous studies have included a variety of

organizations in many different industries in a variety of situations sometimes making
comparability on performance criteria difﬁcult. (see Becker & Gerhart, 1996). Second, we
explore the degree to which the HR practices-organizational performance relationship is
mediated by organizational climate.

2. Organizational studies of HR practices-organizational performance
relationships

In one of the ﬁrst organizational studies of HR impact, Huselid (1995) conducted a study
of 968 ﬁrms in which 13 HR practices that have been considered high performance work
practices were associated with turnover, employee productivity and company ﬁnancial
performance. Based on principal component analysis, these 13 factors were grouped into
those that contributed to employee skills and organizational structures that facilitated the use
of those skills and factors that contributed to employee motivation. These two factors were
related to gross rate of return on assets, market value of the ﬁrm, productivity, and turnover,
though the average of the absolute value of these correlations was only 0.08. Many factors
inﬂuence organizational performance, so relatively low correlations should probably be
expected, but even these small correlations often translate into large changes in economic
effectiveness. Previous to Huselid’s (1995) study, Terpstra and Rozell (1993) had shown that
ﬁve HR practices related to selection of employees were related to ﬁrm proﬁt and Russell,
Terborg, and Powers (1985) had demonstrated a link between the adoption of employee
training programs and ﬁnancial performance. Compensation systems have also been studied
as a means of maximizing the impact of an organization’s human resources to accomplish
organizational objectives (Gerhart & Milkovich, 1992).

In a study of 590 proﬁt and nonproﬁt organizations, Delaney and Huselid (1996) studied
the impact of selection, training, compensation, grievance procedures, decision making and
internal promotional practices and the interaction of these practices on two perceptual
measures of organizational performance. Perceptions of market performance were related to
all of the HR practices except for the measure of decentralized decision making, but
perceptions of organizational performance (a seven item measure of perceived quality of
products and services, customer satisfaction, and the ability to attract and retain quality
employees) were related only to incentive compensation. All correlations were 0.20 or less,
though again, in the context of overall organizational functioning, relatively small relation-
ships are likely. The fact that statistically signiﬁcant relationships are observed and replicated
underscores the importance of the HR function in organizations. Delaney and Huselid (1996)
also investigated hypotheses about the nonlinearity of HR practices-organizational perfor-
mance relationships and the interaction of HR practices and found little support for these
more complex relationships.

Huselid, Jackson, and Schuler (1997) extended the research on the effectiveness of HR
practices by differentiating between the impact of strategic and technical HR practices in a
study of 293 ﬁrms. They related these two forms of HR activity to three indices of
organizational performance collected twice, a year apart. Of these 12 correlations, the
relationship of technical HR practices was related to gross rate of return in one year and

433

strategic HR practices were related to gross rate of return in one year and market value of the
ﬁrm in one of the two years studied. The average of the 12 correlations was 0.06.

Becker and Gerhart (1996) provided a discussion of the research on the impact of HR
practices and the problems faced by researchers who are doing empirical work in this area.
Two of their comments are especially relevant for the research reported in this paper. First,
they point to the value of studies that involve a single industry group or company. Because
such studies usually involve comparisons of organizations that employ similar and compa-
rable outcome measures, they may provide a clearer, if more narrow, picture of the ways in
which HR practices create value for the organization. In this study, we report results of a
study of independent dealership organizations that are all engaged in selling the product of
a major corporation. The same measures of ﬁrm performance (i.e., customer satisfaction) are
available for all these organizations.

As a group, previous studies do indicate that HR practices are related to organizational
measures of productivity and health. However, the relationships tend to be relatively small
in correlational terms even though the actual dollar outcomes may be quite large (e.g., see
Huselid, 1995). A second question raised by Becker and Gerhart (1996) relates to the nature
of the HR-organizational performance relationship and the mechanisms by which HR
practices exert their impact on organizational performance measures.

As mentioned above, the literature on human resource strategy, of which the studies cited
above are representative has burgeoned in the last two decades. This rapid growth has
stimulated a number of recent reviews and essays on strategic human resource management.
Of most relevance to the research described in this study is the paper by Ferris et al. (1998).
Ferris et al. (1998) begin by noting the lack of any theoretical explanation as to how HR
systems effect organizational effectiveness. To address these limitations, they propose a
social context model that asserts that climate, culture, and political considerations serve to
mediate the linkages between HR systems and organizational effectiveness. Speciﬁcally,
their theoretical model asserts cultural values inﬂuence the types of HR systems that are
developed or adopted by an organization and that these systems, in turn, determine the
organization’s climate. Climate, in turn, effects employee attitudes and behavior, and ulti-
mately, organizational effectiveness. The data presented in this paper are organizational level
data, hence our model does not include individual employee attitudes and behavior. Ferris et
al. (1998) conceives of climate as a set of shared (among employees) attitudes, values, and
beliefs about how an organization operates. Relative to organizational culture, these shared
perceptions are temporary and changeable. While some (see Schneider, 1975) argue that
climate relates only to a speciﬁc referent such as safety (Zohar, 1980), service (Parkington
& Schneider, 1979; Schneider & Bowen, 1985), or sexual harassment (Fitzgerald, Drasgow,
Hulin, Gelfand & Magley, 1997), Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo (1990) considered the
following as key dimensions of climate: Goal emphasis; means emphasis, reward orientation,
task support, and socioemotional support.

Bowen and Schneider (1988) have developed a similar approach in explaining the role of
a climate for service. Following early organizational theorists (e.g., Perrow, 1970; Thomp-
son, 1967; Woodward, 1958), they assert that the unique characteristics of service technol-
ogies require different organizational arrangements (e.g., HR systems) from those that would
be appropriate for other types of organizations such as those involved with manufacturing


434

goods. These organizational arrangements, in turn, inﬂuence the climate in these organiza-
tions. Of course, a great deal of the service climate research has been directed toward
documentation of the relationship between service climate as perceived by employees and
the quality of service customers receive (see below). This research is particularly relevant to
our paper since the organizations studied were service organizations and our effectiveness
measures were all indices of customer satisfaction. Bowen and Schneider (1988) go on to
argue that everything the organization can do to enhance a service climate—from selection
and training to reward systems and leadership style—must be invoked to guide employee
behavior and ensure quality. The more elements of the situation that connote a need for
service excellence, the stronger will be the service climate and the more likely will customers
be to experience that service climate and quality. The important point for this paper is that
the theoretical hypothesis underlying both Schneider and his colleagues’ work and the
theoretical framework provided by Ferris et al. (1998) is that the relationship between HR
practices and organizational effectiveness is mediated by organizational climate. Insofar as
we aware, this mediation hypothesis has not been previously tested.

One goal of this study is to assess the degree to which organizational climate serves to

mediate this relationship. Formally, it is our hypothesis that:

The relationship between HR practices and service outcomes will be mediated by climate.
That is, the indirect effect of HR practices on customer service as mediated by organizational
climate will be statistically signiﬁcant.

Corollary to this hypothesis, we also hypothesize that:

1. HR practices will have a signiﬁcant impact on organizational climate; and
2. Organizational climate will be signiﬁcantly related to customer service indices

To provide a basis for this position, we review the literature on the impact of HR on climate
in an organization and the effect of climate on customer service perceptions.

2.1. HR practices-organizational climate relationship

To our knowledge, there have been relatively few studies of the degree to which HR
practices directly impact the climate or culture in an organization. However, we believe that
this notion is consistent with the attraction-selection-attrition hypothesis proposed by Schnei-
der (1987) and recently reviewed by Schneider, Goldstein, and Smith (1995). This theory
proposes that attraction, selection, and attrition result in organizations containing people with
distinct personalities that are responsible for “the unique structures, processes, and cultures
that characterize organizations” (Schneider et al., 1995, p. 751). Moreover, these authors also
point to the importance of organizational leaders whose goals result in the “enactment of
speciﬁc policies and practices to achieve these goals, and the combination of goals and
resulting policies and practices yields an organization characterized by unique structures,
processes, and culture” (p. 753). Schneider et al. (1995) then proceed to review a small body
of anecdotal and case study data that support the role of organizational leadership in
establishing organizational practices and the resultant organizational climate. Of primary
importance to the present research is the notion that various practices reﬂective of top
organizational leaders’ goals and personality produce an organizational climate.


K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

435

Some empirical research provides support for the contention that HR practices are related
to organizational climate. Bennett, Lehman, and Forst (1999) report a study in which they
hypothesized that total quality training would be effective in changing employees’ customer
orientation only if the organization’s transfer climate deﬁned as supervisor and co-worker
support were positive. While this hypothesis indicates that climate would moderate the
relationship between the HR practice, total quality training, and customer orientation, the
analyses Bennett et al. (1999) reported were more consistent with a mediator hypothesis. A
paper by Luthans and Sommer (1999) indicated that downsizing had a negative impact on a
range of employee perceptions of the organization. Tesluk, Farr, Mathieu, and Vance (1995)
reported that employees in organizations who engaged in greater amounts of employee
involvement training reported more commitment to the organization and less cynicism about
the possibility of organizational change. However, greater use of employee involvement
training seemed to occur in organizations with less participative climates.

Given few authors have addressed the HR practices-organizational climate relationship, it
is not clear which HR practices should lead to an improved climate. In the case of this study,
the organizations were auto dealerships that were independent franchises of a major auto-
manufacturing ﬁrm. The HR practices were those that the parent ﬁrm hoped would increase
the professionalization and effectiveness of the individual dealerships as they related to their
employees. Several of the HR practices described below and presented in Appendix A may
foster a positive organizational climate related to important organizational objectives (in this
case, customer service). For example, training, performance reviews, and job descriptions
can all be used to communicate the importance of customer service. Communication of
organizational policies in written form and requiring employees read such documents can
also underscore important organizational objectives. Similar points have been made by
Schneider and colleagues regarding what they call general facilitative conditions (Schneider
& Bowen, 1985; 1995; Schneider, White & Paul, 1998). It is less clear how some of the items
identiﬁed as hiring practices would foster a positive climate for service. It should also be
noted that the HR practices instrument used in this study asked about the existence of these
practices, not the content of the training or orientation programs or the nature of the
performance review. However, all materials provided by the parent ﬁrm for dealership use
emphasized the important role of customer service in the growth and success of dealerships
and the parent ﬁrm.

2.2. Climate-organizational performance relationships

There are several studies that document the importance of organizational climate as a
determinant of organizational outcomes. As indicated above, various features of the work
environment have been considered by previous researchers (Schneider, 1990) including the
climate for work group cooperation, job challenge and autonomy, leader support, pay-
performance linkages and performance feedback (Jones & James, 1979; Kopelman et al.,
1990; Schneider, 1990).

In most studies, employee evaluations of organizational climate have been related to the
perceptions of customers who purchased the organization’s services or products. Schmit and
Allschied (1995) found the climate for support among employees of 361 ofﬁces of a large


436

K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

security company were related to a measure of job satisfaction (all but one correlation were
in the 0.20s and 0.30s). With data obtained from 57 locations of a large bank, Johnson (1996)
demonstrated that overall service climate was correlated (rs 5 0.25 to 0.40) with nine
different measures of customer satisfaction. Schneider et al. (1998) reports a signiﬁcant
relationship between a climate for service among bank employees and customer perceptions
of service at 134 branches of the bank.

Beyond customer service, Ostroff (1992) reported correlations between teacher attitudes
(commitment, satisfaction, adjustment, and stress) and student outcomes including grades
and attendance behavior in 298 different schools. While several of the teacher perceptions
might not always be considered aspects of climate, commitment often is a component of
measures of climate, and all four variables were aggregated across teachers within a school
with empirical justiﬁcation indicating that these variables were shared perceptions of the
schools’ employees. Similarly, Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996) examined data for 142
branches of a large automobile ﬁnance company and found that aggregated employee
attitudes such as satisfaction, teamwork, quality emphases, and customer focus were related
to customer satisfaction, employee turnover and measures of branch ﬁnancial performance.
Consistent with the research cited above that indicates the need to consider speciﬁc
aspects of climate, we included items that measured what we refer to below as a climate for
Customer Orientation. The speciﬁc items included in this measure are presented along with
the other climate items in Appendix B. They assess the degree to which employees value
customers and are concerned about their needs and desires. Three more general aspects of
organizational climate were also included in the measure and should relate to employee
behavior that would be positively perceived by customers. Employee commitment referred
to the degree to which employees would support organizational goals and welfare. Cooper-
ation and Coordination items dealt with the degree to which various units within the
organization cooperated with and trusted each other. Finally, Managerial Competence and
Consistency referred to the degree to which managers were consistent in their treatment of
employees and the articulation of organizational goals and policies. The latter three more
general climate dimensions have been reported in other studies of organizational climate
(Kopelman et al., 1990) and similar climate constructs were found to be important indicators
of a general service climate in the Schneider et al. (1998) study.

3. Summary and hypotheses

In our brief review of the literature on the impact of HR practices on organizational
performance, we have asserted that (1) there is a small (in correlation terms, but not
necessarily in economic terms) but statistically signiﬁcant and replicable effect of HR
practices on corporate outcomes; (2) that HR practices affect the climate of an organization;
and (3) that the climate of an organization has an impact on organizational outcomes, in this
case, on customer service indices. It is our purpose to evaluate these hypotheses and to
investigate the hypothesis that (4) the relationship between HR practices and organizational
outcomes is mediated by the climate of the organization. In addition, we evaluate an
alternative to the mediated model that tests whether HR practices exert both mediated effects


K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

437

and direct effects on organizational outcomes. Theoretical rationale is offered for the mediation
hypotheses, but our measures reﬂect organizational context and interests. As such, our study is
exploratory and tests of the measurement model in what follows are consistent with this fact.

4. Method

4.1. Sample

The sample included 385 franchise dealerships engaged in selling and servicing the
products of a single large automotive manufacturer. Surveys were sent to a stratiﬁed random
sample of 1285 dealers throughout the United States. The returns represented a 30% return
rate. The survey was sent to owners of these small businesses; the actual respondents were
180 manager-owners, 27 HR managers, and 178 other managers including service and parts
managers. These small businesses exercised autonomy relative to the parent organization in
employing various HR practices. The data reported in this paper were the result of part of an
intervention on the part of the parent organization to improve the HR systems in its
dealerships. Respondent organizations were almost exactly similar to the population of
dealer-owners in terms of products sold, parts sold for repair purposes, and customer
handling indices. Respondents reported a slightly larger number of repair orders. The total
number of employees in these organizations averaged 42 and ranged from 5 to 263. Because
of missing data on some variables, the sample size on which the results of the structural
equation modeling described below was conducted was 351. Correlations in Table 1 are
based on those cases for which values on all variables were available.

4.2. Measures

4.2.1. HR practices

The HR practices measure consisted of 28 items; 16 of these items required that the
respondent simply answer “Yes” or “No” indicating the practice was being followed by the
organization. These items included questions about a concern for employee attitudes (e.g.,
“has employed an employee satisfaction survey”), items regarding employee policies (e.g.,
“has a workplace drug use policy posted”), items regarding the orientation of new employees
(e.g., “provides a structured mentoring program”) and items concerned with structured hiring
practices (e.g., “gives employment tests to assess an applicant’s basic abilities, technical
skills, or people skills”). Three items required the use of a six-point scale indicating the
percentage of employees affected by a particular employment practice. The six-point re-
sponse scale ranged from 0% to 100%. The items included the percentage of “employees for
whom formal written job descriptions were available,” the percentage of “employees who
had received formal performance reviews in the last 12 months,” and the percentage of
“employees who review their formal written job descriptions in their ﬁrst week on the job.”
Responses to nine items were made on ﬁve-point response scales ranging from “Strongly
Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” These items included questions about the degree to which
pay was linked to performance, the extent to which formal mechanisms were used to

recognize employee performance, and the nature of company training programs (e.g.,
“training programs are developed and monitored for all employees”). All 28 items in the HR
practices measure involved the reporting of the presence or absence of some relatively
concrete practice or procedure (e.g., use of tests to select employees). The total set of 28
items used in this study is presented in Appendix A.

A series of exploratory principal components analyses with varimax rotation including
analyses of the product moment correlation matrix and a correlation matrix consisting of
polychoric correlations as well as the content of the HR practices suggested that the 28 items
represented six sets of HR practices. Factor loadings for the solution used to form the HR
practices measures are included in Appendix A. Analyses of polychoric correlations were
employed because of a concern that items were measured using different response formats.
Correlations between dichotomous items and between dichotomous items and items with
different response formats (i.e., ﬁve- or six-point scales) are converted to tetrachoric and
biserial correlations before the principal component analyses thus removing the impact of
different scale formats. In combining items to form the six measures that follow, we did not
combine items of differing scale formats (see Appendix A for the items that comprised each
scale and the response scale format used). “Hiring” included seven items regarding the use
of selection tests, formal orientations for new employees, employee recruitment, and concern
for afﬁrmative action as well as analyses of the motivation of employees who leave the
organization. Job descriptions consisted of two items indicating the presence and availability
of formal job descriptions. “Policy” included four items that requested the respondent to
indicate the availability and use of employee handbooks and the presence of clearly artic-
ulated HR policies. “Testing” referred to the organizations’ efforts to collect data on its


K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

439

employees including survey measures and indices of the capability to perform their jobs.
Performance review (Perf Rev) included ﬁve items that addressed the degree to which there
were formal performance reviews and the manner in which performance was linked to
compensation. Five items reﬂected the degree to which training programs were developed,
available to employees, and evaluated. Probably partly because of the small number of items
used in each of the subscales and the response formats, coefﬁcient alpha estimates of internal
consistency reliability for two of these components were relatively low (see Table 1). The
intercorrelations among the components were relatively uniform indicating a general factor.
In addition, a principal component analysis of the intercorrelations between these six
measures indicated that a single factor accounted for 41% of the variance and the eigenvalue
for only the ﬁrst factor exceeded 1.00. Finally, the degree to which these six components
represented a latent HR factor was tested using LISREL 8.30. The single factor model ﬁt the
data well (x2 5 11.55, df. 5 9, p . .24; RMSEA 5 0.03; NNFI 5 0.96; CFI 5 0.99).
Consequently, these six components were treated as indicators of a general HR practices
construct in the structural equations analyses described below.

4.2.2. Climate variables

Responses to four aspects of organizational climate were made on ﬁve-point scales with
response options ranging from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.” Principal compo-
nent analysis with varimax rotation of the climate items revealed the existence of four
factors. The climate items and the factor loadings associated with this solution are presented
in Appendix B. The last two items in Appendix B had high cross loadings on other factors.
Because of this and a lack of content ﬁt, the last item was removed from the set of Customer
Orientation items. The item regarding employees’ anticipation of customer needs was
retained because its content ﬁt the scale and to retain high reliability for this group of items.
The four climate scales included six items assessing Employee Commitment (e.g., employ-
ees make personal sacriﬁces, when required, to help the dealership succeed), ﬁve Cooper-
ation and Coordination items (e.g., departments cooperate to get the job done efﬁciently and
effectively), four Customer Orientation items (e.g., employees are committed to developing
and maintaining long-term relationships with customers), and eight Management Compe-
tence and Consistency items (e.g., managers clearly communicate work objectives and
responsibilities). Coefﬁcient alpha for these four measures ranged from 0.80 to 0.90.
Intercorrelations of the four scales ranged from 0.48 to 0.68 with a median of 0.59. While
all of these climate items and dimensions were developed to reﬂect the speciﬁc organiza-
tional context in which they were used, three of these climate dimensions (i.e., Employee
Commitment, Cooperation and Coordination, and Management Competence and Consis-
tency) are similar to climate dimensions consistently found in previous studies (Kopelman et
al., 1990; James & James, 1989; Jones & James, 1979; Schneider, 1990) as indicated above.
The fourth, Customer Orientation, has been considered an important climate factor in studies
of service organizations (Schneider, 1990). A principal components analysis of the four
climate scales yielded a single factor that accounted for 69% of the variance and only one
factor had an eigenvalue over 1.00. A hierarchical factor model specifying a single factor
accounting for variance among the four climate dimensions as deﬁned by these climate items
was evaluated using LISREL 8.30. Fit was moderate (x2 5 694.58, df. 5 185, p , .01;


440

K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

RMSEA 5 0.09; CFI 5 0.88, NNFI 5 0.86). Alternative models which removed items with
high cross loadings on the factors in Appendix B did improve ﬁt modestly, but because of
content considerations we retained all but the last item in Appendix B. All four climate
dimensions were signiﬁcantly (p , .01) related to the single higher order factor and the
standardized loadings ranged from 0.70 to 0.85. Hence, the four climate measures were
considered indicators of a general climate factor.

Because of a concern for the fact that the climate measures and the HR practices measures
were both collected from the same respondents, we performed an additional principal
components analysis on which all the climate and HR practices items were included. None
of the items in Appendixes A and B loaded on the wrong set of indices; that is, no HR
practices item loaded more highly on a climate factor than on an HR practices factor and no
climate item loaded more highly on a HR practices factor than on a climate factor. Part of
one additional set of items intended to assess HR practices related to employee recognition
loaded on the climate factor. Hence, that measure was eliminated from subsequent analyses.

4.2.3. Outcome variables

The organizations involved were service organizations and ﬁve service-related measures
were made available by the parent organization for this research project. A customer
handling index included nine items measured on a 10-point scale that included questions
about satisfaction with various aspects of a service encounter. Another measure consisted of
the percentage of time there was a need for repeated services to the same product indicating
a lack of service quality. This item was reverse scored in analyses involving other items and
variables in the study. Single-item measures of overall service quality, product loyalty (an
intention to buy the same brand of product in the future), and dealer loyalty (an intention to
do business in the future with the ﬁrm) made on 10-point scales were also made available.
All service variables are collected from customers on a routine basis and reported to the
parent organization. No data were available on return rates or the characteristics of respon-
dents and nonrespondents. Because only composite outcome measures were available for
these indices, internal consistency estimates of reliability were not available. As for the
climate and HR practices variables, a principal component analysis of the customer service
outcomes indicated evidence for a strong general factor; 83% of the variance was accounted
by the ﬁrst factor. A unidimensional LISREL model of the service outcome measures yielded
reasonable ﬁt. Because of the relatively few degrees of freedom (ﬁve) the x2 and RMSEA
indicated lack of good ﬁt, but the NNFI (0.97), the CFI (0.97), and the standardized root
mean square residual (0.02) indicated that the unidimensional model was a good ﬁt.

4.3. Data analyses

Correlations among the HR practices composite, the climate variables, and the customer
satisfaction indices were computed and, along with the standard deviations of these variables,
were used as input to a series of structural equation model analyses of the mediation model
described above. The DOS version of LISREL 8 (Jo¨reskog & So¨rbom, 1993) was used to
analyze these models. All structural equation analyses were conducted using the covariances
between the measured variables. Because of the intercorrelations between the climate

variables, individual climate measures were considered indicators of a general climate
construct in all these models. Similarly because of the high intercorrelations among the ﬁve
customer satisfaction variables and the relatively moderate and uniform correlations among
the HR practice variables, both of these sets of measures (i.e., customer satisfaction and HR
practices) were considered indicators of a single construct. The covariances used in these
analyses were those obtained when the effect of organizational size was partialled out.
Comparisons between the partial correlations and zero order correlations indicated a differ-
ence of no more than 0.03 in any relationship. The initial hypothesized model (see Fig. 1)
was one in which HR practices were considered determinants of organizational climate and
climate, in turn, was considered a determinant of the various outcome measures.

As in tests of the measurement model described above, three widely used model ﬁt indices
were used to assess model ﬁt: The non-normed ﬁt index (NNFI; Bentler & Bonett, 1980), the
comparative ﬁt index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), and the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA; Steiger, 1990). The ﬁrst two indices have a theoretical upper value of 1.00 and
values above 0.90 are considered evidence of a good ﬁtting model. For RMSEA, evidence
of good ﬁt is considered to be values less than 0.05; values from 0.05 to 0.10 are indicative
of moderate ﬁt and values greater than 0.10 are taken to be evidence of a poorly ﬁtting model
(Browne & Cudeck, 1993).

5. Results

In Table 1, we present the means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations of the HR

practices components, the ﬁve climate indicators and the various service indices.

There are several important observations regarding the data in Table 1. First, correlations
between the HR practices variables and the climate variables were moderate in magnitude
(average r 5 0.23) and most were statistically signiﬁcant indicating support for the HR
practices and climate linkage. Second, relationships between the HR practice variables and
the customer service variables were relatively low (i.e., less than 0.12). Overall, the latter
relationships are comparable to those in the studies reviewed in the introduction (e.g.,
Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; & Huselid et al., 1997). Third, the relationship
between the climate variables and the customer service variables are nearly all statistically
signiﬁcant, and particularly those involving the Customer Orientation and Employee Com-
mitment dimensions, are relatively high (i.e., 0.10 to 0.30). These correlations support earlier
research on the relationship between climate and customer satisfaction (Ryan et al., 1996;
Schmit & Allschied, 1995; Schneider, 1990) and this hypothesized linkage.

5.1. Structural equations analyses

Analysis of the hypothesis that organizational climate mediated the relationship between
HR practices and customer satisfaction was investigated using the DOS version of LISREL
8 (Jo¨reskog & So¨rbom, 1993). The speciﬁc model that was evaluated is depicted in Fig. 1.
In addition to the parameters implied by the model in Fig. 1, values of error associated
with each indicator were estimated. The initial analysis of this model indicated a moderate
level of ﬁt (x2 5 301.37, df. 5 88, p , .01, NNFI 5 0.92; CFI 5 0.94; and RMSEA 5
0.086). Examination of residuals and modiﬁcation indices indicated that a better ﬁtting model
might be achieved by estimating the error covariances between the performance review
measure and measures of organizational climate. Relationships between these residuals were
likely because of the fact that all were measured with the same response scale (Strongly
Agree to Strongly Disagree) hence these error covariances represent a methods effect.
Allowing these four parameters to be freely estimated resulted in a substantially better ﬁtting
model (x2 5 221.60, df. 5 84, p , .01; CFI 5 0.96, NNFI 5 0.95, and RMSEA 5 0.070).
The change in x2 between these two models was also statistically signiﬁcant (x2 5 79.77, df.
5 4, p , .01). The standardized parameter estimates associated with the revised model are
those presented in Fig. 1.

Of key substantive interest is the fact that the HR practices to Climate and the Climate to
Customer Satisfaction parameters were statistically signiﬁcant (p , .01). The indirect effect
of HR practices on customer satisfaction was statistically signiﬁcant and sizable (i.e., 0.11 in
standardized terms). Moreover a model in which the direct effect of HR practices on
customer satisfaction was estimated did not yield a signiﬁcant difference in x2 (x2 Change 5
0.28, df. 5 1, p . .05). These results indicate support for the notion that the impact of HR
practices on customer satisfaction is produced through their inﬂuence on organizational
climate.

An anonymous reviewer suggested that a more rigorous method of testing the mediator
hypothesis was the use of multiple regression (Baron & Kenny, 1986). Since the LISREL
analyses involved the use of latent variables, we could not do the same analysis using
regression. We did, however, conﬁrm that the HR practices latent variable, alone, was related
signiﬁcantly (p , .05) to the latent Service variable. The tests of the indirect and direct


K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

443

effects reported above constitute an analysis parallel to the second step of the usual mediated
regression analysis. An analogous set of mediated regressions using composites of the
climate, human resource practice, and service outcome variables was also conducted. These
analyses also provided support for the notion that climate mediated the relationship between
human resource practices and the service outcomes.

6. Discussion

This study provides evidence for the hypothesis that human resource practices inﬂuence
organizational climate which in turn inﬂuences customer satisfaction indices. The current
study provides some understanding of the manner in which human resource practices
inﬂuence organizational outcomes. Our results obviously apply to only one set of organiza-
tional outcomes, though, a very important set for these organizations. The indirect effect of
HR practices on customer satisfaction was statistically signiﬁcant and quite large (standard-
ized value 5 0.11). This is the ﬁrst empirical evidence of a link between human resource
practices and organizational climate even though such a linkage is consistent with the
attraction-selection-attrition hypothesis proposed by Schneider (1987) and the social context
model presented by Ferris et al. (1998). Correlations between indicators of HR practices and
indicators of climate were moderate (generally in the 0.20s) and the relationship at the
construct level (see Figs. 1) between HR practices and climate was relatively large. The
ﬁnding that climate was related to customer satisfaction was consistent with the few other
studies (e.g., Johnson, 1996; Ostroff, 1992; Ryan et al., 1996; Schmit & Allschied, 1995) that
examined this relationship. It is important to note that the relationship observed in this study
cannot be explained on the basis of common source bias. Climate measures were collected
from the managers of the small businesses that were the object of study while customer
indices were collected from customers and reported by a parent organization. There remains
the possibility of reverse causation; that is, organizational respondents knew the customer
service responses and inferred that climate was either good or bad.

In several ways, this study was exploratory. We used an existing set of human resource
practices and the latent construct underlying this set of practices to assess the impact on
climate and ultimately on service. The latter two variables were also latent constructs. It
should be useful to consider in more detail which of several HR practices lead to speciﬁc
climate dimensions and/or service outcomes. Speciﬁc detail on indicator relationships is
contained in Table 1. Examination of these correlations indicates that Testing practices were
correlated very low with the climate and service indicators. This may have occurred because
of the low reliability of this measure or because of a lack of good conceptual linkages
between such practices and the climate and service outcomes. Rerunning the LISREL
analyses without the Testing variable, and then without both Testing and Hiring variables
(the Hiring variable was also measured with low reliability), yielded virtually no change in
the overall model ﬁt indices. The correlations in Table 1 also indicate an especially strong
relationship between performance reviews and the managerial consistency climate variable.
These empirical relationships and conceptual arguments may be used in subsequent research
to provide an a priori model. We also used factor analyses to deﬁne our indicators as opposed


444

K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

to theoretical arguments. A systematic attempt to group and measure HR practice items on
conceptual grounds should yield a clearer understanding of which organizational practices
drive organizational climate and outcome variables.

In conclusion, we have presented data that support the hypothesis that HR practices are
signiﬁcantly related to one set of organizational outcomes, particularly customer satisfaction
variables (see Table 1), but like previous research most of the correlations are less than 0.20.
HR practices were also related to organizational climate; correlations and the structural
parameter relating climate to customer satisfaction were statistically signiﬁcant and moderate
in magnitude. (see Table 1 and Figs. 1). As indicated above, the HR practices-organizational
outcome relationship was mediated by climate. A direct effects model in which HR practices
affect outcomes directly as well as indirectly indicated no support for the direct link between
HR practices and customer satisfaction.

6.1. Limitations and future work

Among future studies of the impact of HR practices should be efforts to examine the
long-term impact of HR practices. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant limitation of the current study
was the fact that the outcome data and the climate and HR practices data were collected at
the same point in time. While we presented and tested models in which we assumed a causal
ﬂow from HR practices to organizational climate to organizational outcome, there is the
possibility, as noted above, that these relationships may occur in reverse order. That is,
outcomes may stimulate organizations to initiate HR practices that then change the climate
and make the organization more effective. Adequate time between assessments of these
different groups of variables would strengthen the causal inferences that can be derived from
data similar to ours. This longitudinal work will need to consider carefully the time interval
between the collection of the different variables, as well as their sequencing.

A second potential limitation of the study was the source of various data. Customer service
outcomes were obtained from customers while climate and HR practices data were obtained
from organizational respondents. We mentioned above that knowledge of the customer
service data might have inﬂuenced climate responses. While this seems improbable, future
investigators might be able to obtain data from organizational respondents who do not have
knowledge of the relevant outcome. Perhaps of equal concern is the fact that reports of HR
practices and organizational climate came from the same source. These measures were
located in different parts of the instrument and the HR practices variables, at least, were
factual and veriﬁable, as opposed to “attitudinal” in nature which should have minimized the
same source bias. It is also true that we had only a single person reporting on the climate
measures. This did not allow us to examine the degree to which different organizational
informants agreed or disagreed as to the organizational climate. Again, different research
designs or data collection methods may be more effective in eliminating this concern.

Finally, we used measures of HR practices that seemed especially relevant to the orga-
nization that sponsored the project that was the source of our data. To our knowledge, no
standard measure of HR practices is currently being used and authors have varied consid-
erably in the way in which they have measured HR practices and the manner in which such
practice measures have been aggregated (Delery, 1998). Our measures are most similar to


K.L. Rogg et al. / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 431– 449

445

those identiﬁed as “technical HRM effectiveness” by Huselid et al. (1997) and we obviously
aggregated the items and measures as though they represented some underlying HR practices
factor. The impact of these decisions in this study will likely affect the generalizability of our
results and their comparability with other studies of the effect of HR practices. A similar
reservation relates to the climate items used in the study. Conceptually, the items were
consistent with past research on climate, but the speciﬁc items reﬂected the organizational
context in which they were used.

We obtained support for the social context model (Ferris et al., 1998) for the customer
service outcome, but we believe that it and similar models should serve to guide future
research in assessing the effectiveness of HR practices and that this research should include
organizational outcomes other than customer satisfaction. Evaluation and support or rejec-
tion of these models will provide needed information as to why HR practices have impact on
organizational effectiveness and the conditions in which such impacts are most likely.
