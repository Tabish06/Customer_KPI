Abstract

(cid:14)

.

Total quality management TQM has been a widely applied process for improving competitiveness around the world, but
with mixed success. A review of the literature revealed gaps in research in this area of qualityroperations management,
particularly in the area of empirical testing of the effectiveness of TQM implementation. The aim of this study was to
examine the total quality management practices and operational performance of a large number of manufacturing companies
in order to determine the relationships between these practices, individually and collectively, and firm performance. We used
a large data base of 1200 Australian and New Zealand manufacturing organisations. The reliability and validity construct,
content, criterion of the practice and performance measures were evaluated. Our study showed that the relationship between
TQM practice and organisational performance is significant in a cross-sectional sense, in that TQM practice intensity
explains a significant proportion of variance in performance. Some but not all of the categories of TQM practice were
particularly strong predictors of performance. The categories of leadership, management of people and customer focus were
the strongest significant predictors of operational performance. This is consistent with literature findings that behavioural
factors such as executive commitment, employee empowerment and an open culture can produce competitive advantage
more strongly than TQM tools and techniques such as process improvement, benchmarking, and information and analysis.

1. Introduction

This article contributes, via a large field study, to
our understanding of an important practical problem,
namely the effectiveness and validity of quality man-
agement systems, in explaining the variance in oper-
ational performance of manufacturing companies.

Whether under a TQM or similar banner, most
manufacturing companies in Europe, the USA, Japan
and Australia have tried working in some way on
improving the following key components of TQM:
ﬂ Leadership
ﬂ Management of people
ﬂ Customer focus
ﬂ Use of information and analysis

ﬂ Process improvement
ﬂ Strategic and quality planning

Many well known companies which were experi-
encing decline in their fortunes, have experienced
wonderful revitalizations, and have restored their
market share and profitability based on TQM. These
include Xerox, Harley Davidson and Ford. Thou-
sands of less well known companies have done
similar to some extent or other. Very few manufac-
turing companies have been able to ignore the ele-
ments of TQM and still prosper. Although the origi-
nal
impetus came from Japanese companies, for
putting the elements listed above together as a fo-
cussed improvement strategy, Western companies
have intensely pursued these ideas and practices
since just before 1980. After twenty years of experi-
ence with TQM practices, it is clear that the perfor-
mance improvements resulting from these fine-
sounding ideals, listed above, are indeed not clear
but are very mixed! Some companies, indeed more
than enough to justify the huge interest in TQM,
have achieved major improvements. At the pinnacle
of lists of those which have accomplished great
improvements are the winners of the various quality
awards around the world. However, for each suc-
cessful implementation of TQM there are many which
have not been able to translate their efforts into
operational or business improvement. As a result,
there is now widespread disillusionment with TQM,
and many are saying that ‘the bubble has burst’.
How does this evidence fit with the intrinsic attrac-
tiveness of the elements of TQM, and with the
significant number of successes? Many Japanese and
Western companies did indeed build or rebuild their
competitiveness based on the principles of TQM.

This study provides a contribution to the literature
through the analysis of a large database of TQM
practices and performance in companies in two coun-
tries, Australia and New Zealand. Reliability and
validity of the empirically based model are computed
and conclusions are drawn on the explanatory and
predictive power of the TQM elements. Issues are
raised about each of the seven elements.

The following research questions are empirically

investigated in this study:
1. Are the elements of TQM reliable and valid for
measuring and predicting organisational perfor-
mance?

2. Which elements of TQM are best predictors of

organisational performance?
Answering the above questions will contribute to
a deeper understanding of the business value and the
strategic role of each of the elements of TQM. This
would help managers with the allocation of resources
to those categories that have the most significant
effect on organisational performance.

2. Literature review and research problem back-
ground

2.1. Purpose of the literature re˝iew

.

(cid:14)

In the last several years, influential media such as
the Harvard Business Review Debate, 1992 have
published many articles on TQM. Even more re-
cently, researchers have begun empirical verification
on answering the simple questions: ‘‘What works?’’
and ‘‘How does it work?’’ Flynn et al., 1994;
Powell, 1995 . Our literature review identified over
1000 articles on the TQM philosophy and methods.
Only a small percentage of these articles attempted
to test the strength of the relationship between TQM
and organisational performance.

(cid:14)

.

2.2. The de˝elopment of TQM

influential

One of the most

individuals in the
quality revolution was Dr. Edwards Deming. In 1980,
NBC television produced a special program entitled
If Japan Can. Why Can’t We? The widely viewed
program revealed Deming’s key role in the develop-
ment of Japanese quality. As business and industry
began to focus on quality, the US government recog-
nised that quality is critical to the nation’s economic
health.
the Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Award MBNQA was established as a state-
ment of national intent to provide quality leadership.
Similar quality awards and frameworks were created
in other industrialised countries. Other key influ-
encers in the early days, who made significant con-
tributions to the development of both the conceptual
and practical sides of quality management, were
.
Crosby 1979 and Juran 1989 .

In 1987,

(cid:14)

The quality awards criteria are the most com-
monly used method for categorising TQM elements,
hence our work was guided by what
is rapidly

(cid:14)

becoming the ‘universal’ awards structure. A num-
ber of research studies of TQM and quality awards
systems have been conducted, and led to a debate
about the effectiveness of such awards and of the
various TQM elements. Many of these studies have
been either perceptual studies or small-scale empiri-
cal works. The present study is a large cross-sec-
tional examination of the quality-related practices
and performance of over 1200 manufacturing organi-
sations. In this section we examine some of the key
existing empirical studies and their limitations.

(cid:14)

.

Bemowski and Stratton 1995 investigated the
usefulness of the MBNQA criteria. Surveys were
sent to a randomly selected sample of 3000 people
worldwide. A response rate of 28% was achieved.
The study found that the usefulness of the MBNQA
criteria, overall, has met or exceeded users’ expecta-
tions and that the criteria were being used primarily
to obtain information on how to achieve business
excellence. However, that study failed to establish a
link between the MBNQA and organisational perfor-
mance. Helton 1995 attempts to demonstrate that
the MBNQA winners in the US achieved more than
double the wealth creation rate of the average market
increase, as measured by stock price movements.
Helton concluded that: ‘‘An investment of US$1000
in each publicly owned quality award winner has
increased by 99% through September 1, 1994. This
correspond favourably to a 41.9% gain on principal
if the same dollars had been invested in the Dow
Jones Industrials or a 34.1% gain if invested in
Standards and Poor’s 500 stocks on the award dates’’.
Black and Porter 1996 conducted factor analysis
on a questionnaire administered to quality manager
practitioners. From this they established a list of ten
factors that are described as critical to TQM. Al-
though their approach is sound, and indeed is similar
to ours, it like ours suffers from the general weak-
ness of factor analysis, that relates to the absence of
prescriptive rules about how many factors are sensi-
ble. Black and Porter sensibly use Eigenvalues and
‘variance explained’ criteria to justify their choice of
10 factors, whereas we have chosen to stay with the
six categories of TQM practices common to quality
award systems. We then test these for significance
and predictive power.

(cid:14)

.

In a similar study, Saraph et al. 1989 established
eight factors, some of which are similar to those of

(cid:14)

.

Black and Porter, and to the quality award cate-
gories. However, there is certainly not a clear agree-
ment as to what the ‘real’ factors of TQM are, and
there will always be disagreements as to ‘how to
best cut the TQM cake’ into factors or elements.
Noting that the differences exist and are generally
not major, we prefer to use a well established factor
set, the awards framework categories, and move on
to test the correspondence of these factors, individu-
ally and collectively, with organisational perfor-
mance measures, which is an additional step from
Black and Porter’s contribution.

.

(cid:14)

Our motivation is based on wishing to contribute
to knowledge about ‘What works?’ This means us-
.
ing methods similar to those of Saraph et al. 1989
and Black and Porter 1996 , but also using matched
performance data, to test linkages of the established
factors to a performance factor.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

Ahire et al. 1996 also developed a model using
similar techniques to Black and Porter. Their list of
factors is, as expected, similar to both Saraph et al.
and Black and Porter’s, and while Ahire did include
‘product quality’ as a factor, they did not include
aspects of organisational performance in their study.
A qualitative study by Easton 1993 provides
assessment of the MBNQA based on his experience
as an Examiner and Senior Examiner with the
Baldrige Award for four years, involving 22 compa-
nies. Easton 1993 states: ‘‘TQM in the US is far
from mature. It is important that TQM approaches
continue to be developed, refined, and expanded,
even in companies that have already achieved con-
siderable success. Otherwise the competitive advan-
tage that TQM promises will not be realised and
many companies will be left struggling against com-
petitive decline without and unified or coherent start
for revitalisation.’’ Although these qualitative views
based on practical experience are of substantial value,
empirical evidence is also needed based on what
Black and Porter 1996 referred to as ‘‘scientifically
based’’ frameworks.

(cid:14)

.

Rigorous statistical analysis is required in order to
meet professional standards of reliability and valid-
ity. This approach would enable items to be retained
or removed based on multivariate statistical analysis
such as Principal ComponentsrFactor Analysis
procedures. To our knowledge, this has not been
done with any statistical rigour based on a large

N )1000 and randomly selected sample. Previous
studies have been generally based on between about
20 and 200 observations.

3. Theoretical framework and research hypothe-
ses

3.1. TQM elements

Although there are always going to be debates
about how to categorise elements of a holistic pro-
cess and framework such as TQM, it is necessary to
decompose it
in some way to facilitate analysis.
Since the most pervasive and universal method has
been awards criteria such as the MBNQA, we have
chosen to follow that framework. Our empirical con-
structs are guided by the main criteria of these
quality awards frameworks, particularly the best
known of them, the MBNQA.

There are seven award criteria, each assigned a
number of points, such that the total for all criteria
leads to a score out of a possible total of 1000. In
this section we describe the seven criteria, which we
have adopted as TQM model elements. Our empiri-
cal work aims to validate these seven elements as
constructs and determine the relationships between
the six practice elements and the seventh, which is
performance outcomes.

3.1.1. Leadership

This element is considered the major ‘driver’ of
TQM which examines senior executives’ leadership
and personal involvement in setting strategic direc-
tions and building and maintaining a leadership sys-
tem that will facilitate high organisational perfor-
mance, individual development, and organisational
learning. TQM advocates emphasise the activities of
senior leadership much like transformational leader-
ship theory Burns, 1978; Bass, 1985 . The core
.
issues in our leadership construct see Appendix A
included the creation of unity of purpose, encourage-
ment of change, management of the environment,
and use of operator’s ideas in improving the busi-
ness.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

3.1.2. People management

The main issue addressed in this category is how
well the human resource practices tie into and are

.

aligned with the organisation’s strategic directions.
Excellence in this category, according to Garvin
(cid:14)
1991 comes down to a simple test: the voice of the
people. Our survey questions focussed on training,
development, communication, safety, multi-skilling
and employee flexibility, employee responsibility and
measurement of employee satisfaction. The answers
to these types of questions are the bottom line on
human resource management because they capture
the combined impact of TQM training, communica-
tion, and involvement programs. Commonly heard
statements by CEO’s such as ‘‘People are really
everything’’ and ‘‘People are our critical resource’’
lead to an expectation that this variable will have
significant explanatory power on performance.

3.1.3. Customer focus

This element addresses how and how well the
organisation determines current and emerging cus-
tomer requirements and expectations, provides effec-
tive customer relationship management, and deter-
mines customer satisfaction Evans and Lindsay,
1995 . We also measured the extent to which cus-
tomer related information is disseminated through
the organisation and the extent of customer com-
plaint resolution. Customer focus is the underpinning
principle in the TQM philosophy.

(cid:14)

.

3.1.4. Strategic planning

.

(cid:14)

This element focuses on the organisation’s strate-
gic and business planning and deployment of plans,
along with the organisation’s attention to customer
and operational performance requirements Evans
and Lindsay, 1995 . The emphasis is on customer-
driven quality and operational performance excel-
lence as key strategic business issues that need to be
an integral part of overall business planning. It is
appropriate to distinguish between the TQM perspec-
tive of strategy and corporate strategy. The TQM
perspective deals extensively with business unit
strategy in the sense of ‘how to compete for a set of
customers.’ On the other hand, corporate strategy
deals with ‘how to decide which customers to com-
pete for.’ The extent of a defined central purpose and
mission in the organisation was also a part of this
construct.

3.1.5. Information and analysis

(cid:14)

.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)
.

This element is concerned with the ‘‘scope, man-
agement, and use of data and information to maintain
a customer focus, to drive quality excellence, and to
improve . . . performance’’ Malcolm Baldrige Na-
tional Award Criteria, 1995 . The TQM philosophy
emphasises Decision making based on fact involv-
ing analysis of information about customer needs,
operational problems, and the success of improve-
ment attempts. Many popular TQM techniques e.g.,
cause-and-effect analysis, Pareto charts are aimed at
helping organisations to process information effec-
tively Dean and Bowen, 1994 . The TQM literature
suggests that organisations that consistently collect
and analyse information will be more successful than
those that do not. However, empirical studies in the
literature suggest that the sort of information and
analysis advocated by the TQM philosophy can actu-
ally inhibit organisational performance. For example,
Fredrickson 1984 found that although comprehen-
sive decision making was positively related to organ-
isational performance in the highly stable paint in-
dustry,
it was negatively related to organisational
performance in the highly unstable forest product
industry. Dean and Bowen 1994 conclude that
management theorists see information processing as
useful in general but potentially irrelevant or even
hazardous in specific situations. As TQM moves
from the original domain of application, manufactur-
ing, towards use in research, marketing, and cus-
tomer service activities, such uncertain conditions
are more likely. Our survey questions on information
and analysis focussed on the extent of benchmarking
conducted throughout the organisation, over most of
the categories that determine business competitive-
ness.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

3.1.6. Process management

This element of TQM is concerned with how the
organisation designs and introduces products and
services, integrates production and delivery require-
ments and manages the performance of suppliers
(cid:14)
Evans and Lindsay, 1995 . The core idea behind
this principle of TQM is that organisations are sets
of interlinked processes, and that improvement of
these processes is the foundation of performance
improvement Deming, 1986 . Deming saw sets of
interlinked processes as systems, and his treatment of

.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

organisational systems is generally consistent with
the use of this term in management theory. Accord-
ing to Dean and Bowen 1994 the intellectual turf
represented by this category has been abandoned by
management theorists and is currently occupied by
industrial engineers. Some organisations have experi-
enced dramatic performance improvements through
process redesign and reengineering Hammer and
.
Champy, 1993; Stewart, 1993 .

(cid:14)

3.1.7. Performance

The performance element of TQM focuses on
quality performance, operational and business perfor-
mance indicators. We have given this construct sepa-
rate status in our study, as the ‘dependent’ variable
to which we fit the other categories as independent
variables. Our measures were of customer satisfac-
tion, employee morale, productivity, quality of out-
put and delivery performance.

3.2. Research hypotheses

Our first hypothesis is concerned with the validity
and reliability of the TQM construct and its ele-
ments, while the second hypothesis deals with the
predictive power of these elements.

3.2.1. Hypothesis H1

The TQM elements individually and collectively
comprise a reliable and valid instrument for measur-
ing TQM practice and performance.

3.2.2. Hypothesis H2

There is a significantly positive relationship be-
tween TQM element strength and operational perfor-
mance.

4. Methodology

4.1. Background

The stated hypotheses were tested using a mail
survey of manufacturing site managers that was con-
ducted in 1994 by the Australian Manufacturing
Council AMC in conjunction with the Australian
Bureau of Statistics, and the Manufacturing Advisory
Group New Zealand . The various factor analyses,
multiple regressions, and other statistical calculations

were conducted using the SPSS Windows v6.0 soft-
ware. Our sample was purposefully a truly random
sample of manufacturing companies.

.
Whereas the GAO study and that of Helton 1995
were of ‘superior quality’ companies, and there is
much attention given to quality award winners around
the globe, the largely ‘unstudied’ companies, that are
not quality leaders, but that comprise most of the
manufacturing sector of an economy, merit further
investigation in terms of their quality practices and
operational performance.

(cid:14)

4.2. Sample

.

(cid:14)

The sample population is a stratified random sam-
ple drawn from manufacturing sites that employ
more than twenty people and were registered with
the Australian Bureau of Statistics, or Statistics New
Zealand in 1993. For each country, the sample was
stratified using twelve industry codes ASIC and
NZIC and three size categories. This stratification
ensured that for the Australian sample, each cell
contains a minimum of 15 respondents. A total of
approximately 4000 manufacturing sites 3000 in
Australia and 1000 in New Zealand were sent the
questionnaire. Responses were received from 1289
sites, 962 in Australia and 327 in New Zealand;
yielding response rates of 32% and 38%, respec-
tively. A telephone survey of 108 non-respondents
was conducted by the AMC. These non-respondents
were asked a sub-set of questions that had a high
predictive validity for the rest of the questionnaire,
and were examined for other differences such as
scale and location. No significant response bias was
detected AMC, 1994 . As will be discussed later in
the section on data preparation, 265 respondents of

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

the original 1289 have been dropped from the sam-
ple due to an excessive number of unanswered ques-
tions. This left a total of 1024 useable responses that
formed the data set for all analyses in this study.

4.3. Sur˝ey instrument

.

(cid:14)

.

The survey instrument was a 17-page survey
mailed to site managers. A total of 246 questions
were included in the questionnaire. All responses
were returned within a 10-week period. The ques-
tions in the survey were developed by a committee
(cid:14)
including one of the authors , site
of academics
managers, and the chairman of the Australian Qual-
ity Awards Foundation. This committee used a vari-
ety of sources in developing the questions, including
the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Crite-
ria 1994 , the Deming Prize Criteria, the European
Quality Award Criteria, the Australian Quality Award
.
Criteria, 1994 Australian Quality Council, 1994 ,
and Made in Britain 1992 . The questionnaire was
pilot
tested on six sites in Australia, and subse-
quently revised. Given the length and complexity of
the instrument, Ergas and Wright 1994 tested the
data for ‘respondent fatigue’ and ‘awareness’ of
changes in the tone andror measurement scale of the
questions. They found little or no evidence of these
types of bias. Further details of the survey method
and the profile of companies involved are given in a
recent article by Terziovski et al. 1997 in which an
examination of the efficacy of quality management
systems certification was made.

Three distinct stages of data preparation are per-

formed prior to conducting the main analyses.

(

)

4.4.1. Selection of questions

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

The first stage involves the selection of questions
to include in the final data set. Many of the questions
in the survey instrument were not directly concerned
with TQM and organisational performance. For ex-
ample there was a series of questions on the extent
of use of advanced manufacturing technology and
manufacturing process and strategy, which are rele-
vant to other analyses but not to this investigation of
TQM implementation. We used the 53 variables in
this analysis that were TQM related and allocated
them to seven constructs based on the 1995 MBNQA
examination criteria Evans and Lindsay, 1995 and
existing literature on the issues of quality manage-
ment and TQM Deming, 1986; Saraph et al., 1989;
Garvin, 1991; Adam, 1994; Flynn et al., 1994; Pow-
ell, 1995 . The seven constructs have been assigned
the labels in accordance with the theoretical con-
structs discussed in Section 3.1 of this paper: Leader-
ship; People Management; Customer Focus; Strate-
gic Planning;
Information and Analysis; Process
Management; Performance. These constructs were
tested for construct validity after having been nomi-
nated because of their close fit with the intended
meaning of the generally accepted quality manage-
ment elements and the various international quality
award frameworks such as the MBNQA categories.
Our choice of questions was driven by previous
empirical studies, particularly Adam 1994 and the
content analysis of the literature base of TQM, and
validated through the statistical analysis described
below.

.

(cid:14)

.

4.4.2. Screening of outliers

The second stage of data preparation was the
screening for outliers, and checking the normality of
the data. Four of the variables are based on continu-
ous scales. All of these required a natural logarithm
transformation to correct for excessive skew and
kurtosis. In addition, three data points were identi-
z-scores all )10 and have been
fied as outliers
deleted. All of the remaining variables utilise interval
scales; predominantly five point Likert-type scales.
Only one of the interval scale variables required a
transformation to correct for excessive skew and
kurtosis. After appropriate transformations and dele-
tions, six of the 53 variables still suffer skew in the

range of 1.00 to 1.60. These variables have been
retained. One other variable is heavily skewed skew
.s3.65 , and has been dropped from the analysis. A
summary of the wording, and scales for each of the
53 variables can be found in Appendix A.

4.4.3. Treatment of incomplete responses

The third and final stage of data preparation was
treatment of incomplete responses. Factor Analysis
and Multiple Regression Analysis require all cells in
the data set be complete. Only 352 of the original
1289 responses are complete. Thus, the researcher is
faced with dropping almost
three quarters of the
responses, or using a technique such as imputing
missing cells with the variable mean. The latter of
these two options, substituting the variable mean, is
only advisable when the proportion of blank cells is
low Bentler, 1993, pp. 46–47 . For the purposes of
the analyses reported in this paper, a compromise
approach has been adopted. If any response has more
than 6 empty cells among the 53 variables, then the
entire response has been deleted from the data set.
This approach yields 1024 responses with only 1.2%
missing cells. Within this sample of 1024, the vari-
able means have been substituted for missing cells.

(cid:14)

The variables assigned to each of the seven TQM
constructs have been subjected to factor analysis to
ensure that they are reliable indicators of those con-
structs Nunnally, 1967 . A cutoff loading of 0.450
has been used to screen out variables that are weak
indicators of the constructs Tables 1 and 2 . Eight
variables failed to make this cutoff, leaving a total of
45 variables constituting the seven constructs. The
composite reliabilities of five of the seven constructs
meet Nunnally’s recommended standard Cronbach
Alpha G0.70 for early stage research Nunnally,
1967, p. 245 . The reliabilities of the remaining two
constructs: ‘Process Management’ and ‘Organisa-
tional Performance’, both fall mildly short of this
.
standard 0.697 and 0.674, respectively . However,
further culling of variables will not
improve this
situation, as the reduction in the number of indicators
outweighs the benefits of shedding the less reliable

.
those of Black and Porter 1996 .

(cid:14)

Once the factor analysis was completed, factor
scores were calculated from the remaining variables
to provide estimates for each of the seven constructs.
The factor scores for the first six constructs were
used as independent variables in a multiple regres-
sion analysis. A correlation matrix of the factor
scores for these six constructs was produced. The
factor scores for the seventh construct, Performance,
were used as the dependent variable in the regression
analysis.

5. Results

ables are identified by their code names that are
explained in Appendix A.

Table 2 shows the factor loadings for the seventh
element of our survey, which was to be our depen-
dent variable, Performance.

The slightly lower than standard acceptable value
of a for F7, Performance, is interpreted such that
performance is indeed composed of multiple dimen-
sions or elements. Such disparate measures as qual-
ity, productivity, employee morale, customer satis-
faction and delivery performance contributed to this
construct, and we know from scanning and cutting
the data set and from the literature see Samson et
al., 1993 that firms often specialise or focus to excel
in only a subset of these performance dimensions.

be expected, that firms which are advanced in their
practices on some factors tend generally to be more
advanced on others.

These correlations between factor elements of
TQM are broadly similar to those of Ahire et al.
(cid:14)
1996 , who established 12 TQM factors that had
correlations generally in the range of 0.2 to 0.7
between them.

.

Although the correlation coefficients were gener-
ally above 0.2, and were therefore highly significant
as one would expect with over 1000 observations, it
is interesting to note that F5: Information and Analy-
sis did not seem so closely related to the rest of the
group.

Table 4 shows the multiple regression of all six
factors regressed on the dependent variable F7: Or-
ganisational Performance. From this analysis, our
intent was to test the hypothesis stated earlier and
hence contribute to knowledge about the relationship
between the six driving TQM practice elements and
performance.

6. Discussion of results and findings

6.1. Tests of hypothesis H1

Information about validity and reliability were
needed in order to determine whether the seven

.

elements of TQM are stable and accurate and whether
they truly measure what they set out to measure
(cid:14)Saraph et al., 1989; Flynn et al., 1994, Black and
Porter, 1996 . This provides assurance that the find-
ings reflect an accurate measure of the underlying
constructs
focus,
strategic planning, information and analysis, process
management, and performance and that the results
are believable.

6.1.1. Validity

Three different types of validity were considered
in this study: content, construct and criterion validity
.
(cid:14)
Hair et al., 1992 .

6.1.1.1. Content ˝alidity. A category was considered
to have content validity if there was general agree-
ment from the literature that the TQM model had
measurement
items that cover all aspects of the
variable being measured. Since selection of the ini-
tial measurement items was based on the extensive
review of international literature and the evaluation
criteria of major international quality awards from
Australia, the United States, Japan and Europe, our
measures were generally considered to have content
validity. They generally do measure the key fields of
the TQM elements.

(

)

403

6.1.1.2. Construct ˝alidity. A measure has construct
validity if it measures the theoretical construct that it
was designed to measure. The construct validity of
each category was evaluated by using Principal
Components Factor Analysis Hair et al., 1992 . The
measurement items for each of the categories were
factor analysed as discussed in the Analysis Proce-
dure in the Methodology section. The results are
shown in Table 1. Items that had a factor loading
less than 0.450 were eliminated e.g., item Ln_bm3a
in the Leadership construct, which is shown in Table
.1 . All factors loaded acceptably well.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

6.1.1.3. Criterion ˝alidity. This is also known as
predictive validity or external validity. It
is con-
cerned with the extent to which the model is related
to independent measures of organisational perfor-
mance. The criterion related validity of the model
was determined by examining the Multiple R coeffi-
cient computed for the six categories and the mea-
.
sure of performance 0.463 as shown in Table 4 .
This indicates that the six categories have a reason-
ably high degree of criterion-related validity when
taken together.

(cid:14)

6.1.2. Reliability

.

Reliability is frequently defined as the degree of
consistency of a measure. The internal consistency of
a set of measurement items, therefore, refers to the
degree to which items in the set are homogeneous.
Reliability analysis is a correlation-based procedure.
Internal consistency for the seven elements was esti-
mated using the reliability coefficient, Chronbach
Alpha ranging between the values 0.00 and 1.00
(cid:14)
Nunnally, 1967 . Using the SPSS for Windows
reliability test program, an internal consistency anal-
ysis was performed separately for each of the model
elements shown in Table 1. The analysis revealed
that maximisation of the Chronbach Alpha coeffi-
cient would require eliminating items for each cate-
gory. Table 1 reports the original sets of measure-
ment items associated with the relevant TQM ele-
ments, the items dropped from the original sets to
achieve maximisation of alpha, and the reliability
coefficient associated with the resulting categories.
The reliabilities shown in Table 1 generally meet or
exceed prevailing standards of reliability for survey

instruments. Considering the above findings, hypoth-
esis H1 on reliability and validity and is supported.
Each of the seven categories did form a ‘solid’
construct, from both a theoretical and statistical per-
spective.

6.2. Test for hypothesis H2

(cid:14)

The results of the regression analysis of the six
TQM elements on Performance provide some in-
sights and challenges from both a practical and
research perspective. Three of the factors, Leader-
ship, Human Resources Management and Customer
Focus proved to be strongly significant and posi-
tively related to Performance. The other three factors
were shown Table 4 to be either not significantly
related Planning and Process Management or nega-
tively related Information and analysis . All of the
independent variable constructs had significant posi-
tive correlation with each other, explaining why the
least squares algorithm produced the regression re-
sults reported in Table 4. Overall, the multiple R-
value of 0.463 is interpreted as indicating a relatively
strong relationship, accompanied by an F-statistic
for the regression which is highly significant.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

6.3. Findings

It is interesting that the strong predictors of per-
formance were the so-called ‘soft’ factors of leader-
ship, human resources management and customer
focus, and the more systems and analytic oriented
criteria information and analysis, strategic planning,
process analysis were not strongly and positively
related to performance in the regression.

(cid:14)

.

It is important to note that from these results, we
cannot suggest that for a single company, strategic
management and process management should not be
the focus of improvement because they are not re-
lated to performance, nor that better information and
analysis in a company leads to worse performance.
Nor can we directly say that
the world’s quality
awards systems are ‘wrong’ because some of the
related TQM elements do not contribute positively to
explain performance variance in a multiple regres-
sion. Our study was cross-sectional and descriptive
of a given sample at a given point in time, whereas


404

(

)

the quality awards are being used to measure and
suggest dimensions of improvement in order to in-
crease organisational practices, quality and perfor-
mance. Quality awards frameworks are often use-
fully interpreted as a set of values through which to
pursue improvement for a given company or site,
longitudinally.

We do claim, however, that the relative strengths
and significance of the regression coefficients in
Table 4 coupled with the correlations between these
factors are instructive in understanding the underly-
ing differences between high-performance and low-
performance firms. So in respect of H2, three of the
criteria proved to be strongly positively and indepen-
dently related to organisational performance and al-
though there were strong inter-correlations among all
six practice elements of TQM, multivariate regres-
.
sion certainly sorted out the less important weaker
factors that had little or no additional positive ex-
planatory power over the powerful three. A manage-
rial insight which can be deduced from this is that in
‘fighting the good fight’ of improving organisational
performance, concentrate mostly on people manage-
ment, leadership and customer focus. This is not to
say that the other three factors should be ignored but
rather to note that in our cross-sectional study, these
weaker factors did not powerfully distinguish the
high from the low performers whereas the first three
factors clearly did appear as differentiators.

plained by a myriad of other factors including tech-
nology, scale, business structure and focus, and luck.
However any management methods that explain over
20% of performance variance as in this study and
that of Ahire et al. 1996 do not merit the label
‘failure’. Based on much fieldwork and close obser-
vation of how TQM is implemented, we have strongly
concluded that TQM is substantially composed of
‘the right
there is
widespread or general failure, and there is, our belief
is that it is not so much in the content of TQM and
its elements, but in how it is implemented. Failure to
explain higher proportions of variance in perfor-
mance may come from the variance in implementa-
tion effectiveness, as much as anything else. Cross-
sectional studies such as Adam 1994 , Ahire et al.
(cid:14)
1996 , Black and Porter 1996 and ours also suffer
from not being able to account for the lag that exists
between the time that new practices are introduced
and performance improvements are observed. We
suspect that this contributes to values of R-squared
that are lower than would be the case if such lags
could be properly accounted for.

7. Conclusions, limitations and further research

.

(cid:14)

Ahire et al. concluded that of their eleven factors
cutting across all areas of TQM, product quality is
most closely affected by ‘‘quality-oriented human
resource management’’ 1996, p. 43 . Our finding is
consistent with this and indeed goes further, in that
performance of the organisation is related more to
these ‘soft’ factors than quality systems and struc-
tural factors.

(cid:14)

.

Adam 1994 reported R-squared values for qual-
ity elements in terms of their explanatory power on
various performance factors ranging from 0.05 to
0.5. Based on his low R-squared value of Training
and Development on Sales 0.1632 and other similar
relationships, Adam poses the case for ‘‘TQM as a
Failure’’ 1994, p. 41 . We believe this argument to
be a strawman, and that R-squared values such as
ours 0.21 are indeed significant. Certainly there is
substantial unexplained variance in our performance
construct, some of which would presumably be ex-

(cid:14)

.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

The central finding of this study is that the TQM
model, as we modelled it in a cross-sectional study,
is a reliable and valid instrument for predicting
performance. Three of the elements of TQM, leader-
ship, people management and customer focus have a
significantly positive effect, but the other three cate-
gories in our study strategic quality planning, infor-
mation and analysis and process management did
not.

(cid:14)

.

In a large random survey study such as ours, there
was a good deal of variance in performance not
explained by our TQM elements, as tested by the
regression analysis. This was across a set of compa-
nies that varied in size from 20 to 3000 employees,
across
all manufacturing industries. The great
strength of the TQM model and construct elements
occurs in our view when companies use the approach
to audit their TQM practices and performance, then
set targets and strategic improvement plans for im-

provement based on these drivers of performance.
Our research does cast a strong light on these practi-
cal issues in terms of which three of the six ‘prac-
tice’ elements are likely to be the most important
influencers of the organisational performance mea-
sure. Our research, which accords well with practical
experience, suggests to us that efforts in improved
leadership, human resources management and cus-
tomer focus are more likely to be fruitful than efforts
in improving information and analysis, strategic
planning and process management.

Despite the fact

that our study is one of the
largest, most comprehensive in the field,
it does
suffer from limitations, and these give rise to a
number of suggestions for further research. The in-
ternal validity of our variables is acceptably strong,
but far from perfect. Further empirical research could
become tighter than the present study by pre-testing
the factors that more closely represent
the TQM
elements, which would hopefully achieve higher va-
lidity scores. Further research on refining the con-
structs and their elements is warranted.

The research reported here is of a purely cross-
sectional snapshot. We were unable to test and ac-
count for the lags between the existence of practices
and performance changes, nor to trace the progress

of particular companies in our study, which is a
limitation of all such studies. Therefore we suggest
that two further streams of field research are needed.
The first is a set of longitudinal studies that would
measure TQM elements across a three to five year
period, examining the relationships and their devel-
opment
through time. These should be structured
studies using statistically credible samples and multi-
variate methods. This implies a need for reasonably
large and random samples like ours, rather than the
quite small studies that have often been reported on,
and the use of ‘convenience’ samples, which do not
permit proper extrapolation of results from the sam-
ple to a population.

In addition,

in depth case studies are needed
which detail the impact of TQM elements and im-
provement initiatives on these factors, which many
firms are now using internally, to determine the rich
fabric of how these initiatives lead to performance
changes. Structured interview processes would also
be able to investigate what other systematic factors
relate to performance changes apart
from those
presently measured by the TQM elements, which
might lead to an improvement in the definition of
those measures in the quest for better answering the
question: ‘What works?’
