Abstract: As the impact of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the environment 
increases, there is a need for effective environmental policies to sustain their development. 
Under this condition, SMEs implement innovation to meet environmental regulations and to 
achieve  environmental  competitiveness  in  sustainability.  We  examine  the  impact  of 
environmental innovation on labor productivity in SME manufacturers. The literature shows 
that  complementary  assets  help  SMEs  to  increase  their  performance  in  environmental 
innovation. Therefore, we study the interactive effects of the SMEs’ business-group affiliation 
and  the  listing  status  on  the  relationship  between  environmental  innovation  and  labor 
productivity. We add these interaction terms to multivariate regressions by using the 2010 
Korea Innovation Survey. The results show that SMEs are able to use environmental innovation 
as a business strategy for green growth with improved labor productivity. Also, the results 
highlight that the business-group affiliation and the listing status as the complementary assets 
positively moderate the performance of the environmental innovation of the SMEs.

1. Introduction 

7413 

The  idea  of  committing  to  environmentally  sound  practices  has  attracted  considerable  attention 
associated  with  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  manufacturing  industry  because  
these  firms  generate  a  large  amount  of  pollution  and  have  a  significantly  negative  effect  on  the 
environment [1]. There are three main factors currently affecting the SMEs’ environmental activities: 
environmental regulations, stakeholders’ pressure, and competitive advantage [1–3]. First, environmental 
regulations can curb pollution levels by motivating or even requiring polluting firms to decrease their 
emissions  [4–6].  However,  environmental  regulations  have  exhibited  limitations  regarding  both  the 
distribution of environmental technologies to the SMEs and the composition of readily understandable 
regulations for the SMEs [1,7]. Therefore, research should further examine the effective ways for policy 
makers to help the SMEs implement environmental management. Second, an increase in the stakeholders’ 
environmental concerns results in the implementation of environmental practices, even though the level 
of institutional pressure is different depending on the organizational structure [8,9]. The purposes behind 
the  environmental  efforts  of  SMEs  are  not  only  to  meet  the  needs  of  environmental  activities  from 
stakeholders and the regulations but also to achieve a competitive advantage for sustainable development 
in the emerging green market [2,10,11]. Nevertheless, even in the presence of these motivating factors, 
SMEs are afraid to implement environmental activities because of lack of resources [1]. In spite of the 
circumstance,  SMEs  develop  environmental  innovation  for  sustainable  development  to  obtain 
competitiveness in their future market. In order to successfully motive them to undertake environmental 
practices,  studies  are  needed  that  examine  the  relationship  between  environmental  innovation  and 
performance  in  SMEs  and  complementary  assets  to  improve  their  environmental  performance  that 
previous studies have not dealt with. Hence, this study poses the following question: 

How Do Complementary Assets Support SMEs to Improve Their Environmental Performance? 

Complementary assets are existing resources that catch the value of other resources or enable firms 
to obtain the benefits of a practice [12]. Christmann [13] mentioned that complementary assets could 
moderate  the  relationship  between  environmental  activities  and  competitive  advantage.  This  study 
considers the complementary assets as business-group affiliation and listing on the financial market, 
because these activities are feasible for SMEs to increase their environmental performance by overcoming 
their shortcomings [14,15].  

With regard to environmental practices, Brammer et al. [16] and Brammer and Pavelin [17] argue 
that most research have focused on large and listed firms because the environmental performances of 
these firms can have significant effects on marketplace variables. However, business-oriented empirical 
studies of the SMEs’ environmental management are few in number. Researchers in this field should fill 
in this gap by examining the SMEs’ environmental innovation because SMEs account globally for at 
least 80% of the firms and thus significantly influence manufacturing [18,19]. Some research has found 
that  SMEs  frequently  have  difficulty  adopting  environmental  practices  owing  to  both  insufficient 
resources and limited awareness of the practices’ benefits [16]. By contrast, other research has found 
that  SMEs  can  strengthen  their  environmental  innovation  and  practices  by  sharing  resources  within 
private-sector networks and by establishing a degree of flexibility in their organizational structure [20]. 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
The results of our study will contribute to environmental research by focusing on the environmental 
innovation of SMEs in the manufacturing sector.

As one of the complementary assets in this study, business-group affiliation refers to an association 
of legal independent firms in various sectors that are connected to each other with formal (e.g., equity) 
and informal (e.g., family) ties [21]. Some studies discussed the relationship between this norm and 
corporate performance [22,23]. The affiliated firms can strengthen their own financial performance by 
reducing transaction costs and by sharing both resources and risks with one another [24,25]. The benefits 
stemming from business-group structures as complementary assets can also increase the outcome of 
firms’ environmental innovation [13].  

The listing status is whether a firm is publicly traded (listed firm) or privately held (non-listed firm) [26]. 
The listing status is another complementary factor with which SMEs can improve their environmental 
performance. Listed firms should clearly disclose their environmental performance to reduce stakeholders’ 
environmental concerns [27]. That is, such disclosure can increase the transparency of firms’ eco-friendly 
efforts, thereby helping to establish a good reputation for the firms among their internal and external 
investors [28]. In this vein, our study extends the environmental research by examining the moderating 
effects  of  business-group  affiliation  and  listing  status  on  the  relationship  between  environmental 
innovation and labor productivity for SME manufacturers.  

In  terms  of  the  necessity  of  studying  Korean  SMEs,  there  are  three  distinctive-characteristics 
compared  to  SMEs  in  other  countries.  First,  the  role  of  the  SMEs  in  manufacturing  has  continuously 
increased since the late 1970s. In 2010, SMEs accounted for 99.9% of the manufacturing firms and 87.7% 
of  the  employment  in  South  Korea’s  manufacturing  sector  [29].  Second,  South  Korean  SME 
manufacturers have developed their competitiveness according to various methods that target the rapid 
expansion of capital. For example, these firms have implemented technology upgrades and penetrated 
international markets. In addition, the firms have undertaken rapid growth with cooperation from large 
enterprises or business affiliations [30]. Lastly, support from external sources—whether in the private 
or public sector—has led to the sustainable growth of these SMEs. The South Korean government has 
supported SMEs with policies geared toward tax relief and resource assistance. The SME R&D Support 
Plan of 2010, announced by Korea’s Small and Medium Business Administration, exemplifies the kind 
of  help  that  SMEs  have  been  receiving,  which  in  this  case  involves  the  acquisition  of  advanced 
technology suitable for eco-friendly emerging markets [29]. Therefore, research on South Korean SMEs 
can serve as a useful guideline for private-sector managers and public-sector policymakers. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we demonstrate the theoretical 
background. Section 3 explains the moderating effects with two hypotheses. Section 4 provides our 
methodology. Section 5 presents our results. In Section 6, we discuss the results of this study and present 
political and business strategic contributions. 

2. Environmental Innovation of SMEs 

2.1. Environmental Innovation and Labor Productivity 

According to the resource-based view (RBV), firms can achieve competitive advantages, such as  
cost-reduction and differentiation benefits, by obtaining valuable resources [31]. Hart [32] extended the 

 


7415 

Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
RBV  by  suggesting  the  natural  resource-based  view  (NRBV),  which  firms  can  also  create  new 
competitive  opportunities  by  applying  environmental  activities  to  business  practices  for  sustainable 
management, such as pollution prevention and product stewardship. In other words, firms can likely 
increase their corporate performance with these environmental practices in the future. Environmental 
innovation  is  one  of  representative  environmental  activities,  and  it  works  by  developing  new 
technologies  for  reducing  pollution  or  by  recycling.  For  example,  hundreds  of  new  patents  that  are 
related to this innovation are listed in the US market [33]. Hence, this paper focuses on the impact of 
environmental  innovation  on  labor  productivity.  The  reason  why  this  paper  uses  labor  productivity 
instead of other financial performance measures is that environmental innovation not only increases sales 
through delivering improved service but also environmental process innovation reduces the labor force 
to produce and deliver products or services [34,35]. Much of the literature has empirically supported the 
advantages of environmental innovation [36–40]. For instance, Al-Tuwaijri, Christensen and Hughes [36] 
find  that  firms  increase  their  economic  performance  by  using  pollution-abatement  processes  and 
reducing the amounts of toxic waste that result from simultaneous equation models. In addition, Chiou, 
Chan, Lettice and Chung [38] highlight the potential benefits of environmental innovation by showing 
how  the  firms  will  be  able  to  gain  the  same  entry  barriers  as  their  competitors  in  the  future  and  to  
reduce  the  external  environmental  pressure.  The  authors  claim  that  these  benefits  result  in  a  global 
competitive advantage.  

However, there are controversies regarding the relationship between environmental innovation and 
the corporate performance of SMEs. As a negative perspective, Wilson, Williams and Kemp [1] show 
that a number of SMEs identify environmental innovation as a financial burden and do not understand 
the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental performance. With respect 
to innovative capability, SMEs lack the financial and labor resources to invest in green innovation and 
technologies compared to those of large companies [16]. Some SMEs might consider the implementation 
of environmental innovation not as a business strategy for sustainability but as the compulsory requirements 
of environmental regulation. On the other hand, Lee [18] finds that SME manufacturers have recently 
been  able  to  achieve  a  competitive  advantage  by  adopting  green  management  through  strategic  and 
organizational  changes.  Furthermore,  SMEs  have  an  organizational  advantage  because  of  their  
flexible  structure  that  can  respond  to  changes  in  the  environment  and  efficiently  communicate  to  the 
organization.  The  SMEs  also  have  a  horizontal  management  style  that  helps  with  the  adoption  of 
innovative activities [20].  

Hence, we empirically examine the relationship between environmental innovation and labor productivity 
in SMEs since it is still a debatable issue. In the case of South Korea, SME manufacturers are likely to 
improve their environmental performance through support such as the environmental policies like the 
Framework  Act  on  Sustainable  Development  (FASD)  and  the  Framework  Act  on  Low-Carbon  and 
Green Growth (FALCGG) [33]. 

2.2. Business-Group Affiliation and Labor Productivity 

Most of the business literature shows that the institutional framework and the organizational structure 
influence the competitive advantage and the corporate performance [41–44]. We specifically investigate 
the relationship between the business-group affiliation and the corporate performance because independent 

 


7416 

Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
firms have a different organizational structure from affiliated ones [45]. The results of the relationships 
still remain inconclusive and tend to depend on the measurement and interpretation of the variables. For 
example, Gunduz and Tatoglu [46] find that in Turkey, affiliated firms are not significantly different 
from unaffiliated ones in terms of their economic performance. The market in Turkey is still too small 
and inefficient to reflect the benefits from business-group affiliations. However, Chang and Choi [24] 
and Khanna and Palepu [23] find that affiliated firms can increase their rate of return in emerging markets 
because of the low transition-cost and risk-sharing from an additional affiliation. Affiliated firms within 
a business group then are able to increase their market-oriented performance by overcoming market 
inefficiency  and  reducing  their  transaction-costs.  Even  though  the  literature  supports  the  positive 
relationship between a business-group affiliation and corporate performance, there is little empirical 
evidence from directly examining SMEs. If a SME is a member of a business group, then the benefits of 
the affiliation, such as resource sharing, could be critical in increasing corporate performance which 
supports the result of previous literature.  

3. Moderating Effects on Environmental Performance 

3.1. Business-Group Affiliation 

The business-group affiliation influences the firms’ innovation performance as well as their economic 
performance [47–52]. Generally, firms require capital and labor resources as critical factors in the innovation 
process. These requirements can be met by other affiliates supporting the capital resources that are needed 
to implement the innovation. The managers of the affiliated firms are able to allocate labor resources to 
a suitable position in the business group to increase the labor efficiency of that group [53]. In addition, 
Hsieh, Yeh and Chen [48] show that the business-group affiliation supplies an internal learning network 
to exchange innovative ideas, experiences, and technologies among the firms.  

Beyond  the  benefits  of  internal  cooperation,  affiliated  firms  also  take  advantage  of  the  external 
opportunities from the business-group affiliation to increase their innovation performance. In emerging 
markets, firms restrict the exposure of their innovative ideas to market investors because of the information 
asymmetry and the lack of explicit corporate control [54]. When SMEs are affiliated with a business 
group, they are likely to receive a good reputation from the customers because of the promotion effect of 
the business group and the additional investment from the external investors [55]. RBV also supports that 
internal and external resources from affiliation improve both innovative capabilities and performance [32]. 
Because sharing intangible assets such as knowledge and know-how between affiliated firms are rare 
and tacit. 

In a similar vein, the advantages of a business-group affiliation help firms improve their performance 
in environmental innovation [13]. Some studies find that environmental innovation requires considerable 
capital and labor resources because of the complexity of environmental technology and the difficulty of 
its application in existing practice [56]. Sharing resources among affiliates in the business group could 
especially be important to SMEs because of their shortage of resources in implementing environmental 
innovation [20,57]. Firms also require intangible resource sharing for environmental innovation. For 
example, knowledge sharing assists firms to achieve an improvement in the performance of green product 
and process innovations [25]. As external benefits of the business-group affiliation, firms providing 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
green products and services are likely to share the brand power of the business group because the firms 
cannot easily promote their environmental activities to customers and investors [11,37,58]. Hence, the 
following hypothesis empirically tests this argument: 

7417 

Hypothesis  1:  Business-group  affiliation  positively  moderates  the  relationship  between 
environmental innovation and labor productivity. 

3.2. Listing Status 

Several  studies  show  that  the  behavior  of  environmental  innovation  is  different  depending  on  
the firm’s listing status [26,59–63]. Non-listed firms are usually controlled by a blockholder or a single 
owner. A blockholder does not tend to show strong interest in environmental innovation but focuses on 
the short-term benefits for day-to-day survival [64–66]. In addition, proactive owners, who are willing 
to implement environmental practices, also restrict the application of environmental practices into business 
strategies to their personal preferences [67,68]. Therefore, non-listed firms have difficulty increasing 
their corporate performance by implementing environmental innovation.  

On the other hand, listed firms implement a higher level of CSR than the non-listed firms because of 
their dispersed ownership that includes investors that prefer environmental disclosure [27]. This argument 
is also supported the stakeholder theory, which states that the listed firms should consider environmental 
activities as one of CSR because of increasing importance of sustainable issues in recent years [69]. 
Their objective is to balance the conflicting demands of various stakeholders including but not limited 
to stockholders, creditors, employees, customers, suppliers, and government. For example, listed firms 
should satisfy not only the financial needs of shareholders but also their environmental requirements, 
such  as  the  reduction  of  pollution  and  the  disclosure  of  environmental  accounting  [9].  In  addition, 
Ullmann [63] provides a three-dimensional model to explain correlation among environmental disclosure, 
social and financial performance with the conceptual view. Investors and customers cannot easily access 
the information on the firms’ environmental performance because of the invisibility of environmental 
practices, whereby the stakeholders prefer openness in environmental activities [13,32]. Listed firms 
then disclose a high-quality financial report that includes environmental disclosure [26,59,70]. Firms 
that disclose their environmental practices to the market increase the outcomes of their environmental 
innovation through the external stakeholders’ awareness of these practices. For SMEs, this disclosure is 
also important to inform the external stakeholders in order to increase their corporate performance [28]. 
In accordance with these arguments, we put forward the following hypothesis: 

Hypothesis 2: A market listing positively moderates the relationship between environmental 
innovation and labor productivity. 

4. Methodology 

4.1. Sample and Data Collection 

The research on environmental innovation is not mature yet for South Korean SMEs, and it is difficult 
to obtain environmental survey data for SMEs. The Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), a 
governmental research organization, conducted the 2010 Korea Innovation Survey (KIS) to investigate 

 


7418 

Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
the  innovative  capability  of  manufacturing  firms  in  the  period  of  2007  to  2009.  The  2010  KIS  is  a 
valuable data set because it provides official performance measures for the environmental innovation of 
Korean  SMEs  for  the  first  time.  The  questions  in  the  2010  KIS  are  based  on  the  2008  Community 
Innovation Survey (CIS) that provides the innovation statuses of European countries every four years. 
The 2010 KIS is suitable for this research because it provides not only various firm characteristics, but 
also surveys the data on environmental innovation and financial performances. The population of the 
2010  KIS  is  41,485  firms  established  before  2007  with  at  least  10  employees  in  the  manufacturing 
industry. This industry is categorized by the Korean Standard Industry Code (KSIC) (10–33). Korean 
manufacturing  SME  defines  as  a  firm  that  should  be  under  300  employees,  smaller  than  70  billion 
Korean won of fixed assets of the business and 8 billion won of annual sales in accordance with the 
Small Business Fundamental Act in Korea. Our sample has 3497 SMEs collected by random sampling 
of the population in the 2010 KIS. Among the samples, there are 1587 missing cases in internal and 
external expenditures and 32 cases are missed from sales data. 222 cases are excluded due to variables 
of business affiliation and listing status. Finally, this study uses 1656 SMEs to examine the moderating 
effect of the environmental innovation on labor productivity by excluding missing values. 

4.2. Measurements 

4.2.1. Labor Productivity 

The dependent variable in this research is labor productivity measured by total sales in 2009 divided 
by the number of employees in that year. Several studies use labor productivity to examine the impact 
of environmental innovation [71,72]. In addition, Cainelli [34] mentions that labor productivity is one 
of the dependent variables to measure for the impact of innovation performance in terms of the increase 
in sales and the reduction of labor. First, when firms meet their customer’s environmental needs by 
providing environmental products or services, then the image or reputation of the firms improves and 
then revenues increase. The environmental efforts of firms can achieve a higher market share and new market 
opportunities. Second, Rennings, Ziegler and Zwick [71] mention that environmental innovation reduces 
the demand for material, energy, and labor in the manufacturing industry. Therefore, environmental 
innovation has a positive association with labor productivity.  

4.2.2. Environmental Innovation 

Several environmental studies have measured environmental innovation as the number of successful 
environmental patents [33,73]. However, Brunnermeier and Cohen [33] mention that using environmental 
patents as a measure of environmental innovation has limitations because the value of the number of 
environmental patents can be different depending on the industry. Further, the impact of environmental 
patents is unclear because of the difficulty in determining whether firms are able to benefit from the 
patents or not. In the 2010 KIS, we are able to clearly identify the environmental benefits from the 
environmental innovation. The questionnaire for environmental innovation asks whether firms implement 
an environmental innovation as a new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, 
organizational  method,  or  marketing  method  to  create  environmental  benefits.  The  environmental 
benefits consist of six answers: (1) reduced material per unit of output; (2) energy use per unit of output; 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
(3) reduced total emission; (4) replaced materials with less polluting or hazardous substitutes; (5) reduced 
soil, water, noise, or air pollution; and (6) recycled waste, water, or materials. The environmental innovation 
as the independent variable is a dummy that equals to one if a firm implements environmental innovation 
for any of these benefits, or zero otherwise.  

7419 

4.2.3. Control Variables 

Several studies argue that age and firm size influence the market-based performance. Sørensen and 
Stuart [74] argue that the results of organizational learning improve corporate performance along with 
aging. The age of the firms is measured by the number of years since inception. Firm size is determined 
by the natural logarithm of the number of employees in 2009, which is consistent with the business 
literature [34,75]. The other control variables of interest are the industry and the R&D expenditure. The 
2010 KIS contains various industries. This study’s industry has 23 sectors based on Version Nine of 
KSIC. We rearrange the industry based on four technology classifications defined by the OECD: low, 
low-medium, high-medium, and high [76]. With respect to the R&D expenditure, the R&D intensity is 
measured by the natural logarithm of the average R&D expenditure divided by the average number of 
employees in the period from 2007 to 2009.  

4.2.4. Interaction Terms 

We use two moderating variables: business-group affiliation and listing status. Business-group affiliation 
refers to a group of legally independent firms that has formal ties, such as the relationship between parent 
and subsidiary firms. We measure business-group affiliation as a dummy variable that equals one if a 
firm  is  one  of  the  members  in  a  business-group  affiliation  and  zero  otherwise.  There  are  two  stock 
exchanges in South Korea, the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) and the Korea Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotation (KOSDAQ) exchange, which is the South Korean version of the NASDAQ. We define listing 
status as listing on KOSDAQ for SMEs and exclude the SMEs listed on KSE because the characteristics 
of each market are different. In addition, the number of listed firms on the KSE is less than ten because 
the SMEs have difficulty listing their stocks because of the strict listing criteria [77]. 

5. Empirical Results 

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients of variables in this study. Standard 
deviation of Labor productivity, SIZE, and AGE are lower than mean, indicating the difference of estimation 
of these variables are relative low.  

Based on the Pearson correlation coefficients, the environmental innovation (r = 0.151, p < 0.01), 
business-group affiliation (r = 0.094, p < 0.01), and the listing status (r = 0.157, p < 0.01) are positively 
and  significantly  associated  with  labor  productivity.  We  find  that  environmental  innovation  as  the 
independent variable has the strongest correlation with labor productivity as the dependent variable in 
our  models.  The  correlation  coefficient  between  the  environmental  innovation  and  business-group 
affiliation  (r  =  0.06,  p  <  0.01)  is  significant,  and  the  environmental  innovation  is  also  significantly 
correlated with listing status (r = 0.09, p < 0.01). This correlation indicates that business-group affiliation 
and listing status play a complementary role in environmental innovation.

We conduct three multivariate regression analyses in Table 2. In Model 1 of Table 2, we include 
independent variables (Environmental Innovation) and control variables (Age, R&D intensity, and Size). 
We add business-group affiliation and listing status to compare with Model 3 in the examination of the 
effect of the interaction terms on the dependent variable in Model 2 of Table 2. We choose a multivariate 
ordinary least squares analysis to examine the relationship between environmental innovation and labor 
productivity  in  SMEs.  In  addition,  to  test  Hypotheses  1  and  2,  we  add  moderating  variables  to  our 
regression: business-group affiliation and listing status. Multicollinearity can be a problem when using 
interaction  terms  in  a  multivariate  regression  analysis  because  of  the  standard  errors  that  lead  to 
misinterpretations of the estimated coefficients [78]. We use mean centering, a method to minimize the 
multicollinearity issues. This method deducts the means of each of the independent variables [79]. We 
then add the interaction terms to Model 3 in Table 2. When we check the multicollinearity  among  the 
variables by evaluating their variance inflation factor (VIF), the values of the VIFs range from 1.216 to 
1.905 in all of the regressed models. Because the VIFs are less than 10, we do not need to consider the 
muliticollinearity issues in our empirical analysis [80]. In order to compute Model 3, the interaction 
terms are added. The following is Model 3 with all of the variables: 

LPROD = β0 + B1EI + β2AGE + β3RDIN + β4SIZE + β5AFFIL + β6LIST + 

β7EI*AFFIL + β8EI*LIST + β9Industry + ε 

(1)

where LPROD is labor productivity measured by sales divided by the number of employees in 2009, 
and EI is the environmental innovation as a dummy variable related to the environmental benefits for 
the firms. The AGE is the number of years from the inception year to 2009. The RDIN is the R&D 
intensity determined by the average R&D expenditure divided by the average number of employees in 
the period of 2007 to 2009. SIZE is the total number of employees in 2009. The AFFIL and LIST are 
dummy variables standing for business-group affiliation (affiliated firm or independent firm) and listing 
status (listed firm on KOSDAQ or non-listing firm). We consider time lag issues between the R&D 
inputs and outputs. The length of the time lag is still not fixed but flexible [81,82]. We use a two-year 
time lag in our models following the period of the 2010 KIS.  

We  assume  that  SME  manufacturers  are  able  to  increase  labor  productivity  by  implementing 
environmental innovation. Model 1 of Table 2 (F = 34.84, p < 0.01) shows that environmental innovation 
is positively and significantly associated with labor productivity (b = 0.119, p < 0.01). In addition, the 
variables in Model 1 explain 13.5% of the variance in labor productivity to calculate the main effect.

The  results  show  that  SMEs  are  likely  to  obtain  labor  productivity  by  achieving  environmental 
innovation. After adding the complementary assets (AFFIL and LIST) of environmental innovation, 
Model 2 of Table 2 (F = 34.67, p < 0.01) explains 15.5% of the variance in the dependent variable. The 
added variables are meaningful because the explanation for Model 2 (15.5%) is higher than the one for 
Model 1 (13.5 %). According to the results in Model 2 of Table 2, we find that the benefits of sharing 
knowledge  and  values  within  a  business  group  have  a  significant  and  positive  influence  on  labor 
productivity (b = 0.329, p < 0.01). In addition, the listing on KOSDAQ positively and significantly 
influences labor productivity (b = 0.291, p < 0.01). For an improvement in labor productivity, the SMEs 
should affiliate with a business group and list on the market as a business strategy.

According to Hypothesis 1, affiliated SMEs in a business group achieve higher labor productivity 
than independent firms by implementing environmental innovation. If the coefficients of the interaction 
terms are significant and the explanation of the variance in the dependent variable increases, the results 
support Hypothesis 1. The results for Model 3 (F = 29.31, p < 0.01) show a positive and slightly significant 
beta  coefficient  for  the  interaction  effect  between  the  environmental  innovation  and  business-group 
affiliation  (b  =  0.264,  p  <  0.1).  This  coefficient  indicates  that  the  business-group  affiliation  as  a 
complementary factor helps the SMEs increase labor productivity through environmental innovation. 
Model 3 of Table 2 also shows that listing status (b = 0.258, p < 0.01) positively and significantly 
moderates the relationship between environmental innovation and labor productivity. The SMEs are able 
to conceive that listing on the market is an environmental strategy for sustainable development. The 
significance of the interaction terms is further explained by an increase in the unadjusted coefficient of 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
determination (R squared) from 0.159 in Model 2 to 0.164 in Model 3 (p < 0.01). Model 3 explains  
15.8% of the overall variance in the labor productivity. Therefore, Model 3 is the best fitting model 
among the three models, and the results support Hypotheses 1 and 2.

Figures  1  and  2  visualize  the  impact  of  complementary  assets  on  the  relationship  between 
environmental innovation and labor productivity by using a simple slope analysis. The graphs of these 
figures clearly show the result of model 3 in Table 2. The moderating impact of listing is slightly higher 
than the impact of business affiliation.

This paper implements additional multivariate regressions to compare the impact of environmental 
innovation on labor productivity in different groups. First, Table 3 shows the result of multiple regressions, 
which examine the relationship between environmental innovation and labor productivity in affiliated 
and non-affiliated firms. To test for the significance of slope difference between two groups, analysis of 
simple slope difference is used in this model. The t-value of the analysis is the following [83]: 

t=

6. Discussion 

6.1. Research Implication 

7424 

We  examine  the  relationship  between  environmental  innovation  and  labor  productivity  within  
SME manufacturers. We also introduce the impact of the business-group affiliation and the listing status 
on the labor productivity as an independent variable and a moderator. For SMEs, the literature has not 
examined this relationship and its complementary assets as interaction terms. The multivariate regression 
analysis shows that SME manufacturers are able to increase their labor productivity by implementing 
environmental innovation in Model 1 of Table 2. Previously, the literature focused on the relationship 
between the environmental innovation and the corporate performance in large firms because there were 
few  data  sets  to  examine  the  environmental  innovation  performance  of  SMEs,  and  the  SMEs  were 
restricted from implementing successful environmental innovation because of their lack of financial and 
educational resources. In spite of these limitations, this study on environmental innovation in SMEs is 
necessary because SMEs have generated a large amount of industrial waste and have been responsible for 
significant and negative environmental impacts [1,7]. In addition, SMEs have overcome these limitations 
to implement environmental innovation by networking with internal and external partners [84]. Our 
results confirm the research and contribute to the literature that environmental innovation can be an 
important business strategy to achieve higher labor productivity in SMEs.  

In Model 2 of Table 2, the business-group affiliation plays a significant role for SME manufacturers 
to increase labor productivity. The business-group affiliation has two perspectives: costs and benefits. 
With respect to costs, the business groups have the possibility to inefficiently transfer resources from the 
highly performing firms to the poorly performing affiliates. This transfer means that profitable firms 
have to abandon their investment opportunities for other affiliates [85]. Furthermore, the exploitation of 
minority shareholders, such as the tunneling of resources, also occurs among business groups [86]. However, 
affiliates in a business group can minimize the transaction costs in an inefficient market if they have 
efficient economic organizations [24]. South Korean affiliated firms share resources, such as technology 
skills and advertising, and have an interactive transaction with complex structures of cross-subsidization 
and  vertical  integration  [87].  Our  results  are  consistent  with  the  benefit  side  of  the  business-group 
affiliation and suggest that SMEs should affiliate with business groups. 

Regarding  Hypothesis  1,  the  results  of  this  study  show  that  the  affiliation  with  a  business  group 
significantly  and  positively  moderates  the  relationship  between  environmental  innovation  and  labor 
productivity. In other words, the affiliated SMEs increase the outcomes of the environmental innovation. 
Therefore, the affiliation can be an efficient environmental strategy to increase the corporate performance of 
SMEs. To be specific, the affiliated SMEs take advantage of the business groups such as sharing resources 
and external investments to develop their environmental innovation. With respect to Hypothesis 2, the 
impact of environmental innovation on labor productivity is significantly changed by the firm’s listing 
status. This impact indicates that the listing status is a critical moderator between environmental innovation 
and labor productivity. Our results show that listed SMEs on KOSDAQ achieve higher performance 
from their environmental innovation. In order to gain more investment from external stakeholders, SMEs 
should advertise their environmental efforts to customers who are interested in green products and service 
because of their difficulty in informing customers of the necessity for environmental practices [58]. 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
Therefore, the findings of our study empirically support the previous research by using a multivariate 
regression with interaction terms. 

7425 

This  paper  contributes  to  environmental  research because  a  large  amount  of  studies  have  mainly 
focused on the efficiency of the environmental regulation and the environmental management for large 
firms, even though the impact of SMEs on the environment has increased [17,88,89]. Our results show 
that SMEs are able to increase labor productivity by implementing environmental practices in spite of 
various obstacles such as the burden of additional cost and the shortage of capabilities for environmental 
innovation. For SMEs, this study of the moderating effect of the business-group affiliation and the listing 
status is the first empirical study in regard to the relationship between environmental innovation and 
labor  productivity  in  the  business  research.  This  is  then  unlike  the  studies  that  mostly  analyze  the 
determinants and actors for SMEs to adopt environmental management or technology [7]. In terms of 
the theoretical contribution, we support the NRBV to find the significant impact of environmental innovation 
on labor productivity. Therefore, our study is an extension of Maas, et al. [90] who applied the theory to 
a specific industry: German third-party logistics providers. In other words, SMEs should apply their 
environmental activities to the business strategy of sustainability and competitive advantage. In addition, 
the results contribute to the organization research that examines the impact of Korean business groups 
on labor productivity. In Korean business groups, affiliations have a unique relational structure, which 
includes  both  perspectives  of  vertical  integration  and  conglomerates  typified  through  the  system  of 
chaebols that has a considerable impact on economic performance [24]. 

6.2. Managerial Implications 

Besides these contributions, we provide some implications for SMEs managers. As we mentioned in 
the literature review, there is still discussion on whether environmental innovation leads to corporate 
performance. Reinhardt [58] mentions that the answer cannot generally be found because the question 
relates to the benefits of environmental activities. However, our results support the positive perspective 
of environmental innovation and suggest that managers of SMEs consider environmental innovation  
as a business strategy to meet the requirements of shareholders through higher labor productivity and 
environmental regulations. Managers of independent firms among the emerging SMEs, which have a 
competitive advantage with fast growth in domestic and international markets, should consider affiliations 
with business groups for advantages such as the sharing of resources and risks or for sustainable development 
by using several methods such as M&A and corporate divestiture [87,91]. In addition, managers could 
benefit from disclosing their environmental efforts after listing on the market because more external investors 
are likely to evaluate their environmental performance and a good image or reputation of implementing 
environmental innovation can improve performance.  

Our results also find implications for policy makers. Policy makers effectively should support SMEs 
in increasing their environmental performance because the existing regulations might be a burden [7]. 
They  should  then  establish  appropriate  regulation  in  which  not  only  SMEs  but  also  supply  chain 
members can fulfill the requirements of the regulation without any financial burdens in order to create 
environmental  value  from  the  environmental  innovation.  For  balanced  development  between  large 
companies and SMEs, policy makers need to assist SMEs with various methods because most SMEs 
still lack resources, the capability to adopt a new technology, and the ability to establish new networks 

 


Sustainability 2014, 6 
 
to implement environmental activities. In addition, the government needs to provide sustainable support 
for independent SMEs until they can survive without the resource sharing from business-group affiliations 
and Initial public offerings (IPOs). Listed SMEs as well as non-listed SMEs selectively disclose their 
environmental  performances  and  have  different  accounting  measurements  of  their  environmental 
performance [92]. Therefore, policy makers need to establish environmental disclosure standards to help 
customers and stakeholders compare firms’ environmental performance and increase the transparency 
of the environmental disclosure. 

7426 

6.3. Limitations 

Our  models  in  this  study  have  several  limitations.  Even  though  our  results  show  the  impact  of 
environmental innovation on labor productivity in SMEs and the interaction effects from the business-group 
affiliation and the listing status, it is necessary to examine the green supply chain to better understand 
the environmental practices and suggest efficient environmental regulations. In addition, the outcomes 
of the environmental performance might be different depending on different countries. Future study should 
compare the environmental performance and the green supply chain at national levels. We are limited to 
the financial data in the KIS 2010. Future study could use short- and long-term performance variables 
as dependent variables by using the Korean Investor Service Value that is a reliable data set mainly used 
in financial research. Even though there is no unexpected fluctuation in the labor productivity caused by 
the financial crisis in the period of 2007 to 2009, future study can control the impact of the crisis in order 
to examine more precisely the empirical research with panel data sets. 

7. Conclusions 

This  study  shows  the  relationship  among  environmental  innovation,  labor  productivity,  and 
complementary assets in Korean SMEs. One of the conclusions from the results is that Korean SMEs 
implement  environmental  innovation  to  increase  labor  productivity.  This  outcome  is  supported  by 
NRBV that environmental activities of firms become the center of their competitiveness for sustainable 
development.  Second,  SMEs  can  take  an  advantage  of  business-group  affiliation  for  increasing 
environmental performance. Based on RBV, SMEs are able to obtain valuable tangible and intangible 
asset from their affiliation for environmental activities more than independent firms and increase their 
performance.  The  last  major  conclusion  is  that  listing  status  significantly  and  positively  influences 
environmental innovation-labor productivity relationship. According to stakeholder theory, firms should 
meet needs of their stakeholders including environmental activities as CSR. Listed firms make an effort 
to implement environmental innovation more than non-listed ones because they should disclose their 
financial  and  social  activities.  They  satisfy  stakeholders  who  prefer  to  implement  environmental 
activities and receive investment and high reputation related to green growth. These conclusions confirm 
the  positive  relationship  between  environmental  innovation  and  performance  in  Korean  SMEs  and 
suggest that the environmental strategy is needed to achieve a success of environmental innovation with 
complementary assets.
