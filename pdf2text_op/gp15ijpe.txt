Two important strands of research within the literature on Environmental Operations Management
(EOM) relate to environmental approach and performance. Often in this research the links between
environmental approach, environmental performance and EOM are considered separately with little
consideration given to the interrelationships between them. This study develops and tests a theoretical
framework that combines these two strands to explore how UK food manufacturers approach EOM. The
framework considers the relationships between an environmentally pro-active strategic orientation,
EOM and environmental and cost performance. A cross-sectional survey was developed to collect data
from a sample of 1200 food manufacturing ﬁrms located within the UK. Responses were sought from
production and operations managers who are knowledgeable about the environmental operations
practices within their ﬁrms. A total of 149 complete and useable responses were obtained. The reliability
and validity of the scales used in the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis, prior to the
testing of the hypotheses underpinning the theoretical framework using hierarchical regression analysis.
Our results generate support for a link between environmental proactivity, environmental practices and
performance, consistent with the natural resource-based view (NRBV) and a number of studies in the
extant literature. In considering environmental proactivity as a standalone concept that inﬂuences the
implementation of environmental practices outlined in the NRBV, our study generates some novel
insights into these links. Further our results provide some interesting insights for managers within the
food industry who can identify the potential beneﬁts of certain practices for performance within this
unique context.

Introduction

As environmental concerns have grown in recent years, ﬁrms
have directed increasing attention to the environmental impact of
their operations (Hofer et al., 2012). Research interest in environ-
mental issues at the operations level of ﬁrms is at an all-time high
with numerous studies investigating various different aspects of
this development (Montabon et al., 2007; Schoenherr, 2012;
Thoumy and Vachon, 2012). Two particularly prominent themes
that have emerged from this research are the environmental
orientation of ﬁrms and the performance outcomes that can arise
from environmental management (Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De
Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014). To date these themes have often been
explored relatively independently from each other, yet it is of
interest to consider the potential
links between the two as

intuitively it is not unreasonable to assume that orientation will
have an impact on performance outcomes. More speciﬁcally, it
would be interesting to explore the question of whether ﬁrms that
implement pro-active environmental practices capture better
performance beneﬁts than ﬁrms who are more reactive and lim-
ited in their approach to environmental management (Hart, 1995;
Hart and Dowell, 2011). The purpose of this study is to explore the
link between a pro-active environmental orientation, which is
normally reﬂected in the type of environmental practices that are
pursued, and organisational performance.

Important work has already been done on environmental
orientation and the performance outcomes associated with pur-
suing environmental strategies. The matter of environmental
orientation has been addressed in a number of studies (Henriques
and Sadorsky, 1999; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Humphreys et al.,
2003; Sharma and Henriques, 2005; Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De
Burgos-Jimenez et al., 2014; Lo, 2014). Two of the most prominent
orientations outlined in the literature are reactive and pro-active

147

orientations. A reactive response is indicative of a short-term,
compliance-based view, which regards environmental manage-
ment as a burden requiring minimal investment (Akin-Ates et al.,
2012; Lo, 2014). In contrast, a pro-active response occurs when
ﬁrms have a desire to go beyond compliance in the hope (in most
cases) of securing added value and other beneﬁts (Garces-Ayerbe
et al., 2012; Lo, 2014; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014). The potential
beneﬁts of a pro-active orientation are becoming increasingly
evident (Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014), yet
the research assessing its links with performance has not been
systematic.

Moreover, studies on the link between environmental activity
and organisational performance generate mixed results (Hart and
Ahuja, 1996; Rao and Holt, 2005; Montabon et al., 2007; Paulraj
and de Jong, 2011; De Giovanni, 2012; Dam and Petkova, 2014).
This suggests that a link between a ﬁrm's orientation toward
environmental management and organisational performance
requires further in-depth investigation and represents an impor-
tant research gap in the extant literature. One potential explana-
tion for the inconclusive results is that different organisational
practices, procedures and policies inﬂuence the relationship
between orientation and performance. For example, some studies
focus on speciﬁc operational practices such as waste and emission
reduction, recycling and remanufacturing (Hart and Ahuja, 1996;
Sroufe, 2003; Montabon et al., 2007); others include practices
related to the environmentally conscious design of products
(Zailani et al., 2012); while others still focus on the links between
environmental management systems and performance (Darnall
et al., 2008). There is also variation in the level at which practices
are assessed. Some studies consider only internal organisational
practices (Sroufe, 2003; Montabon et al., 2007), whereas, others,
concentrate on supply chain practices (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;
Vachon and Klassen 2008; Green et al., 2012; Dam and Petkova,
2014). Assessment of a diverse range of practices within different
organisational contexts invariably increases the likelihood of
uncertainty over the link between environmental practices and
performance as it is often the case that certain practices are linked
while others are not. As highlighted by Vachon and Klassen
(2008), a large part of the reason why studies focus on different
practices is the absence of agreed frameworks to guide the
research (Iwata and Okada, 2011; Beske et al., 2014). To counteract
this shortcoming, this study develops a theoretical framework,
grounded in the Natural Resource-Based view (NRBV) to link
together the dimensions of environmental proactivity, practices
and performance.

The main objective of this study is to contribute to the on-going
discussions regarding environmental orientation and performance
(Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014). The study
makes four important contributions. First, it considers how a pro-
active environmental orientation might translate into operational
practices. In doing so, it builds upon an earlier study by Bowen et al.
(2001) that tests the link between proactivity and environmental
practices with suppliers and calls for further studies to examine
practices at other stages of the supply chain. Second, treating envir-
onmental proactivity as a stand-alone concept as opposed to a subset
of wider environmental practices or strategies (Buysse and Verbeke,
2003; Lopez-Gamero et al., 2009; Sarkis et al., 2010) is novel as
it delineates between the concepts of proactivity, practices and
performance when exploring their interrelationships (De Burgos-
Jimenez et al., 2014). Third, employing a theoretical framework better
positions the study to investigate the link between practices and
performance. Finally, the study deepens understanding of environ-
mental management in the context of the food industry, which faces
unique and complex environmental challenges (Maloni and Brown,
2006; Li et al., 2014).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature
on the natural resource-based view to develop a set of hypotheses to
explore the link between the environmental orientation of ﬁrms and
organisational performance. Following this, Section 3 provides an
explanation of the research methods employed by the study. Then,
Section 4 presents and discusses the results from the multiple
regression analysis. Section 5 concludes the study with a summary
of the key ﬁndings and a discussion of their importance to the
environmental operations management literature.

2. Literature review and hypothesis development

The Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV) has emerged upon
recognition that the Resource-Based View (RBV) does not take full
account for the impact of the natural environment on business (Hart,
1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011). The core argument of the NRBV is that
strategy and competitive advantage will be ‘rooted in capabilities that
facilitate environmentally sustainable economic activity’ (Hart, 1995:
991). It emphasises that ﬁrms can capture competitive advantage if
pro-active consideration is given to the natural environment when
designing and operating production processes (Hart and Dowell,
2011; Thoumy and Vachon, 2012; Wong et al., 2012): the NRBV
suggests that using particular sets of practices consistent with a pro-
active approach to environmental management can enhance orga-
nisational performance (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011; Wong et
al., 2012). In its original form, the NRBV focussed on three broad
groupings of practices; pollution prevention, product stewardship
and sustainable development (Hart, 1995). Pollution prevention
represents environmental efforts at the internal operations level
while, product stewardship moves beyond this to the supply chain
level as environmental impact of a product's life cycle is considered.
This requires a level of engagement with the external stakeholders
involved in the production process such as suppliers and customers
(Hart, 1995). Sustainable development moves further beyond this by
seeking to engage with a broader range of external stakeholders
such as competitors or governments who are not directly involved in
the production process. This level of external engagement enables
them to shape legislation and become environmental leaders within
their industry (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011). Subsequent
development of the NRBV framework has led to a breakdown of the
concept of sustainable development into two further categories,
namely, clean technology and bottom of the pyramid practices (Hart
and Dowell, 2011). This breakdown reﬂects the different research
directions taken with regard to sustainable development since the
introduction of the NRBV and encourages more focussed research
attention. To date, sustainable development has received limited
research attention in comparison to pollution prevention and pro-
duct stewardship (Hart and Dowell, 2011).

Within the extant literature, some empirical studies consider
the antecedents of pro-active environmental approaches (Buysse
and Verbeke, 2003), others concentrate on the facilitators of
environmental approaches (Chan, 2005) and yet others investigate
the link between environmental approaches and performance
(Christmann, 2000; Vachon and Klassen, 2008). Because these
studies mostly explore narrow features of the NRBV in isolation,
few reliable conclusions can be drawn from their ﬁndings about
the complex inter-relationships between environmental proactiv-
ity and organisational performance (Chan, 2005). Recent studies
have sought to shed more light on the saliency of the NRBV by
examining the interdependent links between proactivity, practices
(activities) and performance (Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-
Jiminez et al., 2014).

Building upon the NRBV and recent research in this area, we
develop and empirically test a framework that explores the
interrelationships between proactivity, practices and performance

(see Fig. 1). Our framework is consistent with the NRBV's key
proposition that proactive environmental efforts may lead to
sources of competitive advantage. Two key dimensions of the
NRBV are assessed in the framework, namely, pollution prevention
and process stewardship. Sustainable development is not con-
sidered in this study as more research is needed to assess how it
translates into practice and the extent to which ﬁrms are pursuing
this level of external stakeholder engagement (Hart and Dowell,
2011). Further, the dimensions of pollution prevention and stew-
ardship are considered to capture environmental practices at the
operations and supply chain levels, consistent with the objectives
of this study. As we are seeking to assess environmental efforts of
typical manufacturing ﬁrms as opposed to environmental leaders,
consideration of efforts in relation to sustainable development is
beyond the scope of this study.

From a theoretical perspective the framework addresses two key
areas in relation to the NRBV. First, the inﬂuence of a pro-active
environmental orientation on pollution prevention and process stew-
ardship is assessed, followed by examination of links with organisa-
tional performance (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011). The variables
included in the framework were selected based on their prominence in
the extant literature as well as their relevance to the NRBV.

2.1. Environmental proactivity

Pro-active and reactive approaches to environmental manage-
ment are often seen as distinct from each other (Buysse and Ver-
beke, 2003). One distinction relates to the timing of response to
environmental issues. The former approach involves pre-planned
preventative action with the objective of avoiding negative
environmental impact where possible, while the latter approach is
more post-hoc in the sense that a response is often triggered as a
result of an undesired environmental impact that has to be man-
aged and controlled (Zailani et al., 2012). Proactivity involves a
dimension of intentionality whereby active engagement with the
environment is pursued on an on-going basis in order to minimise
and avoid the occurrence of undesired outcomes. Deﬁned as “a
tendency to go further than complying with legislation or the
industry standard” (Garces-Ayerbe et al., 2012: 190), the concept of
environmental proactivity is prominent within the literature on
environmental management (Bowen et al., 2001; Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003; Sharma et al., 2007; Jeffers, 2010; Akin-Ates et al.,
2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014). So far, studies mostly
explore the antecedents and outcomes of environmental proac-
tivity. With regard to antecedents, stakeholder pressure (Henri-
ques and Sadorsky, 1999; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Garces-
Ayerbe et al., 2012), ﬁrm size (Darnall et al., 2010), resources and
capabilities (Sharma et al., 2007), conditions in the external
environment (Murillo-Luna et al., 2011) and perceived value
(Garces-Ayerbe et al., 2012) are highlighted as
important.
Regarding outcomes, studies assessing its link with ﬁnancial per-
formance indicate the potential for a pro-active response con-
tributing to the bottom line (Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-

Benito, 2005; Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al.,
2014). However, the relationship between environmental proac-
tivity, pollution prevention and process stewardship has yet to be
investigated empirically and represents an important gap in the
extant literature.

2.1.1. Environmental proactivity and pollution prevention

improvement basis

A link between proactivity and pollution prevention is suggested
in the NRBV as this approach is viewed as a ‘beyond compliance’
response to environmental concerns (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell,
2011). Pollution prevention is normally seen as an approach that
ﬁrms use internally to reduce levels of waste or emissions on a
continuous
(Buysse and Verbeke, 2003;
Michalisin and Stinchﬁeld, 2010). It seeks to optimise resource
consumption and prevent waste and emissions consistent with the
ﬁnancial targets of the ﬁrm (Dias-Sardinha and Reijnders, 2001).
The aim of pollution prevention is to eliminate pollution at its
source in the production process (Thoumy and Vachon, 2012;
Hoque and Clarke, 2013). This is usually done through modifying
products and processes as well as encouraging the use of non-toxic
or less toxic substances in production (Munguia et al., 2010;
Schoenherr, 2012). Its focus on prevention assumes a degree of
proactivity which sets it apart from more traditional end-of-pipe
solutions that tend to deal with pollution problems after they have
occurred (Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-Benito, 2005; Munguia et
al., 2010). While the concepts of proactivity and pollution preven-
tion have been linked within the literature (Hart, 1995; Russo and
Fouts, 1997; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Murillo-Luna et al., 2011),
these links appear to be mostly conceptual. In particular, we are not
aware of any studies that have empirically tested for a direct link
between a pro-active environmental orientation and pollution
prevention. Addressing this research gap in the literature is
important, but to do so requires the concept of pollution prevention
to be broken down into more speciﬁc and measurable practices.
Only then will it be feasible to assess its link with proactivity.
Unpacking pollution prevention into waste and emissions practices
is a useful way to proceed given that these are the main constituent
parts of pollution prevention (Hart, 1995, 1997; Michalisin and
Stinchﬁeld, 2010).

Waste and energy emissions are highlighted as key sources of
pollution within the literature on environmental management
(Bansal, 2002; Sroufe, 2003; Montabon et al., 2007; Tate et al.,
2010). A ﬁrm's orientation to the environment will inﬂuence their
response to the problem of pollution. For example, a reactive
orientation may lead to compliance-based pollution control prac-
tices, which normally focus on the short term goal of keeping
pollution levels at a predetermined limit: no real effort is made to
improve pollution levels beyond what is required. In contrast, the
pre-planned actions associated with a pollution prevention
approach will in most cases require some degree of proactivity on
the part of the ﬁrm. The NRBV encourages pro-active engagement
with the environment and suggests that it can be expressed
through different practices, many of which fall into the category of

149

pollution prevention such as energy reduction and waste reduc-
tion (Montabon et al., 2007; Tate et al., 2010). Thus, the following
hypotheses are developed;

Hypothesis 1a. : Environmental proactivity has a positive inﬂuence
on energy reduction practices.

Hypothesis 1b. : Environmental proactivity has a positive inﬂuence
on waste reduction practices.

2.1.2. Environmental proactivity and process stewardship

The NRBV suggests that ﬁrms can extend their internal pollu-
tion prevention efforts beyond their organisational boundaries by
working with other actors in the supply chain (Vachon and Klas-
sen, 2008; Hart and Dowell, 2011). Stewardship is the term used to
capture these efforts (Wong et al., 2012). Firms adopting a stew-
ardship approach express a long term commitment to the envir-
onment through pursuing environmental efforts across the supply
chain (Hart, 1995). Stewardship activities can be applied either to a
product being developed (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011) or
the process through which it is developed (Wong et al., 2012). As
the environmental impact of the production process is the main
focus of this study, we are solely concerned with process stew-
ardship. Process
stewardship represents a process-oriented
environmental approach that seeks to reduce negative environ-
mental impacts arising from operating activities across all stages of
the supply chain (Wong et al., 2012). To be effective, it requires all
actors and ﬁrms across the supply chain involved in the produc-
tion process to be aligned in their endeavours to improve envir-
onmental sustainability (Mena et al., 2014). Responsibility for
securing supply chain integration or alignment to advance process
stewardship normally falls on the lead ﬁrm. It usually seeks to do
so in one of two ways. One option is to follow a risk minimisation
approach and monitor suppliers and customers. This involves
setting standards and monitoring the extent to which they are
adhered to across the supply chain (Vachon and Klassen, 2006). An
alternative approach is to develop collaborative relationships with
supply chain partners and actively engage in joint problem solving
activities (Vachon and Klassen, 2008).

Thus, collaboration implies actors working together for mutual
gain in the absence of control mechanisms (Squire et al., 2009).
Fostering cooperation of this type requires information sharing
and communication among the parties as well as a clear under-
standing of the respective responsibilities and capabilities of each
party (Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Blome et al., 2014; Grekova et
al., 2014). Customers and suppliers normally commit to colla-
borative arrangements because they perceive potential gains such
as, risk sharing, access to complementary resources, reduced
transaction costs and improved competitive advantage (Cao and
Zhang, 2011). Previous studies of supply chain environmental
collaboration highlight the potential for such beneﬁts to be cap-
tured (Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Hollos et al., 2012; Blome et al.,
2014).

Supplier environmental collaboration represents the input
stage of the process stewardship approach. Ensuring that compo-
nents and materials used in the production process meet more
stringent environmental requirements has become more impor-
tant as lead ﬁrms are being held increasingly accountable for
environmentally irresponsible behaviour of other actors in their
supply chain (Rao and Holt, 2005; Christopher, 2010; Hoejmose
et al., 2013, Lo, 2014). Thus, it is important for ﬁrms to consider the
environmental impact of processes upstream in their supply chain.
Environmental collaboration can also take place with customers
downstream in the supply chain (Vachon and Klassen, 2008;
Blome et al., 2014). For example, if products need to be disposed of
in a speciﬁc way it is important for a ﬁrm and its customers work

together to ensure that all relevant information is shared (Blome
et al., 2014).

All in all, supply chain collaboration is highly complex, requir-
ing strategy alignment among the involved parties (Vachon et al.,
2009). In developing such an approach, a pro-active orientation is
important (Hart, 1995; Bowen et al., 2001; Pagell and Wu, 2009).
However, research on the drivers of environmental collaboration
has been limited to date (de Leeuw and Fransoo, 2009). In spite of
this, it can be reasonably assumed that this alignment does not
emerge spontaneously, but rather requires commitment and
planned coordinated action with regard to environmental man-
agement. Thus, the following hypotheses are developed;

H2a. : Environmental proactivity has a positive inﬂuence on envir-
onmental collaboration with suppliers.

H2b. :Environmental proactivity has a positive inﬂuence on envir-
onmental collaboration with customers.

2.2. The link between environmental practices and organisational
performance

In order to assess the merits of a pro-active approach to
environmental management it is important to examine organisa-
tional performance across environmental and operational dimen-
sions. This enables exploration of the extent to which these
practices lead to positive outcomes that might contribute to
competitive advantage as proposed in the NRBV (Hart, 1995).
Environmental performance can be viewed as the extent to which
ﬁrms achieve the objectives set for environmental management
efforts (De Burgos-Jimenez et al., 2014). Cost performance is a
commonly used measure of operational performance and has been
considered alongside environmental performance in a number of
studies on environmental management (Rao and Holt, 2005;
Vachon and Klassen, 2008). Improving cost performance is a key
objective for most operations and is considered as the second key
performance dimension within this study. The potential for pol-
lution prevention and process stewardship to enhance both
environmental and operational performance is noted within the
literature (Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Christmann, 2000;
King and Lenox, 2001; Paulraj and de Jong, 2011; Giminez and
Tachizawa, 2012; Kaipia et al., 2013). Environmental performance
improvements can derive from the more effective utilisation of
resources and improved efﬁciency associated with pollution pre-
vention and process stewardship practices (Rao and Holt, 2005).
Cost improvements can also emerge as a result of greater efﬁ-
ciency and reduction of waste and emissions (Rao and Holt, 2005).
Beneﬁts such as improved environmental and cost performance
are a key incentive for many ﬁrms in adopting environmental
practices (Bowen et al., 2001).

2.2.1. Pollution prevention and organisational performance

A number of studies suggest that ﬁrms adopting a pollution
prevention approach are likely to experience environmental and
operational beneﬁts (King and Lenox, 2001; Wong et al., 2012).
The concept of pollution prevention outlined in the NRBV
encompasses a broad range of internal environmental practices
and could be operationalised in different ways (Hart, 1995; Hart
and Dowell, 2011). Empirical support for a link between internal
environmental practices aimed at pollution prevention and
dimensions of organisational performance has been provided by a
number of studies (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004; Paulraj and de Jong,
2011; De Giovani, 2012; Giminez et al., 2012). Improvements in
environmental performance derive from internal efforts to reduce
negative environmental impacts within the production process
(Rao and Holt, 2005). Pollution can be viewed as a form of waste,


150

S. Graham, A. Potter / Int. J. Production Economics 170 (2015) 146–159

indicating inefﬁciency within the production process. Thus,
attempts to reduce pollution should generate not only environ-
mental improvements but also enhance efﬁciency in the produc-
tion process (da Silva and de Medeiros, 2004). Creating a more
efﬁcient process through pollution prevention has the potential to
both improve environmental performance and reduce production
costs substantially (Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Rao and Holt, 2005;
Porter and Kramer, 2006). The suggestion that the adoption of
pollution prevention, even at a basic level, may lead to environ-
mental and economic beneﬁts indicates that it may be beneﬁcial
for ﬁrms to implement energy and waste reduction practices
(Grifﬁth and Bhutto, 2009). Thus, the following hypotheses are
developed;

through their own internal environmental activities, thus boosting
efforts at improving supply chain environmental performance
(Green et al., 2012). As a result, environmental concerns can be
addressed and minimised at the source upstream in the supply
chain, alleviating negative effects throughout the production pro-
cess. Moreover, if collaborative efforts with suppliers lead to more
efﬁcient processes, further gains can be captured, particularly in
terms of cost reductions. Some studies emphasize this link between
environmental collaboration with suppliers and improvements in
environmental and cost performance (Geffen and Rothenberg,
2000; Klassen and Vachon, 2003; Rao and Holt, 2005; Vachon and
Klassen, 2008; Paulraj, 2011; Wong et al., 2012). Thus, the following
hypotheses are developed;

H3a. : Energy reduction practices are positively associated with
environmental performance.

H4a. Supplier environmental collaboration is positively associated
with environmental performance.

H3b:. Waste reduction practices are positively associated with
environmental performance.

H4b. Supplier environmental collaboration is positively associated
with cost performance.

H3c:. Energy reduction practices are positively associated with cost
performance.

H3d:. Waste reduction practices are positively associated with cost
performance.

2.2.2. Process stewardship and organisational performance

The beneﬁts that can arise from a process stewardship
approach have been suggested conceptually (Hart, 1995), but
empirical research on this claim is still underdeveloped (Hart and
Dowell, 2011). Some studies on environmental management con-
sider the relationship between certain supply chain environmental
practices and organisational performance (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;
Vachon and Klassen, 2008). While process stewardship practices
are not explicitly explored, these existing studies generate some
insight into the relationship between environmental practices and
performance outcomes at the supply chain level. Of these studies,
a number provide empirical support for a positive relationship
between various environmental supply chain practices and orga-
nisational performance (Rao and Holt, 2005; Vachon and Klassen,
2008; Giminez et al., 2012). As far as we are aware, only one study
appears explicitly to assess the link between process stewardship
and organisational performance (Wong et al., 2012). This study by
Wong et al. (2012) provides some preliminary empirical support
for a positive relationship between process stewardship and
environmental and cost performance.

We consider process stewardship to consist of both supplier
and customer collaboration, which together are considered as the
crystallization of pro-active efforts to improve environmental
performance. This view is consistent with the emphasis placed by
the NRBV on integrating multiple stakeholders involved in the
process with regard to environmental management efforts (Hart,
1995). Thus, it is appropriate to consider suppliers and customers
as key actors in environmental management efforts. Relational
resources are particularly important facilitators of environmental
collaboration and the degree to which these are aligned and used
effectively can lead to favourable performance outcomes (Vachon
and Klassen, 2008; Blome et al., 2014). Empirical evidence sug-
gests that collaborative practices are more effective in improving
the triple bottom line than monitoring and assessment practices
(Giminez et al., 2012; Giminez and Tachizawa, 2012).

A number of empirical studies identify improvements in envir-
onmental performance resulting from collaborative environmental
activities between lead ﬁrms and suppliers (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;
Rao and Holt, 2005; Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Green et al., 2012;
Blome et al., 2014). Firms working together with suppliers to tackle
environmental concerns can share skills and capabilities developed

Collaboration with customers is another supply chain practice
linked to improved organisational performance (Elofson and
Robinson, 2007; Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Cannella and Cianci-
mino, 2010). Increasingly, ﬁrms are fostering collaboration with
customers in response to environmental challenges (Beamon,
2008). The aim is to develop joint solutions to the environmental
problems faced by both parties (Vachon and Klassen, 2008).
Environmental challenges at the customer side of the supply chain
may relate to transport and distribution or recovery and disposal
of waste (Webster and Mitra, 2007; Zailani et al., 2012).
In
response to these challenges some ﬁrms work with their custo-
mers to develop environmentally responsible transport and dis-
tribution systems (Goldsby and Stank, 2000; Preuss, 2005; Hall-
dorsson et al., 2009). Within the broader supply chain literature,
the practice of customer collaboration is linked to a number of
operational beneﬁts (Devaraj et al., 2007; Cao and Zhang, 2011).
While studies on the link between customer environmental col-
laboration and performance are fairly limited, the empirical results
that exist suggest that similar beneﬁts can be obtained in the
context of environmental management (Hollos et al., 2012; Blome
et al., 2014). Thus, the following hypotheses are developed;

H4c. Customer environmental collaboration is positively associated
with environmental performance.

H4d. Customer environmental collaboration is positively associated
with cost performance.

3. Research design

3.1. Sample frame

A survey of the food industry in the United Kingdom was used
to gather the data for this study. A focused, single-industry
approach was considered appropriate as it enabled the control of
industry speciﬁc factors that might inﬂuence results (Vachon and
Klassen, 2008). Environmental pressures and responses in the food
industry have been considered unique, making it an interesting
business context for the study (Mattas and Tsakiridou, 2010;
Mahalik and Nambiar, 2010). A survey instrument as well as a
semi-structured interview schedule for managers in food produ-
cing ﬁrms were developed to collect data for the study. A total of
six semi-structured interviews were conducted with environ-
mental and operations managers in order to develop and reﬁne
the survey questionnaire. Once completed, the survey instrument
was subjected to pilot tests with a further six managers and six
senior academics to ensure quality (Fowler, 1993; Diamantopoulos


S. Graham, A. Potter / Int. J. Production Economics 170 (2015) 146–159

151

et al., 1994; Drucker, 2005). A number of revisions were made to
the survey as a result of this process.

A sample of 1200 food processing ﬁrms with a minimum of 50
employees was compiled from a data set purchased from William
Reed media. All of the ﬁrms included in the sample operate within
the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) DA 15 that covers the food
industry in the UK, including the manufacture of food products and
beverages. Dillman's (2007) tailored design method was adhered to
in the design and distribution of the questionnaire. The survey was
sent out in three waves with follow up phone calls to encourage
responses (Forza, 2002). A total of 149 responses were received
generating a response rate of 12.4%, consistent with other studies in
the area (e.g. Melnyk et al., 2003; Darnall et al., 2008; Paulraj, 2011).
Standard statistical tests for response bias were conducted to
ensure the quality of the data prior to analysis. First, a bivariate
correlation comparing responses to the ﬁrst mailing with responses
to the second and third mailings was conducted to test for non-
response bias (Armstrong and Overton, 1977; Etter and Perneger,
1997). Following this, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess
for signiﬁcant variations in responses across different sub-industry
groups and respondent job titles. The results suggest that response
bias is not a concern for the data. Further, to ensure that respon-
dents were knowledgeable about environmental practices in the
production process, a question on their level of knowledge was
included at the end of the survey. An average knowledge score of
84.2% generates conﬁdence that the responding managers were
knowledgeable about the issues under investigation.

A seven point Likert scale anchored from either “strongly
agree” to “strongly disagree” or “not at all” to “a very great extent”
was used to assess the responses to each of the questions. Further
details of all the measures used are available in the Appendix.

Environmental proactivity—is measured using a ﬁve-item scale
developed by Bowen et al. (2001). This measure focuses on the extent
to which environmental concerns are given a high priority by the
management of responding ﬁrms, the extent to which they go beyond
compliance, lead their industry and manage environmental risks.

Pollution prevention—two new scales

comprising energy
reduction and waste reduction were developed to measure this
concept. These were informed by studies on environmental man-
agement in a food industry context (Maloni and Brown, 2006;
Pullman et al., 2009) as well as online information from the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and
the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). Together these sources
generate insight into the key environmental issues and challenges
faced by ﬁrms operating in the UK food industry and the efforts
being taken to prevent pollution within this context.

Process stewardship—existing scales from the literature were
used to measure the elements making up this concept. A four-item
scale was replicated from a study by Paulraj (2009) to measure the
level at which responding ﬁrms engaged in supplier environ-
mental collaboration. A ﬁve-item scale was replicated from a study
by Vachon and Klassen (2008) to measure the level of environ-
mental collaboration with customers.

Environmental performance—a new ﬁve-item scale was developed
to measure environmental performance. Again, this was informed by
studies on environmental management in a food industry context
(Maloni and Brown, 2006; Pullman et al., 2009) backed up by online
information from DEFRA and FDF. There was also an attempt to link
the performance outcomes with the practices in the model.

Cost performance—we adapted Vachon and Klassen's (2008)
scale to measure cost performance. A four-item scale was con-
structed which focuses on the extent to which cost related
improvements derive from environmental practices.

3.2. Exploratory factor analysis

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using orthogonal rotation was
conducted on the scales to determine their overall effectiveness as
measures of the concepts included in the theoretical framework in
Fig. 1, (Hair et al., 2006). Bartlett's test for spherecity as well as
Kaiser Meyer Olkin's (KMO) test were also conducted for each of
the variable groups in order to assess the signiﬁcance and strength
of relationships among the items comprising the variables. The
variables were put into the orthogonal rotation in groups of three
(see Appendix A).

Convergence and discriminant validity were assessed within
the EFA. All but one of the standardised loadings were statisti-
cally signiﬁcant and above the .60 threshold which suggests that
convergence validity is achieved (Hair et al., 2006). The only
loading below the threshold was very close at .59. Three-factor
solutions were suggested in all cases, with all of the eignenvalues
above 1 and a high level of variance explained (470%),
demonstrating support for discriminant validity in all cases.
Inspection of scree plot diagrams provided further conﬁrmation
of the suggested three-factor solutions. In addition to factor
analysis, the Cronbach Alpha scores for each of the variables
were calculated to assess their overall reliability as measures (see
Appendix B). These values ranged from .85 to .95 indicating a
high level of measurement reliability (Hair et al., 2006). Overall,
this analysis conﬁrms that the items comprising each of the
variables are valid and reliable measures of their overall con-
struct. As a result, they are suitable for further testing through
multiple regression analysis.

4. Data analysis

Multivariate Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis is
used to test the hypotheses (Hair et al., 2006; Greene, 2011). Prior
to analysis, a series of residual diagnostics tests, univariate and
graphical analysis were used to assess the normality, linearity and
homoscedasticity of the data (Hair et al., 2006). These tests indi-
cate that the assumptions for OLS regression are met by the data
(Greene, 2011). Multicollinearity was assessed for
through
inspection of correlation coefﬁcients as well as the Variance
Inﬂation Factor (VIF) scores which both suggest that multi-
collinearity is not a concern for the data.

4.1. Control variables

Eight control variables are used to control for the following
organisational characteristics: plant size (i.e. the natural logarithm
of the number of employees); ﬁrm age (i.e. age of the ﬁrm in year
groupings); exporter (i.e. a dichotomous variable indicating if the
ﬁrm exports their products); independent business unit (i.e. a
dichotomous variable indicating whether the ﬁrm is independent
or part of a larger parent ﬁrm); and four industry variables,
namely, processed food, beverage, meat and dairy (i.e. dichot-
omous variables indicating the sub-industry group from which the
ﬁrm derives based on four-digit SIC codes).

Pairwise correlations for all of the independent and dependent
variables are included in Table 1 along with the means and stan-
dard deviations for the variables. All of the correlations are below
the recommended cut off level of .80 (Hair et al., 2006; Tabachnick
and Fiddell, 2007), however, some of the high correlations did
cause some concern regarding multicollinearity.
In order to
investigate this further the Variance Inﬂation Factor (VIF) scores
were examined. The highest VIF score of 2.73 for the variable
energy reduction, was well below the 10.0 threshold suggesting
a problem in the
that multicollinearity does not pose

interpretation of results. Environmental proactivity generated
signiﬁcant correlations with all of the environmental practice
variables in the model (po.01). This provides some preliminary
evidence for the hypothesised relationships among these vari-
ables. There are also a number of signiﬁcant correlations among
the environmental practice and performance variables again pro-
viding some support for the hypothesised relationships among
these variables.

4.2. Hypothesis testing

Results of the ﬁrst four sets of regression analyses are pre-
sented in Table 2. With energy reduction, waste reduction, sup-
plier collaboration and customer collaboration as dependent
variables, control variables are entered in the step 1. To test
Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b, environmental proactivity is entered
in the step 2. To assess the overall signiﬁcance of each regression

model, attention is paid to the R2 and F statistic as well as the
coefﬁcients of environmental proactivity.

4.2.1. Pollution prevention models

The results in step 1 of the energy reduction model show that
the control variables together explain 13% of the variance in
energy reduction practices. Firm size and beverage industry both
have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on energy reduction at the 99%
level (po.001) and 90% level (po.10) respectively. The addition of
environmental proactivity as a predictor in the second step
explains a signiﬁcant amount of additional variance (change in
R2¼27%; the change in F statistic is 63.46, po.001). The effect of
environmental proactivity on energy reduction is positive and
highly signiﬁcant (β¼.55, po.001). The overall R2 indicating the
variance explained by the control variables and environmental
proactivity is 40%; adjusted for the number of parameters esti-
mated, the R2 is 36%, and the full model is statistically signiﬁcant

(F¼10.32, po.001). The results in step 1 of the waste reduction
model indicate that the control variables explain 12% of the var-
iance in waste reduction practices. Within this model ﬁrm size and
dairy industry both have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on waste
reduction at the 99% level (po.001) and 90% level (po.10)
respectively. The results for step two of the model indicate that
environmental proactivity explains a signiﬁcant amount of addi-
tional variance (change in R2¼20%; the change in F statistic is
40.38, po.001). The effect of environmental proactivity on energy
reduction is positive and highly signiﬁcant (β¼.46, po.001). The
overall R2 indicating the variance explained by the all of the
independent variables is 32%; adjusted for the number of para-
meters estimated, the R2 is 28%, and the full model is statistically
signiﬁcant (F¼7.23, po.001).

These results provide strong support for Hypotheses 1a and 1b
and conﬁrm the suggested link between an environmentally
proactive orientation and the implementation of practices related
to pollution prevention. This supports an implicit assumption of
the NRBV that proactive engagement with the natural environ-
ment can be expressed through a pollution prevention approach
(Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011). Further, it builds upon other
studies which suggest that environmental proactivity can inﬂu-
ence the development of internal environmental practices (Mon-
tabon et al., 2007; Lopez-Gamero et al., 2009; Akin-Ates et al.,
2012). Deﬁnitions of pollution prevention imply a set of internal
practices seeking to reduce environmental impacts within the
production process (Michalisin and Stinchﬁeld, 2010; Thoumy and
Vachon, 2012; Hoque and Clarke, 2013). Internal processes are a
logical starting point for ﬁrms seeking to proactively engage with
the natural environment as they can identify areas for improve-
ment within their own operations (Hart, 1995). Following this,
they can start to work with key stakeholders to identify areas for
improvement within their supply chain (Hart and Dowell, 2011).

4.2.2. Process stewardship models

The last two models outlined in Table 2 include the process
stewardship practice variables of supplier collaboration and cus-
tomer collaboration. First, the model where supplier collaboration
constitutes the dependent variable indicates that the control
variables jointly explain 4% of its variance in step one. However,
there appear to be no statistically signiﬁcant relationships among
these controls and the dependent variable. At step two of the
model, the addition of environmental proactivity as a predictor
presents a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of variance explained
(change in R2¼27%; the change in F statistic is 55.20, po.001). The
inﬂuence of environmental proactivity on supplier collaboration is
positive and highly signiﬁcant (β¼.55, po.001). The overall R2
indicating the variance explained by the all of the independent
variables is 31%; adjusted for the number of parameters estimated,
the R2 is 26%, and the full model is statistically signiﬁcant (F¼7.03,
po.001).

The results for step one of the customer collaboration model
indicate that the control variables jointly explain 7% of the var-
iance in the dependent variable. Of these control variables only
ﬁrm size appears to have a statistically signiﬁcant impact (po.05).
The addition of environmental proactivity as a predictor of cus-
tomer collaboration results in a signiﬁcant increase in the amount
of variance explained (change in R2¼11%; the change in F statistic
is 18.25, po.001). The effect of environmental proactivity on
customer collaboration is positive and highly signiﬁcant (β¼.34,
po.001). The overall R2 indicating the variance explained by the
all of the independent variables is 18%; adjusted for the number of
parameters estimated, the R2 is 13%, and the full model is statis-
tically signiﬁcant (F¼3.37, po.001).

Again, these results provide strong support for Hypotheses 2a
and 2b, conﬁrming the link between environmental proactivity

and process stewardship. Consistent with the NRBV’s suggested
links between proactivity and process stewardship, these ﬁndings
support the extension of environmental practices to the supply
chain level within proactive ﬁrms (Hart and Dowell, 2011). This
suggests that ﬁrms expressing a commitment to the environment
through a proactive orientation, are considering not only the
environmental impact of their own internal practices but also the
impact of practices within their supply chain. These efforts are
being expressed through collaboration with both suppliers and
customers. Environmental collaboration reﬂects engagement with
key stakeholders (suppliers and customers) in response to envir-
onmental concerns, a fundamental aspect of a stewardship
approach (Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Hart and Dowell, 2011).
Bowen et al. (2001) identiﬁed a proactive orientation as an
important antecedent
to environmental supply management.
Consistent with this, our ﬁndings generate further support for a
link between pro-activity and environmental practices with sup-
pliers. Moreover, our results extend this further by conﬁrming a
link between pro-activity and customer environmental practices.
This indicates that proactive ﬁrms are expressing their commit-
ment to the environment through practices both upstream and
downstream in the supply chain. With limited research on drivers
of supply chain collaboration to date (Bowen et al., 2001; de Leeuw
and Fransoo, 2009), these ﬁndings develop a case for a proactive
orientation being an important antecedent to collaborative activ-
ities at the supply chain level.

It is of interest to note that the relationship between environ-
mental proactivity and supplier collaboration appears to be
stronger than the relationship between environmental proactivity
and customer collaboration. This might be due to the increasing
pressure and accountability being placed on lead ﬁrms to manage
the environmental impact of their supply chains (Rao and Holt,
2005; Hoejmose et al., 2013). By deﬁnition, proactivity is indicative
of a preventative approach that seeks to target problems at the
source. The inputs to the process come from upstream in the
supply chain. If environmental concerns are not addressed at this
stage, their impact may be carried throughout the supply network.
Thus, it is not surprising that proactive ﬁrms would target and
address environmental concerns with suppliers as a key compo-
nent of their stewardship approach. Although assessing different
factors in relation to environmental collaboration, Vachon and
Klassen (2008) identify stronger relationships for supplier colla-
boration than customer collaboration. Our study is consistent with
this and may suggest that collaboration with suppliers is a more
prominent practice than collaboration with customers.

The results for the second set of regression models are dis-
played in Table 3. In these models, environmental performance
and cost performance constitute the respective dependent
variables.

4.2.3. Pollution prevention and organisational performance

Results for the hypothesised links between pollution preven-
tion practices and organisational performance are presented
across the two models outlined in Table 3. Control variables are
included at step 1 of each model and the environmental practice
variables at step 2. A signiﬁcant increase in the variance explained
is evident upon the inclusion of the environmental practice vari-
ables in each model (environmental performance model: change
in R2¼36%; the change in F statistic is 12.06, po.001; cost per-
formance model: change in R2¼10%; the change in F statistic is
4.27, po.05). Both pollution prevention practices appear to exert a
positive inﬂuence on environmental performance (energy reduc-
tion: β¼.35, po.001, waste reduction: β¼.24, po.05). These
results provide strong support for Hypotheses 3a and 3b. When
cost performance constitutes the dependent variable, signiﬁcant
results are noted in the case of waste reduction (β¼.25, po.05),

but not energy reduction. This generates support for Hypothesis
4b, however, hypothesis 4a remains unsupported.

A strong link between pollution prevention practices and envir-
onmental performance is evident from the results. This suggests
that the implementation of these practices may lead to improve-
ments in environmental performance. Considering the pre-planned
preventative efforts comprising a pollution prevention approach,
ﬁrms would expect to see an improvement in the environmental
impact of their processes. Our ﬁndings are consistent with other
studies that note a link between internal environmental practices
and improved environmental performance (Sroufe, 2003; Zhu and
Sarkis, 2004; Rao and Holt, 2005). Further, they conﬁrm that the
development of a pollution prevention approach, as outlined in the
NRBV, can lead to enhanced environmental performance (Hart,
1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011). This is an important consideration as
ﬁrms who proactively engage with the natural environment
through pollution prevention, do so with the objective to improve
their environmental performance.

Regarding the relationship between pollution prevention and
cost performance, mixed support is provided by the results. There is
strong support for a link between waste reduction and cost per-
formance but no support for this link in the case of energy reduc-
tion. A number of studies have found support for a link between
internal environmental practices, similar to those comprising a
pollution prevention approach, and dimensions of operational per-
formance such as cost (Rao and Holt, 2005; Grifﬁth and Bhutto,
2009; Schoenherr, 2012). However, these studies often indicate that
some practices may be linked to all dimensions of operational
performance while others may be linked to some or none of these
dimensions (Vachon and Klassen, 2008). Our ﬁndings seem to fur-
ther reﬂect that this is the case. This may be due to the level of
investment required for certain environmental practices within the
UK food industry. For example, the practices used for waste reduc-
tion may be more straightforward or require less investment than
those used for energy reduction. Energy reduction may require

investment in more efﬁcient technologies which would require
substantial investment that may offset potential cost savings. The
complex and expansive range of environmental practices adopted
within the food industry can also lead to variations in performance
outcomes (Pullman et al., 2009). Thus, it might be useful for future
studies to identify and assess more speciﬁc practices within this
context.

4.2.4. Process stewardship and organisational performance

The environmental performance model provides support for a
signiﬁcant positive relationship with supplier collaboration
(β¼.10, po.10), consistent with Hypothesis 4a. However, custo-
mer collaboration does not appear to have any statistically sig-
niﬁcant impact on environmental performance. This model
is
deemed to be statistically signiﬁcant (R2¼52%; F¼12.06, po.001).
Thus Hypothesis 4a is accepted and Hypothesis 4b rejected in light
of the results. The cost performance model indicates a signiﬁcant
positive relationship with supplier collaboration (β¼.19, po.05),
consistent with Hypothesis 4c. Again, no such support is provided
in the case of customer collaboration. The signiﬁcance of the
overall model (R2¼21%; F¼3.09, po.001) leads to acceptance of
Hypothesis 4c and rejection of Hypothesis 4d.

Overall, the support for a link between process stewardship and
environmental and cost performance is mixed. The results indicate
a positive signiﬁcant relationship with both dimensions of per-
formance in the case of supplier collaboration, but no support for
any links with performance in the case of customer collaboration.
This suggests that working with suppliers to tackle environmental
concerns may enhance the performance of the lead ﬁrm, whilst
working with customers may not lead to the same improvements
within the UK food industry. This is an interesting ﬁnding in light
of other studies that note positive and signiﬁcant results in rela-
tion to both aspects of environmental collaboration (Vachon and
Klassen, 2008; Wiengarten et al., 2013; Blome et al., 2014). For
example, Vachon and Klassen (2008) present strong support for
both supplier and customer collaboration to inﬂuence environ-
mental performance within manufacturing ﬁrms. Further, a
number of other studies present strong support for environmental
supply chain practices to generate improved environmental per-
formance (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004; Rao and Holt, 2005; Blome et al.,
2014). One potential explanation for this ﬁnding is the substantial
role played by retail customers within the UK food industry. As a
result of their dominant market position, retailers are able to
ensure that collaborative environmental initiatives are focussed
and aligned with their environmental goals.

Regarding cost performance, the supported relationship with
supplier collaboration is consistent with other studies that identify
the potential for environmental practices upstream in the supply
chain to inﬂuence cost performance (Rao and Holt, 2005; Vachon
and Klassen, 2008; Paulraj, 2011). While these studies assess
relationships in the broader context of manufacturing, our study
builds upon them by providing further support in the narrower
context of the UK food industry. This ﬁnding also supports the
arguments of the NRBV in relation to a stewardship approach and
the generation of competitive advantage (Hart, 1995; Hart and
Dowell, 2011). The customer collaboration ﬁnding was not as
expected and suggests that collaborative environmental efforts
with customers may not generate improved cost performance.
This suggests that certain components of a process stewardship
approach may lead to enhanced cost performance whilst others
may not. While unexpected, this ﬁnding is consistent with some
other studies in the extant literature (Zhu and Sarkis, 2007; Green
et al., 2012). For example, Zhu and Sarkis (2007) ﬁnd no support
for links between customer collaboration and environmental or
cost performance. More recently, Green et al. (2012) ﬁnd that
customer collaboration is positively linked to environmental

155

performance but not to economic performance. Within the extant
literature, the link between external environmental practices such
as customer collaboration and performance appears to be more
ambiguous than that between internal environmental practices
and organisational performance (De Giovanni, 2012). Thus, it is not
surprising that the hypotheses relating to external (supply chain)
practices did not obtain the same level of support as those relating
to the internal practices.

Some studies suggest that relational resources are a key element
in obtaining potential performance outcomes from external envir-
onmental collaboration with customers and suppliers (Vachon and
Klassen, 2008; Blome et al., 2014). Consideration of relational factors
might provide an explanation for the ambiguous results regarding
environmental
collaboration and organisational performance.
Namely, within the context of the UK food industry, managers are
able to build and sustain collaborative relationships that beneﬁt
organisational performance with suppliers, whereas collaborative
relationships that generate a positive impact on organisational
performance are more difﬁcult to form with retail customers. Inte-
gration and alignment of environmental objectives across both
parties is an important aspect of collaboration (Vachon et al., 2009).
This may be easier to achieve in the case of suppliers than larger
retail customers, particularly where the lead ﬁrm has some inﬂu-
ence in the relationship (De Leeuw and Fransoo, 2009). Retailer
domination is a prominent characteristic of the UK food industry
(Robson and Rawnsley, 2001). Retailers effectively are the customers
of food processing ﬁrms and therefore are likely to be the dominant
party in collaborative activities (Mena et al., 2014). As a result,
opportunities to improve organisational performance identiﬁed by
the food processing ﬁrms may not always be achieved.

Fig. 2 Outlines the supported hypotheses from the framework.
It is interesting to note that a number of the control variables
are signiﬁcant across the models. In particular ﬁrm size is posi-
tively linked to a number of the environmental practice variables,
namely, energy reduction (po.001), waste reduction (po.001)
and customer collaboration (po.05). This is not surprising and ﬁts
in well with other studies that highlight the important inﬂuence of
ﬁrm size in the development of environmental practices (Chan,
2005; Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-Benito, 2005; Darnall et al.,
2008, 2010). A potential explanation for this is that larger ﬁrms
possess more ﬁnancial and human capital for the upfront invest-
ments required for the implementation of new environmental
practices. A signiﬁcant positive link is also noted between ﬁrm size
and environmental performance (po.001). This suggests that
larger ﬁrms may be more likely to beneﬁt from improved envir-
onmental performance. A potential reason for this might be that
their operations are larger generating more room for potential
improvements to be made.

5. Conclusions

This study has analysed the inﬂuence of a pro-active orientation
on environmental practices and subsequently, the inﬂuence of these
environmental practices on environmental and cost performance.
The ﬁndings from this study ﬁt with and build upon the extensive
research base on approaches to and performance outcomes of
environmental management (Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-
Jiminez et al., 2014). Two sets of environmental practices related to
pollution prevention and process stewardship are considered at the
heart of the framework. Our results indicate that within the context
of the UK food industry, environmental proactivity is an important
antecedent to both pollution prevention and process stewardship.
Results for the organisational performance outcomes derived from
environmental practices are mixed. Strong support for the link
between environmental practices and environmental performance
is provided along with some support for the link with cost perfor-
mance. These ﬁndings shed new light on the relationships between
environmental approach, practices and performance by integrating
these prominent areas of research and assessing their inter-
relationships. Taken together, the ﬁndings provide broad support for
the propositions of the NRBV (Hart, 1995; Hart and Dowell, 2011).
The key argument that pro-active environmental efforts can result
in performance improvements has been empirically supported,
although not unequivocally.

5.1. Research contributions

5.1.1. Theoretical contributions

This study adopts a novel perspective to assess the link
between environmental proactivity and environmental practices.
Rather than viewing environmental proactivity as a component of
certain practices or systems as in other studies (e.g. Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003; Montabon et al., 2007; Lopez-Gamero et al., 2009;
Zailani et al., 2012), this study considers environmental proactivity
as a stand-alone concept with the potential to inﬂuence the
environmental practices adopted by ﬁrms. The merit of assessing
proactivity as an independent construct has been noted in recent
studies (Akin-Ates et al., 2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014), yet
we are not aware of many studies that assess the direct inﬂuence
of a pro-active environmental orientation on environmental
practices being implemented. This is an important consideration
because exploring the extent to which a pro-active orientation is
expressed through environmental practices sheds light on the
relationship between what ﬁrms think they do and what they
actually do in practice: between espoused and actual practices. In
other words, ﬁrms may claim to be ‘pro-active’ with regard to their
environmental efforts, yet a lack of practical attention to envir-
onmental concerns may compromise this claim.

A number of studies suggest a link between environmental
proactivity and environmental practices (Hart, 1995; Russo and
Fouts, 1997; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Murillo-Luna et al., 2011).
This study goes further and empirically tests this link by developing
a framework comprising two sets of practices outlined within the
NRBV framework, namely, pollution prevention and process stew-
ardship (Hart and Dowell, 2011; Wong et al., 2012). As far as we are
aware no other study empirically tests the links between environ-
mental proactivity, pollution prevention and process stewardship.
These practices, at the heart of the NRBV framework are suggested
to be an expression of a pro-active commitment to the environment
(Hart, 1995), yet, direct links between a pro-active orientation,
pollution prevention and process stewardship do not appear to be
established within the literature to date.

Further, this study generates novel insights on the relationship
between environmental practices and organisational performance.
Consideration of the links between pollution prevention, process
stewardship and organisational performance enables empirical
testing of the NRBV’s proposition that these practices can enhance
performance and lead to competitive advantage. While a number
of studies assess links between various environmental practices
and organisational performance, few assess practices that are
speciﬁcally related to the NRBV framework. Investigation of the
performance outcomes from pollution prevention and process
stewardship enables empirical conﬁrmation of the propositions of
the NRBV, thus aiding its development as a theoretical framework.
In considering both antecedents and outcomes of pollution
prevention and process stewardship, this study provides a com-
prehensive investigation of the NRBV and its propositions. To date,
the majority of studies have looked at different aspects of this
framework in a somewhat piecemeal manner (Chan, 2005). As far
as we are aware, this study provides preliminary empirical support
for the links between proactivity, pollution prevention and process
stewardship. Furthermore, the results contribute to the ongoing
debate on the beneﬁts of environmental management (Green et
al., 2012; De Burgos-Jiminez et al., 2014). The majority of studies
investigating the link between environmental management and
organisational performance do not consider strategic orientation
in relation to the practices they assess (Lopez-Gamero et al., 2009;
Wong et al., 2012). In considering links between a pro-active
environmental orientation, environmental practices and organi-
sational performance, this study demonstrates that a pro-active
environmental orientation can translate into environmental
practices that enhance organisational performance to some
degree.

5.1.2. Managerial implications

Our ﬁndings generate interesting insights for management and
supply chain practitioners. By conducting an empirical study, we
establish evidence beyond the anecdotal, that ﬁrms expressing a
pro-active orientation through pollution prevention and process
stewardship can obtain beneﬁts in the form of improved envir-
onmental and cost performance. First, our framework provides
some guidance to managers on how a pro-active environmental
orientation may translate into speciﬁc environmental practices
within the context of the UK food industry. This illustrates the
types of environmental activities being conducted by manu-
facturing ﬁrms within this context and enables others to follow
suit. Second, the ﬁndings provide support for a link between
environmental practices and environmental performance. This
should enable managers who want to improve their environ-
mental performance to take note of speciﬁc environmental prac-
tices that might enable them to do this. Third, there is some
support for the link between environmental practices and cost
performance which enables managers to see that improvements
beyond the environmental dimension are also possible in some

cases. This is a very important insight for managers who are likely
to only consider pro-active environmental engagement if there is
some kind of reward in it for them (Figge and Hahn, 2012).

5.2. Limitations and future research directions

This study contains some limitations that should be high-
lighted. First, the lack of established measures for a number of the
concepts meant that new measures had to be developed. While
these have met the requirements of validity and reliability, pre-
viously tested and used measures are preferable. Second, the list of
environmental practices included within the model is not exten-
sive. There are a number of other environmental practices that
might have been considered and a decision was made to select this
group of practices based on their prominence in the literature as
well as their relation to the NRBV framework. Third, the time
frame used to measure the constructs was two years. While this is
consistent with previous studies that suggest a one to two year
time lag between implementation of environmental practices and
certain performance outcomes (Hart and Ahuja, 1996), it excludes
the potential to consider relationships over a longer time period.
Furthermore, there was no consideration of how long the envir-
onmental practices had been implemented. It might have been
useful to have this information as it would have enabled con-
sideration of whether the environmental practices that had been
implemented for a longer time had more of an impact on orga-
nisational performance.

With regard to future research directions, there is room for
studies to consider other factors that might inﬂuence the rela-
tionship between environmental practices and organisational
performance. First, one potential area for future research is to
investigate the organisational antecedents that determine which
environmental practices are integrated within the ﬁrm and across
its supply chain (Ronnenberg et al., 2011). Second, it would be
valuable for future studies to explore the level at which certain
environmental practices are integrated within ﬁrms as well as the
processes used to enable deeper environmental integration. For
example, Sarkis et al. (2010) consider the potential for environ-
mental training programmes to enhance the implementation of
certain environmental practices. There is room for future studies
to build upon this further and consider other organisational factors
that may enable a deeper level of environmental
integration.
Third, consideration of the extent to which environmental prac-
tices are aligned with other operational goals, such as cost per-
formance, would provide another potential avenue for future
research. For example, are environmental efforts aligned with
traditional operational goals such as cost reduction or are they
implemented in a more isolated, disconnected manner? This is
something that future studies should consider as it might provide
insight into the relationship between environmental practices and
organisational performance.
