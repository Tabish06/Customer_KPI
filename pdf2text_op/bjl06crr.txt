  ABSTRACT 
 While interest in the concept of corporate rep-
utation has gained momentum in the last few 
years,  a  precise  and  commonly  agreed  upon 
definition  is  still  lacking.  This  paper  reviews 
the  many  definitions  of  corporate  reputation 
present in the recent literature and categorizes 
these definitions based on their similarities and 
differences.  The  purpose  of  the  study  is  to 
review, analyze and evaluate prior definition-
al statements of corporate reputation. The analy-
sis led us to conclude that the cluster of mean-
ing  that  looks  most  promising  for  future 
definitional  work  uses  the  language  of  assess-
ment  and  specific  terms  such  as  judgment, 
estimation, evaluation or gauge. Based on this 
review work and a lexicological analysis of the 
concept  of reputation,  we  propose a new defi-
nitional  statement  that  we  think  adds  theo-
retical clarity to this area of study. The state-
ment  defines 
reputation  more 
explicitly and narrowly and distinguishes this 
concept from corporate identity, corporate image 
and corporate reputation capital. It is our hope 
that this study and the resulting definition will 
provoke further scholarship devoted to develop-
ing one voice when it comes to corporate repu-
tation as a concept.

 INTRODUCTION 
 In the inaugural issue of  Corporate Reputation 
Review ,   Fombrun  and  van  Riel  (1997:  5)  
lamented the dearth of studies on corporate 
reputation:  ‘ Although  corporate  reputations 
are ubiquitous, they remain relatively under-
studied. In part, it is surely because reputa-
tions  are  seldom  noticed  until  they  are 
threatened. In part, however, it is also a prob-
lem of deﬁ nition ’ . Today, it is hard to argue 
that corporate reputations are understudied. 
Events  of  the  last  few  years  have  certainly 
moved corporate reputations into the spot-
light.  As   Figure  1   illustrates,  the  study  of 
corporate reputation has intensiﬁ ed over the 
last  few  years.   Figure  1   shows  the  number 
of  articles  devoted  to  corporate  reputation 
for the period 1980 – 2003. To determine the 
trend, we searched for peer-reviewed, schol-
arly  articles  on  corporate  reputation  that 
were published in academic journals indexed 
by  ABI  Inform  (Pro  Quest).  Our  search 
identiﬁ ed  only  those  articles  in  which  the 
phrase  ‘ corporate reputation ’  appeared in the 
title  or  abstract  of  the  piece,  indicating 
that  the  authors  were  focused  on  this 
concept in their research. During the period

of 2001 – 2003, the average number of schol-
arly  articles  on  corporate  reputation  more 
than  doubled  in  frequency  compared  with 
the  year  2000. And,  the  average  number  of 
scholarly  articles  on  corporate  reputation 
published  during  the  period  2001 – 2003  is 
nearly ﬁ ve times as large as is the average for 
the  period  1990 – 2000.  In  addition,  a  well-
established scholarly journal,  Corporate Repu-
tation  Review ,  devoted  solely  to  the  topic, 
now exists, and the associated annual confer-
ence  on  corporate  reputation  is  now  in  its 
eighth  year.  The  Reputation  Institute  and 
many other consulting ﬁ rms are conducting 
brisk business advising corporations on how 
to manage their reputations. There are mul-
titudes  of  scholarly  and  practitioner  books 
available  on  the  topic.  In  short,  the  impor-
tance of corporate reputation is evident. 

 Despite the fact that the concept of cor-
porate  reputation  has  driven  considerable 
academic  and  practitioner  work,  several 
scholars have recently reissued  Fombrun and 
van  Riel’s  (1997)   call  for  deﬁ nitional  and 
other  theoretically  oriented  studies  of  the 
concept  ( Gotsi  and Wilson,  2001 ;   Caruana, 
2001 ;   Fombrun,  2001 ;   Davies   et  al. ,  2001 ; 
 Wei,  2002 ;   Lewellyn,  2002 ;   Whetton  and 
Mackey, 2002 ;  Mahon, 2002 ;  Wartick, 2002 ). 
For  example,   Gotsi  and Wilson  (2001:  24 ) 

began  their  review  with  the  reminder  that 
 ‘ over the years authors [in this area of study] 
have adopted different, sometimes even con-
tradictory deﬁ nitions for the term corporate 
reputation ’ .  Lewellyn (2002: 454 ) stated that 
the purpose of her article was to  ‘ focus the 
conceptual mess  –  the zeitgeist of the repu-
tation literature …  ’ , but concedes that there 
is still much more work to be done.  Mahon 
(2002: 415 ) contended that reputation as an 
idea is still  ‘ not as clear as it might initially 
seem  to  a  casual  observer ’ .  Wartick’s  (2002: 
371)  assessment of the state of the art when 
it comes to deﬁ ning and theorizing reputa-
tion  is  perhaps  the  most  comprehensive: 
 ‘  … deﬁ nitions and data are found to be lack-
ing, and  …  many deﬁ ciencies in deﬁ nition 
and  data  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that 
theory  development  related  to  corporate 
reputation has been insufﬁ cient ’ . 

 In light of current concerns raised by sev-
eral  scholars  in  this  burgeoning  ﬁ eld  about 
the lack of a precise, common deﬁ nition, in 
this article we revisit a fundamental question: 
What is corporate reputation? It seems clear 
that without a uniﬁ ed approach to the con-
cept itself, we cannot effectively or efﬁ ciently 
advance research on corporate reputation. In 
our view, while many scholars have gathered 
under the same tent, in large part due to the 
impressive efforts of Fombrun, van Riel and 
their colleagues, it is important that we now 
devote  some  serious  attention  to  forging  a 
common vocabulary. With this goal in mind, 
below  we  list  and  review  the  many  deﬁ ni-
tions of corporate reputation now present in 
the literature, and then categorize these def-
initions  based  on  their  similarities  and  dif-
ferences. We  know  that  researchers  in  this 
area  of  study  are  far  from  being  in  perfect 
agreement  on  one  common  deﬁ nition,  but 
wondered just how differently they are con-
ceptualizing  corporate  reputation  and  what 
clusters of underlying meaning might emerge 
from  careful  study  of  previous  deﬁ nitions. 
Following our review and analysis of previ-
ous  studies  that  have  explicitly  deﬁ ned

reputation,  we  develop  recommendations 
and  advance  a  more  precise  deﬁ nition  that 
we  think  is  useful  for  further  research. The 
deﬁ nition we advance adds theoretical clarity 
to this area of study in that we make distinc-
tions  among  four  key  concepts  in  this  lit-
erature: corporate identity, corporate image, 
corporate  reputation  and  corporate  reputa-
tion capital.   

 THE DEFINITIONAL LANDSCAPE: AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE RUGGED TERRAIN 
 Eight  years  ago,   Fombrun  and  van  Riel 
(1997)  described the  ‘ reputational landscape ’  
as chaotic and barren. While it is easy to see 
the chaos in the literature of that time, it is 
not clear that the reputational landscape was 
barren.  Indeed,   Fombrun  and  van  Riel 
(1997)   identiﬁ ed  several  distinct  views  of 
reputation  including  economic,  strategic, 
marketing,  organizational,  sociological  and 
accounting,  each  with  its  own  traditions  of 
deﬁ ning  the  concept  and  conducting  re-
search. As a multi-disciplinary ﬁ eld of study 
unto itself, the landscape of corporate repu-
tation research was perhaps better described 
as  replete  with  virtually  self-contained  is-
lands  than  as  barren.  Of  course,  too  much 
breadth in the perspectives taken can lead to 
a  lack  of  productive  study,  which  is  surely 
what  Fombrun and van Riel (1997: 6 ) had 
in mind when they stated:  ‘ The lack of sys-
tematic  attention  to  corporate  reputations 
can  be  traced  to  the  diversity  of  relevant 
academic  and  practitioner  literatures  that 
explore  different  facets  of  the  construct ’ . 
The  key  point  is  that  researchers,  each 
wearing their own disciplinary blinders, did 
not  hold  to  an  integrated  deﬁ nition  and 
often  were  not  aware  of 
the  diverse 
perspectives. 

 Accordingly, early efforts at advancing the 
ﬁ eld were rightfully placed on bringing dis-
cipline-based  scholars  into  the  fold  of  cor-
porate  reputation  research.  Several  scholars 
attempted  to  build  an  integrative  medium 
that would push the study of reputation for-

ward under  ‘ one vision, one voice ’  (see  Bar-
nett  et al.,  2000  for a summary of these ef-
forts). Spurred on, in part, by  Fombrun and 
van Riel’s (1997)  call, researchers from across 
these disciplines have begun to join togeth-
er. The corner has been turned in that some 
scholars  now  tend  to  recognize  how  dis-
jointed this ﬁ eld of study is. There are many 
distinct visions and disparate voices echoing 
across  the  vast  stretches  of  the  reputational 
landscape  and  there  is  an  urgent  need  to 
create a unifying framework.  

 Confusion Among Concepts of 
Corporate Identity, Image and Reputation 
 Perhaps the most fundamental barrier to the 
creation of  ‘ one vision, one voice ’  relates to 
the  confusion  concerning  the  concepts  of 
identity, image and reputation.  Fombrun and 
van  Riel  (1997)   sought  to  subsume  image 
and  identity  within  reputation.  From  their 
perspective, image and identity are the basic 
components of reputation. Their integrative 
perspective  presents  identity  as  the  percep-
tion employees and managers  –  those inside 
the ﬁ rm  –  hold of the nature of their ﬁ rm. 
In contrast, image is the perception that ex-
ternal observers have of the ﬁ rm. Reputation 
is the net result of the aggregation of these 
perceptions:  ‘  A corporate reputation is a collective 
representation   …   It  gauges  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  relative 
standing both internally with employees and ex-
ternally with its stakeholders  …   ’  ( Fombrun and 
van Riel, 1997: 10 ; italics in original). Even 
in  its  eighth  year,  however,  the  Reputation 
Institute ’ s annual conference individually lists 
reputation, image and identity in its title. 

  Fombrun  and  van  Riel’s  (1997)   integra-
tive  perspective,  though  it  is  now  more 
widely accepted, remains far from universal. 
Identity, image and reputation are still often 
used  interchangeably  ( Wartick,  2002 ).  For 
example,  Markwick and Fill (1997)  deﬁ ned 
identity as  ‘ the organization ’ s presentation of 
itself  to  its  various  stakeholders  and  the 
means  by  which  it  distinguishes  itself  from 
all  other  organizations ’ .   Bromley  (2001)  

28

 Barnett, Jermier and Lafferty 

deﬁ ned  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  image  as  ‘ the  internal  col-
lective  state  of  mind  that  underlies  its  cor-
porate communications efforts (successful or 
not) to present itself to others ’ . Whetten and 
Mackey (2002: 401) deﬁ ned image as  ‘ what 
organizational  agents  want  their  external 
stakeholders  to  understand  is  most  central, 
enduring and distinctive about their organi-
zation ’ .  This  internal  focus  is  similar  to 
Fombrun ’ s (1996: 36) deﬁ nition of corporate 
identity:  ‘ the set of values and principles em-
ployees  and  managers  associate  with  the 
company ’ . 

 When  scholars  do  not  use  these  terms 
interchangeably,  they  may  instead  argue  for 
a  particular  hierarchy.  For  example,   Wei 
(2002:  270)   argued  that  reputation  should 
not subsume image, but rather image should 
subsume reputation:  

 If  ‘ reputation ’  stems (partly) from persua-
sion,  as  suggested  by  Fombrun,  then  it 
ought to be subsumed under  ‘ image, ’  not 
the  other  way  around.  Of  course,  repu-
tation  also  contributes  to  the  making  of 
a  corporate  image,  but  still  it  should  be 
considered  a  variable  within  the  param-
eters of  ‘ image, ’  like other variables, such as 
marketing strategies, product qualities, and 
customer services, all of which can shape 
the outcome of image making.  

 Even  when  scholars  use  the  same  term   –  
corporate  reputation   –   they  offer  varying 
deﬁ nitions, or avoid precise deﬁ nitions alto-
gether. We  next  detail  our  study  of  recent 
deﬁ nitions of corporate reputation.    

 WHAT IS CORPORATE REPUTATION 
TODAY? 
 As  mentioned  above,  we  are  not  the  ﬁ rst 
researchers  to  identify  the  disparity  in  ter-
minology that lingers in the corporate repu-
tation literature. Several calls for deﬁ nitional 
clariﬁ cation have preceded us. Most notably, 
 Fombrun  and  van  Riel  (1997)   called  for 
work that bridges the many diverse perspec-
tives on reputation, and built the Reputation 

Institute  and  this  journal  with  that  aim  in 
mind.  A  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  assess 
how far we have come toward achieving that 
goal;  to  assess  the  level  of  unity  within  the 
ﬁ eld. Our assessment begins with an inven-
tory  of  deﬁ nitions  of  corporate  reputation. 
We build on the work of  Bennett and Kot-
tasz (2000) , who searched published and un-
published literature and found 16 deﬁ nitions 
of corporate reputation. We use  Bennett and 
Kottasz’s  (2000)   deﬁ nitions  as  a  starting 
point, and extend the search for deﬁ nitions 
by four additional years, to include the years 
2000  – 2003. These additional years are par-
ticularly critical, given the time delays inher-
ent in academic publishing. It would surely 
have  taken  several  years  for   Fombrun  and 
van  Riel’s  (1997)   call  to  pull  together  the 
various  disciplinary  perspectives  on  corpo-
rate  reputation  under  a  common  tent  to 
inﬂ uence academic thinking and to be dis-
cernable in published academic work. Thus, 
our  focus  is  on  recent  usage  of  corporate 
reputation in published academic studies. 

 Using  the  ABI  Inform  (Pro  Quest) 
Database,  we  conducted  a  search  for  peer-
reviewed, scholarly articles published on the 
topic of corporate reputation from 1 January, 
2000  to  31  December,  2003. We  also  con-
ducted  an  on-line  search  for  recent  books 
devoted  to  corporate  reputation. We  found 
that even though an article or book clearly 
ﬁ t  within  the  domain  of  corporate  reputa-
tion  and  made  use  of  the  terminology,  its 
authors often did not offer a formal deﬁ ni-
tion  of  the  term. Thus,  though  our  initial 
search  turned  up  hundreds  of  potentially 
relevant  articles  and  books,  our  reviews  of 
these articles and books showed that only a 
fraction offered speciﬁ c deﬁ nitions. We also 
found  that  some  articles  referenced  deﬁ ni-
tions of earlier articles or books, often works 
published outside of our search window. We 
traced such deﬁ nitions to the original work, 
and  where  formal  deﬁ nitions  could  be 
conﬁ rmed,  we  added  these  to  our  database 
of  deﬁ nitions.  As  shown  in   Table  1 ,  this

corporate reputation.  

 Clusters of Meaning 
 What we found through our search and sub-
sequent analysis was surprising. Given recent 
calls  to  clarify  the  deﬁ nition  of  reputation 
(eg,  Mahon, 2002 ;  Wartick, 2002 ), we knew 
that  no  single  deﬁ nition  was  commonly 
accepted and expected to ﬁ nd (a) numerous 
unique deﬁ nitions and (b) broad differences 
in meaning between and among the deﬁ ni-
tions.  Instead,  we  found  that  although  ter-
minology does differ across sources, there is 
more  than  a  little  underlying  similarity. 
Overall, we identiﬁ ed three distinct clusters 
of  meaning  in  the  deﬁ nitional  statements: 
reputation as a state of  awareness , reputation 
as an  assessment  and reputation as an  asset  (see 
 Table 1 ).  

 Awareness 
 The ﬁ rst cluster, reputation as  awareness , en-
compasses those deﬁ nitions that referred to 

actions and results

A synthesis of opinions
A snapshot reconciling multiple images
A perceptual representation of a ﬁ rm’s past 

actions

Net or aggregate perceptions
‘Net’ affective or emotional reaction
Reﬂ ects the history of past actions
A shared bundle of attributes
A corporation’s values
A set of economic and non-economic attributes
A buyer’s perception of how well known, 

good/bad, reliable, trustworthy, reputable and 
believable a ﬁ rm is

a term or used language indicating that ob-
servers or stakeholders had a general aware-
ness of a ﬁ rm but did not make judgments 
about  it. The  single  most  commonly  used 
term  for  deﬁ ning  corporate  reputation  in 
this  cluster  was  perceptions.  Within  this 
cluster,  corporate  reputations  were  deﬁ ned 
as an aggregation of perceptions, latent per-
ceptions, net perceptions, global perceptions, 
perceptual  representations  and  collective 
representations. Also included in this cluster 
are references to corporate reputation as rep-
resentations of knowledge or emotions since 
these indicate an awareness of the ﬁ rm.   

 Assessment 
 The  second  cluster,  which  is  modal  in  this 
sample, is reputation as  assessment . It includes 
those deﬁ nitions that referred to a term or 
used  language  indicating  that  observers  or 
stakeholders were involved in an assessment 
of the status of a ﬁ rm. These include refer-
ences to corporate reputation as a judgment, 
an estimate, an evaluation or a gauge. These 
four terms are synonymous in meaning. This

cluster  also  includes  references  to  esteem, 
regard  in  which  the  ﬁ rm  is  held,  and  how 
attractive  the  ﬁ rm  is. The  terms  ‘ opinions ’  
and  ‘ beliefs ’  also ﬁ t into this cluster because 
their deﬁ nitions are judgmental in nature.

 Asset 
 The  third  cluster,  which  we  label   asset ,  in-
corporates those deﬁ nitions that referred to 
reputation  as  something  of  value  and  sig-
niﬁ cance  to  the  ﬁ rm. This  group  includes 
references to the term as a resource or as an 
intangible, ﬁ nancial or economic asset. Def-
initions  that  frame  reputation  as  awareness

 WHAT SHOULD CORPORATE 
REPUTATION BE TOMORROW? 
 Informed by our review of recent literature 
and the 49 deﬁ nitional statements, we offer 
the following framework to help further re-
ﬁ ne the concept of corporate reputation. We 
think  it  is  particularly  useful  to  outline  its 
domain  relative  to  the  related  concepts  of 
identity, image and reputation capital. 

 In  the  process  of  analyzing  the  various 
deﬁ nitions  of  corporate  reputation  and  ex-
tracting  the  three  clusters  of  meaning,  we 
focused  our  attention  only  on  sources  that 
speciﬁ cally deﬁ ned corporate reputation. In 
the  process,  we  differentiated  corporate 
reputation  from  image,  identity,  reputation 
capital  and  other  permutations  of  the  pure 
term. Though we looked only at corporate 
reputation, we found many instances where 

the language bordered on or spilled over into 
what we consider aspects of image, identity 
and reputation capital, as we have presented 
them in  Figure 2 . Many deﬁ nitions of cor-
porate  reputation  literally  encompassed  as-
pects of these other constructs. For example, 
 Fombrun’s (2001)  comprehensive deﬁ nition 
of  corporate  reputation  includes  reputation 
as  an  economic  asset  (reputation  capital),  a 
representation (image) and a judgment (rep-
utation). Rather than blend these aspects into 
one broad deﬁ nition of corporate reputation, 
we advocate distinct boundaries between and 
among these constructs and a more focused 
deﬁ nition of corporate reputation.  

 Corporate Identity 
 We  view  identity  not  as  the  image  of  the 
ﬁ rm held by an inside stakeholder (i.e., em-
ployees), but rather, as the underlying  ‘ core ’  
or  basic  character  of  the  ﬁ rm  (cf.   Melewar 
and  Jenkins,  2002 ). That  is,  identity  is  akin 
to  the  concept  of  identity  in  mathematics 
 –   a  representation  of  the  ﬁ rm  that  equates 
to its current state. It is not identifying  with  
a  ﬁ rm,  but  rather,  the  identity   of   the  ﬁ rm 
 –  what the ﬁ rm actually is. Groundwork for 
the  corporate  identity  concept  was  laid  by 
 Albert  and Whetton  (1985)   and  has  been 
developed  most  recently  in  the  ﬁ eld  of 
reputation studies by  Fombrun and van Riel 
(2004:  165 – 166 ),  who  state  that  it  consists 
of  ‘ (a) features that employees consider  central  
to  the  company,  (b)  features  that  make  the 
company  distinctive  from other companies (in 
the eyes of employees) and (c) features that 
are   enduring   or  continuing,  linking  the 
present and the past to the future ’ . The idea 
of enduring, central features of organizations 
that  makes  them  distinctive  from  other

organizations  parallels  and  even  duplicates 
frameworks  in  the  ﬁ eld  of  organizational 
culture. In the culture literature, the organi-
zation  is  viewed  as  a  collection  of  material 
and  behavioral  symbols  and  corresponding 
systems  of  beliefs  and  values  and  basic,  un-
derlying  assumptions  (cf.   Frost   et  al. ,  1991 ; 
 Schein, 1992 ;  Alvesson, 2002 ;  Martin, 2002 ). 
Given  the  rich  history  of  research  on 
corporate  culture  and 
symbolism,  we 
advocate conceptualizing corporate identity 
as  a  collection  of  symbols,  as  shown  in 
 Figure 2.    

 Corporate Image 
 We  then  treat  image  as  observers ’   general 
impressions  of  a  corporation ’ s  distinct  col-
lection of symbols, whether that observer is 
internal  or  external  to  the  ﬁ rm.  Image  is 
 ‘ what  comes  to  mind  when  one  hears  the 
name  or  sees  the  logo ’   ( Gray  and  Balmer, 
1998: 696 ) of a particular ﬁ rm. The transition 
from identity to image is a function of pub-
lic  relations,  marketing  and  other  organiza-
tional  processes  that  attempt  to  shape  the 
impression  people  have  of  the  ﬁ rm.  Image 
can be shaped but not controlled by an or-
ganization  because  factors  such  as  media 
coverage,  governmental 
regulations  and 
surveillance,  industry  dynamics  and  other 
extenal  forces  also  inﬂ uence  impressions  of 
the ﬁ rm.   

 Corporate Reputation and Corporate 
Reputation Capital 
 In our framework, we reserve the term cor-
porate  reputation  for  the  judgments  made 
by observers about a ﬁ rm. Judgment may be 
rooted  in  perceptions  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  identity 
and impressions of its image but often occurs 
as a consequence of a triggering event. Trig-
gering events may arise from a ﬁ rm ’ s more 
visible  actions  and  mistakes  (e.g.,  environ-
mental damage or human rights violations) 
or various external events. It is important to 
recognize that the identity of a ﬁ rm can re-
main  static  while  its  image  and  reputation 

change as a result of external events (cf.  Wei, 
2002 ). 

 As judgments of the ﬁ rm accumulate over 
time, reputation capital ebbs and ﬂ ows. This 
is the economic and intangible asset quality 
that is often attributed to reputation. 

 Toward a Deﬁ nition 
 The study of corporate reputation is matur-
ing  rapidly.  Most  scholars  have  either  paid 
little  attention  to  deﬁ ning  the  concept  or 
have relied on very broad terms in deﬁ ning 
and otherwise trying to capture this impor-
tant  concept. We  believe  it  is  important  to 
pause and try to isolate the exact nature of 
corporate reputation, distinguishing the con-
struct from identity, image and capital, as well 
as providing a carefully crafted deﬁ nition of 
the  concept.  Toward  that  end,  we  offer 
 Figure 2 , as well as the following deﬁ nition:  

  Corporate  Reputation :  Observers ’   collec-
tive judgments of a corporation based on 
assessments  of  the  ﬁ nancial,  social,  and 
environmental  impacts  attributed  to  the 
corporation over time.  

 There  are  two  main  justiﬁ cations  for  this 
deﬁ nition. First, looking carefully at the dic-
tionary deﬁ nition of reputation (the general 
estimation  in  which  a  person  or  a  thing  is 
held by the public, as deﬁ ned in  The Ameri-
can Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , 
William  Morris,  ed.,  New York:  Houghton 
Mifﬂ in Company, 1971), it is clear that the 
term  reputation  involves  estimation,  which 
implies  judgment  or  assessment. While  re-
searchers  can  deﬁ ne 
terms  using  any 
combination  of  words,  different  deﬁ nitional 
statements serve  different  purposes.  In  some 
cases, language that is at odds with everyday 
phrasing is desirable because it opens up new 
ways of thinking about a phenomenon and 
imaginative inquiry. Philosophers have some-
times argued that special language is neces-
sary  and  must  be  created  when  everyday 
language  dulls  the  imagination  and  inhibits 
new  inquiry. They  sometimes  advocate  the

creation of technical language that does not 
exist  in  dictionaries  or  popular  modes  of 
expression. The idea of a corporate reputa-
tion  probably  does  exist  in  everyday  lan-
guage, but no doubt more closely resembles 
the  idea  of  the  reputation  of  an  individual 
than is desirable for scientiﬁ c study. It prob-
ably also has more in common with notions 
of  corporate  impressions  or  images  than 
would be desirable. In our view, precise lan-
guage that captures a phenomenon well and 
that  fosters  rigorous  inquiry  has  advantages 
over  both  everyday  language  and  highly 
technical language. Thus, for the task of de-
ﬁ ning corporate reputation, we favor taking 
the middle road between everyday language 
and highly technical language and ﬁ nd this 
in a careful, lexicological reading of a stand-
ard dictionary. 

 Second, while there is disagreement among 
even those scholars who assign themselves the 
task of precisely deﬁ ning corporate reputation 
in  their  research,  the  frequency  for  unique 
deﬁ nitional statements of assessment is great-
er  than  the  frequencies  for  unique  deﬁ ni-
tional statements for either awareness or assets. 
Of the 49 separate sources (articles and books) 
identiﬁ ed and analyzed, 17 deﬁ ned reputation 
exclusively using the language of assessment, 
15  deﬁ ned  reputation  exclusively  using  the 
language of awareness, six deﬁ ned reputation 
exclusively  using  the  language  of  assets  and 
11  deﬁ ned  reputation  using  language  that 
mixed  two  or  more  categories.  Most  of  the 
mixed language deﬁ nitional statements were 
authored by Fombrun and his colleagues, or 
were  part  of  comprehensive  review  pieces 
(eg,  Bennett and Kottasz, 2000 ;  Mahon, 2002 ; 
 Larkin, 2003 ). 

 It would be inaccurate to claim that there 
is something of an emerging consensus among 
researchers  when  it  comes  to  deﬁ ning  cor-
porate  reputation  because  many  do  not  ap-
pear to deﬁ ne the term or do not appear to 
be aware of how others are handling the con-
cept.  Among  those  who  take  the  time  to 
provide  a  formal  deﬁ nition  of  corporate 

reputation, about as much attention is focused 
on  the  category  of  assessment  as  is  focused 
on  the  categories  of  awareness  and  assets 
combined.  Furthermore,  among  those  re-
searchers  who  deﬁ ne  corporate  reputation 
using only one of the categories we identiﬁ ed, 
the  language  of  assessment  is  the  most  fre-
quently used. From this, we believe it is ac-
curate to state that during the period spanned 
by  this  study,  more  researchers  distilled  the 
reputation construct down to the idea of an 
assessment than any other approach.    

 CONCLUSION 
 It is doubtful that anyone today would argue 
that  corporate  reputation  is  unimportant. 
Without a clear and commonly agreed upon 
deﬁ nition,  however,  it  is  difﬁ cult  to  move 
forward  in  this  ﬁ eld  of  study. The  purpose 
of  this  article  is  to  propose  a  more  precise 
deﬁ nition of the concept of corporate repu-
tation  and  clarify  the  distinctions  between 
and  among  reputation,  identity,  image  and 
reputation capital. While the deﬁ nition pro-
posed herein is not all-inclusive or integra-
tive  of  the  myriad  of  deﬁ nitions  that  exist 
today,  it  does  reﬂ ect  the  modal  statement 
made  by  scholars  who  have  explicitly  paid 
attention  to  deﬁ nitional  issues. And,  it  also 
is consistent with the lexicology of the word 
reputation, which reﬂ ects a judgment or an 
assessment. 

 To achieve  ‘ one vision, one voice ’  on cor-
porate reputation, and to have a more thor-
ough impact on practice, we believe it to be 
particularly  important  that  future  studies 
move  away  from  the  omnibus-type  deﬁ ni-
tions   –   those  encompassing  statements  that 
include content that conﬁ gures reputation as 
awareness  and  assessment  and  even  asset. 
Omnibus deﬁ nitions have helped bring cor-
porate reputation researchers together under 
one  common  tent  in  recent  years,  but  in 
order  to  make  our  union  academically  and 
practically  fruitful,  we  need  to  work  from 
a  common  and  more  concise  deﬁ nition.

conceptual space present problems for schol-
arly  research  but  also  have  been  shown  to 
be of little value to practitioners. For exam-
ple,  Bennett and Kottasz (2000: 234 ) found 
that about three quarters of the practitioners 
they  surveyed  did  not  disagree  with  the 
statement  that  the  ‘ academic ’   deﬁ nition  of 
corporate reputation is  ‘ not sufﬁ ciently prac-
tical ’ . The academic deﬁ nition of corporate 
reputation  used  by   Bennett  and  Kottasz 
(2000)   that  so  many  practitioners  found  to 
be  insufﬁ ciently  practical  was  a  ‘ compound 
statement ’  (p. 228) that contained aspects of 
both  awareness  ( ‘ images ’ ;  ‘ perceptions ’ )  and 
assessment ( ‘ expectations ’ ;  ‘ opinions ’ ). 

 In  order  to  construct  a  more  focused 
deﬁ nitional  statement  of  corporate  reputa-
tion, we think it is the right time to move 
away  from  awareness-based  deﬁ nitions  to 
one that emphasizes the language of assess-
ment. Based on lexicological reasoning, the 
opinions of the majority of researchers, and 
pragmatic criteria, we think it is more prom-
ising for future research to deﬁ ne reputation 
in terms of estimation, judgment, evaluation 
and opinion.
