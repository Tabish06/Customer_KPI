Faculty Stressors, Job Satisfaction, and
Psychological Distress Among University Teachers in
Hong Kong: The Role of Locus of Control

Tat-wing Leung,1 Oi-ling Siu,3 and Paul E. Spector2

The  study  aimed  at  identifying  the  sources  of  stress,  and  investigating  their
effects  on  job  satisfaction  and  psychological  distress  among  106  university
teachers  (86  males,  20  females)  from  four  tertiary  institutes  in  Hong  Kong.
Another purpose of the study was to examine the moderating effect of locus of
control on stressor-strain relationships. A factor analysis of the faculty stressors
revealed six factors: recognition, perceived organizational practices, factors in-
trinsic  to  teaching,  financial  inadequacy,  home/work  interface,  and  new  chal-
lenge. A series of stepwise multiple regressions demonstrated that recognition,
perceived organizational practices, and financial inadequacy were best predic-
tors  of  job  satisfaction,  whereas  perceived  organizational  practices  and  home/
work interface were the best predictors of psychological distress. Further, exter-
nal locus of control was associated with low job satisfaction and psychological
distress.  A  series  of  hierarchical  moderated  regressions  demonstrated  a  mod-
erating effect of locus of control on some of the stressor-strain relationships.

KEY WORDS: faculty stressors; psychological distress; locus of control.

INTRODUCTION

In  comparison  to  the  primary  and  secondary  sectors,  there  are  fewer
studies that focus on job stress experiences at the university level. Research on
occupational stress in higher education in Western societies began in the early

1980s  (e.g.,  Fisher,  1994;  Gmelch,  Lovrich,  &  Wilke,  1984;  Hensel,  1991;
Thorsen,  1996).  There  are  very  few  job  stress  studies  in  higher  education  in
Hong Kong. Yet, academics in Hong Kong are also facing stressful situations.
Since  its  establishment,  the  University  Grant  Council  (UGC)  has  advo-
cated teaching and research as important elements of higher education in Hong
Kong.  University  teachers  in  Hong  Kong,  like  those  in  Western  societies,  not
only  have  to  teach,  mark  term  papers  and  examination  scripts,  but  they  also
have  to  submit  research  grant  applications,  and  get  their  work  published.  The
teaching/research  conflicts  affect  organizational  practices  and  job  security.  As
argued  by  Brown  et  al.  (1986),  faculty  mood  may  affect  the  lives  of  college
students, and the social cost may be high. Most important of all, stress-related
medical expenses, absenteeism, or turnover can be even more costly. For exam-
ple, Cartwright and Cooper (1997) put stress-related cost estimates for the U.K.
and U.S. in billions of dollars.

There  has  been  an  increasing  amount  of  research  on  stress  moderators  in
the  workplace  since  the  early  1980s.  In  both  Western  and  Chinese  societies,
feelings of control over the environment, in particular work locus of control, are
found  to  be  related  to  positive  affect  of  employee  well-being  (Ganster  &  Fu-
silier,  1989;  Spector  &  O’Connell,  1994;  Siu  &  Cooper,  1998).  It  has  been
argued that almost all job stress research and theories were developed and em-
pirically tested in Western industrialized countries (Jamal, 1999; Xie, 1996). It
is, therefore, important to replicate job stress research in Hong Kong, one of the
emerging economies in South East Asia, in order to test the generalizability of
Western  organizational  theories.  The  present  study  examines  potential  causes
and  the  effects  of  job  stress  in  university  teachers  in  Hong  Kong,  and  investi-
gates the role of work locus of control as a stress moderator.

CONCEPTUALIZATION OF TEACHER STRESS

Durham (1992) defines stress as a process of behavioral, emotional, men-
tal,  and  physical  reactions  caused  by  prolonged,  increasing,  or  new  pressures
that  are  significantly  greater  than  the  availability  of  coping  strategies.  He  pro-
poses  three  main  approaches  to  understanding  the  nature  of  stress  in  teaching.
The first one is analogous to the engineering model of stress. There are external
pressures  exerted  on  teachers  in  schools,  and  teachers  have  limits  to  endure
stress. In this approach, stress is a set of causes. The second approach is more
or less a physiological model which focuses on the forms of reactions taken by
teachers in response to these pressures. They may be emotional or bodily mani-
festations.  The  third  approach  is  the  interactional  model  that  emphasizes  the
need  to  identify  the  sources  of  stress  and  the  behavior  that  teachers  adopt  to
cope  with  these  demands.  In  the  present  study,  the  interactional  approach  is

adopted to identify the sources of faculty stress and to examine the role of work
locus of control in coping with stress demands at the university level.

SOURCES OF FACULTY STRESS

In  Western  societies,  the  potential  sources  of  faculty  stressors  include
teaching/research  conflict  (e.g.,  Thorsen,  1996),  workload  (e.g.,  Fisher,  1994),
recognition  (e.g.,  Gmelch,  Wilke,  &  Lovrich,  1986),  organizational  practices
(e.g.,  Sharpley,  Reynolds,  Acosta,  &  Dua,  1996),  relationships  at  work  (e.g.,
Narayanan,  Menon,  &  Spector,  1999),  and  home/work  interface  (e.g.,  Thomp-
son & Dey, 1998). The current study identifies the faculty stressors experienced
by  university  teachers  in  Hong  Kong.  It  is  expected  that  the  faculty  stressors
found in Western societies also will be applicable to Hong Kong academics.

EFFECTS OF STRESS

Many studies demonstrate that job dissatisfaction is a common strain that
has  been  associated  with  elevated  levels  of  teacher  stress  (Dua,  1994;  Wong,
1989). Hagedorn (1996) provided a review of studies on job satisfaction among
postsecondary  faculty.  She  establishes  a  causal  model  of  job  satisfaction  in
which  female/male  wage  differentials  contributed  significantly  to  job  dissat-
isfaction.

Dua (1994) argues that the emotional well-being of the individual was the
best predicted effect of stress experience. According to Dua (1994), job-related
stressors cause strains, and psychological distress (a manifestation of emotional
health) is one of the strains (Schonfeld, 1990; Siu & Cooper, 1998).

In  the  current  study,  job  dissatisfaction  (including  “job  itself”  and  “the
organization” facet elements) and psychological distress are proposed to be the
indicators of job strains among university teachers.

ROLE OF DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS

It  has  been  found  that  older  or  senior  faculty  members  are  often  less
stressed than their younger counterparts (Dua, 1994; The Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching, 1986). Gender is another demographic vari-
able accounting for differences in stress experience. Yet there are inconclusive
findings.  Some  studies  have  demonstrated  that  female  university  teachers  per-
ceive  more  stress  and  display  more  strains  and  job  dissatisfaction  than  their
male  counterparts  (Blix,  Cruise,  Mitchell,  &  Blix,  1994;  Hagedorn,  1996;


124

Leung, Siu, and Spector

Sharpley  et  al.,  1996),  but  some  studies  did  not  find  any  gender  difference  in
stress experience (Dua, 1994).

Tenure (Kelly, 1989) and rank are found to be associated with job satisfac-
tion.  Thorsen  (1996)  found  that  rank  rather  than  tenure  appeared  to  be  more
significantly related to perceived stress; full professors scored lower in occupa-
tional stress than associate or assistant professors.

Concerning marital status, there are not many studies conducted to exam-
ine its impact on stress experience among faculty members, even though many
work  stress  studies  found  that  single  women  suffered  more  job-related  stress
and reported poorer mental health than married women (e.g., Siu, Lu, & Coo-
per, 1999).

LOCUS OF CONTROL AS STRESS MODERATOR

A stress moderator variable functions by partitioning the focal independent
variable into subgroups that are better predictors of the dependent variable. The
role of locus of control as a moderator of the stress-strain relationship has been
demonstrated in various professions (Cummins, 1989; Ganster & Fusilier, 1989;
Roberts, Lapidus, & Chonko, 1997). In Hong Kong, it also has been found that
externals—those  who  perceive  significant  control  to  reside  in  external  vari-
ables, powerful others, or chance—have lower job satisfaction and greater quit-
ting intention among employees; work locus of control moderated stress-strain
relationships,  in  which  these  relationships  were  significant  in  externals  (Siu  &
Cooper, 1998).

THE PRESENT STUDY

The  present  study  aimed  at  identifying  the  sources  of  stress  in  university
teachers, and determined how they relate to stress outcomes of job satisfaction
and psychological distress. The present study also examined the effect of demo-
graphic variables such as age, gender, marital status, rank, and tenure on stress
outcomes  among  a  professoriate.  This  study  also  examined  the  role  of  work
locus of control as a stress moderator.

A  number  of  specific  hypotheses  relating  faculty  stressors,  locus  of  con-

trol, job satisfaction, and psychological distress follow:

H1: Faculty stressors are negatively related to job satisfaction.
H2: Faculty stressors are positively related to psychological distress.
H3: Locus  of  control  is  negatively  related  to  job  satisfaction  with  exter-

nals showing lower satisfaction.


Faculty Stress and Locus of Control

125

H4: Locus  of  control  is  positively  related  to  psychological  distress  with

externals showing higher levels of distress.

H5: Locus  of  control  moderates  the  stressor-job  satisfaction  relationship
with  a  negative  relationship  between  stressors  and  job  satisfaction
found among externals.

H6: Locus  of  control  moderates  the  stressor-psychological  distress  rela-
tionship  with  a  positive  relationship  between  stressors  and  psycho-
logical distress found among externals.

METHODOLOGY

Sample and Procedure

The  present  study  attempted  to  recruit  a  random  sample  of  university
teachers from the nine tertiary institutes in Hong Kong. There were 5,726 uni-
versity teachers in the academic year of 1996–97 in Hong Kong. A multistage-
cluster random sampling method was employed in selecting the sample for the
study.  In  the  first  stage,  four  out  of  nine  institutes  were  selected  by  a  simple
random sampling method. The institutes were the Chinese University of Hong
Kong  (CUHK),  City  University  (CU),  Lingnan  University  (LU),  and  the  Uni-
versity of Hong Kong (HKU). One hundred and fifty university teachers (about
2.62%  of  the  total  population)  were  then  randomly  selected  from  the  teaching
staff  lists  of  the  chosen  institutes  in  the  ratio  of  CUHK:  CU:  LU:  HKU 4
4:3:4:4.  (The  rationale  for  choosing  fewer  number  of  subjects  from  Lingnan
University  was  that  it  is  a  smaller  institute  compared  with  the  others.)  Each
chosen subject was then approached by a third-year student of Lingnan Univer-
sity  by  a  “knock-at-the-door”  method,  inviting  each  of  them  to  fill  in  a  self-
administered  questionnaire.  The  subjects  either  returned  the  completed  ques-
tionnaires immediately, or the assistant went back in two weeks time to collect
the  questionnaires.  The  data  collection  was  taken  within  a  four-week  period
from the end of 1997 to early 1998. One hundred and six completed question-
naires were returned (27 from CUHK, 28 from CU, 26 from LU, and 25 from
HKU) making a response rate of 70%. The sample size was about 1.85% of the
total population.

Measures

Sources of Faculty Stress

Twenty-four  items  were  taken  and  modified  from  the  Sources  of  Stress
Scale  of  the  Occupational  Stress  Indicator-2  (OSI-2)  (Cooper  &  Williams,


126

Leung, Siu, and Spector

1996),  with  items  adjusted  to  faculty  life.  The  internal  consistencies  of  those
sources of pressure scales were demonstrated in previous studies (e.g., Siu, Lu,
& Cooper, 1999). Recently, Williams and Cooper (1998) have further reiterated
that the stressor scales are reliable measures. The scales predicted job satisfac-
tion, organizational commitment, and mental and physical strain.

Six  job  stressors  were  measured:  factors  intrinsic  to  teaching  (e.g.,  too
many assignments and papers to mark); role ambiguity/role conflict (e.g., con-
flicting demands); relationships at work (e.g., inadequate guidance and backup
from  superiors);  career  and  development  (e.g.,  inadequate  opportunity  for  ca-
reer  advancement/personal  development);  organizational  structure  and  climate
(e.g.  lack  of  consultation  and  communication  with  university  authorities);  and
home/work  interface  (e.g.,  demands  that  work  makes  on  relationship  with
spouse/children). Two items were constructed to measure two more sources of
faculty stress: student quality (the quality of students is declining); and student
evaluation (being appraised by students). All of the items were rated on a six-
point  Likert-type  scale  ranging  from  1  to  6  (high  score  4  more  likely  be  the
source of stress).

Locus of Control

The 16-item Work Locus of Control (WLOC) (Spector, 1988) was used to
measure  locus  of  control  orientation,  with  8  items  to  measure  internality—the
perception  that  one  has  personal  control  over  significant  resources—and  8
items  to  measure  externality—the  perception  that  external  variables,  powerful
others, or chance have control over significant resources. Each item is rated on
a six-point scale ranging from 1 to 6 (High score 4 external orientation).

Overall Job Satisfaction

Job satisfaction was measured using 8 items of the Job Satisfaction Scale
of the OSI-2. It consists of 4 items measuring Job Itself and 4 items measuring
the  Organization.  Each  item  is  rated  on  a  6-point  scale  ranging  from  1  to  6
(High score 4 high satisfaction).

Psychological Distress

Psychological distress was measured using the 13-item scale validated by
Siu  and  Cooper  (1998).  It  consists  of  5  items  measuring  physical  ill-health,  5
items measuring mental ill-health, and 3 items measuring depressive symptoms.

Each item is rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 to 6 (High score 4 high

Other

In  addition,  some  questions  were  added  to  measure  background  informa-

tion, including age, gender, education level, marital status, rank, and tenure.

RESULTS

Table  1  shows  the  demographic  distribution  of  the  sample  of  university
teachers. A majority of the respondents were male, married, and had achieved
Ph.D.  level;  the  modes  for  age  ranged  from  36  to  40.  The  modes  for  years  of
teaching were from 6 to 10. Most of the respondents carried the title of “Uni-
versity Lecturer” or “Assistant Lecturer.”

Table  2  shows  the  results  of  factor  analysis  of  the  26  items  measuring
faculty stressors. Principal components analysis with a varimax rotation (taking
eigenvalues  greater  than  one)  was  used  to  extract  the  underlying  factors.  Six
factors emerged, with the first factor explaining 35.7% of the variance. Since it

relation  coefficients  for  all  variables  used  in  the  study.  The  reliabilities  of  all
scales  were  acceptably  high  except  “New  Challenge.”  Total  faculty  stressors
were found to be negatively related to job satisfaction (specifically, The Organi-
zation),  and  positively  related  to  psychological  distress.  Therefore  hypotheses
H1 and H2 were fully supported.

A number of stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine the
best predictors of job satisfaction and psychological distress, as stepwise regres-
sion  is  one  of  the  standard  procedures  for  searching  for  the  “optimum  subset”
of variables in the absence of orthogonality. Table 4 shows the summary of the
results when the six sources of stress were entered into the equation as indepen-
dent variables. As suggested by Kerlinger and Pedhazer (1973), predictor vari-
ables  were  considered  to  be  those  that  contributed  a  minimum  of  1%  to  the
variance (R2 change), and were significant at the .05 level or greater.

The  results  depicted  in  Table  4  show  that  “Recognition”  and  “Perceived
Organizational  Practices”  were  best  predictors  of  overall  job  satisfaction  and
satisfaction in the organization, explaining a total of 28% and 34% of the vari-
ance respectively. Concerning job itself, “Financial Inadequacy” was a best pre-
dictor, which explained 8% of the variance. Table 4 also shows that “Perceived
Organizational  Practices”  and  “Home/Work  Interface”  were  important  predic-
tors of psychological distress, explaining a total of 34% of the variance.

lecturer,  University  lecturer,  and  Assistant  professor  are  categorized  as  lower
rank;  Senior  lecturer,  Associate  professor,  and  Professor  are  categorized  as
higher  rank),  and  marital  status  (single  and  married).  The  results  show  that
there  were  no  gender  differences.  However,  there  were  some  differences  in
stress  outcomes  between  rank  and  between  married  and  unmarried.  Teaching
staff of higher rank score significantly higher statistically in overall job satisfac-
tion  than  did  staff  of  lower  rank  (mean  for  higher  rank 4 32.33,  mean  for
lower rank 4 30.17, F 4 4.71, p , .05, eta squared 4 .043).

With regard to marital status, the results show that married professors have
greater satisfaction toward their job itself than single professors (mean for sin-
gle  professors 4 16.81,  mean  for  married  professors 4 18.71,  F 4 5.94,
p , .05; eta squared 4 .103). Further, single professors had higher psychologi-
cal distress than married professors (mean for single professors 4 43.42, mean
for married professors 4 37.51, F  4 6.82, p , .05, eta squared 4 .117).

A  series  of  correlational  analyses  were  conducted  to  test  the  relationship
between  age,  tenure,  and  stress  outcomes.  There  was  virtually  no  relationship
between  age  and  job  satisfaction,  or  age  and  psychological  distress.  Relating
tenure and stress outcomes, again there was virtually no significant relationship
obtained, except tenure was found to be positively and statistically significantly
related to job itself (r 4 .24, p , .05).

Since  there  are  differences  in  marital  status,  rank,  and  tenure  accounting
for  overall  job  satisfaction,  job  itself,  and  psychological  distress,  a  series  of
hierarchical  regression  analyses  were  conducted  to  predict  stress  outcomes  by
controlling  demographic  variables.  In  each  case,  the  significant  demographic
factors  found  above  were  entered  first  into  the  equation,  followed  by  the  best
predictors found in the previous section, to statistically control their influences.
The results of the hierarchical regressions are depicted in Table 5. In predicting
overall job satisfaction, a total of 30% of the variance in the dependent variable
was predicted by three variables. Rank remained as a significant predictor when
“Recognition”  and  “Perceived  Organizational  Practices”  entered  the  equation;
“Recognition” was the strongest (negative) predictor of overall job satisfaction.
In  predicting  job  itself,  marital  status  (married),  tenure,  and  “Financial
Inadequacy”  remained  as  significant  predictors  of  this  dependent  variable,  ex-
plaining  a  total  of  19%  of  the  variance.  Further,  tenure  and  “Financial  Inade-
quacy” were the strongest predictors of Job Itself.

In  predicting  psychological  distress,  marital  status  (single)  remains  as  a
significant  predictor  when  “Perceived  Organizational  Practices”  and  “Home/
Work Interface” entered the equation, and the three predictors account for 37%
of  the  variance.  Out  of  these  three  predictors,  “Perceived  Organizational  Prac-
tices” is the strongest (positive) predictor of psychological distress.

Table  3  shows  that  locus  of  control  was  negatively  related  to  overall  job
satisfaction,  job  itself,  and  the  organization;  and  positively  related  to  psycho-

logical distress. These results fully support the hypotheses H3 and H4. A series
of analysis of variance and correlational analyses did not reveal any difference
in external locus of control between age, gender, marital status, rank, and ten-
ure.

A  series  of  hierarchical  regressional  analyses  were  conducted  to  see
whether  external  locus  of  control  remains  as  an  explanatory  factor  for  strain
when faculty stressors enter the regression equations. Table 6 depicts the sum-
mary of the results. The results show that external locus of control remains as a
significant  predictor  of  job  satisfaction  and  psychological  distress  even  when
faculty  stressors  are  added  into  the  regression  equations,  except  for  predicting
satisfaction with the organization.

Moderating Effects of Work Locus of Control

In order to test the last two hypotheses, the moderating effects of locus of
control in the stressors-job satisfaction and stressors-psychological distress rela-
tionships,  a  hierarchical  regressional  procedure  (Cohen  &  Cohen,  1983;  Stone
&  Hollenbeck,  1989)  was  used  to  demonstrate  the  statistical  significance  and
form  of  the  main  and  interaction  terms.  The  following  were  entered  in  a  hier-
archical regression: (1) stressor, (2) work locus of control, (3) stressor 2 work

locus of control (see Table 7). The results depicted in Table 7 show that exter-
nal locus of control has moderating effects on the relationships “Financial Inad-
equacy”-job  itself  (negative  buffer),  and  “Perceived  Organizational  Practices”-
psychological  distress  (positive  buffer).  In  other  words,  for  those  university
teachers having external locus of control orientations, the perception of “Finan-
cial  Inadequacy”  intensifies  their  dissatisfaction  toward  their  job,  whereas  the
perception of “Perceived Organizational Practices” reduces their psychological
distress. Therefore hypotheses H5 and H6 are partially supported.

DISCUSSION

The results obtained from regression analysis show that “Recognition” and
“Perceived Organizational Practices” are common best predictors of overall job
satisfaction and the organization facet of job satisfaction. These results corrobo-
rate previous findings obtained in Hong Kong (Siu & Cooper, 1998; Siu, Lu, &
Cooper,  1999).  Having  to  submit  research  proposals  and  do  research  in  Hong
Kong  as  well  as  the  diminished  importance  of  teaching  are  common  com-
plaints.  That  “Financial  Inadequacy”  was  a  strong  predictor  of  the  job  itself
facet  of  job  satisfaction  provides  support  for  this  phenomenon.  As  a  matter  of
fact,  these  three  predictors  of  job  satisfaction  are  related  to  one  another.  If  a
department or faculty puts a great emphasis on research and ignores the recog-
nition of teaching, teaching staff will work in a negative social climate in which
most  people  compete  for  research  resources.  This  may  affect  social  relation-

ships  among  teaching  staff.  As  argued  earlier,  faculty  mood  or  organizational
climate  also  may  affect  the  lives  of  college  students  (Brown  et  al.,  1986);  its
social cost at both departmental and university level should be of concern.

Concerning  the  emotional  outcome  of  stress,  “Perceived  Organizational
Practices”  and  “Home/Work  Interface”  were  found  to  be  strong  predictors  of
psychological  distress.  In  the  first  case,  the  research  direction  of  a  department
or faculty may not be explicitly conveyed to individual staff members. Commu-
nication  may  depend  on  the  academic  leadership  provided.  Since  it  is  not  un-
common  to  find  a  high  turnover  of  heads  of  departments  at  some  tertiary  in-
stitutes  in  Hong  Kong,  teaching  staff  may  need  some  time  to  adjust  to  new
directions,  if  any,  provided  by  a  new  head.  In  addition,  there  may  be  inconsi-
stent requirements for teaching and research. For some departments, the ratio of
teaching  to  research  may  be  50:50;  for  other  departments,  the  ratio  may  be
70:30. If the relative importance of research is not clearly conveyed to staff, the
lack  of  communication  may  cause  stress.  It  is,  therefore,  not  surprising  that
“Perceived Organizational Practices” is a strong predictor of psychological dis-
tress in the present study.

Concerning “Home/Work Interface” as the other predictor of psychological
distress, it is not uncommon to find faculty doing research work at home, even
during  holidays  (see  Thompson  &  Dey,  1998).  Doing  research  after  school
hours  and  bringing  work  home  may  be  an  intrusion  into  personal  and  family
life  and  a  potential  faculty  stressor.  This  area  needs  more  attention  in  future
research.

The  results  of  the  present  study  did  not  reveal  many  differences  in  strain
outcomes  due  to  demographic  variables.  Unlike  many  previous  studies  (e.g.,
Dua, 1994; Hensel, 1991; Sharpley et al., 1996), there was no gender difference
in  job  satisfaction  or  psychological  distress  in  the  current  study.  Perhaps  non-
significant differences were due to the relatively small sample used.

In  this  study,  professors  of  higher  rank  scored  higher  in  job  satisfaction
than professors of lower rank. This result provides support to previous findings
(e.g., Thorsen, 1996). This difference may be explained by the fact that staff in
a  higher  position  have  higher  pay  and  more  autonomy  and  that  these  factors
lead  to  higher  job  satisfaction.  A  similar  explanation  can  be  offered  for  the
positive  relationship  found  between  tenure  and  job  satisfaction,  in  that  staff
having longer teaching experience in the university usually occupy higher posi-
tions in the university and, therefore, enjoy higher pay and more autonomy as
well.  Tenure  was  found  to  be  a  best  predictor  of  Job  Itself.  The  positive  rela-
tionship  between  tenure  and  job  satisfaction  found  in  this  study  corroborates
previous findings in Western societies (Kelly, 1989; Thorsen, 1996). Most uni-
versity  teachers  in  Hong  Kong  are  on  contract  terms,  especially  beginning
teachers. Therefore, tenure is related to job security in a positive way, which in
turn relates positively to job satisfaction.

Leung, Siu, and Spector

The role of marital status on stress outcome has seldom been investigated
in faculty stress research. In this study, married professors had higher job satis-
faction  and  lower  psychological  distress  than  single  professors.  As  argued  by
Siu, Lu, and Cooper (1999), the “real factor” might be that married employees
are usually older and therefore occupy higher positions, and these lead to higher
job  satisfaction  and  less  strain.  A  further  analysis  using  a  chi-square  test  pro-
vided  support  to  the  argument  that  married  professors  were  more  likely  to  oc-
cupy  higher  positions,  with  37  married  staff  occupying  higher  positions  and  5
single staff occuping higher positions (x2 4 7.66, df 4 1, p , .05).

The  results  of  the  present  study  show  that  external  locus  of  control  is
positively  related  to  faculty  stressors  (in  particular  “Recognition,”  “Perceived
Organizational  Practices,”  and  “Financial  Inadequacy”),  negatively  correlated
with job satisfaction, and positively correlated with psychological distress (see
Table 3). In other words, the external university teachers in the present sample
perceive  more  sources  of  stress  (being  recognized  and  organizational  climate
matter most to them). Further, external professors are more likely to have lower
job satisfaction and more psychological distress. These results corroborated pre-
vious studies (e.g., Siu & Cooper, 1998).

The  moderating  effect  of  external  work  locus  of  control  is  shown  in  the
more  negative  relationship  between  “Financial  Inadequacy”  and  “Job  Itself”
among externals, and the more positive relationship between “Perceived Orga-
nizational  Practices”  and  psychological  distress  among  externals.  This  may  be
attributed to the fact that externals perceive themselves to be less in control of
rewards.  Thus,  their  ability  to  achieve  resources  for  research  or  further  study
may be perceived as an intangible goal, in turn rendering them even less satis-
fied in their job.

The  moderating  effect  of  locus  of  control  found  in  this  study  is  not  very
strong or consistent. These results are different from a previous study conducted
in  Hong  Kong  (Siu  &  Cooper,  1998)  and  some  studies  conducted  in  Western
societies  (Cummins,  1989;  Roberts  et  al.,  1997).  It  is  likely  that  the  failure  to
find a significant moderator was due to the relatively small sample size in our
study,  even  though  the  sample  for  the  study  was  about  1.85%  of  the  total  tar-
geted population.

To conclude, some demographic factors (including marital status, rank, and
tenure),  faculty  stressors,  and  external  locus  of  control  are  related  to  stress
outcomes (overall job satisfaction, job itself, the organization, and psychologi-
cal distress). The moderating effect of external locus of control is demonstrated
in some stressor-strain relationships. Our results suggest that university admin-
istrations should be concerned with professor job stress, as increasing demands
can  adversely  affect  their  well-being,  and  perhaps  the  well-being  of  their  stu-
dents.
