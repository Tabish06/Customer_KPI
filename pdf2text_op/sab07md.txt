Abstract
Purpose – The paper seeks to test empirically a variety of hypotheses related to human capital and
organizational performance within software companies in Egypt.
Design/methodology/approach – A valid research instrument was utilized to conduct a survey of
38 software companies who are representative of the 107 members of the Software Industry Chamber
of Egypt. A correlation analysis and stepwise regression were conducted to ascertain the validity of
the hypotheses.
Findings – Statistical support was found for six of the nine hypotheses tested.
Research limitations/implications – One of the limitations of this study is that human capital
metrics were based on CEO self-reported scores. Thus, the ability to generalize is limited to this
context.
Practical implications – Of all the human capital metrics collected, the number of superstar
developers seems to be the most critical variable in predicting export intensity. Superstar developers
are those individuals whose productivity equals four times that of the other developers and twice that
of the star developers.
Originality/value – This paper tests empirically the relationship between human capital and
organization performance in the Egyptian software industry context and provides support for the
recruitment and development of superstar developers.

Introduction
The world is experiencing a revolution in information technology, innovation, and
telecommunications, which is driving the emergence of the knowledge-based economy.
This requires successful organizations of the twenty-ﬁrst century to recognize the
importance of intellectual capital as a source of sustainable competitive advantage.
The ﬁeld of intellectual capital has developed in two phases. The ﬁrst phase started in
the 1990s and focused on raising awareness, deﬁning concepts, reviewing case studies
and developing initial conceptualizations (Sveiby, 1997; Stewart, 1997; Brooking, 1997;
Bontis, 1996, 1998, Ashour, 1997; Edvinsson and Malone, 1997; Ross et al., 1997;
Davenport and Prusak, 1998; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Kennedy, 1998; Sullivan,
1999). The second phase, which started in the year 2000, addressed measurement,
modeling, international cases and various levels of analysis (Ashour, 2000; Bontis,

2002, 2003, 2004; Harrison and Sullivan, 2000, Guthrie and Petty, 2000; Petty and
Guthrie, 2000).

In many of the aforementioned studies, intellectual capital is measured using
perceptual scales. Few scholars have examined empirically the relationship between
intellectual capital and performance using quantitative metrics. Furthermore, much of
the literature focuses on the developed world and concentrates on Anglophonic or
Scandinavian organizations. This particular study addresses human capital, which is
considered one of the most important constructs of intellectual capital. It also focuses
on Egypt, which is a burgeoning economy.

Literature review
The development of the ﬁeld of intellectual capital has primarily been guided by the
practices of pioneering companies around the world such as Skandia, Dow Chemical,
and Celemi. The existing literature argues that intellectual capital is composed of three
sub-constructs:

(1) human capital;
(2) structural capital; and
(3) relational capital (e.g. Ashour, 2000; Bontis, 1998; Bontis et al., 1999, 2000).

Human capital in particular represents the individual stock of knowledge embedded in
the ﬁrm’s collective capability to extract the best solutions from its individual
employees (Bontis, 1999, 2001). It is deﬁned as the sum of the workers’ skills,
experience, capabilities, and tacit knowledge (Edvinsson and Malone, 1997, pp. 34-5).
Davenport and Prusak (1998, p. 49) add that “human capital includes the intangible
resources of abilities, effort, and time that workers bring to invest in their work”.

Human capital is considered one of the core components of intellectual capital and is
a critical resource in many industries such as software development, management
consulting, and ﬁnancial services. For example, McKinsey & Company recognize that
the most important corporate resource over the next 20 years will be human capital,
deﬁned as talented, smart and sophisticated business people who are technologically
literate, globally astute, and operationally agile (Dess and Shaw, 2001).

The relationship between human capital and various outcome variables can be
traced back to many streams of research, including economic human capital theory
(e.g. Schultz, 1961; Ducharme, 1998), organizational learning (Bontis et al., 2002), the
resource-based view of the ﬁrm (Barney, 1991) and more recently the knowledge-based
view of the ﬁrm (e.g. Spender, 1996; Grant, 1996).

Individuals, organizations, and nations increasingly recognize that high levels of
skill and competence are essential to future security and success. It is common
knowledge that as individuals acquire more education and training during a lifetime,
human capital drives the production of goods and services, as well as new innovations
in the marketplace. Currently, such linkage between these human capital elements and
economic development is well established. While the economic value of human capital
cannot be questioned, an important concern among scholars is what type and how
much human capital is required to create a competitive advantage for ﬁrms (Starbuck,
1992; Hassen, 1995).


Human capital
and performance

Research framework
The Egyptian software industry is facing burgeoning growth with export sales
totalling US$50 million within a total market estimated at US$140 million (El-Rashidi,
2002). Furthermore, Egypt has thousands of qualiﬁed software professionals and has
become a major supplier of software products and services to neighbouring countries
in the Arab region (Arab Human Development Report, 2002).

There is a much debate around what are the essential elements that constitute the
human capital of a ﬁrm. However, as it relates to the software industry in particular,
Seleim et al. (2004) describe human capital as the aggregate competence and experience of
system analysts, programmers, developers and other technical personnel who are the
drivers of innovation and creativity in that particular sector.

It is generally recognized that a strong aptitude of professional knowledge can be
achieved by absorbing a unique body of information through formal education and a
set of certain minimum standards. This is usually achieved through certiﬁcation
programs in many ﬁelds including software development and design. Professional
certiﬁcates administered by international software ﬁrms are considered to be proxies
of human capital proﬁciency in this industry. In 2001, the Egyptian government
started a program to professionally train individuals to enter the software industry by
investing 55 million Egyptian pounds (US$10 million). Between 2001 and 2005, 30,000
individuals completed training programs lasting six months (i.e. 26 weeks at 35 hours
per week). These professional programs were developed so that individuals could
receive standard certiﬁcation in a variety of software platforms such as Microsoft,
Oracle, Compaq and Sun. The most common certiﬁcation completed through this
program was the MCSE (Microsoft Certiﬁed Systems Engineer).

Roberts (2002) reported that Oracle certiﬁcations offered the highest rate of return
for smaller solution providers, while Compaq certiﬁcations offer the best ROI for larger
solution providers. Given the importance of these certiﬁcation programs in the
industry, as well as the Egyptian government’s large investment in building the
human capital in this sector, we would hope to ﬁnd strong evidence of positive
outcomes in organizational performance. Therefore, given the discussion above, we
can hypothesize that:

H1. The higher the number of certiﬁed developers in the ﬁrm, the higher the

performance of the ﬁrm.

Adequate numbers of information technology professionals are a key consideration for
management, and individuals with specialized skills are in short supply (Senn, 1996).
Research in the software industry has shown that outstanding developers and
designers have the ability to produce computing and programming structures that are
small in size, simple in form, and yet extremely fast (Brooks, 1987). Other studies argue
that the level of talent of developers is the key critical factor in explaining the success
and uniqueness of software programs (Dooley, 2000). Dooley (2000) found a signiﬁcant
and positive correlation between the quality of developers and the market share of a
software product. Henderson and Cockburn (1994) reported that the acquisition of
skilled scientists leads to higher productivity in pharmacy companies. Hussi and
Ahonen (2002) found that efﬁcient knowledge workers were considered among the
most innovative and valuable assets of Finland.

Thus, the uniqueness of a star employee’s skills and capabilities is a critical
requirement for gaining competitive advantage. Superstar developers were deﬁned as


MD

individuals whose performance was four times the performance of their colleagues.
Star developers were deﬁned as individuals whose performance was two times the
performance of their colleagues. Based on the aforementioned discussion, we can
hypothesize that:

H2a. The higher the number of superstar developers in the ﬁrm, the higher the

performance of the ﬁrm.

H2b. The higher the number of star developers in the ﬁrm, the higher the

performance of the ﬁrm.

Voluntary turnover results in departing employees migrating to competing ﬁrms. This
creates a loss of intellectual capital due to tacit knowledge leaving the ﬁrm (Stovel and
Bontis, 2002; Droege and Hoobler, 2003). Research studies indicate that productivity is
weakened as turnover increases (Dess and Shaw, 2001) and that revenue and proﬁts
are inversely related to human capital depletion (Bontis and Fitz-enz, 2002).

Although the turnover rate for software developers in Egypt is only 10 percent (see
www.fei.org.eg and Seleim et al., 2005), CEOs warn that software ﬁrms in Egypt suffer
from employer loyalty since their skills are easily transferable to other companies.
Based on the aforementioned discussion, we can hypothesize that:

H3. The higher the number of departing software developers in the ﬁrm, the lower

the performance of the ﬁrm.

In the face of competitive and technological challenges, many organizations believe
work teams are an effective approach to accomplish organizational productivity goals
(Ranney and Deck, 1995). Teams can be deﬁned as an inter-dependent collection of
individuals, each of whom shares responsibility for organizational outcomes (Hackman
and Oldham, 1980; Sundstrom et al., 1990). Work teams can be conﬁgured in many
ways such as project teams, self-managing teams, and semi-autonomous work groups.
Given the importance of collaboration in knowledge work (Tjosvold and Tjosvold,
1995), it seems likely that the ability to work in a team in knowledge ﬁrms is more
important (Ancona, 1990; Campion et al., 1996; Henderson and Lee, 1992).

Heeks (1999) indicates that software enterprises in particular require effective
collaboration mechanisms such as internal networking for strong productivity. Teams
must also ﬁnd ways to collaborate both in physical and virtual meetings (Choo and
Bontis, 2002). Working in teams is considered an important core competence in
achieving productivity and shared learning. Based on the aforementioned discussion,
we can hypothesize that:

H4. The higher the number of developers who are able to work in a team, the

higher the performance of the ﬁrm.

Most enterprise-wide software solutions consist of several million lines of source code
and a high number of interactions between various modules. Curtis et al. (1988) argued
that exceptional system analysts on large software development projects were
considered to be essential, but were a scarce resource. He argued that these individuals
possessed superior application knowledge and communicated well with both clients
and the development team. They could effectively translate user requirements into

between various parts of the system (Wynekoop and Walz, 2000).

identify unstated requirements, and mentally simulate interactions

Strong system analysts have also been found to generate and evaluate more
alternative solutions to problems, drawing on an experiential base that spans their
careers (Curtis et al., 1988; Guindon et al., 1987). Therefore, given the discussion above,
we can hypothesize that:

H5. The higher the number of developers than can translate customer needs into

programming, the higher the performance of the ﬁrm.

The training and education of employees is critical in growing the knowledge base of
companies. Various scholars suggest that training contributes to building human
capital and improving the performance of organizations (Hassen, 1995; Ashour, 1997;
Bontis and Fitz-enz, 2002). Courses in network and system infrastructure, project
management, network administration or engineering, application development, and
server administration are among the most frequently offered to IT staff members.

Project management is essential to the success of every aspect of software projects.
It helps in planning projects, estimating work and cost, building a schedule and
spending plan, stafﬁng, and risk estimation. Without project management, software
development can be delayed, cost too much, and often never reach completion.
Moreover, McCreery (2003) argues that project management
training improves
participant knowledge levels as well as the ability of participants to apply that
knowledge. Therefore, given the discussion above, we can hypothesize that:

H6a. The higher the number of developers in the ﬁrm who receive project

management training, the higher the performance of the ﬁrm.

H6b. The higher the number of training hours for developers in the ﬁrm, the higher

the performance of the ﬁrm.

Individuals who have a longer tenure with a ﬁrm or in a particular industry tend to have
an historical perspective that cannot be easily replicated. The value of experience in
business is always appreciated, especially in recruitment and selection. Horowitz and
Sherman (1980) found experience, schooling, and on-the-job training to be important
inﬂuences on performance. Pena (2002) reviewed research studies and indicated that an
entrepreneur’s level of experience is positively associated with ﬁrm survival and growth.
In the software sector in particular, developers with a strong base of experience are highly
sought after and contribute signiﬁcantly to the ﬁrm’s overall successes.

H7. The higher the number of years of experience for developers in the ﬁrm, the

higher the performance of the ﬁrm.

Methodology
The present study involved two groups of variables:

(1)
(2)

the independent variables related to human capital; and
the dependent variables related to the performance of the ﬁrm.

Due to the limitations of collecting sensitive ﬁnancial data from the private sector in
Egypt, ﬁrm performance in this study was deﬁned as the ratio of export business to
total production. There were other outcome measures that were considered, such as

lines of code and function points analysis, but the Egyptian government’s initial
investment in training was targeted at developing the capabilities of domestic ﬁrms to
compete in an international marketplace. For this reason, an export density measure of
ﬁrm performance made most sense.

The population for this study was all software ﬁrms registered as members of the
Software Industry Chamber in Egypt. The Software Industry Chamber is a sub-group
of the Federation of Egyptian Industries (www.fei.org.eg) and includes 107 ﬁrms in
total. After closer examination of the annual reports of these ﬁrms, 17 were removed
from the list because their focus was more on marketing and feasibility studies as
opposed to actual software development. In total, completed responses were collected
from 38 ﬁrms for a response rate of 42 percent (see Table I for descriptive statistics).
The survey instrument was ﬁrst tested on six professionals in the software sector as
well as a faculty member from Alexandria University who has substantial experience
in the ﬁeld of software development. After minor edits were made, a letter was sent by
fax, e-mail, and regular mail to the head of each company in the sampling frame
accompanied by a recommendation letter from the head of
the Management
Department at Alexandria University to encourage each company to participate in the
study. Some of them requested a copy of the questionnaire before deciding to
participate. Other ﬁrms refused to participate in the study because of
the
conﬁdentiality of the required data. The companies that agreed to participate in the
study made an appointment for the researcher to visit the company. The original intent
was to calculate the selected items from data and information that could be obtained
from public annual reports, balance sheets and other sources. Unfortunately, due to the

the self-reported questionnaire completed by the CEO. The questionnaire asked the
CEO or one of their knowledgeable representatives in the participating ﬁrms to provide
his or her estimation about the elements of intellectual capital included in the study.
The questionnaire and interviews were conducted in Arabic. The whole interview
process took between two and four hours to complete.

Table IV.
Stepwise regression

Based on the ﬁndings presented in Table III, the statistical tests revealed a positive but
non-signiﬁcant correlation between certiﬁed developers and ﬁrm performance
(r ¼ 0:280, p ¼ 0:89). H1 was therefore rejected. Although the government invested
heavily in certiﬁcation training and many employers look for it when recruiting, the
results of this study do not support a statistically signiﬁcant relationship with export
density. It seems that as an outcome of this research, the Egyptian government will
need to wait a little longer to realize an economic beneﬁt from its initial investment.
Regarding H2a and H2b, the results show a signiﬁcant and positive correlation
between the number of superstar developers and ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 0:662 and
p ¼ 0:05) and the number of star developers and ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 0:489 and
p ¼ 0:002). These results show that higher quality software developers make a big
difference. These star performers were more productive than their counterparts and
that increased productivity translated directly to export density. This corresponds
with Dooley (2000) who found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between the quality of
developers and market share.
The results of testing H3 indicate a signiﬁcant and positive correlation between the
number of departing developers and ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 0:357 and p ¼ 0:028). This
result is in the opposite direction of what was original hypothesized. In this case, as
turnover increases, so does export density. Although this result was not expected, there
may be an intuitive explanation. Employee turnover sometimes achieves positive
outcomes by reducing stagnation, improving innovation (Abelson and Baysinger,
1984), and separating self-selected poor performers (Dalton and Todor, 1979). In the
software industry, turnover seems to drive innovation because there are advantages in
hiring new developers who bring fresh new perspectives with them. Unfortunately,
turnover still yields negative outcomes such as loss of organizational memory.
Ultimately, there seems to be a ﬁne balance that needs to be achieved.
The results of testing H4 indicate a signiﬁcant and positive correlation between
developers who are able to be part of a team and ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 0:540 and
p ¼ 0:000). Signiﬁcant beneﬁts can be gained from adopting a teamwork approach to
software development. It is an effective mechanism for collective learning, which can
lead to overall increases in intellectual capital. This result corroborates with prior
research (e.g. Clifford and Sohal, 1998) which showed teamwork leading to reduced
operational expenses, reduced administration costs, and improved communication of
ﬁrm objectives and results. Clifford and Sohal (1998) have also shown how teamwork
leads to improved productivity,
increased customer satisfaction and increased
proﬁtability.

The results of testing H5 indicate a signiﬁcant and positive correlation between
developers who are able to translate customer needs into programming structure and

ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 0:479, p ¼ 0:002). This means that the ability to understand
customer needs is an important human capital element. It enables software ﬁrms to
create and enhance systems that can be used and appreciated because customers will
actually beneﬁt from their use.

The results of testing H6a indicate a signiﬁcant and positive correlation between
the number of developers who received training in project management and ﬁrm
performance (r ¼ 0:396, p ¼ 0:014). Results from testing H6b indicate a negative but
training hours and ﬁrm
non-signiﬁcant correlation between the numbers of
performance (r ¼ 20:056, p ¼ 0:737). Therefore, H6a is accepted and H6b is
rejected. These results show that project management training is more important for
software developers than total training. Project management helps to deliver software
solutions on time and under budget. Techniques such as PERT and GANT charts
provide guidance to developers so they can plan, monitor, control, report, and deliver to
client needs.
The results of testing H7 indicate a negative but non-signiﬁcant correlation between
the average numbers of years of experience and ﬁrm performance (r ¼ 20:030,
p ¼ 0:858). This result does not support previous studies that conﬁrm the importance
of experience (Madsen et al., 2002). For example, Wynekoop and Walz (2000) found that
years of experience as a proxy for high-level technical and business knowledge was the
most important predictor of success in software ﬁrms. The explanation here might be
that the software industry itself in Egypt is relatively young and that there is very little
variance among the ﬁrms.

Results of a stepwise regression indicate that the superstar developer indicator
contributed 43.8 percent of the variance in the export intensity dimension. Superstar
developers typically have distinct capabilities such as a high level of intelligence,
creativity, and ambition. Recall that superstar developers are those individuals whose
productivity equals four times that of the other developers and two times that of the
star developers. These ﬁndings corroborate the results of Miller and Shamsie (1996)
who studied the role of “superstars” as a predictive indicator of success in Hollywood
studios.

The aforementioned results generally conﬁrm what previous studies have found
when examining the positive relationship between human capital and ﬁrm
performance. However,
important
determinant for ﬁrm performance in the software industry is the presence of super
star developers. This poses some big challenges for software ﬁrms when recruiting.
What is the best resource to attract super star developers? How does a ﬁrm retain and
train these software developers?

there are some unique insights. The most

In light of the results of this study, software ﬁrms have to devote dedicated effort
and time to the recruitment process to be able to secure super star developers. It is no
surprise that Microsoft interviews hundreds of highly qualiﬁed people from the top
universities in the world for each software designer it hires. Their gruelling selection
process tests not only for cognitive knowledge, but also for the capability to think
about problems in new and innovative ways under high pressure (Quinn et al., 1996).

Conclusions
This research has contributed to the ﬁeld of intellectual capital by focusing on a
knowledge-intensive sector (software development) in a unique international setting

(Egypt). Quantitative data was collected to empirically test a variety of hypotheses.
The results provided evidence that certain types of human capital indicators showed a
positive and statistically signiﬁcant relationship with ﬁrm performance.

Furthermore, ﬁndings suggest that organizational performance in terms of export
intensity in software ﬁrms is most inﬂuenced by superstar developers who have some
distinct capabilities such as a high level of intelligence, creative ideas, initiation,
ambition, and inimitability. Superstar developers in software ﬁrms are able to
introduce unique and smart software products and services that achieve attraction,
satisfaction, and retention of customers locally and internationally. They also possess
the skills, knowledge, and talent to meet the international standard for efﬁciency and
design. Moreover, superstar software developers help in the creation of various other
new products that may not have been planned by the ﬁrm initially. These ﬁndings
recognize that not all employees possess knowledge and skills that are of equal
strategic importance (Lepak and Snell, 1999). Therefore, software ﬁrms should strive to
select the best and brightest software developers available.

The main limitation of this study is that due to the conﬁdentiality of some of the
required items, the data provided were calculated based on CEOs who self-reported on
their own ﬁrms. Therefore, measures were not based on raw data. A further limitation
is that the study focused on only one country, and one sector and one point in time.
Thus, the ability to generalize is limited to that context.

However, we are excited about several opportunities for future research. We
recommend that this study be replicated in different Egyptian industries such as
communications and education as well as capital-intensive industries that have a long
history in Egypt, such as furniture, carpet, and textile manufacturing. Such attempts
would allow for more widespread generalizations to be made. This study may also be
extended to different software development markets that are burgeoning but
considered not fully developed such as India, Ireland, Brazil and Greece.

Finally, it would be interesting to see whether the compensation structure of
software developers plays a role in their productivity and therefore overall ﬁrm
performance. In other words, do software developers who get paid ﬂat salaries, or by
stock options, or by lines of code perform better?
