 Voluntary Social Reporting: An Iso-

 Beta Portfolio Analysis

 John C. Anderson and Alan W. Frankle

 ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the communication
 and reporting by large corporations on their social performance. Most of the attention
 has been devoted to either the need or the appropriate mode for corporate social dis-
 closure. This study attempts to assess the impact of the capital markets of the social dis-
 closure that already exists on a voluntary basis. The returns to portfolios composed of
 securities of socially disclosing firms are compared to the returns to portfolios of equivalent
 (systematic) risk composed of securities of non-disclosing firms. The findings indicate
 that social disclosure has information content and that the market values this disclosure
 positively.

 A TOPIC of much concern has been the
 disclosure rules pertaining to ac-
 counting information. Both the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board
 (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange
 Commission (SEC) have shown their
 concern by steadily increasing and for-
 malizing the disclosure requirements of
 publicly held corporations. Research in
 the areas of information production, dis-
 closure rules, and capital market equi-
 librium is manifest in the current finance
 and accounting literatures. The purpose
 of this study is to explore and test empiri-
 cally the impact of one aspect of informa-
 tion production and potential disclosure
 regulations-that of social disclosure-
 on the capital markets.

 may be as important as any other finan-
 cial or non-financial data pertaining to a
 corporation's activity. While the dis-
 closure of social action is at present
 largely voluntary, there has been substan-
 tial work addressing the need and ap-
 propriate mode for social reporting. (See,
 for example, Linowes [1974], Seidler and
 Seidler [1975], Ramanathan [1976], and
 committee reports of the National As-
 sociation of Accountants (NAA) [1974a
 and b] and American Accounting Associ-
 ation [1974, 1975, 1976].) In addition,
 the SEC adopted a set of disclosure
 amendments in 1973 which, in part, re-

 DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE OF

 SOCIAL DISCLOSURE

 Social disclosure involves the com-
 munication and reporting of information
 concerning a firm's community involve-
 ment, human resources, environmental
 impact, and product/service contribu-
 tions. This social information potentially

 quired increased disclosure by registered
 firms in environmental matters. Subse-
 quently, in 1975, the SEC held court-
 ordered hearings on "Disclosure of
 Environmental and Other Socially Sig-
 nificant Matters," which resulted in
 disclosure rules pertaining to capital
 expenditures for environmental compli-
 ance purposes.

 Many related questions can be raised
 concerning corporate social activities,
 their disclosure, and the use of the result-
 ing information: (i) should the firm in-
 dulge in socially responsible projects;
 (ii) should the firm report its social per-
 formance; (iii) does such information
 possess value for the efficient allocation of
 resources; (iv) does such information
 possess value for investor trading; and
 (v) how do investors react to socially
 disclosing firms?

 This study specifically analyzes the
 impact on the capital markets of volun-
 tary social disclosure contained in the
 1972 annual reports of Fortune 500 firms
 whose common equity securities are
 traded on the New York Stock Ex-
 change.' Using the capital asset pricing
 model (CAPM) as a theoretical base,
 equivalent (systematic) risk portfolios are
 formed using the common equity securi-
 ties of socially disclosing firms and the
 common equity securities of non-dis-
 closing firms. The mean returns of the
 portfolios are then compared over two
 six-month periods (pre- and post-fiscal-
 year-end). If data concerning the social
 performance of a firm have no informa-
 tion content, relative to the setting of
 security prices, then the mean returns for
 the disclosing and non-disclosing port-
 folios should be equal.

 kets. Therefore, the same inquiries may
 be made concerning the market's reac-
 tion to information of a social nature as
 previously have been made concerning
 other particulars of public information.
 Two questions are paramount. The first
 is whether social disclosure by major
 firms possesses "information content."
 That is, does social disclosure produce
 information that affects anyone's expec-
 tations? Second, what effect does this
 information have on capital market
 prices and hence on the allocation of
 resources.

 The model used to determine the im-
 pact of social disclosure on the capital
 markets follows the path developed by
 Fama [1970], Jensen [1968], Gonedes
 and Dopuch [1974], and Gonedes et al.
 [1976]. We assume that equilibrium re-
 turns are described by the two-parameter
 CAPM. In particular, under the CAPM,
 we would expect returns for equal-risk
 portfolios to be equal.

 These hypotheses may be stated con-
 cerning the expected returns of equal-risk
 portfolios that differ only in their report-
 ing of social actions:

 Ho: E(Rk) = E(Rd) (1)
 H1: E(R.) > E(Rd) (2)
 H2: E(Rn) < E(Rd) (3)

 when;

 E(Rn) = expected return on a specified

 risk portfolio composed of
 securities of firms that do not
 report social actions.

 E(Rd) = expected return on a specified
 risk portfolio composed of se-
 curities of firms that do report
 social actions.

 SOCIAL DISCLOSURE AND EFFICIENT

 CAPITAL MARKETS

 Information provided by social dis-
 closure is a subset of the total public
 information available to the capital mar-

 1 It should be noted that while annual reports contain
 both voluntary and required information, the market
 impact of voluntary information has received less atten-
 tion than that of required information (i.e., earnings,
 dividends, extraordinary items). Increased understand-
 ing of the impact of both types of information should
 assist accounting policy makers in their deliberations.

 The null hypothesis Ho is that the
 equal risk portfolios have equal expected
 returns, and information produced by
 voluntary social disclosure does not
 change investor expectations and thus
 the allocation of economic resources.
 The two alternative hypotheses state
 situations in which voluntary social
 disclosure produces information that
 affects resource allocation in the capital
 markets. There are arguments supporting
 both of the alternative hypotheses. Con-
 servative economists, Friedman [19631
 and Levitt [1970], argue against cor-
 porate social action. According to Simon
 et al. [1972, p. 30],

 the Levitt-Friedman position makes two
 points regarding the capability of corpora-
 tions to assume social responsibility: under-
 taking any activity which is not oriented to-
 ward maximizing profit will undermine the
 efficiency of the corporation, preventing it
 from fulfilling its chief responsibility to
 society as a whole; and, in addition, corpora-
 tions will do damage to society by working in
 areas in which they are not competent.

 If the views of Friedman-Levitt are
 accepted as correct, market participants
 would place a negative premium on firms
 engaged in certain social action pro-
 grams.

 to potential legal and regulatory prob-
 lems.

 The acceptance of either of the alterna-
 tive test hypotheses could result from two
 possible conditions: (1) the market reacts
 differently to firms that engage in social
 actions, or (2) voluntary social reporting
 is closely associated with other charac-
 teristics that influence firm value (e.g.,
 earnings and dividends).2

 If the market reacts differently to firms

 that engage in social activities, it is im-
 portant that the economic relationship be
 established. However, if voluntary social
 reporting is associated with other charac-
 teristics that affect firm value, a better
 understanding of this information rela-
 tionship should also be valuable to inves-
 tors and accounting policy makers. In
 particular, this should be a concern in any
 accounting policy deliberations which
 consider requiring (and formalizing) cor-
 porate social disclosure.

 Therefore, given the acceptance of
 either of the alternative hypotheses, it
 seems reasonable to perform additional
 tests of the association of voluntary social
 disclosure and fundamental characteris-
 tics related to the studied firms' per-
 formance.

 Alternatively, Simon et al. [1972],
 contend that there are "ethical investors"
 willing to pay a premium for the securities
 of socially conscious firms. This "ethical"
 behavior may be economic as well as
 altruistic. Certain corporate social action
 programs may have a long run favorable
 impact on profits. For example, some
 programs may help to build a favorable
 image with employees, customers, and
 the public. Additionally, some programs
 may help build sources of human capital
 in the community that the company may
 tap. Voluntary disclosure of social ac-
 tions may also have the effect of reducing
 the uncertainty concerning the adequacy
 of a firm's social performance as it relates

 DATA

 Beresford [1974]3 conducted a survey
 of the Fortune 500 firms for 1971 and
 1972, attempting to categorize on a con-
 sistent basis the social disclosure of each
 firm, and generously agreed to provide

 2 Social disclosure reports two different categories of

 social action: voluntary and mandatory. Mandatory
 social action and the disclosure of such action may be
 independent of many firm characteristics. (A notable
 exception would be pollution control expenditures and
 the firm's industry.) However, in the case of voluntary
 social action, the action and its disclosure may be de-
 pendent on other characteristics of firm value. (See
 Spicer [1978].)

 3 This survey information has since been updated

 yearly, published, and released by Ernst & Whinney in
 its "Social Responsibility Disclosure" publication.

 the necessary primary data for each firm.
 It is felt that this categorization provides
 the most consistent data available. The
 following table [Beresford, 1974, p. 42]
 gives information on the pattern of dis-
 closure:

 not subject to any generally accepted
 accounting principles. Thus, the impli-
 cations of this study must be considered
 in this voluntary disclosure setting and do
 not necessarily apply if disclosure were
 mandatory.

 Firms disclosing in 1971 .................... 239
 Firms making first disclosure in 1972 ......... 101

 The number of Fortune 500 firms in-
 cluded in the study was reduced by im-
 posing the following criteria:

 340
 Firms deleting disclosure in 1972 ............. 50

 Firms disclosing in 1972 .................... 290

 In another table, Beresford [1974, p.
 42] describes the various areas of dis-
 closure made by those firms disclosing
 social information. These areas coincide
 with the areas defined by the NAA Com-
 mittee Report on Social Reporting
 [1974].

 Area 1971 1972

 Environmental Controls 214 197
 Minority Employment 88 70
 Personnel Responsibility 64 43
 Community Activities 75 57
 Product Improvement 58 67

 Those companies that do disclose so-
 cial performance information in their
 annual reports do so either in a separate
 section, in the president's letter, or under
 some other major topic heading in the
 annual report.4 The use of the president's
 letter is most prevalent. The majority of
 disclosures reported were qualitative
 rather than quantitative, and 90 percent
 of the actual expenditure disclosures were
 in the area of environmental policy.
 Beresford [1974] does not paint a

 bright picture of the present state of social
 disclosure. The voluntary nature of pres-
 ent social disclosure carries with it all the
 attendant imprecisions and ambiguities
 of any voluntary disclosure program. It
 is not clear why some firms would disclose
 and others would not. There is little effort
 to match costs and benefits. The quantifi-
 cation of dollar costs for social activity is

 1. The firm's common stock had to be
 listed on the New York Stock Ex-
 change;

 2. The firm's fiscal year-end had to be

 December 31; and

 3. Month-end price data had to be
 available from the COMPUSTAT
 tapes5 for the period from June
 1972 through June 1973.

 For 1972, 201 disclosing firms and 113
 non-disclosing firms satisfied these cri-
 teria.

 Beta coefficients were obtained from
 the Merrill Lynch Securities Research
 Division [Merrill Lynch, 1972a, 1972b,
 1973]. They are calculated by the stan-
 dard least-squares regression technique,
 regressing monthly percentage price
 changes of the Standard and Poor's 500
 over, a period of five years (60 observa-
 tions). Merrill Lynch corrects its beta
 coefficients using a method noted by
 Blume [1971] in which all betas are ad-
 justed toward unity.

 METHODOLOGY

 The method employed in this study is
 similar to that of Gonedes et al. [1976],
 which assumes that at equilibrium, ex-
 pected returns conform to the CAPM of

 ' Social performance information about a firm may
 also be made public prior to the annual report. To the
 extent that this is the case, a bias exists towards accep-
 tance of the null hypothesis, Ho, when the annual report
 is released. The advance diffusion of this information
 would be expected to impact the market prior to the
 release of the annual statements.

 Sharpe-Mossin-Lintner.6 Using beta as a
 measure of risk allows the formation of
 iso-beta portfolios for which returns are
 comparable.

 The studied sample of Fortune 500
 firms consists of two subsets, firms that
 do, (d), and firms which do not, (n),
 disclose social actions. Portfolios com-
 posed of 14 randomly selected (without
 replacement) securities are formed from
 each subset. The use of portfolios has the
 advantages of reducing sampling error
 and increasing the power of the tests
 [Gonedesetal., 1976, p. 113].

 The 14 securities of each portfolio are
 weighted to form iso-beta portfolios7
 (Pd and Pj) for which monthly returns8
 generated for the period July 1972
 June 1973. The weighting is accomplished
 by ranking the 14 randomly selected se-
 curities in decreasing order of risk (beta)
 and forming two portfolio halves, one
 consisting of the seven securities with the
 highest risk (H) and the other consisting
 of the seven securities with the lowest
 risk (L).

 If BH and BL represent the market betas
 for the high and low risk portfolio halves,
 respectively, and if RH and RL represent
 their returns, then a portfolio with a beta
 equal to B can be formed by weighting
 the high and low risk portfolio halves.
 The return (Rp), derived in the appendix,
 to this weighted portfolio would be

 or inequality of the mean holding period
 returns of disclosing and non-disclosing
 iso-beta portfolios Pd and P,. Assuming
 that the distributions of portfolio returns
 are independent and normal, a t-statistic
 can be calculated to test for significant
 difference betwen mean holding period
 returns. The null hypothesis Ho, that
 voluntary social disclosure possesses no
 information value for market partici-
 pants, cannot be rejected if the t-statistic
 is insignificant (e.g., it falls within the
 specified critical limits). The first alterna-
 tive hypothesis H1, that the market penal-
 izes firms that voluntarily report non-
 profit-maximizing activities, would be
 supported by a significant negative t-
 statistic. The second alternative hypothe-
 sis H2, that the market places a premium
 on firms that voluntarily report social
 actions, would be supported by a signifi-
 cant positive statistic.

 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

 The entire process of random portfolio

 selection, weighting, and calculating re-
 turns and t-statistics is repeated for iso-
 beta levels of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2.9 There are
 12 monthly t-statistics and two six-
 month-period statistics given in Table 1
 for each of the three separate repetitions
 of the entire. process (three risk levels). A
 positive t-statistic reflects a higher posi-
 tive (or less negative) return to socially
 disclosing portfolios.'0

 The March 1973 t-statistics indicate
 that socially disclosing portfolios out-
 performed the non-disclosing portfolios
 at each iso-beta level with differences
 significant at the one percent level.
 February 1973 t-statistics also exhibit the
 same tendency; however, only iso-beta
 levels .8 and 1.2 are significant and at the
 five percent level. At iso-beta level 1.2,
 there are additional months with signifi-
 cantly different returns: August 1972 and
 May 1973. May 1973 shows consistent
 differences at all iso-beta levels; however,
 level 1.2 provides the only significant
 result.

 Socially disclosing portfolios consis-
 tently outperform non-disclosing port-
 folios in the six-month period following
 fiscal year-end, although the iso-beta
 levels vary in significance. The significant
 and positive t-values support the con-
 tention that there is information content
 in social disclosure and that portfolios
 composed of securities of firms that

 voluntarily disclose social information
 outperform portfolios composed of se-
 curities of non-disclosing firms when the
 portfolios are formed before the end-of-
 year statements are made public.

 The mixed results for the six monthly

 returns prior to fiscal year-end do not
 indicate any specific market reaction
 prior to the issuance of the annual re-
 ports." A reaction prior to the appear-
 ance of the annual reports would indicate
 either anticipation of social information
 or a release of social information prior to
 its inclusion in the annual report.

 Summarizing, the initial results in
 Table 1 suggest three conclusions: (1)
 socially disclosing firms outperform non-
 disclosing firms; (2) iso-beta levels of
 portfolio risk do not influence the results
 significantly; and (3) the market does not
 anticipate social disclosure prior to its
 release in the annual report.

 An effort was made to identify more

 closely which disclosing firms contribute
 most to these results. The following sec-
 tions segment the studied socially dis-
 closing firms based on two characteristics
 that may condition the market's reaction
 to the disclosure. The first characteristic
 is whether the disclosure is financial or
 non-financial in nature. The second is
 whether the firm also reported informa-
 tion of a social nature the previous year.

 Financial versus Non-Financial Disclosure

 The American Accounting Associ-

 ation's Committee on Social Costs [1975]
 identified as a major policy issue whether
 social disclosure should include financial
 cost information or only non-financial
 information. To address this issue, we

 l The beta coefficients used had been calculated as of
 December 1972. The results prompted the question of
 whether this was appropriate for the prior six month
 analysis. The returns were recalculated for July 1972 to
 December 1972 using beta coefficients as of June 1972,
 and the results were almost identical.

 segregated the disclosure firms on the
 basis of whether the disclosure included
 or did not include financial information.
 This segmentation may be relevant if
 financial disclosure transmits more in-
 formation than non-financial disclosure.
 The null hypothesis is that investors
 perceive no difference between socially
 disclosing firms that have reported finan-
 cial cost information and those that re-
 ported only non-financial information.

 Ho: E(Rf) = E(Rnf) (5)

 where:

 E(Rf) = the expected return to a
 specified risk portfolio con-
 sisting of securities of firms
 that disclose financial social
 information.

 E(Rnf) = the expected return to a
 specified risk portfolio con-
 sisting of securities of firms
 that disclose non-financial
 social information only.

 Alternatively, the market may react

 more favorably to the financial informa-
 tion pertaining to the firms' social per-
 formance:

 H1: E(Rf) > E(Rnf) (6)

 There appears to be some difference in
 market reaction due to financial versus
 non-financial disclosure. March 1973 has
 two significant t-statistics for iso-beta
 levels 1.0 and 1.2. However, the six-
 month returns for January to June 1973
 do not produce any significant differ-
 ences. The six-month returns support the
 null hypothesis, while the March returns
 give credence to the alternative hypothe-
 sis H1 that financial information has a
 positive impact relative to non-financial
 information. This suggests that any dif-
 ference in market reaction may have
 been temporary.

 or the market may react less favorably to
 the financial information pertaining to
 the firm's social performance:

 H2: E(Rf) < E(Rnf) (7)

 Fifty-two socially disclosing firms re-

 ported financial information, while the
 non-financial reporting firms numbered
 147.12 Due to the small number of firms
 available, the portfolio size was reduced
 to 12 securities chosen randomly with
 four financial information portfolios and
 12 non-financial information portfolios.'3

 The results of comparing financial and

 non-financial portfolios at the various
 iso-beta levels are shown in Table 2.

 expected to provide additional informa-
 tion to the market. However, continuous
 disclosers may include firms whose social
 performance is particularly noteworthy
 due to potential legal or regulatory
 problems.

 The socially disclosing firms were di-
 vided into two groups, 126 firms that
 disclosed the previous year and 73 that
 had not.14

 perceive no difference between firms that
 have reported social actions the previous

 E(Rcon) = the expected return of a

 closed social information in
 the previous year.

 closing firms that had not
 not disclosed social infor-
 mation the previous year.

 favorably to the information from new
 disclosure firms:

 H1: E(Rcon) < E(Rnew) (9)

 Or, the market may react more favorably
 to the additional social information from
 firms that also voluntarily disclosed the
 previous year:

 H2: E(Rcon) > E(Rnew) (10)
 Iso-beta portfolios consisting of 12
 firms were randomly selected and mean
 returns calculated for ten continuous and
 six new portfolios. The results of com-
 paring the continuous and new portfolios
 are shown in Table 3. March 1973 again
 appears to be the month of most signifi-
 cance, where portfolios that disclosed
 social information for both 1971 and
 1972 fiscal years outperform portfolios
 that have only disclosed for 1972. The t-
 statistics for the first half of fiscal year
 1973 also support this relationship at all
 iso-beta levels. In addition, higher risk
 portfolios exhibit higher t-values.

 A priori, it was believed that new social

 performance disclosure had the greatest
 potential to impact favorably the market
 and that the social performance informa-
 tion of continuous disclosure firms would
 tend to be anticipated. A definitive reason
 for the above results which indicate that
 continuous disclosure portfolios is not
 readily available. These results suggest
 that either of three conditions exist: (1)
 the social performance information from
 continuous disclosers was either more
 positive (or of greater concern to the in-
 vestment community) than the social
 performance information of the new

 14 Again, two firms were dropped due to classification

 problems.

 disclosers; (2) the classification of socially
 disclosing firms was inadvertently associ-
 ated with some other information impact-
 ing the market during the studied period;
 or (3) sampling error or bias was responsi-
 ble for the results of the performed tests.

 As noted previously, the method used
 in this study was designed to reduce the
 sampling error problem and its effects.
 The possible condition, that the classifica-
 tion of firms as to their social disclosure
 may have been associated inadvertently
 with other information impacting the
 market in the studied period, is the sub-
 ject under investigation in the next
 section.

 FURTHER ANALYSIS

 If the capital markets differentially
 value the securities of firms disclosing
 social performance and the securities of
 firms not disclosing social performance,
 it could be due to the disclosure itself or
 to other correlated characteristics of the
 firms. The methodology, forming ran-
 domly selected portfolios of equal syste-
 matic risk, was designed to remove the
 effect of these other characteristics and
 address the impact of social disclosure
 itself. On an ex ante basis, the expected
 returns to the iso-beta portfolios should
 be equal. However, given a finding of a
 difference in market returns, there is a
 potential problem of ex post interpreta-
 tion. The concern is whether the groups
 of firms categorized by their social dis-
 closure inadvertently were associated
 with differences in other information
 impacting the market during the studied
 period. Voluntary social disclosure may,

 in fact, be highly associated with favor-
 able earnings information. Given dis-
 appointing earnings, a firm's manage-
 ment may tend to avoid adding insult to
 injury by voluntarily disclosing to stock-
 holders that they voluntarily invested
 the firm's funds in some non-profit but
 socially conscious venture. In fact, the
 would-be expenditure may never occur or
 be deferred to better times. In good times,
 however, both the voluntary expenditure
 and its voluntary disclosure might seem
 more reasonable to investors and advan-
 tageous to management. This merits
 further analysis.

 Dividends and earnings have tradi-
 tionally been important variables in the
 valuation models found in the finance
 literature for equity securities (i.e., Walter
 [1956], Gordon [1962]). Empirical work
 by Griffin [1976a, 1976b] has associated
 dividends per share and earnings per
 share information with stock price be-
 havior. In addition, the results reported
 by Eskew and Wright [1976] suggest that
 extraordinary items are an important
 earnings ingredient in the market's valu-
 ation of the firm. Accordingly, the per-
 formance characteristics selected for
 additional tests were the relative changes
 in earnings per share before extraordi-
 nary items, earnings per share after
 extraordinary items, and dividends per
 share. Information concerning these
 characteristics during the studied period
 may have affected our results.

 Each of the relative change character-
 istics is calculated based upon the average
 of the two years prior to the reporting
 year.'5 For example, relative change in
 earnings per share before extraordinary
 items (EPSBEI) is calculated as

 EPSBEI1972- EPSBEI1970 + EPSBEI,971

 EPSBEI1970 + EPSBEI1971

 PORTFOLIO DIFFERENCES IN FUNDAMENTAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

 Critical t value at 5% 2.086 2.145 2.145

 This relative change calculation assumes
 a relatively naive expectations model in
 that the expected value of a performance
 characteristic for 1972 in our methodol-
 ogy is equal to the average (mean) of the
 value of that performance characteristic
 for 1970 and 1971. While there are more
 sophisticated models in the literature, the
 benefit in explaining stock price behavior
 appears marginal (Griffin, [1976b] pp.
 513-514).

 There are three levels at which the tests
 for differences in performance character-
 istics could be conducted: individual
 firms, equally weighted portfolios and
 iso-beta portfolios. Tests, consistent with
 the previous tests for differences in re-
 turns, were performed on both portfolio
 levels.'6 The results were similar. The
 results reported in Table 4 are for ran-
 domly selected (without replacement)
 equally weighted portfolios.17

 There does not appear to be any out-
 standing difference in performance char-
 acteristics associated with the studied
 grouping of firms. In fact, the signs of the
 most significant statistics are generally
 opposite to those expected if they are to
 help explain our market results. Consid-

 ering the disclosure versus non-disclosure
 dichotomy, the difference in the relative
 change in earnings per share before extra-
 ordinary items favors non-disclosure
 portfolios rather than disclosure port-
 folios. While the dividend performance
 statistic favors continuously disclosing
 portfolios, both earnings-per-share per-
 formance statistics favor new disclosing
 portfolios rather than continuously dis-
 closing portfolios.

 These statistics would indicate that the
 study's results are probably due to the
 impact of social action and social report-
 ing of social action and not to associated
 characteristics.

 1 5 This was deemed necessary to increase the reliability

 of measurement for variable change. Estimates using
 only the prior year's data as a base have the problem of
 being equally affected by last year's deviation as well as
 by that of the studied year.

 16 The sample mean and sample variance are calcu-
 lated for each performance characteristic for each speci-
 fied group of portfolios. The t-statistic is used to test for
 differences in the performance characteristic between
 our previously specified groups of portfolios.

 17 A possible inference of these results is that the beta
 adjustment may not have been necessary as it pertains to
 the tested performance characteristics. (Note: This is an
 ex post observation.)

 LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

 APPENDIX

 Derivation of Weighted Portfolio Return

 Given:

 The present voluntary nature of social
 disclosure must be considered in draw-
 ing inferences from this study. Disclosing
 firms may be those that have sufficient
 discretionary income to permit involve-
 ment in social activity. In addition, the
 strong tendency to disclose only the
 firm's favorable accomplishments and the
 lack of general accepted accounting
 principles for social disclosure severely
 limit the conclusions that may be drawn.
 Another limitation of this study is the
 lack of a more critical examination of
 information contained in each disclosure.
 This problem is primarily due to difficulty
 in assuring consistency of categorization.
 Subsequent studies will analyze the im-
 pact on the capital markets of various
 social disclosure categories (environ-
 ment, minority, product quality, person-
 nel, and community.'8 Also, by limiting
 our sample to firms in the Fortune 500,
 we confine the applicability of the study
 to large industrial firms.

 Given the above limitations, this
 study's results strongly support the con-
 tention that the market values social
 disclosure positively. The results have
 many important implications: economic
 resources appear to be allocated in the
 market to securities of those firms that
 socially disclose; social performance in-
 formation has an impact on the market;
 and voluntary (not subject to GAAP)
 accounting information has an impact on
 the market. Thus, the "ethical investor"
 may exist and, in fact, dominate the
 market. Whether this finding can be
 attributed to altruistic or economic moti-
 vations on the part of investors has not
 yet been resolved.

 BH = Beta of the high risk portfolio

 half

 BL = Beta of the low risk portfolio

 half

 BP= Beta of the weighted portfolio
 XH= Weight of high beta portfolio

 half

 XL = 1- XH = Weight of low beta

 portfolio half.

 The beta of the weighted portfolio is:

 or;

 BP = BHXH + BLXL

 BP = BHXH+ BL(- XH)

 and the weights for each portfolio half
 are:

 BP-BL BH-BP
 XH = XL = DB
 BH - BL BH - BL

 Then, the weighted portfolio return
 would be:

 RP= RHXH + RLXL

 or;

 Rp = RH(j)

 +RL ( X -B

 18 During the editorial review process, another study
 [Ingram, 1978] was published which attempts to analyze
 this impact. Due to some reservations as to the method-
 ology used and inferences made in that study, we believe
 that further work is needed in this area and are actively
 pursuing this issue.
