ABSTRACT / The extent and use of industry-reported envi-
ronmental data are increasing, warranting an in-depth analy-
sis of this information. This paper reviews the environmental
reporting guidelines issued by several business and non-
profit organizations and evaluates the environmental reports
published by the Fortune 50 companies, half of which pub-
lish reports. After describing the history of environmental

reporting and the content of the guidelines, a comparative
evaluation is made to indicate the types of companies pro-
ducing reports, the topics reported, the intended audiences,
the scope and depth of the material reported, and the effec-
tiveness of the reports as communication devices. These
reports are mechanisms to enhance a firm’s image, public
relations, and marketing and are aimed largely at concerned
individuals, affected communities, and investors. Significant
differences in the content and the depth of reports are seen
as firms report on topics that are perceived by the public as
high risks. The most complete reports are published by in-
dustries with poor or controversial public images, e.g., the
chemical and timber industries. Still, no report provided in-
formation that was sufficient for comprehensive or compara-
tive analyses of environmental performance. Recommenda-
tions are provided to increase the quality and effectiveness
of environmental reporting.

An increasing number of ﬁrms are writing and
distributing reports that describe environmental con-
cerns and activities. The objectives of these reports,
rarely stated explicitly, may include reassuring host
communities that local facilities are not hazardous,
persuading employees regarding the ﬁrm’s environmen-
tal intentions, showing investors that the company will
not be sunk by environmental risks and liabilities, and
convincing environmentalists that the ﬁrm is making
environmental progress (Naimon 1993). Additional
reasons may include external pressures by company
stakeholders demanding information on environmen-
tal performance and internal pressure by managers
needing information to better run the business (Sand-
borg 1993). Environmental reports also may present
speciﬁc information designed to address and perhaps
allay concerns of a speciﬁc audience (Forrest and
Axelrod 1995). These reports can serve multiple pur-
poses and thus vary in the information provided,
presentation, intended audience, and overall quality.

While a few studies have analyzed aspects of environ-
mental reporting, no study has provided a comprehen-
sive examination of their content and the motivations of
ﬁrms that issue them. Additionally, the principles and

guidelines for environmental reporting that have been
recently issued by several organizations have not been
thoroughly reviewed. As the importance and use of
voluntary disclosures appear to be increasing, a critical
examination of environmental reporting is warranted.
This paper examines the history and development of
environmental reports, focusing on the reports issued
by the 50 largest US corporations, and the guidelines
developed by several organizations.

History

Following the mandatory reporting of quantitative
emission data for the toxic release inventory (TRI)
system that started in the late 1980s, ﬁrms in the United
States and Europe began to publish and distribute
reports detailing their environmental programs. These
voluntary reports allowed ﬁrms to place emission data
in the context of the ﬁrm’s overall environmental
management efforts and to include more descriptive
information regarding their environmental perfor-
mance than permitted by the TRI format. Additional
impetus for reporting environmental information was
provided by the US Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC), which issued a bulletin in 1993 that re-
quired publicly held ﬁrms to disclose ‘‘environmental
exposures’’ exceeding $100,000 in their annual reports
(Forrest and Axelrod 1995). The SEC also intensiﬁed its
scrutiny of environmental disclosures, particularly for
industries affected by environmental risks (Knapp and

others 1994). Environmental reports allowed ﬁrms to
supplement ﬁnancial information with management
and regulatory information that was addressed to stock-
holders, the ﬁnancial community, and others.

Chemical and petroleum companies were among the
ﬁrst to publish environmental reports (Forrest and
Axelrod 1995), with one of the ﬁrst being issued by
Polaroid in 1989 (Naimon 1993). The number of ﬁrms
publishing reports has greatly increased, and a recent
survey found 105 ﬁrms worldwide that published re-
ports (KPMG 1993). This survey indicated that the
largest number of reports was published by the oil and
gas industry, followed by the chemical industry. Many
other industries have begun to publish environmental
reports.

Business and nonproﬁt organizations have recog-
nized the growing need and importance of environmen-
tal reporting, and several have issued guidelines that
encourage or prescribe communication of environmen-
tal information. Many ﬁrms follow these guidelines.

Data Sources and Analysis

Environmental reporting guidelines were obtained
from the principal organizations in this area and exam-
ined with respect to the environmental reports issued by

the Fortune 50 ﬁrms. The 1994 Fortune 50 companies,
the 50 largest US ﬁrms based on total 1993 US sales
volume (Dun and Bradstreet 1994), are a cross-section
of the larger industries. Each of these ﬁrms (listed in
Table 1) was contacted and a copy of any available
environmental report was requested. Every effort was
made to either receive a report or conﬁrm that no
report was published, e.g., frequently several telephone
calls were necessary to conﬁrm the status of an environ-
mental report. A few companies were contacted by mail
or by reply card from a previous report. Most often,
communications and environmental departments had
knowledge of the availability of reports. In-depth discus-
sions and interviews were held with report writers, if
accessible.

After collecting available reports, topics mentioned
in at least four reports were identiﬁed. The 29 topics
identiﬁed (Table 2) were classiﬁed into six broad
categories,
i.e., corporate policies and investments,
community involvement, employee involvement, regula-
tory concerns, pollution prevention, and miscella-
neous. Several reports contained additional sections
discussing health and safety topics, e.g., the number of
reportable OSHA violations. Often, these reports were
entitled ‘‘environmental, health and safety report,’’
rather than ‘‘environmental report.’’ Since environmen-

information and thus usually omit this information,
health and safety topics were excluded from this analy-
sis.

Each topic was scored with a 0, 1, or 2, based on the

detail provided in the report. A score of 0 indicates that
a topic was not mentioned. Requirements for higher
scores are shown in Table 2. Mentioning an extensive
recycling program, for example, would warrant a score
of 1 in this topic. Speciﬁc information was required to

receive a score of 2, e.g., data on recycling tonnage or
progress based on previous years. Some categories, e.g.,
presence of emergency response teams, were scored
with a 0 or 1. Topic scores were summed to provide
category scores and a total score for each ﬁrm.

A cross-sectional analysis was performed by classify-
ing the 50 ﬁrms using their two digit standard industrial
classiﬁcation (SIC) code. In all, 11 SIC codes were used.
Most ﬁrms had several SIC codes, and some had over
ten. A company was placed into a SIC category only if it
was among the top 50 companies within that SIC code
(based on sales volume) (Dun and Bradstreet 1994).
Firms were placed in one to four SIC codes (Table 3).
Average scores in each SIC code were compared to the
global average using a two-tailed t test and a signiﬁcance
level of 0.05.

Reporting Guidelines
The ﬁrst of ﬁve reporting guidelines discussed was
developed under the sponsorship of the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a worldwide business
organization. In 1990, a task force of business represen-
tatives wrote the Business Charter for Sustainable Develop-
ment: Principles for the Environment. The charter includes
compliance and reporting. While communication is
encouraged, its form and content is not speciﬁed other
than that the ﬁrm should ‘‘periodically provide appro-
priate information to the Board of Directors, sharehold-
ers, employees, the authorities and the public’’ (ICC
1991).

The Public Environmental Reporting Initiative’s
(PERI) Guidelines for Environmental Reporting were writ-
ten by a group of environmental, health and safety
professionals for ‘‘developing a comprehensive and
credible framework for environmental reporting, en-
couraging environmental reporting itself, providing a
balanced perspective on environmental policies, prac-
tices and performance, and better meeting public
expectations’’ (PERI 1993). The guidelines specify that
environmental reports should contain information on
the ﬁrm’s organizational proﬁle, environmental policy,
environmental management, environmental releases,
resource conservation, environmental risk manage-
ment, environmental compliance, product stewardship,
employee recognition, and stakeholder involvement.
While very speciﬁc, the guidelines emphasize the presen-
tation of often existing or relatively easy-to-collect data,
e.g., emission data (from TRI) and environmental
compliance (number of environmental ﬁnes).

The European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC),
a voluntary council of European chemical manufactur-

ers, published draft Guidelines on Environmental Reporting
for the European Chemical Industry that presented an
outline for environmental reporting for the chemical
industry. CEFIC (1993) stated that ‘‘increasingly compa-
nies are facing the need to publish information on their
environmental performance. Releasing such data is
essential to meet the public’s demand for information
and to match emerging regulatory requirements.’’ The
outline includes an environmental policy, a chairman’s
statement, and descriptions of new technologies, prod-
uct stewardship, environmental protection spending,
emission data, environmental management systems,
and contact personnel. While the outline is fairly
speciﬁc, information should be adapted to ‘‘site speciﬁ-
cations and local expectations’’ (CEFIC 1993).

The Coalition for Environmentally Responsible
Economies (CERES) is a nonproﬁt organization com-
posed of investors, environmental groups, labor organi-
zations, and public interest groups that collectively
represent over 10 million people and $150 billion in
invested assets (Cahill and Kane 1994). The CERES
principles require signatories to prepare an extensive
annual report that includes information on biosphere
protection, natural resources, reduction and disposal of
wastes, energy conservaiton, risk reduction efforts, safe
products and services, environmental restoration, and
management commitment (CERES 1992). The informa-
tion requested by CERES is very speciﬁc. To meet these
requirements, the report of one company (Georgia-
Paciﬁc) consisted of 25 pages of text.

The emphasis and format of the reporting guide-
lines reﬂect, in part, the motivations of their authors.
For example, the CERES principles, which go into the
most depth, were written by nonbusiness interests. In
contrast, ICC, PERI, and CEFIC guidelines are consen-
sus documents written by business-oriented consortia.
As the CEFIC guidelines make clear, public demand is
the overriding factor in determining what information
to include. This appears to apply to all of the guidelines
and principles. Some topics of interest and importance
to the public and prominently featured in the environ-
mental reports may be largely symbolic, primarily for
public relations and image-building. For example, re-
ports by International Paper and Phillips display photo-
graphs and stories about Earth Day tree-planting activi-
ties.

Many other organizations have interests in environ-
mental reporting and may become involved in guid-
ance. For example, the chemical industry’s Responsible
Care Program mandates a dialog with the public,
although environmental reports are not speciﬁcally
required. The Responsible Care Program has stimu-
lated environmental reporting more than any other

initiative through its goals of performance improve-
ment and communication (Elkington and Robins 1994).
In addition, adoption by ﬁrms of the voluntary stan-
dards and guidelines for environmental management
systems (ISO 1996), under development since 1991,
may enhance the credibility of some information in
environmental reports, speciﬁcally that addressing envi-
ronmental audits, environmental
labeling, and life-
cycle analysis.

Use and Limitations of Guidelines and Principles
Both PERI and CERES guidelines provide helpful
information to ﬁrms preparing environmental reports.
Each of the seven ﬁrms that stated the PERI guidelines
were used in the preparation of its reports (Table 3)
scored above average (average total score of 27.5 ⫾ 2.6
of 38 possible). The PERI guidelines give categories of
suggested information, but allow considerable ﬂexibil-
ity. The single report prepared using the CERES guide-
lines (by Georgia-Paciﬁc) scored above average (score
of 30.0). The CERES guidelines are very speciﬁc, and
including all requested information resulted in a lengthy
report (36 pages compared to average of 24). In
contrast, the mean score of the four ﬁrms using the ICC
guidelines was lower (23.0 ⫾ 4.8).

Selective coverage of topics is a major issue that is
only partially addressed by the existing guidelines for
environmental reports. A report may not reﬂect all
activities and programs of environmental signiﬁcance.
Conversely, report omissions do not mean that a ﬁrm is
environmentally irresponsible. In addition, the cover-
age of a report will be inﬂuenced by the intended
audience. To simultaneously reach and satisfy the com-
munity, environmental groups, regulators, employees,
and investors, reports are often broad in scope. Other
reports take a selective approach and target only one or
two groups.

No guideline makes any attempt to initiate compara-
tive measures, e.g., comparing environmental perfor-
mance or environmental spending and liabilities to
industry averages, those of other ﬁrms, or other bench-
marks. Guidelines do not specify the use of product
life-cycle analyses, the normalization of emissions by
production data, or other measures useful for inter- and
intrasector analyses. Other potentially useful tools in-
clude safety and health assessments and risk–cost–
beneﬁt studies. While such analyses may be technically
challenging and subject to several signiﬁcant limita-
tions, industry has begun to quantify such information,
which is often viewed as essential in determining the
competitiveness of ﬁrms and in guiding future actions.
The exclusion of
this information, as well as the
selective use or omission of other data, diminishes the

value of these reports. Although the guidelines encour-
age or mandate company-speciﬁc information, evalua-
tions and comparisons based on reported information
may not be meaningful. Like self-conducted environ-
mental audits, a ﬁrm may feel that publication of
negative environmental information may induce regula-
tory or legal reprisals, e.g., a regulatory enforcement
investigation. Selective reporting is one of the most
signiﬁcant concerns that limits the use of the existing
environmental reports.

Report Content
While the reports collected from the Fortune 50
ﬁrms are diverse, some generalizations can be made.
Typically, a report opens with a letter or statement of
environmental commitment from the CEO or highest
ranking environmental executive, followed by the ﬁrm’s
environmental policy and often the organizational struc-
ture of the environmental department. Most reports
then present information on various environmental
topics, e.g., emissions, recycling programs, hazardous
and solid waste stream reductions, environmental audit
programs, and research efforts. Many topics are re-
ported using graphs that chart progress from a base
year. Environmental spending, ﬁnes, and violations are
frequently reported. Speciﬁc topics tend to vary by
industry, e.g., the paper industry focuses on timber
management, biochemical oxygen demand of water,
and wildlife habitat, while the chemical industry empha-
sizes chemical emissions, emergency response, commu-
nity relations, and community communications. Major
topics presented in the reports are discussed below by
category.

Corporate policies and investments. This category is
constructed from eight topics that evaluate issues typi-
cally managed at the corporate level. These topics are
oriented toward the investor, rather than the consumer.
Reports can serve as a mechanism for feedback on the
ﬁrm’s environmental record, allowing the ﬁrm to apply
resources in areas of interest to investors and other
stakeholders.

Regulatory information. This category includes infor-
mation on environmental activities required by law, for
example, TRI emission data. Some, but not necessarily
all, of this information is public record. Reports provide
an opportunity for the ﬁrm to argue its side of violations
and/or ﬁnes. This information is useful for environmen-
tal groups and community members who may pursue
action, given repeated violations of laws. The primary
beneﬁciary of this information, however, may be inves-
tors, e.g., mutual funds, foundations, pension funds,
investors, and others who screen investments. Institu-
tional investors hold 53% of US equities and focus


groups of investors have indicated that some informa-
tion found in environmental reports is of interest, i.e.,
environmental liabilities and litigation (IRRC 1992).
Investment decisions by fund managers and individuals
may be affected by the environmental reputation of a
ﬁrm as represented in an environmental report.

Environmental reports may make a positive impact
on regulators and legislators that helps to forestall
future regulatory actions and environmental legisla-
tion, or they may serve to target other ‘‘less respon-
sible’’ industries. The publication of voluntary reports
also may convince legislators that mandated environmen-
tal reporting is unnecessary or should not be expanded.
Pollution prevention. This category includes informa-
tion not required by law that shows the environmental
‘‘friendliness’’ of the ﬁrm and frequently its ﬁscal
responsibility through cost savings. This information is
useful to investors and environmental groups. It also
may be geared towards legislators as most reports
emphasize the proactive stance of their pollution preven-
tion activities.

Employee involvement. This category has two items
that focus on training and recognition for environmen-
tal excellence. Reports devoted to employee concerns
help to encourage and reinforce the importance of
environmental protection. 3M’s report, for example,
subtitled ‘‘Recognizing Employee Contributions,’’ is
dedicated to 3M employees and opens with a letter
addressed to them. Reports may present understand-
able and pertinent environmental information to com-
pany managers who may not be well versed in environ-
mental
issues. Educating company personnel may
improve decisions and environmental management.

Community involvement. This category indicates the
involvement with surrounding communities, and the
inclusion of many items in this category indicates a
report geared to the community. Good community
relations and a public image can beneﬁt sales and
attract community members as both employees and
customers. Firms may consider environmental reports a
worthwhile and appropriate medium for this effort.

Miscellaneous. This category includes two environ-
mental
topics: awards and wildlife management/
ecological information. It also includes general informa-
tion, e.g., the guidelines, if any, followed in report
preparation and numbers of pages, tables, and graphics
in the report.

Analysis by Industry Sector
Of the Fortune 50 companies, 24 (48%) published
environmental reports in 1994 (Table 1). This number
is expected to increase as Boeing is expected to publish
its ﬁrst environmental report in 1995, and other ﬁrms in

Environmental Reporting by Business

871

the Fortune 50 (Chrysler, Motorola, Digital Equip-
ment) are considering doing so. (Chevron published a
report in 1990, but has not published subsequently.)
Table 3 lists reporting percentages and average scores
by ﬁrm. This information is summarized by SIC cat-
egory in Table 4. DuPont, Kodak, and General Motors
produced the highest scoring reports. Both DuPont and
Kodak are chemical companies and members of Respon-
sible Care. The chemical and allied products category
had a high reporting percentage (89%) and the highest
average score among SIC categories (25.4).

The following gives highlights of reports by SIC
category. Where possible, the intended audience is
identiﬁed.

Lumber and wood products (SIC ⫽ 24) and paper and
allied products (SIC ⫽ 26). These two categories had a
100% reporting rate and high total scores. The lumber
and wood products average total score (25.3) was
second only to that of the chemical industry (25.4), and
scores in corporate policies and investments, employee
education and recognition, regulatory information,
and pollution prevention were signiﬁcantly above aver-
age. Vignettes and photographs were featured, and
reports were less technically written than most others.
Paper and allied products reports scored well in em-
ployee education and recognition and pollution preven-
tion. Reports in both categories were oriented towards
employees, surrounding communities, and environmen-
tal groups (but not investors), and employee education
was stressed.

Reports of ﬁrms associated with timber and paper
(Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Paciﬁc, International Paper)
contained considerable information on ecology, habitat
protection, conservation and water quality issues, e.g.,
biochemical oxygen demand, effluent treatment, total
suspended solids, timber management, dioxin emis-
sions, and land stewardship activities. These topics were
not found in other reports. TRI and other emissions
data were noted but not emphasized. Several topics,
e.g., emergency response and reductions in ozone-
depleting chemical usage, may have little applicability
to this industry. Had these issues been reﬂected in the
total score, these reports would have scored among the
highest of those examined. The lumber industry, a
frequent and well-publicized target of environmental
groups,
is often at the forefront of environmental
debates, and their reports may respond to this atten-
tion. The emphasis on environmental education may
reﬂect the involvement of many employees with natural
resource issues.

The 3M and Procter & Gamble reports provided
limited information on paper and related products and
operations, but instead focused on their chemical and

packaging operations. Neither ﬁrm is strongly associ-
ated with the paper industry, and many concerns of the
paper industry, e.g., recycled content, dioxin, chlorine
and forestry management, were largely omitted. (Firms
in the lumber and wood products classiﬁcation gener-
ally provided good coverage of these concerns, e.g.,
dioxin received about one paragraph in each report,
and Weyerhaeuser listed a document on dioxin that can
be ordered.)

Food and kindred products (SIC ⫽ 20). Firms in this
category have a low reporting rate (33%). These ﬁrms
may not be motivated to produce reports given the
scant public attention the food industry’s environmen-
tal impacts receive. With the exception of Bristol-Myers
Squibb’s (BMS) report, reports scored below average
(average score of 17). BMS is perceived as a pharmaceu-
tical rather than a food manufacturer and its report
responds to pharmaceutical and chemical
industry
issues. Thus, the BMS report is evaluated under the
chemicals and allied products. For Phillip Morris and
Sara Lee, the remaining food industry ﬁrms publishing
reports, total scores were the lowest among the SIC
categories evaluated, and scores were signiﬁcantly be-
low average in every category except pollution preven-

tion. Reports were short, consisting mainly of photo-
graphs, sketches and generalizations regarding recycling
or pollution prevention programs. Corporate policies
were omitted. Relatively few environmental regulations
may affect these ﬁrms, and ﬁrms may not be inclined to
report regulatory information.

The intended audiences for the Sara Lee and Philip
Morris reports are unclear. Inadequate information is
provided for investors or environmental groups. Em-
ployee efforts, community programs, and environmen-
tal efforts at individual plants received little attention.
Because both reports emphasized environmental man-
agement,
investors may be the intended audience.
However, additional information seems necessary to
persuade investors, e.g., statistics on waste reduction,
pollution prevention, and other activities. Photographs
and charts would improve the readability of the reports.
Transportation equipment (SIC ⫽ 37). These category
had a low reporting percentage (30%), although
Chrysler and Boeing mentioned possible and pending
publication, respectively. Only about half the ﬁrms in
this category are directly associated with transportation
equipment and, of these, only General Motors (GM)
published a report. Available reports scored above


average in regulatory information, and below average
in pollution prevention and employee education and
recognition. These scores may reﬂect public attention
to more obvious environmental targets, e.g., oil and
chemical companies, rather than the transportation
industry’s indirect and rarely life-threatening impacts,
e.g., CO2 emissions and smog. The GM and United
Technologies reports were comprehensive and read-
able. While shorter and less informative, the General
Electric report was embellished with graphs. These
three reports had no major omissions and focused on
chemical emissions and product design. These reports
described environmental impacts during manufactur-
ing, like many other reports outside of this category, but
these also included impacts during product use. Prod-
uct design and use are especially important in transpor-
tation since many impacts are associated with energy
use and combustion.

While multiple audiences were targeted, investors
seem the principal audience of
the transportation
reports. For this audience, regulatory information such
as large Superfund expenses and environmental ﬁnes is
of primary importance, while voluntary programs in
pollution prevention, employee education and recogni-
tion, etc., may be only a secondary concern.

Chemicals and allied products (SIC ⫽ 28). This cat-
egory had a high (89%) response rate and most reports
were outstanding (average total score of 25.4). Suffi-
cient information was presented to satisfy investors,
environmental groups, employees, regulatory agencies,
and customers. The reports tended to be dry, with few
photographs or human interest articles, and were ori-
ented to technical audiences. Photographs and human
interest vignettes would enhance these reports and
increase their appeal to employees and customers.

The Proctor & Gamble report, one of the two weaker
reports, contained few data on recycling and pollution
prevention and omitted Superfund status, environmen-
tal auditing, and environmental compliance. The re-
port was the least polished of those in this category. The
second, by Johnson & Johnson, omitted information on
Superfund and environmental compliance. However,
this report was professionally done, globally oriented,
and appealing to employees and customers. Environ-
mental groups, regulatory agencies, and investors would
probably require more data, however.

Chemical ﬁrms are among the largest polluters in
the United States when ranked by TRI emissions, and
they are often viewed as undesirable community neigh-
bors. Many chemicals produced have unfamiliar names,
few are purchased directly by the public, and the press
and environmentalists tend to portray this industry
negatively. This reputation may help to explain the high

Environmental Reporting by Business

reporting percentage and the generally high quality of
these reports.

Measuring, analyzing, and controlling

equipment
(SIC ⫽ 38). This category contains a diverse group of
ﬁrms, e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb is often associated with
the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, while Xe-
rox and Eastman Kodak produce consumer goods and
other products. The breadth of this category allows few
strong conclusions. The total reporting rate (80%) was
above average, possibly due to these ﬁrms’ desire to
maintain a good reputation among customers and
others. (A report was received from Xerox in mid-1995,
too late for inclusion in this paper.)

Wholesale trade (SIC ⫽ 51). This category had a high
reporting rate (75%) and again includes a broad
spectrum of ﬁrms, e.g., two associated with tobacco and
two with oil and gas. These ﬁrms are widely recognized,
and the high reporting percentage may reﬂect the
importance of a good corporate image.

Oil and gas extraction (SIC ⫽ 13) and petroleum reﬁning
(SIC ⫽ 29). Reporting rates for extraction and reﬁning
industries (50% and 43%, respectively) and average
total scores (21.0 and 23.7) were comparable to the
Fortune 50 average. For extraction ﬁrms, scores are
signiﬁcantly below average in employee education,
employee recognition, and regulatory information. Re-
ﬁners scored well in corporate policies and investments,
community involvement and employee education and
recognition, but poorly in pollution prevention. These
scores may reﬂect the public’s attention to catastrophic
accidents rather than to more routine and seemingly
benign violations of environmental
laws. The high
scores in policies and investment may reﬂect concerns
with past or possible oil spills, e.g., the Exxon Valdes
incident, which raised questions regarding employee
supervision, the use of single-hull tanker ships, etc.
Many reports emphasized proactive efforts, e.g., addi-
tions of double-hulled tankers to their ﬂeet and training
programs for ship captains.

Pipelines (except natural gas) (SIC ⫽ 46). This classiﬁca-
tion includes ﬁrms typically regarded as oil and gas
companies. The reporting rate (averaging 50%) seems
associated with company size, i.e., the three largest
pipeline ﬁrms published environmental reports, and
the two smallest did not. The average report score
(21.8) was just below average. Reports scored signiﬁ-
cantly above average in corporate policies and invest-
ments, but signiﬁcantly below average in regulatory
information and pollution prevention. Most reports
were thorough and readable. Topics of interest to both
the public and investors were covered, e.g., incident
prevention, chemical emissions, emergency response,
wildlife protection, and incident prevention programs.

Most mentioned TRI emissions and emergency re-
sponse activities. Two reports are addressed to ‘‘share-
holder,’’ the apparent primary audience for all reports
in this category. The reports also addressed many
concerns of surrounding communities, investors, em-
ployees, and environmental groups. While the Mobil
report was an awkward size (3.5 ⫻ 8 in.) and without
photographs or charts, it contained most of the relevant
information.
Industrial

commercial machinery/computers
(SIC ⫽ 35). This category had the lowest reporting rate
(25%), with only IBM publishing a report. Given this
category’s diversity and small number of ﬁrms, e.g.,
Caterpillar, Digital Equipment and IBM, no strong
conclusions are possible.

and

Motivation and Intended Audience
Most environmental reports emphasize industry-
speciﬁc issues. Industries with a poor public image tend
to respond the most aggressively. Firms may feel that
environmental reports help to alter public opinion and
enhance a ﬁrm’s image. Proactive community pro-
grams, emission reductions, and information on other
environmental efforts presented in the report may
assuage neighbors, individuals, environmental groups,
and other organizations. While ﬁrms publishing reports
have various concerns and thus address different issues,
enhancement of a ﬁrm’s image appears the most
obvious and common reason for publishing, especially
for industries that receive considerable negative press.
Business beneﬁt may be the second major motivation.
Shareholders and investors frequently have concerns
about a ﬁrm’s environmental impact and how resources
are used to manage environmental issues. Some reports
appear to target environmental groups and surround-
ing communities, audiences that may have precon-
ceived notions regarding a ﬁrm’s environmental im-
pact. In this case, reports focus on these concerns, and
other topics may not be addressed.

Evaluating Environmental Reporting
Environmental reports of the Fortune 50, the largest
US ﬁrms, represent an important communication effort
that supplements information issued for regulatory,
ﬁnancial, and press purposes. Presumably, the largest
ﬁrms have the resources to develop and distribute these
reports. Several reports were well done and scored high
in most or all categories, although none could be
considered a model report for reasons discussed later
(see Recommendations below).

Signiﬁcant differences were seen between industry
sectors using both qualitative descriptions and quantita-

including both breadth and depth,

tive rankings, which were generally corroborative. Quan-
titative rankings may have several shortcomings. First,
rankings based on total scores assume that additional
information,
is
better. The importance of information may vary by
industry and may be difficult to evaluate. A ﬁrm may not
present information on some topics because it does not
appear relevant to the target audience or to the ﬁrm’s
operations, e.g., emergency response issues may not
critical to the food industry. Most topics, however, were
broad and seem relevant to most ﬁrms. Reports could
simply state that no signiﬁcant actions occur on certain
topics. Second, each topic was assumed to contribute
equally to the total score. For example, the lack of
emission data and a reader response card were scored
equally. However, individual topic scores are presented,
from which other rankings might be developed. Third,
every topic mentioned in the reports was not included.
As mentioned, this lowered scores for ﬁrms in lumber
and wood products.

The cross-sectional comparison involves several diffi-
culties. First, SIC codes may not reﬂect all of a ﬁrm’s
activities or its perception by the public. For example,
while classiﬁed in paper and allied products, 3M is often
viewed as a chemical manufacturer. Accordingly, 3M’s
report gives cursory treatment to paper industry issues.
As a second example, Bristol-Myers Squibb, a top food
products company, is perceived primarily as a pharma-
ceutical company. Since environmental reports are
primarily written to address public concerns, compari-
sons might be based on the public perception of the
ﬁrm or possibly the intended audience, if stated. Sec-
ond, the small sample size and large number of SIC
categories hinders statistical conclusions and makes it
difficult to generalize results. A larger sample, e.g., the
Fortune 500, could address this shortcoming. Third,
environmental reporting is dynamic and responds to
rapidly changing factors. The evolution and prediction
of future reporting trends is beyond the present scope.

Recommendations

Based on the guidelines and reports examined,
several recommendations are made regarding the devel-
opment and use of environmental reports.

c Environmental reports provide opportunities for a
ﬁrm to reach a variety of audiences and present
largely nontechnical information that describes the
scope and commitment of the ﬁrm’s environmental
efforts. Consequently, reports should place greater


emphasis on policy, education, and progress in
meeting environmental goals.

c Before publishing a report, ﬁrms should identify the
intended audience(s) and design the report for
them. The audience should be identiﬁed early in
the report. In most cases, technical audiences will
not be satisﬁed with the information presented for
the public; thus reports should specify methods to
obtain more comprehensive data. The use of an
Internet bulletin board or Worldwide Web site is
suggested as a way to keep information current.

c Draft reports should be evaluated using small sur-
veys, focus groups, or other means. If the report is
not communicating the desired message, it should
be redesigned. Although apparently neglected by
many ﬁrms, an evaluation of the communications
effort is vital. Evaluation was not mentioned in any
published articles reviewed for this document, and
conversations with company representatives indi-
cate that evaluations are not usually performed.

c Environmental reports cannot be used to judge or
evaluate a ﬁrm’s environmental commitments, liabili-
ties, and performance. While reports compiled
using the PERI and particularly the CERES guide-
lines should encompass the appropriate topics,
there is no quality-control system or other means to
assure that reporting is comprehensive. Rather,
environmental reports must be viewed with the
perspective that image building is the ﬁrm’s major
motivation for publishing.

c A need exists for guidelines that specify a means to
perform and report a comprehensive evaluation of
a ﬁrm’s environmental record and the environmen-
tal impacts of its products and services. Rather than
addressing an audience of the general public, such
reports would be fairly technical and probably of
greatest beneﬁt to industry itself, e.g., providing
‘‘benchmarks’’ of environmental impacts and perfor-
mance for speciﬁc products which ﬁrms would strive
to better. Guidelines for such reports should utilize
life-cycle assessments and encompass a means to
verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness of infor-
mation (possibly by an independent certiﬁcation
body). Similar to or possibly part of the ISO (1996)
14000 Environmental Management System stan-
dards and guidelines, environmental report guide-
lines might be developed by industry, environmen-
tal, or third-party organizations.
