 Behavioral plasticity theory is offered as an explanation for the mod-
 erating effects of self-esteem on role perception-employee response
 relationships. According to this theory, because individuals with low
 self-esteem are more reactive than their counterparts with high self-
 esteem, they are more susceptible to adverse role conditions, such as
 role conflict, ambiguity, and overload, and a poor work environment
 and poor supervisory support. Moderated hierarchical regression anal-
 yses revealed significant moderating effects for organization-based self-
 esteem on role condition-response relationships, thereby providing
 support for predictions based on behavioral plasticity theory.

 It has been empirically demonstrated that role-related influences such
 as conflict, overload, and ambiguity can have an impact on the affective and
 behavioral responses of organization members. Researchers have further ar-
 gued that an individual's ability, adaptability, and self-esteem may influence
 those reactions. The purpose of the research reported here was to evaluate
 empirically the hypothesis that an employee's level of self-esteem affects the
 impact of role conditions on performance and satisfaction. The research is
 important in that it provides insight into the viability of behavioral plasticity
 theory (cf. Brockner, 1988) for predicting relationships between role condi-
 tions and employee responses. In addition, this investigation employed an
 organization-based rather than a global self-esteem measure so the measure
 is framed within the same context as the affective and behavioral responses
 under investigation. Finding support for the moderating effects of self-

 esteem would suggest that if working conditions become increasingly un-
 certain, conflictual, and demanding and less supportive, steps taken by man-
 agement to foster experiences that facilitate the development of a healthy
 sense of self-esteem will be important.

 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

 Role Condition-Response Relationships

 For several decades, organization scholars have addressed relationships
 between role perceptions and a variety of employee affective and behavioral
 responses. Much attention has been given to the job stressors of role conflict
 and role ambiguity. Reviews of this literature (Jackson & Schuler, 1985;
 Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, & Rosenthal, 1964; Van Sell, Brief, & Schuler,
 1981) confirm the existence of such effects. For example, in their review and
 meta-analysis Jackson and Schuler identified a number of antecedents and
 consequences of role conflict and role ambiguity. They reported an average
 role ambiguity-satisfaction correlation of - .46 and an average role con-
 flict-satisfaction correlation of -.48, although the strength of correlations
 varied by the facet of satisfaction examined. Their meta-analytic results also
 revealed modest negative relationships between both role conflict and am-
 biguity and the job performance of organization members. Finally, other
 researchers have shown that role conflict and ambiguity can have a signifi-
 cant impact on employee strain (e.g., Hendrix, 1989; Kahn et al., 1964; Rev-
 icki & May, 1989).

 Individual Difference Moderators

 Several individual differences have been proposed as moderators of role

 condition-response relationships (see Ganster and Schaubroeck [1991a1 for
 a partial review). For example, Schuler (1977) proposed ability/adaptability
 as a moderator of role condition-response relationships. He argued that
 individuals with high ability are better equipped than those with low ability
 to deal with the demands of role conflict and ambiguity and better able to
 cope with demands because they are more adaptable. When faced with prob-
 lems at work, high-ability individuals are better able to develop effective
 solutions than low-ability individuals. As a result, the negative impact of
 problems associated with role conflict and ambiguity will be greater for
 individuals with low ability levels than it will be for those with high ability
 levels. Because competence in handling problems on the job can prevent
 deleterious effects of role difficulties, Schuler hypothesized that ability is a
 "buffer" against role stressors.

 Building on this hypothesis, Mossholder and his colleagues (Moss-
 holder, Bedeian, & Armenakis, 1981, 1982) proposed that self-esteem will
 indicate employee ability in organizations. They theorized that an individ-
 ual's self-perceived ability-or self-esteem-is a function of that individu-
 al's actual task-specific ability, so that the higher an individual's job-related
 ability, the higher that individual's level of self-esteem. They went on to

 hypothesize that "[to] the extent that self-esteem can be conceptualized as a
 psychological surrogate for employee ability, the same buffering effect that
 was found for ability could be anticipated to occur for self-esteem" (Moss-
 holder et al., 1981: 227). Their rationale, which is similar to Schuler's (1977),
 was that people with high self-esteem rely more upon their skills to perform
 their jobs, but less confident, low-self-esteem individuals rely more on their
 work environments. As a consequence, when environmental conditions are
 poor, low-self-esteem individuals should suffer more than their high-self-
 esteem counterparts.

 Specifically, Mossholder and colleagues (1981) proposed that low-self-
 esteem employees will show greater negative reactions to role conflict and
 ambiguity than high-self-esteem individuals, and in their later study (1982),
 they proposed that low-self-esteem employees will show more positive re-
 actions to supportive work group processes, which the researchers termed
 "peer group interaction." In their study of 206 nurses, using a global measure
 of self-esteem they obtained modest support for their hypotheses about role
 stressors and somewhat stronger support for effects of supportive work
 group processes. Self-esteem moderated the relationships between role am-
 biguity and job satisfaction and between role conflict and performance in the
 ways hypothesized. Similarly, peer support had greater positive effects on
 job tension, propensity to leave, and performance for low-self-esteem em-
 ployees. But self-esteem did not moderate the role ambiguity-performance
 and role conflict-satisfaction relationships. Although it is not overwhelm-
 ing, Mossholder and colleagues provided some support for the hypothesis
 that low-self-esteem employees are more responsive to conditions in their
 work environments than are those with high self-esteem.

 Despite these early findings, Jackson and Schuler noted that "neither
 empirical evidence nor conceptual logic supports the importance of self-
 esteem as a moderator" (1985: 36). Since then, however, the theoretical basis
 for positing the moderating effects of self-esteem in a wide variety of con-
 texts has been expanded. Brockner (1983, 1988) provided a framework based
 on the concept of "behavioral plasticity" for understanding the role of self-
 esteem in role perception-employee response relationships.

 An individual's behavioral plasticity is the extent to which he or she is
 affected by external factors, such as social influences. Brockner hypothe-
 sized that there are differences in the degree to which individuals attend and
 react to external cues, and as a consequence, external environmental factors
 affect their attitudes and behaviors differently. Brockner's (1983, 1988) the-
 orizing is consistent with that of Mossholder and colleagues (1981, 1982) but
 is much more comprehensive. What the latter termed reactivity, Brockner
 essentially terms plasticity. Given the greater depth, scope, and recency of
 Brockner's work, we used the term plasticity to indicate this phenomenon.
 The degree of an individual's behavioral plasticity could conceivably be
 associated with any number of stable individual characteristics. Brockner
 (1988) focused on self-esteem as one major cause of observed variation in
 plasticity. According to Brockner, people with low self-esteem are more

 behaviorally plastic (reactive) than those with high self-esteem because the
 former tend to be more yielding to external cues. One attribute of low-self-
 esteem individuals is that they seek out and respond to events in their
 environments. Brockner (1983) noted that social psychology provides three
 perspectives on the proposed inverse relationship between self-esteem and
 behavioral plasticity. Low-self-esteem individuals may be highly likely to (1)
 experience uncertainty as to the correctness of their thoughts and feelings
 and thus rely upon social cues, (2) seek acceptance and approval from others
 through conforming attitudinally or behaviorally, or both, with the latter's
 expectations as a result of a low level of self-acceptance and approval, and
 (3) be highly self-diagnostic and allow negative feedback in one area to
 generalize to other parts of the self and domains of personal activity. To-
 gether, these three psychological processes may help to explain why work-
 place events are more likely to influence low-self-esteem individuals than
 high-self-esteem individuals. In sum, according to behavioral plasticity the-
 ory, low-self-esteem individuals are more reactive than their high-self-
 esteem counterparts and are therefore more susceptible to characteristics of
 environmental events, for better or worse. Thus, plasticity differs from social
 desirability motivation, which reflects the desire to behave in ways that are
 acceptable to others, and locus of control beliefs concerning whether one is
 in control of or controlled by one's environment. Behavioral plasticity is a
 dimension of behavior and provides a conceptual framework for interpreting
 the results of studies like Mossholder and colleagues (1981, 1982). Motiva-
 tion to behave in a socially desirable manner and a belief in the external
 determination of behavior, or both, could underline the plasticity of behav-
 ior. They are not, however, descriptions of the behavior itself, but rather are
 possible causes of plasticity.

 Ganster and Schaubroeck (1991b) used and expanded plasticity theory
 as a basis for examining the moderating effects of self-esteem on role stress-
 health relationships. Specifically, Ganster and Schaubroeck hypothesized
 that not only will low-self-esteem employees be more susceptible (reactive)
 to the deleterious effects of role conflict and ambiguity than high-self-esteem
 employees, but they will also more likely be passive in coping with these
 stressors. Low-self-esteem employees will react more strongly to negative
 cues in their environments than those with high self-esteem and also be less
 likely to take constructive actions to mitigate the effects of those cues. The
 authors suggested that this passivity, in conjunction with low self-perceived
 competence, would produce a "chronic state of frustration and tension that
 is expected to lead to the development of somatic complaints and ill-health"
 (Ganster & Schaubroeck, 1991b: 352). Their study of 157 fire fighters par-
 tially supported their hypotheses. Global self-esteem moderated the effects
 of role conflict on somatic complaints but not the effects of role ambiguity.
 In sum, in both the Mossholder and colleagues (1981, 1982) and Ganster
 and Schaubroeck (1991b) studies, global self-esteem measures provided
 some support for the basic premise that low-self-esteem individuals

 react more than high-self-esteem individuals to the quality of their work
 environments.

 The purposes of this investigation were to test the self-esteem-
 behavioral plasticity hypothesis and to replicate and extend Mossholder and
 colleagues' (1981, 1982) and Ganster and Schaubroeck's (1991b) investiga-
 tions. Our study differs in two important ways from this earlier research.
 First, we examined an organization-based measure of self-esteem instead of
 a global measure. Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) reflects

 The degree to which organizational members believe that they
 can satisfy their needs by participating in roles within the con-
 text of the organization. People with high OBSE have a sense of
 personal adequacy as organizational members and a sense of
 having satisfied needs from their organizational roles in the past.
 Thus, organization-based self-esteem reflects the self-perceived
 value that individuals have of themselves as organizational
 members acting within an organizational context. As a result,
 employees with high OBSE should perceive themselves as im-
 portant, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile within their em-
 ploying organization (Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, & Dunham,
 1989: 625).

 We expected to obtain more consistent moderating effects with the or-
 ganization-based measure because, as our earlier research (Pierce et al.,
 1989) demonstrated, the relationships between various measures are stron-
 ger when they are drawn from a common frame of reference. The fact that
 earlier studies used global measures of self-esteem to predict organization-
 based dependent variables may in part explain the lack of consistency in
 their findings. We expect relationships to be more consistent when all con-
 structs are measured within the same frame of reference.

 A second purpose of this study was to look at indicators of the quality
 of role conditions besides role conflict and role ambiguity. In addition to
 those indicators, we examined the effects of role overload, work environ-
 ment support, and supervisory support on measures of satisfaction and per-
 formance, which are described in detail below. Our basic premise was that
 organization-based self-esteem will moderate the effects of role condition
 quality on employee performance and job satisfaction. We reasoned that
 low-self-esteem organization members, because of their higher reactivity to
 negative external cues and passivity about changing them, will respond
 more negatively to poor role conditions than will high-self-esteem individ-
 uals, and that the latter will be relatively unresponsive to poor role condi-
 tions. In the case of role overload, it can be argued, as did Ganster and
 Schaubroeck (1991b), that individuals with low organization-based self-
 esteem will passively accept their situation, resulting in dissatisfaction and
 poor performance. Similarly, if work environment support (equipment, in-
 formation, and so forth) is inadequate, those individuals are less likely than
 people with high organization-based self-esteem to try to influence their

 environments (Brockner, 1988) so that they can accomplish their assigned
 tasks. As a result, they become dissatisfied, and their performance suffers for
 lack of needed support. Finally, if individuals with low organization-based
 self-esteem receive poor direction and support from their supervisors, they
 are likely to manifest dissatisfaction and poor performance because of their
 tendencies to (1) fixate on any negative social cues in the environment and
 (2) passively accept the lack of needed support.

 In sum, we predicted that

 Hypothesis 1: Organization-based self-esteem will mod-
 erate the relationships between role ambiguity and satis-
 faction and performance: Individuals with low self-
 esteem will react more negatively to role ambiguity than
 those with high self-esteem, with lower satisfaction and
 performance as outcomes.
 Hypothesis 2: Organization-based self-esteem will mod-
 erate the relationships between role conflict and satisfac-
 tion and performance: Individuals with low self-esteem
 will react more negatively to role conflict than those with
 high self-esteem, with lower satisfaction and performance
 as outcomes.

 Hypothesis 3: Organization-based self-esteem will mod-
 erate the relationships between role overload and satis-
 faction and performance: Individuals with low self-
 esteem will react more negatively to role overload than
 those with high self-esteem, with lower satisfaction and
 performance as outcomes.
 Hypothesis 4: Organization-based self-esteem will mod-
 erate the relationships between work environment sup-
 port and satisfaction and performance: Individuals with
 low self-esteem will react more negatively to low support
 than those with high self-esteem, with lower satisfaction
 and performance as outcomes.
 Hypothesis 5: Organization-based self-esteem will mod-
 erate the relationships between supervisor support and
 satisfaction and performance: Individuals with low self-
 esteem will react more negatively to low support than
 those with high self-esteem, with lower satisfaction and
 performance as outcomes.

 Study Design and Respondents

 METHODS

 This study was conducted in two phases in the power systems division
 of a midwestern electrical utility. At time 1, we invited every employee in

 the division to participate in a division-based organizational survey. Of
 those employees, 186 completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. The
 group consisted largely of men (87%) and spanned four hierarchical levels,
 including managerial-supervisory, administrative, and engineering employ-
 ees. It represented approximately 90 percent of the division's professional
 employees. This first survey, administered during job release time, collected
 data pertaining to all the study's self-report variables: perceptions of role
 conditions, OBSE, and satisfaction. The actual items and scales used repre-
 sented a balance between our needs for construct-valid measures and the
 desires of the organization's management for a short survey instrument. For
 this reason, we by necessity specifically designed some items for use in this
 study.

 The second data collection, undertaken approximately eight months
 after time 1, was an effort to collect independent data on performance. The
 immediate supervisor (N = 23) of each of the 186 time 1 respondents was
 asked to provide a behavioral assessment of the employee. We instructed the
 supervisors to focus on the employee during the past three to four months
 and to describe his or her behavior on several dimensions. We chose the
 three-four month time period in hopes of capturing an assessment of em-
 ployee performance that would be more representative than an assessment
 of behavior on a particular day. In addition, we wanted the measures to
 reflect behaviors that occurred after the antecedent variables had been mea-
 sured, but not so long after that role conditions or OBSE would have had a
 high probability of changing. It was not feasible to collect the satisfaction
 data at time 2.

 Of the 23 supervisors, 19 provided assessments of the effectiveness with
 which the study respondents executed each of ten managerial-administra-
 tive behaviors, yielding behavioral data on 145 of the original 186 respon-
 dents (78%). Data provided by a manager for more than one subordinate
 would, of course, not be independent. However, inasmuch as these ratings
 are predicted by data from other sources (the respondents), this lack of
 independence should not pose a problem. There was no indication that
 differences in standards of evaluation affected managers, in part because of
 the design of the performance rating form.

 Measures

 Role conditions. Several variables, including role conflict, role ambigu-
 ity, role overload, work environment support, and supervisory support, were
 assessed in an attempt to measure a variety of role conditions experienced by
 employees. The Michigan Assessment of Organizations survey (MAO; Insti-
 tute for Social Research, 1975), developed over a number of years at the
 University of Michigan (cf. Nadler, Jenkins, Cammann, & Lawler, 1975),
 served as our major measure of role condition perceptions. We used MAO
 subscales to measure role ambiguity (three items; an example is the reverse-
 scored "I can usually predict what others will expect of me on my job"); role
 conflict (four items; e.g., "To satisfy some people on my job, I have to upset

 others"); and role overload (four items, e.g., "I never seem to have enough
 time to get things done"). Each of these three variables was measured by
 using a seven-point Likert scale with anchors ranging from "strongly dis-
 agree" to "strongly agree." Coefficient alphas were .63, .60, and .76 for role
 ambiguity, conflict, and overload, respectively. Although low for practical
 applications, these reliabilities are sufficiently high for research use, though
 two are below the .70 recommended by Nunnally (1967).

 The degree to which employees experienced their work environments
 as supporting work performance was also examined. Items assessing ade-
 quacy of experienced skills and training, information, work assignments,
 work procedures, and resources were summed to provide an assessment of
 overall work environment support. We took two of these dimensions from
 the MAO; for skills and training adequacy, items included "I do not have
 enough training to do my job well" and "I need more training in order to
 perform my job really well"; for resource adequacy, items included "I have
 difficulty getting the tools, equipment, and/or supplies that I need to perform
 my job," "I frequently have to stop working to get the things that I need to
 perform my job," and "Tasks are frequently assigned to me for which I do not
 have adequate tools, equipment, and/or supplies." These items employed
 response scales anchored 1, "strongly disagree," and 5, "strongly agree."

 Using the MAO format, we developed additional scales measuring the
 perceived adequacy of information, work assignments, and work procedures
 to meet the needs of the host organization. Information adequacy was as-
 sessed with five items; examples are "I generally have sufficient information
 to make correct decisions and to perform my job," "I often have to wait for
 information from other people before I can make a decision and/or perform
 my job well," and "I have trouble getting the facts and information that I
 need to do my job well." Work assignment adequacy was also measured by
 five items; examples are "Tasks are frequently assigned to me that I do not
 have the skills to perform," "Tasks are frequently assigned to me that I do not
 have the time to perform," and "The way work is assigned to individuals or
 groups contributes to poor job performance." Work procedure adequacy was
 assessed with these three items: "Work procedures frequently prevent me
 from performing my job well," "The procedures that have been developed
 that control the performance of my job frequently get in the way of my job
 performance," and "Many of the work procedures that regulate the perfor-
 mance of my job provide me with valuable assistance."

 A principal component factor analysis of the five work environment
 support dimensions was performed. Inspection of the eigenvalues, which
 were 2.42, .97, .66, .52, and .43, application of the greater-than-one eigen-
 value decision rule, and results of a scree test suggested that a one-factor
 solution was appropriate. Factor loadings were .69, .79, .74, .48, and .73 for
 the five dimensions. We summed all the items assessing the degree to which
 these nonhuman aspects of the work environment were experienced as fa-
 cilitating work performance to form the overall work environment support
 measure (ot = .85). The evidence from these analyses suggests that the new

 items tap the same domain as the original, construct-validated items taken
 from the MAO.

 Supervisory role support was measured with a set of items also taken
 from the MAO. Overall supervisory support represents the aggregation of
 items measuring the following supervisory behaviors: role support, personal
 support, goal clarity, work facilitation, and protection. Each variable was
 measured on a seven-point Likert scale anchored "strongly disagree" to
 "strongly agree." Coefficient alpha was .94 for this measure, suggesting that
 analyzing the subscales separately would not likely produce different re-
 sults.

 Self-esteem. Organization-based self-esteem was measured with the 10-
 item instrument developed and validated in our earlier work (Pierce et al.,
 1989). Coefficient alpha was .90 for OBSE in the present study.

 Work behavior. Role performance was assessed through a simple addi-
 tive model based on a supervisory assessment of the employees' perfor-
 mance of ten specific administrative-managerial behaviors, including deci-
 sion making, administering, supervising, and coordinating. These behaviors
 were appraised on a response scale ranging from 7, "completely unaccept-
 able," to 1, "exceptionally good." We took this behavioral appraisal instru-
 ment from Tornow and Pinto's (1976) Management Position Description
 Questionnaire, as modified and validated by Castaneda (1988) and Cas-
 taneda and Johnson (1989).

 Affect. Achievement satisfaction was measured with two items. Em-
 ploying the Dunham and Herman (1975) modification of the Kunin (1955)
 "faces" scales, the respondents answered the following two questions; rat-
 ings were subsequently combined through a simple additive model: "Con-
 sider your accomplishments at [name of organization]. Identify the face that
 best expresses how you feel about your accomplishments while an employee
 here at _ " and "Consider your history of successes and failures here
 at _ . Identify the face that best expresses how you feel about your overall
 success history at ."

 RESULTS

 Moderated hierarchical regression analysis was employed to examine
 the moderating effects of organization-based self-esteem on the relationships
 between role conditions and employee satisfaction and performance.

 Table 1 presents the intercorrelations and descriptive statistics for all
 the study variables. Of note in Table 1 are the correlations between OBSE
 and its previously hypothesized antecedents and consequences (Pierce et al.,
 1989), though those variables were not the focus of the present study. Con-
 ditions in the work environment that suggest employee experiences of sup-
 port and trust, namely work environment support, supervisor support, and
 lack of ambiguity, were all positively correlated with OBSE, as expected.
 Similarly, role performance and achievement satisfaction, two expected con-
 sequences of OBSE, correlated significantly with the self-esteem measure.

 Table 2 presents results from the moderated hierarchical regression tests
 of hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 predicts that organization-based self-esteem
 will have a moderating effect on role ambiguity-role response relationships.
 The interaction of OBSE and ambiguity had significant effects on both of the
 study's dependent variables, supporting Hypothesis 1. We plotted the sig-
 nificant interactions using procedures outlined in Cohen and Cohen (1975).
 In each case, the relationship between role ambiguity and the satisfaction
 and performance dependent variables was negative for respondents with
 low OBSE and relatively flat for those with high OBSE (see Figure 1). Indi-
 viduals with low organization-based self-esteem performed worse when
 they perceived high levels of ambiguity than did those with high OBSE.

 Hypothesis 2 predicts that organization-based self-esteem will have a
 moderating effect on role conflict-role response relationships. The interac-
 tion of OBSE and conflict significantly affected the dependent variable mea-
 suring satisfaction but did not significantly affect performance. When plot-
 ted, these interactions indicated negative relationships between conflict and
 satisfaction for individuals with low OBSE and relatively flat ones for those
 with high OBSE. The lack of effects on performance may in part be due to the
 low internal consistency of the role conflict measure, which results in low
 statistical power.

 Hypothesis 3 predicts that organization-based self-esteem will have a
 moderating effect on role overload-role response relationships. Results for
 Hypothesis 3 were almost identical to those for Hypothesis 2. Interactions of

 OBSE and overload had significant effects on satisfaction but not on perfor-
 mance. When plotted, these interactions indicated a negative relationship
 between overload and satisfaction for those with low OBSE and a relatively
 flat one for those with high OBSE. As with role conflict, the lack of effects on
 performance may in part be due to the low internal consistency of the role
 overload measure.

 OBSE and work environment support had significant effects on both of the
 study's dependent variables. When plotted, these interactions indicated that
 the relationships between support and satisfaction and performance were
 positive for those with low OBSE and relatively flat for those with high
 OBSE. In other words, the former were more satisfied and performed better
 when they perceived their work environment as being supportive of their
 work efforts than when they didn't.

 Hypothesis 5 predicts that organization-based self-esteem will moderate
 supervisor support-role response relationships. The results for Hypothesis
 5 were similar to those for Hypothesis 4. The interactions of OBSE and
 supervisor support had significant effects on all the study's dependent vari-
 ables. When plotted, these interactions indicated that the relationships be-
 tween supervisor support and satisfaction and performance were positive for
 people with low OBSE and relatively flat for those with high ratings on the
 variable; this pattern was more true for performance than for satisfaction.
 People with low OBSE were more satisfied and performed better when they
 perceived their supervisors as supporting their work efforts than when they
 didn't.

 In sum, the results of eight of the ten regression tests supported the
 study's five hypotheses. We consider those results supportive of our predic-
 tion that measuring self-esteem in an organizational frame of reference
 would produce consistent relationships with other organization-relevant
 measures. However, it should be noted that the interactions generally ac-
 counted for small amounts of dependent variable variance. This is not un-
 usual in moderated regression analyses because the test of the interaction
 term is a conservative one: it reflects predicted variance left over after the
 stronger main effects have been "partialled out" (Cohen & Cohen, 1975).
 Moreover, effect sizes underestimate true effects when they accumulate over
 time (Abelson, 1985). It should also be noted that there were more consistent
 effects on satisfaction than on performance, which would be expected given
 that we collected satisfaction ratings from the same source as the predictor
 variables, at the same time.

 DISCUSSION

 To the extent that conclusions can be made from correlational data, our
 results generally support the hypothesis that individuals with low self-
 esteem, when compared to people with high self-esteem, react with greater
 intensity to characteristics of their work environments, whether those char-
 acteristics are good (a supportive supervisor) or bad (role conflict). Our re-
 sults are also consistent with Ganster and Schaubroeck's (1991b) elaboration
 of plasticity theory. It would appear that low-self-esteem employees may
 well cope passively with the problems in their work environments. In our
 study, the most consistent moderating effects on performance involved
 OBSE and environmental and supervisory support. If employees with low
 organization-based self-esteem do indeed passively accept lack of the sup-
 port and resources needed to perform their jobs, it seems logical that per-

 formance levels would suffer. If employees with high OBSE respond to such
 conditions by attempting to acquire better resources, or perhaps by using
 their inherently greater abilities, such performance effects would be less
 severe.

 When our results are compared to those of Mossholder and colleagues
 (1981), it would seem that certain boundary conditions are at work. Those
 authors found that self-esteem moderated the ambiguity-satisfaction rela-
 tionship but not the ambiguity-performance relationship. We found that
 self-esteem moderated measures of both satisfaction and performance. Moss-
 holder and colleagues attributed their results to the general tendency of role
 ambiguity to affect attitudinal dependent variables more than behavioral
 variables. We suggest that because their sample was more homogeneous than
 ours, consisting entirely of registered nurses, certain constraints on em-
 ployee performance may have precluded obtaining significant ambiguity-
 performance moderating effects (cf. Johns, 1991). Nurses may have greater
 constraints on their work behaviors than our respondents because the con-
 sequences of poor performance on patient health can be catastrophic.

 In contrast, Mossholder and colleagues (1981) found that self-esteem
 significantly moderated the conflict-performance relationship but not the
 conflict-satisfaction relationship. They attributed their results to the nature
 of the work their subjects performed. We, on the other hand, obtained just
 the opposite: moderating effects for conflict-satisfaction but not for conflict-
 performance. Perhaps, as Mossholder and colleagues noted, conflict in hos-
 pitals is structurally different and more intense than it is in other types of
 organizations, like the utility company studied here. Perhaps the profession-
 als in our study were better able to work around sources of conflict in their
 work environments than the nurses Mossholder and colleagues studied. As
 Johns (1991) noted, future researchers may need to think beyond the raw
 scores they obtain on role stressor scales and consider the psychological
 domains of their subjects. We also failed to observe significant moderating
 effects for the overload-performance relationship. This lack might be attrib-
 utable to two issues affecting our respondents: professional norms driving
 performance behavior, and the organizational and self-expectation that, as
 professionals, they will get their work done no matter how long it takes since
 there is no incoming shift to relieve them.

 Our results also support the premise advanced in our earlier work
 (Pierce et al., 1989) that researchers are more likely to find the self-esteem
 effects they are looking for if they measure self-esteem in a frame of reference
 consonant with the other variables under study. Our results with OBSE are
 more consistent, though not stronger, than results obtained in earlier studies
 with global assessments of overall individual competence. This pattern only
 makes sense, since global self-esteem derives from people's self-perceived
 competence across the myriad of roles that they occupy in life. Thus, the
 recommendation that researchers use self-esteem measures framed in the
 same context as the other measures under study merits consideration.

 In an ideal world, organizations would be motivated to, and effective at,

 creating role conditions that support workers and prevent unnecessary
 stress. The direct relationships found between quality of role conditions and
 satisfaction and performance (see Table 1) suggest that organizations and
 their members have much to gain from such role conditions. But the reality
 is that in rapidly changing environments, this ideal remains mostly a laud-
 able objective. Periods of uncertainty, conflict, overload, scarce resources,
 and poor relationships are becoming common as organizations attempt to
 restructure themselves to compete better in an international marketplace.

 Our findings offer some hope for those less than ideal organizations
 because the earlier work on OBSE (Pierce et al., 1989) suggests it is a prac-
 tical and malleable characteristic capable of change when substantive
 changes come about through a person's organizational experiences. Since
 organization-based self-esteem derives from the experiences that employees
 have within the context of their organizational roles, especially messages
 received from significant others like supervisors and colleagues, it appears
 fruitful for organization managers and leaders to foster employee experi-
 ences that bolster the development of a healthy sense of self-esteem. For
 example, when work environment support is inadequate, supervisors
 should reassure subordinates that they are capable of success despite the
 lack of resources. Similarly, avoidance of systems, procedures, and mana-
 gerial processes that send messages that employees are not competent and
 not to be trusted, such as excessive work rules and oppressive managerial
 behaviors, will help prevent low OBSE. A strong sense of self will help equip
 organization members with the ability to cope with the high levels of change,
 conflict, uncertainty, and ambiguity that will accompany work in the 21st
 century (cf. Johnston & Packer, 1987).

 In terms of future research, we offer several recommendations. With
 increasing interest in behavioral plasticity, the need to develop its opera-
 tional definition should be formally addressed. Only then can the self-
 esteem-plasticity hypothesis be fully explored. In addition, our earlier re-
 search provided evidence suggesting that OBSE had greater predictive effi-
 cacy than global self-esteem in association with other organization-based
 constructs. In the future, investigators might want to consider controlling for
 global self-esteem in their efforts to examine the incremental utility of OBSE.
 It should be noted that the main effects for satisfaction found here were
 generally larger than those for performance. Because the independent vari-
 ables and satisfaction were measured at the same time, both with self-report
 paper-and-pencil measures, some of those observed relationships could be
 due to common method effects. One advantage of moderated hierarchical
 regression analysis is that common method effects are partialled out along
 with the main effects before inspection of the interaction term, which is the
 focus of this study.

 Future researchers should examine more closely our failure to observe
 significant performance effects with two of the role conditions-role con-
 flict and role overload. Some recent work by Sawyer (1992) suggests that one
 area to examine is the degree to which these observations are measurement-

 bound. Finally, we suggest that future research should also be directed to-
 ward the development of an understanding of the kinds of organizational
 experiences that foster a healthy sense of organization-based self-esteem. In
 pursuit of this objective, a lead can be taken from the work of Korman (1971),
 who suggested that both the expectations of others and situational condi-
 tions, such as mechanically designed social systems, play a major role shap-
 ing an individual's self-esteem. Brockner (1988: 159-193), using anecdotes,
 also discussed in some detail the ways in which organizations can maintain
 and enhance employees' self-esteem. Many of the examples he used provide
 rich ground for testing hypotheses about the causes of self-esteem in organ-
 izations.
