This paper  examines  two  motives  for  the formation  of  local  multihospital  systems:  cost 
reduction and reputation enhancement. Systems may reduce costs by eliminating redundancies 
and  reducing  administrative  costs.  Integration may also lower costs for consumers seeking 
consistently  high  qualiiy.  We hypothesize  that  if  systems  achieve  either  cost  or  reputation 
benefits,  then  member hospitals  will  ‘look’ different from random collections  of  hospitals. 
We find  that  local  systems  do  not  appear  to  have  lower  costs  but  do  appear  to  enjoy 
reputation benefits over nonsystem hospitals.  Our findings  challenge the assumptions behind 
popular health  reform  initiatives. 

Ultimately,  diversity can  only  be  worthwhile if 
corporate management adds value in some way 
and  the  test  of  a  corporate  strategy  must  be 
that  the  businesses  in  the  portfolio  are  worth 
more  than  they  would  be  under  any  other 
ownership’ 

INTRODUCTION 

When  firms  in  the  same  market  merge,  they 
must  expect  some  attendant  benefits  to  offset 
the  legal  and  financial  costs  of 
the  merger. 
Unless  the  merger  enhances  market  power,  the

benefits  are  generally  expected  to  come  from 
economies  of  scale  and  scope.  But  even  when 
economies  of  scale  and  scope  are  present  in  a 
production  or  retail  process,  it  is  not  always 
necessary  for  firms  to  combine  under  common 
ownership  to  achieve  them  (Teece,  1982).  For 
example, firms can achieve purchasing economies 
by 
joint  purchasing  without  any  ownership 
changes.  To  take  another  example,  economies 
of  scale  in  a  narrow  product  line  within  the 
industry  may  be  achieved  by  individual  firms 
driven  to economize  by  market  forces. 

If  the  strategic  rationale  for  a  merger  is  to 
exploit  economies  of  scale  and  scope,  this 
rationale  is justified  only  when  those  economies 
cannot  be  exploited  without  the  merger.  In  this 
paper  we  draw  on  a  wide  range  of  literatures, 
including  those  on  transactions  cost  and  quality 
competition,  to  explain  why  mergers  may  be 
justified.  We

rationale  for  mergers  in  an  industry  can  be 
revealed by: (1) Identifying sources of  economies 
of  scale  and  scope  for  the  industry  in  question, 
and (2) Identifying systematic differences between 
merged  firms  and  random collections  of  firms  in 
the  industry  consistent  with  the  achievement  of 
these  economies  by  merged  firms. 

To illustrate our approach, we examine hospital 
combinations  in  California  in  1988.  This  is 
interesting  in  its  own  right  because  current 
public  policy  in  health  care  is  directed  towards 
encouraging the continued  growth of  multihospi- 
tal  systems.  Yet  there  is  little  evidence  to  date 
as  to  what  these  systems  have  been  able  to 
accomplish  through  merger  that  can  not  be 
accomplished by individual  firms. We are unable 
to  find  evidence  that  multihospital  systems  had 
been  more  able  than  independent  hospitals  to 
exploit scale and scope economies in production. 
We  do  find  evidence, however,  consistent  with 
superior exploitation  of  economies of  promotion 
and  reductions  in  consumer  search  costs  by 
multihospital  systems. 

Our  results  shed  important  new  light  on  the 
ongoing  health  reform  debate.  Many  health 
reform proposals,  including the Clinton Plan and 
state plans  introduced  by  Iowa  and  Washington, 
promote the growth of  horizontally  and vertically 
integrated  health  care  delivery  systems.  If  our 
findings  are  correct  and  generalizable, 
then 
horizontal  integration  will  not  achieve  the  cost 
reductions intended  by  health reform  advocates. 
They  may  in  fact  lead  to  higher  prices,  since 
consumers are willing to pay  a  premium  for  the 
reductions  in  search  costs  that systems  afford. 

CAN INDEPENDENT  FIRMS ACHIEVE 
ECONOMIES  OF SCALE  AND  SCOPE? 

Strategic  rationales  for  horizontal  combinations 
include  economies  of  scale  and  scope. There  is 
a  massive  literature  on  this  subject  and  the 
particular economies that one chooses to analyze 
may depend on the particular industry in question 
(Scherer and Ross, 1990). A related (and similarly 
vast) literature on corporate diversification draws 
heavily  on 
economies 
(Ramanujam and Varadaraj an, 1989). Whatever 
economies  one  focuses  on,  a  merger  is  not 
necessary  unless  it  affords  greater  economies 
than  could  be  realized  by  individual  firms.  In 

similar  notions  of 

this  paper  we  focus  on  economies  of  scale  and 
scope  that  may  be  realized  by  combinations  in 
the  hospital  industry.  These are: 

1. Concentration of  productive  assets 
2 .   Reductions  in  administrative  overhead 
3.  Reductions 

in  consumer  search  costs  via 
branding,  resulting  in  reputationisearch  bene- 
fits to  the  combination. 

CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTIVE 
ASSETS 

A  classic  source  of  economies  of  scale  is  the 
spreading of  fixed costs across greater  volume of 
output. For example,  fixed costs associated  with 
property,  plant  and  equipment  may  be  spread 
over large  production  volumes  in  order to drive 
down  costs.  Such  economies  of  scale  may  be 
achieved  in  the  market  in  a  number  of  ways. 
Firms  may  merge,  and  shift  production  to  a 
centralized facility. Or, firms may grow internally, 
investing  the  resources  necessary  to  build  suf- 
ficient  capacity  to  achieve  economies.  If  such 
internal  growth  is  viable,  then  combinations 
to  achieve  economies  will  have  no  inherent 
advantage  over  firms that  grow  internally. 

The  range  of  viable  configurations  of  firms 
may be  limited by transportation costs associated 
with  some  elements of  the  production  process, 
such that the benefits of  concentrating all activities 
in  a  single  facility  are  outweighed  by  the  costs. 
In  this  case,  production  must  be  organized  so 
that  only  some  elements  of  production  are 
concentrated.  Again, 
this  could  be  achieved 
either by  a single  firm producing  those  elements 
whose  economies  outweigh  the  diseconomies, 
and  contracting  for  the  remaining  elements  in 
the  open  market,  or  by  a  combination  of  firms 
that  concentrate some but  not  all  elements in  a 
single facility. 

if 

it  reduces 

Common  ownership  may  be  preferred  to the 
combination  of 
internal  growth  and  market 
contracting 
transactions  costs. 
Reorganization  of  production  under  common 
ownership may prevent a number of opportunities 
for hold-up.  For example, the independent firms 
may  be  reluctant  to make fixed investments  in  a 
common  distribution  method,  or  a  common 
retailing  image,  if  they  feared that  the firm with 


the  centralized  production  facility  could  hold 
them  up.  The  firm  under  common  ownership 
can  avoid  these  well-known  problems. 

Common  ownership  may  also  facilitate  cost 
reductions  if  higher  costs  are  the  direct  conse- 
quence  of  quality  competition.  In  markets  in 
which  consumers  are  quality  sensitive,  inde- 
pendent  sellers  may  each  raise  quality  in  order 
to  gain  a  competitive  advantage  (Lynk,  1988). 
By  merging,  these  sellers  can  avoid  quality 
competition, reduce quality, and increase profits. 

REDUCTION  OF ADMINISTRATIVE 
COSTS 

Another  source  of  scale  and  scope  economies  is 
the spreading of  fixed costs associated with general 
management  and  administration  over  more  units 
of  production.  For  example,  a  single  accounting 
office may be able to accommodate several business 
units  with  little  appreciable  increase  in  costs. 
Again,  these  economies  can  be  accomplished  by 
using  the  market.  Small  firms  may  purchase 
managerial  services  from  independent  market 
specialists (e.g.,  acounting firms, consulting firms, 
service bureaus,  janitorial  management  firms). 

The  market  may  be 

less  effective  than  a 
centralized firm when firms have specialized needs. 
In  this  case, there  may  not  be  enough  firms with 
the  same  particular  needs  to  support  the  growth 
of  independent  market  specialists  to  meet  them. 
Firms may  also  be  unwilling to use  the  market  if 
they  feel  that  they  may  be  forced  to  divulge 
valuable proprietary  information that they can not 
protect  through institutional controls. In  addition, 
independent  specialists  may  not  always  take  the 
best  interests of  their  clients into account,  due to 
diverging goals,  transactions costs and monitoring 
problems.  On the  other  hand, merged  firms may 
require  additional  administration  in  order  to 
coordinate 
units, 
especially  if  the  merger  markedly  increases  the 
size  and  complexity  of  the  firm,  or  if  the  units 
remain physically separate.

that  consumers  recognize 

and scope economies. Unlike the previous econ- 
omies  that  we  have  discussed,  economies  of 
promotion  derive from the effects of  firm actions 
on  consumption  rather  than  production.  By 
combining  under  a  single  corporate  umbrella, 
sellers  can  reduce  informational  problems  for 
consumers  by  standardizing  product  offerings, 
prices, and quality. Homogeneity across products 
or retail  units  reduces  the costs to consumers of 
obtaining  quality  and  price  information.  This 
assumes 
the 
products or retail units  belong  to the same firm, 
and  believe  that  quality  and  price  are  in  fact 
standardized. If consumers perceive that a merged 
entity provides  uniform product  attributes across 
locations,  then 
less  effort 
monitoring  providers  in  the  entity  and  perceive 
themselves  to be  at lower  risk  when  purchasing 
from  a  seller  with  which  they  have  no previous 
experience. By facilitating consumer monitoring, 
simplifying  consumer  search, and  reducing  con- 
sumer  uncertainty,  the  merged  entity  lowers 
consumer  transaction  and  search  costs,  and  is 
able to command a price premium.  Chain stores 
and fast food outlets provide well known examples 
of  firms that have benefitted from standardization 
of  the  product  and  image  that  they  present  to 
consumers. 

they  will  expend 

the  costs  to  the  provider  and 

We call the reduction  in consumer transaction 
and  search costs a  reputationhearch effect.  It  is 
similar to the reputational  argument of  Fombrun 
and  Shanley  (1990) and consistent  with  the role 
of  informational asymmetries in the development 
of  scope  economies  in  diversified  service  firms 
discussed  by  Nayyar  (1990;  1993).  It  is  also 
related  to the work of  Hill and Hoskisson  (1987) 
and  Nayyar  (1992),  who  discuss  the  value  of 
reducing 
its 
consumers that result from environmental uncer- 
tainty.  The  reputation/search  effect  is  likely  to 
be important whenever consumers may purchase 
bundles  of  goods  and  services  from  more  than 
one  location,  and  have  difficulty  evaluating  the 
quality  and  other  attributes  of  the  individual 
elements of the bundle. The consumer faces high 
monitoring  costs  and  other  risks  that  can  be 
mitigated  by  the  activities  of  a  parent  firm  in 
providing  a  consistent  representation  of  the 
activities of  subunits to consumers.

sumers,  they  could  then  offer  a  common  brand 
name.  It is not  unheard  of  for independent firms 
to use a common brand name-the  Ace Hardware 
stores  are  one  example.  A  problem  with  this 
approach  is  that  each  independent  firm  may 
attempt  to  free  ride  off  of  its  partners,  perhaps 
by  offering  lower  quality  than  had  been  agreed 
to.  Strict  franchise  agreements  with  substantial 
penalties  for  free  riders  may  overcome  this 
problem  in  some, but  not  all,  cases (Simon  and 
Sullivan,  1993). 

‘SYSTEMNESS’ 

The  reputationisearch  benefit  is  derived  from 
consumers’  perceptions  that  components of  the 
system are homogeneous.  A  rationale  for combi- 
nation  that is  related  to reputarion/search  effects 
concerns  the  benefits  of  consistency  and  hom- 
ogeneity  in  the  activities  and  characteristics  of 
subunits  within  a  firm.  The  strategy  literature 
stresses  the  value  of  homogeneity  of  strategic 
intent  and  implementation.  Chandler’s  (1962) 
linkage  of  strategy  and  structure  implies  some 
degree  of  homogeneity  of  structure  across  sub- 
units.  Shortell  (1988)  refers  to  this  homogeneity 
of  strategic  intent  as  ‘systemness’.  Shortell, 
Morrison,  and  Friedman 
looking  at 
hospital  systems,  suggest  that  hospitals  in  a 
system  should  organize  their  activities  similarly 
around  similar  goals.  Zajac  and  Shortell  (1989) 
suggest that if  a hospital system is using a generic 
strategy  (within the Miles and  Snow framework) 
then  each  system  hospital  should  employ  a 
relatively consistent set of  activities. For example 
each  hospital  in  a  system  may  be  expected  to 
employ  similar  combinations  of  staffing  and 
equipment,  or  similar  pricing  policies.  This 
assumes  that  the  system  has  coherent  goals 
around  which  to organize.

BACKGROUND AND  PRIOR  RESEARCH 
ON  HOSPITAL  SYSTEMS 

Multihospital  systems  consist  of  two  or  more 
physically separate hospitals sharing common own- 
ership. Multihospital systems first came to national 
attention  following the  introduction  of  Medicare 
and  Medicaid  legislation  in  1965.  The  resulting 
complex  set  of  regulations  led  to  a  burgeoning 

industry  in  hospital  management.  In  the  1970s, 
firms like Hospital Corporation of  America (HCA), 
American  Medical  International  (AMI), National 
Medical Enterprises (NME), and Humana acquired 
scores of  hospitals  and  sold  management  services 
to  dozens  of  others.  The  major  national  systems 
gained administrative economies of  scale based on 
transaction  processing  for  reimbursements  from 
state  and  Federal  agencies,  as  well  as  other 
managerial economies such as in national recruiting. 
By  1983,  HCA  owned  349  hospitals,  while  the 
other three giants owned a total of  206. Together, 
these accounted for over  10 percent  of  the private 
hospitals  in  the  United  States. 

In the 1980s, following Medicare’s introduction 
of  prospective  payment  and 
the  growth  of 
selective contracting by private insurers, hospitals 
were  faced  with  a  new  set  of  challenges  which 
the  existing national  chains had  not  been forced 
to  meet.  Cost  containment,  improved  medical 
outcomes  and  closer  vertical  relations  with  local 
payors  and  physicians  became  keys  to  success 
in  an  increasingly  uncertain  and  competitive 
environment. Health Maintenance  Organizations 
and  Preferred  Provider  Organizations  were  a 
new  breed  of  health care purchasers  who sought 
reasonable  and  consistent  quality  at  the  lowest 
cost.  With  the  locus  of  competition  shifting  to 
local markets, national systems no longer enjoyed 
significant  relevant  economies.  Many  national 
systems divested  large portions  of their holdings, 
geographically-based  systems  grew  in  size  and 
many  new  systems  were  formed.  Systems  such 
as UniHealth, Catholic Healthcare West, Summit, 
and  Jupiter  became  significant  regional  players, 
both in terms of  total hospitals and in the number 
of  markets in  which  they  had  a  significant  local 
presence.  Many  industry  observers  and  policy 
makers  believe  that  these  systems  can  exploit 
economies  of  scale  in  local  markets  as  well  as 
simplify  consumer  purchasing  decisions.  (See, 
for  example,  Iowa  Leadership  Consortium  on 
Health  Care,  1993). These systems are likely  to 
continue to grow in importance as public policy is 
directed towards ‘managed competition’ centered 
around  integrated  local  health  care providers. 

RESEARCH  ON  SYSTEMS 

The  emergence  of  national  hospital  systems  in 
the  1970s  did  not  go  unnoticed  (Brown  and 


McCool,  1980;  Finkler  and  Horowitz,  1985; 
Mullner and Anderson, 1987). Judgements about 
this  trend  have  been  mixed.  Starr  (1982)  calls 
this trend ‘the coming of the corporation.’ Stevens 
(1989)  bemoans  the  fact  that  in  the  1980s, 
nonprofits  ‘clustered  eagerly  into  systems.’ Lin- 
dorff  (1992) alleges that systems are at the heart 
of  America’s  health  care  crisis.  Starr,  Stevens 
and  Lindorff  convey  negative  views  of  system 
growth,  suggesting  that  an  emphasis  on  the 
‘bottom line’ is  antithetical  to quality  care. 

A  more  positive  view  of  systems  emerges  in 
Brown and McCool(l980) and Coile (1992). These 
authors  see  the  growth  of  national  systems  as  a 
response to environmental changes. Their messages 
are  prescriptive,  arguing 
that  systems  foster 
efficiency and flexibility without sacrificing quality. 
With the exception of Conrad (1992) who discusses 
clinical integration (i.e., referral patterns), analysts 
fail to specify the mechanisms whereby such gains 
can  be  achieved.  They  also  fail  to  explain  why 
these  gains  can  only  be  made  by  systems  as 
opposed  to  stand  alone  hospitals.  By  examining 
hospital  systems  as  special  cases  of  business 
combinations, we  shed light on these questions. 

Thus  far,  empirical  studies  of  systems  have 
had  mixed results.  Levitz and Brooke (1985) and 
Pattison  and  Katz  (1983)  find  that  hospitals  in 
systems  have  higher  costs,  higher  prices  and 
higher  profit  margins  than  do nonsystem  hospi- 
tals. Shortell (1988) finds that while performance 
varies  across hospitals,  it  is not  significantly tied 
to  system  membership.  Using  the  Miles  and 
Snow  (1978) framework, Friedman  and  Shortell 
(1988)  identify  strategic  determinants of  system 
profitability.2 Shortell et  al. (1990) report similar 
findings, as well as observing that the profitability 
of  system hospitals is dependent on local demand 
and  regulatory  conditions.  Shortell  et  al.  also 
provide  evidence  on  other  aspects  of  system 
performance,  such  as  the  degree  to  which  they 
‘do good,’ e.g., by  providing  charitable services. 
Golden (1992)  further develops these  results by 
showing that  hospital  performance  is  moderated 
by  the interaction  of  its business strategy and  its 
relationship  with  corporate headquarters. 

The Logic  of  Multihospital  Systems 

59 

The  research  described  above  has  been  aug- 
mented  by  several  surveys.  Money,  Gilfillan, 
and  Duncan  (1976)  examine  human  resource 
determinants of  system  performance.  They  find 
that employee attitudes towards system member- 
ship  affect  performance.  Shortell  et  af.  (1990) 
survey managers  and  workers  to identify  system 
strategies and organizational  correlates of  system 
performance.  Shanley  and  Correa  (1992),  show 
that management teams of acquired and acquiring 
hospitals  can  have  widely divergent  views about 
the rationales for hospital  mergers. 

The empirical  literature  has suggested  numer- 
ous  ways  in  which  systems  can  affect  hospital 
performance.  We  build  on  this  literature  by 
identifying  and  measuring  the  underlying  eco- 
nomic determinants of  system performance.  The 
first  step is  to  identify  specific sources  of  value 
that  can  be  created  by  systems. 

WHAT CAN MULTIHOSPITAL 
SYSTEMS ACCOMPLISH? 

It  seems  fruitful  to  search  for  explanations  for 
hospital  systems  from  among  the  many  general 
explanations  for  why  firms  combine,  such  as 
those  in  Scherer  and  Ross  (1990)  or  Auerbach 
(1988).  These explanations  usually  fall  into one 
of  two  categories:  (1)  market  power,  and  (2) 
scale and  scope economies. 

through 

enhanced 

purchasing 

Market  power  explanations  consider  price 
advantages achievable  through  monopoly  power 
in the output market  and cost reductions achiev- 
able 
(or 
monopsony) power in the input market. In these 
explanations causality generally runs from market 
structure to performance.  Recent evidence shows 
market  structure to be an important  determinant 
of hospital pricing (Dranove, Shanley, and White, 
1993).  We  restrict  attention  in  this  paper  to 
urban  markets  in  which  systems  have  relatively 
small  market  shares.  Thus,  market  structure  is 
not likely to be a source of profits for our systems. 
We  do not  further consider  this  explanation  for 
system performance. 

* Miles  and  Snow  (1978)  identify  four  ‘generic  strategies’: 
Analyzer, Defender, Prospector,  and Reactor. These charac- 
terize distinct patterns of  production,  product market choices, 
and  administrative  characteristics  of  firms.  The  typology  is 
useful for evaluating the  observed  strategies  of  firms. 

ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND SCOPE 

Hospital systems may achieve economies of  scale 
and  scope  either by  economizing  on  productive

inputs,  or  by  reducing  consumer  searchitrans- 
action  costs.  Like  other  multidivisional  firms, 
hospital  systems  can  facilitate  scale  and  scope 
economies on the production  side by  eliminating 
duplicative  equipment,  reducing  administrative 
costs,  and  more  efficiently  managing  labor  and 
supply  inventories  (Hill  and  Hoskisson,  1987). 
Finkler (1981) and Dranove, Shanley, and Simon 
(1992)  document  that  there  are  economies  of 
scale associated with the provision of  many ‘high 
tech’  services,  such  as  open  heart  surgery. 
neonatology,  and  diagnostic 
imaging.  These 
services  require  costly  capital  equipment,  and 
cost reductions follow naturally  as service volume 
increases.  Robinson  and  Luft  (1985)  argue  that 
competing  hospitals  may  overprovide high  tech 
services  in  order  to  attract  physicians  to  their 
staffs.  As  a  result  of  this  quality-based  compe- 
tition,  the  hospitals  forego  eonomies  of  scale. 
They conclude that hospital mergers may mitigate 
quality  competition, and  lead  to facility  consoli- 
dation.  Zwanziger  and  Melnick 
(1988)  and 
Dranove  et  al.  (1992)  present  evidence  that 
quality  competition  between  hospitals  does  not 
lead  to excessive  costs.  If  the  latter authors are 
correct,  then  hospital  systems  should  offer  no 
fewer high tech  services than  random collections 
of  hospitals  with  similar  characteristics. 

Another potential source of  economies of  scale 
in hospitals may be the reduction in administration 
and  overhead costs.  These account  for  about 30 
percent  of  total  expenses for  the typical  hospital 
in  our  sample.  If  some of  these costs are  fixed, 
then  spreading  the  costs  over  more  than  one 
hospital  may  reduce  overall  costs.  There  are 
several  reasons  to  believe  that  the magnitude  of 
these  cost  savings  may  be  small.  First,  most  of 
these  costs  are  for  labor  and  materials,  which 
may  vary  proportionately  with  hospital  size, 
which  is  inconsistent  with  scale  economies.  This 
is supported by Friedman and Pauly (1981). who 
find  that  a  given  hospital’s  average  costs do not 
vary  over  the  long  run  as the  hospital’s  volume 
varies.  Second,  merging  hospitals  remain  physi- 
cally  separate,  so  that  services  such  as  nursing, 
housekeeping,  and  medical  records  can  not  be 
easily consolidated. In this sense, system members 
are akin  to unrelated  subsidiaries  of  a diversified 
parent  firm. 

Hospitals  do not  necessarily  need  to  merge  to 
obtain  managerial  efficiencies.  For  example, 
the  services  of  hospital 
many  hospitals  use 

management  companies,  such  as  Brim  and 
Associates,  which  provide  billing,  personnel 
management,  and  other  services.  This  allows 
hospitals to remain independent but still enjoy the 
scale  advantages  achieved  by  their  management 
firms.  To  the  extent  that  hospital  management 
companies  do not  always  take the  best  interests 
of  their  clients  into  account,  this  solution  may 
not  be  as effective  as  an  outright  consolidation 
of  ownership. To  take  another  example,  many 
hospitals  have  formed  purchasing  cooperatives 
in  order  to achieve purchasing  economies while 
maintaining  their  independence.  The  Alliance 
Health  System  and 
the  Voluntary  Hospitals 
of  America  are  two  examples  of  purchasing 
cooperatives. 

The above discussion suggests several  hypoth- 
eses about cost  savings through system develop- 
ment.  Most  of  the  benefits  of  systems  that  we 
have  discussed  will  accrue only to local  systems; 
i.e.,  hospitals  in  the  same  local  market.  We 
therefore  restrict  our  hypotheses 
to  system 
configurations  involving  three  or  more  hospitals 
in  a  local  market.  If  these  local  systems  have 
been  effective  in  achieving  scale  economies  in 
one  of 
the  ways  discussed  above,  then  they 
should  ‘look different’ from  a  random collection 
of  hospitals  in  the  following  ways: 

Hypothesis  1:  A  local  multihospital  system 
will  offer  fewer  ‘high  tech’  services  than  a 
random collection of  hospitals that has similar 
characteristics as  the system  hospitals. 

Hypothesis  2:  A  local  multihospital  system 
will  have  lower  average  total  costs  than  a 
random collection of  hospitals that has similar 
characteristics as  the system hospitals. 

Hypothesis  3:  A  local  multihospital  system 
will  have  lower  administrative  costs  than  a 
random collection of  hospitals that has similar 
characteristics  as  the system  hospitals. 

REPUTATION/SEARCH  BENEFITS 

Increasingly, hospital systems are being viewed as 
vehicles for marketing  to health care purchasers. 
Nowadays,  health  care  purchasers  are  large 
employers  and  insurers,  rather  than  individual 
patients. These large purchasers ‘selectively con- 


tract’  with  providers  to  put  together  a  package 
of  health  care services which  are then  offered to 
employees as Health Maintenance Organizations, 
Preferred  Provider Organizations,  or self-funded 
insurance  plans.  Purchasers  need 
to  obtain 
services  from  several  hospitals,  yet  may  have 
difficulty  ascertaining  the  quality  of  each.  This 
is  exactly  the  situation  in  which  standardization 
of  quality  and  the  accompanying  brand  name 
identity may reduce purchaser searchitransaction 
costs.  Standardization  and  brand  identity  may 
also  facilitate  employer/employee  interactions, 
where employees as a group are concerned about 
the  entire  health  benefit  package,  rather  than 
the  quality  of  a  specific provider.  The idea  that 
information  in  health  care markets will  be  more 
useful  when 
large 
purchasers is at the heart of  many health reform 
proposals,  such as Enthoven and Kronick  (1991) 
and  Shortell (1992).3 

imparted  by  systems 

to 

Hospital  systems  in  our  sample  have  taken  a 
number  of  steps  to  project  a  unified  image  to 
purchasers.  For  example,  UniHealth,  a  large 
system  in  Southern  California,  marketed  the 
services  of  its  hospitals  collectively  as  ‘Team 
UniHealth,’  and  boasted  of  ‘consistent  quality’ 
across  providers,  so  that  purchasers  understood 
they  were  buying  a  package  of  hospital  services 
from  an  integrated  ‘team’  (UniHealth  Annual 
Report,  1989).  Sutter  Health  makes  similar 
statements about their consistent quality, describ- 
ing  the  ‘Sutter  difference’  that  distinguishes  all 
Sutter hospitals from others. As with UniHealth, 
these promotions discuss Sutter as a single entity, 
rather  than  a collection of  independent hospitals 
(Sutter  Health  Annual  Report,  1989).  These 
systems  viewed  consistency  as  a  source  of 
advantage  in  negotiating  with  large  purchasers, 
and  presumably  hoped  to  achieve  a  premium 
price  as  the  manifestation  of  the  value  of  the 
brand  identity.  Interestingly,  the  system  annual 
reports  that  we  have  reviewed  are  far  more 
focussed on product differentiation (system hospi- 
tals differentiated from other hospitals) than they 
are  on  cost  savings.  Many  systems  also  use 
newspaper advertisements to promote themselves 
to  individual  purchasers.  We  suspect  that  such 
advertisements  run  more  frequently  at  ‘open 
enrollment’  time,  when  most  employees  in  a

concessions from  hospitals.

market  are  selecting  their  HMO  or  PPO.  The 
brand  identity  of  the system may be an effective 
way  of  influencing  enrollment  decisions. 

Note  that  hospitals  in  a  system  can  achieve 
standardization in one of  two ways. First, systems 
may  seek  out  new  members  whose  service 
offerings,  staffing  policies,  and  financial  profile 
resemble those of hospitals already in the system. 
In  this  case,  the  system  provides  an  efficient 
method  of  presenting  this  homogeneity  to  con- 
sumers.  Second,  the  system  may  implement 
policies  that  force  member  hospitals  to  adopt 
similar  service  offerings,  etc.  In  this  case  the 
system  offers  both  control  and  presentation 
benefits. 

The  above  arguments  suggest  the  following 

hypotheses: 

Hypothesis  4:  A  local  multihospital  system 
will  have  higher  price-cost  margins,  due  to 
lower  costs  andior  reputationisearch  effects, 
than a  random  collection  of  hospitals  that has 
similar  characteristics  as  the system  hospitals. 

Hypothesis 5:  Hospitals in a system will have 
more  homogeneous  production  characteristics 
(e.g.,  product  line  and  staffing  mix)  than  a 
random  collection of hospitals  that has similar 
characteristics  as  the system hospitals. 

Hypothesis  6:  System  profitability  will  be 
linked  to  efficiencies  and  systemness  due  to 
cost  andlor  reputationisearch  effects. 

OTHER  ISSUES 

We  have  suggested  that  some  rationales  for 
system formation are less compelling than others. 
For  example,  there  is  evidence  that  there  are 
scale  economies  in  the  provision  of  high  tech 
services,  but  there  is  also  evidence  that  such 
economies  are  exploited  by  independent  hospi- 
tals.  There  is  also  little  reason  to  believe  that 
systems  can  significantly  reduce  administrative 
costs.  On  the  other  hand, systems  promote  the 
uniform quality and consistency of their products, 
suggesting that there may be  a reputationhearch 
benefit  to users  of  systems. 

In  order  to  fully  sort  out  these  competing 
explanations,  we  would  ideally  examine  some 
independent  variables  associated  with  the  costs

it 

and benefits of  system formation; e.g., measures 
of  regulatory  barriers  to  selective  contracting 
that may affect the magnitude  of  the reputation/ 
search  benefit.  Unfortunately,  the  conditions 
bringing  about  system  growth  have  affected all 
of  the  hospitals  in  our population  fairly equally, 
so  that  we  feel 
is  unlikely  that  detailed 
predictions  sorting  out 
the  explanations  are 
possible at present. While we suspect that systems 
in  1988 were  driven  more  by  reputationhearch 
effects  than  by  efforts  to  reduce  costs,  we 
have  found  no  way  to  parameterize  the  likely 
importance of  scale and  reputation effects in  the 
cross section, so we can not rely on this approach 
to conclusively sort through competing rationales. 
There  are  other  dimensions  of  performance 
that  we  might  analyze.  such  as  attainment  of 
social  objectives  (see Shortell  et  al.,  1990).  We 
note  several  of  these  measures in  our  empirical 
analysis,  including  the  provision  of  charity  care 
and care for Medicaid  patients. We  do not  have 
a theory  to guide  the  interpretation of  results on 
these  measures  and  use  them  mainly  to  control 
for  payor-mix  differences  across  hospitals.  One 
can  also  assess  performance  in  terms  of  goal 
attainment. We  lack  data  to do this  and  even  if 
we  had  such  data,  it  would  not  be  comparable 
across a diverse sample of  hospitals. We recognize 
that  our  analysis  may  fail  to  identify  all  scale 
and scope-related strategic rationales,  because  of 
failures of implementation and firm-specific rather 
than general bases for economies,  although these 
factors  could  in  principle  be  analyzed  if  we  had 
adequate data. 

METHODS  AND  DATA 

We  analyze  financial  data  provided  by 
the 
California  Office  of  Statewide  Health  Planning 
and  Development  (OSHPD) for  1988 (the most 
recent  year  available  to  us).  This  data  set 
provides  unique  detail  about  service  offerings 
and  utilization,  costs,  staffing  and  financial 
performance. It also provides a significantly large 
sample from which to draw statistical  inferences. 
While  external  validity  remains  an  issue,  health 
care trends in  California  have  generally  led  the 
nation,  so that the results that we  document for 
California  should  be  of  consequence  elsewhere. 
We  use  two  different  units  of  analysis.  We 
first take the individual  hospital  as the unit. This 

choice  is  consistent  with  prior  research  and  is 
made  with  the  view  that  the  hospital  is  the 
strategic  actor  regardless  of  system  affiliation. 
We then  take the system as the unit. One reason 
to  study  the  system  as  the  actor  is  that  if 
differences are not  observed  at the system  level, 
then  the  concept  of  a  system  has  no  meaning 
and  a  system  of  hospitals  is  no  different  from  a 
random  collection  of  autonomous  hospitals. 
Moreover,  analysis  at  the  hospital  level  may 
mask  significant  differences  occurring  at  some 
but  not  all  system  hospitals. 

Another  reason  to  study  systems  rather  than 
hospitals is that systems may intentionally allocate 
resources  in  ways  such  that  the  performance 
of  some  individual  members  differs  from  the 
performance  of  the overall system. For example, 
the system may concentrate its most remunerative 
services  in  a  single  center  and  use  its  satellite 
hospitals  as  loss  leaders  to  rationalize  referral 
patterns.  This  inappropriately  introduces  noise 
into  hospital  level  analyses  and  raises  questions 
regarding appropriate weighting of   observation^.^ 
We  define  a  local  system  as comprising  three 
or  more  community  hospitals 
the  same 
geographic  market  sharing  common  ownership. 
We  identify  the population  of  community hospi- 
tals  in  California  from  the  OSHPD  data.  We 
determine ownership  from  the  OSHPD data, as 
well  as from  the  American  Hospital  Association 
Annual  Guide  for  1989  (which  reports  survey 
data  for  1988). 

in 

In  defining  geographic  markets it  is  necessary 
to  identify  the  area  in  which  a  system  would 
reap the benefits of  scale or reputation economies. 
Since  the  early  1980s,  hospital  systems  have 
typically  sold their services directly to employers 
or indirectly to employers through insurers. Thus, 
the  relevant  purchaser  is  an  employer,  and  the 
relevant  geographic  area  consists  of  the  area  in 
which  an  employer  draws  his  labor  force.  We 
lack  data  on  worker  flows,  so  we  assume  that 
the relevant  area is  the SMSA. Actual  economic 
markets  are  probably  no  larger  than  SMSAs. 
Few  firms  attract  many  workers  from  outside 
their SMSAs, and it is unlikely that a  firm would 
require  its employees to go outside  of the SMSA 
for all  but  the  most  esoteric medical  treatments. 

“There  is  also  some  question  about  the  true  degrees  of 
freedom  in  a  hospital  level  analysis.  since  the  performance 
of  each  hospital  in  a system  may  be  highly intercorrelated. 


Even  the  Los  Angeles  SMSA  is  probably  not 
too  large,  since  it  is  entirely  plausible  that  an 
employer  in  central  Los  Angeles  could  draw 
employees from  widely  distant  locations and  be 
attracted  to  a  geographically  dispersed  hospital 
system.  Issues  related  to these  arise  in  defining 
antitrust  markets (Dranove and Shanley,  1990). 
Table  1 identifies  the  local  systems  that  we 
examine,  along with  summary  data on  size  and 
ownership. The systems range in size from three 
to eight hospitals.  Most  are for-profit, and three 
are  parts  of  large  established  national  chains. 
We  identified  four additional  local  systems that 
we  excluded  from  our  analysis:  Kaiser,  Los 
Angeles County, American  Healthcare Manage- 
ment, and Jupiter. Kaiser does not  report usable 
financial  data.  Los  Angeles  County,  American 
Healthcare  Management,  and  Jupiter  systems 
have  unique  characteristics  that  did  not  lend 
themselves to our modeling approach (LA County 
hospitals  are very  large, whereas hospitals  in  the 
other two systems are very  small). 

Our  principal  methodological  problem  at  the 
system  level  of  analysis  is  the  identification  of 
appropriate  comparison  groups.  Our  goal  here 
is to determine whether actual systems look  any 
different  from  a  similar  sized  collection  of 
nonsystem hospitals. To identify such a collection, 
we  employ  a  Monte  Carlo  approach.  For  each 
actual  system  that  we  study,  we  randomly 
construct  a  unique  set  of  ‘pseudo systems’  with 
the  exact  same  number  of  hospitals  and  a 
comparable number of beds. The pool of hospitals 
from  which  we  constructed  pseudo  systems  was 

Table  1.  Inventory of  local systems

restricted  to private  hospitals  with  over  40  beds 
in  the  following  SMSAs: Fresno;  Los  Angeles; 
Sacramento;  San  Bernardino/Riverside;  San 
Diego;  San  Francisco;  and  San  Jose.  This  pool 
includes all of  the actual system hospitals.  Details 
of  our approach  are provided  in  the appendix. 
We  measure  system  characteristics  and  per- 
formance  relative  to  the  characteristics  of  the 
pseudo  systems.  System  performance  on  any 
particular  dimension  is  expressed  in  terms  of  a 
percentile.  If,  for  example,  a  particular  system 
scores  in  the  95th  percentile  on  the  variable 
‘profit margin,’ then  only  5  percent of  randomly 
constructed  pseudo  systems  have  the  same  or 
greater  profitability 
the  actual  system 
exhibits.  This  has  a  natural  correspondence  to 
standard  hypothesis  testing-in 
this  case,  the 
probability  of  the  actual  system  performing  as 
well  as it did  due to chance  is estimated  to be  5 
percent. 

To test  our hypotheses about system perform- 
ance,  we  examine  a  number  of  dimensions  at 
both  the hospital  and system level:

Service offerings 
We  identify  the  presence  or  absence  of  11 
hospital  services.  Six of  these  services, including 
magnetic resonance imaging, open heart surgery, 
radioisotope 
therapy,  cardiac  catheterization, 
therapeutic radiology, and neonatology, are likely 
to  be  associated  with  economies  of  scale,  both 
because they require substantial fixed investments 
and  because  they  may  have  learning  curves.  A

system can reduce costs by offering these services 
at fewer hospitals,  with a higher  volume at each. 
If  the  system  has  no  advantage  in  offering  the 
service  in-house,  it  may  contract  to  an  outside 
provider  to  take  advantage  of  market  efficien- 
cies.’  From  Hypothesis  1, we  expect  systems to 
provide  fewer  of  these  services  than  pseudo- 
systems. We define  the variable  HIGH TECH to 
be  the  sum  total  of  these  service  offerings  at 
systems and  pseudo systems.h 

Some services are not generally associated with 
a high degree of  technological sophistication. We 
define  HIGH  TOUCH  to  be  the  sum  total  of 
these  five  service  offerings:  deliveries,  alternate 
birthing,  pediatrics,  substance  abuse,  and  home 
care.  Unlike  HIGH TECH, there  is  less  theory 
to  predict  the  provision  of  high  touch  services. 
It  is possible  that these services provide  the basis 
for  a  differentiation  strategy.  Thus,  we  might 
expect  a  given  system  to  provide  substantially 
more or fewer of these services and we therefore 
include  them  in  our analysis. 

costs 
To  test  Hypotheses  2  and  3,  we  examine  two 
indicators  of  efficiency:  costs  per  admission 
(COST), and administrative costs as a percentage 
of  total costs (ADMIN COST). COST is calculated 
in  such  a  way  as  to  control  for  hospital 
level  differences  in  case  mix  and  market  level 
differences  in  total  costs.’  We measure  ADMIN 
COST  as  the  sum  of  general  services,  fiscal 
services,  and  administrative  services  as reported 
by  OSHPD.  When  the  unit  of  analysis  is  the 
system,  we  calculate  COST  by  aggregating 
adjusted  costs  and  dividing  by  total  admissions. 
rather  than  taking  the  simple  average  across 
hospitals. Similarly, we calculate ADMIN  COST 
by  aggregating costs and administrative expenses

This would suggest that systems provide one of  every service. 
while  still avoiding duplication. We examined the distribution 
of  service  offerings  in  systems  and  did  not  find  supporting 
evidence. 
We  also  examine  each  service  individually  with  similar 
results  to those  for  High  Tech  and  High  Touch.

to  the  system  level.  Our  data  do  not  include 
costs incurred by system headquarters. Thus, our 
analysis of  costs  is  somewhat biased  in  favor  of 
finding  lower  costs  for  systems  than  is  actually 
the  case. 

Prices 
We  test  Hypothesis  4  by  estimating  the average 
price-cost  margins  that  systems  obtain  from 
privately  insured  patients.  If  Hypothesis  4  is 
correct, then we would expect price-cost  margins 
to be higher in system hospitals. The method for 
constructing  the  price-cost  margin  is  detailed in 
Dranove  et  al.  (1993).  Briefly,  we  estimate unit 
prices  (net  of  insurer  discounts)  and  unit  costs 
for  major  hospital  cost  centers  and  aggregate 
these  to  determine  the  transactions  price  and 
cost for a fixed market  basket.  We then calculate 
the  Lerner  index,  which  equals  (price-cost)/ 
this  variable  LERNER.  We 
price.  We  call 
aggregate  revenues  and costs at each cost  center 
to  the  system  level  in  order  to  calculate  system 
LERNERs.  Note  that  a  few  hospitals  did  not 
report  adequate  data  to  permit  construction  of 
the  market  basket.  When  these  hospitals  made 
up  over  one-third  of  an  actual  system,  that 
system  was  not  included  in  the  system-level 
analysis. These hospitals were also excluded from 
pseudo systems. 

Repu tationlSearch1Sy sternness 
Hypothesis  5  suggests  that  hospitals  within 
systems will  be  more  like  each  other  than  are 
hospitals  within  pseudo  systems.  This  can  be 
tested by comparing the ‘systemness’ of systems 
vs.  pseudo  systems.  While  existing  theories do 
not  identify  specific  variables  to  examine,  we 
that  systemness  will  be  evidenced 
believe 
by  reduced  variation  with  respect 
to  firm 
characteristics such  as organizational structure, 
product  mix,  or  marketing  strategieslpricing. 
We  examine  two  variables  in  each  of  these 
categories,  with  our  choices  guided  largely  by 
data  availability.x 

We  measure  systemness  by  calculating  the 
coefficients  of  variation  (CVs)  of  the  following 

Measuring  systemness  and  relating  it  to  performance  are

systems  integration. 


six variables: (1) the ratio of  nursing expenditures 
to  total  expenditures, (2)  the ratio  of  registered 
nursing  expenditures  to  total  nursing  expendi- 
tures,  (3)  the  ratio  of  inpatient  expenditures  to 
total  expenditures,  (4)  the ratio  of  expenditures 
on  clinical  laboratory (a service  associated  with 
intensive patient care) to total  expenditures,  ( 5 )  
the  price-cost  margin,  and  (6) the  ratio  of  bad 
debt  and  charity  care to  total  revenues.’  While 
none  of  these  measures  directly  correspond  to 
the  type  of  homogeneity  of  product  associated 
with,  say,  McDonald’s  hamburgers,  we  believe 
that  homogeneity  on  these  dimensions  will 
be  correlated  with  the  homogeneity  we  seek. 
Hypothesis 4 is confirmed  if  CVs of  the variables 
listed  above are lower in  systems than  in pseudo 
systems. 

In  interpreting  the  coefficient  on  systemness, 
we  stress  the  searchh-eputation  explanation  for 
the link  between  homogeneity  and performance, 
rather  than  the  strategic  intent  interpretation 
given  by  Shortell  (1988),  because  the  former 
provides  a  well-articulated  mechanism  linking 
the two.  Even so, we  acknowledge  the potential 
importance  of  the  strategic  intent  explanation. 
Unfortunately,  we  cannot  distinguish  the  two 
interpretations with our data, and for convenience 
we will often  refer  to the two interchangeably as 
a ‘systemness’ effect.”  We are unaware of  other 
attempts  to  specifically  measure  systemness  and 
relate  it  to performance. 

Finally,  we  are interested in  profitability  and 
how  it  relates  to  other  system  characteristics 
(Hypothesis  6).  We  use  operating  margin 
(OPMARGIN) rather  than  asset  based  profita- 
bility measures because the latter are difficult to 
measure and interpret for nonprofit  institutions. 
We  define  OPMARGIN  to  be  net  operating 
revenue  divided  by  net  operating expense. As 
with  LERNER,  revenue  and  expense  are 

’ Variation may  be  artificially  introduced  if  the  hospitals  in 
the system or pseudo system  have different sizes (subject  to 
a  constraint  on  total  system  size).  We  control  for  this  by 
regressing  each  of  the  six  characteristics  on  bed  size,  and 
using  the  residuals  as  the  basis  for  calculating  CVs.  A 
constant  was  added to each residual  so that all residuals had 
positive  values. 
I”  An  alternative  explanation for  an  observed  link  between 
systemness and performance is that strong central management 
can  simultaneously  boost  profits  and  exert  influence  over 
subunits  leading them to appear more homogeneous. In  this 
case  the correlation between systemness  and  performance is 
not  indicative of  causality.

system  membership.  In  order  to  determine  if 
system  hospitals  have  lower  costs  for  a  fixed

RESULTS-CHARACTERISTICS  OF 
SYSTEMS 

Table 5 presents the raw and percentile  scores for 
HIGH  TECH  and  HIGH  TOUCH  for  each 
system. Eight  of  13 systems score above  the 50th 
percentile on HIGH TECH and  no system scores 
below the 28th percentile. This is inconsistent with 
Hypothesis  1 that  systems  achieve  economies  by 
eliminating  duplicative  high  tech  services.  Seven 
systems score above the 50th percentile on HIGH 
TOUCH,  which  indicates  that  systems  are  not 
differentiating  themselves  on this variable  either.

Table  6  presents  percentile  scores  for  COST. 
Seven  of  13  systems  score  below 
the  50th 
percentile.  This is not  significantly different than 
would  be  expected  due  to  chance.  To  control 
for  the  effects  of  service  offerings  and  patient 
mix on costs, we perform multivariate  regression 
analyses where the control variables were HIGH 
TECH,  HIGH  TOUCH,  MEDICAID  and 
CHARITY.I3 For the sake of  brevity, we do not 
report  the  results  of  these  regressions.  We  take 
the  residuals  from  the  multivariate  analysis, 
the  ADJUSTED  COST,  and 
which  we  call 
calculate  percentile  scores.  Eight  systems  score 
below the 50th percentile on ADJUSTED COST, 
again  consistent  with  chance. We reject  Hypoth- 
esis 2  that systems achieve overall  cost  savings. 
Seven  of  13  systems  score  above  the  50th 
percentile on ADMIN COST. However. of  these, 
six  score  above  the  75th  percentile  (p  = 0.05, 
based on two-tailed binomial test). We performed 
multivariate  analysis  to  control  ADMIN  COST 
for payor-mix and service offerings. Nine systems 
score  above  the 50th  percentile  on  ADJUSTED 
ADMIN  COST  (p  = 0.10)  and  seven  of  these 
score above the 75th  percentile  (p  = 0.02). The 
high  administrative  cost  is  especially  noteworthy 

I’  This is analogous to a  simple frontier analysis of  technical 
efficiency  (Caves  and  Barton,  1990).  A  separate  regression 
analysis  was  required  for  each  systemipseudo-system  set. 
Results  are  available  from  the  authors upon  request. 

because  it  is  expressed  as a  percentage  of  total 
cost,  which  itself  is  generally  average  to  above 
average.  If  anything,  our  results  understate  the 
administrative  costs 
in  systems,  since  many 
systems  have  a  parent  organization  or  central 
administration  unit  whose  expenses  are  not 
included  in  the  hospital  level  cost  data  that  we 
examine.  Thus,  we  reject  Hypothesis  3  that 
systems reduce  administrative  costs. 

Table 7 reports results for LERNER. Only  10 
systems reported adequate data. Six of  these had 
margins  ranking  above  the  50th  percentile.  All 
six,  however,  ranked  above  the  75th  percentile 
(p = 0.01).  We  therefore  accept  Hypothesis  4 
that  system  markups  are  in  excess  of  those  at 
pseudo  systems.  This  result,  combined  with  the 
fact  that  systems  do  not  have  cost  advantages 
over pseudo  systems, suggests that systems offer 
reputationhearch  benefits.  We  investigate  this 
further by  examining systemness. 

Table 8 presents  results on  the  six  systemness 
scores.  Only  11 systems  report  data  on staffing 
and  laboratory  use.  (10  systems  report  markup 
data.) First  looking across  the systemness meas- 
ures,  we  find  that  on  four  of  the  six  measures 
(RN  Intensity,  Lab  Intensity,  Markups,  and 
Charity  Care),  the  number  of  systems  scoring 
below the 50th percentile was greater than would 
be  expected  due  to chance  at p  < 0.10.  Of  the 
total  of  69 CVs calculated for systems, 46 scored 
below  the 50th  percentile  (p < 0.01)  and only 8 
scored  above  the  75th  percentile  (p < 0.01).

Looking  across  the  systems  we  find  that  most 
are characterized  by  high  levels of  systemness- 
only  three  systems  have  the  majority  of  their 
CVs  above  the  50th  percentile.  Hypothesis  5  is 
confirmed. 

Note that €or many of  the variables of  interest, 
such  as  ADMIN  COST  and  LERNER,  raw 
differences  at  the  hospital  level  become  more 
pronounced  and  often  statistically  significant 
when  analyzed at  the system level. This suggests 
that  hospital  level  analyses  may  mask  system 
level  effects,  and  reinforces  the  usefulness  of 
employing  multiple  levels  of  analysis. 

SYSTEM  CHARACTERISTICS AND 
SYSTEM PROFITS 

Table  9  reports  raw  and  percentile  scores  for 
OPMARGIN  and  OPMARGIN2.  Nine  of  13 
systems  score  above  the  50th  percentile  on 
OPMARGIN (p = 0.10) and  seven  score  above 
the  75th  percentile  (p  = 0.02).  This  superior 
profitability  is not an artifact of  patient selection. 
Indeed, 10 systems score above the 75th percentile 
in  OPMARGIN2,  which  adjusts  for  Medicaid 
and  charity  care (p = 0.01). 

It  is  natural  to  ask  what  factors  separate the

We  separately  considered  the  correlation  of 
for  LERNER2  and 
the  percentile 
OPMARGIN2.  The  Spearman  correlation  of 
0.67 is  significant  at p  < 0.02.  LERNER2 is, of 
course,  endogenous to  other  attributes such  as 
costs, service offerings,  and systemness.  Thus, it 
is  difficult  to  draw  any  conclusions  from  this 
simple correlation. lS 

We also regressed OPMARGIN on systemness 
at  the  hospital  level.  We  gave  each  nonsystem 
hospital  a  score  of  zero  on  the  systemness 
measure, and each system hospital  a score equal 
to  its  particular  system's  SYSTEMNESS  score. 
We  control  for  presence  in  a  system  and  for- 
profit  status.16  Results  appear  in  Table  11. 
Systemness is  related  to profits.  Decreasing  the 
SYSTEMNESS score by 10 points (i.e., increasing 
systemness)  is  associated  with  an  increase  in 
OPMARGIN of  0.02. 

CONCLUSIONS 

When market power is not an issue, most mergers 
are  presumably  made  to  realize  economies  of 
scale of  some form. It is often possible to identify 
a  number  of  ways  in  which  economies  of  scale 
are  present 
in  a  production,  distribution  or 
retailing process.  This does not  imply,  however, 
that  any  particular  set  of  governance  arrange- 
ments is necessary to achieve all possible econo- 
mies.  Nor  does this  imply  that  the purpose  of  a 
merger  was  to  achieve  all  possible  economies. 

Is  It  is  also  possible  that  system  hospitals  are  exploiting 
monopoly  rents  that  nonsystem  hospitals  are  leaving  unex- 
ploited.  Dranove  et  al.  (1993),  however,  offer  evidence  that 
pricing in  urban  California  markets is sufficiently constrained 
by  selectively  contracting  third-party  insurers  that  there  are 
few if  any  monopoly  rents  to exploit. 
lo  Again  the  model  can  be  interpreted  as  a  reduced  form 
where  other  endogenous  determinants  of  profitability  such 
as MEDICAID, CHARITY, and  LERNER  are excluded. If 
MEDICAID  and  CHARITY  are  included,  the  coefficient 
on  systemness  remains  significant.  Adding  LERNER  makes 
the  coefficient marginally  insignificant, because  LERNER  is 
itself  a  function  of  systemness.

Mergers may facilitate achieving scale economies 
when transactions cost or quality competition are 
sufficiently  problematic.  A  merger  can  be  said 
to have successfully exploited  economies of scale 
relative  to  independent  firms  if  there  are  some 
dimensions  of  behavior  on  which  the  merged 
firms  are  different  from  random  collections  of 
firms  with  similar  characteristics  which  presum- 
ably  must  pursue  economies independently.  We 
use this idea as the basis for our empirical analysis 
the  rationales  for  multihospital  systems. 
of 
Multihospital  systems  may  be  thought  of  as 
related  diversifications  in  which  physical  plants 
are not  merged.  We  identified  several  plausible 
dimensions  of  behavior  for hospitals  in  order to 
explain 
the  growth  of  multihospital  systems 
the  1980s.  We  examined  economies 
during 
in  production,  administration,  and  marketing. 
Production  and  administration  economies  were 
easy  to  define  in  terms  of  service  offerings  and 
administrative  costs.  Marketing  economies were 
more difficult to operationalize.  Marketing econ- 
omies  were  tied  to  a  reputatiodsearch  effect 
analogous to the economies enjoyed by fast food 
and  other  'brand  name'  consumer  businesses. 
We  chose 
the  achievement  of 
marketing economies by measuring the similarity 
of  the service mixes  and financial  profiles  across 
the  members  of  a  system  and  relating  this 
similarity measure  to pricing  and  profits.

We  found  that  hospital  systems  had  similar 
levels  of  service  offerings  and  administrative 
costs  as  random  collections  of  hospitals  with 
similar characteristics. We conclude that systems 
were  no  better  able  to  exploit  scale  economies 
on  these  dimensions  than  were 
independent 
hospitals.  We  found  that  system  hospitals  had 
more  homogeneous  service  mixes  and  financial 
profiles than did random collections of  hospitals. 
Moreover,  price-cost  margins  and  profits  were 
in  systems  with  greater  homogeneity. 
higher 
While we cannot determine whether the hospitals 
in systems were homogeneous  before they joined 
their  system  or  the  system  promoted  increased 
homogeneity,  the results  are still consistent with 
a searchh-eputation effect. 

If  our findings are valid, they are of  tremendous 
importance  for  future  strategy  research  on  the 
one  hand,  and  health  care  policy  on  the  other. 
Our  analysis  suggests  that  examining  the  range 
of  plausible  motives  for  diversification  is  not 
sufficient  to  identify  the  actual  motive.  Only  by 
comparing  merged  firms  with  an  appropriate 
comparison  group  can  one  sort  out  competing 
rationales.  Our  findings  in  hospital  markets 
suggest that the benefits of mergers may be more 
on the retailing side than on the production  side. 
Sutton  (1991)  presents  evidence  that  diversifi- 
cation  in  food  and  related  industries  have  had 
similar  benefits  on the  retailing  side.  We  would 
be  interested  in  comparing  these  findings  with 
those  that  may  emerge  from  similar  studies  in 
other  industries. 

Regarding health policy, current health reform 
efforts  at  both  national  and  state  levels  rely  on 
horizontally  and vertically integrated health  care 
systems to  contain  costs.  Our evidence  suggests 
that  horizontally  integrated  systems  have  been 
more  successful  in  marketing  the  consistency  of 
their  product  than  in  reducing  production  costs. 
While marketing  benefits do reduce  search  costs 
to  consumers,  they  translate  into  higher  price/ 
cost  margins.  Policies  promoting  system  growth 
may fail to realize the production  cost reductions 
that their  advocates apparently expect.

APPENDIX: CONSTRUCTING  THE 
PSEUDO  SYSTEMS 

We constructed  pseudo  systems as follows: 

1.  We included all nongovernment hospitals with 

at least  40 beds  in  the following  markets: 
Fresno,  Los  AngeledOrange County,  River- 
sideISan  Bernardino,  Sacramento,  San 
Francisco  and San Jose. There were  approxi- 
mately  200  hospitals  in this sample. 

2.  We  replicated  each hospital’s  data 200 times. 
This  enhanced  data  set  had  approximately 

40,000 hospital  replicates. 

3. Each  hospital  replicate  in  the enhanced data 
set  was  assigned  a  random  integer  whose 
range  depended  on  the  number  of  hospitals 
in  the  actual  system  being  considered.  For 
example, if the actual system had five hospitals, 
the  range  of  the  random  integers  was  1 to 
8000. 

4.  Hospital  replicates  were  aggregated  by  the 
randomly  assigned  integer  into  ‘pseudo  sys- 
tems.’  Continuing  the  above  example,  the 
number of  hospitals  in a pseudo system could 
range  up  to  8000  (in  the  unlikely  event  that 


74 

D. Dranove  and  M .  Shanley 

all  8000 hospital  replicates  received  the  same 
random  integer).  We  created  nearly  8000 
pseudo systems for potential  comparison with 
the actual system. (We could  have fewer than 
8000  if  some  integers  were  not  assigned  to 
any hospitals.) 

5.  We  restricted  attention  to 

those  pseudo 
systems with  an identical  number of  hospitals 
as  the  actual  system  in  question,  and  a 
comparable  number of  beds.  With  the excep- 
tion  of  the  eight  hospital  system, we  required 

the  number  of  beds  in  the  pseudo  system  to 
be within  5 percent  of  the number of  beds in 
the  actual  system.  For  the  eight  hospital 
system,  we  required  the  number  of  beds  to 
be  within  10 percent  of  the  number  of  beds 
in  the  actual  system.  This  was  necessary  to 
assure  an adequate sample. 

6.  This  process  generated  between  105 and  350 
pseudo systems to compare with the 13 actual 
systems.
