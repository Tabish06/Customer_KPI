ABSTRACT. Different theoretical approaches highlight
the growing relevance of corporate reputation as strategic
factor. Among these approaches the arguments of the
Resource-Based View are special worthwhile (Grant,
1991, California Management Review 33(3), 114–135;
Barney, 1999, Sloan Management Review Spring, 137–
145). Nevertheless, this topic poses several methodolog-
ical problems (Barney et al., 2001), as the unavailability to
identify and measure this organizational factor, that is
‘‘socially complex’’ and intangible in its nature. In this
work, using the ﬁndings of our empirical research on
Spanish biotechnology ﬁrms, we carry out an identiﬁca-
tion and measurement of corporate reputation, high-

Introduction

Nowadays, a good corporate reputation is one of the
main business assets responsible of sustained ﬁnancial
outcomes (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). This stra-
tegic potential
is due to its own value-creation
capability, and to its intangible character, because it
makes corporate reputation quite hardly to imitate by
competitors, allowing to maintain a superior posi-
tion. In the present day, we can state that business
management researchers and specially researchers
from the Resource-Based View (Barney, 1986, 1991;
Deephouse, 2000; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Grant,
1991) have highlighted its strategic nature.

and measurement

Although the intangible nature is a key charac-
teristic in order to grant its relevance, it also makes
very hard to perform a conceptual delimitation,
characterization,
(Deephouse,
2000). Corporate reputation holds a complex nature
(Barney, 1986; Dowling, 2001; Grant, 1991). Its
triggers are deeply rooted in the own organization,
and they are tied to its creation and evolution, in an
unique historically dependent context (Dierickx and
Cool, 1989). Thus, corporate reputation becomes
highly speciﬁc for each ﬁrm. This can be one of the
main reasons because there are so little effort in
studying a conceptual and empirical delimitation of
this asset (Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997). In
the
this vein, we must highlight

empirical research that tries to relate corporate rep-
utation and competitive advantage, the information
sources employed are mainly secondary (Deephouse,
2000; DeQuevedo, 2001). Among other things, this
fact is due to the problems that researchers ﬁnd to
make it operative.

Taking into account these problems, this work
provides a conceptual delimitation of corporate
reputation, as well as an identiﬁcation of its main
dimensions: business reputation and social reputa-
tion, and a measurement for it in order to determine
its nature empirically, and to allow its measurement.
In order to carry out this task, our work is built
upon the following main sections: (i) conceptual
delimitation; (ii) identiﬁcation of the main underly-
ing dimensions: business reputation and social repu-
tation; and (iii) the main conclusions of the study.

reputation,
Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar (1997) provide a syn-
thesis and comparison of how it has been treated from
the ﬁelds of Sociology, Marketing, Law, Accoun-
tancy, Economics,
and Business Management.
Within the ﬁeld of Business Management, there are
several contributions around corporate reputation.
Although it has been a quite common topic in the
literature, there is no agreement about what does it
mean and what does
include. The work of
Groenland (2002) tries to give some guidelines, de-
spite of the fact that the own author could found in its
empirical qualitative research (2002: 309), ‘‘corporate
reputation is,
in its essence, a mainly emotional
concept that is difﬁcult to rationalize and to explicit’’.
From the review of the different contributions
(Baden-Fuller et al., 2000; Deephouse, 2000; De
Quevedo, 2001; Dollinger et al., 1997; Fombrun,
1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Groenland,
2002; Petric et al., 1999; Rao, 1994; Shenkar and
Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 2002;
Weigelt and Camerer, 1988), as well as from the
characteristics provided by Fombrun and Van Reil
(1997), we can pose that corporate reputation is the
result of the process of ‘‘social legitimization’’ of the
ﬁrm. In this sense, we can understand corporate
reputation as the collective representation of actions
and outcomes of the past and present of the orga-

nization, that describe its capability to obtain valu-
able outcomes for different stakeholders.

The former deﬁnition is quite close to the one of
Barney’s (1999), who remarks the characteristics tied
to organizational capabilities – an unique historical
context, path dependence, social complexity, and
causal ambiguity. These characteristics make them
difﬁcult to create or accumulate, and corporate rep-
utation is pointed out as a clear example of all of this.
The present reputation of a certain ﬁrm is built or
accumulated in a historical context and in unique
circumstances
surely can not be repeated.
Besides, as Hall (1992) argues, his survey among
British managers shows that ﬁrm reputation and
product reputation need several years to be shaped.
This makes clear that the reputation is one of the
most difﬁcult to accumulate resources. Dierickx and
Cool (1989) argue that, in order to obtain a good
reputation,
about operations,
quality, etc. are needed.

several decisions

that

From the provided deﬁnition and the main
characteristics that it includes – causal ambiguity,
social complexity,
slow accumulation, and path
dependence – we can ﬁnd that corporate reputation
shows a high rate of tacitness and intangibility, and
this makes its identiﬁcation and measurement really
hard. We address this issue in the next section.

Social reputation and business reputation as
a key components of corporate reputation:
empirical evidence

Several authors highlight the complexity – and the
multidimensionality – of corporate reputation. Pre-
cisely Barney (1999) argues
that reputation is a
‘‘socially complex’’ capability. These socially com-
plex phenomena, as stated ﬁrstly in 1991, are out of
reach for ﬁrm ability in order to get a complete
inﬂuence and management, as Standiﬁrd (2001) says.
Deephouse (2000) points out that corporate repu-
tation is developed through time, with a socially
complex process in which the ﬁrm and its stake-
holders – internal and external – are involved.

In this sense, there are not agreements about its
conceptual delimitation. One of the most discordant
points refers to its multidimensionality (Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990). Dollinger et al. (1997) point out the
identifying
multidimensionality of

three main components for reputation: managerial
reputation, ﬁnancial reputation, and product repu-
tation. These dimensions are independent and rep-
resent different aspects of corporate reputation and
their role with different stakeholders.

From a Stakeholders Framework, another inter-
esting proposal is due to De Quevedo (2001). In her
research, she highlights the existence of two main
dimensions of corporate reputation: internal repu-
tation and external reputation. The ﬁrst one is
related with the ‘‘business stakeholders’’ perception
of ﬁrm activities – workers, managers, shareholders,
customers, allies, suppliers – and the second one is
related with the external stakeholders perception of
ﬁrm activities – society in general. These ﬁndings are
similar to Deephouse’s (2000) work.

The previous comments lead us to the determi-
nation of the multidimensionality of corporate rep-
utation as we have deﬁned it, from the analysis of the
composition and relations of each of the elements
that conﬁgure corporate reputation (Fombrun,
1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). These elements
are: (i) managerial quality; (ii) ﬁnancial strength; (iii)
product and service quality; (iv) innovation; (v) use
of corporate assets/efﬁciency;
(vi) capability to
gather, develop, and retain talented people; (vii)

social responsibility among the community; and
(viii) value of long term investments.

With the purpose to deepen into the data about
the elements of corporate reputation we carried out
a survey. It was sent to CEO of Spanish biotech-
nology ﬁrms. Following Rouse and Daellenbach
(1999), the use of a single industry is a necessary
condition to explore intrinsic and complex organi-
zational
success.
During 2003 our ﬁeld research reached a response
rate of 58% of the population (n=34 cases).

Then, we performed a factor analysis in order to
identify the conﬁguration of those elements. The

This appropriateness is supported by the Bartlett
test, which allows to refuse the hypothesis that the
correlation matrix would be an identity matrix, and
the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin index, holds a value near
to one (Table II). All of these tests claim for the
appropriateness of factor analysis in this case.

Now we proceed to extracting the factor axis, as

well as to interpret the results of Table III.

As we can see in the previous table, every com-
ponent of corporate reputation can be summarised in
one factor that explains 69% of the standard devia-
tion of the original data. The results of Table III, as
well as the high correlations among the elements of
reputation conﬁrm the conclusions of Fombrun and
Shanley (1990), although they obtained a factor that
counts for the 84% of the standard deviation from
the elements of reputation according to Fortune data.
The previous results conﬁrm the suspicions of
ﬁnancial bias in measuring reputation, a traditional
issue in this kind of research (Brown and Perry,
1994; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al.,
1990). This ﬁnancial halo or bias represents that the
assessments of the different elements of corporate
reputation are interpreted taking into account the
economic and ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm.

This bias comes from a homogeneous sample for
the survey. In our research, as it happens in Fortune,
participants
and industry
experts, whom are mainly worried about ﬁnancial
issues. This leads them to answer to the rest of
elements of corporate reputation in a similar way.

are general managers

This fact makes necessary to detect the possible
existence of a ﬁnancial halo in our measurement. If
its presence is conﬁrmed, we will try to eliminate it
using the methodology proposed by Brown and
Perry (1994).

In the scientiﬁc literature, there are two test for
detecting the ﬁnancial halo: (i) checking that in the
factor analysis every item supports an only axis, that
explains a wide portion of the standard deviation
(Dillon et al., 1984); and (ii) Brown and Perry
(1994) propose to use the determination coefﬁcient
of the regression that takes an independent variable
as ﬁnancial bias index, and measured reputation as
dependent variable. If the explained standard devi-
ation is high and signiﬁcant, this will be a sign of the
presence of ﬁnancial halo.

The ﬁrst of these tests for detecting the ﬁnancial
bias can be assessed using the results
shown in
Table III. As we have commented above, the eight
elements of corporate reputation contribute to an
only factor that explains almost the 69% of the
standard deviation of the original data. Although this
ﬁgure does not reach the 80% obtained by De
Quevedo (2001), we can conclude that there is a
clear sign of the existence of ﬁnancial halo.

The other test that we use is the one proposed by
Brown and Perry (1994). With it we try to deter-
mine the high and signiﬁcant inﬂuence of past per-
formance over the measure of present corporate
reputation. According to the original proposal, a
ﬁnancial halo index must be created in order to
measure the independent variable. This index was
built with the following operational and ﬁnancial

variables: (i) average ROA of the last 3 years; (ii)
market value over book value of the ﬁrm; (iii) sales
log; (iv) medium increase of sales during the last
3 years; and (v) risk, measured as the relation be-
tween debts and investment. The results of this work
show a portion of the standard deviation of the
dependent variable – the set of the eight components
of corporate reputation – explained by the ﬁnancial
halo index of 55%, higher than the detected by
McGuire et al. (1990) or Fombrun and Shanley
(1990). Nevertheless, the methodology developed
by Brown and Perry (1994) propose to perform nine
multiple regressions, one for each element of repu-
tation, and one more for the global reputation of
each ﬁrm.

Because of the speciﬁc characteristics of Spanish
biotechnology industry, specially because its emer-
gent state (according to the Asebio Report 2002,
40% of ﬁrms are younger than 2-years-old, and none
of the ﬁrms of the sample was a public company), we
decide to create the index according to the following
concepts: (i) average ROA of the last 2 years (2001
and 2000); (ii) 2001 sales log; (iii) medium increase
of sales during 2001 and 2000; and (iv) risk taken in
2001, measured as debts over total liabilities.

As a preliminary step to making the appropriate
multiple regression analysis, in Table IV we show the
correlations among the variables included in the study.
Then, in Table V, the results of the nine regres-
sions performed (one for each component of repu-
tation, and one for global reputation) are shown.
Each regression has been run over the total of our
sample, according to the following general expres-
sion for the regression equation:

Element ¼ b1 þ b2AVROA þ b3RISK01

þ b4SALELG01 þ b5SALEINCR þ e

Where, AVROA: average ROA during the years 2000
and 2001; RISK01: ﬁnancial risk taken in 2001 (total
investment over total liabilities); SALELG01: 2001 sales
log; SALEINCR: the average sales increase in 2001 with
respect to 2000.

Lastly, we show the residue of the estimation that
represents the value of each component of corporate
reputation free from ﬁnancial bias.

The results of the nine previous regressions show
a clear presence of ﬁnancial halo, due to the fact that
every regression holds high regression coefﬁcients,

signiﬁcant for acceptance values (Table V). Those
values are coherent with the results obtained and
validated by Brown and Perry (1994).

Once the ﬁnancial halo has been detected, we must
try to correct it. Following the methodology proposed
by Brown and Perry (1994), once the ﬁnancial halo has
been detected, with high and signiﬁcant R2, we must
eliminate it from the components of reputation. In
doing so, we accept that the residues obtained from the
regression, namely, the portion of component that is
not explained by the ﬁnancial halo index, are the
measurement of the components of corporate repu-
tation without ﬁnancial halo.

From these residues or components without
ﬁnancial halo, we run a new factor analysis
to
determine the dimensions of corporate reputation
(see Table VI).

Then, we proceed to extract the factorial axis, as

well as to discuss the results shown in Table VII.

Following the factor weight pattern we will

interpret the obtained factors.

The ﬁrst factor can be understood as the corporate
reputation related to the main issues of the core
business. This way, the component that holds a
higher correlation with this factor is product and
service quality, followed by the innovation degree of
the ﬁrm. Besides,
includes elements
related to investment value in the long run, the
efﬁciency in the use of corporate assets, and the
capability to attract, develop and retain talented
workers.

The second factor shows important weights of the
that
includes:
two variables or components
ﬁnancial
and green ﬁrm
and social
responsibility. Once the ﬁnancial bias has been
corrected, it seems coherent that social responsibility
will be apart from the rest of components of cor-
porate reputation. The lack of separation between
this element and the rest was exactly the beginnings
of the debate about the presence and correction of
ﬁnancial bias in the literature (Brown and Perry,
1994; Dillon et al., 1984). Thus, this result support
previous works and shows a new proof of bias cor-
rection.

Nevertheless, there is an interesting issue about
the inclusion of this element in the second factor,
with ﬁnancial
seems appropriate of
ﬁnancial strength to hold weak ties with the repu-
tation about product and service quality, or with

strength.

innovation rates. Nevertheless, to appear with ﬁrm
social responsibility can be explained. A priori,
according with the responses of the managers from
this industry, social and green responsibility was the
last element of corporate reputation ranked by rel-
evance (it counted for 7% of global reputation).
Thus, managers will only allocate resources to social
responsibility when ﬁnancial surplus will be avail-
able. This idea supports to include both elements
together in the second factor, that we named ‘‘social
reputation’’.

The obtained results and its discussion conﬁrm
the two dimensions of reputation obtained by De
Quevedo (2001) or just defended by Brown and
Perry (1994).

Once the two dimensions of corporate reputation
have been presented, we will discuss the validity and
reliability tests. Calculating Cronbach’s a we can
check the reliability degree of
the scale. The
obtained results show ﬁgures of 0.84 for the ﬁrst
factor and of 0.87 for the second one. These results
are higher than the critical level of 0.70, required for
accepting the reliability of the scales.

Both empirical literature review about corporate
reputation, and in-deep interviews conducted with
industry experts and managers (the ﬁrst stage of
ﬁeldwork) provide content validity for the proposed
measures.

From a theoretical perspective, we can afﬁrm the
degree of tacitness embedded in both dimensions of
corporate reputation (business reputation and social
reputation). This fact lies in the own complexity of
the components that corporate reputation holds (in
example, corporate governance and managerial
quality, capability to attract and retain talented
employees, innovation, or social and green respon-
sibility) and in the interrelations that appear among
these components (see Figure 1).

The second issue in determining complexity
degree, exogenous complexity, takes into account
the number of resources and capabilities that are
included in corporate reputation. The previous
paragraph and Figure 1 can justify this issue. In
testing it empirically we can again use the correlation
coefﬁcients, high and signiﬁcant, among the differ-
ent elements of
(in the
example, we ﬁnd a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of
0.794 between ‘‘corporate governance and mana-
gerial quality’’ and ‘‘product and service quality’’,
and of 0.695 between ‘‘innovation’’ and ‘‘efﬁciency
in using corporate assets’’) and the two elements that
conﬁgure the second dimension, ‘‘social reputation’’
(with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.782).
The complex nature of corporate reputation can be
seen graphically in Figure 1.

reputation’’

‘‘business

The commented issues lead us to state that, from
an empirical point of view, corporate reputation
holds a high level of complexity. This makes of it
one of the more complex ﬁrm capabilities. Although
this characteristic has been extensively highlighted
by the authors of the Resource-Based View (Amit
and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1986, 1991; Grant,
1991; Roberts and Dowling, 2002), our descriptive
analysis tests this point empirically.

Conclusions: the business and social
dimensions of corporate reputation

This work presents an exploratory analysis of cor-
porate reputation, focused on determining its key
dimensions empirically. Thus, according to other
theoretical approaches
(stakeholders) and previous
works (Deephouse, 2000; DeQuevedo, 2001), we
have found two key components:

– Business reputation, that includes the different
aspects of corporate reputation related to the
agents and stakeholders
that appear closely
tied to the business activities and processes of
the ﬁrm, as customers, suppliers, managers or
employees.

– Social reputation, which is the result of the in-
sights and perceptions of other stakeholders
that are not so close to day by day business
activities, as investors and the community in a
wider sense.
