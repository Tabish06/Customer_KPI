Determinants of the Firm to Acquire ISO14001 Certificate   

and Market Valuation of the Certified Firm 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Abstract 

 
This paper examines the incentives for a firm to acquire an ISO14001 certificate and 
the  effect  of  such  an  acquisition  on  the  market  value  of  the  firm.  We  show  that  the 
firms  with  a  larger  size,  larger  export  ratio,  higher  profitability  and  higher  R&D 
expenditure have more incentive to acquire the ISO14001 certificate. Further, firms in 
Medicaments,  Metal,  Transportation  Equipment,  Precision  Machinery,  and  Other 
Manufacturing have less incentive for the acquisition. In addition, after controlling for 
sample  selection  bias,  we  found  that  the  introduction  of  the  ISO14001  certification 
system  contributes  to  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  market  value  of  the 
firms  by  11%  to  14%.  Our  results  suggest  that  the  stock  market  gives  firms  the 
incentive to acquire the ISO14001 certificate.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Although governments in many countries have traditionally relied mainly on mandatory environmental 
regulations, economic instruments such as environmental taxes and charges, economic supports and emission 
trading  are  drawing  increasing  attention.  This  is  because  these  economic  instruments  are  considered  to 
minimize the cost to protect the environment and to be more efficient in reducing pollutant emission. 

 

However, because of the difficulty of reaching a public consensus on introducing environmental taxes 
and emission trading systems, governments have given attention to a “voluntary” approach as an alternative or 
as a complement to the present system. Above all, there is a growing belief in the need to provide firms with the 
flexibility to set their own technical goals and to achieve environmental targets. These movements have led to 
reliance on policies promoting voluntary action by firms, such as voluntary programs, voluntary agreements 
between firms and the government on environmental targets, and certified environmental management systems. 
The  adoption  of  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS),  one  form  of  voluntary  action 
contributing to environmental protection, is often expected to help firms identify their environmental goals and 
reduce energy consumption, polluting waste, and the risk of future environmental liability.  

 

 

Recently, the number of facilities and firms that have introduced certified EMSs, such as ISO(the 
International Organization for Standardization) 14001 and  EMAS(the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme), 
has been increasing.  Corresponding to the promotion of self-regulating environmental behavior, increasing 
attention has been paid to the mechanisms underlying firms’ incentive.1 Understanding why firms actively seek 
ISO14001 certificates is a very interesting topic. Because firms are expected to pursue profit maximization, 
voluntary  actions  to  promote  environmental  achievement,  such  as  the  adoption  of  the  ISO14001,  seems 
inconsistent with the firms’ ultimate aim.  

The  ISO14001  is  particularly  interesting  to  analyze  for  several  reasons.  First,  the  number  of 
ISO14001-certified facilities overwhelms that of EMAS-certified facilities and continues to grow very rapidly.2 
As of June 2003, the world total of certified facilities was 46,836 and the number of certified facilities in Japan 
was 12,392, nearly 25% of the world total, which far surpasses the world’s second most certified nation, Spain, 

                                                   

1 Previous studies, such as Arora and Cason [2, 3], and DeCanio and Watkins [7], among others, have used logit models to analyze 

what determines firms’ decisions to undertake voluntary action to contribute to environmental protection. However, most of these 

studies focus on U.S. voluntary programs such as Green Lights’ 33/50 programs. DeCanio and Watkins [7] investigated what 

determined over 9000 U.S. firms to participate in the Green Lights Program. They found that firm-specific variables, such as firm 

size, earnings, and insider shareholding significantly affect the firm’s participation decision. Arora and Cason [2, 3] attempted to 

explain firms’ participation decisions in the EPA’s 33/50 program by their size, financial characteristics, and so on. They found 

that firm size and industry effects significantly affect the firms’ decisions, whereas financial variables, such as debt ratios, are 

insignificant in explaining firms’ decisions. 

2 For example, in the three years between December 1999 and June 2003, the number of ISO14001-certified facilities in Japan 

grew about fourfold, from 2881 to 12,392 (Japanese Standards Association [14]).

with 3960 certified facilities.3 (ISO World [12]). Second, the ISO14001 is a process standard, not a technical 
standard, and it can be applied to a broad category of industries, allowing us to analyze the behavior of firms in 
a more general sense.4  

In spite of such rapid diffusion of the ISO14001, there are only a few studies analyzing its performance 
and adoption by firms or facilities (Nakamura, et al. [22] and Welch et al. [24]). Such studies usually focus on 
the motivation of the firm or facility to be certified. However, they pay little attention to issues such as the 
performance  of  the  ISO14001,  whether  the  acquisition  of  the  ISO14001  certificate  is  rewarded  in  the 
marketplace, and whether the adoption of an ISO14001 certificate contributes to environmental improvements. 
Hence, the ISO14001s are still not well understood quantitatively.  

From an environmental policy perspective, it is important to explore the performance of the stock 
market in the context of the ISO14001, that is, whether the stock market values certified firms. This is because 
the valuation of the market is related to the incentive of firms to voluntarily act to protect the environment. If 
investors expect that the certified firms have a positive effect in reducing current and future pollution and that 
the  adoption  of  the  ISO14001  will  lead  in  the  future  to  lower  risk  of  environmental  liability  and  higher 
profitability, then the firm’s market value will appreciate in accordance with stock market prices. Then, firms 
are strongly motivated to adopt the ISO14001.  

The purposes of this study are (1) to explore what factors determine whether Japanese manufacturing 
firms adopt the ISO14001, and (2) to explore whether the stock market values the acquisition of ISO14001 
certificates and thus gives firms an incentive to adopt the ISO14001. 

Section  2  gives  a  brief  overview  of  theoretical  considerations,  and  presents  two  models  on  the 
determinants  of  the  decision  and  market  valuation.  Section  3  describes  the  dataset  and  analyzes  the 
characteristics of variables. Section 4 presents new empirical evidence for the models. Section 5 draws some 
broad conclusions.  

 

 

2. MODELS 

We analyze two issues: first, the determinants of Japanese manufacturing firms adopting the ISO14001, 

and second, whether the stock market values the acquisition of the ISO14001. 

 

2.1 A model for the decision of firms to acquire an ISO14001 certificate 

With  regard  to  the  first  issue,  a  firm’s  motivational  analysis,  there  are  a  few  empirical  studies. 
Nakamura et al. [22] and Welch et al. [24], the pioneering studies in this field, explored the determinants of 
firms acquiring an ISO14001 certificate.  

Nakamura et al. [22] used data collected from a questionnaire sent to randomly selected firms from the 

                                                   

3 Japan and Spain were followed by Germany, with 3820 certified facilities, the U.S with 3032, Sweden with 2961, and the U.K. 

with 2917. 

4 For a more detailed description of the ISO14001, see Welch et al. [24].

Japanese  manufacturing  firms  listed  in  the  First  Section  of  the  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange.  Estimation  results 
showed that firm size, the average age of firm employees, the export ratio, and the debt ratio affect the decision 
making  of  the  firms  to  be  certified.  In  addition,  they  concluded  that  polluting  industries  are  keener  than 
less-polluting industries to adopt the ISO14001. Further, advertising is statistically significant only under some 
specifications and thus has only limited effects on firms’ decision making.  

Welch et al. [24] focused on four industries in Japan: chemical, electronics, electric machinery, and 
electric power. They studied which of three broadly accepted reasons for the adoption of ISO14001 (regulation, 
competitive  advantage,  and  social  responsibility)  plays  a  larger  role  in  each  type  of  industry.  Using  data 
collected  from  a questionnaire  sent to  the facilities,  they  showed  that  the early adopters  tend  to be  larger, 
greener, and less driven by external pressure such as regulatory, competitive, or media pressures. 

In these previous studies, only a limited dataset was available or used. For example, Welch et al. [24] 
focused on only the four most certified industries. Nakamura et al. [22] used only a part of samples available by 
randomly selecting firms from the original dataset to carry out the questionnaire survey. In addition, these 
analyses were based on data collected before the end of 1999 (1997 for Nakamura et al. [22] and 1999 for 
Welch  et  al.  [24]).  However,  since  that  date,  the  number  of  certified  facilities  has  quadrupled  in  Japan. 
Moreover, although it is positive that Welch et al. [24], unlike Nakamura et al. [22] and our study, explored the 
facility’s incentive for the adoption, they did not use data on the business and financial performance of the firms, 
to which the facilities belong, because of data unavailability. Hence, they did not take into account the effect of 
firms’ business and financial performance on the decision making.  

To  solve  these  problems,  we  use  data  from  March  2002,  including  the  financial  and  business 
performance data of all (rather than randomly selected) Japanese manufacturing firms listed in the First Section 
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 

The firm is supposed to determine whether to acquire a certificate5 based on the net benefit, including 
economic and non-economic factors, from the acquisition of the certificate. The ith firm’s net benefit from the 
acquisition, Bi, is specified as follows: 

B
i

=

X

εθ +
i
i

1

 

(1) 

where ε1i is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation of σ1, and we denote X1i as a vector of 
exogenous variables for the ith firm, including firm attributes such as size and profitability.  
In practice, Bi is unobservable and what we observe is the firm’s choice decision: 

DISO

1=i

 if 

iB

> 0 

                                                   

5 In our study, following Nakamura et al. [22], we define a firm as “certified” if at least one of the facilities belonging to it acquires 

the ISO14001certificate.

where DISOi is a dummy variable, with DISOi = 1 indicating that the firm has acquired the ISO14001 certificate 
and DISOi = 0 indicating that it has not obtained it. 

Given this specification, the probability of the acquisition decision of the firm is given by:

2.2 A model for the valuation of the market 

Although some previous studies analyzed the effect of the environmental performance of publicly traded 
firms on their market value, no previous study examined the effect of the adoption of ISO14001 on the market 
value of firms. 

Earlier literature on the effect of environmental performance on market valuation found some evidence 
of a relationship between an indication of bad (good) environmental performance by a firm (e.g. oil spills, toxic 
release) and a lower (higher) market valuation. Klassen and McLaughlin [16] observed a statistically significant 
negative abnormal return when there was a media report involving bad environmental news on the firm, such as 
oil spills, and Hamilton [9] observed a similar phenomenon with respect to the toxic release inventory (TRI) 
announcement  in  1989.  Klassen  and  McLaughlin  [16]  also  found  a  positive  return  when  firms  achieved 
environmental success. 

Konar and Cohen [18], who went beyond the event studies and used a more objective measure of 
environmental performance, found that bad environmental performance has a significant negative effect on the 
intangible asset value of publicly traded firms and that a higher level of toxin emission results in a significant 
economic loss by the firm. In addition, they found that the trend is more conspicuous in heavily polluting 
industries. 

In our study, we investigated the effect of acquiring the ISO14001 certificate on the market value of 
the  firm.  The  firm’s  action  in  contributing  to  environmental  protection  is  expected  to  affect  the  future 
profitability of the firm by reducing the future risk of environmental liability. Therefore, if the adoption of the 
ISO14001 can contribute to the establishment of a good image, so that firms are viewed as environmentally 
sound and at less risk of future environmental liability, the ISO14001 can be supposed to increase the firm’s 
current market value. This is because, for the purpose of this study, we should pay attention to the stock price or 
the market value of the firm rather than the current financial performance over time, as in Hirsch and Seaks [10] 
and Konar and Cohen [18]. 

As in previous studies, we rely on the assumption of an efficient capital market (Fama [8]) and explore 

                                                   

6 Without loss of generality, we normalize σ1 = 1.

the relation between Tobin’s q as the market value of a firm and the ISO14001 certification status.7

The market value of a firm can be disaggregated into its tangible and intangible assets (Konar and 
Cohen [18]). We follow this approach because we believe that intangible assets are more directly influenced by 
environmental action and the image of a firm. Tangible assets consist of the replacement value of property, 
plant and equipment, cash, inventory, and so on. Intangible assets are valued based broadly on “reputation” and 
the “valued added” to a firm through its efforts at product differentiation (e.g. patents, trademarks, brand names, 
and the good image of a firm). These “reputation” factors can affect value both positively and negatively. For 
example, well-made commercials may contribute to the higher value of an intangible asset, whereas news of 
corruption by a firm can lower the value of the firm. Therefore, it is natural to think that the environmentally 
friendly image or action of a firm directly affects intangible assets. In this context, the market may view the 
adoption of an ISO14001 certificate as a sign that the risk of future liability due to pollution has been reduced. 
Thus, the adoption of the certificate improves the public image of a firm and results in an increase in investor 
confidence.  

The market value of the firm can be written as: 

VMV

=

T V
+
I

 

(4) 

where MV is the market value of the firm, and VT and VI are the portions of the firm value attributable to the 
tangible assets and the intangible assets of the firm respectively. We measure the value of the tangible assets as 
the replacement cost (RC) of the firm, which is estimated using accounting-based values for the assets of the 
firm. As subcomponents of VT and VI are not observable, we need to undertake some manipulations. From 
equation (4) and the definition of Tobin’s q, Tobin’s q can be expressed as: 

q

=

MV
RC

V
I+=
RC

1

 

We hypothesize that the Tobin’s q of the firm i is affected by the decision to acquire an ISO14001 
certificate, as well as by the attributes of the firm, such as size and profitability. To estimate the effects of 
various factors on the Tobin’s q of the firms, we postulate the model as follows:  

q

i

=

X

2

αθ
i

+

2

DISO
i

+

ε
2

i

 

 (5) 

where we denote qi as the Tobin’s q of the firm i, ε2i as a random error term following a normal distribution, X2i 
as a vector of the firm i, containing the explanatory and control variables such as the attributes of the firm, and 
DISOi as the same dummy variable shown in (2). 

We should note that the decision of the firm to acquire an ISO14001 certificate, DISOi, cannot be 

                                                   

7 Under an efficient capital market, if the investors expect that more polluting firms with greater future risks of environmental 

liability will gain less profit in the future, their current stock price or their current market value will decrease.

treated as exogenous, because the decision is likely to be affected by the same observable and unobservable 
factors that determine qi. For example, given an unpredicted positive technological shock, a firm may be more 
likely to obtain the certificate, simply because it will be easier for them to acquire the certificate. At the same 
time, the firm’s market value will be positively affected by the improvement in productivity. To correct for a 
bias due to self-selection in the estimation of the equation (5), we use the two-step procedure suggested by Lee 

and Trost [19] and Barnow et al. [4]. First, we calculate the predicted probability 

iPˆ

 of the ith firm, as indicated 

in equation (3), using the estimation results from the model for the decision of the firm to adopt the ISO14001 

certificate. Then, after replacing DISO

i in equation (5) with 

iPˆ

, we estimate equation (6) by linear least squares, 

regressing q

i on predicted probability as an explanatory variable, as well as X2i. Thus, we obtain:

. 

With regard to the specification of Tobin’s q, Hirsch and Seaks [10] found it is more likely that market 
value determinants have multiplicative effect on q . Thus, the semi-log linear specification is preferable to the 
linear specification. Hence, for comparison, we estimate an alternative to equation (6), as follows:

3. DATA and VARIABLES 

We focus on the publicly held firms in the manufacturing industry in the first section of the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. After eliminating missing values from the samples, the total number of samples for the analysis was 
573 on March 31, 2002.8 Most of the data were obtained from Nikkei Needs, whereas the information on the 
ISO14001 certificate status of facilities was obtained from the Japanese Standard Association [14]. 

 

3.1 Variables used in the model I, the effect of the decision behavior of the firm on the ISO14001 acquisition 

We explore how current and future profitability, size, financial performance, product type, composition 
of shareholders, the degree of the contact with consumers, and some other factors affect the decision of the firm

Tokyo Stock Exchange.

to be certified in the model.  

The  decision  to  adopt  the  ISO14001  is  made  primarily  at  the  facility  level.  Therefore,  all  of  the 
facilities that belong to a firm do not necessarily adopt the ISO14001. In our study, following Nakamura et al. 
[22], we define a firm that has at least one certified facility among all its facilities as “a certified firm”.9 The 
variables used in the estimations and the definitions are listed in Table 1.

We use profitability (PSR), debt ratio (DR), capital growth (CG), sales growth (SG), and rate of capital 
turnover (CTR) as proxies of the current profitability of a firm, the financial soundness, the productivity of 
capital, the expected growth, and the potential productivity growth, respectively. The number of employees at a 
firm (N) is used to control for differences in the size of firms. Acquisition of the ISO14001 certificate involves 
some substantial fixed costs, which become less significant for larger facilities. Therefore, firm size may affect 
the firms’ decision regarding adoption. 

The adoption of the ISO14001 may depend on how much of the firm’s products are exported (ER), as 
more  export-oriented  firms  might obtain greater  benefits  from  adoption if  their trade partners  are  keen on 
environmental  protection.  Thus,  they  would  be  more  interested  in  obtaining  an  internationally  recognized 
certificate that would act as a visible sign for their foreign partners. Therefore, we use ER to control for the 

                                                   

9 The analysis of facilities’ motivations by Welch et al. [24], among others, could be more realistic if the business and financial 

performance data of their “parent” firm were available. However, we apply this assumption to this analysis because of the data 

limitation and the linkage of this model with the analysis on Tobin’s q.

degree of the firms’ export-orientation. 

The composition of shareholders may also affect the decision making of a firm, because different types 
of shareholders have different perspectives and information. There are four types of shareholders, individual 
investors  (IS),  government  (GS),  financial  institutions,  and  foreign  investors  (FS).  We  use  proportions  of 
shareholding by individual investors, by government, and by foreign investors as proxy variables representing a 
composition of shareholders.  

We use advertisement expenditure (AD) as a proxy for the degree of contact with consumers. Firms 
with larger AD expenditure are more likely to retain close contact with final consumers and the public, and thus 
are more likely to internalize environmental values held by the public.  

We use R&D expenditure (R&D) as a proxy representing the future perspective of a firm, which means 
that firms with a larger R&D have a longer-term perspective. Hence, the firms with larger R&D are supposed to 
be more interested in becoming certified to avoid the future risk of environmental liability and to increase their 
expected longer-term profit. 

Ideally, AD and R&D should be stock measures. However, because of data limitation and our inability 
to obtain comparable data in most of the cases, we measure the AD (R&D) variable by summing the AD (R&D) 
expenditure of a firm in three consecutive years between 1999 and 2002.10

We use industry dummies as proxy variables representing the industry-wide effects. For example, 
these dummies control for the possibility that firms in a heavy-polluting industry might have more incentive to 
be certified to avoid future environmental liability and to obtain public acceptance for their production and their 
location.11 12  

 

3.2 Variables used for the model of market valuation 

In this model, we explore how the current and potential profitability of the firm, the market type, the 
acquisition of the ISO14001, and so on, affect the market valuation of the firm. The data and variables used in 
this model are explained above and as follows. 

We should note here that some of the data used in both estimations retain different interpretations. For 
example,  as  we  mentioned  before,  R&D  represents  forward-looking  behavior  by  a  firm  in  the  context  of 

                                                   

10 We use the fiscal year, taking data from April 1999 to March 2002. We sum R&D and AD over three years and the variables are 

discounted using a GDP deflator relating to these three years.  

11 We have 15 categories of industries, as indicated in Table 4, and we set electronic machinery as a base industry when defining 

industry dummy variables.  

12 We could use one year lagged variables for all explanatory variables as it is more reasonable to assume that the firm’s ISO14001 

acquisition decision depends on the characteristics of the firm in the previous years. However, as each firm has been certified in a 

different year, such an assumption regarding the decision timing is artificial. We are simply presenting a snapshot view of the 

diffusion process. Using panel data analysis, we could take into consideration the fact that firms obtained ISO14001 certificates at 

different points of time. This topic is left for future research.

The Market Value of the Firm 

 

The value of the stock is calculated using the account-end stock market price multiplied by the number of 
shares outstanding (MSV) on March 31, 2002. The values of long-term debt and short-term debt (DV) for the 
firm are obtained from Nikkei Needs. Therefore, the market value of the firm is calculated as follows:

The Replacement Cost of the Firm 

The  replacement  cost  of  the  firm  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  liquid  assets  (LA),  property,  plant  and 

equipment (PPE), and investment (I), as follows:

In addition, we use current profit ratio, sales growth, capital growth, capital turnover ratio, the number 
of workers at a firm, export sales–gross sales ratio, advertising expenditure, R&D expenditure, and industry 
dummies as independent variables. 

Comanor and Wilson [6] showed that firms in more concentrated industries have a higher Tobin’s q. 
Because of the unavailability of consistent concentration data, we use the industry dummies as the proxy for the 
market  condition.  Industry  dummies  also  represent  the  other  industry-wide  effects.  For  example,  these 
dummies control for the possibilities that a lower Tobin’s q in a heavy-polluting industry might be due to more 
investment on pollution-control equipment. 

Tables 3 shows the basic statistics of the samples, whereas Table 4 reports the total number of samples 
and the number of certified firms in each industry in the total samples. The number of total samples and the 
number of certified firms are 573 and 345, respectively, and the share of certified firms is 60.2%.13 The shares 
of certified firms in paper and pulp, rubber, non-ferrous metal and electric machinery are higher, whereas their 
shares in metal and other manufacturing industries are relatively lower. 

 

                                                   

13 The share of certified firms is 31.6% in Nakamura et al. [22] and the share of the certified facilities is 48% in Welch et al. [24].

4.1 A model for the Acquisition of the ISO14001 certificate 

4. ESTIMATION RESULTS 

The estimation results for the discrete choice model articulated in equations (1) and (2) are shown in 
Table 5. The parameters for DR, SG, FS, GS, AD, CTR and some industry dummies are insignificant even at 
10%, but the other parameters are significant. The proportion correctly classified is 75.4%.14  

The positive coefficient on PSR and the negative one on its square mean that more profitable firms 
have more incentive to be certified. Likewise, the positive coefficient on N and the negative one on its square 
mean  that  larger  firms  have  more  incentive  to  be  certified.  Again,  the  positive  coefficient  on  ER  and  the 
negative one on its square mean that more export-oriented firms have more incentive to be certified. However, 
in all cases, as profitability, firm size, and the share of exports increase, the likelihood of the firm voluntarily 
acquiring the certificate increases at a decreasing rate.  

By contrast, the parameter for the debt ratio is insignificant and we find that financial soundness does 
not affect the firm’s decision to be certified. This same result was reported in previous studies – for example, 
Arora and Cason [2] found that financial soundness does not affect firms’ self-regulating behavior in regard to 
participation in voluntary environmental protection programs, such as the EPA’s 33/50 program.  

With regard to the variables relating to the stockholder’s share, the coefficient on IS is significantly 
negative, whereas the coefficients on GS and FS are insignificant. This means that for firms where a greater 
proportion of shares is held by an individual investor, there is less incentive to be certified than for those firms 

                                                   

14 We conducted a Likelihood Ratio Test and rejected the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero at the 1% significance level 

(χ2 = 219.0447).

that have a range of financial, government, and foreign investors.  

The  positive  coefficient  on  R&D  indicates  that  firms  with  larger  R&D  expenditure  have  more 
incentive to be certified. However, the parameter on advertising expenditure is insignificant, indicating that 
consumer pressure does not necessarily affect the decision of the firm.15

The signs of the coefficients on industry dummies for Medicaments, Metal, Transportation Equipment, 
Precision Machinery and Other Manufacturing are significantly negative, whereas the coefficients on the other 
industry dummies are insignificant. This indicates that firms in the specified industries have less incentive to be 
certified  than  firms  in  the  other  industries.  The  firms  with  the  least  incentive  to  be  certified  are  in  Other 
Manufacturing, followed, in order, by firms in Precision Machinery, Medicaments, Transportation Equipment, 
and Metal.

4.2 A model for Tobin’s q 

The estimation results for equations (6) and (7) are shown in Table 6. As for equation (6), the parameters 
for predicted probability of ISO14001 acquisition, PSR square and ER are significant at the 5%, 1%, and 10% 
significance level, respectively. The sign on the predicted probability of ISO14001 acquisition is positive. This 
implies  that  the  market  values  environmentally  friendly  behavior  by  firms  and  that  the  acquisition  of  the 
ISO14001 certificate increases the valuation of the firm. The sign on PSR square is positive, as expected, 
although the parameter for PSR is insignificant. The sign on ER is also positive. These results indicate that 
higher profitability and higher ER increase the valuation of the firm. It is likely that the market expects that the

recession, which has been affecting the Japanese economy for a long time, does not affect firms with a higher 
ER so adversely as it does less export-oriented firms.  

The parameters for SG, CG, and CTR are significant at the 10%, 1%, and 5% significance levels, 
respectively,  with  positive  signs.  These  variables,  which  are  proxies  for  current  and  expected  growth  and 
productivity, are positively correlated with the valuation of the firm, as is expected.  

The parameters for N and AD are insignificant, indicating that the size of the firm and the closeness of 
the firm’s product to the consumer do not affect the market value of the firm. In addition, the parameter for 
R&D  is  insignificant,  which  means  the  market  values  that  R&D  is  not  necessarily  linked  to  the  future 
profitability. 

Industry  dummies  represent  the  market  condition  and  the  industry  effects.  The  parameters  for 
dummies of non-ferrous metal and of precision machinery are significant at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively, 
with positive signs. All other significant dummies, for steel, general machinery, and transportation equipment, 
are significant at the 10% level with negative signs. The parameters for the other dummies are insignificant.

With regard to the estimation results for the alternative specification, equation (7), as are reported in 
Table 6, the parameter for predicted probability of ISO14001 acquisition is significant at the 1% with a positive 
sign again. Hence, the result in the alternative specification also shows that the market values environmentally 
friendly behavior by firms.  

The parameters for CG and CTR are also significant at 1%, while the parameters for SG and ER are 
significant at 5% and 10%, respectively. The signs on these parameters are positive, which is the same result as 
in the estimation for equation (6). We found a convex relation between Tobin’s q and profitability, as the result 
shows that the coefficients on the linear and quadratic terms of PSR are both positive and significant. The 
specifications of equations (6) and (7) produce similar results except for some industry dummies.  

A larger number of industry dummies are significant in equation (7), including all those that were 
significant  in  the  specification  of  equation  (6).  Only  food,  textile,  pulp,  and  other  manufacturing  were 
insignificant. The parameters for dummies of non-ferrous metal, precision machinery, and medicaments are 
positive. All the other significant dummies retain negative signs. 

Finally, to estimate the economic value of the certified environmental management system for the 
market, we calculated the increase in expected market value of the firms due to introduction of the ISO14001 to 
the current system, using the estimation results. The increase in the expected market value is estimated to be 
11% from the specification of equation (6) and 13.5% from the specification of equation (7), as indicated in 
Table 7.

Table 8 shows differences across industries in the extent to which the ISO14001 contributes to market 
value. The advantage of introduction of the ISO14001 is relatively small in metal, transportation equipment, 
and precision machinery, which is consistent with the estimation of industrial dummies obtained in the probit 
estimation. Significantly, all these industries retain larger negative coefficients on their dummy variables (Table 
5), which implies that the probability of adopting the ISO14001 certificate is relatively small in these three

The introduction of the certified environmental management system, ISO14001, is expected to play an 
important role in environmental protection. Despite this, few empirical studies have been conducted on the 
factors that determine the adoption of the ISO14001 certificate. In this paper, we explore the impact of adopting 
the ISO14001 on the financial market, as well as analyzing firms’ incentives to adopt ISO14001. 

In previous studies on this topic, limited datasets were available or used. For example, Welch et al. [24] 
focused on only the four most certified industries. Unlike Nakamura et al. [22] and this study, Welch et al. [24] 
explored the certified facilities’ incentives for adopting the ISO14001. However, as data were unavailable, they 
were not able to analyze the effect on the decision-making process of the business and financial performance of 
the firms to which the certified facilities belong. Nakamura et al. [22] randomly selected firms from a dataset to 
carry out questionnaire surveys, and thus use only part of the samples available. Even more significantly, both 
these analyses were based on data collected before the end 1999, but since that date, the number of certified 
facilities in Japan has been rapidly increasing.  

To solve these problems, we used more recent data, dating from March 2002, which includes financial 
and business performance data for all (rather than randomly selected) Japanese manufacturing firms listed in the 
First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In our study, using these data for a large sample of firms, we 
explored the characteristics of the firms that determine the acquisition of the ISO14001 certificate. In addition,

we  examined  whether  the  stock  market  values  such  voluntary  action  by  the  firm  to  contribute  towards 
environmental protection. 

From the estimation results, we found that the firms with a larger size, larger export ratio, higher 
profitability and higher R&D expenditure have more incentive to acquire the ISO14001 certificate. Further, 
firms in Medicaments, Metal, Transportation Equipment, Precision Machinery, and Other Manufacturing have 
less incentive for the acquisition.  

In  addition,  we  observed, after  controlling  for  sample  selection  bias, that  the  stock market  values 
voluntary action that contributes to environmental protection. Thus, the acquisition of the ISO14001 certificate 
increases the market value of a firm, reflecting an expected reduction in the potential risk of environmental 
liabilities. We also found that the introduction of the ISO14001 certification system contributes to an increase in 
the market value of the firms of between 11% and 14%, depending on specifications.  

Our results suggest that the stock market gives firms the incentive to voluntarily acquire the ISO14001 
certificate because it gives firms better access to credit markets. There are several possible reasons why the 
ISO14001 certificate status of a firm has been positively incorporated in market valuation. One of the biggest 
factors is that possession of the certificate is a simple and obvious proof of “environmentalist” firms, which will 
have a lower risk of environmental liabilities and lower adjustment costs if environmental policy is tightened in 
the future. 

Finally, we should note that these estimations might be overestimated. The adoption of the ISO14001 
is one of the tools contributing to the protection of the environment. Certified firms  might adopt different 
environmental management tools at the same time and be aggressive in reducing pollution. Hence, adoption of 
the ISO14001 might become a proxy of such behavior. Thus, in this study, the effects of the ISO14001 on 
Tobin’s q, which indicates the market valuation of the firm, might also include the effects of adopting different 
tools and undertaking pollution reducing practices. Nevertheless, we believe that our results remain valid in 
exploring the motivations for firms to self-regulate their behavior to ensure environmental protection and in 
analyzing whether the Japanese stock market values such environmentally sound behavior. 

We consider that our results provide evidence in support of the voluntary approach as an effective 
environmental policy instrument that can take advantage of the market incentive mechanism. Our results are 
important,  because  voluntary  approaches,  such  as  the  certified  environmental  management  system,  the 
voluntary  environmental  protection  program,  can  offer  certain  advantages  over  mandatory  regulations  that 
impose  technology  restrictions  or  environmental  taxes.  First,  the  voluntary  approach  allows  flexibility  in 
reaching  the  firm’s  environmental  goals,  and  thus  may  be  more  efficient  in  minimizing  the  cost  of 
environmental  protection.  Second,  it  may  reduce  information  costs  and  the  administrative  burden  on 
environmental  authorities.  Finally,  it  avoids  a  lengthy  political  process  that  would  be  necessary  for  public 
acceptance of mandatory regulations and environmental taxes.  

We  propose  that  policies  such  as  information  disclosure  of  firms’  pollution  emissions,  or  the 
introduction  of  a  ranking  system  of  firms  and  their  products,  based  on  their  pollution  and  environmental 
soundness, will play an important role in enabling the market to value firms. Thus, it will motivate firms to 
actively self-regulate to ensure environmental protection. 

From the environmental policy perspective, it is important to understand fully several issues related to 
the ISO14001. We believe that the following important questions should form the basis for future research: first,

what  properties  of  the  ISO14001  make  it  possible  to  reward  firms  in  the  marketplace;  second,  will  the 
ISO14001 fulfill its promise as an instrument of environmental policy and contribute to pollution reduction; and 
finally, why is the ISO14001 far more prevalent in Japan than in the rest of the world.
