We decompose  the  inter-firm  variance  in  profit  rates  into  economic  and  organizational 
components.  Using  a  representative  model from each paradigm  we find  that  both  sets  of 
factors are sign@cant  determinants  of  firm performance.  Further findings  are  that  the  two 
effects are roughly independent and that organizational factors  explain about twice as much 
variance in profit  rates as economic factors. 

INTRODUCTION 

In  the  business  policy  literature  there  are  two 
major  streams of  research  on  the  determinants 
of  firm  performance.  One  is  based  primarily 
upon  an  economic  tradition,  emphasizing  the 
importance  of  external  market  factors  in  deter- 
mining  firm  success.  The other  line  of  research 
builds on the behavioral and sociological paradigm 
and sees organizational  factors and their  fit  with 
the  environment  as  the  major  determinants of 
success. Within this school of thought, little direct 
attention  is  given  to  the  firm’s  competitive 
position.  Similarly,  economics  traditionally  has 
disregarded factors internal  to the firm. I 

I  The following statement, from Buuell and Gale (1987), is 
typical.  ‘Our  treatment  of  strategy  is  also  confined  to 
dimensions that can  be  measured in  reasonably clear terms. 
In  contrast,  some  other  elements  of  strategies cannot  be 
readily  measured,  or  perhaps  measured  at  all.  There  has 
been much discussion for example, of  the pervasive influence 
of  corporate  cultures  on  success  or  failure.  No  doubt 
companies  differ  in  terms  of  their  cultures,  and  such 
differences unquestionably affect performance. But we  know 
of  no  way  to  measure  the  key  policies,  management 
processes, or personality factors that shape corporate cultures. 
Consequently, we  have made no effort to  explore this area, 
or  others that  would be  equally difficult to quantify or  even 
classify’ (p.  21).

Theory  or  empirical  evidence  of  linkages  to 
performance  abound  within  each  paradigm,  but 
surprisingly little has been  done to integrate the 
two  and  evaluate  the  relative  effect  of  each  on 
firm profitability.  Notable  exceptions  are recent 
works  by  Grinyer, McKiernan  and  Yasai-Arde- 
kani  (1988), Miller  (1986), White (1986), White 
and Hammermesh  (1981), and Lenz (1981), who 
discussed  andor evaluated  a  limited  number  of 
contingent  relationships  between  economic  and 
administrative  factors.  No work  has been  done, 
however,  to  assess  the  relative  importance  of 
these two sets of  explanatory factors. 

In  this  paper  we  begin  such  an  integrated 
examination  of  firm  profitability.  Utilizing  a 
unique  economic  and  behavioral  data  base, 
we  construct  and  test  three  models  of  firm 
performance,  first an example from an economic 
perspective, second an example from an organi- 
zational  perspective  and the third  an integration 
of  the other two. We are then able to decompose 
the  inter-firm  variance  in  profit  rates  into  its 
economic and organizational  components. 

Before  describing  the study we  would  like  to 
make two things clear.  First, we do not  propose 
to  synthesize  all  economic  and  organizational 
theories of  firm performance.  We have taken an

example from each class of models. We will argue 
that these examples are somewhat representative 
but they are, nonetheless, only examples. Readers 
who  find  one  or  both  of  our  examples  too 
simplistic  may  well  expect  a  more  complex 
example to capture more of  the variance in firm 
profits. This problem of selecting a representative 
model  seems particularly acute  for  the  organi- 
zational  perspective  because  of  its  numerous 
theories  and  levels  of  analysis  found  in  the 
literature, but that  model actually does better in 
our sample. Second, we  use  accounting rates of 
return  as our  measure of  performance. Within 
the  economic  tradition  these  have  been  the 
subject of  some debate (Bentson, 1985), but they 
are  still  commonly  used,  and  arguments  have 
been raised in  their defense (Long and Ravens- 
craft, 1984; Jacobson, 1987). The choice of  profit 
rates  is  less obvious vis-A-vis the  organizational 
literature.  While  profits  have  been  used  within 
that  tradition, so  has  a  large  number  of  other 
concepts of  performance (e.g.  satisfaction, sur- 
vival,  etc.).  If  the  organizational  model  had 
performed  less  well,  this  would  have  been  a 
serious problem. 

In  the  next  two  sections  we  present  our 
economic and  organizational models.  We  then 
describe  our  data  and  give  the  results,  ending 
with  a  discussion  of  the  implications  of  our 
findings. 
ECONOMIC MODEL OF FIRM 
PERFORMANCE 

Industrial  organization  economics  has  proven 
extremely useful to researchers of strategy content 
in  providing  a  basic  theoretical  perspective on 
the influence of  market structure on firm strategy 
and  performance.  While  there  is  a  range  of 
specific models, major determinants of  firm-level 
profitability  include:  (1)  characteristics of  the 
industry  in  which  the  firm  competes;  (2)  the 
firm’s position relative to its competitors; and (3) 
the  quality  or  quantity of  the  firm’s resources. 
Scherer  (1980:  Ch.  9)  surveyed  many  of  the 
specific models of  both  industry- and  firm-level 
performance, and Porter’s review (1981) describes 
the  influence  of  the  I/O  paradigm  on  business 
policy. 

Our economic model, while only an example, 
includes  several  of  the  explanatory  variables 

considered in the literature. We divide these into 
the  three  classes  mentioned  above.  Each  is 
discussed in  turn. 
Industry variables 
A long tradition, most often associated with Bain 
(1956)  is  concerned  with  identifying properties 
of  industries contributing to above-average prof- 
large  set  of  variables  (growth, 
itability.  A 
concentration, capital intensity, advertising inten- 
sity, etc.) have performed differently in different 
studies,  but  the  overall  importance  of  these 
factors is beyond dispute (Ravenscraft, 1983). In 
a  study such  as  ours, where  interest  is  focused 
on the importance of  industry per se,  rather than 
on  characteristics  of  more  or  less  attractive 
industries, the effect of  industry can be captured 
by  the  average industry profits.  A  recent  study 
by  Schmalensee  (1985)  shows  that  differences 
between  industries  as  measured  by  average 
industry  return  on  assets  account  for  almost 
all  the  explained  variance  in  business  unit 
performance. 

Variables  relating the firm to  its competitors 
The key member of  this class is  relative market 
share, a va!iable  which  has  been widely used in 
strategy and is emphasized by  BCG  (1972) and 
PIMS (PIMS,  1977; Buzzell  and  Gale,  1987). 
Originally  perceived  as  the  source  of  market 
power (Shepherd, 1972) market share and more 
specifically relative  market  share as  viewed  for 
this study serves as a proxy for some firm-specific 
relative  competitive  advantage  resulting  from 
learning  effects  and  other  firm  specific  assets 
(Karnani, 1984). 

Firm  variables 
We  complete our  model  with  firm  size.  This is 
most  often  interpreted  as  a  source  of  organi- 
zational costs (Shepherd, 1972). or X-inefficiencies 
(Leibenstein, 1976). From a strategy perspective 
we  note  that  size  also  may  be  an  indicator of 
diversification,  which  by  and  large  has  been 
found to affect performance negatively (Rumelt, 
1982; Porter, 1987; Wernerfelt and Montgomery, 
1988). 

Overall,  the  typical  economic model  of  firm 
performance explains from  15 to  40  percent  of

the  variance  in  profit  rates  across  firms.  Apart 
from random  effects,  measurement  errors,  and 
so  forth,  one  can  suggest  at  least  three  expla- 
nations for the ‘remaining’ variance.  First, there 
may be important economic variables, the extent 
of  which  cannot  be  measured  (e.g.  assets  that 
are specific to an industry  or a trading partner). 
Second,  the  ‘true’  model  may  be  such  that 
intervening  economic  variables  differ  from  case 
to case, making aggregate analysis difficult. Third, 
with  very  few  exceptions  (e.g.  Armour  and 
Teece,  1978),  organizational  factors  are  not 
considered  in  this literature. 

be  over-differentiated  in  one  area  and  under- 
differentiated  in  another,  but  on  the  whole  be 
just  about  right?  In  contrast, firm  performance 
is an aggregate phenomenon. 

One  research  stream which  has  attempted  to 
capture  the  multidimensional  aspect  of  these 
significant organizational phenomena-the 
effects 
of  structure,  motivation,  group  dynamics,  job 
enrichment,  decision-making,  leadership,  goal 
that  of  organi- 
setting  and  planning,  etc.-is 
zational  climate.  Long  a  prominent  concept 
within the organizational sciences, ‘organizational 
climate’  was originally  defined  as follows: 

ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL OF FIRM 
PERFORMANCE 

Perhaps even more than their economist counter- 
parts, organizational  researchers have developed 
a wide variety  of  models of  performance.  While 
the organization  behavior  and  theory  literatures 
are rich in the breadth and depth of  their studies 
of organization  structures,  systems,  and  people, 
the variety  of  conjectures and empirically  tested 
models makes aggregation difficult. For example, 
just  determining  the  appropriate  construct  of 
performance  or  effectiveness  involves  measures 
ranging from employee satisfaction to shareholder 
wealth (Cameron, 1986; Goodman and Pennings, 
1977; Steers,  1975). In  broad  terms  this  stream 
of research  suggests that managers can influence 
the  behavior  of  their  employees  (and  thus  the 
performance  of  the organization)  by  taking  into 
account  factors such as the formal  and informal 
structure,  the  planning,  reward,  control  and 
information systems, their skills and personalities, 
and the relation of these to the environment. That 
is, managers influence organizational outcomes by 
establishing  ‘context’,  and  that  context  is  the 
result of  a complex set of  psychological, sociologi- 
cal, and  physical  interactions. 

The difficulty in working with such multifaceted 
models  (see,  for  example,  Lenz,  1981)  lies  in 
developing,  collecting  and  aggregating  appro- 
priate  measures  (Bonoma,  1985; Bower,  1982). 
Many constructs within the literature are difficult 
to measure and those which are relatively easier 
to  capture  are  often  at  the  micro  (individual) 
level.  For  example,  can  we  say  that  a  firm  on 
the  whole  is  bureaucratic  just  because  it  has 
several  levels  to  its  hierarchy?  Can  a  firm 

The concept of  climate provides  a useful  bridge 
between  theories  of  individual  motivation  and 
behavior,  on  one  hand,  and  organizational 
theories, on the other. Organizational climate, as 
defined here, refers  to the perceived, subjective 
effects  of 
informal 
‘style’  of  the  managers,  and  other  important 
environmental  factors  on  the  attitudes,  beliefs, 
values and motivations of  the people  who work 
in a particular  organization  (Litwin and Stringer, 
1968: 5). 

the  formal  system,  the

the perceived properties or characteristics  found 
that  result  from 
in 
actions  taken  consciously  or  unconsciously  by 
an  organization  and  that  presumably  affect 
subsequent behavior  (Steers and Lee, 1983: 82). 

Just  as  geographic  regions  have  different 
‘climates’ as a result of the immediate interaction 
of  temperature,  humidity,  wind,  sunlight  and 
rainhow to make them favorable or unfavorable 
climates  for  living,  so  can  a  firm  have  as  the 
interaction  of  its  facilities,  structures,  systems 
and  people  a  favorable  or  unfavorable  work 
climate. 

Developed  in  the  1960s,  and  still  a  major 
concept today, climate uniquely refers to a broad 
class  of  organizational  and  perceptual  variables 
that reflect individual-organizational interactions 
which  affect  individual  behavior  (Glick,  1985; 
Steers and  Lee,  1983; Field  and  Abelson,  1982; 
James and Jones,  1979; Schneider,  1975; Litwin 
and  Stringer,  1968).  It  is  important  because  it 
provides  a  conceptual  link  between  analysis  at 
the  organizational  level  and  at  the  employee 
level, precisely the requirements  of  this  study. 
Unlike  objective  measures  of  organization 
structures  such  as  ‘M-form’ or  systems  such  as 


402

‘capital budgeting policies’, climate  as measured 
by  employee  response  to questionnaires reflects 
the  individual’s  perceptions  of  that  employee 
the  effect  or  presence  or  nature  of 
about 
certain organizational phenomena. Climate is not 
production  processes,  arrange- 
structure-size, 
ments,  or  number  of 
levels.  Structure  may 
influence human behavior, but it is not necessary 
to  examine  human  behavior  to  describe  an 
organization’s  structure.  Additionally,  the  same 
structures in different organizations may produce 
very  different  climates  (Springer  and  Gable, 
1980)  as  structure  is  only  one  of  the  many 
factors  that  significantly  influence  the  worker’s 
perceptions  of  his or her  work  environment. 

Numerous  studies  have  demonstrated  how 
changes in organizational structures, systems and 
practices  have  altered  climate  measures  and 
hence  individual  performance  (Pritchard  and 
Karasick,  1973; Litwin  and  Stringer,  1968; For- 
shand  and  Gilmer,  1964).  Lawler  et  d. (1974) 
studied  117  research  laboratories  and  demon- 
strated that both organizational structure (span of 
control, size, levels) and organizational processes 
(performance reviews,  budgeting,  collaboration) 
were  more closely associated with climate meas- 
ures than with performance (both subjective and 
objective)  measures,  and  that  organizational 
climate was directly linked to performance. Other 
more clinical efforts have shown linkages between 
managerial practices and attributes or dimensions 
of  organization  climate  and  firm  performance 
(Simmons and Mares, 1983; Likert, 1961). Figure 
1  illustrates  the  assumed  causality  of  the  tra- 
ditional climate  model  of  firm  performance. 

To empirically validate that climate was indeed 
a  firm-level construct,  Drexler  (1977) examined 
1256 work  groups  representing  6996 individuals 
in  21  organizations  to  test  the  strength  of  the 
organizational  climate  construct  at  the  organi- 
zational  level  rather  than  at  a  departmental 
or  some  sub-organizational  level.  His  findings 
strongly  support  the  use  of  our  measures  of 
organizational climate for firm or organizational- 
level  analysis. 

climate across departments in the  same organi- 
zation, the departmental effects are much weaker 
than  the  organizational effects (Drexler, 1977: 
4142). 

Denison  (1982), using the same climate instru- 
ment  with  substantially  more firms, also demon- 
strated that  climate  measures  were  more  appro- 
priate  at  the  organizational  level  rather  than  at 
the  group  or  individual  levels.  Glick’s  (1985) 
review  of  the  psychological  and  organizational 
climate  literature  and  the  empirical  corrections 
he makes to Drexler’s work leads him to conclude, 
‘Thus, the  concrete  conclusion  is  that  Drexler’s 
aggregated  perceptual  measures  are 
indeed 
reliable  measures  of  organizational  climate.’ 
Given  constraints  on  data  access  it  was  not 
possible  to  duplicate  the  above  tests  for  this 
study; nor was it deemed necessary,  given  these 
prior  tests  of  the same instrument. 

Of  course, there are many competing theories 
and  concepts  of  firm-level  performance  and  no 
single  construct  has  emerged  in  the  literature. 
We will  interpret a  positive  association between 
overall  firm  climate  and  profitability  as support 
for one theory of  organizational  determinants of 
performance. It is possible to interpret the climate 
scores  in  light  of  competing  theories.  That  is, 
high  climate  scores  may  indicate  that  the  key 
contingencies  are  satisfied,  or  that  corporate 
culture  is  appropriate to  the  environment, etc. 
(Denison,  1984).  If  one  subscribes  to  such  an 
alternative  theory,  the  climate  measures  are 
infected with  even more noise and the R2 values 
from  our  models  are  biased  towards  zero. ‘ We 
use  the  climate  data  because  they  have  some 
significant  history 
literature,  capture 
many elements of organizational phenomena, are 
appropriate  for  analysis  at  the  firm  level,  are 
largely  influenced  by  managerial  actions and are 
available for a reasonable number of  representa- 
tive  firms.

DATA  AND MEASURES 

The results reported in this study should encour- 
age  those  researchers  who  consider  organi- 
zational climate to be an organizational attribute. 
A  large  share  of  the  variance  in  measures of 
climate  that  describe  organization-wide  con- 
ditions and  procedures is  organization specific.

The  sample  includes  60 Fortune  loo0  firms 
representing  both  dominant  and lesser  members 
of their respective industries. These firms together 
comprise over 300 lines of  business as determined 
at  the  four-digit  SIC level.  While  the  sample  is 
not  large,  it  is  clearly  representative  of  major

detailed discussion of the sample and its character- 
istics see Hansen  (1987). 

Performance measure 
The measure for firm-level performance (FIRMn) 
was  selected  as  the  5-year  average  return  on 

assets  as  reported  by  Compustat.  Because  the 
availability  of  organizational  survey  data,  dis- 
cussed later, dictated the sample, not all the data 
are  from  a  single  year.  In  order  to  adjust  profit 
for annual  effects such as inflation,  the risk-free 
rate  as  determined  by 
the  T-bill  rate  was 
subtracted  from  the  ROA  for  each  firm  as 
prescribed by Shepherd (1970: 50-51).  This multi-

year average seemed appropriate given the long- 
term  strategic  and  structural  variables  in  this 
study,  and  is  consistent  with  previous  strategy 
studies  (Grinyer  et  al.,  1988;  Rumelt,  1982; 
Christensen  and Montgomery,  1981). 

Economic variables 
The economic variables are at the four-digit  SIC 
level  and  come  from  Trinet/EIS, 
the  FTC 
Line  of  Business  Data,  and  the  Census  of 
Manufacturers.  Firm  financial  information  was 
obtained  through  Compustat  tapes. 

Industry profitability  (INDIT), is defined as the 
sales  weighted  average  return  on  assets  across 
the firm’s lines of business.  It would be desirable 
to  take  our  sample  firms’  own  effect  out  of 
average  industry  profits,  but  we  were  not  able 
to  do  this  consistently.  As  mentioned  above, 
INDr was  selected  to summarize the  effects  of 
all  industry-level  variables  such  as growth  rate, 
concentration, barriers, etc. Given this, inclusion 
of  an  additional  industry-level  variable  would 
lead  to a  misspecification of  the model. 

To indicate  firm  competitive  position,  we  use 
the  relative  market  share  as  calculated  by  the 
sales weighted  ratio  of  the  firm’s  market  share 
divided  by  the  four-firm  concentration  ratio  in 
its  four-digit  SIC industry.  This  ratio  is  similar 
to  the  relative  market  share  as  developed  by 
PIMS  (1977).  We  of  course  expect  the  sign  of 
this  variable  (RELMS)  to be  positive. 

At  the  firm  level  we  use  firm  size  (SIZE), 
defined  as  the natural  logarithm  of  total  assets. 
This should measure inefficiencies resulting from 
size or diversification  and  we  expect  a  negative 
sign (as in Shepherd, 1972). A common problem 
with this measure is that the size variable enters 
in  the  denominator  of  FIRMIT. Accordingly, 
measurement  errors in this variable will generate 
a negative bias in  its coefficient and increase the 
amount  of  variance 
the 
regression. While the magnitudes of  these effects 
are  difficult  to  assess,  their  salience  is  limited 
given  that  our  results  attribute  relatively  low 
variance  to economic factors. 

it  accounts  for  in 

Organizational variables 
As  mentioned  above,  it  is  very  difficult  to  get 
good data on organizational factors. Our measure 
of  climate is derived from the Survey of  Organi- 

zations  (SOO)  instrument  described  in  Taylor 
and Bowers (1972). Tested and developed by the 
Institute  for  Social  Research  at  the  University 
of  Michigan,  this  questionnaire  captures  many 
dimensions  of  organizational  factors  including 
characteristics  of  communication  flow,  emphasis 
on human  resources,  decision-making  practices, 
organization  of  work,  job  design,  and  goal 
emphasis.  It  has  already  been  noted  that  this 
specific  operationalization  of  organizational  cli- 
mate is accepted as appropriate for organizational- 
level  studies  (Glick,  1985;  Mossholder  and 
Bedeian, 1983; Denison,  1982; Drexler, 1977). 
Briefly,  the  SO0  operationalizes climate  in  a 
somewhat prescriptive manner. That is, it assumes 
that  the  presence  of  work  groups  with  clear, 
consistent and high individual, group, and organi- 
zational  standards  and  goals,  linked  through 
effective  communications  utilizing  participatory 
decision-making techniques,  is evidence  of  good 
management.  Employees  who  feel  properly 
rewarded  with  pay  and  recognition,  and  who 
have leaderdmanagers who train, help, listen and 
are experts in  their tasks,  are more  productive. 
Finally,  workers  who  are  members  of  work 
groups  that  have  standards  and  are  mutually 
supportive 
to  better  performance.  For 
this  study  we  use  the  results  of  over  50,000 
questionnaires administered to 60 publicly traded, 
non-regulated  Fortune  lo00 firms.  The majority 
of  the  firms  (47)  came from  the  SO0 data and 
the  rest  from  a  similar  instrument  used  by  the 
Forum Corporation (1974). (A Chow test allowed 
us to pool the two after testing for homogeneity 
in  construct  and content)2 

Our  data  consist  of  averages  per  firm.  In  a 
few  cases  only  one  of  many  divisions  was 
surveyed, but in most cases unweighted averages 
among multiple  divisions are in~olved.~ Because 
of the large sample size our data are better than 
those  obtained  from  ‘key  informant’  methods, 
but  it  is  beyond  dispute  that  the  data  contain 
large amounts of  noise.

All the major dimensions of  the SO0 question- 
naire are intended to measure different constructs 
(Taylor  and  Bowers,  1972),  but  we  found  the 
climate variables  to have a noticeable amount of 
collinearity. Thus, only two of  the variables were

selcted for our models.  In particular,  we  use  (a) 
Emphasis on  Human  Resources  (HRM.EMPH) 
which  measures  the  employee’s  perception  of 
how  concerned  the  organization 
is  with  his 
welfare, work conditions, etc., and (b) Emphasis 
on Goal Accomplishment (GOAL.EMPH) which 
measures  the  employee’s  perception  of  relative 
emphasis on achieving aggressive goals or objec- 
t i v e ~ . ~  We chose these variables for four reasons. 
One,  they  are  well  grounded  in  major  streams 
of  research.  HRM.EMPH comes directly out of 
the human  relations  school  of  thought  (Barney, 
1986; McGregor,  1960; Roethlisberger and Dick- 
son,  1947). The other  variable,  GOAL.EMPH, 
can  be  associated  with  Barnard’s  (1968) organi- 
zation  purpose  and  is  more  representative  of 
the  scientific  management  school  of  research, 
specifically the  work  on  goal  theory  by  Locke 
(1978).  The strength  of  goal  theory  research  in 
both  laboratory  and  field  settings,  and  the  size 
of  its  impact,  is  significant  and  well  established 
in  the  literature.  Second,  the  two  variables 
represent  the  logical  tension  between  attention 
to an employee’s needs and task accomplishment. 
This,  too,  has  been  an  item  of  research  within 
the literature  (Blake and Mouton, 1964). Third, 
these  variables  were  the  least  correlated  among 
the  climate  dimensions.  And  fourth,  these  two 
(in addition to a few others) were available from 
instrument, 
both 
enabling maximum sample size. While our selec- 
tion  may  appear  to  be  somewhat  arbitrary,  it 
should be noted that  our results are very similar 
for other pairs of  climate  variables.

Data  description 
Tables  1 and  2  provide  the  descriptive  statistics 
for  the  variables  and  the  correlation  matrix. 
It  can  be  seen  from  the  correlation  matrix 
that  the  climate  measures-HRM.EMPH  and 
GOAL.EMPH-xhibit 
the  strongest  corre- 
lations  with  firm-level  profit.  The  sample  was 
tested  for multicollinearity and for heteroscedas- 
ticity  using  the  Goldfield-Quandt 
tests  (Bass, 
Cattin  and  Wittink,  1978).  This  revealed  no 
problems. 

For  each  firm,  many  employees answered  many  questions 
pertaining to each of  these two variables. The  values we  use 
are the  average scores across individuals and questions.  See, 
e.g., Taylor and Bowers (1972) for a copy of the questionnaire 
and  further details.

RESULTS 

Table 3 shows the results of  three models of  firm 
performance-the 
economic,  the organizational, 
and  the  integrated.  For  each  variable  the  b 
coefficient,  its  significance  level  based  upon  its 
t-statistic,  and  the  standardized  b  weights  are 
reported.  In  addition,  the  computed  F-ratio  for 
the  regression,  its  probability  (p-level) and  the 
unadjusted  (R2) and adjusted (R2) R2’ values are 
provided. 

Economic  model 
The  least-squares  estimation  for  the  economic 
model  was  significant  at the 0.009 level  and  the 
signs of  all the coefficients  were  in  the  expected 
direction.  Somewhat  surprising  was  both  the 
insignificance of the relative market share variable 
and the relatively low R2 of  0.141. A few recent 
studies  suggest  that  high  absolute  or  relative 
share  may not  be as closely associated  with firm 
profits  as argued  in  the  BCG  (1972) framework 
(Jacobson and Aaker, 1985; Rumelt and Wensley, 
1981) and that even  low market  share firms may 
indeed be just as profitable given certain favorable 
industry- and firm-specific conditions (Woo, 1981 ; 
Hammermesh,  Anderson  and  Harris,  1978). 
Nevertheless,  the economic model  as a  whole  is 
successful in  explaining  firm profit  performance. 

Organizational model 
The organizational model is also highly significant 
with  its  coefficients  in  the  expected  positive 
direction.  While  the  HRM.EMPH  variable  is 
highly  significant  (p-level  less  than  0.000)  the

GOAL.EMPH variable keeps the latter insignifi- 
cant. When run as two models with the variables 
kept  separate,  the  GOAL.EMPH  variable  is 
positive  and  significant  at  the  0.005  level.  The 
organizational model alone explains substantially 
more  of  the  profit  variance  than  the  economic 
model  alone.  Given  the extremely large number 
of  surveys used  to formulate  the measures,  and 
the long history of importance in the management 
literature  of  motivating  employees  and  goal 
theory  (Locke,  1978), the  results  are not  overly 
surprising  to  organization  theorists  (although 
those  from  an  economic  perspective  may  find 
them  noteworthy). 

Integrated model 
The  third,  or  integrated,  model  of  firm  perfor- 
mance  is also highly significant. The signs of  the 
coefficients are in  the  expected  direction, and it 
explains  even  more  of  the  firm’s  performance 
with  an  E2 of  0.457.  The  RELMS  variable  is 
now  significant  and  with  the  expected  sign 
indicating  the  importance  of  the  firm’s  market 
share relative to its major competitors. However, 
the GOAL.EMPH variable remains insignificant. 
It  is  worth  noting  that  the E2 of  this  model  is 
only  slightly  smaller  than  the  sum  of  the  E2 
values of  the two partial  models.  So our specific 
economic  and  organizational  factors  appear  to 
be  roughly  independent  contributors  to  perfor- 
m a n ~ e . ~  

It  must  be  noted, from  our  previously  presented climate 
model, that climate is the effect of  numerous ‘environmental’ 
factors including organization structures, systems, and people. 
We  are  not  arguing  that  these  underlying  factors  are  not 
contingent  upon  competitive  or  other  external  conditions, 
but  that  the  resulting climate  is  largely  independent. Thus, 
firms in ‘bad’ industries, ‘dog’ businesses or weak competitive 
positions should be able to achieve good climates and capture 
the  profit  benefits of  those  efforts. 

Variance decomposition 
To  decompose  the  interfirm  variance  in  profit 
rates we will start with the combined model and 
use F-tests to see if there are significant differences 
in  the amount of  explained variance  as we  drop 
either  group  of  variables  from  the  complete 
model.  Figure  2  starts  at  the  bottom  with  the 
combined model and then reports the significance 
of  the F-test  between  it and the two submodels. 
Finally,  the  two  submodels  are  tested  from  the 
null model. This method is presented  by Kmenta 
(1971) and  utilized  by  Schmalensee (1985). 

Both  economic  and  organizational factors are 
highly  significant,  together  or  alone.  However, 
at either level the organizational  factors explain 
more  variance  than  the  economic  factors.  To 
formally analyze this, Table 4 gives the incremen- 
tal  contributions  to  R2  for  the  economic  and 
organizational models (Theil, 1971). Three things 
are  important.  First,  both  the  models  explain 
substantial amounts of  firm profitability.  Second, 
the organizational factors account for about twice 
as much  variance  as the  economic  factors.  And 
third, the models are approximately  orthogonal, 
suggesting that these are indeed two independent 
effects. 

CONCLUSIONS  AND  IMPLICATIONS

We  integrated 
firm 
performance, one from  the  economic  paradigm 
and  one from  the organizational  paradigm.  The 
results confirm the importance and independence 
of both sets of factors in explaining performance. 
However,  the  results  also  indicate  that  organi- 
zational  factors  explain  about  twice  as  much 
variance  in firm profit rates as economic factors. 
Regarding  the  model  specification,  one  can 
question  the  direction  of  causality.  There  are,

however,  several  arguments  supporting  our 
interpretation. First, it may be argued that ‘good’ 
organizational  practices  help  a  firm  select  good 
economic environments, or obtain relative advan- 
tage through the creation of  intangible or invisible 

assets  (Itami  and  Roehl,  1987).  If  this  is  true, 
our estimate of  the importance of  organizational 
factors  is  biased  downward.  So our results  may 
be  even  stronger  than  it  first  appears.  Second, 
one might  suspect  that  high  performance  allows 
firms  to  maintain  good  climates.  However, 
rational  managers  would  not  invest  in  this were 
it  not  for a  positive effect  of  climate on profits. 
Third, the  empirical  results  of  Denison  (1982), 
who found that profitability lagged organizational 
climate  by  2-3  years,  contradicts  this.  Fourth, 
most  theory  in  the  area postulate  this  direction 
of  causality.  Finally,  early  and  recent  clinical 
studies point in the same direction.  Nevertheless, 
our  result  is  subject  to  the  usual  discussion  of 
causality versus association. The answer depends 
substantially  on the model  in which one chooses 
to  interpret the results. 


Additionally  some  issues  may  be  of  concern 
because  of  our data set. In  particular,  it  is true 
that  our  economic  model  explains  less  profit 
variance than some earlier studies (our percentage 
variance  explained  is  in  fact  almost  identical  to 
Schmalensee,  1985).  The  fact  that  many  of 
our  firms  are  widely  diversified  may  yield  an 
understanding  of  this:  aggregation  over  many 
industries  will  tend  to  reduce  the  amount  of 
variance  explained  by  industry  effects.6 In  con- 
trast,  older  samples may  contain  less diversified 
firms.  Nevertheless,  even  if  the  importance  of 
the economic factors is underestimated here, they 
are  still  of  much  smaller  importance  than  the 
organizational  factors.  In  fact,  because  our 
organizational  variables  also  contain  errors  of 
measurement,  our  estimate  of  their  importance 
is biased  downward  as well. 

Regarding  future  research,  we  feel  that  the 
results from the present study are very encourag- 
ing.  ff  one  can  get  firm-level  data  on  organi- 
zational  factors  it  should  be  possible  to  look  at 
numerous  other examples.  Further,  it  would  be 
interesting  to  move  beyond  variance  decompo- 
sition  and  consider  various  interactions  (contin- 
gencies)  between  economic  and  organizational 
variables.  Both  economists  and  organization 
theorists  could  benefit  from  work  in  this  area. 
Also,  note  that  the  approximate  orthogonal 
independence between  the two examples implies 
that  the  perspectives  are  supplementary  rather 
than  complementary.  Thus,  our  knowledge  of 
firm  performance  is  greatly  enhanced  by  our 
study of  multiple  paradigms.  While this indepen- 
dence may suggest that neither the economic nor 
the organizational paradigm needs to significantly 
account for the other in their  respective studies, 
we  hesitate  to overstate  this empirically  derived 
‘independence’. So while our results may actually 
give a rationale for the current lack of  interaction 
between  researchers  from  the  two  paradigms, 
our conclusion  is that each perspective has much 
to  gain  by  incorporating  broader  models  of 
organizational  performance. 

Our findings have important  managerial impli- 
cations. First, they confirm that industry selection 
and positioning within  an industry are important 
contributors to performance. Second, we see that 
good  administrative  practices  are  even  more 
important  and  third,  that  the  economic  and

organizational  effects  are  roughly  independent. 
That  is,  there  is  little  overlap  between  the 
two  effects:  top  management  teams  that  can 
demonstrate excellence in both arenas-ompeti- 
tive positioning in the market place and building 
organizational  context-will 
do significantly bet- 
ter than those that strive for more unidimensional 
if  our 
concepts  of  excellence.  Additionally, 
findings  of 
importance  can  be 
generalized,  it  would  suggest  that  the  critical 
issue  in  firm  success  and  development  is  not 
primarily  the  selection  of  growth  industries  or 
product  niches,  but  it  is  the  building  of  an 
effective,  directed,  human  organization  in  the 
selected  industries.
