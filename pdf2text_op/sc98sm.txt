SUMMARY

The authors investigated  the direct and moderating effects  of locus of control and organizational commitment  on  the
relationship  of  sources of stress with psychological  distress, job  satisfaction  and  quitting intention  of  122 employees
(66 males, 54 females, two unclassified) working in Hong Kong firms. The instruments included parts of Occupational
Stress  Indicator-2  measuring  sources  of  stress  and  job  satisfaction.  Work  Locus  of  Control  and  the  nine-item
Organizational  Commitment  Questionnaire.  In  addition,  10 items  measuring  psychological  distress  and  two  items
measuring  quitting  intention  were constructed  by the first author.  A series of validation  procedures were  conducted,
and  the authors concluded that the instruments used were valid to be used on Chinese employees in Hong Kong. The
results of the study suggested that locus of control and organizational commitment  had strong direct effects  (externals
were  dissatisfied  with  the  job  itself  and  thought  of  quitting  the  job  quite  often;  employees  who  had  a  high
commitment  had  higher job  satisfaction)  and  moderating effects  (the stressor-strain  relationships were significant  in
externals,  and  commitment  buffered  most  of  the  stressor-strain  relationships).  ©  1998 John  Wiley  & Sons,  Ltd.

Stress-related cost for organizations. 'Presenteeism'
means people who suffer  stress from  their jobs so
that they can contribute little to their work. In such
cases,  additional  labour  or  materials  are  required
to compensate for their poor performance. Cooper**
suggested  this  phenomenon  is  the  great  hidden
cost  of  stress at work.  It  is therefore  necessary  to
identify  potential job stressors that lead to psycho-
logical distress, job  dissatisfaction,  absenteeism  or
turnover, so that adequate intervention effort  may
be provided  in the workplace.

During  the  1980s, personality  was found  to  be
related  to job stressors (eg workload, role conflict,
lack  of  autonomy)  and  job  strains  (eg  job  dis-
satisfaction,  anxiety,  health  complaints).  One  of
the personality variables that was found empirically
to play an important role in job stress process was
locus of control.^'* This personality variable origin-
ally  referred  to  the  extent  to  which  individuals
believed  that  they  could  control  events  aifecting
them.'' Spector and O'Connell* conceptualized that
people who hold expectancies that they can control
reinforcements  are  considered  to  be  internals,
whereas people who hold expectancies that outside
forces  or  luck  controls  reinforcements  are  con-
sidered  to  be  externals.  Edwards'  found 
the
generalized  expectation  of control  to  be  the most
powerful  of  the  personality  variables.  In  a  meta-
anaiysis, Spector^ reports that there are correlations
between locus of control and both job stressors and
job  strains.  Payne'" concluded  that  externals tend
to find their work environments more  threatening
and stressful.  In a recent study,"  external locus of
control was found  to be negatively correlated with
job  satisfaction  and  positively  correlated  with
mental  and  physical  ill-health.  The  role  of  locus
of  control  as  moderator  of  the  stress-strain
relationship  has  been  demonstrated.'^~''*  By  and
large,  the  correlation  between  stress  and  strain  is
significantly  higher for externals than for internals.
The  importance  of  organizational  commitment
has  been  widely  discussed  in  recent  years.'^"'^
Organizational commitment may be defined as 'the
relative  strength  of  an  individual's  identification
with and involvement in an organization'.'^ Meyer
and  AUen'^ extended  Mowday's et al.^^ work  and
concluded  that  there  are  three  components  of
organizational  commitment — affective,  continu-
ance  and  normative.  Somers"  also  demonstrated
these three facets  of commitment.  Organiza-tional
commitment  has  a direct  effect  on job  stress  and
strain. It was found  to be correlated with job stress
in  a  negative  fashion:^**"^^  the  more  stress  an

^^ 

employee  experienced  in an  organization,  the less
committed  he/she  would  be to  it,  and  vice versa.
Concerning  strain  effects,  organizational  commit-
ment was found  to be negatively related to absent-
eeism^^ and
Recently,  Somers" has
found  that  only aifective  commitment  was related
to  turnover  and  absenteeism.  Leong  et al.^^  have
reported  that  organizational  commitment  was
positively  correlated 
to  job  satisfaction,  and
negatively correlated  with mental  and physical ill-
health as well as intent to quit.

^^^'

It  has  been  suggested 

that  organizational
commitment  has  a  moderating  effect.  Kobasa^^
argued that commitment protects individuals from
the negative effects of stress because it enables them
to  attach  direction  and  meaning  to  their  work.
Mowdiay et al.^^  also  claimed  that  organizational
commitment can provide people with stability and
a feeling of belonging. In an empirical test, Begley
and  Czajka^*  found  that  organizational  commit-
ment  buffered  the relationship  between  stress and
job dissatisfaction  (eg stress increased job dissatis-
faction  only when organizational commitment was
low).  Leong  et  al.^^  conducted  their  study  in  a
similar way to the work of Begley and Czajka,^^ but
they found  little evidence for the moderating  effect
of commitment in any of the outcome variables.

As  noted  by  Sommer  et  al.}"^  the  ana,lysis  of
organizational  commitment  has  been 
largely
restricted  to  US samples. Similar  arguments were
offered  by Bond,^" who pointed out that almost all
contemporary  psychology 
is  based  on  data
obtained  from  North  America  and  other  westem
countries.  Yet  the  population  of  China  is  more
than  1.2 billion, which is about  20 per cent of the
total  world  population.  It  would  be  valuable  to
obtain data from Chinese in order to contribute to
the generalizability of theories in psychology. It has
been  argued  that  organizational  commitment  is
specific to the Chinese workforce. In Confucianism,
there  is  a  saying,  'Be  patriotic  and  loyal  to  the
throne'.  This  means  that  government  officials
should  be  absolutely  loyal  to  the  kingdom  they
serve.  This  traditional  value  has  implications  for
the workforce.  Once the worker  is employed  by a
company,  he should  be devoted  to  the job, work
very  hard  and  take  full  responsibility  for  the job.
Empirically,  it was found  that  the  level of  organ-
izational commitment in Hong Kong workers was
much  higher  than  those  reported  in  the  US,
Canada,  Korea  and  Japan.'''-^^  Although  work
attitudes  in  Hong  Kong  are,  to  a  certain  extent,
influenced  by  Confucianism,  due  to  the  fact  that

OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN HONG  KONG  FIRMS

Hong  Kong  has  long  been  exposed  to  western
values,  it  is  expected  that  the  influence  of  Con-
fucianism  on workers' behaviour, especially among
the young  workers, will, be  diminishing.

In  the  present  study,  the  authors  attempt  to
conduct a study similar to Leong et al.''  in order  to
investigate  the  direct  and  moderating  effects  of
locus  of  control  and  organizational  commitment
on  the  stressor-strain  relationships  in  Chinese
employees  in  Hong  Kong  firms.  It  is  hypothesized
that  the  relationship  between  stress  and  strain  is
stronger  in  externals  and  among  those  who  have
low  organizational  commitment.  The  theoretical
framework  of  the  study  is  modelled  from 
the
Occupational  Stress  Indicator 
(OSI)  structure
devised  by  Cooper  et al.^^ (see Fig.  1). The  instru-
ment  mainly  adopts  the  shortened  version  of  the
Occupational  Stress Indicator-2 (OSI-2) measuring
sources of stress and job  satisfaction,  the nine-item
Organizational Commitment Questionnaire  (OCQ)
constructed  by  Mowday  et  al.^^  and  the  Work
Locus  of  Control  Scale  (WLOC)  constructed  by
Spector.* They were translated  into  Chinese  by  the
first  author  and  translated  back  into  English  by  a
lecturer  specializing  in  translation  in  Hong  Kong.
The  OSI  and  shortened  version  of  the  OSI-2  have
been  used  on  Chinese  subjects  in  previous  studies
and  have  demonstrated  high  reliability  and  pre-
dictive  validity,^"'"  yet  the  OCQ  and  WLOC  were
constructed  in  western  societies  and  have  seldom
been  used  in  Hong  Kong.  Therefore,  the  authors

wanted not just to replicate the instrument, but also
to  validate  these scales  in  Hong  Kong  as well.

METHOD

Sample

The  target  population  for  the study was a  broad
cross-section  of  employees  in  Hong  Kong  indus-
trial  firms  owned  by  different  nationals.  One
hundred  and  seventy  self-administered  question-
naires  were  distributed  to  employees  of  several
trading  firms  in  one industrial  area  in Hong  Kong
in November  1996. One of the managers of each of
the  selected  firms  was  asked  to  distribute  the
questionnaires  through  the  internal  mail.  Follow-
up  telephone  calls  were  conducted  to  ensure  a
higher  retum  rate.  One  hundred  and  twenty-four
completed  questionnaires  were  collected  in  the
following  2-3  weeks. Out  of these, two  incomplete
ones  were  discarded.  Thus,  the  response  rate  was
72.5  percent.

Measures

dizziness)  and  depression  (three  items:  eg  work
retardation,  failure).  Each  item  is  rated  on  a  six-
point  scale ranging from  very often  (6) to never (1)
(high  score =  high distress).

Job satisfaction.  This was measured using the Job
Satisfaction  Scale  of  the  OSI-2.  This  is  a  12-item
scale consisting  of two subscales: job  itself (JI)  and
the  organization  (JO). Only  the  first  11 items  were
used because item  12 was very similar to item 9 after
translation  into  Chinese,  so  item  12  was  deleted.
Each item is rated on a six-point scale ranging  from
very  satisfied  (6)  to  very  dissatisfied  (1)  (high
score =  high  satisfaction).

To  validate  the  JI  and  JO  subscales,  two  items
were constructed:  'All  in  all, how  satisfied  are  you
with  your job?'  (JI'),  and  'All  in  all,  how  satisfied
are you  with  the  organization?'  (JO').

Quitting intention. Two items were used. One was
a  true/false  question  asking the respondents if they
planned  to  quit  the  job  in  the  immediate  future.
The  other  one  asked  the  respondents  to  indicate
how  often  they  really  thought  of  quitting  the  job
on  a six-point  scale ranging  from  very often  (6)  to
never (1).

Independent  variables

Sources  of  stress.  There  are  40  items  in  the
Sources  of  Stress  Scale of the OSI-2. To  avoid  too
lengthy a questionnaire, the number of items of this
scale  were  reduced.  Twenty  items  were  extracted,
which measured six subscales: (1) factor  intrinsic to
job,  (2)  managerial  role,  (3)  relationship  with
others,  (4)  career  and  development,  (5)  organiza-
tional  structure  and  climate,  (6) home/work  inter-
face.  Respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  whether
an  item  was  a  source  of  pressure  on  a  six-point
scale  ranging  from  very  definitely  a  source  (6)  to
very definitely is not a source (1) (high score =  more
source  of  stress).

Locus  of  control.  The  16-item  Work  Locus  of
Control  (WLOC)  devised  by  Spector* was used  to
measure  locus  of  control  personality.  Each  item  is
rated  on  a  six-point  scale  ranging  from  strongly
agree  (6)  to  strongly  disagree  (1)  (high  score  =
external  locus  of  control).

To  validate  the  WLOC,  six  items  were  con-
structed  in  Chinese  by  the  first  author  (named
as  Chinese 
the
internalistic/extemalistic  view  on  the  mastery  of

locus  of  control)  measuring 

life.  These  items  are  in  fact  common  Chinese
idioms refiecting  one's perception  of fate or  human
effort  (see Appendix).  Each  item  is rated  the  same
way  as  the  WLOC  (high  score =  external  locus  of
control).

the  negative 

Organizational 

commitment.  The 

nine-item
Organizational  Commitment  Questionnaire  (OCQ)
(excluding 
items)  developed  by
Mowday et al.^  was used. This consists of a seven-
point  scale  ranging  from  strongly  agree  (7)  to
strongly  disagree  (1)  (high  score =  high  commit-
ment). The rationale of using the nine-item  OCQ is
based  on  two  reasons:  (a)  to  reduce  the  length  of
the  questionnaire,  (b)  the  negatively  worded  items
lack  stability.^*

In  addition,  five  items  were  constructed 

to
measure  perceived  work  pressure  indicating  the
level  of  pressure  and 
tenseness  at  work,  and
pressure  from  overload  and  responsibility.  Each
item  is  rated  on  a  seven-point  scale  ranging  from
strongly  agree  (7)  to  strongly  disagree  (1)  (high
score =  high

RESULTS

The  sample comprised  66 males  (54.1 percent)  and
54  females  (44.3  percent)  (two  were  unclassified).
The  majority  of  the  respondents  were  aged  from
21  to  25  (34.4  percent)  and  from  26  to  30  (36.1
percent). Concerning educational level, 44.3 percent
achieved  0-levels,  and  39.3  percent  had  received
tertiary  education.  The  mean  of  total  working
experience was 7.41 years, and  the mean  of  current
job  experience  was  2.81 years.  Since it was  quite  a
young  sample,  69.7  percent  of  them  were  single.
Out  of  these  122  employees,  84.4  per  cent  were
tenured,  and  most  of  them  worked  in  firms  which
were  mainly  Hong  Kong  (59.8  percent),  Chinese
(10.7 per cent), American (8.2 per cent) or  Japanese
owned  (9.8 percent).

Concerning  work  pressure,  7.4  per  cent  chose
'strongly  agree'  and  15.6  percent  chose 
'much
agree'  to  the  statement  'I  usually  feel  that  I  am
under  a  lot  of  pressure  when  I  am  at  work';
7.4 percent  chose  'strongly  agree'  and  14.8  percent
chose  'much  agree'  to  the  statement  'The  level  of
stress at work  is very high'. In response to the true/
false question of planning to quit the job, 32 percent

chose  'Yes'  and  60.7  percent  chose  'No'  (7.4  per
cent  chose  'undecided').

The  means,  standard  deviations  and  reliability
(a) of  all  the variables  are depicted  in Table  1. All
of  the  variables  demonstrated  acceptably  high
reliability.

Concerning  the  vahdation  data,  the  correlation
coefficients  between JI and JF and that between JO
and  JO'  were  0.775  and  0.584  respectively;  both
were significant  at/7  <  0.001  level. The  correlation
coefficient  between  locus  of  control  and  Chinese
locus  of  control  was  0.545,  p  < 0.001  level.  In
analysing  the  two  items  measuring  quitting  inten-
tion,  a r-test  demonstrated  that  those who  planned
to  quit  their  jobs  in  the  immediate  future  really
thought  of  quitting  the job  more  often  (r-value  =
5.62,  p  < 0.001).  These  provide  some  validation
evidence  of  the  subscales  measuring  job  satisfac-
tion,  locus  of control  and  quitting  intention.

In  studying  the  relationship  among  the  strain
variables,  psychological  distress  was  positively
correlated  with 
(/• =  0.278,
p < 0.001)  and  with  perceived  work  pressure
(r =  0.368, p  < 0.001).  In  addition,  those who  had
more  sources  of  stress  perceived  higher  work

sources  of  stress 

pressure  (r =  0.277,  p  < O.Ol).  Job  satisfaction
was  negatively  correlated  with  quitting  intention
(r = - 0 . 4 0 3,  p<0.00\).  A  series  of  f-tests  also
demonstrated  that  those  who  said  'Yes'  to  the
question  of  planning  to  quit  their  jobs  had  lower
job  satisfaction  (/ =  4.52,  / ;<  0.001)  and  more
psychological  distress  (/ =  2.31,  /) <  0.05).  These
results  further  provide  evidence  that  the  respond-
ents  were  logical  and  consistent  in  completing  the
questionnaires.

Concerning  demographic  variables,  sources  of
stress  was  positively  correlated  with  total  working
experience  (r =  0.37,  p  < 0.05)  and  age  (r =  0.29,
p < 0.05);  rank  was  positively  correlated  with
itself  (JI)  (r =  0.30,
satisfaction  with 
p < 0.05), 
and 
commitment
(r =  0.31,  ;7<0.05).  There  was  no  difference  in
stress  or  strain  between  sex,  marital  status  or
educational  level.  In  relating  to  company  size,  it
was  found  to  be  related  to  the  respondents'  job
satisfaction  (r =  0.40, p  < 0.05),  and  in  particular
to  the job  itself  (JI)  (r =  0.43, p  <  0.05).

It can  be seen from  Table 2 that  locus of  control
was  not  correlated  with  job  satisfaction,  but  by
further  analysis,  locus  of  control  was  found  to  be
negatively  correlated  with 
(JI)
(r =  -0.29,  p  < 0.05)  (ie  the  more  internal  the
locus of control, the higher the satisfaction  with the
job  itself).  Locus  of  control  was  positively  corre-
lated  with  quitting  intention  (r =  0.34,  p  <  0.001)
(ie the more external  the locus of control,  the more
frequently  the worker  thought  of quitting  the job).
This  result  was  further  verified  by  a  f-test  which
showed that those who said 'Yes' to the question  of
planning  to  quit  the job  were more  Ukely  externals
(f =  2.85,/;<  0.01).

The  other  moderator  variable,  organizational
commitment,  was  positively  correlated  with  per-
ceived  work  pressure  (r =  0.25, p  <  0.05)  and  with
job  satisfaction  (r =  0.56,  p<0.00\). 
The  latter
result was further  verified  by a r-test  which  showed
that  those  who  said 
'Yes'  to  the  question  of
planning  to  quit  the job  were  of  a  lower  commit-
ment  (?=  3.59, p  <  0.001).

To  test the moderating effects  of locus of control
and  organizational  commitment  in  the  stressor-
strain  relationships,  the  procedure  suggested  by
Cohen  and  Cohen^^  was  used  to  demonstrate  the
statistical  significance  and  form  of  the  main  and
interaction  terms. Concerning  locus of control,  the
following  were entered  in a hierarchical  regression:
(1) sources of stress (S), (2) locus of control (L), (3)
stress X locus  of  control  (S x  L)  (see  Table  3).

significantly  to  all

These  procedures  were  repeated  with  organ-
izational commitment  (OC) as the moderator  (see
Table  4). The  results  obtained  in Tables  3 and  4
show  that  sources  of stress  was a  significant
predictor  of psychological  distress  and  job satis-
faction,  and locus  of control  ahd organizational
commitment  contributed 
regressions; also locus of control and  commitment
significantly  interacted  to detennine  the  strain
outcomes  (except  the effect  of  commitment  on
stress  and quitting  intention;  also,  the effect  of
locus of control on stress and job  satisfaction  was
only  marginal).  The authors  then  proceeded to
investigate the buffering  effects  of each  moderator
on  each  specific  stressor-strain 
relationship.
Tables 5 and 6 depict the results of the hierarchical
regressional analyses.

DISCUSSION

Validation evidence

The reliabilities of all the scales used in the study
were  reasonably  high.  The  construct  validity of
some  scales  was  demonstrated  (satisfaction  with
job  itself,  satisfaction  with  the organization.  Work
Locus of Control and the nine-item  Organizational
Commitment  Questionnaire). In the sample,  there
was  a statistically  significant  correlation  among
psychological  distress,  sources  of stress  and per-
ceived work pressure. Further, job satisfaction was
statistically  significantly  correlated  with  quitting
intention  in a negative  direction.  Therefore, the
results  obtained  from  this  study  show  that the
subjects  were  completing  the  questionnaires in
a 
logical  and  consistent  manner.  Therefore
the  instrument  for the study  is a valid  one for
Chinese subjects in Hong Kong. The results of this
study  also  provide  cross-cultural  evidence of
certain  constructs  developed  in western  countries.

Stress-strain  relationship

Stress  (in specific, 

factor 

intrinsic  to  job,

managerial  role  and  organizational  structure  and
climate)  was statistically  significantly  correlated
with  psychological  distress.  These  results  corrobo-
rated  previous  studies.^-^*'^'  However,  sources of
stress  were  not  related  to  job  satisfaction or
quitting  intention.  Only  'organizational  structure
and  climate'  was  negatively  correlated  with job
satisfaction  (r = -0.30,  / ?< 0.001).  Even  though
these  results  are  different 

from  some  of  the

literature  on  job  stress,  they  are  very  similar  to
those  obtained  by  Leong  et  a/.,"  who  also  found
that  stress  was unrelated  to job  satisfaction  or  the
intent to quit,  but job satisfaction  was  significantly
and  negatively  related  to  organization  climate.
Perhaps as the samples used in this and  their  study
are  Asian,  there  may  be  similar  self-reporting
patterns  of  stressors  and  strains.

Role  of  locus of control

The  external  locus  of  control  was  significantly
and positively  related  to  stress, in particular  to  the
stressor  of  'relationship  with  others'.  In  other
words, it is likely that externals perceived  'relation-
ship  with  others'  as  definitely  a  source  of  stress.
Locus  of  control  was  also  significantly  and
positively  related  to  quitting  intention,  but  was
not  related  to  other  strain  variables  (psychological
distress  and  job  satisfaction).  It  seems  that  exter-
nals  think  of  quitting  the  job  quite  frequently.
These  results  are  similar  to  those  obtained  by
Spector* and  Rahim."*

The  present  study  also provided  support  for  the
moderating effect of locus of control. It  significantly
affects  the stressor-strain  relationships. The  results
obtained  in  Table  5  show  that,  in  demonstrating
locus  of  control  as  the  moderator,  significant
interactions  were  found  in  all  stressor  x  locus  of
control  for  psychological  distress  (except  'relation-
ship  with  others')  and  those  of  all  stressor  x  locus
of  control  for  quitting  intention.  For  job  satisfac-
tion,  only  'relationship  with  others'  and  'organiz-
ational  structure  and  climate'  were  significant
{F=4.22,  p  at  0.0074  and  f  =4.65,  p  at  0.0043,
respectively).  As  hypothesized  earlier,  therefore,
the  correlations  between  stress  and  strain  were
significantly  higher  for  externals than  for  internals
(the  more  external  the  locus  of  control,  the  more
psychological  distress,  job  dissatisfaction  and
intention  to  quit).  In  other  words,  externals  are
more  likely  to  be  affected  by  stressors,  and  this
leads  to  strain  outcomes.  This  implies  that  an
internal  locus  of  control  personality  can  help
employees  to  cope  with  stress  and  strain  in  the
workplace.  On  the  other  hand,  externals  may  not

role  of
organizational  commitment  as  a moderator,  when
six  stressors  were  entered 
the  regression
separately,  commitment 
interacted  with  most
stressors  to  determine  psychological  distress  and
job  satisfaction  (Table  6). Organizational  commit-
ment  buffered  all  stressors 
for  psychological
'relationship  with  others'  and
distress  (except 
'career  and  development').  Significant  interactions
were  found  in  all  stressor  x  commitment  for  job
satisfaction.  For  quitting  intention,  commitment
did not buffer  any ofthe  stressors. We can conclude
that  organizational  commitment  had  strong  direct
and  indirect  effects  on  stress-strain  relationships.
Obviously  our  findings  are  different  from  Leong's
et  a/."  results,  for  they  found  commitment  had
little  moderating  effect.  Therefore,  the  moderating
effect  of organizational commitment  deserves more
attention  as  a  buffer  in  future  research,  especially
in  Asian  cultures.

Limitations

The limitations  of the present  study are  twofold.
Firstly, the data are cross-sectional  in nature, there-
fore  we cannot  conclude  the  direction  of  causality.
For  example,  the  debate  on  the  direction  of  the
relationship  between  commitment  and  job  satis-
faction  cannot  be  resolved."*^'^^  Second 
is  the

artefact  in  self-reported  affect  and  perceptions  ^t
work,  the  current  study  still  has  the  limitation  of
relying  on  a  single  source  of  data.  Accepting  this
caveat,  the high  reliability  of  the  measures  and  the
significant  interaction  effects  obtained  suggest  that
locus  of  control  and  organizational  commitment
are potential  independent  variables and  moderator
variables in job  stress  research.
