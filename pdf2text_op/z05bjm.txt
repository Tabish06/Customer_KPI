This study investigates the impact that downsizing has on corporate reputation.
Drawing on the relevant literatures, two hypotheses are developed and tested. The
ﬁndings of the study are as follows. First, downsizing has a negative impact on
corporate reputation. Second downsizing is more damaging to corporate reputation
than ‘downscoping’–the sale of a division.

Downsizing, despite its increasing acceptance by
corporations, has remained a controversial topic.
Empirical evidence fail to support the notion that
downsizing leads to superior ﬁnancial perfor-
mance in the long run (Baily, Bartelsman and
Haltiwanger, 1994; Cascio, Young, and Morris,
1997; De Meuse, Bergmann and Vaderheiden,
1997). Some academics insist that downsizing, if
done strategically, can beneﬁt the ﬁrm (Burton,
Keels and Shook, 1996), while others claim that
downsizing as a strategy for improvement is ‘by
and large, a failure’ (Cameron, 1996). Despite
this lack of consistent evidence, however, man-
agers have continued its practice (McKinley,
Mone and Barker, 1998).

Within this context, the downsizing literature
has investigated numerous issues, but has paid
little attention to the impact of downsizing on
corporate reputation. This paper, using data
from Fortune’s ‘America’s Most Admired Cor-
porations (AMAC) survey, addresses this issue
by investigating how downsizing impacts corpo-
rate reputation, which is important for two rea-
sons. First, a better understanding of the eﬀect of
downsizing on corporate reputation assists in the
management of one of the most strategically
important intangible ﬁrm resources, reputation
(Barney, 1991; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Fom-
brun, 1996; Roberts and Dowling, 1997). Second,

from a downsizing literature perspective, this
study assists in better understanding the con-
troversy surrounding downsizing.

Downsizing and Corporate Reputation

Although the term ‘downsizing’ has often been
used in the literature to encompass a number of
related activities (Cameron, 1996; Cascio, Young
and Morris, 1997), for the purposes of this study
it refers exclusively to employment downsizing.
There are two criteria used in the literature to
classify a personnel reduction as downsizing.
First, the reduction must be signiﬁcant; Cascio,
Young and Morris (1997) used a 5% reduction as
a cut-oﬀ point. Second, this reduction must be
intentional (Cameron, 1996), but given that signi-
ﬁcant workforce reductions are ‘less likely to be
due to attrition’ (Littler and Innes, 2004),
it
is suﬃcient to say that a ﬁrm engaging in a
signiﬁcant workforce reduction is downsizing.
But is an employee reduction resulting from the
sale of a division downsizing? Here, ‘downsizing’
is used exclusively to refer to signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in personnel as a result of layoﬀs (Burton,
Keels and Shook, 1996; Worrell, Davidson and
Sharma, 1991), whereas ‘downscoping’, which
has been used to refer to strategic divestiture

programmes (Hoskinson and Hitt, 1991; Hos-
kinson, Johnson and Moesel, 1994), refers to
signiﬁcant reductions in personnel due to the sale
of a division. In other words, while downsizing
involves employees losing their jobs, downscop-
ing involves employees keeping their jobs but
working for diﬀerent owners.

sustainable

Corporate reputation, ‘the overall estimation in
which a particular company is held by its various
constituents’ (Fombrun, 1996, p. 37), is one of the
most important intangible resources of a corpora-
tion. Research in strategic management suggests
that a favourable reputation is an important
source of
competitive advantage
(Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Fombrun and Shanley,
1990; Hall, 1992, 1993; Itami, 1987; McMillan and
Maheshkumar, 1997). Fombrun (1996) argued
that a solid reputation not only acts as a warranty
in ambiguous situations, but also enables man-
agers to charge higher prices for products and
services. Moreover, Roberts and Dowling (1997)
found that ﬁrms with better reputations ﬁnd it
easier to attain a competitive advantage.

In ‘linking’ the notion of downsizing with
corporate reputation, two kinds of studies are
identiﬁed within the downsizing literature. Indir-
ect studies investigate the impact of downsizing
on reputation through another aspect of the ﬁrm,
while direct studies investigate the direct impact
of downsizing on reputation.

it

(Roberts

and Dowling,

Within indirect studies, diﬀerent debates coex-
ist. One is whether downsizing impacts ﬁnancial
performance. If downsizing has a positive impact
on ﬁnancial performance, given the positive
relationship between ﬁnancial performance and
reputation
1997;
McMillan and Maheshkumar, 1997), then down-
sizing should have a positive impact on reputa-
tion as well. However,
is not clear that
downsizing has a positive or negative impact on
ﬁnancial performance, as research ﬁndings are
quite ambiguous. Numerous studies have failed
to prove the existence of such a positive impact
(Baily, Bartelsman and Haltiwanger, 1994; De
Meuse, Bergmann and Vanderheiden, 1997),
while Cascio, Young and Morris (1997, p. 1175)
found that downsizing ﬁrms did not, in the long
term, ‘show signiﬁcantly higher returns than the
average companies
in their own industries’.
Likewise, Lewin and Johnston (2000) reported
that two surveys sponsored by the American
Management Association (AMA) in 1994 and

1995 found little support that downsizing led to
productivity improvements and proﬁts. There-
fore, downsizing has an indeterminate impact on
ﬁnancial performance, and consequently on
corporate reputation.

Another indirect issue is ‘how’ investors per-
ceive downsizing announcements. Studies examin-
ing the stock market’s reactions to downsizing
announcements indicate that, in the short term,
investors react negatively to downsizing decisions
(Franz, Crawford and Dwyer, 1998; Lee, 1997).
Worrell, Davidson and Sharma (1991, p. 667)
tested the reaction of securities markets to 194 lay-
oﬀ announcements and found that ‘a signiﬁcantly
negative stock market reaction is associated with
layoﬀ announcements’. These ﬁndings indicate
that since investors perceive downsizing as a nega-
tive development, they would probably down-
grade their perception of a ﬁrm after a downsizing,
given the link between stock market reactions and
corporate reputation (Fombrun, 1996).

Moreover, the impact that downsizing has on
intangible ﬁrm resources has received signiﬁcant
attention. Numerous authors suggest that innova-
tion suﬀers during downsizing periods (Cascio,
1993; McKinley, 1992; McKinley, Mone and
Barker, 1998). Amabile and Conti (1999, p. 630),
after examining the work environment of a large
high-technology ﬁrm before, during and after a
major downsizing, found that ‘creativity and most
creativity supporting aspects of the perceived work
environment declined signiﬁcantly during down-
sizing’. Fisher and White (2000) argued that from
a social network perspective downsizing could
damage a ﬁrm’s learning capacity much more than
headcount ratios imply. For our purposes, the
above ﬁndings indicate that downsizing negatively
eﬀects
strategically important ﬁrm resources,
which in turn negatively inﬂuence ﬁnancial per-
formance and therefore corporate reputation.

The second kind of research, investigating the
direct impact of downsizing on reputation,
is
limited to two empirical studies. Using data from
the AMAC survey, Karake (1998)
found a
negative relationship between downsizing and
corporate reputation for social performance. This
ﬁnding was supported by Zyglidopoulos (2004)
who, using the same database, not only found
that lay-oﬀs have a negative impact on the ﬁrm’s
reputation for social performance, but that high
ﬁrm proﬁtability, prior to lay-oﬀs, intensiﬁed this
impact – in other words, that ‘greater responsi-

bilities are attributed to richer and stronger
companies’ (Heugens and Schenk, 2004, p. 6).

Drawing on the above literatures and the
resource-based view that perceives ﬁrms as bun-
dles of unique and idiosyncratic resources and
capabilities (Barney, 1991; Diericx and Cool, 1989;
Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984), downsizing can
be seen as having a negative impact on corporate
reputation because it involves ﬁrms damaging
their unique capabilities. Two arguments follow
from this. If the various ﬁrm constituents see the
connection between downsizing and loss of stra-
tegic capabilities,
then ﬁrm reputation would
suﬀer. Also, if downsizing leads to the destruction
of valuable capabilities, this could account for the
fact that no consistent evidence that downsizing
improves the ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm
over the long term has been found (Cascio, Young
and Morris, 1997; Lewin and Johnston, 2000)
because any short-term gains are negated by long-
term losses in capabilities. So, given the diminish-
ing of
the ﬁrm’s
proﬁtability, and the proven link between ﬁnancial
performance and corporate reputation (Deep-
house and Carter, 2005), downsizing should lead
to losses in reputation.

the long-term prospects of

H1: Downsizing will be related to losses in cor-
porate reputation.

Downsizing versus downscoping

There are indications in the literature that down-
sizing and downscoping have diﬀerent impacts on
reputation. Burton, Keels and Shook (1996)
found that downsizing combined with refocusing
and restructuring is beneﬁcial to both healthy
and declining ﬁrms. In addition, Markides (1992)
found that downscoping ﬁrms tend to be re-
focusing because of over-diversiﬁcation, which
led them to poor performance, and that refocus-
ing announcements were perceived positively by
the markets. In other words, downscoping, seen
as a corrective action to the ﬁrm’s over-diversi-
ﬁcation, is more likely to be seen in a positive
light than downsizing.

There are more reasons, however, why down-
sizing and downscoping could have diﬀerent
eﬀects on reputation. A ﬁrm engaged in down-
sizing violates a number of implicit psychological
and social contracts existing between employees
and management (Van Buren, 2000), which is not

the case during downscoping. Psychological con-
tracts refer to ‘individual beliefs, shaped by the
organization, regarding terms of an exchange
agreement between individuals and their organiza-
tion’ (Rousseau, 1995, p. 9: cited in Van Buren,
2000). ‘Social contracts’ refer to the normative
ground rules through which society tries to regu-
late the fairness of implicit contractual agreements
(Donaldson and Dunfee, 1994). Van Buren (2000)
argues that during downsizing a ﬁrm violates both
psychological and social contracts. In addition,
one could argue that during downscoping, no
implicit contracts are violated, but transferred
from one owner to another, and moreover, the
negative social
impact that downsizing has on
surrounding communities (Sloan and Underwood,
1996) does not take place. Therefore, downsizing
would have a negative impact on the ﬁrm’s
reputation, but not necessarily downscoping.

H2: Downsizing and downscoping will diﬀer in
their reputational impact.

Methodology

Two sources of data were used: the AMAC
survey and the Wall Street Journal Index (WSJI).
The AMAC survey has been conducted by
Fortune magazine yearly since 1983, in it, each
corporation is rated relative to its competitors on
eight attributes (quality of management, quality
of products or services, innovativeness, ability to
attract, develop and keep talented people, long-
term investment value, ﬁnancial soundness, use
of corporate assets, and community and environ-
mental responsibility). The respondents are se-
nior executives and ﬁnancial analysts from the
ten largest companies in each of the 46 industries
of the Fortune 1000 list. The AMAC survey has
been criticized for having a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
halo (Brown, 1997; Fryxel and Wang, 1994), but,
subsequent
if one
controls for ﬁnancial performance, it is a valid
indicator of corporate reputation (Carter and
Dukerich, 1998; Szwajkowski and Figlewicz,
1999). The second source of data, WSJI,
is
published yearly by the Wall Street Journal and
provides summaries of all the news coverage
related to a particular company for the year.

Companies that appeared in the AMAC database

for 1988 and 1991 were selected. The companies
whose reputation scores were not available for
these years or for the year prior (1987 and 1990,
used as controls) were excluded. After this, 527
company x year data-points remained. Financial
performance and employment count data were
also drawn from the AMAC database.

Decreases in employees greater than 5% of the
years before (1987, 1990) implied that the com-
panies were downsizing, following Cascio, Young
and Morris (1997) who, dealing with the same
population of companies, found that a lower
than 5% limit included companies whose em-
ployment declined through attrition, while a
higher cut-oﬀ point unduly excluded larger
corporations. This way, 145 instances of down-
sizing were identiﬁed. Further classiﬁcation into
pure downsizing companies and downscoping
companies was not possible based on the AMAC
data. For this reason, a graduate assistant under
the author’s supervision went through the WSJI
and identiﬁed the companies engaged in down-
sizing and downscoping. Companies identiﬁed
from the AMAC database as having a greater
than 5% decline in their workforce, but for whom
the WSJI did not report any lay-oﬀs or a division
sale, were excluded from further analysis.

Independent variables. Downsizing was opera-
tionalized in three ways. First, downsizing was
operationalized as any reduction in employee
count. The criterion of ‘signiﬁcant reduction’ was
ignored, and the ﬁrst attempt to ‘capture’ down-
sizing simply measured yearly percentage em-
ployment changes (DEMPL(t)). Second,
in a
more narrow sense, downsizing was operationa-
lized by an indicator variable as any reduction in
employee count greater than 5% (DOWN(t)).
Third, the distinction between downsizing and
downscoping was operationalized through the
use of indicator variables (see Model 3). Two
indicator variables were used to capture three
possible states. One variable was used for ﬁrms
engaged in downsizing, independent of whether
they were downscoping during the same year
(DN(t)), and another for instances where ﬁrms
were engaged only in downscoping (DOWN-
SCOP(t)). The third state was when a company
engaged in neither of the above.

Dependent variables. The dependent variable
was the overall reputational scores for the years

1988 and 1991 from the AMAC database. These
yearly reputation scores were calculated through
the consolidation of two populations surveyed by
Fortune magazine yearly (ﬁnancial analysts and
industry executives) and eight dimensions of
corporate reputation. Because Fortune measures
reputation along eight dimensions, both Cron-
bach’s alpha and factor analyses were used to
assure that there was an underlying and stable
construct of reputation (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990). For the 1988 data, Cronbach’s alpha was
0.9727, and for the 1991 data a 5 0.9745. In
addition, factor analysis showed that the eight
attributes extracted a single factor with an
eigenvalue of 6.831 and 6.972, which accounted
for 85% and 87% of the variance, respectively.
These results are supported by the ﬁndings of
Fombrun and Shanley (1990), who found similar
values for 1985 data. As for the measurement of
reputation through questioning analysts and exe-
cutives, Cronbach’s alphas of 0.925, and 0.9417
were calculated for 1988 and 1991, respectively.
Therefore, the overall reputation of the ﬁrms can
be treated as a single stable construct.

Control variables. Two control variables were
used in this analysis: corporate ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (ROA(t)) and prior corporate reputation
(CR(t-1)). Financial performance had to be
controlled for because of its signiﬁcant correla-
tion with corporate reputation (Brown and Perry,
1995; McGuire, Schneeweis, and Banch, 1990).
The ROA ratio drawn from the AMAC database
was used (ROA(t)) as an indicator for ﬁnancial
performance because of its ‘stability and compar-
ability across ﬁrms’ (Kim, Hwang, and Burgers,
1989). Prior
reputation
(CR(t-1)) were controlled for, for two reasons.
First, because we are interested in the impact of
events that took place during the years 1988 and
1991, their impact on the reputation scores of the
ﬁrms can only be evaluated if we control for the
reputation scores of the years prior. Second, as
Fiol and Kovoor-Misra (1997) argued, prior
levels of corporate reputation could impact the
way stakeholders react to events.

time periods were used rather than data from
consecutive time periods, and by using the
Durbin-Watson test, no such problems were
found (Durbin Watson statistics remained very
close to 2 for all models). Two stepwise and one
forced-entry multivariate regression models were
constructed. These models included control vari-
ables for prior corporate reputation and ﬁnancial
performance. In addition, each model tested for a
diﬀerent operationalization of downsizing, from

to major negative changes in employment count

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and the
correlations among the continuous variables used
in this analysis. Because of
the signiﬁcant
correlations between some

control variables, tests for multicolinearity were
performed; the Variance Inﬂation Factors (VIF)
were within acceptable limits (max 1.339).

that downsizing is
positively correlated with losses in corporate
reputation. As can be seen from all three models

in Table 2, this hypothesis is supported, no
matter how broadly or narrowly downsizing is
operationalized. In all three cases, the relevant
variables reached adequate levels of signiﬁcance
and were included in the stepwise regression
models (see Table 2). In Model 1, changes in
employment (DEMPL(t)) were positively corre-
lated with changes in corporate reputation scores
( 5 0.053, po0.01),
indicating that drops in

indicating that
downsizing events were related to negative
changes in corporate reputation scores. These
ﬁndings were also supported by the signiﬁcant
changes of the F values after DEMPL(t) and

there was a negative correlation

 5   2.10, po0.05). Therefore, one may con-
clude that employee decreases for any reason
have a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on reputation.

Hypothesis 2 predicts that downsizing (caused
by lay-oﬀs) and downscoping (caused by sales of
divisions) have diﬀerent eﬀects on reputation.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis can be found
in Model 3, where the signiﬁcance levels of the
for downsizing and downscoping
coeﬃcients
diﬀered. Downsizing (DN(t))
reached higher
levels of signiﬁcance (po0.001) than downscop-
ing (DOWNSCOP(t), po0.05) (see Table 2).

Although this evidence indicates that H2 is
supported, further tests for the signiﬁcance of the
diﬀerence between the coeﬃcients for downsizing
and downscoping were conducted for Model 3.
Following a procedure suggested in Neter,
Wasserman, and Kunter (1990, p. 284),
two
regression models were compared, a full model
(F) and a reduced one (R). The full model was
Model 3, where diﬀerent coeﬃcients were as-
sumed for downsizing (DV(t)) and downscoping
(DOWNSCOP(t)), and a reduced model (R),
where the two coeﬃcients were assumed to be
equal. The critical *F was 5.464F(0.95, 1,
470) ﬃ 5.15, again supporting H2.

Discussion, Implications and Conclusion

The purpose of this study was to investigate the
impact of downsizing on corporate reputation.
Through its ﬁndings it contributes not only to
research dealing with the drivers of corporate
reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Rindo-
va, 1997; Zyglidopoulos, 2001), but also the
downsizing literature (Lewin and Johnston, 2000;
McKinley, Mone and Barker, 1998) and the
treatment of downsizing through a resource-
based view perspective.

First, it has found that while downsizing and
downscoping have negative impacts on corporate
reputation, downsizing is more damaging than
downscoping. This suggests that managers and
ﬁnancial analysts (the population of our data-
base) perceive downsizing to be a sign of
weakness, despite oppositional arguments by
some researchers. From a resource-based view,
these ﬁndings indicate that beyond the damage
that downsizing inﬂicts on other intangible ﬁrm
resources (i.e. innovation and learning capacity)
it also damages the ﬁrm’s reputation, which is

S. C. Zyglidopoulos

arguably its most strategically signiﬁcant intan-
gible resource.

In conclusion, this study found that downsizing
has a negative impact on corporate reputation.
Furthermore, downsizing has more of such a
negative impact than downscoping. Therefore,
adding to the indeterminate evidence on the eﬀect-
iveness of downsizing, and the additional down-
sizing costs related to capability erosion and social
responsibility, these ﬁndings suggest that down-
sizing has a higher potential for pain than gain.
