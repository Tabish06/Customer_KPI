Leadership  style,  organizational  culture
and  performance:  empirical  evidence
from  UK  companies

Emmanuel  Ogbonna  and  Lloyd  C.  Harris

Abstract The  topics  of  leadership and  organizational culture have  attracted consider-
able interest from both academics and practitioners. Much of the interest in the two areas
is  based  on  explicit  and  implicit  claims that  both  leadership  and  culture  are  linked  to
organizational performance. However, while  the  links  between leadership and  perform-
ance  and  between  culture  and  performance  have  been  examined  independently,  few
studies have investigated the association between the three concepts. This paper examines
the  nature  of  this  relationship  and  presents  empirical evidence which  suggests  that the
relationship  between  leadership  style  and  performance  is  mediated  by  the  form  of
organizational culture that is present. The paper concludes with a number of implications
for  theory  and  practice.

Keywords Organizational culture; leadership style; performance; United  Kingdom.

Introduction

An  examination  of  the  literature in  the   elds  of  organizational  culture  and  leadership
 nds that the two areas have been independently  linked to organizational  performance.
For  example,  researchers have  examined  the  links  between  leadership  styles  and  per-
formance  (see  Bycio  et  al.,  1995;  Howell  and  Avolio,  1993),  and  also  between
organizational  culture  and  performance (see Deal and  Kennedy,  1982;  Denison,  1990;
Ouchi, 1981; Pascale and Athos, 1981; Peters and Waterman, 1982; Kotter and Heskett,
1992).  Furthermore,  numerous  aspects of the organizational  culture  literature allude to
the  role  of  leaders  in  ‘creating’  and  ‘maintaining’  particular  types  of  culture  (for
example, Schein, 1992;  Siehl, 1985).  Equally, the literature on leadership suggests that
the  ability  to  understand  and  work  within  a  culture  is  a  prerequisite  to  leadership
effectiveness (see Hennessey,  1998).

However, despite the implicit and explicit linking  of leadership and culture in many
parts  of  organization  theory,  little  critical  research  attention  has  been  devoted  to
understanding  the  links  between  the  two  concepts  and  the  impact  that  such  an
association might have on organizational performance. The absence of critical literature
exploring  the performance implications of the links between organizational culture and
leadership  is  surprising  given  the  numerous  references  to  the  importance  of  the  two
concepts  in  the  functioning  of  organizations  (see, for  example,  Fiedler,  1996;  Schein,
1992).  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  empirical  evidence  of  the  links  between
different types of organizational culture, a range of leadership styles and organizational

performance.  This  is  achieved  through  the  presentation  of  the  results  of  a  cross-
sectional survey of leadership style, organizational culture, and performance across UK
companies.

The  paper  begins  with  a  brief  review of  the  literature on  leadership,  organizational
culture, and performance. This is followed by a discussion of the methodology  adopted
for the study and the presentation of the  ndings and analysis of responses to a mailed
questionnaire  exploring  the  links  between  the  two  concepts  and  performance.  The
evidence demonstrates that the relationship between leadership style and performance is
mediated  by  the  nature  of  organizational  culture.  In  the   nal  part  of  the  paper,  the
conclusions  and  implications  of  the  study  are  highlighted.

Literature  review

The literature review presented in this paper is examined in three stages. First, studies
of the links between leadership style  and performance are discussed. Second,  research
into  the  organizational  culture–performance  link  is  examined  and,   nally,  studies
combining  the  analysis  of  both  organizational  culture  and  leadership  style  are
presented.

Leadership  and  performance

An  overview  of  the  history  of  research  into  the  topic  of  leadership   nds  that  the
literature on  leadership  and  performance can be  broadly  categorized into  a number  of
important  phases.  Early  studies  on  leadership  (frequently  categorized as ‘trait’ studies
on  leadership)  concentrated  on  identifying  the  personality  traits  which  characterized
successful  leaders  (Argyris,  1955;  Mahoney  et  al.,  1960).  Trait  theories  assume  that
successful  leaders  are  ‘born’  and  that  they  have  certain  innate  qualities  which
distinguish  them  from  non-leaders  (see  Stodgill,  1948).  However,  the  dif culty  in
categorizing and validating these characteristics led to widespread criticism of this trait
approach,  signalling  the  emergence  of  ‘style’  and  ‘behavioural’  approaches  to
leadership  (Stodgill,  1948).  Style  and  behavioural  theorists  shifted  the  emphasis away
from  the  characteristics  of  the  leader  to  the  behaviour  and  style  the  leader  adopted
(Hemphill  and  Coons,  1957;  Likert,  1961).  The  principal  conclusion  of  these  studies
appears  to  be  that  leaders  who  adopt  democratic  or  participative  styles  are  more
successful  (see,  for  example,  Bowsers  and  Seashore,  1966).  In  this  sense, these  early
studies  are  focused  on  identifying  the  ‘one  best  way  of  leading’.

Similarly  to  trait  theories,  the  major  weakness  of  style  and  behavioural  theories  is
that  they  ignore  the  important  role  which  situational  factors  play  in  determining  the
effectiveness of individual  leaders (Mullins, 1999). It is this limitation that gives rise to
the  ‘situational’  and  ‘contingency’ theories  of  leadership  (for  example, Fiedler,  1967;
House,  1971;  Vroom and  Yetton, 1974)  which  shift the  emphasis away from  ‘the  one
best  way to lead’ to  context-sensitive  leadership.  Although  each study  emphasizes the
importance  of  different  factors,  the  general  tenet  of  the  situational  and  contingency
perspectives is that leadership effectiveness is dependent  on the leader’s diagnosis  and
understanding of situational factors, followed by the adoption of the appropriate style to
deal with  each  circumstance.

However, in an apparent return to the ‘one best way of leadership’, recent studies on
leadership have contrasted ‘transactional’ leadership with ‘transformational’ leadership.
Transactional  leaders  are  said  to  be  ‘instrumental’  and  frequently  focus  on  exchange


768 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

relationship  with  their  subordinates  (Bass  and  Avolio,  1993).  In  contrast,  transforma-
tional  leaders  are  argued  to  be  visionary  and  enthusiastic,  with  an  inherent  ability  to
motivate  subordinates  (Bycio  et al.,  1995;  Howell  and  Avolio,  1993).

Although  the  brief  summary above  indicates  that  research into  leadership  has gone
through  periods  of  scepticism,  recent  interest  has  focused  on  the  importance  of  the
leadership role to the success of organizations. Fiedler (1996), one of the most respected
researchers on leadership, has provided a recent treatise on the importance of leadership
by  arguing  that  the  effectiveness of  a leader is  a  major determinant  of  the  success or
failure of  a group,  organization,  or even  an  entire  country.  Indeed,  it  has been argued
that one way in which organizations  have sought  to cope with the increasing volatility
and  turbulence  of  the  external  environment  is  by  training  and  developing  leaders  and
equipping  them  with  the  skills  to  cope  (Darcy  and  Kleiner,  1991;  Hennessey,  1998;
Saari et al., 1988).  These claims are based on the assumption  of  a direct link  between
leadership  and  organizational  performance.  This  assumption  requires  critical review.
Widely  celebrated  cases  of  a  direct  leadership–performance  link  may  be  found  in
numerous  anecdotal  accounts  of  improvements  of  company  performance  attributed  to
changes  in  leadership  (see, for  example,  Nicholls,  1988;  Quick,  1992;  Simms,  1997).
However,  empirical  studies  into  the  links  between  leadership  and  performance  have
been lacking. One notable exception is the detailed study of the impact of leadership on
performance in the somewhat surprising context of Icelandic  shing ships. Thorlindsson
(1987)  suggests  that  variations  in  the  performance  of  different   shing  ships,  under
identical  conditions,  can be  accounted  for  by  the  leadership  skills  of  captains.  Over a
three-year period, Thorlindsson  (1987) revealed that the leadership qualities of the ship
captains  accounted  for  35  to  49  per cent  of  variation  in  the  catch  of  different  crews.
Other studies which examine the links between leadership and performance coincide
with  the re-emergence of the  ‘one best way to lead’ debate.  Of particular relevance is
the resurgence of interest into charismatic leadership, which is frequently referred to as
transformational leadership (Bass and Avolio, 1993).  A number of researchers theorize
that  transformational  leadership  is  linked  to  organizational  performance  (see,  for
example, Bycio et al., 1995;  Howell and Avolio, 1993).  Conceptually,  it is argued that
the  visionary  and  inspirational  skills  of  transformational  leaders motivate  followers  to
deliver  superior  performance  (Nicholls,  1988;  Quick,  1992).

In  summary,  much  of  the  above  evidence  presented  as  supporting  the  claim  of  a
leadership–performance  link  is  anecdotal  and  frequently  over-concentrates  on  the
‘transformational’  role  of  leaders  in  corporate  successes  (for  example,  Quick,  1992;
Simms, 1997;  Taf nder, 1995).  It would appear that few studies have responded to the
observation  of  Porter  and  Mckibbin  (1988)  that  much  of  the  research  reported  as
supporting  this  claim  is  either  inconclusive  or  empirically  suspect.  The  limited  or
inconclusive character of research  ndings in this area suggests the need to investigate
further  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  leadership  and  performance.

Organizational  culture  and  performance

While the evidence of a leadership–performance link is largely anecdotal, considerably
more  research  has  empirically  examined  the  organizational  culture–performance
relationship.  Indeed,  an  examination  of  the  literature  is  likely  to  conclude  that
organizational  culture is one of the most popular  concepts in the  elds of management
and organizational theory. One re ection of the popularity  of the culture concept is the
increasing  number  of  theoretical  perspectives  (see  Martin,  1992)  and  organizational
disciplines  which  utilize  the  concept  (for  example,  Harris and  Ogbonna,  1999).

It  is  arguable  that  the  academic acceptance of  culture,  without  the  usual  squabbles
and  scepticism  associated  with  new  concepts,  is  a  major  indication  of  the  perceived
importance of the  concept (Alvesson, 1990).  However, this is not  to infer that  there is
consensus  on  the  meaning  and  relevance  of  the  concept.  On  the  contrary,  there  is
widespread  disagreement  on  the  de nition  and  scope  of  the  organizational  culture
concept  (see  Ogbonna  and  Harris,  1998a).  Consequently,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  three
main  issues.  First,  many  researchers  note  that  treating  culture  as  a  unitary  concept
reduces its value as an analytic tool  (for  example, Martin,  1992;  Ogbonna  and Harris,
1998a;  Pettigrew,  1979).  Second,  culture  cannot  be  equated  to  power  and  politics  or
climate (Denison, 1996; Riley, 1983; Schein, 1986); and, third, there is disagreement on
whether  organizational  culture  can  be  easily  changed  (Legge,  1994;  Ogbonna,  1993).
One  of  the  major  reasons  for  the  widespread  popularity  of  and  interest  in
organizational  culture  stems from  the  argument  (or  assumption)  that  certain organiza-
tional  cultures  lead to  superior  organizational   nancial  performance.  Many  academics
and  practitioners  argue  that  the  performance  of  an  organization  is  dependent  on  the
degree  to  which  the  values  of  the  culture  are widely  shared,  that  is,  are  ‘strong’  (see
Deal  and  Kennedy,  1982;  Denison,  1990;  Kotter  and  Heskett,  1992;  Ouchi,  1981;
Pascale and  Athos,  1981;  Peters  and  Waterman,  1982).

The  claim  that  organizational  culture  is  linked  to  performance  is  founded  on  the
perceived  role  that  culture  can  play  in  generating  competitive  advantage  (see Scholz,
1987).  Krefting and  Frost (1985)  suggest that  the  way in  which  organizational  culture
may create competitive advantage is by  de ning  the  boundaries  of the  organization  in
a  manner  which  facilitates  individual  interaction  and/or  by  limiting  the  scope  of
information  processing to  appropriate  levels. Similarly, it is argued that widely  shared
and  strongly  held  values  enable management to  predict  employee  reactions to  certain
strategic options  thereby minimizing  the scope for undesired  consequences (Ogbonna,
1993).  Theorists  also  argue  that  sustainable  competitive  advantage  arises  from  the
creation  of  organizational  competencies  which  are  both  superior  and  imperfectly
imitable by competitors (Reed and DeFillippi,  1990).  To this end, it is argued  that the
‘uniqueness quality’ of organizational culture makes it a potentially powerful source of
generating  advantage  over  competitors.  Indeed,  many  commentators  have  advised
organizations and researchers to exploit the multiple advantages which could be offered
by  culture  rather  than  focusing  on  the  more  tangible  side  of  the  organization  (for
example,  Johnson,  1992;  Prahalad  and  Bettis,  1986).

Early researchers who link culture to organizational performance are unequivocal  in
their  claims.  An  illustration  of  this  is  derived  from  the  works  of  the  so-called
‘excellence writers’ who argue that  successful organizations  are distinguished  by their
ability to promote cultural values which are consistent with their chosen strategies (for
example, Deal and Kennedy,  1982;  Ouchi,  1981;  Pascale and Athos, 1981;  Peters and
Waterman, 1982). Although this view met with initial popularity, the principal tenets of
the  argument  have  been  subjected  to  extensive  criticism  (for  example,  Legge,  1994;
Ogbonna,  1993;  Willmott,  1993).

By the 1990s,  researchers assessing the links between culture and performance were
more  cautious.  For  example,  Gordon  and  DiTomaso  (1992)  and  Denison  (1990)  both
propose  that  there  is  a  link  between  certain  organizational  culture  characteristics  and
performance but each add a number of provisos. In particular, they note that culture will
remain linked with superior performance only if the culture is able to adapt to changes
in environmental  conditions.  Furthermore,  the culture must not  only  be strong  (widely
shared),  but  it  must  also  have  unique  qualities  which  cannot  be  imitated.  However,
more  recently,  it  has  been  suggested  that  the  relationship  between  culture  and


770 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

performance  is  tenuous  (Hop   et  al.,  1992;  Lewis,  1994;  Lim,  1995;  Ray,  1986;
Willmott,  1993).  Indeed,  the  growing  popularity  of  the  resource-based  view  of
competitive  advantage  suggests  that  the  degree to  which  a culture can be  theorized  to
determine a sustainable advantage is dependent  upon  the value, rarity, imitability,  and
sustainability  of  the  culture  concerned  (Barney,  1986,  1991).

Overall,  the  literature  on  organizational  culture  is  rich  and  diverse.  Much  of  the
richness  is  founded  on  the  claim  by  many  researchers  that  culture  is  linked  to
organizational performance. While, some theorists have questioned the universality of a
culture–performance  link,  suf cient  evidence  exists  to  suggest  that  organizational
culture  is  associated  with  organizational  performance.

Leadership  and  organizational  culture

The  earlier  review  of  the  literature  on  the  relationship  between  leadership  and
performance and between culture and performance  nds that many commentators note
that  the  performance  of  an  organization  is  dependent  on  the  conscious  alignment  of
employee values with  the espoused values of company strategy.  This clearly indicates
that  organizational  culture  and leadership  are linked.  The following  is a review of the
literature  on  this  issue.

One way of uncovering the relationship between culture and leadership is to examine
how  culture  has  been  conceptualized  in  organizational  theory.  Smircich  (1983)
identi es  two  approaches  to  the  study  of  the  cultural  phenomenon  in  organizations:
culture  as  an  organizational  variable,  then  culture  seen  as  something which  can  be
manipulated. Thus the nature, direction, and impact of such manipulation are dependent
on  the skills and abilities of the leader. The majority of the literature which extols the
virtues  of  transformational  leadership  demonstrates  widespread  support  for  this  view
(for example, Nicholls, 1988; Quick, 1992; Simms, 1997). In contrast, if culture is seen
as  an  integral  part  of  the  organization,  then  the  thinking,  feeling,  and  responses  of
leaders are  moulded  by  the  culture  (Bass  and  Avolio,  1993;  Schein,  1992).

Schein (1992) observes that organizational culture and leadership are intertwined. He
illustrates  this  inter-connection  by  looking  at  the  relationship  between  leadership  and
culture  in  the  context  of  the  organizational  life  cycle.  Thus,  during  the  process  of
organizational  formation,  the  founder  of  a  company  creates  an  organization  which
re ects their values and beliefs. In this sense, the founder creates and shapes the cultural
traits of their organization.  However, as the organization develops and time passes, the
created  culture  of  the  organization  exerts  an  in uence  on  the  leader  and  shapes
the  actions  and  style  of  the  leader.  Through  this  dynamic  ongoing  process,  the  leader
creates  and  is  in  turn  shaped  by  the  organizational  culture.  In  summarizing  the
consensus of opinion  on  the links between organizational  culture and leadership, Bass
and  Avolio  (1993)  mirror  the  argument  of  Schein  (1992)  by  suggesting  that  the
relationship  between  the  two  concepts  represents  an  ongoing  interplay  in  which  the
leader  shapes  the  culture  and  is  in  turn  shaped  by  the  resulting  culture.

Bass  (1985)  demonstrates  the  relationship  between  leadership  and  culture  by
examining  the  impact  of  different  styles  of  leadership  on  culture.  He  argues  that
transactional  leaders  tend  to  operate  within  the  con nes  and  limits  of  the  existing
culture, while transformational leaders frequently work towards changing the organiza-
tional  culture  in  line  with  their  vision.  Similarly,  Brown  (1992)  observes  that  good
leaders need  to  develop  the  skills  that  enable  them to  alter aspects  of  their  culture  in
order  to  improve  their  organizational  performance.


Ogbonna  and  Harris:  Leadership  style,  organizational  culture  and  performance

771

While  there  is  no  shortage  of  claims  that  leadership  and  culture  are  linked  in  the
literature (Bass and Avolio,  1993;  Nicholls, 1988;  Quick, 1992;  Schein, 1992;  Simms,
1997), there have been very few empirical examinations of the nature and performance
implications of this link. One exception is a recent study of organizational change in the
United States federal civil service. Hennessey concludes that leadership played a major
role  in  nurturing  the  appropriate  organizational  culture  which  helped  to  improve  the
implementation  of  speci c  government  reforms.  Hennessey  further  argues  that  ‘the
most effective leaders foster, support,  and sustain organizational  cultures that facilitate
the  type  of  management  reform  envisioned  by  “reinventing  government”  and  the
attendant  increases in  effectiveness  and  ef ciency’  (1998:  523).

The  above  review   nds  that  the  link  between  leadership  and  organizational
performance, the relationship  between organizational culture and performance, and the
interplay  between  leadership  and  culture  have  each  been  studied  separately.  Inter-
estingly,  few  empirical  studies  have  combined  the  simultaneous  examination  of
organizational  culture,  leadership  style,  and  performance.  While  some  writers  suggest
that (1) the style of a leader affects performance, (2) certain types of culture are linked
to  superior  performance, and  (3)  culture  and  leadership  are related, the  precise nature
and  form  of  interaction  between  these three  concepts  is  not  fully  understood.  Clearly
further research is necessary to identify, explore, and elucidate the character and pattern
of  association  between  organizational  culture,  leadership  style,  and  performance.
However,  some  literature-based  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  First,  the  purported
relationship  between  leadership  style  and  performance  is  based  largely  on  anecdotal
evidence  (Nicholls,  1988;  Quick,  1992;  Simms,  1997),  while  the  links  between
organizational culture and performance are supported by empirical studies (for example,
Gordon  and  DiTomaso,  1992;  Denison,  1990).  On  the  basis of  studies  which  suggest
that leadership style shapes the nature of organizational culture (see, for instance, Bass
and  Avolio,  1993;  Schein,  1992),  it  is  possible  to  propose  that:

P1 The  link  between leadership  style  and  organizational  performance is mediated

by  the  nature  and  form  of  organizational  culture.

In  order  to  guide  later  discussions  this  proposition  is  presented  in  diagram  form  in
Figure  1.

Research design  and  methodology

To evaluate the  ef cacy of  the  model  presented  in Figure  1, a descriptive  quantitative
research  design  is  clearly  appropriate.  Consequently,  a  multi-industry  sample  of  one
thousand  units  was  drawn  from  the  FAME  database  of  registered  United  Kingdom
 rms.  Suitable  medium-  and  large-sized   rms  were  selected  via  the  utilization  of  a
systematic random  selection  procedure  with  appropriate  units  selected  on  a variety  of
criteria,  including  company  turnover,  date  of  registration,  and  number  of  employees.
In  order  to  limit  potential  measurement  error,  responses  were  required  from  key
informants knowledgeable  in a variety of tactical and strategic activities (Bowman and
Ambrosini,  1997;  Snow  and  Hrebiniak,  1980;  Hambrick,  1981;  Nayyar,  1992).  While
some researchers argue  that the use of a single  respondent  may be unreliable (see, for
example, Bowman and Ambrosini, 1997),  other authors suggest that this issue may not
be  a  problem  in  certain  contexts  (see  Zahra  and  Covin,  1993).  Similarly,  other
researchers have  noted  the  potential  negative effect of  multiple  respondents  on  usable
response rates (see, for example, Malhotra, 1993),  the dif culties of survey administra-
tion  (Slater,  1995),  and  the  problems  arising  from poor  inter-rater  reliability  (see, for
example,  Dholakia  et  al.,  1993;  Gundlach  and  Cadotte,  1994).  Consequently,  it  was
decided to adopt a single-respondent  approach and a senior executive was selected as a
key  informant  in  each  sampling  unit.

The  ef cient  and  effective  administration  and  implementation  of  a  survey  sig-
ni cantly  in uence  the  overall  success  of  data  generation  and  the  achievement  of
satisfactory  responses  (see,  for  example,  Dillman,  1978;  Churchill,  1991;  Faria  and
Dickinson,  1992).  Indeed,  a  plethora  of  prescriptive  articles  and  books  offer  helpful
suggestions  on  effective  survey  design  and  execution,  including  advice  on  pre-
noti cation  protocol,  response  incentives,  and  follow-up  mailings  (see,  for  instance,
Diamantopoulos  et al., 1991; Duncan, 1979; Murphy  et al., 1990; Paxson, 1992).  In an
effort  to  improve  content  validity  and  response  rates  the  survey  was  designed,
formulated, and implemented in a manner which closely followed the recommendations
of a variety of authors. In particular, the recommendations on questionnaire design and
layout,  survey  piloting,  and  pre-noti cation  and  post-survey  follow-up  reminders  by
Dillman  (1978),  Churchill  (1991),  and  Conant  et  al.,  (1990)  were adopted.

Clearly, a crucial aspect of survey methodology is the development of a questionnaire
which  is appropriate  for its purpose  (Sheatsley,  1983;  Churchill,  1991).  Consequently,
a  research  instrument  was  developed  which  follows  the  framework  recommended  by
Churchill  (1991),  which  in  turn  is  based  on  the  earlier  work  of  Kornhauser  and
Sheatsley  (1976).  The  nine-step  iterative  series  of  guidelines  developed  by  Churchill
(1991) provides  a rigorous systematic procedure for the formulation of a questionnaire
which greatly improves content  validity.  A review of existing  theories, operationaliza-
tions,  and  measures  suggested  that  the  measurement  of  organizational  culture,
leadership  style,  and  organizational  performance  could  be  reliably  achieved  via  the
adoption  of  measures adapted  from  extant  literature.

A variety of organizational culture theorists have presented a number of measures of
organizational  culture  (see,  for  example,  Cooke  and  Rousseau,  1988;  Xenikou  and
Furnham,  1996).  A  review  of  these  measures  indicates  that  each  of  the  developed
measures of  culture  re ect  the  creators’ view and  de nition  of  organizational  culture.
Thus, where a theorist de nes organizational  culture as a series of values, the measure
of  culture  focuses  on  values,  whereas  de nitions  of  culture  which  focus  on  artefacts
lead  to  measures  which  focus  on  organizational  creations  (see  Harris  and  Ogbonna,
1999).  However,  pre-survey  discussions  with  executives  revealed  that  the  Deshpande

et  al.  (1993)  view  of  culture  was  consistent  with  the  opinions  of  practitioners  while
concordant  with  contemporary  theory.  The  measure of  organizational  culture  adapted
from  that  of  Deshpande  et  al.  (1993),  which  in  turn  was  largely  based  on  the  earlier
work  of  Campbell  and  Freeman  (1991)  and  Quinn  (1988),  is  viewed  as  theoretically
superior to other measures on the basis that the battery concentrates on the measurement
of  two  key  continua  of  organizational  culture:  organic-mechanistic  and  internal
maintenance-external  positioning.  Furthermore,  the  measure  is  succinct,  easy  to
administer,  and  respondent  friendly.  Consequently,  for  practical  and  for  conceptual
reasons  the  Deshpande  et  al.  (1993)  battery  was  adopted  and  used  in  the  survey
instrument. However, the labels of culture used by Deshpande et al. (1993) were altered
to the labels competitive,  innovative,  bureaucratic,  and  community  culture  since these
were  considered  more  accurate  by  practitioners  and  theoretically  justi able  by  the
researchers. The exact wording of questions and items gauging organizational culture is
presented  in  Table 1.

The measure of perceived leadership style was also derived from extant literature. A
review of literature pertaining  to the measurement of leadership behaviour,  styles, and
characteristics suggested that a large number of measures might possibly be appropriate
(for  example,  Fiedler,  1967;  Bowsers  and  Seashore,  1966).  However,  the  measure of
perceived leadership style of House (1971a,b)  and House and Dessler (1974),  which in
turn was principally based on the earlier work of Fleishman (1957) and Stogdill (1963),
was  presented  as  reliable  and  valid  by  a  number  of  respected  authors  and  texts  (for
example,  Teas, 1981;  Kohli,  1989).  Indeed,  this  measure of  leadership  style  has been
widely  used  in  a variety  of  literatures and is generally accepted as a good  measure of
perceptions of  leadership  style  (see Teas, 1981;  Kohli,  1989).  The precise wording  of
questions  and  items  measuring  leadership  style  is  presented  in  Table  2.

It  is accepted that business performance is a multi-dimensional  and  highly  complex
phenomenon  (Lenz,  1981;  Venkatraman  and  Ramanujam,  1987).  While  a  number  of
studies  have  measured  business  performance  as  uni-  or  bi-dimensional,  following  the
suggestions of Day and Wensley (1988) and Day and Nedungadi (1994) it was resolved
to  gauge  performance  on  dimensions  which  re ected  a  broad  balance  between
customer-focus  and  competitor-centred  perspectives.  Consequently,  a  measure  of
organization  performance  was  synthesized  from  a  range  of  studies  adapted  from  the
constructs of the preceding authors. Performance was measured by analysing long- and
short-term  performance  constellated  around  two  generic  questions  complemented  by
 ve  variables  which  referred  to  performance  in  customer  satisfaction,  sales  growth,
market  share,  competitive  advantage,  and  sales volume.

While  a  number  of  past  studies  had  utilized   ve-point  scales  to  gauge  perceived
leadership style  (Kohli,  1989),  Barnes et al. (1994)  argue that  a switch to  seven-point
scales has no effect on principal components analysis but often improves the reliability
of  answers.  Consequently,  it  was  decided  to  adopt  the  commonly  used  seven-point
Likert-type  scoring  (Likert,  1932a,  1932b)  for  all  items,  since  the  use  of  seven-point
scales may  improve  reliability  and  validity  (Churchill  and  Peter,  1984)  as  well  as  all
response  rates  (Malhotra,  1993).

After two follow-up  reminders, 342  responses  were received. Unfortunately,  twenty
of  these  responses  were  ineligible  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  company
liquidation  and  inadequate  completion  of  the  survey  instrument.  Following  the
recommendations  of  the  Council  of  American  Survey  Research  Organizations
(CASRO, 1982),  response rates were calculated in a manner which removed ineligible
responses  from  the  sample size. This  calculation  resulted in  a return  rate of  34.22  per
cent.  The  majority  of  respondents  were male (87  per  cent),  the  average  age was  41.3


774 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

years, the  average length  of  service was nearly  six  years, while  the  average length  of
time in  the  current  position  was nearly  four  and  one  half  years. No  major differences
were  found  between  early  and  late  respondents  or  between  population  and  sample
industrial  classi cations,  suggesting  that  response  bias  may  not  be  a  problem.  The
following  section  details  the  results  of  a  range  of  analyses  of  the  responses  to  the
questionnaire.

Findings

Prior  to  the  examination  of  associations  between  leadership  style,  organizational
culture, and performance, a phase of data reduction was necessary. The construction  of
meaningful  indices  was  initiated  by  the  use  of  principal  components  analysis  with
varimax rotation. Factor analysis was deemed necessary since it was considered prudent
statistically  to  ascertain  whether  the  adopted  measures  of  organizational  culture  and
leadership  style  captured  differing  dimensions  of  culture  and  style.  The  principal
components  analysis  of  items  pertaining  to  organizational  culture  (see  Table  1)  and
items  relating  to  leadership  style  (see  Table  2)  were  conducted  individually.  In
accordance with the Kaiser criterion (Kaiser, 1958), factor solutions were retained only
if they exhibited an eigenvalue greater than one and if they were conceptually clear and
interpretable  (Churchill,  1991;  Hair et al.,  1998).  It  was not  necessary to  delete items
from the analysis due to lack of variation or because of problems of interpretation. The
identi cation  and  labelling  of  the  seven  extracted  factors  is  discussed  below.

Table  1  presents  the  principal  components  analysis  of  measures  of  organizational
culture  adapted  from  the  work  of  Deshpande  et  al.  (1993),  Campbell  and  Freeman
(1991)  and  Quinn  (1988).  As  expected,  the  factor analysis  of  these items leads  to  the
extraction of four factors which cumulatively explain nearly 60 per cent of the variance.
The  rst factor loads very heavily onto a vector generating an eigenvalue of over three
and  accounting  for  over  22  per  cent of  the  variance. Given  that  these items appear to
gauge  the  extent  to  which  an  organizational  culture  is  innovative,  the  solution  is
accepted and ascribed the label innovative culture. The second factor solution loads four
items onto a vector generating an eigenvalue of over two and accounting for nearly 16
per cent of total variance. Each of the four items appears to gauge the degree to which
an organizational culture is competitive in nature. Consequently the solution is accepted
and the factor labelled as competitive culture. The penultimate factor solution loads four
items onto  a vector generating  an eigenvalue of above two. The four items within  this
factor  solution  seem  to  gauge  the  degree  to  which  culture  is  bureaucratic  in  nature,
leading to the labelling of the factor as bureaucratic culture. The  nal factor loads onto
a vector generating an eigenvalue of over one. The four items focus on the extent which
the  culture  of  an  organization  is  focused  on  the  generation  and  maintenance  of  an
internal  community.  The  factor  is approved  and  given  the  label community  culture.  It
should  be  noted  that  the  labels adopted  for  the  study  correspond  (respectively)  to  the
market, adhocracy, clan, and  hierarchy cultures  of Deshpande  et al.  (1993).  However,
following  discussions  with  informed  practitioners  and  researchers,  the  labels  com-
petitive,  innovative,  bureaucratic,  and  community  culture  are  used,  since  they  are
considered more practically applicable and conceptually  valid.  These labels are similar
or  consistent  with  the  suggestions  of  a  number  of  organizational  theorists  (see,  for
example,  Ouchi,  1980;  Mintzberg,  1979;  Campbell  and  Freeman,  1991;  Quinn,
1984).

Table 2 presents the principal components analysis of the adapted items of the House
(1971a)  and  House  and  Dessler (1974)  measure of  leadership  style.  As  expected,  this

776 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

factor analysis leads to the extraction of three factor solutions which explain over 66 per
cent of variance (see Table 2). The  rst factor solution  loads very heavily onto a vector
generating  an eigenvalue of over  ve. The  ve items which comprise this solution  are
geared towards the measurement of leadership participation.  This style of leadership is
a  non-directive  form  of  role-clarifying  behaviour  which  is  gauged  by  the  extent  to
which  leaders  allow  subordinates  to  in uence  decisions  by  requesting  input  and
contribution.  The items in this factor are conceptually consistent and easily interpreted,
leading to their labelling as participative leadership  style, with a shorthand  notation  of
participative  leadership.  The  second  factor solution  again  loads  heavily  onto  a vector
generating  an eigenvalue of  over two.  The four items of  the solution  account  for  over
15 per cent of the variance and appear to gauge leadership consideration. This measure
of  supportive  leadership  (occasionally  referred to  as leadership  consideration)  focuses
on  the  degree  to  which  the  behaviour  of  a  leader  can  be  viewed  as  sympathetic,
amicable,  and  considerate  of  subordinate  needs.  Consequently,  the  second  factor
solution  is accepted  and  given  the  label  supportive  leadership  style,  with  a  shorthand
label of  supportive  leadership.  The   nal  factor solution  comprises  those  items geared
towards  the  measurement  of  leadership  instrumentality.  This  measure  of  leadership
style  is  akin  to  directive  or  transactional  leadership  and  is  designed  to  measure  the
extent  to  which  leaders  specify  expectations,  establish  procedures,  and  allocate  tasks.
The  solution  is,  therefore,  given  the  label  instrumental  leadership  style,  with  the
shorthand  of  instrumental  leadership.

Given the widespread use of judgemental and comparative measures of performance,
an index of performance was constructed by calculating the summated mean of all items
for  each case. This  derived  scale was  labelled  organizational  performance.  Similarly,
indices were constructed for the four types of organizational culture and the three forms
of leadership style through  calculating the mean summated score for all items for each
factor.

Prior  to  exploring  and describing  the  associations  between leadership style, culture,
and performance, it was deemed necessary to gauge the extent of reliability and validity
for each of the indices used in later analysis. Reliability was judged via the calculation
of  a Cronbach  alpha  coef cient  (Cronbach,  1951).  The  calculation  of  Cronbach  alpha
coef cients  resulted  in  alpha  coef cients  which  ranged  from  0.6688  to  0.9279  (see
Table 3). Six of the eight measures were above the Nunnally (1978) criterion of 0.7 and
could therefore be classi ed as acceptably reliable without further discussion. However,
two  of  the  measures fall  just  below  this  criterion,  causing  concern.  In  contrast  to  the
Nunnally  (1978)  criterion of 0.7,  Peterson (1994)  and Slater (1995)  suggest that 0.6  is
the  ‘criterion-in-use’.  This  suggestion,  coupled  with  the   nding  that  the  deletion  of
additional  items would  merely reduce the  coef cient, led to the  conclusion  that  scales
were well  above  the  ‘criterion-in-use’  and  thus  acceptably reliable.

In  addition  to  the  previously  discussed  efforts  to  improve  content  validity  during
questionnaire  design,  formulation  and  implementation  (see  Dillman,  1978;  Churchill,
1991),  to gauge the validation of index operationalization  for each measure of items in
the scale were correlated to the whole scale. This analysis indicated signi cant bivariate
relationships  in  the  anticipated  direction,  indicating  convergent  validity  (see Table 3).
To gauge discriminant validity, an approach akin to that of Gaski (1986) was adopted.
This analysis involves correlating all the measures adopted in the study and gauging the
correlation coef cients between measures against the alpha  coef cients of  factors (see
Table 4). In the case of both  organizational culture and leadership style, no correlation
coef cient is higher than the alpha coef cient of the scale, leading to the suggestion that
the measures adopted in the study exhibit discrimination. Overall, tests of reliability and

validity  lead  to  the  suggestion  that  the  measures adopted  and  used  in  later  statistical
analyses  fall within  acceptable  reliability  and  validity  criteria.

The initial exploration  of data was undertaken by the examination  of the descriptive
statistics of  measures of  culture,  leadership  style,  and  organizational  performance.  As
stated earlier, all items were measured on seven-point scales resulting in a mid-point of
four.  The  four  measures of  organizational  culture  are  each  somewhat  above  the  mid-
point of four,  with reasonable dispersions  of central tendency.  In contrast, measures of
leadership  are  somewhat  below  the  mid-point,  with  the  mean  for  participative
leadership noticeably  low. Since it is accepted that objective measures of performance
are  highly  related  to  the  utilized  measures  of  performance,  the  comparative  high
performance mean may indicate an above-average SBU performance in this study (see
Dess and  Robinson,  1984;  Pearce et  al.,  1987;  Venkatraman  and  Ramanujam,  1987).
Proposition  1 suggests that the association between leadership style and performance
is  mediated  by  organizational  culture  (see  Figure  1).  In  order  to  explore  potential

associations  between  leadership  style,  organizational  culture,  and  organizational
performance, a path analysis approach,  as discussed by Duncan (1966)  and Pendhazur
(1982),  was  utilized.  Brie y,  this  form  of  analysis  involves  the  use  of  multiple
regression equations to construct a path model of associations. Szymanski et al. (1993)
argue that path analysis provides a clearer understanding of the associations than the use
of  regression  alone.  Indeed,  Szymanski  et  al.  contend  that  the  advantages  of  the  path
methodology  over  that  of  simple regression  stems from the ability  of  the technique  to
‘provide insight into the magnitude of direct effects’, ‘indirect effects (i.e., the effect of
a  predictor  on  the  criterion  variable  through  an  intervening  variable’  and  ‘the  effect
coef cients  (i.e.,  the  total  effect  equal  to  the  direct  plus  indirect  effects)’  (1993:  8).
Consequently,  Szymanski  et  al.  conclude  that  a  path  methodology  enables  the
examination  of  ‘whether  an  indirect  effect  embellishes,  diminishes  or  negates  an
associated  direct  effect’  (1993:  8).  Thus,  the  form  of  path  analysis  used  enables  the
examination  of  indirect  as  well  as  direct  associations,  thus  providing  a  clearer
understanding  of  relationships  (Blalock,  1972;  Duncan,  1966).

Table 6 presents the standardized regression coef cients (beta) and the coef cient of
multiple  determination  (R2)  as  well  as  the  signi cance  of  the  equations.  Table  7
presents the  direct  and  indirect effects of the independent  variables of leadership style
and  organizational  culture  on  the  performance  of  an  organization.  Indirect  effects are
calculated  as  a  simple  multiplicative  measure  of  the  magnitude  of  sequential  beta
weights  (Asher,  1976),  while  total  effects  comprised  the  sum  of  direct  and  indirect
effects  (Pendhazur,  1982).  It  should  be  noted  that  for  each  equation,  tests  for
multicollinearity,  linearity,  normality,  and  homoscedasicity  were  conducted  and  no
problems  encountered.

The path analysis (see Figure 2) constructed from the regression equations presented
in Table 6 and summarized in Table 7 suggests that all four measures of organizational
culture  and  all  three  measures  of  leadership  are  associated  with  organizational
performance in some way. However, the association between the independent  variables
and performance differ in three respects:  rst, in terms of directness, second, in relation
to  the  form  of  effect and,   nally,  in  terms  of  the  extent  of  effect.

Of the seven independent factors, two measures (innovative and competitive cultures)
exert a direct effect (see Tables 6 and 7 and Figure 2). Innovative culture exerts a purely
direct effect on performance, while the effect of competitive culture is both  direct and
indirect  (see  Table  7  and  Figure  2).  In  contrast,  measures  of  bureaucratic  and
community culture and the three measures of leadership style all exert a purely indirect
effect.

The second way in which the effects of the independent factors affect performance is
in the form of effect. The two culture factors exerting a direct in uence and the indirect
effect of  the  measure  of  community  culture  are  all  positively  linked  to  performance,
whereas  the  indirect  effect  of  the  measure  of  bureaucratic  culture  is  negative  (total
0.08). Similarly, two of three measures of leadership style exert an indirect and
effect 5
positive  effect  on  organizational  performance  (participative  style,  total  effect 5
0.11;
0.09). However, the indirect effect of instrumental
supportive  leadership, total effect 5
leadership  is  negative  (total  effect 5
0.08).

Finally, the effects of the independent factors on organizational performance differ in
terms of the impact of total effects. A review of Table 7 demonstrates that the positive
and  direct  effects  of  innovative  and  competitive  cultures  clearly  exert  the  greatest
impact.  In  contrast,  the  indirect  association  of  bureaucratic  and  community  culture  is
signi cant but noticeably weaker. Similarly, the effect of the three forms of leadership
style  is similar, with  a pervasive  effect upon  performance. These points  are important
and  will  be  discussed  later.

In summary, all the independent  factors exert an effect upon  performance, although
the impact and form of the effect differ. The  nding of indirect links between the three
forms  of  leadership  style  and  organizational  performance  supports  the  proposition
developed  earlier, leading  to  the  suggestion  that  suf cient  evidence  is found  to  argue
that  the  link  between  leadership  style  and  performance  is  mediated  by  organizational
culture.

Conclusions  and  implications

In an evaluation of studies of organizational culture, leadership style, and organizational
performance,  it  emerged  that,  while  some  evidence  exists  of  links  between  organiza-
tional  culture  and  performance  and  between  leadership  style  and  performance,  the
combined study of all three of these concepts has been lacking. Consequently, based on
theories which suggest that leadership style and organizational culture are linked, it was
proposed  that  organizational  culture  mediates the  association  between leadership  style
and performance. In an effort to redress this literature imbalance, the results of a survey
were analysed and suf cient empirical evidence found to support this claim. That is, the
results of this study  indicate that leadership style is not  directly  linked  to performance
but is merely indirectly associated. In contrast, competitive and innovative cultural traits
are  directly  linked  with  performance  (as  predicted)  while,  contrary  to  expectations,
community  and  bureaucratic  cultural  traits  are not  directly  related.

Whereas it is frequently  assumed that organizational  culture is directly linked  to the
performance  of  an  organization  (for  example,  Denison,  1990)  and  that  changes  to
cultural  traits  will  impact  immediately  on  effectiveness  and  ef ciency  (for  instance,
Kotter and Heskett, 1992), the results of this study provide mixed support for this view.
Past research into cultural strength has suggested that cultures which are widely shared
(that  is,  strong)  are  positively  linked  with  company  success  (see  Deal  and  Kennedy,
1982;  DiTomaso,  1987;  Sathe,  1983;  Schall,  1983;  Weick,  1985;  Weiner,  1988).
However,  the  results  of  the  current  study  indicate  that  two  forms  of  culture
(bureaucratic  and  community)  are  not directly  related  to  performance.  Interestingly,
both  bureaucratic  and  community  cultures  are  each  characterized  by  an  emphasis  on
integration,  internal cohesiveness, and the establishment of uniformity  (that is creating
a strong culture). In this sense, in the case of internally oriented cultures, little evidence
is found to support claims of a link between cultural strength  and performance. Hence,
while  the  results  indicate  that  the  two  internally  oriented  cultures  are  weakly  and


782 The  International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  Management

indirectly  linked  with  performance,  the  total  effects of  such  cultures  on  performance
(see  Table  7)  are  such  that  signi cant  managerial  attention  to  internal  maintenance
appears  unproductive  or  even  damaging.

However,  the  analysis  of  the  links  between  competitive  and  innovative  forms  of
culture  and  organizational  performance   nds  direct,  strong,  and  positive  associations.
Indeed,  the  coef cient  of  multiple  determination  (R2)  for  the   rst  multiple  regression
analysis (see Table 6)  nds that innovative  and competitive cultures account for nearly
a  quarter  of  the  variance  in  organizational  performance.  Interestingly,  that  which  is
distinctive  about  both  competitive and  innovative  cultures is the emphasis each places
on  competitive  external  positioning  and  responsiveness.  These   ndings  are  broadly
consistent with a range of studies which suggest that externally oriented organizational
cultures are positively  linked  with performance (for example, Slater and Narver, 1994;
Greenley,  1995)  as  well  as  a  growing  body  of  research  which  suggests  that  the
alignment of organizational  culture towards strategic needs is a central, albeit dif cult,
role  for  senior  executives  (see  Harris  and  Ogbonna,  1999).  Therefore,  the   nding  of
positive  associations  between  externally  oriented  cultures  and  performance  suggests
that organizational  culture change efforts should  focus as much on generating  external
focus  as  upon  creating  internal  cohesion  and  consistency.

The  above   ndings  have  implications  for  the  generation  of  competitive  advantage.
Instead of presenting an organization with an advantage over competitors, an internally
oriented  organizational  culture  may  prove  comparatively  disadvantageous  when
compared  to  the  advantages  possible  with  externally  oriented  cultures.  Indeed,  the
negative  links  between  bureaucratic  culture  and  performance  suggest  that  bureau-
cratization  reduces  short-term  pro tability,  impedes  long-term  growth  and  may  even
affect  the  survival  of  the  organization.  In  direct  contrast  to  theories  which  merely
espouse the generation of widely shared values (for example, Denison 1990; Kotter and
Heskett,  1992)  the  results  of  the  current  study  clearly  demonstrate  that  strongly  held
values  are  appropriate  only  if  the  culture  is geared  towards  the  external  environment.
Thus,  competitive  and  innovative  cultures  which  are  sensitive  to  external  conditions
have  a strong  and  positive  impact on  organizational  performance. This  point  provides
some support  for  the work  of  Barney (1986,  1991)  who argues that  for organizational
culture  to  provide  a  source  of  sustainable competitive  advantage,  the  culture  must  be
adaptable  to  external  contingencies.

As  predicted,  the  associations  between  the  leadership  styles  studied  and  organiza-
tional performance are all mediated by some form of organizational culture (see Figure
2).  An  imprudent  interpretation  of  this   nding  could  be  that  leadership  styles  are  not
important  in  relation  to  performance.  This  interpretation  would  clearly  be  unwise.
Whereas leadership  styles  are not  a  strong  direct  predictor  of  organizational  perform-
ance,  the  total  effects  analysis  presented  in  Table  7  indicates  signi cant,  indirect
pervasive  effects on  organizational  performance. Furthermore,  the  multiple  regression
analyses documented in Table 6 indicate that leadership styles are strong  predictors of
both  competitive  and  innovative  cultures  (which  in  turn  are  strong  predictors  of
performance).

Interestingly,  while  all  of  the  leadership  styles  analysed  are  signi cantly  indirectly
associated  with  performance,  instrumental  leadership  is  negatively  linked  while
supportive  and  participative  leadership  styles are positively  related (see Table 7).  The
 nding  of  a  negative  indirect  link  between  instrumental  leadership  and  performance
contributes empirical evidence in support of a large number of anecdotal studies which
claim  that  such  a  ‘transactional’  leadership  style  is  not  consistent  with  superior
performance (see, for example, Bycio et al., 1995;  Bass and Avolio, 1993).  The results


Ogbonna  and  Harris:  Leadership  style,  organizational  culture  and  performance

783

of  the current  study  also  contribute  to  existing  knowledge  of  the  effects of supportive
and  participative  leadership  styles.  While  anecdotal  evidence  of  a  direct  performance
link was not supported, both supportive and participative leadership styles are positively
associated with innovative  and competitive forms of culture. These results indicate that
the generation of an organizational culture, which is externally oriented, is signi cantly
in uenced  by  the  extent  to  which  a  leader  is  supportive  of  followers  and  includes
followers  in  decision-making  processes.

A practical implication arising from this study pertains to what has become known as
the ‘managing culture debate’ (Ogbonna, 1993). As is indicated in the literature review,
considerable debate has occurred on the issue of whether organizational  culture can be
managed.  The  overall  conclusion  of  this debate appears to be  that  the  management of
organizational culture is not possible (see Legge, 1994),  although certain contingencies
(such  as  crises  or  leadership  turnover)  may  present  the  opportunity  to  in uence
organizational  culture (Martin and Meyerson,  1988).  The  ndings  of this study  lead to
the  suggestion  that  a  potential  solution  to  the  dif culties  associated  with  changing
organizational  culture  may  involve  focusing  on  leadership  style.  While,  conceptually
and practically,  managing  culture is at best  dif cult (Ogbonna  and Harris, 1998b)  and
at  worst  impossible  (Ogbonna,  1993),  changes  to  leadership  styles  are  comparatively
easily  achieved.  Consequently,  while  the  literature  is  replete  with  ‘quick- x’  culture
change  programmes  designed  to  improve  organizational  performance  (see  Deal  and
Kennedy,  1982),  the  ndings  of this paper clearly suggest that, consistent with Fiedler
(1996),  leadership-change  programmes would  be  more  appropriate.

While  this  study  is  designed  to  provide  empirical  evidence  of  the  links  between
organizational  culture,  leadership  style,  and  organizational  performance,  as  with  most
social  science  studies,  the  results  of  the  study  raise  additional  questions,  while  the
limitations  of  research  suggest  alternative  avenues  for  research.  Although  the  cross-
sectional nature of the study precludes claims of causality, additional research adopting
a  longitudinal  design  would  provide  interesting  insight  into  the  direction  of  associa-
tions.  Similarly,  while  the   ndings,  implications,  and  conclusions  of  this  study  are
bounded  by  the  context  of  the research, potentially  fruitful  research could  involve  the
replication  of this study in a number of different contexts (including  speci c industries
or different countries).  Finally,  the results of  this  study  are limited and  constrained  by
the  measures adopted  to  gauge  organizational  culture  and  leadership  style.  While  the
measures  used  are  accepted  as  reliable  and  valid  and  their  selection  is  defendable,
additional insights into association may be gained by adopting  measures of culture and
leadership style which re ect different perspectives. Indeed, while it is hoped  that this
study  will  trigger  further  debate,  without  additional  research  it  seems  likely  that  the
links  between  leadership  style,  organizational  culture,  and  performance  will  remain
confusing  to both  practitioners and theorists. Indeed, Schein notes that ‘leadership and
culture are so central to understanding organizations and making them effective that we
cannot  afford  to  be  complacent  about  either  one’  (1985:  327).
