Abstract
Corporate reputation has become an invaluable asset for every company. The literature on
corporate reputation is reviewed and corporate reputation is conceptualised in the context of the
theory of planned behaviour. The effect of corporate reputation on intentions among shareholders is
discussed and research questions formulated. Data are collected from a sample of shareholders of a
publicly listed telephone company. Results indicate that an attitudinal conceptualisation and
operationalisation of corporate reputation provides useful results and diagnostics to help companies
further enhance their corporate reputation.

INTRODUCTION
Corporate reputation is
increasingly
viewed by ﬁrms as an invaluable asset.
Yet, at the same time, there is no clear
deﬁnition of what exactly is meant by
the term. Some deﬁnitions of corporate
reputation adopt a corporate perspec-
tive and focus on brand value or
goodwill, while others focus on public
perception. Despite lack of
agree-
ment regarding exactly what corporate
reputation entails, companies are be-
coming increasingly concerned about it

a positive

and are spending considerable sums
of money to develop and main-
tain a high-quality reputation. It has
been argued that
cor-
porate reputation has a number of
favourable outcomes. Reputation is
said to add value and increase cash
ﬂow and proﬁts;1 result
in increased
sales;2 more credible advertisements;3
improve perceived product quality
and produce higher customer loyalty;4
and attract high-quality job applicants
thereby enhancing the

CORPORATE REPUTATION,
PERCEPTIONS AND SIGNALS
The theoretical underpinnings of cor-
porate reputation are often unclear.
Some deﬁnitions appear to have no
theory; others have taken a signalling
theory perspective, while others use
perception. Fombrun8 deﬁnes
cor-
porate
‘a perceptual
representation of
a company’s past
actions and future prospects that des-

reputation as

cribes the ﬁrm’s overall appeal to all of
its key constituents when compared
with other leading rivals’. Other deﬁni-
tions of reputation similarly focus on
the publics’ perceptions. For instance,
Scheepens9 asserts that reputation is the
sum total of stakeholders’ perceptions,
while Sheldon10 maintains that reputa-
tion value is a direct function of the
perceptions of the public involved with
a company or its brands. It
is only
contingently related to the quality of
products, services or corporate perfor-
mance. Such deﬁnitions have a clear
emphasis on the role of perceptions
among different stakeholders.

In a later deﬁnition, Fombrun and
Van Riel deﬁne corporate reputation
as

‘a collective representation of a ﬁrm’s past
actions and results that describes the ﬁrm’s
ability to deliver valued outcomes to mul-
tiple stakeholders. It gauges a ﬁrm’s relative
standing both internally with employees and
externally with its [other] stakeholders,
in
both the competitive and institutional en-
vironments’.11

This deﬁnition also recognises
the
presence of various stakeholders, and
suggests that reputation must be con-
sidered in its historical context because
it is not only the result of a company’s
latest actions, but also of the company’s
past actions. Deﬁnitions such as this
that focus on the actions undertaken
and signals emitted by a ﬁrm, rather
than perceptions of
stakeholders are
grounded in signalling theory.12 This
theory owes its origin to the biological
sciences and seeks
to explain why
despite an ongoing battle for survival,

A THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR
PERSPECTIVE
Few authors on corporate reputation
appear
taken an explicit

to have

suggests

attitudinal perspective. An attitudinal
conceptualisation to corporate reputa-
tion necessarily adopts a stakeholder’s
perspective and views perceptions as
resulting in beliefs that are in turn an
important element of an attitudinal
conceptualisation. The view of at-
titudes held by most contemporary
the
social psychologists
that
its
main attribute of an attitude is
evaluative nature, and consists of
‘a
disposition to respond favourably or
unfavourably to an object, person,
institution, or event’.15 An attitude is
comprised of three main components:
affect
behavioural beliefs,
and be-
havioural
intentions,
that ultimately
results in action. First, beliefs consist of
knowledge, ideas, and opinions about
an attitude object. For most attitude
objects (the ﬁrm or organisation in the
present case), people may have a set of
beliefs. Beliefs
the possible
consequences of the behaviour and the
value the person gives to these out-
comes
in behavioural beliefs.
The more positive beliefs are associated
with the company and the more
positively each belief
is evaluated,
the more favourable the overall be-
havioural beliefs component will be.
Of course, beliefs need not be true or
correct and need only exist
in the
person’s mind16 and could be expressed
either verbally or nonverbally. They
can be positive, negative or both.
Secondly,
the affective element of
attitude consists of the person’s motions
and feelings toward the attitude object,
usually favourable or unfavourable.
Verbally, affective responses could be
expressions of approval or criticism
while nonverbal
responses
include facial expressions and bodily
reactions to the attitude object. Such

includes intentions, commitments and

Consistency theory, which under-

attitudes, argued that the three separate
components of behavioural beliefs,

should, to some degree, be consistent
with each other because they reﬂect
the same particular attitude.19 There-

The relationship between behavioural
beliefs, affect and behavioural

many social psychologists to treat the
three components separately and use
the term ‘attitude’
to the
affective component only.22 Fishbein

DISCUSSION
The ﬁndings of this research provide
insight
into a different and arguably
more sophisticated view of corporate
reputation than has been commonly
held in previous literature. The view of
corporate reputation as
an attitude
its value beyond generally
extends
favourable outcomes
to speciﬁc be-
havioural
intentions and provides a
more detailed view of the components
that contribute to the construct. The
implications of this extended view are
both theoretical and managerial.

stakeholder

Corporate reputation as an overall
attitude has been measured in this
case using the instrument developed by
Brown.44 This
instrument can easily
be used for different stakeholders and
ﬁrms. However, different stakeholders
will consider diverse issues in arriving
at the corporate reputation of an entity.
Indeed, these issues or beliefs can be
accommodated by the theory and cap-
tured separately. The conceptualisation
adopted in the current
research al-
lows the use of beliefs as an indirect
rather than a direct way of captur-
ing the same construct of corporate
reputation. But in this case the set of
beliefs that need to be considered will
be ﬁrm and/or
speciﬁc.
Hence, the belief side provides a very
useful diagnostic tool to management.
It allows the identiﬁcation of the issues
that go to make up the overall cor-
porate reputation, and by looking at
the evaluation aspect of each belief,
it then provides an understanding of
each belief’s importance. This theoreti-
cal conceptualisation therefore provides
management with a useful diagnostic
tool indicating which aspects need to
be considered and given attention if
overall corporate reputation is to be
enhanced.
From a

stakeholder’s perspective,
corporate reputation as a perception

cludes the stakeholder’s beliefs, affect,

a
more full-bodied view that suggests not

CORPORATE REPUTATION AND SHAREHOLDERS’ INTENTIONS: AN ATTITUDINAL PERSPECTIVE

corporate reputation literature. How-
ever,
the research has a number of
limitations that are worth bearing in
mind. First the study looked at only
one ﬁrm and at only one stakeholder
group within that ﬁrm. Generalisations
to all shareholders of all ﬁrms cannot be
suggested. Neither is it being suggested
that what has been found to be
the salient beliefs among shareholders
are necessarily salient
among other
stakeholders of the same ﬁrm. Similarly,
due to limitations of sample size any
broader based generalisations even to
all shareholders of the ﬁrm under study
must necessarily be made with caution.
Rather, acknowledging these limita-
tions, the approach in this study has
sought to demonstrate the feasibility of
an attitudinal conceptualisation to cor-
porate
successful
application of the related methodology
to a particular context that is relevant
to corporate reputation.

reputation and a

Corporate reputation is a construct
that is gaining popularity and attention
among companies. If organisations are
to direct time and ﬁnancial resources to
building a favourable corporate reputa-
tion, it follows that they should desire
the clearest possible view of exactly
what they are dealing with. TpB does
appear to provide a useful basis
for
the evolution of corporate reputation
even though it
is itself not without
its critics.45–48 Continued debate that
contributes to the ongoing evolution
of understanding of
is
welcomed by both theoreticians and
managers. The conceptualisation and
operationalisation of corporate reputa-
tion as an attitude appears to offer an
alternative view to existing concep-
tualisations of the construct and as such
may contribute to the ongoing evolu-
tion of the concept.
