THE  EFFECT  OF  UNIONS  ON  PRODUCTIVITY:

The purpose of this paper is to compare the abilities of two competing analytical techniques
—mathematical programming and statistical regression—to shed light on the union/nonunion
productivity  differential  in  U.S. surface  coal  mining.  The  programming  approach  has the
virtues of being nonparametric (and thus extremely flexible) and of being able to provide a
decomposition  of productivity  differentials  into three components—differences  in technical
efficiency,  differences  in scale efficiency,  and differences  in con^stion. Identification  of these
three components provides an aid to mam^ement in its search for the sources of, and  remedies
for,  productivity  gaps. The econometric approach, on the other hand, is neither flexible nor
does it provide such a decomposition; its chief virtue lies in the fact that, being stochastic, it
allows for the presence of noise and measurement error that plagues most if not all empirical
data. Thus, the two approaches have complementary virtues.

The two techniques are used to investigate productivity in two samples of U.S. surface coal
mines.  The  programming  approach finds a  lai^ge and  significant  positive  union/nonunion
productivity differential. This differential  is due primarily to greater congestion occurring in the
smaller nonunion mines in one sample, and to scale inefficiency in the smaller nonunion mines
in the other sample. The econometric analysis finds nearly the same union/nonunion produc-
tivity differential,  but sheds no light on the composition of, and thus the cure for, the  differ-
ential.

1.  In&'oduction

It has been su^ested  by Freeman and Medoff (1979) that the neoclassical view of
labor unions as using their monopoly power to raise wages, create resource misalloca-
tion, and thereby to decrease productivity, is too narrow and may be misleading. They
suggest that, through the provision of a collective voice mechanism, unions may reduce
turnover, increase labor quality, and have the opposite imi^ct on productivity. The net
effect  of these two contrary influences being uncertain, empirical testing is caU^  for.
Indeed a quantification ofthe union/nonunion productivity differential would seem to
be a necessary first step in the resolution of this important issue; only after the differen-
tial has been measured can effort be redirected to a search for its monopoly power/col-
lective voice roots.'

The puipose of this paper is twofold. First, we seek to bring new empirical evidence to
bear on the union/nonunion  productivity issue, by com(»ring productivity in union
and nonunion mines in U.S. surface coal mining. The data tase consists of two geolc^-
cally distinct  samples: a  1978 cross-section  of 84 midwestem  surface  mines, and an
incomplete paael of 64 western surface rams& observed over all or part ofthe  period
1975-1978 that provides a sample of size 113. In both samples we find productivity to
be higher in union  mines than  in nonunion  mines, although the composition  of the
productivity differential  is different  in the two samples. Thus we are able to document
both direction and magnitude ofthe productivity differential. In addition, we are able to

decompose the differential  into three sources to be described below. This decomposi-
tion represents an important step beyond the usual direction/m^nitude finding that
characterizes previous empirical stucUes. The significance of the decomposition lies in
its ability  to  identify  distinct  components  of  the  productivity  differential  that  may
eventually  be associated  with its monopoly  power/collective  voice roots that  would
provide an explanation for the  differential.

The second  purpose  of the  paper  is to compare  the  abilities of two very  different
research strategies to quantify  and decompose the union/nonunion  productivity  dif-
ferential.  The standard  approach  is to use econometric techniques to estimate a sto-
chastic parametric production  function,  typically Cobb-Douglas, and to calculate the
elasticity of unionization on output per unit of labor. This approach sheds light on the
magnitude,  but  not  the composition,  of the productivity  differential.  An  altemative
approach  is to use mathematical  programming techniques to bound, or envelop, the
data with a nonstochastic nonparametric production frontier. This permits a compari-
son of the productivity of each establishment and a decomposition  of measured pro-
ductivity  into technical,  scale, and  congestion  components.^ This approach  has the
distinct advantage of providing a nonparametric representation of production technol-
ogy, the structure of which is determined by weak regularity conditions and by the data
rather than by the investigator's choice of parametric form. Consequently it minimizes
the likelihood that any union/nonunion productivity differential will be masked by the
effects  of specification  error. The decomposition  of measured productivity also  offers
the hope of associating observed union/nonunion  productivity differentials  with im-
portant characteristics of production technology, and hence of providing guidance to
management  searching  for  ways to enhance  productivity  in  each of the three  union
contexts. The chief drawback of the nonparametric approach is that it is deterministic,
with no allowance being made for noise and measurement error. Note, however, that
the  strengths  of  the  programming  approach  are  the weaknesses  of  the  econometric
approach,  and  conversely.  This  makes a  comparison  of the findings of the two ap-
proaches of some  interest  from  a  methodological  standpoint.  From  an  institutional
standpoint,  confidence  in  any  union/nonunion  productivity  differential finding de-
pends on how closely the findings of two such disparate approaches agree.

The paper is or^razsd  as follows. In §2 the theoretical underpinnings and the model-
ling  framework  of  the  econometric  approach  are reviewed. In  §3 the  programming
approach and  performance  measures are summarized.  The coal mining data are de-
scribed in §4. The empirical findings of both the programming and the econometric
approaches are presented and compared in §5. §6 concludes.

2.  The Econometric Apprmich

Since the influential  work of Brown and  Medoff  (1978), virtually aU econometric
tests of the union/nonunion productivity differential have been based on the following
model. Let production technolc^ be represented by the parametric production  func-
tion

(2.1)
where  Q  is  output,  K  is  capital,  L« and  £„  are  nonunion  labor  and  union  labor,

'', 

^ The envelopment and productivity measurement stages of this a^Hoach have been cdled "data envelop-
ment analysis" (DEA) by Chames, Cooper and their associates. See Oiames and Ox^jer (1985) for a »irvey
and selective bibliography.  The decomposition  stage of this ajqjroach is not typicaUy a part of DEA; it is a
logical extensimi  intencted to  characterize productivity scores in terms of the ^ructure (rf production tech-
nology.

respectively, A  > 0, 0 < a  <  1, and /9 S  1  is a parameter reflecting  the productivity
differential  between L« and L,. Next rewrite (2.1) as

Q = <t,{K, Ln, Lu) = AK-L'-^l  + (/3 -  DP]'-", 

(2.2)

where I,  = £„ + £„ is total employed labor and P = LJL 
employment. Dividing both sides of (2.2) by L and taking natural logarithms gives

is the union  share in total

(2.3)
Applying the approximation relation In (1 + z) s  z to the last term on the right side of
(2.3) yields

l n ( ( 2 / L ) s l n^  + «ln(A:/L) + (l  - a ) ( / 3-  l)P, 

(2.4)

which is the core of the equation estimated by Brown and Medoff and by many others.
The hypothesis of interest is /8 =  1  (no union productivity effect) against the two-sided
alternative  j8 <  1 (a  negative  union  productivity  effect)  or /3 >  1 (a  positive  union
productivity  effect).

There are difficulties with (2.4) as a model for estimating union productivity  effects.
First, the accuracy of the approximation of In [1 + (/S -  l)P] with [((8 -  l)P] deterio-
rates as (8 diverges from  unity. Thus the larger is the union productivity effect in either
direction, the larger is the approximation  error. Second, the Cobb-Douglas  specifica-
tion restricts the elasticity of input substitution to unity, and so prejudges the ability of
producers to substitute away from  higher-priced  union labor, and consequently con-
strains the ability of the model to track the true productivity effect. Third, production is
assumed to be efficient  regardless of the extent of unionization, and this precludes the
exploration  of frequently  hypothesized  relationships  such as the contradictory  aigu-
ments that unions create costly x-inefficiency,  or that costly unions shock management
into reducing x-ineflBciency. Fourth, no decomposition of the productivity  differential
is provided.

All four of these difficulties can be addressed simultaneously. The next section shows
how to accomplish this task, by constructing a nonparametric production frontier  for
use as a standard against which to compute productivity across establishments having
different  union status. The use of a frontier allows for a decomposition of productivity
into different  types of efficiency,  and  the use of a  nonparametric  frontier  solves the
functional  form and approximation error difficulties.

3.  The Nonparametric Approach

In this section we give a short description of the sequence of nonparametric models
that we use. For a more complete discussion, see Fare, Grosskopf and  Lovell (1985)
and Grosskopf( 1986).

Assume there are k ratablishments, each producing a single output, u, using n inputs

x = (xuX2,...,  Xn). Denote the(kX  1) vector of observed outputs by Jh., and denote
the (k  X n)  matrix  of observed  inputs by N.  The research strategy is to construct  a
sequence of* nonparametric frontier technolc^es of increasing generality which bound
the data (M,  J»f) more and more closely. Linear pn^amming techniques are uaxi to
construct these fi-ontier technologic, and to calculate the productivity of each estab-
lishment relative to each technology. Relationships among the productivity  measures
establish the sources of productivity differentials across establishments. Com(»risons of
productivity measures across union and nonunion establishments then provide t^ts  of
the union-productivity hypothesis.^

' It s  not necesary ttat ^taMishments be aaegpdzed as either union or nonunion. The technique allows

tfie  union vmkAOe to be "pocent nnkmixed" as well, in whidi case rankings of establishments by |»oductivity
Mid by percent unionized can be compared.

productivity relative to this technology [K(u,x)]  is calculated by solving the program-
ming problem

K{u,x)  = mine 

(3.1)
The data are next enveloped with a slightly less restrictive technology, one satisfying
nonincreasing returns to scale (NIRS)* and SDL The measure of productivity relative

From the preceding discussion it is clear that S(u,x)^ 
I *=*K(u,
x)  =  W{u,  x) <=»  the  technology  exhibits  CRS at (u, x). It also  follows  from  the
preceding discussion that the nature of scale inefficiency  can be discovered by compar-
ing Kiu,  x) and  W*{u,  x). Thus if 5(M, X) < 1  and K{u,  x) = W*(u,  x), then the
technology exhibits increasing retums to scale (IRS) at (M, JC), while if 5(M, x) <  1 and
lV*(u,  x),  then the technology exhibits decreasing retums to scale (DRS) at
K{u,x)< 
{u,x).

The data are now enveloped with the least restrictive technology, one satisfying VRS
and weak disposability  of inputs (WDI).* The measure of efficiency  relative to this
technology [P(u,x)]  is calculated by solving the programming problem

P{u,x)  = mine 

s.t 

(T.l),(T.2(ii)),(T.3(iii)). 

(3.5)

It is now possible to derive a measure of congestion, which measures lost output due
to a lack of SDL Congestion occurs when an increase in the employment of a proper
subset  of  inputs,  holding  constant  the  employment  of all  other  inputs, generates a
reduction in output.' The measure of congestion [C{u, x)]  is given by

C{u,x)=Wiu,x)/P(u,x). 

(3.6)

It is clear  that  C{u,  x) ^  1, and  that  C(M, x) =  1 *=» W(u,  x) = P(u,  x) *»»  the
technology exhibits SDI at{u,x).  Moreover, it is possible to determine the source of
congestion, that is, to identify  the proper subset of inputs that creates congestion, if it
exists. Identification of the set of smallest fully congesting subsets of inputs proceeds as
follows. Let J' and J'hea  partition of the set / ={ 1,...,«} of inputs into two parts and
let x', x' and J^', JV* be the induced partitions of x and J^. Then compute

W'{u,x)  = mine 

s.t 

(T.I), (T.2(iii)), (T.2(iv)),(T.3(iii)).  (3.7)

If  W{u, x) =  W(u,  x) < P(u,  x), we say  that  J" = (J\J') 
is a fully  congesting
subvector. Moreover, if no proper nonempty subset of/"  is fully  congesting, then we
call the set J' a minimal fully congesting subset of inputs. The set of all minimal fully
congesting subsets (not  including the empty  set), is denoted  CJ, and  CJ is used to
identify  inputs responsible for congestion.

Finally, the measure of productivity relative to the most restrictive technology, the

CRS-SDI technology, decomposes as

K{u,x)  = Fiu,  x)-  5(w, x)•  C(u,  JC). 

(3.8)

Thus Ki u, x) is the product of technical efficiency relative to the VRS-WDI t«:hnology
[P{u, JC)], scale efficiency  [S{u,  x)],  and congestion  [C(u,  JC)]. The nature of scale
inefficiency  is determined  from  (3.4), and  the  source of congestion  is identified  by
means of (3.7).

' WDI means that if (u, x) belongs to the technology, so does («, Xx) for X £ 1. Maiginal physical products

can be n^ative, isoquants can have backward-doping s^ments, and the techncrfogy can contain "unecono-
mic" regions. However the size of these regions is limited by the ray monotonicity nature of WDI.

' Formal treatments of congestion can be found in FBre and Svensson (1980) and FJIre and Grosski^f

4.  The Coal Mining Data

The individual surface mine establishment data used to calculate and decompose the
productivity measures are obtained from  a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) annual
survey sent to all mining operations producing at least  1,O(X) short tons of coal during
the year.'" The data are comprised of two geologically distinct samples: a  1978 cross-
section  of 84 Interior surface  mines and an incomplete panel of 64 Western  surface
mines observed  over the period  1975-1978  that  provides a sample of size  113. The
samples include all surface mines responding to the EXDE survey for which the union
status of the mine's employees was known. "'^ A three-way classification  is employed:
nonunionized, unionized but not affiliated  with the United Mine Workers of America
(UMWA),  and  unionized  with  the  UMWA  affiliation.  This  classification  allows  a
comparison  of the productivity of nonunion  and union mines, and an analysis of the
productivity of UMWA and non-UMWA union mines. Table 1  provides a description
of the two samples based on the union status classification.

The Interior and West samples are not pooled in the empirical analysis, so that the
productivity of individual mines is calculated relative to sampled mines in that region
only. The reason for not pooling is that natural (geologic and topographic) conditions
and the technology of surface  mining vary with geographic location. Surface  mining
involves three procedures: (1) removal of overburden, the earth covering coal seams,
using bulldozers, power shovels, wheel excavators and  draglines; (2)  coal extraction
using drills,  power  shovels,  front-end  loaders and  trucks; and  (3)  land  reclamation
using bulldozers, motor graders and carry-all scrapers. In the West, where seams are
relatively  thick, and the amount of overburden that must be removed is relatively small
compared to the amount of coal uncovered, open-pit mining is employed. Area-mining
is the principal  method  employed  in the Interior, where rolling terrain  covers seams
that  are  thin  and  deep  relative  to  those  in  the  West.  The  more  favorable  natural
conditions in the West contribute to higher productivity there. Consequently the sepa-
rate contributions of nature and union status to productivity can best be disentan^ed
by keeping the two samples separate.''

Descriptive statistics by region and union status are compiled in Table 2. The output
variable (TOTPROD) has a much smaller mean value in the Interior than in the West.
The mean values of the labor input (MINERHOUR), however, are fairly similar. The
next six variables are the capital inputs. Since the ^uipment used to remove and return
the overburden varies markedly by earth moving capacity, the first four capital inputs
are  constructed  on  that  basis.  Earth  moving  capacity  is  dir^rtly  related  to  bucket
capacity, which is the basis used to distinguish four sizes, with PSDLl  the number of

'° DOE  Form  EIA-7,  "Bituminous  Coal  and  Lignite  Production  and  Mine  Operation."  This  survey  is
comprehensive;  in  1978  respondents  to the  survey  accounted  for  approximately  90  percent  of  total  U.S.
tonnage.

'' The terms "Interior" and "West" refer to the two samites, and are two of the three major coal producing
r^ons  of the U.S. The Interior sample includes surface  mines located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas,  Kentucky,  Missouri,  Oklahoma  and  Texas.  The  West  sam{rie  includes  sur&ce  mines  located  in
Alaska,  Arizona,  Colorado,  Montana,  New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  W a ^ n ^ on  and  Wyoming  (Utah  is
excluded because all of its mines are underground mines). Deep minir^ isedominates in the third producing
r^on,  Appalachia.  Institutional,  technoli^cal  and regulatory details are availaUe in Zimmerman  (1981).
See also Byrnes, Fire and Grosskc^f (1984) for a nonparametric analysis of a small sample of Illinois strip
mines not dassified by union status.

'^ The union status of a mine is not a^ed on DOE Form EIA-7. It is based on the U.S. Department of Labor
Mine  Safety  and  Health  Administration  mine  iaspeisac's  knowledge  of  the  union  statiu  of  the  mine's
emirioyees. In some raises it is assumed tiiat if a company is unioni^d alt mines (^jer^ed by that company are
unionized. For more on unions in «irbce mining see Zimmtxtiaa 

(1981) and Navarro (1983).

'^ The nature of tfw product is different, too. Cod mined in the IntniOT tends to have rdativeiy h^  sulfur

and BTU omtent, wherras coal mined in the Wet  has rdatively low sulfiir and BTU  content

small power shovels and  draglines, and  PSDL2-PSDL4  the  number of lai^er power
shovels and draglines, with PSDL4 the largest category. Two other capital variables are
employed: DRILLS (the number of drills, front end loaders, and brooms weighted by
value) and  RECCAP (the  number  of scrapers, bulldozers, and  graders weighted  by
value). These describe the equipment used to remove coal and to reclaim mined areas,
respectively. Based on the mean values of these variables, it is clear that Western mines
are more productive; mines in the Interior use virtually the same amount of labor and
(with the possible exception of PSDL3) more capital to mine less coal. This productiv-
ity differential is attributable in part to re^onal differences in natural conditions, which
are described in Table 2 by the thickness of the coal seams mined (BEDTHICK) and by
the inverse of the amount of overburden removed (DEPTH ""')•''*

Table 2 also shows substantial  variation  with  re^ject  to  union  status within  each
sample. In the Interior, union  mines produce more coal than nonunion mines, using
more labor and  more of  most types of capital.  Union  mines also have thicker coal
seams, and more overburden  to remove to reach those thicker seams. The pattern is
similar in the West, where union  mines use more labor and  more of most types of
capital to produce more coal. They also remove more overburden to reach thicker coal
seams. '* Two important  features emeige from an intra-sample comparison by union
status. Union mines are larger than nonunion mines, and union mines face  different,
but  neither  more  nor  less favorable,  natural  conditions  than  nonunion  mines. This

"  DEPTH"' is used inaead of DEPTH so that both natural condition vmables are poatively related to
output  Unfortunately  ttese  two natural  amdition  variables are  not directly  cranparable %:ross the two
samples because of diferences in units of measurement for both variables. See TaUe 2.

'' Variation in the mean value at BEDTHICK across tte three union status grcmps is statistic^y signiiicant

in both sam{des. Variation in the mean value of DEPTH'' is not statistically sagnificant in either sample.

makes  it  unlikely  that  any  observed  productivity  differentials  across union  status
groups are the result of variation  in  natural conditions. This likelihood  is, however,
explored further below.

5.  Empirical  Results

The basic issue is whether mines employing union labor operate more productively
than mines employing nonunion labor, and whether mines affiliated  with the UMWA
are more or less productive than mines having other union affiliations. In addition, the
nonparametric  method  disaggregates  productivity  into  distinct  components,  and  so
allows  the  exploration  of  specific  hypotheses  concerning  each  component,  such  as
whether  unionization  "shocks"  management  into  reducing  technical  inefficiency,
whether union  mines are more scale efficient  than  the smaUer nonunion  mines, and
whether and for what reasons union mines are less congested than nonunion mines.

A.  The Nonparametric Approach

The first step is to  calculate  the  six performance  measures  developed  in  §3. The
measures are calculated for the Interior and West samples separately, so as to allow the
two samples to have different  frontier  technologies. '* Within each sample each of the
six performance measures is calculated for every mine, although to conserve space only
means and standard deviations are displayed in Table 3. The first column contains the
composite productivity measure K{ u, x).  In the Interior sample variation in composite
productivity across the three union status groups is statistically significant, with highest
mean  productivity  occurring  in  mines  with  non-UMWA  union  labor,  followed  by
UMWA  mines."  Moreover,  19 of  23  mines  having  productivity  scores  of  0.80  or
higher are union  mines. For the sample as a whole, mean composite  productivity  is
about 0.61, which suggests that nearly 40 percent of potential output is lost to  ineffi-
ciency of one kind or another. The decomposition oiK{u,  x)  into its S(u,  x),  F{u,  x)
and C{u,  x)  components shows congestion to be the primary source of inefficiency  in
the Interior, although the relative importance ofthe three components varies by union
status. Technical inefficiency poses no real problem for any union status group, and the
uniformly high values of technical efficiency surest that unionization of Interior mines
has neither created slack nor shocked management into reducing x-inefficiency.  Scale
inefficiency  is serious only for nonunion mines, while congestion is a problem at both
nonunion and UMWA mines.

Union mines also have higher mean values of composite productivity than nonunion
mines in the West sample, but with UMWA mines being more productive than other
union mines. Thirty-three of 35 mines having productivity scores of 0.80 or higher are

'^ A criticism frequently raised against (parametric or nonpanunebic) nonstochastic frontier models is that
their structure, and any resulting inferences, are particularly sensitive to the existence of ostensibly productive
outliers in the data base. This criticism  is valid in principle, and so both  samples have been searched  for
productive outliers. None have turned  up; in each samide fully  20 percent of all mines appear in a basic
solution at least once (i.e., have a composite productivity rating of 1.0). If this percentage were substantially
smaller, say 5% or less, there might be cause for concern  that the empirical  results were being adversely
influenced  by a small number of outliers that might contain measurement error. In this event chance-con-
strained  programming techniques of Chames and Cooper (1959) might be iqiplied as a sort of sensitivity
experiment. However a number as ^rgfi as 20% makes diis tedmique inadvisable.

"  Significance of variation in any performance measure by union status is ev^uated usii% three tests. The
first  test is an analysis of variance that compares union status groups on the basis ofthe within-group and the
among-group variation in performance. The second test compares union status groups on the basis of their
central  tendency,  as measured  by  the  median.  The third  te^  is a  Kniskal-Wallis test  that  compares the
aructure ofthe distributions ofperformanceacroK  union status groups. AH three tests are significant for all 12
union status comparisons, with tte exception ofF(u,  x) in the Interior and S{u, x)  in tiie W«t. Details are

union  mines. The  mean  composite efficiency  loss for  the West sample as a whole is
virtually the same as for the Interior sample, and congestion remains the major source
of efficiency loss, particularly among nonunion mines. Scale efficiency does npt vary by
union status, and poses no problem. Technical efficiency does vary by union status, and
poses no serious problem only at UMWA mines, suggesting that the shock effect  that
was missing in the Interior exists in the West.

Since  congestion  is  the  major  source  of  output  loss  in  both  samples,  and  of  the
union/nonunion productivity differential  in the West, the source of that congestion is
of considerable  interest.  The method  described  in  §3 is used to  isolate the  set of all
minimal  fully  congesting  suteets  of  inputs  which  could  account  for  the  degree  of
congestion calculated in the C{u,x)  measure for each mine. In Table 4 the number of
mines in which any individual input appears in the set of all minimal fully congesting
subsets is tabulated. The two inputs that appear most frequently  are the coal removal

and  reclamation  variables, DRILLS and  RECCAP. The lumpiness of these variables
accounts for some of the congestion in both samples. Since small mines are more likely
to experience lumpiness, this source of congestion is likely to be more severe in non-
union  mines than  in  large  union  mines.  Moreover  the  land  reclamation  activity  is
mandated by f^eral  and state legislation, and makes little or no contribution to coal
production.  This  makes  it  very  likely  that  RECCAP,  and  any  other  input  used  in
conjunction  with  RECCAP, will appear  frequently  in the set of minimal  congesting
suteets of inputs. One of these  inputs is labor,  which  is employed  in virtually fixed
proportions with the heavy machinery constituting RECCAP. And with only one ex-
ception, UMWA mines in the West, RECCAP and MINERHOUR congest together. A
second reason for the appearance of labor in the set of minimal congesting subsets of
inputs is the  need to comply with mine safety regulations, such compliance being a very
labor-intensive activity for all three union status groups.

For the Interior sample it is deviation  from  optimal scale that is the major compo-
nent of the union/nonunion  productivity differential.  The method described in §3 is
used to determine whether each mine in both  samples operates under conditions of
increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale. A summary of these resxilts, indicat-
ing the  frequency  with  which  increasing,  constant  or  decreasing  returns  to  scale is
ol^erved  in each sample, appears in Table  S. In the Interior sample most  nonunion
mines operate in the region of increasing returns to scale, whereas union mines operate
much  more  frequently  in  the  region  of  nonincreasing  returns to  scale. In  the  West
sample,  where  somewhat  less  scale  inefficiency  exists,  no  such  pattern  appears.  It
follows that the union/nonunion productivity differential  in the Interior sample is due
largely to the preponderance of inefficiently  small nonunion mines.

Union mines are more productive than nonunion mines. This differential  has been
attributed to union mines being less congested in the West sample, and to union mines
being more scale-efficient in the Interior sample. However in both samples union mines
are  endowed  with  significantly  thicker  coal  seams located  beneath  insignificantly
greater  amounts of overburden.  Although natural  conditions do not  unambiguously
favor union mines, it is nonetheless possible that a portion of the observed union/non-
union productivity differential  is of geological origin. The problem is to disentangle the
separate influences of union status and natural conditions on productivity.

The proUem is resolved by r^ressing each of the six calculated efficiency  measures
against the two natural condition variables and a pair of union status dummy variables

heavily influenced  by union status. The estimated coefficient  of the  union/nonunion
dummy  variable  Ul  is consistently  negative  and  significant  in  both  samples.  The
estimated  coefficient  of the  UMWA/other  dummy  variable  f/2  is negative  in  the
Interior sample, positive in the West sample, and significant roughly half of the time. In
both  sign  and  magnitude  these  union  status coefficients  are entirely  consistent  with
earlier findings that ignored natural conditions. Consequently, controlling for the  ef-
fects  of  natural  conditions  serves to reinforce earlier  conclusions.  Union  mines are
more productive than nonunion mines. This difference is statistically s^ificant, and it
is in no way dependent upon more favorable natural conditions.

B.  The Econometric Approach

The findings based on the nonparametric approach are largely corroborated by simi-
lar findings based on the econometric approach. We implement the econometric ap-
proach by ^timating regression models of the form
In (Q/L)i  = In ^  + a,  In (K/L),  + aj In L, + aj In BEDTHICK,

separately for each sample. The capital variable A^ is a value-weighted sum of tiie six
capital inpute, and all other variables are as iwevioudy defined. '* R^ression results are

displayed in Table 8. The results are not very powerful in terms of goodness-of-fit,  but
the parameter estimates do show the positive effect of unionization on productivity. In
the Interior sample the estimated  coefficients  of both  union dummies are consistent
with the findings ofthe  nonparametric analysis summarized in Tables 3 and 6. In the
West  sample  the  estimated  coefficient  of  U\  is  consistent  with  the  nonparametric
analysis of Tables 3 and 7, but the estimated coefficient  of Ul is not."

The conclusion ofthe  parametric analysis is that unionized mines without UMWA
affiliation  are more productive than unionized mines having UMWA affiliation, which
in turn  are  more productive  than  non-unionized  mines. These  findings  are  broadly
consistent  with  those  of  the  nonparametric  analysis  in  three  of  four  comparisons,
despite the fact that they are based on a Cobb-Douglas description of technology that
assumes the presence of SDI and the absence of VRS, and that imposes a greater degree
of input substitutability than may exist in surface mining. This robustness of findings to
variations in assumptions conceming the structure of technology is impressive.

6.  Concloding Remarks

The purpose of this study has been to compare the abilities of two different analytical
techniques to shed light on the union/nonunion  productivity differential  in U.S. sur-
face coal mining. The industry is of particular inter^t because ofthe diversity of union
status  among  mines,  some  mines  having  collective  bargaining  ^reements  with  the
UMWA, others with a number of other unions, and still others having no collective
bargaining agreement with any union. This diversity of bargaining scenarios enhances
the opportunity  to  identify  any  union/nonunion  productivity  differentials  that  may
exist. A comparison  of the two analytical  tedmiques  is of inter^t  because they  are
typically  viewed as competitors with different  and  lai]gely complementary  strengths.

"In tte Interior sam|4e the imiriied c^ree (rf*homogeneity (1.09) is consistent with the nonparametric

r«iiits of Tables 3 and 5. In the West sami^ tte imjdied degree (tf homc^endty (0,44) is too far below unity
to be consstent  with tte  nonparametric  results, and tte  coefficient  of the DEPTH ~' vari:d>ie has the

The mathematical  programming techniques featured  in this study have the virtues of
being nonparametric, and thus highly flexible, and of being able to quantify  and de-
compose productivity and its variation by union status. The decomposition property is
particularly attractive since it provides guidance in the search for the sources of produc-
tivity  variation.  The econometric  techniques employed  in  this  study  suffer  from  an
inflexible  parametric representation of technology that restricts our ability to decom-
pose productivity differentials, but they have the important advantage of accommodat-
ing noise in the economic data being analyzed.

The  mathematical  programming  techniques  reveal  a  large and  significant  union/
nonunion  productivity  differential.  In the Interior sample most of this differential  is
attributed to scale inefficiency  in the smaller nonunion mines. In the West sample the
bulk of the differential is attributed to greater congestion occurring in the smaller, more
labor-intensive, nonunion mines. These mines are much more likely to experience the
lumpiness of the capital variable, and they are also more likely to be pushed into the
"uneconomic region" of production by the input requirements of safety and environ-
mental  legislation.  Even  though  this  legislation  is  directed  at  all  mines,  its  impact
appears to be most severe in small nonunion mines. ^° In neither sample is the existence
or the magnitude of the productivity differential  dependent  upon different  geological
conditions that exist in the two types of mines.

The conclusion of the econometric analysis is that non-UMWA union mines are the
most productive, followed in order by UMWA mines and nonunion mines. This  find-
ing is broadly consistent with the finding of the mathematical programming analysis,
and inspires confidence in the general conclusion regarding union/nonunion  produc-
tivity differentials in U.S. surface coal mining. Despite this broad consistency, however,
the econometric approach is incapable of providing a decomposition of the productiv-
ity  differential  into  its  technical,  scale and  congestion  components  without  using a
more flexible parametric form to represent production technology. This is in our view
the main weakness of the econometric approach.

Two additional studies that would be of considerable value are unfortunately  ruled
out  by a  lack  of appropriate  data  at the  level  of the  individual  mine. The first is a
comparison of output per unit of input (or per unit of labor) and wages across the three
union status groups. The second is a comparison of costs and/or profits across the three
union status groups. Both nonparametric and econometric techniques have been devel-
oped  for  this  purpose,  but  for  our  two  samples  the  requisite  input  price  data  are
unavailable.^'

^  Our  inefficiency  scores,  and  particulariy  their congestion  components,  may  appear  to  be  implausibly
large, but two related findings of Neumann and Nelson (1982) may put our findings in perspective. Neumann
and Nelson investigated the effects of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of  1969 on a sample of laiige and
smalt underground mines. They find that compliance with the Act led to a  13% decline in labor productivity,
and  that  the  impact  was  much  more  severe  in  small  mines  than  in  large  mines.  In  addition,  in  private
correspondence,  an  environmental  impact  engineer with  Freeman  United  Coal Company,  a subsidiary  of
General  Dynamics,  acknowlec^ed  that  the  productivity  scores  reported  here  were  quite  reasonable.  He
attributes the low scores, and the low congestion scores in particular, to the dramatic effects of environmental
and safety  r^ulation.  Still further documentation  of the deleterious effects of r%ulation  on productivity  in
coal mining can be found in Harris (1985) and Nelson (1983),
