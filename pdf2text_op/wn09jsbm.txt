The Impact of Knowledge Resources on New
Venture Performance
by G. Page West III and Terry W. Noel

A new venture’s strategy—and thus its performance—is based upon the knowledge
the ﬁrm has about its market, its opportunity in that market, and its appropriate
conduct to take advantage of that opportunity. Resource-based theory underscores
knowledge as a type of resource that confers competitive advantage and the potential
for sustainability, two factors that are critical for start-ups. Three types of procedural
knowledge are considered to be important at start-up: (1) about the industry in which
the venture competes; (2) about the type of business approach the venture is pursuing;
and (3) about creating, building, and harvesting new ventures. Knowledge useful to
the new venture is developed either through relevant personal experiences or by
accessing relevant knowledge possessed by others. Hypotheses are developed regarding
the impact on the performance of new ventures as a result of these sources of
knowledge, and these relationships are explored in a study of new technology-based
ﬁrms.

Introduction

In order to be successful, new ven-
tures need various types of resources,
including ﬁnancial, social, technological,
physical, and human resources (Brush,
Greene, and Hart 2001; Lichtenstein and
Brush 2001; Greene and Brown 1997). It
has been suggested that local communi-

ties can assist start-ups in their provision
of such resources (e.g., Malecki 1997).
However,
the historical context and
unique characteristics of communities
that actively support entrepreneurship
lead to inconsistent ﬁndings
about
the importance of community-assisted
resource development. New venture
founders must often acquire or develop

resources independent of those provided
at the community level. This is largely
because the resource needs of each new
venture are idiosyncratic (Lichtenstein
and Brush 2001), even when they are
started up in the same geographic loca-
tion by the same founders
(Brush,
Greene, and Hart 2001).

and Busenitz

According to the resource-based view
of
the ﬁrm, higher performance may
result from idiosyncratic resource posi-
tions in new ﬁrms (Alvarez and Barney
2004; Alvarez
2001;
Penrose 1959). Typically, these resource
positions are internally developed as
opposed to externally procured. The
resource view provides the conceptual
means to understand how a new venture
may insulate itself from competition, but
it is not particularly helpful in providing
guidance on the proper sequencing or
staging of resource development efforts.
Thus, a growing body of research seeks
to identify ways in which new ventures
develop or accumulate resources (Haber
and Reichel 2007; Lichtenstein and Brush
2001), which types of resources are rela-
tively more valuable than others, and at
what stage of venture development must
certain resources be in place (Gilbert,
McDougall, and Audretsch 2006; Baker
and Nelson 2005).

type of

The present article focuses on a
particular
resource in new
ventures—knowledge. Knowledge re-
sources include the understanding of
how to start up new organizations, how
to manage people and processes, how to
attain growth and competitive position,
and how to stage technology and new
product development
(Brush, Greene,
and Hart 2001; Wiklund and Shepherd
2003). They are critical in new ventures

because they are the ﬁrst
type of
resource that any successful new venture
accumulates. Both Schumpeter
(1934)
and Penrose (1959) characterized entre-
preneurship, or entrepreneurial manage-
ment, as the understanding of new
possibilities. Before a new venture
begins to hire staff, purchase equipment,
create alliances, or sell its products or
services,
the founders must have a
rationale or logic in mind for taking
these steps. The founders will have
developed some understanding of the
opportunity space for a competitive posi-
tion in the marketplace that ultimately
leads to such actions.1 Likewise, before
new venture founders begin to seek or
develop additional resources that will
facilitate going to market or provide
competitive insulation, they must have
some understanding of the types and
conﬁgurations of
the
opportunity calls for. Thus, new ventures
rely on whatever knowledge resources
are brought to the table by the founders
(Brush, Greene, and Hart 2001). In con-
trast, a “shoot ﬁrst, aim later” approach,
taking actions without sufﬁcient knowl-
edge about an opportunity, often results
in misdirection and a waste of resources.
Many of the dot.com start-ups of the late
1990s and early 2000s suffered this fate.
knowledge

its inception also lays a
foundation for the new venture’s sustain-
ability. Having accumulated knowledge
through their own idiosyncratic experi-
ences and processes, founders will have
a unique view of opportunity in the
market that cannot be appropriated by
potential competitors. Thus, knowledge
can be described using the language of
the resource-based view—such as rare,

in the market (e.g., Shane and

nature (Gartner, Carter, and Hills 2003). In either case, the ability of individuals to ﬁnd new
ventures depends on prior knowledge or appreciation of the competitive context so that they
can discern new opportunity when others would not.

between new venture performance and
types of knowledge that come into play
in the start-up process. Three types of
procedural knowledge2 are important
(Wiklund and Shepherd 2003): knowl-
edge about
the industry, knowledge
about the type of business, and knowl-
edge about starting up new ventures.
The ﬁrst two are peculiar to a particular
industry or business type, whereas the
latter is applicable to a wide variety of
businesses. These types of knowledge
are derived from different sources. We
investigate the relationship between
knowledge sources and new venture
performance in a study of technology-
based ﬁrms where,
in the face of
dynamically changing competitive cir-
cumstances, relevant knowledge devel-
opment may be particularly challenging.
The study yields unexpected ﬁndings
about the sources of knowledge and the
strength of the knowledge–performance
relationship.

Resource-Based View and
Knowledge in New
Ventures

The

view of

the ﬁrm
attempts to deﬁne fundamental factors
within organizations that create sustain-
able competitive advantage (Dierickx
and Cool 1989; Barney 1986; Wernerfelt
1984; Penrose 1959). Wernerfelt (1984)
describes resource strengths tied semi-
permanently to ﬁrms and equates sus-

it

the possibility of

tainable advantage with the creation of
resource position barriers. Critical to the
theory is the assumption that resources
are heterogeneous among ﬁrms and that
competitive advantage depends upon
that heterogeneity. The most
impor-
tant characteristic of a resource that af-
competitive
fords
advantage—that
is valuable (Barney
2001)—speaks to the essential ﬁt that
must exist between the type of resource
and the competitive context in which the
ﬁrm ﬁnds itself. As ﬁrms confront ever-
changing contexts, their resource posi-
tions must dynamically develop to ﬁt the
situation. This is consistent with the way
we think about sustainable competitive
advantage in new ventures. New ven-
tures seek to carve out unique positions
that are not assailable by incumbents or
imitable by other new ventures. And as
their circumstances change (e.g.,
life
cycle stage changes or the advent of new
competition), they must seek to create
the proper resource ﬁt with the circum-
stances (Chandler and Hanks 1994).

Most research about resource-based
theory has focused on large, established
ﬁrms, where the challenges of resource
acquisition and development are signiﬁ-
cantly different—both quantitatively and
qualitatively—from what occurs in new
ventures. West and DeCastro (2001)
point out the unique enigma that the
new venture faces in somehow moving
from a position of zero resources to
possession of competitively insulating
resources. Few new ventures spring into
action with a fully developed resource of
any variety (ﬁnancial, human, organiza-
tional,
technological, etc.), much less
an entire set of complementary re-
sources. New ventures come into being
as only the crystallization of an idea

2Procedural knowledge is the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task and cannot
be easily articulated by the individual as it typically involves tacit dimensions. It is the
knowledge of how something works and how (or especially how best) to perform some task

ﬁnancial

Recently,

researchers have turned
their attention to the question of how
new ventures develop resource posi-
tions, but these studies have signiﬁcant
limitations. For example, some studies
examine the relationship between new
venture performance and ﬁrm resources
(Haber and
such as human capital
capital
Reichel
(Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon,
and Woo
1994) without attention to how or where
those resource positions were devel-
oped. Other studies have begun to look
more carefully at the process of attract-
ing and acquiring resources in new
ventures (Brush, Greene, and Hart 2001;
Lichtenstein and Brush 2001), but these
are qualitative case studies examining a
small number of ﬁrms well beyond the
start-up phase. Lastly,
studies often
gauge performance with absolute mea-
sures such as survival or sales growth
(Delmar and Shane 2006), whereas the
resource-based view addresses perfor-
mance relative to competition.

A perspective ﬁnding currency within
the resource-based view is that a ﬁrm’s
competitive advantage arises from mana-
gerial knowledge. Penrose (1959) explic-
itly mentions entrepreneurial capabilities
of management as key to understanding
how the ﬁrm attains growth and com-
petitive position. Management’s key role
is to identify and evaluate resources
(Barney 1991), and then decide which
resources to invest in and how to utilize
them (Castanias and Helfat 1991). To the
extent that managers are more adept in
organizing and integrating underlying
resources, ﬁrms will be able to compete
more effectively (Kogut and Zander
1992).
such as
human capital (Amit and Schoemaker
1993), routines, and knowledge (Grant
1996) have been linked to enhanced ﬁrm
performance. Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon,

and Woo (1994) link relevant knowledge
to new venture survival or failure. More
recently, Alvarez and Busenitz (2001)
describe entrepreneurial knowledge as

to obtain . . . resources” (p. 762), hetero-
geneously organized to create and take
advantage of opportunity.

managerial capabilities, organizing prin-

fundamentally refer to different

of managerial or entrepreneurial knowl-

argues, entrepreneurs must know how
to integrate scientiﬁc knowledge, facts,
and management techniques with con-
textual experience. Knowledge about
how to manage the complex array of
activities involved in a start-up is a type
of procedural knowledge that represents
a signiﬁcant

In studying technology ﬁrms, Ranft and
Lord (2000) describe employee skills,
managerial systems, and processes as
socially
knowledge-based
capabilities that exist at the core of the
ﬁrms. Similarly, innovative entrepreneur-
ship has been characterized by the
complexity and tacitness of knowledge
that is central to the process (Zander and
Kogut 1995).

Knowledge resources are seminal for
new ventures,
for two reasons. First,
knowledge resources provide the initial
foundation for competitive advantage. At
the outset, an entrepreneur possesses
only his or her ideas about a possible
opportunity that could lead to the found-
ing of a new venture. Through a variety
of information-processing activities, the

neur is able to investigate and reﬁne a
potential idea. The receipt of any one
new piece of qualifying information or
any one exchange with others, by itself,
is not critical
in this process. Instead,
the synthesis of all such received pieces
of information about the idea helps to
reveal
the idea’s scope and potential
in the marketplace. As the ﬁrst funda-
mental expression of
the relationship
between the market opportunity and a
new venture’s behavior, this new under-
standing thus provides
the strategic
foundation for moving forward with the
new venture idea. Moreover, the synthe-
sis is extremely idiosyncratic because
it depends on the unique constellation
of
information sources and contacts
accessed by the entrepreneur. The syn-
thetic view of the opportunity developed
then exhibits
the characteristics
described by the body of resource-based
theory (valuable, rare,
inimitable, non-
tradable, nonsubstitutable) that provide
ex ante and ex post limits to competition

Where does knowledge reside in a
start-up venture? For larger, more estab-
lished ﬁrms, knowledge may exist
in
many locations. Some of these would
include the presence of other key execu-
tives (Cross and Sproull 2004), through
formalized relationships with suppliers
and
boundary-
spanning systems and procedures. Estab-
lished organizations are also able to
make explicit (in the form of policies and
guidelines) what was previously tacit,
and routines often become established as
manifestations of knowledge about how
to most effectively conduct best practices
(Winter 1987).

New ventures, however, exist in stark
contrast to the larger incumbents in an
industry. For new ventures, it is the CEO
who wields the greatest
inﬂuence on
strategy and direction (Gilbert, McDou-

Grilli 2005; Johnson and Bishop 2002;
Morone 1993; Eisenhardt 1989). Before
the top management team has ever been
assembled, the knowledge which guides

CEO’s unique insight and understanding
about opportunity in the marketplace
that leads to the start-up of a new tech-
nology venture in the ﬁrst place. They
ordinarily have technical knowledge
based
experience,
enabling them to appreciate the interface
between what new technology can
accomplish and unmet needs in the
market. On the other hand, a technical
mindset can sometimes lead to signiﬁ-
cant organizational problems as the new
venture develops. The founder CEO may
focus myopically on the science and dis-
regard recommendations of top manag-
ers recruited to help run the business
(Meyer and Dean 1990). In addition, the
rapid pace of change in technology envi-
ronments may shorten the useful life of
previously developed technical knowl-
edge, making the management challenge
for these start-ups even greater. These
circumstances emphasize the balance
that must exist in technology-based ﬁrms
between the CEO’s technical knowledge
and managerial knowledge (whether or
not the CEO is also the founder), a point
we will return to later.

Though we recognize that new ven-
tures often involve top management
teams, we focus the remaining discus-
sion on sources of knowledge for the
founder CEO. In part, this reﬂects the
inﬂuential position, which the founder
CEO holds in any new venture (Gilbert,
McDougall, and Audretsch 2006; West
and Meyer 1998). Previous research has
suggested that the resource-based view
of new ﬁrm formation is best explored
with reference to process and activities
executed at the individual level (Newbert
2005).
Sources of Knowledge for
Founder CEOs

Research has occasionally examined a
range of characteristics thought to con-
tribute to a founder CEO’s knowledge,
but which are not
idiosyncratically
important to the new venture or appro-

priate to the speciﬁc circumstances of
the new venture. These include,
for
example, the age of the founder and the
founder’s educational background. Pre-
sumably, the older and more educated
the founder, the greater the founder’s
knowledge. Although previous research
has examined the relationship between
these types of dimensions and aspects of
new venture performance, the resource-
based view would argue that both are
characteristics shared by many other
founders and CEOs, and are therefore
neither
inimitable, nonsubstitut-
able, or nontradable. Although age and
education may be valuable founder char-
acteristics for new ventures, they could
not possibly be sources of sustainable
competitive advantage. We choose to
focus instead on types of knowledge that
might be generative of sustainable com-
petitive advantage.

There are three types of procedural

founders. The three types of knowledge
are (1) knowledge about
the speciﬁc
industry in which the new venture will
compete; (2) knowledge about the type
of strategic or business approach that the
new venture might take within the indus-
try; and (3) knowledge about creating
and starting up new ventures. On the
surface, it is not apparent that any of
these knowledge types would meet any
of the resource-based criteria. After all,
industry experience or experience with a
certain type of strategy may be reason-
ably widespread. However, past research
investigating these dimensions for new
venture CEOs have not addressed these
resource view criteria explicitly. As we
will argue, it is not simply the length of
industry or business experience that is
critical but the relatedness of that expe-
rience to the new venture that affords
uniqueness and inimitability.

There are three sources for the types
of knowledge already outlined.

larly, knowledge about starting up com-

actually participated in previous start-
ups. But knowledge about

also be developed or acquired by access-
ing other information sources, in order
to gain insights and new information

It is often assumed implicitly that the
kind of knowledge important
to new
venture success is knowledge about a
particular industry or particular kind of
business. Typically,
research which
investigates industry or business knowl-
edge of founder CEOs or their top man-
agers has focused on their years of
experience (e.g., Delmar and Shane
2006; Eisenhardt 1989). However, gross
measures of years of experience may be
misleading, especially in industries char-
acterized by fuzzy boundaries and in
which may exist broad strategic variety.
Within the
for
example the U.S. Department of Com-
merce lists 11 separate NAICS entries for
different types of software-related busi-
nesses. Even within the one designation
for
“packaged software publishers,”
there are 12 additional subcategories
representing a range covering applica-
tions
operating
systems, utilities, etc. These industry sub-
categories vary considerably in dimen-
sions that are important to new ventures,
such as size, growth, ease of entry, and
level of competition. Research that cap-
tures length of experience in the “soft-
ware
industry” will not necessarily
capture experience that is entirely rel-
evant to the new venture with which a
founder is now associated.

The same logic may be applied to
business or functional-level experience.
Length of experience managing strategy

may not adequately reﬂect the relevance
of that experience for the new venture
with which the founder is now associ-
ated. Several years ago, Pepsi CEO John
Sculley left the company to take a job
as Apple Computer’s CEO. Sculley was
renowned for his strategic accomplish-
ments over the years in the food sector,
however, that experience did not trans-
late effectively to the technology sector.
Even similar roles within highly related
types of industries might not be helpful
to the new venture. Netﬂix and Block-
buster both compete in the video rental
business;
strategic
approaches are considerably different.
Whereas Blockbuster’s
strategy has
focused on market coverage through a
that necessitates
real
driving
into
and
increasing the level of each checkout
transaction, Netﬂix has
focused on
online distribution, membership devel-
opment, a user-friendly website, and efﬁ-
cient operations. Had Netﬂix recruited a
strategy person from Blockbuster when
it started up,
that experience would
probably not have been particularly
helpful.

It makes a difference how related a
manager’s prior industry and business
experiences are to the industry of the
new venture and the type of strategic
approach the new venture must adopt.
Wiklund and Shepherd (2003) describe
procedural knowledge in new ventures
as arising from experience with similar
past situations. Others are more speciﬁc,
describing forms of “knowledge related-
ness” as constituent elements in effective
enterprise management. For example,
Chandler (1996) discovered that the simi-
larity between the “previous job or busi-
ness” and the “current venture” can be
described by two factors he called “task
environment” and “skills/abilities.” “Task
environment” refers to suppliers, com-
petitors,
suggesting
industry relatedness. “Skills and abilities”
refers to managerial duties, functional

situations. Tanriverdi and Venkatraman

employees of existing companies may
decide to become entrepreneurs, striking

that build usefully upon the speciﬁc

working in their industry and company.
Despite having gathered as much infor-
mation as possible in order to frame the
nature of the opportunity, uncertainty
still exists for any potential entrepreneur.
And so the relatedness of
their new
endeavor to their previous experiences
should be useful
in managing uncer-
tainties that remain. The entrepreneur

type of knowledge that is required for
the new venture is highly related to the
previous experience of the entrepreneur,
the venture should have a higher prob-
ability of success. On the other hand,
where an entrepreneur brings knowl-
edge to a new venture that is unrelated
to that necessary for the venture, there
should be a higher risk of failure. Thus,

requires more broadly applicable knowl-
edge about organizing something from
nothing, planning where none had been
done before, and motivating brand new
employees and stakeholders. In other
words, new venture development may
be enhanced by knowledge gained
through previous experience in new ven-
tures. This source of knowledge is illus-
trated by the case of someone who has
already been an entrepreneur creating,
building, and harvesting a business, and
who now sets out to start another busi-
ness. In this case it is reasonable to think
that knowledge about the challenges and
management issues that are peculiar to
start-ups would be useful and applicable
in the new venture setting.

Logically,

the entrepreneur or CEO
who has previous start-up experience
would understand what steps to take in
order to maximize the new venture’s
potential
(Westhead, Ucbasaran, and
Wright 2005). He or she would also
understand what pitfalls may lie ahead,
and thus, what steps not to take (e.g.,
Brush, Greene, and Hart 2001). This may
include signiﬁcant organizational prob-
lems associated with the staged develop-
ment and growth of new ventures (e.g.,
Kazanjian 1988), as well as more prag-
matic issues such as negotiating space
leases with realtors or lines of credits
with banks. The previous start-up expe-
rience of both Hawkins and Dubinski
enabled them to more easily navigate
start-up resource acquisition issues at
Handspring, such as selecting venture
capitalists and raising ﬁnancial capital.
Their previous experience at Palm also
enabled them to more easily set up new
supply chain relations and internal cus-
tomer service operations (Brush, Greene,
and Hart 2001). In the start-up of his

second new venture (Exabyte) following
the previous Storage Technology start-
up, Juan Rodriguez commented “I not
only knew what do to, I also understood
what not to do” (Rodriguez 1994).

Though intuitively appealing, pre-
vious research on this question has

that the assets of entrepreneurs exceed
their liabilities in serial start-up activity,
but that their performance is no better
than novice entrepreneurs in venture
capital–backed ﬁrms. Other studies have
pointed out
the beneﬁts of previous
start-up experience (Cowe 1998; Wright,
Robbie, and Ennew 1997a). Still others
have found previous experience to be a
detriment after radical industry changes
due to less seeking of information from
critics (Audia, Locke, and Smith 2000).

the criteria suggested
by the resource-based view. With the
growth of ﬁrst-time
entrepreneurial
start-up activity (Reynolds et al. 2000), an
ever-increasing proportion of the general
population can claim previous start-up
experience. What should make a differ-
ence in the nature of this experience
from the resource view is its depth. Serial
entrepreneurs are far more rare in the
population and the knowledge that
accrues to an individual from having par-
ticipated in several start-ups can estab-
lish a knowledge foundation that is also
valuable,
inimitable, nontradable, and
nonsubstitutable.

(e.g.,
Johannisson 2000; Dubini and
Aldrich 1991; Aldrich and Zimmer 1986;
Birley 1985). In order to resolve uncer-
tainty owners of young ﬁrms rely more
heavily on external networks than do
managers of older ﬁrms (McGee and
Sawyer 2003), which is generative of
both tacit and explicit knowledge that is
helpful for the venture (Chrisman and
McMullen 2004). Network theory places
particular importance on the connections
between different social groups as par-
ticularly salient in the diffusion of new
information (Rogers 1983; Rogers and
Kincaid 1981; Granovetter 1973). The
information beneﬁts to individuals who
bridge “structural holes” between differ-
ent network clusters (i.e., who have
strong relations with other network clus-
ters possessing very different informa-
tion) are especially valuable (Burt 1997;
Rogers and Kincaid 1981). Thus, infor-
mation networks are most valuable when
they provide access to individuals who
possess relevant knowledge that
the
entrepreneurs cannot gain through their
experiences or customary personal con-
tacts. By bridging structural holes and
communicating with members of other
groups, new and more valuable informa-
tion is provided to entrepreneurs and
this information may assist them in their
efforts to start, manage, and grow the
company.

H4: Networking activity by new venture
CEOs will bear a stronger positive
relationship to new venture perfor-
mance than will the relatedness of
industry and business
experience
or the extent of previous start-up
experience.

Method

This study was conducted among new
ventures in a region whose economy had
historically relied on traditional manufac-
turing industries. A total of 177 start-up
ﬁrms were identiﬁed through the local
chambers of commerce, local entrepre-
neurship networking organizations, and
Dun & Bradstreet as being in information
technology, biotechnology, and medical
or pharmaceutical technology areas. We
elected to focus on technology-based
new ventures in this study because tech-
nology industries are highly competitive
and experience dynamic change. Conse-
quently, the importance of knowledge
currency for any new venture should be
profound. Surveys were sent to the CEOs
of the new ventures requesting participa-
tion in a study of technology ﬁrms. A
total of 83 CEOs responded to the survey
request, for a 47 percent response rate.
Because of nonresponse on some items
and eliminations due to outliers,
the
effective sample size is somewhat lower
in some of the analyses. Through Dun &
Bradstreet and the chambers of com-
merce, we collected data for all 177 ﬁrms
on age, employment size, changes in
employment over previous years, and
legal form. Chi-squared and t-tests were
conducted to compare responding to
nonresponding ﬁrms, and no signiﬁcant
differences were observed.

On average,

the responding ﬁrms
were less than ﬁve years old and had 36
employees. Life cycle data collected from
the respondents indicates that these tech-
nology companies were in the early stage
of
development. Using Kazanjian’s
(1988) scale, the responding ﬁrms were
on average between the commercializa-

the
responding CEOs were founders of their
companies. Forty-seven percent of the
entire CEO sample and 52 percent of the
founder CEOs, had previous start-up
experience. Just over 20 percent of the
entire CEO sample had been involved in
more than one start-up previously.

Variables and Measures
Knowledge Relatedness. CEO respon-
dents were asked to indicate how related
their present company was to that of the
previous company where they worked.
relatedness were
Two dimensions of
sought. For
the
survey asked the CEO to rate “the extent
to which your present company operates
in the same or very similar industry.” For
business relatedness, the survey asked
the CEO to rate “the extent to which your
present company’s products, services, or
overall approach (e.g., strategy, R&D
effort, operations, marketing, sales, etc.)
are the same or very similar.” Following
the method used in previous studies
(Tanriverdi
and Venkatraman 2005;
Capron, Dussauge, and Mitchell 1998),
respondents evaluated each relatedness
dimension using a ﬁve-point
scale,
where 1 represented “extremely unre-
lated; not the same in any respect” and 5
represented “extremely related; the same
or very close to it.”

Previous Start-up Experience. The resp-
ondents were asked if they had founded
or worked in other start-up companies
previously. Respondents reported the
number of start-up companies they had
worked in previously.

Networking. The
respondents were
asked to identify each individual outside
the company “who provided especially
important information or advice to you
at the time you started or joined your
present company. By ‘especially impor-
tant’ is meant information or advice you

believe was critical to your success in
starting up and/or developing this
company.” Each respondent was asked
to rate the communication frequency
with each individual named in this self-
generated roster, and the “newness” of
information provided by each person
named. A ﬁve-point rating scale was
used for each dimension. For communi-
cation frequency, the scale ranged from 1
for “very infrequent” to 5 for “very fre-
quent”; for newness of information and
advice the scale ranged from 1 for “not at
all” to 5 for “to a very great extent.”
These methods have been used previ-
ously in research on networking in new
ventures (West and Meyer 1997) and on
networking in general (e.g., Scott 1991).

New Venture Performance. Reﬂecting
the concern that absolute measures of
performance (such as
sales or net
income) do not appropriately capture the
strategy and resource-based view focus-
ing on competitive advantage (Gilbert,
McDougall, and Audretsch 2006),
this
study used a dependent variable that
focused on performance relative to com-
petition. Wiklund and Shepherd (2003)
previously employed a similar approach
to assess performance relative to com-
petitors, reﬂecting the theoretical focus
of the resource-based view. The partici-
pating companies were privately held;
therefore, detailed ﬁnancial information
was not available. Firm performance was
measured by the subjective assessment
of
the respondent, using the ratings
of
three performance-related question
items. One item, based on Dess and Rob-
inson (1984), asked for an assessment
of the percent of ideal performance be-
ing achieved, where ideal performance
equated to 100 percent. Two other items
build on the tradition of strategy as com-
petitive advantage leading to enhanced
performance. These
assessed
growth and overall performance “relative
to other companies facing similar busi-
ness development challenges or who are

items

in the same business.” Each of these rela-
tive assessments used a seven-point
agreement scale, and the score on each
was then interpolated into a 0-to-100
range equivalent. The overall measure of
performance used for the ﬁrm is the
average of
the three items described
here, expressed as a percent. The com-
posite measure at the ﬁrm level has a
Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient of 0.84. A
substantially similar scale has been reli-
ably used in other research on private
new ventures, and represents an effec-
tive proxy for objective measures of per-
formance (Lumpkin and Dess 1995).

Because of

concerns of possible
common method bias due to self-report
data from a single source, data collected
in the surveys were compared to identi-
cal data collected independently on the
responding companies
from Dun &
Bradstreet and the local chambers of
commerce. Correlations between these
different
included 0.97 for
company age, 0.93 for employment size,
and 0.83 for changes in employment (all
p < .001),
that
common
method bias is not an issue.

indicating

sources

Control Variables. Performance is often
correlated with ﬁrm size, and so a
measure of ﬁrm size is used as a control
variable. Number of employees,
log-
transformed to a normal distribution,
served as a proxy for ﬁrm size. New
venture performance is also especially
sensitive to ﬁrm age, due to liabilities of
newness (Stinchcombe 1965), so ﬁrm
age is also used as a control variable.
Results

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics
and bivariate correlations among the
variables in this study. The responding
ﬁrms were performing on average at a
level of 71 percent, relative to the indi-
vidual performance benchmarks
sug-
gested by the survey. The CEOs in this
survey had an average of just under one
start-up experience in their background

company. Consistent with prior work, it
appears as if the majority of these new
ventures bore some relationship to both
the previous industry and previous busi-
ness model experienced by the CEO, as
both measures of relatedness were above
the midpoint on the scales used. Usage
of networks by the CEOs appears fairly
robust, on average involving frequent
contact and the provision of new infor-
mation. Network frequency of use is
positively correlated with both perfor-
mance and size of the company. As the
individuals named in the networking
roster were external to the company, it
may suggest
that advice network use
grows as the company size grows and as
the need for new understanding also
increases.

The theory development section of
this article focused on founder CEOs. As
described earlier, a very high percentage
of
study were
founder CEOs. The hypotheses tests that
follow use the entire survey response
base, which includes nine CEOs who
were not also founders. Duplicate post
hoc regression analyses were run using
founder CEO as a dummy control vari-
able, in order to discern if any different
relationships emerged when considering
only founder CEOs. All of the duplicate
regressions produced almost
identical
results as the full, unmoderated tests
reported in the succeeding discussions.

In Model 1, new
venture performance is regressed on the
combination of
industry and business
relatedness, controlling for ﬁrm size and
age. An interaction term is included in
this model in order to partial out inter-
action effects (Cohen 1978) of the two
variables, and because H1c suggests a
speciﬁc
relationship between perfor-
mance and this interaction. As the two
independent variables exhibit reasonably
strong bivariate

consulted to assess the possibility of mul-
ticollinearity. VIFs for both variables are
below 10, indicating this is not an issue
(Tabachnik and Fidell 1989). However,
the introduction of the interaction term
does increase the threat of multicol-
linearity. A recommended solution is to
center the independent variables before
creating the interaction term (Jaccard,
Turrisi, and Wan 1990). This approach
was followed in the models containing
the interaction term.

Model 1 predicts ﬁrm performance at

although the predictor variables in com-
bination are not

the model in the direction hypothesized,

signiﬁcant

meaning that greater business related-
ness is predictive of improved perfor-
mance. The interaction between industry
relatedness and business relatedness is
also not signiﬁcant. Therefore, H1a and
H1c are not supported, whereas H1b
ﬁnds support. We also report effect size
and power. The effect size of this model
is at a “medium” level (Cohen 1988),
however, power is slightly below the
usually
accepted threshold of 0.80
(Tabachnik and Fidell 1989). The non-

not signiﬁcant, nor is the variable mea-
suring previous start-up experience of
the CEO. In a separate post hoc test that
was not originally suggested in the
hypothesis development section, perfor-
mance was also regressed against
the
square of previous start experience. This
would reveal whether there may be some
critical threshold of previous experience,
beyond which new venture performance
would be enhanced (Delmar and Shane
2006). However, the results of this test
(not shown in Table 2) were also not
signiﬁcant. These results do not support
H2.

Model 3 presents the results of the
regression of performance on network-
ing activity of
the CEO. The overall
regression is highly signiﬁcant, control-
ling for ﬁrm size (F = 7.841, p < .01). The
networking variables are both individu-
ally signiﬁcant, and in combination sig-
niﬁcantly explain performance (change
R2 = 0.245, p < .01). Together with the
strong bivariate correlation between
network frequency and performance,
shown in Table 1, H3a and H3b ﬁnd a
strong measure of support.

The full Model 4 in Table 2 presents
the results of the regression of perfor-
mance on all the independent variables
simultaneously. The full model
is also
signiﬁcant on an overall basis (F = 2.959,
p < .05), and is signiﬁcant after control-
ling for the effects of ﬁrm size and ﬁrm
age (change R2 = .301, p < .05). In this
model, we see that industry relatedness
is again not signiﬁcant, whereas business
relatedness is again signiﬁcant and posi-
tive. This model has a “large” effect size
with signiﬁcant power (Cohen 1988).
Therefore, this model provides stronger
support for H1b, while increasing conﬁ-
dence that the rejection of H1a and H1c
are not Type II errors.

Among the independent variables, the
two networking variables are signiﬁcant
and positively related to performance, as
is business relatedness. Table 3 displays

supported.
Discussion

the application of

This article applies a resource-based
theory perspective to the examination of
technology-based new ventures. Though
previous research on new ventures has
yielded rich ﬁndings about the start-up
process,
resource-
based theory provides a more reﬁned
view of the conditions that lead to supe-
rior performance and sustainability of
new ventures. We argue that knowledge
resources are the ﬁrst to express them-
selves in new ventures, and that knowl-
edge resources can instrumentally lead
to the development and acquisition of
other types of resources that are impor-
tant
for further venture development.
The empirical study examines three dif-
ferent sources of knowledge resources
for new venture CEOs, including related
industry and business experience, previ-

At the outset, we need to qualify the
nature of the results observed in this

nature of change in technology-based
ﬁelds, which impacts these companies, is
likely to be greater than would be the
case in nontechnology industries. The
results witnessed in this study may not
hold for nontechnology new ventures.
These ﬁrms are also not located in the
geographic
technology clusters—such
as Silicon Valley or Boston’s Route
128—that are often the focus of technol-
ogy studies, nor do they spring from
incubators which have also been studied
recently. The geography of the sample
ﬁrms reduces the impact of potential
knowledge spillovers that exist in clus-
ters (e.g., DeCarolis and Deeds 1999;
Pouder and St. John 1996) or the poten-
tial beneﬁts of assistance through incu-
bation (Peters, Rice, and Sundararajan
2004), which might affect the nature of
the knowledge relatedness relationships
and the external networking identiﬁed
here. We have also not accounted for the
aspirations of
the new venture or its
CEO. Some ﬁrms may be seeking far
greater growth (such as multiple product
lines) or far broader markets (such as
international) than others, and such aspi-
rations might

and effect

impact

The results of this study do not ﬁnd a
relationship between new venture per-
formance and the relatedness of industry
knowledge gained through previous
experiences of the CEO. This challenges
past research that extols previous indus-
try experience. One explanation for this
unexpected result may be that
the

dynamic nature of technology industries
means that
the value of knowledge
gained from previous industry experi-
ences erodes very quickly (Newbert
2005). As technology advances and com-
petition changes, the nature of competi-
tion and industry key success factors
(Porter 1979) that characterized the past
may no longer be relevant in the present.
This is consistent with Tanriverdi and
Venkatraman’s (2005) claim that existing
knowledge “constrains a ﬁrm’s ability to
operate in new businesses” (p. 104). It
is also consistent with the detrimental
effects of strategic persistence (Audia,
Locke, and Smith 2000).

Another possible explanation is that a
ﬁner-grained view of
industry context
may be in order. Past research on knowl-
edge brought into technology ventures
in the form of top managers with re-
lated experience has often been situated
in well-developed communities
like
Silicon Valley (e.g., Eisenhardt and
Schoonhoven 1990; Eisenhardt 1989).
The stage of development of both the
start-up companies and the economic
communities in which they are located
may provide a context in which such
“knowledge transfers” can be more ef-
fective. In Silicon Valley or the North
Carolina Research Triangle, clustered
development
in technological ﬁelds
tends to occur and start-ups tend to build
off
the infrastructures and commonly
shared knowledge bases that character-
ize these areas (Marshall 1949). In the
present study conducted in a region with
far less technology-based entrepreneurial
development, previous related industry
experience may not be as helpful
because the interaction of that knowl-
edge with locally available infrastruc-
tures is not possible.
it
is possible that new companies locate
in less well-developed communities
because they seek to operate on the
cutting edge of their respective techno-
logical regimes (Anderson and Tushman
1990), relying less on past trends and

successes in their respective industries. If
true, then highly developed knowledge
industry conditions in the past
about
may inhibit
the development of these
types of new ﬁrms.

On the other hand, this study does
ﬁnd that business relatedness is posi-
tively
associated with performance.
Reﬂecting the resource-based view, high
levels of business relatedness are valu-
able, rare, and not easily attained, and
should thus favorably impact how the
new business is managed. The implica-
tions are that, though depth of experi-
ence in an industry is not particularly
helpful, depth of experience in the same
type of strategic approach that the new
venture is pursuing can make a differ-
ence. Earlier research has invoked the
ideas of expertise (Chi, Glaser, and Rees
1982) and pattern recognition (Ronstadt
1988) in describing the beneﬁts of depth
of experience. As Simon (1986) des-
cribed years ago in his chess grandmas-
ters experiments, expertise develops
through signiﬁcant apprenticeship and
experience. It enables both the immedi-
ate grasp of complex situations when
they are ﬁrst presented, the ability to
more easily understand cause–effect rela-
tionships, and the ability to project into
the future the possible directions that
any immediate actions might
trigger.
These are all provinces of the effective
strategist as well.

The ﬁndings on industry and business
relatedness have implications for
the
stafﬁng practices in new businesses.
Ruef, Aldrich, and Carter (2003) have
already discovered that
founder team
composition often results in a relatively
homogeneous group. Presumably,
this
occurs because of the intuitively appeal-
ing idea that previous industry experi-
ence is valuable to the new venture, the
validity of which is challenged by the
ﬁndings here. On the other hand, as
business
to be
important, the founder CEOs must assess
whether the speciﬁc strategy and busi-

relatedness

appears

ness strengths that they bring to the table
make sense for the venture or whether it
would be more appropriate for them to
step aside so that someone with more
focused and related experience can step
in. This is a particular challenge for
technology-based new ventures, as docu-
mented in previous studies. Though this
study did not evaluate the backgrounds
of top management team members, it is
reasonable to assume that the business
relatedness ﬁnding may have particular
relevance for stafﬁng these positions.
Where a new venture calls for a par-
ticular type of strategic approach, for
top managers with previous
instance,
experience in executing that
type of
strategy may enable the new venture to
achieve greater internal consistency of
action as well as greater effectiveness in
the marketplace. Future research might
investigate how the resource-based view
impacts the nature of top management
team composition.

That the present study ﬁnds no rela-
tionship between previous start-up expe-
rience and new venture performance
simply adds to the continuing debate that
surrounds what would seem to be an
intuitively obvious connection. Reuber
and Fischer (1999) differentiate between
stocks of experience and streams of expe-
rience that founders acquire when they
start up new businesses, where “stock”
represents the depth and breadth of expe-
rience and “stream” relates to the entre-
preneurial process of experimenting
and learning. The present study sought
to relate stocks of experience to new
venture performance. In contrast, West-
head, Ucbasaran, and Wright
(2005)
investigated the effects of differences in
streams of experience on individual per-
formance. More research is needed to
understand the relationships between
stocks, streams, individual performance,
and ﬁrm performance. For new ventures
that are only at the start-up phase, too,
the opportunity to have experimented
and learned is quite limited because this

process takes time. Thus,
the stock
concept would still seem to be most
appropriate to investigate at start-up, and
more work is needed here.

The strongest ﬁnding in this study is
that networking activity designed to
infuse the venture frequently with new
information is a strong predictor of per-
formance. The analyses suggest that indi-
vidual entrepreneurs may have greater
knowledge assets at their disposal than
they think. The networks that founders
or CEOs draw upon for advice and con-
sultation appear to be critically impor-
tant. That communication skills appear
to be important in the start-up process
should prompt educators to consider
means to enhance these behavioral skills
among people learning about entrepre-
neurship. This ﬁnding should also
prompt economic development authori-
ties to consider effective methods for
building and sponsoring local networks
that entrepreneurs can tap into.
also provides

strong
support for the notion that innovation
and new business activity are associated
with the bridging of structural holes in
information networks. Connecting with
people who have different perspectives
and understandings can yield important
knowledge unaccounted for by past
industry, business, or managerial experi-
ences
that entrepreneurs bring with
them. Future research should seek to
identify the characteristics and types of
new knowledge that start-up company
CEOs ﬁnd most useful in their network-
ing efforts.

study provides empirical support for pre-
vious qualitative ﬁndings and speculation
about entrepreneurial resource develop-
ment (Brush, Greene, and Hart 2001), and
responds to the comment by Gilbert,
McDougall, and Audretsch (2006) that
one of the greatest challenges is under-
standing how new ventures overcome
perceived risk in order to attract and
build resource positions. The pers-
pective advanced here is that knowledge
resources provide the foundation for this
building process.
