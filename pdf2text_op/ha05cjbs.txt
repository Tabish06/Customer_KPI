Investigating Hospital Administrators’ Experience 

of Workplace Mistreatment

Abstract

This study examines the nature and impact of workplace
mistreatment, excluding sexual harassment and physical
contact, experienced by administrators of a hospital.
Factor analyses show that mistreatment behaviours are
reflected by three dimensions: verbal abuse, work obstruc-
tion, and emotional neglect. Verbal abuse is regarded as an
interpersonal form of mistreatment whereas obstruction
and neglect are considered as organizational forms.
Administrators reported having experienced organiza-
tional mistreatment more frequently than interpersonal
mistreatment. We then examined relationships among
mistreatment, context support, employee psychological
well-being, organizational commitment, work satisfac-
tion, and intent to leave. As predicted, supportive work
environments mediate between workplace mistreatment
and well-being, commitment and work satisfaction but,
surprisingly, not the intention to leave the organization.
Implications for healthier and more productive work-
places for hospital administrators are discussed. 

Résumé

La présente étude porte sur la nature et les répercus-

sions des mauvais traitements dans les milieux de travail,
à l’exception du harcèlement sexuel et des contacts
physiques, que subissent les administrateurs d’hôpitaux.
L’analyse factorielle montre que les comportements qui
caractérisent les mauvais traitements comprennent trois
dimensions : la violence verbale, l’obstruction au travail
et la négligence psychologique. La violence verbale est
considérée comme une forme de mauvais traitement
interpersonnel tandis que l’obstruction et la négligence
sont considérées comme des formes de mauvais traite-
ment organisationnel. Les administrateurs ont rapporté
subir des mauvais traitements de nature organisation-
nelle plus fréquemment que des mauvais traitements
interpersonnels. Nous avons ensuite examiné les liens
entre les mauvais traitements, le soutien offert dans le
milieu, le bien-être psychologique des employés, le degré
d’identification envers l’organisation, la satisfaction au
travail et l’intention de quitter son emploi. Comme nous
l’avions prédit, les milieux de travail positifs agissent sur

les mauvais traitements dans les milieux de travail, le
degré d’identification et la satisfaction au travail mais,
curieusement, ils n’interviennent pas dans l’intention de
quitter l’organisation. Nous discutons de l’impact d’un
milieu de travail sain et productif sur les administrateurs
d’hôpitaux. 

Workplace  mistreatment  is  a  complex,  subjective
phenomenon  that  stems,  in  part,  from  interpersonal
interactions  and  organizational  practices  (Harlos  &
Pinder, 1999). A large body of research has examined
perceptions of fair treatment across a range of indus-
tries  and  organizations  (for  a  review  see  Colquitt,
Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001) with the excep-
tion of health care and hospitals (Kulik & Holbrook,
2002). Yet  in  Canada  concern  is  mounting  about
employee mistreatment in medical settings as signifi-
cant  industry  reorganization  continues  and  working
conditions for clinical staff decline (British Columbia
Office  of  the  Auditor  General  [BCOAG],  2004;
Koehoorn,  Lowe,  Rondeau,  Schellenberg,  &  Wagar,
2002). For example, emerging evidence suggests that
hospital  restructuring  is  increasing  both  the  work-
load  and  levels  of  job  insecurity  among  nurses,  in
turn  increasing  stress,  illness,  and  injuries
(Greenglass & Burke, 2001). Moreover, declining con-
ditions  appear  conducive  to  physical  and  emotional
violence toward nurses (Duncan et al., 2001). 

Although  the  current  focus  in  the  research  litera-
ture is on mistreatment of clinical staff, it seems likely
that another group of employees – hospital adminis-
trators – face similar adverse working conditions. As
leaders  and  policymakers,  they  must  design  and
manage  health  services  that  satisfy  public  needs
despite  an  acute  shortage  of  physicians  and  nurses
(Purnell,  Horner,  Gonzalez,  &  Westman,  2001)  and
chronic  government  underfunding  (Mackie,  2004).
We expect that hospital administrators will encounter
mistreatment from interactions with other health pro-
fessionals  in  similar  intense  circumstances  and  from

practices  in  restructured  workplaces  that  aim  to
increase  efficiency  in  order  to  avoid  service  cuts.  In
this  study,  we  examine  the  everyday  experiences  of
hospital executives, managers, and clerical staff, col-
lectively  referred  to  as  administrators.  Despite  the
strategic  importance  of  their  work,  few  empirical
studies have been conducted on administrators’ mis-
treatment, work conditions, and the impact on work
outcomes. 

Healthy Workplaces in the Health-Care Industry 

As  indicated,  research  on  mistreatment  in  health
care  has  focused  on  interpersonal  interactions.  In  a
recent survey by the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), 35% of residency grad-
uates  reported  that  they  had  directly  experienced
harassment  and  intimidation  during  their  training
while 37% reported that they had witnessed it (Gold,
Ross, & Seely, 2001). The deleterious effects of inter-
personal mistreatment have been clearly established:
higher psychological and physical distress; lower job
satisfaction,  productivity,  and  extra-role  behaviour;
and higher turnover (Harlos & Pinder, 2000; Keashly,
Trott,  &  MacLean,  1994;  Tepper,  2000).  Sweden,
Belgium, and France have recently legislated against
harassment at work in part to alleviate these negative
outcomes.  In  2004,  the  province  of  Quebec  became
the  first  North American  jurisdiction  to  protect
against  it.  Consistent  with  these  legal  imperatives,
the RCPSC requires that residency programs be free of
harassment and intimidation to achieve and maintain
accreditation  status. At  the  same  time,  hospitals  are
increasingly implementing policies to codify respect-
ful interpersonal behaviour as a key aspect of healthy
workplaces. Yet disrespectful treatment of health-care
employees continues to occur. 

Research on nurses shows that healthy work envi-
ronments ensure both their physical safety and their
psychological well-being through high levels of work
control and social support (Canadian Health Services
Research  Foundation,  2001).  These  findings  are  con-
sistent  with  research  on  the  demand-control  model,
which suggests that low control over work combined
with  high  demand  harms  employees’  mental  and
physical health (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). In a large
study of workers in the British civil service, low con-
trol  was  especially  important  in  predicting  illnesses
and sickness absence (International Centre for Health
and  Society,  2004).  Typically,  higher  positions  in  the
organizational  hierarchy  yield  greater  control  over
work.  Canadian  hospital  administrators,  however,
may perceive their work control as low despite their
position,  in  part  because  restructuring  is  typically
imposed by government. In 2001, for example, British

Columbia  significantly  reorganized  the  province’s
health-care  system  by  centralizing  over  50  boards,
councils, and service societies into six health authori-
ties.  During  the  process,  many  executives  were
abruptly laid off or fired and strategic projects were
cancelled.  Thus,  hospital  administrators’  well-being
may be at risk.

The  British  civil  service  study  also  found  that
unsupportive  work  environments  lead  to  impaired
mental  health  of  employees  and  increased  sickness
absence (International Centre for Health and Society,
2004).  The  quality  of  interactions  and  workplace
practices  significantly  influence  perceived  support.
For  instance,  supervisors  who  harass  employees  or
fail  to  provide  clear  and  consistent  information
reduce  perceived  support  and  may  even  engender
perceptions  of  mistreatment.  In  British  Columbia,
physical  aspects  of  health-care  work  environments
have  been  studied  more  than  psychosocial  aspects
such  as  interpersonal  relationships  and  the  role  of
supportive  work  contexts  (BCOAG,  2004).  This  focus
on  physical  rather  than  psychosocial  aspects  of
health-care  workplaces  may  extend  to  other
provinces.

Focus of the Present Study

In the present study, we examine the psychosocial
work  environment  of  hospital  administrators  and
their mistreatment experiences. Our study focuses on
mistreatment  that  is  verbal  in  nature,  rather  than
physical  or  sexual,  for  two  reasons.  First,  although
more  prevalent  than  physical  aggression  (Baron  &
Neuman, 1998) or sexual harassment, this category of
mistreatment has received far less research attention
(Keashly, 1998). Second, as indicated earlier, its conse-
quences  are  nonetheless  serious.  Even  incivility  or
rudeness  results  in  higher  job  withdrawal  (Cortina,
Magley,  Williams,  &  Langhout,  2001). At  the  same
time, an open question concerns the possible adverse
effects of practices and policies enacted within work
systems perceived as unfair or harmful. That is, does
the experience of feeling mistreated by practices pro-
duce  work  outcomes  different  from  experiences  of
mistreatment  by  people?  If  so,  does  context  support
play different roles in work outcomes depending on
the form of mistreatment? Thus, we also investigated
different forms of mistreatment.

The Nature of Workplace Mistreatment

The  organizational  literature  identifies  three
domains – interactional, procedural, and distributive
–  as  sources  of  mistreatment  perceptions  (Cohen-
Charash  &  Spector,  2001).  The  distributive  domain
deals  with  the  perceived  fairness  of  outcomes  (e.g.,


CJBS 37-4  9/26/05  1:11 PM  Page 264

264 Harlos and Axelrod

pay and promotion decisions) whereas the procedur-
al  domain  concerns  the  fairness  of  the  process  by
which  outcomes  are  determined  (e.g.,  performance
reviews). A less studied domain in relation to work-
place  mistreatment  is  systemic  in  nature,  reflecting
the  organizational  environment  (Sheppard,  Lewicki,
&  Minton,  1992). An  inductive  study  on  workplace
injustice by Harlos and Pinder (1999) found empirical
support  for  systemic  mistreatment.  They  identified
four  practices  and  policies  –  discrimination,  overwork,
inconsistency,  abandonment  –  perceived  as  unjust  by
managers  and  clerical  staff  across  12  industries.
Abandonment,  for  example,  occurs  when  organiza-
tions  fail  to  give  employees  needed  authority,  sup-
port,  or  resources  to  carry  out  their  job  responsibili-
ties.  Similarly,  Baron  and  Neuman  (1998)  identified
obstructionism as mistreatment that impedes employ-
ees’ ability to perform their work effectively. Because
hospital  administrators’  work  is  concerned  with
organizational  functioning,  we  expected  that  they
would likely encounter considerable mistreatment at
this level. We also speculated that they would be sus-
ceptible to interpersonal mistreatment, although to a
lesser degree, because they work with others experi-
encing similar pressure, sometimes in team structures
that  demand  frequent,  intense  interactions.  We
defined  mistreatment  in  terms  of  behaviours  that
employees deemed in prior research as unjust or abu-
sive  (e.g.,  Harlos  &  Pinder,  1999;  Keashly,  1998).  On
the basis of these conceptual distinctions and reason-
ing  provided  above,  we  proposed  the  following
hypothesis: 

Hypothesis 1a: Workplace mistreatment among hospital
administrators occurs in both organizational forms
(behaviours enacted in practices and policies) and inter-
personal forms (behaviours enacted in verbal exchanges).

Hypothesis 1b: Hospital administrators experience orga-
nizational mistreatment more frequently than interper-
sonal mistreatment. 

Antecedents of Workplace Mistreatment

We examined two factors – supervisor satisfaction
and  context  support  –  believed  to  be  antecedent  to
workplace  mistreatment.  Smith,  Kendall,  and  Hulin
(1969) suggested that employee satisfaction is multi-
dimensional,  incorporating  supervision,  work,  pay,
promotion,  and  co-workers  as  key  dimensions.  We
considered satisfaction with supervision the most rel-
evant  dimension  for  perceived  mistreatment.
Organizational  research  has  demonstrated  that,
although co-workers and subordinates may mistreat
employees,  supervisors  are  the  greatest  source  of

interpersonal mistreatment; not surprisingly, the con-
cept of interactional injustice is defined as the quality
of  relations  between  supervisors  and  employees
(Cohen-Charash  &  Spector,  2001;  Harlos  &  Pinder,
1999). Along  with  the  quality  of  interpersonal  rela-
tions, functional considerations contribute to percep-
tions of supervisor satisfaction (Locke, 1976) and per-
haps  even  mistreatment  perceptions.  For  example,
supervisors  often  wield  strong  discretionary  control
over  resources  and  can  obstruct  employee  perfor-
mance by withholding needed support or resources,
or  blocking  access  to  others.  In  addition,  systemic
injustice – work environments where employees feel
emotionally  abandoned  or  neglected  (Harlos  &
Pinder,  1999)  –  can  be  described  as  low  in  context
support. In a review, Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002)
confirmed  the  role  of  context  support  in  justice  per-
ceptions.  Together,  these  considerations  led  us  to
develop the following hypothesis: 

Hypothesis 2: Workplace mistreatment (both interperson-
al and organizational) is negatively associated with 
(a) supervisor satisfaction and (b) context support.

Outcomes 

We examined employee well-being, work satisfac-
tion,  organizational  commitment,  and  intention  to
leave an organization as outcomes of workplace mis-
treatment.  Previous  research  reviewed  earlier  has
documented individuals’ psychological and physical
distress  that  results  from  perceived  mistreatment.
Studies  have  also  found  that  mistreatment  inhibits
employees’  sense  of  attachment  to  the  organization
and pleasure from work experiences and prompts the
desire  to  leave  (Cohen-Charash  &  Spector,  2001;
Colquitt, et al., 2001). Among the three dimensions of
organizational  commitment  (Meyer, Allen,  &  Smith,
1993), we consider affective commitment most relevant
for this study. This type of commitment is described
as a feeling of belonging or psychological attachment
to the organization. Because workplace mistreatment
is emotion-laden (Harlos & Pinder, 2000), we expect-
ed that affect-oriented commitment would more like-
ly  be  related  to  mistreatment  than  continuance com-
mitment  (based  on  perceived  costs  associated  with
leaving)  or  normative commitment  (based  on  per-
ceived  obligation).  Lastly,  on  the  basis  that  people
may  quit  following  severe  workplace  injustice  (e.g.,
Harlos & Pinder, 1999) or wish they could, we exam-
ined  the  intention  to  leave  the  organization,  identi-
fied as the most immediate psychological antecedent
to  voluntary  turnover  (Hom  &  Griffeth,  1995).  For
these reasons, we hypothesized:

Workplace Mistreatment of Hospital Administrators 265

Hypothesis 3: Workplace mistreatment (both interperson-
al and organizational) is negatively associated with 
(a) organizational self-esteem, (b) organizational commit-
ment, (c) work satisfaction, and is positively associated
with (d) intent to leave.

The Mediating Role of Context Support

As  indicated  earlier,  research  suggests  that
employees  who  feel  supported  at  work  suffer  fewer
decrements  to  mental  and  physical  health  than
employees who do not feel supported (International
Centre  for  Health  and  Society,  2004).  In  addition,
Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002) found not only that
justice perceptions are antecedent to context support
but also that employees’ intention to leave is lower in
supportive  workplaces.  They  further  proposed  that
perceived  organizational  support  should  increase
employees’  sense  of  belonging  in  the  organization.
Thus, we expected that:  

Hypothesis 4: Context support mediates the relationship
between workplace mistreatment and (a) organizational
self-esteem, (b) organizational commitment, (c) work sat-
isfaction, and (d) intent to leave. 

We  included  two  control  variables  when  testing
the  hypotheses.  First,  because  employees  who  have
been with the organization longer are more likely to
have  encountered  mistreatment,  we  controlled  for
organizational tenure so that relationships could not
be  explained  by  length  of  employment.  Second,  we
controlled for trait negative affect to investigate mis-
treatment over and above dispositional tendencies to
construe innocuous events as mistreatment.

Method

Procedure and Sample

We  gathered  survey  data  from  nonunionized
employees of a hospital in Western Canada to test the
hypotheses. Survey packages, including a cover letter
explaining  the  survey  as  a  study  of  workplace  rela-
tionships, were sent through the organization’s inter-
nal mail system. We sent a reminder letter one week
later. Participation was voluntary and confidentiality
was  assured.  Participants  were  offered  a  chance  to
win  a  cash  prize,  which  required  them  to  provide
their  name  and  contact  information  with  their  com-
pleted  survey.  Participants  completed  the  survey
either  at  work  or  at  home  and  then  returned  it  to  a
secure hospital location. Surveys were sent directly to
us for analysis. We separated identifying information
from the surveys and discarded it after determining
the prize winner.

The survey consisted of measures in five sections

ordered  as  follows:  1)  job  information,  including
intent to leave; 2) attitudes and dispositions; 3) work
experiences; 4) dispute procedures; and 5) individual
demographics.  Measures  of  the  intention  to  leave,
work  attitudes,  and  dispositions  were  placed  in  the
survey before questions of work experiences to mini-
mize possible priming effects. Data on dispute proce-
dures were omitted in the present analysis. 

Of  345  surveys  distributed,  126  were  returned
yielding a response rate of 37%, consistent with field
studies in hospital settings (e.g., Greenglass & Burke,
2001).  One  case  with  extensive  missing  data  was
deleted, leaving 125 surveys for analysis. The partici-
pants  were  80%  female,  85%  Caucasian,  and  had  a
mean  age  of  44.0  years  and  a  mean  organizational
tenure of eight years. They represented both manage-
rial/professional  positions  (80%)  such  as  vice-presi-
dent  and  operations  director  and  clerical/line  posi-
tions (20%) such as administrative assistant and sec-
retary across 42 departments. About 5% of the man-
agerial positions included clinical duties (e.g., clinical
nurse  specialists,  occupational  health  nurses).  Chi
square tests indicated that the sample was not signifi-
cantly different in terms of gender and position from
the population of 345 potential participants. Prior to
analysis,  missing  values  were  replaced  with  scale
means. No scale missed more than 50% of item data. 

Predictor Variables

Factor structure of workplace mistreatment. We devel-
oped content-valid scales to measure workplace mis-
treatment using items drawn from previous research
(e.g.,  Harlos  &  Pinder,  1999;  Keashly,  Trott,  &
MacLean,  1994;  Tepper,  2000). A total  of  41  items,
both positive (12) and negative (29), were generated.
Items were presented in random order in the survey
to  reduce  response  bias.  Participants  were  asked  to
rate  the  frequency  with  which  they  had  personally
experienced  each  item  in  the  previous  12  months
using a 5-point scale (never to daily). For the present
analysis,  items  that  measured  behavioural  descrip-
tions  of  nonphysical  aggression  were  retained  (e.g.,
“been yelled at”) whereas items that measured affec-
tive  or  evaluative  perceptions  (e.g.,  “been  afraid  to
approach  others”)  were  dropped.  Three  more  items
were  dropped  because  of  low  base  rates,  leaving  25
items  for  factor  analysis. Although  the  ratio  of  five
participants  per  measured  variable  is  at  the  lower
bound of “rules of thumb” for stable factor solutions,
a  review  by  MacCallum,  Widaman,  Preacher,  and
Hong  (2001)  suggested  that  levels  of  communality
and  overdetermination  of  factors  are  more  critical
indicators of the quality of factor solutions than rules
of  thumb  about  sample  size.  If  communalities  are

high,  sample  factor  solutions  correspond  closely  to
population  solutions  even  when  the  sample  size  is
small  and  factors  are  weakly  overdetermined.
Communality  results  for  these  data  (reported  in  the
next section) suggest that the subject-to-variable ratio
is  adequate. A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  measure  of  .84
further  supports  the  adequacy  of  the  sample,  and
Bartlett’s test of sphericity is significant (χ2 = 1,528, p
= .00). 

Because  of  the  paucity  of  empirical  research  on
organizational forms of mistreatment and the uncer-
tainty  about  dimensionality,  we  relied  on  statistical
rather than logical methods to assign items to factor
scales. Thus, we conducted exploratory factor analy-
sis, with varimax rotation, on the responses to the 25-
item ratings to identify the latent variables underly-
ing  workplace  mistreatment.  Examination  of  the
scree  plot  and  eigenvalues  revealed  three  distin-
guishable factors. We used a factor loading criterion
of  .55,  considered  fairly  stringent  (Comfrey  &  Lee,
1992), for variable inclusion to interpret factors. Nine
items did not load on any factor using this criterion.
Across the 16 items that did load on factors, commu-
nalities ranged from .41 to .73, with an average of .58.
These levels are moderate or “wide” (i.e., high) rather

than  low  (MacCallum,  Widaman,  Zhang,  &  Hong,
1999), and thus indicated that the quality of the factor
analysis solution was adequate for the sample size. 

We then confirmed the provisional stability of the
factor  solution  by  conducting  principal  components
analysis on the 25 items. As before, results indicated
a three-factor solution. Using a more stringent factor
loading cut-off of .60, eight of nine items that had not
loaded on a common factor did not load in this solu-
tion. Across  the  two  solutions  the  two  highest  load-
ing  variables  were  identical  and  each  item  that
loaded  on  common  factors  also  loaded  on  corre-
sponding components. The similarity across the two
solutions suggests stability of the factor solution. We
used principal components results to compute factor
scores  because  component  analysis  is  determinate
whereas  the  common  factor  model  is  not  (Steiger,
1990). The ratio of variables to factors (17:3) exceeds
recommendations  for  achieving  overdetermination
(Comfrey & Lee, 1992). Table 1 presents the loadings
for the 17 items retained in the three-factor solution,
which accounts for 52% of the total variance.

The  first  factor  measures  eight  behaviours  that
intimidate or humiliate people. We labelled this fac-
tor  verbal  abuse.  The  second  factor  comprises  four

Intent to leave

behaviours by which employees are denied personal
support  or  organizational  resources  needed  for  net-
working  and  performing  work  effectively.  We
labelled this work obstruction. The third factor consists
of  five  behaviours  that  undermine  employees  by
ignoring  their  needs  and  failing  to  provide  support
or recognition. We named this factor emotional neglect.
We then derived mean unit-weighted scores for each
factor.

Supervisor satisfaction. Satisfaction with supervisor
was measured by the 5-item scale from the Abridged
Job  Descriptive  Index  (Stanton  et  al.,  2000),  with
adjectives  such  as  “tactful” and  “bad” (reverse-
scored).  Scoring  followed  the  standard  index  proto-
col. 

Context  support.  We  measured  employees’  beliefs
that  the  organization  values  their  contributions  and
cares for their well-being using the 8-item Perceived
Organizational  Support  Scale  developed  by  Lynch,
Eisenberger,  and Armeli  (1999).  We  revised  it  from
the  original  7-point  Likert-type  scale  to  a  5-point
scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). 

Outcome Variables

Organizational  self-esteem.  We  assessed  the  degree
to  which  employees  feel  valued  by  the  organization
as a proxy for their psychological well-being at work.
We  administered  Pierce,  Gardner,  Cummings,  and
Dunham’s  (1989)  10-item  Organization-Based  Self-
Esteem Scale to measure the degree to which people
felt valued, with items such as “I count around here”
and “There is faith in me around here.” People with
high  scores  on  this  scale  perceive  themselves  as

worthwhile members of the organization who make
meaningful contributions. 

Organizational  commitment.  We  assessed  organiza-
tional  commitment  using  the  6-item  version  of  the
well-established Affective Commitment Scale (Meyer
et  al.,  1993).  Example  items  included,  “I  do  not  feel
emotionally  attached  to  this  organization” (reverse-
scored)  and  “I  really  feel  as  if  this  organization’s
problems are my own.”

Work  satisfaction.  We  measured  satisfaction  with
work  using  the  5-item  scale  from  the Abridged  Job
Descriptive  Index  (Stanton  et  al.,  2000)  with  adjec-
tives  such  as  “dull” (reverse-scored)  and  “challeng-
ing.”

Intention  to  leave.  We  measured  the  behavioural
intent to leave with Ferris and Rowland’s (1987) sin-
gle-item scale ranging from 1 (“I intend to stay until I
retire”) to 4 (“I intend to leave as soon as possible”). 

Control Variables

Tenure  was  assessed  by  asking  participants  to
indicate  the  number  of  years  and  months  that  they
had  been  employed  by  the  organization.  We  also
assessed  trait  negative  affect  using  the  10-item
Negative Affect  Scale  (Watson,  Clark,  &  Tellegen,
1988), which measures the dispositional tendency for
people  to  experience  negative  emotions  and  have  a
pessimistic outlook. Example items included, “I gen-
erally feel afraid” and “I generally feel hostile” along
a  5-point  scale  (1  =  strongly  disagree; 5  =  strongly
agree).

Results

Means,  standard  deviations,  and  intercorrelations
of study variables are listed in Table 2. Factor analytic
results  of  mistreatment  experiences  indicate  both
interpersonal  (i.e.,  verbal  abuse)  and  organizational
(i.e.,  work  obstruction  and  emotional  neglect)  foci,
supporting Hypothesis 1a. These results further sug-
gest that organizational mistreatment is multidimen-
sional. Analyses of mean scores indicate that partici-
pants rated emotional neglect as most frequent (M =
3.04,  SD =  .82)  of  the  three  factors.  Both  emotional
neglect and work obstruction (M = 1.87, SD = .77) are
significantly more frequent (t = -13.964, p = .000; t = 
-3.113, p = .002, respectively) than verbal abuse (M =
1.68, SD = .68). Thus, consistent with Hypothesis 1b,
hospital administrators reported having experienced
organizational  mistreatment  more  frequently  than
interpersonal  mistreatment.  The  significant  negative
relationships  between  all  forms  of  workplace  mis-
treatment  and  supervisor  satisfaction  and  context
support,  respectively,  provide  support  for
Hypothesis 2. 

Supervisor Satisfaction, Context Support, Workplace
Mistreatment, and Work Outcomes  

To examine the unique contributions of supervisor
satisfaction,  workplace  mistreatment,  and  context
support  to  work  outcomes,  we  conducted  four  hier-
archical regression analyses. Because the distribution
of  work  satisfaction  was  negatively  skewed,  we
reflected it and applied a logarithmic transformation
prior to regression. Negative affect and organization-

al tenure were entered as control variables in the first
step. In Step 2, supervisor satisfaction was entered. It
took  entry  precedence  over  mistreatment  factors
because  of  the  influence  of  supervisors  on  mistreat-
ment  perceptions  as  indicated  in  the  literature
reviewed  earlier.  Workplace  mistreatment  factors
were entered next, followed by context support. This
order of entry is also supported by previous research
noted earlier, which indicates that justice perceptions
and  supervisor  support  are  antecedents  of  context
support (Locke, 1976; Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002). 
As shown in Table 3, results indicate that supervi-
sor satisfaction contributed significantly to predicting
work outcomes above and beyond the contributions
of  negative  affect  and  organizational  tenure  (note
that because work satisfaction is a reflected variable,
the direction of coefficient is reversed for interpreta-
tion). In Step 3, workplace mistreatment was entered
into equations, and it also significantly increased the
explained variance for all outcomes except work sat-
isfaction.  The  significant  increment  for  predicting
decrements in organizational self-esteem and organi-
zational  commitment  from  workplace  mistreatment
seemed  equally  attributable  to  the  contributions  of
each  form  of  mistreatment. A puzzling  result  is  the
positive relationship between verbal abuse and com-
mitment. Yet in predicting intent to leave, the signifi-
cant increment seemed largely attributable to verbal
abuse (β = .28, p < .01) and, to a lesser degree, emo-
tional neglect (β = .17, p < .05). We had predicted in
Hypothesis 3 that workplace mistreatment would be
negatively  associated  with  organizational  self-

esteem, organizational commitment, and work satis-
faction but positively associated with intent to leave.
Together, results of bivariate analyses (listed in Table
2) and regression analyses (Table 3) show support for
most  of  these  predicted  relationships.  We  note  that
context support significantly increased the explained
variance of all work outcomes with the exception of
intent to leave. 

To  test  Hypothesis  4,  that  context  support  medi-
ates  the  effects  of  workplace  mistreatment  on  work
outcomes,  we  followed  Baron  and  Kenny’s  (1986)
guidelines for establishing mediation. First, as Table 3
shows,  the  proposed  mediator,  context  support,  sig-
nificantly predicts three of four dependent variables.
Although  context  support  does  not  predict  intent  to
leave in the full regression model, when we regressed
intent to leave alone on context support we found a
significant  (negative)  relationship  (β =  -.31,  p  < .01).
Second,  all  workplace  mistreatment  factors  predict
the  mediator,  context  support  (β =  -.26,  p  < .01  for
verbal abuse; β = -.37, p = .00 for work obstruction; β
= -.30, p = .001 for emotional neglect). Third, the con-
tributions of workplace mistreatment factors become
insignificant  when  entered  into  three  of  four  full
regression  models  with  context  support,  which
remains significant. In the case of intent to leave, ver-
bal  abuse  and  emotional  neglect  do  not  become
insignificant  as  Table  3  indicates.  Thus,  as  predicted
context support mediates between all forms of work-
place  mistreatment  and  organizational  self-esteem,
organizational commitment, and work satisfaction. It
also  mediates  between  one  form  of  mistreatment  –
work obstruction – and intent to leave. 

Discussion and Conclusions

This study sought to advance knowledge of work-
place mistreatment experienced by hospital adminis-
trators  by  investigating  its  nature,  impact,  and  the
potential  intervening  influence  of  context  support
between mistreatment and work outcomes. Although
there is strong support from previous empirical stud-
ies for interaction-based mistreatment, an open ques-
tion concerns the role of organizational practices and
policies in perceived mistreatment. This question sel-
dom has been tested empirically. Overall, the results
of this research suggest that (a) mistreatment experi-
ences  can  be  distinguished  on  the  basis  of  interper-
sonal  or  organizational  foci,  (b)  organizational  mis-
treatment is multidimensional, reflecting experiences
emphasizing  work  obstruction  and  emotional
neglect, and (c) context support is a mechanism that
mediates between work mistreatment and work atti-
tudes as well as employee psychological well-being

The  verbal  abuse  factor  identified  here  is  consis-

tent with concepts identified in the organizational lit-
erature  on  interpersonal  mistreatment  such  as  emo-
tional  abuse  (Keashly,  1998),  interactional  injustice
(Harlos & Pinder, 1999), and bullying at work (Hoel,
Rayner, & Cooper, 1999). The work obstruction factor
is  consistent  with  Baron  and  Neuman’s  (1998)  con-
cept  of  obstructionism  whereas  emotional  neglect  is
consistent with Harlos and Pinder’s (1999) concept of
organizational  abandonment.  We  note,  however,  an
important  distinction  between  the  concepts  of  emo-
tional abuse as defined in the interpersonal mistreat-
ment  literature  and  emotional  neglect  identified  in
the present study. Whereas emotional abuse is widely
understood as active in nature, emotional neglect is a
passive means by which organizational actions fail to
recognize employees’ socioemotional needs. 

A key  focus  in  this  study  was  the  role  of  context
support  as  a  mediator  between  verbal  abuse,  work
obstruction, and emotional neglect, on the one hand,
and  decrements  in  work  outcomes,  on  the  other.
Differences in psychosocial support in work environ-
ments were found to mediate these relations. This, in
turn, suggests that context support may be an effec-
tive  environmental  intervention  to  prevent  work-
place  mistreatment  from  having  adverse  effects.  In
particular,  when  individuals  verbally  denigrate
employees,  when  organizational  practices  and  poli-
cies deny employees the resources they need to work
effectively, or leave them bereft of feedback or recog-
nition,  work  units  that  aim  to  increase  the  levels  of
perceived  care  and  attention  toward  employees  can
prevent  decrements  in  psychological  well-being,
emotional  attachment  to  the  organization,  and  the
pleasure  derived  from  work.  Similarly,  a  supportive
work  environment  may  discourage  employees  who
feel  obstructed  in  their  work  from  quitting.  Social
support might take the form of mentoring programs,
for example, or norms that encourage peer discussion
about  work-related  problems,  and  clear,  respectful
communication. Context support appears to have lit-
tle  impact,  however,  on  employees’  desire  to  leave
the  organization  when  they  have  been  verbally
abused  or  emotionally  neglected:  Individuals  with
abusive  interpersonal  styles  and  organizations  with
practices  that  ignore  employees’  socioemotional
needs  appear  to  have  considerable  potential  to
prompt employees to quit.

Implications for Policy and Practice

This research points to the importance of the qual-
ity of interactions and practices in providing healthy,
effective  workplaces  for  hospital  administrators.
People, particularly supervisors, who verbally harass
employees or who withhold resources or recognition

compromise administrators’ commitment to the orga-
nization, and likely their health and productivity, by
reducing their potential to perform their best. These
findings suggest that hospitals may be unnecessarily
incurring recruitment costs to replace administrators
who  quit  because  of  verbal  abuse  or  emotional
neglect.  Improved  clinical  outcomes  –  as  well  as
functional outcomes – may also result from reduced
levels  of  interpersonal  mistreatment.  Previous
research has shown, for example, that respectful com-
munication  between  physicians  and  nurses  is  more
effective  than  advanced  technology  in  reducing
patient  mortality  (Knaus,  Wagner,  Zimmerman,  &
Draper,  1986).  In  addition,  high-quality  interactions
between  caregivers  is  associated  with  shorter  hospi-
tal  stays  for  patients  and  reduced  turnover  among
nurses (Shortell et al., 1994). Although the role of hos-
pital administrators’ interactions on patient outcomes
is  not  immediately  obvious,  nevertheless,  the  rela-
tionship should be investigated in future research.

In  practical  terms,  hospital-wide  training  to  help
employees  develop  respectful  communication  styles
and  effective  conflict  resolution  skills  should  reduce
verbal abuse. Further, anecdotal evidence from prac-
titioners that hospital administrators can be promot-
ed  on  the  basis  of  technical  expertise  rather  than
management  or  leadership  skills  underscores  the
need  for  interpersonal  training.  In  terms  of  policy,
codes  of  interpersonal  conduct  with  clear  standards
of (mis)conduct can increase awareness of abusive or
harassing  behaviours.  Such  codes  should  foster  per-
ceived  support  in  the  work  environment.  Rhoades
and  Eisenberger  (2002)  suggested  that  how  employ-
ees  attribute  supervisors’  behaviour  influences  con-
text  support:  Work  environments  are  seen  as  more
supportive when behaviour is believed to be idiosyn-
cratic rather than condoned by the organization. The
importance of context support in work environments
as  indicated  in  the  present  study  reinforces  the  rec-
ommendation  (BCOAG,  2004)  that  hospitals  monitor
levels of psychosocial support and their effects. 

Together,  these  implications  are  consistent  with
Hornstein’s  (2003)  recommendation  to  create  inclu-
sive  work  environments  through  policies  that  pro-
mote  respect  and  through  systemic  practices  that
encourage recognition of employees, as well as with
Namie’s  (2003)  call  for  antiworkplace  bullying  poli-
cies with enforcement processes, restorative interven-
tions, and education. As Namie observes, employers
tend  not  to  act  when  employees  complain.
Organizational  inaction  or  ineffective  action  in  the
face of complaints  (Harlos, 2001) can foster employ-
ees’  silence  about  mistreatment  (Pinder  &  Harlos,
2001), precluding organizations from remedial action.

Thus, safe complaint procedures are needed to effec-
tively remedy deleterious effects from abusive inter-
actions or obstructive, neglectful practices at work.

Our  research  builds  on  previous  inquiries  into
how  to  establish  and  maintain  high-quality  work-
places  for  clinical  hospital  staff  (e.g.,  Burke,  2001).
Our results indicate that, for hospital administrators,
interactions  with  people  that  reinforce  respect  and
organizational practices that reinforce functional and
emotional support are important features for healthy
workplaces,  and  perhaps  even  the  sustainability  of
health-care services.

Limitations and Implications for Future Research 

This study has three main limitations. First, it was
conducted  in  a  single  organization,  although  data
were gathered across different departments and posi-
tions.  Nevertheless,  studies  conducted  in  different
hospitals  are  needed.  Second,  cross-sectional  survey
data  do  not  allow  inferences  about  causality,  and
regression results may not extend beyond these data.
Although  findings  from  field  studies  tend  to  have
strong ecological validity, future research needs to be
conducted  in  other  locations  to  validate  findings.  In
addition,  larger  datasets  with  higher  subject-to-vari-
able ratios should be sought, provided that commu-
nality estimates are moderate to high and factors are
overdetermined.  Longitudinal  studies  in  health-care
settings using multiple types of data will help estab-
lish causal relationships. Third, the use of self-reports
raises the possibility of common methods bias, which
may  inflate  results. Yet  it  is  unlikely  that  methods
other  than  self-report  could  have  elicited  the  sensi-
tive data sought here. Future studies should also ver-
ify  sources  of  mistreatment  (e.g.,  co-workers,
patients,  superiors).  In  addition,  research  that
expands  outcome  measures,  such  as  physical  health
along  with  performance  and  clinical  outcomes  will
allow more comprehensive assessment of impact. 

Despite  its  limitations,  this  study  adds  important
knowledge  about  relationships  between  the  quality
of  health-care  workplaces  and  work  outcomes.  By
focusing  on  hospital  administrators,  we  bring  atten-
tion to a neglected group of employees and forms of
mistreatment to which they may be particularly sus-
ceptible.  Not  all  perceptions  of  mistreatment  can  be
avoided, but by trying to reduce occurrences of mis-
treatment,  administrators  may  be  less  likely  to  quit.
Further, by providing supportive work environments
as  a  situational  intervention,  the  adverse  effects  of
mistreatment for hospital administrators may be pre-
vented.
