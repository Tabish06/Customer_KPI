We explore the impact of labour turnover on ﬁrm performance by analysing the predictions of an extension
of the efﬁciency wage model of [Salop, S., (1979) ‘A Model of the Natural Rate of Unemployment’, American
Economic Review, 69, 117–125.] developed by [Garino, G. and Martin, C., (2008) ‘The Impact of Labour
Turnover: Theory and Evidence from UK Micro Data’, Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis in the Social
Sciences, 1(3), 81–104.], which separates incumbent and newly hired workers in the production function.
Within this theoretical framework, an exogenous increase in the turnover rate can increase proﬁts if ﬁrms do
not choose wages unilaterally. We test the theoretical predictions of the model using UK cross-section
establishment-level data, the 2004 Workplace and Employee Relations Survey. In accordance with our
theoretical priors, the empirical results support the standard inverse relationship between the quit rate and
ﬁrm performance where ﬁrms unilaterally choose the wage and generally support a positive relationship
between ﬁrm performance and the quit rate where trade unions inﬂuence wage setting.

1. Introduction and background

Labour turnover is an important feature of the labour market: for
example, in OECD countries, approximately 10–15% of workers quit
their jobs every year (OECD Economic Outlook, 1999), with the quit
rate for the UK estimated at approximately 10% in 2004 (Quintini and
Martin, 2006). Labour turnover affects both workers and ﬁrms:
workers may need to learn new job-speciﬁc skills, whilst ﬁrms incur
the costs of hiring and training new workers. Incoming workers,
however, may be more highly motivated, better educated and more
highly skilled. Hence, turnover may actually enhance ﬁrm perfor-
mance, a possibility which has attracted limited attention in the
existing literature. The existing literature has generally focused on the
impact of turnover on workers rather than on ﬁrms, with the
following exceptions: turnover and hiring costs have been studied
by (Burgess and Dolado, 1989, Hammermesh, 1995; Hammermesh
and Pfann, 1996), while (Hutchinson et al., 1997; Kersley and Martin,
1997), have analysed the impact of turnover on productivity. The
theory used to explain the impact of turnover on ﬁrms is mostly based
on the well known efﬁciency wage model of Salop (1979), in which
ﬁrms choose wages so as to minimise the marginal cost of labour,

balancing the marginal effect of higher wages against the marginal
reduction in training costs induced by higher wages.

In this paper, we contribute to the literature exploring the
implications of labour turnover for the ﬁrm. To be speciﬁc, we
empirically explore the theoretical predictions of an extension to the
model of Salop (1979) developed by Garino and Martin (2008), which
distinguishes between newly hired and incumbent workers, since the
latter have more job-speciﬁc human capital but may have less general
human capital. A higher turnover rate implies that the proportion of
new hires in the workforce is larger. If this causes a sufﬁciently large
increase in productivity then an increase in turnover can actually
increase proﬁts. Garino and Martin (2008) show that this effect is
possible, but only when ﬁrms do not unilaterally choose the wage —
for example when the wage is negotiated with a union or set
nationally. When the ﬁrm chooses the wage unilaterally, as in Salop's
original model, the impact of turnover on proﬁts is negative.

In order to test the predictions from this theoretical framework, we
analyse cross-section, establishment-level data from the 2004 Work-
place and Employee Relations Survey (WERS) to ascertain the nature of
the relationship between turnover and ﬁrm performance. Our ﬁndings
support the inverse relationship predicted by Salop (1979) if ﬁrms are
able to choose wages unilaterally. In contrast, where ﬁrms do not set
wages unilaterally, our empirical analysis generally supports a positive
relationship between the quit rate and ﬁrm performance. The paper is
set out as follows. Section 2 summarises the theoretical underpinnings,

whilst Sections 3 and 4 present our empirical analysis and Section 5
concludes.

2. Theoretical underpinnings

Output depends on the labour input of newly hired and incumbent
workers. New hires and incumbents have different levels of job-
speciﬁc human capital and are imperfect substitutes. The production
function is given by Y=F(h, I, λ, σ), where h is the number of new
hires, I is the number of incumbents, λ denotes exogenous produc-
tion-speciﬁc factors and σ is the elasticity of substitution between
new hires and incumbents.1 We assume that, because of fairness or
legal constraints, ﬁrms pay all workers the same wage2, w N0, and the
ﬁxed unit cost of hiring and training new workers is τ N0. The per-
period turnover rate, i.e. the proportion of the existing workforce who
quit, is a ﬁxed function q of wages and exogenous factors, including
the general market wage that workers expect to earn if they quit, θ:
ð1Þ

q = q w; θ

ð

Þ

where qw b0, qww N0, qθ N0, qθθ b0 and qwθ b0. In every period, qN
workers quit implying h=qN and I=(1−q)N. We consider the steady
state and normalise output prices to unity.3 Proﬁts are given by:
Π = F qN; 1 − q

Þ − w + τq

Assume the ﬁrm chooses employment and wages. At an interior

solution, the ﬁrst-order conditions are as follows:
ΠN = qFh + 1 − q
Πw = N qw Fh − FI

Þ = 0
ÞFI − w + τq
Þ − 1 + τqw

ð4Þ

If new hires and incumbents are perfect substitutes then Fh
−FI =0 and the model reduces to Salop (1979). The response of
proﬁts to turnover factors is obtained by comparative statics:

Πθ = Πqqθ = N Fh − FI − τ

ð

Þqθ =

qθ
qw

b0:

ð5Þ

The negative sign arises because a rise in θ can only increase proﬁts
if, for a given turnover cost, new hires are sufﬁciently more productive
than incumbents at the margin. Since qw b0, Eq. (4) implies that Fh−FI
−τ b0. At the optimal wage, new hires are less productive than
incumbents and an increase in θ reduces proﬁts.

Now suppose ﬁrms do not choose the wage unilaterally.4 There is
only a ﬁrst-order condition for employment, so the impact of turnover
on proﬁts is given by:
Πθ = Πwwθ + Πqqθ = N Fh − FI − τ

Þ qwwθ + qθ
ð

Þ − wθ

:

The number of new hires increases by qwwθ+qθ and incumbents
decrease by the same amount. The resulting change in output, (Fh−FI)
(qwwθ+qθ), is ambiguous, since the signs of both qwwθ+qθ and (Fh−FI)
are ambiguous. In qwwθ+qθ, wθ is expected to be positive, qw b0 and
qθ N0, while the sign of (Fh−FI) depends on the relative productivities

1 See Garino and Martin (2008) for a more detailed analysis of aspects of this model.
2 In a more complex model, we could differentiate between skilled and unskilled
workers who are paid different wages; and we could consider newly-hired and
incumbent workers as skilled and unskilled workers respectively. This would not affect
our main results. Nor would assuming that new hires are paid less during a training
period, since we analyse a steady-state solution.

3 A dynamic version of our model is available on request.
4 For example, if a ﬁrm negotiates wages with a union, wages will reﬂect all factors
relevant to both ﬁrm and union, as well as their relative bargaining power (Garino and
Martin, 2000).

of incumbents and new hires. The remaining term τ(qwwθ+qθ)+wθ
represents the impact on proﬁts of the change in total labour costs
induced by a rise in θ, which is itself ambiguous. Overall, therefore, the
sign of Eq. (6) is ambiguous. For sufﬁciently high levels of qw and Fh, the
impact of labour turnover on ﬁrm proﬁts could be positive.

To summarise, we have shown that if the ﬁrm chooses the wage
unilaterally, an exogenous increase in turnover will always reduce
proﬁts, but that if the ﬁrm does not choose the wage unilaterally, an
exogenous increase in turnover may increase proﬁts. We explore the
empirical support for this in the next section.

3. Data and methodology

In order to explore the relationship between turnover and ﬁrm
performance, we analyse data from the 2004 cross-section Workplace
and Employee Relations Survey (WERS). This is the ﬁfth in a
Government funded series of surveys conducted at British workplaces,
the previous four surveys having been conducted in 1980, 1984, 1990
and 1998. The aim of the WERS survey is to provide nationally
representative data on the current state of workplace relations and
employment practices in Britain, and it is widely regarded as the
principal source of information pertaining to changes in British
industrial relations (Chaplin et al., 2005). See Kersley et al. (2006) for
a detailed description of the current British employment relations
context.

The survey population for the 2004 WERS is all British workplaces
with at least ﬁve employees except for those in agriculture, hunting
and forestry, ﬁshing, mining and quarrying, private households with
employed persons, and extra-territorial organisations. The sample
comprises 2295 workplaces, whilst the sample used for our econo-
metric analysis includes 1900 workplaces due to missing values. The
2004 WERS comprises four main sections: the Management Ques-
tionnaire; the Worker Representative Questionnaire; the Financial
Performance Questionnaire; and the Employee Questionnaire. For the
purposes of this study, we focus on the workplace level data elicited by
the Management Questionnaire.

In the Management Questionnaire, managers were asked to
specify: (1) how many employees (full-time and part-time) were on
the payroll 12 months ago and (2) how many of these employees
stopped working at the workplace as they resigned or left voluntarily.
The distinction between voluntary quits and other reasons for leaving
the ﬁrm is particularly important for our purposes since it allows a
close match between the theoretical framework and the empirical
analysis. We use the responses to the second question to calculate the
quit rate in each workplace, deﬁned as the number of workers who
resigned or left voluntarily divided by total employment. The average
quit rate in our sample is 13.28%.

As pointed out in the introduction, it may be the case that new
hires are better skilled or more highly educated than incumbent
employees. One implication of this is that ﬁrms with a low turnover
rate may not necessarily have a more highly productive workforce.
Using the information on the quit rate elicited from the 2004 WERS
Management Questionnaire, we label workplaces according to
whether they are in the ﬁrst, second, third or fourth quartile of the
quit rate distribution. We have matched this information with
employee level
information from the Employee Questionnaire,
which up to 25 employees from each workplace were asked to
complete, yielding a sample of 18,634 employees after conditioning on
missing values. The employee level data includes detailed information
on human capital measures.

Table 1, which is based on matched data from the Employee
Questionnaire and the Management Questionnaire, presents informa-
tion pertaining to the average level of human capital characteristics of
employees across workplaces grouped according to quartiles of the
quit rate distribution. The measures of human capital relate to the
proportions of employees with: no academic qualiﬁcations; GCSEs

grades D to G; GCSEs grades A to C; A levels; ﬁrst degree; higher
degree; other academic qualiﬁcations; vocational qualiﬁcations; and
an index of IT skills.5 It is apparent that in the third quartile, the index
of IT skills is relatively high as are the percentages of employees with A
levels, a ﬁrst degree and a higher degree. Such ﬁndings support the
argument that turnover may be beneﬁcial for the workplace, with
relatively high turnover (i.e. turnover in the third quartile) being
associated with a workforce with relatively high measures of human
capital.
In addition, qualiﬁcations and skills appear to be most
prevalent in the third quartile, rather than the fourth quartile, which
suggests that the relationship between turnover and human capital is
not monotonic.

In Table 1, we also present summary statistics relating to the
human capital characteristics of the sample of employees who have
been working at the workplace for less than one year and the sample
of those employees who have been at the workplace for more than
one year. With respect to academic qualiﬁcations, it is apparent that
for all categories of qualiﬁcations, with the exception of other
qualiﬁcations, the percentages are higher for the sample of new
recruits suggesting that, on average, new recruits are more highly
qualiﬁed than incumbent employees. In particular, the proportion of
employees reporting that they have no academic qualiﬁcations is
signiﬁcantly lower amongst the new recruits.

Thus, the summary statistics from the matched establishment and
employee level data suggest that high turnover may be associated
with high levels of human capital, which in turn may be beneﬁcial for
ﬁrm performance. Following the theoretical framework summarised
in Section 2, we explore the relationship between ﬁrm performance
and turnover by distinguishing between those ﬁrms who set wages
unilaterally and those who do not set wages unilaterally. One of the
most common reasons why employers may not be able to set wages
unilaterally in the UK may be due to the fact that wages are set
through negotiations with trade unions.

In the 2004 WERS,

information is available relating to the
proportion of employees who have their pay set through negotiations
with trade unions either at their workplace or at a higher level. A
response of 100%, therefore, indicates that the ﬁrm has no unilateral
power over wage setting: 26% of the sample, 484 workplaces, state
that 100% of their employees have their pay set via negotiations with
trade unions. Out of the remaining 74% of workplaces, there are 1037
workplaces with a 0% response.

With respect to measures of workplace performance, there is only
one measure available in the WERS 2004 Management Questionnaire,
which relates to overall ﬁnancial performance. Managers are asked to
assess their workplace's ﬁnancial performance as compared to other

establishments in the same industry. Responses are given on a ﬁve
point scale: ‘a lot better than average’; ‘better than average’; ‘about
average for industry’; ‘below average’; and, ﬁnally,
‘a lot below
average’.6 It is apparent that this measure of ﬁnancial performance is
subjective. Furthermore, the response rates below suggest that there
is a bias towards the ‘above average’ categories rather than the ‘below
average' categories. Evaluations of this subjective measure, however,
have indicated that the ordinal properties of the data are unaffected by
such bias (see Bryson et al., 2005). The response rate for the ‘a lot
below average’ category is very low (1%), so we collapse the last two
categories into one. Hence, we use the responses to these questions to
construct a four point index representing ﬁnancial performance
(FPwp):

FPwp =

3 = A lot better than average 12kð

2 = Better than average 40kð
1 = Average 39kð

where wp denotes the workplace subscript and the ﬁgures in
parenthesis indicate the percentage in each category. We then conduct
weighted ordered probit analysis to explore the determinants of FPwp:7
ð8Þ
wp = π VXwp + γ1qwp + γ2qwp  NUWS + γ3NUWS + vwp
FP4

where FPwp⁎ represents a latent variable denoting the unobserved
propensity of workplace wp to achieve a certain level of ﬁnancial
performance; qwp denotes the quit rate; Xwp is a vector of workplace
characteristics expected to inﬂuence FPwp⁎; β is the associated coefﬁcient
vector; y1 represents the coefﬁcient on qwp; NUWS is a dummy variable
indicating that the workplace is characterised by non-unilateral wage
setting (i.e. where the manager stated that 100% of employees at the
workplace have their pay set via negotiations with trade unions); and
νwp is a random error term. The inclusion of the interaction term
between qwp and NUWS enables us to explore whether the effect of quit
rates on ﬁrm level ﬁnancial performance varies according to whether
wages are set unilaterally or not.

The set of workplace characteristics included in Xwp reﬂects the
theoretical analysis in Section 2, in which the impact of turnover on
proﬁts depended in part on the marginal products of labour. We proxy
for these using a series of controls for establishment-level character-
istics. These include: industry; workplace size and age; foreign owner-
ship; union density; an index of the percentage of the establishment's
sales revenue or operating costs accounted for by labour costs; operating
hours of 24 h a day; whether the establishment faces competition from

5 There are thirteen possible IT skills: word processing; sending or receiving e-mail;
checking stock movements, availability or pricing; record keeping; ordering or
purchasing; controlling or monitoring processes or machinery; data entry; data
analysis; desk-top publishing; computer-aided design; programming or compiling
syntax; and any other task. The index runs from 0 to 13 depending on the number of IT
skills that the employee reports.

6 Cases where the manager indicated that either ‘no comparison is possible’ or

‘relevant data is not available’ were omitted from our econometric analysis.

7 The data was weighted as workplaces had different probabilities of being selected
for the survey. The sampling frame for the 2004 WERS was the Inter-Departmental
Business Register maintained by the Ofﬁce for National Statistics. Differential sampling
fractions have been used according to the number of employees and the 2003 Standard
Industrial Classiﬁcation (Chaplin et al., 2005).

ees.8 Summary statistics of the variables used in the empirical analysis
are presented in Table 2.

We explore the robustness of our empirical analysis in four ways.
Firstly, we re-estimate Eq. (8) via a generalised ordered probit model,
which allows the cut-off points to vary between workplaces (see
Williams, 2006). Secondly, we omit the interaction term and the
unilateral wage setting control and we estimate Eq. (8) separately for
ﬁrms that unilaterally set wages and for those who do not set wages
unilaterally. We present one set of results whereby we do not control
for sample selection bias and one set of results whereby we include a
correction for sample selection bias in the ﬁnancial performance
equation to control for the possible endogeneity of NUWS. We control
for the latent probability of NUWS by specifying a probit model with
NUWS as the dependent variable and the following set of over-
identifying instruments, which are jointly signiﬁcant at the 1% level in
the probit model: the number of trade unions who have members at

8 The variables denoting the occupational structure of the workplace are included to
control for human capital at the workplace. Unfortunately, WERS does not include
information relating to education across the whole workforce (only for the sample of
employees who completed the Employee Questionnaire). Since education and
occupation are highly correlated, we include the occupation variables to control for
workplace human capital. We also note that these characteristics are not speciﬁc to the
British context.

the workplace; the number of trade unions recognised by manage-
ment for negotiations over pay and conditions for any section of the
workforce; and a dummy variable for whether trade union subscrip-
tions are deducted from employees' pay. For the unilateral wage
setting analysis, we explore two samples: ﬁrstly, where NUWS equals
zero; and, secondly, where the manager indicates that no employees
at the workplace have their pay set through negotiations with trade
unions either at the workplace or at a higher level.

Thirdly, we repeat the analysis above replacing the quit rate
variable with its predicted variable estimated by OLS specifying the
following set of over-identifying instruments: the proportion of
experienced employees who have been given time off from their
normal daily work to undertake training over the past twelve months;
the average number of days of training undertaken by experienced
employees in the last 12 months; the proportion of employees who
are formally trained to be able to do jobs other than their own; how
much time is spent in induction activities; and how long it normally
takes before new employees are able to do their job as well as
experienced employees. We also control for employees' involvement
in workplace decision-making,
i.e. whether: a formal survey of
employees' views has been conducted in the last two years; the
workplace has groups of non-managerial employees that solve
speciﬁc problems or discuss aspects of performance or quality; the
number of committees of managers and employees primarily

concerned with consultation; the frequency of team brieﬁng meet-
ings; the frequency of meetings with senior managers and the whole
workforce; and, whether over the last two years management has
introduced initiatives to involve employees. In addition, to allow for
potential reverse causality, we include the ﬁnancial performance of
the ﬁrm to control for the possibility that the ﬁrm's ﬁnancial status
may inﬂuence quit rates.9

As a fourth robustness check, we analyse data from the WERS 2004
Financial Performance Questionnaire, which is the ﬁrst in the WERS
series to include monetary measures of the ﬁnancial performance of
the workplaces. After completion of the Management Questionnaire, a
Financial Performance Questionnaire was left for ‘someone respon-
sible for ﬁnancial matters at the workplace’ to complete. The response
rate for the Financial Performance questionnaire (as a proportion of
questionnaires placed) is 51.5% (see Chaplin et al., 2005). Our sample
size is reduced to 832 establishments once we allow for missing
values. Hence, we explore the relationship between the quit rate and a
monetary rather than categorical indicator of ﬁnancial performance in
order to explore the robustness of our empirical ﬁndings. To be
speciﬁc, we explore the relationship between the natural logarithm of
sales turnover (i.e. the total amount received in respect of sales of
goods and services excluding value added tax) and the quit rate. For
this smaller sample of workplaces, the mean turnover rate is at 12.92%
(standard deviation of 15.99), slightly lower than that reported for the
larger sample. The dependent variable is speciﬁed as the natural
logarithm of sales turnover, which has a mean value of 9.2107.10

4. Results

Table 2 presents the estimated coefﬁcients related to the ﬁnancial
performance model represented by Eq. (8). It is apparent that the
estimated coefﬁcient on the quit rate variable is negative and
statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. The inverse relationship
between ﬁnancial performance and the quit rate is in accordance
with the predictions of Salop (1979). In contrast, the interaction term
between the quit rate and the dummy variable representing non-
unilateral wage setting is characterised by a positive estimated
coefﬁcient. Table 3A presents the associated marginal effects in
Panel A, which reveal how the quit rate inﬂuences the probability of
being in each of the four ﬁnancial performance categories. The quit
rate is positively associated with the probability of being in the lowest
two categories of ﬁnancial performance and, in accordance with the
predictions of Salop (1979), negatively associated with being in the
two ‘better than average’ ﬁnancial performance categories. This
pattern is reversed in the marginal effects relating to the interaction
term between the quit rate and the non-unilateral wage setting
dummy variable, with turnover being positively (negatively) asso-
ciated with the relatively high (low) levels of ﬁnancial performance. In
accordance with our theoretical priors, the ﬁndings suggest that there
are distinct differences in the relationship between the quit rate and
ﬁnancial performance across ﬁrms depending on whether or not they
set pay unilaterally.

In Table 3A Panel B, the marginal effects from the generalised
ordered probit model are presented. It is apparent that only the

10 A variety of measures of ﬁnancial performance are available in the WERS Financial
Performance Questionnaire. The relatively low response rate to this part of the survey,
combined with missing values, precludes their inclusion in our empirical analysis. The
low response rate reﬂects the fact that a high proportion of workplaces declined to
take part in the Financial Performance Questionnaire. Furthermore, there is some
evidence that the workplaces which did not take part in this aspect of WERS were not
a random sample (Chaplin et al., 2005). In the following analysis, weights were used
which were calculated by multiplying the inverse of the probability of WERS
workplaces responding to the Financial Performance Questionnaire with the establish-
ment weight (see footnote 7 and Chaplin et al., 2005).

marginal effects associated with the highest level of ﬁnancial
performance attain statistical signiﬁcance. However, the pattern of
the marginal effects ties in with those from the ordered probit model
with the quit rate being inversely associated with the probability of
being in the ‘above average’ ﬁnancial performance category and the
interaction term being characterised by a positive association.

In Table 3A Panel C, we present the marginal effect relating to the
quit rate variable for the sample of workplaces characterised by non-
unilateral wage setting. It is apparent that the pattern of the marginal
effects accords with our theoretical prediction that turnover may be
positively associated with ﬁrm performance: the marginal effects

suggest that turnover may be associated with a lower (higher)
probability of being in the relatively low (high) categories of ﬁrm
ﬁnancial performance.

In Table 3A Panel D, we repeat the analysis for those ﬁrms where
NUWS equals zero. It is apparent that the pattern of the marginal
effects ties in with that predicted within the standard Salop (1979)
framework whereby turnover is associated with an inverse (positive)
probability of being in the higher (lower) ﬁnancial performance
categories. In Table 3A Panel E, we impose a stricter deﬁnition for
unilateral wage setting where no employees at the workplace have
their pay set through negotiations with trade unions either at this
workplace or at a higher level. It is apparent that the pattern of the
estimated marginal effects in Table 3A Panel E ties in with those for the
sample of workplaces where NUWS equals zero and, hence, with the
predictions of Salop (1979).11

In Table 3B, the results from the corresponding analysis for the
three samples of ﬁrms, non-unilateral wage setting ﬁrms, unilateral
wage setting ﬁrms where NUWS equals zero and unilateral wage
setting ﬁrms based on the stricter deﬁnition, corrected for potential
sample selection bias (Panels A to C, respectively) as well as the
predicted quit rate (Panels D to E, respectively) are presented. It is
apparent that the results are robust to controlling for potential sample
selection bias as well as to replacing the quit rate with its predicated
value, with the pattern of the marginal effects conﬁrming that
presented in Table 3A, where for the (non) unilateral wage setting
ﬁrms, the quit rate variable is (positively) inversely associated with
ﬁrm performance, thereby highlighting the robustness of our ﬁndings.
In Table 4, we repeat the analysis presented in Table 3A Panels C to
E and Table 3B Panels A to C replacing the categorical dependent
variable with a continuous measure of ﬁrm performance: the sales
turnover of the ﬁrm. We specify a weighted OLS model with the
logarithm of sales turnover as the dependent variable and the set of
explanatory variables is consistent with that in Eqs. (2) and (3) above
where the weights reﬂect the probability of selection into the survey.
It is apparent that in the case of unilateral wage setting, the inverse
association between ﬁrm performance and labour turnover prevails,
as predicted by Salop (1979). In contrast, where there is no unilateral
pay setting, the estimated relationship between labour turnover and
ﬁrm performance is statistically insigniﬁcant. Such a ﬁnding of an
ambiguous relationship between ﬁrm performance and labour turn-
over ties in with the theoretical analysis presented in Section II, where
the sign of Eq. (6) is ambiguous.

5. Conclusions

We have explored the theoretical predictions from an extension to
the efﬁciency wage model of Salop (1979) developed by Garino and
Martin (2008), where incumbent and newly hired workers are
separated in the production function. If ﬁrms can choose wages
unilaterally, the effect of turnover on proﬁts is negative, since, for a
given turnover function, proﬁt maximising ﬁrms adjust the wage to
minimise the cost of labour. In the case where ﬁrms cannot choose the
wage unilaterally, the impact of an exogenous increase in turnover on
the maximun proﬁt function can be positive as well as negative. Our
empirical analysis of workplace level data drawn from the WERS 2004
suggests that the nature of the relationship between employee
turnover and ﬁrm performance is inﬂuenced by whether workplaces
set pay unilaterally. Our empirical ﬁndings accord with the predictions

11 As suggested by a referee, we also explore the robustness of the estimated
relationship between the quit rate and ﬁrm performance by specifying semi-
nonparametric techniques (see Stewart, 2004). In general, our ﬁndings support the
inverse (positive) association between ﬁrm performance and the quit rate for UWS
(NUSW) ﬁrms for a selection of polynomials (e.g. 3, 5 and 8). It should be noted
however that although the Likelihood ratio tests support the use of the semi-
nonparametric methods, this estimator is essentially a large sample technique and our
sample of ﬁrms is arguably not large within the context of cross-section analysis.

of the theoretical framework supporting the standard inverse relation-
ship between the quit rate and ﬁrm performance where workplaces
are able to choose wages unencumbered by trade union negotiations.
In cases, where workplaces cannot choose wages unilaterally, our
empirical ﬁndings support the possibility that a positive association
between ﬁrm performance and turnover may prevail.

Our results imply a more nuanced view of labour turnover as they
suggest that turnover is not necessarily bad for ﬁrms. The literature on
efﬁciency wages highlighted the endogeneity of turnover and showed
that wage-setting ﬁrms face a trade-off between lower wages per
worker and higher turnover costs when they consider lowering wages.
But turnover has no intrinsic beneﬁts. Our analysis shows that
turnover can have intrinsic beneﬁts, as incoming workers may be
more highly motivated, better educated and more highly skilled than
those they replace. This suggests that further development of our
model, to embed it in a richer theoretical structure, including analysis
of wage growth as well as wage levels, would enable us to consider
involuntary unemployment and other labour market issues addressed
by efﬁciency wage theories. Such an extended framework would also
allow us to comment on the policy implications of this type of model.
