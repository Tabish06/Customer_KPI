Abstract

The interest in strategic human resource management (HRM) has spawned a number of empirical research studies that
investigated the impact of HRM practices on organizational performance. However, very little attention has been paid to address
the impact of HRM practices on operations management and to generalize the ﬁndings across countries and industries. Success
of some business decisions (e.g. globalization and merger and acquisition) necessitates recognition and reconciliation of the
differences among HRM practices in different countries and industries. This study attempts to generalize the efﬁcacy of seven
HRM practices proposed by Pfeffer in the context of country and industry, focusing primarily on the effects of these practices
on operations. The ﬁndings provide overall support for Pfeffer’s seven HRM practices and empirically validate an ideal-type
HRM system for manufacturing plants.

1. Introduction

Human resources are considered the most impor-
tant asset of an organization, but very few organi-
zations are able to fully harness its potential. Lado
and Wilson (1994, p. 701) deﬁne a human resource
system “. . . as a set of distinct but interrelated ac-
tivities, functions, and processes that are directed at
attracting, developing, and maintaining (or disposing

of) a ﬁrm’s human resources.” Traditionally, man-
agement of this system has gained more attention
from service organizations than from manufacturing
organizations. However, to enhance operational per-
formance, effectively managing this system is equally
important in both types of organizations. Needless to
say, sophisticated technologies and innovative manu-
facturing practices alone can do very little to enhance
operational performance unless the requisite human
resource management (HRM) practices are in place
to form a consistent socio-technical system. For this
reason, manufacturing organizations need to carefully
evaluate their existing HRM practices and modify
them, if needed, so that employees can effectively
contribute to operational performance improvement.

Several studies in the HR literature investigated
the impact of HR practices on organizational perfor-
mance. Although some studies related to HR practices
can be found in the operations management literature
(Jayaram et al., 1999; Kathuria and Partovi, 1999;
Youndt et al., 1996; Kinnie and Staughton, 1991), this
discipline has tended to address structural issues and
analytical questions, and has paid little attention to
human resources issues. A review of empirical articles
published between 1986 and 1995 in 13 OM research
outlets revealed that less than ﬁve percent of these
articles fell into the “HRM for operations” category
(Scudder and Hill, 1998). This lack of attention is sur-
prising when one considers human resources’ critical
role in achieving superior performance in compet-
itive priorities, such as low cost, quality, delivery,
ﬂexibility, and innovation.

Over the years, researchers have suggested many
HRM practices that have the potential to improve and
sustain organizational performance. These practices
include emphasis on employee selection based on ﬁt
with the company’s culture, emphasis on behavior,
attitude, and necessary technical skills required by the
job, compensation contingent on performance, and
employee empowerment to foster team work, among
others. Pfeffer (1998) has proposed seven HRM prac-
tices that are expected to enhance organizational per-
formance. The practices proposed by Pfeffer (1998,
p. 96) are:

1. Employment security.
2. Selective hiring of new personnel.
3. Self-managed teams and decentralization of deci-
sion making as the basic principles of organiza-
tional design.

4. Comparatively high compensation contingent on

organizational performance.

5. Extensive training.
6. Reduced status distinctions and barriers, including
dress, language, ofﬁce arrangements, and wage dif-
ferences across levels.

7. Extensive sharing of ﬁnancial and performance in-

formation throughout the organization.

There are several objectives of the present study
based on these practices. First, we investigate whether
manufacturing plants’ use of these seven practices
differs by country or industry. Next, we assess the
impact of each of these practices on organizational

performance which includes (1) operational perfor-
mance measures: unit cost, quality, delivery, ﬂexibil-
ity, and speed of new product introduction and (2)
an intangible performance measure: organizational
commitment. Lastly, we examine whether these seven
practices can form a synergistic HR bundle to repre-
sent an ideal HRM system for manufacturing plants
and check the efﬁcacy of this ideal system. Since the
manufacturing plant is the unit of analysis for this
study, we will be testing the HRM theory at the plant
or operations level of the organization.

2. Theoretical background and hypotheses

Organizations can internalize as well as externalize
employment (Lepak and Snell, 1999). Internalization
of employment involves building an employee skill
base inside the organization, while externalization
of employment means outsourcing human resource
needs to market-based agents (Rousseau, 1995). Each
alternative has its own costs. According to the trans-
action cost theory (Williamson, 1975), the decision to
internalize or externalize a part or all of an operation’s
human resource needs should be based on the trans-
actional costs involved. Arriving at a HR outsourcing
decision in such a manner is myopic as it overlooks the
strategic consequences. For example, outsourcing hu-
man resource needs can minimize bureaucratic costs
and complexities. However, an operation’s continued
dependence on external sources may inhibit its ability
to develop core skills and capabilities vital for long-
term survival in the marketplace (Lei and Hitt, 1995).
theory recognizes employee
skills, experience, and knowledge as assets with the
potential to generate economic rent (Coff, 1997). How-
ever, this theory evaluates human resources through
productivity gains. It falls short of attaching strate-
gic value to causal ambiguity and tacit knowledge
embedded within an organization’s human resource
system. In recent years, researchers and practitioners
have realized that HRM systems can be used as strate-
gic levers to focus on value creation that goes beyond
traditionally emphasized cost reduction (Becker and
Gerhart, 1996). Drawing on a behavioral psychology
perspective, researchers have highlighted the strategic
aspect of HRM practices and argued about why these
practices can lead to competitive advantage (Schuler

The human capital

and Jackson, 1987; Schuler and MacMillan, 1984).
The resource-based view of the ﬁrm further advanced
this argument by stressing that the tacit knowledge
embedded in ﬁrm-speciﬁc human resources is hard to
imitate because of its attributes, such as asset speci-
ﬁcity, social complexity, path dependency, and causal
ambiguity (Russell, 1997; Collis and Montgomery,
1995; Barney, 1991). The seven practices suggested
by Pfeffer (1998) are expected to foster such inim-
itable attributes in human resources and, thereby help
an organization attain competitive advantage. Several
researchers (Delery and Doty, 1996; Huselid, 1995;
Arthur, 1994; Osterman, 1994)
including Pfeffer
(1998) have argued why these practices are expected
to enhance organizational performance.

The impact of HRM practices on organizational
performance has been the subject of much attention
over the years. However, empirical validation of the
ﬁndings in operations across countries and/or indus-
tries is nearly non-existent and very limited at best.
Recent trends toward globalization and mergers and
acquisitions in the business world make the study
of HRM practices in the context of country and in-
dustry a necessity (Legare, 1998). The literature has
emphasized the need for generalizability of the rela-
tionship between HRM practices and organizational
performance. For example, Delery and Doty (1996,
p. 829) raise concern that the results of their study of
HRM practices on organizational performance in the
banking industry may not be valid in other industries.
These authors urge that “. . . the current ﬁndings need
to be validated in other industries to rule out industry
as an important contingency factor.” Similar cautions
can be made for country effects. The impact of HRM
practices on organizational performance as proposed
by Pfeffer (1998) and others can be generalized across
manufacturing plants operating in different
indus-
tries and countries if we ﬁnd support for the set of
hypotheses below.

H1. After controlling for the industry and country ef-
fects, organizational performance will be positively
related to each of the following seven HRM practices:
(a) employment security (alternatively, employment in-
security is negatively related to organizational perfor-
mance); (b) selective hiring; (c) use of self-managed
teams and decentralization; (d) use of compensation
contingent on organizational performance; (e) the ex-

tent of training; (f) reduced status distinctions and (g)
sharing of information.

Much of the previous research on the relationship
between HRM practices and organizational perfor-
mance has concentrated on a single HR practice,
such as compensation, selection, etc. (Gerhart and
Milkovich, 1990). However, a growing number of re-
searchers have argued for instituting complementary
bundles of HRM practices to enhance organizational
performance (Ichniowski et al., 1993; Osterman,
1994). “Human resource practices are said to be bun-
dled when they occur in fairly complete, mutually
reinforcing or synergistic sets” (Dyer and Reeves,
1995, p. 657). Pfeffer’s seven HRM practices are
internally consistent with one another. For exam-
ple, an organization promising employment security
needs to pay close attention to selective hiring of new
personnel. Employees cannot be retained for a long
time unless their attitudes, values, and behavior ﬁt
with those of the organization. Therefore, identifying
these qualities should be an integral part of the hiring
process. Effectively operating self-managing teams
and decentralizing decision making require in-depth
understanding of aptitudes, abilities, temperaments,
idiosyncrasies, and personal traits of fellow employ-
ees. Mutual understanding among employees usually
develops when they work together for a long time
as occurs in organizations that provide employment
security. Also, when an organization institutes per-
formance contingent compensation,
the employees
are motivated to focus on long-term organizational
performance rather than short-term gains if the em-
ployers provide employment security. Organizations
emphasizing employment security intend to keep em-
ployees longer; therefore, it makes sense to invest
more in training these employees. Under a longer
time horizon, training related expenditures should be
strategically evaluated and considered an investment
toward human capital rather than merely a cost of
doing business. Organizations need to make extra
efforts to reduce status distinctions, if they intend to
keep employees loyal to them. Sharing information on
organizational strategy, goals, and performance with
employees conveys that they are trusted. Information
sharing also empowers the employees and fosters or-
ganizational transparency which are crucial if the em-
ployees are to have long tenures in the organization.

S. Ahmad, R.G. Schroeder / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 19–43

As explained above, “employment security” is in-
ternally consistent with other HRM practices. Similar
arguments can be made about each of the remaining six
HRM practices. Therefore, these HRM practices are
internally consistent with one another and qualify as a
synergistic set. A bundle of internally consistent prac-
tices is more effective than the sum of the effects of
the individual practices due to their mutually reinforc-
ing support (MacDufﬁe, 1995). The resource-based
view also supports this notion by stressing that in-
dividual practices have a limited ability to generate
competitive advantage in isolation. However, in com-
bination, these complementary resources can help a
ﬁrm attain greater competitive advantage (Barney,
1995).

Every organization differs in how much effort it
puts into harnessing each of the seven HRM prac-
tices. An ideal situation may be one in which each of
these HRM practices is explored and exploited to its
highest potential, typically when an organization ex-
erts the maximum effort possible to develop, institute,
and implement each of these seven practices. Such
a HRM system may be termed an ideal-type HRM
system. This ideal-type HRM system is expected to
yield the highest organizational performance. The
more similar an organization’s HRM system is to the
ideal-type HRM system, the better the organization’s
performance. Moreover, if bundling invokes synergy
among HRM practices as previously argued,
then
an organization with a HRM system similar to the
ideal-type HRM system will explain signiﬁcantly
more variation in organizational performance than
any of the individual HRM practices or any combina-
tion thereof. From the above discussion, we draw the
following hypothesis.

H2. After controlling for the industry and country ef-
fects, the degree of dissimilarity (measured as misﬁt)
between an organization’s existing HRM system and
the ideal-type HRM system will be negatively related
to the organizational performance.

3. Data collection

We use world class manufacturing (WCM) project
data to test the hypotheses. The focus of the WCM
project is to examine differences in manufacturing

practices across plants in different countries and in-
dustries (Flynn et al., 1996). The response rate for this
project was about 60%. We use a part of this project’s
database that addresses HRM issues; it includes 107
manufacturing plants (see Table 1) after eliminating
responses with missing data. These plants employ
1153 employees on average, including both salaried
and hourly workers. The mean age of these plants is
about 37 years. The average facility size (production
and warehouse) is 160,701 ft2, with 32 product lines
manufactured on average.

Data collected from plants operating in four coun-
tries and three industries are used for the empirical
analyses. The countries are Germany, Italy, Japan, and
the USA. The four countries were selected to repre-
sent the major industrial regions of the world, North
America, Asia and Europe. In each of these coun-
tries, plants were randomly selected from three in-
dustries: automobile, electronics, and machinery. The
three industries were selected because the literature
suggests that they have been implementing various
WCM approaches, such as total quality management
(TQM), just-in-time (JIT), and employee involvement
(EI). We wanted industries that had been threat-
ened by global competition and thus were seeking
improvements.

Face validity of the questionnaires was insured by
having three different researchers develop items for the
scales. The three researchers then reviewed all of the
items for content validity. Whenever possible, scales
were selected from the existing literature. The data
collection instrument was pre-tested using 10 industry
experts and academics. After the pilot testing, some of
the items were clariﬁed or changed to be more repre-
sentative of the intended constructs. The reliability and
validity of the constructs were formally tested using
data from over 800 respondents in a prior round of data
collection in 43 US plants. As a result of these tests,

some of the scales were signiﬁcantly revised. The US
instrument was subsequently translated into German,
Italian and Japanese. The foreign language version was
then translated back into English by another individual
and compared for accuracy. Any discrepancies were
resolved.

Plant managers were contacted by a member of the
WCM team and asked for their voluntary participa-
tion in exchange for detailed feedback regarding their
manufacturing practices in comparison to the indus-
try. About 60% of the plants contacted participated in
the study. Interested plant managers appointed plant
research coordinators who maintained contact with
the research team. These plant research coordinators
were managers who had at least 3 years of experience
in the plants and were knowledgeable about the major
responsibilities of the employees working in the plant.
The research team consulted with the plant research
coordinators to identify the right respondents in the
plant who had pertinent knowledge, experience, and
ability to provide accurate and unbiased answers to
the questions in the survey. The questionnaires were
collected in sealed envelopes to maintain anonymity
of responses. Managers, engineers, supervisors and
workers responded to these questionnaires. We used
responses from different people for the dependent
(organizational performance) and independent (HRM
practices) variables to avoid common respondent
bias.

4. Measures

4.1. The seven HRM practices

Table 2 summarizes the variables used and the meth-
ods employed to measure the seven HRM practices.
While most of these HRM practices are measured
using one variable, some are measured using multiple
variables as determined by the scope of the HRM
practice and limitations of the WCM database. For
details on the measurement refer to Appendix A and
Table 3. Most of the variables were measured using
perceptual scales with a few exceptions where objec-
tive measures were used. The list of scales includes:
MFGHRFIT, BEHAVIOR, TEAMS,
INTERACT,
INCENTOB, JOBSKILL, MULTFUN, STRATCOM,
and FEEDBACK. These scales closely approxi-

mate the deﬁnition of the seven HR practices being
measured.

A set of Likert scales was used to measure pertinent
constructs. Each item of a construct was answered us-
ing the following ﬁve-point scale: strongly agree (5),
agree (4), neutral (3), disagree (2), and strongly dis-
agree (1). As mentioned earlier, the content validity
of a construct was ensured through pre-testing of the
questionnaires and structured interviews with the man-
agers and academic experts in the ﬁeld.

Each scale was evaluated for its reliability and uni-
dimensionality. A value of Cronbach’s alpha of 0.7
or more was used as a criterion for a reliable scale
(Nunnally, 1978). We removed an item if it did not
contribute strongly to the alpha value and if its content
was not essential for the construct. After purifying a
scale, we averaged all of the items in that scale, which
became the value of the variable representing the con-
struct. Therefore, any variable measured by the scale
can range in value from one to ﬁve, where ﬁve is the
most desirable value.

The remaining three variables in Table 2 were mea-
sured using objective measures. See Table 3 for details.
The variable INSECURE was measured as a percent-
age of employees laid off during the past 5 years. This
variable measures job insecurity rather than job secu-
rity; as such, the most desirable value of this variable
is 0. The variable CONTCOMP is a composite of two
binary measures. The value of this variable can range
from 2 to 4. A value of 2 indicates that the plant does
not use any group incentive or proﬁt sharing plans,
while a value of 4 indicates that the plant uses both.
Therefore, the most desirable value for this variable is
4. Similarly, the variable STATDIFF is a composite of
four binary measures, and its value can range from 4
to 8. The higher the value of the variable STATDIFF,
the higher the status differences. Hence, the most de-
sirable value for this variable is 4. The last column of
Table 2 lists the most desirable value for each variable.

4.2. Organizational performance

Past empirical research has mostly investigated the
effects of HRM practices on ﬁnancial performance
(cf. Delery and Doty, 1996) and some on efﬁciency
and employee turnover (cf. Huselid, 1995). However,
very few studies have examined the impact of HRM
practices on operational performance measures, such

4.2.1. Operational performance measures

Researchers

(Wheelwright, 1978; Schmenner,
1981; Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Hill, 1989) have
proposed a wide variety of operational performance
measures for manufacturing facilities. These include
cost, quality, delivery, and ﬂexibility. Lately, the rate
of new product introduction has also been included in
this list (Vickery et al., 1997). We performed factor
analysis to check if these ﬁve operational perfor-
mance measures formed different groups. The factor
analysis revealed that all of these measures loaded on

to one factor. Additionally, the reliability analysis of
these measures yielded a value of Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.71, justifying summing up these measures to
form a single performance index (PERFORM). This
composite measure represents a plant’s aggregate
achievement in all ﬁve areas of performance men-
tioned above compared to competitors. See Table 4 for
details.

4.2.2. Intangible performance measure

Researchers have yet to reach a consensus about
how best to deﬁne strategic HRM. However, Huselid
et al. (1997, p. 172) attest that there is broad agree-
ment in the literature that strategic HRM “. . . involves
designing and implementing a set of internally consis-
tent policies and practices that ensure a ﬁrm’s human
capital contributes to the achievement of its business
objectives.” Snell and Dean (1992) further stress that
a ﬁrm invests in employees to strengthen its human
capital, but the ﬁrm does not actually own this hu-
man capital. The ﬁrm has very little control over this
human capital as employees may leave the ﬁrm or,
even if they do not leave, they may not be inspired to
put forward their best efforts. Snell and Dean (1992)
recommend that a ﬁrm devise methods to ensure
that individuals act in the ﬁrm’s best interest over
time.

HRM practices that fail to elicit speciﬁc employee
attitudes, such as organizational commitment are less
likely to have strategic impact (Arthur, 1994). Further-
more, an employee with strong organizational com-
mitment will be highly motivated to expend energy
on organizational tasks (Anderson et al., 1994). Even
highly skilled and knowledgeable employees who are

uncommitted may not contribute discretionary efforts
and will thereby minimize their potential in the organi-
zation. Organizational commitment is an indicator that
testiﬁes to whether the HRM practices employed in an
organization are able to foster psychological links be-
tween organizational and employee goals. This is an
intangible outcome of a HRM system and is important
to retaining employees and exploiting their potential
to the fullest extent over time. We, therefore, iden-
tify organizational commitment as an intangible per-
formance measure and measure it using a scale. We
conducted reliability and unidimensionality analyses
for this scale. Items were dropped to obtain a reliable
and unidimensional scale. The remaining items were
then averaged to obtain a score for the scale (COM-
MIT) corresponding to each plant. See Appendix B
for details.

4.3. Measure of misﬁt

In context of this paper, misﬁt represents the dis-
similarity between an ideal HRM proﬁle and a plant’s
existing HRM proﬁle. We identiﬁed a theoretical ideal
proﬁle by choosing the most desirable values of the
variables representing the seven HRM practices shown
in the last column of Table 2. This proﬁle represents
the ideal-type HRM system that has been theorized to
yield the highest organizational performance. Math-
ematically, misﬁt is the Euclidean distance between
a point deﬁned in a multidimensional space by the
ideal proﬁle (i.e. the ideal-type HRM system) and a
point representing an experimental unit. In this study,
the experimental unit is a plant’s existing HRM sys-
tem as measured by the variables representing the
seven HRM practices shown in Table 2. Accordingly,
we use the following general formula to calculate
MISFIT.

MISFITi = n(cid:1)
k=1

where MISFITi is the distance between the existing
HRM system of a particular plant i and the ideal-type
HRM system; Xik the score of the kth variable of the
existing HRM system of a particular plant i; Xk the
score of the kth variable of the ideal-type HRM sys-
tem; k the number of variables representing the HRM

lated as follows:

proportionately inﬂate some variables’ contribution
to the MISFIT calculation. We have, therefore, stan-
dardized (STD) the squared differences (between the
ideal-type HRM system and the existing HRM system
of a plant) before adding them together to avoid this
problem.

4.4. Control variables

Since we intend to identify impacts of HRM prac-
tices on organizational performance that can be gen-
eralized across countries and industries, the effects
of country and industry need to be removed prior
to evaluating the relationship between HRM prac-
tices and organizational performance. We, therefore,
included the following control variables (indicator
variables) in the regression analyses. Three country
control variables, GERMANY (Germany compared to
USA), ITALY (Italy compared to USA), and JAPAN
(Japan compared to USA), are used to represent the
four countries. Similarly, two industry control vari-
ables, MACHINE (machinery industry compared to
electronics industry) and AUTOMOBL (automobile
industry compared to electronics industry), are used to
represent the three industries from which the data were
collected.

analysis to determine if the extent to which plants use
the seven HRM practices differs by country and/or
industry. Lastly, empirical analyses are performed to
test the hypotheses stated earlier.

Table 5 shows means, standard deviations, and
correlations, which allow for some interesting obser-
vations. For example, high variance of the variable
INSECURE indicates that plants’ employee layoff
rates vary widely. Employment
insecurity (INSE-
CURE) is negatively related to many of the HRM
practices which implies that a plant with a high em-
ployee layoff rate is less likely to foster growth in other
HRM practices listed in Table 5. The variable that
measures status difference (STATDIFF) shows similar
results. A higher status difference in a plant is associ-
ated with lower efforts in other HRM practices. That
is, it is unlikely that the HRM practices will ﬂourish
in a plant where high status difference exists. Further-
more, a plant with high status difference is expected
to have high employment insecurity (i.e. higher em-
ployee layoff rate) since STATDIFF and INSECURE
are positively correlated. Positive correlations among
different HRM practices show that when a plant in-
creases its efforts in one of the HRM practices, it is
also more likely to increase efforts in other practices.
Canonical correlation analysis is often used to in-
vestigate the relationship between two sets of vari-
ables. This analysis is primarily descriptive, although

it can be used for predictive purposes. We, therefore,
use this method to identify the relationship between
HRM practices variables and operational performance
measures. As suggested by Hair et al. (1998), three
criteria were considered when determining the num-
ber of important canonical pairs: (1) level of statisti-
cal signiﬁcance of the function, (2) magnitude of the
canonical correlation, and (3) measure of redundancy
for the percentage of variance accounted for by the two
sets of variables. Only the ﬁrst canonical pair was sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (see Table 6). The canonical cor-
relation (0.56) was moderate. The redundancy index
was found to be 0.1128, which is quite low. Although
there are no guidelines about the minimum acceptable
value for the redundancy index, generally the higher
the value of the index the better.

Traditionally, canonical pairs have been interpreted
by examining the sign and the magnitude of the canon-
ical weights. However, these weights are subject to
considerable instability due to slight changes in sample
size, particularly where the variables are highly corre-
lated. Canonical cross-loadings have been suggested

as a preferable alternative to the canonical weights
(Hair et al., 1998). The canonical cross-loadings show
the correlations of each of the dependent variables
with the independent canonical variate, and vice
versa. Table 6 shows the canonical cross-loadings for
the ﬁrst canonical pair. A loading of at least 0.31 is
considered signiﬁcantly different from zero at a level
of signiﬁcance of 0.05 (Graybill, 1961). According to
this criterion, except for ﬂexibility to change volume
(FLEXBLTY), each of the dependent variables is sig-
niﬁcantly related to the independent canonical variate
(canonical variate representing HRM practices). On
the other hand, all independent variables (HRM prac-
tices) except for employment insecurity (INSECURE)
and status differences (STATDIFF) are signiﬁcantly
related to the dependent canonical variate (canon-
ical variate representing operational performance
measures).

Researchers have argued that HRM practices can
differ across countries and/or industries for several
idiosyncrasy (Salk and
reasons including: cultural
Brannen, 2000), governmental
regulations/policies
(Morishima, 1995), competitive priorities (Boxall
and Steeneveld, 1999), and adoption of managerial
practices, such as JIT and quality management (Snell
and Dean, 1992). Hofstede argues that national cul-
tures impact the attitudes and behaviors of employees
(Hofstede, 1980). In a single company study, he found
that cultural values varied signiﬁcantly by country
and region of the world.

Most of the empirical studies related to HRM prac-
tices have been conducted using data collected in a
single industry within one country (cf. Arthur, 1994).
Some studies used data collected from multiple in-
dustries in one country (cf. Huselid, 1995), and some
studies were conducted on data collected from a single
industry in multiple countries (cf. MacDufﬁe, 1995).
However, the central foci of these studies were not to
compare systematic differences that may have existed
in HRM practices in the different countries and in-
dustries in which the organizations operated. Empiri-
cal examination of broad-based HRM practices across
industries and/or countries is very limited in the liter-
ature (MacDufﬁe and Kochan, 1995; Ichniowski and
Shaw, 1999). Since we intend to identify generaliz-
able impacts of HRM practices on organizational per-
formance across countries and industries (H1), it is
important to understand the differences that may exist

in HRM practices in various countries and industries.
We investigate these differences below.

We use one-way ANOVA to identify differences
in HRM practices among plants operating in four
countries. The last two columns of Table 7 show the
values of the F-statistics and their levels of signiﬁ-
cance. F-statistics for all of the HRM practices are
found to be highly signiﬁcant except for the scale
representing manufacturing and human resources ﬁt
(MFGHRFIT). That is, mean efforts expended by
plants differed in all but one of the HRM practices
in at least two countries. Statistical insigniﬁcance of
the F-statistic for MFGHRFIT suggests that the level
of cooperation between manufacturing and human
resources in designing job descriptions and stafﬁng
activities did not differ signiﬁcantly by country.

Next, we conducted the Scheffe pairwise compar-
ison tests of mean differences to better understand
how HRM practices differed between each pair of
countries. This comparison revealed several important
aspects of HRM practices as they are used in differ-
ent countries. Employment insecurity is the highest
in Germany and the lowest in Japan. The well known
lifelong employment policy in Japan seems to be evi-
dent in this ﬁnding. Plants in Japan emphasized some
HRM practices signiﬁcantly more than plants in other

countries. These practices are: behavior and attitude
(BEHAVIOR), contingent compensation (CONT-
COMP), and incentives to meet objectives (INCEN-
TOB). Refer to Tables 2 and 3, and Appendix A for
deﬁnition and measurement of these and other HRM
practices.

Compared to other countries in this sample, plants
in Italy seem to be signiﬁcantly lacking in their efforts
in several HRM practices. These HRM practices in-
clude team activities (TEAMS), interaction facilitation
(INTERACT), training in multiple functions (MULT-
FUN), communication of strategy (STRATCOM), and
feedback on performance (FEEDBACK).

The training on job skills scale (JOBSKILL) mea-
sures if employees’ on-the-job skills and knowledge
are considered important and whether these are up-
graded on a regular basis to maintain a work force
with cutting edge skills and abilities. Plants in Japan
put signiﬁcantly more effort into training on the job
skills, while plants in Germany lagged behind other
countries in this HRM practice. We were surprised
by this observation since Germany, under a national
industrial and educational policy, offers apprentice-
ship training to secondary school students to facilitate
the school-to-work transition (MacDufﬁe and Kochan,
1995). Our expectation was that German plants would

show a similar proclivity toward developing job skills
in plants. We also note that German plants exhibit the
highest status differences (STATDIFF) among all of
the countries; Italian plants are second.

Again, we used one-way ANOVA to identify
plants’ differences in HRM practices in the three
industries. Table 8 shows that the F-statistics corre-
sponding to most of the HRM practices are insigniﬁ-
cant. The Scheffe pairwise comparison tests of mean
differences revealed that plants operating in the ma-
chinery industry seem to put signiﬁcantly less effort
into team activities (TEAMS), interaction facilitation
(INTERACT), training in multiple functions (MULT-
FUN), and feedback on performance (FEEDBACK)
than plants operating in the automobile industry (see
Table 8). A closer look reveals that these HRM prac-
tices are often emphasized in plants that implement
manufacturing practices, such as quality management
and/or lean production. The automobile industry was
at the forefront of the quality management and JIT
manufacturing revolutions in past decades (Soderquist
and Motwani, 1999; Womach et al., 1990). This
well-known fact probably explains the difference in
HRM practices. Also, the plants in the machinery in-
dustry exhibited signiﬁcantly higher status differences
(STATDIFF) than those in the electronics industry.

The general perception of work environments in the
machinery and electronic industries supports these
ﬁndings.

In addition to conducting one-way ANOVA as dis-
cussed above, the two-way interaction effects were
also tested using general
linear models. Only the
two-way interaction effect for the variable INSE-
CURE was found to be statistically signiﬁcant. This
is not surprising given our earlier ﬁndings which re-
vealed that this variable showed fairly high variance
across countries and industries.

In summary, we have found that HR practices vary
widely by country and to some extent by industry. This
is consistent with institutional theory when the insti-
tutions are taken to be country or industry. These in-
stitutions exhibit an important and pervasive inﬂuence
on the HR practices employed. National culture, in-
dustry competition and other factors may account for
the differences we observed among the HR practices
adopted in different countries and industries.

5.1. Hypothesis 1

This hypothesis is tested by hierarchical regression
analyses using PERFORM (Table 9) and COMMIT
(Table 10) as dependent variables. First, the country

and industry control variables (GERMANY, ITALY,
JAPAN, MACHINE, and AUTOMOBL) were entered.
Next, the HRM practices were independently entered
into the equation. For each of the dependent variables,
the results show that most of the HRM practices ex-
plain a signiﬁcant incremental level of the variance,
providing overall support for this hypothesis. Specif-
ically, for the dependent variable PERFORM, all hy-
potheses are supported except for hypotheses (a) and
(f). For the dependent variable COMMIT, hypotheses
(b), (c), (e), and (g) are supported and hypothesis (d) is
partially supported since the variable INCENTOB is
found to be signiﬁcant but the variable CONTCOMP
is not. In order for hypothesis (d) to be fully supported,
both INCENTOB and CONTCOMP had to be signif-
icant. We, however, ask the reader to exercise cau-
tion while interpreting results related to Hypothesis 1
due to the possibility of omitted variable bias since
the correlations between some pairs of HRM practices
are quite high.

Regression analyses show that employment insecu-
rity (INSECURE) and status differences (STATDIFF)
were not signiﬁcant for either of the two dependent
variables. In the literature, empirical evidence shows
that employment insecurity is associated with lower
performance (Delery and Doty, 1996). Therefore, we
were surprised that employment insecurity (INSE-
CURE) was not signiﬁcant. However, the correlation
matrix (Table 5) shows that employment insecurity is
negatively related to several HRM practices. These
HRM practices have positive associations with the
dependent variables. Therefore, employment insecu-
rity seems to hinder the development of other HRM
practices,
thereby minimizing the potential of the
HRM practices as a whole. Status difference (STAT-
DIFF) shows a similar relationship with other HRM
practices.

Additionally, contingent compensation (CONT-
COMP) was not signiﬁcant for the intangible perfor-
mance measure. The literature ﬁnds mixed impact of
contingent compensation on intangible performance
measure, such as organizational commitment. While
contingent compensation can sometimes motivate
workers to put forward their best efforts (cf. Henderson
and Lee, 1992), it can sometimes de-motivate them
(cf. Kohn, 1993a) because contingent compensation
can be perceived by the employees as a management
control mechanism. Here, the term “control” implies

management’s attempt to ensure desired outcomes by
trying to inﬂuence employee behavior (Lawler and
Rhode, 1976). Therefore, the more controlling the
employees perceive the compensation system to be,
the less organizational commitment it will engender
(Deci, 1972; Ryan, 1982). This probably explains
why we failed to observe a signiﬁcant relationship be-
tween contingent compensation (CONTCOMP) and
the intangible performance measure.

According to the behavioral approach to strategic
HRM, the mechanism through which a HRM system
contributes to operational performance is by eliciting
behaviors required to accomplish operational goals.
From that standpoint, the role of an intangible perfor-
mance measure (i.e. organizational commitment) as
a mediating variable in HRM system’s inﬂuence on
operational performance is worth being investigated.
This investigation is conducted as follows.

A variable Z is said to be a mediator of a relationship
between two variables X (independent variable) and
Y (criterion variable), if the following are true (Baron
and Kenny, 1986): (1) X signiﬁcantly affects Z, when Z
is regressed on X; (2) X signiﬁcantly affects Y, when
Y is regressed on X; (3) Z signiﬁcantly affects Y, when
Y is regressed on both X and Z. Table 11 shows the
results related to mediating effects of the intangible
performance measure (organizational commitment).
According to the criteria mentioned above, organiza-
tional commitment (COMMIT) acts as a mediating
variable for MFGHRFIT, BEHAVIOR, TEAMS, IN-
TERACT,
JOBSKILL, MULTFUN,
STRATCOM, and FEEDBACK. Thus, the analyses
conducted to test the direct impact of HRM prac-
tices on operational performance and the subsequent
analyses for mediating effects reveal the following.
INSECURE and STATDIFF seem to have no impact
on operational performance, CONTCOMP inﬂuences
operational performance directly, and the rest of the
HRM practices inﬂuence operational performance
indirectly through the mediating variable COMMIT.

INCENTOB,

5.2. Hypothesis 2

The proﬁle deviation method (Drazin and Van de
Ven, 1985) is used to test this hypothesis. There are
three steps in this method: (1) identifying the ideal
proﬁle; (2) calculating misﬁt; (3) linking misﬁt with
organizational performance. We completed the ﬁrst

GERMANYi, ITALYi, and JAPANi are three indica-

Table 12 shows the results of the hierarchical re-

MISFIT is entered into the Eq. (2). Two sets of equa-

niﬁcant and the coefﬁcient of MISFIT (β6) is negative

sis 2. The variable MISFIT is found to be negatively

related to the performance measures which implies
that as a plant’s HRM system deviates from the
ideal-type HRM system its performance suffers. Ad-
ditionally,
this relationship between MISFIT and
organizational performance was observed after con-
trolling for country and industry effects. We can,
therefore, conclude that this ideal-type HRM system
is valid for a plant regardless of the country or in-
dustry in which it operates. This ﬁnding indicates
that management choices concerning HR practices do
indeed make a difference even after accounting for
country and industry factors.

6. Discussion

Traditionally, the focus of a HRM system has been
short-term, and the system has been used as a bu-
reaucratic control mechanism to enhance efﬁciency
(Kalleberg and Moody, 1994). Now, practitioners and
researchers agree that human resources can be a source
of competitive advantage and should be managed
strategically. However, organizations are discovering
this is easier said than done. Results of the present
study show that differences in HRM practices exist in
plants operating in different countries. Although this
was previously implied in the literature, comparison
of a comprehensive list of HRM practices among
countries was lacking. We obtained mixed results
when the HRM practices were compared across three
industries. While the majority of HRM practices used
by plants did not differ by industry, we did ﬁnd sev-
eral HRM practices that differed signiﬁcantly among
the three industries. Particularly, the extent to which
some HRM practices are used in plants operating in
the machinery industry consistently laged behind that
found in plants operating in the automobile industry.
We ﬁnd overall support for Hypothesis 1 as most of
the relationships speciﬁed in Hypothesis 1 are found
to be signiﬁcant. Hypotheses (a) and (f), however,
were not supported for any of the two dependent
variables. Therefore, the proposed direct relationship
between employment insecurity and organizational
performance, and between status difference and or-
ganizational performance, cannot be empirically val-
idated. However, as mentioned earlier, employment
insecurity and status difference seem to hinder devel-
opment of other HRM practices, and thereby inﬂuence

the work environment and minimize the potential of
HRM practices as a whole.

The mediating effect analysis revealed that most
of HRM practices impact operational performance
indirectly through organizational commitment. This
ﬁnding is important as it reﬁnes our understanding
of the nature of relationship between HRM practices
and operational performance. Also, this ﬁnding sug-
gests that a manager intending to enhance operational
performance should create a conducive organizational
climate that fosters employees’ commitment to the
organization.

The ﬁndings of the present study also offer impor-
tant implications for several distinct trends observed
in the business world today. Many organizations
are going through globalization to take advantage
of proximity to suppliers, customers, and critical
resources, such as human resources. Another notice-
able trend has been mergers and acquisitions among
companies. Several of these mergers and acquisitions
are occurring between organizations operating in
different countries (e.g. Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
Corporation) and industries (e.g. Time Warner and
America Online). These trends pose a unique chal-
lenge for HRM (Legare, 1998; Lubatkin et al., 1999).
Researchers and practitioners have strongly empha-
sized that M&A provide a window of opportunity for
restructuring HRM practices in the combined (new)
organization (Galpin and Herndon, 2000). Organiza-
tions involved in mergers and acquisitions should take
this opportunity to evaluate their existing set of HRM
practices and make necessary changes to facilitate
post-merger integration. This is particularly impor-
tant if organizations involved in M&A are following
different HRM practices.

Our analyses show that plants operating in different
industries and/or countries use and emphasize HRM
practices differently. Therefore, which HRM practices
should a combined (new) organization choose when
M&A is taking place between organizations operating
in different industries and/or countries? By control-
ling for country and industry in our analyses, we were
able to empirically validate those HRM practices that
are expected to yield higher performance regardless
of the country and industry in which the plant oper-
ates. Therefore, one choice may be to institute these
HRM practices for the combined (new) organization,
ﬁne-tuning them according to the strategic intent of the

37

new organization. Thus, the ﬁndings of our study pro-
vide general directions for managers to achieve better
operational performance through HRM systems inte-
gration in cross-country and/or cross-industry mergers
or acquisitions.

Earlier attempts to empirically validate ideal-type
HRM systems have received mixed conﬁrmation
(Delery and Doty, 1996). Although support for Hy-
pothesis 2 in our study empirically validates an
ideal-type HRM system, it failed to show the ex-
pected level of variation explained. This is explained
as follows: by deﬁnition an HR bundle is a set of in-
terrelated and internally consistent HR practices that
are expected to create mutually reinforcing and syn-
ergistic impacts on performance (MacDufﬁe, 1995).
Therefore, the variation in organizational performance
explained by a HR bundle should be signiﬁcantly
greater than that explained by an individual HR prac-
tice in that bundle. However, results of our study failed
to show signiﬁcant increments in variation explained
(R2) for the HR bundle. Nonetheless, our results em-
pirically validate the proposed ideal-type HRM sys-
tem because as a plant’s HRM system deviates from
the ideal-type HRM system, the plant’s performance
decreases, and this relationship is statistically signif-
icant (the coefﬁcient of MISFIT (β6) is negative and
signiﬁcant).

7. Limitations, future research, and conclusions

An important threat to the validity of our ﬁndings
is the distribution of the number of plants in our sam-
ple. Ideally, we would have liked to use data from
the same number of plants for each country-industry
combination. However, this was not possible due to
missing observations. Although the number of plants
did not vary greatly among the three industries, the
number of plants varied quite a bit among the four
countries (see Table 1). For example, we have useful
data from more than twice as many plants operating
in Japan (39) than in the USA (17). Therefore, our
results may be more representative of Japanese plants
than American plants.

Another noteworthy concern is that we used percep-
tual measures to gauge organizational performance.
Although the use of perceptual measures is quite
prevalent in the literature, the use of objective mea-

sures is generally preferred. While the intangible
performance measure (COMMIT) is inherently per-
ceptual, the operational performance measure (PER-
FORM) could be measured using objective data.
Future studies can use objective performance mea-
sures at the plant level to check the robustness of our
ﬁndings.

We empirically showed which HRM practices are
expected to enhance performance. However, since
we used cross-sectional data, we could suggest lit-
tle regarding the process of implementation of these
practices or the causal relationship between use of
these HRM practices and organizational performance.
Two organizations may correctly identify which
HRM practices to implement, yet only one may suc-
cessfully attain higher organizational performance
because of differences in the implementation pro-
cess. Implementing these HRM practices is not an
easy task (Pfeffer, 1994); hence, a future longitudinal
study could focus on the dynamic nature of the HRM
practices and uncover the challenges of the imple-
mentation process at the plant level. A well-designed
research study using longitudinal or panel data can
also better address the issue of causality.

Contingent

compensation (CONTCOMP) was
found to be insigniﬁcant for the intangible perfor-
mance measure. Based on the literature, we specu-
lated that employees might have perceived that they
were being controlled by this HRM practice. As a re-
sult, while contingent compensation (CONTCOMP)
was found to be signiﬁcant for the operational per-
formance measure,
it was not signiﬁcant for the
intangible performance measure. Future research
can investigate when and why employees perceive
contingent compensation as controlling rather than
motivating and how this ill effect can be minimized.
Existing literature suggests that the level of trust and
type of relationship between superior and subordinate
may determine whether or not an incentive will be
perceived as controlling by the subordinate (Kohn,
1993b; Taylor, 1989).

Due to the limitations of our data, we did not
investigate the impact of organizational strategy on
these HRM practices. Further research is needed to
understand how an organization’s strategic context
inﬂuences the choice of HRM practices and its im-
pact on performance. Also, whether these ﬁndings are
generalizable across country and/or industry needs


38

S. Ahmad, R.G. Schroeder / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 19–43

to be investigated. Despite the compelling theoretical
argument, our study failed to show that HR practices
are synergistic. Delery and Doty (1996) have also
reported similar results. Future study may shed some
light on this matter by theoretically deriving and em-
pirically testing several context speciﬁc ideal-type
HRM systems.

Traditionally, the operations management literature
has paid little attention to human resources issues.
The present study brings some of these issues into
focus in the context of manufacturing plants operat-
ing in different countries and industries. These issues
cannot be resolved by isolated efforts made by oper-
ations managers or human resource managers. Their
combined and synchronized efforts are needed. Our
study provides empirical validation for the efﬁcacy of
the seven HRM practices proposed by Pfeffer (1998).
Although this was the focal research issue, the ﬁnd-
ings and implications of our study go beyond just
testing the potency of Pfeffer’s seven HRM practices.

Appendix A

Scales used to measure HRM practices

Speciﬁcally, the present study investigates the mediat-
ing effect of organizational commitment which helps
us better understand the nature of the relationship be-
tween HRM practices and organizational performance.
This study also evaluates HRM practices taking into
account country and industry contexts, thus making
the ﬁndings generalizable across countries and indus-
tries. Lastly, we empirically validate an ideal-type
HRM system for a manufacturing plant. The ﬁnd-
ings of this study are expected to help operations and
human resource managers recognize the potential of
these seven HRM practices and assist them in design-
ing HRM systems at the plant level to gain superior
performance.
