Abstract

A group of firms that is attracting attention are rapid-growth firms. These firms are of particular
interest because rapid growth is an indication of market acceptance and firm success. By studying rapid-
growth firms, researchers can help all firms better understand the attributes associated with firm growth.
Despite these positive outcomes, however, rapid firm growth is difficult to achieve and maintain.

This study adds to the literature through a quantitative content analysis of the narrative descriptions
of 50 rapid-growth firms and a comparison group of 50 slow-growth companies. The purpose of the
study was to draw from the narratives a list of empirically grounded growth-related attributes that are
associated with rapid-growth firms. The findings of the study resulted in the advancement of a
conceptual model of the attributes of rapid-growth firms in four areas: founder characteristics, firm
attributes, business practices, and human resource management (HRM) practices.

1. Executive summary

A subset of firms that are of particular interest to researchers and practitioners are rapid-
growth firms. Rapid-growth firms, which are defined in this study as firms with a 3-year
compound annual sales growth rate of 80% or above, provide an important stimulus to the
national economy.
rapid growth is frequently an indication of market
acceptance and firm success. Young rapid-growth firms, such as Apple Computer, Cisco
Systems, and Oracle, have spawned new industries and spearheaded the development of
innovative products and services. By examining rapid-growth firms, researchers can help all
firms better understand the attributes and behaviors associated with firm growth.

In addition,

Despite these positive outcomes, rapid growth is difficult to achieve and maintain. In fact,
only one in seven firms generate sustained, profitable growth (Zook and Allen, 1999). There is
no consensus in the literature regarding why rapid growth is difficult to maintain. Yet, published
surveys, along with our own field research, suggest that growth is a top strategic priority for a
large percentage of firms. As a result, we believe that additional research regarding the attributes
and behaviors needed to achieve and maintain rapid firm growth is needed.

This study utilizes a quantitative comparative case study methodology to analyze a sample of
50 rapid-growth and 50 slow-growth firms. A literature review revealed that the four most
influential categories of variables, with regard to a firm’s ability to achieve and maintain rapid
growth, are (1) founder characteristics, (2) firm attributes, (3) business practices, and (4) HRM
practices. The data used in the study came from a set of narrative case studies provided by the
Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. The cases represent a subset of a larger database of firms
that were regional and national winner of the Ernst & Young LLP Entrepreneur of the Year award
sponsored by the National Center for Entrepreneurship Research at the Kauffman Foundation.
The findings from the study reveal that rapid-growth firms differ from their slow-growth
counterparts on a number of important dimensions. With regard to founder characteristics, the
founders of the rapid-growth firms in the sample are better educated, have a more compelling
bentrepreneurial storyQ [or motivation to be an entrepreneur], and have a higher incidence of
prior industry experience than the founders of the slow-growth firms. With regard to firm
attributes, the rapid-growth firms in the sample have a stronger commitment to growth, are
more involved in interorganizational relationships, and utilize a growth-oriented mission
statement to a greater extent than the slow-growth firms. With regard to business practices, the
rapid-growth firms in the sample add more unique value and have a deeper level of customer
knowledge than the slow-growth firms. Finally, with regard to HRM practices, the rapid-
growth firms in the sample emphasize training, employee development, financial incentives,
and stock options to a greater extent than their slow-growth counterparts.

The results of this paper provide some practical advice for entrepreneurs. First, firm growth
is not automatic. The characteristics of the founders of a firm, along with a firm’s growth-
related attributes, its business practices, and its HRM practices, make a difference in terms of
its ability to achieve and sustain rapid-growth. As a result, the process of growing a firm is
a
management challenge, similar to the other managerial challenges that entrepreneurs face.
This conclusion suggests that a firm should manage its growth consciously and deliberately,
and should carefully evaluate the growth-related implications of the choices it makes.

Startups should also work hard to include individuals on their founding teams that have
personal characteristics, such as related industry experience, which help a firm achieve and
sustain a rapid-growth rate.

The results of the study are triangulated against the existing literature to advance a
conceptual model that depicts the characteristics of rapid-growth firms. It is hoped that the
model will be useful to firms that are trying to achieve rapid growth or are presently in a
rapid-growth mode, and will provide a point of departure for researchers interested in
doing additional work in this important area.

2. Introduction

Despite the fact that the average firm in America grows at only a 3.5% rate, there exists a
subset of firms that grows in a more accelerated fashion. These rapid-growth firms, which are
an important stimulus to the national economy, are of particular interest to academics and
practitioners because rapid growth is often an indication of market acceptance and firm success
(Fesser and Willard, 1990). Young rapid-growth firms, such as eBay and Cisco Systems, have
spawned new industries and spearheaded the development of innovative products and
services. By examining rapid-growth firms, researchers can help all firms better understand the
attributes associated with firm growth.

Despite these positive outcomes, rapid growth is difficult to achieve and maintain. The
growth rates of companies often stall because of the demands associated with the growth
process. In fact, according to Zook and Allen (1999), only one in seven companies generate
sustained, profitable growth. The figures are even lower for rapid-growth firms. According to
the National Commission on Entrepreneurship (2001), a rapid-growth firm is a firm that grows
its employment by at least 15% per year. A study by the commission found that only 4.7% of
businesses that existed in 1991 grew their employment by at least 15% per year or at least
doubled their employment over the 5 years from 1992 to 1997. In an earlier study, Hambrick
and Crozier (1985) suggested that coping with the stresses imposed by instant size, a sense of
infallibility, internal turmoil, and extraordinary resource needs are persistent challenges that
managers of rapid-growth firms face. Missteps in the management of any one of these
challenges might lead to the failure of an otherwise successful rapid-growth firm.

Despite of the challenges associated with rapid growth, numerous surveys (e.g., Deloitte and
Touch LLP and Wirthline Worldwide, 1996) suggest that growth is a top strategic priority for a
large percentage of firms. Rapid growth, however, is not a random or chance event, but is
associated with specific firm attributes, behaviors, strategies, and decisions. The purpose of this
study is to add to the literature on rapid-growth firms by comparing the key attributes of 50 rapid-
growth firms with those of 50 slow-growth companies. By using a quantitative content analysis
of the narrative descriptions of these 50 rapid-growth and 50 slow-growth firms, this study hopes
to draw distinctions in the key attributes between rapid-growth and slow-growth companies and
provide prescriptive advice to executives who wish to increase their firms’ growth potential.

The study proceeds in the following manner. First, a review of the literature on rapid growth
is conducted. Second, a quantitative content analysis is presented, including a discussion of the


666

methodology, the sample, and the results. Finally, we present the study’s major contributions
and make several observations regarding the present state of research on rapid-growth firms.

3. Literature review

The literature on rapid-growth firms has focused on whether there are systematic
differences between rapid-growth firms and their slow-growth counterparts, and what these
differences are. In a review of 55 research articles on firm growth published between 1989
and 1996, Delmar (1997) concluded that there is little agreement on what factors affect
growth. In a more recent article, Delmar and Davidsson (1998, p. 399) remarked that
despite increased research efforts, our knowledge about high-growth businesses is bstill
very limited.Q Similarly, after reviewing 68 studies on firm growth and performance,
Wiklund (1998) characterized the literature as bhighly fragmented.Q

To review the literature, we examined 106 articles, book chapters, and books on firm growth
and performance from the entrepreneurship, management, and economics literatures. A
summary of our findings is provided in Table 1. Contrary to prior beliefs that the literature on
firm growth is fragmented or limited, the implications from Table 1 suggest the literature is
rather rich and mature. As shown in the table, we found that the literature on rapid-growth firms
highlights four major areas: founder characteristics, firm attributes, business practices, and
human resource management (HRM) practices. Each of these areas is briefly discussed below.

3.1. Founder characteristics

The relationship between founder characteristics and firm growth is important for at least
three reasons. First, it is widely believed that the founders of a firm place a lasting bstampQ on
their companies that influences the cultures and behaviors of their firms (Mullins, 1996). For
example, for years after the death of Walt Disney, Disney executives, when confronted with an
important decision, would often ask aloud bWhat would Walt do?Q (Collins and Porras, 1994).
Similarly, Hewlett–Packard’s Rules of the Garage institutionalizes the values of its innovative
founders. Second, investors and others often assess the potential of a new venture by evaluating
the attributes of its founders. One of the most important criterions used by venture capitalists,
for example, in deciding whether to fund a firm is their perception of the entrepreneur’s or team
of entrepreneurs’ ability to successfully launch the venture. Third, launching a new firm is a
challenging process. As a result, individual difference variables, such as educational level
achieved and prior industry experience, have in many instances been found to be critical in
successfully launching a new firm. In the following sections, a brief review of the research on
the most widely studied founder characteristics is presented.

3.1.1. Relevant industry experience

The impact of relevant industry experience on an entrepreneur’s ability to successfully
launch and grow a firm has been studied. Here, the notion is that entrepreneurs with experience
in the same industry as their current venture will have a more mature network of industry

Founders with experience in the
same industry as their new venture
should have better established
professional networks and more
applicable marketing and
management expertise than
founders without relevant
industry experience.
Evidence suggests that important
entrepreneurial skills are enhanced
through higher education.
Entrepreneurs with prior
entrepreneurial experience are
better accustomed to the
entrepreneurial process and more
likely to avoid costly mistakes
than entrepreneurs with no prior
entrepreneurial experience.
Founders with broad social and
professional networks have
potential access to additional know-
how, capital, and customer referrals.
New ventures that are started by
a team can provide greater
resources, a broader diversity
of viewpoints, more risk-bearing
ability, and a broader array of ideas
than ventures started by individuals.

A growth-oriented vision and/or
mission statement clearly
communicates to relevant
stakeholders the importance
of growth to an organization.
A drive and commitment to
achieve rapid growth is
frequently cited in the literature
as a necessary precursor for
successful rapid growth.
Interorganizational relationships
help firms share costs, increase
speed to market, gain economies
of scale, and gain access to
essential resources, knowledge,
and foreign markets.
Planning helps a firm organize
for growth and address the
relevant managerial and
strategic issues necessary to
maintain rapid growth.

A firm in a geographic area that
is near important external sources
of knowledge will have better
access to the knowledge and
will be able to substitute a portion
of the externally derived knowledge
for more expensive, internally
generated knowledge.

It typically requires fewer
resources to service a small
number of customers
(i.e., high buyer concentration)
than a large number of customers
(i.e., low buyer concentration).

The creation of products and/or
services that provide unique value
to customers stimulates growth
and attracts high-quality channel
partners.
The production and sale of
high-quality products and/or
services provides a firm an
important point of differentiation
and encourages repeat customers.
Innovation results in a constant
supply of new product and
service offerings, which
increases a firm’s revenues and
business reputation.
The utilization of new,
advanced technology is
important for a company to
create proprietary products and
compete in fast-growing
and dynamic markets.

contacts and will have a better understanding of the subtleties of their respective industries
(MacMillan and Day, 1987).

3.1.2. Higher education

In most studies, education has served as a proxy for entrepreneurial skills and abilities.
Sapienza and Grimm (1997), for example, argued that search skills, foresight, imagination, and
computational and communication skills are enhanced through college education. In addition,
specific forms of knowledge-intensive education, such as engineering, computer science, and
biochemistry, provide the recipients of education an advantage if they start a firm that is related
to their area of expertise.

3.1.3. Entrepreneurial experience

Prior entrepreneurial experience is one of the most consistent predictors of future entrepreneurial
performance (Singer, 1995). Launching a new venture is a complex task, and entrepreneurs with
prior start-up experience have a distinct advantage. In addition, experienced entrepreneurs are
more likely to avoid costly mistakes than entrepreneurs with no prior entrepreneurial experience.

3.1.4. Broad social and professional network

New firms suffer from liabilities of size and newness. As a result, their founders must
often bworkQ their social and professional networks to gain access to critical resources. For
example, an entrepreneur may call a business acquaintance to ask for an introduction to a
potential supplier or customer. Johannisson (1990) provides an excellent overview on how
entrepreneurs utilize theses networks to fuel growth.

3.1.5. Size of founding team

The literature on founding team size and firm growth has produced compelling results, with
larger teams having the advantage. Larger teams possess more talent, resources, and
professional contacts than a sole entrepreneur (Barkman, 1994). In addition, the psychological
support that the cofounders of a new business can offer one another is an important factor
(Fesser and Willard, 1990).

3.2. Firm attributes

Another subset of the literature on firm growth focuses on the relationship between firm
attributes and growth. Two important attributes are a growth-oriented vision and a commitment
to growth. Both of these attributes communicate that a firm is serious about growth and intends
to make growth an ongoing priority. Other firm attributes that facilitate growth include planning,
interorganizational relationships, an opportune geographic location, and a focused strategy.

3.2.1. Growth-oriented vision and mission

A growth-oriented vision, whether it is articulated through a vision, mission, or values
statement, helps crystallize the importance of growth and ensures that decisions are made with
growth in mind (Kim and Mauborgne, 1997). Doorley and Donovan (1999) reported that nearly


672

B.R. Barringer et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 663–687

60% of the rapid-growth firms in their study had put their growth vision in writing, whereas
only 15% of the slow-growth firms had done the same.

3.2.2. Commitment to growth

This variable emphasizes the extent to which a firm articulates growth as an objective, as
well as its commitment to the execution of an ongoing growth strategy. For growth to occur, it
must make its way into the deliberate choices of owners/managers. Kolvereid (1992) provides
an excellent overview of the commitment to growth literature.

3.2.3. Participation in interorganizational relationships

Interorganizational relationships include joint ventures, networks, consortia, alliances, trade
associations, and interlocking directorates (Barringer and Harrison, 2000). Participation in joint
ventures, networks, and alliances can accelerate a firm’s growth by providing it access to its
partner’s resources, managerial talent, and intellectual capabilities (Braggs, 1999). The primary
benefits of participation in trade associations are quick access to industry-related information,
the opportunity to network with industry peers, and collective lobbying (Bluedorn et al., 1994).

3.2.4. Planning

The literature on planning suggests that firms that plan in a conscientious, thorough manner
increase their chances of reaching their growth objectives. For example, Duchesneau and Gartner
(1990) found that a number of aspects of planning, including assessing the market, considering a
number of functional areas, and devoting more time to planning are all related to firm success.

3.2.5. Geographic location

Another growth-related attribute is locating in a region that facilitates the absorption of
external knowledge (Cooper and Folta, 2000). Product or service knowledge tends to be
localized, creating bknowledge spilloversQ (Jaffe et al., 1993). The Silicon Valley, Route 128,
and the Cambridge Region in the United Kingdom are well known clusters of high-tech firms.
These clusters allow employees of various firms to network with one another and make it easier
for the firms to gain access to specialized suppliers, scientific knowledge, and technological
expertise indigenous to the area.

3.2.6. High buyer concentration

Typically, the decision to concentrate on a small number of customers is associated with a loss
in bargaining power and diminished profits. Rapid-growth firms, however, often face constrained
resources and must be careful to not spread themselves too thinly (Bantel, 1998). In addition,
broader products and markets place greater demands on the firm, making it more difficult to
manage (Roure and Keeley, 1990). As a result, a common piece of advice given to rapid-growth
firms is to focus on a narrow set of markets and customers, rather than be too aggressive.

3.3. Business practices

Along with firm attributes, there are several key business practices that typify successful

rapid-growth firms.


B.R. Barringer et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 663–687

673

3.3.1. Creating unique value for customers

A firm’s ability to create unique value is an important attribute for achieving and
maintaining rapid growth (Kim and Mauborgne, 1997). A firm creates unique value by
providing a new or more affordable way of accomplishing a task, solving a problem, or
satisfying a need that was at best inconveniently satisfied in the past.

3.3.2. Product superiority

Another business practice that facilitates firm growth is product superiority or quality
(Harrison and Taylor, 1997; Roure and Keeley, 1990). Product quality contributes to rapid
growth in a number of direct and indirect ways, including easing market entry and establishing a
basis of differentiation in fast-growth markets.

3.3.3. Innovation

The precursors to creating unique value are innovation and research and development
(R&D). There are substantial literatures that suggest that firm growth is stimulated by both
innovation (Deeds et al., 1999) and R&D (Chakrabarti, 1990). These practices are facilitated by
locating in a region that provides opportunities for knowledge spillovers and participation in
interorganizational relationships.

3.4. Human resource management practices

The final category of variables examined in this review is HRM practices. This research is based
on the premise that a firm’s employees are a critical resource in the achievement and maintenance
of rapid growth, and that rapid-growth firms should manage their HRM practices accordingly.

3.4.1. Selective hiring

A critical priority for rapid-growth firms is to properly staff their organizations. According
to a survey by PricewaterhouseCooper’s Trendsetter Barometer (2000), the number one
concern of the CEOs of rapid-growth firms is proper staffing. The ability to attract and retain
skilled and capable employees increases the probability that a firm will be able to effectively
implement and maintain a growth-oriented strategy (Rich, 1999).

3.4.2. Performance-based incentives

Performance-based incentives, such as profit sharing and bonus plans, have become
increasingly prevalent in rapid-growth firms. These types of incentive plans are intended to
help firms attract (Zenger, 1992), motivate (Landau and Leventhal, 1976), retain (Rich, 1999),
and increase the productivity of employees (Weitzman and Kruse, 1990). Performance-based
incentive plans also help firms share business risks with their employees and conserve cash.

3.4.3. Stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans

Despite recent skepticism over their effectiveness, stock options and employee stock
ownership plans are becoming increasingly prevalent in rapid-growth firms. Stock options are
unique in their ability to offer substantial rewards to their recipients.

In summary, the studies cited above provide a comprehensive list of the factors that
potentially enable firms to achieve and maintain rapid growth. In the following section, we
introduce a quantitative content analysis methodology that is used to identify the factors that
most strongly differentiate rapid-growth firms from their slower-growth counterparts. The
paper concludes with a presentation of the results and a discussion of their implications for
researchers and entrepreneurs.

4. Methodology

4.1. Sample

The data used in this study came from a randomly selected set of narrative case studies
provided by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. The cases represent a subset of a larger
database of narratives from entrepreneurs that were regional or national winners of the Ernst
& Young LLP Entrepreneur of the Year award sponsored by the National Center for
Entrepreneurship Research at
the Kauffman Foundation. The Entrepreneur of the Year
program recognizes the achievements of U.S. entrepreneurs in 11 different categories, ranging
from manufacturing to health care. The cases are about 3000 words long (about three to four
single-spaced, typewritten pages). The narratives follow a format prescribed by a standard
form, and include information about the entrepreneur’s current venture in the following areas:
(1) type of business and current activity, (2) management team, (3) culture/values/incentives,
(4) innovative approaches, and (5) future plans. Each of the narratives we received was
accompanied by sufficient financial information for us to compute a 3-year compound annual
growth rate. This information is archival. Before a firm is designated a regional or national
winner of the award, it must submit financial statements that are verified by the selection
board. Even though the Entrepreneur of the Year award is given to individuals, rather than
companies, the narrative portion of the application is weighted heavily towards a description
of the firm the entrepreneur currently leads. As a result, we felt justified using the narratives
to study both entrepreneurs and the organizations they lead.

For the purpose of this study, we define a rapid-growth firm as one with a 3-year
compound annual growth rate of 80% or higher, and a slow-growth firm as one with a 3-year
compound annual growth rate of 35% or lower. To obtain data for analysis, we selected a
random sample of the narratives from 50 rapid-growth firms and 50 slow-growth firms. Table
2 contains demographic statistics pertaining to the sample along with t tests to compare the
rapid-growth firms against the slow-growth firms on number of employees, annual sales, 3-
year compound annual growth rate, and firm age. As shown, the 3-year compound annual
growth rate for the 50 rapid-growth firms ranged from a low of 80% to a high of 897%, with
an average growth rate of 166.32%. In contrast, the 3-year compound annual growth rate of
the 50 firms in the slow-growth group ranged from a low of  34% to a high of 35%, with an
average growth rate of 1.55%. Furthermore, there are no significant differences between the
two samples on number of employees or annual sales. As expected, the rapid-growth firms
are younger (10 vs. 20.67 years old).

In a separate analysis, we compared the rapid-growth firms in the sample against the slow-
growth firms to see if the rapid-growth firms are disproportionately bhigh techQ as opposed to
blow tech.Q To do this, we assigned an SIC code to all 100 firms in the sample. We then coded
each firm either bhigh-techQ or blow-techQ based on the Nevada Technology Directory’s list of
SIC codes that are considered to be high-tech. Sixty-six percent of the rapid-growth firms
were labeled bhigh-tech,Q as opposed to 50% of the slow-growth firms. The difference is not
statistically significant.

There were two obvious threats to the validity of the narrative data that we investigated and
were able to overcome. First, since the narratives are filled out according to a standard form, we
wondered if the questions on the form would elicit responses that would be too narrow to use for
the broad study we were contemplating. After reading a handful of the narratives, we concluded
that the questions are broad enough; in most instances, by answering the questions, the
entrepreneur essentially told the story of his or her firm and what has made it successful. To
substantiate this preliminary conclusion, we conducted a pilot study of 25 randomly selected
narratives (which were not part of the 100 narratives selected for the main study) to obtain a
preliminary understanding of the variables that were likely to emerge in the larger study. What
we found was that the major categories of variables discussed in the narratives paralleled the
major categories of variables identified in the literature review and Table 1. This process led us
to conclude that the narratives could be relied on to provide sufficient information to conduct a
broad study aimed at identifying the attributes of rapid-growth versus slow-growth firms.

Because the narratives were completed for the purpose of winning an award, the second
threat to the validity of the narratives was the potential for self-desirability bias. We were able to
set aside this concern for two reasons. First, if self-desirability bias were present, we would
expect it to be equal across both the fast-growth and the slow-growth firms. Second, the way the
narratives are evaluated discourages exaggeration and bravado. Each narrative is evaluated by a
panel of judges, first at the regional level, and then at the national level for the applicants that
make it that far. Many of the judges are past winners of the award. In addition, the judging
process is very thorough and complete, as explained in a book on the process by Ericksen
(2002), the global director of the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Ernst & Young. Combined,
these factors suggest that it would be fairly difficult for narratives tainted by social desirability
bias to make it through the judging process.

4.2. Method of analysis

The narratives were content analyzed with the assistance of the statistics software program
ATLAS/ti. ATLAS/ti is a powerful program for coding and interpreting textual data. The initial
coding was done by one author and was audited by a second author. Neither author knew
whether a firm was a fast-growth or a slow-growth firm during the coding. The narratives were
coded using standard content analysis techniques (Lincoln and Guba, 1985). The minor
discrepancies that existed between the coders were resolved by examining the data together.
The cases were initially coded at the sentence level with each substantive sentence assigned
to one or more of four categories. Consistent with the literature review and the results of the
pilot study, the categories were founder characteristics, firm attributes, business practices, and
HRM practices. The sentences were then analyzed to identify variables, such as prior
entrepreneurial experience or emphasis on planning. Examples of how the coding was done are
provided in Table 3. Although the categories identified in Table 1 were used to guide the
coding, the variables that emerged through the content analysis do not map perfectly with the
variables that were identified through the literature review. In these cases, either the variables
identified in the literature review were not present in the Entrepreneur of the Year Award
narratives, or the narratives did not contain enough fidelity for the content analysis to pick
them up. In several cases, variables that we did not find in our review of the literature emerged
from the content analysis and appeared important in the minds of the entrepreneurs in our
sample. These variables are identified and discussed in the results section.

In an effort to increase confidence in the reliability of the coding process used, a second-year
MBA student coded a randomly selected subset of 10 rapid-growth and 10 slow-growth
narratives. A third coauthor who was not involved in the original coding process also in-
dependently coded these 20 random narratives. The coauthor and the MBA student then
compared their results, coming to a consensus when they disagreed. Their combined results were
then compared with the original coding data. Interrater agreement between these two coding
tasks was 85.48%. That is, of the 420 codes created (20 firms times 21 variables), the two sets of
raters agreed 359 times. Interrater reliability was also stable across the rapid- and slow-growth
firms: 85.71% (180/210) for rapid-growth firms and 85.24% (179/210) for slow-growth firms.

5. Discussion of the results of the content analysis

Table 4 presents the categories and variables that emerged from the study. Throughout the
analysis, we were interested in the extent to which the firms in the sample bemphasizedQ these
variables. The frequency of emphasis for each variable, broken down by rapid-growth versus
slow-growth firms, is shown in the table. We chose this method of frequency analysis to ensure
that bvivid, but false impressionsQ (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990) were not regarded as
more meaningful and pervasive than otherwise might be inferred without such frequencies.

A one-tailed, Fisher’s Exact Test was used to test the differences between the frequencies
for the rapid-growth and slow-growth firms. As shown in Table 4, the rapid-growth firms
differed from the slow-growth firms with regard to their intensity of emphasis on 12 of the 21

variables identified. In general, the variables that emerged from the study are consistent with
the variables identified through the literature review, with several important exceptions.
Through the content analysis, several variables emerged that are not prevalent in the existing
fast-growth literature, and were bemphasizedQ to a significantly higher degree by the rapid-
growth firms as opposed to the slow-growth firms in our sample. These variables include
entrepreneurial story, training, customer knowledge, and employee development. Two other
interesting relationships were revealed. The rapid-growth firms in the sample bcreate unique
valueQ for their customers to a higher degree than their slower-growth counterparts. The fast-
growth firms also emphasize different forms of financial incentives for their employees to a
significantly higher degree than the slower-growth firms.

5.1. Founder characteristics

The rapid-growth firms differed from the slow-growth firms on college education,
entrepreneurial story, and prior industry experience. No differences were found for prior
entrepreneurial experience and firm started by a team.

Founders with prior experience in the same or a closely related industry were found in
76% of the rapid-growth firms in the sample and only in 24% of the slow-growth firms.
Apparently, related industry experience provides a founder with critical knowledge plus the
advantage of access to a network of contacts that can help a firm overcome liabilities of
newness and build a growth-oriented business.

The study also affirmed the importance of a college education. College education can
provide founders with the skills necessary to launch a venture, particularly if the venture is in
a technically oriented industry such as biotechnology or computer science. In other cases, the
years spent obtaining a college education help embed an individual in a social network that is
helpful in launching a business venture.

A new variable that we labeled bentrepreneurial storyQ emerged from the study. This variable
was assigned when an entrepreneur recalled the sacrifices made to start the business or when the

life experiences of the founders set them on the path to become entrepreneurs. The inclusion of
either of these forms of information, which were significantly more prevalent in the rapid-
growth firms versus the slow-growth firms in the sample, suggests that the individuals that
launched rapid-growth firms either overcame significant obstacles to start their firms or had a
longtime objective to become a business owner. The insight provided by this variable is that
launching and growing a successful firm may have a higher valence for some founders than
others. Founders that associate the success of their venture with sentiments like beverything
rides on the companyQ and bthe thought of working for someone else never occurred to meQ
(quotes taken from the narratives of rapid-growth firms in our sample), may attach a degree of
importance to the success of their ventures that results in extreme levels of motivation and
commitment to see their ventures succeed.

5.2. Firm attributes

The rapid-growth firms in the sample differ from the slow-growth firms on commitment to
growth, growth-oriented vision, and participation in interorganizational relationships. No differ-
ences between the two groups were found in the emphasis on planning or goal-setting variables.
With regard to commitment to growth, whereas researchers have found that growth is an
important objective for most firms, they have also found that the lack of growth can be
attributed to both external and internal factors, including motivational issues. As a result, the
intensity of a firm’s bcommitment to growthQ may motivate the members of a firm to make
growth a reality. A related but separate topic is the presence of a growth-oriented vision. A
growth-oriented vision may crystallize the activities of a firm and lead to the implementation
of purposeful growth-oriented activities (Kim and Mauborgne, 1997).

The final firm attribute that was emphasized to a significantly higher degree by the fast-
growth firms in the sample was participation in interorganizational relationships. Firms
participate in interorganizational relationships to co-opt a portion of their resource needs from
their partners. This is a common way for firms to speed up their growth trajectories.

5.3. Business practices

The rapid-growth firms in the sample differed from the slow-growth firms with regard to
creating unique value and customer knowledge. Creating unique value is defined as helping a
customer maximize utility, reduce costs, and/or increase organizational effectiveness in a unique
manner. The variable customer knowledge refers to maintaining a keen sense of customer needs.
Although the variable creating unique value is rarely discussed in the rapid-growth
literature, it emerged as a strong discriminator between the rapid-growth and the slow-growth
firms in the sample. The most compelling examples of this are firms that claim to have
established new paradigms in their industries, which exponentially increase the effectiveness
of their customers’ products or internal operations.

The second variable in the category of business practices that differentiated the firms in the
sample was customer knowledge. Fast-growth firms were more likely to report a keen sense
of customer needs and desires. Among the rapid-growth firms in the sample, it was common
for the words btrustQ and brelationshipQ to surface in the context of talking to or surveying
customers to better understand their needs.

5.4. Human resources management practices

The final category of variables examined in the study was HRM practices. The rapid-
growth firms in the sample differed from the slow-growth firms on the variables training,
employee development, financial incentives, and stock options. No differences were found in
selectivity in hiring, employee empowerment, and nonfinancial incentives.

Training has not received much coverage in the literature, but the incidence of mention of
an employee-training program was higher in the rapid-growth than the slow-growth firms. In
most cases, the firms reported the role of their training programs in helping them achieve their


B.R. Barringer et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 663–687

681

objectives or in equipping their employees for advancement. The fast-growth firms in our
sample also emphasized employee development to a significantly greater extent than their
slow-growth counterparts. It was apparent that rapid-growth firms depend heavily on the
abilities and efforts of their employees to maintain their growth-oriented strategies.

The final variables that differentiated the rapid-growth from the slow-growth firms dealt with
employee incentives. More rapid-growth firms in the sample provided their employees
financial incentives and stock options as part of their compensation packages. It is clear that
these incentives are provided to achieve multiple goals. These goals include eliciting high levels
of performance from employees, providing employees the feeling that they have an ownership
interest in the firm, attracting and retaining high-quality employees, and shifting a portion of a
firm’s business risk to the employees. A firm shifts a portion of its business risk to its employees
by providing modest salaries and generous bonuses that pay off only if the firm does well.

6. Summary

Most of the findings reported above affirm the existing literature on rapid-growth firms.
The characteristics of the founder of a firm, along with a firm’s attributes, business practices,
and HRM practices, are important in helping a firm achieve rapid growth. The results of the
study are important because they confirm the results obtained through conventional deductive
research, which is represented by the majority of the studies cited in Table 1.

Several new concepts emerged from our content analysis that had not been previously
considered in the literature. First, the variable bentrepreneurial storyQ was identified, based on
evidence in the narratives that some entrepreneurs make significant sacrifices to start their
firms. Some individuals might also have salient life experiences that set them on the path to
become entrepreneurs. These bentrepreneurial storiesQ can create a greater valence for success
with certain founders, which might spur them to push their firms onto a trajectory of rapid
growth. Some founders may simply try harder than others, which is a notion that is hard to
quantify but may nonetheless exist.

Second, in the category of business practices, the variable bcreating unique valueQ emerged
as a strong predictor of rapid growth. Although this variable is conceptually similar to
Porter’s (1985) concept of bproduct differentiation,Q the results of this study suggest that
unique value is a separate concept and refers to the ability of a product or service offering to
help customers maximize utility, reduce costs, and/or increase organizational effectiveness in
a unique manner.

Finally, the results of this study draw attention to the importance of HRM practices in
facilitating rapid growth as several variables not considered in the rapid-growth literature
emerged from our content analysis. First, emphasis on btrainingQ was found to be much
more prevalent in rapid-growth firms as it was mentioned twice as often in the fast-growth
narratives. Second, a clear distinction emerged in our content analysis in the reliance on
different incentive systems within rapid-growth and slow-growth firms. Whereas the use of
nonfinancial incentives was similar among rapid-growth and slow-growth firms, the former
were much more likely to report use of financial incentives and stock option plans.

6.1. Conceptual models

Fig. 1 is a conceptual model that summarizes the results discussed above. As shown in the
key, the boldface variables in Fig. 1 represent variables found significant in the present study.
The other variables were discussed in the literature review and are consistent predictors of
rapid growth as articulated in Table 1. The variables followed by a b*Q denote the variables
that emerged from our content analysis but were not uncovered by the literature review. These
variables represent the primary contribution of this study.

Several limitations suggest that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution.
First, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to make causal inferences. For
instance, we are not able to tell whether an activity like training predicts growth, or whether
the resources generated from growth makes training possible. A longitudinal study could
more carefully examine the specific nature of this relationship. Second, whereas the Fisher’s
Exact Tests used in the data analysis allow us to test the significance of the variables in the
study across growth rate, the analysis does not provide us an indication of which variables
provide the greatest contribution towards firm growth. Third, the study does not allow us to
determine if the variables work independently of one another, or in tandem. Finally, although
our list of 21 growth-related variables included in our study is comprehensive, it is not
exhaustive. There are likely other factors that contribute to a firm’s ability to achieve and
maintain a rapid growth rate.

7. Implications, observations, and conclusion

The results of the paper provide several important implications for entrepreneurs. First,
growth is not a random event. A firm’s growth-related attributes, its business practices, and its
HRM practices make a difference in terms of its ability to achieve and sustain rapid growth.
The growth-facilitating variables identified in this study are shown in Table 4. Entrepreneurs
who lead growth-minded firms may benefit by studying this table and considering the extent
to which their firms embrace the variables identified. For example, one of the strongest
findings in the study is that firms that have made a concrete bcommitment to growthQ are
more likely to achieve rapid growth than firms that have not made a similar commitment.
This is a finding that a growth-minded firm could implement at virtually no cost. Making
growth an important firm objective, and continually championing the importance of growth,
may create a context in which growth-enhancing measures receive attention and support.

A second implication of the study is that the personal characteristics of the entrepreneurs
who start a firm have an impact on the firm’s ability to achieve and maintain a rapid growth rate.
The most important variables in this area are relevant industry experience, college education,
and entrepreneurial story. It may benefit startups to pay attention to these variables, and include
individuals who exemplify one or more of these characteristics on their founding teams.

To conclude the paper, we would like to make three observations about the results of the
present study, the conceptual models depicted in Fig. 1, and the present state of the academic
literature on rapid-growth firms.

B.R. Barringer et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 663–687

First, none of the categories of variables examined in the study are holistic, they each study
rapid-growth firms from a narrow point of view. For instance, the literature on founder
characteristics focuses on the attributes that potentially provide one founder an advantage over
another in launching a firm that achieves and maintains a rapid growth rate. Although it is
temping to criticize the literature for organizing itself into neat categories, without much
integration across categories, it is impressive that these four categories provide concrete advice
to the managers of rapid-growth firms. In addition, each category, as shown in Table 1, contains
variables that have been shown to facilitate rapid growth in a number of different studies across
different settings. As a result, our thinking evolved during the course of the study, and we are
now more impressed with the breadth and depth of the literature on rapid-growth firms than we
were at the outset. As a result, we believe the results of this study contradict the claims made in
the introduction to the paper, which characterized the literature on rapid-growth firms as
fragmented and immature (e.g., Delmar and Davidsson, 1998; Wiklund, 1998; Delmar, 1997).
Instead, although much work remains to be done, the literature review conducted for this paper
suggests that the literature on rapid-growth firms is converging and provides convincing
prescriptive advice to managers. In our judgment, any manager who read representative samples
of the literature referenced in Table 1 and studied the results of this empirical study would
be much better prepared to lead a rapid-growth firm than a manager without this advantage.

The second observation is that although the literature on rapid-growth firms is converging,
there is a need for more integration across the categories of variables that are associated with
rapid growth. For example, whereas the literature on firm attributes does much to explain rapid
growth, the literature on firm attributes rarely cites the literature on HRM in explaining rapid
growth. As a result, stand-alone statements that emerge from a single category of variables such
as ban important precursor to rapid growth is innovationQ are not very helpful. Most managers
are aware of the importance of innovation. The challenge is determining how to achieve
innovation. In the context of HRM, this may mean the recruitment of new employees, the
implementation of specialized training programs, an improved employee incentive program, or
a host of other alternatives. The cross-integration of topics, like firm attributes and HRM
practices, will move the literature on rapid-growth firms forward and will enrich the debate.

Finally, the field of rapid-growth firms suffers from a noticeable halo effect. The majority
of the literature either implicitly or explicitly addresses the benefits of rapid growth without
fully discussing the potential pitfalls involved. There are many potential pitfalls and
unintended consequences associated with the path to rapid growth. For example, whereas it is
tempting to focus solely on the benefits of an employee incentive program like stock options,
if the options never pay out they may become a disincentive rather than an incentive. For
instance, an employee may be attracted to a rapid-growth firm as a result of its stock option
plan, work hard, and never realize a financial reward if the company’s stock price does not
appreciate. Worse yet, an employee may sign on with a firm, anticipate that the value of one’s
options will show a steady gain as a result of the past performance of the firm, and watch the
value of the options evaporate as a result of a broad retrenchment of the Nasdaq or Dow. The
point is that the managers of rapid-growth firms should be equipped with information on the
potential pitfalls as well as the potential advantages of implementing growth-stimulating
management techniques in their firms. We hope this study contributes to that dialog.
