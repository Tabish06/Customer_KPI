Abstract

There have been numerous studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its
relation to corporate performance. Recently, studies in this field have paid particular
attention to the method of measurement in order to identify the CSR activities. One of
the widely recognized measures to proxy CSR is the Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) score. This paper examines the relationship between Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) and corporate profit by testing the ESG performance score on the
firm’s Financial Performance (FP), specifically for Korea Stock Market (KOSPI) listed firms in
the period of 2008 ~ 2014. We use three separate individual Environmental, Social and
Corporate Governance (ESG) disclosure scores from Bloomberg for the CRS proxy
measure, as well as the Return on Equity (ROE), Market-to-Book Ratio (MBR) and Stock
Return for the FP measures. We found that the ESG disclosure scores (the measures of
environmental, social, and governance responsibility performance) in the Korean
corporations shows diversified results. Particularly, the environmental responsibility
performance score presents a negative (or U curve) relationship with FP, whereas the
governance responsibility performance score presents a positive (or inverse U curve)
relationship with FP. On the other hand, we did not find any statistically significant
evidence of a relationship between the social responsibility performance score and FP.

Introduction
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into
business models. CSR functions as a self-regulatory mechanism by which a corporation
ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law and ethical standards. Its aim is to
increase the long-term profits or survival of a firm through constructing positive public
relations and high ethical standards, in order to reduce the business and legal risk and build
shareholder trust. Accordingly, the CSR strategies of a corporation are tightly related to its
sustainable growth. To ensure sustainable growth, it is necessary for a company to make a
positive impact on the surrounding environment, as well as on its stakeholders, such as its
consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others. Beltratti (2005) and Jamali et al.
(2008) examined the positive relationship among CSR, corporate governance, and the
enhancement of the firm’s value. Furthermore, Beltratti (2005) concluded that by ensuring
the protection of the stakeholders, firms are more likely to survive in the long term, and

Aras and Crowther (2008) pointed out the significance of the corporate governance and the
subsequent sustainability of firm.

Thus, CSR has become a noticeable issue in the management literature, not only
from a theoretical point of view, but also from empirical methods’ point of view about
how to measure CSR activities (McWilliams et al. 2006; Dobers 2009; Nejati and
Ghasemi 2012). Attempts to identify the relationship between CSR and the perform-
ance of firms have been made by many scholars (Aupperle et al. 1985; Mittal et al.
2008; Crisóstomo et al. 2011).

Possible explanations for the lack of consensus and difficulties in measuring CSR have
been given in previous studies (Waddock and Graves 1997). One possibility is to attribute
this inconsistency to the multidimensional CSR concept and its interrelationship across
many disciplines; varying concepts and issues from strategic perspectives to human re-
source management, culture, and stakeholder/shareholder ones. Another research group
suggested that these unidentified and omitted explanatory variables (McWilliams and Sie-
gel 2000) made it difficult understand the latent mechanisms. Meanwhile, several studies
tested the existence of a relationship between a firm’s CSR performance and FP. However,
these findings are rather inconclusive in answering the question as to whether a firm’s per-
formance in terms of its corporate social responsibility can be translated into positive cor-
porate financial performance (FP). While such a relation (Margolis et al. 2009) sounds
appealing, this finding is still fragile, since a range of other studies have reported either
negative (Mittal et al. 2008) or mixed results (Schreck 2011). Most of those studies relied
heavily on the dataset provided by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD). Due to this
shortfall, Margolis et al. suggested the need to consider alternative measures of CSR per-
formance. Furthermore, those studies based on the KLD dataset only test for a linear rela-
tionship between a firm’s CSR and its FP. However,
in
microeconomic theory suggested that a non-linear set-up should be considered
(Manasakis et al. 2013, 2014; García-Gallego and Georgantzis 2009). A non-linear
relationship between CSR and FP is therefore in line with economic intuition, but
has rarely been tested, as pointed out in Barnett and Salomon (2012). For instance,
those firms which voluntarily engage in more socially responsible activities incur
higher corresponding costs at an earlier stage and, therefore, the increase in their
CSR score has a negative relationship with their FP if the study is done only
linearly. In this line of consideration, Nollet et al. (2016) tested both linear and
non-linear relationships between CSR performance and FP. They also used an
alternative third-party auditors’ data set, viz. Bloomberg’s ESG (Environmental,
Social, and Governance) disclosure score, as a new proxy for CSR.

recent developments

At this point, we would like to remark that our research is motivated by both Barnett
and Salomon (2012) and Nollet et al. (2016). For the test subject, unlike in the study of
Nollet et al. (2016), we chose Korea corporates and their CSR performance for two rea-
sons. Firstly, most of the CSR studies done so far have focused on Western countries,
such as the U.S. and Europe, rather than Asian ones, and we wanted to fill this geo-
graphical gap. Particularly, Chambers et al. (2003) reported that although there are
increasing expectations of socially responsible business in Korea, little research on this
topic has actually been done. Secondly, although the domestic literature in Korea
includes various studies on CSR, their focus has been on the cultural orientation (e.g.
Park et al. 2008; Kim and Kim 2010), ownership structure (Oh et al. 2011), financial


Han et al. Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility (2016)1:61–76

Page 63

reporting quality, and corporate governance (Choi and Pae 2011), which have no link-
age with FP. Therefore, going one step further, our study also aimed to fill this gap by
identifying the relationship between a firm’s CSR performance and its profit.

Our study is different from that of Nollet et al. (2016) from three viewpoints, which is
our benchmark. Firstly, as mentioned above, this paper considers Korean corporations.
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to test the relationship between ESG
disclosure scores and FP for Korean firms at home and abroad. For our study, the dataset
of 94 Korean firms (out of all 700 KOSPI listed firms) that have Bloomberg Environmental
Social Governance (ESG) Disclosure scores for the period of 2008-2014 was used.

Secondly, this study examines the effects of CSR (specifically separate ESG scores) on
FP by advanced methods, viz. the panel methods (random and fixed effect) and quasi-
maximum likelihood methods. On the other hand, Nollet et al. (2016) tested the relation-
ship only by the pooled OLS method. We examine the individual ESG disclosure score,
i.e. the environmental, social and governance, instead of the overall ESG composite score.
Note that Nollet et al. (2016) used the same method. This paper investigates which di-
mension out of 3 different Environmental Social Governance responsibilities has more ef-
fect on FP and how this effect is brought about. We try to answer the following questions.
Is there any relationship between individual ESG and FP? If so, is it positive or negative?
Furthermore, if the relationship a mixed or inclusive one, what would be the alternative
solution? For these reasons, we examine non-linear relationship.

Thirdly, our finding is interesting in the sense that it is basically in line with the study
of Nollet et al. (2016), but our finding shows a different pattern. We confirmed the
existence of a non-linear relationship in Korean corporations, similar to that shown by
Nollet et al. (2016) in US corporations. However, our non-linear relationship pattern is
different from theirs. For reference, Nollet et al (2016) found both a linearly negative
and non-linearly U curve relationship only between GDS (Governance Disclosure
Score, proxy for CSR effort in Governance dimension) and FP in US corporations. By
contrast, we observed that the same relationship exists for Korean firm between EDS
(Environmental Disclosure Score, proxy for CSR effort in Environmental dimension)
and FP, but not between GDS and FP. For GDS, we found the opposite pattern (i.e., a
linearly positive and non-linearly inverse U curve relationship) compared to what
Nollet et al (2016) found. On the other hand, we did not find any empirical evidence
on the relationship between SDS (Social Disclosure Score) and FP. This is the same
finding as that of Nollet et al. (2016) in SDS for US firms.

Literature review and ESG overview
CSR and FP
From the earliest classic studies by Bowen (1953), Eells and Walton (1961), McGuire
(1963), Carroll (1979), the importance of CSR and its impact on society has been ex-
plored from various viewpoints. However, their opinions are divided on the need for
corporate CRS. Some studies with a positive appraisal of CSR argued that ‘a corpor-
ation has a duty to society’ (Andrews 1973; Davis and Blomstrom 1975; Carroll 1979;
Drucker 1984; Epstein 1987), whereas others reported that ‘a corporation only has the
duty to maximize its benefit within the fence of law and minimum ethical restrictions’
(Levitt 1958; Friedman 1970).


Han et al. Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility (2016)1:61–76

Nonetheless, in the 2000s, various studies identified CSR as a source of competitive
advantage (e.g. Russo and Fouts 1997; McWilliams and Siegel 2011). Donaldson and
Preston (1995) and Porter and Kramer (2006) investigated whether a strategic CSR
activity enhances the competitive advantage of the firms. Baron (2008) argued that CSR
activities could be a productive investment. He concluded that CSR helps firms to
attract consumers who value CSR expenditures but do not mind paying more for the
corporate executives or the employees whose personal values are aligned with CSR.
Baron (2008) suggested that some investors might value CSR more, even though it
could lower financial profit in the short-run, because they are satisfied by owning such
a firm that makes socially responsible expenditures. On the other hand, Besley and
Ghatak (2007) found that breaking CSR promises will result in lower profits, whereas
more responsible firms will earn higher profits due to their reputational premium. In
this regard, Benabou and Tirole (2010) raised the question as to whether CSR helps
the firm in the long run. Margolis et al. (2007) found that CSR engagement helps
firms to gain a competitive advantage. They reported a positive relation between CSR
and performance except in two percent of cases. The role of governance in CSR is
also important. Several studies found the importance of sustainable development
issues, such as stakeholder dialogue and core values, and of embedding these issues
into the firm’s strategy. The study of Beltratti (2005), as well as that of Jamali et al.
(2008), found a positive relationship between CSR and corporate governance. Beltratti
(2005) concluded that by ensuring the protection of the stakeholders, firms are more
likely to survive in the long term. Jamali et al. (2008) found that CSR and corporate
governance strengthen each other. Furthermore, Aras and Crowther (2008) stressed
the significance of the corporate governance and the subsequent sustainability of
firm.

Meanwhile, empirical analysis has been inconclusive as to whether adopting CSR has
a positive or negative effect on a firm’s FP. This is because the empirical findings were
divided. The first group of literature finds a positive relationship between CSR and FP.
The works of Orlitzky et al. (2003), Wu (2006), and Margolis et al. (2007) in manage-
ment studies found a significant positive relationship between CSR and FP (Peiris and
Evans 2010). The study of Barnett and Salomon (2006, 2012) in finance also suggested
that firms with a higher CSR index score have better performance compared to those
with a lower CSR score. The longitudinal study by Margolis et al. (2009) conducted
from 1972 to 2007 also suggests the positive effect of CSR on accounting and market-
based profits.

On the contrary, the second literature group argues that CSR has a negative effect on
FP. Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) suggested the unfavorable effect of CSR. They
found the possibility of the market reacting negatively to news of companies joining an
environmentally friendly program, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency’s
Climate Leaders program, due to the anticipated negative effect on its financial
performance.

Lastly, the third group of Brammer and Millington (2008) argued that a positive or
negative relationship can occur depending on the level of CSR. They also provided
some empirical evidence for the existence of a U shaped relationship between CSR and
FP. Although they did not specifically hypothesize a U shaped relationship, they found
evidence that the highest and lowest levels of CSR were associated with the highest


Han et al. Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility (2016)1:61–76

Page 65

levels of FP based on the firm-level data. However, in their study, CSR was represented
by only one variable (i.e. corporate charitable), which is one of its limitations.

In light of the third group, Mittal et al. (2008) provided the rationale for a negative
CSR-FP relationship. That is, when the expected relationship between CSR and FP is U
shaped, the negative relationship could be observed at an earlier stage of CSR effort
because the cost of CSR caused the initial downward slope of the U curve. Supporting
the conjecture of Mittal et al. (2008), Nollet et al. (2016) empirically proved the exist-
ence of a U curve shaped relationship between corporate governance and FP in US cor-
porations, and this is the first empirical finding of a U curve relationship in the CSR
literature up until now.

Summarizing the above literature shows that the literature findings have been mixed
until now, and so further research is needed. On this basis, our study examines the
relationship between CSR and FP in Korean corporations. In Korea, recently, various
studies of CSR have been conducted on cultural orientation, ownership structure and
CSR, and on financial reporting quality, corporate governance and CSR. However, none
of them analyzed the relationship between CSR and FP. Thus, we attempt to determine
the effect of CSR on FP in Korean firms listed on the Korea (KOSPI) stock markets.
For the analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the activities dataset of the
individual ESG disclosure scores from Bloomberg in the period of 2008 to 2014 was
used as its proxy.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) overview
Most of the analyses of CSR appear in corporate sustainability reports. However, relying
on the individual corporate CSR report has intrinsic shortcomings, such as a biased
disclosure problem due to the deficiency of the firm’s revelation mechanism, viz. reveal-
ing only the firm’s favorite interpretation of its CSR and its operationalization (Butz
and Pictet 2008). Thus, to investigate the relationship between CSR and FP unbiasedly,
several studies examined the relationship based on third party ratings of environmental,
social and corporate governance.

Practically, the ESG disclosure score is used as one of the major indexes in the identi-
fication of CSR effort. It is used to gain an understanding of the overall CSR activities;
how corporations develop CSR issues with respect to their objectives and strategies for
long-term growth, how they manage risks and other organizational characteristics in
terms of general management practices, and so on. Originally, ESG terminology first
appeared in the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment and then in a
number of companies’ CSR reports (Davis and Stephenson 2006). Although there is no
clear understanding of this concept yet, ESG score has been practically used by major
business consulting firms. Bassen and Kovacs (2008) argued that ESG score monitoring
is important to implant CSR practically, as well as delivering ESG information in order
for investors to assess a corporation’s risks and opportunities. Particularly, scoring indi-
cators such as the environment activity (environmental scores and environmental fac-
tors), social responsibility (number of employees, employee turnover ratio, employee
unionized, women in management, women in employees) and governance mechanisms
(size of the board, independent directors, board duration, board meetings per year,
women on board) is important.


Han et al. Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility (2016)1:61–76

Page 66

Meanwhile, because ESG issues are extra-financial attributes, ESG scores could lack
the consistency and standardized definitions (Peiris and Evans 2010) necessary for their
comparison. Even with quantified data, it is difficult to compare them with the informa-
tion delivered by peers and across periods. The ESG disclosure scores used in other
studies faced the problem, particularly in terms of their objectivity. As a matter of fact,
there are companies which are uncooperative in providing the information necessary to
assess the impact of their ESG factors on FP (financial performance) or cases where the
ESG score provided by the company lacks consistency. In order to resolve these prob-
lems or minimize the ESG measurement bias, this study use the ESG scores provided
by Bloomberg, which is a third-party data collecting institution that cares very much
about its own reputation for accumulating accurate data.

As shown in the literature review, there are no consistent findings on the relationship
between overall CSR and FP yet. We suspected that using the combined ESG score might
result in mixed findings or non-significant test results. Thus, we consider the effects of
the three individual ESG scores on FP separately, instead of the overall ESG score. As a
matter of fact, Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016) conducted their study in the same way
as ours. They tested for the effects of GDS, SDS, and EDS on FP separately.

We describe the individual ESG score in more detail below. Firstly, the Environmental
Disclosure performance Score (EDS) is designed to address the business environment and
the relationship between business and society. EDS is known to cover the corporation’s dis-
closure policy issues on their CO2 emissions, energy consumption, total waste, energy effi-
ciency policy, and emissions reduction policy. Secondly, the Social Disclosure performance
Score (SDS) covers the company’s disclosure policy on the number of employees, employee
turnover ratio, number of unionized employees, percentage of women in management, per-
centage of women employees, and so forth. Both of these scores (EDS and SDS) are likely
to be affected by the firm’s CSR spending. Thirdly, the Governance Disclosure performance
Score (GDS) is designed to reflect the corporate governance structure.1

Given the above CSR literature and description of ESG, our research questions the

following two hypotheses.

Hypothesis 1. There is a linear and positive effect of Corporate Social Responsibility
performance (EDS, SDS, GDS) on Corporate Financial Performance.
Hypothesis 2. The effects of the Environment, Social and Governance performances on
Corporate Financial Performance are non-linear, viz. it implies that the relationship
could be convex (U curve) or concave (inverse U curve).

Data description and methodology
Data description
The paper examines the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporate
Financial Performance (FP) in both a linear and non-linear framework. Particularly, we
investigated the Korean (KOSPI) stock market. As measures of CSR, we used Bloomberg’s
Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) Disclosure scores: the Environmental Disclosure
Score (EDS), Social Disclosure Score (SDS) and Governance Disclosure Score (GDS). ESG
measures the listed firm’s CSR performance. We only use individual ESG score, technically
because the number of firms whose overall ESG scores are available is relatively too small


Han et al. Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility (2016)1:61–76

Page 67

compared to that of the firms whose individual ESG scores are provided, and also due to
our suspicion of the mixed result based on the overall score. To measure the corporate
Financial Performance (FP), we used the Return on Equity (as a measure of the firms’ per-
formance from an accounting perspective), Annual Stock Returns (as a measure of their
performance from a market perspective) and Market-to-Book ratio (MBR, as a mixed meas-
ure of both perspectives). We adopted the Market-to-Book ratio as a proxy for Tobin’s q as
in Dowell, Hart, and Yeung (2000). Like these authors, we constructed the MBR by dividing
the total of the firm’s market capitalization value plus book value of long-term debt plus net
current liabilities by the book value of total assets.

Our sample consists of the annual data of firms listed on the Korea Stock Exchange
(known as KOSPI firms) in the period of 2008–2014 if their ESG score provision is
available. This availability issue restricts the number of sample firms to 94 out of
around 700 listed firms. All of the data used in our paper are collected from the
Bloomberg terminal. Bloomberg’s ESG disclosure score is based on publicly available
company material. It covers a wide range of data from CO2 emissions, total waste,
energy efficiency, and emissions reduction policy to the share of women on the board
and the number of board meetings per year. Its scoring scale ranges from 100 to null
disclosure with a score of 0.

One limitation of using Bloomberg’s ESG Disclosure score as the proxy of CSR as in
Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016) is that, although it is not the corporates’ direct
ESG effort level itself, it is assumed to reflect firms’ ESG responsibility improvement
effort. Using the three individual ESG disclosure score provides us with the chance to
assess how each CSR activity of firm affects FP improvement and which of these three
ESG scores is the key driver for improving FP.

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the variables used. Table 2 provides the linear
correlation among the variables. Table 1 shows that the three ESG scores have differ-
ences. Out of the three scores, GDS shows the highest average value, whereas EDS has
the lowest mean value. Regarding the standard errors, GDS is the most stable, while
EDS is the least. Another observation regarding the three FP measures is that ROE
shows the highest volatility in its standard errors, as well as its minimum and max-
imum values, while Stock Return turns out to be the least volatile. Finally, other control

variables such as the leverage ratio and asset size after taking log function show moder-
ate volatility.

The correlations in Table 2 imply that the variables used are not highly correlated
with each other. The highest correlations are observed among the ESG scores, while
these high correlations among them do not lead to multicollinearity issues. Our VIF
test result indicates that there is no problem of collinearity. The correlations among
the financial performance (FP) measures are quite moderate. Furthermore, the correl-
ation between the three ESG scores and FP measure is observed to be the highest for
the MBR. In addition, some leverage is observed, implying that the firms’ risk indicator
is negatively related with all three FP measures. Meanwhile, the asset size shows a
mixed correlation with the FP measures.

Table 3 provides more detailed descriptive statistics of the three ESG scores’ mean
values over the study period. We observe that there is a general upward trend in the
three ESG score during the period of 2008 ~ 2014. This upward trend is slightly inter-
cepted in 2011 for SDS and in 2012 for both EDS and GDS as a small decrease is
observed in these two scores. However, the upward trend is immediately restored and
then becomes faster, except for GDS. Most of all, the fact that all three ESG scores
show constant increases over the study period indicates that the CSR commitment in
the Korean listed firms is quite resilient and noticeable, considering that there was no
sharp drop in these ESG scores during the financial crisis of 2008 ~ 2010. Another

observation is that both EDS and SDS exhibit a relatively high variance (as shown in
the standard errors) among the KOSPI firms, while this does not hold for GDS. This
observation suggests that the firms listed in Korea may have different levels of environ-
mental and social responsibility. Nonetheless, all of the firms show very similar levels
of governance responsibility.

where yit is the corporate financial performance (FP) measure (i.e. ROE, MBR and Stock
Returns) for firm i at time n. EDSit, SDSit and GDSit represent the firm’s social responsibil-
ity score in the three dimensions, i.e. environmental, social and governance responsibility
efforts, respectively. x′
it is a vector composed of control variables such as the leverage ratio
and log asset size, lagged dependent variables (yit-1), and cross-terms among ESG scores
(EDSit × SDSit, GDSit × SDSit, EDSit × GDSit).2 The choice of control variables could be
justified by recent CSR studies and other finance literature testing FP. The ∈ it term con-
tains both an independent idiosyncratic error term uit and unobserved firm specific char-
acteristics cit, such that ∈ it = uit + cit. Depending on the assumption on the unobserved
firm specific characteristics term, cit, we can run two different panel regressions. Firstly,
we run a random effect panel under the assumption that cit varies across time. Secondly,
assuming that cit does not change across time, we run a fixed effect panel. We also run
simple pooled OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression, as done by Nollet, Filis, and
Mitrokostas (2016). In this case, we need to consider the specific time period effect add-
itionally, because the pooled OLS does not distinguish the firms’ identity and time trend
on its own, unlike the above two panel models. Thus, we introduce Dt as a dummy vari-
able to capture the effect of the financial crisis during the period of 2008 ~ 2010 (Dt takes
a value of one for the years 2008 ~ 2010 and zero otherwise). For the pooled OLS, our re-
gression model is modified as follows:

¼β0þβ1EDSitþβ2SDSitþβ3GDSitþβ4x′

itþDtþ∈it

yit

ð2Þ

In addition, we run a quasi-maximum likelihood estimate to avoid the critique that in-
cluding a lagged dependent variable in the random effect panel might violate the indepen-
dency between the unobserved firm specific characteristics cit and dependent variables.3
Finally, we examine the quadratic relationship between the ESG scores and FP, as in Nollet,
Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016), in order to consider the possibility of a U shaped or inversed
U shaped relationship. This is about testing Hypothesis 2. Now the equation becomes:

Empirical findings
Table 4 reports the linear regression results for the effect of the three ESG scores on
FP (financial performance). The relationship between the ESG score and ROE is

reported in specifications (1)-(5), viz. the two types of pooled OLS, random effect panel,
fixed effect panel and quasi-maximum likelihood regression, respectively. The regres-
sion results suggest that, in the linear specifications, the effect of ESG on ROE is mixed
and insignificant for EDS and SDS. On the other hand, the effect of GDS is shown to
be positive with significance in specifications (2), (3) and (5). By the way, the ESG
cross-terms’ coefficients show mixed signs with no statistical significance. Therefore,
we can confirm that Hypothesis 1 holds only for GDS. This result is in line with
Margolis et al. (2009)’s empirical result of the positive effect of CSR on accounting
based profits. Also, the insignificance of the ESG cross-terms’ coefficients is the same
as that reported by Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016).

We also applied the same five types of regression methods to MBR and, then, the
Stock Return as dependent variables. However, we can only find three cases with any
level of significance in any of the ESG coefficients. Thus, we report only specifications
(6)-(8). Here, we can see that the effect of GDS on both MBR and Stock Return is
significant, whereas neither EDS nor SDS has any significant effect on these two FP
measures.4 In the latter cases, we can also observe significance in the cross-term of
EDSit × SDSit. However, with there being no significant effect of ESD and SDS at all, it
is difficult to find any meaningful implications. Finally, the lagged dependent variables
are significantly positive for ROE and MBR, but not for Stock Return.

Now we turn our attention to the quadratic models of equation (3) with the same
types of regression methods. In this case, we ignored the ESG cross-term for simplicity,
considering both their insignificance in the linear regression and increased number of
dependent variables (three additional ESG cross-term variables) in the quadratic model.
This quadratic model finds some interesting results: there exist both U shaped and
inversely U shaped relationships between the ESG scores and FP in Korea stock market.
This is in sharp contrast to the finding of only a U shaped relationship by Nollet, Filis,
and Mitrokostas (2016) in the US stock market.

Table 5 provides the quadratic regression results. The quadratic relationship of the
ESG disclosure scores with ROE is reported in specifications (1)-(4) for the pooled
OLS, random effect panel, fixed effect panel and quasi-maximum likelihood regression,
respectively. Firstly, we detected a U shaped relationship between the EDS and ROE in
specification (3). This supports Hypothesis 2. By the way, the U shaped relationship in
Table 5 is also related to the negative coefficient of EDS in the previous linear specifica-
tion (1) in Table 4, although the significance level is weak (i.e. 10%). Combining these
two findings on the coefficients of the EDS terms in Tables 4 and 5 explains well that,
while a negative relation between EDS and ROE may occur at an early stage of EDS in
Table 4 (i.e. linear framework), Table 5 (i.e. quadratic framework) picks up a positively
turning point in the latter part of a convexly U shaped relationship. We would like to
emphasize that our finding fills the gap between the negative relationship reported by
both Mittal et al. (2008) and Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) and the U shaped
relationship stressed by Brammer and Millington (2008), and Nollet and al (2016).5
Furthermore, although Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016) failed to find a U shaped
relation in US EDS (i.e. corporate environmental effort), our study on Korean listed
firms found a U shaped relation in EDS. The U shaped relation between EDS and ROE
(accounting-based FP measures) suggests that although investment in environmental
activities may not pay off immediately, it pays off ultimately after a certain threshold

level of EDS is accumulated. Based on the coefficients of the EDSit and EDS2
it terms in
specification (3) of Table 5, we can compute the threshold level of the EDS score. It is
calculated to be 45.2, which is far greater than the current average EDS value of 28.6
(as of 2014). This suggests that improving environmental responsibility is a costly pro-
cedure and that it may take a long time to reap the fruits. Until then, Korean firms
need to continue their EDS efforts.

Secondly, our quadratic test results identify an inverse U curve relationship of the
governance responsibility activities in the Korean firms. The results are in sharp con-
trast to the finding of only a U shaped relation in US GDS in the study of Nollet, Filis,
and Mitrokostas (2016). However, in reality, such an inversely U shaped relation is
understandable. This is a very general phenomena known as the law of diminishing
marginal returns in micro-economics. When the input variable has a positive effect on
the output variable, the extent of the contribution from the former to the latter starts
to diminish as the input amount accumulates. In the same way, when GDS increases,
the marginal extent of its contribution to the corporate financial performance starts to
diminish at a certain point. An interesting question is when the firm’s financial per-
formance stops increasing as GDS increases. We can compute the stopping point based
on the estimate of the coefficient from specifications (1) (2) and (4) of Table 5. It is cal-
culated to be in the range of 56.6 ~ 59.5, which is far greater than the 2014 average
GDS value of 48.6. This suggests that improving governance responsibility is still help-
ful to improve the ROE, at least for Korean firms.

We also ran the same quadratic regression procedures on MBR and Stock Return.
However, we found a few cases of significant ESG coefficients only with Stock
Return. Interestingly, we could not find any significant quadratic coefficients with
MBR. Thus, we only report the Stock Return cases in specifications (5)-(8) in Table
5. Among them, in specification (7), we observed an inversely U shaped effect of
GDS with moderate significance, whereas none of the other regressions showed any
significant quadratic relationships. Finally, when it comes to the control variables,
risk and asset size retain similar levels of significance to the linear model. Overall,
the signs of the control variables and coefficients remain unchanged, regardless of
the specification.

Conclusion
In the present study, we investigated the relationship between corporate social respon-
sibility and financial performance using the Bloomberg ESG disclosure score. Particu-
larly, we considered the three individual ESG scores, namely EDS, SDS and GDS. The
FP (Financial Performance) was measured using accounting-based measures, i.e. ROE,
a market-based measure, i.e. Stock Returns, and proxy of Tobin’s q, i.e. MBR. The con-
trol variables include the debt-to-equity ratio, asset size and lagged dependent variables.
For the sample, all of the firms listed on the KOSPI market, whose ESG scores are
available from 2008 to 2014, were used.

Overall, the results from the linear model suggested that a significantly positive rela-
tionship exists between GDS and ROE. Further analysis with quadratic terms provided
evidence of an inversely U shaped relationship between GDS and the accounting-based
FPs. Also, the quadratic test provided evidence of a U shaped relationship between EDS

and the accounting-based FP, which implies that CSR activity pays off only after a cer-
tain threshold amount of CSR has been accumulated. In other words, before this
point is reached, the required additional CSR expenditures may act to decrease FP at
early stage. The most prominent finding is the following. Through Tables 4 and 5, we
found evidence that ESG effort made in Korean firms will ultimately be beneficial.
Specifically, though EDS effort in Korea as of now shows negative profit for its initial cost,
it will ultimately make a profit in the long-run with further commitment. Meanwhile, im-
proving governance responsibility (i.e. GDS effort) is still fruitful in improving the firm’s
profit. Our study also indicated the need to use a broader measure of CSR to obtain a
clearer relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance.

As regards the management implications, our results can provide firms with useful
guidelines when considering their CSR investments. As our study suggests that there is
no immediate detrimental
impact or disadvantage from CSR activities, firms have
enough rationale to utilize their resources to improve their CSR and to enhance the ex-
pectations of their stakeholders. Overall, companies with effective CSR strategies can
increase the willingness of their stakeholders to invest in them.

The main limitation of this study is the fact that the ESG score fails to take into ac-
count the actual CSR actions a firm engages in. In other words, a firm’s ESG disclosure
activity index might differ from the type of CSR (or ESG here) effort they actually
made. This drawback is commonly shared with other measurements of corporate social
responsibility, as noted in the works of Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016) and Baron
(2001). The second limitation is derived from the limited number of samples. Out of
the 700 KOSPI listed firms, we were able to use the data from only 94 firms whose
ESG scores are available in Bloomberg. However, more significant results could have
been driven if the sample size was enlarged. The final limitation in our research is the
possibility that other variables could affect the associations among the CSR and finan-
cial performance. For instance, factors affecting the business environment (e.g., uncer-
tainty (Arag’on-Correa and Sharma 2003)) or degree of competition (Bagnoli and
Watts 2003) might influence the relationship. These issues will be the subject of future
research.

1The governance score, in particular, considers CSR oriented issues such as “internally de-
veloped statements of mission or values, codes of conduct, and principles relevant to eco-
nomic, environmental, and social performance and the status of their implementation”,
“externally developed economic, environmental, and social charters, principles, or other ini-
tiatives to which the organization subscribes or endorses” and “key topics and concerns that
have been raised through stakeholder engagement, and how the organization has responded
to those key topics and concerns, including through its reporting” (Bloomberg, 201, p74–75).
2Because size and risk have been suggested in previous articles to be factors that affect
both the firm’s performance and CSP (e.g., Ullman, 1985), each of these characteristics
was operationalized as a control variable. Size is relevant because there is some evidence
that smaller firms may not exhibit as many overt socially responsible behaviors as do
larger firms. Perhaps this is the case because, as they mature and grow, firms attract more
attention from external constituents and need to respond more openly to stakeholder
demands (c.f., Burke, Logsdon, Mitchell, Reiner, and Vogel, 1986). The management’s risk

tolerance influences its attitude toward activities that have the potential to 1) elicit savings
(e.g., a recycling or waste reduction effort, costly at first but potentially money saving in the
long run, such as 3 M Corporation’s Pollution Prevention Pays program; 2) incur future or
present costs (e.g., pollution control equipment that helps avoid future fines), or 3) build
(environmentally friendly firm) or destroy (perceived as unfriendly to certain types of
people) markets. As a proxy for management’s risk tolerance, we use the firm’s debt ratio.

3The maximum likelihood used in our study was pioneered by Bhargava and Sargan
in their study (1983), which incorporates all of the restrictions implied by the model in an
optimally efficient way. Their method has recently been implemented by Kripfganz (2015)
in a Stata command called xtdpdqml, which stands for “cross-section time-series dynamic
panel data estimation by quasi-maximum likelihood.”

5Mittal et al. (2008) and Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) attributed the negative
effect of CSR on FP to either the early massive cost of CSP affecting the aggregate
corporation’s financial performance or the negative market reaction to news of the
company joining the environmental friendly program. Meanwhile, Brammer and Millington
(2008) provided some support for the existence of a U shaped relationship between CSP
and CFP on the firm-level relationship. Furthermore, Nollet, Filis, and Mitrokostas (2016)
found an empirically U shaped relationship between the firm’s governance effort and its
ROA (Return of Asset) with US S&P500 listed firms.
