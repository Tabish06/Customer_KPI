Exploring the Geography of Corporate
Philanthropic Disaster Response: A Study
of Fortune Global 500 Firms

ABSTRACT. In recent years, major disasters have figured
prominently in the media. While corporate response to
disasters may have raised corporate philanthropy to a new
level, it remains an understudied phenomenon. This arti-
cle draws on comparative research on corporate social
responsibility (CSR)
and corporate philanthropy to
explore the geography of corporate philanthropic disaster
response. The study analyzes donation announcements
made by Fortune Global 500 firms from North America,
Europe and Asia to look for regional patterns across three
recent disasters:
the South Asian Tsunami, Hurricane
Katrina, and the Kashmiri earthquake. The results reveal
likelihood of
inter-regional differences

in addition to the
identification of home-region- and local presence effects.

Introduction

in December 2004,

In recent years, the world has experienced a number
of intense natural disasters such as the South Asian
Tsunami
the ﬂooding of
New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in August
2005 and remote villages in Kashmir leveled by an
earthquake in October 2005. While it is usual for
national governments, non-governmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), and intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs) to take the lead in relief efforts, companies
have increasingly emerged as major players in disaster
response. Not only do companies donate cash to help
fund relief and reconstruction efforts;
they also
provide goods and services as well as playing key
roles in logistics and support activities (Fritz Institute,
2005). While systematic research is only recently
beginning to shed light on this type of organizational

behavior; data
widespread in the global business community.

indicate that

such behavior

is

For

recent

instance,

studies have found that
approximately half of the Global Fortune 500 ﬁrms
collectively contributed cash, goods, and services
valued at US$580 million to the Tsunami relief ef-
fort (Muller et al., 2006), and that 79 US ﬁrms had a
mean donation of US$934,600 to Tsunami relief
(Patten, 2007). The Network for Consumer Pro-
tection (2005) documented the donations of 23 large
corporations to the Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and
the Kashmiri earthquake and reported cumulative
donations of over US$263 million. The evidence
also suggests that these corporate contributions form
a substantial share of total relief donations: imme-
diately following the passage of Hurricane Katrina it
was reported that of the US$93 million in aid given
by Americans
to Katrina victims, more than
US$27 million had been donated by corporations
(Heher, 2005). In the same article Patrick Rooney,
research director at the Center on Philanthropy at
Indiana University, indicated that corporations were
likely to account for as much as one-third of the total
funds received in the Katrina relief effort. Addi-
tionally, preliminary research suggests that ﬁnancial
markets value disaster relief donations by ﬁrms. In an
event study based on 79 Fortune 500 ﬁrms, Patten
(2007) found that the US ﬁnancial market reacted
positively to announcements of corporate philan-
thropic donations to Katrina. Thus, not only does
this phenomenon of corporate philanthropic disaster
response (henceforth ‘CPDR’) appear to be an
increasingly important fact of business life, it appears
to form a signiﬁcant contribution to disaster relief
in addition to affecting ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial
(market)
performance.

reported donations

There are indications that companies vary widely
in their donation behavior. The Network for
Consumer Protection study cited above (2005)
observed donations ranging from a low of US$1,000
to a high of US$35 million. In their study, Muller
et al.
ranging from
US$38,000 to US$85 million in the case of the
Tsunami among Fortune Global 500 ﬁrms. While
the role of size and proﬁtability in explaining vari-
ation in donation values has been explored for both
‘9–11’ (Crampton and Patten, 2007) as well as the
Tsunami (Muller et al., 2006), the latter study also
noted some apparent variation in donation amounts
across countries and regions. Thus far, however, this
growing body of research has not yet explored sys-
tematically variation in the likelihood of ﬁrms to
engage in CPDR as well as variation in the amounts
ﬁrms give.

The literature on philanthropy and that on cor-
porate social responsibility (CSR) also suggests at a
general level that companies from different parts of
the world engage in these behaviors in different ways
and to varying degrees (Jose and Lee, 2007; Kolk,
2005; Maignan and Ralston, 2002; Pasquero, 1991;
Shen, 2004; Welford, 2005; Wokutch, 1990). Much
of this comparative research has been conducted at
the regional
level. For instance, Pasquero (1991)
suggests that the US represents ‘the mature model’ of
corporate philanthropy relative to European coun-
tries. Further, an exploratory study of 46 Asian and
European ﬁrms’ corporate sponsorship of charitable
causes and non-proﬁt organizations indicated dif-
ferences between the two regions that are rooted in
differences
in societal pressure and expectations
(Shen, 2004). Welford (2005) also showed that
managers from different regions pay attention to
different social issues.

The literature suggests that these differences in
philanthropic behavior are rooted in the differences
in pressures originating from the social structures in
which organizations are embedded (Galaskiewicz,
1997; Marquis et al., 2007). These institutional forces
(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983) are reﬂected in man-
agerial values (Schlegelmilch and Robertson, 1995),
stakeholder expectations (Brammer and Millington,
2004; Kolk, 2005), governance structures (Navarro,
1988; Useem, 1988), and culture (Egri et al., 2004;
Katz et al., 2001). Thus far, however, philanthropy
has been studied in single-country settings (Adams

and Hardwick, 1998; Brammer and Millington,
2004; Navarro, 1988) or in geographically localized
communities (Galaskiewicz, 1997; Galaskiewicz and
Burt, 1991). As yet no known research has examined
potential differences in global patterns of corporate
donations to a speciﬁc social cause such as an indi-
vidual natural disaster, nor have conceptual studies
explored how different regions may have different
institutional or geographic factors that may inﬂuence
patterns of corporate giving.

Some parts of the world are more disaster prone
than others due to, e.g., proximity to fault lines or
being located in areas where climatic ﬂuctuations are
expected to be the most severe. To some extent,
therefore, there is a natural ‘geography’ of disasters.
But is there a geography of corporate philanthropic
response? We draw on sociological institutionalism
to hypothesize a geography of CPDR in three ways:
overall regional effects based on differences in the
practice of philanthropy across geographic regions; a
‘home region effect’ by which ﬁrms are more likely
to give in response to disasters close to home; and
ﬁnally a ‘local presence effect’ by which ﬁrms are
more likely to give to disasters that occur in distant
locations if the ﬁrm’s own business activities ﬁgure
prominently in that location.

To this end we explore not only the likelihood of
giving versus not giving, but also variations
in
donation amounts in response to three recent cata-
strophic events: the 2004 South Asian Tsunami, the
2005 Gulf Coast disaster caused by Hurricane Kat-
rina, and the 2005 earthquake that struck South Asia,
principally the Indian-Pakistani border region of
Kashmir. The article is organized as follows: the ﬁrst
section reviews the extant research on corporate
philanthropy and CSR and develops hypotheses for
possible geographic sources of variation in corporate
philanthropic disaster response. The next section
outlines the methodology used in this study, fol-
lowed by the results and a discussion of ﬁndings.
Finally, we conclude with implications for theory
and practice.

Literature review and hypothesis
development

In the early morning of 26 December, 2004 an
earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale

struck the Indian Ocean near Banda Aceh in
Sumatra. The earthquake (and its aftershocks) trig-
gered powerful tsunamis, some 10 m high, which
wreaked havoc throughout the region. Horrifying
images – many taken by tourists and locals –
graphically demonstrated to the world that this was
indeed a disaster of epic proportions. With at least
226,000 dead or missing and 1.7 million displaced,
the scale of the disaster was unprecedented in recent
history (CNN.com, July 6 2005). On August 29,
2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast and be-
came one of the costliest and most deadly hurricanes
to hit the United States. When weakened infra-
structure caused the levees
surrounding New
Orleans to break, most of the city was ﬂooded and
many people were trapped in their homes, despite an
earlier mandatory evacuation order by the New
Orleans mayor. A year after the disaster, the death
toll was estimated at 1836 plus another 700 still
missing (Hunter, 2006) with total damage estimated
at US$81.2 billion (US Department of Commerce,
2006). On October 8, 2005, a major earthquake (7.6
on the Richter scale) hit Kashmir during Ramadan
affecting both Pakistani and India controlled regions.
The Pakistani government reported over 70,000
deaths while Indian ofﬁcials conﬁrmed an additional
1400 fatalities. The earthquake left over 3 million
people homeless, most of whom were living in re-
mote mountainous regions and facing the onset of
winter.

(Emanuel, 2005; Trenberth, 2005; Webster et al.,

costs of such events have been rising steadily since
the 1960s. A report by reinsurer Munich Re (2005)
revealed that natural disasters worldwide during the
1990s caused damage totaling over US$700 billion
(based on 91 ‘events’) relative to US$228 billion
over the 1980s (based on 63 ‘events’). Thus the
ﬁnancial and social burden of disaster relief efforts
seems likely to grow in the future. Relief efforts are

of relief efforts, the channeling of in-kind donations
and the management of complex logistic operations
(Fritz Institute, 2005; Muller et al., 2006).

We approach CPDR as corporate philanthropy
in the broadest
sense, comprising a charitable
transfer of corporate resources to recipients (Fry
et al., 1982) that can include non-ﬁnancial dona-
tions such as employee volunteer work (Burke et
al., 1986) as well as matching employee- or cus-
tomer donations. In order to frame our exploration
of patterns of CPDR in terms of existing literature,
we begin by reviewing existing comparative
research on philanthropy and CSR more generally.
In keeping with much of this comparative work, we
adopt a regional-level perspective in our hypothesis
development.

Sources of global variation in CSR and corporate
philanthropy

Corporate philanthropy has been studied extensively
(Brammer
and Millington, 2004; Galaskiewicz,
1997; Saiia et al., 2003; Seifert et al., 2004) but
rarely at the international or regional level. The vast
majority of studies are limited to a single country
context. While Simon (1995) argues that globaliza-
tion is driving convergence in corporate philan-
thropy, there are some indications of the opposite.
Pasquero (1991) argues that US companies represent
the ‘mature model’ of corporate philanthropy, and
contribute higher values of donations (about 1% of
taxable income)
in
France, Germany, and the UK, but to date there is
no quantitative assessment of this argument. Quali-
tative research suggests that Asian ﬁrms tend to
lag behind their Anglo or European counterparts,
although Shen (2004) notes that large Japanese and
Korean companies appear to be catching up with
European ﬁrms in their sponsorship of non-proﬁt
causes and events.

than European companies

Furthermore, a study by Galaskiewicz and Burt
(1991) demonstrates that structural similarities across
companies will
induce isomorphic pressures with
respect to philanthropic behavior. This suggests that
structural factors embodied in ‘business system’ ap-
proaches to economic organization (Whitley, 1999)
will shape corporate philanthropy; that is, compa-
nies that are embedded in similar networks and

stakeholder conﬁgurations will
tend to exhibit
similarities in giving behavior, while differences will
emerge across companies embedded in different
types of networks and stakeholder conﬁgurations.
Regional
integration processes (e.g., the EU and
NAFTA) and the regional character of both ﬁrms’
markets (Rugman and Verbeke, 2004) and their
ﬁnancial structures (Rugman and Verbeke, 2005)
suggest that stakeholder pressures are increasingly
regional in nature (Gregory and Stuart, 2004; Kolk,
2005; Ruigrok and van Tulder, 1995). A growing
body of research also indicates that ﬁrms are over-
whelmingly regional in the orientation of their sales
and marketing activities (Rugman, 2000; Rugman
and Verbeke, 2004). Previous research has also
demonstrated that there are clear regional differ-
ences in managerial perceptions and behavior (e.g.,

Comparative, cross-regional

research on the
broader phenomenon of corporate social responsi-
bility (CSR) may provide additional direction.
Previous studies illustrate that ﬁrm behavior in dif-
ferent regions is related to differences in stakeholder
conﬁgurations,
interactions and priorities, culture
and managerial values (Chapple and Moon, 2005;
Logsdon et al., 2006). Waldman et al. (2006), for
instance, have shown that culture can have dis-
cernable differences in managerial perceptions and
CSR behavior. Maignan and Ralston (2002) argue
that managers from the US and UK have different
perceptions of the importance of CSR and in the
identiﬁcation of
issues. Schlegelmilch and
Robertson (1995) also demonstrate that ethical
perceptions of Western managers differ, with US
and European managers (from the UK, Germany,
and Austria) emphasizing different kinds of ethical
issues (e.g., personnel issues versus political or local
issues).

social

Research on stakeholder relations also has con-
sidered how differences in CSR are rooted in dif-
ferences in ﬁrms’ relationships with other actors. An
early study (Wokutch, 1990) suggested that Japanese
ﬁrms were already more advanced in developing
cooperative labor–management–government
rela-
tions and integrating occupational safety and health

for

concerns in their management practices than US
ﬁrms. More recent studies (e.g., Welford, 2005)
reveal that interest in CSR issues among Asian ﬁrms
has increased rapidly in recent years, although they
emphasize different issues than European or North
American ﬁrms. Asian companies,
instance,
appear less focused on internal CSR matters (e.g.,
fair wages, non-discrimination, human rights), while
North American ﬁrms have relatively less attention
for certain external issues like fair trade and labor
standards. Other research shows that Asian execu-
tives have a limited view of stakeholders as being
primarily customers and shareholders, and that they
pay less attention to more general
societal and
environmental issues than do their North American
and European peers (Lines, 2004).

regional
differences that may affect corporate giving. While
the role of tax rates on philanthropy (Galaskiewicz,
1997; Navarro, 1988) has not yet been explored in a
comparative setting, reporting on social and envi-
ronmental performance, another form of CSR, has
also been shown to demonstrate signiﬁcant regional
differences in both frequency and content (Fortanier
and Kolk, 2007; Jose and Lee, 2007; Kolk, 2005).
in part because
Reporting characteristics diverge,
accounting and tax regulations differ across
the
Triad regions
(Nobes and Parker, 2000). For
instance, European MNEs tend to highlight external
accountability by third-party veriﬁcation, while
Japanese MNEs prefer to adhere more closely to
governmental guidelines (Kolk, 2005). Also, North
America, Europe, and Asia tend to exhibit funda-
mental differences in capital market characteristics,
access to ﬁnancing and other factors (Gregory and
Stuart, 2004; Rugman and Verbeke, 2005)
that
could affect ﬁrms’ resource ‘slack’ and hence their
capacity to engage in philanthropic activities.

Finally, previous research has shown that philan-
thropy more generally (as opposed to corporate phi-
lanthropy) differs across countries and regions.
Salamon et al. (2004) show that much higher levels
of GDP (1%) are given to charity in the US than in
any other country. Similarly, CAF places Canada
third on the list of 12 countries ranked by giving as a
percentage of GDP, while France ranked last (CAF,
2006).1 Although neither of these studies isolate the
corporate component of that ﬁgure, they suggest
possible differences in North American expectations

in terms of corporate philanthropy relating to those
in European countries like France and Germany.

On the basis of this diverse body of literature that
establishes foundations for regional-level differences
in CSR and philanthropy, we hypothesize the fol-
lowing in the case of CPDR:

H1a: There are signiﬁcant differences across regions
with respect to the likelihood of ﬁrms to
engage in CPDR.

H1b: There are signiﬁcant differences across regions
with respect to the cash value of donations
made by ﬁrms as CPDR.

In addition to regional differences to CPDR in
general, we anticipate a speciﬁc home region effect
to CPDR that relates to the geographic nature of the
disaster itself. That is, when a natural disaster strikes
close to ‘home’ we anticipate this will increase both
the likelihood and amount of donations as ﬁrms
respond to media, government, and societal pres-
sures to engage, and this in turn triggers mimetic
processes in other ﬁrms. There is some preliminary
empirical support for this. For instance, in their study
of the donation behavior of Fortune Global ﬁrms in
response to the Asian Tsunami, Muller et al. (2006)
identiﬁed that ﬁrms
from Asia/Paciﬁc (although
excluding Japan) gave at relatively high levels, ceteris
paribus; however, this requires further exploration.

companies

A similar type of effect has been explored in prior
research on philanthropy that emphasizes the role of
relationships between geo-
inter-organizational
graphically proximate
and charities
(Galaskiewicz, 1997; Marquis et al., 2007; Useem,
1988). Typically this type of research aims at net-
works of actors in relatively localized communities.
Galaskiewicz (1997), for instance, investigated rela-
tionships between corporate contributions ofﬁcers
and local charities
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
metropolitan area. Marquis et al. (2007) cite exam-
ples of local philanthropy among ﬁrms in Columbus,
Ohio. The examples of philanthropy considered in
such approaches are restricted to relatively small scale
culture- and arts-based corporate charity programs
with a proportionately limited geographic scope.
Yet, in the event of larger-scale events like major
disasters that sweep across multiple towns, states, and
even countries, the ‘home town ﬂavor’ of these
approaches may be extended to larger geographic

scopes. That is, the Tsunami was a regional disaster
and thus a regional cause, which we expect to trigger
regional-level patterns of corporate response.

Moreover, in today’s world of ‘global corporate
philanthropy’ (Genest, 2005), these arguments could
be extended to the local communities in geograph-
ically more distant locations in which ﬁrms are ac-
tive. Shell, for instance, begins its press release dated
February 14, 20052 not with a reference to the
disaster in a general sense, or to the victims’ needs,
but to its ‘‘long standing links in the region’’ based
on ‘‘major established businesses and thousands of
employees.’’ Similarly, Sanoﬁ-Aventis praised its
employees in India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia,
and Thailand for their outstanding personal contri-
butions to disaster relief efforts. In sum, we expect
that companies will react more often and with more
donations when either the company’s headquarters,
or company subsidiaries and/or business relations,
are located in the disaster-stricken region. These
relationships translate into real or perceived sources
of stakeholder pressure to respond to the disaster.
Thus:

H2a: There is a home region effect in the likeli-
hood of CPDR, such that ﬁrms are more
likely to donate to disasters that occur in their
home region.

H2b: There is a home region effect in the amount
of donations, such that ﬁrms donate more
money to disasters that occur in their home
region.

H2c: There is a host region effect in the amount of
donations,
such that a ﬁrm donates more
money to disasters when its CPDR efforts are
linked to the ﬁrm’s local presence in the
disaster-stricken region.

Data and methodology

To explore these potential regional differences, we
collected data on donation amounts and donation
characteristics for companies on the 2004 Fortune
Global 500. We used the Fortune listing in accor-
dance with other studies that have focused on large,
visible ﬁrms (Muller et al., 2006; Patten, 2007). The
listing from 2004 was taken given that this list was in

effect at the time of the 2004 Tsunami and for
reasons of consistency we maintained the same
group of ﬁrms into the 2005 disasters. We selected
the Global 500 as opposed to, e.g., the US 500 in
order to better explore geographic effects across re-
gions: 204 ﬁrms in the 2004 Fortune Global 500
were based in North America, 170 based in Europe,
and 116 based in Asia (490 in total). The remaining
10 ﬁrms (from Australia, Venezuela, and Brazil)
were omitted for subsample size considerations in
order to make statistical tests possible.

The investigation centered on ﬁrm self-reporting,
drawing from information disseminated through
corporate websites, and press releases, followed by
search queries via Lexis Nexis. Corporate commu-
nications that are removed from corporate websites
after a time can often be found in press reports,
newswire items, or newspaper articles archived by
Lexis Nexis. We conducted our research in two
rounds. The ﬁrst phase, April 2005 through June
2005, focused on donation announcements follow-
ing the 2004 Tsunami, and the second phase, May
2006 through August 2006, focused on announce-
ments in response to Hurricane Katrina and the
Kashmiri Earthquake.

The analysis was conducted in two stages. In the
ﬁrst stage we used binomial
logistic regression to
model the likelihood that a given ﬁrm could be
expected to donate (Hypotheses 1a and 2a). The
binomial (maximum likelihood) logistic regression is
similar to a traditional linear regression except that it
regresses a dichotomous outcome variable (in this
case, donors versus non-donors) and is used to
generate odds ratios for the outcome variable instead
of coefﬁcients alone (Hair et al., 1998; Hosmer and
Lemeshow, 2000). The odds ratio is expressed as:

PðYÞ ¼ 1=ð1 þ e

 zÞ;

where Y is the dependent variable, equal to the
chance that a ﬁrm would donate in response to the
tsunami, and Z is a linear combination of indepen-
dent variables, or:

Z ¼ b0 þ b1X1 þ b2X2 þ  þ bnXn:

The binomial regression thus provides information
on which factors signiﬁcantly affect the likelihood of
a given ﬁrm to donate: in our case, the ﬁrm’s home
region and the disaster in question. In the second

stage we analyzed the regional component of vari-
ance in the amount given for the subset of donating
ﬁrms (Hypotheses 1b, 2b, and 2c) using a General
Linear Model (GLM).

We introduce two dependent variables into the
analysis. For Hypothesis 1a and 2a, we measure our
dependent variable ‘likelihood to donate’ as a
dichotomous (dummy) variable that takes a value of
1 if a given ﬁrm donated to a given disaster, and 0 in
cases that the ﬁrm did not. For Hypotheses 1b, 2b,
and 2c, our dependent variable is the amount do-
nated, measured in US dollars and log transformed,
as

donation values were not reported in US dollars, we
translated to dollars using exchange rates as they
stood on the date the announcement was made in
order to facilitate comparison.

reported by each company.

We test three independent variables in our models.
The ﬁrst is ‘(Home) Region,’ by which we clustered
ﬁrms in the sample according to their geographic
regions of incorporation (North America, Europe,
and Asia). The second variable is a categorical vari-
able representing the three disasters, where 1 repre-
sents the Tsunami, 2 represents Hurricane Katrina,
and 3 represents the Kashmiri earthquake. Our ﬁnal
independent variable (‘Local Presence’) captures
whether donating ﬁrms emphasized their
local
employees or business
in the disaster-
stricken area in their donation announcements, as
exempliﬁed by the Shell announcement cited above.
‘Local Presence’ is a dummy variable taking the value
of 1 if local activities, employees and/or business
relations in the disaster area are mentioned, and 0 if
they are not. Finally, we include total revenues (log
transformed) to control for size, since size has been
shown to inﬂuence philanthropic behavior (Amato
and Amato, 2007; Patten, 2007).

Results

Our results show that Fortune Global 500 ﬁrms
donated in excess of US$1.2 billion to the three
disasters collectively. The Tsunami received the
greatest overall donations at US$595 million, with
US$545 million going to Katrina and just over
US$70 million going to the Kashmiri earthquake.
Moreover, the data show that ﬁrms from around the
globe were broadly engaged in CPDR. Table I, for

aThe reference region is Asia; the reference disaster is the Kashmiri earthquake.

regression technique generates odds ratios for a given
outcome (donating versus not donating) given the
presence of certain factors. These odds ratios are
captured in the column ‘Exp(B)’, and the factors are
the variables in the left-hand column. The odds
ratios are always relative to a reference category; in
this case Asian ﬁrms and the Kashmiri earthquake.

The main effects of ‘Disasters’ show for instance
that the likelihood of donating versus not donating
for all ﬁrms was
signiﬁcantly higher (3.8 times
higher) in the case of the Tsunami than the case of
the Kashmiri earthquake. The odds ratio for Hur-
ricane Katrina is 1.4 times greater than for Kashmiri
earthquake, but

for North
American ﬁrms and European ﬁrms in the case of
the reference category (Kashmiri Earthquake) are
not signiﬁcantly different from the odds ratios for
Asian ﬁrms in that case (p = 0.203 and p = 0.565,
respectively). However, the interaction effects of
‘Disaster Region’ are signiﬁcant,
implying that
regional differences in donation likelihood depend
on the disaster in question.

The interaction effects in Table III show that the
greatest likelihood of donating was for European
ﬁrms to the Tsunami. This odds ratio was 6.8 times
higher than that for the reference category, Asian
ﬁrms donating to the Kashmiri earthquake, and also
more than twice as high as the odds ratio for North
American ﬁrms in the case of the Tsunami. Still,
North American ﬁrms were more than two times as
likely to donate to the Tsunami as Asian ﬁrms were
to donate to Kashmir, and more than four times as
likely to donate in response to Hurricane Katrina. In
contrast,
for
‘Europe Katrina’ shows that European ﬁrms were
no more or less likely to donate in response to

Logistic regression models employ a different set
of diagnostic statistics than regression models based
on continuous dependent variables. For instance, the
Hosmer & Lemeshow goodness of ﬁt statistic is non-
signiﬁcant, indicating that the model ﬁts the data
well (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). The Cox &
Snell and Nagelkerke psuedo R-squared values,
developed to approximate OLS-type R-square
functions, show that the model captures a good
proportion of the variance in the data, and the area
under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC), at
0.801, demonstrates that
the model distinguishes
well between donating versus not donating. ROC
values over 0.700 indicate good discriminatory
validity, with validity improving as the area under
the ROC curve approaches 1.000 (Hosmer and
Lemeshow, 2000).

Table IV reports the results of the General Linear
Model (GLM). The GLM model essentially reports
partial correlations (controlling for other factors in
the model), is convenient in the case of categorical
variables (‘Disaster’ and ‘Region’) and is less sensitive
to non-normality. We report main effects for both
factors, and interactions between them, as well as
main effects for ‘Local Presence’ and interaction
effects with ‘Region’, when controlling for size.

across ﬁrms from all three regions.

Discussion

Recent evidence suggests that corporate contribu-
tions to disaster relief and reconstruction are an
emerging fact of business life (Fritz Institute, 2005;
Heher, 2005). While the response to recent disasters
like the Tsunami has been described as ‘global’, it has
also been suggested that there are regional differ-
ences in CPDR (Muller et al., 2006). The objective
of this article was to contribute to the literature on
corporate philanthropy by conducting a global
comparative study of corporate responses to three
recent disasters, hypothesizing that variations
in
institutional contexts through geographic space will
lead to differences in patterns of CPDR across that
space. More than 10 years after Simon’s (1995) claim
of convergence in philanthropy due to globalization,
our investigation shows the opposite: inter-regional
differences in CPDR exist and persist. Firms from
different regions demonstrated signiﬁcant differences
in the likelihood and cash value of CPDR that lend
partial support to our hypotheses on patterns in
CPDR.

them in all cases. Speciﬁcally,

For instance, our initial hypotheses (1a and 1b)
proposed inter-regional differences in CPDR based
on extant, largely conceptual claims on comparative
philanthropy. Pasquero (1991), for instance, suggests
that US ﬁrms are more likely to give, and give more,
than European and Asian ﬁrms while Shen (2004)
shows that European ﬁrms are more likely to engage
in corporate sponsorship than Asian ﬁrms. Our re-
sults lend general support to these hypotheses, but do
the
not
binomial
that
Europeans showed the highest incidence of dona-
tions in the case of the Tsunami, but were not sig-
niﬁcantly more likely than Asian ﬁrms to donate to
either Katrina or the Kashmiri earthquake. North
American ﬁrms, in contrast, showed incidences of
donations in both the Tsunami and Katrina cases that
were higher than those of European and Asian ﬁrms,
but not in the case of the Kashmiri earthquake. This
suggests that, when considering all three disasters
together, North American ﬁrms were the most likely
to donate, followed by European ﬁrms and then
Asian ﬁrms. The estimated marginal means reported
in Figure 1 also indicate that inter-regional differ-
ences exist in the cash value of donations, but not in
every case. That is, North American and European
ﬁrms gave signiﬁcantly more than Asian ﬁrms in
response to the Tsunami; all three regions produced
signiﬁcantly different values in the case of Katrina;
and North American ﬁrms gave signiﬁcantly more
than both European and Asian ﬁrms in the case of
Kashmir.

The relatively low cash value of donations by
Asian ﬁrms could imply that Asian ﬁrms are sub-
jected to speciﬁc factors that constrain how much
they give. Given that shareholders are the most
important stakeholders to Asian executives (Lines,
2004), Asian executives may perceive agency con-
straints when considering the degree to which they
should engage in CPDR. Lines (2004) also showed
that Asian ﬁrms are less geared towards general social
and environmental issues than European and North
American ﬁrms.
In the case of environmental
reporting Kolk (2005) drew similar conclusions,
arguing that Asian ﬁrms tend to focus their envi-
ronmental reporting strategies on internal dimen-
sions of environmental accounting, while European
and US ﬁrms see their reporting as part of the
broader international debate on sustainability. If

companies perceive CPDR to be a form of social
responsibility, the leading role of North American
and, to a lesser extent, European ﬁrms in this type of
CSR is in accordance with previous research.

This partial support for Hypotheses 1a and 1b
already points in the direction of Hypotheses 2a and
2b on ‘home region effects.’ In other words, the
results for 1a and 1b show that regions matter – but
that it depends on the disaster. The home region
effect is quite apparent in the case of Katrina, with
North American ﬁrms giving signiﬁcantly more
often and at signiﬁcantly greater values than both
European and Asian ﬁrms. For Asian ﬁrms the home
region effect is less evident, although we observe that
Asian ﬁrms gave nearly as much to the Kashmiri
earthquake as they gave to Hurricane Katrina, while
North American and European ﬁrms’ donations
dropped off considerably in response to the Kashmiri
earthquake (Figure 1).

These two salient observations lend some support
to Hypotheses 2a and 2b. However, we recognize
the limitation of having no ‘European’ disaster in the
analysis, which makes it difﬁcult to draw conclusions
on a possible home region effect for European ﬁrms.
From this perspective, the extremely high propensity
of European ﬁrms to donate to the Tsunami
is
particularly striking, witnessed by the highest odds
ratio in Table III (Exp(B) = 6.48). While we did
not explore this in our hypotheses, an alternate and
intuitive institutional explanation for this result is the
relatively high number of casualties among European
nationals vacationing in the region. For instance,
over 500 Swedes died in the Tsunami, and at least 60
German deaths were noted with an additional 1000
missing and presumed dead. We may, therefore,
have found evidence of an additional form of ‘local
presence effect.’ That is, European ﬁrms may have
engaged in CPDR following the Tsunami to the
extent that they did at least in part out of a normative
obligation to help their suffering countryfolk in the
disaster-stricken region. This possibility requires
additional research.

The possibility of a local presence effect

for
vacationing nationals is reinforced by the evidence
of a local presence effect
for business activities
in the disaster-stricken region
and relationships
(Figure 2). The data clearly show that ﬁrms donated
more in instances when they referred to their local
activities and relations in their donation announce-

ment, lending solid support for Hypothesis 2c. These
results suggest that ﬁrms are sensitive to pressures
arising through their local presence in the disaster-
stricken area, implying that a ‘local’ understanding
of corporate philanthropy (Galaskiewicz, 1997;
Marquis et al., 2007) remains important even in a
setting of international giving.

Conclusion

While corporate responses to disasters may have
raised corporate philanthropy to a new level, it has
until recently remained an understudied phenome-
non. This article is the ﬁrst to explore patterns of
CPDR by investigating corporate responses
to
three recent disasters – the South Asian Tsunami
(2004), Hurricane Katrina (2005), and the Kashmiri
earthquake (2005). We consider the role of global
variations in institutional contexts as sources of dif-
ferences in patterns, frequency, and elements of that
response. This study reveals evidence of ‘regionali-
zation’ in corporate philanthropic disaster response,
meaning that organizational behavior in response to
major disasters appears to vary systematically across
regions. An additional contribution of this study is
the ﬁnding of a ‘home region effect’ and a ‘local
presence effect’ in corporate philanthropic disaster
response, by which ﬁrms pay more attention to
disasters that are closer to home, or in locations
where they have a local presence, possibly out of a
sense of responsibility or a greater degree of tangi-
bility. The results also add nuance to the concept of
‘global corporate citizenship’ (Post, 2000). Future
research may wish to explore the contours of
‘regional corporate citizenship’ in more depth and to
further examine the interplay between geography
and institutions that may drive CPDR and other
corporate citizenship behaviors.

The results described in this study have implications
for research and practice alike. First, our research adds
a new dimension to the body of comparative research
that explicitly adopts a regional-level perspective. Our
study suggests that CPDR is the outcome of a mix of
general regional differences in the institutional con-
text as well as institutional forces that vary according to
the geographic relationship between the disaster and
the ﬁrm or its foreign subsidiaries. Katz et al. (2001)

observe that inquiry into the social behavior of ﬁrms
tends to overemphasize ﬁrms’ domestic environments
as opposed to international environments and inter-
national issues, leading to ‘islands’ of understanding
that cannot be easily related to one another. For
researchers interested in CSR in general and the
drivers of social behaviors of ﬁrms, our results suggest
that regional patterns in CPDR are similar to regional
patterns identiﬁed in CSR and philanthropy, yet have
additional home- or local-presence effects related to
the geographic proximity of a disaster to a ﬁrm’s
interests. Results of this study emphasize the need for
additional comparative international research in cor-
porate philanthropy, in particular because our study
does not isolate the speciﬁc institutional forces that
drive global variation in CPDR.

Our results also have implications for practice.
Most importantly, evidence of regional-level patterns
of behavior suggests that the international networks
that are currently underway to address disaster re-
sponse (and the role of companies in it) may be well
served by the pursuit of regional-level initiatives.
Industry or multilateral groups like World Economic
Forum’s (WEF) disaster relief network or the Euro-
pean Foundation Centre (EFC), may usefully build
upon our ﬁndings and tailor their approach to ﬁt the
regional focus of ﬁrms. Our ﬁndings suggest that there
are regional differences in what ﬁrms seem to pay
attention to and in how they respond. Therefore,
these organizations should look at having regional
subfoci and how to build the regional capacity of ﬁrms
as a collective. One example of this is the US Business
Roundtable’s Partnership for Disaster Relief: ‘‘Our
new Partnership for Disaster Relief will
lay the
groundwork to advance the private sector’s role in
disaster preparedness and will reap immeasurable
beneﬁts when a natural disaster occurs,’’ said Hank
McKinnell, Chairman of the [US] Business Round-
table and Chairman and CEO of Pﬁzer Inc. ‘‘Through
this unique collaboration – across sectors, industries,
and borders – US companies will play a coordinated
and pivotal role in supporting humanitarian agencies’
outstanding relief work on the ground and national
governments’ ongoing recovery efforts.’’3 We
encourage the US Business Roundtable to include
other North American ﬁrms and for European
and Asian regions
to establish similar collective
initiatives.
