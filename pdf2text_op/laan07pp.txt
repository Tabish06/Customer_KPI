Abstract
Two studies were conducted to analyze how hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy in-
dividually and as a composite higher-order factor predicted work performance and sat-
isfaction. Results from Study 1 provided psychometric support for a new survey measure 
designed to assess each of these 4 facets, as well as a composite factor. Study 2 results in-
dicated a significant positive relationship regarding the composite of these 4 facets with 
performance and satisfaction. Results from Study 2 also indicated that the composite fac-
tor may be a better predictor of performance and satisfaction than the 4 individual facets. 
Limitations and practical implications conclude the article.

In a special issue of the American Psychologist, Sheldon and King (2001, p. 
216) point out that “Positive psychology revisits the ‘average person’ with an 
interest  in  finding  out  what  works,  what  is  right,  and  what  is  improving.” 
Like positive psychology, which does not claim to have discovered the im-
portance of positivity (e.g., see Peterson, 2006), the recently emerging posi-
tive organizational behavior field recognizes that much of the early history 
(e.g., Herzberg, 1966; Maslow, 1954; McGregor, 1960) and contemporary the-
ories and research (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, positive 
affectivity,  core  self-evaluations,  organizational  citizenship,  intrinsic  moti-
vation, humor, self-determination, organizational justice, among others) are

positively oriented. Nevertheless, analogous to, and drawing from, the posi-
tive psychology literature, the term positive organizational behavior is intended 
to identify a newly emerging focus on a positive approach to developing and 
managing human resources in today’s workplace (for recent reviews of this 
emerging literature, see Luthans & Youssef, 2007; Luthans, Youssef, & Avo-
lio, 2007). 

Positive organizational behavior has been defined as “the study and ap-
plication  of  positively  oriented  human  resource  strengths  and  psycholog-
ical  capacities  that  can  be  measured,  developed,  and  effectively  managed 
for  performance  improvement”  (Luthans,  2002b,  p.  59;  also  see  Nelson  & 
Cooper,  2007;  Turner,  Barling,  &  Zaharatos,  2002;  Wright,  2003).  In  addi-
tion, to differentiate from other positive approaches reported in both the ac-
ademic  and  practitioner  literatures,  the  following  criteria  were  set  for  in-
cluding  constructs  in  this  definition  of  positive  organizational  behavior: 
(a) grounded in theory and research; (b) valid measurement; (c) relatively 
unique to the field of organizational behavior; (d) state-like and hence open 
to development and change as opposed to a fixed trait; and (e) have a pos-
itive impact on work-related individual-level performance and satisfaction 
(Luthans, 2002a, 2002b; Luthans et al., 2007). 

Using these criteria, the positive psychological constructs that have been 
determined to meet the inclusion criteria so far include hope, resilience, opti-
mism, and self-efficacy, and when combined, represent what has been termed 
psychological capital or PsyCap (Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans et al. 2007). 
This composite construct has been defined as “an individual’s positive psy-
chological state of development and is characterized by: (1) having confidence 
(self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challeng-
ing tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now 
and in the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary, redirect-
ing paths to goals (hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems 
and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resilience) to 
attain success” (Luthans et al., 2007, p. 3). 

Besides the traditional use in economics and finance, the term capital has 
also been used to represent the value of human resources (human capital) as 
well  as  with  other  concepts  (e.g.,  intellectual  capital,  social  capital,  cultural 
capital).We simply use the term psychological capital here to represent individ-
ual motivational propensities that accrue through positive psychological con-
structs such as efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience. Positive psychologist 
Csikszentmihalyi (as quoted in Kersting, 2003, p. 26) noted that such psycho-
logical capital “is developed through a pattern of investment of psychic re-
sources that results in obtaining experiential rewards from the present mo-
ment while also increasing the likelihood of future benefit. . . It’s about the

state of the components of your inner life. When you add up the components, 
experiences  and  capital,  it  makes  up  the  value.”  The  “components”  in  our 
case are efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience. 

The purpose of the present studies is to examine the measurement proper-
ties of a survey instrument used to assess such identified psychological capital 
and to determine its relationship with job satisfaction and performance out-
comes. After first providing theoretical support for developing and testing a 
higher-order factor, we present preliminary results on the psychometric prop-
erties of the designed measure and empirical tests of the study hypotheses. 

Psychological Capital as a Distinctive Construct

The beginning point in our research is to clearly define the unit of analysis 
(Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994). As presented here, the study of this higher-
order construct is focused on the individual as the level of analysis. Specifi-
cally, this individual level is not intended to rule out the potential for dyadic, 
group, or organizational levels of analysis for a type of team or “collective” 
PsyCap in the future but is simply intended to clarify the scope of the pres-
ent study. 

Because PsyCap is being proposed as a higher-order construct, it first must 
meet the conceptual and empirical criteria of being distinctive (Judge, Van Vi-
anen, & DePater, 2004; Schwab, 1980). Conceptually, one way that this higher-
order  construct  can  be  differentiated  from  other  constructs  in  positive  psy-
chology (Peterson, 2006; Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Snyder & Lopez, 2002) 
involves  focusing  on  the  state-like  versus  trait-like  distinction  made  in  this 
literature. Specifically, whereas PsyCap uses the inclusion criterion of being 
“state-like,” the Peterson and Seligman (2004) signature character strengths 
and virtues (CSVs) must meet the criterion of being “trait-like—an individual 
difference with demonstrable generality and stability” (Seligman, Steen, Park, 
& Peterson, 2005, p. 411). In addition to CSVs, the state-like nature of PsyCap 
also  differentiates  it  from  positively  oriented  organizational  behavior  trait-
like constructs such as “Big Five” personality dimensions (Barrick & Mount, 
1991) or core self-evaluations (Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge, Van Vianen, & De-
Pater, 2004). 

Although trait theories have a long history in psychology and are expe-
riencing  a  resurgence  of  interest  in  organizational  behavior  and  human  re-
source management literatures, the notion of states has been mainly restricted 
to discussions of moods and emotions. States and traits are often considered 
as independent, dichotomous categories of constructs. Nevertheless, in defin-
ing what constitutes PsyCap we portray states and traits along a continuum 


544   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

largely determined by the relative degrees of stability in measurement and 
openness  to  change  and  development  (Avolio  &  Luthans,  2006;  Luthans  & 
Avolio,  2003;  Luthans  et  al.,  2007).  Recognizing  that  different  theorists  will 
take different positions on the placement of a given construct along a state–
trait continuum (e.g., emotions or positive affectivity have been placed at both 
extremes in the literature), the following continuum is proposed as a heuristic 
to clarify what is meant by “state-like”: 
(1) Positive States—momentary and very changeable; represents our feelings. 

Examples could include pleasure, positive moods, and happiness. 

(2)  “State-Like”—relatively  malleable  and  open  to  development;  the  con-
structs could include not only efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism, 
but also a case has been made for positive constructs such as wisdom, 
well-being,  gratitude,  forgiveness,  and  courage  as  having  “state-like” 
properties as well (Luthans et al., 2007). 

(3) “Trait-Like”—relatively stable and difficult to change; represents person-
ality factors and strengths. Examples could include the Big Five person-
ality dimensions, core self-evaluations, and character strengths and vir-
tues (CSVs). 

(4) Positive Traits—very stable, fixed, and very difficult to change. Examples 
could include intelligence, talents, and positive heritable characteristics. 
Notice that the PsyCap constructs fit in the continuum as being “state-like,” 
that is, they are not as stable and are more open to change and development 
compared  with  “trait-like”  constructs  such  as  Big  Five  personality  dimen-
sions or core self-evaluations, but importantly that they also are not momen-
tary states. 

This state versus trait debate has long been discussed in the psychology 
literature (e.g., see Allen & Potkay, 1981; Zuckerman, 1983), and relevant pre-
vious research can be found in the work of Conley (1984). In an analysis of 
longitudinal  research  studies,  Conley  compared  the  test–  retest  reliabilities 
between intelligence, personality, and what he describes as self-opinion con-
structs (e.g., life satisfaction and self-esteem). Results support that such psy-
chological constructs are best understood as being more or less stable. Specifi-
cally, Conley (1984, p. 11) found a “hierarchy of consistency” with intelligence 
and personality being more stable over time than self-opinion. 

Besides this classic work on the stability of individual differences, Wright 
(2007) has recently called for distinguishing the relative temporal difference 
between states and traits in research focusing on positive organizational be-
havior (also see Chamberlain & Zita, 1992; Cropanzano & Wright, 1999). Such 
research and analysis provide support for the notion of a continuum of stabil-
ity of positive constructs. In particular, this is supportive of our proposal that 


Positive PsychoLogicaL caPitaL  

  545

although each component of PsyCap may have some stability over time, com-
pared with personality traits or core self-evaluations, they are expected to not 
be as stable and therefore are state-like and open to change and development. 
Both  theory-building  and  prior  research  on  hope,  resilience,  optimism, 
and efficacy supports that they are developable. As examples, Bandura (1997) 
has demonstrated strategies to increase self-efficacy (also see Bandura, 2000). 
Snyder (2000) provides evidence that hope is developable and published the 
state–hope scale (Snyder et al., 1996). Although known for their earlier work 
on dispositional optimism, Carver and Scheier (2005) more recently discuss 
strategies to develop optimism, and Shifren and Hooker (1995) have demon-
strated its situational measurement. Seligman (1998) features “learned opti-
mism” in his widely recognized book by this title and offers evidence to sup-
port  its  development.  Masten  and  Reed  (2002)  likewise  discuss  successful 
strategies for resilience-based developmental interventions, and Wagnild and 
Young (1993) have developed a state-like measure of it. Each of these contri-
butions in the positive psychology literature have supported that these four 
constructs  can  be  developed.  There  is  also  some  preliminary  evidence  that 
when these four constructs are combined into a higher-order construct it can 
be considered state-like and hence may be developable (Luthans, Avey, & Pa-
tera, in press; Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Norman, & Combs, 2006). 

Because PsyCap is just emerging, there have not yet been published stud-
ies to empirically demonstrate its discriminant validity in relation to other es-
tablished constructs. Therefore, in the first study described below we will use 
one of our samples to assess the discriminant validity of PsyCap in relation 
to more trait-like constructs such as Big Five personality dimensions and core 
self-evaluations  (Judge  &  Bono,  2001;  Judge,  Erez,  Bono,  &  Thoresen,  2003; 
Judge  et  al.,  2004).  Nevertheless,  in  addition  to  empirically  differentiating 
PsyCap from other established positive constructs, there is also a need to es-
tablish its own theoretical foundation. 

Theoretical Background

Each of the four components has considerable theory and research that can 
contribute to developing an integrative theoretical foundation for PsyCap. For 
example, Snyder and colleagues (1991, p. 287) define hope as a “positive mo-
tivational state [italics added] that is based on an interactively derived sense 
of successful (a) agency (goal directed energy) and (b) pathways (planning to 
meet goals).” In this way, as a psychological construct, hope consists of three 
major conceptual foundations: agency, pathways, and goals. The agency com-
ponent  of  hope  can  be  thought  of  as  having  the  will  to  accomplish  the  in-


546   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

tended or desired effect (Snyder, 2000, 2002; Snyder et al., 1996). Therefore, 
hope involves the agency or motivational energy to pursue a goal, which, like 
efficacy, is a state. In addition, hope also involves the pathways that include 
not  only  identifying  goals  and  subgoals,  but  also  alternative  ways  to  reach 
those  goals.  Those  high  in  hope  utilize  contingency  planning  as  they  fore-
cast obstacles to achieving goals or subgoals and proactively identify multi-
ple pathways to attain the targeted goal (Snyder, 2000). In other words, hope 
constitutes the will to succeed and the ability to identify, clarify, and pursue 
the way to success (Snyder, 2000). 

Determining the construct validity of hope is critical to applying it in com-
bination  with  other  dimensions  of  PsyCap.  Theory  building  and  research 
have demonstrated hope to be conceptually convergent but also distinct from 
other positive constructs (Snyder, 2002 for a detailed analysis) and has been 
empirically demonstrated to have discriminant validity in relation to similar 
positive constructs (Bryant & Cvengros, 2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Mag-
aletta & Oliver, 1999; Youssef & Luthans, in press). 

Although hope has considerable face validity and intuitive appeal, along 
with research support for the relationship between hope and academic, ath-
letic, and health outcomes (Snyder, 2000, 2002), to date very few studies have 
explored its impact in the workplace. For example, Adams et al. (2002) in an 
ongoing survey found that organizations with respondents reporting higher 
levels of hope tended to be more successful than those with lower levels of 
hope. Peterson and Luthans (2003) found fast-food store managers’ level of 
hope correlated with financial performance of their unit and employee reten-
tion and job satisfaction. In a recent study, the hope level of Chinese factory 
workers was also found to be related to their supervisory-rated performance 
and merit salary increases (Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005). 

Besides these initial findings on relationships with performance, there is 
also some evidence that hope may be related to desirable work attitudes. For 
example, recent studies have found that the hope levels of production work-
ers in a small midwestern factory were related to their job satisfaction and or-
ganizational commitment (Larson & Luthans, 2006). In a large cross-sectional 
sample  of  employees,  hope  was  related  to  their  satisfaction,  organizational 
commitment, and work happiness (Youssef & Luthans, in press). 

In positive psychology, resilience is characterized by positive coping and 
adaptation in the face of significant risk or adversity (Masten, 2001; Masten 
& Reed, 2002). Applied to the workplace, resilience is defined as the “posi-
tive psychological capacity to rebound, to ‘bounce back’ from adversity, un-
certainty,  conflict,  failure,  or  even  positive  change,  progress  and  increased 
responsibility”  (Luthans,  2002a,  p.  702).  Empirical  studies  have  shown  that 
positive emotions enhance resilience in the face of negative events, which re-


Positive PsychoLogicaL caPitaL

flect its state-like quality (Tugade, Fredrickson, & Barrett, 2004). Clinical psy-
chologists  also  note  that  resilience  can  increase  and  even  grow  when  the 
individual returns to levels above homeostasis after an adverse event (Rich-
ardson,  2002).  In  short,  individuals  may  actually  become  more  resilient  to 
an adverse situation each time they effectively bounce back from a previous 
setback.  Such  positive  reactions  have  been  found  in  studies  of  emotions  to 
have upward spiraling effects (Fredrickson & Joiner, 2002). We propose that 
this is where the interaction and synergies with hope, optimism, and self-ef-
ficacy may take the level of resilience beyond that of homeostasis (Richard-
son, 2002). For example, in discussing the positive impact of efficacy, Bandura 
(1998, p. 62) notes, “Success usually comes through renewed effort after failed 
attempts. It is resiliency of personal efficacy that counts.” 

Although to date there has been little research evidence on such resilience 
in the workplace, Luthans et al. (2005) did find a significant relationship be-
tween the resilience of the Chinese workers who were undergoing significant 
change and transformation and their rated performance; Maddi (1987) found 
that hardy, resilient employees in a firm undergoing a massive downsizing 
maintained  their  health,  happiness,  and  performance;  Larson  and  Luthans 
(2006) found the factory workers’ resiliency related to their job satisfaction; 
and Youssef and Luthans (in press) found that employees’ level of resilience 
related to their satisfaction, commitment, and happiness. 

Like  hope,  optimism  is  commonly  used  in  everyday  language,  but  also 
like hope, in positive psychology it has a very specific meaning with theory 
and  research  addressing  this  positive  construct.  Drawing  from  attribution 
theory, Seligman (1998) defines optimists as those who make internal, stable, 
and global attributions regarding positive events (e.g., task accomplishment) 
and those who attribute external, unstable, and specific reasons for negative 
events (e.g., a missed deadline). Therefore, optimism as a facet of PsyCap is 
associated with a positive outcome outlook or attribution of events, which in-
cludes positive emotions and motivation and has the caveat of being realis-
tic (Luthans, 2002a). As used here, optimism is not just an unchecked process 
without realistic evaluation (Schneider, 2001). Realistic optimism includes an 
evaluation of what one can and cannot accomplish in a particular situation 
and hence adds to one’s efficacy and hope. As Peterson (2000) notes, realistic 
optimism is very dynamic and changeable and is considered state-like. 

In  relation  to  self-efficacy,  Bandura  (1998,  p.  56)  notes  that  “evidence 
shows that human accomplishments and positive well-being require an op-
timistic sense of personal efficacy to override the numerous impediments to 
success.” In assessing the similarities and differences between hope and opti-
mism, Snyder (2002, p. 257) notes that, similar to hope, “optimism is a goal-
based cognitive process that operates whenever an outcome is perceived as 


548   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

having  substantial  value.”  Seligman  (1998)  has  found  that  optimism,  when 
directly applied to the workplace, had a significant and positive relationship 
with performance of insurance sales agents, and in the study of the Chinese 
factory workers, their optimism was found to have a significant relationship 
with their rated performance (Luthans et al., 2005). Youssef and Luthans (in 
press) reported that employees’ optimism related to their performance evalu-
ations and their job satisfaction and work happiness. 

Self-efficacy has been argued to best meet the inclusion criteria for PsyCap 
(Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007). Self-efficacy represents a positive belief 
(not ability per se nor outcome expectancy) and was defined for the work-
place by Stajkovic and Luthans (1998b, p. 66) as “the employee’s conviction 
or confidence about his or her abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive 
resources or courses of action needed to successfully execute a specific task 
within a given context.” In results from a comprehensive meta-analysis, self-
efficacy was found to have a strong positive relationship with work-related 
performance (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998a; also see Bandura, 2000; Bandura & 
Locke, 2003). 

In terms of this study, we broaden the use of self-efficacy beyond a single 
task to the work domain. Employees may be more or less efficacious in the 
work domain such as a group of more specific tasks. As Bandura (1998, p. 53) 
has concluded, “Comparative studies show that domain linked measures of 
perceived efficacy are good predictors of motivation and action.” Although 
this broadens the conceptualization of very specific task efficacy, it does not 
extend across domains or to all of life such as is portrayed by generalized self-
efficacy (e.g., see Sherer et al., 1982). As applied to the higher-order construct 
of PsyCap, we draw from Bandura’s (1998, p. 53) position that, “The efficacy 
belief system is not an omnibus trait.” 

Theoretical Commonalities

It is important that each of the four positive constructs reviewed above has 
been shown to have conceptual independence (Bandura, 1997; Luthans & Jen-
sen, 2002; Luthans et al., 2007; Snyder, 2000, 2002) and empirically based dis-
criminant validity (Bryant & Cvengros, 2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Mag-
aletta & Oliver, 1999; Youssef & Luthans, in press). By the same token, we 
propose that there also may be a common, underlying link that runs between 
them and ties them together, that is, a higher-order core factor. As indicated 
in the definition of PsyCap, this commonality or underlying link is a mech-
anism shared across each of the facets that contribute to a motivational pro-
pensity  to  accomplish  tasks  and  goals.  A  relevant  discussion  of  conceptual 
frameworks provided by Law and colleagues (1998) describes the nature and 


Positive PsychoLogicaL caPitaL  

  549

epistemology  of  multidimensional  constructs  such  as  the  proposed  higher-
order factor PsyCap. Specifically, they describe how multidimensional con-
structs may have components relating to a core underlying factor whereby 
the shared variance or commonality between each facet comprises the higher-
order factor. This concept is not new in the consideration of individual differ-
ences. For example, a number of years ago Watson and Clark (1984, p. 465) ar-
gued, “Distinct and segregated literatures have developed around a number 
of personality traits that, despite different names, nevertheless inter-correlate 
so highly that they must be considered measures of the same construct.” In 
other words, distinct psychological constructs may have, at their core, com-
mon processes driving motivation and behavior. Using such arguments, we 
propose the higher-order factor of PsyCap may represent the common source 
of  variance  (i.e.,  common  mechanistic  processes)  connecting  the  four  con-
structs of hope, optimism, resilience, and self-efficacy. 

The nature of a higher-order factor being made up of distinct components 
as proposed here is common in organizational behavior research. As exam-
ples, constructs such as transformational leadership were composed of cha-
risma,  individual  consideration,  intellectual  stimulation,  and  inspirational 
motivation (Avolio, Bass, & Jung, 1999); empowerment composed of mean-
ing,  competence,  self-determination  and  impact  (Spreitzer,  1995);  and  core 
self-evaluations consisting of self-esteem, generalized efficacy, locus of con-
trol,  and  emotional  stability  (Judge  &  Bono,  2001)  can  each  be  considered 
higher-order factors. They have distinct dimensions, which are indicators of a 
“higher-order” construct or an overall core factor. 

In the case of PsyCap, there is both conceptual and preliminary research 
support for the proposed higher-order factor. As indicated in the above dis-
cussion of each of the four facets, Bandura (1997, p. 3) concludes that those 
high in self-efficacy will be more resilient to adversity, and Snyder (2000, pp. 
39–40) found that those high in hope tend to be more confident on specific 
tasks (self-efficacy) and are quickly able to bounce back (resilience) after tem-
porary hopelessness. 

Empirical  evidence  from  the  Chinese  factory  workers  study  noted  pre-
viously found that each of their levels of hope, optimism, and resilience re-
lated at about the same level to performance outcomes. Yet, the combination 
of these three facets, indicating the shared mechanisms between them, had 
a higher relationship with rated performance than any one of them individ-
ually (Luthans et al., 2005). Therefore, although each of the components has 
demonstrated discriminant validity across multiple samples when compared 
with each other (Bryant & Cvengros, 2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Magaletta 
&  Oliver,  1999;  Youssef  &  Luthans,  in  press),  there  is  also  some  beginning 
evidence to support an overall core construct (Luthans et al., 2005).We pro-
pose that even though hope, resilience, optimism, and self-efficacy may have 


550   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

conceptual  independence  and  discriminant  validity,  they  may  also  make  a 
unique theoretical and measurable contribution to a higher order core con-
struct of PsyCap, representing one’s positive appraisal of circumstances and prob-
ability for success based on motivated effort and perseverance. 

The  definition  of  PsyCap,  presented  in  the  introduction  and  described 
above as a core factor, we propose will have a greater relationship with per-
formance and job satisfaction than the four individual components that com-
prise  it.  By  considering  self-efficacy,  hope,  optimism,  and  resilience  as  im-
portant facets of PsyCap rather than focusing on any one individual facet in 
particular, we expect their combined motivational effects will be broader and 
more impactful than any one of the constructs individually. For example, op-
timistic self-efficacy is broader and more impactful than just optimism or self-
efficacy. Each facet includes both unique and common cognitive and motiva-
tional processes that enable performance. Nevertheless, when combined with 
each other, the cognitive and motivational processes are expected to be en-
hanced.  Therefore,  theoretically  considering  and  operationalizing  each  con-
struct as facets of overall PsyCap (i.e., a latent factor with four facets as in-
dicators)  allows  for  broader  and  potentially  more  impactful  cognitive  and 
motivational processes to be engaged in work performance. 

As an example of the above, if an efficacious employee is a good performer 
because of accepting significant challenges and expending the necessary effort 
to achieve goals (Bandura, 1997), then an efficacious and hopeful employee 
(who not only accepts challenges and puts out effort to achieve goals, but also 
identifies subgoals and pathways to achieve those goals, forecasts obstacles, 
and has contingency plans to overcome such obstacles by pursuing multiple 
pathways) should perform even better and have higher satisfaction. 

The same could be said of the emergent effects of resilience and optimism 
when  in  combination  with  self-efficacy  and  hope.  For  example,  if  employ-
ees  demonstrating  resilience  with  bounce-back  capacity  are  also  efficacious 
and hopeful, they should be more confident to persist and put forth the nec-
essary  effort,  while  pursuing  alternate  pathways  to  return  to  their  original 
level. With this combination, they may come back above and beyond where 
they were before the adverse event. Also, the employee with greater capacity 
for optimism may have a positive perspective but combined with self-efficacy 
and hope will also have the confidence and persistence to pursue alternative 
pathways when necessary to actually attain optimistic goals. The more resil-
ience employees can access and use to bounce back, the more likely they can 
recover from set backs at work. Nevertheless, when combined with hope, re-
silient employees will also have determined the pathways of how to bounce 
back and beyond, while also building levels of self-efficacy by showing they 
can overcome a significant challenge, and optimism to do so in the future. In

other words, we propose that employees who embody high levels of overall 
PsyCap may be stronger performers because of the number and level of pos-
itive  psychological  constructs  manifested  through  their  cognitions,  motiva-
tion, and, ultimately, their behavior than would those who only exhibit hope, 
or resilience, or optimism, or self-efficacy in a given situation. 

Although primarily aimed at performance improvement, employees with 
higher levels of PsyCap may also be more satisfied with their job and their 
leaders. For example, the previously noted exploratory study of the produc-
tion  workers  at  the  small  factory  found  a  relationship  with  their  score  on 
PsyCap and their job satisfaction (Larson & Luthans, 2006). In general, em-
ployees  who  exhibited  higher  levels  of  hope  were  found  to  be  more  satis-
fied perhaps because through their jobs they were enabled to have both the 
motivation and a plan to make the best of their situation (e.g., see Youssef 
& Luthans, in press). Yet, we propose that even higher satisfaction may oc-
cur when such hope is accompanied by optimism and/or self-efficacy in do-
ing that job and the resilience to respond favorably to any setbacks. Because 
of the proposed higher-order nature of the four components when taken to-
gether, PsyCap should be related to employee performance and satisfaction 
above  and  beyond  each  individual  construct’s  bivariate  relationships  with 
performance and satisfaction. 

On the basis of this emerging theoretical foundation for PsyCap, we de-

rive our study hypotheses as follows: 

Hypothesis 1: Employees’ level of PsyCap will be positively related to 

their performance and job satisfaction. 

Hypothesis 2: Employees’ level of PsyCap will have a relatively stronger 
relationship to their performance and job satisfaction than each of 
the individual facets of hope, resilience, optimism, and self-efficacy. 

Methods

Two studies were conducted to analyze the measure of PsyCap and test 
the hypotheses. Study 1 utilized three samples of management students with 
an age range that can be termed emerging adults (Arnett, 2000). Study 2 used 
two separate samples of employees in both service and high-technology man-
ufacturing environments to test the hypotheses in the field. With Study 1, we 
first review the initial psychometric properties with Sample 1 examining the 
factor structure, Sample 2 examining the nomological network, and Sample 3 
examining the test–retest statistics and additional discrimination from related 
constructs.  With  Study  2,  we  test  hypotheses  with  two  independent  sam-


552   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

ples  of  manufacturing  engineers  (Sample  1)  and  insurance  service  employ-
ees (Sample 2). Each sample is generally discussed in this order below, and 
for more clarity when referring to the two samples in Study 2, we will use the 
terms “high tech manufacturing” and “services.” 

Samples for Study 1 

The first sample in Study 1 consisted of 167 management students from a 
large state university in the Midwest. These participants had an average age 
of 22.25 years (SD = 1.41) and 67% were men. The second sample of Study 
1  was  drawn  about  5  months  later  from  different  management  students  at 
the same university and from a second large university from the mideastern 
United States. These 404 participants in this second sample were similar to 
the  first  in  terms of demographics (average  age  21.10 years, SD = 2.66 and 
58% were men). Finally, to investigate the stability of the PsyCap measure, 
we administered a series of scales at three points in time over the course of 4 
weeks to 174 different management students from the same midwestern uni-
versity noted above. 

Samples for Study 2 

The  high-tech  manufacturing  sample  for  Study  2  consisted  of  engineers 
and technicians from a very large (Fortune 100, over 150,000 employees) firm. 
These 115 participants averaged 44.83 (SD = 7.31) years and 80% were men. 
The service sample for Study 2 was made up of employees in all functions 
and levels of a midsized (about 900 employees) insurance services firm (i.e., 
they service insurance policies from other firms). These 144 subjects averaged 
33.79 (SD = 10.85) years and 65% were women. 

Procedures for the Studies 

In Study 1, management students consenting to participate in an “Organi-
zational Behavior and Leadership” project were provided a Web address to 
register. They were then sent a unique password via e-mail that allowed them 
to log in and take a short questionnaire survey. Following the recommenda-
tions of Podsakoff and colleagues (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 
2003) to reduce same source/common methods bias problems from question-
naire surveys, we administered the study survey at two points in time. The 
first part of the survey containing the predictor study variables was taken in 
the first session. Then a week later, they logged back in and completed the 
survey that included performance and satisfaction study variables.

The on line method was also used in Study 2 to gather survey data on 
the predictor variables from those consenting to participate in the insur-
ance  service  firm.  All  participants  were  advised  through  informed  con-
sent  that  company  performance  evaluations  would  be  linked  with  their 
survey responses to inform organizational research. The most recent per-
formance data on participants in this sample were gathered from the hu-
man resources department a month after the survey was taken. This one 
month lag was deemed to be appropriate because of our proposed state-
like  properties  of  PsyCap.  The  basis  for  the  appropriateness  of  a  month 
can  be  found  in  our  introductory  discussion  of  the  state-like  nature  of 
PsyCap. Specifically, in contrast to unstable states such as pleasure, pos-
itive moods, and happiness, the “state-like” PsyCap is proposed to be rel-
atively more stable and we used one month as a reasonable period of time 
for conducting a preliminary examination of the performance relationship 
with PsyCap. 

For the high-tech manufacturing firm in Study 2, members of the engi-
neering group were sent an “Attendance Optional” meeting notice. During 
this meeting, the chief engineer (first level executive) announced an oppor-
tunity to be a part of an “Organizational Behavior and Leadership” project. 
Those  participating  agreed  to  the  informed  consent  and  linking  their  sur-
vey responses to the firm’s performance evaluations. Administered on site 
by the outside researcher to assure confidentiality, they completed the sur-
vey containing the predictor variables. Similar to the service firm, the most 
recent performance data for these participants in the high-tech manufactur-
ing firm were again gathered a month after the survey from the human re-
sources  department.  As  described  above,  this  one  month  was  deemed  an 
appropriate period of time given the state-like nature of PsyCap. These data 
were based on both objective and rated performance already being collected 
by the organization. 

PsyCap Measure 

The members of the research team for this study, with additional consulta-
tion and input from colleagues doing similar research, selected the scales for 
each of the four positive facets. The selection criteria were not only that the 
scale  had  to  demonstrate  reliability  and  validity  in  the  published  literature 
and have relevance to the workplace, it also had to either be developed as, or 
capable of, measuring the state-like constructs making up PsyCap. The four 
scales that were determined to best meet these criteria were (a) hope (Snyder 
et al., 1996); (b) resilience (Wagnild & Young, 1993); (c) optimism (Scheier & 
Carver, 1985); and (d) self-efficacy (Parker, 1998). 


554   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

Each of these four selected scales have considerable psychometric sup-
port  across  multiple  samples  in  prior  research  and  have  also  been  veri-
fied in workplace studies by themselves or in combination (e.g., Jensen & 
Luthans,  2006;  Larson  &  Luthans,  2006;  Luthans  et  al.,  2005;  Peterson  & 
Luthans, 2003; Youssef & Luthans, in press). As far as meeting the state-
like  selection  criterion  is  concerned,  the  selected  hope  scale  of  Snyder  et 
al. (1996) was specifically developed and supported as “State Hope.” Al-
though the Scheier and Carver (1985) scale is associated with dispositional 
optimism (or life orientation), this instrument has also been demonstrated 
to be capable of measuring state-like optimism (Shifren & Hooker, 1995). 
Resiliency and efficacy scales such as those selected are generally associ-
ated with state-like measurement, but the Parker (1998) efficacy scale de-
parts  from  the  specific  task  magnitude  and  strength  measurement  sug-
gested  by  Bandura  (1997).  Nevertheless,  as  explained  in  the  previous 
discussion  of  efficacy,  the  Parker  scale  (1998)  is  specific  to  the  work  do-
main, and its use of a Likert-type scale rather than traditional magnitude 
and strength has considerable psychometric support as a measure of effi-
cacy (Maurer & Pierce, 1998). 

The  four  selected  measures  provided  the  foundation  and  pool  of  items 
from which the research group developed the PsyCap questionnaire (PCQ) 
measure. Two major criteria were used by the group in constructing the PCQ. 
First, we proposed that each of the four constructs would have equal weight, 
so the best six items from each of the four measures would be selected. Sec-
ond, the selected items should have face and content validity with being state-
like and relevant to the workplace or adaptable to wording changes to make 
them relevant. The group reached agreement on the 24 items and put the re-
sponse choices into a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = dis-
agree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree). To 
facilitate the state-like framing, the PCQ asks the respondent to describe how 
you think about yourself right now. 

The  PCQ  in  its  entirety  can  be  found  in  Luthans,  Youssef,  and  Avolio 
(2007); here are some sample items: (a) efficacy: “I feel confident in represent-
ing my work area in meetings with management” and “I feel confident help-
ing  to  set  targets/goals  in  my  work  area”;  (b)  hope:  “Right  now  I  see  my-
self as being pretty successful at work” and “If I should find myself in a jam 
at work, I could think of many ways to get out of it”; (c) resilience: “When I 
have a setback at work, I have trouble recovering from it, moving on (R)” and 
“I usually take stressful things at work in stride”; and (d) optimism: “I always 
look on the bright side of things regarding my job” and “If something can go 
wrong for me work-wise, it will (R).”

Reliability of Measures 

The Cronbach alphas for each of the four 6-item adapted measures and the 
overall PsyCap measure for the four samples were as follows: hope (.72, .75, 
.80, .76); resilience (.71, .71, .66, .72); self-efficacy (.75, .84, .85, .75); optimism 
(.74, .69, .76, .79); and the overall PsyCap (.88, .89, .89, .89). Although the op-
timism scale in the second sample (.69) and the resilience scale in the third 
sample (.66) did not reach generally acceptable levels of internal consistency, 
the reliability of the overall PsyCap measure in all four samples was consis-
tently above conventional standards. 

Performance Measures 

Study 1 used a 4-item self-rated performance measure (e.g., How would 
you rate your performance/effectiveness as compared with your peers?). The 
scale was framed by asking participants to rate their performance in their cur-
rent job over the past week. If they were not employed then, they were asked 
to rate their academic performance over the past week. This measure demon-
strated adequate reliability (α >.70) and was only used to examine the nomo-
logical network of PsyCap and, because it was a self-measure, was not used 
to test any hypotheses. 

Study 2, on the other hand, used actual performance evaluations that were 
gathered  independent  of  the  study.  Hence,  the  performance  measures  were 
based on objective data and managerial ratings of participants obtained from 
the human resources department records of the two organizations studied. For 
the high-tech manufacturing firm, also as prescribed by its appraisal process, 
each  participant’s  performance  measure  included  a  sum  of  ratings  based  on 
quality and objective quantity of their work on electrical subsystem designs in-
cluding error and rejection rates, meeting the schedule, complexity of assign-
ment, and ability to work with peers. This measure was then cross-checked by 
all managers within a given job family to ensure consistency in performance 
ratings across work units. Although each engineer may be performing a set of 
slightly different tasks in this appraisal process, all participants had similar job 
descriptions,  performance  evaluation  criteria,  and  were  considered  peers  in 
that they had similar jobs in term of procedures and deliverables. As consistent 
with the organization’s policy, managers of job families (up to 15 managers) 
normalized the ratings to settle on a final performance rating. 

The insurance services firm provided the most recent performance rating 
for each participant 1 month after they had taken the PsyCap survey. The rat-
ings were based on the most recent month of performance (i.e., after the sur-
vey had been administered). These data consisted of input from both objec-


556   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

tive performance data (e.g., number of claims processed) and their manager’s 
overall evaluation as prescribed by the firm’s performance appraisal process 
in one total composite score. 

Job Satisfaction Measure 

In addition to performance, this study also examined the relationship of 
PsyCap with job satisfaction. As commonly used in organizational behavior 
research (e.g., Judge & Bono, 2001), all of our samples but one used a 3-item 
scale adapted from Hackman and Oldham (1980) using the same 1–6 rating 
as for the PsyCap measure. This satisfaction scale had high internal reliabil-
ity, Cronbach alphas (.89, .87, and .86), for the three samples. To meet its con-
cern with the length of the survey, the high-tech manufacturing sample used 
a one item overall job satisfaction question (“How satisfied are you with your 
job?”). 

We  also  gathered  affective  organizational  commitment  (Allen  &  Meyer, 
1996; 1990) data in Sample 1 of Study 1. The purpose of gathering these addi-
tional data was to aid in determining the discriminant validity of the PsyCap 
instrument  and  to  generate  a  better  understanding  of  the  nomological  net-
work of constructs for the proposed PsyCap measure. The affective dimen-
sion of organizational commitment has been noted for its unique contribution, 
given it captures the employee’s affective desire to remain with the organiza-
tion versus a calculative conclusion (Judge & Bono, 2000) and is often used as 
a single dimension in organizational research (e.g., Bono & Judge, 2003; Judge 
& Bono, 2000). On the basis of face and content validity, the research team se-
lected four items from Allen and Meyer’s affective commitment scale for this 
measure. An example item is “I would be quite pleased to spend the rest of 
my life working for this organization.” These items demonstrated a reliability 
coefficient of .89. 

We gathered the job satisfaction data for all samples and affective or-
ganizational commitment for Sample 1 of Study 1 one week later than the 
predictor  variables  to  minimize  potential  same-source  effects/bias.  As 
noted  by  Podsakoff  et  al.  (2003,  p.  887),  this  temporal  separation  proce-
dure “makes it impossible for the mindset of the source or rater to bias the 
observed  relationship  between  the  predictor  and  criterion  variable,  thus 
eliminating  the  effects  of  consistency  motifs,  implicit  theories,  social  de-
sirability  tendencies”  and  other  individual  attributes  that  may  influence 
or bias the responses. In addition to the temporal strategy of data collec-
tion,  to  confirm  the  accuracy  of  the  self-reported  demographic  data,  we 
randomly  cross-checked  against  actual  personnel  records  and  found  no 
inconsistencies.

Psychometric Analyses 

Using guidelines offered by Schwab (1980) and Pedhazer and Schmelkin 
(1991), we determined several requisite conditions for the PsyCap measure. 
These  parallel  the  conditions  and  guidelines  used  for  determining  the  core 
self-evaluations construct of Judge and colleagues (2003). Specifically, the fol-
lowing needed to be established: (a) content validity such that each facet is 
equally represented in the overall PsyCap instrument, which we established 
as  discussed  above  in  constructing  the  24-item  questionnaire;  (b)  sufficient 
PsyCap scale reliability; (c) PsyCap must have a unitary factor structure con-
sistent with the proposed latent construct; (d) convergent validity with other 
theoretically similar constructs; (e) discriminant validity with those constructs 
with  which  it  is  supposed  to  differ;  (f)  empirical  validity  with  appropriate 
outcome constructs such as being significantly related to performance and job 
satisfaction; and finally, (g) predicts variance in these outcomes (i.e., perfor-
mance and satisfaction) beyond other similar constructs (in this case Consci-
entiousness, Extraversion, and core self-evaluation traits). 

Results

Confirmatory Factor Analysis 

To confirm the expected higher-order factor of PsyCap, we conducted a 
confirmatory factor analysis on the data from Study 1 using commonly ac-
cepted procedures recommended by Hinken (1995). Because maximum likeli-
hood estimation was utilized for this confirmatory factor analysis, it was nec-
essary to analyze the multivariate normality present in the data collected for 
this study. Most items from the PsyCap measure had values below one, and 
all items were well below two for both skewness and kurtosis. Although no 
clear-cut  standards  are  specified,  those  below  three  are  generally  accepted 
for skewness, and items below 10 are generally accepted for kurtosis (Kline, 
2005). In addition, both Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests of data 
normality were nonsignificant for each item. Given these findings, the nor-
mality assumption was met for this sample, and therefore, no data transfor-
mations were necessary or utilized for the confirmatory factor analysis. 

We began the CFA by fitting this model with six items for each facet (i.e., 
hope, resilience, optimism, and self-efficacy) and then fit each of the four di-
mensions  to  the  higher-order  PsyCap.  Results  indicated  the  following  esti-
mates of model fit: SRMR = .051, RMSEA = .046, CFI = .934. Hu and Bentler 
(1999) suggest that cutoffs close to or below .08 for SRMR, .06 for RMSEA, 


558   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

and at or above .95 for CFI indicate adequate fit. Therefore, using the combi-
natorial rule that two of three indices should be within acceptable ranges for 
adequate  model  fit  (Hu  &  Bentler,  1999),  overall  fit  was  deemed  adequate. 
Furthermore, each of the factor loadings was significant on their respective la-
tent factor at p < .01. The confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1 supports the 
proposed higher-order factor structure for the overall PsyCap measure. These 
results provide initial psychometric support for the PsyCap measure and its 
use in testing the hypotheses in Study 2. 

To  add  further  stringency  to  our  analyses  across  heterogeneous  sam-
ples  and  as  a  result  lend  further  measurement  support  for  the  results  ob-
tained from our hypothesis testing, we also conducted CFA on both organi-
zational samples utilized in Study 2. Because the two organizational sample 
sizes were below those normally utilized for SEM techniques, we combined 
the two samples to conduct this second CFA. Similar to what was found in 
the CFA for Sample 2 of Study 1, results for this CFA were as follows: SRMR 
= .056, RMSEA = .048, CFI = .924. Using the same criteria as before, these lat-
ter results provide additional support for the higher-order factor structure for 
the overall PsyCap measure. 

In addition to the multiple CFAs, we conducted a competing models anal-
ysis  to  more  directly  examine  the  proposition  that  PsyCap  may  be  an  un-
derlying construct described as a higher-order factor. The higher-order fac-
tor model described above and competing three-factor and one-factor models 
were  subjected  to  a  significance  test  of  difference  using  chi  square.  Specifi-
cally,  we  compared  the  hypothesized  higher-order  model  with  each  of  the 
four  facets  loading  to  the  higher-order  factor  against  four  competing  mod-
els  including  multiple  three-factor  models,  which  combined  various  facets 
as well as a single-factor model in which all items were loaded to one latent 
PsyCap factor. Table 1 shows that the hypothesized higher-order factor model 
fits the data better  than the three- and one-factor competing  models across 
both samples. Results from these model comparisons supported the proposed 
higher-order positive psychological factor (PsyCap). 

PsyCap Measure Validity and Stability 

Beyond assessing the factor structure of the PsyCap scale, we also empir-
ically examined its discriminant, convergent, and criterion validity. First, we 
generated a correlation matrix of discriminators with PsyCap from the second 
sample of Study 1 (N = 404), which are reported in Table 2. PsyCap was not 
related to age, education, Agreeableness, or Openness, but had a strong posi-
tive relationship with core self-evaluations and a moderate relationship with 
Extraversion and Conscientiousness. To better explicate the unique sources of 
variance between PsyCap, core self-evaluations, and related personality traits,

we utilized a series of correlation comparisons and hierarchical regressions to 
examine how PsyCap related to performance outcomes relative to these other 
variables. 

Using data collected in Study 1, we compared the proposed PsyCap mea-
sure with three widely recognized trait-like measures: core self-evaluations 
(α  =  .81,  Judge  &  Bono,  2001;  Judge,  Erez,  Bono,  &  Thoresen,  2003;  Judge 
et  al.,  2004),  Extraversion  (α  =  .77),  and  Conscientiousness  (α  F=  .57,  Gos-
ling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003). The core self-evaluations measure consists 
of 12 items developed by Judge and colleagues (2003), with three items each 
measuring locus of control, Neuroticism, self-esteem, and generalized self-
efficacy. The Big Five measure used in this study was the short version (10 
items) developed by Gosling and colleagues (2003) to be used in conjunc-
tion with larger surveys. We chose these two measures for the analysis be-
cause each has been shown to be positively related to desirable organiza-
tional outcomes (e.g., see Judge et al., 2003; Vinchur, Schippman, Switzer, & 
Roth, 1998). In addition, Extraversion and Conscientiousness demonstrated 
the strongest relationship with PsyCap. Nevertheless, these data must be in-
terpreted with caution because longer scales were not used and because of 
the relatively low reliability reported for Conscientiousness. Nevertheless, 
by using these two personality traits we can begin to better determine the 
extent to which PsyCap predicts variance beyond personality. We used the 
criterion  variables  of  job  satisfaction  and  affective  organizational  commit-
ment for these analyses. 

First, in the Study 1 sample, Conscientiousness (r = .15, p < .01), Extraver-
sion (r = .24, p < .001), and core self-evaluation (r = .32, p < .001) were all cor-
related with job satisfaction. Nevertheless, the correlation (r = .39, p < .001) be-
tween the PsyCap measure and job satisfaction was higher than each of these 
three trait-like measures. A two-tailed Steiger’s Z-test was then used to de-
termine the significance of the differences. Results showed that PsyCap was 
slightly more strongly related to job satisfaction, yet not significantly (p < .10) 
than  core  self-evaluations,  but  PsyCap  was  significantly  stronger  (p  <  .001) 
than both Conscientiousness and Extraversion. 

To  examine  the  unique  variance  contributed  by  PsyCap  in  predicting 
job  satisfaction,  we  used  hierarchical  regression  analysis.  In  Step  1,  we  en-
tered  Conscientiousness,  Extraversion,  and  core  self-evaluation  in  a  regres-
sion model followed by the PsyCap composite in Step 2. Although the regres-
sion model without the PsyCap composite was significant (R2 = .13, p < .001), 
the change in R2 was also significant (∆R2 = .04, p < .001) demonstrating that 
PsyCap predicted unique variance in job satisfaction beyond the two person-
ality traits and core self-evaluations. In the final regression model, the stan-
dardized beta weight for PsyCap was the largest in the model. This analy-

sis provides some preliminary discriminant validity support between PsyCap 
and  other  constructs  such  as  personality  traits  (Conscientiousness  and  Ex-
traversion) and core self-evaluations, as well as criterion validity for PsyCap 
with job satisfaction. 

We followed the same procedure for affective organization commitment 
(the most relevant commitment outcome, see Allen & Meyer, 1996), in which 
we found that the correlation with the PsyCap (r =.36, p < .001) was again 
larger than the other trait-like variables of Conscientiousness (r =.11, p < .05), 
Extraversion (r =.02, p > .05) and core self-evaluations (r = .10, p > .05). Simi-
lar to the analyses with job satisfaction, we used a two-tailed Steiger’s Z-test 
to determine the significance of the difference. Results indicated the PsyCap 
was related to affective organizational commitment significantly stronger (p 
<  .001)  than  core  self-evaluations,  Conscientiousness,  and  Extraversion.  Al-
though  the  regression  model  that  included  core  self-evaluations,  Extraver-
sion, and Conscientiousness as predictors without the PsyCap was again sig-
nificant (R2 = .02, p < .05), the change in R2 was also significant (∆R2 = .13, p 
< .001). In the final regression model the beta weight for the PsyCap was the 
largest in the model, indicating that PsyCap was once again the greatest con-
tributor to predicting, in this case, affective organizational commitment. 

Overall,  these  findings  provide  preliminary  evidence  that  PsyCap  ac-
counts for unique variance beyond recognized trait-like personality and core 
self-evaluations when predicting job satisfaction and affective organizational 
commitment. Nevertheless, given that the large correlation between core self-
evaluation and PsyCap could be heavily influenced by common method vari-
ance (Podsakoff et al., 2003), we conducted some further analyses. 

To  understand  better  the  relationship  between  core  self-evaluations  and 
PsyCap as well as the stability of the PsyCap measure over time, we utilized a 
third sample of management students (N = 174). To accumulate longitudinal 
data, at three points in time separated by 7–10 days each these participants 
completed at each point the 24-item PsyCap questionnaire, the core self-eval-
uations scale (Judge et al., 2003), the 10-item Conscientiousness scale (Gold-
berg et al., 2006), and a 10-item positive emotions scale (Fredrickson, Tugade, 
Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). The total time period of data collection was 4 weeks. 
Each  instrument  demonstrated  adequate  reliabilities  (α  ≥  .70)  at  each  data 
collection. 

As indicated in our introductory comments, core self-evaluations (Judge et 
al., 2003) are considered to be a relatively stable, trait-like higher-order con-
struct. Given the self-focused and higher-order nature of both core self-eval-
uations and the proposed PsyCap, we expected them to be somewhat related 
(convergence),  but  still  distinct  (discriminant).  Results  indicated  a  range  of 
correlations between all time points between PsyCap and CSE from r = .10

(p > .05) to r = .32 (p < .001). After correcting for unreliability, this range in-
creased to r = .12 (p > .05) to r = .46 (p < .001). Overall, we examined nine bi-
variate relationships (PsyCap at Time 1 with CSE at Time 1, 2, and 3 and the 
same for PsyCap at Time 2 and Time 3). Six of the nine bivariate relationships 
demonstrated significant relationships. Hence, there is evidence for conver-
gence in that PsyCap was related to core self-evaluations. Nevertheless, there 
is  also  evidence  that  PsyCap  and  core  self-evaluations  are  empirically  dis-
tinct as shown by the relatively low correlations and regression analyses (see 
above) offering support for discriminant validity (Kline, 2005). 

Finally, to determine the degree of stability of the PsyCap measure over 
time,  we  calculated  test–retest  reliabilities  on  the  PsyCap  instrument  com-
pared with core self-evaluations, Conscientiousness, and positive emotions. 
Test–retest statistics were calculated across each point in time and averaged. 
After disattentuating for internal reliability, the corrected test-retest statistics 
for Conscientiousness (.76) and core self-evaluations (.87) both showed rela-
tively higher stability than the PsyCap measure (.52) and the positive emo-
tions measure (.46). In sum, these results support not only that PsyCap and 
core  self-evaluations  are  related  yet  distinct  constructs,  but  also  there  is  at 
least preliminary empirical evidence that PsyCap may be “state-like” and in 
this  way  distinct  from  the  “trait-like”  core  self-evaluations  and  personality 
traits, as well as the positive emotional states. 

Hypotheses Testing Results 

To test our Study 2 hypotheses, we utilized the PsyCap measure and orga-
nizationally determined performance measures of employees from the high-
tech manufacturing firm (Sample 1) and insurance service firm (Sample 2). As 
shown in Table 3, in which we provide all of the relationships for the individ-
ual and overall PsyCap scales, although there were mixed results for the four 
individual components, full support was found for Hypothesis 1 regarding 
the overall PsyCap having a significant positive relationship with both per-
formance (r = .33, p < .01 in the manufacturing firm and r = .22, p < .01 in the 
service firm) and satisfaction (r = .32, p < .01 in the manufacturing firm and r 
= .53, p < .01 in the service firm). 

For Hypothesis 2 concerning overall PsyCap having a relatively stronger 
relationship  with  performance  and  satisfaction  than  the  individual  compo-
nents, following the approach taken by Judge and colleagues (Erez &Judge, 
2001; Judge, Erez, Bono, & Thoresen, 2003), we conducted what is termed a 
usefulness analysis (Darlington, 1990). Given the importance of a new scale to 
show incremental validity beyond existing measures, usefulness analysis pro-
vides evidence for the utility of a measure in predicting variance in outcome

variables beyond existing measures. More specifically in this case, the utility 
of the composite PsyCap was compared with each of the individual dimen-
sions to determine whether it was more “useful” than the existing measures 
of each facet. This process of comparing the composite to each component was 
also used by Judge and colleagues (2003) in assessing core self-evaluations. 

Results of the usefulness analysis reported in Table 4 shows that in gen-
eral PsyCap is more consistently related to both performance and satisfaction 
than each of the individual components. In this usefulness analysis, each in-
dividual component was first entered into a regression to predict the criterion 
variable. Then, the overall PsyCap was entered into the regression to deter-
mine the increase in multiple correlation value. These results were then com-
pared with the reverse situation where overall PsyCap was entered first into 
the  regression  followed  by  each  individual  component  variable.  As  can  be 
seen, the overall PsyCap generally across both samples increased the multi-
ple correlation value above and beyond its individual components. In the few 
instances where the individual component was higher, there was no consis-
tency in terms of which facet outperformed the composite index. For example,

in Study 1, Sample 2, only hope contributed additional variance to the self-
rated performance composite and none of the facets added additional vari-
ance to the satisfaction variable. In addition, in the high-tech firm sample in 
Study 2, none of the individual facets in the performance equation added sig-
nificantly (p < .05) to the model with only PsyCap entered, whereas in the ser-
vices firm sample only hope (p < .05) did. On the other hand, for the high-tech 
manufacturing sample, none of the individual facets added to the satisfaction 
equation and for the services sample hope, resilience, and optimism did with 
only PsyCap entered. Taken as a whole, this usefulness analysis lends sup-
port for Hypothesis 2. 

Discussion

State-like positive psychological constructs have recently been identified 
based on the considerable theoretical and research foundation work in pos-
itive psychology (e.g., see Peterson, 2006; Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Selig-
man, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005; Snyder & Lopez, 2002) and positive orga-
nizational behavior (e.g., Luthans, 2002a, 2002b; Luthans & Youssef, in press, 
2007; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007; Nelson & Cooper, 2007; Turner, Bar-
ling, & Zaharatos, 2002; Wright, 2003). Here, PsyCap is proposed as a measur-
able higher-order construct indicated by the components of hope, optimism, 
self-efficacy,  and  resilience.  Confirmatory  factor  analyses  provided  initial 
support for a 24-item PsyCap measure, and model comparisons showed that 
this PsyCap can be represented as a higher-order factor indicated by the four 
facets. 

Although the major focus of Study 1 was to provide initial psychometric 
support for the PsyCap measure, the follow-up Study 2 provided further psy-
chometric support for the PsyCap scale through confirmatory factor analysis 
with heterogeneous samples of organizational participants in high-tech man-
ufacturing and service. The Study 2 results provided only mixed support for 
the four individual PsyCap components in terms of their respective relation-
ships with performance and satisfaction. Nevertheless, the two study hypoth-
eses that there was a positive relationship between PsyCap and performance 
and job satisfaction and that PsyCap was a better predictor of these outcomes 
than the individual components were supported. 

We believe the main theoretical contribution of this study is the prelimi-
nary support for PsyCap as a higher-order, core-positive factor indicated by 
each of the recognized constructs of self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and resil-
ience. In particular, this research adds to previous theoretical considerations 
for such a core construct (e.g., Luthans & Youssef, 2007; Luthans, Youssef, & 
Avolio, 2007) that have drawn from psychological resource theory (Hobfoll, 
2002) and the broaden-and-build theory from positive emotions (Fredrickson, 


Positive PsychoLogicaL caPitaL  

  567

2001). In addition, the findings of this study of a core positive psychological 
construct have important implications for future research and practical appli-
cations. Nevertheless, before specifically examining these implications, some 
of the limitations of the studies must be noted. 

Study Limitations 

A  potential  limitation  in  Study  1  lies  in  the  common  criticism  of  utiliz-
ing college students as research subjects. To address this issue, we conducted 
Study  2  using  full-time  employed  organizational  participants  in  both  high-
tech manufacturing and service firms to further examine the factor structure 
underlying PsyCap and to test our study hypotheses. Related to the use of 
student samples in this study is also the limitation of their self-reported per-
formance indices. Although the hypotheses tests only included organization-
generated, supervisor-rated, or objective performance evaluations, the self-re-
ported performance indices used in assessing the measure in Study 1 may be 
limited in terms of social desirability. Beyond the threat of social desirability, 
self-rated performance may also share conceptual overlap with some of the 
PsyCap questionnaire items such as self-efficacy. 

Another potential limitation concerns the initial validation results of the 
PsyCap  measure  with  the  student  sample.  Because  this  sample  does  not 
represent  the  heterogeneity  of  samples  that  will  use  this  measure,  results 
concerning the factor structure of this instrument should be still viewed as 
preliminary. To begin to address this limitation, we conducted another con-
firmatory  factor  analysis  using  the  employee  samples  collected  as  part  of 
Study 2. Results were replicated providing evidence of the four-factor struc-
ture  and  higher-order  PsyCap  core  factor  holding  across  heterogeneous, 
full-time adult employee samples. Nevertheless, there is still a need to pro-
vide further evidence to justify the construct validity of this core construct 
using other samples in the United States, as well as across different cultural 
settings. 

We  pursued  a  strategy  to  modify  existing  scales  and  surveys  from  the 
published  literature  to  construct  our  measure.  The  advantage  of  using  this 
strategy was building on earlier psychometric work with established scales. 
The disadvantage is that there may be even better items to tap into each of 
these respective constructs that require additional item generation and vali-
dation. With the strength of evidence provided in this study for the existence 
of PsyCap, we hope future researchers will explore whether new items can 
improve the measurement properties of the PsyCap instrument tested here, 
as well as using a broader range of sample contexts. 

The  last,  but  perhaps  most  important,  limitation  recognized  in  this  re-
search is the cross-sectional research design with correlational relationships 


568   

Luthans et aL. in Personnel Psychology 60 (2007)  

used to assess the relationship of PsyCap with performance and job satisfac-
tion. One drawback of such research designs is that because of issues such as 
common method variance, the relationships between each of the four compo-
nents may be artificially increased. A longitudinal research design may un-
cover divergence among components over time. Unfortunately, except for the 
test–retest analysis for the stability of the PsyCap measure, we could not ex-
amine the role of time as a factor in these studies. Due to the way the data 
were collected on PsyCap and performance outcomes, we can also not deter-
mine the nature of cause and effect. It is possible that knowledge of their own 
prior performance outcomes may have affected the way in which participants 
ended up rating their PsyCap. 

Implications and Conclusion

Findings from this study would seem to have many practical implications 
for the development and management of human resources’ motivational pro-
pensities  in  today’s  workplace.  Employees  who  are  more  hopeful,  optimis-
tic,  efficacious,  and  resilient  may  be  more  likely  to  “weather  the  storm”  of 
the type of dynamic, global environmental contexts confronting most orga-
nizations today better than their counterparts with lower PsyCap. Although 
continued investment in financial, human, and social capital is certainly nec-
essary, it may no longer be sufficient in this environment. Initial utility analy-
sis indicates that the investment in psychological capital may yield very sub-
stantial returns beyond the other more traditional forms of capital investment 
(Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans et al., 2007; Youssef & Luthans, in press). 

Besides investment in and development of overall human resources, an-
other implication would be further focus on linking PsyCap to how leaders 
impact their followers. For example, Avolio and Luthans (2006) have recently 
proposed that leaders who are more authentic and transformational will have 
a more positive impact on their followers’ motivational tendencies. Indeed, 
the  leadership  literature  is  replete  with  discussions  linking  historical  lead-
ers with each of the components of PsyCap, yet we are not aware of any re-
search to date that has tested these relationships in combination as found in 
this study. Paralleling the work here, a great deal of the research on leader-
ship has focused on correcting what’s wrong with leaders, as opposed to ex-
amining the degree of PsyCap associated with effective leaders. 

In conclusion, this study provides initial evidence that positive constructs 
such as hope, resilience, efficacy, and optimism may have a common core that 
we  have  labeled  for  convenience  as  psychological  capital  that  can  be  mea-
sured  and  related  to  performance  and  satisfaction.  For  the  future,  research 
may  uncover  other  such  positive  constructs  that  meet  the  inclusion  criteria

for psychological capital that can be assessed, developed, and leveraged for 
performance improvement.
