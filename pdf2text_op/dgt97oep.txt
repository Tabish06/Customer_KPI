This  paper  investigates the  impact  of  acquisitions on  company  performance using  a  large
panel of UK-quoted companies  observed over a long time period. The results indicate that
acquisitions have a detrimental impact on company performance and that company growth
through acquisition yields a lower rate of  return than growth  through internal investment
Given the penchant for takeovers in the UK, at witnessed by the record level of takeovers on
the London equity market last year, our findings suggest that neither firms nor shareholders
are being best served by the existing financial and industrial system.

1.  Introduction

IT  IS  WELL-KNOWN  that  the  level  of  merger  and  acquisition  activity  varies
significantly  between  different  countries.  Thus,  for  example,  only  7.5%  of
Japanese  quoted  companies  were  acquired  by  another  company  over  the
period  1964 to  1984. By contrast,  38.4% of  companies  were acquired  in  the
US  between  1950  and  1972  and  42%  in  the  UK  between  1950  and  1977
(Odagiri,  1992,  p. 105).  An  important  question  raised  by  these  figures  is
whether  such acquisition  activity has a positive impact on  UK  and  US com-
pany performance  in the long run. In this paper we seek to shed some light on
this issue, utilising a panel of UK companies. We argue that the evidence shows
that  internal  growth  (through  investment)  rather  than  growth  by  acquisition
has  a  more  favourable  effect  on  company  performance  as  measured  by
profitability.

The relationship between growth and profitability  has received much atten-
tion  both  in  the  theoretical  and  empirical  literature.  Whilst  in  neo-classical
models of firm behaviour, growth  is merely incidental  to profit  maximisation
and the achievement of the optimal firm size, more modern theories of the  firm
provide  a  more  explicit  role  for  growth  in  firm  strategy.1  Penrose  (1959)
assumes  that firms seek  to maximise the total  size of  profits  in  the  long  run
and  this  is  equated  with  growth  maximisation  through  investment  in  all
positive net present value projects. However, there is a constraint (the manage-

'The  neo-classical theory  of  the firm dates from  Marshall  (1890)  and  Pigou  (1924).  Modern
theories of the firm in which growth plays a central role include those of Penrose (1959) and Marris
(1964).

rial  constraint)  which  puts  a  maximum  limit  on  growth  in  any  period  and
which results from  the fact  that if the firm expands too fast, its existing man-
agement  is  less  able  to  manage  the  growth  efficiently.  Marris  (1964)  goes
further  and  argues  that  growth  is an explicit  objective  of the firm's manage-
ment because of the benefits it brings (power, prestige, larger salaries, etc.) and
profit  maximisation  may well be sacrificed  for  greater growth. In this theory,
managers are constrained  by the stock market value of the  firm.

Whilst  the  above theories  emphasise  a  role  for  growth,  little distinction  is
made  between  the  relative  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  internal  growth
and acquisition growth.2 There are good reasons for thinking that acquisition
growth may be advantageous for  a firm. First, as an investment  there is little
delay between its purchase and commencement  of activities. The returns  from
the  acquisition  are  thus  likely  to  materialise  quickly.  In  short,  acquisition
growth allows a company to acquire a ready-made investment which includes
the personnel required to operate it.3 Penrose (1959), for example, argued that
acquisition  could  relax  the  managerial  constraint  and  allow  higher  rates  of
growth  to  be  achieved.  Secondly,  acquisition  can  provide  a  firm  with  new
internal  investment  opportunities  by  facilitating  entrance  into  new  product
areas and by providing new information  in those areas (Cable,  1977). A final
advantage of acquisition growth is that by acquiring the investment rather than
building it from  scratch the firm is in effect  removing a (potential) competitor.
This may be particularly important in markets which are oligopolistic in struc-
ture. The result of such an acquisition is that the success of the investment may
well be greater.

However, the very advantage of acquisition growth is exactly where one of
its disadvantages  lies. By purchasing  an  already  existing plant/company,  the
firm may  not  get  exactly  what  it  prefers.  Had  it  begun  the investment  from
scratch, it may well have designed something which was slightly different  from
what it has acquired. This might tend to reduce the returns which the company
expects to receive from  the investment. A second disadvantage of acquisition
growth is that  the  acquired firm might  not  have been  without  its own  set of
problems. Indeed these may have contributed to its vulnerability to acquisition.
But that aside, problems within the acquired firm will delay the returns on the
investment. Thirdly, even if the acquired firm has no problems, there may be
difficulties  integrating  it  with  the  existing  organisational  structure  of  the
acquirer.

The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  internal  and  acquisition  growth
suggest  that  firms  which  are  seeking  to  make  investments  may  not  choose
one  method  to  the  exclusion  of  the  other.  The  balance  of  advantages  and
disadvantages depends on each situation. Hence we might expect to see  firms

2 Kumar  (1984)  provides  a  useful  discussion  of  the  relative  merits  of  acquisition  and  internal

growth.

3 This  may  be  particularly  beneficial  if  the  company's  aim  i» diversification,  since  the  existing

management's expertise may not lie in the area of  the acquired  company.

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

engaging in both types of growth. Indeed, if a company has a certain  amount
of capital (secured either from retained profits, newly-issued share capital, or a
loan) which it plans to invest, then we might expect it to acquire up to the point
where the discounted  marginal  returns  from  the  acquisition  are  equal  to  the
discounted marginal returns from  investment internally.

Whatever the causes of acquisitions, our aim in this paper is to examine their
effects  on the performance of acquiring companies.4 We investigate this in two
ways. Firstly, we investigate whether there is a permanent  shift  effect  on per-
formance  following  a company's first acquisition.  This parallels  some of  the
early work in this area discussed in Section 2. Secondly, we examine  whether
there are differential returns to acquisition growth and internal growth (invest-
ment).  Our  results  indicate  that,  in  both  the  short  run  and  the  long  run,
acquisition  has  a  negative net  impact  on  company  profitability  as  measured
by the rate of return on assets.

We utilise  a large panel of  UK-quoted  companies over  the period  1948 to
1977. Our  contribution  is to  measure the impact  of acquisition  behaviour  on
company performance  controlling for other factors which have been found  to
determine  profitability.  In doing  this we integrate  the literature  on  company
performance  and  the  study  of  takeover  activity.  By  employing  the  specific
factors  found  to  be  important  in  explaining  company  performance  and  by
utilising  both  the  time  series  and  cross-section  dimensions  of  our  data,  we
are  better  able  to  investigate  the  effect  of  acquisition  on  performance.  The
rest  of  the paper  is organised  as  follows.  In  the next  section,  we discuss  the
relevant literature  in  particular  to  point  to  some of  the  limitations  that  our
study attempts to overcome. In Section 3, we describe our data set and focus on
the  methodology  we adopt  to  test  the  impact  of  acquisition  versus  internal
growth.  In  Sections  4 and  5 we present  our  results.  Finally,  Section  6  offers
some conclusions.

2.  Some limitations of the existing literature
Broadly  speaking there are two main strands in the existing literature and our
paper  seeks  to  overcome some  of  the  limitations  of  the  second  strand.5  The
first, commonly  found  in the finance literature, is the stock market  approach
which employs stock market valuations to determine the success or  otherwise
of acquisition. It assumes that the stock market is efficient  and hence changes
in the share prices of both the acquiring and the target companies, controlling
for  movements  in  the market  in  general  and  the systematic risk of  the com-
pany, represent the value of the economic impact of the acquisition.6

4 We examine  the determinants  of  acquisitions  in Dickcrson el  al. (1995b).
3 We  discuss  this  literature  in more  depth  in  a  longer  version  of  this  paper  (Dickerson  et  al.,

1995a).

6 Most  commonly,  the  market  model  is  used  to  calculate  the  gains  (Fama  el  al.,  1969).  See
Halpem  (1983), Jensen (1992), Mueller (1992), and Hughes (1993) for surveys of the methodology
and  reviews of  the literature on acquisitions  and mergers.


DICKERSON  ET  AL.

The results suggest that the impact of acquisition on target firms is positive. In
contrast, the evidence for the bidders is for a small or even negative effect  (for
example, Firth,  1979, on  the  UK). Overall, however,  the  combined  effect  of
acquisitions on both acquired and acquiring companies is usually positive and
is interpreted  as  evidence  that  acquisition  is beneficial  both  to  the  company
concerned  and  to  the economy in general (Halpern,  1983). A major  problem
with  this  approach  is that  changes  in  market  valuations  around  the  time  of
takeover could  reflect  not  only the benefits  of an efficiently  operating  market
for  corporate  control,  but  also  other  factors  such  as  undervaluation  due  to
investors overlooking the stock or an overvaluation  by those who acquire the
firm (Shiller,  1989, p. 64). Scherer (1988) has argued that if stock prices incor-
porate  random  valuation  errors,  then  at  any  particular  time  a  firm  can  be
undervalued  or  overvalued.  In  the  former  case,  acquisition  may  well  occur
and  the rise in  the  share  price  of  the  target firm reflects  not  efficiency  gains
from the merger but merely a market correction. As a result, Scherer (1988) has
argued  that  it is better  to  test  the effect  of  acquisition  by looking directly, at
company  profitability.

We therefore  favour  the second  approach  in this paper which is centred  in
the  industrial  organisation  literature  and  considers the determinants  of com-
pany  performance  using  accounting  data.7  However,  we are  aware  that  this
itself  has  problems.  In  particular,  it  is  well-known  that  companies  can  use
creative accounting techniques which may imply that their published accounts
may  not  be  a  true  and  fair  reflection  of  the  companies'  financial  position
(Griffiths,  1986), but  the use of  accounting  data  does have the  advantage  of
allowing us to test directly the hypothesis in which we are interested. Company
performance  is usually  defined  in terms of a profitability  measure  (price-cost
margins, rates of return on assets, etc). Macroeconomic, industry-specific,  and
firm-specific  factors  are  considered  as  important  determinants  of  company
performance;  typical  explanatory  variables  include  size  (Neumann  et  al.,
1983; Bothwell et al., 1984; Cable,  1985), firm growth (Neumann et al., 1983;
Bothwell  et al., 1984; Cable,  1985), industry  concentration  (Neumann  et  al.,
1983;  Conyon  and  Machin,  1991),  the  level  of  international  competition
(Neumann  et  al.,  1983;  Conyon  and  Machin,  1991),  leverage  (Neumann
et  al.,  1983; Bothwell  et  al.,  1984), and  economies  of  scale  (Bothwell  et  al.,
1984; Conyon and Machin,  1991; Cable, 1985).

Neumann et al. (1983) find evidence that the impact of the various influences
on  firm  performance  vary  over  the  business  cycle.  Cable  (1985)  shows  that
closer relationships between banks and companies in West Germany  facilitate
a  greater  monitoring  by  banks  of  company  behaviour  and  hence  improve
company  performance.  Geroski  (1988) and  Geroski  et al. (1991) find strong
evidence  that,  controlling  for  industry  and  time  effects,  profitability  in  UK
companies is persistent.

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

Finally,  and  of  particular  relevance here, a  number  of papers  examine  the
influence of acquisition versus internal growth on firm performance. The most
notable  study  in this  area is that  of  Meeks (1977). He uses  a  comprehensive
sample  of  233  acquiring  UK-quoted  companies  (1964  to  1972). His  careful
study  seeks  to  measure  accurately  the  rate  of  return  of  acquiring firms by
allowing for the extent of accounting biases. He compares pre- and post-acqui-
sition profitability relative to the industry  average around the time of acquisi-
tion (usually three years prior to the acquisition and, where available, up to as
much as seven years after). While he finds a small positive effect  in the year of
acquisition, thereafter  profitability  is substantially  less than  in the pre-merger
period—sometimes  over  50%  less.  This  suggests  that  acquisitions  have  a
negative effect  on  profitability.8

Ravenscraft  and Scherer (1987a, b) examine the impact of acquisition on the
profitability of US companies. Their study differs from that of Meeks in that by
using  'line  of business' data they are able to monitor  the performance  of the
acquired company even after  its acquisition.9 Their sample encompasses take-
overs  in  manufacturing  in the  US from  1950 to  1977, although  post-merger
performance is examined only in the years 1974-7 for which the line of business
data  is available. Post-merger profitability  is corrected  for  business cycle and
industry  effects  and,  like  Meeks,  Ravenscraft  and  Scherer  are  careful  to
account  for  potential  accounting  biases.  Overall,  their results indicate  either
a  deterioration  in  profitability  post-acquisition  or  little  improvement.  More
specifically,  they  find  that  in  47%  of  cases  acquired  firms  were  sold  off  by
the  acquirer  following  a  large decline in profitability  after  their initial acqui-
sition. For the remaining cases where the acquired companies were not sold  off,
a  significant  decline in performance  was detected  post-acquisition.10  Ravens-
craft  and  Scherer (1987b) focus specifically  on tender offers.  Once accounting
biases have been removed, they find that although post-acquisition  profitability
deteriorates, the decline is not statistically significant. Other studies in this area
either  confirm  these  negative  results  or  find  little  change  in  performance
following  acquisition  (Ikeda  and  Doi,  1983; Cosh  et al.  1984; Kumar,  1984;
Geroski,  1988; Odagiri,  1992; see Hughes,  1993, for a good survey).11

I One problem  with  his sample is that he examines  only  the first merger  undertaken by a com-
pany. Companies which make more than one acquisition are dropped from the sample just  before
their second acquisition. If companies get better (or, indeed, worse) at acquisition then the omission
of the results of further acquisitions could bias the results. Meeks (1977) argues that this allows him
to  better isolate  the effects  of  the acquisition  and it should  be noted  that only  30% of  his sample
of  acquiring companies  drop out for  this reason.

9 'line  of  business' data provides accounting data  on the separate components  of large compa-
nies and hence allows the performance  of  acquired companies  to be  traced post-acquisition.  This
has the advantage  that any change in profitability  of  the usually  smaller acquired company is not
swamped  by that  of the acquirer.

10 In addition to these general results, they also find some evidence that horizontal mergers have a
less negative effect  on the profitability  of  the acquired firm (although  this effect  is not  statistically
significant)  and  that  mergers  between  companies  of  roughly  similar  size  experience  better  post-
merger performance  than mergers involving companies  of  unequal size.

II We should note  that there is some evidence  that  non-horizontal  mergers fair better.

The  above  work  is  subject  to  certain  limitations.  First,  most  papers  do  not
examine the dynamics of performance  and especially whether profits  are per-
sistent. This is often  a consequence of not having panel data, but even where
panels  are  available  these  are  not  fully  exploited  Bothwell  et aJ.  (1984),  for
example, average  out  the  time  dimension  of  their  data  and  Neumann  et al.
(1983)  run  a  series  of  cross-sectional regressions. The  persistence  of  profits
suggests  that  an  explicitly  dynamic  framework  is  required  to  capture  fully
the impact  of acquisitions  on  performance.  A related point  is that,  if  profits
are indeed persistent,  then  it is difficult  to  know when the impact  of acquisi-
tion will be felt.  Looking only at the effect  of performance  three or five years
after  the  acquisition  (as  most  papers  dealing  with  acquisition  do)  may  not
capture  its  true  impact.  Hence  there  are  advantages  to  employing  a  panel
with  a  long  timespan,  while  also,  of  course,  controlling  for  time-specific
effects.

The  second  problem  concerns  the  specification  of  an  appropriate  control
group  to  compare with the firm after  acquisition.  In  the papers cited above,
the  effect  of  acquisition  is  elicited  either  by  comparing  pre-acquisition  and
post-acquisition  performance  of  the  acquiring  company,  or  by  comparing
acquirers  with  a matched  sample of non-acquirers.  In  the  former  case, com-
pany performance  may deteriorate for  a number of reasons (for  instance, the
increase in the size of the firm as a result of the acquisition). In the latter case,
the matching process is usually highly selective—industry, year, and sometimes
size—and  therefore  the comparison  does not  control  for  differences  between
companies  in  unmatched  characteristics  nor,  of  course,  for  all  unobserved
differences  between firms.

The final limitation is that no account is taken of changing levels of acquisi-
tion  activity over time. Typically the sample is selected from  periods of more
intense activity (thus increasing the sample of acquiring firms). However, this
strategy may bias the results. Acquisitions may differ in their success in periods
of  intense  activity  compared  to  troughs  in  activity:  for  example,  in  boom
periods, more acquisitions may be undertaken than is warranted  by economic
efficiency  simply  because  more firms think  they  should  be  engaging  in  this
currently  fashionable  form  of growth. This may result  from  fads  in  financial
markets  which  could  explain  the  fact  that  acquisition  waves  tend  to  follow
movements in the stock market12 or it could reflect  oligopolistic  responses  to
changes in  the power  of one oligopolist.13  It  would  be preferable  if a  longer
period  is chosen  to  test  the effect  of acquisition  on performance  so that  it is
characterised  by changing levels of acquisition  activity.

11 If  acquisitions  occur  only  for  efficiency  reasons,  it  is  difficult  to  explain  why  the  volume
of  acquisitions  is  positively  correlated  with  movements  in  share  prices  (Mueller,  1992).  For
a  survey  of  the  literature  on  fads  in finanrial markets,  see  Camerer  (1989)  and  see  also  ShiUer
(1989).

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

3.  Data  and methodology

In this paper, we exploit a data set and use a methodology which allow us to
overcome  the  problems  delineated  in  the  previous  section.  The  data  set  is a
large  panel  of  UK  companies  over  a  long  time  period  and  part  of  it  has
previously  been utilised  by Meeks (1977). This data  set  allows us to  observe
firms for  long periods both before  and after  acquisition  activity has occurred.
Additionally the sample period includes both acquisition  booms and troughs.
We  compare  acquirers  with  both  non-acquirers  as  well  as  with  acquiring
companies  before  they made  their first acquisition.  Moreover, we exploit  the
panel aspects of  the data. First, we control for  individual firm heterogeneity.
Secondly,  we  allow  for  the  dynamic  aspects  of  company  performance  and,
more specifically,  for  the strong persistence  effects.

The data set is the Cambridge/DTI Databank of annual company  accounts
(File 1:1948-77; see Meeks et al., 1988, and Goudic et al., 1985). It consists of a
large sample of UK-quoted companies.14 One problem with the data is that the
criteria for sample inclusion changed twice during the period and towards the
end of the period there is a large attrition rate in the sense that some companies
drop out for no apparent reason. Up until  1960, the sample included  all UK-
quoted  companies in manufacturing  and distribution.  From  1961, the quoted
company  was required to have either net assets of more than  £0.5 million  or
income of more than £50,000. In other words 'small' companies were dropped.
From  1970, the size qualification  was tightened further:  to be included a com-
pany had  to have net assets of more than £2 million  or income of more than
£200,000. We explore the implications of these factors  later in the paper.

Since  we  are  interested  in  the  long-term  performance  of  companies,  we
restrict  our  sample  to  companies  for  which  there  is a  minimum  of  10 years
of data.15  As a consequence  we have 2,941 companies  with an  average of 18
years of data  on each. Just under  30% of these companies are present  in our
sample  for  the  whole  duration  of  30 years.  Our  specific  interest  lies  in  the
impact  of  acquisitions  on  performance  in  our  sample  of  companies.  Hence
before discussing the actual methodology adopted to examine this hypothesis,
it is useful  to give some idea of the extent to which companies in our  sample
were involved in acquisition activity.16 Out of the 2,941 companies, 613 (21%)

''Considerable  efforts  were nude  to  'clean' the data and to check its consistency  and accuracy.
First,  there  were a  large number of companies  which either  shared  a company  number with  one
other  company  or  had  two  numbers.  Secondly,  the  file  (purposefully)  contained  repeated  com-
panies  as  part  of  its  structure  to  facilitate  manipulation  of  the  data  when  computers  were  less
powerful. These two problems were dealt with by assigning new numbers to companies in the  first
case and deleting the repeated companies in the second case. Thirdly, 49 companies had breaks in
their data series and for these we dropped  the thortei run of data. Fourthly, there is a  stock-flow
problem  which affects  the first year of data for any company.  Stock figures such as net assets are
available from  to, whereas flow figures such as profits are available only  from  r,.

15 We discuss later whether this biases our results in any particular direction.
16 We only have information on acquisitions within-sample. Information on out-of-sample  acqui-

sitions was available  only  from  1964.

made at least one acquisition. A total  of  1,443 acquisitions were made by the
613 acquirers, an average of 2.35 per company. Table  1  gives a breakdown of
company acquisition activity. As is clear, very few companies engage in a large
number of acquisitions, but a reasonable proportion  of our sample undertake
between  1  and 5.

Turning now to our methodology, the basic relationship which we propose

to estimate is

SjSIZEju + TjLEVu + 6{L)GU + al + -yl + eu 

(1)

nu  is the profitability  of company i in time / as measured by its rate of return
on  assets.  Specifically  we use  pre-tax  profits  as  a  proportion  of  the  average
of  opening  and  closing  net  assets.17  f3 captures  the  degree  of  persistence  in
profits  (Geroski,  1988; Geroski  and  Jacquemin,  1988; Geroski  et al., 1991).
SIZE)  (j  = 1,..., 5) are dummies for (relative) firm size (Neumann et al.,  1983;
Bothwell  et at.,  1984; Cable,  1985). For  each year, the quintiles  of net assets
were calculated. Firms could then be assigned to a size quintile in each period.
This  allows  for  a  non-linear  relationship  between  size and  performance  and
also deals with the problem that net assets are a nominal figure since the size
dummies  reflect  relative  rather  than  absolute  size.18  Leverage,  LEVU, is  the
debt/net  assets ratio where debt includes both  long-term  and short-term,  and
net assets refers to the end of period figure (Neumann et al., 1983; Bothwell et
al., 1984).19 Gu is the growth of net assets and we include this with a distributed
lag 9(L) to allow for  any delayed effects  of company growth on  performance
(Neumann  et al., 1983; Bothwell et al., 1984; Cable,  1985). Finally, a,  and 7,

17 We use  the average  of opening and closing net assets since profits are a flow which  annulate
over the period and therefore the rate of return should be calailntrd with respect to the average net
asset  position over the period.

1 * If there is an absolute size effect in addition to the relative size effect, then it will be captured by

the fixed time effects  also included in eq. (1).

"Debt  is  an  end-of-period  stock figure and  hence  the  appropriate  denominator  is closing  net

assets.

are  company-  and  time-fixed  effects  respectively,  capturing  (unobserved)
company  heterogeneity  and  time-specific  factors  such  as  any  aggregate
impact  on company  performance  from  the business cycle. Thus the  variables
of eq. (1) are standard and command wide support in the industrial  organisa-
tion  literature.  Our  specification,  by  incorporating  dynamics  and  persistence
effects  as  well  as  controlling  for  unobserved  heterogeneity  and  time-specific
effects,  extends this literature.20

There are a number  of issues involved  in the estimation  of eq. (1). Firstly,
we estimate  it  as  a fixed-effects model. That  is, we control  for  unobservable
time invariant  differences  between  companies  such  as  managerial  quality  or
industry-specific  influences.  These  company-specific  effects  cannot  obviously
be  estimated  but  are  eliminated  by  subtracting  company  means  from  each
variable.  Secondly,  there  is  the  bias  that  arises  in  dynamic  panel  models
(Nickell,  1981). In the presence of a lagged dependent variable, the  coefficient
estimates are biased. However, this  bias falls  as  T rises (it is proportional  to
l/T)  and  hence in our panel where  T is large (the average  T is  18 years), the
bias will be small.21 Thirdly, potential endogeneity issues arise with respect to
both  leverage  and  growth.  Current  profitability  may  signal  that  a  firm  is
performing  well and hence make it more likely that it can attract loans. Con-
temporaneous growth may be endogenous because current profitability  acts as
a signal that the company is healthy not only to banks but also to the capital
markets. Therefore,  external finance can be raised more easily and  this could
translate  into  current  growth.  Additionally,  high current  profitability  makes
greater internal funds  available (Kumar,  1984, pp. 42-3). We instrument  both
leverage and growth using their lagged values together with the second lag of
profits.

Building on the basic model in eq. (1), we investigate the impact of acquisi-
tion on performance in two ways in the results which follow. Firstly, we include
a simple  shift  dummy  (Au)  which takes a value of zero up to the first acqui-
sition  of  any  company22  and  a  value  of  1 thereafter.23  In  other  words,  it
captures  any  permanent  effect  resulting  from  acquisition.  Note  that  this  is
rather  a  harsh  definition  of  an  acquirer  since  even firms which  make  only
one acquisition are labelled as acquirers thereafter  and are therefore  bracketed

20The  dynamics in eq. (1) are those suggested by the extant literature (Geroski,  1988; Geroski et
al.,  1991). Of course, the presence of the lagged dependent variable will imply both short- and long-
run effects  from all the variables included in  the  specification.

21 However,  we  did  investigate  this  issue  more  thoroughly.  To  avoid  this  bias,  Anderson  and
Hsiao  (1982) suggest  taking first differences  of eq.  (1) to eliminate  the a,  and  then  using  jra_2  or
  M  instruments  for  A7rft_,.  The  Anderson-Hsiao  estimator  has been extended  by  Arellano
An-a_2
and Bond  (1988,  1991) to exploit all possible moment conditions  as the further  lags on  JT become
available  to  produce  a  more  efficient  estimator.  The  results  when  we  estimate  in  first  differences
with appropriate instruments for the lagged dependent variable are quantitatively  similar to  those
we  present below, with the biases being small  and in the expected  directions.

Note  that  this  may  not  be  the  company's first ever  acquisition,  but just  the first since  they

entered  the  sample.

2313.8%  of our observations have a value of Au  equal  to one.

with more frequent  acquirers. Hence defining acquirers in this way is likely to
bias our results in favour  of finding no impact from  acquisition.24

Table 2 reports the impact of acquisition on the rate of return on net assets
when acquirers are defined in this way. Regression 1 simply records the effect of
acquisition  on the mean  rate of  return  of acquirers relative to non-acquirers.
The coefficient  on Au  represents the difference  between the mean  profitability
of non-acquirers and acquirers. The results indicate that acquirers experience,
on average, a fall in the rate of return of some 2.4 percentage points relative to
non-acquirers,  so  that  whereas  non-acquirers  have a  mean  rate  of  return  of
17.14%, acquirers earn only  14.77%. Regressions 2 and 3 indicate that acqui-
sition has a negative effect on the mean rate of return even when we control for
firm specific  effects  (regression  2)  and,  additionally,  for  time  specific  effects
(regression  3). In  effect,  the  results  in  Table  2 parallel  the  earlier  work  with
matched  samples which we noted  above. Of course, these  simple regressions
control  for  only a  limited number of differences  between  acquirers  and  non-
acquirers, in particular  only fixed firm and time effects.  Thus we augment eq.
(1) with this acquisition dummy later in the paper to control for a wider range
of  influences  on  company  performance.  Nonetheless,  these  simple results  do
lend some prima facie support to the view that acquisitions have a detrimental
effect  on company  performance.

Our second method  of examining the impact of acquisition  stems from  the
observation that acquisition may lead to growth.25 We therefore investigate the
impact of acquisition growth and internal growth on company  performance.26
If acquisition growth has the advantages and disadvantages relative to internal
growth which we highlighted in the introduction, then we might anticipate that
these two sources of growth have a differential  impact on profitability.  Infor-
mation  on the value of acquisitions is available in our data  and we label this
acquisition growth (AGU). The remainder, total growth (Gu) minus acquisition
growth,  is  attributable  to  internal  growth  (IGU). We  retain  the  acquisition
dummy,  An, which  captures  any  permanent  shift  in profitability  from  being
an acquirer. The two growth variables (IG and AG) then indicate the impact of

24 In addition  to  this step dummy,  we also investigate whether there is an impulse  effect  at  the

year(s)  of  acquisition.

23 The  net  assets  of  an  acquirer  could  remain  nnchangwi  following  an  acquisition  if  it  were
financed by cash, for example, since in this case the company merely swaps one asset for  another.
26 The distinction between these two types of growth has also been made by Kumar (1984) in his

study  of  the determinants  of company  growth.

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

acquisition  on profitability  (via growth) around  the time of the  acquisition(s)
(since they are included with a distributed  lag). This allows the total effect  of
acquisitions  to come from  two sources—any  permanent  shift  in  profitability,
together with any growth effects  on  profitability.

4.  Results
Our results indicate that  acquisition  has a deleterious effect  on company  per-
formance  as  measured  by profitability.  This  is  true  whichever  indicator  of
acquisition we employ. Table 3 summarises our principal findings. Regression
1 is the basic model as described in eq. (I).27 There are a number of interesting
points which can be made. First, profits are highly persistent: the coefficient  on
the  lagged  rate  of  return  is  around  0.5,  similar  to  that  found  by  Geroski
(1988).  Second, size is an important  determinant  of profitability  and, more-
over,  the  relationship  appears  to  be  non-linear.  The  coefficients  indicate  the
importance  of  size relative to  the smallest firms. Ceteris paribus, firms in  the
second  and  third  quintiles are the most profitable,  and  there is evidence of a
hump-shaped relationship between  size and profitability.  Third, debt  appears
to  exert  a  negative  influence  on profitability.  Finally,  higher  growth  leads  to
higher  profits  perhaps  because  growing  firms  tend  to  be  more  dynamic,
although  the  coefficient  on  lagged  growth  is  negative,  partly  offsetting  the
contemporaneous  effect.

Regressions  2-4  examine  the  impact  of  acquisitions  on  profitability.  The
results  of  the  basic  model are  robust  to  the  changes  in  the  specifications  we
make to account for acquisitions. Regression 2 includes the acquisition dummy
defined  above. It is negative and highly  significant,  indicating that  the condi-
tional mean rate of return on assets of acquirers is below that of non-acquirers
in the period after the first acquisition. In particular, for the average company,
the marginal impact of becoming an acquirer is to reduce the rate of return by
1.38  percentage  points  (i.e.  in  the  year  of  the  first  acquisition),  while  the
dynamics  of  eq.  (1)  imply  a  total  reduction  of  2.90  percentage  points  per
annum.  Since the  mean  rate  of  return  across  all non-acquiring  companies is
16.43%, this represents a shortfall  in performance  by acquiring companies of
(2.90/16.43) around  17.7% per annum. Regression  3 adds an impulse dummy
(Alu)  which takes a value of 1 in the year of any acquisition and a value of zero
otherwise.  The  results  indicate  that  there  is  a  significant  negative  impact  of
acquiring  amounting  to  2.03 percentage  points  in  the  years  in  which  subse-
quent  acquisitions are made. With the permanent  effect  of having become an
acquirer  being 2.04 percentage points, the total impact in subsequent acquisi-
tion years is 4.07 percentage points.

Regression 4 reports the results when growth is decomposed into acquisition

lag was found  to  be sufficient  in the distributed lag on growth.

M Including  a  second  lag  on profits  did not  affect  the  results and  the degree  of  persistence  was

robust  to its inclusion.  Geroski  and Jacquemin (1988) found  similar results in  their study.

effect of acquisitions on profitability is now given by their impact on profits via
growth  (a  contemporaneous  effect  around  the  time  of  acquisition)  and  the
permanent  shift  effect  given  by  the  acquisition  dummy  (A).  The  combined

356 

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

impact  of  acquisition  is to  lower  profitability  by  1.86  percentage  points  per
annum.

The  results  in  regression 4 also indicate that  the different  types  of  growth
have very different  effects  on profitability.  A Wald test for  the equality of the
impact  of  acquisition  growth  and  internal  growth  on  long-run  profitability
yields a value of ^ ( l)  =  13.97, rejecting the null at any reasonable significance
level. This is confirmed  when we calculate the growth elasticities. If a company
were to double  its rate of growth through  growing internally,  then  its  profit-
ability  would  rise by almost  6.9%  in  the long run  compared  to  only a 0.2%
increase if it grows through  acquisition.29

5.  Robustness of our results
We examined  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  above  to  a  number  of changes in
definition,  specification,  and sample selection. Table 4 summarises the results
of these various changes for  regression 2 (Table 3).

5.1.  Changes in the definition  of profitability and accounting biases
There  are  a  number  of  possible  definitions  of  rates  of  return.  In  particular,
profits  can  be measured  either using operating profits  or adjusting  operating
profits  for  other  sources  of  income,  taxation,  depreciation,  amortisation
provisions,  and  interest  payments.  We  experimented  with  different  rates-of-
return  measures.  None  of  our  substantive  results  are  affected—acquisitions
are detrimental  to company performance  whichever  rate-of-retura  measure is
employed. Indeed, for some measures of profitability,  our results are strength-
ened still further  (Table 4, panel a).

One problem with accounting data is that there are a number of biases which
could affect  our results. Meeks (1977) notes that there is a possible downward
bias  to  profitability  resulting  from  the way in which  goodwill  (an  intangible
asset) of the acquired company is recorded  in the accounts of the acquirer. If
the acquirer pays more than the book value of its acquisition then it will record
the premium  as additional goodwill. This increases the asset base of the com-
bined  company  and  hence  may reduce the  measured  rate  of  return.  Meeks
(1977) thus adjusts  the net asset base of the combined company by subtracting
the increase in goodwill that is the result of the  overpayment.30

29 The mean annual growth rate, G, is 9.24%. This is decomposed into a mean of 8.20% internal
growth (IG) and  1.04%  acquisition growth (AG). As noted above, the overall effect  of  acquisition
on  profitability  is negative  because of  the large shift  effect,  Au.

Meeks  (1977,  Appendix  A)  calculates  the  overpayment  in  the  following  way.  He  takes  the
change  in  intangibles  from  the  acquirer's  accounts  over  the  period  during  which  the  acquisition
occurred. This value includes not only 'genuine' increases in intangibles (associated with investment
in intangibles) but also the valuation of goodwill of the acquired firm. He then adjusts the change in
intangibles in two ways. First he subtracts the amount spent on intangibles by the acquirer. Second
he  subtracts  the  value  of  goodwill  recorded  in  the  acquired  company's  closing  accounts:  this  is
counted  as  'genuine'  goodwill.  The  residual  represents  the  goodwill  adjustment  resulting  from
overpayment

THE  IMPACT  OF  ACQUISITIONS  ON  COMPANY  PERFORMANCE

The data  required  to correct  for  accounting  bias is available only  from  1964
onwards. To  test  whether  our  results are affected  by this accounting  bias we
first re-estimate our  model  over  the  shorter  period  with  profits  unadjusted
(Table 4, panel b(i)). We then compare the results with those from a  regression
employing  adjusted  profits. As can  be seen our  results were not  qualitatively
altered and hence we feel justified in not adjusting for accounting bias. This has
the considerable advantage that we can then employ data over a much longer
period.

5.2.  Attrition biases
We noted earlier that one problem with the data is that smaller companies drop
out in  1961 and  1970 due to changes in the criteria for inclusion. This  affects
just over 300 companies in each of the two years. Additionally, after  1970 there
is an appreciable reduction in the number of companies in the data such that by
1977 there are only 673 companies left compared to 997 in 1971. We investigate
the possible impact of these problems in the following way. First, the post-1970
attrition  problem  is examined  by  running  our  specified regressions over  the
period  1949-69  (Table  4, panel  c).  Secondly,  the  impact  of  the  changes  in
the  size  criteria  are  explored  by  comparing  results  including  and  excluding
the  small companies  which drop  out.  We did  this  separately  for  each  of  the
two instances when the size criterion was changed. First we estimated over the
period  1949-69  with  all  the  companies  and  then  compared  the results with
estimations  over  the  same period  without  the  companies which dropped  out
from  1961 (Table 4, panel d(i)). Second,  a  similar  exercise was done  for  the
period  1961-77 to test for the effects of the 1969 reduction in sample (Table 4,
panel d(ii)). In no cases are the substantive results altered by these changes. We
thus conclude  that  there is little evidence either  that  size biases influence  our
results or that  the reduction  in companies post-1970 is not  random.31

5.3.  Other checks
Previous researchers have used  a  number  of  different  definitions  of  leverage
including total debt over total assets (rather than net assets as used above), or
long-term debt plus preference shares as a proportion of ordinary shareholders'
funds. All of the results above are robust to using these alternative measures of
leverage  (Table 4, panel e). Additionally, we experimented  with changing  the
minimum span of data we are willing to accept for a company to be included in
our sample from  the  10 years used above. Once again our conclusions are not
altered  (Table  4,  panel  f).  The  final  check  of  robustness  is  to  examine  the
stability  of  the  results  across  various  sub-periods.  Splitting  the  sample  into

31 These  result*  are  unsurprising.  The  size  dummies  capture  the  relative  size  effects  of  firms
included  in  the  estimating  sample  in  each  year,  while  any  absolute  size  effects  are  incorporated
into the time specific effects. Thus changes in the size criterion for inclusion in the sample should be
reflected  in these two  sets of controls.

two halves reveals that the negative impact of acquisition on profits is larger in
the second sub-period (1964-77) than in the first (Table 4, panel g).

Overall,  we  can  conclude  that  the  results  are  robust  to  a  wide  range  of
changes  in  specification,  definitions,  and  sample  selection  and  thus  our  sub-
stantive conclusion, that acquisition has a detrimental effect  on company per-
formance, seems well established.32

6.  Conclusions
This is the first study  to examine comprehensively  the impact  of  acquisitions
for  a  large  cross-section  of  UK firms observed  over  a  long  time period.  We
compare  companies  once they  have made  an  acquisition  with  their  previous
performance as well as with non-acquiring firms. This effectively  integrates two
approaches that have tended to be rather  separate in the existing literature.

Our results show no evidence that  acquisition  has a net beneficial  effect  on
company performance  as measured  by profitability.  On the contrary, we find
that  acquisitions  have  a  systematic  detrimental  impact  on  company  perfor-
mance.  Not  only  is  the  coefficient  on  acquisition  growth  much  lower  than
that  on  internal  growth  but  there  is  an  additional  and  permanent  reduction
in profitability  following  acquisition.  Thus  this paper's  results  are  consistent
with other studies, some based on the American experience, which suggest that
takeovers do not  lead to enhanced performance  as measured  by  profitability.
Indeed, our results indicate that there is a negative long-term effect  of acquisi-
tion on profitability  in the UK.

Of course, we do not explore in depth the sources of the poorer performance.
It may perhaps be related to the nature of the acquisition, that is whether the
acquired firm is in  the  same  industry  as  the  acquirer  (horizontal),  a related
industry  (vertical), or a different  industry  (conglomerate).  Such questions  are
beyond the scope of the current paper, the aim of which was merely to establish
the link between acquisition and profitability. They do, however, suggest  fruit-
ful  lines for  further  research.

presented  in  Table  3  with  the  following  exceptions.  First,  the  negative  effect  of  acquisitions  in
regressions  2  and  3  are  larger  in  the  FD  specification  (as  expected,  the  direction  of  the  bias  in
the fixed-effects estimator is determined by the sign of the correlation between the variable and the
lagged  dependent  variable  (Nickell,  1981) and acquisitions are negatively  related to  profitability).
Secondly,  in regression  4  in  the  FD  formulation,  growth  by  acquisition  has  a  contemporaneous
negative effect and the acquisition dummy is now T"fjgnific*nt  The net impact of acquisitions is still
negative  however.
