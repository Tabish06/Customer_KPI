Research on philanthropy has made major advances in recent years; however, one issue
remains largely unaddressed: the relationship between intraorganizational family-based
relatedness and firm philanthropic involvement. The authors seek to remedy this gap by
offering and testing the proposition that family firms are more likely to pursue philan-
thropic involvements. Using a recent typology of family firms, the authors report on the
community involvement activities of more than 300 small community hardware stores.
Given the small, informal nature of operation and community activity, the authors
explore not only their philanthropic activity but also broader community involvement in
such areas as business, youth, religious, and service organizations. An interesting trend
emerges; firms reporting greater levels of family involvement report greater levels of com-
munity involvement than firms identifying themselves as nonfamily enterprises. The
authors conclude by reflecting on what this finding suggests for future philanthropy
research.

When it comes to giving, some people will stop at nothing.

I don’t see another family in the Bay Area—or the western United States, for that
matter—that has made contributions of the magnitude, variety, and impact they
[the Haas family] have.

THE ENIGMATIC FAMILY FIRM

What is a family firm and what difference does it make when a firm consid-
ers itself familial? These questions have dogged researchers for quite some
time. As Handler (1989) notes, the first question has been answered in a vari-
ety of ways that include understanding the family firm in terms of interde-
pendence (Beckhard & Dyer, 1983), generational transfer (Ward, 1987), and
ownership/management (Lansberg, Perrow, & Rogolsky, 1988). Recently,
Chua, Sharma, and Chrisman (1996) provided their answer to the second
question by defining the family firm differently, focusing instead on the
behavioral distinctiveness associated with intraorganizational familial
presence.

This article builds on the Chua et al. (1996) effort and posits that one distinc-
tive behavioral element of family firms is extraorganizational and, more spe-
cifically, social in nature. The underlying logic for this proposition is straight-
forward: Insofar as the family firm is not simply an economic entity but also a
family endeavor, it seeks to realize more than simply economic objectives.
With the presence of family, the firm becomes a more socially conscious entity
that seeks to include social considerations in its operating agenda.

Why might familial presence be linked with increased social involvement?
Building on Preston and Post’s (1975) logic of business and society as inter-
penetrating phenomena, we propose that the entwined nature of family in
firm creates a fundamentally different raison d’être. Families operate on the
basis of different criteria than firms. As Beutler, Burr, Bahr, and Herrin (1989)
propose, the family realm “ . . . differs fundamentally from nonfamily realms
or spheres . . . it has different ethics, different processes, and different dynam-
ics . . . [and therefore,] important and powerful effects on many aspects of the
human experience” (p. 806).

In our article, we explore the possibility of these effects. We begin by
reviewing recent work on corporate philanthropy (Burlingame & Young,
1996) and family firms (Upton & Heck, 1997) and propose that a lacuna cur-
rently exists between the two, that is, how intrafirm familial presence moder-
ates the enterprise’s philanthropic involvement. We then review and apply a
definitional typology of family firms (Litz, 1995) to a sample of community
hardware stores. We examine the philanthropic and community involvement
of the four types of firms posited by the typology. Finally, we conclude by
reflecting on what the findings suggest for both corporate philanthropy and
family-firm research.

THEORETICAL CONTEXT

RECENT ADVANCES IN CORPORATE
PHILANTHROPY RESEARCH

Burlingame and Young’s (1996) recent edited volume provides a thorough
and insightful survey of corporate philanthropy research. Contributors docu-
ment the vast and diverse range of subtopics falling under the umbrella of cor-
porate philanthropy. Whereas Yankey (1996) addresses the relationship
between corporations and nonprofit sector, Korngold and Voudouris (1996)
focus on the nature of corporate community-involvement strategies in volun-
teerism. Burlingame and Frishkoff (1996) consider the relationship between
firm size and philanthropic endeavor, whereas Lewin and Sabater (1996)
explore the relationship between philanthropy and business performance. On
a more synoptic level, Wood and Jones (1996) consider how corporate philan-
thropy fits into the broader context of corporate social performance, and Buhl
(1996) and Himmelstein (1996) consider the ethical and power-related dimen-
sions of corporate philanthropy, respectively. Finally, the volume includes two
discussions of challenges for future philanthropic research: Smith’s (1996)
appeal concerning the data-related limitations of philanthropic research and
Young and Burlingame’s (1996) offering of a new paradigm for corporate
philanthropy.

This volume makes an important contribution insofar as it synthesizes cur-
rent work on the topic of corporate philanthropy. It also outlines the range of
underlying motives for charitable behavior. According to Burlingame and
Young (1996), there are four prime impetuses: The neoclassical/corporate
productivity model, where philanthropy is part of a broader objective of profit
maximization; the ethical/altruistic model, where the corporation’s execu-
tives are seen as societal leaders who allocate surpluses to contribute social
value to society; the political model, where philanthropic involvements are
seen as ways to preempt government interference in the free enterprise sys-
tem; and the stakeholder model, where corporations seek a workable compro-
mise between divergent, and often conflicting, stakeholder interests.

EXTENDING CURRENT PHILANTHROPY
RESEARCH: THE ROLE OF FAMILY

Although this volume adds much to current understanding, there is an
apparent conceptual omission. The gap concerns the extent to which family
involvement in firm ownership and management might influence philan-
thropic behavior. The gap is concisely documented in the chapter by Wood
and Jones (1996). They note the range of predictors considered in charitable
contribution research. Although factors as diverse as industry type, firm size,
profitability, and regulatory context have been considered, the role of family

Litz, Stewart

has been overlooked. However, as Upton and Heck (1997) note in their recent
survey of family business research, such an omission is neither novel nor
unexpected. Family firm research has only emerged in its own right in the past
decade; until then, it existed largely in the shadow of research on entrepre-
neurship (Litz, 1997).

Regarding philanthropic behavior, however, intrafirm family presence
may be an important predictor. Upton and Heck (1997) note such a possibility,
citing the works of Astrachan (1988), Covin (1994), Davis and Stern (1980), and
Harris, Martinez, and Ward (1994). The logic of family presence being linked
to philanthropic behavior is straightforward; insofar as family and firm are
two distinct entities with two distinct agenda for operation and performance
assessment, we expect to observe differences in those firms with greater fam-
ily presence compared to those with less or none. As an institution, family is
characterized by a more holistic orientation toward the person (Beutler et al.,
1989), compared to business, where a more exclusive focus on profit maximi-
zation often prevails (Preston & Post, 1975).

Anecdotal support for this assertion is found in several family-dominated
firms. Levi Strauss & Co. have been extensively involved in a variety of phil-
anthropic efforts including education, health, and the environment (Cray,
1978; Stehle, 1998); distilling giant Seagram Company Ltd. has long-standing
involvement in the Canadian Jewish Congress (Marrus, 1991; Newman, 1978);
and the Rockefeller family has maintained a diverse set of social involvements
including work on population and public service (Harr & Johnson, 1991). Par-
ticularly convincing, however, is Meek, Woodworth, and Dyer’s (1988) case
study of one midsized corporation that underwent transformation on its sale
from a privately held, family-dominated firm to one division of a publicly
traded, professionally managed conglomerate. The assimilation into the non-
familial context was aptly summarized by one company employee: “Workers
used to be part of a family. Now you are treated as cogs in the corporate
machine, which is reflected in the management philosophy that you have to
get mean with these [production workers] and force them to work” (Meek et al.,
1988, p. 50).

Part of the rationale for these dispositions and involvements may no doubt
be attributable to one or more of the core impetuses noted by Burlingame and
Young (1996). For example, one biographer attributed John D. Rockefeller Jr.’s
philanthropic involvement to a family-based ethical/altruistic motive. In his
study of the younger Rockefeller, Fosdick (as cited by Harr & Johnson, 1991)
described him as possessing “a conscience that made a virtue of work and its
rewards, but likewise saddled the successful with an awesome compulsion to
regard his wealth as a trust, to redistribute one’s gain for the benefit of many
men” (pp. 205-206). More recently, observers of Levi Strauss & Co.’s dilemmas
in deciding whether to source from the People’s Republic of China attribute
the company’s eventual decision to preempt the Chinese option to prudent
stakeholder management (Katz & Paine, 1994).

However, another motive may also be at least partly responsible: philan-
thropy within a family-dominated organization provides the controlling fam-
ily with opportunity to make its mark on the firm as more than just a business.
Boulding’s (1970) conceptualization of economic, political, and social systems
helps in understanding this difference; whereas economic systems are driven
by motives of exchange and political systems are fueled by possibility of
threat, social systems are fundamentally different. They are more akin to love
systems, which Boulding defines as:

. . . those in which the individual comes to identify his own desires with
those of another. These are important in the explanation of the institution
of the family, of the church , and of nationalism, of the phenomena of phi-
lanthropy and self-sacrifice, and of all those areas of life where we do not
merely exchange or threaten but in which we identify. (author’s italics,
pp. 108-109)

Building on this logic of identification, we advance our study’s central hy-
pothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Corporate philanthropic involvement will be positively re-

lated with intrafirm family presence.

DEFINING THE FAMILY FIRM:

PRESENCE AND INTENT

One of the recurrent challenges in family firm research centers on the opera-
tionalization of the family firm construct is: How are family and firm to be
defined? As noted earlier by Handler (1989) and more recently by Wortman
(1995), definitional approaches abound, which is typical of an emerging con-
text (Porter, 1980). One definitional approach that combines a variety of
dimensions, including ownership, management, and intent, has been offered
by Litz (1995). By combining work on the separation of ownership and man-
agement (Berle & Means, 1934) with research on the intended and realized
aspects of strategy formation (Mintzberg & Waters, 1985), Litz conceptualized
a four-cell typology of different types of family firms (Figure 1).

Four types of firms emanate from the integration. One type is the potential
family firm, where there is unrealized intent to include family in ownership
and management of the firm. Another is the family firm, characterized by real-
ized intent to include family in ownership and management. In the potential
nonfamily firm, the family is involved in both management and ownership
but there is no intent to continue such involvement, and finally, in the non-
family firm, there is neither intent nor realization of family presence in owner-
ship or management.

Figure 1. A Typology of Family Firms

Practical examples of each type of firm are easily located. The potential
family business is exemplified by the entrepreneur who starts up an enter-
prise and hopes that someday his or her children (or other family members)
will take over the reins of the business. Following this line of logic, the family
firm could conceivably be the same firm with increased involvement of the
children (or other family members) in the firm’s ownership and management,
along with the intention to keep the firm “family.” This last point is an impor-
tant one, however. To the extent that such intent is waning or absent, the firm
becomes a potential nonfamily firm, where family members place little impor-
tance on keeping the enterprise a family concern. The final cell, the nonfamily
firm, is the end result of this erosion of intent. Although it is most readily
exemplified by the large publicly traded corporation, it is also present in
smaller concerns.

The typology adds to extant organizational theory by recognizing the pos-
sibility of familial influence along the two dimensions of structure and intent.
Conceptually, it recognizes a continuum of family involvement, rather than
simply limiting categorization to an overly coarse dichotomization of the firm
as either familial or nonfamilial in nature. Although the four-cell framework

137

remains vulnerable to overly coarse categorization, it nonetheless provides a
useful starting point for empirical inquiry. In the next section, we explore the
practical implications of the typology on community involvement of over 300
small U.S. retail hardware establishments.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

INDUSTRY SELECTION

The retail hardware industry was selected for this study for three reasons:
first, because of the fragmented nature of the industry (Miller, 1992); second,
because of the concomitant high level of family representation in fragmented
contexts (Ehrenfeld, 1995); and third, because of a demonstrated tendency for
small firms to get involved in the local community context (Thompson,
Smith, & Hood, 1993).

INSTRUMENT AND DATA COLLECTION

During 1995, we contacted 1,169 small hardware stores in the major U.S.
metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Miami, Long Island, San Diego, Chicago, Min-
neapolis–St. Paul, and Kansas City. After participating in a short qualifying
interview, the store’s managers were asked to complete a mail-administered
survey. The instrument, designed in accordance with Dillman’s (1978) Total
Design Method, was first pretested and validated on a sample of Manitoba
hardware stores.

RESPONSE RATES

Of the total sample of 1,169 stores, 340 (29.1%) were inaccessible (they had
either ceased operations or were unavailable to answer the initial telephone
call); 62 (5.3%) were incorrectly categorized as retail hardware stores; and 110
(9.4%) were in operation and correctly classified as retail hardware stores but
nonetheless refused to participate in the study. Of the 677 that were correctly
classified as retail hardware stores, 370 (31.65% of the total sample) agreed to
cooperate but failed to follow through by returning their completed survey,
whereas 307 (26.3% of the total sample) followed through by sending back
their completed surveys. In terms of the total sample, the 307 respondents rep-
resented a response rate of 26.3%. Out of the 787 stores eligible to participate in
the study, the 307 represented a 39.0% participation rate; out of the 677 stores
that agreed to participate in the study, the 307 represented a response rate of
45.3%.

DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE BY SIZE AND AGE

Size and age profiles of the responding stores are presented in Table 1. Size
is operationalized in terms of 1994 sales; age is measured in years of operation.

OPERATIONALIZATION OF DEPENDENT
VARIABLE: COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

Our dependent variable was operationalized in terms of five different areas
of community involvement: Business (e.g., the local Chamber of Commerce,
etc.); Charitable (e.g., the local United Way, etc.); Service (e.g., Kiwanis, Rotary,
Lions, etc.); youth (e.g., community clubs, sports teams, etc.); and Religious
(e.g., in-kind donations to church auctions, etc.). (See Appendix for a complete
set of all survey items used in this study.) Although we recognize that many
researchers interpret the construct of philanthropy more narrowly (involve-
ment in a local Chamber of Commerce is not typically considered a philan-
thropic involvement per se), we nonetheless see a broader operationalization
as relevant, given the more localized focus of the resource-constrained small
firm (Welsh & White, 1981).

For each item, respondents were asked to assess their store’s involvement
on a scale from 1 (no or low involvement) to 5 (high involvement). We also gener-
ated a measure of total community involvement by totaling the scores across
all five dimensions (Cronbach’s alpha of the five items was calculated at .76).
Summary statistics on the five areas of involvement, as well as their summed
total and number of hours spent each week on community involvements, are
presented in Table 2. As is apparent, all five activities received similar levels
of support. Service involvements received the lowest mean score, tailing
Charitable by .26, whereas Youth involvements received the highest average
involvement score.

OPERATIONALIZATION OF INDEPENDENT
VARIABLE: THE FAMILY FIRM

Building on the typology’s three-step distinction, we operationalized the
family firm at three levels (see Figure 2), which we appropriately term coarse-,
medium-, and fine-grained.

Coarse-grained: Family firms versus nonfamily firms. A logical starting point
was to simply ask, “Is your firm a family firm?” Respondents were required to
choose between “yes” and “no.” Of the 305 firms in our study, 42 (13.8%) iden-
tified themselves as nonfamily firms, whereas 263 (86.2%) identified them-
selves as family firms, thus suggesting that this variable was an important
descriptor for a majority of firms in our sample.

Medium-grained: Family firms versus potential family firms. Consistent with
the typology, we asked all respondents who chose yes in the first step to

indicate the number of family members involved in ownership and manage-
ment of the firm. As Table 3 and 4 report, respectively, the mean number of
family members involved as owners was 1.99 whereas the mean number
involved in management was slightly lower at 1.47. These figures are attribut-
able in part to 38 firms that identified themselves as family firms but reported
no family members directly involved in managing the firm.

Following the logic that distinguished between potential and actual family
firms on the basis of family rather than individual involvement in ownership
and management, we classified all firms with less than two family members in
ownership and management as potential family firms. Those with at least two
family members involved in each dimension were classified as family firms.
Of the 216 firms that provided data on both ownership and management, 144
(66.7%) were classified as potential family firms, whereas 72 (33.3%) were clas-
sified as family firms.

Fine-grained: Family firms versus potential nonfamily firms. A final set of ques-
tions was asked of all firms concerning their future. Building on Danco’s
(1980, 1982) assertion that the life of a typical family firm is just over 20 years,
we asked each respondent to identify who they expected to be owning the
firm in the equivalent of an organizational half-life, that is, 10 years. Options
that were offered to respondents included the present owner, family members
related to the present owner, or someone not related to the present owner. In
consideration of the possibility of closure, a final option, “the store will have
ceased operations” was also included. Although this set of choices is admit-
tedly a less than perfect descriptor of future intent, it nonetheless provides
some indication of likely future direction, and in particular, indicates whether

Following this classification logic, we classified firms as family firms only if
they expected the store to be owned by either the present owner or family
members related to the current owner and to be managed by either the present
owner or family members related to the current manager. If either of these con-
ditions was not satisfied, the firm was classified as a potential nonfamily firm.
According to this sorting rule, 54 firms remained in the family firm category;
that is, they identified themselves as both family firms (step 1), had at least two
family members involved in both ownership and management (step 2), and
intended to keep both ownership and management in the family for at least a
decade (step 3). The remaining 17 firms were classified as potential nonfamily
firms.

RESULTS

Given the categorical nature of our conceptual framework, we carried out
an analysis of variance across the four cells on each of the five dimensions of
community involvement, as well as the summed measure across all five
dimensions. To account for the possibility of sales volume (measured by 1995
sales), sales velocity (measured by 1995 sales per square foot), and sales profit-
ability (measured by profit margin on 1995 sales) confounding community-
involvement scores, we performed ANOVAs across the four cells for each of
these performance measures. No statistically significant differences were
observed.

As Table 7 reports, intercell differences in community involvement were
not statistically significant at p ≤ .05. Nonetheless, a noteworthy pattern was
evident. Consistent with this study’s hypothesis, family firms were more
involved in their community than nonfamily firms. As the first two columns
of Table 7 report, family firms reported more activity in all five areas of com-
munity involvement.

This family-based contrast was only heightened when firms characterized
as potential family firms and potential nonfamily firms were segmented out of
the family firm set. This suggests that the typology’s two dimensions of struc-
ture and intent influence interactively firm philanthropic orientation; firms
that seek to include family members in ownership and management of the
firm and maintain and/or increase such involvement are generally more
involved in community philanthropy. Differences between family and non-
family firms were most apparent in charitable, service, and youth involve-
ments, and least manifest in business-related endeavors. This pattern sug-
gests that familial influence may not be inherently motivated by bottom-line
logic. Rather, involvement may be predicated by the emergence of a more
holistic performance orientation that includes a desire to participate in
improving the stakeholding community’s well-being.

DISCUSSION

This study asks whether intraorganizational familial presence and the
intent to maintain or increase such presence makes a discernible difference to
an organization’s community, and by extension philanthropic, involvement.
Specifically, the difference we hypothesize is that increased involvement is
attributable to intraorganizational familial presence. Supporting rationale
emanates from the basic nature of the family unit as “a love unit extending
through time” (Boulding, 1970, p. 111). As the previous analysis demonstrates,
the results of our study provide early support for our hypothesis. Family
involvement, as shown by the reported behaviors of this sample of firms,
shows signs of making a difference. Firms characterized by family involve-
ment in both ownership and management with the intent to perpetuate the
same report higher levels of community involvement.

METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
AND INTERPRETATIONAL CAVEATS

Our conclusions must be qualified by a number of methodological and
interpretive caveats, however. First, data was collected using perceptual
measures rather than actual dollars or time spent. At one extreme, this could
mean that firms classified as family only perceived themselves as more
involved in their community. Although this does not preclude the validity of
our measures, it nonetheless warrants mention. A second limitation arises
from reliance on a single respondent, which is due, in large part, to the nature
of our sample of small, independent hardware stores. A third caveat concerns
the industry context. To what extent might there also be a latent industry effect
at work insofar as more in-depth transacting (common to retail hardware)
concomitantly facilitates stronger customer relationships and hence deeper
community involvement? A fourth issue concerns the additivity of the meas-
ures used. Although the interitem reliability assessments were sufficiently
consistent, viewing one area of community involvement as more or less
equivalent to another could be admittedly problematic. Another caveat arises
from the sample itself. To what extent are this study’s findings confounded by
the small size of these organizations? As Coutsoukis (1998) noted, organiza-
tional philanthropic behavior appears to be influenced by organizational size
because “the connections of large businesses to their environments are visibly
impactful and more consequential” (p. 7) vis-à-vis smaller enterprises. This
final concern also points to the need for a follow-up study to explore how
intrafirm family involvement is affected by firm size.

CONCLUSION

In their concluding essay on new directions for corporate philanthropy
research, Burlingame and Young (1996) assert that “More thinking is needed
on what core values actually drive corporate philanthropy and what the
rationale for this activity is, from the viewpoint of the corporation” (1996, p. 173).
The observed pattern of community philanthropic involvement being
related to the pursuit and realization of intrafirm familial presence suggests
that an important predictor may have been inadvertently overlooked. It sug-
gests that philanthropy researchers need to consider how to include the role of
family in corporate philanthropic decision making. This could conceivably
mean exploring issues of underlying intent, and even more basic, the possibil-
ity that a fundamentally different organizational epistemology is at work
when family is involved.

However, a converse possibility also warrants mention. Family presence
may not necessarily encourage more socially responsible conduct but, rather,
simply provide a different basis for rationalization and self-deception (Litz,
1998). Miller’s play All My Sons (1961) considers this possibility most candidly.
The play tells the story of a father who rationalizes his unethical conduct as a
company owner insofar as it helps preserve the firm for his children. This pos-
sibility notwithstanding, the presence of family appears to generally result in
the motive of profit maximization being supplemented with, or displaced by,
a more holistic appreciation of stakeholder interests. This only rings true with
what family systems researchers have already argued is the inherent nature of
the family unit (Beutler et al., 1989).

If this is so, then a logical follow-up question emerges: So what? This ques-
tion is relevant to not only our academic readers, but our practitioner audience
as well. In short, we see family firms as having the potential for making a very
significant contribution to the practice of corporate philanthropy. Presence of
family appears to provide a motive for social involvement and service distinct
from philanthropic rationales explored to date. The firm’s philanthropic
involvements provide opportunity to make a distinct family-based contribu-
tion to the well-being of a stakeholding community. Speaking of the social
involvements of the Haas family of Levi Strauss & Co., one company observer
commented that he was unable to imagine “another family in the Bay Area—
or the western United States, for that matter—that has made contributions of
the magnitude, variety, and impact they have” (Stehle, 1998).

In connection with Levi Strauss & Co., it is also interesting to note that this
company twice underwent change in ownership structure: first in 1971, from a
privately held family concern to a publicly traded corporation, and then in
1985, under the leadership of Levi Strauss’s great-great-grandnephew Robert
Hass, from a publicly traded entity to a more family-dominated enterprise.
This last observance may be of special importance to our managerial readers.
So often business leaders implicitly assume that bigger is better. However, big-
ger may only be different, and one element of such difference may be the
reduced social, and by extension philanthropic, involvements of the firm
(Meek et al., 1988). Given this possibility, we see a need for selectively encour-
aging family businesses to celebrate their family’s values in ways both neces-
sary and essential for the functioning of the good society. Even though the
social significance of family firms, like the entrepreneurs that generally found
them (Hallett & Hallett, 1997), is often overlooked (Morris & Lewis, 1991),
their collective impact on societal well-being may be more significant than at
first recognized.
