The Development and Resulting
Performance Impact of Positive
Psychological Capital

Recently, theory and research have supported psychological capital (PsyCap)
as an emerging core construct linked to positive outcomes at the individual
and organizational level. However, to date, little attention has been given to
PsyCap development through training interventions; nor have there been
attempts to determine empirically if such PsyCap development has a causal
impact on participants’ performance. To ﬁll these gaps we ﬁrst conducted a
pilot test of the PsyCap intervention (PCI) model with a randomized control
group design. Next, we conducted a follow-up study with a cross section of
practicing managers to determine if following the training guidelines of the
PCI caused the participants’ performance to improve. Results provide begin-
ning empirical evidence that short training interventions such as PCI not only
may be used to develop participants’ psychological capital, but can also lead
to an improvement in their on-the-job performance. The implications these
ﬁndings have for human resource development and performance manage-
ment conclude the article.

A resource-based view of the ﬁrm suggests that optimal use of human capital
can be a key source of competitive advantage because it is so difﬁcult for com-
petitors  to  replicate  (Barney,  1991).  This  resource-based  view  has  led  to 
considerable  attention  in  the  human  resource  development  (HRD)  ﬁeld
focused  on  evaluating  the  value  and  impact  of  human  capital  on  organiza-
tional  performance  (e.g.,  Arthur,  1994;  Huselid,  1995;  Huselid,  Becker,  &
Beatty, 2005). Recently, largely stimulated by the positive psychology move-
ment (e.g., see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Sheldon & King, 2001;

Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Peterson

Snyder & Lopez, 2002), there has been a call to go beyond human capital
(generally  recognized  to  be  the  education,  experience,  and 
implicit
knowledge of human resources) by focusing on what has been termed posi-
tive  “psychological  capital”  (Luthans  &  Youssef,  2004;  Luthans,  Youssef,  &
Avolio, 2007).  Speciﬁcally,  this  psychological  capital  or,  simply,  PsyCap,  is
not only concerned with “who you are” (i.e., human capital) but also, in the
developmental  sense  “who  you  are  becoming”,  your  “best  self”  (Luthans,
Youssef et al., 2007, p. 20)

In  deﬁning  what  constitutes  a  psychological  capital  resource,  Luthans
(2002a, 2002b) suggested that it be based in theory and research, amendable
to valid measurement, statelike and thus open to development and change,
and have performance impact. Given these criteria, the resources drawn from
positive psychology that were determined to meet these inclusion criteria best
were  efﬁcacy,  hope,  optimism,  and  resilience  (Luthans,  2002a,  2002b;
Luthans,  Youssef,  &  Avolio,  2007).  Stajkovic  (2006)  also  has  advanced  the
same four constructs in his proposed motivational model called “core conﬁ-
dence,” conﬁrming the inclusion of these four components by Luthans and
his colleagues.

The formal deﬁnition of psychological capital is “an individual’s positive
psychological state of development that is characterized by: (1) having conﬁ-
dence (self-efﬁcacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at
challenging  tasks;  (2)  making  a  positive  attribution  (optimism)  about  suc-
ceeding now and in the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when neces-
sary, redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset
by problems and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond
(resilience) to attain success” (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007, p. 3).

To  date,  research  supports  that  the  four  component  resources  load  on
the  higher-order  core  construct  of  psychological  capital  and  indicates  con-
vergent and discriminant validity with similar positive core constructs such
as core self-evaluations and relevant personality traits such as conscientious-
ness  (Avey,  Luthans,  &  Jensen,  2009;  Luthans,  Avolio,  Avey,  &  Norman,
2007). There is also growing evidence that PsyCap is signiﬁcantly related to
desired  employee  behaviors  (and  negatively  to  undesired  behaviors),  atti-
tudes (e.g., satisfaction and commitment), and performance (e.g., see Avey,
Luthans,  &  Youssef,  in  press;  Luthans,  Avolio  et  al.,  2007).  Furthermore,
recent  research  indicates  that  PsyCap  has  implications  for  combating  stress
(Avey, Luthans, & Youssef, in press), may help in facilitating positive organiza-
tional change (Avey, Wernsing, & Luthans, 2008), and mediates the relation-
ship  between  supportive  organizational  climate  and  employee  performance
(Luthans, Norman, Avolio, & Avey, 2008).

Besides  this  expanding  research  demonstrating  the  positive  relationship
that  PsyCap  has  with  desired  employee  outcomes,  there  is  also  conceptual
(Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Norman, & Combs, 2006; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio,
2007)  and  beginning  empirical  evidence  (Luthans,  Avey,  &  Patera,  2008)

that PsyCap can be developed. To date, a PsyCap Intervention (PCI) training
model has been developed (Luthans, Avey et al., 2006) and has been prelim-
inarily tested in an on-line exercise (Luthans, Avey, & Patera, 2008). How-
ever, additional research is needed to both test further whether PsyCap can
be developed via the PCI training model, as well as to determine its impact
on individual performance.

To  accomplish  these  goals  we  employed  a  pilot  study  with  a  student
sample whereby subjects’ level of PsyCap development from the PCI training
program  was  assessed  by  a  pretest,  posttest  control-group  experimental
design. Second, we conducted a follow-up study with the use of a sample of
practicing  managers  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  PCI  training  on  the  man-
agers’ PsyCap and performance. Before providing the theoretical foundation
behind our research, we feel it is important to discuss ﬁrst the trait–state dis-
tinction that is so critical to the developmental premise of PsyCap and the
training intervention tested in this research.

“Statelike” and “Traitlike” Characteristics
Through  the  years  in  psychology,  there  has  been  considerable  debate  and
discussion about the state versus trait distinction (e.g., see Allen & Potkay,
1981). Although states and traits are often treated as independent, dichoto-
mous  constructs,  we  build  on  earlier  work  suggesting  that  they  likely  fall
along a continuum that at the trait end are not easily developed to the state
end, which is much more developable (Luthans, Avey et al., 2006; Luthans &
Youssef, 2007; also see Chen, Gully, Whiteman, & Kilcullen, 2000). Speciﬁ-
cally,  we  propose  the  positions  along  a  state–trait  continuum  would  be  as
follows.

1. At  one  extreme  would  be  relatively  pure  states,  which  are  momentary 
and  very  changeable,  representing  feelings  (e.g.,  pleasure,  moods,  and
happiness).

2. Next  would  come  statelike  constructs,  which  are  more  malleable  and
open  to  development,  representing  the  positive  psychological  resources
found in PsyCap (e.g., efﬁcacy, hope, resilience, and optimism).

3. Then moving along the continuum would be traitlike constructs, which are
more ﬁxed and difﬁcult to change, representing personalities and strengths
(e.g., Big Five personality dimensions, core self-evaluations, and character
strengths and virtues).

4. Then would be the other extreme of relatively pure traits, which are very
ﬁxed and very difﬁcult to change (e.g., intelligence, talents, and heritable
characteristics).

In other words, the positive resources that make up an individual’s psy-
chological  capital  are  conceptually  proposed  to  fall  in  between  pure  states

and traitlike constructs. That is, PsyCap resources are conceptualized to be
more stable than states such as moods or emotions, but not as ﬁxed as per-
sonality traits such as conscientiousness or core self-evaluations.

Preliminary  empirical  evidence  supports  this  statelike  and  traitlike  dis-
tinction.  Speciﬁcally,  after  correcting  for  internal  consistency  reliability, 
the  corrected  test–retest  reliabilities  show  that  conscientiousness  (0.76)  and
core self evaluations (0.87) measures both had relatively high stability versus
the psychological capital scale (0.52) and the positive emotions measure (0.46)
(see Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007). Thus, there is beginning empirical evidence
that  PsyCap  falls  in  the  statelike  position  on  the  proposed  continuum.  This
knowledge,  combined  with  ﬁndings  suggesting  that  psychological  capital  is
developable through an on-line training exercise (see Luthans, Avey, & Patera,
2008), serves as a basis for proposing that the PsyCap resources of hope, opti-
mism, efﬁcacy, and resilience are open to change and development.

Theoretical Foundation of Psychological Capital. Right around the turn
of the last century (e.g., see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Sheldon &
King, 2001; Snyder & Lopez, 2002), the ﬁeld of psychology began to place
greater emphasis on examining what was right with people and what con-
tributes to human ﬂourishing and growth potential. The positive focus and
approach that was emerging primarily in the area of clinical psychology was
then extended to the workplace by focusing on both the value of micro-oriented
positivity in individuals (Luthans, 2002a, 2002b; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio,
2007; Nelson & Cooper, 2007; Wright, 2003), as well as more macro-oriented
positivity in organizations and communities (Cameron & Caza, 2004; Cameron,
Dutton, & Quinn, 2003; Roberts, 2006; Spreitzer & Sonenshein, 2004).

What  distinguished  the  PsyCap  constructs  from  other  positive  con-
structs that already existed in the organizational and personal development
popular literature was the focus on theory, research, and valid measurement.
In addition, the statelike and open-to-development criterion served to differ-
entiate PsyCap constructs from traitlike constructs such as core self-evaluations,
positive affectivity, and “Big Five” personality characteristics, among others.
Each of the PsyCap constructs is described in more detail below.

The Hope Resource in PsyCap. The construct of hope in positive psychol-
ogy has considerable theoretical development, research support, and is gen-
erally  considered  to  be  an  “empowering  way  of  thinking”  (Snyder,  1994, 
p.  2).  In  formulating  his  hope  theory,  Snyder  began  with  the  assumption 
that people are generally goal oriented; that is, people behave in such a way
that they are trying to accomplish something. Snyder determined there were
two components comprising hope: agency (willpower) and pathways (Snyder,
2000; Snyder, Rand, & Sigmon, 2002).

Agency represents  an  individual’s  capacity  or  motivation  to  both  start
work on a given goal and to continue down the path of accomplishing that
goal. Although motivation to accomplish given goals is important at all points
in goal pursuit, it becomes especially critical in times where impediments or

45

goal blockages arise (Snyder, 2000). The agentic capacity of hope within indi-
viduals can be heard when people express “positive self talk” comments such
as “I can do this” or “I will not be stopped” (Snyder, Lapointe, Crowson, &
Early, 1998).

If  agency  is  the  willpower  required  to  execute  a  given  route  to  goal
accomplishment  effectively,  pathways  thinking  in  Snyder’s  (1994,  2000,
2002) hope theory is the ability to generate those necessary routes. A high-
hope individual is one who proactively generates one or more pathways to
goal accomplishment in a given situation. When those with advanced path-
ways thinking are executing a given pathway (e.g., progressing toward a pro-
ject goal) and it becomes blocked (e.g., a technical breakdown), they show
the capacity to launch into predetermined alternative pathways to continue
toward goal accomplishment.

In  addition  to  demonstrated  positive  impact  on  athletic,  academic,
health outcomes, and psychological adjustment in clinical applications, hope
has also been found to lead to higher work performance outcomes across a
number  of  independent  studies  (Luthans,  Avolio  et  al.,  2007;  Luthans, 
Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005; S. J. Peterson & Byron, 2007; S. J. Peterson &
Luthans,  2003;  Youssef  &  Luthans,  2007).  The  mechanism  of  agency
appears to support organizational participants to be more motivated toward
accomplishing work-related goals, which in turn positively affects their per-
formance.  In  addition,  pathway  thinking  provides  managers  and  their
employees with the capacity to generate multiple ways to attain a given goal
(e.g., contingency plans), especially where some pathways become blocked.
Relevant to the main focus of the current study, Snyder (2000) and Snyder 
et  al.  (2002)  have  clearly  demonstrated  state  hope  as  being  developable
across  multiple  clinical  studies  with  the  use  of  a  goals-based  framework.
These  guidelines  for  hope  development  have  also  been  applied  to  human
resource  development  (Luthans  &  Jensen,  2002).  Thus,  we  propose  that
hope as deﬁned here can be developed through a short training intervention
process in the workplace.

The  Optimism  Resource  in  PsyCap. Carver  and  Scheier  (2002,  p.  231)
note “optimists are people who expect good things to happen to them; pes-
simists are people who expect bad things to happen to them” and the differ-
ence between the two is not trivial, as optimists “differ in how they approach
problems  and  challenges  and  differ  in  the  manner  and  success  with  which
they  cope  with  adversity.”  There  are  two  major  complementary  theoretical
streams  by  which  optimism  is  explained  in  positive  psychology.  Seligman
(1998) uses an attribution framework (i.e., explanatory style) whereby opti-
mists  make  internal,  stable,  and  global  causal  attributions  of  positive  events
and external, unstable, and speciﬁc attributions of negative events. Carver and
Scheier  (2002),  on  the  other  hand,  take  an  expectancy  perspective  for  their
theoretical  framework.  A  primary  mechanism  constituting  this  optimistic
process is the expectation that a desirable outcome will result from increased

Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Peterson

effort. Carver and Scheier (2002) note that when people have this positive
expectancy, they will continue to put forth effort even in the face of increas-
ing adversity. By contrast, pessimists often lack the positive expectation of a
desirable  outcome  to  even  initiate  an  action  toward  arriving  at  the  desired
outcome.  Thus,  it  follows  that  increased  effort  would  generally  lead  opti-
mists to perform better than pessimists.

Although  optimism  has  been  portrayed  as  dispositional  in  the  early
work of Scheier and Carver (1985), Seligman (1998) later suggested that it
can be developed, which he termed “learned optimism.” Indeed, in support
of  Seligman’s  arguments,  Carver  and  Scheier  (2002,  p.  240)  more  recently
have  concluded,  “change  in  an  optimistic  direction  is  possible”  through
developmental  interventions.  Thus,  although  individuals  may  be  more  or
less optimistic, there is potential to develop optimism, which provides theo-
retical  support  for  being  a  positive  statelike  capacity  that  can  be  enhanced
through intervention.

The Efﬁcacy Resource of PsyCap. Efﬁcacy is the positive psychological con-
struct that perhaps has the most extensive theory and research support (e.g.,
Bandura,  1997,  2005,  2008).  Multiple  meta-analyses  have  concluded  that
self-efﬁcacy  has  considerable  impact  on  performance  outcomes  (Sadri  &
Robertson,  1993;  Stajkovic  &  Luthans,  1998a).  With  roots  in  Bandura’s
(1997)  social  cognitive  theory,  applied  to  the  workplace,  efﬁcacy  has  been
deﬁned as “the individual’s conviction or conﬁdence about his or her abilities
to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources or courses of action needed to
successfully execute a speciﬁc task within a given context” (Stajkovic & Luthans,
1998b, p. 66).

Efﬁcacy differs from the other positive psychological constructs in impor-
tant ways. For example, efﬁcacy is a belief within the boundaries of a speciﬁc
task and/or context, whereas optimism is a general expectation of positive out-
comes. Also, efﬁcacy is a perception or belief about the process and results of
applying one’s personal abilities, whereas optimism is a positive expectation
about  outcomes  that  is  less  connected  to  one’s  personal  ability.  Organiza-
tional participants can be efﬁcacious about a particular aspect or task within
their job or work context and still be pessimistic, expecting to be laid off or
ﬁred  eventually,  regardless  of  their  abilities.  Likewise,  employees  may  have
low efﬁcacy about their abilities in a particular task or context for their job.
Yet these same employees may still be optimistic that they will ultimately be
successful on the job and/or in other domains of life.

Bandura (1997) has identiﬁed four widely recognized sources of efﬁcacy
development.  First,  when  individuals  successfully  accomplish  a  challenging
task, they are generally more conﬁdent in their abilities to accomplish the task
again. This task mastery enables personal efﬁcacy over that speciﬁc task. Sec-
ond,  personal  efﬁcacy  is  inﬂuenced  when  individuals  vicariously  learn  by
observing (i.e., modeling) relevant others accomplish a given task. If a rele-
vant  other  is  successful  at  a  given  task,  personal  efﬁcacy  to  follow  suit  is

increased.  The  impact  of  such  modeling  is  dependent  on  how  similar  the
individual sees him- or herself with regard to the role model who success-
fully  accomplished  the  task.  The  more  similar/relevant  the  role  model,  the
more effective the efﬁcacy development process becomes (Bandura, 1997).

Third, individuals can be persuaded by respected and/or relevant others
to be more conﬁdent. A simple example would be a respected leader inform-
ing one of his or her employees that she believes this associate has the capa-
bility  to  accomplish  a  given  task.  This,  coupled  with  providing  feedback 
to  the  employee  that  progress  is  being  made,  would  both  be  expected  to
build the efﬁcacy of the associate. The effectiveness of this method of build-
ing efﬁcacy is dependent on the degree to which the persuader has credibil-
ity with the recipient (Bandura, 1997).

Finally,  psychological,  physiological,  or  emotional  arousal  and/or  well-
ness may inﬂuence levels of personal efﬁcacy. A classic example is the orga-
nizational leader who provides caring emotional support and appreciation to
employees  to  prevent  burnout  and  to  help  keep  employees  mentally  and
physically ﬁt. This process and development from these four sources helps to
explain the signiﬁcant impact that efﬁcacy has on performance outcomes in
the workplace (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998a).

The Resilience Resource of PsyCap. Resilience “refers to a class of phenom-
ena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of signiﬁ-
cant  adversity  or  risk,”  which  enables  individuals  to  bounce  back  quickly
and effectively from adverse events (Masten & Reed, 2002, p. 75). Resilience
is the difference between those who recover well after adversity and those who
remain devastated and unable to move ahead (Block & Kremen, 1996; Masten
et al., 1985). Richardson (2002) argues that those higher in resilience bounce
back psychologically (including emotion and cognition) to levels at, or  even
beyond,  previous  levels  of  homeostasis  or  equilibrium  (also  see  Bonanno,
2004).

Much of the research on resilience has stemmed from clinical psychol-
ogy  where  therapists  focus  interventions  on  one’s  levels  of  both  assets  and
risk factors (Masten, 2001). Personal assets are those measurable characteris-
tics that predict positive outcomes and adaptation to adverse circumstances.
These  assets  are  often  referred  to  as  resources,  and  in  the  workplace  may
take  the  form  of  a  promotion  or  mentorship  program  (Masten  &  Reed,
2002). By contrast, risk factors are those measurable characteristics that pre-
dict  negative  outcomes  and  poor  adaptation  and  in  the  workplace  may  be
threats  such  as  an  abusive  supervisor  or  losing  a  big  customer  account.
Developing  assets  and  minimizing  risk  factors  are  the  targets  of  resilience
development interventions (Masten, 2001).

Considering  that  resilience  is  developable,  Werner  and  Smith  (1982,
1992),  in  what  has  been  called  “the  most  important  longitudinal  study  of
resilience to date” (Masten & Reed, 2002, p. 80), found that resilience does in
fact change over time. Considerable work in clinical and positive psychology

Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Peterson

(e.g., see Bonanno, 2005; Garmenzy, 1974), as well as human resource devel-
opment  (Luthans,  Vogelgesang,  &  Lester,  2006),  supports  the  notion  that
resilience can be developed through training interventions and lends support
for the statelike nature of this important positive resource in today’s turbulent
environment.

Linking the Theoretical and Empirical Support for Integrative Development.
As noted above, there is both conceptual and empirical (e.g., see Bryant & Cven-
gros, 2004; Cariﬁo & Rhodes, 2002; Magaletta & Oliver, 1999) support that
the  four  positive  psychological  resources  of  hope,  optimism,  efﬁcacy,  and
resilience have discriminant validity. Moreover, as indicated, these four in com-
bination have been conceptually (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007) and empir-
ically (see Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007) demonstrated to form a second order,
core construct.

Conceptually, the deﬁnition of PsyCap in the introductory comments sug-
gests  an  integrative,  common  link  running  among  the  four  dimensions  is  a
motivational propensity to accomplish goals and succeed. Speciﬁcally, Bandura’s
(2008) agentic perspective on positive psychology would suggest that the four
positive resources interact in a synergistic manner such that an individual is at
his or her operational best when one resource is informing the other.

An  example  for  helping  explain  this  agentic  interactive  relationship
among  the  four  constructs  can  be  found  in  Bandura’s  (1997)  distinction
between efﬁcacy and resilient efﬁcacy, whereby resilient efﬁcacy intentionally
(agentically) perseveres in spite of setbacks. Another example would be the
hopeful  employee  who  encounters  a  setback  to  goal  accomplishment,  but
intentionally and proactively rebounds quickly to pursue an alternative path-
way because he or she has high levels of optimism, efﬁcacy, and resilience.
As  Bandura  (2008,  p.  167)  declares,  “Unless  people  believe  they  can  pro-
duce desired effects by their actions they have little incentive to act or to per-
severe in the face of difﬁculties.” This belief to act intentionally comes from
their  reservoir  of  PsyCap,  which  in  turn  serves  as  the  foundation  for  their
motivation and striving to attain goals and succeed.

Allied support for the core construct of PsyCap can also be found in the
psychological resource theories (see Hobfoll, 2002). These theories posit that
psychological resources (e.g., efﬁcacy, hope, optimism, and resilience) can be
best  understood  and  treated  as  manifestations  of  a  larger  underlying  phe-
nomenon. Similar support comes from Fredrickson’s (1998, 2001) broaden-
and-build theory of positivity. She and others (e.g., Isen, 1987) have found
that positive emotional states can strengthen not only intellectual, physical,
and social resources, but also one’s combined psychological resources. Taken
together, the four resources synergistically interacting to form the core con-
struct  of  PsyCap  can  be  expected  to  lead  to  higher  performance  based  on
their reinforcing greater extra effort from individuals, promoting the genera-
tion  of  multiple  solutions  to  problems,  positive  expectations  about  results
leading  to  higher  levels  of  motivation,  and  positive  responses  to  setbacks.

In other words, there may be a motivational propensity found in PsyCap for
goal accomplishment and success.

Luthans, Avolio et al. (2007) have provided direct empirical support for
PsyCap  as  a  core  construct.  Speciﬁcally,  they  found  that  each  of  the  four
dimensions best load onto the psychological capital core factor. In addition,
a recent study provided further support for the core construct by empirically
demonstrating  that  PsyCap  predicted  unique  variance  in  a  number  of  atti-
tudes  and  behaviors  of  a  large  sample  of  employees  beyond  their  demo-
graphics,  core  self-evaluation,  personality  traits,  and  person–organization
and person–job ﬁt (Avey, Luthans, & Youssef, in press).

In  sum,  there  is  considerable  support  for  PsyCap  as  a  core  construct
and its relationship to attitudes, behaviors, and performance. Now the time
has  come  to  test  the  developmental  nature  of  PsyCap.  As  indicated  in  the
stated purposes of this research, we will for the ﬁrst time experimentally test
the  development  and  possible  causal  performance  impact  of  the  core  con-
struct of PsyCap with the use of a face-to-face short-term training interven-
tion strategy proposed by Luthans, Avey et al. (2006). The primary research
question that drove this study is the following: Can the four positive constructs
of hope, optimism, efﬁcacy, and resilience, in combination as a core construct rep-
resenting  psychological  capital,  be  developed  in  a  short  training  intervention  for
positive impact on the participants’ performance back on the job?

Methods

Pilot Study Procedures. We used a highly controlled pilot study in order
to determine ﬁrst the viability of a recently proposed (see Luthans, Avey et al.,
2006; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007, Chapter 8) training intervention
model (described in detail below) for impacting the four constructs and the
combined core factor of psychological capital. This pilot utilized a sample of
242 advanced management students from a large midwestern university. The
focus and examples used in the training intervention were slightly adapted to
be relevant to this sample. A little over half (58%) of this sample were male
and their average age was 21.1 (SD ⫽ 2.66). These participants were told they
would be participating in leadership training. Importantly, the participants
were randomly assigned to treatment (N ⫽ 153) or control (N ⫽ 89) groups.
The treatment groups received a 2-hour training intervention conducted
by training facilitators that utilized a series of exercises and group discussions
designed  to  impact  the  participants’  level  of  efﬁcacy,  hope,  optimism,  and
resilience, individually and overall in terms of their PsyCap. The psychological
capital intervention (PCI) model for this training is depicted in Figure 1, and a
brief summary of the speciﬁc content is found in the Appendix (a narrative of

ticipants received the intervention ﬁrst targeting hope and efﬁcacy, followed
by resilience and optimism. The alternative order included ﬁrst receiving the
intervention focused on resilience and optimism followed by hope and efﬁ-
cacy. Analysis of variance revealed no signiﬁcant mean difference in partici-
pants’ level of psychological capital between the ordering conditions in both
pre-  and  posttests.  Those  randomly  assigned  to  the  control  groups  were

given a different (i.e., next best) intervention that focused on group decision
making (not the four positive constructs), and included similar duration and
exercise format to maintain as much equivalence of the treatment and con-
trol conditions as possible.

Main Study Procedures. After the pilot study was completed and assessed,
the main study consisted of a heterogeneous group of managers (N ⫽ 80) sam-
pled across a wide variety of organizations in a medium-sized midwestern city.
Volunteers were recruited by the university to participate in a public service
“leadership training workshop” (i.e., the same 2-hour intervention as depicted
in Figure 1 and the Appendix used in the pilot phase, but with slightly differ-
ent,  more  relevant  examples  for  this  sample  of  practicing  managers).  All 
the participants received the 2-hour training intervention at the same time in the
same facility. This sample had an average age of 36 years with, on average, a
little over a dozen years of full-time work experience. The population was 54%
male and predominantly white (76%; 4% were African American, 9% Asian,
7% Hispanic, and 1% Native American).

The Intervention Training Implementation. As indicated above, the con-
tent of the psychological capital training intervention utilized in both the pilot
and main study is summarized in Figure 1 and the Appendix and is drawn
from Luthans and colleagues (Luthans, Avey et al., 2006; Luthans, Youssef, & 
Avolio, 2007, Chapter 8). The goals in implementing this psychological capi-
tal intervention (PCI) were (a) short duration to minimize disruption in the
work process, (b) designed to inﬂuence each of the four positive psychologi-
cal dimensions, and (c) designed to inﬂuence the overall positive psychological
core construct through an integration of the underlying principles and devel-
opmental dimensions of each of the four individual PsyCap resources. Our
purpose of the focused short duration followed the models of Locke, Shaw,
Saari, and Latham (1981) and Luthans and Kreitner (1985), who have demon-
strated successful similar short-term goal setting and reinforcement interven-
tions to improve performance (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1997, 2001).

The intervention training implementation included two stages. First, we
used  a  series  of  exercises  speciﬁc  to  each  of  the  four  constructs  to  impact
development (see Appendix). Next, we utilized similar, but more integrative,
writing,  discussion,  and  reﬂective  exercises.  The  purpose  of  this  second
phase  of  the  training  was  to  integrate  the  development  of  the  individual
facets  into  an  understanding  and  operationalization  of  the  overall  positive
psychological construct.

Examples  of  the  exercises  used  in  both  developing  the  individual
dimensions and then integrating them into the overall PsyCap included one
that focused on broadening the hope-oriented agentic capacity and pathways
thinking toward a speciﬁc goal. First, each participant was asked to consider
and then write down a personal goal or goals. Drawing from Snyder’s (2000)
hope theory and speciﬁc guidelines from hope development used in clinical
applications, the facilitator (one of the researchers) led participants through

52

Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Peterson

a  series  of  techniques  to  set  and  phrase  goals  to  increase  agentic  capacity
(Bandura, 2008). This included parceling large goals into manageable units
(called  “stepping”  in  hope  development;  see  Snyder,  2000),  thereby  also
increasing efﬁcacy over smaller subgoals.

Next,  participants  were  guided  into  considering  multiple  pathways  to
accomplishing each goal and to share (i.e., model for others) those routes in
small discussion groups within the intervention session. These small-group
discussions then led to additional pathways to accomplishing the goal. Thus,
the  capacity  for  pathway  generation  was  expected  to  be  increased  through
vicarious learning and in turn to enhance participants’ level of efﬁcacy in uti-
lizing  the  hope  application  of  deriving  multiple  pathways  to  accomplish  a
given goal. In addition, by increasing their efﬁcacy to accomplish the goal,
the  participants  were  expected  to  increase  their  positive  expectations  of 
goal accomplishment and thus their levels of optimism.

Next, through the development of several pathways to accomplish the
goal, levels of resilience were expected to increase given that multiple path-
ways  allow  individuals  to  bounce  back  to  being  successful  by  selecting  an
alternate pathway  when  the  original  pathway  becomes  blocked.  In  other
words, part of resilience is bouncing back after a setback. These setbacks can
be when a goal is not reached and the pathway to that goal becomes blocked.
By increasing the ability and efﬁcacy to develop multiple pathways, individ-
uals may choose an alternate pathway when the current one is blocked, get-
ting them proactively re-energized to succeed.

Given  the  assumption  in  optimism  development  that  people  tend  to
make  unrealistically  negative  distortions,  which  in  turn  generate  negative
affective thought processes and behavior, the perspective behind the interven-
tion training included making participants more aware of their thoughts and
identifying them as negative. Once identiﬁed, these negative thoughts can be
isolated  and  challenged  by  the  participant  and  by  others  in  the  discussion
groups. The goal of this technique was to make beliefs or expectations about
the future more realistically optimistic. As shown in Figure 1, PCI, and con-
tent  summarized  in  the  Appendix,  such  developmental  inputs  are  drawn
from each of the four constructs and then integrated as described above dur-
ing this 2-hour training intervention.

In conclusion, the PCI implementation was designed to increase levels
of  each  of  the  four  resources  and,  importantly,  the  overall  PsyCap  of  the
training participants. The PCI guidelines draw from extant research on each
capacity grounded in clinical psychology (hope, resilience), attribution and
expectancy theories (optimism) and Bandura’s (1997) work in efﬁcacy and its
corresponding sources of development (Bandura, 1997, 2000). In the training
intervention for both the pilot and main study we applied these training prin-
ciples  and  guidelines  of  development  from  each  respective  dimension/
construct and overall PsyCap. The training intervention leveraged techniques
from  both  theoretical  bases  (e.g.,  Bandura,  1997;  Carver  &  Scheier,  2002;

Masten  &  Reed,  2002;  Snyder,  2000)  and  more  practical  implementation
guidelines (e.g., Bandura, 2000; Coutu, 2002; Seligman, 1998; Snyder, 1994;
Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998b).

Unit of Analysis, Measures, and Analysis Techniques. A recent review by
Yammarino, Dionne, Chun, and Dansereau (2005) found that less than 30%
of leadership studies explicitly stated levels of analysis and measurement,
which is considered the starting point for any theory and research effort (Klein,
Dansereau, & Hall, 1994). Thus, we want to point out that the present study
measured and analyzed the positive constructs and PsyCap at the individual
level of analysis. However, the individual-level focus used here does not pre-
clude for the future focusing on dyadic, group, or organizational levels of
analysis for measuring and enhancing positive psychological capital (e.g.,
Youssef & Luthans, 2005). In addition, the performance outcomes were also
measured and analyzed at the individual level of analysis.

Measurement  of  PsyCap. In  both  phases  of  this  research,  PsyCap  was
measured  with  the  use  of  the  24-item  psychological  capital  questionnaire
(PCQ)  found  in  its  entirety  in  Luthans,  Youssef,  and  Avolio  (2007)  and
empirically validated by Luthans, Avolio et al. (2007). Permission to use the
PCQ is available to researchers free of charge at www.mindgarden.com. This
instrument was administered twice within 3 days before and 3 days after the
training intervention in both the pilot and main study.

The  24  items  that  make  up  the  survey  were  adapted  from  previously
published  scales  that  have  been  analyzed  and  supported  in  the  positive  psy-
chology literature across multiple studies and have been used in previous work-
place  studies  by  themselves  and  in  combination  (e.g.,  see  Avey,  Luthans  &
Youssef, in press; Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2005; Luthans,
Norman  et  al.,  2008;  Youssef  &  Luthans,  2007).  Speciﬁcally,  the  instrument
consists of six items adapted from each of the following scales: (a) hope (Snyder
et al., 1996); (b) resilience (Wagnild & Young, 1993); (c) optimism (Scheier &
Carver, 1985); and (d) efﬁcacy (Parker, 1998). Sample items from each of the
subscales  included:  “I  feel  conﬁdent  helping  to  set  targets/goals  in  my  area 
of work” (efﬁcacy); “If I should ﬁnd myself in a jam at work, I could think of
many  ways  to  get  out  of  it”  (hope);  “I  always  look  on  the  bright  side 
of  things  regarding  my  job”  (optimism);  and  “I  usually  manage  difﬁculties
one way or another at work” (resilience). Responses were given on a 6-point
Likert-type scale: 1 ⫽ strongly disagree, 2 ⫽ disagree, 3 ⫽ somewhat disagree,
4 ⫽ somewhat agree, 5 ⫽ agree, and 6 ⫽ strongly agree.

All  the  subscales  in  this  study  demonstrated  reliability  alphas  greater
than 0.70 with the exception of resilience in the student sample of the pilot 
(a ⫽ 0.69).  However,  resilience  did  demonstrate  alpha  above  0.70  in  the
practicing managers’ sample. In addition, the overall 24-item composite PCQ
demonstrated reliability alphas greater than 0.90 in both samples. Because this
is a relatively new scale, we conducted a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA)
with  the  two  samples  to  determine  whether  we  could  replicate  validation

results reported previously by Luthans, Avolio et al. (2007). This CFA used
the  maximum-likelihood  procedure  on  the  pilot  sample  and  the  heteroge-
neous sample of managers.

The higher-order model we tested had six items loading on each latent
factor  (i.e.,  hope,  resilience,  optimism,  and  efﬁcacy),  as  well  as  the  four
latent factors loading on an overall higher order, core factor. All of the item
loadings were signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01) on their respective latent factor. Results
for the pilot sample were standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) ⫽
0.051, RMSEA ⫽ 0.051, comparative ﬁt index (CFI) ⫽ 0.937. With the use
of  the  Hu  and  Bentler  (1999)  combinatorial  rule  that  two  of  three  indices
should ﬁt the recommendation of SRMR ⱕ 0.08, RMSEA ⱕ 0.06, and CFI
ⱕ 0.95,  results  from  this  sample  suggest  moderate  ﬁt  for  the  higher-order
factor  model.  Results  for  the  practicing  managers’  sample  were  SRMR  ⫽
0.046,  RMSEA  ⫽ 0.044,  CFI  ⫽ 0.950,  providing  evidence  for  a  strong
model  ﬁt  based  on  all  three  indices.  Thus,  supporting  previous  research
(Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007), ﬁndings from both the pilot and main study
samples in this study provide support that the four positive constructs repre-
sent an underlying latent core positive psychological factor (PsyCap).

We  next  compared  the  proposed  higher-order  model  of  each  capacity
loading  to  the  higher-order  factor  with  four  competing  models,  including
three  models  that  combined  various  dimensions  as  well  as  a  single-factor
model in which all items loaded to one factor. Results shown in Table 1 indi-
cate the higher-order factor model ﬁt the observed data better than the com-
peting  models  across  both  samples.  Results  from  this  model  comparison
provide  support  for  the  higher  order  and  replicate  results  of  the  previous
study (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007).

Performance  Measures. Performance  measures  were  not  collected  for  the
pilot sample, as the previously noted purpose was to determine under highly
controlled conditions the viability of the PCI model for developing PsyCap uti-
lizing random assignment to treatment and control groups. The sample for the
main study consisting of the cross-section of managers in a wide variety of orga-
nizations used a multisource rating of performance. Speciﬁcally, in this sample
we administered a self-rated four-item performance measure with a 1–10 rating
scale (e.g., “How would you rate your performance/effectiveness as compared
with your peers?”) to participants within 1 week before and a week after the
intervention. Importantly, however, in addition the participants’ managers also
rated their performance a week before and a week after the training interven-
tion with the use of the same performance scale reworded for managers rating the
target participant. Separate analyses were run for both self- and their manager-
rated  performance.  Participants’  managers  were  told  the  purpose  for  their
conﬁdential  ratings  of  the  trainees’  on-the-job  performance  was  part  of  a
university-related  research  project.  However,  in  order  to  help  minimize  rater
bias effects, the participants’ managers were not directly told that these individ-
uals were involved in a developmental training intervention.

Analysis Techniques. We conducted paired-sample t-tests for both the pilot
and manager samples. This analysis was deemed appropriate given the focus
on  mean  differences  at  two  points  in  time  (pre-  and  postintervention).  In
addition, we also calculated conﬁdence intervals, effect sizes, and binomial
effect-size displays.

Results
As shown in Table 2, the pilot-sample participants in the treatment group sig-
niﬁcantly reported their psychological capital from Time 1 to Time 2 as being
higher (Time 1 M ⫽ 4.61 and Time 2 M ⫽ 4.81, t[152] ⫽ 5.16, p ⬍ 0.001).
The randomly assigned comparison-group participants who underwent a differ-
ent group decision-making intervention demonstrated no signiﬁcant increase
in their reported PsyCap scores (Time 1 M ⫽ 4.63 and Time 2 M ⫽ 4.65, t ⫽
0.54, p ⫽ 0.59). Given that the pilot sample included a randomly assigned
control group, we also conducted a more rigorous test of the mean differences
by running an ANCOVA, which compared the mean differences for the treat-
ment and control groups at Time 2 while controlling for the PsyCap values at
Time 1. This ANCOVA predicts the extent to which the Time 2 PsyCap values
were  uniquely  due  to  the  treatment  above  and  beyond  the  initial  (Time  1)
values. In a general linear model, the Time 1 values were entered as a covari-
ate, and the dummy-coded group variable (treatment or control) was entered
as  a  ﬁxed  factor  predicting  level  of  PsyCap  at  Time  2.  Results  as  shown  in
Table 3 indicate that the dummy-coded treatment group variable was a signif-
icant predictor of the PsyCap values at Time 2 while controlling for values at
Time  1  (F ⫽ 11.41, p ⬍ 0.01),  suggesting  the  effect  of  the  treatment  inﬂu-
enced values at Time 2 above and beyond values at Time 1.

The sample of managers who underwent the training intervention in the
main study had signiﬁcantly higher levels of PsyCap (Time 1 M ⫽ 4.79 and
Time 2 M ⫽ 4.93, t ⫽ 2.99, p ⬍ 0.01) following the training intervention.

we also calculated bivariate correlations between PsyCap and performance.

Cap were signiﬁcantly related to their performance. Speciﬁcally, the correla-

Discussion
The twofold purpose of this study was ﬁrst to reﬁne the psychological capital
intervention  (PCI)  model  under  highly  controlled  experimental  conditions
and  then  to  analyze  whether  PsyCap  development  led  to  performance

improvement.  Both  the  pilot  and  main  study  supported  the  PCI  as  being
able to develop PsyCap and the main study provided at least beginning evi-
dence  in  answering  the  main  research  question.  That  is,  the  higher-order
core  factor  of  psychological  capital  does  seem  to  be  developable  in  a  rela-
tively  short  training  intervention  and  seems  to  have  a  positive  impact  on 
the participants’ on-the-job performance. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst phase of the
pilot  study,  the  randomly  assigned  management-student  participants  who
received the training intervention signiﬁcantly increased their reported level
of  psychological  capital.  On  the  other  hand,  those  who  were  randomly
assigned  to  the  comparison  group  and  underwent  a  different  but  relevant
group-decision  intervention  did  not  exhibit  any  change  in  their  reported
psychological capital. The follow-up study using a cross-section of managers
in  a wide  variety  of  organizations  underwent  the  same  training  intervention 
and signiﬁcantly increased both their level of reported psychological capital and
their performance. Importantly, this ﬁeld sample used multisource measures
of performance.

Again,  although  further  research  is  needed,  we  feel  this  research  pro-
vides preliminary evidence of the value of the higher-order, core construct of
psychological  capital.  Drawing  from  previous  empirical  research  (Luthans,
Avolio  et  al.,  2007),  conﬁrmatory  model  comparison  in  the  results  of  this
research  indicated  the  data  best  ﬁt  a  higher-order  factor  model  with  each
positive  construct  loading  on  to  the  higher-order  factor  as  suggested  by
Luthans, Avolio et al. (2007). In addition, the results of this current research
indicate further empirical veriﬁcation/replication of the relationship between
PsyCap and performance and of the statelike nature of psychological capital.
Speciﬁcally, with regard to the statelike criterion, the results of this research
suggests PsyCap does seem open to development and for the ﬁrst time pro-
vides  empirical  evidence  that  such  PsyCap  development  has  a  signiﬁcant
positive impact on PCI-trained participants’ rated work performance.

Although the experimental design, use of control or matched comparison
groups, two samples, evidence for reliable and valid measurement, and multi-
ple sources of performance at two points in time contribute to the strength of
the study, there are also some potential limitations that need to be recognized.
First,  although  we  were  able  to  randomly  assign  individuals  to  treatment  or
control conditions in the pilot study, we were not able to use random assign-
ment to experimental versus control groups in the follow-up using practicing
managers. Thus, the latter participants’ motivation to develop could certainly
contribute to the results obtained; e.g., those who are developmentally ready
self-selected to participate in the training.

Second, although this research replicated the use of the PCI guidelines
in  developing  PsyCap  for  on-line  participants  (Luthans,  Avey,  &  Patera,
2008), face-to-face training as used in this research needs further reﬁnement.
The same is true of previous supporting psychometric evidence for the PCQ
measures comprising of subscales of hope, optimism, resilience, and efﬁcacy

(see  Luthans,  Avolio  et  al.,  2007).  Clearly,  more  research  is  still  needed  to
contribute to the nomological network representing the construct validity of
PsyCap. It is also important to note the strategy that Luthans, Youssef, and
Avolio  (2007)  used  in  constructing  the  PCQ,  which  was  to  take  existing
published measures in the positive psychology literature and adapt the items
to the workplace context. The drawback to using this approach is that some
items that might have been developed to capture these constructs more fully
may  not  have  been  included  in  the  currently  tested  version  of  this  PCQ
instrument.

Third,  although  the  two  samples  used  in  the  study  were  diverse,  they
still  represent  a  relatively  small  range  of  the  potential  working  adults  who
would need to be included to test for external validity of the ﬁndings. This
includes  samples  that  would  come  from  other  for-proﬁt  and  not-for-proﬁt
organizations, as well as non-U.S.–based samples.

Still  another  potential  limitation  is  that  we  were  able  to  only  collect
rated performance measures relatively soon after the intervention was com-
pleted. Future research should not only collect measures over a longer time
span, but perhaps also focus on performance outcomes that would likely be
most affected by increasing one’s positive outlook (e.g., sustaining high levels
of  performance  under  duress).  There  would  also  seem  to  be  future  beneﬁt
from  comparing  the  interventions  here  to  other  interventions,  such  as  the
work done by Eden and associates (Eden & Sulimani, 2002; Eden & Zuk,
1995) on developing Pygmalion effects.

It  could  also  be  useful  to  investigate  whether  our  interventions  create
unique  impact  to  other  more  general  positive  approaches  to  development.
Speciﬁcally, are we simply enhancing general positivity, but not speciﬁcally
the core components of hope, optimism, resilience, and efﬁcacy? Along these
lines, future research may want to collect data by having others evaluate the
positive psychological dimensions in addition to the self-reported measure of
PsyCap used in this research.

Lastly, we do not know whether one or more of the psychological capi-
tal components differentially created the effects found in this research. It is
possible  that  focusing  mainly  on  one  component  or  two  would  have  pro-
duced  the  same  effects  observed  here  with  the  overall  PsyCap.  Future
research  will  need  to  determine  how  each  component  and  combination  of
components impact performance in the short term and over time.

In addition to the longitudinal measurement of dependent variables, the
sustainability of the PCI may also be best measured by longitudinal tests of
the independent variable, in this case psychological capital. This type of test
could follow the previous research conducted by Conley (1984) on the stabil-
ity  of  psychological  constructs  and  help  to  understand  better  the  extent  to
which increases are sustained over multiple time periods. In addition, it has
been suggested that interventions may be more effective on certain segments
of the population (e.g., those initially low or initially high in the independent

variable; see Jordan, Ashkanasy, Härtel, & Hooper, 2002). To test this possi-
bility,  we  did  conduct  a  post  hoc  analysis  based  on  a  median  split.  Results
indicated that the intervention increased the self-reported level of psychologi-
cal capital more for those initially lower versus higher. However, it should be
noted that the dependent variable change was not different between groups,
nor could the threat of regression to the mean be ruled out. In any event, the
tentative  conclusion  that  the  training  intervention  may  be  able  to  increase
participants’ positive psychological capital for a positive impact on their per-
formance still stands.

Finally, there are obviously many ways to impact one’s positive psycho-
logical  dimensions  individually  and  collectively.  The  PCI  model  guidelines
used in this research only represent one such approach, which may or may
not be optimal for PsyCap development. Speciﬁcally, we recognize the possi-
bility  of  limited  sustainability  of  these  effects  given  the  dynamic  nature  of
organizations today and that we used only a short-duration intervention and
evaluation on performance impact. For example, in a comprehensive analy-
sis  of  leadership  intervention  research,  Reichard  and  Avolio  (2005)  found
that  most  leadership  training  interventions  in  organizations  are  short  in
duration, likely because of the need for less interruption. The duration of the
intervention used in this study ﬁts in with the majority (about two-thirds) of
leadership interventions they studied, which were less than 6 hours in dura-
tion. In following this same strategy we provided initial evidence of the value
for  what  may  be  termed  a  “micro”  intervention  in  enhancing  participants’
psychological capital and resulting performance impact. Nevertheless, there
is  certainly  a  need  for  future  studies  to  determine  the  sustainability  of
observed effects through longitudinal research designs and analyses.

Implications and Conclusion
This  study  has  many  direct  implications  for  human  resource  development
and performance management. The results provide initial empirical support
for  recent  proposals  that  a  core  higher-order  factor  termed  psychological
capital or PsyCap and its components made up of hope, optimism, efﬁcacy,
and resilience may be open to organizational leadership and human resource
development in the workplace. This research also begins the process of vali-
dation of a speciﬁc training model called the psychological capital interven-
tion, or PCI, designed to enhance organizational participants’ overall level of
PsyCap with resulting performance improvement.

Although there are a growing number of correlation studies indicating
that PsyCap is related to attitudes, behaviors, and performance in the work-
place,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  study  to  demonstrate  that  an  organizational  partici-
pant’s PsyCap can be developed, which results in performance improvement.
Thus, as a practical human resource development and performance manage-
ment  technique,  managers  can  follow  the  guidelines  provided  by  the  PCI

model  used  in  this  study  (see  Figure  1  and  Appendix)  and  potentially
enhance  their  own  and  their  associates’  performance.  By  investing  in  and
developing their own and their people’s positive psychological capital, orga-
nizational leaders and human resource development initiatives may be able
to leverage and obtain a high return on development (i.e., ROD) with result-
ing  competitive  advantage  (see  Luthans,  Avey  et  al.,  2006,  and  Luthans,
Youssef, & Avolio, 2007, Chapter 8, for such utility analysis for PsyCap).

For the future, research needs to test if other positive constructs such as
courage or wisdom (see Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007, Chapters 6 and 7,
and  C.  Peterson  &  Seligman,  2004)  can  be  developed  for  positive  perfor-
mance impact, and/or if other outcomes such as retention, safety, customer
satisfaction, and work-related attitudes can be positively impacted. In addi-
tion, given that relationships between variables do not occur absent the con-
text  in  which  interventions  are  being  implemented,  we  propose  contextual
predictors, moderators, and outcomes may be a beneﬁcial, additive next step
in pursuing this line of research (e.g., see Luthans, Norman et al., 2008). Of
particular  potential  may  be  the  emerging  theory  and  research  on  authentic
leadership  (Avolio,  Gardner,  Walumbwa,  Luthans,  &  May,  2004;  Gardner,
Avolio, Luthans, May, & Walumbwa, 2005) and how leaders can foster envi-
ronments conducive to developing positive psychological capital.

In  conclusion,  a  resource-based  view  (Barney,  1991)  suggests  that
human  capital  may  be  critical  to  organizations  trying  to  create  sustained
competitive  advantage.  The  torrents  of  today’s  volatile  global  economy  call
for different or at least generally underrecognized and largely untapped posi-
tive psychological constructs. We have demonstrated in this research that the
development of recently emerging psychological capital may provide human
resource development with a new and potentially very impactful approach.
Speciﬁcally, human resource development may be able to facilitate organiza-
tional  leaders  and  their  associates  to  become  more  resilient  to  increasing
adversity, more efﬁcacious in getting the job done, more optimistic about the
future, and more hopeful in determining plans and alternative pathways to
accomplish goals. In other words, HRD can implement programs such as the
one tested in this research to have their organizations beneﬁt from the syner-
gies of positive psychological capital for performance improvement in today’s
extremely challenging and turbulent environment.

Intervention Summary
Hope Development
The  hope  construct  was  impacted  by  inﬂuencing  goals,  pathways,  and
agency. Speciﬁcally, participants practiced generating work-related goals that
were  personally  valuable,  reasonably  challenging,  and  included  a  clear
beginning  and  ending  point.  These  goal  characteristics  generate  sustained
motivation, thus using goal components to increase agency. In addition, par-
ticipants practiced generating multiple pathways to their work-related goals
and  identiﬁed  obstacles  for  which  to  plan.  After  completing  the  exercise
individually,  each  participant  received  feedback  from  the  group  regarding
additional  pathways  that  could  be  utilized  and  additional  obstacles  to
expect.  This  practice  increased  pathway  generating  and  ability  to  plan  for
obstacles, thus reducing the negative impact of obstacles on agency.

Optimism Development
Building  efﬁcacy  for  pathway  generation  and  obstacle  planning  provided  a
foundation for generally positive expectations. When participants were con-
ﬁdent that they could identify and plan to overcome obstacles, the expecta-
tion of achieving the goals increased. Negative expectations that goals would
not be accomplished were challenged as individuals began to see pathways
to  success  and  options  to  overcome  obstacles.  Group  feedback  increased
positive expectations as individuals saw group members were also expecting
and  making  plans  for  success.  Thus,  participants’  expectations  for  success
increased which increased optimism.

Efﬁcacy Development
Participants practiced setting up stepwise techniques to accomplishing goals.
Next, they explained each subgoal to the group answering questions about
how  it  would  be  accomplished.  Task  mastery  for  designing  and  pursuing
goals was attained through this process. Next, vicarious learning took place 
as each participant saw peers work toward their goals or hear success stories
about how goals were obtained. This stage, including emotional arousal, was
inﬂuenced  by  positive  expectations  of  achieving  goals  as  well  as  by  social
persuasion by the facilitator and group members that goals would be accom-
plished by validating schedules and timelines for their goals.

Resilience Development
Resilience  was  increased  by  building  awareness  of  personal  assets  in  the 
form  of  talents,  skills,  and  social  networks.  Participants  were  asked  what

resources they could leverage to accomplish a given goal. After creating the list
of  resources,  the  facilitator  and  peer-group  members  identiﬁed  additional
resources participants did not list as resources. Participants were then encour-
aged to leverage these resources as necessary. Similar to the planning for obsta-
cles,  participants  were  encouraged  to  identify  in  advance  obstacles  that
could impede their progress. Although in the hope exercise the focus was on
making  plans  to  overcome  these  obstacles,  in  this  resilience  exercise  the
focus was on making plans to avoid the obstacles/prevent them from becom-
ing legitimate concerns. Finally, the inﬂuence process was impacted by help-
ing participants to become aware of initial thoughts and feelings when facing
adversity  (i.e.,  conﬁdent  or  in  despair)  and  to  choose  resilient  thoughts
based on resources and options available to overcome adversity.
