Corporate reputation attracts signiﬁcant attention among marketing scholars. However, researchers often
overlook customers' opinions speciﬁcally. Walsh and Beatty [Walsh, G., Beatty, S.E., Measuring Customer-
based Corporate Reputation: Scale Development, Validation, and Application. J Acad Mark Sci 2007; 35(1):
127–143.] identify dimensions of customer-based corporate reputation (CBR); they develop scales to
measure these dimensions. Researchers in the present study use the Walsh and Beatty CBR scale in the UK
and Germany across contexts to study the cross-cultural validity of the measure of customer-based corporate
reputation. This study assesses an abbreviated version of the CBR scale (with 15 items). The CBR Short scale
has equally good dimensional properties as the original scale. The paper ends with implications for cross-
cultural marketing research and management.

1. Introduction

The construct of corporate reputation attracts attention within
marketing management and research in many countries (Gardberg,
2006; Nguyen, 2006). However, in terms of measuring corporate
reputation few studies focus on one important stakeholder group,
customers. Walsh and Beatty (2007) develop and test a customer-
based corporate reputation scale—the CBR scale. However, research-
ers have not assessed the 28-item scale outside the United States, and
little information exists on the psychometric properties of this scale.
Corporate reputation is of great interest to scholars and practitioners
and thus, assessing the generalizability of the CBR scale is appro-
priate. Further, reducing the length of the scale would be of great
value to the ﬁeld.

Walsh and Beatty (2007) note that the generalizability of the CBR
scale needs further testing by administering the scale to different
populations in other countries, in accordance with Hunter's (2001)
call for more replication studies in the ﬁeld. Thus, this research
extends work on the CBR scale to two additional countries—the UK
and Germany.

This study has several objectives. First, the researchers assess the
psychometric properties of the full CBR scale (i.e., dimensionality and
reliability) as to the scale's consistency in a second and third country.

Second, the researchers extend previous research by developing a
short form of the CBR scale (CBR-Short). A valid CBR measure that is
short enough to be used in surveys would be helpful to researchers
and practitioners and would allow marketing and management
researchers to use public opinion polls as a data source for the
empirical investigation of CBR. Third, the researchers assess the
CBR-Short scale's effectiveness across three service contexts and for
Internet service ﬁrms to ascertain its generalizability. Moreover,
consistent with the literature (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998)
the researchers conduct a cross-cultural measurement invariance
test to assess the CBR-Short scale across data from three countries.
Finally, this study assesses the predictive and nomological validity of
the CBR-Short scale in the new samples.

2. Background

2.1. The CBR scale

The CBR scale (Walsh and Beatty, 2007) treats corporate reputa-
tion as a multi-dimensional attitude. Walsh and Beatty (2007, p. 129)
deﬁne customer-based reputation (CBR) as “the customer's overall
evaluation of a ﬁrm based on his or her reactions to the ﬁrm's goods,
services, communication activities, interactions with the ﬁrm and/or
its representatives or constituencies (such as employees, manage-
ment, or other customers) and/or known corporate activities.”

The psychometric literature is relatively consistent in describing
what makes a good measure (Bearden et al., 1999; Churchill, 1979).
The criteria typically used to assess scales include content validity
(which the original Walsh and Beatty (2007) addresses), dimension-
ality (the extent to which the empirical factor structure of a measure

reﬂects the theoretical dimensionality of the construct),
internal
consistency reliability, and construct validity. A brief summary of the
CBR scale and its validation as Walsh and Beatty (2007) address
appears below. Further information appears in the ﬁrst column of
Table 1.

2.2. Previous validation of scale

coefﬁcients for the ﬁve sub-scales range from .88 to .90 and all indicators
have coefﬁcients of determination above .40. The results of a ﬁve-factor
structure assessment, using LISREL 8.7, indicate that the model represents
the data well (GFI=.92, NNFI=.92, CFI=.97, RMR=.04, RMSEA=.08,
and χ2/df = 2.9 (p b0.001)). All
indices exceed recommended
threshold levels and convergent validity is achieved with all reputation
dimensions producing average variances extracted exceeding .50.

2.2.1. Internal consistency and dimensionality

2.2.2. Construct validity

Walsh and Beatty (2007) propose ﬁve interrelated dimensions of
CBR: Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reliable and Financially
Strong Company, Product and Service Quality, and Social and Environ-
mental Responsibility. Their study reports Cronbach alphas of the ﬁve
CBR scale dimensions ranging from .71 to .93. The composite reliability

To assess predictive validity, Walsh and Beatty (2007) regress a
two-item overall reputation variable (“Has a good reputation in the
market” and “Is highly reputable”) on the ﬁve aggregated CBR sub-
scales (i.e., composite variables of the ﬁve dimensions of the CBR scales
were used as the independent variables in the regression). The results

2.2.3. Nomological validity

Further, they test nomological validity by examining how well the
CBR scale relates to four other variables: customer satisfaction, loyalty,
trust, and word of mouth. Overall, the measures correlate in a manner
predicted by theory, supporting nomological validity. Next, reasons
behind the need for a shortened scale appear.

2.3. Beneﬁts of a shorter CBR scale

The CBR scale contains 28 items that constitute ﬁve sub-scales,
tapping the ﬁve domains. While the CBR scale captures consumers'
perceptions of service ﬁrms, practitioners may see the scale as too
long for their surveys. Thus, a shorter scale would be useful. This
approach makes sense for several reasons (Richins, 2004). First, a
shorter CBR scale takes less space on a survey instrument, allowing
researchers to include additional measures of other constructs in the
questionnaire. Second, a shorter measure reduces demand effects or
hypothesis guessing because of the relatively large number of items
dealing with similar (CBR-related) issues. Third, in many research
efforts corporate reputation is not the main construct of interest, yet
the researcher may wish to include measurement of corporate
reputation in the survey in addition to the primary constructs. If the
long, 28-item form of the CBR measure is the only measure available,
the researcher may forego measurement of corporate reputation to
keep the survey at a reasonable length or may use items from the CBR
scale based on some heuristic decision rule.

2.3.1. Evaluating and shortening a scale

Richins (2004) notes researchers have devoted much attention to
the process of scale development, while few address how to shorten a
scale. This study uses three criteria in evaluating items and shortening
a scale (Stanton et al., 2002). These criteria include internal, external,
and judgmental aspects. Internal item qualities involve the assess-
ment of the scale relative to items within the scale or to its summated
score. External item qualities refer to the connections between the
scale and other constructs. Finally, judgmental item qualities refer to
the use of subjective judgment (e.g., expert validation).

to rely on corporate reputation to relay favorable impressions (Snow
and Skaggs, 2004).

The online questionnaire was accessible through a link sent to
marketing students from a major northern UK university by e-mail.
Students recruited ﬁve people to ﬁll out the survey. Four of these ﬁve
people had to be non-students and needed to represent a range of
ages, genders, and professions. Different classes recruited respon-
dents from the different service provider types. This technique of
data collection has been successfully used in past research in
marketing and is similar to the approach used by Walsh and Beatty
(2007) (cf. Arnold and Reynolds, 2003; Keaveney, 1995). The data
collection process lasted 3 weeks. Five hundred and ﬁfty-three
people answered the questionnaire, representing approximately a
45% response rate of those individuals responding. Most respon-
dents (53%) fell
into the 18–29 age group. Table 2 provides a
description of the sample characteristics, as well as mean years of
relationships with their chosen company.

3.1.2. Germany

For the German survey, the researchers developed a German
version by translating and back translating the 28 items of the original
CBR scale (Sekaran, 1983; Walsh and Beatty, 2007). No problems
emerged in regards to the translation. The German data collection
involved an online survey of customers in regards to Internet service
ﬁrms that they use regularly. Respondents selected an Internet ﬁrm
they had recently used from one of three categories: Brokers such as
eBay (26.4% of the respondents), information providers (e.g., Yahoo,
Google), (17% of the respondents), or online merchants such as
Amazon (56.6% of respondents). This taxonomy comes from a broader
taxonomy developed by Rappa (2006).

The online questionnaire was accessible through a link sent to
management students by a western German university by e-mail.
Students recruited ﬁve people to ﬁll out the survey. These people had
to be Internet users and needed to represent a range of ages, genders,
and professions. In addition, banner links in ten German online
forums directed trafﬁc to the online survey. Data collection lasted
3 weeks. After editing and checking, 401 usable responses remained in
the sample. Table 2 provides a description of the German sample
characteristics, as well as mean years of relationships with their

Description of the samples.

This research uses primary data collected in the UK and Germany,
as well as the US survey data from Walsh and Beatty (2007). UK
respondents evaluate traditional service ﬁrms in three contexts
(similar to the Walsh and Beatty study). Further, Walsh and Beatty
(2007) suggest that future studies could assess if the CBR scale is
applicable to Internet service ﬁrms. Given the Internet's growing
popularity, online service ﬁrms need to understand the consumers'
uncertainties involved in the use of the Internet and the potential role
of corporate reputation in reducing those uncertainties. Accordingly,
respondents evaluate German Internet ﬁrms using the CBR scale.

3.1. The samples

3.1.1. UK

Similar to Walsh and Beatty (2007), individuals completed an
online survey in regards to their current provider in one of three
categories: their banking services (40% of the respondents), retailing
(30%), or fast-food restaurants (30%). In the ﬁrst question, respon-
dents identify a bank, retailer or fast-food company with which they
had recently done business. These services all involve low to medium
amounts of interaction opportunities and include customer-service
provider employee contact (Bowen, 1990). Moreover, the three
contexts represent less customized service ﬁrms that are more likely

contains more males and younger participants, presumably due to the
Internet context.

4. Results

4.1. Original scale assessment

The researchers ﬁrst estimated the 28-item, ﬁve-dimension
conﬁrmatory factor model with the UK data and then with the
German data, using AMOS 6.0. An inspection of the model ﬁt for the
UK data reveals an acceptable global ﬁt with GFI=.91, AGFI=.88,
NFI = .92, CFI = .94 RMR = .035 RMSEA = .060, and χ 2/df = 2.98
(p b.001) (Baumgartner and Homburg, 1996). In addition to global
ﬁt, all
indicators have coefﬁcients of determination above .50
(standardized loadings ranged from .75 to .93). The average variances
extracted (AVE) of all dimensions are .50 or above (Bagozzi and Yi,
1988; Fornell and Larcker, 1981) and the Cronbach alphas range from
.75 to .91, exceeding the recommended threshold of .70 (Nunnally and
Berstein, 1994). Further, using Fornell and Larcker's (1981) recom-
mended test, the researchers assessed the discriminant validity
among the dimensions of the CBR scale. Discriminant validity between
the two factors exists when the average of the two individual AVEs for
each latent variable exceeds the squared phi correlation between the
pair of latent variables. All possible pairs of factors pass this test,
conﬁrming the discriminant validity of the CBR scale dimensions.

A CFA on the German ﬁve-dimensional model results in a good
overall ﬁt with GFI=.91, AGFI=.89, NFI=.92, CFI=.96, RMR=.036,
RMSEA = .048, and χ 2/df = 1.90 (p b.001). All
indicators have
coefﬁcients of determination above .50 (standardized loadings ranged
from .72 to .93). The AVEs of the dimensions are above .50 (Bagozzi
and Yi, 1988; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The Cronbach alphas range
from .79 to .93. Using the Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion the
dimensions of the CBR scale also possess discriminant validity in the
Internet context.

4.2. Item analysis and development of a short scale

In regards to the assessment of the viability of a short version of the
CBR scale (CBR-Short), procedures and criteria suggested and
employed by Richins (2004) were followed, such that: (1) the CBR-
Short scale should possess levels of reliability and validity similar to
those possessed by the longer scale, and (2) content validity should be
maintained by including measures of the ﬁve CBR domains identiﬁed
by Walsh and Beatty (2007).

In this study, the researchers choose a 15-item scale (the three top-
loading items in each dimension from the original Walsh and Beatty
data). This procedure insured that an adequate number of items per
dimension are available with which to assess scale reliability. Then,
using AMOS, researchers ran a CFA on this ﬁve-dimensional model
with the US data. The CFA results in a good overall ﬁt with GFI=.95,
AGFI = .92, NFI = .94, CFI = .96, RMR = .022, RMSEA = .057, and
χ 2 =232.81, df =80 (χ 2/df =2.91; p b.001). All 15 indicators have
coefﬁcients of determination above .50 (standardized loadings ranged
from .71 to .94). The AVEs of the dimensions are above .60. The
Cronbach alphas range from .64 to .86 (see Column 4 in Table 1).

Next, the researchers conduct a CFA using the UK data on this ﬁve-
dimensional model, resulting in a good overall ﬁt with GFI=.95,
AGFI = .92, NFI = .95, CFI = .97, RMR = .029, RMSEA = .058, and
χ 2 =224.48, df =78 (χ 2/df =2.88; p b.001). All 15 indicators have
coefﬁcients of determination above .50 (standardized loadings ranged
from .72 to .93). The AVEs of the dimensions are above .60. The
Cronbach alphas range from .71 to .87.

Next, the researchers conduct a CFA on the ﬁve-dimensional model
using the German data, resulting in a good overall ﬁt with GFI=.93,
AGFI = .90, NFI = .93, CFI = .96, RMR = .033, RMSEA = .051, and

χ 2=388.38, df =142 (χ 2/df =2.74; p b.001). All 15 indicators have
coefﬁcients of determination above .60 (standardized loadings range
from .83 to .94). The AVEs of the dimensions are above .70. The
Cronbach alphas range from .70 to .89.

Finally, assessments based on the Fornell and Larcker (1981)
criterion show that the CBR-Short scale possesses discriminant
validity in each of the three country samples. In sum, the analyses
show that the CBR-Short scale performs well in terms of reliability,
validity and empirical usefulness, with no imperfect psychometric
properties across data from the three countries. The CFA results
appear in the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth columns of Table 1.

4.2.1. Internal item qualities–validity assessment of the 15-item CBR-
Short scale

Next, the researchers assessed the reliability and validity of the
CBR-Short scale across three service contexts using conﬁrmatory
factor analyses with the UK data. This analysis provides an
opportunity to assess generality across contexts. See Table 3.

First, the researchers conduct a CFA with the bank sample using a
ﬁve-dimensional model containing only the top-three loading items
from each of the dimensions. This analysis results in a good overall ﬁt
with GFI = .92, AGFI = .88, NFI = .92, CFI = .96, RMR = .029,
RMSEA=.062, and χ 2=143.73, df =78 (χ 2/df =1.84; p b.001).

Next, a CFA was conducted with the retail sample, testing the ﬁve-
dimensional structure, which results in a reasonably good overall ﬁt
with GFI = .91, AGFI = .87, NFI = .91, CFI = .97, RMR = .030,
RMSEA=.057, and χ 2=120.14, df =79 (χ 2/df =1.52; p b.001).

Finally, a CFA for the fast-food sample was run using the ﬁve-
dimensions, which results in a relatively poor overall ﬁt with GFI=.87,
AGFI = .81, NFI = .86, CFI = .92, RMR = .057, RMSEA = .089, and
χ 2 = 177.14, df = 78 (χ 2/df = 2.27; p b.001). The cause of this
relatively poor ﬁt lies with the performance of factor four—‘Product
and Service Quality’, which has a relatively low AVE and Cronbach
alpha as compared to the other two sub-samples. Thus, the short scale
performs reasonably well for two of the three contexts examined.

4.2.2. Assessing cross-cultural measurement invariance

In cross-cultural survey research, testing for measurement invar-
iance has become standard. Hence, the researchers assessed the data
sets from the three countries for similar patterns of factor loadings
(conﬁgural invariance) and for equality of factor loadings (metric
invariance).

Tests of measurement equivalence were undertaken based on
multi-group conﬁrmatory factor analyses, utilizing a procedure
suggested by Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998). The procedure
assesses increasing levels of construct equivalence through a series of
hierarchical models. A minimum requirement for the CBR-Short scale
to be applicable across the three countries is conﬁgural invariance. The
conﬁgural invariance model is an unconstrained model whereby for
each sample, the items within each subscale must yield signiﬁcant
non-zero loadings on salient factors and zero loadings on non-salient
factors. For the CBR-Short scale to be useful in exploring nomological
relationships with other pertinent constructs, metric invariance is also
required. The metric invariance model
imposes an additional
constraint on the conﬁgural invariance model by constraining the
factor loadings to be equal across the groups. However, before
estimating these models, researchers must assess the equivalence of
the covariance matrices and mean vectors across the three samples.
These tests do not assume any factor structure within the data. If this
test indicates that the covariances and means are equal across the
three groups then no further analyses are necessary and group
differences would not be present in the data.

Table 4
4.2.2.1. Equality of covariance matrices and mean vectors.
gives the ﬁt indices for each step of the measurement invariance
analysis. The choice of ﬁt indices and goodness of ﬁt criteria utilized
follows the recommended approach of Steenkamp and Baumgartner
(1998), with Hu and Bentler (1999) and Steiger (1990) supporting this
approach. In terms of the ﬁrst step of this assessment, all three models
(Equality of Σ and µ, Equality of Σ, and Equality of µ as detailed in Table
4) yield signiﬁcant χ 2 value with p b.001. This ﬁnding indicates that
group differences exist. The ﬁt statistics for the test of equality of means
are poorer than that of the other two models, with χ2/df=16.11,
TLI=.53 and RMSEA=.102, thus, indicating that differences in item
means across groups are the main contributors to the lack of invariance
in the covariance and mean vectors.

From the goodness of ﬁt indices in
4.2.2.2. Conﬁgural invariance.
Table 4, the ﬁt of the conﬁgural invariance model are acceptable, with
both the TLI and CFI above .90. The RMSEAvalue is good at .045. All factor

loadings are signiﬁcant at p b.01 for all groups, further supporting the
appropriateness of the conﬁgural
invariance model as a baseline
comparison. These results show that the basic meaning and factor
structures are equivalent across the three samples and that consumers
conceptualize the CBR-Short scale similarly in all three countries.

Table 4 gives the associated ﬁt measures
4.2.2.3. Metric invariance.
for the metric invariance model. The ﬁt measures meet acceptable
standards with a RMSEA of .045 and CFIs and TLIs above .90. A χ 2
difference test between the metric invariance model and the
conﬁgural (baseline) model indicates that full metric invariance of
the data is not supported (Δχ 2(20)=82.85, p b.001). Next, the
researchers assess partial metric invariance. After relaxing the
constraints on nine factor loadings, a ﬁnal three-group partial metric
invariance model results. This ﬁnal model has an acceptable ﬁt
(RMSEA= .044, CFI of .93 and TLI of .91) and is not different from the
baseline (conﬁgural) model (Δχ 2(12)=20.01, p =.07).

The lack of full metric invariance implies that equal scale intervals
for the questionnaire items across the three groups can not be
assumed. However, Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998) report that
full measurement invariance beyond conﬁgural invariance is seldom
achieved, while Horn (1991, p. 125) asserts that full metric invariance
is an ideal and “a condition to be striven for, not one expected to be
fully realized.”

4.2.3. External item qualities—predictive and nomological validity

Next, the researchers assess the predictive and nomological
validity of the scale using the UK and German data. To assess
predictive validity, the dependent variable measuring overall reputa-
tion was regressed on the aggregated CBR-Short scale. Two items
capture overall reputation: “Has a good reputation in the market” and
“Is highly reputable” and the dependent variable was created by
adding together these two items. The results of the regression analyses
show relatively high values for the coefﬁcient of determination
(R2
Ger=.53) and beta values of .68 and .73, respectively

UK=.46; R2

(at p b0.01). This strong, positive relationship provides support for the
predictive validity of the CBR-Short scale with the UK and German
data sets.

To assess the CBR-Short scale's nomological validity, the research-
ers examine how well the scale relates to three important outcome
variables—customer loyalty, trust, and repatronage intentions. In both
studies, these three measures are operationalized with three (Loyalty,
Repatronage Intentions) and ﬁve (Trust) items, respectively. The
reliabilities of the scales are all acceptable. See Table 5. Items for the
outcome measures appear in Table 5.

All 15 correlations between each of the ﬁve reputation dimensions
and the three customer outcome constructs are positive (p b.05). For
the UK data, these 15 correlations range from .35 (between
Environmental Responsibility and Repatronage Intentions and Social)
to .74 (between Good Employer and Trust). For the German data, using
the Internet context, the correlations between the ﬁve CBR dimen-
sions and the three customer outcomes range from .12 (between
Reliable & Financially Strong Company and Repatronage Intentions) to
.66 (between Customer Orientation and Trust). On average, the
correlations for the German data are slightly lower than in the UK
data, especially in regards to Repatronage Intentions. However,
overall, the measures correlate as the theory predicts, supporting
the measures' nomological validity. See Table 6.

5. Discussion

This article reports a reassessment of the CBR scale in countries
beyond the US, with a focus on a shortened version, the 15-item CBR-
Short scale. The results show that consumers in the US, UK, and
Germany conceive the CBR dimensions similarly. Based on the
analysis of UK and German survey data, the 28-item CBR scale
performs reasonably well.
In terms of reliability, all ﬁve CBR
dimensions are acceptable—with either the 28- or the 15-item
scale. Researchers point to problems of extending scales into
different cultures (cf. Witkowski and Wolﬁnbarger, 2002; Zhang,
Beatty, and Walsh, 2008) and thus, this issue is worthy of study.

Further, in two of the three service contexts in the UK data the CBR
Short scale works well. This study tentatively shows that the overall
performance of the CBR-Short scale in the fast-food context is
somewhat affected by the ‘Product and Service Quality’ dimension.
Perhaps, the opinions of UK citizens in regards to fast-food are more
ambivalent, particularly given the strong presence of American fast-
food in the UK servicescape.

The original researchers developed the CBR scale for an ofﬂine
shopping or service environment. Therefore, a study on the applic-
ability of the scale to an online context is timely. Accordingly, this
research ﬁnds that the CBR-Short scale worked reasonably well in a
German Internet service context. However, noting the lower correla-
tions between the corporate reputation dimensions and repatronage
intentions, these results suggest a conceptual difference may exist in
this area between the Internet context and an ofﬂine context.

This study extends the CBR scale to the UK and German market.
Further, this research proposed and tested a shortened version of the
original scale. The shortened version maintains the dimensional
properties of the full 28-item scale, while possessing sound psycho-
metric properties across diverse contexts. Thus, this research extends
Walsh and Beatty's (2007) scale into other cultures and contexts.
Finally, the CBR-Short scale possesses full conﬁgural invariance and
partial metric invariance across the countries surveyed.

For service managers, the CBR-Short scale is well-suited to gather
benchmark data regarding levels of customer-based corporate
reputation as well as to conduct periodic ‘checks’ to measure
reputation improvements. Further, these ﬁndings indicate that a
favorable (unfavorable) corporate reputation positively (negatively)
affects critical relational outcome variables—loyalty, trust, and
repatronage intentions, and, hence, should be of concern to
companies. Further, practitioners can determine overall CBR, as well
as the performance of each of the ﬁve dimensions of CBR. By
considering individual CBR dimensions, service ﬁrms can better
identify the strengths and weaknesses of the ﬁrm's reputation in
enabling management to pinpoint problems and develop solutions.

While the results of this study emphasize the importance of
customer-based corporate reputation, they also highlight the need for
additional research. First, additional items may bolster the ‘Product
and Service Quality’ dimension. The literature on service quality and
the SERVQUAL work would be a good starting point (Brady and
Cronin, 2001; Parasuraman et al., 1993; Zeithaml et al., 1993).

Researchers should conduct further studies in other countries,
where service ﬁrms and consumers' perceptions of them may differ.
Additionally, further studies across diverse service contexts may allow
researchers to more clearly understand when the CBR scales apply and
when they do not. Finally, researchers need to understand when
corporate reputation matters, relative to the ﬁve dimensions, and to
which segments do the dimensions of corporate reputation matter?
Further, how do these issues vary across contexts, important cultures,
and sub-cultures? Researchers are encouraged to continue to consider
these important issues.
