The authors investigate team identification and individual differentiation as complementary dri-
vers of team members’ citizenship and creative behavior. As hypothesized, the results of a survey
among 157 middle-management team members show team identification to be positively related
to citizenship behavior toward other team members, whereas individual differentiation is posi-
tively associated with creative behavior. Moreover, citizenship behavior is found to be a media-
tor that linked team identification to an individual’s effectiveness as a team member, whereas
creative behavior is the mediating link in the relationship between individual differentiation and
individual effectiveness. Theoretical implications and suggestions for practitioners are discussed.

The ability of a firm to attain greater cooperation across its functional units as well as to inno-
vate continuously has become vitally important for success in the increasingly competitive and
volatile business environment. There is a widespread enthusiasm in organizations to use teams with
adequate autonomy and latitude as the key to facilitate cooperation and innovation (e.g., Ilgen,
1999; West, Tjosvold, & Smith, 2003; Zakarian & Kusian, 1999). Cross-functional teams, product

development teams, project teams, management teams, and self-managing work teams are exam-
ples  of  empowered  teams  that  are  prevalent  in  contemporary  organizations  (Van  der  Vegt  &
Bunderson, 2005).

Individuals in such teams are expected to collaborate constructively by sharing information
and helping one another to meet the demands of a cooperative work environment (e.g., Cohen &
Bailey, 1997; West  et  al., 2003).  Concurrently, members  are  also  encouraged  to  take  creative
approaches to work matters that may help their team meet the requirements of innovation (e.g.,
Somech, 2006; West et al., 2003). Consequently, both cooperative and creative behavior can be
expected to be critical behavioral factors of the effectiveness of an individual as a team member.
As employees spend a larger proportion of their time working in team settings (Goncalo & Staw,
2006), a comprehensive understanding of the motivational processes underlying these distinct
work behaviors has become increasingly important. Until now, little research attention has been
devoted to the antecedents and processes that explain why, how, and to what extent individuals in
teams are effective in terms of both cooperative and creative behaviors. This study aims to address
this gap by investigating how distinct identification processes in individuals in teams are associ-
ated with these different work behaviors and their individual effectiveness as team members.

Like every member of every group, individuals in organizational teams have to balance two
fundamental human motivations: the need to identify with the team and the need to feel like a
differentiated individual by emphasizing one’s individuality (Hornsey & Jetten, 2004). Using
the social identity approach to organizational behavior (e.g., Brickson, 2000; Hogg & Terry,
2000; Randel & Jaussi, 2003; Van Knippenberg, 2000), we propose that team identification
motivates individual members to engage in citizenship behaviors directed at helping and coop-
erating with other team members. Additionally, we provide logic that individual differentiation
rather than team identification is an important driver for individual team members to produce
creative ideas that can serve as vital input to team innovation processes. Thus, we propose that
team identification and individual differentiation are mutually independent and complementary
drivers of citizenship and creative behaviors of individuals in team settings.

In sum, the objective of this study is to contribute to the literature in several ways. We aimed to
advance social identity theory and research by exploring how not only team identification but also
individual differentiation can contribute to an individual’s effectiveness as a team member. This
notion extends previous work in which a strong individual differentiation was proposed to result
in self-serving behaviors that are detrimental to effective individual performance in teams (e.g.,
Brickson, 2000; Randel & Jaussi, 2003). Moreover, we confirm and extend a recently developed
notion in social identity theory that the expression of individuality is reconcilable with team iden-
tification (e.g., Jetten, Postmes, & McAuliffe, 2002; Postmes, Spears, Lee, & Novak, 2005; Rink
& Ellemers, 2007), by demonstrating that these distinct identity processes are mutually indepen-
dent and have differential relationships with different types of effective individual work behaviors.

Conceptual Background and Hypotheses

Team Identification and Individual Differentiation as Mutually
Independent Identity Aspects

Team identification can be defined as the process by which individual team members per-
ceive themselves in terms of the values, goals, attitudes, and behaviors they share with other

team  members, whereas  individual  differentiation  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  individual
team members see themselves as different from the other team members in their thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987; Van Knippenberg,
2000). Based on self-categorization theory (Turner et al., 1987), the social identity approach
initially assumed that social and personal identities related to each other in an antagonistic
way. According to this principle of functional antagonism, team identification and individual
differentiation would be mutually exclusive, in the sense that strong team identification weak-
ens individual differentiation, and that individuals who see themselves as more different from
other team members are less attached to the team (Hornsey & Jetten, 2004). It was argued that
people tend to make intergroup comparisons to reach a compromise between their need to
belong and their need to differentiate (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). That is, individuals emphasize
similarities between the self and other in-group members to satisfy their need to experience
group belonging, while simultaneously enhance distinctiveness from out-group members to
satisfy their need to be different (Brewer, 1991; Tajfel & Turner, 1979).

More recently, however, social identity scholars proposed that the expression of individ-
uality and the formation of a social identity can be reconcilable in interactive groups with-
out  the  need  to  make  intergroup  comparisons  (e.g., Rink  &  Ellemers, 2007).  Research
findings suggest that when group members develop norms that appreciate the value of indi-
viduality and diversity, expressions of individual differentiation may reinforce rather than
conflict  with  the  collective  identity, and  need  not  necessarily  hamper  group  attachment
(Bettencourt & Sheldon, 2001; Jetten et al., 2002; Swann, Kwan, Polzer, & Milton, 2003).
Such group norms of appreciation of individuality tend to emerge especially when the suc-
cess of a group is dependent on the unique and specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities
that the individual members bring to the group (Postmes, Haslam, & Swaab, 2005; Postmes,
Spears, et al., 2005). As this condition reflects the premise underlying the use of teams in
organizations (Van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005), members of such teams can be expected
to develop a common identity that appreciates their interindividual differences to a certain
extent. Thus, rather than being antagonistic in nature, team identification and individual dif-
ferentiation are likely to be mutually independent identity processes, and thus distinguish-
able in terms of their pattern of relationships with behavioral variables.

Team Identification and Citizenship Behavior Toward Other Team Members

Individuals identify themselves more strongly with a team when they perceive (a) stronger
awareness of their membership in the team (cognitive component of self-categorization),
(b) more positive value attached to this team membership (evaluative component of perceived
group self-esteem), and (c) a sense of emotional involvement with the team (emotional com-
ponent of affective commitment; Ellemers, Kortekaas, & Ouwerkerk, 1999). These cognitive,
emotional, and evaluative processes underlying team identification elicit a sense of oneness
with the team that induces individuals to perceive the team’s goals, interests, and norms as
their own (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994; Van Knippenberg, 2000). This sense of one-
ness with the team motivates individual team members to behave in team-typical ways to pro-
mote their social identity as team members (Haslam, Powell, & Turner, 2000).

Journal of Management / February 2008

Because  citizenship  behaviors  are  discretionary  in  nature  and  critical  for  team  functioning
(Podsakoff  &  MacKenzie, 1997), Van  Knippenberg  (2000)  suggested  that  team  identification
should play an important role in motivating this particular type of team-typical behavior. Organ
(1997)  defined  citizenship  behaviors  as  actions  that  contribute  “to  the  maintenance  and
enhancement  of  the  social  and  psychological  context  that  supports  task  performance” (p.  91).
Organizational scholars differentiated between different targets of citizenship behaviors, and dis-
tinguished behaviors intended to benefit the organization from behaviors aimed at benefiting indi-
vidual  team  members  (e.g., McNeely  &  Meglino, 1994;    L.  J.  Williams  & Anderson, 1991).
Because team identification refers to the individual’s sense of oneness with other team members,
team identification should be more important for citizenship behaviors directed at helping and
cooperating with other team members than for citizenship behaviors directed at the organization.
A  cross-sectional  study  among  schoolteachers  by  Christ, Van  Dick, Wagner, and  Stellmacher
(2003) indeed found team identification to be strongly related to citizenship behaviors directed at
helping colleagues who were overtaxed. Hence, we formulate the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Team identification is positively associated with citizenship behavior toward other

team members.

Individual Differentiation and Creative Behavior

As identification with a team closely ties established team attributes to an individual’s
sense of self, team identification promotes individual team members to behave in accordance
with this social self-concept. It is difficult, therefore, to conceive that strong team identifi-
cation can be the vital origin from which newfangled and groundbreaking ideas arise, even
though a team’s identity may appreciate creativity or may give specific directions to encour-
age creative behavior (Amabile, 1996). Given that creative ideas are more likely to be gen-
erated when individuals deviate from established paradigms and take different perspectives
on emerging issues (Amabile, 1996; Eisemann, 1990; Goncalo & Staw, 2006), individual
differentiation rather than team identification may be a critical driver for team members to
generate new ideas for innovative change.

Individuals in teams who highlight their individuality are apt to feel idiosyncratic and dif-
ferent  from  other  team  members  in  their  thoughts, feelings, and  behaviors  (Dutton  et  al.,
1994;  Haslam  et  al., 2000;  Van  Knippenberg, 2000).  Prompted  by  their  divergence  and
unique perspectives, such individuals are likely to question the assumptions behind and the
validity of the established framework of thoughts and routines in the team, and may wonder
why those are taken for granted. This divergent and challenging attitude feeds the aptitude
to seek, construct, and define problems, to generate and combine new ideas for solutions,
and to communicate creative suggestions to the team. Such problem-seeking and problem-
solving activities are noted in the literature as basic elements of the creative process (e.g.,
Amabile, 1996; Reiter-Palmon, Mumford, Boes, & Runco, 1997; Shalley, Zhou, & Oldham,
2004; Vincent, Decker, & Mumford, 2002). Hence, we predict the following:

Hypothesis 2: Individual differentiation is positively associated with creative behavior.

Identity, Work Behavior, and Individual Effectiveness as a Team Member

An individual’s citizenship behavior toward other team members and creative behavior
can be conceived of as different facets of individual performance that contribute to the team.
As such, citizenship and creative behaviors may serve as distinctive behavioral mediators
that associate the identity processes of team identification and individual differentiation with
an individual’s effectiveness as a team member.

There are several reasons to suggest that citizenship behaviors toward other team members
contribute to the extent to which individual members are effective in team settings. Following
Podsakoff and MacKenzie (1997), individuals who voluntarily help other team members to
learn the ropes and to cope with work-related problems enable them to become productive
team members. Besides this beneficial impact on other members’ productivity, such citizen-
ship  behaviors  may  also  enhance  the  collective  team  performance  as  best  practices  may
spread throughout the whole team. Moreover, helping behaviors tend to bolster effective team
functioning by enhancing the team spirit, morale, and cohesiveness. These reasons provide
logic to suggest that it is through stimulating these citizenship behaviors that team identifica-
tion leads individuals to be effective in teams. We formulate the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3: Citizenship behavior toward other team members mediates the positive relationship

between team identification and an individual’s effectiveness as a team member.

Individuals in teams can apply creativity to enhance both their own individual role in the
team and the functioning of the team as a whole. Regarding their individual functioning, the
findings of some empirical research studies suggest that individuals use creativity as a problem-
focused strategy for coping with job-related problems (e.g., Bunce & West, 1994; Janssen,
2000; West, 1989). That is, creativity may help individuals to deal better with intensified job
problems by adapting their practices or modifying elements of the work context. Ideas for
adapting oneself may involve renewing and restructuring cognitions, abilities, and behav-
ioral repertoires, whereas ideas for modifying elements of the workplace may include chang-
ing job approaches, work methods, and procedures. Moreover, taking creative approaches to
problems encountered in the team’s inputs, processes, or outputs enables individuals to gen-
erate new ideas for solutions that can be discussed and worked out by the team. Creative
individuals may facilitate their team to produce incremental improvements in how work is
arranged and performed, as well as radical breakthroughs when it is necessary to do things
in a completely different way (Gilson, Mathieu, Shalley, & Ruddy, 2005). Besides, by gen-
erating  and  presenting  novel  and  useful  ideas, individuals  might  function  as  creative  role
models for other team members. Based on social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), Zhou
(2003) proposed and found that individuals who have observed coworkers to be creative are
more  likely  to  perform  creatively  themselves.  These  lines  of  reasoning  suggest  that  it  is
through the motivation of creative behaviors that individual differentiation leads individuals
to be effective in teams. Accordingly, we offer the following:

Hypothesis 4: Creative behavior mediates the positive relationship between individual differentia-

tion and an individual’s effectiveness as a team member.

Do Team Identification and Individual Differentiation Combine in their Effects?

Considering that team identification and individual differentiation are mutually independent
identity processes, they might interact in their effects on individual creativity and effectiveness.
That is, when a team’s identity appreciates the value of individuality and creativity, team identi-
fication might intensify the positive relationship between individual differentiation and creative
behavior. This argument is in accordance with the “norms for creativity” hypothesis stating that
strong  collectivistic  values  and  strong  norms  for  innovation  can  combine  to  foster  creativity
because members in collectivistic entities might be more responsive to norms and thus feel a
greater pressure to engage in creative acts (e.g., Flynn & Chatman, 2001; O’Reilly & Chatman,
1996).  However, in  an  experimental  study  among  collectivistic  and  individualistic  groups,
Goncalo and Staw (2006) found no empirical support for this hypothesis. In contrast, individual-
istic groups were found to be more creative than collectivistic groups when both were instructed
to be creative. Goncalo and Staw (2006) clarified this result, which deviates from the “norms for
creativity” hypothesis, with the argument that creativity, by its very nature, requires one to do
something in a new or different way, which may be expected to result from the violation rather
than the enforcement of the shared norms. This argument suggests that a strong team identifica-
tion may constrain individual team members to transform a strong sense of individuality into cre-
ative ideas that are really deviant from the beliefs and values shared in the team. In sum, there
seem to be both pro and contra arguments for possible joint effects of team identification and indi-
vidual differentiation. Hence, rather than developing conclusive interaction hypotheses, we con-
duct exploratory analyses to detect possible joint effects of both identity aspects.

Sample and Procedure

Method

The data used in this study were collected as part of a general survey on job-related atti-
tudes and performance conducted among members of middle management teams of a Dutch
company in the banking industry. These teams were expected to fulfill the integrative role in
the  company  by  transforming  major  strategic  initiatives  into  day-to-day  operations  and
attaining coordination across functional units. Members were also encouraged to generate
and  present  creative  ideas  that  may  help  their  teams  tailor  and  adjust  initiatives  to  the
company’s changing circumstances, remedy problems, and seize new opportunities. Thus,
middle management teams in this company played a pivotal role in achieving integration and
innovation and were therefore an important leverage point for organizational performance.
To fulfill this pivotal role appropriately, members of these middle management teams met
each other face-to-face on a very regular basis (weekly or fortnightly) to exchange informa-
tion and discuss all kinds of work-related issues.

The company’s intranet information system was used to inform the middle managers about
the research and to administer questionnaires. Of the total of 246 middle managers who were
asked to participate, 206 responded by providing self-reports of their team identification and
individual differentiation in reference to the middle management team with which they were
affiliated, resulting in a response rate of 84%. Supervisors of 34 middle management teams


Janssen, Huang / Team Members’ Behaviors

75

provided ratings of their team members’ citizenship and creative behaviors, and of their indi-
vidual effectiveness as a team member. As such, supervisor ratings were obtained for 157 of
the 206 middle managers in the sample. Of this final sample of 157 participants, 128 (82%)
were male; their ages ranged from 27 to 58 years (M = 40.86, SD = 7.74); and their organi-
zational tenure ranged from less than 1 year to 39 years (M = 11.89, SD = 9.92).

Measures

The items comprising the scales outlined below are detailed in the Appendix.

Team identification. Participants’ identification with their team was measured using the 10-
item measurement of social identification developed and validated by Ellemers et al. (1999).
This scale is used to assess the three team identification aspects of self-categorization, team
self-esteem, and  team  commitment.  The  participants  indicated  the  extent  to  which  they
agreed or disagreed with the 10 statements about identification with their teams, with 1 indi-
cating totally disagree and 7 totally agree. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .87.

Individual differentiation. Based on Ellemers et al.’s (1999) 3-item measurement of personal
identification, we developed a 7-item scale to assess the extent to which the participants saw
themselves as different from the other members of their team in terms of their knowledge, skills,
abilities, roles, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We extended Ellemers et al.’s 3-item scale to
capture several self-attributes that are relevant for individual differentiation processes in the con-
text of a middle management team. The response set for these items was a 7-point scale rang-
ing from 1, not at all, to 7, to a very large extent. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .90.

Citizenship behavior toward other team members. The participants’ citizenship behaviors
toward  other  members  of  the  team  were  measured  using  six  items  developed  by  L.  J.
Williams and Anderson (1991). The immediate supervisors of the participants indicated the
extent to which each of the citizenship behaviors described in the six items were character-
istic of the focal participant. The response format was a 5point scale ranging from 1, not at
all characteristic, to 5, very characteristic. The scale’s internal consistency was .91.

Creative  behavior.  The  extent  to  which  participants  performed  creatively  as  a  team
member was assessed using supervisor ratings of 8 items from George and Zhou’s (2001) 13-
item creativity scale. As the company requested us earnestly to keep the questionnaire short,
we selected 8 of the established 13 scale items that reflect the generation and communication
of creative ideas rather than taking risks and applying ideas. The response format was the
same as the one used for measuring citizenship behavior. Cronbach’s alpha was .94.

Individual effectiveness. Based on Denison, Hooijberg, and Quinn’s (1995) 5-item gen-
eral effectiveness scale, supervisors rated participants’ individual effectiveness. We selected
this instrument because it focuses on tapping the general effectiveness of the participants by
assessing their overall managerial performance, their success compared to their peers, their


76

Journal of Management / February 2008

performance as a role model for others, and the degree to which they have met performance
standards.  Denison  et  al.  (1995)  found  a  satisfactory  internal  consistency  for  this  5-item
index (α = .83) in a sample of midlevel executives drawn from 84 different organizations in
the public utilities industry. Moreover, managerial leaders with high scores on this manage-
rial effectiveness scale were found to exhibit more complex and differentiated behavior than
managerial leaders with low scores on this managerial effectiveness scale. Thus, this general
effectiveness scale appears to be appropriate for our purpose of relating it as an effectiveness
criterion to the different and complex work behaviors of citizenship and creative behavior.
The scale’s internal consistency was .91.

Covariates. On the demographic page of the questionnaire, the participants provided infor-
mation about their sex (1, male; 2, female), age (in years), organizational tenure (in years),
and organizational echelon (ranging from second to fifth echelon). We entered these sociode-
mographics as control variables in the statistical analyses reported below because they were
significantly or slightly correlated with any of the identity or performance variables.

Test for Sampling Bias

Results

We received supervisor scores for citizenship behavior, creative behavior, and individual
effectiveness  for  157  of  the  total  of  206  participants  who  responded.  We  conducted  a
MANOVA to test whether the participants with supervisor scores systematically differed from
the participants without supervisor scores in their demographics and ratings on team identifi-
cation and individual differentiation. The test yielded no significant result, F(5, 200) = 1.55,
ns, minimizing the concern for potential sampling bias due to nonresponding supervisors.

Confirmatory Factor Analyses

Prior to testing our hypotheses, we conducted two confirmatory factor analyses (CFA)
to  check  the  measures’ convergent  and  discriminant  validity.  We  first  submitted  the  10
items of the three dimensions of team identification (self-categorization, team self-esteem,
and team commitment) and the 7 items of individual differentiation to a CFA using the
maximum  likelihood  method.  The  expected  four-factor  model  showed  good  fit  indexes
(root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .08; comparative fit index [CFI] =
.93) and the factor loading for each item on its intended latent variable was significant at
the .001 level. This four-factor model yielded a significantly better fit to the data, χ2(1) =
614.90, p < .001, than a single-factor CFA model collapsing all items on a single latent
variable (RMSEA = .20; CFI = .48). In the four-factor model, individual differentiation
yielded  quite  low  interfactor  correlations  with  the  team  identification  dimensions  of  self-
categorization  (−.01), team  self-esteem  (.14), and  team  commitment  (.11).  These  results
indicated that individual differentiation was sufficiently discriminant from the three dimen-
sions  of  team  identification. The  interfactor  correlations  between  the  three  dimensions  of
team identification were quite high: .50 between self-categorization and team self-esteem,


Janssen, Huang / Team Members’ Behaviors

77

.61 between self-categorization and team commitment, and .69 between team self-esteem
and team commitment. These high interfactor correlations allowed us to create a compos-
ite scale, as we focused in this study on the construct of team identification rather than on
the distinctive aspects of team identification.

We also conducted a CFA for the items used to measure citizenship behavior, creative
behavior, and individual effectiveness as a team member. The expected three-factor model
showed good fit indexes (RMSEA = .08; CFI = .94) and yielded a significantly better fit to
the data, χ2(1) = 574.15, p < .001, than a single-factor CFA model mapping all items on a
single latent variable (RMSEA = .17; CFI = .70). For the three-factor model, all items loaded
significantly at the .001 level on their intended latent variables. These results indicate that
the scales did possess adequate discriminant and convergent validity for use in our tests of
the hypotheses.

Descriptive Statistics and Correlations

Means, standard deviations, and zero-order Pearson correlations among all variables
in this study are presented in Table 1. On average, participants felt rather strongly iden-
tified with their team (M = 5.45, SD = .88; 7-point disagree/agree scale), indicating that
they  attached  positive  value  to  their  team  membership  and  experienced  emotional
involvement with their team. Besides this team identification, participants showed a rea-
sonable  sense  of  distinctiveness  by  seeing  themselves  as  different  from  other  team
members (M = 4.82, SD = .92; 7-point not at all/very large extent scale). Consistent with
our notion that team identification and individual differentiation are mutually indepen-
dent processes, the correlation between these two aspects of identity was not significant.
Team  identification  had  positive  correlations  with  citizenship  behavior  toward  other
team members and individual effectiveness, whereas the correlation with creative behav-
ior  did  not  reach  significance.  In  contrast, individual  differentiation  was  not  signifi-
cantly  related  to  citizenship  behavior  toward  the  team, but  it  was  significantly  and
positively associated with both creative behavior and individual effectiveness. Finally,
citizenship  behavior  and  creative  behavior  were  positively  related  to  each  other, and
positively related to individual effectiveness.

Tests of Hypotheses

As 34 supervisors provided performance ratings across 157 team members, the data had
potential for bias because of the response tendencies of supervisors in performance evaluations.
Moreover, the  157  participants  were  nested  in  34  middle  management  teams  that  varied  to
greater or lesser degrees in size, composition, culture, and task complexity. Given this nested
data structure, we had to take into account individual-level variability as well as group-level
variability in the variables of interest. Specifically, to control for possible supervisor and team
effects, we conducted hierarchical multilevel analyses using the MLwiN computer package
(Goldstein et al., 1998) to decompose the total observed variance into individual-level and
group-level  residual  variances.  MLwiN  produces  an  effect  coefficient  for  each  predictor

variable along with the associated standard error (see Tables 2 and 3). These effect coefficients
are comparable to the unstandardized regression coefficients in ordinary regression analysis.
Additionally, MLwiN produces a chi-square statistic, which indicates how well a given model
fits the data. The difference of the chi-squares of two subsequent models can be used to indi-
cate the increase in model fit (see Tables 2 and 3). Thus, the level of analysis is the individual,
examining the effects of team identification and individual differentiation on individual work
behaviors, while controlling for possible supervisor and team effects.

Hypotheses 1 and 2. We conducted hierarchical multilevel analyses consisting of three
successive steps. In the first step, the sociodemographic variables were entered as covariates
(Table 2, Model 1). In the second step, team identification and individual differentiation were
included  to  test  their  hypothesized  associations  with  citizenship  and  creative  behavior,
respectively (Table 2, Model 2). For exploratory reasons, in the third step, the cross-product
term of team identification and individual differentiation was entered to detect possible two-
way interaction effects (Table 2, Model 3). To facilitate interpretation and minimize prob-
lems of multicollinearity, we used cross-product terms of standardized predictors.

The results shown in Table 2 provide support for Hypotheses 1 and 2. Team identification
was  found  to  be  significantly  and  positively  associated  with  citizenship  behavior  toward
team  members  (Hypothesis  1), whereas  it  was  unrelated  to  creative  behavior.  In  contrast,
individual differentiation was significantly and positively associated with creative behavior
(Hypothesis 2), but unrelated to citizenship behavior toward team members. Team identifi-
cation and individual differentiation were not found to moderate their effects on citizenship
and creative behavior. Thus, we found no indication that one of the identity aspects intensi-
fied or inhibited the effects of the other on citizenship or creative behavior.

Hypotheses 3 and 4. Citizenship behavior toward other team members was hypothesized
to mediate the effect of team identification on individual effectiveness (Hypothesis 3). To test
this hypothesis, we conducted a mediation analysis according to the criteria recommended
by Baron and Kenny (1986). First, the analysis results reported above showed team identifi-
cation to be associated with the mediating variable of citizenship behavior. Second, as shown
in Table  3, additional  multilevel  analysis  demonstrated  that  team  identification  was  posi-
tively  related  to  individual  effectiveness  (Model  2a).  The  third  criterion  requires  that  the
coefficient  of  the  effect  of  team  identification  on  individual  effectiveness  shrinks  on  the
addition of the mediating variable of citizenship behavior. When citizenship behavior was
entered as a predictor (Table 3, Model 3a), the effect coefficient of team identification on
individual effectiveness shrank from .17 (p < .05; Model 2a) to .10 (ns; Model 3a), whereas
the  effect  coefficient  of  citizenship  behavior  was  significant  (.49, p < .001;  Model  3a).
Finally, a  Sobel  test  (Baron  &  Kenny, 1986;  Sobel, 1982)  demonstrated  that  citizenship
behavior significantly mediated the effect of team identification on individual effectiveness
(z = 2.35, p < .05). These results provided support for Hypothesis 3.

Creative behavior was hypothesized to mediate the effect of individual differentiation on
individual  effectiveness  (Hypothesis  4).  Regarding  the  first  two  criteria  of  mediation, we
found individual differentiation to be associated with both creative behavior (Table 2, Model
2) and individual effectiveness (Table 3, Model 2b). On addition of creative behavior in the

ior significantly mediated the effect of individual differentiation on individual effectiveness
(z = 4.49, p < .001). These results provided support for Hypothesis 4.

Discussion

The results of this study show that when individuals identified themselves more strongly
with their team, they engaged in more citizenship behaviors toward other team members;
such citizenship behaviors were found to be unrelated to the extent to which individuals felt
differentiated and distinct from other team members. To the best of our knowledge, we con-
ducted the first empirical test of linkages between individuals’ multiple identities and cre-
ative behavior, and we found individual differentiation to be positively related to creative
behavior, whereas  team  identification  did  not  make  a  difference.  Moreover, citizenship
behavior  appeared  to  link  team  identification  to  an  individual’s  effectiveness  as  a  team
member, whereas creative behavior was the mediating linkage in the relationship between
individual differentiation and individual effectiveness.

Potential Limitations

Clearly, these findings need to be considered in light of the limitations associated with the
design of our study. First, the cross-sectional design did not allow us to be conclusive on the
direction of causality among the variables. The results are vulnerable to opposite or bidirec-
tional  relationships  owing  to  the  possibility  that  citizenship  and  creative  behaviors  might
have influenced processes of team identification and individual differentiation. An argument
against this possibility of reversed causality might be the fact that social identity theory and
research  persuasively  present  identification  processes  as  a  major  cause  of  an  individual’s
actual behavior in team contexts (e.g., Brickson, 2000; Dutton et al., 1994; Hogg & Terry,
2000; Randel & Jaussi, 2003; Van Knippenberg, 2000). Nonetheless, experimental and lon-
gitudinal studies are needed to provide evidence of causation.

Second, it may be argued that the supervisor ratings of participants’ citizenship and cre-
ative behaviors and their individual effectiveness as team members were found to be related
because  they  were  measured  using  the  same  questionnaire  tapping  perceptions  from  the
same source. However, in general, supervisors are assumed to appraise employees’ perfor-
mance relatively accurately because they have an extensive and established knowledge of job
requirements and performance standards, they can observe on a regular basis how employ-
ees actually perform in their jobs, and they can compare achievements systematically among
respective employees (cf. Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2003). For these reasons, in
most  organizations, employee  performance  appraisals  rely  predominantly  on  supervisor
assessments.  Moreover, specific  to  the  present  results, CFA  revealed  that  a  three-factor
model differentiating between citizenship behavior, creative behavior, and individual effec-
tiveness possessed a much better fit to the data than a single-factor model mapping all items
on a single latent variable. If our data were biased because of common method variance, then
the  single-factor  model  would  not  have  shown  such  a  misfit  to  the  data.  Furthermore, if
common-method bias was a problem, we should have observed similar rather than differen-
tial relationships of citizenship behavior and creative behavior with the identity aspects of
team identification and individual differentiation. We therefore believe that common method
bias is an unlikely explanation for the differential pattern of relationships reported here.

Journal of Management / February 2008

Third, to test the notion that team identification motivates individual team members to
behave  in  team-typical  ways, we  focused  on  citizenship  behaviors  directed  at  benefiting
other team members as an indication of such team-typical behavior. However, this type of
citizenship  behavior  is  rather  altruistic  in  nature  and  does  not  include  other  citizenship
dimensions such as courtesy, sportsmanship, or civic virtue (e.g., keeping up with relevant
team matters). Future research might examine the extent to which these citizenship behav-
iors and other cooperative behaviors mediate the relationship between an individual’s iden-
tification with the team and his or her effectiveness as a team member.

Fourth, we examined identification processes, work behaviors, and individual effective-
ness among members of one particular type of teams (middle management teams) in only
one type of organization. It is possible that team characteristics and organization type shape
the magnitude or even the direction of the impact of each of the two identification processes.
For example, individual differentiation might be a major driver of creativity and effective-
ness in team contexts characterized by complex tasks and volatile environments, whereas
team identification is critical for effectiveness in teams that perform more routine tasks in
relatively  stable  environments.  To  generalize  and  extend  the  theory  proposed  and  results
reported in the present study, researchers should examine how team identification and indi-
vidual  differentiation  influence  the  individual  performance  of  members  of  various  teams
embedded in different types of organizations.

Theoretical Implications

Notwithstanding these limitations, the present results may have implications for the social
identity approach to organizational behavior. A principal notion of this approach holds that
team identification encourages individuals to contribute to the collective by acting in team-
typical  ways, whereas  individual  differentiation  has  been  proposed  to  hinder  individuals
from being effective team members, as strong feelings of individuality would be associated
with self-serving behavior directed at advancing the individual alone rather than benefiting the
team  (e.g., Brickson, 2000;  Dutton  et  al., 1994;  Randel  &  Jaussi, 2003; Van  Knippenberg,
2000). The present finding that individual differentiation motivates individuals in teams to per-
form creatively runs counter to the oversimplified view that individual differentiation hinders
individuals from being effective as team members. It also underscores the need to accumulate
more comprehensive knowledge about when (conditional moderators) and how (clarifying
mediators) social and personal identities encourage or hinder individuals in contributing to
the team. This study shows that the influence of team identification and individual differen-
tiation on performance is dependent on the particular type of performance under considera-
tion. This particular contingency might in part clarify why our finding of the effectiveness of
individual differentiation departs from Randel and Jaussi’s (2003) finding that members of
cross-functional teams who differentiated themselves more strongly were less effective team
members. In their study, Randel and Jaussi used a measure of individual performance that
encompassed both in-role and extrarole behaviors. Rather than using such a composite mea-
sure  of  performance, we  distinguished  citizenship  and  creative  behavior  as  two  separate
components  of  performance  and  found  that  creative  behavior  was  strongly  and  positively
linked with individual differentiation.


Janssen, Huang / Team Members’ Behaviors

83

The present results confirm and extend the recently developed notion that the expression
of  individuality  and  the  formation  of  a  social  identity  can  be  reconcilable  in  interactive
groups that appreciate the value of individual qualities and diversity (e.g., Hornsey & Jetten,
2004; Jetten et al., 2002; Postmes et al., 2005; Rink & Ellemers, 2007). We found that team
identification and individual differentiation were not only mutually independent dimensions,
but also related to different work behaviors. This pattern of results runs counter to the orig-
inal social identity principle of functional antagonism, which states that strong team identi-
fication weakens individual differentiation, and that individuals who see themselves as more
different  from  other  team  members  are  less  attached  to  the  team  (e.g., Brickson, 2000;
Haslam et al., 2000; Turner, 1985). However, this principle of functional antagonism is based
on the assumption that a person’s social and personal identity cannot be equally salient at the
same time (Turner et al., 1987). Although our results suggest that team identification and
individual differentiation vary independently of one another, we cannot answer the question
of  whether  individuals  hold  team  attributes  and  personal  attributes  simultaneously, or
whether  they  alternate  between  team  and  personal  attributes. Anyhow, the  nonsignificant
correlation between team identification and individual differentiation found in the present
study indicates that these distinct identity processes coexist in a person and operate as com-
plementary drivers of different behaviors.

The creative potential of individual differentiation processes found in this study may also
cast new light on the “value in diversity” hypothesis (e.g., Jehn, Northcraft, & Neale, 1999;
K. Y. Williams & O’Reilly, 1998). This hypothesis states that diverse team members may
reach outstandingly innovative performance when they succeed in pooling together and inte-
grating their diverse qualities in synergetic manners. This “value in diversity” phenomenon
relies in particular on the unique qualities that individual members contribute (Swann et al.,
2003). The results of the present research suggest that the extent to which team members
come up with unique ideas is regulated by processes of individual differentiation rather than
team identification. In a recent field study among multidisciplinary work teams by Van der
Vegt and Bunderson (2005), however, it was found that diverse team members were better
able to exchange information and to learn from one another when there was a sense of team
identification than when there was not. Possibly, individual differentiation and team identi-
fication play complementary roles in the “value in diversity” phenomenon, such that cre-
ativity provoked by individual differentiation and sharing promoted by team identification
result in innovative teams. In future research, this possibility can be investigated by identifying
when  and  how  individual  differentiation  and  team  identification  facilitate  diverse  team
members to attain the potential value of their diversity in qualities.

The present results need also to be discussed in light of recent studies showing that group
members with a proself motivation performed better than group members with a prosocial
motivation on postnegotiation tasks requiring divergent thinking and behavior (Beersma & De
Dreu, 2005). Likewise, another study by Goncalo and Staw (2006) showed that individualis-
tic groups were more creative than collectivistic groups when there were specific instructions
(i.e., norms) for creativity. Thus, whereas we take an identity-based approach by distinguish-
ing between team identification and individual differentiation, these studies used social moti-
vation and cultural values as frameworks and also found that an emphasis on individuality
encourages  divergent  thinking  and  creativity.  Moreover, the  study  by  Goncalo  and  Staw
(2006)  counteracted  the  “norms  for  creativity” hypothesis  (e.g., Flynn  &  Chatman, 2001;


84

Journal of Management / February 2008

O’Reilly & Chatman, 1996) by showing that collectivistic groups who were instructed for
creativity were less rather than more creative than individualistic groups. Correspondingly, we
found no indication that a strong team identification intensified the positive effect of individ-
ual differentiation on creativity. Apparently, a strong sense of individuality in itself facilitates
creativity “because it emphasizes uniqueness and standing out from one’s group, instead of
cohesiveness and conformity with group norms” (Goncalo & Staw, 2006: 105).

As such, the important role of individual differentiation in creativity found in the present
study seems to touch a topic in a much broader debate on the bright and dark sides of teams
in organizations. That is, in the last decades, team-based structures have become increasingly
the norm for organizations. Both the popular press and management scholars have under-
pinned this structural choice by suggesting that organizations can gain competitive advan-
tage if they place the needs of the work group over those of the individual and thus should
create a fundamental shift from an individualistic orientation to a more collectivistic way of
thinking and doing (cf. Goncalo & Staw, 2006; Locke et al., 2001). Empirical work indeed
shows  that  team-oriented  attitudes  and  motivations  may  foster  cooperation, learning, and
team performance (e.g., Van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005; Wagner, 1995). However, the pre-
sent results and previous studies (e.g., Beersma & De Dreu, 2005; Goncalo & Staw, 2006)
also suggest that exclusively focusing on team-oriented approaches may have serious down-
side risks when such a one-sided focus on the team may extinguish a strong sense of indi-
viduality among team members. Because team identification fosters conformity rather than
creativity, team members need a strong sense of individuality as a complementary driver to
be able to produce creative ideas that are deviant from current beliefs and values shared in
the  team.  To  meet  the  requirements  of  both  integration  and  innovation, a  double-sided
emphasis on the team and the individual seems to be more promising as it may help indi-
viduals  identify  with  the  team  because  they  feel  encouraged  to  develop  and  express  their
unique  and  idiosyncratic  attributes.  Such  a  double-sided  rather  than  one-sided  emphasis
might  be  a  conditional  factor  that  can  prevent  the  trade-off  between  team-focused  and
individual-focused behaviors reported in some previous studies (e.g., Beersma & De Dreu,
2005; Goncalo & Staw, 2006). Future research may focus on identifying antecedents, condi-
tions, and group dynamics that enhance and bolster a team climate in which individuals can
both feel identified with their team and see themselves as different from other team members.

Practical Implications

The present study offers several practical implications for practitioners and managers who
aim to improve the functioning of teams by optimizing the performance and effectiveness of
each individual team member. Our findings suggest that strengthening a team’s identity should
pay off as team members with stronger team identification engage in more citizenship behav-
iors that facilitate the team in fulfilling its integrative function in the organization. However,
such a team identity should include appreciation of individuality, because team members who
highlight their unique qualities are likely to generate and come up with creative ideas for inno-
vative change. Team leaders and organizational reward systems may advance this unleashing
of creativity in teams by supporting and valuing creative work behavior as an important indi-
vidual competency, in addition to emphasizing team-oriented competencies such as helping

85

and cooperative behaviors. Such balanced support and reward of both individual-typical and
team-typical attributes may advance a sense of team identification that allows and even encour-
ages individual team members to express their idiosyncratic creativity to help the team meet
the requirements of innovation. Team building interventions have long focused on establishing
team  identity,
increasing  group  cohesiveness, and  enhancing  cooperation  among  team
members. Nowadays, there is also a growing attention to encouraging individuals in teams to
exhibit creative behaviors by developing a more participative and innovative team climate. Our
findings suggest that these two types of team interventions are not necessarily mutually exclu-
sive. Because both team identification and individual differentiation seem to be able to coex-
ist, practical managers should consider combining both approaches to strengthen team identity
and  cohesiveness  while  celebrating  individuality.  In  doing  so, individual  members  of  such
work teams are more likely to be more effective in terms of cooperation and innovation.
