Drawing on emerging multilevel theorizing in human resources manage-
ment, we tested a multilevel model of high-performance work systems
(HPWS), using data obtained from 324 managers and 522 employees
in 76 Japanese establishments. Results from cross-level analyses indi-
cated that the relationships between establishment-level HPWS and em-
ployee job satisfaction and affective commitment were fully mediated by
establishment-level concern for employees climate. These results shed
new light on the mechanisms through which HPWS impacts employee
outcomes and serve to bridge between macro and micro perspectives of
human resource management. The research and practice implications of
the ﬁndings are discussed.

High demand and competition for employee and managerial talent has
led to increasing interest in understanding the potential beneﬁts of using
high-performance work systems (HPWS) as a means to maximize ﬁrms’
competitive advantage (e.g., Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Sun, Aryee,
& Law, 2007). HPWS refer to a group of separate but interconnected HR
management practices, including comprehensive recruitment and selec-
tion procedures, incentive compensation and performance management
systems, and extensive employee involvement and training, which are de-
signed to enhance employee and ﬁrm performance outcomes through im-
proving workforce competence, attitudes, and motivation (Huselid, 1995).
Research has shown that HPWS can help companies leverage their human
capital toward improving ﬁrm performance (Arthur, 1994; Combs, Liu,
Hall, & Ketchen, 2006; Datta, Guthrie, & Wright, 2005; Guthrie, 2001).

Indeed, Collins and Smith (2006, p. 545) suggest that HR systems “affect
ﬁrm performance by creating an organizational environment that elicits
employee behaviors and capabilities that contribute to ﬁrm competitive
advantage.”

Building on this evidence, the ﬁeld of strategic HRM research has
increasingly recognized the role of employees in the HRM practices-ﬁrm
performance relationship. In line with sociotechnical views of organiza-
tions (Trist & Bamforth, 1951), several scholars have proposed that the
HRM technical system, consisting of HRM strategies and practices, inﬂu-
ences organizational outcomes through various social mechanisms, such
as climate, social exchanges, and employee attitudes and behaviors (e.g.,
Collins & Smith, 2006; Delery & Shaw, 2001; Evans & Davis, 2005;
Ostroff & Bowen, 2000). However, the assumption that HRM systems
impact employees’ attitudes and behaviors, as well as ﬁrm performance,
through various social processes has remained largely untested.1 With
few exceptions, research to date has not empirically examined the so-
cial mechanisms through which HPWS inﬂuence its proposed outcomes,
such as ﬁrm performance (e.g., Sun et al., 2007; Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang,
& Takeuchi, 2007) and individual-level attitudes (Whitener, 2001). In-
deed, reviews by Lepak, Liao, Chung, and Harden (2006) and Wright and
Boswell (2002) have noted the paucity in multilevel research that inte-
grates between macro concepts such as HPWS and more micro HR-related
processes and outcomes. Thus, we still have very little empirical evidence
in support of the mechanisms through which HPWS inﬂuence outcomes
in organizations and the theorized cross-level inﬂuences of HPWS on
employee attitudes and motivation.

Accordingly, we argue that adopting a multilevel theoretical perspec-
tive, which considers aspects of the organization’s social system, is needed
to fully understand how HRM systems relate to employee attitudes and be-
haviors. Our research focuses on HPWS and climate that exist in establish-
ments, deﬁned as a stand-alone entity with a business address but distinct
from a company (Osterman, 1994), given that different HR systems can be
implemented across establishments belonging to a single ﬁrm (Ichniowski,
Shaw, & Prennushi, 1997). We study two employee job attitudes—job sat-
isfaction (i.e., one’s overall satisfaction with one’s job; Judge, Thoresen,
Bono, & Patton, 2001) and affective commitment (i.e., one’s emotional at-
tachment to and psychological identiﬁcation with the organization; Allen
& Meyer, 1990)—that have been linked to important outcomes such as
productive and counterproductive performance and turnover. Building on

1This statement applies to studies on strategic HRM where scholars focus on a system of
HR practices. There are studies that had examined the relationship between more speciﬁc
set of HR practices and climate, for example (cf. Kopelman, Brief, & Guzzo, 1990).

social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) and orga-
nizational climate research, we also examine whether concern for employ-
ees climate (Burke, Borucki, & Hurley, 1992)—which we argue below
reﬂects an important social mechanism—helps explain how HPWS relate
to employee attitudes. Thus, the key purpose of this research is to provide
an initial examination of the cross-level linkages between establishment-
level HPWS and employee-level outcomes, as mediated by establishment-
level climate. The conceptual model tested in this research is summarized
in Figure 1.

Our primary contribution involves the amalgamation of research on
HPWS, organizational climate, and employee attitudes, which provides a
more explicit integration of micro and macro views of the management
of human resources in work organizations. As noted by several authors
(Ostroff & Bowen, 2000; Ployhart, 2004; Wright & Boswell, 2002), HRM
research has progressed on two parallel tracks—micro (with its focus on
enhancing individual-level productivity, attitudes, well-being, and reten-
tion) and macro (with its focus on ﬁrm-level HR strategies, functions, and
practices). Integration between macro and micro HRM has been lacking,
leading to insufﬁcient understanding of whether and how strategic HRM
might impact individual-level outcomes. Thus, this research seeks to en-
hance our understanding of the complex, multilevel pathways through
which an important strategic HRM concept (HPWS) inﬂuences important
individual outcomes in organizations.

Conceptual Background and Hypotheses

Strategic HRM is deﬁned as “the pattern of planned human resource
deployments and activities intended to enable an organization to achieve
its goals” (Wright & McMahan, 1992, p. 298). As such, strategic HRM
adopts a systems view to examine the effects of a bundle of HR practices
(Wright & McMahan, 1992), which differentiates strategic HRM stud-
ies from more traditional functional views of HR. Within the strategic
HRM literature, the concept of HPWS has emerged as a core construct
encompassing the extent to which ﬁrms invest in the attraction, selection,
management, and retention of the best possible human capital (Huselid,
1995; Lepak et al., 2006; Lepak & Snell, 2002). That is, HPWS are in-
dicative of the value ﬁrms place on their human capital as a source for
competitive advantage, with higher HPWS levels indicative of greater
value ﬁrms place in their human capital.

Although HPWS have been proposed to inﬂuence employee motiva-
tion and attitudes, little research has actually tested this proposition. The
behavioral perspective of the ﬁrm (Jackson, Schuler, & Rivero, 1989)
provides a backdrop for examining the mediating mechanisms through
which HPWS impact outcomes. According to this perspective, ﬁrms rely
on HR practices, such as HPWS, to elicit and control certain employee
role behaviors and attitudes (Jackson et al., 1989). However, the relation-
ships between HPWS and employee-level outcomes may not be direct.
Rather, Bowen and Ostroff (2004) and Ostroff and Bowen (2000) proposed
that organizational climate serves as a key mediating mechanism linking
HRM systems to individual-level outcomes. Unfortunately, the question
of whether climate mediates HR system’s inﬂuences on employee-level
outcomes has been largely ignored in empirical strategic HRM research
(Combs et al., 2006; Evans & Davis, 2005; Ostroff, Kinicki, & Tamkins,
2003).

HPWS and Concern for Employees Climate

Organizational climate is deﬁned as “the shared perceptions of em-
ployees concerning the practices, procedures, and kinds of behaviors that
get rewarded and supported in a particular setting” (Schneider, White,
& Paul, 1998, p. 151). According to Zohar (2000), climate captures em-
ployees’ perceptions regarding how formal organizational policies and
procedures are practiced or implemented in their organization. In other
words, organizational climate reﬂects employee perceptions of what is
important and what behaviors are expected and rewarded in the organi-
zation (e.g., Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). The climate literature has distin-
guished between organizational climate, which is shared among members

of a work or organizational unit, and individual (psychological) climate,
which can differ across members of the same unit (Chan, 1998; James
& James, 1989). Although individuals may hold different perceptions of
psychological climate, several authors have argued that climate percep-
tions are likely to be more similar within work units than between work
units. Shared climate perceptions likely develop in work units in part due
to ambient social and structural stimuli operating on all members of the
same unit (e.g., exposure to similar norms, leadership, and HR practices)
and in part due to attraction-selection-attrition processes that can lead to
homogeneity in values and perceptions in work organizations (Borucki
& Burke, 1999; Chan, 1998; Ostroff et al., 2003; Schneider & Bowen,
1985). Climate scholars have also differentiated between climates for spe-
ciﬁc targets, such as safety (e.g., Zohar, 2000), service (e.g., Schneider
et al., 1998), or empowerment (e.g., Seibert, Silver, & Randolph, 2004),
as well as global or generalized climate perceptions (e.g., Burke et al.,
1992; James & James, 1989).

Because our focus is on how climate mediates between a broad system
of HRM practices (HPWS), which applies to all members of an establish-
ment, and employee job attitudes, we focus on shared generalized organi-
zational climate. Speciﬁcally, we examine concern for employees climate,
which, similarly to James and James’s (1989) notion of general psycho-
logical climate, represents individual employee’s cognitive appraisals of
the extent to which the organizations values and cares about its employ-
ees’ well-being (Burke et al., 1992). According to Burke et al. (1992),
concern for employees climate includes six dimensions: goal emphasis,
management support, nonmonetary reward orientation, monetary reward
orientation, work group cooperation, and means emphasis. Concern for
employees climate is similar to the notion of organization care, which,
building on organizational support theory, McAllister and Bigley (2002,
p. 895) deﬁned as “an organization-level and organization-centered phe-
nomenon reﬂecting perceptions regarding the broad provision of care by
the organization to all employees.” Employees in the same establish-
ment likely share perceptions of concern for employees’ climate because
they are exposed to similar stimuli and experiences that inform them of
how employees are treated by their organization, such as HRM practices.
Indeed, Borucki and Burke (1999) found evidence that concern for em-
ployees climate emerged as a shared, establishment-level climate in their
study of service providers in retail stores.

We propose that establishments’ HPWS positively impact employees’
shared perceptions of concern for employees’ climate, or shared beliefs
regarding the extent to which an establishment supports and cares about
its employees. According to Ostroff and Bowen (2000), climate serves as
an important linking mechanism between HRM practices and employee
attitudes. In line with social information processing theory (Salancik &


6

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Pfeffer, 1978) and prior theories of organizational climate (e.g., Kopel-
man et al., 1990; McGregor, 1960), Bowen and Ostroff (2004, p. 204)
proposed further that “features of an HRM system . . . send signals to
employees that allow them to understand the desired and appropriate re-
sponses and form a collective sense of what is expected.” Following this
rationale, we argue that HPWS involve a set of HR practices that signal
employees that their establishment values, cares about, and supports its
employees. For example, rigorous and selective stafﬁng within HPWS
signiﬁes that the establishment cares about the quality of the employees
it hires (e.g., Huselid, 1995). Similarly, compensation programs such as
incentive plans, proﬁt-sharing plans, or gain-sharing plans, as well as de-
velopmental and merit-based performance appraisal and strong emphasis
on ﬂexible work assignments (e.g., job rotation) are collectively indicative
that the establishment focuses on motivating and developing its employ-
ees (cf. Burke et al., 1992). Further, Sun et al. (2007, p. 561) assert that
“extensive skills training foster the perception of the work environment
as being supportive.” Such high-performance HRM practices are more
visible in establishments than organizations, given their smaller size, and
hence are especially likely to inﬂuence concern for employees’ climate at
that level. As such, we predict:

Hypothesis 1: Establishment-level HPWS are positively related to

establishment-level concern for employees’ climate.

The Mediating Role of Concern for Employees Climate

As indicated above, conceptualizations of HPWS assume that such sys-
tems include a set of practices that inﬂuence employee motivation and atti-
tudes (Huselid, 1995). Yet, research to date has not actually tested whether
HPWS predict employee attitudes. In this study, we examine the cross-
level linkages between establishment-level HPWS and employees’ job
satisfaction and affective commitment, and propose that establishment-
level concern for employees’ climate mediates these linkages. There is
ample evidence that job satisfaction and affective commitment promote
a host of positive individual-level behavioral and performance outcomes
(e.g., Judge et al., 2001; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990), as well as unit-level per-
formance outcomes (e.g., Ostroff, 1992; Ryan, Schmit, & Johnson, 1996).
As such, understanding whether and how HPWS lead to employees’ job
satisfaction and affective commitment is important, as it can help shed
more light on the multilevel mechanisms through which HPWS impact
organizational outcomes.

We expect that establishment-level HPWS and concern for employ-
ees climate have cross-level inﬂuences on individual job attitudes—
that is, these establishment-level predictors are expected to account for

between-establishment differences in average levels of employees’ job
attitudes. This requires that job attitudes vary not just between individu-
als (i.e., within establishments) but also between establishments, and that
HPWS and concern for employees climate explain establishment-level
variability in job attitudes (see Bliese, 2002). Note, however, that average
levels of job attitudes in establishments (or establishment-level variance in
job attitudes) do not necessarily represent establishment-level constructs;
rather, they represent establishment-level differences in individual-level
phenomena that are amenable to establishment-level inﬂuences (cf. Ko-
zlowski & Klein, 2000). Indeed, the evidence noted above that job attitudes
relate signiﬁcantly to both individual-level and unit-level outcomes pro-
vides some support that job attitudes can vary meaningfully across levels
(cf. Chen, Mathieu, & Bliese, 2004). Research by Ostroff (1992, 1993)
has shown further that (a) job satisfaction and affective commitment vary
signiﬁcantly both within and between organizational units, and that (b)
differences in job attitudes are explained by both individual-level and
unit-level predictors. Thus, although job satisfaction and affective com-
mitment reﬂect individual experiences, they are likely to be affected by
attributes of both the individuals and the context in which individuals
operate. Therefore, the cross-level effects we examine consider the extent
to which individual-level job satisfaction and affective commitment vary
between establishments as a function of establishment-level HPWS and
concern for employees’ climate.

Social information processing theory and the organizational climate
literature further support our expectation that the cross-level impact of
HPWS on individual job attitudes is mediated by concern for employees’
climate. According to social information processing theory (Salancik &
Pfeffer, 1978, p. 227), the social environment in which individuals op-
erate inﬂuences individual attitudes in organization because the social
environment “provides a direct construction of meaning through guides
to socially acceptable beliefs, attitudes, and needs, and acceptable reasons
for action.” The organizational climate literature suggests that climate is
a particularly powerful social mechanism through which HRM practices
impact individual attitudes because climate shapes how employees con-
strue the meaning of organizational practices (Burke et al., 1992; Ferris
et al., 1998; Ostroff & Bowen, 2000; Ostroff et al., 2003). In line with
these arguments, HPWS likely inﬂuence employee job satisfaction and
affective commitment because they lead to a more positive concern for
employees’ climate in establishments. Speciﬁcally, in the globally shared
climate created by HPWS, employees likely view their establishment as
caring about its employees’ success and well-being (Borucki & Burke,
1999; McAllister & Bigley, 2002), and hence are more satisﬁed with
their jobs and more committed to their organization. Thus, concern for


8

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

employees’ climate provides the lens through which HPWS promote em-
ployees’ job satisfaction and affective commitment.

The climate literature provides empirical support for the relationship
between concern for employees climate and employee attitudes. As re-
viewed by Ostroff et al. (2003), researchers found relationships between
climate and individual job attitudes. Research by James and James (1989),
for example, detected a strong positive link between general psychological
climate (at the individual-level) and employee job satisfaction. Moreover,
Schulte, Ostroff, and Kinicki (2006) found that organizational-level cli-
mate can have unique cross-level inﬂuence on individual job satisfaction
when also taking into account the inﬂuence of individual-level, psycho-
logical climate. Thus, although we are not aware of research examining
whether concern for employees climate mediates between HPWS and job
attitudes, the theoretical rationale and empirical evidence above suggest
that concern for employees climate is more proximal to individual job
attitudes than HPWS and, further, that concern for employees climate
can mediate between HPWS and employees’ job attitudes. Therefore, we
expect the following:

Hypothesis 2: Establishment-level concern for employees’ climate
mediates the positive cross-level relationship between
establishment-level HPWS and average levels of indi-
vidual job satisfaction in establishments.

Hypothesis 3: Establishment-level concern for employees’ climate
mediates the positive cross-level relationship between
establishment-level HPWS and average levels of indi-
vidual affective commitment in establishments.

Method

Sample, Design, and Procedure

As part of a larger research project,2 we approached establishments
from 120 Japanese companies. Gerhart, Wright, McMahan, and Snell
(2000) noted that establishment-level surveys may be more reliable than

2Takeuchi et al. (2007) relied on data from the same sample. However, the only overlap-
ping variable across the two studies is HPWS. Moreover, Takeuchi et al. (2007) focused on
different substantive relationships (establishment-level relationships between HPWS and
performance) and different theories than the present paper. In auxiliary analyses reported
in the Results section, we also demonstrate empirically that other mediators from Takeuchi
et al.’s paper—human capital and social exchanges—were less relevant to explaining in-
dividual level job attitudes than was concern for employees climate. Thus, the two papers
are substantively and empirically distinct.

corporate-level surveys because the managers are likely to be more famil-
iar with the HR practices that are being implemented at their establishment
due to a smaller size (see also Batt, 2002). Given concerns related to single-
rater biases in strategic HRM research (Gerhart et al., 2000), we sought to
collect data from multiple managers and multiple employees within each
establishment. The original population consisted of a convenience sample
of Japanese companies with which a Japanese faculty member on the re-
search team had a personal connection. Although convenience sampling
can yield less representative samples, relying on personal contacts helped
ensure higher response rates in the sample. Also, care was taken to select
companies that are somewhat representative of various industry sectors.
Once the consent of the top management of each participating com-
pany had been secured, HR managers were asked to arrange site visits,
during which we provided surveys to managers and employees at each
establishment. All managers and employees were white-collar, full-time,
permanent employees. We focused on white-collar managers and staff be-
cause they are particularly likely to be exposed to, and hence be familiar
with, HPWS in Japanese establishments. Survey responses were returned
to the research team using prepaid and self-addressed envelopes. In the
cover letter to the survey, the purpose of the project and the voluntary
nature of participation were described. Respondents were assured of the
anonymity of their responses and the opportunity to receive feedback. To
maximize response rate, our contacts in the companies were contacted by
phone and/or e-mail 2 weeks after the initial distribution of the survey. A
second round of follow-ups was conducted by mail, enclosing another set
of surveys. This was reinforced again by phone calls and/or e-mails to all
potential respondents. A ﬁnal round of contact/communication was con-
ducted by mail, again enclosing a survey packet. There was no incentive
(cash or otherwise) for participating in this project.

Of the 120 companies approached, 56 agreed to participate (47% re-
sponse rate). The ﬁnal sample for this study consisted of 76 business
establishments from 56 different companies located in Japan, covering a
range of industries and geographical regions, including 33 establishments
from manufacturing; 4 from construction; 7 from the transportation, com-
munication, electric, gas, and sanitary services sectors; 7 from wholesale
trade; 5 from retail trade; 6 from ﬁnance, insurance, and real estate; and 14
others; mean establishment size was 385 (SD = 639, range = 7 to 4056).
Each of the 76 establishments provided usable responses from at least
one manager and two employees, which we deemed necessary to ensure
multiple data sources for each establishment.3 The managerial sample

3In order to alleviate concerns related with the number of employee responses relative

to establishment size, we conducted auxiliary analyses that are detailed below.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

consisted of 324 managers (average per unit was 4, with a range of 1 to
26; there were 23 units from which only one managerial response was ob-
tained). The managers, on average, had 19 years of work experience at the
establishment (SD = 12), 10 years of job tenure (SD = 10), were 48 years
old (SD = 7.91), were predominantly male (96%), and majority were at
the levels of middle management (36.8%) or supervisors (36.5%). For the
employee sample, the total number of respondents was 522 with an aver-
age of 7 responses per unit (ranging between 2 and 48). The employees, on
average, had 8 years of work experience at the establishment (SD = 8.12),
6 years of job tenure (SD = 6.46), were 36 years old (SD = 8.43), were
predominantly male (81%), and were employed full-time (90%).

Measures

We followed the procedures recommended by Brislin (1990) for sur-
vey translations across different languages. First, the primary author who
is ﬂuent in Japanese created and translated the English survey items into
Japanese. Second, the primary author and another Japanese faculty mem-
ber in human resource management who is proﬁcient in English improved
the translation through iterative processes where any concerns or dis-
crepancies between the English and Japanese versions were detected and
addressed. To validate the survey translation, two Japanese employees
not afﬁliated with this study read through the Japanese version to test
its readability and ease of comprehension. Any concerns were noted and
addressed. As a ﬁnal check, a third Japanese native translated the survey
back into English, and the Japanese and English versions were compared
for any discrepancies; none were detected.

The importance and difﬁculty of developing appropriate systems of
measurement across cultures has been generally recognized (e.g., Brislin,
1990; Lonner, 1990). With this in mind, extra care was taken to ensure
that the selected items were phrased in language that would be familiar
and meaningful for the Japanese employees (Lonner, 1990). In addition,
due to response rate consideration, several measures had to be shortened
to keep the survey length to a minimum. In shortening the scales, we
attempted to include items that (a) loaded well on their factors in prior
research, and (b) translated especially well to the Japanese context. Unless
otherwise noted, scales were scored using a 7-point Likert-type anchors
ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree.

High-performance work systems (aggregate, establishment-level).
Managers completed the 13-item HPWS scale developed by Huselid
(1995). Given that we were interested in the HR practices used in the
establishment, the instruction speciﬁcally stated: “Please provide your
best estimate of the percentage of employees covered by the following


RIKI TAKEUCHI ET AL.

11

HR practices for the establishment. When answering this section, please
think about those HR practices used for the employees in your establish-
ment!” Thus, the items asked the managers about establishment-level HR
practices; for example, “What is the extent of the workforce that uses per-
formance appraisals to determine their compensation?” (1= not at all, 2=
minimally, 3 = not too much, 4 = not much, 5 = somewhat extensively,
6 = moderately extensively, 7 = very extensively). Coefﬁcient alpha for
the HPWS scale was .83, indicating that items were internally consis-
tent. Furthermore, this 13-item HPWS scale correlated signiﬁcantly (r =
.42, p < .001) with an alternative 21-item HPWS measure obtained from
employees, which was adapted from Lepak and Snell (2002) to ﬁt the
Japanese context. This indicates good convergent validity for Huselid’s
HPWS scale and provides evidence the scale is adequate in a Japanese
context. For this study, we relied on managers’ ratings of Huselid’s HPWS
scale to reduce common-method biases because all other measures were
collected from employees.

Concern for employees climate (aggregate, establishment-level).
Similar to Eisenberger, Armeli, Rexwinkel, Lynch, and Rhoades (2001),
we selected six high loading items from Eisenberger, Hungtinton,
Hutchison, and Sowa (1986), which reﬂect the management support and
reward orientation aspects of concern for employees (psychological) cli-
mate (Burke et al., 1992). In particular, concern for employees climate
was measured by the following six items: “The establishment values our
contribution to its well-being,” “If the establishment could hire someone
to replace us at a lower salary it would do so” (reverse coded), “The estab-
lishment fails to appreciate any extra effort from us” (reverse coded), “The
establishment would ignore any complaints from us” (reverse coded), “The
establishment disregards our best interests when it makes decisions that
affect us” (reverse coded), and “Help is available from our establishment
when we have a problem.”

As in McAllister and Bigley (2002), these items were reworded such
that the establishment, as opposed to the individual employee, was the
focal referent in all items (i.e., the adapted measure reﬂected a referent-
shift consensus model; Chan, 1998). We used “establishments” as the
target of climate items for a couple of reasons. First, this matches the
target of HPWS (i.e., establishments) we used in this study, which follows
the suggestion by Gerhart et al. (2000). Second, Dietz, Pugh, and Wiley
(2004), among others, showed that climate perceptions targeted at the
branch-level (i.e., establishments) were stronger predictors of important
outcomes than that targeted at the organizational-level. Cronbach’s alpha
for this six-item scale was .80.

Job satisfaction (individual-level). Employees’ overall job satisfac-
tion was measured by three items from Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins, and


12

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Klesh (1979): “All in all, I am satisﬁed with my job,” “In general, I like
working here,” and “All things considered, I am satisﬁed with my current
job,” with a coefﬁcient alpha of .93.

Affective commitment (individual-level). Employees’ affective com-
mitment to the organization was measured by three items from Allen and
Meyer (1990): “This organization has a great deal of personal meaning
for me,” “I feel like “part of the family” at my organization,” and “I
feel ‘emotionally attached’ to this organization,” with a coefﬁcient alpha
of .85.

Control variables. Given that we obtained responses from multiple
establishments in 3 of the 56 companies, we created three dummy coded
variables to control for potential systematic effects of the ﬁrms (Company
Dummy 1 with 13 establishment responses, Company Dummy 2 with 4
establishment responses, and Company Dummy 3 with 4 establishment
responses). The rest of the companies provided responses from a single
establishment. As industry characteristics have been shown to have an
impact in strategic HRM (e.g., Datta et al., 2005), we also included six
industry dummies at a level equivalent to single digit SIC code ([1] Con-
struction; [2] Manufacturing; [3] Transportation, Communication, Elec-
tric, Gas, Sanitary Services; [4] Wholesale Trade; [5] Retail Trade; and
[6] Finance, Insurance, Real Estate). The company and industry dummies
helped us tease out establishment-level effects from potential ﬁrm- and
industry-level effects. In addition, we controlled for establishment size
(using a natural log transformation, due to its highly skewed distribution),
given HR practices (e.g., Datta et al., 2005; Guthrie, 2001) and concern
for employees climate (e.g., Dietz et al., 2004) may vary as a function
of establishment size. We also controlled for percentage of employee re-
sponses obtained for each establishment, to remove possible inﬂuences of
differences in response rates across establishments. Furthermore, at the
individual-level, we controlled for employee age, gender, education level,
and organizational tenure because these variables were found to be related
to job attitudes or relationships involving job attitudes (e.g., Judge et al.,
2001; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990).

Conﬁrmatory Factor Analyses and Aggregation Tests

To further validate the measures, we ﬁrst conducted conﬁrmatory fac-
tor (CFA) analyses in LISREL on the three substantive measures obtained
from employees, including organizational climate of concern for em-
ployees, job satisfaction, and affective commitment. We did not include
manager-rated HPWS in these analyses because they were only avail-
able at the manager- (or establishment-) level. The measurement models
examined in LISREL were based on all 12-items capturing the three

constructs. Results indicated that the hypothesized, three-factor measure-
ment model ﬁt the data well, χ 2 (df = 51) = 308.65, SRMR = .07, CFI =
.96. We also contrasted this three-factor model against more constrained
models, which set the job satisfaction and affective commitment factors
to correlate 1.0. The alternative model ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly worse than
the hypothesized model χ 2 (df = 1) = 626.36, p < .05, SRMR =
.10, CFI = .90, supporting the discriminant validity of measures obtained
from employees.

We also conducted CFA on the two establishment-level variables (i.e.,
HPWS and concern for employees’ climate). Due to the small sample size
(N = 76), we created three parcels for each scale. This two-factor model ﬁt
the data well, χ 2 (df = 9) = 63.87, SRMR = .06, CFI = .98. The ﬁt of the
model in which two factors were set to correlate at 1.0 (i.e., single-factor
model) did not ﬁt the model well, χ 2 (df = 9) = 63.87; SRMR = .17,
CFI = .58, and it ﬁt signiﬁcantly worse than the freely estimated model,
χ 2 (df = 1) = 54.29, p < .05. These results indicate that the variables
included in this study are sufﬁciently distinct from each other.

To support the aggregation of HPWS and concern for employees cli-
mate measures to the establishment level, we examined four aggregation
statistics: two interrater agreement indices (Rwg(j): James, Demaree, &
Wolf, 1984; and ADm: Burke & Dunlap, 2002; Burke, Finkelstein, &
Dusig, 1999) and two interrater reliability indices (ICC1 and ICC2: Bliese,
2000). To calculate Rwg(j), we used a uniform null distribution because we
did not expect speciﬁc response pattern, such as skewed distributions; and,
in fact, individual responses of the HPWS and climate measures ranged
from 1 to 7, and the means of these scales did not suggest much of a skew
(4.68 and 3.98 on a 7-point scale, respectively). The mean Rwg(j) was 0.97
(ranged between .69 and .99) for the 13-item HPWS scale and was 0.92
(ranged between .25 and .97) for the 6-item climate measures. The aver-
age deviation from the mean (ADM(J): Burke et al., 1999) for HPWS (for
53 units with more than 2 managerial responses) and climate (for all 76
units) scale were 0.41 and 0.54, respectively. Both values are well below
the suggested standard of c/6 (the number of response options for an item

[c] divided by six, which is 7/6 ∼= 1.17 in our case) as an upper-limit

cutoff for the AD index (Burke & Dunlap, 2002), suggesting sufﬁcient
level of agreement. In fact, only one establishment (out of 76) exceeded
this value (1.20) for climate (and none for HPWS). The ICC(1) values
for HPWS and climate were 0.22, and 0.18, respectively. The ICC(2)
values for the same set of variables were 0.55 and 0.61, respectively.
The F-tests associated with all ICC values were statistically signiﬁcant,
p < .05. Note that these values are comparable to other multilevel
studies (e.g., Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, & Rosen, 2007; Liao &
Chuang, 2004; Zohar & Luria, 2005). Thus, these statistics support the

aggregation of the variables to the establishment level, as they suggest
ratings were highly shared within establishments and reliably different
across establishments (Bliese, 2000).

Analyses Strategy

Recall that Hypothesis 1 considers the establishment-level relation-
ship between HPWS and concern for employees’ climate, whereas the
remaining hypotheses (Hypotheses 2 and 3) involve cross-level relation-
ships between constructs residing at the establishment and individual
levels of analysis. Hypothesis 1 was tested using OLS regression be-
cause it involved only establishment-level variables. Following Bliese’s
(2002) recommendations, the hypotheses involving cross-level relation-
ships were tested using random coefﬁcient model (RCM; also termed
hierarchical linear modeling) analyses with Version 3.0 of the nonlinear
and linear mixed effects (NLME) program for S-PLUS and R (Pinheiro
& Bates, 2000). RCM appropriately partitions individual-level outcomes
into within-establishment and between-establishment variance, and then
regresses the within-establishment variance on individual-level predictors
(individual-level controls in our study) and the between-establishment
variance on establishment-level predictors (establishment-level controls,
HPWS, and climate in our study). Effects of establishment-level predic-
tors on the between-establishment portion of individual outcomes reﬂect
“cross-level effects” (Bliese, 2002).

Note that, although cross-level effects model

the between-
establishment portion of the dependent variable, they are distinct from
establishment-level analyses. First, cross-level tests weight the inﬂuences
of establishment-level predictors on the outcomes by the number of re-
sponses within the unit (i.e., units with more responses are more in-
ﬂuential in the estimation; Bliese, 2002). Second, unlike establishment-
level effects, cross-level effects can partial out potential inﬂuences of
individual-level predictors on the dependent variable, which could affect
the total variance in the dependent variable and, hence, the impact of
establishment-level predictors on the outcome (cf. Chen & Bliese, 2002).
To establish cross-level mediation, we used RCM in conjunction with
recommended steps to test mediation by Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998)
(see also Chen & Bliese, 2002). According to Kenny et al., mediation is
supported when the following conditions are met: (a) the independent
variable (HPWS) predicts the dependent variables (individual attitudes),
(b) the independent variable predicts the mediator (climate), and, when
regressing the dependent variables on both the independent variable and
the mediator, (c) the mediator signiﬁcantly predicts the dependent variable,
whereas (d) the independent variable no longer predicts the dependent

variable. We also conducted the Sobel (1982) test to examine whether the
indirect effect of the independent variable (i.e., HPWS) on the dependent
variables (i.e., individual outcomes) via the mediator (i.e., climate) is
signiﬁcantly different from zero. In effect, Sobel’s test examines whether
the estimate associated with the inﬂuence of the independent variable on
the dependent variable drops signiﬁcantly once introducing the mediator.
In hypotheses tests, we controlled for industry and company dummies,
establishment size (natural log), and percentage of responses obtained at
the establishment level (i.e., Level 2), and for employee age, gender, educa-
tional level, and organizational tenure at the individual level (i.e., Level 1).
In RCM tests, we report the unstandardized parameter estimates, standard
errors, and their statistical signiﬁcance, as well as the variance explained
for by both Level-1 (individual-level) and Level-2 (establishment-level)
predictors (see Bliese, 2002). Note, however, that the variance explained
estimates are “Pseudo R2” values that can be unstable and either under-
or overestimate the true effect sizes (Snijders & Bosker, 1999). Therefore,
we also report the total R2 value for each model, obtained from cross-level
operator tests in regression (James & Williams, 2000), reﬂecting the total
variance of the dependent variable explained by the models.

Results

Table 1shows the descriptive statistics, including the means, standard
deviations, correlations, and internal consistency reliabilities for this study.
Prior to testing the hypotheses, we examined the extent to which job at-
titudes varied between establishment, as indicated by ICC(1). For job
satisfaction, ICC(1) was .08, F(75,446) = 1.62, p < .05, indicating that 8%
of the total variance in job satisfaction resided between establishments.
For affective commitment, ICC(1) was also .08, F(75,446) = 1.60, p <
.05, indicating that, for affective commitment, 8% of the total variance
resided between establishments. These results indicated there was sig-
niﬁcant establishment-level variance in both job attitudes, which means
establishment-level HPWS and concern for employees climate could ex-
plain between-establishment variance in job attitudes (Bliese, 2002).

Hypothesis 1 proposed a positive relationship between establishment-
level HPWS and concern for employees’ climate. Table 2summarizes the
ordinary least square regression tests of Hypothesis 1. As shown in Ta-
ble 2, HPWS explained 7% additional variance in concern for employees
climate over and above those explained by the set of 11 control vari-
ables included in the ﬁrst step. The parameter estimates associated with
HPWS was positive and signiﬁcant (.34, p < .05), which provides support
for Hypothesis 1. Note that support for Hypothesis 1 also meets one of

the four criteria for mediation indicated above (relationship between the
independent and mediating variables).

Hypotheses 2 and 3 posited that concern for employees’ climate
mediates the relationships of HPWS and individual job satisfaction
(Hypothesis 2) and affective commitment (Hypothesis 3). Table 3 reports
the results of RCM analyses for Hypotheses 2 and 3. In analyses of each
dependent variable, we entered control measures at a ﬁrst model and then
added HPWS at the second model and climate at the third and ﬁnal model.
Table 3 also reports Sobel’s test of the indirect effect of HPWS on each
dependent variable through climate.

In analyses of the two dependent variables, Model 2 (Table 3) showed
that HPWS was positively related to both individual job satisfaction (.23,
p < .05) and individual affective commitment (.25, p < .05). These results
established that HPWS signiﬁcantly related to each of the job attitudes,
as predicted. In addition, results from Model 3 across analyses of the de-
pendent variables showed that concern for employees climate positively
related to both job satisfaction (.50, p < .05) and affective commitment
(.75, p < .05), above and beyond HPWS. Furthermore, when introducing
concern for employees’ climate in Model 3, HPWS no longer signiﬁcantly
predicted job satisfaction (.10, ns) or affective commitment (.08, ns). In
support of Hypotheses 2 and 3, these results fully meet the criteria for
mediation set forth by Kenny et al. (1998) in that HPWS related to job
attitudes and to concern for employees climate, and the relationships

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

between HPWS and job attitudes were no longer signiﬁcant when intro-
ducing concern for employees climate.

Finally, tests of indirect effects provided additional support for Hy-
potheses 2 and 3 (see bottom row in Table 3). Results indicated that
the indirect effect of HPWS on each of the dependent variables was
signiﬁcant—indirect effect = .17 (p < .05) for job satisfaction and .26
(p < .05) for affective commitment. These results suggest that the inﬂu-
ence of HPWS on each outcome dropped signiﬁcantly once introducing
concern for employees’ climate. In sum, the results fully supported Hy-
potheses 2 and 3, as concern for employees’ climate was found to mediate
the cross-level relationships of HPWS with job satisfaction and affec-
tive commitment. It is also worth noting that HPWS accounted for 1%
to 2% of the total variance in each dependent variable (4% and 31%
of the between-establishment variances in job satisfaction and affective
commitment, respectively) over and above control variables; and, climate
explained an additional 3% to 6% of the total variance in dependent
variables (24% and 52% of the between-establishment variances in job
satisfaction and affective commitment, respectively) above and beyond
HPWS and control measures.

Auxiliary Analyses

To alleviate concerns that may be raised with this study, including the
use of small number of employee responses within establishments, po-
tential common method biases, and the potential for other mediators, we
ran additional analyses—one for each dependent variable. First, we se-
lected those establishments from which we received at least four or more
employee responses (N = 44 establishments). Second, using establish-
ments where data from four or more employees were obtained, we split
the employee sample such that data from one half was used for measuring
concern for employees climate and data from the other half for measuring
the individual-level outcomes, effectively eliminating any overlap in the
data used to measure HPWS (obtained from managers), climate (obtained
from half the employee sample), and individual outcomes (obtained from
the other half of the employee sample). Third, we included two additional
variables (human capital and quality of social exchange at the establish-
ment levels) as potential mediators to examine if, in fact, concern for
employees climate acts as important mediator on the relationship HPWS
and individual-level outcomes relative to other possible mediators that
were found to mediate between HPWS and establishment performance in
Takeuchi et al. (2007; for more information regarding these mediators and
their measurement, please refer to Takeuchi et al., 2007).


RIKI TAKEUCHI ET AL.

21

Results from all auxiliary analyses are reported in the Appendix (note
that analyses were comparable to Model 3 in Table 3, in that they in-
cluded control measures, HPWS, and concern for employees climate as
predictors). As shown in the Appendix, across all analyses, concern for
employees’ climate remained a signiﬁcant predictor of the dependent vari-
ables, whereas HPWS again did not signiﬁcantly predict the dependent
variables in the presence of concern for employees’ climate. Furthermore,
human capital did not signiﬁcantly predict any of the outcomes, and social
exchanges signiﬁcantly predicted affective commitment (.40, p < .05) but
not job satisfaction. These results strongly corroborated the results re-
ported in Table 3. Thus, it does not appear that establishments where we
sampled fewer than four employees, or that common method biases, ad-
versely affected our ﬁndings. Moreover, concern for employees’ climate
appeared to explain the relationships between HPWS and individual-level
outcomes better than alternative establishment-level mediators (human
capital and social exchanges).

Discussion

Although previous studies implied that HR systems inﬂuence em-
ployee attitude and motivation (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Delery & Shaw, 2001;
Evans & Davis, 2005), empirical examinations of this cross-level effect
has been lacking. One of the main objectives of this study was to explicate
the underlying mechanisms through which HPWS relate to employees’
job attitude. By drawing on theory and research from the strategic HRM
and organizational climate literatures, the results supported the cross-level
linkages from HPWS (establishment level) to climate (establishment level)
to employee job attitudes (individual level). Next, we discuss the impli-
cations of these ﬁndings, limitations of the present research, and avenues
for future research directed extending this work.

Implications to Theory and Practice

One of the most signiﬁcant ﬁndings of this study, which contributes
to the strategic HRM and organizational climate literatures, is the demon-
stration that shared establishment-level climate acts as an important me-
diator of the cross-level relationships between HPWS and individual job
attitudes. In addition to supporting an important tenet of prior conceptu-
alization of HPWS (i.e., the notion that such systems promote positive
employee attitudes; Huselid, 1995), our ﬁndings extend prior work on
organizational climate. In line with social information processing theory
(Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) and extending prior work on organizational
climate (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999; Burke et al., 1992; James & James,


22

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

1989), we found support for the theoretical argument that concern for
employees climate serves as conduit through which employees interpret
HR practices and, in turn, translates HR practices into employee attitude
formation. Finding the direct relationship between HPWS and concern for
employees climate also provides an important empirical support for the
assumption that climates are formed largely based on organizational prac-
tices and procedures, and redresses the paucity of research that examines
antecedents of climate (Ostroff et al., 2003).

Our results also imply that there are multiple multilevel pathways
through which HPWS beneﬁt the organization. Speciﬁcally, our auxiliary
analyses show that establishment-level human capital and social exchange
quality—which Takeuchi et al. (2007) found to mediate between HPWS
and establishment performance—were less potent mediators than con-
cern for employees climate when considering the cross-level inﬂuences
of HPWS on individual job satisfaction and affective commitment. In
essence, this illustrates the possibility of multiple mediators and more in-
tricate processes and interrelationships through which HPWS inﬂuences
outcomes that span multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual, group,
establishment, and ﬁrm levels). We also note that the “bottom-up” inﬂu-
ences of employee attitudes on ﬁrm performance are quite complex and
likely involve multiple mediators at multiple levels of analysis (Ployhart,
2004; Ostroff & Bowen, 2000). Therefore, this study exempliﬁes how
integration between micro and macro HRM can further our understanding
of how strategic HRM constructs operate and inﬂuence outcomes across
organizational levels and levels of analysis (see Wright & Boswell, 2002).
From a practical perspective, the results from this study may also be
helpful to managers who may need to justify the adoption of HPWS. For
example, managers can show that the adoption of HPWS has tangible
beneﬁts with regard to individual employee outcomes, such as increased
job satisfaction and more affective commitment. All of these outcomes can
lead to lower turnover rate for the organization and can help to reduce costs
associated with employee turnover (cf., Cascio, 2003). Our ﬁndings in
Table 3 suggest that, after taking into account the set of control measures,
HPWS accounted for between 4% (in the case of job satisfaction) and 31%
(in the case of affective commitment) additional between-establishment
variance in the individual-level reactions, as well as 1% to 2% additional
variance of the total variance in the outcomes. Although these may seem
as small effect sizes, it is important to note that the impact of HPWS
on individual-level attitudes was much greater when taking into account
concern for employees’ climate, which fully transmitted the effect of
HPWS on each individual-level outcome. Thus, the total impact of HPWS
on individual-level outcome—both direct and indirect—is noteworthy.
The key practical implication here is that improving establishments’ HRM


RIKI TAKEUCHI ET AL.

23

system does in fact translates into improved climate in which employees
perceive their organization or establishment as caring about and supporting
them, as well as more positive employee reactions. In this regard, these
ﬁndings demonstrate the utility of implementing HPWS as means of
improving a set of functional climate and employee attitudes.

Limitations and Future Research

There are certain limitations that need to be taken into account when
interpreting the ﬁndings. First, given the use of cross-sectional data,
causality cannot be inferred, although the “causal” arrows depicted in
Figure 1 are based on theoretical predictions based on theoretical logic and
prior ﬁndings from strategic HRM and organizational climate literatures
(e.g., Arthur, 1994; Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Huselid, 1995; McAllister &
Bigley, 2002; Ostroff & Bowen, 2000). Second, due to practical reasons,
we used a shortened item set for individual outcome measures. This may
raise concerns regarding the validity of the scales and associated ﬁnd-
ings. However, we have found that using shortened measures of perceived
organizational support and affective commitment did not prevent the de-
tection of meaningful substantive relationships in prior research (e.g.,
Eisenberger et al., 2001; Grifﬁn, Neal, & Parker, 2007). Thus, it did not
appear that shortening of the measures adversely affected the validity of
inferences drawn from this particular study. We encourage future studies
to replicate and extend these ﬁndings using longitudinal and experimental
or quasi-experimental designs, as well as more comprehensive measures
of the variables examined here.

Second, we conceptualized and tested HPWS as a system (e.g.,
Guthrie, 2001), rather than its subcomponents (e.g., Batt, 2002; Huselid,
1995), to illustrate the impact of an overall HRM system on concern for
employees climate and individual employee outcomes. Given that concern
for employees’ climate is conceptualized as a fairly general social con-
struct, treating HPWS also as an overall system made for better conceptual
alignment between the technical and social systems these constructs rep-
resent. However, it is possible that some subcomponents of HPWS have
differential impacts on the mediators. Future studies that extend these
ﬁndings and examine the effects of HPWS subcomponents on concern for
employees’ climate and other relevant variables of interest would be par-
ticularly valuables. We also acknowledge that some establishments may
use other HR systems to manage their workforce such as productivity,
commitment, or control oriented systems. Although our focus was solely
on the impact of HPWS on white-collar, full-time permanent employ-
ees, a useful avenue for future research would be to examine the impact
of these other, more speciﬁc HR systems on organizational climate and


24

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

employee outcomes. Future research is needed to replicate and extend this
study by conceptualizing and including additional antecedents to tease out
the exact relationships that may exist among various HRM practices and
organizational climate.

Finally, the generalizability of our ﬁndings might be limited. However,
given that the theoretical underpinning of this study is derived from West-
ern theories, the Japanese sample may also be considered the strength
of this study because we found theoretically derived relationships in a
non-Western sample. Although we expect our ﬁndings to be generalizable
to many different research settings, we would encourage future studies to
collect data from different settings and replicate and extend our ﬁndings. A
related issue is concerned about how representative the respondent estab-
lishments are to the general population and nonrespondent establishments.
Although we were able to collect multiple responses from managers and
employees from the participating establishments, we could not test for
nonrespondent bias. Thus, it is possible that the respondent establishment
somehow differed systematically from the nonrespondent ﬁrms. How-
ever, given that the percentage of responses were negatively correlated
with HPWS and job satisfaction, it is less likely that the participating es-
tablishments were necessarily those who had successfully adopted HPWS
and had higher employee outcomes.

This study highlights two additional areas for future research. First,
given that different types of organizational climate such as climate for
service (e.g., Liao & Chuang, 2004; Schneider et al., 1998), safety (e.g.,
Zohar, 2000), and empowerment (e.g., Seibert et al., 2004) can coexist
within an entity, future research can investigate if and how HPWS affect
other types of climate (in addition to global climate) and whether or not
different types of climates affect variables that reside at different levels
in a similar manner. We also encourage researchers to consider other
theoretical perspectives and mechanisms linking HPWS to outcomes,
such as team conﬂict, team empowerment, and individual empowerment
and role clarity. Second, we can learn more about the individual- and
establishment-level factors that act as moderators of the relationship be-
tween HPWS and organizational climate, and organizational climate and
individual outcomes. For example, concern for employees climate may be-
come less related to individual-level outcomes if HPWS are implemented
more variably to employees and different employment groups within the
organization (e.g., Lepak & Snell, 2002). In addition, we encourage addi-
tional research that examines the inﬂuence of personal characteristics in
the future.

In sum, this study contributes to the strategic HRM literature by il-
lustrating the cross-level linkages among HPWS, concern for employ-
ees’ climate, and employee outcomes (job satisfaction and affective

25

commitment). These results also provide insights into the differences
between a technical system (i.e., HPWS) and a social system (organi-
zational climate) and how the inﬂuence of a technical system translates
into the social system, which ultimately inﬂuences the employees oper-
ating within the technical and social systems. We hope this research will
stimulate much needed additional work on the social and multilevel mech-
anisms through which HPWS and other strategic HRM concepts impact
important outcomes in and of organizations.
