ABSTRACT 

One employee creativity model, the componential model, has emphasized 

the importance of three major personal attributes: intrinsic motivation, domain-

relevant skills, and creativity-relevant processes (Amabile, 1988).  Another model, the 

interactionist model, has emphasized the importance of environmental, personal, and 

contextual variables working in tandem to influence creativity (Woodman et al., 

1993).  The current study is the first to integrate the major tenets of both of these 

employee creativity models.  In a series of hypotheses, I predicted that elements of the 

work environment (organizational and supervisory encouragement, coworker support, 

job-required creativity, autonomy, training and resource availability, and job 

demands) interacted with employees’ personal attributes to influence creativity, and 

that these relationships would be mediated by intrinsic motivation and domain-

relevant skills.   

The current study was performed by collecting survey data from 

employees and their supervisors.  Three separate organizational samples were 

combined into one larger sample.  In order to control for potential group effects, I used 

hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze my data (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).   

Results of the current study do not support the integration of the two 

models of creativity.  None of the personal components had a main effect on 

creativity.  Therefore, hypotheses pertaining to mediation by intrinsic motivation and 

domain-relevant skills were not tested. 

 xii


There was, however an interaction observed between intrinsic motivation 

and domain-relevant skills.  Intrinsic motivation only had a positive relation with 

creativity when domain-relevant skills were high.   

Regarding the predictions for work environment effects on creativity, two 

significant effects were found.  However, none of the predicted person-by-situation 

interactions were observed.  The presence of high levels of job demands was 

marginally negatively related to creativity.  There was also an interaction between job-

required creativity and creativity-relevant processes.  Contrary to prediction, the shape 

of the results suggested that job-required creativity was most related to creativity 

among those low in creativity-relevant processes.   

A major contribution of the present study was the use of HLM 

methodology for testing hypotheses involving supervisor ratings of creativity.  The 

study’s analyses show that supervisor creativity ratings do vary as a function of the 

group whose members are being rated.

Chapter 1 

INTRODUCTION 

Employee creativity, the generation of novel and useful ideas, procedures, 

and products (Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993), is widely viewed as an important 

precursor for organizational innovation and productivity (Amabile, 1988).  Although 

research on organizational creativity has a relatively short history, the findings thus far 

corroborate its importance for successful organizational functioning.  Oldham and 

Cummings (1996) found supervisor-rated creativity to be positively related to the 

number of patent disclosures filed by manufacturing employees (r=.23).  Similarly, 

employee innovative behavior was positively related to the number of invention 

disclosures filed (r=.33; Scott & Bruce, 1994).  Real estate agents’ creativity was 

marginally related to the number of units sold (r=.16, p=.06; Wang & Netemeyer, 

2004).  Additionally, the creativity of academic scholars’ work (as rated by journal 

editors) mediated the positive relation between the number of works published in 

premier journals and scholarly reputation (Dewett & Denisi, 2004).  This evidence 

suggests that creativity is related to a number of positive outcomes for organizations in 

very different sectors.  It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that 

could potentially lead to or encourage creative behavior in the workplace. 

Models of Employee Creativity 

Research on creativity in organizations has flowed mainly through two 

theoretical perspectives: the componential model and the interactionist model.  The 

 1


componential model of organizational creativity proposes that individual creativity 

increases due to concurrent increases in intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills 

and knowledge, and creativity relevant skills and processes (Amabile, 1988, 1996).  

The work environment serves to enhance employee creativity through incremental 

increases in these three major components (see Figure 1).  Intrinsic motivation arises 

from a “positive reaction to qualities of the task itself” (Amabile, 1996, p. 115).  Thus, 

an intrinsically-motivated employee would be interested in and enjoy his/her work due 

to the qualities inherent in the work he/she performs.  Domain-relevant skills refer to 

one’s expertise and knowledge in a specific field.  At work, one’s domain-relevant 

knowledge may be reflected though such variables as self-efficacy for one’s job tasks 

and the clear understanding of one’s goals and processes at work.  Domain-relevant 

skills at work would be influenced by the availability of training, resources, and 

information (Amabile, 1988; Sawyer, 1992).  Creativity-relevant skills and processes 

refer to one’s abilities (both innate and developed) to generate creative ideas and to 

recognize, explore, and solve problems creatively.  Examples of creativity relevant 

processes include involvement in prior creative experiences (including creativity 

training), personality characteristics related to creativity (e.g.., openness to experience; 

Costa & McCrae, 1992), and a cognitive style involving creative thought processes.  

To date most research addressing the componential model has focused on intrinsic 

motivation as a precursor to employee creativity (see bold arrows in Figure 1).  This 

research has approached creativity from the perspective of cognitive evaluation 

theory, which suggests that environments contain both informational and controlling 

aspects (Deci & Ryan, 1985).  Informational characteristics promote and controlling 

aspects inhibit motivation, and subsequently creativity.  Researchers exploring the 

 2


tenets of the componential model have examined several contextual aspects of the 

work environment that have been proposed to influence employee motivation and 

creativity.  These contextual influences include organizational and supervisory 

encouragement, work group support of creativity, job autonomy, sufficiency of 

resources, and workload demands (Amabile et al., 1996) 

Like the componential model, the interactionist model of employee 

creativity also supports the notion that an employee’s environment and personal 

dispositions can greatly impact his/her creativity.  However, the interactionist model 

goes beyond this simple assertion by claiming that the effects are interactional 

(Woodman et al., 1993).  Creativity is a function of a variety of individual, group, and 

organizational characteristics all working in tandem to enhance or to inhibit each other 

(see Figure 2).  For example, the encouragement to be creative by one’s organization 

and supervisor may motivate creativity, but only to the extent that one has creative 

inclinations (creativity relevant processes).  Creative individuals may respond 

enthusiastically to the challenge of being creative on the job.  However, those who are 

not naturally inclined to be creative may find the encouragement of creativity to be 

stressful.  Thus one’s contextual environment and personal dispositions at work would 

serve to enhance or diminish each other’s influence on creative performance. 

Present Research Goals 

It is the purpose of this paper to integrate the research predictions of both 

the componential and interactionist models of creativity in the workplace.  To date, the 

research examining creativity from each perspective has failed to integrate the 

important tenets of the other perspective.  For example, while the majority of work 

 3


invoking the componential model suggests the role of intrinsic job motivation as a 

mediator, researchers invoking the interactionist model rarely consider this proposed 

mediation and, when such an effect is considered, motivation is used as an explanation 

but is not operationalized or measured.   

In the sections that follow, I will develop and propose hypotheses based 

on the tenets of both major theories of employee creativity.  These hypotheses will 

then be tested using data gathered from three organizations.

Chapter 2 

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 

Intrinsic Motivation 

The componential model of creativity suggests that intrinsic job 

motivation, job-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant skills should all impact an 

employee’s creativity at work.  Most of the evidence exploring the predictions of the 

componential model have focused on the main effects and mediating role of intrinsic 

motivation.  Those employees experiencing a high level of motivation would be more 

interested in their jobs and would find their work more enjoyable (Amabile, 1983; 

Shalley, 1991).  Consequently, intrinsically motivated employees would be more 

likely to explore new ideas, take risks, and exhibit creative performance than their 

less-motivated counterparts.  Prior studies have shown the importance of intrinsic 

motivation in predicting creativity in both work and non-work domains.  For example, 

intrinsic motivation has been linked to creativity on artistic tasks (Amabile, 1979).  

Laboratory inducement of intrinsic motivation has also led writers to produce more 

creative work compared to writers subjected to an external motivational inducement 

(Amabile, 1985).  In addition, an interview study examining the determinants of 

creativity, R & D scientists mentioned intrinsic motivation more often than any other 

potential determinant of creativity (Amabile, 1988).   

Despite its centrality to the predictions of the componential model of 

employee creativity, intrinsic motivation is rarely empirically assessed (for exceptions, 

 5


see Aselage, 2005; Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001; Shin & Zhou, 2003; Tierney et al., 

1999).  Although it is rarely assessed, researchers still recognize the potential 

importance of intrinsic motivation to the creative process, often calling upon 

motivation as the mechanism through which their empirical results were attained (e.g., 

Oldham & Cummings, 1996).  In the present study, I take a step in bridging the gap in 

the literature left by the infrequent assessment of intrinsic motivation.  First, based on 

theory and past research findings, I predict that intrinsic motivation is positively 

related to employee creativity.  Second, I examine the potential mediating role of 

intrinsic motivation between work environment predictors and employee creativity. 

Domain-Relevant Skills 

The major focus of researchers examining the componential model of 

creativity has been the motivational component because researchers have assumed that 

domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes are more stable, and would be 

less influenced by the environment.  However, this may not be the case.  In general, 

domain-relevant skills in an organizational environment refer to one’s knowledge of 

one’s job and one’s ability to perform the necessary tasks.  One variable particularly 

relevant to the assessment of one’s on-the-job skills and abilities is job self-efficacy, 

involving one’s confidence in and perceived mastery of one’s job.  Self-efficacy 

beliefs may directly impact one’s performance of a range of behaviors (Bandura 

1977).  Specifically, Bandura (1997) described self-efficacy in a particular domain as 

being a required precursor to one’s generation of creative ideas and products in that 

domain.  In general, one must be able to perform the general functions of one’s job 

before one could possibly be creative at work.  The confidence in one’s ability 

connoted by a strong job self-efficacy would empower one potentially to look beyond 

 6


the status quo of job performance to more creative domains (Tierney & Farmer, 2002).  

Job-relevant skills may also be represented by goal and process clarity, one’s certainty 

about one’s objectives at work and the proper ways to attain them (Sawyer, 1992).  

Strong clarity regarding one’s goals and processes at work would encourage one to 

search out the best and most creative ways to approach and accomplish tasks. 

Creativity-Relevant Processes 

A recent line of research has also begun to explore the role of creativity-

relevant processes, such as creative self-efficacy, creative cognitive style, and 

openness to experience on creativity (Scott & Bruce, 1994; Tierney, 1997).  Creative 

self-efficacy refers to one’s belief that one has the ability to produce creative 

outcomes (Tierney & Farmer, 2002).  Creative self-efficacy would lead individuals to 

feel more confident to take creative risks and to search out creative ways to 

accomplish tasks.  Accordingly, creative self-efficacy has been shown to be related to 

employee creativity (Tierney & Farmer, 2002, 2004).  Additionally, an employee’s 

cognitive style may relate to creativity (Scott & Bruce, 1994).  A cognitive style 

involves an individual’s mental method of gathering and evaluating information from 

the environment.  It can affect how individuals search the environment for information 

and how they integrate new information into their existing cognitive models (Hayes & 

Allinson, 1998).  Individuals with more innovative and creative cognitive styles would 

enjoy approaching tasks in different, original, and undisciplined ways (Kirton, 1976; 

Miron et al., 2004).  Creative thinkers would have a strong preference for thinking 

originally and coming up with new ideas.  Thus, employees with creative cognitive 

styles would be more likely to be creative at work (Miron et al., 2004).  Personality 

may also play a key role in bolstering employees’ creativity-relevant processes.  

 7


Specifically, an employee’s openness to experience, involving a tendency to search for 

and enjoy new and varied experiences, would encourage creative exploration and idea 

generation (Costa & McCrae, 1992).  In a recent meta-analysis, openness to 

experience showed the strongest relation to creativity among artists and scientists of 

any of the Five-Factor personality traits (Feist, 1998).  Furthermore, a number of 

studies have found links between openness to experience and employee creativity 

(e.g., George & Zhou, 2001; Williams, 2004). 

A Componential Interaction 

In the spirit of the interactionist model, I propose that the effects of the 

three proposed dispositional antecedents of creativity are interactive.  Specifically, the 

relations of intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills with creativity would be 

enhanced by an employee’s level of creativity relevant processes.  Amabile (1988) has 

suggested that creativity may be most influenced when creativity-relevant skills build 

upon a motivational foundation and domain-relevant skills.  Thus, motivation would 

only inspire creativity to the extent that individuals felt they possessed the ability to be 

creative.  In addition, knowledge, skill, and clarity on the job would yield creativity 

only to the extent that individuals also possessed skills in the creative arena.  The 

latter proposal is supported by Tierney and Farmer (2002) who found that among 

manufacturing employees, creativity was highest when both job self-efficacy and 

creative self-efficacy were high.  Thus creative skills seem to be a necessary skill for 

creativity insofar as they build on other skills and motivation in a given domain.  

Additionally, creativity should be enhanced when one’s motivation at work is 

complemented by the necessary domain-relevant skills.  The motivational component 

 8


will inspire one to explore the work environment and to apply domain-relevant 

knowledge in new and innovative ways (Amabile, 1988).   

Drawing one step further, the most creative individual will possess high 

levels of motivation, domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes.  In other 

words, I predict a 3-way interaction between the components, such that the positive 

relation between intrinsic motivation and creativity will be strongest when employees 

also possess high levels of both domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant 

processes. 

 The following hypotheses test the assertions put forth in the previous 

paragraphs: 
 

H1a: Intrinsic job motivation is positively related to employee creativity. 

H1b: Domain-relevant skills (job self-efficacy, goal and process clarity) are positively 

related to employee creativity. 

H1c: Creativity-relevant processes (creative self-efficacy, creative cognitive style, and 

openness to experience) are positively related to employee creativity. 

H1d: The relations proposed in H1a and H1b are stronger when employees possess 

high levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H1e: The relation proposed in H1a is stronger when employees possess high levels of 

domain-relevant skills. 

H1f: Motivation will be most strongly related to creativity when both domain-relevant 

skills and creativity-relevant processes are high. 

 9


Integrating the Models 

The componential model proposes that elements of the work environment 

(including encouragement of creativity, autonomy, availability of training, resources 

and feedback, and low levels of workload pressure) affect creativity indirectly through 

incremental enhancements in intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, and 

creativity-relevant processes.  However, there has yet to be an empirical examination 

of the potential effect of person-by-situation interactions on the components and 

subsequent creativity.  I propose to address this gap in the literature.   

One organizational perspective that I will use to help integrate the 

componential and interactionist models is the person-environment (P-E) fit 

perspective.  For years researchers have expressed the potential benefits of examining 

behavior as a result of an interaction between a person and an environment (Murray, 

1938).  The P-E fit perspective proposes that individuals are more motivated in 

situations where environmental demands and supplies match the individuals’ personal 

attributes (Livingstone et al., 1997).  Applied to the work organization, the P-E fit 

perspective would suggest that employees will be most motivated under contextual 

circumstances when their abilities meet the demands of the job (demand-ability fit) 

and when their motives match supplies in the environment for those motives (supply-

value fit; Livingstone et al., 1997).  The resulting motivation would inspire employee 

creativity (Amabile, 1988).   

See Figure 3 for this paper’s working model.  As a note, in the present 

research, I view creativity-relevant processes as playing their most important roles as 

moderators of situational antecedents of the other components.  Thus, while it is 

conceivable, and probable, that the work environment can affect one’s creativity-

relevant processes (see Tierney & Farmer, 2004), this line of research is beyond the 

 10


scope of the current project.  In the following sections, I describe the research 

supporting links between work environment variables and intrinsic motivation, 

domain-relevant skills, and creativity.  Additionally, based on the interactionist model, 

I propose person-by-situation interactions that could potentially enhance the proposed 

relations. 

Encouragement and Support 

In addition to emphasizing the importance of the individual components 

of creativity, the componential and interactionist models also suggests that motivation, 

and in turn, creativity should be enhanced by influences in the work environment 

including organizational, supervisory, and coworker encouragement of creativity 

(Amabile et al., 1996).  Researchers have suggested that an orientation toward 

creativity and support for idea generation are important characteristics of innovative 

organizations (Kanter, 1983; Scott & Bruce, 1994).  Organizational encouragement 

could include such actions as the organization supporting policies that emphasize the 

importance of creative work and that openly express a value for creativity.  Research 

shows that employees pay attention to top management’s actions and opinions to 

ascertain how management would respond to various types of risk-taking (Ashford et 

al., 1998).  Additionally, Scott and Bruce (1994) reported that a work climate 

supportive of new ideas and efforts for positive change resulted in employee 

engagement in innovative and creative efforts.  One way of showing encouragement 

of creativity is through offering explicit rewards for creativity and high levels of 

performance.  In the literature on organizational creativity, the importance of 

organizational rewards has been a hotly debated topic.  Some researchers emphasize 

the potentially negative impact of rewards on intrinsic motivation and creativity 

 11


(Amabile, 1988; Deci & Ryan, 1985), whereas other researchers have emphasized the 

potentially positive impact of rewards (Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001).  The effect of 

competence-inducing organizational rewards on intrinsic motivation and creativity is 

supported by the tenets of Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET; Deci & Ryan, 1985).  

According to CET, intrinsic motivation should be enhanced in contexts that emphasize 

one’s competence.  However, intrinsic motivation should be constrained in situations 

where the context emphasizes one’s lack of control over one’s environment and 

outcomes.  For example, several contextual constraints have been found to reduce 

intrinsic motivation on a variety of tasks, including: the presence of competition 

(Amabile, 1982), surveillance (Amabile, Goldfarb, & Brackfield, 1990), and expected 

evaluation (Hennessey, 1989).  In these situations, individuals are likely to attribute 

their task performance to the contextual constraints rather than their internal drive.  In 

contrast, rewards offered in a way that provide information and promote competence 

may inspire employees to perform creatively (Deci & Ryan, 1985).   

Another way for organizations to promote creativity is through direct 

organizational support of creative endeavors.  Organizational support has been shown 

to increase positive and decrease negative discretionary performance (Eder & 

Eisenberger, 2007; Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002).  When support is directly aimed at 

creativity, positive discretionary employee efforts in creative endeavors would be 

expected. 

In the current study, I examine the contribution of organizational 

encouragement of creativity through both the direct support of creative ideas and 

offering rewards for creativity.  It is expected that organizational encouragement of 

 12


creative exploration and idea generation will inspire intrinsic motivation in 

employees, and subsequently creativity. 

From a demand-ability fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 1997), an 

individual who has creative abilities and skills may thrive in and enjoy an 

organizational environment emphasizing creativity as a desired outcome.  Thus, 

individuals high in creativity-relevant processes may experience higher levels of 

motivation and creativity in response to organizational encouragement of creativity.   

 

H2a: Organizational encouragement of creativity will be positively related to intrinsic 

motivation and employee creativity. 

H2b: The positive relations described in H2a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H2c:  The interaction effect of organizational encouragement and creativity-relevant 

processes on creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

 

Supervisory encouragement of creativity would stimulate creativity in a 

similar manner to organizational encouragement.  The componential model suggests 

that supervisor behavior would affect creativity via its influence on intrinsic 

motivation (Amabile, 1988; Zhou, 2003).  Specifically, when supervisors are 

supportive of employees and encourage creative pursuits, employees would be less 

likely to fear supervisory retaliation for creative risk-taking that may result in lowered 

intrinsic interest (Amabile et al., 1996).  A sub-dimension of encouragement that has 

been of particular interest to creativity researchers is whether supervisors overtly 

expect creativity from their subordinates (referred to as the Pygmalion effect; Tierney 

 13


& Farmer, 2004).  Several researchers have found that specific supervisory 

expectations for creativity encourage such activities in their subordinates (Scott & 

Bruce, 1994; Tierney & Farmer, 2004).  Tierney and Farmer suggest that through a 

Pygmalion process, the mere expectation of behaving a certain way may lead 

supervisors to act in supportive ways that encourage creativity in their subordinates.  

Other supportive actions that supervisors can take to affect motivation and creativity 

include providing feedback and recognizing good performance (e.g., Betterncourt, 

2004).  Receiving useful and positive feedback from one’s supervisor would provide 

information as to one’s level of current competence as well as areas where one needs 

to improve.  Such feedback would enhance one’s job competence.  Environmental 

factors that promote competence have been described as the primary contributors to 

one’s intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985).  Supervisory support and 

encouragement of creativity would likely encourage employee motivation and 

subsequent creativity because it would fuel employees’ interest in searching out new 

and more effective ways of performing their jobs.   

From a demand-ability fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 1997), 

supportive supervision would serve to motivate an individual who has creative 

abilities and skills.  When supervisors support and encourage creative pursuits, it 

sends a signal to employees high in creativity-relevant processes that they are valued 

organizational members.  Thus, individuals high in creativity-relevant processes 

would experience higher levels of motivation and creativity in response to supervisory 

support and creativity expectations. 

 

 14


H3a: Supervisor encouragement of creativity will be positively related to intrinsic 

motivation and employee creativity. 

H3b: The positive relations described in H3a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H3c:  The interaction effect of supervisor encouragement and creativity-relevant 

processes on creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

 

I will also examine how the behavior of one’s coworkers support 

individual creative efforts.  It is becoming more common in organizations for idea 

generation to be a group process, rather than a solitary activity.  However, most of the 

research on group creativity supports has examined outcomes at the group level.  The 

evidence from the literature on group creativity suggests that the presence of support 

from one’s coworkers leads one’s group to be more creative (Amabile et al., 1996; 

Anderson & West, 1998).  Similarly, the presence of creative co-workers may 

positively impact one’s own level of creativity (Shalley & Perry-Smith, 2001).  

Nonetheless, conflicting evidence exists for this assertion (Scott & Bruce, 1994).  One 

reason for this conflicting evidence may be that this previous study did not use more 

appropriate methods (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling; HLM) to examine the data.  I 

propose that examining group influence when simultaneously accounting for group 

variability through HLM (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) will show more accurately the 

potential effect of group creativity supports on individual intrinsic interest and 

subsequent employee creativity. 

The interactionist perspective suggests that co-worker support may 

motivate creativity more in some individuals than in others.  As with organizational 

 15


and supervisory encouragement, a demand-ability fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 

1997) suggests that an individual who has more creative abilities and skills may thrive 

in and enjoy a work group that supports creativity to a greater degree than individuals 

low in creativity-relevant processes.  Thus, work group support may be more strongly 

related to creativity among individuals high in creativity-relevant processes. 

 

H4a: Work group support of creativity will be positively related to intrinsic motivation 

and employee creativity. 

H4b: The positive relations described in H4a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H4c:  The interaction effect of work group support and creativity-relevant processes 

on creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

 

Another line of research suggests that one’s perception of the level of 

creativity inherent in one’s job would ultimately affect creative performance 

(Unsworth et al., 2005).  Meta-analytic evidence suggests that the requirement of 

creativity on one’s job may play a major role in strengthening the relations between 

contextual variables and employee creativity (Eder & Sawyer, 2007).  Thus, along 

with overt encouragement, the creative requirement intrinsic to one’s job may also 

encourage creativity.  Likely, jobs that have a creative-requirement would allow 

employees more flexibility and autonomy at work, which would act to enhance 

employees’ motivation to improve their performance in creative ways (Amabile et al., 

1996). 

 16


Creative job requirement may motivate creativity more in some 

individuals than in others depending on their inherent dispositions.  The demand-

ability fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 1997) suggests that individuals high in 

creativity-relevant skills may excel in and be interested in a work environment 

emphasizing creativity more than an individual low in creativity-relevant processes.  

Thus, individuals high in creativity-relevant processes may experience higher levels of 

motivation and creativity in response to job-level requirements of creativity.   

 

H5a: Job-required creativity will be positively related to intrinsic motivation and 

employee creativity. 

H5b:  The positive relations described in H5a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H5c:  The interaction effect of job-required creativity and creativity-relevant 

processes on creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

Autonomy 

One job characteristic that has been consistently associated with intrinsic 

motivation and creativity is autonomy in one’s job (Amabile, 1988; Aselage, 2005; 

Deci & Ryan, 1985; Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001).  Evidently, when employees feel 

free to determine their own course of action at work, they feel more interest in and 

enjoyment of their jobs.  Aselage (2005) showed among employed alumni that job 

autonomy was related to employee creativity, as mediated by intrinsic motivation.  

Oldham and Cummings (1996) investigated how both autonomy as an indicator of job 

complexity and autonomy as represented by non-controlling supervision influenced 

creativity.  These researchers found creativity to be highest when both job complexity 

 17


and non-controlling supervision were high and employees possessed creative 

personalities.   

  The interactionist model would suggest that autonomy in and of itself is 

not a sufficient condition for intrinsic motivation.  Rather, based on the supply-value 

fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 1997), a certain type of employee may enjoy and 

benefit from autonomy to a greater extent.  Employees who possess high levels of 

creativity-relevant processes (creative self-efficacy, creative cognitive style, and 

openness to experience) would be particularly enamored of opportunities for 

autonomy (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Oldham & Cummings, 1996).  Individuals high in 

creativity-relevant processes would be more likely to enjoy and to take advantage of 

the opportunities for exploration and self-prescribed action presented by an 

autonomous job.  Thus, the individuals high in creativity-relevant processes would 

more likely become motivated and creative in response to job autonomy.   

 

H6a: Autonomy will be positively related to intrinsic motivation and employee 

creativity. 

H6b:  The positive relations described in H6a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of creativity-relevant processes. 

H6c:  The interaction effect of job autonomy and creativity-relevant processes on 

creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

Availability of Training, Resources, and Information 

Adequate supplies, resources, and equipment have also been suggested as 

critical for creativity and innovation (Amabile, 1988; Scott & Bruce, 1994).  The 

influence of resources, training, and information on creativity may be mediated by 

 18


intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills.  Having the information, resources, 

and training one needs would lead one to possess necessary domain-relevant skills and 

would also be associated with a corresponding motivation for one’s job (Amabile et 

al., 1996, Deci & Ryan, 1985).  Specifically, when an organization fails to allocate the 

necessary resources to one’s task, the organization communicates to an employee that 

one’s tasks are not important and influences one’s beliefs regarding the intrinsic value 

of one’s work (Amabile et al., 1996).  In addition, training and resource availability 

would promote employee competence, a key predictor of intrinsic motivation (Deci & 

Ryan, 1985). 

Resource and information availability have been shown to be positively 

related to process and goal clarity at work, two indicators of employees’ domain-

relevant skills (Sawyer, 1992).  Thus, having the proper information, resources, and 

training would lead employees to be more certain about their objectives and courses of 

action at work and to be more motivated in their work, both of which, in turn, would 

lead to creative efforts by employees.   

The interactionist perspective suggests that the presence of needed 

resources, training, and information is not sufficient for leading to intrinsic 

motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity.  Some employees may be more 

inclined to benefit based on their personalities.  A personality variable potentially 

relevant to the development of competence at work is conscientiousness.  

Conscientiousness refers to one’s studiousness, attention to detail, preparedness, 

organization, and impulse control (Costa & McCrae, 1992).  Of the Big Five 

personality dimensions, conscientiousness shows the strongest and most consistent 

relation to overall job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991).  However, the relation 

 19


between conscientiousness and creativity may be more complex.  Due to the 

conflicting nature of a conscientious employee’s orderly and conformist 

characteristics with the risk and playfulness associated with creative performance, 

conscientiousness has been suggested to be negatively related to creativity (Costa & 

McCrae, 1992; George & Zhou, 2001).  Conscientious employees may perform higher 

at rote activities but be less inclined creatively.  In the limited literature examining this 

relation, conscientiousness has been shown to be negatively related to creativity under 

conditions of high supervisory monitoring and negative work group relations (George 

& Zhou, 2001).  However, meta-analytic results show no main effect of 

conscientiousness on employee creativity (Eder & Sawyer, 2007).  Furthermore, 

George & Zhou’s (2001) results actually suggest that in the absence of negative 

coworker influences, supervisory guidance may lead conscientiousness to be 

positively related to creativity.  Thus, a highly conscientious employee, who 

studiously applies his/her training and resources to appropriate tasks will likely benefit 

more from the availability of needed resources, training and information than a non-

conscientious employee.  The availability of needed resources, training, and 

information would complement a conscientious employee’s natural propensity to seek 

competence.  Thus, availability of resources, training, and feedback may be most 

strongly related to domain-relevant skills and intrinsic motivation, and subsequently 

creativity among highly conscientious employees. 

 

H7a: Then availability of resources, training, and information will be positively 

related to intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills and employee creativity. 

 20


H7b:  The positive relations described in H7a are stronger when employees possess 

high versus low levels of conscientiousness. 

H7c:  The interaction effect of the availability of resources, training, and information, 

and creativity-relevant processes on creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation and 

domain-relevant skills. 

Workload Demands 

Workload demands, such as time pressure, have been shown to be 

positively related, unrelated, negatively related, and curvilinearly related to creative 

behaviors at work (Amabile et al., 1996, 2002; Andrews & Farris, 1972; Janssen, 

2000, 2001).  Despite this disparity in results, the componential model suggests that 

the true relation may be negative, with increased pressure and demands on one’s job 

being negatively related to intrinsic motivation and creativity.   Amabile and 

colleagues (1996) suggested the disparity in results may be a by-product of 

researchers’ failure to distinguish between workload demands and job challenge.  

Whereas challenge may act to fuel one’s motivation by providing competence-relevant 

information, excessive work demands would inhibit one’s motivation and creativity by 

decreasing the time necessary for proper exploration for alternatives on the job.  For 

example, laboratory research has shown that the presence of necessary time to carry 

out tasks directly correlates with creativity on the tasks (Parnes, 1961).  In the current 

research, I examine the negative aspect of pressure involving excessive workload and 

time pressure demands.  Such demands are expected to undermine motivation and 

subsequent creativity.   

  Based on the supply-value fit perspective (Livingstone et al., 1997), I 

expect the relation described above to be moderated by one’s need for achievement 

 21


(NAch).  NAch refers to an individual’s natural propensity to be motivated by 

challenge and hard work, and to evaluate the self based on the successful application 

of skills and talents (Atkinson, 1964; McClelland, 1961, 1987).  Because those high in 

NAch welcome challenge and enjoy opportunities to prove their value, I expect the 

negative relation between workload demands and motivation (and creativity) to be 

reduced among those high in NAch.    

 

H8a: The degree of workload demands will be negatively related to intrinsic 

motivation and employee creativity. 

H8b:  The negative relations described in H8a are stronger when employees possess 

low versus high levels of need for achievement. 

H8c:  The interaction effect of workload demands and need for achievement on 

creativity is mediated by intrinsic motivation. 

Summary 

This research will help answer questions regarding how and when 

employees will be creative, depending on their dispositions and the work environment.  

It combines two major perspectives on creativity, the componential and interactionist 

models, that have not, as of yet, been examined in tandem.  The results of this work 

will expand our current understanding of the influence that various contextual and 

dispositional variables have on motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creative 

performance.  Additionally, this work will examine motivation and domain-relevant 

skills as mediators in the relation between person-by-situation interactions and 

creativity.  Overall, this research makes five unique contributions to the literature.  

First, it is the first study to implement a large scale examination of multiple 

 22


interactional predictors of both intrinsic motivation and creativity.  Second, it is the 

first study to examine all three of the componential model’s predicted components of 

creativity (intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant 

processes) simultaneously in an organizational sample.  Further, I examine the 

interactive potential of the three components as proposed by Amabile (1988).  Third, 

as will be discussed in the following section, my methodology involves attaining data 

from three large samples of employees in very different sectors (manufacturing, 

finance, and health care).  Thus, the results obtained will be potentially relevant and 

generalizable to a number of organizations and situations.  Fourth, it is the first study 

to combine the tenets of both the interactionist and componential models to examine 

the influence of work environment and personality on creativity, as mediated by both 

intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills.  Finally, the methodology described in 

the upcoming sections (involving the use of hierarchical linear modeling) is an 

advance over the methods employed by prior research.  The methodology in the 

current study will allow for the examination of antecedents on employee creativity, 

while partialing out the variance due to differences in work groups.

Chapter 3 

METHODS 

Data were collected from three separate organizations.  The first consisted 

of production workers from a frozen seafood manufacturing plant.  The second group 

of employees contained loan officers and administrative staff of a small mortgage 

lending firm.  The third consisted of the staff of a continuing care retirement 

community. 

Organization 1: Frozen Seafood Manufacturing Plant 

All members of the production staff of a frozen seafood manufacturing 

plant in the Mid-Atlantic were offered the opportunity to participate in a survey that 

would assess their attitudes and work environment.  Individuals completed the survey 

in a large on-site conference room with the rest of the employees who shared their 

shift.  The exceptions were the 8 members of the overnight maintenance staff.  They 

were given the survey packet by the human resources executive, who mailed the 

surveys to me.  Participants received an instruction sheet and a survey.  The 

instruction sheet informed them that the survey was anonymous and voluntary, and 

that upper management would only receive information about group opinions.  

Participants were also instructed verbally as to the voluntary nature of the task.  After 

completing the survey, it was returned to me in person.  Every employee’s supervisor 

was contacted to provide a performance evaluation of the employee.  Demographic 

 27


information and employee data (i.e., date of hire) were obtained from company 

records. 

Of the 179 eligible employees, 161 returned survey packets for a return 

rate of 90%.  There were no significant differences in gender, race, or tenure for those 

who returned surveys versus those who did not.  The sample of respondents was 

comprised of 31% females.  The racial breakdown was: 90% black, 9% white, and 1% 

Hispanic.  The average organizational tenure of participants was 3.7 years (SD = 3.1).  

Sixty-two percent of workers were production line workers, 23% worked as 

warehouse packers, shippers, and unpackers, and 16% performed other tasks such as 

maintenance and quality assurance. 

 

Organization 2: Mortgage Lending Firm 

All employees of a small mortgage lending firm in the Mid-Atlantic were 

offered the chance to participate in the survey.  As with the previous organization, 

employees completed surveys in a large on-site conference room, and received verbal 

and written assurance of confidentiality and the voluntary nature of the survey.  

Employee supervisors were asked to provide evaluations of all employees. 

Of the 125 employees of the organization at the time of the survey, 103 

returned survey packets, for a return rate of 82%.  There were no significant 

differences between respondents and non-respondents in gender, race, or age.  

However, respondents had greater organizational tenure t(123) = 2.17, p < .05.  Also, 
a greater proportion of administrative staff participated than loan officers, χ2 (1) = 
10.10, p < .01.  As a note, these differences may have resulted because a number of 

those who did not show up were loan officers who had been hired within the previous 

 28


month.  Forty-five percent of respondents were female.  The racial breakdown was: 

40% black, 59% white, and 1% Hispanic.  The average age of participants was 33.6 

(SD = 10.1).  Participants had been employed by the organization an average of 2.5 

years (SD = 2.4).  Sixty percent of respondents were loan officers and 40% were 

administrative staff. 

Organization 3: Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) 

 

All employees of a CCRC in the Mid-Atlantic region were informed that 

they had the opportunity to participate in an opinion survey.  The procedures mirrored 

those at the previous 2 organizations. 

Of the 240 regular employees (not on-call) at the CCRC, 71 returned 

questionnaires, for a response rate of 30%.  This rate was negatively affected because 

a large portion of part time employees were not working on the day of data collection, 

yielding only a 13% return rate (10 out of 78) among part-timers.  There was no 

significant difference between respondents and non-respondents in age.  However, 
there were significant differences in respondents versus non-respondents in gender ( χ2 
(1) = 3.89, p < .05), race (χ2 (1) = 7.79, p < .05), and tenure t(238) = 2.85, p < .01.  A 
larger proportion of female and white employees responded, and those who responded 

had worked for the organization significantly longer.  The demographic differences 

may have occurred in part because males and blacks were more highly represented 

among part-time employees than among full-time employees.  Overall, 77% of 

respondents were female.  The racial breakdown was: 39% black and 61% white.  The 

average age of participants was 45.6 (SD = 14.1).  Participants had been employed by 

the organization an average of 10.4 years (SD = 9.7).   
 

 29


 

Overall Sample. 

None of the samples in and of themselves were large enough to test the 

desired effects with enough power in a hierarchical linear model.  Therefore, even 

though the samples were attained from divergent industries, I combined them for the 

testing of hypotheses.  Nonetheless, the HLM method employed in my analyses 

allowed for the partialing out of variance attributed to the organization in which the 

work group was located prior to examining individual level results.  Thus, any 

influence stemming from the presence of multiple organizations was minimized.  The 

overall sample across the three organizations consisted of 335 out of the possible 544 

employees, for a response rate of 62%.  Of these employees, 17 were deleted from 

analyses for showing evidence of patterned responding (answering the same number 

for all questions or answering a question with a required response of 8 or 9 with a 

number between 1 and 7).  Twenty employees were unable to be included in the 

analysis because their supervisors did not provide answers to the questions regarding 

creativity.  Ten employees who had worked at their organizations for less than one 

month were not included because their supervisors may not have had the necessary 

time on the job with them to evaluate their performance.  Thirteen individuals were 

unable to be included in analyses because they were the only members of their work 

group with usable questionnaires.  Since my expected analyses involve controlling for 

work group effects, groups of one could not be included.  Finally, six individuals 

skipped portions of the questionnaire essential to hypotheses and were therefore 

excluded from analyses.  The resulting sample contained 269 employees (80% of 

respondents).  Of this remaining sample, 42% were female.  The final racial 

breakdown was: 59% black, 40% white, and 1% Hispanic.  Fifteen percent of the final 

 30


sample had supervisory positions.  These supervisors were 30% female, 40% black, 

and 2.5% Hispanic.  The sample contained 59 work groups.  Work groups ranged in 

size from 2 to 16 with an average of 4.56 employees representing each work group. 
 

Measures. 

For a listing of all scale items used in this study, see Appendix A. 

Creativity and Job Performance.  
 

In the research on creativity in organizations, the most common way 

researchers attain measures of creativity is through supervisor evaluations of 

employees.  In a recent meta-analysis of organizational creativity (Eder & Sawyer, 

2007), 44 out of the 58 included studies assessed creativity via supervisor or coworker 

evaluations (with the large majority of these relying on supervisors).  Thirteen of the 

remaining studies relied on self report measures.  Only one study fully relied on an 

objective measure of creativity (employee ideas that were rewarded).  Since self-

reported creativity obviously suffers from a certain level of bias, I relied on supervisor 

evaluations in the present study.  Even Amabile (1996) suggests that at times, a 

judgment of creativity is the best we can do to gauge an individual’s creativity.  In 

order to differentiate creativity from other types of employee performance, supervisors 

at all three organizations also rated their subordinates on in-role performance and 

extra-role performance.  Creativity was assessed using 9 of the 13 items developed by 

George and Zhou (2001).  The 4 items pertaining to a separate “innovative behavior” 

concept were not used.  The items measuring employee creativity tapped into both the 

novelty and quality dimensions of creativity as well as employees’ general creative 

inclinations.  In-role performance refers to individuals’ engagement in the tasks 

 31


directly required of them on the job (e.g., completing assigned duties).  This type of 

performance was assessed using the 4 item scale employed by Eisenberger et al. 

(2001).  Extra-role performance refers to employees’ participation in activities at work 

that go above and beyond their regular job description (i.e., volunteering for things not 

required).  Extra-role performance was assessed using 6 of the 7 items from the Lynch 

et al. (1997) organizational spontaneity scale.  Cronbach’s alphas for creativity, in-role 

performance, and extra-role performance were .98, .95, and .89, respectively.   

Employee measures.   

Employees at all three organizations received the same set of items to 

measure the central concepts of this study.  For most scales, participants indicated the 

extent of their agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert scale (1= Strongly 

Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree).  When different anchors were used, it will be noted in 

the description of those items.  For a listing of the items used in all employee scales, 

see Appendix A.  For some items, wording was changed from the original sources to 

increase comprehension among my samples.  Using Microsoft Word’s “Tools” menu, 
I found that the reading level of my survey questions was between the 5th and 6th grade 
level.  Thus, I do not perceive the potential for widespread readability problems for 

my final sample.   

Intrinsic motivation.   

Amabile (1988) described a motivated employee as being driven and 

excited by the work involved in job tasks.  Accordingly, intrinsic motivation was 

measured using the 4-item scale developed by Eisenberger & Rhoades (2001), 

assessing the extent to which employees view their jobs as interesting, enjoyable, 

 32


boring, and unpleasant.  The items of this scale tap into an individual’s baseline 

enjoyment of and interest in her job.  Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .79. 

Domain-relevant skills.   

Amabile (1988) describes domain-relevant skills as the possible set of 

cognitive pathways from which something new may be produced.  These pathways 

can include one’s technical job skills and one’s knowledge concerning the proper 

ways to do one’s job.  Accordingly, I assessed domain-relevant skills by asking 

employees about their perceived self-efficacy for job tasks and perceived clarity 

concerning the goals and processes of their jobs.  Four items adapted from Spreitzer 

(1995) and Riggs et al. (1994) were used to measure job self-efficacy.  Consistent with 

the concept, these items assessed the degree to which one had confidence in one’s 

abilities on the job, and the degree to which one had developed a mastery of necessary 

job skills.  The internal reliability of this scale was .74.  Additionally, ten items 

developed by Sawyer (1992) were used to measure goal and process clarity.  

Participants were asked about their certainly regarding the goals they should be 

attaining and the procedures they should be using on their jobs (1= Very Uncertain, 7 

= Very Certain).  These items were initially developed to distinguish between the two 

dimensions of role ambiguity at work.  Five items pertain to clarity of goals and 

objectives, and five items pertain to the clarity of the processes needed to accomplish 

objectives.  Cronbach’s alphas for goal and process clarity were both .86. 

Creativity-relevant processes.  

Amabile (1988) described creativity-relevant processes as including an 

individual’s desire to explore new cognitive pathways and a cognitive style favoring 

 33


creative pursuits and taking multiple perspectives.  In the current research I assessed 

three variables tapping into this component: creative cognitive style, openness to 

experience, and creative self-efficacy.  Creative cognitive style, involving an 

individual’s propensity to seek out and think about novel and creative ideas, was at the 

center of Amabile’s description of creativity-relevant processes as well as Woodman 

et al.’s (1993) description of individual cognitive variables that could affect creativity.  

Creative cognitive style was measured using a 4-item scale developed by Miron et al. 

(2004).  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .71.  Individuals high in openness to 

experience (OE; Costa & McCrae, 1992) would enjoy daydreaming and getting lost in 

exploratory thought.  The enjoyment of exploration and engaging in creative pursuits 

inherent in openness to experience makes this personality trait a creativity-relevant 

process.   To measure OE, I used 5 items from the International Personality Item Pool 

(Goldberg, 1999) drawn from the imagination, adventurousness, and intellect 

subscales.  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .78.  Another process potentially 

relevant to creativity is an individual’s confidence in her ability to be creative, known 

as creative self-efficacy (Tierney & Farmer, 2002).  Creative-self efficacy was 

measured using Tierney’s (1997) 3 item measure ( For one of the items I changed the 

phrase “novel ideas” to “new ideas” to make certain it was understandable for the 

majority of employees).  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .74.   

Organizational encouragement of and reward for creativity.   

 

Employees’ perceptions that their organization encouraged creative 

behavior was assessed using 6 items adapted from Shin & Zhou (2003), Amabile et al. 

(1996), and Farmer et al. (2003).  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .92.  In 

addition, a 2-item scale adapted from Eisenberger and Rhoades (2001) was used to 

 34


assess employees’ perceptions that creative performance at their job leads to rewards.  

Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .85. 

Supervisor encouragement and support. 

 

Amabile and her colleagues (1988, 1996) have suggested that the 

supervisor plays an important role in encouraging creativity.  Accordingly, research 

has found that non-supportive supervision and close supervisory monitoring 

negatively influence employee creativity (Oldham & Cummings, 1996) and 

supervisory support, encouragement, and expectations positively influence creativity 

(Amabile et al., 1996; Tierney & Farmer, 2004).  Thus I measured supervisory 

support, close monitoring, recognition, feedback, and expectations of creativity.  Close 

monitoring was measured with four items developed by George and Zhou (2001) and 

one item from Oldham and Cummings (1996).  Two items from the latter scale were 

not used because they did not specifically refer to the supervisor.   Cronbach’s alpha 

for this measure was .69.  To measure supportive supervision, I used 4 of the 8 items 

developed by Oldham & Cummings (1996).  I did not include the 4 items tapping into 

additional supervisory behaviors that are being assessed by other scales in this survey 

(i.e., giving feedback and recognition).  Internal reliability of this shortened supervisor 

support measure was .78.  For supervisory expectations of creativity, I adapted 2 items 

from Farmer et al.’s (2003) “Perceived Coworker Expectations for Creativity” scale.  

The referent of this scale was changed to the supervisor.  Cronbach’s alpha was .76.  I 

assessed two dimensions of supervisory feedback: whether supervisors gave useful 

feedback and whether they gave positive feedback for good employee performance.  

For useful feedback, I adapted the 3-item “Useful Feedback from Co-Workers” 

measure developed by Zhou & George (2001).  For each item, I replaced the word 

 35


“co-worker” with “supervisor.”   Positive feedback was measured using a 4-item scale 

employed by Bettencourt (2004), which was adapted from Podsakoff et al. (1984).  

The measure assesses whether a supervisor provides positive feedback in response to 

superior performance.  Cronbach’s alphas for useful and positive feedback were .91 

and .94, respectively.   

To determine the potential appropriateness of aggregating the supervisory 
scales to the workgroup level, I calculated the rwg (James, Demare, & Wolf, 1984) for 
each scale to measure group members’ agreement concerning their perceptions of 
supervisors.  When rwg scores exceed .70, it indicates substantial agreement with each 
other regarding particular items.  In the current sample, the agreement statistic did not 

reach the .70 level for any scale (useful feedback = .52, support = .42, expectations = 

.42, positive feedback = .49, monitoring = .42).  Therefore, I did not aggregate 

evaluations of supervisors to the group level in my analyses. 

Coworker creativity support.  

In addition to the organization in general and supervisors, the 

componential and interactionist models also suggests that work groups influence 

creativity (Amabile et al., 1996; Woodman et al., 1993).  The degree to which 

employees perceived the work group as being open to and supportive of ideas was 

measured by adapting five items from Anderson & West’s (1996) Support for 

Innovation scale.  Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was .92. 

To determine the potential appropriateness of aggregating the coworker 
support scale to the workgroup level, I calculated the rwg to measure group members’ 
agreement concerning their perceptions of coworkers.  The agreement statistic did not 

 36


reach the .70 level (rwg = .56).  Therefore, I did not aggregate evaluations of coworkers 
to the group level in my analyses. 

Job-required creativity.  
 

Different jobs require different levels of creativity.  Even people in the 

same job can perceive creativity as being more or less important (Unsworth et al., 

2005).  To assess the extent to which employees viewed creativity as a requirement of 

their job, I used the single item measure employed by Shalley et al. (2000) assessing 

whether one’s job requires creativity and an additional item from Unsworth et al.’s 

(2005) creative requirement scale.  Together, the 2-item scale had an internal 

reliability of .80. 

Job autonomy.  

Central to the componential model of creativity is cognitive evaluation 

theory’s assertion that organizational constraints inhibit and freedom encourages the 

development of intrinsic motivation for tasks (Deci & Ryan, 1985).  Therefore, I 

assessed job autonomy using 3 items from the Eisenberger and Rhoads (2001) 

perceived self-determination scale.  Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .71. 

Training and resource availability.  

In an interview study, Amabile (1988) found that employees reported 

resource availability to be a necessary precursor of creativity.  Resources, as well as 

information and training would inform employees as to the intrinsic value of their 

work (Amabile et al., 1996).  Three items from Spreitzer (1995) were used to assess 

resource availability.  The same three items were adapted to assess appropriateness for 

training.  Two of the items were also adapted to assess the availability of needed 

 37


information.  Cronbach’s alphas for availability of resources, training, and information 

were .87, .86, and .61, respectively. 

Workload demands.   

Perceived workload demand was assessed by using 4 of the 8 items from 

the English version of the job demands scale developed by Janssen (2001).  High 

scores indicate perceptions of an overly high workload and time pressure.  Cronbach’s 

alpha for this scale was .76. 

Conscientiousness.   

Conscientiousness was assessed using 4 items from the International 

Personality item Pool (Goldberg, 1999).  Items assessed individuals’ propensities to 

plan ahead, be prepared, and pay attention to detail.  Internal reliability for this 

measure was .72. 

Need for achievement (NAch).   

NAch was assessed using the 5 highest loading items from Eisenberger et 

al.’s (2005) 9-item scale.  Two of the five items that will be used were originally 

adapted from Steers and Braunstein’s (1976) Manifest Needs Questionnaire.  These 

items focus on employees’ desires to set challenging goals, improve their job 

performance, and find solutions to problems.  Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .81.

RESULTS 

 

Assessing Factor Structure 

Because my hypotheses involve supervisor-rated creativity, it is important 

first to determine whether supervisors rated items measuring creativity differently than 

items measuring other types of job performance (in-role and extra-role performance).  

I used confirmatory factor analysis to assess whether the internal structure of the 

creativity and performance items matched the three predicted factors.   I estimated 

nested single-factor and two-factor models for each to evaluate the expected structure 
of the factors.  Table 1 includes the fit statistics and differences in chi-square between 
the expected factor structures and the nested single- and two factor models. I 
evaluated fit using  ∆χ2, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the 
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the  comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), and the 
incremental fit index (IFI; Bollen, 1989).  The expected three-factor structure 

represents better fit on every measure than the single-and two-factor models.  This 

provides some structural evidence of the validity of the creativity measure as distinct 

from other facets of performance – the predicted factor structure is a better fit than the 

non-differentiated factor structure and the structure combining creativity and extra-

role behavior.  Nonetheless, it should be noted that although the three factor model fits 
better than the other alternatives, χ2 is significant, RMSEA is above .05, and CFI is 

 39


below .95, all of which indicate an overall poor fit.  Thus results should be interpreted 

with caution.  The factor loadings based for each item are shown in Table 2.  The 

factor correlations (based on the CFA) are presented in Table 3 (for means and 

standard deviations of all scales, see Appendix B).  While the correlation between 

creativity and extra-role behavior is rather high (.87), the three factor CFA did show a 
significant reduction in χ2, suggesting that an examination of creativity as a distinct 
outcome in the analyses that follow has some merit.

Since intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant 

processes are central to the componential model of creativity and multiple scales were 

used to assess domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes, I conducted a 

confirmatory factor analysis to determine if the items loaded in their predicted scales.  

Table 4 shows the comparison of fit between multiple nested models involved in the 

confirmatory factor analysis.  The one-factor solution involves a non-differentiated 

model where all items load on one factor.  The three-factor model involves a 

differentiation between items addressing the three components, regardless of the 

measure.  Finally, the seven factor model is based on the scales that have been 

described in the Methods section above (intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, goal 

clarity, process clarity, creative cognitive style, creative self-efficacy, and openness to 
experience).  Again, I evaluated fit using  ∆χ2, RMSEA, TLI, CFI, and IFI.  The 
predicted seven-factor structure represents better  (albeit poor) fit on every measure 
than the single-and three-factor models.  The ∆ χ 2 between the seven and three-factor 
models was significant, providing further evidence of better fit.  Factor loadings 

(based on the CFA) are reported in Table 5, and factor correlations are reported in 

Table 6.

Next I created models to examine the potential second-order factor 

structure of domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes.  I did not include 

intrinsic motivation in these analyses because there was only one scale assessing this 

construct.  I expected domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes to load 

on two second-order factors.  I would in turn use these higher-order factors in place of 

the individual scales in my planned analyses, in order to reduce the complexity of the 

models for estimation.  The process of using second-order factors in place of 

individual scales has been used previously in organizational research to limit model 

complexity (e.g., Spreitzer, 1995). Using second order factors for cutting down models 

is statistically sound, but there are two considerations. 

First, information is lost.  Even though the second order factors can be 

justified statistically, the fact that more specific measures are being combined into 

more general measures suggests the loss of information.  One should conduct the 

predictive analyses both ways.  With more scales included, one is less likely to get 

overall significance, but one can see the patterns of results.  For my analyses, I used 

second-order factors whenever it was found appropriate.  I also conducted more 

complex analyses using the specific individual measures.  These results are presented 

 46


in Appendices D thru G  to complement and potentially clarify the second-order 

analyses.   

Second, there must be conceptual justification as to why these factors 

should go together.  For example, one must specify whether the second order factor is 

a latent construct, such that variation in that construct gives rise to variations in the 

measured dimensions (see Bollen & Lennox, 1991; Edwards & Bagozzi, 2000; 

MacCallum & Browne, 1993).  In the current study, I suggest the presence of 

overarching latent constructs which represent domain-relevant skills and creativity-

relevant process.  The observable measures collected in the present study are to some 

degree manifestations of these latent constructs.  For example, a person’s domain-

relevant skills would be likely to influence his/her self efficacy and process and goal 

clarity.  Thus, this second order factor would represent the overall dimension that 

connects the variation of these measures. 

In the first step of this analysis, I created a model with the six first-order 

factors alone.  Then I created a model with all the first order factors loading onto a 

single non-differentiated second-order factor.  Then I compared the fit indices of these 

models to one specifying a differentiation between second-order domain-relevant 

skills and creativity-relevant processes (see Table 7).  The model specifying 2 second-

order factors had significantly better fit (albeit poor) than the model specifying only 

one second order factor.  This provides some evidence of the predicted second order 

factor structure over and above common method variance.  Furthermore, although 

there was a significant chi-square differential between the 2-second order factor model 

and the zero-second order factor model, none of the other fit indices were seriously 

degraded by specifying the second-order factor model.  Thus for the sake of 

 47


parsimony, it is permissible to run my statistical analyses using the second-order 

factors.  In the 2-second-order factor model, all domain-relevant skills scales loaded 

above .47 on one factor and the creativity-relevant skills scales loaded higher than .75 

on the other factor (see Table 8).  The correlations and loadings from Table 6 and 

Table 8 suggest that self-efficacy may be acting independently from the other domain-

relevant skills variables (The r’s and loadings range only from .23 to .47 between self-

efficacy and goal and process clarity).  The results suggest that examining the data in 

accord with the higher-level factor structure may be an admissible option – however, 

in the Appendix D, I will also examine separate analyses involving self-efficacy, goal-

clarity, and process clarity alone, as well as a composite consisting only of goal and 

process clarity.  In the analyses in this section, I will only include the composite scales 

of domain-relevant skills and creativity-relevant processes (see Appendices D and E  

for alternative ways to examine the data).

Next I examined the differentiation of the structure of my measures of 

organizational and supervisory encouragement.  Because multiple scales were used to 

assess organizational and supervisory encouragement, I conducted a confirmatory 

factor analysis to determine if the items loaded in their predicted scales.  Table 9 

shows the comparison of fit between multiple nested models involved in the 

confirmatory factor analysis.  The one-factor solution is a non-differentiated model 

where all items load on one factor.  The two-factor solution involves only a 

differentiation between items addressing supervisory versus organizational actions.  

The three-factor model differentiates further between supportive (support, feedback, 

expectations) and monitoring supervisory actions.  Finally, the seven factor model is 
based on the scales that have been described above.  Again, I evaluated fit using  ∆χ2, 
RMSEA, TLI, CFI, and IFI.  The predicted seven-factor structure represents better 

(albeit, still poor) fit on every measure than the single-, two-, and three-factor models.  
The ∆χ2 was significant, providing further evidence of better fit.  The Factor loadings 
are shown in Table 10 and factor correlations are shown in Table 11.

Next I created models to examine the potential second-order factor 

structure of these scales.  I expected supervisory scales and organizational scales to 

load on two second-order factors.  I would in turn use these higher order factors in 

place of the individual scales in my planned analyses, in order to reduce the 

complexity of the models for estimation.  The proposed higher order factors are 

justified by the conceptual similarities of the scales.  Both organizational scales 

represent creativity-supportive behaviors: openly supporting idea generation and 

providing rewards for creativity and generating ideas.  The supervisory scales tapped 

varying dimensions of encouragement: providing open support, feedback, recognition, 

and holding creative expectations.  Thus, employees’ responses to items on these 

various scales may have conceptual overlap through latent second-order factors. 

As a note, I did not include the supervisory monitoring items in this 

analysis as that factor did not have a significant correlation with any of the 4 other 

supervisory influence scales (see Table 11).  This suggests that this construct would 

not load well on a second order factor.  Additionally, since my main variable of 

concern was supervisor encouragement, I did not use this monitoring scale in any 

future analyses in this paper. 

 53


In the first step of the second-order analysis, I created a model with the six 

remaining first-order factors alone.  Then I created a model with all first order factors 

loading onto a single non-differentiated second order factor.  Then I compared the fit 

indices of these models to one specifying a differentiation between second-order 

supervisory and organizational influences (see Table 12).  The model specifying 2 

second-order factors had significantly better fit (albeit poor) than the model specifying 

only one second order factor.  This provides some evidence of the predicted second 

order factor structure over and above common method variance.  Furthermore, 

although there was a significant chi-square differential between the 2-second order 

factor model and the zero-second order factor model, none of the other fit indices were 

seriously degraded by specifying the second-order factor model.  Thus for the sake of 

parsimony, it is permissible to run my statistical analyses using the second-order 

factors.  In the 2-second-order factor model, all supervisory influence scales loaded 

above .5 on one factor and organizational encouragement and reward loaded higher 

than .65 on the other factor (see Table 13). The correlations and loadings from Table 

11 and Table 13 suggest that supervisor expectations may be acting independently 

from the other supervisor encouragement variables (The r’s and loadings range only 

from .42 to .50 between expectations and variables representing supportive behaviors).  

The results suggest that examining the data in accord with the higher-level factor 

structure may be an admissible option – however, in Appendix G, I will also examine 

results separating supervisor expectations from other supervisor encouragement 

variables.  In the analyses in this section, I will only include the composite scales of 

supervisory and organizational encouragement (see Appendices F and G  for 

alternative ways to examine the data).

I then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to determine if the 

training, information, and resource availability items loaded on their predicted scales.  

Table 14 shows the comparison of fit between a single-factor nested model and the 

proposed three-factor solution.  The one-factor solution involves a non-differentiated 

model where all items load on one factor.  The three-factor is based on the scales that 
have been described above.  I evaluated fit using  ∆χ2, RMSEA, TLI, CFI, and IFI.  
The predicted three-factor structure represents better (albeit still poor) fit on every 

measure than the single-factor model.  Factor loadings are shown in Table 15.  Despite 

the 3-factor solution, the correlations between the factors were extremely high, 

ranging between .81 and .97 (see Table 16).  Therefore, to reduce collinearity in future 

analyses, I decided to combine the items into one large composite of training, 

information, and resource availability.

Analyses to Test Hypotheses 

Table 21 in Appendix B reports means, standard deviations, and 

intercorrelations for the variables included in the analyses reported below. 

Analysis: Hierarchical Linear Modeling 

Because I was concerned with whether work group characteristics (i.e. 

group size, the type of organization the group worked in) affected creativity, it was 

necessary to control for these characteristics in my analyses.  Therefore, I considered a 

number of options concerning how to statistically control for these effects. 

Traditionally, researchers interested in potential group-level effects on 

outcomes have approached their analyses in two ways (Kidwell, Mossholder, & 

Bennett, 1997).  First, researchers would assign the same higher level score to each 

individual at the lower level, in effect providing individuals with group scores.  

Analyses would then be conducted at the lower level of analysis.  Alternatively, 

researchers would aggregate lower level scores to form group composites and then 

conduct analyses only at the higher level.  The first approach does not take into 

account the potential influence of group characteristics on individuals and artificially 

 59


inflates Type I error rates (Burstein, 1980).  The second approach significantly 

reduces the statistical power of the analysis (Klein, Danserau, & Hall, 1994). 

Because I propose that work groups systematically vary in their level of 

creativity (both as a result of true differences and supervisory biases), the most 

appropriate statistical tool to use for the present data is hierarchical linear modeling 

(HLM).  In HLM, analyses simultaneously examine within- and between-group 

differences on dependent measures.  Therefore, one could partial out the variance 

attributed to potential group differences (level-2) prior to examining the effects of a 

level-1 or within-groups analysis (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).  Using HLM, one can 

examine whether working in different groups influences outcomes (i.e., creativity).   

A number of conditions must be met before testing my hypotheses using 

HLM.  In order to determine if my data meets these conditions, a series of models 

must be conducted.  First, it is necessary to conduct a null model in HLM with only an 

employee’s work group predicting the desired outcome.  Since my hypotheses, pertain 

to the mediation effects of intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills on 

creativity, I will have to conduct three separate null model analyses to determine if 

there is systematic group variation in each of these variables.  A null model analysis is 

equivalent to a one-way random-effects analysis of variance where the grouping 
variable is the employee’s work group.  The model will assess within- (σ2) and 
between-group (τ00) variance components and test whether significant differences 
occur between groups on the outcome of interest. 

I ran null models for creativity, intrinsic motivation, and domain-relevant 

skills.  The results for creativity suggest the presence of systematic between-group 
variability (τ00 = .51, ICC = .27, df = 58, χ2 = 146.46, p < .001).   Therefore, it makes 

 60


sense to examine this variable using HLM.  On the other hand, neither intrinsic 
motivation nor domain-relevant skills varied between groups (τ00 = .06, ICC = .03, df 
= 58, χ2 = 67.21, p =ns, and τ00 = .03, ICC = .04, df = 58, χ2 = 66.69, p = ns, 
respectively) and exhibited small ICCs (intraclass correlation coefficient; the ratio of 

between-group variability to total variability).  Thus, in analyses involving these 

variables as outcomes, the level-2 model will be constrained as a fixed effect.  For 

alternative analyses of effects on creativity using the traditional least-squares 

regression method, see Appendix C. 

 

A Test of the Componential Model 

To assess Hypothesis 1 involving a test of the componential model, I was 

required to perform several steps.  First, I ran the full model including all possible 

main effects and interactions of intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, and 

creativity-relevant skills as predictors of creativity, with employee tenure included as 

a level-1 covariate.  When computing interaction terms in all analyses, I first centered 

all variables included in the analyses around the grand mean for each variable to 

reduce multicolinearity (Aiken & West, 1991).  Raudenbush & Bryk (2002) warn that 

“ignoring the nested structure of the data can lead to misleading results when person-

level effect estimates are desired” (p. 138).  These authors suggest that centering 

around a group mean is appropriate when one desires an unbiased estimate of the 

coefficient for “the level-1 relationship net of any group-membership effects” (p. 135).  

Thus, all variables except tenure were group-centered prior to calculation of the model 

(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).  In this random coefficients regression model 

(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), I assessed whether the slopes of the predictors with 

 61


creativity varied across groups.  This analysis provides χ2 estimates to determine 
whether significant variability exists in the predictor-outcome slopes.  If variability 

does exist across groups for a particular effect, the most appropriate model to run is 

one where these significant random effects variances are estimated.  However, for 

effects where significant variability does not exist, a restricted model estimating fixed 

effects may be more appropriate.     

Initial observation of the variance components of the slopes suggested that 

the slopes for both intrinsic motivation (τ22 = .05, df = 7, χ2 = 21.22, p < .01) and 
domain-relevant skills (τ33 = .17, df = 7, χ2 = 19.89, p < .01) varied across groups.  
However, as a note, the χ2 value is only an approximate estimation for 2 major 
reasons.  First, the χ2 tests are simple univariate tests and do not account for other 
random effects in the model.  Second, the statistic is only estimated on the basis of 

those groups with sufficient information to compute separate OLS regressions.  In this 

analysis, only 8 of the 59 groups had sufficient data because the remainder had no 

variation on at least one of the variables involved in the analysis.  Thus, these 

significant results may be severely biased by the lack of inclusion of a majority of the 

work groups.   

When these univariate homogeneity analyses are in doubt, it is appropriate 

to run a multivariate likelihood-ratio test (which uses all the data available) to 

determine if the random-coefficient model is preferable to a restricted model where 

slopes are fixed and only the intercept is allowed to vary across groups (Raudenbush 

& Bryk, 2002).  This likelihood-ratio test is based on a deviance statistic (D) that is 

calculated for each estimated model.  To test whether there is a significant difference 

between 2 models, a test statistic is computed by finding the difference between the 

 62


D’s of the 2 models.  This statistic has an approximate χ2 distribution with a number of 
degrees of freedom equal to the difference of the unique variance and covariance 

components estimated by the models.  Therefore, I ran the restricted model and 
compared the deviance statistic generated from the random-coefficients model (D1 = 
905.04, # of parameters = 37) with the deviance statistic of the restricted model  (D0= 
930.71, # of parameters = 2).  This comparison yielded a non-significant χ2 = 25.67, df 
= 35.  Hence, the simpler, restricted model seems justified because the explanatory 

power does not seem to be enhanced by specifying residuals in the predictor-outcome 

slopes.  I then conducted a follow-up analysis, estimating only random effects for 

intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills.  Since fewer random effects were 

estimated, this allowed for the inclusion of a majority of groups in the analysis (j = 44; 

the restriction on the number of groups applied to random, but not to fixed effects).  

This analysis confirmed the results of the likelihood ratio test as neither variance 

component showed significant variation across groups: intrinsic motivation (τ22 = .09, 
df = 43, χ2 = 53.50, p = ns) and domain-relevant skills (τ33 = .06, df = 43, χ2 = 44.25, p 
= ns).  Thus, I relied on the restricted model for the test of Hypothesis 1.  This 

restricted model suggests that the slopes of the individual-level predictors will be 

assumed not to vary across groups. 

Since the creativity intercept was shown to vary across groups, in my 

analyses I controlled for two work group characteristics: the organization the group 

was from and the group’s size.  I only had 3 major controls throughout my analyses 

(organization of the group, group size, and organizational tenure).  The first two do 

not 

directly impact my results in any way due to the nature of the HLM analyses - they are 

 63


used as moderators of the group-level effect, which does not in any way impact the 

individual level results.  They were not included for theoretical reasons, but rather for 

reasons pertaining to the characteristics of the studies.  I collected data from 3 

organizations, and wanted to examine how this influenced the creativity outcome.  

The organization of the group did affect creativity ratings and I thought it was 

important to show this even if it was not directly related to the individual level 

effects.  In addition, groups varied in size from 2 to much larger - and so I determined 

this to be an important characteristic of my sample for which to control.   

Regarding tenure, there have been mixed findings regarding the influence 

of tenure on creativity.  In a recent meta-analysis (Eder & Sawyer, 2007), many 

studies revealed significant positive or negative effects.  Because there was a potential 

for this to influence creativity, I controlled for it.   

The results for the final analysis are presented in Table 17.  Both dummy 

codes representing the organization from which the group came were significant.  

Overall, mean creativity tended to be higher at the continuing care retirement 

community than in the other organizations.  Using the formulas suggested by 

Raudenbush and Bryk (2002), the group-level control variables accounted for 23% of 

the between group variability.  Looking at the within-group effects, the data do not 

support hypotheses 1a-1d or 1f.  The main effects for none of the components are 

significant.  In addition, the interactions involving intrinsic motivation and domain-

relevant skills with creativity-relevant processes were not significant.  However, in 

support of Hypothesis 1e, there was a significant interaction of intrinsic motivation 
with domain-relevant skills (γ50 = .15, p < .05).   

 64


In order to examine the significant interaction more closely, I plotted a 

graph using the procedures outlined by Aiken and West (1991; see Figure 4).  As seen 

in the figure, intrinsic motivation was positively related to creativity when domain-

relevant skills were high but not when they were low.  The regression line when 

domain-relevant skills were high was marginally significant (B  = .20, t(257) = 1.84, p 

< .10).  The regression line when domain-relevant skills were low was not significant 

(B  = -.06, t(257) = 0.75, p = ns).  This interaction provides partial support for the 

tenets of the componential model.  Intrinsic motivation matters but only when an 

employee has the needed domain-relevant skills to produce creative results. 

As a note, in one alternative analysis (Appendix D), using only process 

clarity as the measure of domain-relevant skills, a 3-way componential interaction was 

observed.  However, the current analysis using a composite measure of domain-

relevant skills did not detect this effect.

  The final portion of Hypotheses 2 thru 8 predicted that intrinsic 

motivation and domain-relevant skills would mediate the relations between several 

work environment-by-person interactions and creativity.  Unfortunately, one 

requirement for mediation is for the mediators (intrinsic motivation and domain-

relevant skills) to be positively related to the outcome (creativity; Baron & Kenny, 

1986).  Because the first analysis indicated that these relations were non-significant, 

mediation is not indicated by the current data. To test the remaining portions of 

 67


Hypotheses 2 thru 8 involving main and interaction effects of work environment 

variables and personality on creativity, intrinsic motivation, and domain-relevant 

skills, I ran a series of models using HLM.  First I ran a model including all possible 

main effects of predictor variables (organizational encouragement, supervisor support 

and encouragement, work group support, job-required creativity, job demands, 

training and resource availability, and autonomy) on creativity, with employee tenure 

included as a level-1 covariate.  In this random coefficients regression model 

(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), I assessed whether the slopes of the predictors on 
creativity varied across groups.  Again, I examined the χ2 values to determine whether 
significant variability did exist in the predictor-outcome slopes.   

 

Initial observation of the variance components of the slopes suggested 
that the slope for job demands varied across groups (τ33 = .04, df = 8, χ2 = 15.86, p < 
.05).  However, in this analysis, only 9 of 59 groups had sufficient data because the 

remainder had no variation on at least one other variable involved in the analyses.  

Therefore, these results may be biased because of the lack of inclusion of additional 

workgroups.  I conducted a follow-up analysis, estimating only the random effect for 

job demands.  Since much fewer random effects were estimated, this allowed for the 

inclusion of nearly all groups in the random effects analysis (j = 55).  In this analysis, 

the variance component for job demands no longer indicated significant variation 
across groups (τ33 = .05, df = 54, χ2 = 59.59, p = ns).  

  Next, I added the personality moderators for Hypotheses 2 thru 8 

(creativity skills, conscientiousness, and need for achievement) and the interaction 

terms into the equation.  In order to preserve degrees of freedom, I conducted another 

 68


model to determine whether the slopes for the interaction terms, but not the 

moderators themselves, varied across groups. 

Initial observation of the variance components of the slopes suggested that 

the slope for the organizational encouragement-by-creativity-relevant skills interaction 
term varied across groups (τ12,12 = .02, df = 8, χ2 = 18.97, p < .05).  However, in this 
analysis, only 9 of 59 groups had sufficient data because the remainder had no 

variation on at least one other variable involved in the analyses.  Therefore, these 

results may be biased because of the lack of inclusion of additional workgroups.  I 

conducted a follow-up analysis, estimating only the random effect for this one 

interaction term.  Since much fewer random effects were estimated, this allowed for 

the inclusion of every group in the analysis (j = 59).  In this analysis, the variance 

component for the interaction term no longer indicated significant variation across 
groups (τ33 = .03, df = 58, χ2 = 52.74, p = ns).  Thus, I relied on a restricted model for 
tests of Hypotheses 2-5. 

Since creativity varied across groups, as in my test of Hypothesis 1, I 

controlled for work organization of the group and group size in my analyses.  The 

results for the final analysis are reported in Table 18.  As with the previous analysis, 

both dummy codes representing the organization from which the group came were 

significant, with mean creativity higher at the continuing care retirement community 

than in the other organizations.  The main effect for job demands was marginally 

significant, as was the interaction effect of job-required creativity with creativity-

relevant processes. 

In order to examine this interaction more closely, I plotted a graph (see 

Figure 5).  As seen in the figure, the shape of the interaction is the opposite of that

predicted.  Job-required creativity seems to lead to creativity, but only among those 

who do not possess high levels of creative processes.  However, an examination of the 

slopes of the interaction revealed that neither slope was significantly different than 0 

(For high creativity-relevant processes, B  = -.02, t(247) = 0.26, p = ns; for low 

creativity-relevant processes, B  = .10, t(247) = 1.47, p = ns).  Therefore, this 

interaction should be interpreted with caution.   

 

As a note, in the alternative analysis in Appendix C involving least 

squares regression, a group support-by-creativity-relevant processes interaction was 

observed.  However, the current analysis controlling for work group effects did not 

detect this interaction.

Next I ran analyses to determine the influence of the work environment 

variables on intrinsic motivation (Hypotheses 2 thru 8) and domain-relevant skills 

(Hypotheses 7a and 7b).  I ran a model including all possible main effects of the 

environmental and personality variables, and their interactions on intrinsic motivation, 

with employee tenure included as a covariate.  Because a previous analysis suggested 

that there was no between group variability in intrinsic motivation, the HLM model 

 72


was set up to constrain the level-2 model to a fixed effect.  Additionally, variables 

were not group-centered.  In essence, this analysis mirrored traditional least squares 

regression analyses. 

The least squares regression results for the analysis are reported in Table 

19.  The main effects for job-required creativity, training and resource availability, and 

need for achievement were significant.  The main effects for job demands and 

organizational encouragement were marginally significant.  There was also a 

marginally significant interaction between training and resource availability, and 

conscientiousness. 

In order to examine this interaction more closely, I plotted a graph (see 

Figure 6).  As seen in the figure, training and resource availability is most related to 

intrinsic motivation among highly conscientious employees.  The shape of the graph 

suggests that the motivation of employees high in conscientiousness may be more 

negatively influenced by lack of training and resources than the motivation of 

employees low in conscientiousness. Tests on the slopes of the graph reveal that the 

slope for high conscientious employees is significant and the slope for low 

conscientious employees is marginally significant (B  = .33, t(250) = 4.05, p < .01; 

and  B  = .17, t(250) = 1.87, p < .10, respectively).

Finally I ran analyses to determine the influence of the work environment 

variables on domain-relevant skills.  I was specifically interested in the interaction 

between training and conscientiousness (Hypothesis 7a & 7b).  I ran a model 

including all possible main effects of the environmental variables and 

conscientiousness, and the interaction between conscientiousness, and training and 

resource availability on domain-relevant skills, with employee tenure included as a 

 75


covariate.  Because a previous analysis suggested that there was no between group 

variability in domain-relevant skills, the HLM model was set up to constrain the level-

2 model to a fixed effect.  Additionally, variables were not group-centered.  In other 

words, I ran another least squares regression analysis. 

The least squares regression results for the analysis are reported in Table 

20.  The main effects for autonomy, supervisor encouragement, and conscientiousness 

were significant.  The interaction between training and resource availability, and 

conscientiousness was not a significant predictor of domain-relevant skills.

Chapter 5 

DISCUSSION 

The literature on employee creativity has had a divergent history.  One 

direction, the componential model, has emphasized the importance of three major 

personal attributes: intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant 

processes (Amabile, 1988).  The other direction, the interactionist model, has 

emphasized the importance of environmental, personal, and contextual variables 

working in tandem to influence creativity (Woodman et al., 1993).  The current study 

is the first to integrate the major tenets of both of these creativity research directions.  

In a series of hypotheses, I suggested the benefits of examining these two research 

models as complementary.  I predicted that elements of the work environment 

(organizational and supervisory encouragement, coworker support, job-required 

creativity, autonomy, training and resource availability, and job demands) interacted 

with employees’ personal attributes (creativity-relevant processes, conscientiousness, 

and need for achievement) to influence creativity, and that these relationships would 

be mediated by intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills (see Figure 3).  The 

current data, collected from three organizational samples, do not support the 

integration of the two models or the predictions based on the P-E fit perspective 

(Livingstone et al., 1997). 

In total, eight multi-part hypotheses were proposed to test the integrated 

model.  The first hypothesis suggested that intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant 

skills, and creativity-relevant processes had direct and interactive effects on creativity 

 78


(see Figure 1).  As argued by Amabile (1988), intrinsic motivation is a primary driver 

of creativity because it leads to employees being interested in and enjoying their work 

for the sake of the work itself.  Domain-relevant skills, involving job-relevant 

knowledge and abilities, would provide a strong foundation for creative work.  

Additionally, creativity-relevant processes, involving one’s ability to generate creative 

ideas, would directly influence creativity.  Based on Amabile’s (1988) suggestions, I 

predicted that the components would exhibit both main (H1a-H1c) and interactive 

effects (H1d-H1f) with each other.  In the current samples, however, I found no 

significant main effects.  Although several studies have shown the link between 

intrinsic motivation and creativity (e.g., Aselage, 2005; Ganesan & Weitz, 1996; Shin 

& Zhou, 2003), the current finding corroborates the findings of studies where this 

direct relation was not found (e.g., Amabile et al., 2002; Mainemelis et al., 2006).  

One reason for the disparity of results in the literature may be the interaction observed 

in the present study between intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills.  Intrinsic 

motivation only had a positive relation with creativity when domain-relevant skills 

were high.  This suggests that motivation for one’s job may not be sufficient for 

creativity; one needs to have a sound understanding of the goals and processes of 

one’s work before motivation can exert its influence.  No additional two-way or three-

way interactions were observed (although the predicted 3-way interaction was 

observed when process clarity was used as the only measure of domain-relevant skills 

– see Appendix D).  This contrasts with the results of Tierney and Farmer (2002) who 

found that employees’ creativity was highest when both creative self-efficacy and job 

self efficacy were high.     

 79


Part (c) of Hypotheses 2 thru 8 predicted that intrinsic motivation (and 

domain relevant skills for Hypothesis 7c) would mediate the relations between 

environment-by-person interactions and creativity.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of 

main effect findings for intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills in the current 

study, the mediation predictions were nullified.  Since the mediation predictions 

represent the point of intersect between the two theoretical directions integrated in this 

paper, the lack of observed main effects raises doubt over the efficacy of integrating 

the componential and interactionist models.  Nonetheless, the observed interaction 

between intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills suggests that the theoretical 

integration of the models may be more complicated than the model set forth in this 

paper.  Since the detection of an effect for intrinsic motivation may depend in part on 

the domain-relevant skills of one’s sample, intrinsic motivation may still be a point of 

intersect for the two creativity research models in employee populations with high 

levels of domain-relevant skills.  Future research needs to examine this possibility.    

The second, third, and fourth hypotheses examined the links of 

organizational and supervisory encouragement and work group support, with 

creativity and intrinsic motivation.  Based on the person-environment fit perspective, I 

suggested that these relations would be strongest among individuals high in creativity-

relevant processes.  In the current study, organizational encouragement, characterized 

by rewards and support for creativity, was marginally related to intrinsic motivation.  

However, no other predicted effects were observed.   

The effect of rewards on creativity has been a hotly debated topic.  

However, recent evidence suggests that specific reward for high levels of performance 

serves to increase employees’ intrinsic motivation and creativity (Aselage, 2005; 

 80


Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001).  Because the items in the current study pertaining to 

organizational rewards and support specifically referred to the organization’s desire 

for creative output, the general non-significant findings are surprising.  Reward for 

rote, non-creative performance may serve to decrease one’s creativity (Eisenberger & 

Rhoades, 2001).  However, rewards and support specifically based on creative output 

should inspire these results.  An unmeasured moderating variable may have 

potentially influenced the current results.  For example, George and Zhou (2002) 

found that, when employees felt clear about the feelings they were experiencing, 

anticipation of rewards for creative performance led to creativity among individuals in 

negative moods but not in positive moods.  Using a mood-as-input perspective, these 

researchers suggested that positive moods may serve as a cue that everything is going 

well, and thus individuals experiencing positive moods would already feel they had 

reached peak performance (Kavanagh & Bower, 1985).  Perhaps, the current samples 

had overall positive moods which dampened the relation between organizational 

creative encouragement and employee creativity. 

Additionally, Baer et al. (2003) explored how situational and personal 

factors influenced the reward-creativity relationship.  These researchers found that 

rewards positively influence creativity, but only in simple jobs among those with 

adaptive cognitive styles.  Innovators (those already interested in creativity) were 

detrimentally affected by rewards when they had simple jobs.  Because the current 

sample was largely drawn from employees with simple, routine jobs, there may have 

been an inhibiting contextual influence on the organizational encouragement-by-

creativity-relevant processes interaction.   

 81


These findings regarding a lack of an interactive effect for the supervisor 

encouragement-by-creativity-relevant processes interaction conflict with the results of 

Strickland and Towler (2005), who found that the influence of transformational 

leaders was more profound when followers were high in openness to experience.  One 

reason for the lack of significant results may be the presence of an unobserved three-

way interaction.  George and Zhou (2001) found that openness to experience predicted 

creativity most when supervisors provided positive feedback and the ends of and 

means to accomplishing one’s job were unclear.  Therefore, a significant interaction 

between supervisor encouragement and creativity-relevant processes may not have 

been observed in the current study because all three organizational samples contained 

a majority of job types where the ends and means of employees’ tasks were very 

specific.  The manufacturing workers actively worked to ensure the product being 

shipped was of consistent quality and in accord with direct specifications.  The 

mortgage lenders were working to find and secure customers to extend financial 

services to.  The continuing care employees were working to ensure a hospitable 

community for the residents.   

Similarly, it is surprising that there was no group support-by-creativity-

relevant processes interactive effect on creativity.  Miron et al. (2004) found that a 

team culture supportive of innovation more strongly affected those individuals with 

more creative cognitive styles.  As for my prediction regarding work group support, 

this was the first attempt to examine the effects of work group support on creativity 

using HLM.  This method contrasts with Miron et al. (2004) who used a typical least 

squares regression analysis to examine their data.  Nonetheless, I expected to observe 

the same interaction patterns even when group-level variance was partialed out.  This 

 82


did not occur.  Supplemental analyses shown in Appendix C suggest that examining 

my data using the traditional least squares regression method would have resulted in 

attaining the predicted results for this variable.  This analysis leads to potential 

questions regarding many research findings in the creativity literature.  Numerous 

studies have analyzed data using least squares regression analysis, even when HLM 

would have been a more appropriate option for controlling group-level effects.  In the 

light of these contrasting findings based on different analyses, it is increasingly 

important that creativity researchers analyze their data using the method that is most 

appropriate for their sample.     

The fifth hypothesis pertained to the potential influence of the perception 

of creativity required by one’s job on intrinsic motivation and creativity.  As in 

Hypotheses 2 thru 4, I predicted that these relations would be most pronounced when 

individuals endorsed high levels of creativity-relevant processes. Results indicated a 

main effect for job-required creativity on intrinsic motivation but not on creativity.  

However, there was an interaction between job-required creativity and creativity-

relevant processes on employee creativity.  Contrary to prediction, the shape of the 

results suggested that job-required creativity was most related to creativity among 

those low in creativity-relevant processes (though neither the trend for individuals 

with high creativity-relevant process nor the trend for individuals with low creativity-

relevant processes was significant; see Figure 5).  This finding suggests the potential 

for creative requirement to play a creativity-enhancing role for those not inclined to 

behave creatively.  Perhaps the desire to do well or the threat of losing one’s job for 

lack of creative performance leads people who are not as likely to seek out creative 

 83


enterprises on their own to do so at work.  Nonetheless, future research is needed to 

corroborate this prediction, as the trends observed in the graph were non-significant. 

The sixth hypothesis involved the influence of job autonomy on 

motivation and creativity.  It has long been suggested that the freedom to determine 

one’s own course of action at work was a precursor to motivation and creativity 

(Amabile, 1988; Deci & Ryan, 1985; Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001).  Autonomy has 

been shown to mediate the relation between performance-related rewards and 

motivation and creativity (Aselage, 2005; Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001).  

Interestingly, in the current study autonomy was not found to directly or interactively 

influence either motivation or creativity.  However, a main effect was observed for 

domain-relevant skills.  Perhaps, the nature of the present sample, involving a large 

portion of routine assembly line workers, did not allow for the detection of the 

predicted autonomy effects.  The other work environments, mortgage lending and 

continuing care, also involved rather routine jobs except in leadership positions.  This 

may explain the observed relation between autonomy and domain-relevant skills.  

Those individuals with more skills, who occupied higher level positions may have also 

exercised more autonomy on the job.   

The seventh hypothesis involved the influence of training and resource 

availability on motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity.  A strong main effect 

was found for training and resource availability on intrinsic motivation, but not on 

creativity or domain-relevant skills.  In addition, this main effect was qualified by an 

interaction with conscientiousness.  Training and resource availability was most 

related to intrinsic motivation when employees endorsed high levels of 

conscientiousness.  This result is consistent with Deci and Ryan’s (1985) assertion 

 84


that intrinsic motivation arises from competence-building experiences.  When 

organizations provide strong training programs and make appropriate resources 

available, employees will respond by being more interested in their jobs.  Highly 

conscientious employees, who are naturally motivated to seek order and organization, 

appear to benefit most in terms of motivation from these competence-building 

experiences.  Training and resource availability may not have been related to 

creativity in the current sample because the job types involved were, to some degree, 

routine.  Thus, high levels of training in these tasks may lead to technically proficient 

work that is not necessarily creative. 

In the eighth hypothesis, I predicted that high levels of job demands 

would negatively influence motivation and creativity, but that this relationship would 

be lessened by one’s level of need for achievement (NAch).  As predicted, I found 

marginally-significant negative relations between job demands and creativity and 

intrinsic motivation.  However, these relations were not lessened by NAch.  The 

literature has been split as to whether job demands have a linear (Janssen, 2000) or 

curvilinear (Baer & Oldham, 2006; Janssen, 2001) relationship with creativity.  Baer 

and Oldham (2006) found that creativity was highest when employees experienced an 

intermediate level of time pressure and both openness to experience and support for 

creativity were high.  Janssen (2001) found that the relation between job demands and 

creativity was actually curvilinear, but that it was moderated by the organization’s 

reward policy.  Intermediate levels of job demands were associated with the highest 

creativity but only when employees felt that their increased effort would be rewarded 

by their organization.  Conversely, the current findings support Amabile’s assertion 

(Amabile et al., 1996) that the true nature of this relationship is likely negative and 

 85


linear.  The problem with many demand measures is that they do not distinguish 

between negative demands and positive job challenge, which is why some curvilinear 

relations may be observed.  Nonetheless, past research findings involving personal 

(openness to experience) and contextual (reward/support for creativity) moderators 

suggest that the true relation between job demands and creativity may be more 

complicated than the present findings show.   

Implications for Practice 

The current results suggest that the most relevant ways to ensure high 

levels of employee creativity are to make sure employees are educated in 

organizational processes, employees are motivated to perform, and, for less creative 

individuals, that creativity is perceived as a requirement on the job.  In addition, 

motivation may be fostered by ensuring employees are sufficiently trained, by 

implementing programs that encourage creativity, and by making sure employees are 

not experiencing excessive job demands. 

  These revelations are hardly earth-shattering but nonetheless provide a 

potentially simplified framework for practitioners to use.  The current study examined 

the potential influence of several environmental variables that have been shown to be 

related to employee creativity in past research to varying degrees.  What the present 

research adds is an amalgamation of the past findings into a coherent model of 

predicted influences on creativity.  In addition, the current results suggest a few focal 

variables (intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant skills, perceptions of creativity 

required on the job, training and resource availability) that organizations can focus on 

to ensure their workforce is maximally motivated and creative. 

 86


Perhaps the strongest implication is that if managers want creativity from 

their least creative employees, they should make it clear that creativity is an expected 

part of the job.  In the current study it was found that such a perceived requirement 

significantly influenced the creative output of typically less creative workers (those 

low in creativity-relevant processes).   

The current results also question the assertion that intrinsic motivation is 

necessary and sufficient for creative work from employees.  Employees who are 

motivated to produce good work also need to be knowledgeable of their job processes 

and confident in their abilities.  Therefore, when organizations desire creative output, 

any efforts to instill motivation should be coupled with experiences that enhance 

employees’ knowledge of their jobs. 

Future Research Directions 

The results of the present study provide inspiration for a number of 

potential research directions.  Researchers should examine the interactive effects of 

componential model variables in other contexts.  Whereas intrinsic motivation and 

domain-relevant skills interactively influenced creativity in the present study, past 

research has shown similar interactions between creativity-relevant processes and 

domain relevant skills in both manufacturing and white collar jobs (Tierney & Farmer, 

2002).  Researchers should examine organizational contexts that support or inhibit 

each of these interactions, as well as situations where all three components may 

interact to provide the maximum level of employee creativity. 

In the current study, creativity-relevant processes were not found to have a 

main effect on creativity.  This conflicts with a number of studies that have shown 

strong relations between openness to experience, creative cognitive style, creative 

 87


self-efficacy and creativity.  Researchers should continue to examine work situations 

that enhance or inhibit these relations.  For example, as discussed above, supervisor 

influences (George & Zhou, 2001; Strickland & Towler, 2005) and coworker 

influences (Miron et al., 2004) have been shown to enhance the effects of creativity-

relevant processes (although not in the present study).  Also, researchers should 

continue to examine more complex interaction models.  For example, Oldham and 

Cummings (1996) found creative personality to be most related to creativity when 

supervisors were supportive, did not closely monitor behavior, and when one’s job 

had a high motivating potential. 

Researchers should also pay close attention to whether the effect of group 

support on creativity (and associated interactions) is simply an artifact of uncontrolled 

group-level variance.  There may indeed be situations when group support influences 

creativity, even after the group-level influence is partialed out.  However, researchers 

should definitely employ the appropriate methods to ensure their reported findings are 

not potentially tainted by group-level influence.   

Researchers should also further examine the influence of creative 

requirement on the job (Unsworth et al., 2005).   The current results suggest that job-

required creativity may be a motivating influence for those low in creativity-relevant 

processes.  Future research should investigate under what circumstances those high in 

creativity-relevant processes be motivated by creative requirement.  For example, 

highly creative employees in research and development positions may react especially 

positively to the creative requirement inherent in their jobs. 

Furthermore, there is an additional limitation of using cross-sectional data 

to test a mediational models that posit “causal” links.  It would be more appropriate to 

 88


evaluate the model presented in this paper using longitudinal data.  Thus, it is possible 

that the predicted effects were not observed due to the concurrent measurement of 

variables hypothesized to have a longitudinal link. 

Finally, researchers should examine the predictions of the integrated 

model developed in this paper in other work environments.  The current sample 

involved a majority of jobs with a relatively low required skill-set.  The integration of 

the componential and interactionist models may be more fruitful in highly skilled 

employee populations who have more opportunities to perform in creative ways. 

Limitations 

The current study is not without its limitations.  First, readers should 

interpret measures of employee behaviors based upon supervisor reports with caution.  

Although standard practice in studies of employee creativity (Eder & Sawyer, 2007), 

supervisor reports of employee performance may suffer from supervisor biases.  

Supervisors may allow their positive or negative personal relationships with 

employees to influence their performance ratings.  Future research should attempt to 

gauge creativity through more objective means, such as rewarded employee ideas, 

suggestions that were implemented, or third party ratings of employee behaviors.  

Alternatively, researchers could attain multiple ratings of employee behaviors (e.g., 

from both supervisors and coworkers) to control for individual biases. 

Another concern was the actual method used to test the hypotheses.  I 

relied on hierarchical linear modeling, whereas typical creativity studies rely on least-

squares regression analysis.  I provide alternative analyses with employee creativity as 

an outcome in Appendix C, so that readers may see how the results would have 

changed if a different, and more common, method of analysis was used.  The results 

 89


from these alternative analyses do differ somewhat from those I attained in the current 

study (for a summary of all alternative results, see Appendix H).  Therefore, future 

research must call attention to these differences in results garnered simply by 

changing the way the data was analyzed.  The significant difference in ratings of 

creativity occurring between work groups that I found in the present study suggests 

that hierarchical linear modeling may be the most appropriate way to analyze data that 

involves supervisory creativity ratings.   

Third, the size of the sample (and the small number of workgroups 

examined) restricted the nature of the hierarchical linear models I could run.  When all 

variables were included in the prediction equations, some tests were only able to be 

run on 8 out of 59 groups (These instances are noted in the results section).  A larger 

sample with more work groups would have allowed a more thorough test of the data 

for the appropriateness of the procedures that were conducted.  Another concern with 

the sample size was the potential lack of power for detecting significant effects.  With 

the size of some of the observed correlations (Appendix B), I would have needed a 

sample up to three times larger to observe significance.  For example, using a table 

provided in Cohen et al. (2003), a true population correlation of .10 would need a 

sample size of 783 to detect a significant effect with a power of .80.  Overall, this 

suggests that I would have needed a substantially larger sample to detect very small 

effects if they were truly significant.  However, there is also the possibility that in the 

current sample, the effects were simply not present due to the characteristics of the 

sample (e.g., relatively simple jobs, tasks that were rote and lacking in creative 

potential).  

 90


Additionally, the inclusion of multiple predictors in analyses is definitely 

a 

concern.  One issue that I had to address was the level of significance to adopt.  In 

order to glean the most potential from the data, I chose a rather liberal alpha of .10 for 

the HLM analyses.  In this way, I would interpret the potential meaning of the most 

effects.  In choosing this liberal approach, there is definitely much higher potential for 

family-wise error.  In a recent dissertation (Lemire, 2006), OLS regression (upon 

which HLM is based) was found to control better for family-wise error than some 

other types of analyses.  Nonetheless, it is possible (especially considering some of the 

divergence that arose in my alternative analyses) that some of the effects arose by 

chance. 

Another potential limitation is the potentially poor fit of my measurement 

models.  Many structural equation models in the organizational literature, because of 

their complexity, cannot escape having a significant chi-square.  The standard of .95 

for the CFI, IFI, and TLI is also a very rigorous standard, and many researchers often 

publish measurement models that claim .90 represents adequate fit on these indices (in 

which case many of my models would be considered "adequate").  The RMSEA cutoff 

point of .05 is also very restrictive and many researchers describe levels as high as .08 

as representing adequate fit.  Again, some of my models would actually be adequate 

using these loose criteria.  Nonetheless, in judging standards of fit, I chose the 

conservative, more-restrictive standards to judge against because I definitely 

understand with the complexity of the models being tested, the propensity for poor fit 

to impact my results.  A poor fitting measurement model implies that a greater portion 

of the variance in the resulting measures is error than would be if the measurement 

 91


model fit better.  Since more error is being introduced into the model, the strength of 

any effects will be attenuated, and thus potentially significant effects may appear to be 

non-significant.  So in short, by more lax standards, the fits of my models are not so 

disconcerting.  Nonetheless, concerns with potential measurement problems definitely 

have merit and represent a potential limitation of the study. 

A final concern of the present study was the overt differences between the 

organizations that comprised the sample.   The manufacturing setting, mortgage 

lender, and continuing care retirement community had vastly different employee 

populations and organizational cultures.  Unfortunately, no sample was large enough 

in and of itself to have the necessary power to run the analyses conducted in this 

study.  However, combining samples is not a foreign practice in organizational studies 

and may actually lend credence to the generalizability of results.  Additionally, the 

HLM method employed allowed for the partialing out of variance attributed to the 

organization in which the work group was located prior to examining individual level 

results.  Thus, any influence stemming from the presence of multiple organizations 

was minimized.  Nonetheless, it is entirely possible that the observed samples 

represent different populations of employees that would be best served to be 

separately analyzed. 

Conclusion 

The purpose of the current research was to establish and test a working 

model of employee creativity that actively combines the tenets of the componential 

and interactionist models.  The current study involved the first “complete” test of the 

componential model using organizational samples.  In addition, I examined whether 

intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills mediated the relations between person-

 92


by-work environment interactions and creativity.  Results did not support the merits of 

the theoretical integration.  While intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills did 

interact to influence creativity, there was no evidence of the componential model’s 

predicted main effects.   In addition, only one person-by-situation effect was found to 

influence creativity, and it was the opposite of what I predicted.  The mediation 

analyses were not analyzed because intrinsic motivation and domain-relevant skills 

did not have main effects on creativity.  Overall, the componential and interactionist 

models received limited support, but the combination of the models was not supported 

in the current sample.   

A major contribution of the present study was the use of HLM 

methodology for testing hypotheses involving supervisor ratings of creativity.  The 

current findings show that supervisor creativity ratings do vary as a function of the 

group whose members are being rated.  Thus, researchers should take this into account 

when planning future research designs.
