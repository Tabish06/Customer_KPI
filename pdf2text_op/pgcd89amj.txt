 The article introduces the construct "organization-based self-esteem"
 and its measurement. We developed a partial nomological network
 resulting in a set of hypotheses that guided efforts to validate the con-
 struct and its measurement. Homogeneity of scale items, test-retest and
 internal consistency reliability, and convergent, discriminant, incre-
 mental, concurrent, and predictive validity estimates were all in-
 spected through conducting field studies and a laboratory experiment.
 We present results from a validation effort involving seven studies that
 drew on data from over 2,000 individuals, representing diverse orga-
 nizations and occupations. Results support the construct validity of the
 measurement and most of the hypotheses.

 A number of researchers have shown an interest in investigating the role
 of self-esteem in a variety of organizational models. The basic hypothesis
 guiding most of this work suggests that the way individuals react to life
 experiences varies as a function of their level of self-esteem, or the extent to
 which they perceive themselves as competent, need-satisfying individuals
 (Korman, 1976). One underlying theoretical tenet regarding self-esteem is
 that individuals will develop attitudes and behave in ways that will main-
 tain their level of self-esteem (Korman, 1976).1 According to this theory, in

 We would like to express our appreciation to Johan Aamodt, from the Norwegian Center for
 Organizational Learning, Oslo, and to Donald G. McTavish and Kjell R. Knudsen, University of
 Minnesota, for their assistance with the laboratory portions of this study. Assistance with data
 collection given by Richard Pearson, Jeff Maida, John Hawley, and Laurie Weingart is also
 greatly appreciated. Finally, we wish to express our appreciation to the two anonymous re-
 viewers for their constructive contributions to our article.

 esteem-self-consistency and self-enhancement (cf. Dipboye, 1977; Korman, 1976). Predictions

 work organizations, individuals with high self-esteem will develop and
 maintain favorable work attitudes, such as job satisfaction, and will behave
 productively-perform at a high level-because such attitudes and behav-
 ior are consistent with the attitude that they are competent individuals.
 Individuals with low self-esteem, on the other hand, will develop and main-
 tain unfavorable work attitudes and unproductive work behaviors that are
 consistent with the attitude that they are people of low competence. To give
 an example, Hollenbeck and Brief (1987) found that high self-esteem indi-
 viduals valued attainment of performance goals more than low self-esteem
 individuals.

 CONCEPTUAL LEVELS AND MEASURES OF SELF-ESTEEM

 Many researchers have argued for recognizing self-esteem as a hierar-
 chical and multifaceted phenomenon (Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976;
 Song & Hattie, 1985; Tharenou, 1979). As researchers have worked with the
 self-esteem construct, different levels of generality for self-esteem have
 emerged. Simpson and Boyle (1975) noted that researchers have measured
 global self-esteem in reference to an overall evaluation of self-worth, role-
 specific self-esteem as the self-evaluation that arises from one of life's many
 roles (parent, student, spouse, etc.), and task- or situation-specific self-
 esteem as the self-evaluation that results from behavior in a specific situa-
 tion and representing a person's competence in a task just performed.

 Many measures of global self-esteem have been developed, and some
 have demonstrated reasonable levels of construct validity (Crandall, 1973;
 Wells & Marwell, 1976; Wylie, 1974). Measures of task-specific self-esteem
 have also been developed, though on more of an ad hoc basis (Wells &
 Marwell, 1976). Nevertheless, Tharenou, after reviewing measures of self-
 esteem, noted that "major problems occur [in the measurement] of self-
 esteem" (1979: 319). Many researchers develop their own scales, fail to
 check for evidence of acceptable construct validity, and then begin to ad-
 dress substantive research issues (Schwab, 1980). Thus, Tharenou and oth-
 ers have called for the development and validation of measures of self-
 esteem specific to the domains under study-the tasks, work units, organi-
 zations, and so forth, with which a researcher is concerned.

 On numerous occasions, researchers (e.g., Simpson & Boyle, 1975; Song
 & Hattie, 1985; Tharenou, 1979) have expressed concern over the appropri-
 ateness of a self-esteem measure included in an investigation. Research con-
 ducted on the relationship between behaviors and attitudes (Epstein, 1979)
 suggests that the more self-esteem is framed in a context consistent with the
 behavior or attitude to be predicted, the higher will be the observed corre-

 based on those two explanations are similar in some situations (Dipboye, 1977) and different in
 others (ones, 1973). Our purpose here was construct validation, not the theoretical testing of
 differential predictions. Indeed, some research has indicated that both theories are correct,
 depending on the type of dependent variable examined (Swann, Griffin, Predmore, & Gaines,
 1987).

 lation between the two variables. For instance, task-specific self-esteem
 should predict task-related phenomena like task performance more strongly
 than will global self-esteem.

 Song and Hattie (1985), for example, noted that observations pertaining
 to the relationship between self-concept and academic performance have
 been confounded by the use of global and academically specific self-concept
 scales, which frequently fail to produce the same results. Following their
 observation that task-specific measures frequently predict behaviors not pre-
 dicted by global measures, Simpson and Boyle (1975) challenged the wis-
 dom of universally employing global self-esteem scales in a number of re-
 search paradigms. Observations of this nature led Tharenou (1979) to note
 that on numerous occasions researchers have employed global measures
 when it would have been more appropriate to use a more narrowly focused
 self-esteem construct. Global self-esteem scales are likely to be appropriate
 for studies of individuals within the context of total life events, but task-
 specific measures of self-esteem, measures that reveal a person's worthiness
 in a particular activity, are appropriate for very task-specific behaviors.

 Thus, we observe that (1) measures of global self-esteem frequently fail
 to demonstrate significant relationships with measures of other constructs
 when employed in organizational research, (2) although measures of global
 self-esteem are reasonably well developed, there are few, if any, construct-
 valid measures of self-esteem framed in a task or organizational context, and
 (3) self-esteem should be measured at a level of analysis that is similar to the
 level of analysis of the variables with which it is being studied. Thus, orga-
 nization-specific self-esteem should predict organization-related phenom-
 ena like organizational commitment more strongly than task-specific or glob-
 al self-esteem, and global self-esteem should predict life satisfaction more
 accurately than either task-specific or organization-specific self-esteem.

 ORGANIZATION-BASED SELF-ESTEEM

 A Rationale for a Measure of Organization-based Self-esteem

 Many of the constructs that are traditionally employed in organizational
 paradigms, such as turnover, climate, commitment, and citizenship, are ori-
 ented toward employees and their role within a total organization, and it is
 at the total-work-environment level of analysis that there is a need for an
 appropriate measure of self-esteem. To our knowledge, however, no con-
 struct-validated measure of self-esteem exists that is anchored in an organi-
 zational frame of reference, even though many important constructs in the
 organizational sciences are organization-based. We directed the present re-
 search effort toward the development and initial validation of such a mea-
 sure of self-esteem, hoping that such a measure will better enable researchers
 to examine the effects of self-esteem in relation to other organization-based
 constructs.

 (OBSE) and its measurement. We present results from seven studies exam-
 ining the psychometric properties of a measure of the construct and an
 empirical validation evaluation of a partial nomological network incorpo-
 rating it. The purpose of this investigation is the development and initial
 validation of a measure of organization-based self-esteem.

 The Organization-based Self-esteem Construct

 According to Coopersmith (1967), the concept "self" is complex and
 multidimensional. It reflects diverse attributes and capacities, some of
 which are manifested in external objects such as the body, and others of
 which are internal, consisting of feelings and beliefs. Self-esteem is only one
 of many concepts of self that have found their way into the organizational
 sciences.

 Building from the work of Coopersmith (1967), Gelfand (1962), Korman
 (1976), and Wells and Marwell (1976), we viewed self-esteem as a self-
 evaluation that individuals make and maintain with regard to themselves.
 Self-esteem expresses an attitude of approval or disapproval of self; it is a
 personal evaluation reflecting what people think of themselves as individ-
 uals; it indicates the extent to which individuals believe themselves to be
 capable, reflecting a personal judgment of worthiness.

 The concept introduced in this study is similar to other conceptualiza-
 tions of self-esteem (e.g., Korman, 1976; Wells & Marwell, 1976). We define
 organization-based self-esteem as the degree to which organizational mem-
 bers believe that they can satisfy their needs by participating in roles within
 the context of an organization. People with high OBSE have a sense of
 personal adequacy as organizational members and a sense of having satisfied
 needs from their organizational roles in the past. Thus, organization-based
 self-esteem reflects the self-perceived value that individuals have of them-
 selves as organization members acting within an organizational context. As
 a result, employees with high OBSE should perceive themselves as impor-
 tant, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile within their employing organi-
 zation.

 Employees with high self-esteem are likely to have a strong sense of
 self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977). That is, they are likely to have strong expec-
 tations that they can execute the behaviors required for task performance.
 Thus, individuals who develop beliefs about their own efficacy within and
 across situations will simultaneously develop a strong sense of self-esteem.
 Efficacy perceptions at the level of specific tasks contribute to task-specific
 self-esteem; efficacy perceptions across a variety of organizational tasks con-
 tribute to OBSE; and efficacy perceptions that accumulate across a variety of
 tasks and roles contribute to the formation of global self-esteem. But orga-
 nization-based self-esteem differs from perceptions of self-efficacy because it
 reflects an individual's self-perceived competence within an organization
 and self-efficacy reflects a belief that self-perceived competence can be
 translated into actions that will result in successful performance.

 A PARTIAL NOMOLOGICAL NETWORK

 FOR ORGANIZATION-BASED SELF-ESTEEM

 The studies reported here focused on validating a measure of organiza-
 tion-based self-esteem. Thus, we focused on demonstrating reliability of
 measurement, convergent validity, and the distinctness of OBSE from other
 constructs (Schwab, 1980). In addition, though we have not yet developed a
 complete nomological network for OBSE, we present an initial network here
 to guide efforts to further validate the construct and its measurement (see
 Figure 1). This will be done, in part, by testing hypotheses derived from this
 nomological network.

 Properties of Organization-based Self-esteem

 Korman's (1970, 1971, 1976) self-consistency motivational theory pro-
 vided much of the theoretical basis for our OBSE construct. He saw self-
 esteem as both shaped by experiences and central to the explanation of
 employee motivation, attitudes, and behaviors. Extending this reasoning, we
 posited that experiences within an organization will shape OBSE, which
 will also affect organization-related behaviors and attitudes. In contrast,
 global self-esteem derives from an aggregation of experiences across these
 and many other contexts that accumulate across time. But because experi-
 enced self-worth in one domain is likely to be correlated with experienced
 self-worth in other domains, we expected organization-based self-esteem to
 be related to global self-esteem, of which it is a partial determinant. Further,
 we expected OBSE to be related to task-specific self-esteem. Task-specific
 self-esteem may partially determine experiences within an organization that
 lead to an individual's level of OBSE. A person with low task-specific self-
 esteem, for example, may perform poorly, leading to organizational sanc-
 tions and low OBSE. Thus, our first two hypotheses focus on organization-
 based self-esteem's relationships to levels of other types of self-esteem:

 Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and global self-
 esteem.

 Hypothesis 2: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and job- or task-
 specific self-esteem.

 Like global self-esteem, OBSE is part of an individual's basic belief
 system. As a part of personality, this belief system, once it is established, is
 relatively stable, especially when there are no major environmental changes
 that may give rise to new kinds of experiences. Viewing OBSE as a part of
 people's belief systems led to our next hypothesis:

 Hypothesis 3: In the absence of major changes in work
 environment, organization-based self-esteem will be sta-
 ble across time.

 agree with Tharenou's (1979) suggestions that the construct be treated as
 both a dependent and independent variable and that reciprocal effects are
 likely because of the nature of self-esteem (Bandura, 1978). Thus, we explore
 OBSE as a determinant or antecedent of behavior and attitudes and as a
 consequence of work-environment experiences.

 Antecedents of Organization-based Self-esteem

 Our nomological network specifies several expected antecedents of
 OBSE. Korman's (1971) review of the environmental antecedents of self-
 esteem suggested that both the expectations of others and situational con-
 ditions play a shaping role. Korman's reference to socially induced self-
 esteem suggests that the comments others direct toward people and the types
 of tasks assigned to them communicate messages about their value. If sig-
 nificant others think a person is a valuable organizational member and their
 comments and behaviors reflect that belief, enhanced OBSE is likely to be
 the consequence.

 Previous research has also identified environmental conditions as major
 shaping factors. Korman's (1970) work suggested that in a mechanistically
 designed social system-a social system in which procedures, control, for-
 mality, and hierarchy are emphasized-people will develop low levels of
 self-esteem. Mechanistic organizations achieve a high level of system-
 imposed control through a rigid hierarchy, centralization, standardization,
 and formalization. Rules, procedures, and management actions greatly con-
 trol employees' behaviors in such organizations. Korman predicted that un-
 der such organizational conditions, employees will eventually develop a
 belief system consonant with the apparent basic mistrust or lack of respect
 for people implicit in highly controlled systems. He reasoned that the de-
 velopment of programmed activities and high rule specification implies a
 mistrust in the abilities and willingness of people to complete their tasks on
 their own, without direction and control from others (Kipnis & Lane, 1962).
 In contrast, an organic social system, which is more personal and democratic
 and less concerned with hierarchy, procedures, formality, and control, will
 lead to higher levels of self-esteem with work contexts because it places
 inherent trust in employees as competent, valuable, contributing individu-
 als.

 An elaboration of Korman's argument would suggest that any form of
 system-imposed behavior control, or external control system, carries with it
 an assumption of the incapability of individuals to exercise self-direction
 and self-control. The greater the imposed control, the less self-direction and
 control individuals have in a system. One consequence of a highly con-
 trolled system is likely to be the suggestion to employees that they are not
 competent within the organizational context. Continual exposure to these
 signals and the absence of organizational opportunities to demonstrate and
 experience competence lead to low levels of organization-based self-esteem.
 By way of contrast, sources of environmental structure (Pierce, Dunham, &
 Cummings, 1984) that permit the exercise of self-direction and self-control

 should be positively associated with a perception of organizational compe-
 tence. Compared to individuals in work environments that control their
 behaviors, people in such a system have a greater opportunity to exercise
 competence and experience success, which contributes to self-assessments
 of competence.

 In sum, managerial attitudes and behaviors directly expressed in man-
 ager-employee interactions and indirectly expressed via the creation of sys-
 tems within which employees must function are likely to play a major role
 in the development of OBSE. Thus,

 Hypothesis 4: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween the perception of managerial respect for organiza-
 tion members and organization-based self-esteem.
 Hypothesis 5: Mechanistic organizational designs will
 cause lower levels of organization-based self-esteem than
 organic designs.

 Tharenou's (1979) and Tharenou and Harker's (1982) reviews of the
 self-esteem literature suggest that job characteristics are among the most
 consistent correlates of individuals' assessments of their own work and task
 competence and worth. The most influential job characteristics for develop-
 ing high self-esteem are the amount of challenge and autonomy in a job
 (Tharenou, 1979). In other studies, job complexity has had a consistently
 positive and significant relationship with global self-esteem and work and
 task self-esteem (Dipboye, Zultowski, Dewhirst, & Arvey, 1979; Freedman &
 Phillips, 1985; Sekaran & Wagner, 1981; Tharenou & Harker, 1982). Given
 Hackman and Oldham's (1975) job characteristics model, we might reason
 that employees' performance of complex jobs that suggest they are compe-
 tent, valuable, and capable of self-direction and self-control will reinforce a
 similar belief system. That is, the opportunity to perform complex tasks that
 require moderate to high levels of ability should allow employees the op-
 portunity to experience personal worth. By experiencing complex tasks,
 Hackman and Oldham (1975) proposed that employees will come to expe-
 rience a sense of responsibility and to experience their organizational role as
 meaningful. Both of these psychological states should unfold, unless an
 individual is overmatched with his or her job. Through this process, a cog-
 nitively consistent view of the self should develop, thereby enhancing an
 individual's organization-based self-esteem. In addition, successful perfor-
 mance of complex jobs may lead to other experiences within an organization
 that reinforce OBSE, such as promotions. Through these processes, we ex-
 pect OBSE to be related to perceived job complexity. Thus,

 Hypothesis 6: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween perceived job complexity and organization-based
 self-esteem.

 Consequences of Organization-based Self-esteem

 Cognitive consistency theory assumes that people are motivated to
 achieve outcomes that are consistent with their self-concept (Korman, 1971:

 595). This model would suggest that employees with high OBSE-
 employees who perceive themselves as organizationally valuable and mean-
 ingful-will attempt to engage in behaviors valued in their organization. In
 similar fashion, need theory (Alderfer, 1972; Maslow, 1943) and self-
 enhancement theory (Dipboye, 1977) would also predict that employees are
 motivated to engage in behaviors that demonstrate and enhance their orga-
 nizational worth. To the extent that these behaviors demonstrate personal
 competence and make an organizational contribution, employees will derive
 intrinsic satisfaction, coupled with a reinforcement of their self-esteem. Sub-
 sequent success due to these behaviors should reinforce high organization-
 based self-esteem, and failure would reinforce low OBSE. Thus, to maintain
 cognitive consistency, employees with high OBSE should be motivated to
 perform at a high level, actually perform at a high level, have favorable
 attitudes about an organization, and engage in other organization-related
 behaviors that would benefit the organization (cf. Taylor & Brown, 1988).
 Low OBSE employees are predicted to do the opposite to maintain cognitive
 consistency. Thus, we hypothesized that OBSE would relate to the following
 behaviors and attitudes but again acknowledged the possibility of reciprocal
 causation:

 Hypothesis 7: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and intrinsic work
 motivation.

 Hypothesis 8: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and job per-
 formance. 2

 Hypothesis 9: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and general job sat-
 isfaction.

 Hypothesis 10: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and engagement in
 organizationally beneficial behaviors.

 Increased self-acceptance within an organizational context is likely to
 be associated with increased satisfaction with one's organizational associa-
 tion and increased attachment to the organization (organizational commit-

 2 Actually, performance level is expected to be a strong determinant in the formation of

 OBSE. As employees begin their organizational tenure, objective and subjective performance
 feedback provide cues about their level of competence within an organization, which deter-
 mines beliefs about their self-perceived task- and organization-based worth. Because the re-
 spondent groups from which we obtained performance measures were characterized by em-
 ployees with high tenure, who were likely to have already-determined beliefs about organiza-
 tion-based competence, we phrased the hypothesis in terms of OBSE as a cause of performance
 instead of vice versa.

 We also note that research evidence shows that there are a host of factors that attenuate the
 relationship between self-esteem and performance (Brockner, 1988), even though the basic
 relationship should be as hypothesized.

 ment). A high level of organizational self-esteem implies a correspondingly
 high level of experienced personal competence and organizational worth.
 Such a psychological state is need-satisfying and reinforcing for an individ-
 ual and thus positions an organization as a need-satisfying agent in an em-
 ployee's life. Because the organization satisfies needs, employees are likely
 to integrate the organization into their lives, to internalize the organization,
 and to make its goals and value systems part of their own. Thus:

 Hypothesis 11: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and organizational
 commitment.

 Hypothesis 12: There will be a positive relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and organizational
 satisfaction.

 Figure 1 summarizes the first 12 hypotheses in the proposed nomolog-
 ical network for the OBSE construct. It should be noted that the model is
 only a partial network for the construct and that many of these relationships
 are likely to involve reciprocal effects (Bandura, 1978; Tharenou, 1979).

 Predictive Efficacy of Organization-based Self-esteem

 Building on the concerns expressed by Song and Hattie (1985), Simpson
 and Boyle (1975), and Tharenou (1979) regarding the validity of self-esteem
 measures, the predictive accuracy of existing measures, and appropriate
 levels of construct measurement, we offer two additional hypotheses. Both
 Hypotheses 13 and 14 attempt to establish the predictive efficacy of OBSE
 relative to measures of task-specific and global self-esteem.

 Of the several constructs examined in the series of studies reported here,
 organizational commitment is perhaps the perceptual target most closely
 aligned with the target of organization-based self-esteem. Organizational
 commitment is the degree to which employees are willing to take internal
 and external actions on behalf of their organization, and OBSE is the degree
 to which they see themselves as need-satisfying individuals within the con-
 text of their organizational experiences. Following the argument concerning
 levels of analysis made above, we would expect this relationship between
 OBSE and organizational commitment to be stronger than the relationship
 between task-specific self-esteem and organizational commitment. That is,
 we expect an organization-organization relationship to be stronger than a
 task-organization relationship. To help distinguish OBSE from task-specific
 self-esteem, we hypothesized that:

 Hypothesis 13: There will be a stronger relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and organizational
 commitment than between task-specific self-esteem and
 organizational commitment.

 Continuing the level-of-analysis argument, we also expect that the organi-

 tween OBSE and organizational satisfaction will be stronger than the rela-
 tionship between global self-esteem and organizational satisfaction. Thus,

 Hypothesis 14: There will be a stronger relationship be-
 tween organization-based self-esteem and organizational
 satisfaction than between global self-esteem and organi-
 zational satisfaction.

 Study Designs and Respondents

 METHODS

 The studies reported here drew on seven groups of people with a com-
 bined total of 2,444 individuals. The seven studies were used to test the 14
 hypotheses, but each hypothesis was not tested in each study. We examined
 scale dimensionality, homogeneity of scale items, reproducibility of homo-
 geneity across studies, reliability estimates (test-retest and internal consis-
 tency), and convergent, discriminant, incremental, concurrent, and predic-
 tive validity estimates.

 Table 1 identifies the study and respondents with which each of the
 hypotheses was tested. Respondents for study 1 were 32 summer school
 teachers employed by a midwestern school system. Study 2 was based on
 data from 333 employees of a mining firm representing a variety of occupa-
 tional and skill categories. Study 3 drew on lower-, middle-, and upper-level
 managers from a variety of manufacturing and service-oriented organiza-
 tions (e.g., utility, banking, mining, oil, education, health care); these man-
 agers participated in two laboratory-based organizational simulations. We
 obtained a total of 38 observations (20 for one simulated organization and 18
 for the second) from the simulations. The fourth study employed 1,426 mid-
 western school teachers, administrators, and support workers. The fifth in-
 cluded 475 employees, representing all levels and job functions, from an
 automobile service club in a midwestern state. Study 6 used data from 96
 office employees, from entry-level clerical workers through top managers,
 from a state educational association. Finally, the respondents for study 7
 consisted of 45 evening M.B.A. students at a midwestern university, all of
 whom were employed full-time in various types of jobs.

 Procedures

 Respondents in six of the seven studies, study 3 being the exception,
 were administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires with questions directed
 toward their current full-time jobs. Procedures for study 7 varied; we gave
 those respondents the same questionnaire on two occasions five weeks
 apart. For participants in study 3, who also received a paper-and-pencil
 questionnaire, questions applied to simulated jobs the participants held dur-
 ing a three-day management development laboratory program.

 The organizational simulation in study 3 was designed to create two
 types of organizational structures: mechanistic and organic. These differ-
 ences were produced through a combination of written instructions describ-

 ing the structure and goals of the hypothetical organization and the role
 playing of the directors of the laboratory. All participants worked in both a
 mechanistic and an organic organization during three days of organizational
 simulations with the order of exposure to mechanistic and organic structure
 counterbalanced. A complete description of the simulation appears in Knud-
 sen, McTavish, and Aamodt (1985). For a manipulation check, we obtained
 several structural measures-perceived authoritarianism, formality, con-
 cern for control, concern for procedures, and flexibility-to compare the
 two social system structures. The results indicated that participants per-
 ceived the manipulation as we intended (F - 40.03, p < .01). There were no
 significant effects for the order in which the two structures were experi-
 enced.

 Measures

 Organization-based self-esteem. The items in the OBSE scale were de-
 rived from comments we have often heard in discussions with employees,
 managers, and organizational scientists. The following demonstrates the
 type of comment we mean: Joel S. Birnbaum, in an interview with Business
 Week (Wilson & Harris, 1986: 116), noted that he became frustrated at IBM
 by the difficulty of getting his ideas to market. Emphasizing a cognition,
 reflecting a personalized evaluation of self-worth, that began to develop,
 Birnbaum said, "I had the feeling I didn't make a difference." We have come
 to the conclusion that it is not uncommon for employees to develop a belief
 that they "do not count," "do not make a difference," "are not a valuable part
 of this place." It was out of this context that we started the development of
 the OBSE measure.

 The OBSE scale consists of ten items generated by us. Each of the items
 reflects what we would expect employees to consider in evaluating the ex-
 tent to which they believe that they are valuable, worthwhile, effectual mem-
 bers of their employing organizations. We asked respondents in studies 1, 2,
 and 3 to think about the messages they received from the attitudes and
 behaviors of their managers and supervisors and to indicate, on a 5-point
 scale, the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each of the following
 statements: I count around here; I am taken seriously; I am important; I am
 trusted; there is faith in me; I can make a difference; I am valuable; I am
 helpful; I am efficient; and I am cooperative. To increase adjusted item-total
 correlations, we later appended the wording "around here" to all items and
 employed this revised scale in studies 4-7. We used a 5-point Likert re-
 sponse scale with the ten items measuring organization-based self-esteem,
 except in study 4, where a 7-point scale was employed.

 Other measures. To be consistent with the construct validation process
 (Schwab, 1980), we tried to use measures of other constructs with previously
 established psychometric properties, though in a few instances this could
 not be done.

 In study 1, organization-based self-esteem was also measured with a
 modification of a 19-item semantic-differential global self-esteem scale de-

 veloped in unreported research by Gardner and Stone.3 The modification
 consisted of asking for responses to the scale items based on experiences
 with a current job as opposed to total life-based experiences. Gardner and
 Stone developed this measure from (1) thoroughly reviewing existing global
 self-esteem measures (Crandall, 1973; Wells & Marwell, 1976; Wylie, 1974),
 (2) isolating 19 common dimensions across those existing measures, and (3)
 framing those 19 dimensions in the form of bipolar adjectives (e.g., cooper-
 ative-uncooperative, self-assured-hesitant; helpful-frustrating; efficient-
 inefficient; supportive-hostile). In their research, which consisted of two
 laboratory experiments, the semantic differential scale correlated .63 (p <
 .001) with the established Likert-type global self-esteem scale (Rosenberg,
 1965). Inspection of the relationship between the Likert scales used with our
 OBSE measure and the semantic differential scale provides insight into is-
 sues dealing with convergent validity and method variance (Campbell &
 Fiske, 1959; Schwab, 1980).

 Managerial respect was measured using a single Likert-type item in
 studies 1 and 4: "Management has little regard for the well-being of people
 who work for this organization." Organizational commitment was assessed
 in studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with either the long (15 items) or the short (9 items)
 form of the Porter, Steers, Mowday, and Boulian (1974) instrument. We used
 the following to measure general job satisfaction: in study 1, Hackman and
 Oldham's Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS, 1975); in study 4, the Minnesota Sat-
 isfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) (Weiss, Dawis, England, & Lofquist, 1967);
 and in studies 5 and 6, a combination of seven of the eight facets assessed by
 the Index of Organizational Reactions (IOR) (Smith, 1976). Organizational
 satisfaction (Dunham, Smith, & Blackburn, 1977) was measured in study 7
 with a single item that read "Consider the organization that you work for and
 the things that you do for this organization. Circle the face on the appropriate
 scale which best expresses how you feel about your association with this
 organization" and employed the Dunham and Herman (1975) modification
 of Kunin's (1955) Faces scale. To measure internal work motivation, we used
 the JDS in study 2 and Lawler and Hall's (1970) measure of intrinsic moti-
 vation in studies 5 and 6. Organizational citizenship was measured in study
 4 by a self-report version of the 16-item scale developed by Smith, Organ,
 and Near (1983). We measured job complexity in studies 5 and 6 with items
 from the Job Characteristics Inventory (Sims, Szilagyi, & Keller, 1976) for the
 measurement of variety, autonomy, feedback, and task identity and took
 significance items from the JDS. Global self-esteem was measured in study 7
 with Rosenberg's (1965) 10-item questionnaire. Task- and job-based self-
 esteem was measured in studies 5 and 6 with a 6-item modification of the
 Rosenberg scale and Beehr's (1976) 3-item scale. We modified the Rosenberg

 scale by anchoring each item in the context of a respondent's job; for exam-
 ple, "I feel I have a number of good qualities" was changed to "I feel I have
 a number of good qualities for the performance of my job." We used super-
 visory ratings to measure job performance in studies 5 and 6 and also used
 an objective measure of performance for some of the employees in study 5.
 Data for that measure came from archival personnel files and reflected the
 most recent performance measurement before survey measures were ob-
 tained. The two measures of performance for study 5 reflected the major
 categories of employees at the research site: nonexempt employees, who
 received an hourly wage, and telemarketing employees, who received an
 hourly wage plus a commission for membership sales. The nonexempt per-
 formance measure was the sum of supervisory ratings on eight dimensions:
 knowledge, quality, quantity, initiative, dependability, adaptability, cooper-
 ation, and attitude. The performance measure for telemarketers was average
 dollar club-membership sales per hour during the most recent performance
 review period. In study 6, supervisory ratings of nonexempt employees were
 in one of three classes: below standard, at standard, or above standard. Table
 2 summarizes information on which measures were employed in the various
 studies.

 Analyses

 Descriptive statistics, reliability, and validity. Group means and stan-
 dard deviations were calculated for each variable. For multiitem scales, we
 used coefficient alpha (Cronbach, 1951) to estimate reliability. In study 7, a
 test-retest estimate of reliability for organization-based self-esteem was also
 calculated. In addition, we calculated this test-retest correlation controlling
 for employee perceptions of the degree to which organizational change had
 occurred between the two data collections. For study 1, convergent validity
 evidence for the OBSE measure was obtained by correlating the scores for the
 Likert and semantic versions of the scale. We examined evidence on dis-
 criminant validity for that group by comparing the convergent validity co-
 efficients to correlations of OBSE with other study variables. Convergent and
 discriminant validity evidence was also tested in studies 5 and 6 by com-
 paring the correlations of OBSE with measures of job and task self-esteem
 and with the correlations of OBSE with other study variables. Evidence as to
 the incremental validity (Sechrest, 1963; Stone, 1978; Zaccaro & Stone,
 1988) of OBSE derives from studies 5, 6, and 7. Incremental validity provides
 ''some increment in predictive efficiency over the information otherwise
 easily and cheaply available" (Sechrest, 1963: 154). Tests of Hypotheses 13
 and 14 examined the predictive efficacy of OBSE, task-specific, and global
 measures of self-esteem with organization-based constructs. Finally, we
 used principal component factor analyses with varimax rotations in studies
 5 and 6 as part of the examination of discriminant and convergent validity
 evidence.

 Tests of hypotheses. Most hypotheses that make up the OBSE network
 were tested through correlational analyses of the proposed relationships. We
 tested Hypothesis 5, involving the impact of social system design on orga-
 nization-based self-esteem, using a one-way analysis of variance for differ-
 ences in OBSE between mechanistic and organic settings, controlling for the
 order in which the simulated organizational types were experienced.

 RESULTS

 Since the purpose of the empirical studies was to demonstrate the con-
 struct validity of the OBSE scale, we have chosen to organize our results
 around several major indicators of construct validity, for example, reliability
 and incremental and predictive validity. Some of the tests reported here
 derive from the hypothesized predictions presented in the OBSE nomolog-
 ical network, and others reveal information about other properties (e.g., in-
 ternal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity) of a construct-
 valid scale.

 alphas are also shown. Coefficient alphas for all variables in the nomological
 network for organization-based self-esteem reached acceptable levels.

 Reliability Estimates

 Coefficient alphas and test-retest correlations were calculated in order
 to examine the reliability of the OBSE scale. These tests provided us with
 insight into the scale's internal consistency, the homogeneity of scale items,
 and the stability of the scale's measurement across time (Hypothesis 3).

 Internal consistency. Across all seven studies and eight variables, each
 alpha value was equal to or greater than .86, ranging to a high of .96 in study
 4. The average alpha value was .91. The strength of these internal consis-
 tency estimates provides evidence for the homogeneity of the scale items.
 Test-retest reliability. The test-retest reliability coefficient was .75 (p <
 .01). After we controlled for perceived organizational change, the test-retest
 correlation rose to .87 (p < .01). The strength of this association provides
 support for the stability of the construct proposed in Hypothesis 3.

 Convergent Validity

 A construct-valid scale converges more with similar measures of the
 same construct than with measures of substantively different constructs. We
 examined organization-based self-esteem in association with a semantic dif-
 ferential version of the OBSE scale and inspected evidence in support of the
 positive association between OBSE and global self-esteem (Hypothesis 1),
 and OBSE and job- and task-specific measures of self-esteem (Hypothesis 2).
 The two OBSE measures used in the first study correlated .69 with one
 another (see Table 3). With one exception, a correlation of .77 between OBSE
 and organizational satisfaction, this association was stronger in magnitude
 than correlations of OBSE with any of the other non-self-esteem variables
 examined across the seven studies and 26 comparisons. In study 7, global
 self-esteem measured at time 2 had a positive (r = .48, p < .01) relationship
 with OBSE, also measured at time 2, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1. In
 studies 5 and 6, we expected that the OBSE measure would converge more
 with the modified Rosenberg (1965) and Beehr (1976) task-specific self-
 esteem measures than with other study variables. With one exception-
 OBSE and commitment in study 6-this was true. OBSE correlated .54 (p <
 .01) and .57 (p < .01) with the Rosenberg and Beehr scales in studies 5 and
 6 respectively, supporting Hypothesis 2. This pattern of correlations pro-
 vides convergent validity evidence for the OBSE scale.

 Discriminant Validity

 In order to provide additional evidence for the construct's convergent
 and discriminant validity, results from the three self-esteem scales (OBSE,
 Beehr, and Rosenberg) used in studies 5 and 6 were factor-analyzed with
 several other study variables: organizational commitment, job complexity,
 intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational satisfaction. In both

 studies, a two-factor solution emerged, with self-esteem forming one factor
 and affect forming the other (see Table 4). Across the two groups, the three
 self-esteem scales have average loadings of .79 on the self-esteem factor and
 .21 on the affect factor. The other variables averaged .26 on the self-esteem
 factor and .62 on the affect factor. Thus, OBSE associated more strongly with
 other measures of self-esteem than with measures of conceptually distinct
 variables, providing additional convergent validity evidence. The emer-
 gence of the two-factor solution, with OBSE as one factor and measures of
 expected organizational correlates as the second, provides evidence of dis-
 criminant validity for the measurement of organization-based self-esteem.

 Incremental Validity

 Hypotheses 13 and 14 were created in order to demonstrate the incre-
 mental validity of the OBSE scale. The results of tests of these two hypoth-
 eses provided evidence for the predictive efficacy of OBSE in relation to
 other organization-based constructs, organizational commitment and orga-
 nizational satisfaction.

 To discriminate the OBSE measure from measures of task-specific self-
 esteem, the correlations between OBSE and organizational commitment
 were contrasted with the correlations between task-specific self-esteem and
 organizational commitment (Hypothesis 13). In line with the argument for
 consonant levels of analysis, on the average OBSE correlated higher (r = .55)
 with organizational commitment than did the task-specific measures (aver-
 age r = .30), providing support for Hypothesis 13. These differences were
 significantly different (p < .01) on four out of four possible contrasts. Thus,
 findings support the hypothesis that consonant levels of analysis produce
 stronger relationships, though we must also remember that the task-specific
 self-esteem scales were less reliable than our measure of OBSE.

 Hypothesis 14 was also formulated in an effort to discriminate OBSE
 from measures of global self-esteem in the prediction of organization-based
 constructs. We compared the correlation between OBSE and organizational

 satisfaction in study 7 with a similar correlation involving global self-
 esteem. The correlation between OBSE and organizational satisfaction at
 time 2 was .77 (p < .01) and the correlation between global self-esteem and
 organizational satisfaction was .39 (p < .01). Not only does OBSE account for
 44 percent more of the criterion variance than global self-esteem, but the
 difference between these two correlations is statistically significant (p <
 .01). The test of Hypothesis 14 provides further evidence for organization-
 based self-esteem's distinctness from existing measures of self-esteem as
 well as evidence for the use of consonant levels of analysis in self-esteem
 research.

 Predictive Validity

 Tests of Hypotheses 5 and 12 provided evidence for the predictive va-
 lidity of OBSE. We conducted a laboratory experiment manipulating condi-
 tions believed to affect OBSE to test Hypothesis 5, and examined a conse-
 quence of OBSE in a longitudinal correlation between the construct and
 organizational satisfaction to test Hypothesis 12.

 An ANOVA was employed to examine the relationship between social
 system design and organization-based self-esteem. Hypothesis 5 predicted
 that employees experiencing a mechanistic-bureaucratic social system will
 experience a significantly lower level of OBSE than their counterparts in a
 more organic social system. Results from the ANOVA reveal a statistically
 significant (F = 21.58, p < .01) difference in OBSE across the two types of
 organization. Confirming the prediction, those working under the mecha-
 nistic design reported lower levels of OBSE (x = 33.11) than their counter-
 parts working under more organic organizational conditions (x = 41.72).
 Analyses indicated that there were no significant effects on the criterion
 attributable to the order of laboratory experiences.

 The product-moment correlations were inspected to gain clearer insight
 into the relationship between social system structure and OBSE. Six of the
 seven design variables, concern for procedures being the single exception,
 had significant correlations with the OBSE scale (r = -.32, p < .05 to r =
 - .54, p < .01). The direction of these relationships suggests that employees
 exposed to high levels of impersonality, authority, formality, concern for
 control, and inflexibility and to low levels of democracy tend to develop a
 psychological state in which their OBSE is low. Individuals who experi-
 enced a social system with the opposite design features developed high
 OBSE. Because of the strong intercorrelations among the social-system struc-
 ture variables, however, a unit-weight model depicting a mechanistic-
 organic social system design was constructed and correlated with the crite-
 rion (see Table 3). This relationship (r = -.46, p < .01) suggests that as a
 social system becomes increasingly mechanistic, OBSE decreases. This pat-
 tern provides support for the construct validity of our OBSE measure (Hy-
 pothesis 5) and for one of Korman's (1976) major hypotheses.

 Organization-based self-esteem was also hypothesized to predict an em-
 ployee's level of organizational satisfaction (Hypothesis 12). OBSE measured

 at time 1 significantly predicted organizational satisfaction (r = .59, p < .01)
 at time 2, thereby providing support for the positive relationship between
 organization-based self-esteem and employee satisfaction. With the organi-
 zational change that occurred between time 1 and time 2 controlled, this
 relationship was somewhat stronger (r = .70, p < .01).

 Concurrent Validity

 Several hypotheses (4, 6, and 7-11) from the OBSE nomological net-
 work were examined in an effort to inspect the concurrent validity of the
 organization-based self-esteem scale. We positioned variation in job com-
 plexity and managerial respect (Hypotheses 4 and 6) in the nomological
 network as antecedents of organization-based self-esteem. Each of these vari-
 ables had a significant (p < .01) cross-sectional correlation with the crite-
 rion. In fact, inspection of Table 3 reveals that some of these correlations are
 quite substantial in magnitude. The strength of these associations ranged
 between .30 (p < .01) and .52 (p < .01) for managerial respect and between
 .39 (p < .01) and .44 (p < .01) for job complexity. These observations support
 the hypothesized relationships. Employees who experience managerial re-
 spect and complex jobs have higher levels of OBSE than employees who do
 not. Five variables -organizational commitment, organizational citizen-
 ship, general job satisfaction, internal work motivation, and performance-
 were theoretically positioned in the nomological network as consequences
 of OBSE (Hypotheses 7-11). Tests confirmed all hypotheses (see Table 3)
 with one exception: one hypothesis was confirmed on only one of the two
 performance measures used in study 5. The correlation coefficients ranged
 between .15 (p < .05) for job performance (supervisory rating) to .60 (p < .01)
 for organizational commitment (self-rating). Thus, compared to employees
 who experience a low level of OBSE, employees with a high level tend to be
 better organizational citizens and better performers and to have higher job
 satisfaction, organizational commitment, and internal work motivation.

 It might be argued that the correlations between self-report measures
 and organization-based self-esteem were higher than between the non-
 self-report measure and the construct because of methods bias (Schwab,
 1980). We do not doubt that this is partially true. However, all the self-report
 measures used in testing these hypotheses have reasonably well-known psy-
 chometric properties, and thus the impact of method variance is likely to be
 low (Spector, 1987). Moreover, this pattern of correlations could also be due
 in part to the performance appraisal measures having lower psychometric
 quality than the self-report measures. We feel that the magnitude and dif-
 ferential pattern of correlations across measures outweigh criticisms of
 methods bias (cf. Gerhart, 1987).

 DISCUSSION

 Employees with high organization-based self-esteem perceive them-
 selves as important, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile within their em-

 ploying organization. The results of our research on the measurement and
 validation of OBSE across seven studies suggest the importance of the con-
 struct and the viability of our measure of it. Our measure demonstrates
 consistently good internal consistency reliability, homogeneity of scale
 items, and stability over time. This developmental research scale possesses
 appropriate convergent and discriminant validity and reasonable predictive
 and concurrent validity when placed within a nomological network. The
 scale had stronger predictive efficacy in relations with other organization-
 based constructs than measures of global or task- and job-specific self-
 esteem. The evidence presented here supports our belief that OBSE is part of
 employees' belief systems. Both the proposed determinants and conse-
 quences of OBSE were appropriately related to OBSE in the various studies
 reported here. Neither the nature of the respondents involved nor the spe-
 cific instruments used to measure other study variables appeared to substan-
 tially affect these relationships.

 The results of the seven studies reported here suggest that the determi-
 nants of OBSE may include managerial respect, organizational structure, and
 job complexity. Factors influenced by organization-based self-esteem may
 include not only global self-esteem but also job performance, intrinsic mo-
 tivation, general satisfaction, citizenship behavior, organizational commit-
 ment, and organizational satisfaction. It should be noted, however, that only
 two of the seven studies were longitudinal, thereby permitting few conclu-
 sions about causality. These results are not much different from those of
 earlier examinations of self-esteem in terms of the nature of relationships
 revealed: Positive experiences lead to high self-esteem, negative experiences
 lead to low self-esteem. But our results are some of the first to indicate that
 experiences in an organization affect employees' levels of organization-
 based self-esteem, which in turn may affect their organization-related be-
 haviors and attitudes.

 We also provide evidence that using measures with consonant targets of
 perception-here, organization to organization-enhances the predictive
 validity of those measures. In that respect, we encourage researchers inter-
 ested in self-esteem to use a measure of self-esteem that is consistent in
 context (isometric) with the other variables under study. But we also would
 encourage researchers to employ multiple measures of self-esteem to con-
 tinue to ascertain the degree to which different measures possess construct
 validity.

 Although the focus of the studies reported here was construct validation
 and not testing theories of self-esteem, it should be noted that results sup-
 ported all of the study hypotheses. It is clear that future research on organi-
 zation-based self-esteem needs to provide additional longitudinal tests of
 both its determinants and consequences. In a more theoretical vein, we
 believe that our measure of OBSE may yield better predictive efficacy than
 task- and job-specific or global measures of self-esteem in the study of such
 variables as organizational commitment, organizational citizenship, organi-
 zational culture, and organizational climate and satisfaction. For example,

 OBSE may moderate the relationship between organizational commitment
 and job performance in such a way that the relationship between commit-
 ment and performance is stronger for high OBSE employees than for low
 OBSE employees; these relationships would be analogous to the relation-
 ships between task-specific self-esteem, job complexity, and performance
 hypothesized by Tharenou and Harker (1984). In using OBSE in future hy-
 pothesis testing, researchers need to ask themselves whether the way em-
 ployees view their competence in an organization directly or indirectly af-
 fects, or is affected by, other constructs of interest.

 It should also be noted that organization-based self-esteem focuses on
 individuals' assessments of their organizational worth, which stems from a
 history of organizational, interpersonal, and systemic experiences. OBSE
 differs from such value-laden constructs as central life interest (Dubin, 1956)
 and job involvement (Lodahl & Kejner, 1965), which possess higher emo-
 tional-affective components. We also distinguish OBSE from such possible
 outcomes as self-perceptions of efficacy in performing a particular task
 (Bandura, 1977). Self-efficacy is frequently seen as an expectation (efficacy
 expectation) in "the conviction that one can successfully execute the behav-
 ior required to produce the outcomes" (Bandura, 1977: 193). Future research
 should be directed to testing the consequent and antecedent relationships of
 self-efficacy and self-esteem. Future research might also be directed toward
 testing the intervening role of self-efficacy in the relationships between
 OBSE and performance accomplishments, vicarious experiences, emotional
 arousal, and verbal persuasion (cf. Bandura, 1977). Still other research might
 seek to distinguish self-consistency (Korman, 1976), self-enhancement (Dip-
 boye, 1977), and information-screening (Taylor & Brown, 1988) explanations
 for effects of OBSE on organization-based employee responses. Finally, we
 need to learn more about the relative importance of situational factors and
 the attitudes and behavior of others as antecedents to organization-based
 self-esteem and the process through which these determinants operate.

 On the basis of the research reported here, we concur with Korman's
 view that the structural features of work environments can and do send
 strong messages that shape individuals' beliefs about their organizational
 value. There is also evidence suggesting that individuals may well develop
 organizational attitudes and engage in behaviors that are consistent with
 their organization-based self-esteem.
