ABSTRACT
What is transparency, how can it be measured
and what is the relationship between transpar-
ency and corporate reputation? One important
feature of socially responsible entrepreneurship
is the transparent dialogue with stakeholders
about
the policies and activities the company
proposes to pursue in that respect. During such
dialogue, it
to cultivate mutual
understanding and appreciation. A high level of
appreciation increases
conﬁdence
in the enterprise and this in turn reinforces its
positive reputation. An instrument, which can
be of assistance in this process, is an Annual
Sustainability Report. The primary function of
such a report, in communication terms, is to
account for the company’s actions. On the basis
of the above rationale, the central question for
this paper is: What indicators can be used to
measure the transparency value of Annual Sus-
tainability Reports and to what extent does this
value correlate to the reputation (expressed as
the RQ score) of an enterprise?

stakeholders’

WHAT IS TRANSPARENCY?
It is on the basis of the expectations which
the stakeholders nourish in relation to the
company (Fombrun and Rindova, 2000)
that they form an impression of the com-
pany. But listening carefully to what stake-
holders think and want demands conscious
interaction.
there is any discrepancy
between the expectations of those stake-
holders that the company considers to be
important and the company’s own per-

If

ceived identity,
the company will ﬁnd
itself compelled to modify those deviant
elements in its identity. Questions such as:
‘who are we?’ and ‘what do we stand for?’
will need to be answered anew, so as to
bring such issues in line with the relevant
expectations of the stakeholders.

By modifying its identity, and conse-
quently its day-to-day business practices,
the company will be able to align itself once
again with the expectations and interests of
the stakeholders. This will be accomplished
through communication in the form of an
intensive interaction. The interaction will
be a positive reﬂection of the expectations of
stakeholders on the basis of the original and
renewed principles and the tangible and
intangible values on which the company is
based and — at the same time — the opi-
nions of the stakeholders will be reﬂected in
the identity of the company. The company
will, of course, engage in other activities,
which will reﬂect or manifest its identity.
Such activities or conduct validate the con-
tent of the communications and the interac-
tion of the company. Subsequently, this
reﬂection and validation conﬁrms to stake-
holders that what they are observing is actu-
ally so. This entire process describes the
transparency in communications between the
company and its stakeholders.

Transparency is the vehicle by which to
build conﬁdence. Stakeholders acquire such
conﬁdence on the basis of positive experi-
ences. Their

increases and the company’s reputation is
strengthened. In turn, they give the com-
pany the social legitimacy it needs to be
able to operate. This entire process ulti-
mately leads
to a higher market value,
more proﬁt and a stronger competitive
position for the company.

On the basis of the aforementioned prin-

considerations on the issue of transparency,

The task-deﬁning factors can be looked
upon as claims on the company made by
the stakeholders as interested parties. To
account for policies by giving stakeholders
the opportunity to verify the underlying
information is to achieve transparency par
excellence.

The

task-deﬁning factors mentioned
above provide the indicators necessary to
measure the transparency of Annual Sus-
tainability Reports. Three types of trans-
parency indicators have been distinguished:

1 Linguistic indicators: these illustrate the
clarity and accessibility of the text in
terms of structure and style

2 Thematic indicators: these show which
elements or themes form the content of
the report (the what)

3 Depth indicators: these provide insight
into the way in which the company is
dealing with those themes (the how).

The eight transparency indicators are used
to compile the transparency score card.
The score card is a method developed here,
so as to be able to measure the transparency
values of various Annual Sustainability
Reports and to compare them like with
like. The transparency score card is an aid
for stakeholders. All in all, the indicators
represent approximately 50 appraisal cri-
teria. The degree of transparency for each
appraisal criterion is measured on the basis
of the scores on the three-point scale. This

scale measures whether a criterion is pre-
sent in the report, and to what extent.
The transparency value indicates

the
degree to which a particular appraisal cri-
terion contributes to the transparency of an
Annual Sustainability Report. The trans-
parency value of a transparency indicator is
expressed by means of the average score of
all appraisal criteria falling under that indi-
cator. The term ‘transparency maximum’
is used here to describe the total number of
points scored.

The practical applicability of the trans-
parency score card has been evaluated by a
number of pilot testers (evaluators). The
tests were carried out on the basis of a
questionnaire adapted from the Impor-
tance-Delivery-Uniqueness model designed
by Rossiter and Percy (1998). Just like the
I-D-U model,
the appraisal criteria are
considered here to be the ‘beneﬁts’ or
advantages of the transparency score card
as a ‘product’.

Practical Research Transparency
Score Card
The transparency score card has been tested
by
representing
NGOs, the government and private organ-
izations. The corpus of this research consists
of 12 Annual Sustainability Reports from
enterprises in six diﬀerent sectors: the oil
and power industry (Shell and BP), the
foodstuﬀs industry (Unilever and Nutreco),
the ﬁnancial sector (ING Bank and Rabo-
bank), the chemical
industry (BASF and
DSM), the electronics industry (Philips and
Sony) and the consumer goods industry
(Procter & Gamble and Henkel). Nine of
these enterprises also form part of
the
group of companies whose reputation is
appraised periodically by the Reputation
Institute. In order to make a valid com-
parison of the annual reports, they needed
to be divided into two groups for each
particular report year (either 2001 or 2002),
as not all the companies being investigated

had by then published their Annual Sus-
tainability Report for 2002.

Stakeholders’ Appraisal of Transparency
Score Card
The comments made by the evaluators
have led to an approach that is methodolo-
gically correct and provides a transparent
allocation of weighting and scoring. The
chosen approach is based on using a ﬁve-
point scale for the scores instead of a three-
point scale. Such a reﬁnement will consid-
erably enhance the accuracy of the compar-
ison of the transparency aspects of annual
reports.

correct weighting

For the purposes of ensuring a methodo-
allocation,
logically
bearing in mind the three types of trans-
parency indicators (linguistic, thematic and
depth), it is proposed to process the scores
on these three variables
in two stages.
During the ﬁrst stage, the weighting fac-
tors attached to the appraisal criteria will
all be weighted the same: one. The scores
per type of indicator will then be divided
by the total maximum number of points so
as to calculate the scoring percentage for
this category. During the second stage, the
transparency value of the Annual Sustain-
ability Report in question will be calcu-
lated, this will be the sum total of the
scores on all three categories of transpar-
ency indicator. The calculation will be
made on the basis of the following for-
mula:

Transparency value =

(16linguistic indicator in per cent) +
(16thematic indicator in per cent) +

(26depth indicator in per cent)

4

A brief explanation for choosing the 1:1:2
weighting follows. This ratio expresses the
impression that assessing transparency is
more about how things are reported than

what is actually reported. In addition, this
brings the eﬀect of the language and style
on the transparency of the report more in
line with the other two types of indicator
than had originally been the case. This for-
mula produces a transparency value, x,
which lies somewhere between 0 and 1
(0<x<1). The author has called this for-
mula the ‘transparency value formula’.

The evaluators also made suggestions
about changing the formulation of certain
appraisal criteria and adding new criteria to
the score card. The study brought forth
suggestions for ﬁve new linguistic indica-
tors,
four new thematic indicators and
eight new depth indicators (see Appendix
1).

The bookmark system was

seen as a
strong point of the transparency score card.
This makes it easier for the reader to ﬁnd
and return to what he or she has already
read. The score card also provides a good
overall impression of the transparency of a
company. It shows clearly where there are
gaps in the report.

An analysis of the results made it clear
that there are sometimes large diﬀerences
between the scores given by diﬀerent eva-
luators to the same report. Such diﬀerences
arise because one evaluator might have dif-
ferent expectations of the company than
another evaluator. Using the transparency
score card in a particular way can also
aﬀect the outcome.

EXPRESSING TRANSPARENCY VALUES
(SCORES) WITH THE AID OF THE
SCORE CARD
Table 1 shows that the scores for the depth
indicator fall well behind the scores for the
thematic
indicators. The
explanation for this is that socially responsi-
ble entrepreneurship is still a relatively new
phenomenon within many companies. In
compiling their reports, companies concen-
trate ﬁrst on getting their policy themes in
order before going into more depth about

and linguistic

the underlying processes as a way to focus
on the chosen themes.

A second explanation could be that the
scores for the linguistic indicator might be
inﬂuencing the scores for the thematic and
depth indicators. The score for the linguis-
tic indicator, whether high or
is
reﬂected in an equally high (or low) score
on the thematic and depth indicators. The
high scores recorded for Shell and Philips,
and the low scores
for ING Bank and
DSM, in respect of the linguistic, thematic
and depth indicators seem to conﬁrm this
impression.

low,

The ‘best in class’ of the Annual Sustain-
ability Reports for the year 2001 is that
published by Shell, and for 2002 that acco-
lade goes to Philips. Shell’s Annual Sustain-
ability Report has,
the highest
transparency value of all annual reports. As
this report covers the year 2001, it can be
assumed to be the ‘best in class’ of all the
Annual Sustainability Reports reviewed.
This result implies that Shell is at least a

in fact,

year ahead of other companies in the con-
text of sustainability reporting.

The average score of the Annual Sustain-
ability Reports for the year 2001 is 48 per
cent and 51 per cent for the year 2002.
These percentages demonstrate that, by
and large, there are no great diﬀerences in
the quality of the reports over these two
years. The
‘improvement potential’ of
each Annual Sustainability Report can be
easily discerned from Table 1. Theoreti-
cally, this varies from 30 per cent (Shell) to
70 per cent
(ING Bank). The average
potential for improvement of the Annual
Sustainability Reports for the year 2001 is
52 per cent and 49 per cent for 2002 (see
Table 2).

parency values from the Annual Sustain-
ability Reports under

correlation between these two types of
variables is made explicit.

Table 2 oﬀers a convenient comparison
of the transparency values of the Annual
Sustainability Reports published by nine
companies and the companies’ reputation
quotients. The author has not been able to
discover any direct correlation between the
transparency values of the reviewed reports
and the reputation quotients of the compa-
nies. As far as transparency values are con-
cerned, Shell
leads the ﬁeld, and it is a
mid-ﬁeld player in respect of reputation
quotient. Unilever ﬁnishes in the top three
on both lists and the ING Bank brings up
the rear.

This

investigation leads

the author to
propose the following reasons for the lack
of any clear correlation between the trans-
parency values and the reputation quoti-
ents:

— Transparency is just one of the variables
which can inﬂuence
reputation
drivers. Other variables include visibi-
lity, diversity, consistency and authenti-
city.

the

— In addition,

the reputation of any
company is dependent on factors such

Page 112

as the sector in which it is active and its
country of origin.

— The inﬂuence of the variable ‘transpar-
ency’ on various platforms — a.k.a.
reputation drivers — of a company is
not only dependent on the publication
of an Annual Sustainability Report.
Media such as websites and product
information leaﬂets also contribute in
this respect.

— The target group for this investigation
was that of professional stakeholders in
the domain of corporate social responsi-
bility, whereas the target group for any
measurement of
reputation by the
Reputation Institute was consumers.

CORRELATION BETWEEN
TRANSPARENCY APPRAISAL CRITERIA
AND REPUTATION DRIVERS
Besides the process of comparing the trans-
parency values of the Annual Sustainability
Report with a company’s reputation quoti-
ent, there is also another method of gaining
more insight into the inﬂuence of trans-
parency on reputation. That method
involves using the transparency values of the
various indicators to reveal the inﬂuence of
the Annual Sustainability Report on the

reputation drivers,

In comparing the 49 assessment criteria
of the eight transparency indicators with
the 20 reputation items which underlie the
six quotient
almost
without exception, the reputation items of
the six reputation quotient drivers have a
contextual correlation with one or more of
the transparency appraisal criteria. With
the exception of the indicator ‘Communi-
cation demands on structure,
style and
design of the publication’, each transpar-
ency indicator contained at least one criter-
ion which could be related to a reputation
item. All
in all, 16 of the 20 reputation
items comprise one or more contextual
correlations with the appraisal criteria of
various transparency indicators (see Appen-
dix 2).

But not all transparency appraisal criteria
have a correlation with the reputation
items. The overall number of appraisal
criteria relating to the thematic indicator is
20, while 17 criteria have a correlation
with a
reputation item. The overall
number of appraisal criteria relating to the
depth indicator is 23, and 12 of these —
around half — have a correlation with a
reputation item. The most substantive con-
notations exist
in connection with the
reputation items of the drivers ‘vision and

and

It will now be interesting to
establish how great an impact the transpar-
ency value of each Annual Sustainability
Report has on each of the three reputation
quotient drivers.

TRANSPARENCY SCORE OF ANNUAL
REPORTS ON REPUTATION QUOTIENT
DRIVERS
Table 3 indicates the transparency value or
scores of the appraisal criteria which have a
contextual correlation with the reputation

items of the three reputation quotient dri-
vers speciﬁed above.2 Subsequently, these
scores were converted into a single ﬁgure
which indicates the impact of the three
reputation quotient drivers on the overall
transparency score for each annual report. In
other words: the degree to which the trans-
parency of the annual reports inﬂuences the
creation of reputation in respect of each of
these drivers. For the purposes of this calcu-
lation, the individual scores of the appraisal
criteria for the thematic and depth indicators
were used. The linguistic indicator has been
left out of the equation, because this bears
no direct relation to any reputation item
nor, consequently, to any driver.

Shell’s score of 0.18, for instance, indi-
cates the degree to which the transparency
value or score on its Annual Sustainability
Report can aﬀect the level of the com-
pany’s reputation in respect to the driver
‘vision and leadership’. A score of 0.18
means that 18 per cent of the total trans-
parency value of the annual report, which
has the potential to aﬀect the reputation
quotient driver
‘vision and leadership’,
really does have an impact on the com-
pany’s reputation as far as this aspect is
concerned. The remaining ﬁgures3 can be
interpreted in the same way.

WHAT IS NOTICEABLE?
If the average score per reputation quotient
driver is considered, the Annual Sustain-
ability Reports are found to have the
greatest
‘socially
responsible business practices’ (0.13), fol-
lowed by ‘vision and leadership’ (0.12) and
the least eﬀect on ‘the organization as an
employer’ (0.09).

eﬀect on the driver

The ﬁndings of this study show that, in
all annual reports, the depth indicator is the
one which has the most eﬀect on the driver
‘vision and leadership’, while the thematic
indicator has more inﬂuence on the drivers
‘socially responsible business practices’ and
‘the organization as
an employer’. A

cautious conclusion could be that because
of transparent reporting the thematic indi-
cators
in particular are becoming more
signiﬁcant with regard to inﬂuencing the
reputation of a company in terms of
corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
the
particularly
signiﬁcant with regard to inﬂuencing the
corporate reputation in the domain of
vision and leadership. As far as the reputa-
tion driver ‘organization as an employer’ is
concerned, there is still much scope for
improvement
of
Annual Sustainability Reports. In view of
the low scores,
it is safe to assume that
there is little to read on this subject in the
body of annual reports studied.

Unilever is runner up on the driver
‘vision and leadership’, but scores much less
well on the driver ‘the organization as an
employer’.

Another result worthy of note is the top
ﬁve score of the Rabobank as far as the
drivers ‘socially responsible business prac-
tices’ and ‘the organization as an employer’
are concerned, while this company’s report
as a whole is ranked only eighth for trans-


parency value. The Annual Sustainability
Report of the Rabobank apparently fulﬁlls
a number of transparency criteria which
have a contextual correlation with reputa-
tion items.

The generally high transparency values
on the thematic indicator are reﬂected in
the score on the reputation quotient driver
CSR/socially responsible business practices.
The overall impact of the transparency of
Shell’s Annual Sustainability Report on the
reputation quotient drivers varies from 13
to 18 per cent. This is clearly well above
average. Setting this score against the back-
ground of the all-round reputation of the
company makes it seem relatively insigniﬁ-
cant, but when it is considered that only a
single means of communication is being
looked at, it is certainly quite respectable.

Another noticeable ﬁnding was that the
inﬂuence of the transparency of nearly half
of
the annual reports on one particular
reputation quotient driver was far lower
than that on the other two drivers.
It
might be interesting to investigate whether
this diﬀerence can be attributed to any par-
ticular and conscious policy decisions.

All

in all, the scores returned in this
study into the impact of the transparency
of an Annual Sustainability Report on a
reputation quotient driver were low. There
are three main reasons for this.

The ﬁrst reason is that no single annual
report achieved a 100 per cent score, as can
be seen on the transparency score card.

The second is that only a small propor-
tion of the total number of transparency
appraisal criteria has any direct contextual
link with the
reputation items which
underlie the reputation quotient drivers.
For instance, the maximum possible score
of all the appraisal criteria in the thematic
indicator category which have a link with
the driver ‘vision and leadership’
is only
one-tenth of the maximum possible trans-
parency value on the thematic indicator: 4/
40 = 0.10 or 10 per cent.4

Piechocki

The third reason is that, as yet, not all
Annual Sustainability Reports include all
the thematic and depth indicators. These
indicators can have a direct contextual cor-
relation with reputation items.

Given the limited scope of this investiga-
tion, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd concrete statistics,
which demonstrate the impact of the trans-
parency values on the reputation drivers.
The author can, however, give an indication
(or sensitivity analysis) on the basis of the
results of the research. The ﬁndings show
that
correlation
between the thematic and depth indicators
of an Annual Sustainability Report on the
one hand and the drivers ‘vision and lea-
dership’,
responsibility’
and ‘the organization as employer’ on the
other hand. Further research would prob-
ably provide a better insight into the corre-
lation between the transparency indicators
in relation to corporate reputation.

CONCLUSIONS
— The methodology of the original trans-
parency score card was too imprecise.
This has now been modiﬁed and it has
been possible to derive a formula for
transparency value.

— The average score of the annual reports
for 2001 is 48 per cent and the average for
2002 is 51 per cent. There was no signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in performance between
the reports
for 2001 and 2002. The
average potential for improvement of
the annual reports is around 50 per cent.

CSR thematic: 18/40, CSR depth: 4/46, organiza-
