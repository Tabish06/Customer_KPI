ABSTRACT 

From analyses of the direct effects of  10 quality action programs on six firm perfor- 
mance outcomes, as well as their indirect effects through eight quality performance 
dimensions, two routes from action programs through quality performance to firm per- 
formance in the automotive supply industry are identified. The first is the product qual- 
ity route, whose landmarks are superior quality performance on Conformance and 
Design Quality dimensions; the second is the relationship quality route, with superior 
Customer Responsiveness and Service. Both the product quality and the relationship 
quality routes lead to superior ROI; the former also leads to enhanced ROA, and the lat- 
ter to enhanced market share performance. Associated key action programs are Commit- 
ted Leadership, Cross-Functional  Quality Teams, Employee Empowerment, Supplier 
Development, and Closer Customer Relationships. The first three are internally focused, 
while the latter two are boundary-spanning supply chain programs. 

Subject Areas: Automotive  Supply Industry, Manufacturing  Strategy,  Quality, 
and Survey Research. 

INTRODUCTION 
Based on the pioneering work of  Deming (1982, 1986), “Total Quality Manage- 
ment” (TQM) has become pervasive; over 90% of  America’s  largest 500 firms 
have adopted TQM methods (Arthur D. Little, Inc., 1992; Benson,  1993). Several 
studies posit that unless the principles of TQM are adopted as a set, firms will be 
unable to compete globally (Womack, Jones, & Roos,  1990; Sluti,  1992; Shetty, 
1993; Handfield,  1993; Powell,  1995; Easton & Jarrell,  1998). In addition, the 
Malcolm Baldrige Award (U.S.) and others all identify sets of practices.  Recent 
research poses questions, however, about whether TQM practices are really so 
interdependent and whether they really impact performance outcomes. For exam- 
ple, Powell (1995) found that only executive commitment, open organization, and

employee empowerment-out of  12 TQM factors-were 
actually correlated with 
firm performance. Building on this work, Dow, Samson, and Ford (1999) found 
that only workforce commitment, shared vision, and customer focus related with 
conformance (their one quality performance outcome), and only customer focus 
was significant in the baseline model with all nine original dimensions. 

Our research extends this recent work by (1) identifying the direct effects of 
10 quality-related action programs on eight quality performance measures (not just 
conformance) and (2) identifying the direct and indirect effects of these 10 action 
programs on six firm performance measures through the relevant quality perfor- 
mance dimensions. Quality performance measures are viewed as intermediate out- 
comes, since ultimately it is overall firm performance that matters (see Figure 1). 
We  sample the automotive supply industry to test our model. 

This paper is organized as follows. The relevant literature is reviewed to 
identify key variables as well as the effects of TQM programs on quality versus 
firm performance. The research methodology is described next, and the results of 
correlations and standardized partial beta analyses are presented. Finally, manage- 
rial implications are explored. 

MODEL VARIABLES 
The next section draws upon the literature to describe the variables used in our 
research model. These variables include quality action programs (the independent 
variables), the quality performance variables, and the firm performance variables. 

Quality Action Programs: The Independent Variables 
Three different streams of TQM literature were reviewed: (1) anecdotal (e.g., 
Deming’s Management Methods, 1986; Juran’s Quality Trilogy, 1993; Crosby ’s 
14 Quality Steps, 1979); (2) empirically based research (e.g., Saraph, Benson, & 
Schroeder, 1989; Flynn, Schroeder, & Sakakibara,  1994; Powell,  1995; Ahire, 
Golhar, & Waller, 1996; Dow et al.,  1999); and (3) formal assessment processes 
(e.g., IS0 9000, The Deming Award, Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award; 
see Curkovic & Handfield, 1996). Ten key action programs resulted, thoroughly 
covering the people, process, and integration aspects of TQM (see Table 1). Indus- 
try  experts from the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), in Southfield, 
Michigan, confirmed their relevance to the first tier automotive suppliers whom 
we later sample. These 10 programs are the independent variables in our study. 

Quality Performance 
Garvin (1984b, 1987, 1988) identified eight “competitive dimensions of quality,” 
which we adapted taking into account subsequent empirical work and consulta- 
tions with our panel of AIAG experts (see Table 2). Product Reliability, Product 
Durability, and Conformance to Specifications were taken directly from Garvin 
(1987). Garvin’s Performance, Features, and Aesthetics were combined to form a 
single quality dimension called Design Quality (see Forker, Vickery, & Droge, 
1996). Company Reputation was seen as an appropriate proxy for Garvin’s Per- 
ceived Quality dimension because “reputation is the primary stuff of perceived

quality” (Garvin, 1987, p. 107). Garvin’s serviceability dimension was divided into 
Pre-Sale  Customer Service and Product Support (or post-sale  customer service) 
based on advice from our AIAG panel. In addition, Responsiveness to Customers 
extends Garvin ’s conceptualization of customer service to encompass responsiveness 
to potential customers, and fits the quality literature’s current emphasis on customer- 
related performance (e.g., Dow et al., 1999). Thus, we extend current literature by 
considering three different customer-related quality performance measures. 

Firm Performance 
We examine six measures of overall firm performance (see Figure 1). The first four 
measures are financially based (e.g.,  ROI, ROA), while the last two are market- 
share based. It was important to have different firm performance measures because 
firms’ strategic emphases are different (Droge, Vickery, & Markland,  1994; Miller 
& Roth,  1994). For example, a penetration strategy may sacrifice ROI for market 
share.

MODEL RELATIONSHIPS 
The next section describes the different relationships hypothesized within our 
research model. These include: (1) the relationship of action programs to quality per- 
formance; and (2) the relationship of action programs to overall firm performance. 
The Relationship of Action Programs to Quality Performance 
TQM pioneers such as Deming, Juran, and Crosby devoted considerable attention 
to identifying key practices that impact quality performance. Other authors also 
focused on anecdotal examples and case studies (e.g., Pegels,  1995; Thomas, 
1989; George & Weimerskirch, 1994). Some empirical studies compared U.S. ver- 
sus Japanese quality management practices (Garvin, 1984a, 1986; Ebrahimpour, 
1985), while others (e.g., Ferdows & DeMeyer, 1990) compared high versus low 
performers to identify sets of individual quality action programs. Other studies 
related aggregate use of  action programs to overall quality performance (e.g., 
Saraph et al., 1989; Flynn et al., 1994). 

However, two recent studies question the assumption that quality action pro- 
grams have to be implemented together. First, Powell (1995) examined TQM per- 
formance (as well as firm performance) and 12 TQM programs. Only executive 
commitment, open organization, and employee empowerment produced signifi- 
cant partial correlations with performance. Building on Powell’s work, Dow et al. 


Curkovic, Vickery, and Droge 

89 1 

(1999) empirically developed nine dimensions from a sample of 698 from a vari- 
ety of  industries. Only the “workforce commitment,” “shared vision,” and “cus- 
tomer focus” dimensions were significant individual predictors of a conformance 
construct. Also, Dow et al. concluded that the “best practices” model, which aggre- 
gates action programs as was done in past research, was the weakest of all; how- 
ever, in the best fitting model, only “customer focus” was significantly related to 
quality. Dow et al. (p. 25) stated: “[Ilf too many nonessential practices are attached 
to an overall quality improvement agenda, this may disillusion people and under- 
mine the support for the overall program.” 

Overall, anecdotal evidence and, certainly, the extensive use of  TQM by 
industry suggest payoffs exist, but past empirical research has found mixed results. 
Not all action programs appear to be related to quality performance outcomes, but 
aggregates (means, sums, or weighted sums of action program measures) usually 
are related to quality outcomes. However, a very limited list of quality perfor- 
mance outcomes (usually only conformance) has been scrutinized in the past, and 
Dow et al. (1999) called for research using other outcomes. We propose to examine 
which of  10 quality action programs affects which of eight dimensions of quality 
performance. Thus, 

HI:  Each  quality  action  program  is  positively  related  to  each 

dimension of quality performance (see Figure 1). 

The Relationship of Action Programs to Overall Firm Performance 
Results from past research, most of which has been case studies, have been equiv- 
ocal at best. Some studies have shown TQM to have no effects or even negative 
effects on firm performance (Tomow & Wiley, 1991; Burrows, 1992; Fuchsberg, 
1992a, 1992b; Mathews, 1992). For example, 80% of  over 100 British firms and 
close to two-thirds of 500 U.S. companies experienced no competitive gains from 
TQM (The Economist, 1992). Other studies claim to find positive effects on firm 
performance (e.g., Adam, 1994), at least for some quality action programs. For 
example, corporate culture was found significant by Handfield and Ghosh (1994), 
and executive commitment, open organization, and employee empowerment were 
found significant by Powell (1 995). 
One difficulty is measuring or detecting the impact of action programs on cor- 
porate profitability or other firm-level performance outcomes (Bowels & Hammond, 
1991; Evans, 1992; Hiam, 1992). The effect of a quality action program on firm per- 
formance (which is the final outcome) could be indirect through quality perfor- 
mance, which is an intermediate performance outcome. Thus, 

H2:  Quality-related action  programs are  positively  related  to  firm 
performance either (a) directly, or (b) indirectly through quality 
performance, or (c) both (see Figure 1). 

We  extend past research by basing our approach on a two-prong analysis. 
First, we examine the relationship of each action program with each of six mea- 
sures of  firm performance using R2 analysis from simple regressions. This is 
equivalent to correlational analysis. Second, we examine the relationship of each 
action program to each measure of firm performance after controlling for the effect 


892 

Quality-related Action Progranis 

of quality performance on firm performance. This analysis of standardized partial 
betas from hierarchical regression takes into account that (I) action programs can 
have a direct effect on either quality performance or firm performance (or both) 
and (2) action programs can have an indirect effect on firm performance  (i.e., 
final outcome measures) through quality performance (i.e., intermediate outcome 
measures). 

METHODOLOGY 
The next section describes the methodological issues such as sample selection, the 
research questionnaire, and measurement. 

Sample 
The sampling frame was defined as the top 150 (in terms of annual sales) indepen- 
dently owned first-tier suppliers to General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. These 150 
suppliers account for over 90% of the purchasing sales volume by North American 
automakers. The automotive industry was selected because it is a major “battle- 
field” in the quality wars (Cole, 1990; Eastman, 1995; Ahire et al., 1996). First-tier 
suppliers were selected because: (1) they represent a wide variety of process types 
and technologies;  (2) they compete against each other, forming a distinct open 
market; and (3) they are under great pressure to meet quality standards such as QS- 
9000. 

The unit of analysis is the Strategic Business Unit (SBU). Chief Executive 
Officers (CEOs) were mailed questionnaires (accompanied by  explanatory let- 
ters), and repeated follow-up telephone calls were  used. The most often-cited 
reason for noncompletion  was lack of time, followed by  company policy. Also, 
early versus late respondents were compared, and no differences  were found at 
a = .05. 
The sample size was  57 firms (response rate = 38%). Mean  sales were 
$50 1 3  16, and the mean number of employees was 2,810 . The mean percentage of 
SBU sales direct to North American OEMs was 83.67%. 

Research Questionnaire and Measurement 
Our AIAG panel of experts assisted in the development and pre-testing of the sur- 
vey instrument. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each of the 
10 programs listed in Table 1 was being used (or to circle “Not Used”). The 7-point 
scale had endpoints of  1 for Extremely Low Use of  Action Program and 7 for 
E.urremely High Use of  Action Program. Descriptive statistics are listed in Table 1. 
Quality performance relative to major competitors was measured on scale 
with endpoints of  1 for Poor- and 7 for Excellent. The results are found in Table 2. 
Conformance quality and product reliability have the highest means, which is con- 
sistent with past research (e.g., the 1996 Manufacturing Futures survey; see Kim, 
1996). 

Firm performance was measured using six common financial and/or market- 
ing indicators: (1) pre-tax return on assets (pre-tax ROA mean = 4.904); (2) after- 
tax return on assets (after-tax ROA mean = 4.962); (3) return on investment (ROI 


Curkovic, Vickeiy, and Drdge 

893 

mean = 5.078); (4) growth in  ROI (mean = 4.528); ( 5 )  market  share (mean = 
4.850); and (6) growth in market  share (mean = 4.8 18). Performance evaluation 
was a subjective assessment: the 7-point scale had endpoints of  1 for Worst In 
Industry and 7 for Best In Industry. The validities of these six scales were verified 
by correlation analyses with objective measures  (e.g., actual ROI), which were 
obtained from about half the sample. 

RESULTS 
The next section describes the results of our empirical analysis. The results focus 
on the following model relationships:  (1) quality-related action programs and the 
eight dimensions of quality performance; (2) quality-related action programs and 
six measures of firm performance; and (3) whether the action programs affect firm 
performance after controlling for quality performance. 

Quality-related Action Programs and the Eight Dimensions of Quality 
Performance 
The ordinary correlations are listed in Table 3a. We can obtain a rough index of the 
pervasiveness of an action program’s impact by  simply counting column-wise the 
number of significant  correlations: Committed Leadership, Cross-Functional 
Quality Teams, Closer Customer Relationships, and Supplier Development are 
related to four or more of the eight quality performance dimensions (supporting 
HI). A second way to interpret Table 3a is to do a row-wise count, indicating how 
many of the 10 action programs actually have an impact on a particular dimension 
of quality performance.  Conformance, being correlated  with 8 of  10 programs, 
stands out. Responsiveness to Customers is at 7 of  10, Company Reputation  at 5, 
Design Quality at 4, and the others at less than 4 of  10. 

Quality-related Action Programs and Six Measures of Firm Performance 
The ordinary correlations of each of the  10 action programs with each of the six 
firm performance measures are shown in Table 3b. Looking at this table column- 
wise first, two patterns that stand out: ( 1 ) Committed Leadership, Measurement, 
Quality Training, and SPC are correlated with none of the firm performance mea- 
sures; (2) Continuous Improvement is correlated with every financial measure as 
well as market share. If we examine Table 5b row-wise, a third pattern stands out: 
5 in 10 programs affect market share and 3 in 10 affect its growth, while only 1 in 
10 affect ROI, 2 in  10 for ROI growth, 3 in  10 for Pre-Tax ROA, and 2 in  10 affect 
After-Tax ROA. 

Do Action Programs Affect Firm Performance After Controlling for 
Quality Performance? 
We now turn to the question of  whether action programs affect firm performance 
(final outcomes) after controlling for the  indirect effects through  quality  perfor- 
mance (intermediate outcomes). The eight quality performance measures and six 
firm performance measures are themselves related (see Table 4). To illustrate our 
approach, consider Cross-Functional Quality Teams. The use of teams is correlated

with: (a) the four intermediate-level, quality performance  outcomes of Conform- 
ance, Design Quality, Product Support, and Responsiveness to Customers (Table 
3a); and (b) the firm performance outcome of Market Share (Table 3b). However, 
Table 4 shows that Product Support and Responsiveness to Customers are corre- 
lated with Market Share at .371 (p < .Ol) and .314 (p < .05), respectively. A hierar- 
chical regression was run with Market Share as the dependent variable, the four 
intermediate outcomes as independent variables, followed by Quality Teams as the 
last independent variable. The standardized partial beta estimate for Quality Teams 
was .239, which is significantly greater than zero at p = .062. 

The Quality Teams analysis is summarized in Table 5. Note that Table 5 has 
“n.a.” for “remaining direct effects” under all columns except Market Share, since 
the analysis was done only for the one dependent variable significant in Table 3b. 
For Continuous Improvement, in contrast, five regressions were conducted, one 
for each of Pre-Tax ROA, After-Tax ROA, ROI, ROI Growth, and Market Share 
(the five significant in Table 3b). The independent variables were Conformance, 
Company Reputation, and Responsiveness to Customers (the three significant in 
Table 3a), followed by Continuous Improvement.  Only for Market Share was the 
standardized partial beta for Continuous Improvement significantly greater than 
zero (std. beta = .199, p  = .085); for Pre-Tax ROA (.195), After-Tax ROA (.173), 
ROI(.170),andROIGrowth(.169), all hadp > .lO(n.s. inTable5).Thus,forMar- 
ket Share there is a direct effect after controlling for the relevant intermediate qual- 
ity performance outcomes (indicated by  “x”  in Table 5), but the effects of 
Continuous Improvement on the other firm measures are indirect only. Similar 
regression analyses were conducted for the other action programs.

For Empowerment, with ROI Growth as the dependent variable, the standard- 
ized partial beta was  .I87 @ = .098); with  Market Share Growth, it was .254 
(p = .030). Thus, Empowerment had a direct effect even after controlling for the rel- 
evant intermediate outcomes. For Benchmarking: (1) for Pre-Tax ROA the standard- 
ized partial beta was .209 (p = .075); (2) for After-Tax ROA it was .242 (p = .047); 
and (3) for Market Share it was .333 (p = .009). Thus, Benchmarking had positive 
direct effects even after controlling for the one relevant control variable. Concerning 
the analyses involving Supplier Development: for Pre-Tax ROA and Market Share 
Growth, respectively, the standardized partial betas were .129 and. 139 (p > .lo), but 
for Market Share, the beta was significantly greater than zero (.239, p  = .048). For

Quality-related Action Programs 

Closer Customer Relationships, the standardized partial beta was .204 (p =.084) in 
the regression involving Market Share, and. 146 0, > .lo) in the regression involving 
Market Share Growth. Overall, there is some support for H2. 

DISCUSSION 
In the discussion that follows, we highlight some of the patterns observed from our 
analyses; that is, some “paths” of impact that were observed frequently. Overall, 
we must echo Powell (1995) and Dow et al. (1999) in saying that not all action pro- 
grams have pervasive direct effects, but many have indirect effects. 

Product Quality: Conformance and Design 
One “path” of impact that stands out can be described as follows: Action program 
usage affects Conformance, which in  turn affects ROI. This pattern of direct 
impact on Conformance and indirect impact on ROI was observed for 8 of the  10 
action programs (only for employee empowerment and benchmarking was this 
sequence not observed).The importance of  Conformance comes as no surprise 
since automotive manufacturers have been pressuring first-tier suppliers for years 
to significantly reduce defects. Furthermore, virtually every researcher in quality 
includes Conformance as a key dimension of quality performance (e.g., Garvin, 
1987), and often it is the only one actually measured. However, the empirical evi- 
dence that all or most action programs affect Conformance has not been over- 
whelming. For example, Dow et al. (1999) found that only three of  nine were 
correlated with conformance, compared to the 8 of  10 found in this research on 
automobile OEM suppliers. 

In conjunction with Conformance, the intermediate outcome of Design 
Quality deserves mention. Together, these constitute the core of product quality 
since conformance to a poor design can hardly be expected to have a positive 
impact on firm performance. Four of the action programs affect both Conformance 
and Design Quality: Cross-Functional Quality Teams, Committed Leadership, 
Closer Customer Relationships, and Supplier Development. Design Quality, in 
turn, affects ROA and ROI. Note that: (1) product quality as reflected in both Con- 
formance and Design Quality affects primarily financial (as opposed to market) 
measures; and (2) the action programs affecting both span the supply chain from 
supplier to internal to customer locus, but they reflect the “soft aspects of the qual- 
ity management practices” (Dow et al., 1999, p. 23). 

Finally, consider Product Reliability and Product Durability, which taken 
together affect five of  six firm performance measures (the exception is ROI 
Growth). These are mentioned frequently in the quality literature (Garvin, 1987, 
1988; Ahire et al., 1996) and are certainly relevant to our sample of auto suppliers. 
However, only Committed Leadership affected Reliability, and only Supplier 
Development affected Durability. We can speculate that auto suppliers may be tar- 
geting prespecified reliability and durability levels, and that the goal in implement- 
ing action programs is to achieve conformance to these prespecified levels. Our 
result may be specific to industries structured similarly to the automotive supplier 
industry, or it may be that there is reason to question the relationships of action pro- 
grams to these dimensions of quality performance. 


Curkovic, Vickery, and Droge 

899 

Relationship Quality: Responsiveness and Service 
Another path of  impact that was observed frequently was the following: Usage of 
the action program affects Responsiveness to Customers, which in turn affects ROI, 
ROI Growth, Market Share, and Market Share Growth. This sequence was seen for 
7 of the 10 action programs (exceptions are Quality Training, SPC, and Benchmark- 
ing). The importance of Responsiveness to Customers, as it relates to relationship 
quality, is clear: If  action programs are a “strategic resource” set (Powell, 1995), 
then their impact should extend beyond product quality alone. Our results demon- 
strate the extensive impact on relationship quality (and through this, on firm perfor- 
mance) and, thus, we confirm links often hypothesized in the literature (Crosby, 
Evans, & Cowels, 1990; Noordewier, John, & Nevin, 1990; Leuthesser & Kohli, 
1995; Dow et al.,  1999). 

Pre-Sale Customer Service and Product Support (or post-sale customer ser- 
vice) are additional aspects of relationship quality. Together, these affected every 
measure of firm performance, and were affected by  half of the action programs. 
For Cross-Functional Quality Teams, Committed Leadership, Closer Customer 
Relationships, and Employee Empowerment, paths existed through both Respon- 
siveness to Customers and either Pre- or Post-Sale Customer Service. For manag- 
ers, this implies that customers are not the domain  of  marketing or sales 
departments alone. Rather, certain quality action programs can impact the entire 
exchange between organizations. 

Quality Products, Quality Relationships 
We have argued that Conformance and Design Quality are two key dimensions of 
quality products, and that Responsiveness to Customers along with Pre-Sale Ser- 
vice and Product Support are key dimensions of quality relationships. Some action 
programs’ effects on firm performance are through both the “product quality” 
route and the “relationship quality” route. In particular, the following action pro- 
grams affect both dimensions of product quality and two of the three dimensions 
of relationship quality: Cross-Functional Quality Teams, Committed Leadership, 
and Closer Customer Relationships. These three tap the same types of dimensions 
found in Powell (1995) and/or Dow et al. (1 999) (who especially focused on the 
latter). We support their contention that not all quality action programs are equally 
important in terms of their effects on performance. In addition, for our sample of 
auto OEM suppliers, ( 1) Supplier Development affects both dimensions of product 
quality and only the Responsiveness dimension of customer relationship quality; 
and (2) Employee Empowerment, while it has no impact on product quality, affects 
two of the three dimensions of quality relationships. 

Together, the five action programs identified above tap internal management 
for quality (Teams, Empowerment, Leadership), as well as management of the 
supply chain for quality (both upstream as reflected in Supplier Development and 
downstream as reflected in Closer Customer Relationships). A supply chain per- 
spective, comprising suppliers+the  firm itself+customers,  is becoming increas- 
ingly relevant to managers and researchers alike. In the marketplace, one can view 
competition itself as competition between supply chains.

Quality-related Action Programs 

The impact of these five action programs is ultimately  seen on every firm 
performance measure, with paths through “product quality” dimensions targeted at 
ROI and ROA, and paths through “relationship quality” dimensions targeted at 
ROI and Market Share. Only by measuring different aspects of firm performance 
(or any other type of performance) can such patterns be detected. The multidimen- 
sional nature of performance, with different aspects being differently affected by 
key antecedents,  is an important consideration both  in  the design of academic 
research and in the design of performance feedback control systems. 

LIMITATIONS 
Because this was a single-industry  study, we did not consider environmental 
uncertainty, competitive intensity, or industry munificence. Future studies might 
also focus on objective rather than subjective data. Caution must be exercised in 
assuming that our results would hold for objective quality performance data (e.g., 
defective parts per million), objective productivity measures, or objective firm 
performance (such as actual ROI). 

A final comment is in  order concerning the external validity of our study 
(Le., the ability to generalize its results). A drawback of this study is its relatively 
small  sample size in  a single industry, since external validity  is more easily 
achieved in a cross-industry study. However, a profile of the firms within the auto- 
motive supply industry highlights the diversity of the products manufactured. 
Firms in the sample ranged from manufacturers of entire seating systems to man- 
ufacturers of anti-lock braking systems. Thus, the external validity of the results is 
not as severely compromised by our single-industry focus as it would be for a more 
homogeneous industry group. [Received: March 4, 1998. Accepted: October 22,
