This  longitudinal  study  examines  the  effect  of  human  resources  strategy  on  the  export 
performance  of  388  Florida  firms.  After  controlling  for  dijferential  firm  advantages, 
managerial perceptions  and  aspirations,  and  marketing  activities,  results show that the  way 
human resources  are selected,  deployed,  compensated and  motivated  will play  a significant 
role  in subsequent  export performance. 

The’ trade deficit in the United States has reached 
dramatic  proportions  in  the  late  1980s.  While 
exports  have  lagged  behind  imports  since  the 
1960s, the  rate  of  increase  in  the  trade  deficit 
has been  growing at an alarming rate during the 
last decade. Total U.S. imports exceeded exports 
by  5.6 billion dollars in  1976. The gap had  risen 
to  69.4  billion  dollars  in  1983,  and  by  1986 it 
exceeded  120 billion  dollars  (U.S.  Department 
of  Commerce,  1986). The  United  States  ended 
1986 in  debt  to  the  rest  of  the  world  by  more 
than 263 billion dollars  (International  Monetary 
Fund,  June  1987). This  means  that  the  U.S.  is 
now  by  far  the  world’s  largest  debtor  nation, 
surpassing Brazil and Mexico, each of  which owe 
about 100 billion dollars (International Monetary 
Fund, June  1987). 

Some are concerned that the U.S. economy could 
become  ‘hostage  to  foreign  investor’s  whims’ 
(Associated Press, 1986); others feel that this trend 
must be reversed if  balance growth is to be achieved 
in  the  economy  (Cavusgil,  1984).  In  addition to 
their  effect  in  offsetting  the  debit  items  in  the 
balance of payments, increased exports are essential 
to generate more employment opportunities, speed 
technological and market  innovations, and reduce 
political pressures within the U.S. to impose trade 

restrictions  that  may  precipitate  an  international 
trade war  (Johns, 1985). 

While  a  growing  number  of  politicians  and 
union  leaders,  as  well  as  a  few  academics,  are 
arguing  that 
the  U.S.  should  employ  neo- 
mercantilist  measures  to  generate  a  favorable 
international 
restricting 
imports,  the  consensus  among  most  experts  is 
that  the  best  way  to  redress  the  trade  deficit 
problem is to stimulate exports rather than restrict 
imports (Cavusgil, 1984; Johns,  1985). 

trading  position  by 

There  is  increasing  evidence  that  behavioral 
factors internal to the firm have a definite impact 
on  a  firm’s  export  performance.  Surprisingly, 
there  has  been  very  little,  if  any,  empirical 
research  on  the  role  that  human  resources 
play  in  the  successful implementation  of  export 
strategies. This study focuses on the relationship 
between  human  resource management  strategies 
designed  to  support  international  activities and 
the firm’s export performance.  To this end, this 
study  utilizes  a  longitudinal  research  design  to 
empirically  assess  the  explanatory  power  of 
human  resource  management  practices as deter- 
minants of  export performance, after controlling 
for  a  number  of  organizational  and  managerial 
characteristics known to  affect foreign sales.

THEORETICAL  FRAMEWORK 
Determinants of export performance 
It  is  estimated  that  only  about  10 per  cent  of 
all  U.S.  manufacturers  have  ever  been  active 
exporters,  a  percentage  that  lags  way  behind 
most  industrialized  nations,  and  that  at  least 
20,000  small  firms in  the U.S. have  potential  to 
export competively, but  do not do so (Report of 
the  U.S. Senate Committee on  Small  Business, 
1982). 

Three general explanations  have  been offered 
as to why  U.S. firms  that  manufacture  products 
which  could  be competitive  in  price  and quality 
in  foreign  markets  are  simply  not  selling  their 
product  abroad.  One  of  the  earliest  arguments 
is  that  the  relatively  large  size  of  the  domestic 
market has deterred American firms from getting 
embroiled in  unfamiliar  and risky  foreign  trans- 
actions  (Blough,  1966).  This  explanation, how- 
ever,  is  less  valid  today  in  view  of  growing 
competition created by foreign companies produc- 
ing  and  marketing  in  the  U.S.  (Cooper  and 
Kleinschmidt , 1985). 

The  second  explanation  concerns  external 
factors  beyond  the  firm’s  control,  such  as  the 
lack of  macrolevel  incentives,  subsidized  foreign 
goods, unfavorable exchange rates, or the absence 
of a stimulating national export policy. While the 
determinants  of  exports  at  the  aggregate  level 
have  been  actively  researched,  empirical  results 
are mixed and generally disappointing (e.g. Ayal, 
1982; Green and Lutz,  1980; Hirsch,  1970). In  a 
recent  review  of  this  literature,  Cavusgil  (1984) 
concluded that ‘external factors, such as exchange 
rate,  level  of  domestic  and  foreign  demand, 
relative  rates of  price-level  increases,  and  com- 
mercial  policy  proved  to be poor predictors  of  a 
firm’s  export  behavior’  (p.  4).  Furthermore, 
Cavusgil  (1984)  argued  that  ‘in order  to  under- 
stand variations  among firms with  respect  to the 
existence  and  the  extent  of  export  activity  one 
must explore some crucial factors within  the firm 
and its management’  (p. 4).  Similar conclusions 
were  reached  in  a  1986 commissioned  report  to 
the  Congressional  Joint  Economic  Study  by  a 
Washington international  consulting firm, Quick, 
Finan  and  Associates  (Greenberg,  1986).  This 
suggests a third approach to understanding export 
performance-one  which  emphasizes  variables 
that are internal rather than external to the firm. 
The  internal  determinants of  export perform- 

ance identified  in the literature may be classified 
into three general  categories.  The first  group of 
factors  pertain  to  differential  firm  advantages. 
Though  not  sufficient  by  themselves  to  initiate 
export  activities,  these  unique  advantages  may 
serve  as  ‘attention  evokers’  or  predisposing 
factors  causing  the  firm  to  consider  foreign 
markets  as  a  possible  outlet  to  its  products 
(Wiedersheim-Paul,  Olson  and  Welch,  1978; 
Cooper and Kleinschmidt,  1985). 

Empirical  findings  suggest  that  firms  tend  to 
be more actively involved in exporting the larger 
their  size  (Daniels  and  Goyburo,  1977; Hirsch, 
1970;  Hirsch  and  Zvi,  1974; Tookey,  1964);  as 
they  get  older  (Bilkey,  1982);  the  more  they 
are  able  and  willing  to  adapt  their  products/ 
technology  to  meet  local  needs  (Daniels  and 
Goyburo,  1977;  Kacker,  1975;  Pinney,  1970; 
Tessler, 1980; Cooper  and  Kleinschmidt,  1985); 
the greater their R&D expenditures as a percent- 
age  of  total  operating  costs  (Ayal,  1982;  Lutz 
and Green,  1983; Balassa,  1977; Baldwin,  1971; 
Branson,  1971; Gruber and Vernon,  1970; Low- 
inger,  1975);  the  greater  the  extent  to  which 
major  products  are at  the  ‘growth’ stage of  the 
life  cycle  (Lutz  and  Green,  1983);  the  more 
management  perceives  economic  conditions  in 
international  markets  as  favorable  rather  than 
detrimental to the firm (McGuiness, 1978; Hirsch 
and Baruch,  1974; Kacker,  1975; Bilkey,  1982); 
and the more international exposure top manage- 
ment  has  received  through  such  activities  as 
licensing agreements, joint ventures, international 
conferences,  living  abroad, etc.  (Simmonds  and 
Smith, 1968; Langston and Teas, 1976; Wieders- 
heim  et  al. , 1978). 

A  second  group  of 

internal  determinants 
affecting  export  performance  consists  of  mana- 
gerial perceptions  and  aspirations.  For  the  most 
part  these  variables  reflect  top  management’s 
psychological  predisposition  toward  exporting. 
These  include:  risk  perceptions  (Simpson  and 
Kujawa,  1974; Bilkey  and Tesar, 1977; Orgram, 
1982;  Kizilbach  and  Maile,  1977);  profitability 
expectations  (Cavusgil,  Bilkey  and Tesar,  1979; 
Cavusgil  and Nevin,  1981; Orgram, 1982; Kedia 
and Chhokar, 1985; Daniels and Goyburo, 1977; 
Hirsch and Baruch, 1974; Schoeffler, Buzzell and 
Heany,  1974);  extent 
to  which  international 
involvement  is viewed  as a  key element in  firm’s 
future plans and goals (Kedia and Chhokar, 1985; 
Pinney,  1970;  Cunningham  and  Spiegel,  1971; 


Human Resources  Strategy  and  Export  Performance 

Bilkey  and  Tesar,  1977);  and  strength  of  aspi- 
ration for various business goals, including growth, 
profits  and market development (Cavusgil, 1984; 
Cooper and  Kleinschmidt,  1985). 

The third  group of  internal factors impacting 
export performance concerns the jirm’s approach 
to foreign  markets. Companies tend  to be more 
successful in their export attempts if  they engage 
in  systematic exploration of  international oppor- 
tunities  (Cunningham  and  Spiegel,  1971;  U.S. 
Department  of  Commerce,  1977; Wiedersheim- 
Paul et al.,  1978), and when substantial resources 
are  devoted  to  the  export  marketing  function 
(Hunt, Frogatt  and  Hovell,  1967; Reid,  1981). 

Role  of  human resource management 
As indicated  earlier, the role of  human resource 
management as an internal determinant of  export 
performance has not been explicitly examined in 
the  literature.  This  is  an  important  research 
area  from  an  applied  as  well  as  an  academic 
perspective. 

As compared with selling in the home market, 
the  behaviors  involved  in  selling  to  multiple 
countries (each with its distinct social, geographi- 
cal,  and  commercial  characteristics)  are  clearly 
more complex and demanding. In a classic paper, 
Tookey  (1964)  noted  that  the  best-performing 
firms  in  terms  of  foreign  sales  were  able  to 
engage the entire organization  in  export-related 
activities. Successful exporting demands the active 
cooperation  of  most  subunits,  for  example  of 
design  for  the  development  of  new  styles  to 
satisfy overseas customers; of  production for the 
making  of  samples  and  the  fitting  in  schedules 
of  export orders (after facing potential problems 
of  machine  changes  for  short  runs  and  incon- 
venient delivery dates); of the accounting depart- 
ment to handle complex credit  arrangements for 
foreign  customers  and  the  documentation  of 
overseas  payment;  and  of  the  office  to  handle 
overseas  orders,  correspondence  in  a  foreign 
language,  and  the  very  numerous  and  lengthy 
export 
invoices  and  other  documents.  This 
process requires the synergistic utilization of  most 
organizational  resources  and  cannot  be  treated 
as a  peripheral function. 

About  a  decade ago, the U.S. Department of 
Commerce  developed  a  position  paper  (1977) 
outlining  the  major  impediments  that  prevent 
U.S. firms from maximizing their foreign market 

495 
potential. The key impediments revolved around: 
(a)  lack  of  knowledge  of  foreign  markets, busi- 
ness practices,  and competition; and  (b)  lack  of 
management  commitment  to  generate  foreign 
sales.  The  striking  feature  of  the  above  obser- 
vations is that these impediments can be attributed 
to  a  large  extent  to  poor  utilization  of  human 
resources within  U.S. firms,  and not  to external 
factors. This paper  contends that  these  barriers 
may be substantially  reduced through an aggres- 
sive  human  resource  management  strategy  that 
emphasizes  an 
in 
staffing,  employee  development,  performance 
evaluation,  and  reward  distribution  within  the 
firm. 

international  orientation 

As  a  scarce  strategic  resource, human  capital 
must  be  allocated  carefully  within  the  exporting 
organization. The staff  process plays an essential 
role  in  creating  the  stock  of  human  capital 
necessary to deal with the external contingencies 
posed by overseas markets that call for specialized 
knowledge  and  experience requirements  in  the 
workforce.  For  firms  trying  to  expand  their 
foreign  sales,  international factors  should  there- 
fore be explicitly considered  when making those 
decisions  related  to  the  internal  movement  of 
people  across  positions  and  the  external  hiring 
into the organization. This would  entail defining 
the  organization’s  human  needs  in  terms  of  its 
international  business  objectives  and  assessing 
the  available  pool  of  people  to  determine  the 
best fit in the selection, promotion, and placement 
process.  As  noted- by  Edstrom  and  Lorange 
(1984),  it  can  be  far  more  important  in  an 
international firm to have the right people in the 
right  slots  than  to  focus  excessively  on  the 
financing  decisions of  resource  allocation. 

In order to reduce the impediments to exporting 
noted  earlier,  it  is  also  essential  to  match  the 
corporation’s  strategic  interest  in  international 
markets  with  the  goals,  competence, and  moti- 
vations of  key  actors in  the organization. 

Activities  designed  to  ensure  that  individuals 
are properly  equipped with  skills and knowledge 
to carry out their jobs in an international  context 
fall into the management development  category. 
These  activities  may  range  from  simple  job 
training  for  lower-level  employees  to  long-term 
development of  senior employees.  Three  major 
areas  of  the  developmental process  that  would 
enhance  a  firm’s  ability  to  compete  in  global 
markets  would  include:  (1)  programs  designed 


496 

L. R.  Gornez-Mejia 

to  provide  specific job  skills  and  competencies 
in  international  business;  (2)  opportunities  for 
individual growth  and development  in  the inter- 
national  field  and  (3)  the  use  of  appraisal 
processes  that  explicitly  consider  international 
activities as part  of  performance  reviews. 

Even though self-development depends largely 
on the manager’s internal drives and motivation, 
an organization trying to expand its foreign sales 
must  encourage  self-development  in  directions 
that are consistent with the international strategy 
of  the firm. This would be particularly important 
when  it  comes  to  career  ladders  within  the  so- 
called ‘internal labor market’, because managers 
and executives are more likely to engage in those 
activities  that  they  feel  are  instrumental  to 
their future advancement within the organization 
(Tichy, Fombrun and Devanna,  1982). 

The  reward  structure  of  a  firm  is  another 
crucial  human  resource  management  system 
that,  if  designed  properly,  may  induce  key 
organizational players  to take  full  advantage  of 
the  company’s  export  potential.  The  rewards 
provided  by 
the  organization  contingent  on 
for-eign sales  may  be  both  of  a  monetary  (e.g. 
pay  incentives)  and  non-monetary  nature  (e.g. 
status symbols, power  and  influence). 

Reward systems are one of the most prominent 
and  frequently  discussed  features  of  organi- 
zations.  Indeed,  the  literature  in  organizational 
behavior  and  personnel  management  is  replete 
with examples of their functional (e.g. Balkin and 
Gomez-Mejia, 1984) as well as their dysfunctional 
(e.g. Whyte, 1955) role in organizations. Research 
suggests  that  reward  systems  exert  a  powerful 
signaling  effect  on  a  firm  by  conveying  to 
employees  what  the  company  considers  to  be 
most  crucial  (Milkovich  and  Newman,  1987). 
This has several important behavioral implications 
for  the  exporting firm. 

First,  people  in  organizations tend  to  behave 
in  accordance  to  what  they  perceive  leads  to 
rewards  they  value  (see  Vroom,  1964; Hinkin, 
Podsakoff and Schriesheim, 1987). By reinforcing 
desired  export-related  behaviors,  managerial 
commitment  to foreign sales is likely to increase 
and,  by  inference,  greater  attention  will  be 
devoted to skill development, information gather- 
ing,  and  scanning  the  environment  to  identify 
international  opportunities.  Thus  an  exporting 
firm  which  is  able  to  tie  valued  rewards  to  the 
behaviors  it  needs  to  succeed  in  its  export 

activities is likely to find that the  reward  system 
is a positive contributor to its export performance. 
Second,  reward  systems  are  one  of  the  most 
important features of  an organization that  helps 
shape  its  overall  culture  or  climate.  They  can 
influence  the  degree  to  which  it  is  seen  as  a 
bureaucratic-oriented culture, an entrepreneurial 
culture,  an  innovative  culture,  a  competence- 
based  culture, or a political culture (see Lawler, 
1973,  1981,  1982). Likewise,  one  would  expect 
that the way people  (in particular managers)  are 
paid, recognized and evaluated will clearly affect 
the extent to which the organization’s culture has 
a  global  or domestic  orientation. 

The reward system of  an organization can also 
reinforce and define the organization’s structure 
(Tosi, Rizzo and Carroll,  1986). For example, it 
can  help  define  the  status  hierarchy,  the  most 
desirable career ladders and the degree to which 
managers  responsible  for  international  activities 
can  influence other  people  in  the  company.  To 
the extent that international subunits are not an 
integral part  of  the mainstream  of  the firm, one 
would expect them to have very limited influence 
on  corporate  strategic plans  and  actions. 

In summary,  there is a clear need to focus on 
export growth and human resource  management 
in a unified context. They ought to be considered 
together  for  staffing,  employee  development, 
performance  appraisals  and  rewards.  To  the 
extent that human resource strategies are included 
implicitly in the articulation  of  export strategies, 
the  more  successful  a  firm- is  likely  to  be 
in  international  markets.  Put  another  way,  a 
company  that  clearly  reinforces  international 
activities  in  its  human  resource  management 
practices  (particularly  for  managerial  and  pro- 
fessional employees)  is more  likely to  do better 
in  its  export  attempts.  This  leads  to  the  central 
hypothesis  of  this  study:  after  controlling  for 
organizational  and  managerial  characteristics, 
human resource management  strategies will have 
a significant effect on a firm’s export performance. 

METHOD 
Sample 
The  sample  used  for  this  longitudinal  study 
consists of  388 Florida  manufacturing firms. The 
data  from  these  firms  were  collected  in  two

separate  stages.  During  the  first  phase  of  data 
collection,  1300 exporting  firms  registered  with 
the  U.S. Department  of  Commerce were  asked 
to  complete  a  40-item  questionnaire  measuring 
managerial  and  organizational  characteristics  as 
well  as  human  resource  management  practices. 
A total of 501 usable questionnaires were received 
(38.54  percent).  The  second  wave  of  data 
collection  took  place  30  months  later.  During 
this second phase, each of the firms in the original 
sample was  asked  to complete a set of  questions 
pertaining  to 
its  export  performance.  Both 
questionnaires were sent to the Chief  Executive 
Officer  of  each firm. Three hundred  and eighty- 
eight  firms  responded  to  the  follow-up  survey 
(i.e. a 77.45 percent return rate). This two-stage 
data  collection  procedure  enabled  us  to  use 
information  from  the  initial  survey  to  predict 
subsequent export performance. 

Descriptive  statistics  for  the  final  sample  are 
shown  in  Table  1. As can  be  seen in  that  table, 
the  sample  includes  a  broad  cross-section  of 
exporting  firms  in  terms  of  age,  sales,  export 
intensity, life-cycle  stage, and  markets.  Because 
the  manufacturing  companies  included  in  the 
study were limited  to a particular  state, a certain 
degree of  homogeneity was built into the sample. 
This sampling approach is preferable because  all 
firms  are  confronted  with  the  same  tax  system, 
state  government,  similar  proximity  to  primary 
export  markets, and  other environmental forces 
that tend to condition them in relatively the same 
way  (Cavusgil  and Nevin,  1981). 

Predictors  of  export  performance 

The  items  included  in  the  initial  survey  came 
from  three  separate sources:  (a)  existing  scales/ 
measures  used  by  previous  researchers;  (b)  an 
extensive  review  of  the  literature;  and  (c)  40 
in-depth case  studies of  Florida  firms  conducted 
by eight MBA interns under the direction  of  the 
author.  The  case  studies,  supported  by  a  Title 
VI grant from the U.S. Department of Education, 
proved 
to  be  very  helpful  as  a  source  of 
information  for writing  items  and for pre-testing 
the  survey  instrument  with  a  sample  of  60 
managers from these  firms. 

The  questionnaire included  a  set  of  15 objec- 
tive-type  items  (e.g.  dollar  sales)  and  a  set  of  25 
Likert-type  scales. For the latter set, a five-point 
response format asked each oarticiDant to indicate 

the  extent  to  which  he/she  agrees  with  each 
statement:  (1)  ‘strongly  disagree”;  (2)  ‘mildly 
agree’; 
disagree’; 
( 5 )  ‘strongly  agree’. 

(3)  ‘neutral’; 

(4)  ‘mildly 

The responses to the 25 Likert-type items were 
factor-analyzed by the principal axis method with 
the squared multiple  correlation  as the estimate 
of  communality  (SPSS,  1975).  Seven  factors 
reached the eigenvalue criterion of  1.0 or higher. 
This  factor  structure  was 
then  rotated  via 
the  varimax  procedure.  The  rotated  solution, 
including  those items that loaded highly  on each 
factor (0.40  or higher), is shown in  Table 2. 

Factor scores were calculated by:  (a)  selecting 
only  the  items  with  salient  loadings  on  each 
factor and multiplying  the salient factor loadings 
by  the  standardized  responses  for  those  items 
(this, in effect, weights the responses by the factor 
loadings); (b)  adding the weighted responses into 
a  total score; and  (c)  converting  the total  score 
into  a  z  statistic.  This  approximation  procedure 
for computing factor scores is  recommended by 
leading  authorities  in  the  field  (Gorsuch,  1974; 
Schmidt,  1971;  Wackwitz  and  Horn,  1971).  It 
tends to produce factor scores that intercorrelate, 
yet have stable interrelationships  across indepen- 
dent samples, whereas exact procedures tend to 
be  less  stable and  generalizable  across  different 
samples  (Gorsuch, 1974). 

terms  of  status  and 

As  can  be  seen  in  Table  2,  the  first  factor 
includes  seven  items  that  measure the extent to 
which  human  resource  strategies  within  the firm 
(in 
influence,  financial 
rewards, hiring, promotion, training and develop- 
ment,  and  performance  appraisal) 
implicitly 
incorporate  an  international  dimension.  These 
seven  items  were  added  to  form  a  composite 
‘human resources strategy’ factor score according 
to the weighing  procedures outlined  above.  The 
Crombach  alpha  for  this  composite  was  0.92, 
indicating  a  high  degree of  internal  reliability. 

It  should be noted that all of  the items in  the 
‘human  resources  strategy’  factor  focus  on  the 
visible  extrinsic  rewards  and  programs  that  an 
organization  controls, and  that  can  as  a  matter 
of  policy  and practice be applied to members on 
a  targeted  basis.  The  fact  that  all  seven  items 
loaded highly on a single factor indicate that they 
are  not  stand-alone variables.  This  is  consistent 
with  an  emerging  literature which  suggests  that 
human  resource  policies  and  programs  tend  to 
be  ‘coherent’  or- ‘congruent’ with  each  other.

According  to  Lawler  (1982):  ‘There is consider- 
able evidence that they [human resource manage- 
ment  practices]  affect  each  other  and  as  such, 
the  same  types  of 
need  to  be  supportive  of 
behavior,  reflect  the  same  overall  managerial 
philosophy,  and  be  generated  by 
the  same 
business  strategy’  (p.  15). 

For  each  firm,  the  resulting  human  resource 

factor score was used as an independent variable 
in  a  regression  equation  to  predict  subsequent 
export  performance.  The  remaining  six  factors, 
as well  as several organizational and  managerial 
characteristics,  were entered as control variables 
in  the regression  equation.  A s  per  the literature 
review,  these  control  variables  were  grouped  as 
follows:

L. R.  Gomez-Mejia 

Differential firm  advantages 
Two  factors  emerging  from  the  factor  analysis 
were  included  here:  ‘technology  adaptability’ 
(Factor  6)  and  ‘adverse  economic  conditions  in 
international  markets’ (Factor 7). The following 
demographic variables were also included in this 
category: 

Age  of  firm  (in  years). 
Size of  firm  (in  dollar  sales). 
R&D intensity-this  was measured as the 
percentage  of  total  operating costs  spent 
on research  and development. 
Stage  in  life  cycle-this  was  defined  in  a 
manner similar to that of  Hambrick (1981, 
1983)  and  Hofer  (1975).  Firms  were 
categorized  as  ‘mature’  (coded  as  0)  or 
‘growth’ (coded  as  l), (see Appendix  for 
scale). 
Foreign  exposure  by  the  firm’s  manage- 
ment  (see Appendix for scale). 

Managerial perceptions  and  aspirations 
Two  factors  emerging  from  the  factor  analysis 
were  grouped  in  this  general  category:  ‘risk- 
avoidance  (Factor  2)  and  ‘international  orien- 
tation  of  firm’s future  plans  and  goals’  (Factor 
3). In addition to these two factors, the following 
two  measures  of  managerial  perceptions  and 
aspirations  were  also  included  in  the  study: 
‘profitability  expectations’  and  ‘attitude  toward 
growth,  profit,  and  market  development’  (see 
Appendix for these two scales). 

Marketing  activities 
Two composite factor scores were used to assess 
the  firm’s  international  marketing  activities: 
‘systematic exploration  of  marketing  opportuni- 
ties’  (Factor  4)  and  ‘commitment  to  foreign 
advertisinghnternational  marketing’  (Factor 5). 

Export performance 
Measures  of  export  performance  for  each  firm 
were gathered 30 months after the predictor data 
described above had been obtained from the first 
survey.  Because  the  same  time  period  applies 
equally to all firms, environmental variables (such 
as  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  the  dollar  and 
changes  in  the  inflation  rate)  are  less  likely  to 

distort  the  findings. This longitudinal  procedure 
also minimizes the contaminating effect of method 
variance which tends to plague much of the cross- 
sectional export management research  (Cavusgil, 
1984). 

Three  measures  of  export  performance  were 
included  in  the  follow-up  survey:  changes  in 
international  market  share,  changes  in  export 
intensity or the percentage of  annual dollar sales 
due  to  exports,  and  export  intensity  relative  to 
industry  (see Appendix  for scales).  All  three of 
these were relative  export performance ratios for 
each  firm  based  on percentage  change over  the 
base year  or in  comparison  to competitors. This 
procedure  tends  to  reduce  the  possibility  of 
tautological  findings,  which  is  more  likely  to 
happen  when  absolute  performance  indicators 
are used  (e.g.  ‘a firm devotes more resources  to 
export marketing the higher its volume of  export 
sales’). 

Each  of  the  three  performance  measures  was 
converted  into  a  standardized  (2) statistic.  For 
each  firm  the  three  z  scores  were  then  added 
into a single performance composite. This scaling 
procedure  is  justified  on  the  basis  of  the  high 
intercorrelation among these three variables. The 
average  correlation  for  these  three  measures, 
using the Fisher  z  transformation, was 0.79. The 
Crombach  alpha  for  the  composite  scale  was 
0.82. 

Analysis 
A  stepwise  multiple  regression  model  was  used 
to test for the significance of  the human resource 
strategy score (Factor l), as a predictor of  export 
performance,  after  controlling  for  differential 
firm  advantages,  managerial  perceptions  and 
aspirations,  and  marketing  activities.  This  step- 
wise  procedure  provides  the  most  conservative 
test for the human resource measure in terms of 
explained  variance  in  export  performance. 

RESULTS 

Table  3  summarizes  the  regression  results.  As 
can  be  seen  in  that  table,  the  human  resource 
strategy  variable  is  statistically  significant  at 
pa0.001.It has a Pearson correlation of  0.537 with 
export  performance,  and  it  accounts  for  an 
increase in R2 from 0.492 to 0.583 when entered

last  step  in 

as  a 
the  regression  equation. 
Therefore, the empirical results strongly support 
the central hypothesis  of  this  study. 

The  data  reported  in  Table  3  also  confirm 
some of  the previous  cross-sectional  findings  by 
Cavusgil,  Bilkey  and  others.  It  appears  that 
‘internal  determinants’  are  powerful  predictors 
of export performance. Firms are more successful 
in  their  export  attempts  as  their  technological 
flexibility  and  R&D  intensity  increases,  when 
they  are  at  the  growth  stage  in  the  life  cycle, 
and  when 
top  management  has  high  profit 
expectations and is willing to take risks. Likewise, 
export performance improves if  the firm provides 
an  international  orientation  to  its  future  plans 
and  goals,  and  engages  in  aggressive  foreign 
marketing  campaigns. Other company character- 
istics,  such  as  age,  size,  and  previous  foreign 
exposure, did not seem to have much of an effect 
on export performance  in  this  sample. 

CONCLUSIONS  AND  DISCUSSION 
In  summary,  human  resource  management  strat- 
egies  have  a  significant  effect  on  a  firm’s 
subsequent  export  performance.  These  findings 
are  consistent  with  the  widespread  contention 
that  real  barriers  to  a  firm’s  involvement  in 
export activities  are largely  internal  rather  than 
external to the firm  (Cavusgil,  1984). 

This  study  strongly  suggests 

that  human 
resource  limitations  may  be  underestimated  by 
American firms in their export attempts. A direct 
implication of  the findings of  this study for public 
policy  is  that  aggregate  measures  to  stimulate 
exports  will  not  be  sufficient  unless  they  are 
coupled by appropriate human resource measures 
taken  at the individual  firm  level.  If  the U.S. is 
going  to  compete  successfully  in  international 
markets,  deep changes would  have  to be  made 
in the way human resources are presently utilized.

L. R.  Gomez-Mejia 

Based on 40 case studies conducted by  a research 
team  under  the  author’s direction,  it  was found 
that  most  firms  tend  to  relegate  international 
activities to departments that are low in prestige 
and  outside  the  mainstream  of  the  corporation. 
In another study, Gomez-Mejia and Balkin (1987) 
found  that  there  is  a  widely  held  belief  among 
managers that an international career path is one 
of  the  least  desirable  directions  to  take  for  an 
upwardly mobile executive.  As a result, the best 
managers and those employees with high potential 
may  become  reluctant  to commit  themselves  to 
a firm’s international  plans  if  they  are unable  to 
see  how  their  individual  aspirations  match  the 
firm’s strategies. 

This deplorable situation may not be any better 
in those educational institutions from which most 
entry-level managers are hired. Business schools’ 
training  at both the undergraduate and graduate 
level is  still very  parochial  at  most  universities, 
with  international  business  being  treated  as  a 
high  specialized  area  offering  few  employment 
prospects  upon  graduation  (Ryans,  Stuhldreher 
and Woudenberg,  1979; Reber, 1986). 

Approximately  ten  years  ago,  Business  Week 
(1978:  35)  reported  that  ‘many corporate  man- 
agers feel that exports are marginal business . . . 
the  U.S. is  a  reluctant  exporter’.  In  late  1987, 
Time  magazine,  in  a  special  report,  reached  a 
similar  conclusion:  ‘the  majority  of  the  U.S. 
executives  still  see  their  main  competition  as 
domestic rather than foreign. Too many business 
leaders fail to recognize the global marketplace’ 
(Time  19 October,  1987: 47).  While the  reasons 
for  the  current  state  of  affairs  are  many  and 
complex, it  is clear that human  resources  can be 
better deployed, developed and rewarded so that 
present  trends may  be  reversed. 

This study has three main limitations, although 
these  may  be  overcome in  future  research.  The 
first one is that  all  the  data were  gathered  from 
a single state. It would be interesting to replicate 
the  study  on  a  national  sample.  Secondly,  one 
may  wish  to  examine  the  relative  explanatory 
power of external determinants of export perform- 
ance,  along  with  the  organizational  variables 
included  in  this  study.  Ideally,  this  will  require 
a  longitudinal  research  design  that  incorporates 
changes in  such ‘environmental’ variables  as tax 
incentives for exporters, export tariffs,  exchange 
rates and inflation. Studies of  export performance 
among a sample of  firms over time should lead to 

a better understanding of the internationalization 
process,  and  the  dynamics  of  how  internal  and 
external  factors interact. Third, the  set  of  seven 
items used  to capture human  resource strategies 
could  be  expanded  to  obtain  more  detailed 
measures of  the policies and procedures used by 
these  firms.  Because  paper-and-pencil  surveys 
were  used,  the  author  had  to  balance  out  the 
desire  for  additional  ‘richness’ in  the  data  with 
the  time  constraints  required  to  maximize  the 
participation  rate  from  the  CEOs.

APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL 
DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED 
OPERATIONAL MEASURES USED 

Stage  in  life  cycle 
A  company’s  stage  was  coded  as  a  dummy 
variable  according  to  one  of 
the  following 
categories (as indicated  by  respondents): 

1. Mature stage: products or services familiar to 
vast majority of prospective users. Technology 
and  competitive  structure  are  reasonably 
stable. 

2.  Growth stage: sales growing at  10 percent  or 
more  annually in  real terms.  Technology and 
competitive  structure  are still changing. 

Foreign  exposure 
This  was  measured  as  a  dummy  variable.  Each 
respondent  answered  a  binary  question  asking 
whether  or  not  top  management  has  been 
involved  in  international  dealings  other  than 
exports  per  se,  e.g.  offshore  manufacturing, 
licensing agreement, joint venture. This item was 
coded  1 for yes  and 0 for  no. 

ProJitability  expectations 
Each participating  firm was asked to report  how 
profitable  its  export  sales  are  expected  to  be 


Human  Resources  Strategy  and  Export  Performance 

relative  to domestic  sales.  The response  format 
consisted  of  a  five-point scale: ‘much less’,  ‘less’, 
‘about equal’, ‘more’, ‘much  more’. 

Attitude toward growth, profit  and  market 
development 
The scale  used  for this  dimension  is  a  modified 
version  of  Miles  and  Snow’s  taxonomy  which 
ranges  from  a  very  aggressive  business  strategy 
on  the  one  hand  to  a  very  passive,  reactive 
posture on the other hand (Miles and Snow, 1978; 
Snow and Hrebiniak, 1980). Each respondent was 
asked  to  check  which  of  the  following  best 
describes  the  firm:  (a)  ‘We  try  to  be  the  “first 
mover”  in  new  product  and  market areas, even 
if  some  of  our  efforts  fail’.  (b)  ‘We  prefer  to 
maintain  secure  positions  in  relatively  stable 
product or service areas. Emphasis is on protect- 
ing  our  market  share’. (c)  ‘We  are seldom first 
in  new  product  and  markets  but  are  often  fast 
followers’.  (d)  ‘We  tend  not  to  have  a  well- 
defined  growth  strategy.  We  feel  that  we  can 
react  to changes well, once these are clear to us. 
As  a  rule,  we  prefer  to  let  others  assume  the 
risks  of  new  product  or market  development’. 

Changes  in  market share 
Each participating  firm was asked to indicate the 
extent  to  which  the  international  market  share 
for  its  major  products  had  changed  during 
the  previous  30  months.  The  response  format 
consisted  of  nine  equal  intervals,  ranging  from 
‘decreased by more than 30 percent’ to ‘increased 
by  more  than  30  percent’,  with  a  ‘remain  the 
same’ neutral point. 

Changes  in  export  intensity 
In both the initial and follow-up survey each firm 
was  asked  to  report  the  percentage  of  annual 
dollar  sales  due  to  exports.  These  two  figures 
were used  to compute the percentage change  in 
export intensity  between the two time  periods. 

Export  intensity  relative  to  industry 
Each firm  was  asked to indicate  the  ratio  of  its 
percentage  annual sales  due  to exports  (PASE) 
relative 
its  main 
competitors in  the industry. Use of  this measure 

to  the  average  PASE  of 

503 
helps  sidestep  the  necessity  for  evaluating  the 
firm’s producthndustry characteristics in terms of 
export potential by  providing  a  referent  relative 
to other similar firms (Hunt ef a f . ,  1967). While 
this  information  may  be  somewhat  speculative 
because  competitor’s  data  may  not  be  readily 
available,  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  infer  that 
these  estimates are  useless.  Subjective  business 
judgements regarding a firm’s export performance 
relative  to other firms may  be  as meaningful  as 
cost  accounting  measures (Bilkey,  1982).
