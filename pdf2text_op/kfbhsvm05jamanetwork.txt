Background: Justice is a fundamental value in human
societies, but its effect on health is poorly described. We
examined justice at work as a predictor of coronary heart
disease (CHD).

Methods: Prospective occupational cohort study of 6442
male British civil servants aged 35 to 55 years without preva-
lent CHD at baseline in phase 1 (1985-1988). Baseline
screening included measurements of conventional risk fac-
tors. Perceived justice at work and other work-related psy-
chosocial factors were determined by means of question-
naire at phases 1 and 2 (1989-1990). Follow-up for CHD
death, first nonfatal myocardial infarction, or definite an-
gina occurring from phase 2 through 1999 was based on
medical records (mean follow-up, 8.7 years).

experienced a high level of justice at work had a lower
risk of incident CHD than employees with a low or an
intermediate level of justice (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95%
confidence interval, 0.47-0.89). The hazard ratio did
not materially change after additional adjustment for
baseline cholesterol concentration, body mass index,
hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, and
physical activity. Although other psychosocial models
such as job strain and effort-reward imbalance pre-
dicted CHD in these data, the level of justice remained
an independent predictor of incident CHD after adjust-
ment for these factors.

Conclusion: Justice at work may have benefits for heart
health among employees.

Results: Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for
age and employment grade showed that employees who

tal questions concerning so-
cial relations and the organi-
zation of society have been
suggested to be concerned
with equity, altruism, and a sense of fair-
ness.1-4 Negative reactions to injustice have
been shown to prevail in human societies
and even in cooperative nonhuman pri-
mates, such as monkeys.5,6 One line of re-
search in this field focuses on work-
places and the concept of justice at work.7,8
Employees’ interactions with their su-
pervisors, on whom they may be highly de-
pendent for resources and rewards, can be
important for well-being.9-11 An indicator
of justice at work is whether people be-
lieve that their supervisor considers their
viewpoints, shares information concern-
ing decision-making, and treats individu-
als fairly and in a truthful manner.8 A high
level of justice in such managerial treat-
ment has been related to increased em-
ployee motivation and cooperation and de-
creased levels of psychological distress,
negative emotions, and sickness absence

(J.E.F., M.K., J.H., M.J.S., and M.G.M., un-
published data, December 2004).12-14

There are plausible mechanisms con-
necting justice to CHD, as a high level of
justice may reduce the risk of chronic stress
characterized by adverse neuroendo-
crine changes, alterations of autonomic
functioning, development of the meta-
bolic syndrome and insulin resistance, and
disturbances in coagulation and inflam-
matory and immune responses.15-18 In-
deed, data concerning employees with
multiple supervisors show smaller blood
pressure elevations on days worked un-
der a supervisor perceived as fair as
compared with days worked under one
perceived as unfair.19 In addition, a cross-
sectional observational study found re-
duced heart rate variability for those
reporting a low level of justice at work

diac dysregulation,20 no previous study, to our knowl-
edge, has examined whether justice at work is associ-
ated with the onset of CHD.

Data from the Whitehall II Study of British civil ser-
vants, an ongoing large-scale prospective occupational
cohort study,21 have enabled our examination of the
association between perceived justice and morbidity
and mortality. A strength of the study is the possibility
of determining incidence of CHD for the entire cohort
based on comprehensive medical records of CHD
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and defi-
nite angina during a long period. A further advantage
is that the data include measurements of conventional
risk factors and major work-related psychosocial fac-
tors such as job strain and effort-reward imbalance.22-24
These data enable us to determine whether the addi-
tion of justice would add to risk estimates based on
other risk factors. In the present study, we examined
whether justice at work predicted incidence of new
CHD among employees and whether this association
was independent of coronary risk factors, including
cholesterol concentration, hypertension, body mass
index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, physical
inactivity, and other psychosocial characteristics of the
work environment.

METHODS

PARTICIPANTS

The target population of the Whitehall II Study was all office
staff based in London, England, aged 35 to 55 years, in 20 civil
service departments.21 With a 73% participation rate, the base-
line cohort included 6895 men and 3413 women. The present
study included those 6442 men (93% of all male participants)
who responded to the justice questions at phase 1 or 2 and had
no history of CHD at phase 2. All of these men were followed
up for CHD after phase 2. The 453 men excluded were older
(39.3% ⱖ50 years vs 23.1% among included men; P⬍.001),
and they were more likely to be in the lowest employment grade
(15.5% vs 8.9%; P⬍.001). We restricted the analyses to men,
as there were insufficient incident CHD events among women
(n=85).

DESIGN

The Whitehall II Study is a prospective observational cohort
study. Justice at work, job strain, and effort-reward imbalance
were measured at phases 1 (1985-1988) and 2 (1989-1990).
Follow-up for incident CHD was from 1990 (end of phase 2)
to the end of 1999. Conventional risk factors for CHD, tested
as potential confounders, were measured at phase 1.

ASSESSMENT OF JUSTICE AT WORK

We used a self-reported justice scale, which tapped the rela-
tional component of organizational justice8 (5 items; Cron-
bach ␣=.72 at phases 1 and 2), as in earlier studies using the
Whitehall II Study cohort (J.E.F., M.K., J.H., M.J.S., and M.G.M.,
unpublished data, December 2004).25 The following items were
included: (1) Do you ever get criticized unfairly (reverse scored)?
(2) Do you get consistent information from line management
(your superior)? (3) Do you get sufficient information from line
management (your superior)? (4) How often is your superior

willing to listen to your problems? and (5) Do you ever get
praised for your work?

Participants rated their response to each of these items on
a 4-point scale (1 indicates never; 2, seldom; 3, sometimes;
and 4, often). For each participant, we averaged the scores of
the 5 items at phases 1 and 2 and then calculated the mean
of these averaged scores (Cronbach ␣ for repeated measure-
ments, .54). For those with missing justice scores in 1 of the
2 phases, we used information from 1 phase only. All par-
ticipants were divided into 3 groups based on the distribu-
tion of the mean scores. The bottom third (mean scores
1.00-2.99) indicated a low level of justice; the middle third
(3.00-3.39), an intermediate level; and the top third (3.40-
4.00), a high level of justice.

ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT CHD

The incidence of CHD was defined as a CHD death, a first
nonfatal MI, or definite angina. To assess fatal CHD, partici-
pants were flagged at the National Health Service Central Reg-
istry, which provided information on the date and cause of
death (of the 10 308 men and women employees in the
Whitehall II Study cohort, 10 300 were successfully flagged).
Coronary deaths were defined by the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 410 through 414 as
underlying causes of death. Potential new cases of nonfatal MI
were ascertained by questionnaire items on chest pain26 and
the physician’s diagnosis of heart attack. Confirmation of MI
according to MONICA criteria (Multinational Monitoring of
Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease)27 was
based on electrocardiograms, markers of myocardial necrosis,
and chest pain history from the medical records. Assessment
of angina was based on the participant’s reports of symptoms
with corroboration in medical records or abnormalities on a
resting electrocardiogram, an exercise electrocardiogram, or a
coronary angiogram.

ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS

We measured the following demographic characteristics and
conventional risk factors: age group (35-39, 40-44, 45-49,
and 50-55 years), ethnicity (white vs other; missing values
were replaced by data collected in 1997-1999), marital status
(married or cohabiting vs other), educational level (aged
⬍17, 17-18, and ⬎18 years when left full-time education),
employment grade (administrative, executive, or clerical),
serum cholesterol concentration, BMI, hypertension (use of
antihypertensive medication or systolic/diastolic blood pres-
sure ⱖ140/90 mm Hg vs others), smoking (current smoker
vs others), alcohol consumption (0, 1-21 and ⬎21 U of alco-
hol per week), and physical activity (vigorous, moderate, or
mild).21

Job strain and effort-reward imbalance were measured us-
ing self-reported job demands (4 items, Cronbach ␣=.67), job
control (15 items; Cronbach ␣=.84), efforts (5 items; Cron-
bach ␣=.72), and rewards (7 or 10 items; Cronbach ␣=.78).
Job strain is a continuous variable derived from the difference
between the demand and control scores. Effort-reward imbal-
ance is the ratio of effort (numerator) to reward (denomina-
tor). For each participant, we calculated the means of job strain
(Cronbach ␣ for repeated measurements, .64) and effort-
reward imbalance scores across phases 1 and 2 (Cronbach
␣=.71). For those with a missing job strain or effort-reward
score in 1 of the 2 phases, we used information from 1 phase
only. All of the participants were divided into 3 groups in job
strain and 3 groups in effort-reward imbalance based on the
distributions of mean scores. The bottom third indicated a low

DATA ANALYSIS

We fitted Cox proportional-hazard models to study age- and
employment grade–adjusted associations between conven-
tional risk factors, psychosocial factors, and the level of jus-
tice and incident CHD. The time-dependent interaction
terms between each predictor and logarithm (follow-up
period) were all nonsignificant, confirming that the propor-
tional hazards assumption was justified. For justice, we
made additional adjustments for conventional risk factors
and psychosocial factors. For the adjustments, cholesterol
concentration and BMI were fitted as continuous variables,
and the other covariates were fitted as categorical variables.
The statistical significance of interactions among justice,
psychosocial factors, and employment grade were tested by
including interaction terms in the models. All P values are 2
tailed, and P values below .05 were considered to indicate

RESULTS

Table 1 shows characteristics of the participants by level
of perceived justice. A higher level of justice was asso-
ciated with older age. After adjustment for age, men who
perceived higher levels of justice were more likely to be
married and have a higher educational level, higher em-
ployment grade, and lower BMI compared with those who
perceived lower levels of justice. A higher level of jus-
tice was also associated with lower job strain and lower
effort-reward imbalance. The level of justice was not sig-
nificantly associated with cholesterol level, hyper-
tension, smoking, alcohol consumption, or physical
activity.

included in these models.

Two hundred fifty employees had an incident CHD
event during the mean follow-up of 8.7 years. Table 2
shows Cox proportional hazard models for associations
between conventional risk factors, justice at work, and
incident CHD among the 6128 men with no missing val-
ues. After adjustment for age and employment grade,
higher cholesterol level, higher BMI, smoking, and hy-
pertension were associated with higher incidence of CHD.
For alcohol consumption and physical inactivity, the as-
sociations did not reach statistical significance. High jus-
tice was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD than
low and intermediate justice before and after adjust-
ment for risk factors, in addition to age and employ-
ment grade. Adjustment for ethnicity, marital status, and
education had no effect on the association between jus-
tice and incident CHD (hazard ratio for high vs low jus-
tice, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.98 be-
fore and 0.46-0.98 after this adjustment; n=4814 with
180 incident cases).

Table 3 shows Cox proportional hazard models for
associations between incident CHD and psychosocial fac-
tors and justice at work. After adjustment for age and
employment grade, higher job strain, and, to a lesser ex-
tent, higher effort-reward imbalance, were associated
with higher risk of incident CHD. As previously shown,
a high level of justice at work was associated with lower
risk of incident CHD. This association remained in a
model additionally adjusted for the other psychosocial

work characteristics. For further analyses, we com-
bined the categories of low and intermediate levels of
justice, as these groups did not differ in terms of CHD
risk. In a fully adjusted model including all conven-
tional risk factors and psychosocial factors, a high level
of justice at work, compared with low and moderate
levels, remained a statistically significant predictor of
incident CHD (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94
[data not shown]).

Table 4 shows the associations of job strain and effort-
reward imbalance with incident CHD by level of justice.
Job strain and effort-reward imbalance seemed to inter-
act with the level of justice, although these interactions
did not reach statistical significance (P=.06 and .26, re-
spectively). Among employees with low or intermediate
levels of justice, job strain and effort-reward imbalance
were associated with a higher risk of CHD. In contrast,
there was no association between job strain or effort-
reward imbalance and incident CHD among employees
with a high level of justice.

Finally, we studied whether the association between
the level of justice and CHD was dependent on employ-
ment grade. This was not the case (P=.94 for interac-
tion); the age-adjusted hazard ratios for incident CHD
associated with a high level of justice were similar across
the grades, ie, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.41-0.97) in the adminis-
trative grade, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45-1.00) in the executive
grade, and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.18-1.60) in the clerical grade.

COMMENT

This is the first study, to our knowledge, that demon-
strates that justice at work may protect against CHD. In
men who perceived a high level of justice, the risk of in-

cident CHD was 30% lower than among those who per-
ceived a low or an intermediate level of justice. This find-
ing was not accounted for by baseline factors such as age,
ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, socio-
economic position, cholesterol level, obesity, hyperten-
sion, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical ac-
tivity. The association between the level of justice and
CHD was also independent of other psychosocial fac-
tors at work, as indicated by the 2 leading stress models,
job strain and effort-reward imbalance.22-24 Our evi-
dence was based on a large well-characterized cohort, a
9-year follow-up, and repeated measurements of jus-
tice. All components of the outcome, including CHD
deaths, first nonfatal MIs, and definite angina, were con-
firmed by medical records.

The link between the level of justice and develop-
ment of CHD was not unexpected, considering the strong
associations between social relations and health4,10,28 and
the central role of concerns about justice and equity in
all societies.1-3 Furthermore, other studies suggest that a
low or declining level of justice at work is associated with
increased risk for subsequent psychological distress, non-
optimal health, and medically certified sickness ab-
sence,25,29,30 with all outcomes predictive of all-cause mor-
tality and CHD incidence.31-34 Our findings on justice and
CHD are also compatible with small-scale studies on blood
pressure and heart rate variability (Marko Elovainio, PhD,
M.K., Sampsa Puttonen, MA, Harri Lindholm, MD, Tiina
Pohjonen, PhD, and Timo Sinervo, PhD, unpublished
data, February 2004).19

An important question is whether the addition of jus-
tice at work materially adds to a risk prediction based
on the established theoretical models. The main theo-
ries in this field are the job strain model and the effort-
reward imbalance model.22-24 The job strain model pos-
its that a combination of high work demands and low
job control at work, ie, job strain, is a health risk for em-
ployees. The effort-reward imbalance model considers the
impact of labor market conditions on health in addition
to more proximal job conditions. According to this model,
health risk derives from the mismatch between efforts
expended at work and rewards received in the form of
money, social approval, job security, and career oppor-
tunities. Both job strain and effort-reward imbalance have
been shown to be the key psychosocial predictors of CHD

and other health outcomes in the Whitehall II Study and
a number of other investigations.35-44

There is a large body of theoretical and empirical re-
search on justice at work as a determinant of organiza-
tional behaviors,7-9,11-13 but the association between jus-
tice and health has only recently been demonstrated.25,29,30
Unlike the job strain model and the effort-reward imbal-
ance model, the justice approach is directly focused on
managerial treatment and managerial procedures.7,11
Within this focus, it covers all kind of unfairness, not only
that arising from disproportionate demands in relation
to decision latitude and organizational rewards.5,7,11 We
found that a high level of justice at work was associated
with lower job strain and a more favorable match be-
tween efforts and rewards. Despite this, the association
between justice and CHD was not explained by associa-
tions between these psychosocial factors, and the level
of justice remained an independent predictor of CHD risk
after adjustment for the other psychosocial factors. More-
over, there was an indication that a high level of justice
might buffer part of the adverse effects of job strain and
effort-reward imbalance. All these findings suggest that
the addition of justice at work adds to a risk prediction
based on the established theoretical models.

Questions have been raised regarding covariation be-
tween work perceptions and occupational position.45 So-
cioeconomic position is a major correlate of some psy-
chosocial work characteristics and a marker of many risk
factors across the life course.46,47 In the present study, a
high level of perceived justice was more common among
well-educated men and those in higher employment
grades. However, adjustment for employment grade or
education did not abolish the effect of the level of jus-
tice on CHD risk, and a subgroup analysis confirmed that
the hazard ratios for administrative, executive, and cleri-
cal grades did not materially differ from each other. This
evidence supports the possibility that the association be-
tween the level of justice and CHD is not due to socio-
economic confounding.

Several potential limitations merit careful consider-
ation. First, as CHD develops during a long time span,
long-term rather than short-term levels of justice are as-
sumed to affect CHD incidence. We used averaged scores
from repeated assessments during a 3-year period to de-
termine levels of justice, job strain, and effort-reward im-

balance. However, the stability of these measurements
over time was only moderate and, despite use of the av-
eraged scores, the observed effects of justice and other
psychosocial factors might be underestimates. In addi-
tion, all comparisons in the predictive strength among
the level of justice, job strain, and effort-reward imbal-
ance should be interpreted cautiously, as the operation-
alization of these concepts may not be equally success-
ful in every case.48

Second, as the level of justice was self-reported, it is
unclear whether actual managerial treatment or the char-
acteristics of the respondent determined it. Previous re-
search suggests that self-reported justice levels reflect or-
ganizational reality, because there is a high degree of
congruence between subordinates’ perceptions of their
supervisors across multiple measurement points and be-
tween the perceptions of supervisors by their peers49 and
superiors.50 Moreover, individual-level justice scores and
more objective work unit aggregated scores have been
shown to be equally predictive of health.30 Organiza-
tional reality may influence health through employees’
appraisal processes and perceptions,51 but increasing the
level of justice with which organizational policies, prac-
tices, and procedures are applied may provide a more prag-
matic way to influence health.

Third, although work is central in adult life, other so-
cial environments that people inhabit may also be im-
portant. Various positive aspects of society, family life,
and relations with significant others have been found to
be protective of health.4,10,28,39 It is possible that such
health-promoting resources also mitigate the harm caused
by a low level of justice at work. On the other hand, just
treatment at work might be particularly important dur-
ing times of uncertainty or for minority groups and vul-
nerable individuals with limited coping resources.36,52 Fur-
ther studies with larger sample sizes are needed to examine
these and other potential modifiers of the effects of jus-
tice on heart health.

Finally, as our evidence was based on male civil ser-
vants, further research is needed to determine whether
the effect of justice on heart health is generalizable to
women, in other contexts, and across ethnic groups.

CONCLUSIONS

Most people care deeply about just treatment by authori-
ties. Just treatment may communicate status and value,
whereas lack of justice may be a source of oppression,
deprivation, and stress. Justice, equity, and altruism have
been the drivers of benign developments in human so-
cieties according to a wide range of studies across a broad
spectrum of disciplines. Our findings on CHD, the lead-
ing cause of death in all Western societies, suggest that
organizational justice is also a topic worthy of consider-
ation in health research.
