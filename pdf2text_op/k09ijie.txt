Task performance and contextual performance are two distinct dimensions of behavior at work that
contribute independently to effectiveness outcomes. Little research has examined the relationship
between job performance and effectiveness. This study extends previous research by investigating the
issue of which measure of job performance plays a substantial role in inﬂuencing any effectiveness
outcome. Seven items for task performance, 12 items for contextual performance, and three items for
effectiveness (productivity, quality, and innovation) were used for assessing employee performance. A
total of 143 employees in a medium-sized company participated in this study. The results demonstrated
that two items, ‘‘attention to important details’’ and ‘‘creativity to solve a work problem’’, were the most
effectual items to contribute to productivity, quality, and innovation, respectively. Education level and job
experience had less effect on effectiveness.
Relevance to industry: Job performance measures used in workshops have different effects on each of the
effectiveness indicators. This study highlights that training programs in purpose of enhancing employee
effectiveness in the blue-collar jobs at the metal industry should focus on ‘‘attention to important
details’’, and ‘‘creativity to solve a work problem’’.

1. Introduction

Perhaps, the most important dependent variable in industrial
and organizational psychology is job performance. For all of the
main applications of this branch of psychology, such as employee
training and job redesigning, the focus is almost always on
improving job performance (Borman, 2004). Borman and Moto-
widlo (1993) identiﬁed two broad classes of employee behavior:
task performance and contextual performance (also called citi-
zenship performance). Recently, several researchers have deﬁned
counterproductive performance as voluntary behavior (non-task
behavior) that harms the well-being of organization (e.g., Dunlop
and Lee, 2004; Rotundo and Sackett, 2002), and adaptive perfor-
mance that is the proﬁciency with which an employee alters his/
her behavior to meet the demands of the environment, an event, or
a new situation (e.g., Johnson, 2001; Pulakos et al., 2000, see
Borman et al., 1991; Viswesvaran and Ones, 2000, for models). The
distinction between task performance and contextual performance
has gained wide acceptance in the literature investigating behavior
at work (e.g., Conway, 1999; Grifﬁn et al., 2000; Van Scotter and
Motowidlo, 1996). Both types of behavior are presumed to
contribute to organizational effectiveness, but in different ways
(Kiker and Motowidlo, 1999). Task performance involves patterns of

behaviors that are directly involved in producing goods or service,
or activities that provide indirect support for the organization’s
core technical processes. Contextual performance is deﬁned as
individual efforts that are not directly related to their main task
function but are important because they shape the organizational,
social, and psychological context that serves as the critical catalyst
for task activities and processes (Werner, 2000). When employees
help others to complete a task, cooperate with their supervisors, or
suggest ways to improve organizational processes,
they are
engaging in contextual performance (Van Scotter et al., 2000). As
interest grows in the type of helpful, cooperative, and innovative
job performance behavior, it becomes more important to under-
stand its inﬂuence on organizational and individual outcomes (Van
Scotter, 2000).

The effects of task performance and contextual performance on
turnover, job satisfaction (Van Scotter, 2000), rewards (Kiker and
Motowidlo, 1999; Van Scotter et al., 2000), and overall performance
(e.g., Borman et al., 1995; Borman and Motowidlo, 1997; Motowidlo
and Van Scotter, 1994; Van Scotter and Motowidlo, 1996) have been
discussed in the literature. Task performance has long been
recognized by researchers as the most important aspect of work
behaviors and has sometimes been regarded as being synonymous
with overall job performance. The importance of the non-task
behaviors in determining overall job performance, however, has
also been well documented in the literature (Dunlop and Lee,
2004). Several studies (e.g., MacKenzie et al., 1991, 1993) have
concluded that elements of contextual performance can have

97

a stronger impact on managers’ assessments of employee job
performance. In a study, Motowidlo and Van Scotter (1994) found
that contextual performance plays a role as important as task
performance in determining mechanics’ overall performance.
Similar results found in other studies (e.g., Borman et al., 1995;
Rotundo and Sackett, 2002; Van Scotter and Motowidlo, 1996)
provide ample evidence that elements on contextual performance
can have substantial effects on supervisors’ assessment of subor-
dinates’ overall job performance (Kiker and Motowidlo, 1999).
Despite the consistency of these results, one limitation is that it is
required to look at their separate main effects or interaction effects
on overall value or worth to the organization of each performance
measure. Overall job performance is ratings on statements (or
ranking of individuals on statements) referring to overall perfor-
mance, overall effectiveness, overall work reputation, or the sum of
all individual dimensions rated (Viswesvaran et al., 1996). In several
studies, overall performance was taken as a measure of ‘‘organi-
zational effectiveness’’ (e.g., Moscoso and Salgado, 2004), and one
measure such as conscientiousness, which appears to be related to
overall performance in a wide range of jobs (e.g., Barrick and
Mount, 1991), or a combination of task performance and contextual
performance measures where the number of measures for each
performance dimension was different
from each other (e.g.,
Barksdale and Werner, 2001; Conway, 1999; Van Scotter and
Motowidlo, 1996).

Both task performance and contextual performance describe the
speciﬁc behaviors of individuals (Motowidlo et al., 1997). These
behaviors can be distinguished from effectiveness, which is the
impact that behaviors have on outcomes that are valued by the
organization (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997). This distinction
emphasizes that performance is deﬁned by behavior itself while
effectiveness is the consequence of behavior (Grifﬁn et al., 2000). It
has been widely presumed that task performance and contextual
performance (also related to sub-dimensions such as organiza-
tional citizenship) contribute to organizational effectiveness, but in
different ways. Task performance contributes to organizational
effectiveness either by transforming the organization’s raw mate-
rials as a step toward creating the organization’s products or by
providing necessary service and maintenance functions, such as
replenishing the supply of raw materials, distributing its ﬁnished
products, and providing important planning, coordinating, super-
vising, and staff functions (Kiker and Motowidlo, 1999). Borman
and Motowidlo (1993) argued that contextual performance, on the
other hand, contributes to organizational effectiveness by sup-
porting the organizational, social, and psychological context in
which the technical core must function. Studies have focused on
the antecedents of job performance more than its outcomes. The
results were the basis of decisions about whether an employee will
be considered for a promotion or reward through the organization’s
pay system.

There is a substantial body of research that has examined the
relationships between task performance and one or more aspects
of contextual performance, managerial ratings of employee effec-
tiveness (e.g., Barksdale and Werner, 2001; Conway, 1999; MacK-
enzie et al., 1991, 1993; Motowidlo and Van Scotter, 1994; Van
Scotter and Motowidlo, 1996), and team effectiveness (e.g., Dunlop
and Lee, 2004; Koys, 2001; Podsakoff et al., 1997). There has been
a lack of systematic empirical research designed to investigate how
job performance dimensions contribute to effectiveness outcomes.
To our knowledge, no study done has been able to explain a deeper
understanding of the impact of each job performance item on
effectiveness measures. This is one of the research questions in the
present study.

Grifﬁn et al. (2000) investigated the joint role of task perfor-
mance and contextual performance for achieving three critical
effectiveness outcomes (safety, orderliness, and efﬁciency) in air

trafﬁc control. Effectiveness was assessed under three levels of
difﬁculty. These measures and their levels were subjective ratings
acquired from the raters. When testing the contribution of task
performance and contextual performance to effectiveness, they
found that when task was difﬁcult, contextual performance made
no contribution to effectiveness, if the employee was rated as
a good task performer. In this study, the impact of ratee’s demo-
graphic characteristics on job performance and its relationship
with effectiveness measures were not analyzed. In a similar study
conducted by Miron et al. (2004), the purpose was to identify the
personal characteristics that inﬂuence innovation, quality, and
efﬁciency, and to test the differential effects of these characteristics
on three outcomes. Two hundred and forty-nine engineers and
technicians in 21 units of a large R&D company participated in the
study. Both studies focused on the white-collar staff.

Podsakoff et al. (1997) investigated the effects of contextual
performance on the quantity and quality of outcomes. The partic-
ipants were 218 blue-collar employees working in 40 machine
crews at a paper manufacturing company. Their results indicated
that contextual performance tended to predict the quantity better
than the quality of outcomes. Podsakoff et al. (2000) reviewed four
studies that examined correlations between mean levels of rated
contextual performance within organizational units and various
indices of organizational effectiveness for these same units. The
studied samples included 30 restaurants, 306 sales teams, and
effectiveness indices consisted of ﬁnancial efﬁciency indicators,
customer service ratings, and performance quality ratings. Across
the studies, the relationships between contextual performance and
organizational effectiveness were substantial. An additional study
(Koys, 2001) with a longitudinal design suggested that contextual
performance on the part of organizational members may cause
organizational effectiveness. Accordingly, it seems likely that job
performance can contribute to the effectiveness of organizations.
Recently, Viswesvaran (2002) presented a meta-analytic cumula-
tion of the literature reporting correlations of absenteeism with
organizational records of (i) productivity, (ii) quality; and with
supervisory ratings of (iii) effort, and (iv) interpersonal behavior.
The research suggested that the convergence between organiza-
tional records and subjective ratings of performance by supervisory
has been less than perfect.

In the light of these ﬁndings, it is questioned in this study that
job performance would be a signiﬁcant and positive predictor of
various measures of effectiveness. This study differed from
previous studies in three important ways. First, education level and
experience as ratee’s demographic information were included in
the analyses. Second, effectiveness was measured with three
measures which appear to be usable in a wide range of blue-collar
jobs in work crews in a metal
industry. Some effectiveness
measures were assessed partly objectively by using data taken from
the company record. Third, this is the ﬁrst attempt to shed some
light on the issue of which measure of job performance plays
a more important role in inﬂuencing any effectiveness outcome.

2. Job performance

The recent review of the literature has indicated that there are
two distinct dimensions of work behaviors in the job performance
issue: task performance and contextual (also called citizenship)
performance. Historically, job performance has had as its core task
activities. These kinds of activities are typically identiﬁed in job
analyses that focus on tasks and estimate their importance,
frequency, and the like (e.g., closing the sale for a sales job, ﬁlling
project papers for a clerical job) (Borman, 2004). In the current
work, psychology literature, task performance is deﬁned as ‘‘the
proﬁciency with which incumbents perform activities that are
formally recognized as part of their jobs, activities that contribute


98

E. Kahya / International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics 39 (2009) 96–104

to the organization’s technical core either directly by implementing
a part of its technological process, or indirectly by providing it with
needed materials or services’’ (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993). It
consists of job speciﬁc behaviors including core job responsibilities.
When employees use technical skills and knowledge to produce
goods or service through the organization’s core technical process,
or when they accomplish specialized tasks that support these core
functions, they are engaging in task performance (Van Scotter,
2000).

Contextual performance is deﬁned as individual efforts that are
not directly related to their main task function but are important
because they shape the organizational, social, and psychological
context that serves as the critical catalyst for task activities and
processes (Werner, 2000). Although task performance traditionally
has
received more attention than contextual performance,
researchers have begun to empirically demonstrate that contextual
performance yields a competitive advantage for organizations
(Witt et al., 2002). It is not difﬁcult to make the case that employees
who follow instructions, display initiative, persist on difﬁcult tasks,
cooperative with others effectively, or voluntarily act on the
organization’s behalf contribute more to the organization than
employees who do not (Van Scotter, 2000).

Task behaviors are not independent of contextual behaviors.
Authors (e.g., Borman et al., 1995; Borman and Motowidlo, 1993;
Motowidlo et al., 1997; Motowidlo and Van Scotter, 1994; Van
Scotter and Motowidlo, 1996) have reported the distinction and
interactions between task performance and contextual perfor-
mance as two virtually universal dimensions of job performance.
Conway’s (1996) ﬁndings showed that 55% of the dimensions were
very reliably sorted into the task category, while 30% of them took
place in the contextual category. There was some disagreement
about the remaining 15% (Borman et al., 2001).

The argument for distinguishing between task performance and
contextual performance gains force if they are correlated with
different demographic characteristics. Previous studies have
demonstrated that various factors such as ratee’s demographic
characteristics, rater cognitive variables, and interpersonal affect
(e.g., friendship, liking) cause, or inﬂuence task performance and
contextual performance ratings. Demographic characteristics such
as age, gender, race, education level, and experience year have been
widely considered in research to explain some of the variance in
performance ratings (e.g., Borman et al., 1991; Ferris et al., 1994;
Judge and Ferris, 1993; Miron et al., 2004; Moser et al., 1999;
Motowidlo and Van Scotter, 1994; Posthuma, 2000; Schmidt et al.,
1986; Sundvik and Lindeman, 1998; Van Scotter et al., 2000). A
major ﬁnding from these studies was that rater age, gender, and
also education had little or no effect on ratings. Similarly, ratee’s
race and gender have been shown to account for from less than 1%
to a maximum of about 5% of the variance in ratings (Borman et al.,
1991). Borman and Motowidlo (1993) suggested that the major
source of variation in task performance is the proﬁciency with
which a person can carry out task activities. It indicates that indi-
vidual differences in knowledge, skills, and abilities should covary
more with task performance than with contextual performance
(Motowidlo and Van Scotter, 1994).

3. Links between job performance and effectiveness

Performance is behavior with an evaluative component that can
be evaluated as positive or negative for employee. These behaviors
can be distinguished from effectiveness, which is the impact that
behaviors have on outcomes (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997). This
distinction emphasizes that effectiveness is the result of behavior;
it is changed by performance. To illustrate this point, innovation is
a result and signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by creativity. Several studies
(recently, Grifﬁn et al., 2000; Koys, 2001; Miron et al., 2004;

Podsakoff et al., 1997) have demonstrated that both task perfor-
mance and contextual performance contribute to effectiveness.

There are two types of task performance. One consists of
activities that transform raw materials into the goods and services
that are the organization’s products. They include activities such as
selling merchandise in a retail store, operating a production
machine in a manufacturing plant, teaching in a school, performing
surgery in a hospital, and cashing checks in a bank. A second type of
task performance consists of activities that service and maintain
the technical core by replenishing its supply of raw materials;
distributing its ﬁnished products; or providing important planning,
coordination, supervising, or staff functions that enable it to func-
tion effectively and efﬁciently. Thus, task performance bears
a direct relation to the organization’s technical core, either by
executing its technical process or by maintaining and serving its
technical requirements (Motowidlo et al., 1997). Task skill
is
cognitive ability in using technical information, performing tech-
nical procedures, handling information, making judgements,
solving problems, making decisions related to core technical
functions. It involves skills in applying relevant technical knowl-
edge to perform the necessary actions smoothly, quickly, and
without error. With regard to prediction, it is plausible to assume
that increasing task performance results in higher effectiveness
outcomes. For example, the increase in job knowledge would lead
to an increase in the size of productivity outcome.

Contextual performance is typically conceptualized as being
under the motivational control of individuals and less constrained
by work characteristics than task performance (Borman and
Motowidlo, 1993). It is generally assumed that individuals can
engage in contextual activities if they wish, and that this choice
reﬂects individual differences in motivation (Motowidlo et al.,
1997). There are many reasons to expect high levels of contextual
performance on the part of organizational members to contribute
to organizational effectiveness (Borman, 2004). Contextual perfor-
mance behaviors involving persistence, effort, compliance, and
self-discipline might enhance the effectiveness of
individual
workers and managers (Motowidlo et al., 1997), coworkers’ and
supervisors’ productivity (Borman, 2004). Helpful, considerate, and
cooperative behaviors are expected to promote work group effec-
tiveness and improve organizational coordination and control by
reducing friction among organizational members and promoting
a social and psychological context (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993).
Voluntary behaviors increase an organization’s ability to solve
unanticipated problems and adapt to change, and thus these
behaviors should serve to improve organizational effectiveness in
almost any work setting.

The theory of individual differences in task performance and
contextual performance developed by Motowidlo et al. (1997)
argues
that an individual’s discrete performance episodes
contribute independently to an aggregated total that represents
his/her overall contribution to the organization (Kiker and Moto-
widlo, 1999). This means that the contribution value of any
particular behavior performed by an employee is independent of
the contribution value of any other behavior performed by the
same employee. If this assumption is true, it provides a basis for
expecting that any performance item with high level leads to
higher outcome of one effectiveness measure.

4. Method

4.1. Participants

This study was conducted in a middle-sized manufacturing
company, which produces various types of tractor cabins. The
company was founded approximately 10 years ago and has grown
to its current size of over 200 employees for all the jobs. This is an

99

important context for examining that not enough research in ﬁeld
settings has focused on blue-collar workers.

In the performance evaluation process, the ﬁrst step is to set up
an evaluation committee to manage the company’s strategic policy.
The evaluation committee consisted of managers from the
departments where blue-collar employees work and also HRM
(Human Resource Management) manager. The committee is
responsible for approving the performance and effectiveness items
that are essential for the company’s vision and values.

Fourteen raters were immediate supervisors; each was a ﬁrst-
line manager of one or two work teams. The number of workers
in a team ranges from 4 to 29, with an average of 7.94 workers
per team and 10.21 workers per supervisor. All supervisors
participated in several 1-day workplace assessor training cour-
ses. These courses covered principles of assessment such as
reliability, fairness, halo errors in ratings, deﬁnitions of the items
used to measure employee performance, and the assessment
procedure.

The ratees were 143 blue-collar employees working in the
departments including stock control (one team, four workers),
mechanical processing (seven teams, 95 workers), assembly (four
teams, 19 workers), maintenance (three teams, eight workers),
R&D (one team, seven workers), and quality (two teams, 10
workers). These employees participated in this study as part of
a larger HRM project. Several authors (e.g., Rothstein, 1990) have
argued that new employees should be evaluated only after
a certain time has passed because supervisors need adequate
opportunities to observe subordinates’ behaviors. In this study,
the ratees were those who are working in the company longer
than 6 months (an evaluation period) so that they can be assessed
fairly by their own supervisors.

4.2. Task performance measures

Task performance was measured using seven items.

Item
development was based on the empirical work of Motowidlo and
Van Scotter (1994) and the results of our job analysis which is
applied for identifying important tasks and behaviors so that the
items reﬂect job-related performance behaviors. In a meeting, the
evaluation committee consisted of department directors that
reviewed the items for accuracy and then came to an agreement
for seven items (see Table 3). The last four measures came
from Motowidlo and Van Scotter’s (1994) empirical work, and the
others – job knowledge (measure of the knowledge required to get
the job done), problem solving, and concentrating to the duties –
were the results of the job analysis. Each employee was rated by his
supervisor on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from (1) inadequate
to (5) excellent.

4.3. Contextual performance measures

implemented by

evaluation systems

Twenty-ﬁve contextual performance items were generated
from previous research reporting contextual performance items
(Motowidlo and Van Scotter, 1994; Goodman and Svyantek, 1999;
Coleman and Borman, 2000; Moorman and Wells, 2003) and
performance
several
companies in the city. The appropriateness of each item was
discussed in a meeting. The evaluation committee selected 12
items which were important for the company’s vision and values.
As a result, the items were adopted from Coleman and Borman
(2000) (six items), Motowidlo and Van Scotter (1994) (three
items), and the systems in use (three items). Coleman and Bor-
man’s (2000) categorization provided a useful model (a three
group model) for classifying the items. The items were measured
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale with higher scores reﬂecting higher
levels of contextual performance.

4.4. Effectiveness measures

Taking a systems approach, Schuler and Jackson (1987)
proposed that the HRM strategies in organizations should support
three competitive performance outcomes: innovation, quality, and
efﬁciency. In this study, therefore, effectiveness was assessed by
three measures: productivity, quality, and innovation. Productivity
includes ratings of quantity of output or ratings of volume of work
an employee produces. The measure was the percentage of the
target product that was amount for the assessment period. Data for
the employees working in the mechanical processing and assembly
departments were taken from MRP II system in the company by the
supervisors. They were asked to convert to a ﬁve-point Likert scale
such that levels 1: x   1:5s and below; 2: x   1:5s to x   0:5s; 3: x  
0:5s to x þ 0:5s; 4: x þ 0:5s to x þ 1:5s; 5: x þ 1:5s and above
where x is the target (mean) value, and s is standard deviation of
data. The other supervisors assessed subjectively. Quality is an
assessment of how well the job is done. The measure was the
percentage of products that was rejected by the quality control
personnel. Similar scheme was applied for this measure. Innovation
is the successful implementation of creative ideas by an organiza-
tion. The measure was the number of suggestions given by a worker
for the assessment period. The number was changed to a ﬁve-point
Likert scale.

4.5. Variables

In performance evaluation literature, many systematic studies
have been devoted to the potential effects of some demographic
variables such as age, gender, education level, and job experience
on job performance. The major result from these studies was that
job experience and education level had direct or indirect effects on
job performance. Several authors (e.g., Schmidt et al., 1986; Moser
et al., 1999; Posthuma, 2000) have reported a mean correlation of
0.09–0.18 between experience and job performance. Schmidt et al.
(1986) concluded that job experience leads to the acquisition of
skills, techniques, method, psychomotor habits, etc. that directly
produce improvements in performance capabilities. In Borman
et al.’s (1995) studies, experience was signiﬁcantly correlated with
task performance (r ¼ 0.30–0.40) and contextual performance
(r ¼ 0.15). In contrast, Ferris et al.’s (2001) ﬁndings, r ¼ 0.02 for task
performance and r ¼ 0.23–0.25 for contextual performance, did not
support the expected result. These results lead to consider educa-
tion and job experience as the variables in this study. The variables
might explain some of the variation in performance ratings. Job
experience (number of years that employee is working in the
company) and education level of each ratee were obtained from
the company’s archival sources. The average length was 9.26
years (s.d. ¼ 5.18) for experience. Among them, the majority (86)
had graduated from high schools or below. Education level
was a grouped measure that was coded as 1 ¼ high school or
under, 2 ¼ professional school, 3 ¼ technical school, and 4 ¼ junior
college – 2 years university.

4.6. Procedure

A performance evaluation questionnaire consisting of items to
assess employee performance, employee name, and job informa-
tion (job identiﬁcation, team, and department) was designed for
each of three tools. Ratings were made at the end of a 6-month
period of observation. One questionnaire per employee was
distributed to the supervisors at work. They were permitted to
complete the questionnaires on company time and turn them to
HRM department in a week. It was guaranteed that their responses
would remain completely conﬁdential. All of the supervisors ﬁlled
out the performance rating questionnaires for all their employees.

5. Results

5.1. Reliability and consistency

To test the reliability of the instrument, SPSS Reliability Analysis
was performed using the performance scores, and the reliability
(Cronbach’s a) coefﬁcients were found: a ¼ 0.82 for the task
performance, a ¼ 0.89 for contextual performance, and a ¼ 0.78 for
effectiveness scales. The items showed very high scale reliabilities
ranging from a ¼ 0.76 to a ¼ 0.90. Authors (e.g., Viswesvaran et al.,
1996; Podsakoff et al., 2000) have implied that an item with
a coefﬁcient a below 0.70 is considered for removal from the tool.
These results approved the reliability of the instrument.

Consistency can be tested with a research whether an item is
strongly correlated with others. Correlation coefﬁcient between
any two items shows the degree of ﬁeld superposition. If a corre-
lation coefﬁcient is larger than a pre-speciﬁed value (e.g., r > 0.85),
it is suggested that two items are measuring the same ﬁeld or
requirement, which is deﬁned as ‘‘multicollinearity’’. In this case,
either may be eliminated. When the matrix of correlation coefﬁ-
cients was achieved by using an SPSS Bivariate Correlation Analysis,
it was found that all coefﬁcients were less than 0.80.

5.2. Correlations among the measures

Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) and
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients among all measures and variables
are summarized in Table 1. There were signiﬁcant correlations
among them; several interesting ﬁndings should be noted. First, the
results indicated that task performance was moderately and posi-
tively correlated with contextual performance (r ¼ 0.50, p < 0.01),
questioning the meaningful distinction of
two performance
dimensions. The coefﬁcient was higher than the result found by
some authors such as Van Scotter (2000) (r ¼ 0.25, p < 0.01), but
roughly equal to Grifﬁn et al.’s (2000) ﬁnding (r ¼ 0.56, p < 0.05).
These variations indicate that correlations may depend on
complexity of job family. Second, the correlations between task
performance and two variables (education level and job experi-
ence) did not yield the expected results. The coefﬁcients were not
high enough to indicate empirical redundancy, r ¼  0.26 (p < 0.01)
and r ¼ 0.18 (p < 0.05),
respectively. Task performance may
diminish somewhat with increasing education level, which has
been concluded by some authors (e.g., Ferris et al., 2001; Bu¨ chel,
2002) as well. Higher education level may not guarantee higher job
performance. It is a worthwhile result that there was no signiﬁcant
correlation between the variables and effectiveness (r ¼ 0.03 and
r ¼  0.03, both p < 0.001). The result indicates that education and
experience make no contribution to effectiveness. Third, effec-
tiveness was positively correlated with task performance (r ¼ 0.54,
p < 0.001) and strongly correlated with contextual performance
(r ¼ 0.77, p < 0.01), but contextual performance contributed to
effectiveness greater than task performance.

To identify the interaction between job performance and
effectiveness, we plotted the prediction of effectiveness scores at
the means as well as at high and low levels of task performance and
contextual performance. As shown in Fig. 1, which illustrates the

interaction on effectiveness, we found that there was a signiﬁcant
interaction effect of task performance and contextual performance
on effectiveness. A one-unit increase in task performance produces
a larger increase in effectiveness if the employee does not engage in
contextual activities. In a high contextual performance, employees
with any level of task performance reached to the same level of
effectiveness. In a word, task performance contributes less to
effectiveness, whereas contextual performance is high.

5.3. Multiple regression analyses

Multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate the
relative contribution of each variable and job performance
dimensions to the prediction of effectiveness. To control the
incremental effects of
the task performance and contextual
performance in the regression analysis, four hierarchical regression
steps were established; in all steps, effectiveness was the depen-
dent variable, and two variables (experience and education level)
were a ﬁxed block as the independent variables. In the next two
steps, each performance dimension was added to the base model
to determine how each one alone contributes to effectiveness. In
the last step, both were entered into the base model. Table 2
reports b (standardized coefﬁcient), R2 (adjusted), and DR2 (the
change in R2).

The ﬁrst column in Table 2a (Step 1) showed that education level
and experience year were not large predictors. All variables
accounted for 1% of the total variance of the ratings (R2 ¼ 0.01)
which is quite small. In all analyses (Steps 1–4), these variables
were not signiﬁcant, ranging from b ¼  0.164 (p < 0.01) to b ¼ 0.155
(p < 0.05). When task performance was entered into regression
equation (Step 2), the effect size (the change in R2) was 30%. As
predicted, task performance accounted for a signiﬁcant incre-
mental portion of variance in predicting effectiveness after
controlling the main effects of the variables in the base model. In
Step 3, the change in R2 (59%) was greater than before when
contextual performance was included. Either were statistically
signiﬁcant predictors of effectiveness (DR2 ¼ 0.62) (Step 4). Unex-
pectedly, contextual performance had a larger impact (b ¼ 0.678,
p < 0.001) on effectiveness than task performance (b ¼ 0.219,
p < 0.001). The results in Table 2b show that job dedication
performance (b ¼ 0.656, p < 0.001) had a stronger contribution on
effectiveness
performance
(b ¼ 0.219, p < 0.001) and interpersonal citizenship performance

5.4. The effect of job performance on effectiveness

An additional correlation analysis was performed to reveal
the contribution of each performance dimension and item to
various measures of effectiveness. The results of this analysis are
given in Table 3. The results provided general support that each
performance dimension and each item had a different contri-
bution to each effectiveness measure. Although task perfor-
mance tended to predict productivity better than the others, job
dedication performance (extra efforts that go beyond role
requirements; demonstrating dedication to the job) contributed
to quality and innovation better than productivity. Similarly,
interpersonal citizenship performance inﬂuenced the quality
much more, whereas organizational citizenship performance
tended to impact on both productivity and innovation. Surpris-
ingly, it was found that the items that contributed the biggest to
the effectiveness measures were several of contextual perfor-
mance items, and signiﬁcantly greater than the impacts of the

task performance items. The substantial items were ‘‘attention to
important details’’ for quality, productivity, and ‘‘creativity to
solve a work problem’’ for innovation.

6. Discussion

There is a substantial body of studies that have revealed the
relationships between job performance and individual or team
effectiveness. A small number of research studies (e.g., Grifﬁn et al.,
2000; Koys, 2001; Podsakoff et al., 1997) have investigated the
contribution of
job performance dimensions to effectiveness
outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to highlight
the effect of any job performance item on each effectiveness
measure. The present study contributes to the theory of HRM by
proving empirical evidence for training ﬁelds that are designed to
improve employee performance and increase effectiveness
outcomes.

In performance evaluation literature, many systematic studies
have been devoted to the potential effects of some variables such as
age, gender, experience, observation time, interpersonal affect,
rating format, workplace deviant behaviors, and organizational
politics on job performance. A major result from these studies was
that age, gender, and race had little effect on ratings. Experience
may have a direct or indirect causal impact on job performance.
Increases in experience may produce increases in job knowledge,
which lead to improved job performance. Schmidt et al.’s (1986)
ﬁndings support the conclusion that when (i) mean job experience
is in the neighborhood of 2–3 years and (ii) the jobs are of an
intermediate complexity level, job experience has a substantial
indirect impact on job performance. In contrast to these results,
Ferris et al. (2001) reported that although there was a weak
correlation (r ¼ 0.02) between experience and task performance
ratings, it had a signiﬁcant effect on contextual performance ratings
(r ¼ 0.24, p < 0.01). The ﬁndings show that there were small posi-
tive correlations between job experience and task performance
(r ¼ 0.18, p < 0.05), and also contextual performance (r ¼ 0.12,
p < 0.001), which supports the well-established ﬁndings in many
other studies such as Motowidlo and Van Scotter (1994). Despite
the paucity of research literature, personnel psychologists appear

to have been aware that experience could affect job performance
(Schmidt et al., 1986). The correlation between job performance
and education level did not yield the expected pattern of result.
Education was negatively correlated with task performance
(r ¼  0.26, p < 0.05), but positively and weakly correlated with
contextual performance (r ¼ 0.06, p < 0.001); thus, task perfor-
mance may diminish somewhat with increasing education, which
has been concluded by some authors as well. Higher education may
not guarantee high job performance.

The present study contributes to the theory of job performance
by providing empirical evidence that establishes the relative
importance of task performance and contextual performance on
effectiveness. Little empirical research has been devoted to the
potential effect of job performance on effectiveness. According to
our knowledge, only one attempt to reveal the relationship
between job performance and effectiveness in depth has been
presented by Grifﬁn et al. (2000) who investigated the joint role of
task performance and contextual performance for achieving
effectiveness outcomes in air trafﬁc control. They concluded that
when the task was difﬁcult, contextual performance made no
contribution to effectiveness, if the controller was rated as a good
task performer. The correlation coefﬁcients between job perfor-
mance and effectiveness were found to be r ¼ 0.58–0.70 (p < 0.05)
for task performance and r ¼ 0.35–0.50 (p < 0.05) for contextual
performance. The results were differentiated from their ﬁndings.
The results indicated that contextual performance (b ¼ 0.678,
p < 0.001) contributed to effectiveness greater than task perfor-
mance (b ¼ 0.219, p < 0.001). The results indicated that
task
performance does not contribute to effectiveness while contextual
performance is high. The most efﬁcient employees were those who
scored high on contextual performance. As Borman and Motowidlo
(1993) mentioned, contextual performance primarily inﬂuences
organizational effectiveness indirectly by improving the broader
organizational, social, and psychological environment in which the
organization must function. Voluntary behaviors increase the
climate among employees in the team and organization, which,
more or less, serve to improve effectiveness in a work setting.

The results of this research have practical

implications of
employees and organizations. It may be one of the ﬁrst empirical
studies in the related literature to investigate the point effects of job
performance items on effectiveness outcomes. An implication for
HRM practice may be to implement training program designed to
enhance employee effectiveness on areas where an employee is
weak. The correlation coefﬁcients provided general support that
each performance dimension and each item had a different
contribution to each effectiveness measure as depicted in Table 3.
Although task performance tended to predict the productivity
better than the others, job dedication performance contributed to
quality and innovation better than productivity. However, inter-
personal citizenship performance inﬂuenced quality much more,
whereas organizational citizenship performance tended to impact
on both productivity and innovation.

In general, contextual performance items tended to contribute
to effectiveness measures better than task performance items did.
Three task performance items and two organizational citizenship
performance items did not contribute to any effectiveness measure.
Each one of the remaining had an effect on at least one effectiveness
measure. For each effectiveness measure, the most important items
will be discussed below.

6.1. Productivity

Productivity includes ratings of quantity of output or ratings of
volume of work an employee produces. It is the best measure of
effectiveness that
for the success of organization.
Although a variety of performance items affect productivity, and

is crucial

productivity may be contingent on a multitude of other items, three
contextual performance items contribute greatly to productivity. To
reach a high level of employee productivity, training should be
focused on the ﬁelds: ‘‘attention to important details’’,
‘‘partici-
pating responsibility in the organization’’, and ‘‘planning and
organizing work’’, respectively.
In a general sense, contextual
performance contributed to productivity better, which supports
Podsakoff et al.’s (1997) ﬁndings. They concluded that sportsman-
ship and helping behaviors had signiﬁcant positive relationships
with the quantity of output (r ¼ 0.40 and r ¼ 0.36, p < 0.05). The
results for these aspects including interpersonal and organizational
citizenship performance were r ¼ 0.39 (p < 0.01) and r ¼ 0.53
(p < 0.01), respectively, which are close to their ﬁndings.

6.2. Quality

Emphasis on the quality of products and services has increased
with the establishment of the ISO 9000 quality standard. The major
requirements of ISO 9000 are that organizations develop and
implement a set of routines and procedures for product design,
manufacturing, delivery, service, and support. Standardization
assures that all customers get the same product and service as
promised. Reliable and standardized production with minimal
variation can be achieved only when employees conﬁrm and
adhere to existing rules (Miron et al., 2004). However, a quality-
focused environment is not favorable to all employees, as people
differ in their preference for complying with the rules. As predicted,
there was a strong relationship between ‘attention to important
detail’ and quality. It was found that behaviors involving coopera-
tion, creativity, and self-development were expected to contribute
to quality effectiveness. In contrast to our result, Miron et al. (2004)
found a poor, but positive correlation between quality and the item
(r ¼ 0.64, p < 0.05). Nevertheless, the item was one of the most
effectual measures.

6.3.

Innovation

There was a strong relationship between creativity performance
and innovative effectiveness (r ¼ 0.61, p < 0.01). Employees who
scored high on creativity performance obtained the highest
outcomes of innovative effectiveness. This result supported some
authors’ ﬁndings such as Miron et al. (2004). They noted that there
was a positive correlation between creativity and innovation
(r ¼ 0.22, p < 0.01). They also found that there were signiﬁcant
interaction effects between creativity, innovation, and initiative.
Employees who scored high on both creativity and initiative
obtained the higher scores on innovation. In contrast, creative
employee with low initiative exhibited lower scores on innovative.
Creativity is deﬁned as the production of novel ideas that are useful
and appropriate to a given situation (Amabile, 1983). Creativity is
not synonymous with innovation (Miron et al., 2004). Rather,
‘‘innovation is the successful implementation of creative ideas by
an organization’’ (Amabile, 2000). This deﬁnition distinguishes
from the generation of new ideas on their implementation (West,
2002). While creativity is the dominant factor, one also has to
demonstrate a high level of producing new ideas to the imple-
mentation stage. Two other items, self-development (r ¼ 0.58,
p < 0.01) and responsibility (r ¼ 0.55), also contribute to innovative
effectiveness. These ﬁndings are evidence that employees who
have low innovation should be trained at these areas. Innovative
outcomes are more likely to occur when it is rewarded, and the
organizational culture, a set of beliefs and values shared by
members of the organization, supports it.

The current study has several

limitations that need to be
considered when interpreting the results, and that should be
addressed in future research. The major limitation of this study is


E. Kahya / International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics 39 (2009) 96–104

103

the generalisability to other task environments. These ﬁndings
were obtained from a middle-sized metal manufacturing company
where some jobs are at intermediate levels of complexity. It may be
that, for jobs of greater complexity and/or greater autonomy and
discretion, improving in the conditions that reduce or enhance the
impact of task performance and contextual performance across
a range of different occupations does continue to contribute to job
performance and effectiveness. The opposite may be true for jobs of
lower complexity. The different ﬁndings could reﬂect real differ-
ences in the way that task performance and contextual perfor-
mance contribute to effectiveness in these tasks. Future research, to
be conducted in more than one organization, would strengthen the
generalization of the present ﬁndings.

Another limitation is the source of the ratings. Although
supervisory ratings constitute the most widely used source of job
performance in published research, it may be argued that different
results could be obtained from different types of raters for different
kinds of behaviors. It does not mean that the use of supervisor
ratings invalidates the present ﬁndings. Using multi-source
feedback,
instruments to examine the relative importance of
performance dimensions would make it possible to contrast ratings
made by supervisors with those made by peers and subordinates
(Johnson, 2001). For example, peers may assess better the inter-
personal citizenship behaviors of employee because they are most
likely to be the beneﬁciaries of such behaviors. The use of multiple
sources of ratings in future research may produce interesting
patterns that increase the understanding of the contribution of job
performance items.

As Podsakoff et al. (1997) suggested, subjective job performance
(and effectiveness) ratings are less reliable because they are
affected by judges’ instinctive factors (e.g., personality, cognitive
errors). In this study, we intended an attempt to use data taken
from MRP II for all effectiveness measures. It was seen that data
(productivity ratio, percentage of products that was rejected, and
the number of suggestions) for the employees in some teams were
not available or were incorrect. In order not to use different
structures for different employees, the supervisors in teams for
which data were available in the MRP II system transformed the
data to the ﬁve-point Likert scale as depicted before. Although such
ratings were linked to quantitative measures, they are generally
considered to be susceptible to perceptual biases of the supervisors.
When all data take place in the MRP II system, objective scores for
effectiveness measures can be used for assessments which produce
much reliable results.

Finally, all participants in this study represented a single orga-
nization, so organizational culture may have inﬂuenced the relative
importance of task performance and contextual performance.
Contextual performance may be more highly valued in more
democratic, team-based organizations, whereas task performance
may be more highly valued in more traditional, autocratic
organizations (Johnson, 2001). Future research in this area should
investigate how organization-speciﬁc norms inﬂuence perfor-
mance ratings.
