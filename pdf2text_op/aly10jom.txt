Conventional wisdom and recent research have supported the importance of employee positivity.
However, empirical analysis has not yet demonstrated potential added value of recently recognized
psychological capital over the more established positive traits in predicting work attitudes and
behaviors. This study found that psychological capital was positively related to extrarole organiza-
tional citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and negatively to organizational cynicism, intentions to quit, and
counterproductive workplace behaviors. With one exception, psychological capital also predicted
unique variance in these outcomes beyond demographics, self-evaluation, personality, and
person–organization and person–job fit. The article concludes with implications for future research
and practical application.

Keywords: psychological capital; core self-evaluations; organizational citizenship behaviors;

Avey et al. / Positive Psychological Capital

431

The concept of positive organizational behavior (POB) was introduced several years ago
(see Luthans, 2002a, 2002b; Wright, 2003) as a way to focus on bringing positive psychol-
ogy (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) to the workplace (see Luthans & Avolio, 2009,
and Luthans & Youssef, 2007, which trace the development and meaning of POB and pro-
vide an overall comprehensive literature review of POB, respectively). It has been defined as
“the study and application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychologi-
cal capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance
improvement” (Luthans, 2002b, p. 59; also see Wright, 2003). Using positivity, theoretical
foundation, valid measurement, statelike developmental potential, and performance impact
as their criteria for inclusion, Luthans and colleagues (see Luthans, 2002a; Luthans &
Youssef, 2007; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007) identified from the positive psychology liter-
ature efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism as being especially (but not exclusively) rele-
vant to POB (also see Stajkovic, 2006, which also focuses on these four constructs in a
core-confidence theoretical model).

Although each of these psychological resources has differing theoretical perspectives and
definitions, efficacy is defined here as “one’s conviction (or confidence) about his or her
abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action needed to
successfully execute a specific task within a given context” (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998b, p. 66).
Hope is defined as “a positive motivational state that is based on an interactively derived
sense of successful (a) agency (goal-directed energy) and (b) pathways (planning to meet
goals)” (Snyder, Irving, & Anderson, 1991, p. 287). Optimism is both a positivity-oriented
future expectation (Carver & Scheier, 2002) and an attributional style that interprets specific
positive events through personal, permanent, and pervasive causes and negative events
through external, temporary, and situation-specific ones (Seligman, 1998). Resiliency is “the
capacity to rebound or bounce back from adversity, conflict, failure, or even positive events,
progress, and increased responsibility” (Luthans, 2002a, p. 702). Taken together, these four
have been theoretically developed and empirically tested as a statelike positive core construct
termed psychological capital (PsyCap; Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007; Luthans,
Youssef, et al., 2007). Specifically, PsyCap is defined here as:

An individual’s positive psychological state of development that is characterized by: (1) having
confidence (self efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challenging
tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now and in the future;
(3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary, redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to
succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even
beyond (resilience) to attain success. (Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007, p. 3)

Following the lead of positive psychology, considerable attention has recently been devoted
to POB in general (e.g., see the review article in the Journal of Management, Luthans &
Youssef, 2007, and two special issues in Journal of Organizational Behavior edited by Bakker
& Schaufeli, 2008, and Wright & Quick, 2009) and PsyCap in particular (e.g., see Luthans,
Avolio, et al., 2007; Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007). Even though the field of organizational
behavior has probably given relatively more attention over the years to positive constructs
than has psychology, there is a recent renewed focus on POB (Luthans & Avolio, 2009).


432

Journal of Management / March 2010

However, at this stage in the development of POB, empirical analysis is needed to assess
whether recently emerging constructs such as PsyCap add value to the already established
positive trait constructs such as self-evaluation, Big Five personality dimensions, and person-
job or -organization fit in predicting important, yet to date untested, work behaviors and atti-
tudes, such as desired organizational citizenship and undesired cynicism, intentions to quit,
and counterproductive actions.

Overarching Theoretical Framework

that may necessitate a different

Positive psychology claims neither discovery nor monopoly of positivity, only a shift and
reemphasis
lens or perspective (Seligman &
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Similarly, Luthans and Avolio (2009) recently noted that POB is
sometimes accused of being old wine in a new bottle. Reacting to the old-wine metaphor,
they asserted that POB is at minimum being served in a new restaurant. This metaphor refers
to the changing environment facing today’s organizations (e.g., globalization, advanced
technology), the relative novelty of some of the constructs (e.g., hope, optimism, and
resiliency) to the field of organizational behavior, and the changing expectations of employ-
ers (e.g., organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) vs. just in-role performance) and
employees (e.g., lifelong development and alternative career paths vs. employment based on
seniority security and a paycheck).

This new context in which positivity research (and practice) currently takes place may not
readily lend itself to conventional wisdom nor traditional conceptual models. Although POB
includes the scientific process for its foundation and inclusion criteria, the outlook of positive
conceptual frameworks, although deeply grounded in the wealth of existing theories and
empirical findings to date, may be relatively unique. For example, a primary emphasis on
organizational efficiency goals (e.g., financial and subjectively rated employee performance)
may need to be integrated with meeting the needs of the organization’s other important assets,
namely, its leaders and associates, for jobs and careers that provide identity, meaning, and ful-
fillment, and organizations that are caring, compassionate, and virtuous (e.g., Youssef &
Luthans, 2008; also see Wright & Goodstein, 2007; Wright & Huang, 2008). Although impor-
tant and significant in their own right, many human-oriented organizational initiatives are not
recognized or given credibility because of the inherent difficulties in justifying them in quan-
tifiable, return-on-investment terms. PsyCap aligns the pursuit of positivity, flourishing, and
human fulfillment at work, with the bottom-line-oriented measures required for adequate
resource allocation within the realities of today’s competitive environment. This need for a
new perspective has recently stimulated the development of an integrated conceptual model
characterized by balanced and multilevel perspectives and a broad set of outcomes (see
Youssef & Luthans, in press) and can be used as a theoretical framework for this study.

A Balanced Perspective

Although more positively oriented than mainstream and especially clinical psychology,
organizational behavior research tends to focus on one side of the (positive-to-negative)


Avey et al. / Positive Psychological Capital

433

continuum, often to the exclusion of the other (e.g., stress, not eustress, or satisfaction, not
dissatisfaction). Specialization has led many researchers to emphasize their areas of expertise
(which may focus on positive, neutral, or negative constructs), with limited, if any, attention
given to the other side. If POB does not adopt a balanced perspective from its beginnings, it
can easily take a similarly myopic perspective. In other words, positive organizational behavior
may be shortsighted and hampered if it adopts an advocacy perspective and an exclusive bias
toward positive constructs. Instead, Luthans and Avolio (2009) have argued that integration
and a positive inquiry mode should be the aim of POB. This is especially true for constructs
and contexts in which the positive and the negative may represent qualitatively different, but
at the same time potentially coexisting, phenomena rather than opposite, mutually exclusive
ends of a single continuum (e.g., optimism vs. pessimism, see Peterson & Chang, 2002; also
see Hackman, 2009; Lazarus, 2003).

A Multilevel Perspective

Because POB draws some of its uniqueness from the new realities of today’s workplace
(i.e., the new restaurant), it is unlikely that an isolated emphasis on the individual level of
analysis without considering contextual factors will yield meaningful findings. In fact, one
of the major criticisms of the positivity literature is its preoccupation with individual-level
variables, whereas it is the cross-level interactions among individuals, groups, and the orga-
nizational and cultural context within which they relate that shape most of the outcomes
(Hackman, 2009). Although we believe that most individual-level, feel-good ideas tend to
come from the popular self-help literature, we assert the importance of considering multiple
levels of analysis in organizational behavior research in general and POB in particular.

Early on in the conceptualization of POB, Luthans and Avolio’s (2003) authentic leader-
ship model viewed the interaction of individual life experiences and a positive organizational
context as critical antecedents for the development of leaders’ PsyCap. Similarly, Youssef
and Luthans’s (2009) recent integrative model also takes into consideration organizational-
level factors such as organizational strategy, structure, culture, and recent changes, as well as
individual-level factors such as personality traits and previous life experiences, as antecedents
for PsyCap. In this integrative model, the interaction between the individual and the organi-
zational context is operationalized through the person–organization (PO) and person–job
(PJ) fit. Moreover, not only are individual-level outcomes of positivity considered, but also
short-term organizational efficiency (e.g., return on investment, stock value) and long-term
organizational effectiveness (e.g., long-term growth, increased market share, innovation,
social responsibility).

A Broader Set of Outcomes

Besides balance and multilevel perspectives, Youssef and Luthans’s (in press; also see
Youssef & Luthans, 2008) model also proposes a more holistic perspective that necessitates
the integration of work-related attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual behaviors. For


434

Journal of Management / March 2010

example, in the context of ethical decision making, Jones (1991) supported the need for inte-
grating attitudes and intentions in predicting positive ethical behaviors. Parallels can be
drawn between this ethical process and the impact of PsyCap. One such parallel is that the
impact of PsyCap may go beyond enhanced in-role performance to also include positive atti-
tudes, intentions, and contextual behaviors that can ultimately lead to desirable outcomes
such as ethical performance. In line with the need for this more holistic perspective is the
impact that positivity may have on various employee attitudinal and behavioral outcomes in
today’s workplace. It is important that this integrative model proposes that there is a need to
examine the impact of PsyCap on both desirable and undesirable behaviors and attitudes.

As with any domain, we acknowledge that it would be challenging to expect every study
that investigates the role of positivity in the workplace to comprehensively incorporate the
full breadth of individual and contextual factors, as well as the attitudinal, intentional, behavioral,
and performance outcomes related to positivity. However, given the nature of positivity in
the workplace and the need for an integrated framework and a holistic perspective, we sug-
gest that research is needed that at least analyzes a representative sample of these different
categories of variables. We also suggest that taking positivity out of its broader context of
antecedents, covariates, and outcomes without accounting (or at least controlling) for a
critical mass of these variables may be unrealistic.

The purpose of this study is to begin to test an integrated conceptual model of POB
(Youssef & Luthans, 2009) and also heed Hackman’s (in press) concerns about positivity
research’s preoccupation with only positive, individual-level variables, which may be of
limited direct economic value to organizations. We now turn our focus to the more specific
theoretical and research grounding for the recently emerging core construct of PsyCap.

PsyCap

PsyCap attempts to integrate and advance the positive approach to organizational behavior
in several ways. In addition to the POB inclusion criteria of being positive, theoretically based,
measurable, developmental, and performance related, PsyCap as defined in the introductory
comments is conceptualized, measured, and developed in terms of a statelike positive core
construct, to which each of the individual resources of efficacy, hope, optimism, and resiliency
synergistically contributes. Several foundational characteristics of this PsyCap core construct
require added emphasis before the study hypotheses are set forth.

PsyCap as a Statelike Construct

In terms of developmental potential, it is important to note that PsyCap, as well as each
of its constituent resources or capacities, is considered statelike, as found in the positive psy-
chological literature (e.g., for efficacy, see Bandura, 1997; hope, Snyder, 2002; resilience,
Masten & Reed, 2002; optimism, Carver & Scheier, 2002, and Seligman, 1998), rather than
just a fixed trait. Although positive traits and states do share some common characteristics,
both conceptually (e.g., positivity) and empirically (e.g., positive correlations, common
correlates, and related outcomes), recent theory-building and empirical research also supports


Avey et al. / Positive Psychological Capital

435

their distinctiveness and discriminant validity. For example, Luthans and Youssef (2007)
made the case for a trait–state continuum that encompasses the following:

Pure positive traits: These are at one extreme of the continuum and are characterized by stability
over time and across situations, including traits that are believed to be “hardwired,” such as intel-
ligence or hereditary characteristics.

Traitlike constructs: These are closer to the trait end of the continuum and refer to relatively stable
psychological characteristics such as conscientiousness, extroversion, and core self-evaluations
(CSEs).

Statelike psychological resources: These are closer to the opposite (state) end of the continuum and
include PsyCap and its constituents of efficacy, hope, optimism, and resiliency (the focus of this
study), which tend to be malleable and thus open to development and are particularly relevant
to the workplace.

Positive states: These are at the other extreme of the continuum and include momentary and highly
variable states such as moods and emotions (for related discussion, see also Luthans, Avolio,
et al., 2007; Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007; Youssef & Luthans, 2007).

Several cognitive, affective, and social mechanisms warrant the conceptual distinction
between PsyCap and other, related organizational behavior constructs that may share some,
but not all, of PsyCap’s characteristics and thus occupy varying locations on the trait–state
continuum described above. For example, Hannah and Luthans’s (2008) recent cognitive
affective processing system provides a theoretical framework that can help elucidate some
of these mechanisms. In this model, PsyCap is specifically proposed to result from dynamic
processes that activate the adaptive encoding of cognitive categories, expectancies, goals,
values, affects, and self-regulatory plans. These processes are selectively activated and con-
text specific. On the other hand, traits and traitlike characteristics are more global in nature,
are exhibited based on the chronic activation of certain sets of cognitive affective processing
units, and represent habitual or programmed responses that can be primed through exposure
to predetermined stimuli.

For example, although some people may exhibit generalized efficacy (a traitlike, not
statelike, construct as conceptualized by Bandura, 1997), which may cause them to come
across as confident individuals over time and across situations, others may seem to lack this
confidence. On the other hand, self-efficacy (a statelike capacity as conceptualized by
Bandura, 1997, and a key component of PsyCap) is more domain-specific and can be devel-
oped for a specific set of tasks (e.g., a job) through mastery experiences, modeling, social
persuasion, and physiological and psychological arousal (Bandura, 1997). These develop-
mental components as conceptualized by PsyCap can create positive expectancies, trigger
the creation of goals with an approach orientation (rather than avoidance or complacency),
and motivate self-regulatory mechanisms that increase the probability of perseverance and
success in a particular situation.

Similarly, each of PsyCap’s other identified capacities possesses this developmental and
contextualized nature (e.g., hope requires effectively setting specific goals and the determi-
nation and pathways to achieve them, optimism requires active causal attributions for specific
events, and resiliency requires successful bouncing back from specific setbacks). PsyCap’s
foundation also draws from social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1997), which establishes


436

Journal of Management / March 2010

reciprocal interactions among the person, the environment, and past behavior. This theory
provides added support for the distinction between general personality traits or traitlike
characteristics such as found in the Big Five dimensions and the more contextualized and
malleable PsyCap construct.

On the other hand, statelike PsyCap is not as transient and momentary as the more
extreme states such as moods or emotions. For example, unlike emotions, whose at-the-
moment meaning and intensity may be constructed through subjectively negotiated appraisal
processes for more effective coping (Lazarus, 2003), PsyCap capacities share a cognitive
agentic component that needs to reach and maintain a certain threshold of intensity and
endurance in order to result in measurable success and tangible goal achievement. Although
positive emotions may exist as a by-product of the accomplishment of more concrete goals
and objectives, the performance impact inclusion criterion of POB and PsyCap goes far
beyond “emotion focused coping” (a more benign reappraisal of a harmful or threatening sit-
uation; Lazarus, 2003, p. 95) and even “problem focused coping” (a more action-oriented
initiative to change the situation, Lazarus, 2003, p. 95).

Empirically, the distinction between traits and states has been supported by very high test-
retest correlations for recognized traits such as personality (e.g., Conley, 1984) and highly
significant but still relatively lower correlations for statelike constructs such as PsyCap (e.g.,
see Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007). Relatively short training interventions have also been suc-
cessfully implemented to develop PsyCap (Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Norman, & Combs, 2006;
Luthans, Avey, & Patera, 2008). Based on such empirical findings and others, Wright (1997)
emphasized the importance of time as a main effect variable in organizational behavior
research, and proposed stability over 6 months as an operationalization of the temporal dis-
tinction between traits and states.

PsyCap as a Core Construct

The integration of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism represents the core construct
of PsyCap. This PsyCap can be considered a multidimensional construct identified by these
four positive psychological resources. To address theoretical rationale and construct validity
of PsyCap, two important aspects need to be especially emphasized: (a) the convergent and
discriminant validity between PsyCap and other positive constructs and (b) the convergent
and discriminant validity between PsyCap’s constituent capacities. We addressed parts of the
first point earlier by clarifying some of the subtle but important differences between PsyCap
as a statelike construct and other similar capacities that lie at different points of a trait–state
continuum. Elsewhere (e.g., see Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007), a wide variety of positive
psychological constructs, such as wisdom, courage, and emotional intelligence, have been
assessed for their fit with the identified POB inclusion criteria. However, to date, efficacy,
hope, optimism, and resilience continue to offer the best-fitting resource components for
PsyCap (see Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007). For example, many constructs from the positivity
literature may be of terminal value (valuable in their own right, e.g., compassion) but not
necessarily because of their measurable performance impact. Others may be traitlike (or at least
closer to the trait end of the continuum) and thus lend themselves only to lifelong development


Avey et al. / Positive Psychological Capital

437

rather than to the short developmental interventions commonly utilized in the workplace.
Still others may be intuitively appealing but lack theoretical support or valid measurement
(e.g., much of the popular personal development literature).

By the same token, PsyCap converges with several more established and relevant positive
constructs. For example, a similar, but traitlike, multidimensional construct is CSEs, which
include self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, locus of control, and emotional stability. CSEs
are fundamental, subconscious self-appraisals that generally affect individuals’ evaluations of
themselves, the world, and others and have been found to globally influence their appraisals
and behaviors across situations (Judge & Bono, 2001). Conceptual similarities appear evident
between the components of PsyCap and CSEs (e.g., general and specific efficacy, locus of con-
trol and an optimistic explanatory style, emotional stability and resilience). Similar to PsyCap,
research supports self-evaluations as a core construct to which the four traitlike characteristics
contribute (Judge & Bono, 2001). To date, empirical findings support convergent (r = .6) and
discriminant validity between PsyCap and CSEs (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007).

Concerning the second point on PsyCap’s being a multidimensional core construct, the
convergent and discriminant validity between PsyCap’s four component capacities have also
been supported by previous research (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007). In other words, despite
the apparent conceptual similarities and overlap between hope, resiliency, optimism, and
efficacy, each of these positive constructs has conceptually and empirically been analyzed
and demonstrated to have construct validity. For example, conceptually, efficacy and hope
share the components of internalized motivation and energy, or the positive expectation of
success for the reason of belief in one’s individual abilities. Highly efficacious and hopeful
employees both set challenging goals for themselves and self-select into challenging assign-
ments with motivation and tenacious effort toward success. However, the pathways compo-
nent, which constitutes waypower, or the ability to generate alternative pathways toward
specific goals, is unique to hope. A hopeful individual’s propensity to develop alternative,
contingency, or backup plans for accomplishing the same goal constitutes what Snyder
(1994) referred to as fallibility insurance, whereby people remain hopeful in goal accom-
plishment because there will always be an alternative route to pursue. Hopeful individuals
are never out of options; they sustain hope of eventual success. Thus, hope can provide added
substance, namely, more pathways to consider, for the internalized motivation, energy, and
perseverance of an efficacious person.

As another example, efficacy, hope, and optimism all share positive expectancies about
the future. However, optimism may be more general in nature and may constitute a global
positive expectation of success, whereas hope and self-efficacy tend to be more specific to a
particular goal or domain. Thus, optimism about the future can be capitalized on in domains
in which efficacy or hope has not been previously built. Furthermore, unlike efficacy and
hope, in which positive expectancies are internalized and attributed to one’s effort and moti-
vation, an optimistic explanatory style may use other people or situational factors as refer-
ents, especially when externalizing negative events. Similarly, resiliency is not limited to an
internalized, agentic perspective but expands the circle of influence to include social support
and other organizational-level resources and buffering mechanisms. This perspective goes
beyond the modeling and vicarious learning contribution of others in building efficacy to
incorporate other resources from the environmental context that may be drawn on when


438

Journal of Management / March 2010

internal resources are lacking, depleted, or otherwise inadequate or to buffer the influence of
risk factors that may be beyond the individual’s capacity to handle. Examples of buffering
mechanisms from the organizational context include organizational sensemaking, organiza-
tional learning, and collective schemata or mental models development.

In addition, whereas efficacy, hope, and optimism tend to be proactive in nature, resilience
is most often expressed in a reactive mode, as a response to a setback. However, resilience
shares several interesting characteristics with efficacy, hope, and optimism. Both efficacy
and resilience have an underlying perseverance component that motivates endurance in the
face of obstacles. Although the context of the setbacks may be different (characterized by
pursuit of specific self-set goals that is proactive in the context of efficacy but reactive in
resilience), both capacities motivate persistence and a keeping-at-it outlook.

Hope and resilience also share a process orientation, in which the mechanisms that link the
person to the desired outcomes are most critical for success. According to Masten and Reed
(2002), resilience is comprised of adaptational processes, which are mechanisms developed by
highly resilient individuals to effectively employ their available assets (e.g., cognitive, affec-
tive, social, financial, and other positive characteristics, skills, and resources) to mitigate the
impact of their risk factors (e.g., weaknesses, deficiencies, and other negative factors that have
the potential to amplify setbacks). Resilience is manifested when appropriate adaptational
processes are used to draw on the right assets to withstand or recover from setbacks fueled by
risk factors. In the same way that the process of generating alternative pathways is integral for
the sustenance of hope, the effectiveness of one’s adaptational processes may be more critical
for resilience than the simple additive sum of existing assets and risk factors.

As indicated in the introductory definition and noted by Luthans, Avolio, et al. (2007), the
underlying common agentic capacity running through the four components of PsyCap is the
“positive appraisal of circumstances and probability for success based on motivated effort and
perseverance” (p. 550). In other words, in addition to meeting the POB inclusion criteria, the
common denominator for the convergence of PsyCap’s four constituent psychological capac-
ities is represented by a core factor of internalized agency, motivation, perseverance, and suc-
cess expectancies. On the other hand, the extent and nature of environmental influences, and
the adaptational mechanisms and goal achievement processes, vary across the four capacities,
making each capacity’s contribution unique to the multidimensionality of PsyCap.

Other explanatory frameworks for integrating these four positive psychological resources
were described by Hobfoll (2002) in his review of various psychological resource theories
and by Stajkovic (2006), who theoretically linked these four constructs into a core-confidence
model. Law, Wong, and Mobley (1998) also proposed that a second-order factor comprising
four indicators such as PsyCap is best considered as composed of the shared variance between
each component. This second-order core factor of PsyCap, consisting of the shared variance
of hope, efficacy, optimism, and resilience, has recently been empirically demonstrated
(Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007). It is important that this previous research, which used a com-
peting measurement models analysis, found PsyCap was best measured as a second-order
factor, whereby each of the four dimensions loads onto the overall core factor (PsyCap), and
usefulness analysis indicated PsyCap was more consistently related to both performance and
satisfaction than each of the individual components by themselves (Luthans, Avolio, et al.,
2007).


Avey et al. / Positive Psychological Capital

Considerable empirical findings have demonstrated both convergent and discriminant
validity of the four positive constructs that make up PsyCap (e.g., see Bryant & Cvengros,
2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Magaletta & Oliver, 1999), including when analyzed with
employee samples (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007). Overall, this conceptual and empirical
analysis provides considerable support for PsyCap as a core construct made up of the four
identified positive resources.

PsyCap and Workplace Outcomes

As indicated, the overarching theoretical framework for this study makes the case that
examining in-role performance should be supplemented with a balanced combination of
desirable and undesirable attitudinal and behavioral outcomes (see Youssef & Luthans, in
press). Because the relationships between PsyCap and desirable attitudinal outcomes such as
job satisfaction, job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and organizational com-
mitment have already been empirically supported (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007; Luthans,
Norman, Avolio, & Avey, 2008), this study expands the boundaries of positivity research by
investigating the negative attitude of cynicism relevant to today’s workplace (for the role cyn-
icism may play in positive organizational change, see Avey, Wernsing, & Luthans, 2008).

Organizational participants with higher PsyCap are likely to experience lower levels of
cynicism, for several reasons. First, as discussed earlier, higher levels of PsyCap capacities
such as hope and optimism have been shown to trigger positive emotions (Snyder, Harris,
et al., 1991) as a by-product of positive appraisals and increased probabilities of success and
goal accomplishment. Second, PsyCap’s agentic thinking has a motivating impact that can
enhance internalization, determination, and pathways thinking, which contrast with the giv-
ing up and despair associated with cynicism. Third, hopeful people also experience fewer
negative emotions, even when faced with obstacles, primarily because of their waypower
(Snyder, Ilardi, Michael, & Cheavens, 2000). Together, increased positive emotions, moti-
vated agentic cognitions, and decreased negative emotions can help activate more positive
cognitive affective processing system units (e.g., positive expectancies, approach rather than
avoidance goals; see Hannah & Luthans, 2008) that can help reduce cynicism. On the other
hand, Snyder, Harris, et al. (1991: 571) argued that when hope is low, “analysis of insuffi-
cient agency and pathways in a given goal setting should lead to perceptions of relatively low
probability of goal attainment, a focus on failure rather than success, a sense of ambivalence,
and a relatively negative emotional state during goal related activities,” that is, cynicism.
Thus, we hypothesize the following:

Hypothesis 1: PsyCap will be negatively related to organizational cynicism.

Individuals who are higher in PsyCap are likely to have lower turnover intentions, for
several reasons. Their higher levels of optimism regarding the future and confidence in their
ability to succeed in their current job will motivate them to take charge of their own destinies
(Seligman, 1998), self-select into challenging endeavors (Bandura, 1997), engage the nec-
essary efforts and resources, and persevere in the face of obstacles (Stajkovic & Luthans,


440

Journal of Management / March 2010

1998a), rather than become quitters. In addition, because of higher levels of resilience, even
when they experience negative events in the workplace, high-PsyCap individuals are more
likely to positively adapt and bounce back from those events, preventing the escalation and
development of intentions to quit. Finally, those higher in the hope capacity are more able to
derive multiple pathways to be successful in the present job, further reducing the perceived
need to leave the organization.

Although for some, a viable pathway might be changing jobs (turnover), high hope tends
to motivate approach goals, in which a person chooses to actively pursue positive outcomes,
rather than avoidance goals, in which negative or threatening situations are simply shunned.
Moreover, turnover intentions have been conceptualized as a function of job satisfaction and
future expectancies in current versus alternative jobs, which in turn are based on economic
and labor market conditions (Mobley, Griffeth, Hand, & Meglino, 1979). Given the support
to date for a positive relationship between PsyCap and job satisfaction (Luthans, Avolio, et al.,
2007), it follows that high PsyCap would be a negative, rather than a positive, predictor of
turnover intentions, especially given the negativity of the recent economic environment.
Based on the above, the following is hypothesized for this study:

Hypothesis 2: PsyCap will be negatively related to intentions to quit the organization.

PsyCap is expected to be related not only to work attitudes and behavioral intentions but
also to extrarole behaviors in organizations. As cited earlier, both theory and empirical find-
ings are emerging that support the positive relationships between PsyCap and desirable
behaviors leading to performance and negative relationships with undesirable behaviors such
as absenteeism. This study expands the boundaries of the existing POB literature by con-
currently investigating both desirable and undesirable contextual performance indicators,
operationalized as OCBs and counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs)

OCBs are those desirable behaviors that are not prescribed by or enforced in the existing
job role but may be practiced at the option of the individual employee. Lee and Allen (2002)
noted that OCBs can be separated into two distinct referents. First, individual-oriented OCBs
are those that use others as the referent. This may include staying late on the job to help a
coworker or supporting a newcomer to the group. The second referent for OCBs is the orga-
nization. Organizationally oriented OCBs are those behaviors that support the organization.
This may include attending organizational events that are not required or doing volunteer work
in the community to indicate support from the employer. The extrarole, above-and-beyond
nature of OCBs is particularly relevant to a broader, holistic, integrated outcome from posi-
tivity. This is especially true given the narrowness and short-term orientation of most perfor-
mance appraisal and reward systems in today’s organizations.

Opposing the positive OCBs are the negatively oriented CWBs. Bennett and Robinson
(1995) defined these as “voluntary behavior that violates significant organizational norms,
and in doing so threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both” (p. 556 ; also
see Bennett & Robinson, 2000). CWBs can be expressed in the form of interpersonally
deviant behaviors, such as harassment of, violence against, gossip about, or theft from a
coworker. They can also take the form of organizationally deviant behaviors, such as inten-
tionally working at a slower rate, sabotaging company property, or sharing confidential

company information (Robinson & Bennett, 1995). However, interpersonal and organiza-
tional deviance are highly correlated, and the distinction between them has been critiqued
recently (Berry, Ones, & Sackett, 2007). Recent empirical studies have indicated that
momentary negative emotions (discussed earlier as a component of cynicism) are positively
related, and job satisfaction is negatively related, to CWBs (Judge, Scott, & Ilies, 2006).

Despite the significant (negative) correlation between OCBs and CWBs, recent empirical
findings support OCBs and CWBs as two distinct constructs, with different correlates and
consequences, rather than opposite ends of a single continuum (Sackett, Berry, Wiemann, &
Laczo, 2006), making them particularly relevant for the balanced perspective of outcomes
proposed for this study. Moreover, despite some overlap, the behavioral expressions of OCBs
and CWBs are conceptually distinct. For example, although refusing to help a coworker
constitutes a counterproductive behavior, an OCB may go beyond just extending the help that
the coworker asks for to also doing so without expecting any material rewards, recognition,
or reciprocation, and even encouraging the coworker to ask for help again in the future.

Individuals higher in PsyCap would seem to be more likely to engage in OCBs than would
those with lower PsyCap, for several reasons. In general, employees who are more positive
would seem to exhibit more OCBs than employees who tend to be negative. Several relevant
mechanisms could provide support for the conceptualization of this relationship. For example,
Fredrickson’s (2003) model supports a broadening contribution of positive emotions, in which
people experiencing those emotions use broader thought–action repertoires, increasing the
potential for proactive extrarole behaviors such as sharing creative ideas or making suggestions
for improvement. There are also recent organizationally based studies that have used this
broaden-and-build model to test the role of positively oriented psychological well-being as a
moderator of both the relationship between job satisfaction–job performance (Wright,
Cropanzano, & Bonett, 2007) and job satisfaction–employee turnover (Wright & Bonett,
2007). Besides this research support for the role of positive well-being for both in-role perfor-
mance and turnover behaviors, the specific characteristics of the positive psychological
resources that constitute PsyCap—namely, hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy—may, we
propose, lead to more frequent engagement in extrarole (i.e., broaden-and-build) OCBs.

To understand a negative relationship between PsyCap and CWBs, an examination of the
source of CWBs seems important. Specifically, Fox and Spector (1999) advanced the argu-
ment that workplace constraints, acting as stressors, are the primary cause of CWBs. First,
employees are exposed to stressors (e.g., having to rely on incompetent colleagues in order
to personally succeed) and then respond with CWBs (e.g., failing to help a coworker or
sabotage). An important mechanism in the relationship may be that individuals higher in
PsyCap are less susceptible to the negative influence of stressors and thus exhibit fewer
CWBs. Specifically, those high in PsyCap may be more resilient to stressful events, stres-
sors, and setbacks (Masten & Reed, 2002) and do not experience the negative repercussions
as strongly. In addition, when exposed to stressors, instead of responding with CWBs, indi-
viduals high in PsyCap would be expected to remain optimistic that the situation will
improve (Carver & Scheier, 2002), generate plans and pathways to change the situation for
the better (Snyder et al., 2000), and feel efficacious in their own abilities to persevere in the
situation and continue being successful despite the adversity (Bandura, 1997). Thus, instead
of responding to stressors with CWBs, those higher in PsyCap respond by positively


442

adapting to the situation and becoming successful. Based on the above, the final two study
hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis 3: PsyCap will be positively related to OCBs.
Hypothesis 4: PsyCap will be negatively related to CWBs.

Control Variables

In this study, we offer that given the statelike, developable nature of PsyCap (Luthans,
Avey, et al., 2006; Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2008), the value-added con-
tribution of PsyCap to workplace outcomes can be better understood and assessed when con-
trolling for dispositional, stable, traitlike characteristics. Based on the overarching conceptual
framework discussed earlier, in addition to traditional demographic control variables, we have
selected the Big Five personality traits of conscientiousness and extroversion, as well as CSE
traits, as control variables. These widely recognized positive traits have been shown to have
significant impact on performance (e.g., Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge & Bono, 2001). It fol-
lows that they should be accounted for when attempting to study the added value of PsyCap,
especially given the conceptual similarities between them. For example, conscientiousness,
which has one of the strongest reported relationships with work performance across various
jobs and industries, includes responsibility, self-discipline, hard work, and persistence. These
traitlike characteristics may overlap with PsyCap in terms of the more statelike resources of
efficacy’s motivated hard work, hope’s willpower, optimism’s internalized attributions, or
resiliency’s perseverance. Similarly, extroverts may be more able to reach out to others, build-
ing more of the social assets that can contribute to their resiliency, and tend to use external
referents when making attributions in their optimistic explanatory style.

Despite the primarily cognitive nature of PsyCap, it is not devoid of emotions, which tend
to be a by-product of positive cognitive processing of the personal and situational factors at
hand (see earlier discussion and Hannah & Luthans, 2008). Thus, controlling for the CSE
trait of emotional stability (or neuroticism) would factor out the traitlike affective component
that may confound the contribution of PsyCap, by accounting for an individual’s disposition
toward being calm, secure, or generally unworried, instead of having built efficacy or created
effective pathways for hope. Recent meta-analytic findings also support emotional stability
as the strongest of the Big Five personality traits in predicting turnover intentions, followed
by conscientiousness and extroversion (Zimmerman, 2008). Because turnover intentions are
among the outcome variables investigated in this study, it is important to analyze the contri-
bution of PsyCap over and above such traits.

Besides controlling for established positive traits, in line with the overarching conceptual
framework driving this study, we also recognize the critical role that the organizational
context may play in enhancing or hindering the development of PsyCap, as well as in facili-
tating or hindering its impact on employee outcomes. We posit that the role of the organiza-
tional context
is often inseparable when attempting to understand workplace human
variables in general and PsyCap development and management in particular. Hannah and
Luthans (2008) also conceptualized PsyCap in terms of the in situ dynamic activation of cog-
nitive affective processing system units and based the fit between the person’s self-construct

and perceived situational demands. Drawing from Youssef and Luthans’s (in press) concep-
tual model, this study specifically examines the role of PO fit and PJ fit due to their integra-
tion of individual and organizational variables, as well as the potential reciprocal relationships
between those variables. PO fit can be defined as the degree of congruence or complementary
relationship between individuals and their organizations in terms of goals, needs, supplies
(capabilities, resources), values, norms, or behaviors (Chatman, 1989; Kristof, 1996).

PJ fit refers to the compatibility or match between a person’s traits, needs, knowledge,
skills, and abilities, on one hand, and the demands of the job (Caldwell & O’Reilly, 1990).
Person–situation fit in general has established relationships with desirable performance and
attitudinal outcomes. For example, the Gallup studies supported that people who are placed
in jobs that match their talents, and who work for strengths-based organizations that develop
them along the individuals’ areas of strength, tend to experience higher engagement and
well-being, resulting in higher performance (Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002). Because PO
and PJ fit can contribute to performance and attitudinal outcomes in their own right (e.g.,
Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson, 2005), as well as indirectly through providing a
supportive environment for the development of PsyCap that can in turn enhance those desir-
able outcomes, it is important to account for the contribution of PO and PJ fit in order to real-
istically assess the added contribution of PsyCap.

Method

This study used a sample of 336 employees, from a wide cross section of organizations
and jobs, who agreed to participate in a large midwestern university-sponsored research
project on leadership and motivation. Of the participants, 60% were in nonmanagement posi-
tions, and approximately 38% were in positions that included supervision (from first-level
manager to CEO or owner). Participants had an average age of 32 years and average job
tenure of 12 years. Approximately 88% were White, 3% Asian, 1% African American, and
a very small percentage Hispanic and Native American. Overall, 7% of participants did not
list ethnicity. One third reported having obtained an undergraduate degree.

Measures

To assess PsyCap, the recently developed (see Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007) and psycho-
metrically analyzed (see Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007) 24-item PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ)
was used. This instrument has adapted 6 items each from published hope (Snyder et al.,
1996), efficacy (Parker, 1998), resilience (Wagnild & Young, 1993), and optimism (Scheier &
Carver, 1985) scales. The entire PCQ can be seen in Luthans,Youssef, et al. (2007, pp. 237-238),
and free permission can be obtained for research purposes at www.mindgarden.com. Sample
items include, “I feel confident helping to set targets/goals in my work area” (self-efficacy);
“Right now I see myself as being pretty successful at work” (hope agency); “If I should find
myself in a jam at work, I could think of many ways to get out of it” (hope pathways); “When
I have a setback at work, I have trouble recovering from it, moving on” (reverse scored
resiliency); and “I always look on the bright side of things regarding my job” (optimism).

In this study, each subscale (efficacy = .92, hope = 87, resilience = .83, optimism = .78)
and the overall PCQ (.95) demonstrated adequate internal reliability. In addition to internal
reliability, using MPlus, a confirmatory factor analysis, conducted with maximum likelihood
techniques, replicated the second-order factor structure previously reported by Luthans,
Avolio, et al. (2007). Specifically, this analysis conducted confirmatory factor analytic model
comparisons to determine the statistically best performing measurement model. To this end,
the four components were each modeled (a) as individual factors, (b) as subfactors of the
PsyCap latent factor, and (c) with all 24 items loading onto a single latent factor. Using χ2
difference tests, this analysis found that the hypothesized model (Model 2), in which the
dimensions were distinct and represented as indicators of a core underlying factor
(PsyCap), emerged as the superior model in terms of model fit (see Luthans, Avolio, et al.,
2007, p. 559). In terms of the present confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Hu and Bentler
(1999) described the combinatorial rule that if the standardized root mean square residual
(SRMR) meets the cutoff criteria and the comparative fit index (CFI) or root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA) meets the criteria, then there is satisfactory model fit. Hu
and Bentler noted the recommended cutoffs are CFI < .95, RMSEA < .08, and SRMR <
.06. Accordingly, this CFA revealed adequate factor analytic fit (SRMR = .05, RMSEA =
.05, CFI = .96.). Item loadings for the 24 items ranged from .67 to .95, and there were no sig-
nificant cross-loaded items. In addition, each dimension loaded on the overall PsyCap factor
as follows: efficacy = .87, hope = .95, resilience = .88, and optimism = .84.

In addition to the PsyCap measure, all the other measures used in this study were existing pub-
lished instruments and revealed adequate internal reliability (α ≥.70), as seen in the diagonals
of Table 1. Personality traits were conscientiousness and extroversion (the most commonly used
two of the Big Five personality traits and, as discussed earlier, most relevant to this study). They
were each measured with 10-item instruments developed by Goldberg et al. (1999; 2006). Each
scale includes 5 positive and 5 reverse-coded items. Example items from the extroversion scale
are “I make friends easily” and “I keep in the background.” Example items from the conscien-
tiousness scale are “I am always prepared” and “I find it difficult to get down to work.” CSE traits
(CSETs; α =.86) were measured using Judge and colleagues’ (Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge,
Erez, Bono, & Thoresen, 2003) 12-item instrument. Items were on a scale from 1 to 6, ranging
from strongly disagree to strongly agree. An example item is “I get the success in life I deserve.”
Cynicism was measured using a 12-item instrument developed by Wanous, Reichers, and
Austin (2000). A sample item from this scale is “Most of the programs that are supposed to
solve problems around here won’t do much good.” Intentions to quit were measured with
Bluedorn’s (1982) instrument, which asks individuals to rate the chances that they will be
employed with the organization in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Ratings for the
PCQ, CSET, personality, and cynicism were based on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging
from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

CWBs were measured using 10 items from Fox and Spector’s (1999) CWBs scale, which
has demonstrated strong psychometric properties. Example items are “purposely ignored
your boss” and “failed to help a co-worker.” Ratings were on a 6-point Likert-type scale
ranging from hardly, if ever to frequently, if not always. From this instrument, 10 items were
chosen to reduce scale length. The chosen items represented 5 interpersonal deviance items
and 5 organizational deviance items. The specific items selected from each dimension were
the ones with the highest reported frequency in Fox and Spector’s work.

OCBs were measured with Lee and Allen’s (2002) OCB instrument, which uses eight
items for individual and eight items for organizational OCBs. Example items are “I go out
of my way to make new employees feel welcome in the work group” and “I offer ideas to
improve the functioning of the organization.”

PO and PJ fit were measured using Saks and Ashforth’s (1997) instruments, which
include four items for each type of fit. Example items are “To what extent does your per-
sonality match the personality or image of the organization?” (PO fit) and “To what extent
do your knowledge, skills, and abilities match the requirements of your job?” (PJ fit).

Procedure

Online data collection from participants who consented to participate was separated into
two time sessions separated by 7-14 days to help reduce common method bias (Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). At Time 1, participants completed the independent,
demographic, and other control variable instruments (PsyCap, CSEs, extroversion, consci-
entiousness, PO fit, and PJ fit). At Time 2, they completed the second portion of the surveys,
which included the dependant variables (cynicism, intentions to quit, OCBs, and CWBs).

Results

The means, standard deviations, and correlations for all study variables are presented in Table 1.
Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported as PsyCap was negatively related to cynicism (r = –.44,
p < .01) and intentions to quit (r = –.42, p < .01). Hypotheses 3 and 4 were also supported
as PsyCap was positively related to both individual OCBs (r = .40, p < .01) and organiza-
tional OCBs (r = .58, p < .01) and negatively related to CWBs (r = –.50, p < .01).

Journal of Management / March 2010

Multivariate tests were conducted using regression analyses. In Step 1 of the regression
model, the control variables of age, gender, tenure, annual salary, job level, and level of edu-
cation, as well as extroversion, conscientiousness, CSEs, PO fit, and PJ fit, were entered. In
Step 2, PsyCap was added to determine the extent to which PsyCap predicted variance in the
dependent variables above and beyond that of the control variables. As shown in Table 2,
PsyCap added significant unique variance to each of the dependent variables of cynicism
(∆R2 = .05, p < .05), intentions to quit (∆R2 = .02, p < .05), organizational OCBs (∆R2 = .02,
p < .05), and CWBs (∆R2 = .03, p < .05). However, PsyCap did not add significant variance
to the outcome of individual OCBs, the variance in which was mostly accounted for by extro-
version and PJ fit. Thus, in addition to being related to the dependent variables in the hypoth-
esized direction, PsyCap predicted unique variance in all the outcomes except individual OCBs
beyond the demographics, CSEs, extroversion, conscientiousness, PO fit, and PJ fit.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to test the relationships of the newly emerging positive core
construct of PsyCap within an overarching theoretical framework. This framework incorpo-
rates a balance of positive (e.g., organizational citizenship) and negative (e.g., cynicism,
intentions to quit, and counterproductive) attitudes and behavior, takes into consideration
contextual factors and individual difference antecedents, and integrates a broader range of
outcomes within a holistic perspective that would be relevant for the study of positivity. The
results generally support the hypothesized relationships. Another important contribution of
this study was that PsyCap was also shown to add variance over and above several widely
recognized positive personality and self-evaluation traits, as well as PO and PJ fit.

Obviously there are a host of other contextual factors and individual differences, as well
as other work-related outcomes, that need to be examined in future research to provide still
better understanding of the unique contribution of PsyCap. However, this study contributes
support to the relationship of PsyCap to desirable and undesirable employee behaviors and
attitudes and the added value of PsyCap over and above established traitlike positive con-
structs in organizational behavior in predicting these behaviors and attitudes.

The study results also provide several specific implications for both research and practice.
First, PsyCap was negatively related to organizational cynicism. Thus, it is possible that
those higher in PsyCap will be more supportive of organizational change, more flexible in
the change process, and adapt to change better than those lower in PsyCap. Given that cyn-
icism regarding organizational change can stifle organizational initiatives, development of
employee PsyCap emerges as a potential human resource management strategy to counter-
act cynicism and promote positive change in organizations (Avey et al., 2008). Future
research should expand the boundaries of PsyCap by testing its development and manage-
ment in settings where various types of change (e.g., evolutionary, revolutionary, structural,
cultural) are under way.

Second, PsyCap was negatively related to intention to quit. Given that intention to quit has
been demonstrated to predict turnover (Crossley, Bennet, Jex, & Burnfield, 2007), developing
PsyCap may be an effective way to at least indirectly reduce turnover. Future research can also

further investigate the mechanisms through which PsyCap contributes to turnover intentions
and actual turnover (e.g., main effects, partial or full mediation, interactions).

Third, PsyCap was found to be positively related to OCBs, suggesting that those higher
in PsyCap are more likely to engage in highly desirable extrarole behaviors that are so
beneficial to today’s organizations. Results also suggest that those who are higher in PsyCap
engage in not only more desirable behaviors (OCBs) but also fewer undesirable CWBs.

Future research and practice can capitalize on these findings in several ways. First, the
results can contribute empirically based input to the expanded framework for the wide range
of outcomes of positivity, both positive and negative. This can provide better understanding
of the nature of these outcomes, that is, whether they represent opposite ends of a single
continuum or two independent continua. The results can also contribute to better opera-
tionalization of performance. They provide insights into going beyond in-role performance that
is too often narrowly defined by outdated job descriptions and measured through short-term-oriented
performance appraisal systems to include significant, but often overlooked, behaviors that
matter in terms of long-term organizational effectiveness.

Some potential limitations of the study should be noted. First, although data collection for
the independent and dependent variables was separated over time to help reduce common
method bias, the data were collected in a cross-sectional research design. Although Podsakoff
et al. (2003) argued that this time separation procedure can help minimize the potential bias,
it still must be acknowledged that the potential for common method bias and bias due to
social desirability in the data, which may artificially inflate correlations and regression
weights, remains a problem when interpreting the results of this study.

Second, although this study includes a sample of antecedents, positive statelike capacities,
and positive and negative outcomes that range from attitudes to intentions to behaviors as
depicted in the overarching theoretical model that framed this study, there are many other
relevant variables that need to be included in future research before any generalized conclu-
sions can be drawn (see Youssef & Luthans, in press, for the comprehensive conceptual frame-
work). Some examples of variables drawn from the Youssef and Luthans (in press) framework
for future research include antecedents such as life experiences, positive psychological
resources such as wisdom and psychological well-being and negative states such as stress and
learned helplessness, attitudinal outcomes such as positive work happiness and negative disen-
gagement, behavioral intentions such as those concerned with morality, and behavioral out-
comes such as those concerned with positive ethics and actual turnover (negative).

Third, the additional variance explained by PsyCap ranged from 2% to 5%, which, although
statistically significant for four of the five outcome variables, may still be questioned. On the
other hand, applying utility analysis and other related methodologies to actual archival data
as well as a PsyCap intervention in a large aerospace firm indicates that such levels of
explained variance can potentially explain substantial revenues (in the millions of dollars in
large, medium, and even smaller firms; see Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007, pp. 217-223) and
a very high (more than 200%) return on investment (see Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans,
Youssef, et al., 2007; Youssef & Luthans, 2007).

Conclusion

To conclude, a positive profile of participants high in PsyCap emerges from this study. On
average, they tend to be less cynical and exhibit fewer CWBs, are good organizational citizens,
and intend to remain in the organization in the foreseeable future. Importantly, this positive pro-
file seems to go beyond the traditionally recognized positive traits of desirable employees and,
because it is statelike, is open to further development and have potential performance impact.
Previous research has demonstrated that PsyCap can be developed and is related to perfor-
mance, and in this study it is also shown to be positively related to desirable behaviors (OCBs)
and negatively to undesirable behaviors and attitudes (cynicism, CWBs, and intention to quit).
It is important that employees’ PsyCap may go beyond their demographics, positive traits, PO
fit and PJ fit. Investing in and developing and managing the PsyCap of organizational leaders
and human resources may provide a competitive advantage in meeting the growing challenges
facing organizations today and certainly in the future.
