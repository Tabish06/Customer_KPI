1. Introduction

This paper enriches the model of delight and satisfaction that Oliver et al. (1997) propose and Finn (2005)
modiﬁes, with a suggested causal relationship between disconﬁrmation and arousal and the introduction
of two new variables: the lodging unit’s corporate reputation and perceived quality. The modiﬁed model
is applied to rural tourism accommodations in Portugal and validated using PLS (Partial Least Squares).
The results suggest that the lodging unit’s reputation is a more signiﬁcant determinant of loyalty than
satisfaction or even delight. This study further supports the conceptualization of customer delight and
customer satisfaction as distinct constructs. Results may help managers of rural tourism accommodations
to develop and implement more successful relationship marketing strategies.

Conceptually, rural tourism is tourism in the countryside that
embraces the rural environment as pivotal to the product offered.
The OECD (1994) deﬁnes rural tourism as any “tourism taking
place in the countryside”. In this context, rural is the “central and
unique selling point in the rural tourism package” (OECD, 1994,
p. 15). Interest is growing amongst both academics and politi-
cians in understanding the rural tourism phenomenon, particularly
since rural tourism is oftentimes viewed as a development tool of
rural areas, which are economically and socially depressed (e.g.,
Kastenholz, 2005; Page and Getz, 1997).

Customer loyalty is a strategic issue for a company’s success
(Oliver, 1999; Reichheld, 1993). Following Petrick and Sirakaya
(2004), customer loyalty is a critical aspect because retaining cus-
tomers is more desirable and less expensive than attracting new
ones. As Rauyruen and Miller (2007, p. 22) point out, “Creating
a loyal customer base is not only about maintaining numbers
of customers overtime, but it is also about nurturing the rela-
tionship with customers to encourage their future purchase and
level of advocacy.” According to these authors’ literature review,
three main streams of research of loyalty may be distinguished:
behavioural loyalty, attitudinal loyalty and composite loyalty (con-
sidering the before mentioned two constructs). Consequently, in
customer research, the term customer loyalty is often measured by

indicators like the intention to continue buying the same product,
intention to buy more of the same product, and repeat purchase
(behavioural measures) or willingness to recommend the product
to others (attitudinal indicator, reﬂecting product advocacy).

While the behavioural indicator may be considered of more
concrete relevance to marketers (although intentions may only be
indicative of future behaviour), the attitudinal indicator may be
more valid (intentions to recommend may be a more foreseeable
future behaviour than the intention to repeat visitation). Although
loyalty may be more difﬁcult to achieve in tourism, due to the rele-
vance of novelty as a motivation, Kastenholz et al. (2006) identiﬁed
a loyal tourist market in rural North Portugal. The authors show a
strong positive correlation between the tourists’ familiarity with
the destination through prior visits as well as speciﬁc destination
image dimensions (nature and welcoming atmosphere) and desti-
nation loyalty, measured as future likelihood to come back to the
destination (Kozak and Rimmington, 2000; Kozak, 2001; Kozak and
Beaman, 2006).

Understanding the factors that inﬂuence rural tourists’ loyalty is
most important, since such knowledge should help governments,
tourism agencies, and operators to improve marketing planning
and investment decisions in the rural tourism context. Focusing on
the rural accommodation experience, this paper suggests an inte-
grated approach for a better understanding of the antecedents of
loyalty, based on an extended model of loyalty that has been devel-
oped by Oliver et al. (1997) for services marketing, considering the
impact of customer satisfaction, customer delight and corporate
reputation on loyalty. First, the article reviews antecedents of cus-
tomer delight and customer loyalty and proposes a model. Second,
an empirical study validates the model with data from tourists stay-
ing in rural tourism accommodation in North of Portugal, using a

2. Literature review

2.1. Deﬁnition of delight and its relations to satisfaction and
loyalty

The concept of customer delight arises in the 1990s, emerg-
ing in literature through the discussion of affective (Westbrook,
1987) and experimental (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982) dimen-
sions of consumption. Plutchik (1980) proposes a circumplex model
integrating eight basic emotions, which combine to generate more
numerous second level emotions. In Plutchik’s theory delight is a
mixture of joy and surprise, conceptually similar to Westbrook and
Oliver’s (1991) customer behaviour dimension “pleasant surprise”.
Later, Mano and Oliver (1993) ﬁnd a strong direct effect of
arousal on positive affect, with arousal as a direct antecedent of
affect and indirect determinant of satisfaction. Thus, arousal is
interpreted as playing an activation role in the emotional process
leading directly to delight and indirectly to satisfaction.

Kumar and Olshavsky (2007) report that customer satisfaction is
associated with meeting expectations (through the perception of a
fair service and the resulting good feeling), while customer delight
is associated with overcoming expectations leading to feelings of
happiness, euphoria, victory, intense satisfaction or optimism. Sim-

ilarly, Patterson (1997) argues that customer delight implies going
beyond satisfaction and providing the customer with what can be
described as a pleasant experience, with customer delight being
the best tool to increase the ratio of customer retention. Rust and
Oliver (2000) suggest that delight is more relevant in the follow-
ing circumstances: (1) when satisfaction has a strong inﬂuence on
behaviour intentions; (2) when customer satisfaction with compe-
tition has a strong impact on the company’s capacity of customer
retention; (3) when a signiﬁcant attention is paid to future beneﬁts;
and (4) when the organization is able to capitalize on unsatisﬁed
clients of competitors.

Oliver et al. (1997) stress the role of surprising consumption,
causing arousal and positive affect as the main antecedents of
delight. Arousal is presented as a function of surprising levels of
consumption. They also hypothesize that delight creates a desire for
further pleasurable service in the future: future intentions. Based
on the mentioned research, especially in Plutchik’s theory, emo-
tional theory, and Oliver et al. (1997), the following hypotheses are
proposed (see Fig. 1):

Surprising consumption exercises a positive impact on

The satisfaction sequence in this model is based in discon-
ﬁrmation paradigm of Oliver and starts with the traditional
disconﬁrmation of expectations construct as an exogenous initiator
of satisfaction. Disconﬁrmation is shown as inﬂuencing both satis-
faction and positive affect. So, disconﬁrmation and positive affect
are direct antecedents of satisfaction and intention is shown as a
consequence of satisfaction. Finally, it also considers that discon-
ﬁrmation and surprising consumption are correlated exogenous
variables. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed (see Fig. 1):

H4b. Positive effect impacts positively on satisfaction.

H5. Satisfaction impacts positively on loyalty.

H6a. Disconﬁrmation exercises a positive impact on positive
affect.

H6b. Disconﬁrmation exercises a positive impact on satisfaction.

Empirical evidence supports the model for two entertainment
services: symphony ticket purchase and theme park patronage.
However, the direct effect of delight on intention to consume was
signiﬁcant for symphony ticket purchase, but not for theme park
patronage. One possible explanation could be that delight cap-
tures a nonlinear, but inconsistent effect of satisfaction on intention
(Fullerton and Taylor, 2002; Mittal and Kamakura, 2001). Finn
(2005) applies Oliver et al.’ model (1997) to online retail services,
adding to the model a direct relationship between disconﬁrmation
and arousal. Correspondingly, in the present model we additionally
suggest:

H6c. Disconﬁrmation exercises a positive effect on positive affect.

Finn (2005) tries to solve the above mentioned problem of even-
tually nonlinear, but inconsistent effects of satisfaction on intention
incorporating nonlinear effects, quadratic and interaction effects.
Nevertheless, neither the quadratic nor the interaction effect yields
a conventional level of signiﬁcance. Rust and Oliver (2000) as well
as Torres and Kline (2006) argue that, if delight is considered a
function of customers’ expectations, then satisfaction is the log-
ical antecedent of delight. Schneider and Bowen (1999) propose
that satisfaction is the fulﬁlment of certain basic needs like secu-
rity or justice, whereas delight is the fulﬁlment of higher order
needs like self-esteem. However, generating delight among cus-
tomers can result in higher future expectations and the ﬁrm will
have more difﬁculties to generate delight repeatedly (Arnold et al.,
2005).

2.2. Corporate reputation and quality and their relation to
satisfaction and loyalty

Perceived service quality is widely seen as an antecedent of loy-
alty or consumers’ behavioural intentions (e.g., Fornell et al., 1996;
Loureiro and González, 2008; Parasuraman et al., 1994). Fornell
et al. (1996) also suggest that consumer expectations, or better, the
fulﬁlment of expectations (disconﬁrmation) may be a predictor of
perceived quality.

Zeithaml (1988) deﬁnes service quality as the customer’s assess-
ment of the overall excellence or superiority of the service.
Parasuraman et al. (1988) developed a 22-item instrument, recog-
nized as SERVQUAL, which is used widely as a generic instrument
for measuring service quality. They also proposed that a cus-
tomer’s assessment of overall service quality depends on the gap
between expectations and perceptions of actual performance lev-
els. Nevertheless, the relevant literature includes several studies
using a service quality construct (e.g., Cronin and Taylor, 1994;
Parasuraman et al., 1988). Additionally, for explaining variance in
dependent constructs, like loyalty, evidence from literature sup-
ports the use of performance perceptions for measuring service

quality (Parasuraman et al., 1994; Zeithaml et al., 1996). So, this
study uses a scale based on the SERVQUAL model (Parasuraman
et al., 1985, 1988, 1991), but assessing performance-only percep-
tions (Cronin and Taylor, 1994).

The tourism and the marketing literature independently
develop the conceptualization of the relationship between the con-
structs of quality and satisfaction. In tourism, several researchers
suggest that perceived quality is an antecedent of satisfaction
(e.g., Appiah-Adu et al., 2000; Loureiro and González, 2008).
Although most of previous studies indicate that service quality
inﬂuences loyalty indirectly through other variables like satisfac-
tion (e.g., Patterson and Spreng, 1997; Roest and Pieters, 1997;
Baker and Crompton, 2000), others argue for a direct effect (e.g.,
Parasuraman et al., 1988, 1991; Taylor and Baker, 1994; Zeithaml
et al., 1996). Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed (see
Fig. 1):

H6d. Disconﬁrmation exercises a positive impact on perceived
quality.

H7a. Perceived quality impacts positively on satisfaction.

H7b. Perceived quality impacts positively on loyalty.

However, the antecedents of customer loyalty do not apply only
to perceived quality, satisfaction, and even delight. Recent studies
include image as a critical factor, as well. Grönroos (1990) concep-
tualizes corporate image as the result of how customer perceives
the ﬁrm or, in other words, their vision of the company. Other
studies deﬁne corporate image as the impressions, beliefs, and feel-
ings that individuals have about a company (Barich and Kotler,
1991; Barich and Srinivasan, 1993). Hence, these studies concep-
tualize image as the customer’s mental representation of the ﬁrm
and emphasize the highly subjective nature of the concept. How-
ever, researchers broadly agree that the image (of both destination
and services) inﬂuences on tourist behaviour. Tourists strongly
rely on images, due to the intangible nature of the tourist expe-
rience, which is frequently acquired at a geographical, time and
even cultural distance, at their place of residence, thereby imply-
ing a particularly high level of risk (Bigné et al., 2001; Kastenholz,
2002).

Corporate and brand reputation, conceptualized as the aggre-
gate perception of outsiders on the salient characteristics of
companies, is one dimension of a more general tourism image
or brand (Fombrun and Rindova, 2000). Companies and brands
with a good reputation are likely to attract more customers,
while they will lose their positive reputation—and eventually
develop a negative reputation—if they repeatedly fail to ful-
ﬁl their stated intentions or marketing signals (Milewicz and
Herbig, 1994). Reputation is one of the primary contributors to
perceived quality of products carrying a brand name, with cus-
tomer expecting consistent quality provision over time (Milewicz
and Herbig, 1994). Customers correspondingly anticipate that
a brand will meet expectations, formed based on reputation
(Herbig and Milewicz, 1995). Thereby reputation can reduce per-
ceived risk, which has shown to be particularly high in the
tourism decision making process This way, the reputation of
a tourism provider exercises a positive inﬂuence on perceived
quality and satisfaction, because reputation moulds the expec-
tations that the individual forms before the visit, which will
then compare with the actual experience (Bigné et al., 2001; Chi
and Qu, 2007; Selnes, 1993; Setó Pamies, 2003). Based on the
above discussion, the following ﬁnal hypotheses are proposed (see
Fig. 1):

H8a. Corporate reputation exercises a positive impact on per-
ceived quality.

3. Methodology

The survey was administrated to tourists staying in rural lodg-
ing units in North Portugal by approaching them as they left the
unit. The Portuguese legislation deﬁnes rural tourism as a com-
bination of paid activities and services provided in rural areas, in
establishments with family character aiming at offering a complete
and diversiﬁed tourism product in rural areas, so as to preserve,
restore and value the regions’ architectonic, historical, natural and
landscape heritage (Dec.-Lei n◦ 54/2002).

The survey was conducted during the months of March and April
of 2008 in North Portugal. This region has the highest concentra-
tion of the country’s rural lodging units (INE, 2007). Data collection
aimed at an approximately representative sample of respondents
from these units in spring of 2008. Fifty ﬁve rural lodging units
(12% of the universe) were randomly selected from 448 existing
in the Northern region and the clients were approached by the
research team. The goals of this study were explained to the owners
and/or managers of the rural lodging units and only the guests that
were going to leave the accommodation and had already stayed
during at least one night were invited to complete the question-
naire, which was collected immediately. Almost two hundred (198)
guests were in conditions to answer the questionnaire, 32 did not
want to answer, 5 did not respond completely, and 161 were usable
for validating the model, corresponding to a response rate of 81%.
The questionnaire was elaborated in two languages, Portuguese
and English, with the help of language professors, to address both
the domestic and international market. Back translation was used
to ensure that both questionnaires communicated similar infor-
mation to all respondents (Brislin, 1970). A pilot sample (twenty
rural Portuguese and foreign tourists) was used to ensure that the
wording of the questionnaire was clear. Very few adjustments were
made in statements and the language professors reviewed the ﬁnal
questionnaire, ready for data collection.

For data analysis, a principal components analysis and Varimax
rotation method were used to reduce the 22 items of perceived
quality into a set of simpliﬁed composite service factors. Only fac-
tors with eigenvalue equal to or greater than one were considered
signiﬁcant. An item with factor loading equal to or greater than
0.5 was considered signiﬁcant and included in the analysis (Hair
et al., 1998). The coefﬁcient alpha of Cronbach was calculated to
analyze the internal consistency of each scale, that is, how closely
related a set of items are as a group, or better, as a single latent
variable. For modelling the suggested relationships, a Partial Least
Squares (PLS) approach was employed to estimate the structural
paths coefﬁcients, R2, Q2, together with the Bootstrap technique
(used to test the hypotheses). PLS is based on an iterative combina-
tion of principal components analysis and regression and aims at
explaining the variance of the constructs in the model (Chin, 1998).
This technique has the advantage of simultaneously estimating all
path coefﬁcients and individual item loadings in the context of a
speciﬁed model and, as a result, avoids biased and inconsistent
parameter estimates. Based on recent developments (Chin et al.,
2003), PLS has been conﬁrmed as an effective analytical tool to test
interactions by reducing type II error. Nevertheless, PLS models are
prediction-oriented, not based on covariance ﬁt, like the covari-
ance structure models developed by Karl Jöreskog (or the LISREL
program developed by Jöreskog and Sörborn). Another advantage
compared to the covariance approach is the sample size required.
PLS requires at least 10 times the number of items used for the most
complex construct, or at least10 times the number of predictors

of the dependent variable with the highest number of predictors,
while LISREL requires at least 100–150 cases (Gefen et al., 2000).

The PLS approach has several ﬁt indices available, such as
communality, redundancy measures, and the Stone-Geisser’s Q2
measure, which can be used to evaluate the predictive power of
the model (Barclay et al., 1995). Tenenhaus et al. (2005) propose
the geometric mean of the average communality (outer mode) and
the average R2 (inner model), within a range of values from 0 to 1
as overall goodness of ﬁt (GoF) measures for PLS (cross validated
PLS GoF): GoF =

communality · R2.

3.1. Variables and measurement

Perceived quality of the rural tourism accommodation was mea-
sured using a 22 items scale, named RURALQUAL (Loureiro, 2006;
Loureiro and González, 2008), based on the SERVQUAL model
(Parasuraman et al., 1985, 1988, 1991) but assessing performance-
only perceptions, following Cronin and Taylor (1994). Satisfaction
with a service provider was assessed using an eight items scale
adapted from previous researches (Bigné et al., 2001; Brady et al.,
2002; Setó Pamies, 2003), since this construct is here understood as
being both an evaluative and emotion-based response to a service
encounter (Oliver, 1997).

This study uses three items to assess the overall reputation of
the rural lodging establishment, in line with Selnes (1993) and
Veloutsou and Moutinho (2009), the ﬁrst item regarding the conﬁ-
dence in the rural lodging, the second assessing the absolute level
of reputation, and the third addressing the relative reputation as
compared with competitors. Six items adapted from previously
developed scales were used to measure loyalty (Bigné et al., 2001;
Zeithaml et al., 1996). Disconﬁrmation and delight were assessed
with two items each, surprising consumption, arousal, and positive
affect with three items respectively. All items of these ﬁve variables
were based on work developed by Oliver et al. (1997) and Finn
(2005). Each item of all variables mentioned above was recorded
on a 5-point scale.

4. Results

Table 1 shows the socio-demographic proﬁle of respondents,
characterized by a slight majority of male (54% of the sample), of
the age group between 21 and 40 years (61%) and a large majority
of domestic tourists (87%).

4.1. Dimensions of service quality

The principal component analysis for the perceived quality
items generated six factors that accounted for 69.2% of total vari-
ance as Table 2 shows.

All factor loadings are signiﬁcant since they are equal or greater
than 0.5. The alpha of Cronbach value (0.92) indicated a good reli-
ability or internal consistency of the RURALQUAL scale. The same
coefﬁcient for the six factors ranged from 0.75 to 0.84, which is also
indicative of a good reliability amongst the variables within each
dimension. Then, two sub-samples were selected randomly from

the original sample to validate the exploratory factorial analysis.
Since the communalities of the sub-samples present similar values
to those of the initial sample, the total variance explained being
also similar, and the factor loadings, after Varimax rotation, close
enough; the validity of the factorial analysis can be accepted.

The ﬁrst factor or dimension, called Professionalism, refers to
well presented meals, clean and neat appearance of the employees,
and the readiness to attend customers in a kind and personalized
way. The second factor, named Reservation, includes items reﬂect-
ing aspects of reservation of the accommodation. The third factor,
designed as Tangibility, groups items regarding aspects of clean-
ing, comfort and acclimatization of rooms, furniture, and other
aspects related to the lodging’s physical environment. Fourth, the
dimension Complementary Beneﬁts includes items referring to
the decoration and easy parking and access to the lodging. The
ﬁfth factor, named Rural and Cultural Environment, gathers items
reﬂecting the possibility of integrating into the rural way of life of
the region, such as typical gastronomy, fairs, special festivities and
other aspects of cultural and recreational interest. The sixth fac-
tor, called Basic Beneﬁts, refers to the natural beauty of the place,
the calm setting, the typical architecture, and the employees being
aware of their duties.

4.2. Structural equations

All latent variables were considered with the different items
included in the questionnaire, except for perceived quality (mea-
sured with the RURALQUAL scale) that was introduced into the

model with the six above presented dimensions (the overall mean
of all items in each dimension).

The adequacy of the measures is assessed by evaluating the
reliability of the individual items and the discriminant validity
of the constructs (Hulland, 1999). Item reliability is evaluated by
examining the loading of the measures on their corresponding con-
struct. All the loadings of scales measuring reﬂective constructs
approach or exceed 0.707, which indicates that more than 50% of
the variance in the observed variable is explained by the construct
(Carmines and Zeller, 1979), with exception for variables L5 and S5
(see Table 3), which were eliminated from the analysis. The value
of L6 consequently decreases from 0.724 to 0.666, but this value is
close to 0.7, so the item was not removed.

Composite reliability was used to analyze the reliability of
the constructs, since this indicator has been considered a more
exact indicator than Cronbach’s alpha (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
Tables 3 and 4 show that all constructs are reliable since the com-
posite reliability values exceed the threshold of 0.7 and even the
strictest one of 0.8 (Nunnally, 1978).

The measures also demonstrate convergent validity, given that
the average variance of manifest variables extracted by the con-
structs (AVE) was at least 0.5, indicative of the fact that more
variance was explained than unexplained in the variables associ-
ated with a given construct.

Finally, to assess discriminant validity of the constructs, Barclay
et al. (1995) suggest that no item should load higher on another
construct than on the construct which intends to measure. In order
to verify this criterion we calculate the loadings and cross-loadings

of measures and the results reveals that all items passed the test
for discriminant validity. All constructs are therefore reliable, with
composite reliability values exceeding 0.7 and all the measures
demonstrating convergent validity. Discriminant validity was also
conﬁrmed, so that the structural model can be assessed. Fig. 2
presents the full structural results. Path coefﬁcients (standard-
ized betas) indicate the strength of direct relationship between
constructs. This study uses the nonparametric approach named

Bootstrap for estimating the precision of the PLS estimates and
supporting the causal order between constructs. Correspondingly,
500 sample sets were created to obtain 500 estimates for each
parameter in the PLS model (Chin, 1998; Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
Six path coefﬁcients are found to be signiﬁcant at the 0.001 level,
with signs being in the expected direction, four are signiﬁcant at
the 0.01 level, ﬁve are signiﬁcant at the level 0.05, and two are
insigniﬁcant.

Fig. 2. Structural equation results.

All values of the Q2 values (see Fig. 2) are positive, conﬁrm-
ing the model’s predictive relevance. The model also demonstrates
a high level of predictive power (R2), because the modelled con-
structs explain 60% of the variance in loyalty, 61% of the variance
in delight, 70% of the variance in satisfaction, 46% of the variance
in perceived quality, 47% of the variance in arousal, and 47% of the
variance in positive affect. The overall goodness of ﬁt, proposed by
Tenenhaus et al. (2005), reveals a good ﬁt.

When multiplying the values of the Pearson correlation and
the path coefﬁcient of each two constructs (see values below
the path coefﬁcient in Fig. 2), results reveal that 19% of variabil-
ity of loyalty is explained by satisfaction, 23.6% by reputation,
10.4% by delight, and only 6.9% by perceived quality. Conse-
quently, the direct relationship between reputation and loyalty
proves to be stronger than the relationship between delight, and
even satisfaction, and loyalty. Considering the determinants of
delight, arousal exercises the relatively strongest impact, whereas
perceived quality stands out as the strongest determinant of
satisfaction.

5. Conclusions, limitations, and further research

Rural tourism has been identiﬁed as a development tool of
rural areas, due to its potential of integrating diverse activ-
ities and resources available in these areas that are further
increasingly demanded by the tourist market. However, there
is evidence revealing relatively poor levels of performance of
the rural tourism businesses in many cases, suggesting more
professional management approaches. Particularly rural tourism
marketing action might be improved by understanding the deter-
minants of customer satisfaction, delight and loyalty in the rural

tourism context. This paper focuses on the rural accommoda-
tion context as a central element of the overall rural tourism
experience.

The results emphasize the importance of corporate reputation,
satisfaction, and delight in determining customers’ loyalty. The
lodging unit’s reputation has proven to be the most important fac-
tor determining loyalty towards the rural lodging unit. Reputation
has also an indirect effect on loyalty through satisfaction, how-
ever not through delight, that is, reputation does not stimulate the
customer to come back through pleasant surprise.

Disconﬁrmation exercises a direct effect on perceived quality,
satisfaction, arousal, and positive affect. However, the effect on pos-
itive affect is less signiﬁcant. Thus, the fulﬁlment of the tourist’s
expectations is not strong enough to create a feeling of joy, con-
tentment, and pleasure. However, rural tourists need to live an
experience that provides enthusiasm, incitement, and encourage-
ment to lead to contentment or pleasure. Apparently, however,
the rural tourist does not experience yet such contentment and
pleasure that can lead to satisfaction, so that hypothesis 4b is not
supported.

The structural equation model conﬁrms that satisfaction is
enhanced by perceptions of higher quality, which is consistent with
the quality→ satisfaction→ loyalty relationship ﬂow that concep-
tually guides this study. The direct relationship between perceived
quality and loyalty is positive, but not signiﬁcant, and so hypothesis
7b is not supported. Loureiro and González (2008) found the same
result for the rural lodging units in the South of Portugal (Alentejo).
The quality perceived by rural tourists is not enough to encourage
them to recommend the lodging, to return, or to pay more, yet,
the continuous improvement of quality in different domains, as
proposed by the RURALQUAL scale, tends to reinforce satisfaction

with the stay, the experience and activities provided, and leads to
loyalty.

Oliver et al. (1997) ﬁnd that delight is a function of its predicted
constituents (surprise consumption, arousal, disconﬁrmation, and
positive affect) and predicts loyalty. These antecedents of delight
exercise an indirect signiﬁcant effect on loyalty, especially the
arousal dimension. However, this study uses ﬁve items (about
intentions to return, to recommend, and to pay more) to compose
the loyalty construct, while Oliver et al. (1997) applied only one
item (intention to return) and Finn (2005) did not include any item
for the intention to pay more.

This paper introduces the constructs perceived quality and cor-
porate reputation and uses a different approach for data analysis
(PLS). The PLS technique is considered more appropriate for predic-
tion than techniques based on covariance, a relevant argument for
analyzing future loyalty behaviour. This study ﬁnds support for the
conceptualization of customer delight and customer satisfaction as
distinct constructs, corroborating the studies published by Oliver
et al. (1997) and Finn (2005).

Corporate reputation plays a signiﬁcant role in the customer’s
perception of service performance capability, therefore leading to
a reliable representation of the service in the customer’s mind.
An improvement in the overall image of a lodging unit held by
an individual correspondingly enhances his or her intention to
return and to recommend it in the future. Corporate reputation
should correspondingly be recognized as a key factor in the hands
of rural tourism lodging managers. Corporate reputation is a direct
antecedent of perceived quality, satisfaction, and loyalty (intention
to return and to recommend, and even to pay more). Therefore,
rural tourism managers must pay serious attention to the reputa-
tion of their lodging units. Thus, they are well advised to carefully
control the elements that contribute to this reputation, such as:
advertising, information made available at tourism ofﬁces, on web
sites, presented via public relations, advising travel agents and tour
operators. The perceived quality performance, satisfaction, and
delight derived from the experience should further contribute to
continuously enhance reputation and positively impact on loyalty
and sustainability of the tourism business, with positive word-of-
mouth being a crucial factor of image building acting through a
virtuous circle in an accumulation process of positive images and
experiences (Kastenholz, 2002).

The conclusions from this study can help managers deﬁne or
justify marketing strategies to increase customer loyalty and cre-
ate a high quality service experience. From a practical point of view,
managers of the rural lodging units should use the RURALQUAL
scale periodically to evaluate their customers’ perceived quality
and to better manage the unit, aiming at the tourist’s satisfac-
tion and delight. The ongoing concern about service improvements,
considering also aspects such as an improved integration of the
tourist within the region, the community’s way of life or the access
to cultural, recreative and/or sport activities, as well as fairs, special
festivities or other cultural events may signiﬁcantly contribute to
the tourist’s satisfaction, increasing experienced levels of joy and
pleasure and making him/her come back, recommend and even be
willing to pay more.

As mentioned before, managers should also pay attention
to their unit’s reputation and to the way they promote their
establishments and continuously communicate with their clients.
Frequently small rural accommodation establishments do not
appropriately control the marketing communication process. Sim-
ple issues, like the change of functioning periods concerning meals
or complementary activities/services offered at the accommoda-
tion establishment are not always communicated to regular clients
or on websites or in other promotional material. This may nega-
tively impact not only on the reputation of the establishment, but
also on quality perception, satisfaction concerning service expecta-

tions and even on likelihood to come back, recommend or pay more.
Corroborating Finn’s (2005) empirical evidence, this study conﬁrms
a signiﬁcant positive effect of disconﬁrmation on arousal (H6c). This
suggests that the capacity to tourists’ expectations is a strong pre-
dictor of their enthusiasm, incitement, and encouragement leading
to a joyful experience, which further supports the need for correct
marketing communication. Last, but not least, this study also points
at the need to offer the tourist a broader rural tourism experience,
exceeding the provision of accommodation, through experiences
such as tasting of wine or regional gastronomy, participation in
rural community activities and cultural events, as well as other
recreational activities creating a more complex and appealing rural
tourism product.

Also limitations of this study must be acknowledged and might
be addressed in future approaches to validate or reﬁne the model.
First, the scope of the study addressing only current tourists
should be enlarged to also include potential tourists. Additionally,
future research may explore other meaningful industry-speciﬁc
factors to analyze additional determinants of tourists’ loyalty, such
as customer involvement and service variability in this typically
cross-cultural experience setting. Future research should include
additional factors inﬂuencing and interacting with rural tourists’
loyalty, such as trust. The effect of demographics (e.g. gender, edu-
cation level) and trip characteristics (e.g., duration of stay, period
of the year, and purpose of travel) on perceived quality, satisfac-
tion, and loyalty could also be studied. In spite of a substantial
homogeneity of the sample in terms of the respondents’ proﬁle, the
inclusion of demographic and trip characteristics may add another
level of complexity to results.
