Abstract
Purpose – Drawing on the resource-based view of the ﬁrm and the dynamic capabilities perspective,
this paper sets out to argue that salespeople’s selling skills and their inter- and intra-unit collaborative
skills are valuable, rare, socially complex, and inimitable knowledge-based resources embedded in the
human and social capital of ﬁeld sales units (FSUs). Salespeople’s selling and collaborative skills, both
directly and interactively, should help ﬁeld sales units generate greater economic rents. This paper
also aims to explore the effect of salespeople’s selling and collaborative skills on the level of total
compensation through the mediating role of sales unit performance.
Design/methodology/approach – The data were obtained from a sample of managers of FSUs in
102 large Canadian organizations. The proposed model and its hypotheses were tested using
hierarchical moderated regression analysis.
Findings – Collaborative skills, but not selling skills, are directly related to FSU performance; the
effect of selling skills on FSU performance is strengthened by the complementary role of collaborative
skills; and selling skills and collaborative skills both individually and interactively result in the
payment of higher compensation to salespeople as a result of their enhanced performance.
Research limitations/implications – Salespeople’s selling skills and collaborative skills (both
directly and interactively) not only enable the FSU to generate higher levels of performance, but they
also increase individual salespeople’s compensation.
Practical implications – It is necessary for managers to acknowledge the role of knowledge-based
resources in building/developing organizational dynamic capabilities.
Originality/value – This is one of the few studies that explores the strategic role of salespeople in
creating a competitive advantage and links the sales management literature to the literature on the
RBV of the ﬁrm and social capital/human capital theory.

Introduction
Taking a behavioral, script-theoretic perspective, scholars have long explored how
salespeople with a richer and more in-depth knowledge-structure perform better than
others by:

. adapting to different sales situations (Weitz et al., 1986);

.

.

responding to customers’ needs and wants (Sujan et al., 1988);
setting attainable selling objectives and displaying more effective sales call
planning (Leigh and McGraw, 1989); and

. being able to abstract from relevant previous experience (Leong et al. 1989).

More recently, Sharma et al. (2000, p. 66) concluded that “knowledge structures need
time to develop, and salespeople might need to acquire a certain amount of sales
experience before their knowledge structures stabilize”. Based on this overview, it is
clear that previous researchers have contributed greatly to our understanding of the
intricacies of the linkage between salespeople’s knowledge base and their performance
level.

Salespeople’s professional experience, knowledge, and skills form a part of the
knowledge-based resources of the ﬁeld sales unit (FSU). Such resources, in turn,
constitute the FSU’s human and social capital (e.g. Barney and Wright, 1998; Hitt et al.,
2001; Hitt and Ireland, 2002; Madhavan and Grover, 1998; Wright et al., 2001). Both the
resource-based view (RBV) of the ﬁrm and the dynamic capabilities perspective
suggest that through possessing superior human capital and social capital resources,
FSUs should be able to enhance their dynamic capabilities and thus generate superior
value, especially in volatile market conditions (Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt and Martin,
2000; Hitt and Ireland, 2002; Teece et al., 1997; Wright et al., 1998). For example, two of
the key dynamic capabilities that have been identiﬁed in the literature are
market/customer orientation (e.g. Day, 1994; Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Hunt and
Morgan, 1995; Narver and Slater, 1990) and inter-organizational marketing
partnerships (e.g. Smith and Barclay, 1997). There is also an emerging body of
literature which suggests that the stock of human capital and social capital resources
might be a key to understanding the implementation of compensation schemes within
the FSU (Byler and Coff, 2003).

Despite an increasing number of ﬁeld studies that draw attention to the strategic
importance of the sales force (e.g. Weitz, 1981; Leigh and Marshall, 2001), there is an
extremely limited number of empirical ﬁndings with which to demonstrate the truth of
such claims (e.g. Capron and Hulland, 1999). To the best of our knowledge, this is one
area of research that has been largely neglected in the sales management literature.

To ﬁll the gap in the literature, we propose and test a model that posits the strategic
importance of salespeople’s knowledge and skills in the FSU’s value-creation and
rent-generation processes. First, we suggest that salespeople with a high level of selling
skills (hereafter selling skills) constitute a discrete knowledge-based resource that is
instrumental in the FSU being able to enhance its dynamic capabilities and therefore
create and maintain a competitive advantage (cf. Miller and Shamsie, 1996).

Second, we suggest that salespeople’s intra- and inter-unit collaborative skills
(hereafter refrred to as “collaborative skills”) constitute a systemic knowledge-based
resource that also help to increase the level of FSU performance. Especially in the case
where such skills are bundled together with selling skills, the FSU’s performance
should be stronger (cf. Carpenter et al., 2001; Hitt et al., 2001; Teece et al., 1997). We
draw partly on the complementary resources approach to the RBV and social capital
theory to enrich the theoretical rationale for our argument.

Carpenter et al. (2001, p. 493) suggest that “when a ﬁrm’s ability to generate rents
depends on intangible resources embedded in human capital, those who control such
resources may be able to appropriate a share of the rents as well”. However, there is a
need for empirical studies to present evidence that the arguments deriving from studies
in non-sales settings are also valid in the sales context. Therefore, drawing on a
wide-range of theories (i.e. the RBV, social capital theory, human capital theory, and
the economic view of compensation), we argue that salespeople with high levels of both

Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 11:38 01 February 2017 (PT)
selling skills and collaborative skills will be paid higher levels of compensation to
reﬂect the greater extent to which they help create value and generate rents for the
FSU.

In the following sections, we ﬁrst introduce our study’s theoretical framework and
its hypotheses. Next, we test the hypotheses using a sample of 102 Canadian ﬁrms
where the unit of analysis is the FSU, as we will discuss later. Finally, we present the
results of the hypotheses tests, followed by a discussion of the managerial implications,
limitations, and future research directions.

Theoretical framework
The RBV of the ﬁrm proposes that a ﬁrm’s valuable, rare, socially complex, and
inimitable resources and capabilities generate a greater competitive advantage (Amit
and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991; Bharadwaj et al., 1993; Dierickx and Cool, 1989;
Wernerfelt, 1984). However, the RBV falls short of being able to explain why some
ﬁrms, despite the relatively superior resources they possess, are not able to sustain
their competitive advantage over time, especially in dynamic markets (Eisenhardt and
Martin, 2000). In turn, the dynamic capabilities perspective proposes that some ﬁrms
are better able to transform their resources and capabilities into dynamic capabilities,
especially in turbulent markets (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997).
Consequently, our theoretical framework draws on both the RBV and the dynamic
capabilities perspective as they are complementary and, when linked together, they
provide a more adequate explanation (Carpenter et al., 2001).

Broadly, ﬁrms possess two types of resources: tangible and intangible (e.g. Hall,
1992, 1993; Hitt et al., 2001; Madhavan and Grover, 1998). Tangible resources (i.e.
product/process inputs, facilities, locations, patents, and technological equipment) are
protected from imitation by property rights (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). Intangible
resources, which might be either discrete or systemic knowledge-based resources, are
protected from imitation by knowledge barriers that exist between competitors (Miller
and Shamsie, 1996). Further, intangible resources allow ﬁrms to add value to their
tangible resources (Hall, 1992, 1993; Hitt et al., 2001; Miller and Shamsie, 1996). In this
study, our focus is on knowledge-based resources in the context of the FSU, as depicted
in Figure 1.

Knowledge-based resources are embedded in the social fabric of FSUs and they are
related to salespeople’s knowledge and skills in both discrete and systemic ways (e.g.
Barney and Wright, 1998; Hitt et al., 2001; Hitt and Ireland, 2002; Madhavan and
Grover, 1998; Miller and Shamsie, 1996). As Miller and Shamsie (1996, pp. 526-7) note,
“[D]iscrete knowledge-based resources may take the form of speciﬁc technical,
functional, and creative skills” while “[S]ystemic knowledge-based resources might
take the form of integrative or coordinative skills required for multidisciplinary
teamwork”. More importantly, both discrete and systemic knowledge-based resources
are tacit in nature. Tacit resources are protected by time dependence as they cannot be
codiﬁed, written, or easily transferred from one FSU to another (e.g. Berman et al., 2002;
Grant, 1996a; Hitt et al., 2001; Madhavan and Grover, 1998; Teece et al., 1997). In
addition, tacit knowledge-based resources are strategically more valuable to FSUs than
explicit knowledge-based resources such as education levels (Hitt et al., 2001; Hitt and
Ireland, 2002).

Since the concepts and constructs described by the RBV are mostly unobservable, the
measurement of such concepts and constructs has long been a challenge for
researchers (Godfrey and Hill, 1995; Rouse and Daellenbach, 2002). In fact, the
explanatory power of the RBV of the ﬁrm lies in that it identiﬁes the fact that when a
resource is easily observable, it becomes imitable by others and therefore loses its
value as a source of sustainable competitive advantage (Godfrey and Hill, 1995). Hence,
the question it raises for researchers is how to conceptualize, observe, and measure
unobservable effects of tacit knowledge-based resources. According to Godfrey and
Hill (1995, p. 530), “[O]ne way out of this trap is for scholars to focus on observable
variables that determine the degree of unobservability of a rare and valuable resource”.
They suggest that the best method is to identify the likely, observable consequences
(such as the level of performance) of unobservable resources and to measure them
using proxies.

Based on Godfrey and Hill’s (1995) suggestion and the accumulated body of
research in the literature, we consider “selling skills” to be a discrete knowledge-based
resource and “collaborative skills” to be a systemic knowledge-based resource, both of
which are available to FSUs (cf. Miller and Shamsie, 1996). More explicitly, we posit
that selling skills and collaborative skills reﬂect salespeople’s cumulative experience,
and therefore they are a reasonable proxy for the stock of tacit knowledge which exists
at the FSU level (cf. Berman et al., 2002). Next, we explain these two types of resources
in more detail.

Selling skills
Selling skills are a valuable resource for FSUs, as salespeople with a high level of
selling skills are likely to demonstrate such behaviors as:

.

listening to their customers attentively to better identify and understand their
concerns and problems;

performance

889

. more effectively working out solutions to customers’ questions and objectives;

and

. using their social networks to develop a greater range of new customers

(Behrman and Perreault, 1982).

By deﬁnition, selling skills comprise both declarative and procedural knowledge. Leigh
and McGraw (1989, p. 17) deﬁne declarative knowledge as “the set of situational cues
that enable a salesperson to recognize or classify a particular selling situation as an
instance of a more general selling category”. For example, attentively listening to their
customers to better identify and understand their concerns and problems is one
example of a salesperson using their declarative knowledge (Sharma et al., 2000).
Procedural knowledge can be deﬁned as “a set of learned behavioral routines that ﬁt
various selling situations” (Leigh and McGraw, 1989, p. 17). For example, working out
solutions to customers’ questions and objectives is an example of the use of procedural
knowledge.

Scholars have argued that such behaviors are valuable in the development and
maintenance of marketing relationships between partnering organizations (e.g. Smith
and Barclay, 1997) and in the effectiveness of sales organizations (e.g. Cravens et al.,
1993). In addition, the RBV and the dynamic capabilities perspective point to three
factors that make selling skills difﬁcult to imitate or transfer between FSUs, namely
causal ambiguity, social complexity, and direct/indirect costs (e.g. Barney, 1991;
Capron and Hulland, 1999; Carpenter et al., 2001; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990; Hunt and
Morgan, 1995; Madhavan and Grover, 1998). It is necessary, however, to show
empirically how this resource creates value (and generates rent) for FSUs.

Inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills
Collaborative skills encompass such sales force behaviors as:

. generating sales volume from team sales;
. building strong working relationships with other employees in the ﬁrms;
. working closely with non-sales employees to achieve desired outcomes;

.

coordinating closely with other employees to handle after-sales services and
problems; and

. discussing selling strategies with people from various units in the ﬁrm (Behrman

and Perreault, 1982).

As Miller and Shamsie (1996, p. 527) note, “[T]he systemic nature of team and
coordinative skills makes them especially ﬁrm-speciﬁc – more valuable to a ﬁrm than
to its competitors”. Collaborative skills are difﬁcult for competitors to copy due to both
path dependencies and co-specialization (Peteraf, 1993; Teece et al., 1997). In addition,
collaborative relationships are unprogrammable, non-routine, and voluntary in nature
(Miller and Shamsie, 1996). For example, when there is a strong organizational culture
that fosters and rewards inter-functional collaborative relationships, it is likely that
salespeople will engage in collaborative relationships with their co-workers/colleagues
(Bollinger and Smith, 2001). In turn, collaborative relationships are likely to form an
organizational routine, rather than a series of explicit rules and directions (Grant,
1996b). Through organizational routines, “individuals develop sequential patterns of
interaction which permit the integration of their specialized knowledge without the

need for communicating that knowledge” (Grant, 1996b, p. 379). The process of

organization-wide investments in human capital
(Grant, 1996b) such as effective
training, selective stafﬁng, and developmental performance appraisal. An individual’s
ability to integrate their tacit knowledge with other individuals in the ﬁrm might be
inhibited by cognitive (or motivational) barriers (Szulanski, 1996). Due to the varying
levels of barriers among ﬁrms, the existence of a high level of collaborative skills is a
valuable and inimitable resource for the FSU (Szulanski, 1996).

It

Finally, the RBV suggests that the existence and/or deployment of complementary
knowledge-based resources that are not easy to imitate will contribute to the FSU
gaining a sustainable competitive advantage (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Eisenhardt
and Martin, 2000; Hitt et al., 2001; Miller and Shamsie, 1996; Teece, 1986; Teece et al.,
1997). We argue that the complementary resources approach (Teece, 1986) might
further help explain why:

.

.

the FSU needs salespeople high in inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills; and
salespeople’s selling skills will have little (or no) value without their collaborative
skills.

Consequently, as we will detail
later, salespeople’s collaborative skills should
strengthen the performance impact of their selling skills through a variety of
mechanisms.

Hypotheses
Figure 2 depicts the relationships to be tested in this study. It is noteworthy that,
consistent with previous studies, we view FSU performance (i.e. as a reﬂection of
value-creation and rent-generation) as an aggregate measure of sales volume,
proﬁtability, and customer satisfaction, relative to unit objectives and major
competitors (e.g. Cravens et al., 1993).

The direct and complementary effects on FSU performance
The direct effect of selling skills. Selling skills, like other forms of tacit knowledge, tend
to improve over time as salespeople gain experience (i.e. learning-by-doing) (Hitt et al.,
2001; Pisano, 1994). In turn, the improvement in selling skills will enhance the FSU’s
dynamic capabilities (Hitt et al., 2001; Wright et al., 1998). The ﬁrm-speciﬁc and tacit
nature of selling skills should produce the highest quality service to existing customers
(Hitt et al., 2001) and engender the customer’s trust, loyalty, and intention to continue
the relationship with the organization (e.g. Smith and Barclay, 1997). Further, when
sales are volatile and/or the customer’s purchase decisions are complex, salespeople
high in selling skills should be better able to cope as they have greater skills in effective
planning, troubleshooting, and problem-solving (Florin et al., 2003).

Salespeople who have high levels of selling skills are more likely to generate new
customers, and their ability to build strong relationships with current and potential
customers adds to the external social capital pool of FSUs (Hitt et al., 2001). In turn, as
Yli-Renko et al. (2001, p. 587) note, “social capital facilitates external knowledge
acquisition in key customer relationships and that [. . .] knowledge mediates the social
capital and knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage”. Previous studies have
shown that a high level of selling skills is one of the key factors that directly inﬂuences
salespeople’s outcome performance and thereby contributes to the FSU’s effectiveness
(e.g. Cravens et al., 1993). In summary, a high level of selling skills should enhance the
FSU’s ability to attain, sustain, and even enhance its competitive advantage (cf. Florin
et al., 2003). Thus, as depicted in Figure 2, we hypothesize that:

H1. Salespeople’s selling skills, as a discrete knowledge-based resource, will be

related positively to FSU performance.

The direct effect of collaborative skills. Salespeople’s inter- and intra-unit collaborative
skills allow them access to the social resources and information that are embedded
within their social networks. These skills are likely to contribute to the social capital
pool of the FSU and, in turn, its performance (e.g. Black and Boal, 1994; Florin et al.,
2003; Hitt and Ireland, 2002; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998).
Social capital theorists have argued that strong structural ties in a social system – a
structural dimension of social capital – lead to the development of both cognitive and
relational social capital (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). Consequently, the level of cognitive
and relational capital is enhanced (or diminished) by the level of structural ties among
the actors in that social system (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998).
Strong collaborative ties enable actors to freely share invaluable information, create a
common point of view, build up channels for information and resource ﬂows, access
other actors’ resources, and create and disseminate information across the boundaries
of the organization. In turn, social capital theorists have long acknowledged that these
functions enhance organizational performance (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai and
Ghoshal, 1998). Therefore, we posit that:

H2. Salespeople’s inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills, as a systemic

knowledge-based resource, will be related positively to FSU performance.

The complementary role of collaborative skills. We propose two theoretical rationales to
substantiate why selling skills, when strengthened/complemented by collaborative
skills, should contribute more strongly to FSU performance. Firstly, the RBV suggests

892

through interpersonal collaboration,

that discrete knowledge-based resources (i.e. selling skills) and systemic
knowledge-based resources (i.e. collaborative skills) interact positively and result in
better outcomes for the FSU (cf. Coleman, 1988; Hitt et al., 2001; Miller and Shamsie,
1996). For example,
tacit
knowledge of salespeople is further developed and/or disseminated throughout the
ﬁrm, which in turn contributes to organizational learning (Barney and Wright, 1998;
Bollinger and Smith, 2001). The contribution of collaborations to the development and
dissemination salespeople’s tacit knowledge becomes even more crucial when the FSU
is faced with high salesforce turnover (cf. Grant, 1996a). Marketing researchers have
long examined the performance impact of organizational learning capability and found
supporting ﬁndings (e.g. Hult and Ketchen, 2001).

the ﬁrm-speciﬁc,

Secondly, as collaborative working relationships within the ﬁrm are entrenched
mostly with discrete, knowledge-based resources, collaborative skills should enable the
transfer of tacit knowledge between individuals (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). Therefore,
when social capital is effectively designed and used, collaborative relationships are
likely to strengthen selling skills and provide more effective collaboration (cf. Hitt and
Ireland, 2002; Hitt et al., 2002). In this vein, Wright et al. (2001) note that human capital
resources and social capital resources both contribute to the organization’s intellectual
capital. Among many beneﬁts, bundling and effectively using human capital and
social capital resources should enable a company to provide particular beneﬁts to
customers (e.g. Florin et al., 2003; Hitt and Ireland, 2002). Consequently, bundling
selling skills with collaborative skills might help the FSU to generate a
customer-oriented capability, which is itself a valuable, socially complex, and
causally ambiguous resource (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990; Day, 1994; Hunt and Morgan,
1995). To summarize these theoretical arguments and apply them to the FSU setting,
we hypothesize that:

H3. As the level of salespeople’s inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills increases,
the relationship between salespeople’s selling skills and FSU performance will
be stronger.

The mediating role of FSU performance
Drawing on the economic view of compensation, researchers have long explored the
role of performance on the level of compensation paid to employees at almost every
level of
the organization (i.e. ﬂoor employees, middle management, and top
management)
(e.g. Fisher and Govindarajan, 1992; Gerhart and Milkovich, 1990;
Gomez-Mejia and Wiseman, 1997). The rationale behind this relationship is that FSUs
with a higher level of performance (especially over time) will possess more ﬁnancial
resources and be more willing and able to compensate those salespeople who make the
greatest contribution to FSU performance (e.g. Fisher and Govindarajan, 1992; Gerhart
and Milkovich, 1990; Gomez-Mejia and Wiseman, 1997).

theory suggest

Recent studies that draw more directly on the RBV, human capital theory and/or
social capital
that when intangible resources embedded in an
organization’s human capital become increasingly strategically valuable, the holders of
such resources are likely to contribute signiﬁcantly to organizational performance, and
as such they are likely to be paid a higher level of compensation (e.g. Byler and Coff,
2003; Carpenter et al., 2001). Byler and Coff (2003) have recently termed this

893

transformation from a high level of organizational performance to a high level of total
compensation as the resource-holders’ bargaining power in the allocation of rents.

As stated earlier, the FSU’s human capital pool (i.e. salespeople’s selling skills and
collaborative skills) is likely to contribute to the FSU’s effectiveness (e.g. Wright et al.,
2001). As Grant (1996a, p. 111) notes, “[tacit knowledge] can be appropriated only
through its application to productive activity”. When the FSU’s productivity results
from its salespeople’s knowledge and skills, the salespeople’s power to appropriate
economic rents is likely to increase (Byler and Coff, 2003; Carpenter et al., 2001).
Perhaps more importantly, sales organizations are increasingly facing high levels of
turnover, and thus high levels of replacement costs (Byler and Coff, 2003). It is realistic
to expect that salespeople who learn the most and who are highly effective in using and
applying their skills and abilities for the beneﬁt of the FSU are likely to be rewarded at
a higher level (Byler and Coff, 2003; Grant, 1996a). This argument is also in line with
the economic perspective of compensation and suggests a mediating role for FSU
performance. To summarize, we suggest that:

H4. FSU performance will mediate the direct and interactive relationships of
selling skills and collaborative skills on total compensation paid to
salespeople.

Other effects
In addition to the main and interactive effects of selling skills and collaborative skills,
both the level of FSU performance and total compensation paid to salespeople are
likely to be inﬂuenced by other FSU-related demographics and environmental factors.
Hence, to avoid model misspeciﬁcation and biased ﬁndings, we include a number of
control variables in our model. Speciﬁcally, we consider FSU size (the number of
salespeople and the number of customers) and sales type (i.e.
industrial
products/services versus customer products/services) under the broad umbrella of
FSU demographics. All else being equal, it is logical to expect that a FSU with a larger
number of salespeople and a larger portfolio of customers will outperform one with a
relatively smaller number in an industry. However, we do not have enough theoretical
evidence as to why sales type should or should not be related to FSU performance and
the average amount of compensation to be paid to salespeople. Hence, we attribute this
to the exploratory nature of our study.

Porter (1991) argues that the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage is a function of the
interaction between its operating environment and the availability of resources. In a
model such as ours, the RBV theoretic explanation should take into account the nature
of the ﬁrm’s operating environment to present a more complete picture. The two
variables that we employ to represent the operating environment are the industry
growth rate and sales volatility. It is noteworthy that the inclusion of industry growth
rate and sales volatility in the same study is not unusual. Industry growth rate has
been widely used by strategy researchers as a proxy measure for environmental
muniﬁcence: when the industry growth rate is high, the environment is perceived as
being more stable and less volatile. Strategy researchers have long explored the effect
of environmental muniﬁcence on ﬁrm performance and their ﬁndings are supportive of
the claim that a high level of environmental muniﬁcence is positively and signiﬁcantly
related to performance (e.g. Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003). The relationship between

total compensation has also been
environmental muniﬁcence and the level of
researched (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998). Given such strong support
for the
relationship between environmental muniﬁcence and both performance and the level of
compensation, we expect similar ﬁndings in our study.

Sales volatility hinders both forecasting and sales planning activities, and leads to a
greater variability in an organization’s ﬁnancial performance. It creates a level of
business risk that is of concern to both the organization and salespeople. Because
organizational returns are not stable when sales levels are volatile, ﬂuctuations in the
level of salespeople’s compensation (especially the contribution of variable pay) are
inevitable (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998).

Research method
Unit of analysis
As Rouse and Daellenbach (2002, p. 966) point out, “the RBV is an inside-out
perspective on organizations that seeks to identify the characteristics of ﬁrms with
superior performance [. . .] It is high-performing organizations that should be the focus
of such research and, as a result, performance should feature as a selection variable”.
Based on this observation, we identify “performance” as an FSU-level variable. More
explicitly, we study the question of why some FSUs are more successful than others,
within a given sample of FSUs, by considering the impact of knowledge-based
resources.

Rouse and Daellenbach (2002) also provide researchers with a route map. Given that
the RBV locates superior performance as the ultimate goal of the value-generation
process, studies should look at the process backwards (i.e. performance ! positional
advantage ! resources). Hence, we should look inside the organization to ﬁnd the
source of its performance level. One way of achieving this is to study the sources of
performance at the group-level
(Rouse and Daellenbach, 2002). In fact, our core
argument is that the positional advantage that results in superior FSU performance is
sustained and maintained over time through the knowledge-based resources available
to FSUs. More explicitly, we study the role of the knowledge-based resources in the
value-generation process of FSUs (cf. Wright et al., 2001), not the effect of the
performance of
individual salespeople based on their knowledge and skills.
Consequently, based on theory and evidence, we suggest that the FSU is an
appropriate unit of analysis in this study.

Sample and data collection
The data used in this study were obtained from a large project that sought to explore a
variety of sales management activities and issues in the larger Canadian organizations
that were expected to have a ﬁeld sales force. Since our unit of analysis was the FSU,
our target respondents were the ﬁeld sales managers (FSMs). However, we could not
reach individual FSMs directly to communicate with them. Instead, we began with a
mailing list of the chief sales executives (CSEs) of the 1,000 largest Canadian
organizations. We contacted these CSEs and invited them to participate in our survey if
they had a ﬁeld sales force with at least two FSMs. Since many of the larger Canadian
ﬁrms did not have a marketing department or a sales force due to the nature of their
businesses (e.g. mining and natural resources), and some did not meet the requirement
of having two FSMs, we received only 250 acceptances to participate in our survey.

performance

After receiving the acceptances, we sent a survey package to the CSEs. Each survey
package contained a letter of invitation that detailed the purpose of our project along
with two FSM surveys. We asked CSEs to distribute the survey questionnaires to
FSMs. To avoid possible conceptual misunderstanding, we also provided CSEs with a
clear deﬁnition of the term “ﬁeld sales unit” and the term “ﬁeld sales manager”. A total
of 23 CSEs indicated that their organization did not meet our criteria after receiving the
survey package. Consequently, 227 sales organizations is the upper limit of initial
mailing, as we did not know how many additional sales organizations would fall into
the ineligible category (i.e. 23 ﬁrms). Some FSMs did not complete the survey in spite of
the fact that their CSEs had previously accepted the invitation to participate.

Due to conﬁdentiality and anonymity of responses, FSMs were asked to mail the
completed surveys directly to one of the authors. We received 102 usable FSM surveys
from 47 organizations. In turn, the lower limit of the response rate is approximately
20.7 percent (= 47/227).

To assess whether our sample displayed a reliable representation of the largest
1,000 organizations, we compared the organizational characteristics of the top 50
percent of the respondents with the lower 50 percent, based on the date of arrival. The
t-test results revealed no signiﬁcant differences between the two groups, supporting
our assumption that
the respondents accurately represented the largest 1,000
organizations. We also observed that as ﬁrm size declined rapidly toward the bottom of
the list, it is not likely that any signiﬁcant organizations are omitted by limiting the
sampling frame to the largest 1,000 Canadian organizations.

Most FSUs were operating in the ﬁeld of customer services (61 percent), followed by
customer products (20 percent), industrial products (11 percent), and industrial services
(8 percent). The average customer base was 1,296.8. Eighty-eight percent of FSMs were
hierarchically two levels below the CSEs and had an average tenure of 4.3 years. On
average, the FSMs supervised 17 salespeople.

Measures
The multi-item measures used in this study are listed in Table I. Speciﬁcally, “selling
skills” (ﬁve items) and “collaborative skills” (ﬁve items) were measured with ten-point
Likert scales (1 ¼ needs improvement, 10 ¼ outstanding) taken from Behrman and
Perreault (1982). Consistent with previous research (e.g. Cravens et al., 1993), “FSU
performance” was measured by means of sales volume (two items), proﬁtability (two
items), and the level of customer satisfaction (two items), using ﬁve-point Likert scales
(1 ¼ much worse, 5 ¼ much better), taken from Cravens et al.
(1993). For each
measure, we asked FSMs to assess how well their sales unit performed during the past
24 months relative to the sales unit objectives and to their major competitors. We
aggregated the FSMs’ responses on the three dimensions of performance to obtain an
overarching construct of FSU performance. It is noteworthy that we do not include
market share in our measure of FSU performance, mainly because, unlike other
dimensions of performance (i.e. sales volume, customer satisfaction, and proﬁtability),
market share is normally measured at the organizational level. Total compensation
paid to salespeople was reported by the FSMs. This variable measures the average
amount of compensation (base salary þ incentives) paid to the sales force (not to
individual salespeople) by the FSU.

Analysis and results
Measurement validation
We employed exploratory factor analysis to purify the measurement items for each
construct, based on poor factor loadings and/or cross-loadings. The results of the
principal component analysis revealed four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0,

which explained 88 percent of the total variance. The ﬁrst factor explained only 19
percent of the total variance. There was no general factor in the unrotated factor
structure. These ﬁndings are in line with Harman’s one-factor procedure, and support
our contention that common-method bias is not a likely threat in this study (Podsakoff
and Organ, 1986).

We next estimated the measurement model using conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA) in LISREL 8.3 (Jo¨reskog and So¨rbom, 1996). We initially considered employing
the maximum likelihood technique to estimate the measurement model. However, this
technique requires normally distributed constructs. Because the constructs of
collaborative skills and of FSU performance are not normally distributed (i.e. skewness
and kurtosis), we were not able to use this technique. Instead, we utilized the technique
of ERLS (iteratively reweighed generalized least squares). Singh (1993, p. 20) notes that
“the ERLS procedure is advantageous because the estimates obtained are less biased
than ML (maximum likelihood) estimates in the case of non-normal data”. The
measurement model showed a good ﬁt

The CFA results indicated that factor loadings of the scale items were statistically
signiﬁcant (t . 2:0; Gerbing and Anderson, 1988). In addition, the composite reliability
estimates of all the multi-item constructs were higher than 0.70 (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988).
Consequently, the convergent validity of the constructs was supported. We also
assessed the discriminant validity of all the constructs, employing two techniques.
First we checked conﬁdence intervals of the correlations for the constructs and found
that they were well below 1.0 (p , 0:05) (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). Next, for every
pair of constructs, we compared an unconstrained model with a constrained model in
which the correlation between two constructs was set to 1. We then computed the x2
difference between the two models. In each case, the x2 difference test was statistically
signiﬁcant (Dx2 . 3:84). Consequently, the discriminant validity of the constructs was
supported.

Table I shows the factor loadings, t-values, and reliability estimates of the
constructs used in this study. Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations are presented

Hypotheses tests
The model hypotheses were tested using a moderated mediation approach to
regression analysis. It is noteworthy that we treated the variables entered in equations
in two ways. We log-transformed the self-report measures of FSU size (number of
employees and approximate size of FSU customer base) and the amount of
compensation paid in order to avoid non-normal distribution. We z-transformed all the
multi-item constructs to avoid the non-normal distribution and to minimize the threat
of multi-collinearity in equations. This was especially necessary for those variables
that we included as interaction terms (selling skills and collaborative skills) to be able
to test the moderating role of collaborative skills on the relationship between selling
skills and performance and the level of total compensation (Aiken and West, 1991). We
checked for collinearity among variables by calculating the variance inﬂation factor
(VIF). For each of the regression coefﬁcients, VIFs (1.09-1.69) were well below the
threshold of 10 (Neter et al., 1985).

the mediating variable (i.e. FSU performance)

We followed the four-step procedure recommended by Langfred (2004) based on
James and Brett (1984) and Baron and Kenny (1986) to test our hypotheses. In step 1
(model 1),
is regressed on the
independent variables (i.e. selling skills and collaborative skills) and their interaction
term. This step allowed us to test H1-H3, which we will elaborate on later. In step 2
is regressed on the
(model 2), the dependent variable (i.e. total compensation)
independent variables and their interaction term.
total
compensation is regressed on FSU performance, controlling for the independent
variables (in addition to all control variables), but not controlling for the interaction
term (i.e. entering only the direct effect of selling skills and of collaborative skills). The
presence of mediation is indicated if the effect of FSU performance is signiﬁcant. Step 4
(model 4) is necessary to examine to what extent the effect of FSU performance effect
on total compensation reduces or eliminates the original effect of the interaction term
on total compensation. The interest here is not in testing for the signiﬁcance of FSU
performance on total compensation. Rather, FSU performance is included in the
equation, to examine the change in signiﬁcance of the interaction term, if any, between
step 1 and step 4. From step 4, we can determine whether or not the mediation is partial
or full (Langfred, 2004).

In step 3 (model 3),

Table III (model 1) shows the results of the analyses for H1-H3. H1 posited that
salespeople’s selling skills as a discrete knowledge-based resource will be related
positively to FSU performance. We found that selling skills were not signiﬁcantly
related to FSU performance (t ¼ 0:71, NS). Consequently, H1 was not supported.

H2 posited that salespeople’s inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills, as a systemic
knowledge-based resource, will be related positively to FSU performance. We found
that collaborative skills were positively and signiﬁcantly related to FSU performance
(t ¼ 2:41, p , 0:05). Hence, H2 was supported.

H3 posited that as the level of salespeople’s inter- and intra-unit collaborative skills
increases, the relationship between salespeople’s selling skills and FSU performance
will be stronger. The interaction term was positively and signiﬁcantly related to FSU
performance (t ¼ 2:22, p , 0:05), supporting H3. To further explore the nature of the
interaction effect, we employed a simple slope analysis and plotted the graph at high
(one standard deviation above the mean) and low (one standard deviation below the
mean) levels of collaborative skills, as suggested by Aiken and West (1991). Simple

slope analysis revealed that, at low level of collaborative skills, selling skills were not
related signiﬁcantly to FSU performance (t ¼ 21:08, NS). However, at high level of
collaborative skills, selling skills were positively and signiﬁcantly related to FSU
performance (t ¼ 2:01, p , 0:05). Figure 3 shows the signiﬁcant interaction between
selling skills and collaborative skills on FSU performance.

Our ﬁnal hypothesis (H4) posited that FSU performance will mediate the
relationship between the independent variables and their interaction term and total
amount of compensation paid to salespeople. To test this hypothesis, we followed steps
2-4 as explained above. Step 2 (model 2) revealed that the direct effect of selling skills
(t ¼ 2:72; p , 0:01) and the interaction term of selling skills and collaborative skills
(t ¼ 2:30; p , 0:05) were positively and signiﬁcantly related to total compensation.
Step 3 (model 3) revealed that the direct effect of FSU performance on total
compensation was positive and statistically signiﬁcant (t ¼ 6:29; p , 0:001). This
ﬁnding signaled the mediating role of FSU performance. Finally, step 4 (model 4) also
revealed that the original effect of the interaction term on total compensation became
insigniﬁcant when total compensation was regressed on FSU performance. FSU
performance was a full mediator of the relationship between collaborative skills and
the interaction of selling skills and collaborative skills. In addition, FSU performance
was a partial mediator between the selling skills and total compensation relationship.
Consequently, H4 was supported.

In terms of controls, customer base (model 1) was positively and signiﬁcantly
related to FSU performance while FSU size (based on model 4) was negatively and
signiﬁcantly related to total compensation.

Conclusions
Discussion of ﬁndings
Drawing on the RBV of the ﬁrm, dynamic capabilities perspective, social capital
theory, and the economic view of compensation, we proposed a model that posited that:

.

selling skills and collaborative skills are directly related to FSU performance;
the effect of selling skills on FSU performance is strengthened by the
complementary role of collaborative skills; and
selling skills and collaborative skills both individually and interactively result in
the payment of higher compensation to salespeople through enhanced FSU
performance.

Our ﬁndings largely support the hypothesized relationships above. Next, we discuss
our ﬁndings and their implications in more detail.

First, despite our expectations, we were not able to ﬁnd supporting evidence of the link
between selling skills and FSU performance. We acknowledge that selling skills are a
strategically valuable knowledge-based resource available to FSUs, which enables them
to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. Nevertheless, this inconsistent
ﬁnding (based on our sample) does not necessarily mean that selling skills are not
valuable. Rather, as the RBV posits, some resources might not by themselves always
demonstrate a signiﬁcant increase in the level of performance in spite of the fact that they
are vital to the operations of an organization. Because selling skills are a socially complex
and causally ambiguous resource (i.e. path-dependent), they might have little or no
demonstrable effect on performance unless they are bundled with other resources.

Second, we found strong support for the hypothesis that collaborative skills, as a
systemic knowledge-based resource, result in a higher level of FSU performance. In
particular, this ﬁnding is consistent with the arguments in social capital theory (e.g.
Black and Boal, 1994; Florin et al., 2003; Hitt and Ireland, 2002; Nahapiet and Ghoshal,
1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). It is likely that we have captured the instrumental role of
collaborative skills on the “social capital ! knowledge combination=exchange ! value
creation” chain as suggested by other researchers (e.g. Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai
and Ghoshal, 1998). Furthermore, salespeople’s network-building skills help to generate
structural and relational ties with their co-workers. Through these structural and
relational ties, salespeople perform their tasks more efﬁciently, acquiring essential
information and resources from their colleagues. As a result, the accumulated social
capital within the organization is likely to elicit more effective knowledge processing (i.e.
acquisition and dissemination) and, in turn, a higher level of performance.

Third, and perhaps more importantly, due to their complementary role,
collaborative skills enhance the strategic value of selling skills, leading to higher
levels of FSU performance. More explicitly, this ﬁnding supports the proposition of the
RBV that discrete knowledge-based resources (i.e. selling skills) and systemic
knowledge-based resources (i.e. collaborative skills) are complementary in nature (e.g.
Miller and Shamsie, 1996). One possible explanation for the strong support found in
our sample is that salespeople with high levels of collaborative skills are more likely to
improve their selling skills by combining and exchanging their knowledge with their
co-workers. Subsequently, the interaction between selling skills and collaborative
skills is likely to contribute to strong intellectual capital and, thus, a higher level of
performance (e.g. Wright et al., 2001).

Fourth, we found that the higher the level of performance, the greater the total
amount of compensation paid to salespeople. More interestingly, our data indicated
that FSU performance mediates the relationship between knowledge-based resources
and total compensation. This ﬁnding is consistent with the economic view of
compensation along with the RBV of the ﬁrm and social capital theory. Despite a long
tradition of
explored the
performance-compensation relationship from an economic perspective have been
based on samples involving senior executives/top managers. While previous ﬁndings
have remained equivocal (Gomez-Mejia and Wiseman, 1997), there is extremely limited
evidence to show whether the economic view of compensation is supported in groups
other than top management. For example, knowledge workers, such as salespeople, are

becoming increasingly more vital to the strategic operations of organizations. This is
one of the few empirical studies that provides evidence to support the economic view of
compensation for other groups. Our ﬁndings on the mediating role of FSU performance
also lend support to the perspective that the economic view of compensation should be
augmented by other theories such as social capital/human capital theory.

We found that FSU performance partially mediates the relationship between selling
skills and the amount of total compensation. It is likely that selling skills are more
observable by managers who participate in the performance appraisal of salespeople.
Most behaviors that resemble good selling skills might be considered under the broad
umbrella of salespeople’s in-role performance. Consequently, it is logical to expect that
those salespeople with a high level of selling skills will perform better and receive higher
levels of compensation than other salespeople. In addition, FSU performance mediates
partially the effect of selling skills on the amount of compensation. It is likely that an
enhanced level of FSU performance might be attributed to salespeople performing their
in-role activities more sufﬁciently (Cravens et al., 1993). Although we do not have enough
evidence based on our data to make a convincing case, it is likely that some salespeople
in our sample might have been hired because of their selling skills. Hence, our result
might be due to the fact that FSUs pay more to salespeople with higher selling skills.
FSU performance is enhanced directly by collaborative skills and interactively by
the stronger impact of selling skills. However, collaborative skills have no direct effect
on the total amount of compensation when FSU performance is controlled. As
mentioned previously, collaborative skills are voluntary, unprogrammable, and
discretionary in nature (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). In this regard, strong collaborative
relationships among employees are a reﬂection of good citizenship behaviors. Most
often, salespeople’s discretionary behaviors are not part of their formal contract and are
less likely to inﬂuence the amount of compensation paid to them. In order for managers
to be able to consider collaborative skills when conducting performance appraisals,
collaborative skills must be required formally by the organization. We do not have the
data to indicate whether collaborative skills are formally required as part of
salespeople’s formal contracts. However, a fully mediating role of FSU performance in
the collaborative skills and total compensation linkage indicates that the contribution of
collaborative skills to FSU performance must be taken into consideration.

Finally, we found a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between the FSU’s
customer base and their performance. This means that FSUs with a larger customer
base outperformed their counterparts (or generated more rents). Interestingly, FSU
size, measured by the number of salespeople employed, is signiﬁcantly but negatively
related to the level of total compensation paid. In fact, this reﬂects the tension faced by
many FSUs today. As the customer base increases, salespeople should be motivated
extrinsically to provide equally good quality service to the larger number of accounts
assigned to them. However, as the number of salespeople increases (perhaps to serve
the growing number of customers), the individual’s share of the allocated ﬁnancial
resources might become smaller.

In summary, our ﬁndings make several theoretical contributions to the growing
literature that holds that salespeople’s selling skills and collaborative skills (both directly
and interactively) are valuable, rare, socially complex, and imperfectly imitable (tacit)
knowledge-based resources that enable the FSU to generate higher levels of performance.
Perhaps more importantly, our ﬁndings reveal that those resources do not only generate

Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 11:38 01 February 2017 (PT)
higher performance but also increase salespeople’s compensation. Although there are a
growing number of theoretical arguments suggesting that the holders of valuable
resources should be able to command higher compensation, especially when such
resources are high in social complexity and causal ambiguity, supporting empirical
ﬁndings are limited (Carpenter et al., 2001). In this regard, this is one of the few studies
that not only explores the strategic role of salespeople on competitive advantage, but also
links the sales management literature to the literature on the RBV of the ﬁrm and social
capital/human capital theory in particular.

Managerial implications
Our ﬁndings offer several implications for sales managers. It is necessary for managers
to acknowledge the role of knowledge-based resources in creating organizational
dynamic capabilities. Due to the increasingly changing nature of customers’ demands
and thereby the ever-growing competition among ﬁrms, organizational capabilities are
necessary, but not sufﬁcient, to sustain a long-term competitive advantage (Eisenhardt
and Martin, 2000). Hence, it is important for sales managers to ﬁnd ways to capitalize
on the sources of their organizational knowledge base in order to transform their
capabilities into dynamic capabilities (e.g. Bollinger and Smith, 2001; Eisenhardt and
Martin, 2000). For example, organizations depend partly on salespeople’s skills and
knowledge to sustain their customer-response capability. Consequently, the goal of
organizations should be to create an environment that is capable of measuring, storing,
and capitalizing on their salespeople’s skills, abilities, and expertise (Bollinger and
Smith, 2001). Managers must also acknowledge that both selling skills and
collaborative skills are tacit knowledge-based resources embedded in the human
capital/social capital pool. These skills not only differentiate between high- and
low-performing FSUs, but FSUs possessing such strategically valuable resources are
better able to contribute to the organization’s overall competitive advantage.

Even though managers are able to transfer salespeople with high selling skills, the
organizational structure and systems in which salespeople use their tacit skills and
knowledge will make such skills and knowledge causally ambiguous, such that
competitors will not be able to imitate them easily (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Given
that salespeople’s task-speciﬁc knowledge and skills improve over time (Pisano, 1994),
managers might consider (reconsider) different means to help their subordinates
demonstrate and improve such knowledge and skills more efﬁciently. For example,
collaborative relationships play a pivotal role in the transfer of tacit knowledge
between salespeople and their co-workers/colleagues. Due to the discretionary nature
of collaborative relationships, a strong, positive organizational culture (i.e. open
communication and teamwork orientation) might motivate salespeople to share their
skills and knowledge with others (Bollinger and Smith, 2001). Through open
communication and teamwork orientation, most of the motivational barriers to
collaborative relationships should be mitigated (Szulanski, 1996).

Managers must also appreciate that unless collaborative relationships become an
organizational routine, it is very difﬁcult – if not impossible – to facilitate more
effective knowledge exchange among different units of the organization. Building on
the existing level of knowledge-based resources through collaborative relationships is
vital
to organizations seeking to generate dynamic capabilities. Besides
organization-wide cultural adaptation (or change), the collaborative relationships

904

which facilitate tacit skills/knowledge transfer (or exchange) might require speciﬁc
HRM practices (e.g. Grant, 1996a, b). At this stage, we suggest that greater emphasis
on training and mentorship might help salespeople to improve their selling skills and
collaborative relationships within the organization. We suggest
that managers
implement HRM practices to gain further advantages from salespeople’s (tacit) skills
and knowledge. Although most HRM practices show certain commonalities across
organizations, when an organization implements certain practices to support speciﬁc
tacit skills and knowledge, they will not only enhance the barriers to imitation, but the
way that the HRM practices are implemented will become unique to that organization
(e.g. Wright et al., 2001).

Finally, one important implication of our ﬁndings concerns the allocation of generated
rents between salespeople and their organizations. It is not our purpose to study what is
needed to increase salesperson retention in order to protect knowledge-based resources.
However, it is common knowledge that the high level of turnover faced by sales
organizations and the drainage of knowledge-based resources are likely to endanger the
FSU’s capacity to generate dynamic capabilities. Satisfaction with pay and fairness of
the process used in determining the level of compensation are important determinants of
salesperson turnover. In order for the FSU to expand and beneﬁt from their knowledge
base, knowledgeable salespeople must be compensated adequately. Furthermore, the
crucial nature of the resources salespeople offer to the ﬁrm and their macro-level impact
on the organization’s competitiveness suggest that managerial decisions regarding
salespeople’s compensation must be taken very seriously.

Limitations and future research
Despite its contributions, like most others, our study also has some limitations. First,
we collected our data by using a non-probability sample selection procedure.
Undeniably,
this procedure limits the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Future
researchers should employ a probability sample to avoid limited generalizability.
Second, we relied on a single source (i.e. FSMs) to collect data. This raises the issue of
common-method bias that can never be ruled out completely. Future researchers
should employ a multiple-source, multiple-data research setting to control common
method bias in order to improve the reliability of their ﬁndings. Studies that combine
both primary data and secondary data sources are highly desirable. Secondary data
might also help to mitigate the likely threat of common method bias. Our study
measured FSU performance in terms of sales volume, proﬁtability, and customer
satisfaction (e.g. Cravens et al., 1993). To do so, we relied on FSMs’ self-assessment of
these three performance measures. Future researchers might mitigate (or minimize)
common method bias by designing their studies to be able to reach secondary sources
of performance measures. In this respect, there can be different approaches to be taken
by researcher to reduce the likely threat of common method bias in their studies. For
example, researchers might design their studies in such a way to be able to extract all
the constructs from secondary sources such as COMPUSTAT. Previous studies that
have drawn on the RBV have commonly followed this approach (Carpenter et al., 2001).
When researchers prefer ﬁeld surveys as study design (i.e. perceptual measures) they
might choose to survey those companies that are listed in secondary sources. This will
enable researchers to match perceptual measures obtained from ﬁeld surveys with
objective performance data available in secondary sources.

increase shareholder value (Srivastava et al., 1998). Consequently,

Thirdly, like most studies that have drawn on the RBV, our study also suffers an
appropriate parameterization of the value of salespeople’s knowledge and skills (Priem
and Butler, 2001). For example, it is likely that the value of intellectual resources can be
leveraged by customer-value enhancing investments to drive market performance and,
in turn,
the
resource-competitive value relationships might not always be direct, as measured in this
study. For example, future researchers should consider how customer-value enhancing
investments leverage the value of salespeople’s skills and knowledge to generate
superior performance. A related matter is the inclusion of performance measures in this
study. As Srivastava et al. (2001, p. 797) note, “pursuing entrepreneurial rents implicitly
recognizes the need for investment in market-based resources, with the clear implication
that market-based assets and capabilities can be leveraged for both marketplace
performance (e.g. higher market share), and ﬁnancial returns (e.g. higher margins, faster
cash ﬂows)”. In this sense, our study does not offer a complete picture of the competitive
value of salespeople’s skills and knowledge. Our performance measures are based on
internally driven targets. As such, they are missing exogenous measures of the value of
salespeople’s skills and knowledge. Future researchers should consider a broader and a
more complete range of performance measures in their studies.

Fourth, our model predicts that the higher the level of FSU performance, the greater
the total compensation paid to salespeople. However, a reverse relationship is also
possible and previous researchers have already examined this relationship. Due to the
cross-sectional nature of our dataset, we were not able to test the causality of the
relationship between FSU performance and compensation. A similar argument can
also be made in regard to the relationship between total compensation and the level of
knowledge-based resources accumulated over time. Hence, future studies might
explore alternative causal relationships by employing longitudinal data.

Despite all these limitations, we trust that our study will prompt others to conduct
additional studies in this area. In fact, there is a need for more rigorous research to
appreciate the organizational outcomes that can be derived from the effective use of
knowledge-based resources in sales units. One area of research is to identify other
types of knowledge-based resources that are available to various sales organizations
and investigate their impact on organizational performance. In the same vein, selling
skills and collaborative skills both directly and interactively inﬂuence FSU
performance more under uncertain environmental conditions than they do under
stable environmental conditions (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). Future researchers might
explore the contingency role of environmental turbulence on the performance impact of
knowledge-based resources.

One interesting extension might be to include the rate of sales force turnover as a
measure of performance (Davis et al., 2000). In fact, sales force retention is increasingly
becoming a serious managerial problem (e.g. Bartol, 1999). By designing an effective
incentive plan, sales organizations might increase their level of sales force retention.
However, we know very little about how this problem can be resolved through the
effective design of control systems. There is empirical evidence that because turnover
is higher in sales organizations where an outcome-control system is in place, there is
also a stronger negative relationship between employee turnover and organizational
performance (e.g., Arthur, 1994). Nevertheless, the sales management literature stands
to beneﬁt from further studies covering sales force turnover.
