on eﬃciency and innovation

(Received October 2004)

This study tested the eﬀect of integrated product development (IPD) on the
eﬃciency and innovation displayed in new product development (NPD) projects.
IPD refers to the overlap, parallel execution, and concurrent workﬂow of
activities. More than 600 employees from 62 R&D projects in one large hi-tech
electronics organisation participated in the study. The degree to which the
projects had actual IPD, innovated and worked eﬃciently were measured using
the organisation’s data collection system and questionnaires. Analysis was
conducted at the project level. Seven regression models, as well as multiple
comparison tests, were applied. The ﬁndings suggest that IPD is positively
associated with eﬃciency and negatively with innovation. However, the trade-oﬀ
between eﬃciency and innovation in NPD projects can be balanced, if the IPD
level of implementation is tailored to the NPD project stages. Speciﬁcally, to
successfully complete an NPD project, the emphasis in early stages must be on
innovation so that it can assist teams seeking new ideas. Hence, management
should implement a low level of IPD at this point. In later stages eﬃciency
must be emphasised so it assists control, and co-ordination, and consequently,
IPD should be implemented intensively.

1. Introduction

To be competitive, organisations must keep new product development (NPD)
projects working eﬃciently. Eﬃciency means delivering high quality products and
services on time and at a lower cost than that of their competitors. At the same time,
organisations must also continuously oﬀer innovative products and services.
Innovation is a powerful source of competitive advantage (Prahalad and Krishnan
1999, Brawn and Eshenhard 1998). NPD projects vary in their goals and scope, yet
since innovation refers to the basic meaning of production or the adoption of useful
ideas, innovation is applicable to diﬀerent types of NPD projects (Damanpour 1991,
Scott and Bruce 1994, Van de Ven et al. 1999).

Though there are organisations that succeed in balancing eﬃciency and inno-
vation, by their very nature, tension exists between these processes, and emphasis on

one may mean harming the other (Argote 1999, pp. 194–197; Sitkin et al. 1994).
The management practices and paradigms that lead to innovation and eﬃciency are
diﬀerent and generally contradictory (Brown and Eisneard 1997, Damanpour 1991).
Eﬃciency demands standardization, control, and conformity to rules and procedures
(Prahalad and Krishnan 1999); innovation requires ﬂexibility, breaking from existing
paradigms, autonomy, risk taking, and tolerance for mistakes in the pursuit of new
and prospective knowledge (Levinthal and March 1993).

(IPD) programs. IPD,

in product development activities,

As a way of improving NPD project performance, organisations implement
integrated product development
today’s most popular
movement in new product development, is a managerial approach for improving
NPD performance through the overlap, parallel execution, and concurrent workﬂow
of activities (eﬀorts have also been made to support the respective decision-making
processes
see Ahn and Dyckhoﬀ 1997).
Cross-functional teams are established for integration and co-ordination between
diﬀerent organisational units (Adler 1995), and the emphasis is on early involvement
of all in the organisation that are associated with the new product (Koufteros et al.
2002). In this way, constraints and limitations that might appear in later stages of
the NPD project, or even as late as in its manufacturing stage, are taken into
consideration in the early stages, when they can still be dealt with at low cost and
without causing serious delays (Gerwin and Barrowman 2002). IPD is implemented
in more than 60% of NPD projects, in various manifestations such as concurrent
engineering, design for manufacturing, early manufacturing involvement, and time
based competition (Gerwin and Barrowman 2002, Griﬃn 1997).

While there is extensive literature on innovation and eﬃciency as separate
constructs, the literature does not oﬀer a solid theory on the relationship between
the two, particularly in the context of NPD and as result of the use of IPD.
This study theorised that IPD aﬀects both eﬃciency and innovation in NPD
projects. It then attempted to test whether there is a trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency
and innovation in NPD projects as a result of IPD implementation. Further, given
that such a trade-oﬀ exists, we present ways to eliminate it.

2. Theory and hypothesis development

2.1 Integrated product development (IPD)

Implementing IPD in NPD projects refers to the eﬀect of organisational structure on
performance (eﬃciency and innovation). In general, studies on formal organisational
structure have suggested that organisational structure does aﬀect organisational
performances (Pugh et al. 1968). IPD refers to the formal, structural conﬁguration
of both individuals and groups within the diﬀerent organisational units, and to the
process of co-ordinating of NPD tasks, responsibilities and authority (Adler 1995,
Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995). It signiﬁes the chain of command and the decision-
making process in NPD projects; it also deﬁnes who is supposed to communi-
cate with whom, and the conﬁguration of the reporting relationships. Moreover,
IPD establishes the responsibilities of the product development managers and
other organisational units, primarily the manufacturing unit, and emphasises
co-ordination (Harris and Raviv 2002). Co-ordination means establishing cross-
functional teams and holding routine meetings. The co-ordination can be executed
across many diﬀerent groups and levels; for example, among diﬀerent groups


Eﬀect of integrated product development on eﬃciency and innovation

2791

within the organisation’s R&D unit that are working on the same project; between
the current NPD project team and groups in other organisations’ R&D units that are
working on the same project; among groups within the R&D unit that are working
on diﬀerent projects (the portfolio of projects); among R&D and other organisa-
tional units, such as manufacturing, purchasing, and marketing and, of course,
with customers. Co-ordinating among R&D and other organisational units deter-
mines the boundaries between R&D activities and those of the other units.
Eliminating the boundaries between R&D unit activities and other organisational
units is done by cross-functional planning of products and emphasising the
co-ordination with the manufacturing unit/s and processes (Koufteros et al. 2002).
IPD underscores the involvement of units other than R&D in the early, as opposed
to the advanced, stages of NPD activities.

2.2 Example—IPD in Toyota

To gain increased understanding of how IPD is applied in daily practice, we
approached managers in charge of NPD projects for the Toyota car company
about their activities. Toyota is the world’s second largest auto manufacturer, and
has just recently surpassed Ford in annual (2003) new cars sales. It is well known
for its eﬃcient operations systems (Kennedy and Ward 2003). The responsibility for
co-ordinating activities such as the development of chassis, upper body, and interior
designs, as well as liaison activities between Toyota’s Technical Center and
Toyota Motor Corporation, resides with the development, planning, and operations
department. This department serves as the main contact and point of co-ordination
between corporate headquarters in Japan and the North American design, proto-
type, manufacturing, and sales operations. As such, the department is heavily
involved in pre-planning, design development, and application of principles
of design for manufacturability, as well as in the development of sales strategies.
The development, planning and operations department also has a cost-planning
group that works very closely with design engineers and the purchasing department
throughout the development process, to track and control vehicle cost.

As a result of the use of IPD, Toyota claims to have signiﬁcantly accelerated
the introduction of new car models, by up to two to three years. Toyota Technical
Center managers explain that taking manufacturing capabilities into consideration
in NPD projects helps solve problems that would otherwise arise during the
manufacturing stage; and thus, it reduces the time needed to transfer a new car
model to the manufacturing unit.

2.3 IPD eﬀect on eﬃciency

Operation management literature argues strongly that IPD is essential for NPD
project eﬃciency (Gerwin and Barrowman 2002). Eﬃciency is expressed in meeting
cost and time-to-market objectives and also in aspects of good quality (Flynn et al.
1994). Early dissemination of information makes it possible to reduce the occurrence
of time-consuming changes. Cross-functional work brings together a variety of
specialists who share information. It clariﬁes product requirements before time
and money have been invested. Early involvement enables ﬁtting the new product
to manufacturing capabilities and existing supply chains. Manufacturing
division engineers are involved in the diﬀerent R&D stages, thus improving design


2792

for manufacturability. The manufacturing unit is given a say in product design
before decisions are ﬁnalized. There are joint responsibilities for transferring the
new products to manufacturing, and R&D engineers escort the new product through
manufacturing lines.

The joint work is intended to attain the following beneﬁcial objectives:

. to minimise the number of parts and operations;
. to ensure that process capabilities are known, and that the design either falls
within these parameters or that there is enough time to improve and acquire
new capabilities as needed;

. to use standard procedures, materials, and processes of already known and

proven quality;

. to design multifunctional and multi-use components and modules;
. to design for ease of joining, separating, and rejoining;
. to design for one-way assembly;
. to avoid delicate designs requiring extraordinary eﬀort or attentiveness.

In this way, IPD bolsters the eﬃciency of NPD projects and is positively associated
with meeting deadlines and budgets, and also assuring product quality.

2.4 NPD project uncertainty

The literature of IPD in general barely relates to diﬀerences between projects aims
and scope. For example, the signiﬁcance of whether the NPD project aim is to
introduce modest changes, a major product redesign or a completely new product
is rarely discussed. Since the aim of an NPD project may be associated with the
potential gain in eﬃciency and innovation, we followed Song and Montoya-Weiss’
(2001) theory of uncertainty to control this possible eﬀect. Uncertainty here connotes
the lack of knowledge about the exact means for accomplishing the project. Control
is gained either by comparing NPD projects with similar levels of uncertainty, or
by using appropriate statistical methods when NPD projects have diﬀerent levels
of uncertainty (see the method section below; Ahmad & Schroeder, 2003). Thus, in
line with the research and practice literature, our ﬁrst hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: After controlling for uncertainty, IPD has a positive eﬀect on the
eﬃciency of NPD projects.

2.5 IPD eﬀect on innovation

While as seen above, operations management literature discusses IPD’s eﬀect on
eﬃciency, it hardly deals at all with the eﬀect of IPD on NPD project innovativeness.
IPD emphasises manufacturing and budget concerns, which are considered
detrimental to the autonomy and ﬂexibility needed for innovation (Marcus 1988).
Co-ordination with operations units, especially with manufacturing, emphasises the
economically rational choice of the least costly solutions that can ensure acceptable
ﬁt (Adler 1995). Since manufacturing is associated with current organisational
capabilities, limitations of supply chains, and cost and time of operations, it limits
the NPD engineers’
independent thinking and initiative, which are needed for
meeting emerging situations, responding to new opportunities, and making the
most of a consistently growing body of knowledge. Manufacturing emphasises
standardisation processes, while innovation is associated with individuals’ discretion


Eﬀect of integrated product development on eﬃciency and innovation

2793

the use and development of

and autonomy, as well as few rules and constraints. Under IPD, the ability to
exercise discretion regarding the scope of the NPD project, in terms of experimenta-
tion and improvisation, is limited. Innovation reﬂects a learning (Glynn 1996) that
combines inventiveness and idea borrowing (Cohen and Levinthal 1990), as well as
exploration, i.e. the pursuit of new and prospective knowledge, and of things that
might come to be known (Levinthal and March 1993). Co-ordination, which aims
to streamline the manufacturing of a new product, is commonly associated with
exploitation, which is
things already known
(Levinthal and March 1993). Emphasis on innovation encourages responsiveness
to new opportunities, the breaking of existing paradigms, autonomy, risk taking,
divergent
thinking, and tolerance for mistakes. Conversely, an emphasis on
integration within the organisation with a focus on manufacturing aspects promotes
conformity to rules and procedures, precision, and accuracy (O’Reilly et al. 1991).
More IPD means more communication channels oﬀering rich information
that can initiate new ideas. Nevertheless, and though it is not intended to do so,
this communication commonly deals mainly with manufacturability demands.
Communication channels may potentially contribute to innovation through the
exchange and evaluation of new ideas and product concepts. Findings, however,
suggest that since operations and manufacturing are usually restricted to tough
deadlines and budgetary concerns, R&D units that communicate more with opera-
tions, get involved with the routine work associated with manufacturing parameters
to such an extent that excess or slack resources are trimmed (Nohria and Gulati
1996). These ﬁndings concur with Adler’s (1995) argument that co-ordination
among operations units, especially with manufacturing, emphasises the economically
rational choice of the least costly solutions that can ensure acceptable ﬁt.

In addition, organisational innovation is aﬀected by the interaction between
creativity and implementation. Involving the units in charge of implementation in
the planning stages emphasises the production stage and de-emphasises the creative
aspects (Amabile et al. 2002). Implementation is based on formalisation and
standardisation, which are negatively associated with creativity (Damanpour
1991). Thus, our second hypothesis is:

Hypothesis 2: After controlling for uncertainty, IPD has a negative eﬀect on new
product innovation.

2.6 Balancing eﬃciency and innovation

Taking into consideration Hypotheses 1 and 2, the question is how can both
eﬃciency and innovation be maintained when IPD is implemented? The dominant
approach in the literature identiﬁes a trade-oﬀ between innovation and eﬃciency
(Benner and Tushman 2002, Sitkin et al. 1994). Nevertheless, recently a second
approach has been suggested, which asserts that innovation and eﬃciency can
co-exist (Adler et al. 1999, Argote 1999, Brown and Eisenhardt 1998, Levinthal
& March 1993, Mirone et al. 2004). This approach emphasises the need to create
a balance between innovation and eﬃciency. Brown and Eisenhardt (1998) proposed
balancing the structure vital for meeting budgets and schedules with a ﬂexibility that
ensures proper conditions for innovation. Argote (1999, pp. 194–197) recognised the
existing tension between heterogeneity and standardisation, but pointed out that
some organisations manage to balance both.


2794

E. Naveh

An approach that balances innovation and eﬃciency may be a solution to the
IPD implementation dilemma. If, instead of understanding IPD as presented in the
literature—as eﬃciency centred, a diﬀerent perspective is adopted—IPD as a ﬂexible
process, the conﬂict problem may be resolved. A ﬂuctuating implementation of
IPD means that early involvement, overlap, and parallel execution can be applied
in varying degrees, and that they can change in the course of the NPD project.
Below, we elaborate on the theory behind a ﬂuctuating implementation of IPD.

2.7 NPD project gates

NPD projects are commonly divided into stages called ‘gates’ (Ding and Eliashberg
2002). Only when the designated objective of one gate is complete does the NPD
project move to the next gate. Speciﬁcally, Gate 1 activities concern preliminary
assessment and opportunity identiﬁcation; Gate 2 activities are about detailed
assessments, enabling scientiﬁc and conceptual growth; Gate 3 activities centre on
the development stage; Gate 4 activities are about the validation stage; and Gate 5
activities focus on moving to continuous manufacturing and the commercial launch.
Gate activities generate the information required for assessment of the NPD project
along key dimensions. These dimensions establish the decision criteria at each gate
necessary for advancing the project to the next stage. The information gathered
refers to a strategic ﬁt with the business strategy and needs; the market, business
customers, and the potential breadth of application; economic attractiveness, key
business issues, and uncertainties; and technical feasibility and risks. As the later
gates are approached and the project advances, the information required for exiting
one gate and going on to the next becomes more detailed, accurate, and inclusive.

2.8 A ﬂuctuating implementation of IPD

In the early stages of NPD projects, teams seek to cultivate new ideas. As the product
development process moves forward, and ideas are being transformed into a feasible
reality, emphasis on experimental learning declines (Katz 1982, Lewis et al. 2002).
Van de Ven and Polley (1992) found that, as NPD projects progress, their goals
and potential for success become clearer, and teams become increasingly focused
and routine-oriented. In other words, early stages of NPD projects require more
innovation, which could be gained by providing engineers with ﬂexibility, autonomy,
and freedom. However, in later stages, implementation becomes the major issue
and more co-ordination and control are required (Lewis et al. 2002).

It is thus that innovation needs to be emphasised in the early stages so that teams
seeking new ideas are galvanised, and in the later stages it is eﬃciency that has
to be emphasised, enabling routine-orientation in order to successfully complete
the project. Since IPD has a positive eﬀect on the eﬃciency of NPD projects
(Hypothesis 1) and has a negative eﬀect on their innovation (Hypothesis 2), in
order to emphasise innovation in early stages of the project and not disrupt the
development of new ideas, IPD should be applied at a low level. If IPD were
implemented in such a way that in the early stages, particularly before validation,
its guidelines were applied less strictly, thus allowing the freedom that engineers need
to produce an innovative product,
innovation would not suﬀer. This can be
done without decreasing the eﬃciency or with a relatively minor negative eﬀect
on eﬃciency. Increasing IPD implementation in later stages will yield the level


Eﬀect of integrated product development on eﬃciency and innovation

2795

of integration needed to achieve eﬃciency, since it is in the advanced stages of
NPD projects that eﬃciency is the key. Thus, eﬀorts to foster innovation should
diminish and the drive for eﬃciency should intensify as the project shifts from idea
generation to manufacturing, and eventually, to product launch.

Another explanation for why a ﬂuctuating implementation of IPD will enable
the balancing of eﬃciency and innovation can be found in innovation literature.
Innovation literature suggests that innovation, which is a combination of creativity
and implementation, is in many cases based on creativity whose source is on the
individual level (Van de Ven and Polley 1992). Thus, in the early stages of NPD
projects when creativity is needed for idea generation, less emphasis on IPD, which
would signify limiting cross-functional work, would not harm innovation since
the main activity is, anyway, on the individual level.

A somewhat similar argument for the ﬂuctuating implementation of IPD can
be drawn from the work of Lewis et al. (2002). They followed 80 projects over
a two-year period and found that it was common for managers in some NPD
projects to vary the degree of monitoring and control activities over time. They
found that in successful NPD projects, managers unintentionally applied less
monitoring and control in the early stages, and increased the levels in later stages.
Asking managers in charge of NPD projects at Toyota about their activities
revealed that such a methodology is applied, to some extent even unintentionally,
and has led to successful NPD projects. The technical research group at Toyota, for
example, which is responsible for investigating new technologies related to electro-
mechanics and providing Toyota Motor Corporation with the information necessary
to make decisions about future product development, reported implementing a low
level of co-ordination with other units in the early gates of NPD projects. Only in
later stages was the level of implementation and co-ordination increased. From
Gate 3 onwards, engineers work closely with the manufacturing plants to ensure
all operational and quality issues are recognized and related needs are met. Thus, our
third hypothesis is:

Hypothesis 3: After controlling for uncertainty, NPD projects that apply a low
level of IPD in early stages of the project and a high level of IPD in advanced
stages will attain similar eﬃcient and higher innovative performance than NPD
projects that apply a high level of IPD starting from early stages of the project.

3. Method

3.1 Study site

The study was conducted in one large hi-tech electronics organisation, with an R&D
unit of about 2500 engineers and technicians that deals simultaneously with about
200 R&D projects. The organisation had been implementing IPD in its NPD pro-
jects for the past 10 years. The directive of top management was to implement IPD,
which they followed through by publishing formal implementation rules; however,
they left the extent of IPD implementation in each project (i.e. which activities to
implement and when—see IPD items below in table 1) up to the project management
team. The vice CEO for R&D explained that adopting such a policy regarding
IPD implementation was part of the organisation’s autonomy policy for the R&D
staﬀ, following benchmarking on R&D divisions in 3M, Philips, Toyota, and Nokia.

Eﬀect of integrated product development on eﬃciency and innovation

2797

Before conducting the study, we met with 18 people from all of the diﬀerent levels
of the R&D unit. All managers with whom we spoke claimed that the NPD
projects varied in the extent to which IPD was implemented.

The subjects for this study were 62 R&D projects, all of which ended in the same
year. We followed these projects for two and half years—from beginning to end.
Each of these projects ended with a product in the manufacturing stage, which
operation took place within the organisation. By the end of the study, all the
products had been installed and used by customers for at least three months.
According to the organisation’s managers, these 62 projects had no speciﬁc
characteristics distinguishing them from other projects. The customers of the
projects were major players in the hi-tech electronics market, thus a similar priority
was given to all projects.

3.2 Measures

variables.

IPD activities. Questionnaire

items drew on
3.2.1 Independent
Koufteros et al. (2002) and Adler (1995, see table 1). Respondents were asked to
rank the extent to which IPD activities were applied in their project. All question-
naires distributed in this study, including this one, used the ﬁve-point Likert scale,
ranging from 1 (to a very low extent) to 5 (to a very high extent). In this and in
all other questionnaires in this study, respondents were asked to refer to their
NPD project.

3.2.2 Dependent variables. Eﬃciency. Five measures were used to measure
eﬃciency:

1. Product efﬁcient design was measured by a questionnaire with related items

drawing on Gerwin and Barrowman (2002, see table 1).

2. Percent of deviation from the unit-cost (in US$) objective.
3. Percent of deviation from the time-to-market (in months) objective.

Objectives for unit-cost and time-to-market were set at the beginning of each NPD
project. The degree to which these objectives were achieved was evaluated when
the project terminated. A negative deviation represented an improvement over the
anticipated achievement.

4. Mean time between failures (MTBF, in hours).
5. Mean time to repair (MTTR, in hours).

The products of all the projects in this study were implemented immediately after
the project ended. Therefore, we were able to collect the data necessary for measur-
ing reliability and maintainability, i.e. measures 4 and 5 (above), during the ﬁrst
three months following the project’s completion.

Innovation. We measured innovation using three criteria:

1. The number of patent requests submitted by each project.
2. The innovation-oriented atmosphere during the NPD project, which was
measured using a questionnaire based on Gatignon et al. (2002, see table 1).
3. The level of innovation represented by the ﬁnal product, which was measured

using a questionnaire based on Gatignon et al. (2002, see table 1).

Factor analysis. Table 1 is an exploratory factor analysis of the four variables
that were measured by questionnaires (IPD, eﬃcient product design, innovation-
oriented atmosphere, and ﬁnal product
innovation). As shown in the table,
four distinct varimax rotated factors were identiﬁed from the 27 original items.
All items ﬁt the dimensions, as we had anticipated (factor loadings were, as required,
higher than 0.4 in the ﬁt factor and much smaller in the other factors).

3.2.3 Control variables. Drawing from the literature on management practices
implementation and NPD management
(Nutt 1986, Klein and Sorra 1996,
Tatikonda and Rosenthal 2000), ﬁve control variables were used.

1. Perceived project team technical proﬁciency. Technical proﬁciency refers to
the technical ability and knowledge necessary to translate needs into product
speciﬁcations and prototypes, to conduct engineering and manufacturing
evaluations and product testing, and to build a ﬁnal product (Song and
Montoya-Weiss 2001). Perceived refers to the perceptions of the R&D project
team members themselves. This variable used Song and Montoya-Weiss’
(2001) questionnaire items. These items queried the degree to which the
project team, the organisation’s management, and the customer believed
that the project team had the technical ability and knowledge necessary to:
conduct engineering and manufacturing evaluations; perform product
prototyping and testing; translate needs into technical product speciﬁcations;
determine product speciﬁcations; and build the ﬁnal product.

2. Customer involvement. A second related control variable was customer
involvement (Hackman and Wageman 1995, Baldrige 2001). Customer
involvement means that the customer participates routinely in the daily
activities of the project and its review. This variable used questionnaire
items based on Schneider et al. (2002). The items queried the degree to
which the project’s customer participated in daily activities; participated
in reviewing activities; governed the project by demanding strict adherence
to procedures (reverse coded); demonstrated interest only in meeting
deadlines (reverse coded); and gave proﬁciency input.

3. Project uncertainty. Since NPD projects designed to introduce modest
changes might be associated with a lower level of uncertainty than NPD
projects that focus on redesign of a product or a completely new product,
differences among the various projects’
innovative performance may be
associated with the level of innovation demanded at the outset. The project
uncertainty variable, which was measured using Song and Montoya-Weiss’
(2001) questionnaire items and followed their theory, controlled for these
differences. The items queried the degree of newness of the following
elements: product modules; product conﬁguration; product technologies
intended for this project;
individual manufacturing stages; and layout
process.

In addition,
comparing diﬀerent NPD projects:

the following two variables provided supplementary bases for

Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcients for questionnaire-based independent, dependent,
and control variables ranged from 0.90 to 0.95, which exceeds the recommended
minimum of 0.7 for combining the questions of each variable together on one scale
(Nunnally 1994, p. 245). Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient for each variable can be
seen in the diagonal in table 2.

The mean of the responses for the questionnaire items of each variable was

used to operationalize this research variable.

3.2.4 Data collection strategy. The IPD questionnaire was distributed and
collected twice. The ﬁrst time was when the project arrived at Gate 2, at which
point the questions referred to the activities of the project’s previous stage.
The IPD questionnaire was distributed and collected a second time at the end of
the project (Gate 5). Here, again, the questions referred to the activities of the
stage immediately before this one (Gate 4 activities). The questionnaires, which
investigated project uncertainty and technical proﬁciency, were also collected at
Gate 2. All other questionnaires were collected at the end of the project (Gate 5).
Moreover, the organisation routinely collected data regarding study measures
that were not based on our questionnaires, for its own use; for the purpose of this
study, we availed ourselves of some of their data collected at the end of the project.
MTBF and MTTR data were also collected by the organisation’s routine data
collection, and we used the data they gathered for the three months after the end
of the project.

A ﬁrst group of one-ﬁfth of the people working in the projects responded to
the questionnaires. The response breakdown was as follows: 618 individuals
responded to the ﬁrst questionnaire and 623 replied to the second regarding IPD
activities; 607 replied regarding customer involvement; 610 replied regarding tech-
nical proﬁciency, and 618 replied regarding project uncertainty. In addition,
a second group of respondents, one-ﬁfth of the people who worked on the projects,
ﬁlled out the innovation-oriented atmosphere questionnaire (623), ﬁnal product
innovation questionnaire (625), and product eﬃcient design questionnaire (612).
The two groups were not totally identical. The smallest number of respondents
per project was 12 and the largest number was 23.

The organisation’s top management encouraged participation in the study, and

the response rate on all questionnaires in all projects was approximately 100%.

3.2.5 Level of analysis. The analysis was conducted at the project level since
eﬃciency and innovative performance data existed at this level. Individual responses
to the questionnaires were aggregated to the project level (James et al. 1984), by
calculating for each project the mean scores of each variable. We tested for the
homogeneity of responses at the project level by calculating the Rwg coeﬃcients
(James et al. 1984) of the variable for each of 62 R&D projects. The Rwg(j) for
the variables measured with questionnaires ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. This justiﬁed
the aggregation of the variables to the project level.

level of analysis are summarised in table 2.

Eﬀect of integrated product development on eﬃciency and innovation

2801

To test our hypotheses, we set up seven regression models on the project level of
analysis (table 3). Models 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 related to the eﬃciency of the NPD
project and models 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 related to the innovation of the new product.
Models 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 tested the ﬁrst hypothesis, i.e. that IPD has a positive
eﬀect on the eﬃciency of NPD projects. Results demonstrated that both at the
beginning of the project and at later stages, IPD had a signiﬁcant and positive
eﬀect on all four eﬃciency dependent variables. These ﬁndings support the ﬁrst
hypothesis. One exception, however, was the MTTR variable, for which no model
that ﬁt, similar to model 1.3 (which explained MTBF), could be found (thus, the
model was omitted from table 3).

Models 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 tested the second hypothesis, which claimed that IPD
has a negative eﬀect on new product innovation. Results demonstrated that the eﬀect
of IPD at the beginning of the project was signiﬁcant and negative on product
innovation. These ﬁndings support the second hypothesis.

The control variables—project uncertainty, project team size, and project dura-
tion—were not signiﬁcant. This suggests that diﬀerences in the level of innovation
and eﬃciency were not the results of diﬀerences between these project characteristics.
In addition, the adjusted R-squared of the models (see table 3), which were at the
level of about 0.20, suggested that IPD (and the other variables used) do explain
a reasonable amount of variance in performance of the NPD projects.

We included the eﬀect of innovation on eﬃciency (Models 1.x) and of eﬃciency
on innovation (Models 2.x) in the regression models to demonstrate the literature’s
claim of trade-oﬀ between the two. Speciﬁcally, the coeﬃcients of the innovation
variables (patents, innovation-oriented atmosphere, and ﬁnal product innovation)
in models 1.1, 1.2 are positive—which means that more innovation leads to deviation
in the eﬃciency measures in the direction of higher cost and time-to-market.
In model 1.3 the coeﬃcient of the ﬁnal product innovation variable was negative,
which suggests that more innovation leads to shorter time between failures. Thus, the
innovation variables led to signiﬁcantly less eﬃcient NPD projects. Project eﬃcient
design had a negative eﬀect in models 2.2 and 2.3, which suggests that more eﬃciency
leads to less innovation.

Following the above trade-oﬀ ﬁndings and to test the third hypothesis that
suggested that IPD could balance this trade-oﬀ, the following analyses were
performed. We will recall that the third hypothesis speciﬁcally claimed that NPD
projects using a low level of IPD in the early stages of the project and a high level of
IPD in advanced stages would reach similar eﬃciency and higher innovative per-
formance than projects using a high level of IPD starting from an early stage of
the project. To check this we divided the 62 projects into four groups according to
the change in IPD implementation over the course of the project. We calculated
the median split of IPD activities at the beginning and late in the project; and the
rule for high and low was based on the median. Thus, the four groups were classiﬁed
as having:

1. A drop in IPD activities—projects that were above the median in IPD

activities at the beginning and below the median activities in later stages.

2. High and stable IPD activities—projects that were above the median at both

the beginning and the late stages.

3. Low and stable IPD activities—projects that were below the median at both

the beginning and the late stages.

4. An increase in IPD activities—projects that were below the median at the

beginning and above it in the late stages.

Table 4 presents the mean and standard deviations of variables for which a signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence was found between the four groups, based on the F-test. In addition,
for each such variable, we performed a Duncan multiple comparison test, comparing
the groups to identify speciﬁc diﬀerences between them (see table 4). Note, that there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the four groups as far as concerns the control
variables.

The group deﬁned by an increase in IPD activities was found to have the highest
scores on innovation variables: number of patents, innovation-oriented atmosphere
and, ﬁnal product innovation. It also had the highest score on the MTBF eﬃciency
variable. The group high and stable IPD activities had the highest eﬃciency
variables: product eﬃcient design, and the best close to target unit-cost and
time-to-market. These ﬁndings support the third hypothesis to a great extent
about innovation and to some extent about eﬃciency. The result concerning the
MTBF variable even strengthens the argument of the third hypothesis and brings
some evidence to broaden the claim for the positive eﬀect of ﬂuctuating IPD also
on eﬃciency performance.

5. Discussion

Too little is known about how to manage an NPD project so that it yields highly
innovative products. IPD is assumed to lead to high eﬃciency in NPD projects.
Though organisations spend large amounts of money on NPD projects, there has
been relativity little empirical research that investigated the eﬀect of IPD on both
eﬃciency and innovation. This is the ﬁrst empirical to do so.

In developing its theory, this study combined operation management theory,
which deals primarily with the eﬀect of IPD on NPD eﬃciency with innova-
tion theory, which primarily identiﬁes sources of innovation apart from eﬃciency.
A notable strength of this research is its design. We collected data in real time, in two
time periods, on IPD; we used a survey to which several members of the NPD
team responded; and in addition, we used objective measures to evaluate NPD
performance. Only a few studies have used such a rich data collection.

This study found that maintaining a high level of IPD throughout NPD projects
led to higher eﬃciency but simultaneously decreased innovation. Thus, the results,
on the whole, present a trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and innovation. Nevertheless,
this study found that a ﬂuctuation in IPD implementation from early to advanced
stages of NPD projects, conducted such that the implementation level is low at the
beginning of the project and high in later stages, yielded a gain in innovation
and maintained eﬃciency.

The most importance conclusion of this study is that it suggests a way for
organisations to eliminate the trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and innovation in NPD
projects. The trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and innovation can be eliminated when the
management practices that are applied in NPD, such as IPD, are monitored so that
they follow a speciﬁc ﬂuctuation pattern. IPD is a management practice that leads
to eﬃciency; however, if it is applied to a lesser extent in early stages of the project
and more extensively in later stages of the project, both eﬃciency and innovation

can be gained. To nurture both eﬃciency and innovation in NPD projects, the early
stages should be managed with a ﬂexible approach that facilitates breaking from
existing paradigms, autonomy, risk taking, and tolerance for mistakes in the pursuit
of new and prospective knowledge. Nevertheless, the advanced stages should have
a more structured orientation that applies standardisation, control, and conformity
to rules and procedures so the level of integration and routine needed for gaining
eﬃciency is reached.

The importance of the study for both theory and application is clear. To date,
no study has developed a theory for the eﬀect of IPD on innovation. Neither has
any study simultaneously tested eﬃciency and innovation as eﬀects of IPD. IPD is
commonly implemented in organisations without management knowing all of its
possible eﬀects. Organisations that choose to follow the conclusion of this study
will implement a low level of IPD at the beginning of NPD projects and increase
its use in later stages. No such simple and straightforward guidance appears in
the academic or practitioner literature.

5.1 Limitations and future research

While this study is important and has a solid design, it has limitations. Future studies
are encouraged to explore the fascinating aspects of operations management and
innovation in NPD projects.

5.1.1 Diﬀerences between IPD projects. The theory that is suggested in this paper
is directed at NPD projects in general, though not all NPD projects are equal in
the level of innovation they demand. We followed Damanpour’s (1991) innovation
deﬁnition that claimed that ‘this deﬁnition is suﬃciently broad to include diﬀerent
types of innovations pertaining to all parts of organisations and aspects of their
operations.’ (p. 556). In addition, the results for the uncertainty control variable
were not signiﬁcant in any of the regression models. Nevertheless, future research
should check our theory in diﬀerent NPD projects. In general, future research could
explore additional conditions under which IPD is more successful, and the primary
drive for innovation, the level of IPD or the expected level of innovation from the
team can be further elaborated.

In this study we followed the well-accepted deﬁnitions of
5.1.2 Elements of IPD.
IPD developed in earlier studies (Koufteros et al. 2002, Ding and Eliashberg 2002),
which did not segment IPD into a list of elements. It would be interesting in future
research to test whether some elements of IPD are useful during all NPD process
stages while others are more eﬀective in later stages.

5.1.3 IPD and MTTR. While the explanation of IPD suggested in this paper holds
for unit-cost, time-to-market, and MTBF eﬃciency variables, MTTR could not be
explained similarly. This means that future research should look for a diﬀerent
explanation for MTTR.

5.1.4 Single organisations. This study was conducted in one organisation, and
dealing with one organisation generally helps avoid potentially confounding
factors (Mukherjee et al. 1998). Actually, under the conditions of one organisation
it is even harder to show the eﬀect of IPD since the variations in IPD between


2806

E. Naveh

projects in one organisation are generally smaller than between IPD projects
in diﬀerent organisations. Nevertheless, future studies should be performed in
several organisations and in diﬀerent sectors. Alternative sites might suggest other
sources of pertinent information. Tests on diﬀerent samples would also further assess
validity, reliability and factor analytic structure. In such studies, organisational
characteristics, such as ﬁnancial strength, the amount of resources allocated for
NPD projects, the eﬀect of market competition, organisational culture, and other
management practices, should be taken into consideration.

Conclusion

The global competition and accelerated improvements in basic technologies demand
that organisations develop the ability to manage eﬃcient NPD projects that yield
innovative products and services. This study found that the trade–oﬀ between
eﬃciency and innovation could be eliminated when the implementation of IPD,
a management practice that is commonly applied in NPD, is monitored to follow
a speciﬁc ﬂuctuation pattern. IPD is a management practice that leads to eﬃciency.
However, if applied to a lesser extent in the early stages of the project and more
extensively in later stages, both eﬃciency and innovation can be gained. More
research on how to increase eﬃciency and innovation in NPD projects may be
particularly advantageous.
