    ABSTRACT 
 In  the  context  of  service  management,  contact 
personnel  are  considered  as  a  crucial  element 
that determines the success of the service deliv-
ery process. From the perspective of marketing 
relationship, the performance of contact person-
nel  helps  to  attract  target  groups  and  define 
corporate reputation. The purpose of the present 
study is to assess, within the services industry, 
the  main  effect  of  two  predominant  character-
istics  of  contact  personnel,  namely  competence 
and  benevolence,  as  well  as  their  interactive 
effects  on  the  perception  of  the  reputation  of 
service  firms,  particularly  from  the  point  of 
view  of  clients.  With  data  collected  from 
445  customers  in  a  financial  service  setting, 
the  results  of  this  study  reveal  that  the 
perception  of  corporate  reputation  has  a  ten-
dency  to  be  higher  when  perceptions  of  both 
competence  and  benevolence  are 
strongly 
favourable.  The  results  suggest  that  benevo-
lence  intervenes  as  a  moderator  variable  to 
enhance the impact of competence on corporate 
reputation.  The  implications  of  the  study  are 
discussed from both the research and manage-
rial perspectives.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Because  of  its  critical  role  in  a  customer ’ s 
buying  behaviour,  corporate  reputation  is 
considered  as  a  key  element  in  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
positioning strategy. Indeed, corporate rep-
utation inﬂ uences the consumer ’ s choice of 
products and services ( Brown, 1995 ;  Yoon 
 et al. , 1993 ), and contributes to develop and 
maintain  customer 
( Robertson, 
1993 ).  Corporate  reputation  also  helps  to 
attract  potential 
investors  and  qualiﬁ ed 
employees  ( Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990 ; 
 Dutton   et  al. ,  1994 ).  Ultimately,  corporate 
reputation effects a ﬁ rm ’ s competiveness in 
the market place ( McMillan and Joshi, 1997 ) 
as well as its ﬁ nancial performance ( Roberts 
and Dowling, 2002 ). 

loyalty 

 In  the  context  of  service  management, 
contact personnel are considered as a crucial 
element  that  determines  the  success  of  the 
service delivery process ( Berry, 2000 ;  Bitner, 
1992 ). From the perspective of a marketing 
relationship,  the  performance  of  contact 
personnel helps to attract target groups and 
deﬁ ne  corporate  reputation.  With  this  in 
mind  and  in  focusing  on  the  capacity  of 
front-line  employees,  the  objective  of  the 
present  study  is  to  assess,  within  the  serv-
ices  industry,  the  main  effect  of  two  pre-
dominant  characteristics  of  contact  personnel, 
namely  competence  and  benevolence,  as

 Competence and Benevolence of Contact Personnel 

well  as  their  interactive  effects  on  the  per-
ception  of  the  reputation  of  service  ﬁ rms, 
particularly from the point of view of clients. 
Existing literature suggests that competence 
and  benevolence  with  integrity  contribute 
to  the  development  of  trust  ( Doney  and 
Cannon, 1997 ;  Ganesan, 1994 ;  Ganesan and 
Hess,  1997 ;   Gurviez  and  Korchia,  2002 ; 
 Kumar  et al. , 1995 ). However, in this study 
we  focus  exclusively  on  competence  and 
benevolence  because  of  their  determinant 
impact  on  the  performance  of  contact 
personnel  during  the  service  encounter 
and  because  of  their  role  in  enhancing 
the  client – business  relationship  ( Lee   et  al. , 
2004 ;  Posdakoff  et al. , 1997 ). At ﬁ rst sight, 
the  relationship  between  competence  and 
benevolence is interesting due to its capac-
ity to reinforce the ability of contact person-
nel to satisfy customers ’  expectations and to 
augment favourably corporate reputation.

 The study consists of four parts. We will 
present, in the ﬁ rst instance, an overview of 
corporate 
and 
benevolence of contact personnel. Secondly, 
the  model  and  the  methods  used  to  inves-
tigate  the  relationships  between  these  con-
cepts  will  be  described  and  explained. 
Thirdly,  the  results  of  the  investigation  are 
presented and analyzed. Finally, a discussion 
of managerial implications concerning com-
petence  and  benevolence  to  enhance  the 
performance  of  contact  personnel,  and 
future  researches  related  to  these  concepts 
will be provided.

information  regarding  the  quality  of  its 
products  or  services  in  comparison  with 
those of its competitors ( Yoon  et al. , 1993 ). 
 Herbig  and  Milewicz  (1993:  18)   deﬁ ne 
reputation  as   ‘ an  estimation  of  the  consist-
ency over time of an attribute of an entity ’ . 
A ﬁ rm can have, therefore, numerous repu-
tations  –  one for each attribute such as price, 
product  quality,  innovativeness,  manage-
ment  quality   –   or  a  global  reputation. 
According  to   Wartick  (1992) ,  corporate 
reputation  is  an   ‘ aggregation  of  a  single 
stakeholder ’ s  perceptions  of  how  well 
organizational  responses  are  meeting  the 
demands and expectations of many organi-
zational 
stakeholders ’ .  This  deﬁ nition 
includes also the focal group ’ s perception of 
the  ﬁ rm ’ s  ability  to  meet  the  expectations 
of groups other than itself. A ﬁ rm ’ s reputa-
tion  may  not  be  common  among  all  the 
groups.  Thus,  the  ﬁ rm  can  have  multiple 
reputations  deﬁ ned  according 
to  each 
combination  of  attribute  and  stakeholder. 
According to  Herbig and Milewicz (1993) , 
corporate  reputation  is  formed  as  a  process 
that accumulates the judgements over time 
of the various groups that interact with the 
ﬁ rm.  The  reputation  of  a  ﬁ rm  is  built 
through its credible actions. It is also fragile 
because  the  impact  of  a  bad  action  on  the 
customer  is  much  stronger  than  that  of  a 
good action.   

 Contact Personnel 
 In general, the role of contact personnel is 
twofold: gathering information and serving

clients ( Aldrich and Herker, 1979 ). Because 
of their strategic position, front-line employees 
receive  from  clients  different  kinds  of 
information,  mostly  related  to  the  service 
offering and delivery procedures. The direct 
contact  with  clients  and  the  knowledge 
they  have  about  the  service  production 
process make contact personnel an impor-
tant  information  source  for  the  organiza-
tion. Moreover, these employees also have 
a  marketing  role  as  representatives  of  the 
organization  and  inﬂ uence  its  customer 
relations.  Many  of  them  are  considered 
as part-time marketers, because they  ‘ con-
duct  marketing  activities  but  do  not  be-
long to the marketing or sales department ’  
( Gummesson, 1991: 60 ). The performance 
of  contact  personnel  largely  depends  on 
their  ability  to  produce  and  deliver  the 
service offering in order to satisfy custom-
ers ’   needs  and  expectations.  In  turn,  this 
ability relies on their competence and be-
nevolence, two crucial characteristics often 
put into practice during face-to-face encounters 
with customers.  

 Competence 
 The  competence  of  contact  employees  is 
derived  from  their  expertize  gained  from 
training and from their experience and it rep-
resents  their  ability  to  communicate  with 
customers in conformity with the procedures 
and  standards  of  the  service  delivery.  It  is 
considered  as  the  capacity  of  employees  to 
complete transactions requested by the client 
and to perform them in such way as to meet 
his  expectations  ( Barclay  and  Smith,  1997 ). 
This competence relies upon a chain of skills 
acquisition and consequence. It depends ini-
tially upon how employees acquire and apply 
the knowledge necessary to accomplish their 
job, and, in the next instance, upon how the 
use of such knowledge gains the client ’ s trust 
and  enhances  his  perception  of  corporate 
reputation ( Doney and Cannon, 1997 ). 

 Competence has two components: tech-
nical  expertize  and  problem  solving  skill 

( Sirdeshmukh   et  al. ,  2002 ).  The  technical 
expertize is the level of knowledge intimately 
related to the activity area of the ﬁ rm. This 
expertize  is  individually  possessed  by  each 
employee  through  his  professional  training 
and  represents  an  important  part  of  the 
qualiﬁ cations  required  at  hiring.  It  can  be 
accumulated  during  the  employee ’ s  entire 
career and enhanced by his participation in 
continuing education. The problem solving 
skill  is  the  ability  of  contact  personnel  to 
manage  situations  of  conﬂ ict  in  which  the 
client  is  involved.  In  such  circumstances, 
they  have  to  take  into  consideration  the 
motivations of both parties, in the effort to 
satisfy  the  client ’ s  needs  and  to  protect  the 
employer ’ s  interests.  The  problem  solving 
skill of contact personnel is the result of their 
individual personality traits and their percep-
tion  of  the  social  interaction  with  clients 
( Hartline  et al. , 2003 ;  Solomon  et al. , 1985 ). 
The two components of competence often 
interact  in  a  complementary  manner  to 
produce better solutions and, consequently, 
both  have  an  influence  on  the  client ’ s 
perception of corporate reputation.   

 Benevolence 
 In  a  client – business  relationship,  benevo-
lence is evoked when employees help clients 
beyond what is prescribed in formal agree-
ments  ( Mayer   et  al. ,  1995 ).  Benevolence  is 
referred  to  as  extra  contractual  behaviours 
of  contact  personnel  that  assist  clients  for 
the purpose of enhancing the well-being of 
the latter. Benevolence is synonymous with 
the willingness to take into consideration the 
partner ’ s  interests  in  the  decision-making 
process.  Benevolent  employees  act  with 
consideration  and  sensitivity  to  the  needs 
and the interests of clients ( Atuahene-Gima 
and  Li,  2002 ;   Bell   et  al. ,  2002 ;   Mudrack 
 et al. , 1999 ;  Upchurch and Ruhland, 1996 ). 
Depending  upon  the  underlying  motive, 
benevolence can be described in two different 
ways: altruistic benevolence and mutualistic 
benevolence.

 Competence and Benevolence of Contact Personnel 

 Altruistic  benevolence  is  deﬁ ned  as   ‘ the 
extent to which a trustee is believed to feel 
interpersonal care and concern, and the will-
ingness to do good to the trustor beyond an 
egocentric  proﬁ t  motive ’   ( Jarvenpaa   et  al. , 
1998:  31 ).  Altruistic  benevolence  refers  to 
extra  contractual  assisting  behaviour  that 
improves the counterpart ’ s well-being with-
out  future  gain.  Contact  employees  who 
adopt an altruistic benevolent behaviour are 
guided  by  their  desire  to  help  clients  even 
if  they  are  not  required  to  do  so  in  their 
job.  They  simply  want  to  provide  unilat-
eral  assistance  on  a  voluntary  basis  without 
egocentric  proﬁ ts.  Regarding  mutualistic 
benevolence,  it  refers  to  extra  contractual 
assisting behaviour motivated by future joint 
gain.  Mutualistic  benevolence  is  deﬁ ned  as 
 ‘ the degree to which one party is genuine-
ly  interested  in  the  other ’ s  well-being 
and  seeks  joint  gain ’   ( Doney  and  Cannon, 
1997: 36 ). Because it is based on reciprocal 
utilitarian  motives,  mutualistic  benevolent 
behaviour may be called as  ‘ calculator ’ . For 
example,  contact  employees  offer  extra 
assistance  to  clients  during  the  service 
encounter hoping to enhance their loyalty.   

 Interaction between competence and 
benevolence 
 It is essential to our argument to examine the 
interaction between competence and benevo-
lence for two reasons. Firstly, competence and 
benevolence  represent  the  most  sought  out 
characteristics of front-line employees at hir-
ing  in  order  to  satisfy  the  customer ’ s  needs 
and expectations. These characteristics mainly 
constitute the capability of contact personnel 
to  assure  the  success  of  the  service  delivery 
process. Secondly, both constructs of compe-
tence and benevolence are identiﬁ ed as major 
beliefs that inspire trust in the context of the 
service  industry  ( McKnight  and  Chervany, 
1996 ).  A  trusting  belief,  as  it  were,  may  be 
deﬁ ned as  ‘ the extent to which one believes 
(and  feels  conﬁ dent  in  believing)  that  the 
other person involved in a relational exchange 

is trustworthy ’  ( Papadopoulou  et al.  2003: 58 ). 
Trusting beliefs along with trusting intentions 
 –   meaning  that  one  is  willing  to  depend  on 
the other person in a given situation  –  form 
customer  trust  towards  a  service  ﬁ rm.  If  the 
interaction between competence and benevo-
lence  is  conceivable,  its  exact  nature  is  still 
unknown in the literature. We suggest in the 
present  study  that  benevolence  intervenes  as 
moderator variable in the relationship between 
competence and reputation. In other words, 
benevolent  behaviours  of  service  workers 
should be valorized in order to reinforce their 
competence. From this perspective, the inter-
dependence  between  these  two  constructs 
should be explored for a better understanding 
of the role of contact personnel in the forma-
tion of corporate reputation.     

 METHODS  

 The Model 
 We  propose  to  assess  at  the  aggregate  level 
the main effects of competence and benevo-
lence as well as the inﬂ uence of their interac-
tion  on  corporate  reputation,  following  the 
procedure proposed by  Taylor (1997) , based 
on the hierarchical multiple regressions with 
interaction.  This  procedure  seeks  to  detect 
the presence of potential higher order terms 
and, if need be, to include them in the regres-
sion  model.   Taylor  (1997:  173)   has  under-
lined that  ‘ failing to capture true higher order 
and / or  interaction  effects  can  lead  to  prob-
lems  associated  with  interpreting  regression 
coefﬁ cients,  particularly 
importance 
weights ’ .  In  the  context  of  the  current 
research, the regression model relating com-
petence  and  benevolence  as  independent 
variables to corporate reputation as dependent 
variable takes the form of the equation (1):

 The advantage of the use of the equation (1) 
relies on its ability to compare the interac-
tion  effect  with  the  main  effects.  Due  to 
multiple levels of aggregation of competence 
and  benevolence,  the  interactions  between 
the  two  constructs  might  explain  further 
corporate reputation. As has been suggested 
by  a  number  of  authors  ( Aiken  and  West, 
1991 ;  Taylor and Baker, 1994 ), the analysis 
procedure  employed  here  consists  of  esti-
mating  various  regression  equations  and 
evaluating  the  change  in  the  coefﬁ cient  of 
determination ( R  2 ) in a hierarchical manner 
conforming  to  the  apparition  order  of  the 
independent  variables  as  speciﬁ ed  in  the 
equation  (1).  As  the  independent  variables 
may be closely related, the centred data have 
been used to attenuate the error caused by 
the  potential  problem  of  multicollinearity 
( Aiken and West, 1991 ;  Cronbach, 1987 ).   

rely  on  both  its  decisions  and  those  made 
by  the  federation  as  a  network  ( Post  and 
Grifﬁ n,  1997 ).  The  questionnaires  were 
mailed to a random sample of 1,650 members 
of  ﬁ ve  credit  unions  chosen  for  this  study 
following  two  criteria,  size  and  type  of 
market (urban or rural). Questionnaires were 
accompanied  by  an  explanatory  note  with 
the  signature  of  the  general  manager  of 
the credit union. Within a three-week time 
frame,  a  total  of  452  questionnaires  were 
returned and distributed as follows: 445 com-
pleted  usable  and  seven  uncompleted.  The 
response rate was approximately 27 percent. 
As  shown  in   Table  1 ,  the  majority  of  the 
sample may be described as females (62 per-
cent),  45-years-old  or  more  (68  percent), 
persons having high school degree or more 
(58 percent) and visiting the credit union at 
least once a month (93 percent).   

 The Sample 
 The data were collected in the ﬁ nancial serv-
ice sector, speciﬁ cally in a number of credit 
unions serving mostly the French population 
in the province of New Brunswick, Canada. 
Thirty-four Acadian credit unions, grouped 
together in a federation, are major ﬁ nancial 
institutions  located  in  the  principal  cities, 
and  they  rank  amongst  the  top  ﬁ ve  in  the 
chosen  areas.  In  2007,  this  federation  had 
over  200,000  members  and  its  assets  were 
established at 2.5 bn dollars. It is worth not-
ing that the reputation of a credit union may 

 The Measurement 
 To  put  into  operation  the  three  constructs 
of competence, benevolence and corporate 
reputation as presented in the equation (1), 
we  propose  to  use  direct  measures  in  the 
absence  of  a  consensus  on  the  valid  scales 
for  these  constructs.  First,  four  items  were 
used  for  the  measurement  of  competence: 
namely,  the  dependability  and  judicious 
advices of employees, their expertize, their 
honesty  and  their  promptness  of  service. 
Second, ﬁ ve items were chosen to describe 
the  components  of  benevolence.  Of  these

are  three  items  for  altruistic  benevolence: 
namely,  the  attentiveness  to  clients  regard-
less  of  their  standing,  the  emphasis  on  the 
client ’ s well-being rather than the organiza-
tion ’ s ﬁ nancial performance and the service 
delivery  oriented  to  client ’ s  needs  rather 
than  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  exigencies.  The  remaining 
two  items  are  for  mutualistic  benevolence: 
namely, client satisfaction in order to main-
tain his / her loyalty and problem solving in 
order to assure gain for both client and or-
ganization. Finally, ﬁ ve items were selected 
for  corporate 
the 
organization ’ s capacity to fulﬁ l its promises, 
the  global  evaluation  of  its  reputation,  its 
reputation  in  comparison  to  other  compa-
nies,  its  efforts  deployed  to  protect  the 
environment and the fairness of its decisions 
and  actions.  These  direct  measures  are  not 
made  up  by  intrinsic  descriptors  of  the 

reputation:  namely, 

constructs.  However,  the  advantage  of  the 
approach taken in this study lies in the uti-
lization  of  indices  formed  from  multiple 
indicators  that  are  summed  and  averaged 
rather than the single-item measures. All of 
the  aforementioned  constructs  were  meas-
ured  with  the  use  of  a  seven-point  Likert-
type  agreement  scale  with  the  anchors  of 
strongly disagree (1) and strongly agree (7). 
The  items  used  for  competence,  benevo-
lence and corporate reputation are present-
ed in the Appendix. The correlation matrix 
of these items obtained from the data is pre-
sented in  Table 2 . The purpose of the cor-
relation  analysis  is  to  assess  the  convergent 
validity  of  three  indices  representing  com-
petence, benevolence and corporate reputa-
tion. As shown in  Table 2 , the coefﬁ cients 
of  correlation  within  indices  (varying  from 
0.538  to  0.759)  are  generally  greater  than 
those  between  indices  (varying  from  0.411 
to  0.595).  Moreover,   Table  3   reveals  that 
the coefﬁ cients of correlation between each 
index  and  its  measures  are  quite  high  and 
the  reliability  of  these  measures  is  also 
adequate  according  to   Nunnally’s   rule  of 
interpretation (1978), with coefﬁ cients alpha 
varying from 0.882 to 0.896.    

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Following 
the  procedure  suggested  by 
 Taylor (1997) , we initially have to identify 
the  (linear  or  curvilinear)  nature  of  the 
relationship between the dependent variable 
(corporate reputation) and two independent 
variables  (competence  and  benevolence). 
The  results  reported  in   Table  4   show  that 
all higher order relationships (quadratic and 
cubic  terms)  are  not  statistically  signiﬁ cant. 
In the light of these results, the appropriate 
form of the equation (1) for further analysis 
will be as follows:

 The  results  of  the  hierarchical  multiple 
regression analysis and the variance inﬂ ation 
factor  (VIF)  values  estimated  for  various 
models are presented in  Table 5 . 

 These  results  reveal  that  the  regression 
coefﬁ cients  representing  the  main  effect  of 
competence  and  benevolence  on  the  per-
ception of corporate reputation are strongly 
signiﬁ cant. As can be observed, the impact 
of  benevolence  on  corporate  reputation  is 
slightly  stronger  than  competence  (coefﬁ -
cient  beta  (  ♢  )  of  BENE    =    0.499  comparing 
to   ♢   of COMP    =    0.466 in model 3 in  Table 5 ).

tion term is also statistically signiﬁ cant, but

interaction term found in the service sector 
tested  is  worth  noting  given  the  difﬁ culty 
to  detect  statistically  reliable  interactions  as 
reported  by  numerous  researchers  in  the 
ﬁ eld  ( McClelland  and  Judd,  1993 ;   Taylor 
and Baker, 1994 ). Consequently, the results 
conﬁ rm as proposed previously that benev-
olence intervenes as a moderator variable to 
enhance the impact of competence on cor-
porate  reputation.  In  our  opinion,  compe-
tence  is  a  technical  component  of  the 
capability  of  contact  personnel  to  conduct 
the  transaction  requested  by  the  client. 
Generally,  competence  involves  the  use  of 
appropriate and effective infrastructure, pro-
tocols, standards, techniques and procedures 
in  order  to  guarantee  the  success  of  the 
transaction  ( Papadopoulou   et  al. ,  2003 ). 
Benevolence may be viewed as a function-
al  component  of  this  capability.  It  reveals 
the manner that guides front-line employees 
in conducting the transaction. Benevolence 
means 
the 
welfare  of  the  client  and  are  motivated  to 

that  employees  care  about

act,   therefore,  in  his  or  her  interest.  The 
results of the present study suggest that not 
only  does  competence  have  the  expected 
positive  effect  on  corporate  reputation, 
but  also  that  the  effect  is  even  stronger 
when  benevolence  is  higher  (coefﬁ cient    ♢   
  ♢    of 
of  COMP    =    0.430  comparing  to 
COMP    =    0.466, when   ♢   of BENE increases 
from  0.474  to  0.499  in  the  presence  of 
COMP * BENE, in models 2 and 3 in  Table 5 ). 
As the regression coefﬁ cient for the interac-
tion term is positive, this indicates that the 
perception of corporate reputation has a ten-
dency  to  be  higher  as  the  perceptions  of 
both  competence  and  benevolence  are 
strongly favourable. The results presented in 
 Table  5   also  reveal  that  the  change  in  the 
coefﬁ cient of determination ( ♅  R  2 ) is statisti-
cally signiﬁ cant in the presence of the inter-
action  term  ( ♅  R  2 2   
from 
models 2 to 3 in  Table 5 ). 

is  signiﬁ cant 

 Several potential limitations of this study 
should  be  noted  before  discussing  the 
research and managerial implications. First and 
foremost, the efﬁ cacy of the direct measures 
used to assess competence, benevolence and 

corporate  reputation  must  be  considered 
( Peterson and Wilson, 1992 ). The reliability 
and, especially, the validity of the measures 
in  this  study  are  not  as  strongly  conclusive 
as  expected.  However,  at  this  stage,  the 
identiﬁ cation of the indicators that best rep-
resent  these  constructs  continues  to  chal-
lenge  researchers  in  the  ﬁ eld.  Second,  the 
hierarchical  multiple 
regression  analysis 
adopted  in  this  study  is  not  necessarily 
superior to other methods for investigating 
potential  higher-order  and / or  interactive 
effects  ( Jaccard   et  al. ,  1990 ;   Taylor,  1997 ). 
For  example,  structure  equation  modelling 
is  a  prominent  alternative  method.  How-
ever,  this  complex  technique   ‘    …   has  no 
omniscient  powers  and  cannot  greatly  aid 
researchers in making subtle distinctions be-
tween  highly  related  constructs ’   ( Iacobucci 
 et  al. ,  1994:  50 ).  Third,  the  variations  in 
the value of the coefﬁ cient of determination 
regarding  the  interaction  term  are  statisti-
cally  signiﬁ cant  but  relatively  weak.  This 
may also result in a limitation of the contri-
bution of the current study. Finally, the data 
were collected from a convenient sample of

consumers.  As  such,  the  study  does  not 
allow  for  the  generalization  of  the  ﬁ ndings 
across the services industry or even for the 
studied sector.   

 IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION 
 The  present  research  contributes  to  the 
body  of  knowledge  by  examining  the  role 
of contact personnel in the formation of cor-
porate  reputation.  The  results  presented  in 
the  previous  section  conﬁ rm  the  contribu-
tion  of  competence  and  benevolence  to 
enhancing corporate reputation, as reported 
in the literature ( Doney and Cannon, 1997 ; 
 Johnson  and  Grayson,  2003 ;   Sirdeshmukh 
 et  al. ,  2002 ).  Indeed,  these  are  two  major 
attributes  of  service  employees  likely  to 
assure  the  success  of  the  service  delivery 
process, all the more so since their interactive 
effect on corporate reputation is signiﬁ cant. 
 Regarding  managerial  implications,  these 
results suggest that managers of service ﬁ rms 
should not consider exclusively competence 
in their human resources planning. Compe-
tence as expertize gained from training should 
be combined with benevolence as behaviour 
derived  from  ethics  and  morality  to  maxi-
mize the performance of contact personnel, 
and consequently, to enhance corporate rep-
utation. In service industries, the association 
between  corporate  reputation  and  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
offering  is  much  more  difﬁ cult  to  isolate 
because  of  the  intangibility  of  the  service. 
From  this  perspective,  service  ﬁ rms  should 
employ arguments based on contact employ-
ees as predominant tangible elements in order 
to inﬂ uence the consumer ’ s perceptions and 
behaviour,  the  hope  being  that,  in  the  eyes 
of  the  consumer,  these  elements  constitute 
the beneﬁ ts promised in the service transac-
tion. For example, an airline company would 
emphasize its ﬂ ight attendants as service qual-
ity  indices  in  a  strategy  to  create  favourable 
perceptions toward the company. 

 For  competence,  its  key  components 
namely  technical  expertize  and  problem-
solving  skill  should  be  implemented  in

every activity ﬁ eld of the service ﬁ rm, par-
ticularly during the service encounter in the 
presence of consumers. Moreover, the com-
pany-wide competence implementation has 
to focus on innovation and creativity applied 
to the service offering and the delivery proc-
ess  for  continuous  improvement  of  service 
quality, and consequently, the enhancement 
of  corporate  reputation.  Innovation  and 
creativity  are  two  effective  indicators  of  a 
service  ﬁ rm ’ s  capacity  to  adapt  to  changes 
in the market. For benevolence, it is crucial 
for service ﬁ rms to put into practice ethical 
guides for contact personnel. In considering 
ethical elements, contact personnel are more 
sensitive  about  the  consequences  of  their 
decisions  and  actions  regarding  clients.  At 
ﬁ rst,  contact  personnel  should  be  aware  of 
the importance of benevolent behaviours in 
building corporate reputation and long-term 
relationships  with  clients.  This  awareness 
will  help  them  to  detect  and  anticipate 
 potential  conﬂ icts  which  can  harm  the 
 efforts  to  enhance  marketing  relationship. 
 Benevolence can be emphasized in different 
phases  of  client – business  relationships.  For 
example,   Lee   et  al.   (2004)   suggest  that 
service  ﬁ rms  should  focus  on  mutualistic 
benevolence  in  newer  relationships,  since 
in  the  early  stages  the  interests  tend  to 
be  mostly  economic.  According  to  these 

authors, altruistic benevolence is more app-
ropriate  in  mature  relationships  which  are 
based on affective commitment. 

 The lack of evidence and research on the 
causal relationship between competence and 
benevolence initiated this exploratory study 
on the interaction between competence and 
benevolence in a service setting. The results 
show a signiﬁ cant relationship between the 
two  concepts  and  should  encourage  us  to 
pursue additional studies in order to deter-
mine  the  exact  nature  of  this  relationship. 
Furthermore,  it  would  be  interesting  to 
understand  the  impact  of  competence  and 
benevolence on consumers ’  attitudes toward 
the service worker, which in turn inﬂ uence 
the overall corporate reputation.
