Introduction

Environmental sustainability is driving ﬁrms to extend their green effort across their supply chain.
However, the literature has not thoroughly examined the multiple relationships among supply chain
(SC) strategy, corporate environmental (CE) strategy, and ﬁrm performance. As such, this paper, adopts
an alignment perspective to empirically examine the complex links between four SC strategies and four
CE strategies on 172 manufacturing ﬁrms in Taiwan. Using proﬁle deviation analysis, it is found that
overall an SC strategy when properly aligned with a CE strategy leads to improved ﬁrm performance.
Speciﬁcally, a risk-hedging SC strategy should be aligned with a defensive CE strategy to yield improved
ﬁrm performance. Likewise, a responsive SC strategy should be aligned with an accommodative CE
strategy, and an agile SC strategy with a proactive CE strategy.

Environmental sustainability drives ﬁrms to not only develop
corporate environmental proactivity but also to move toward
green/sustainable supply chain management (Aragon-Correa and
Rubio-Lo´ pez, 2007; Seuring and M ¨uller, 2008). Already, ﬁrms
have adopted environmental friendly practices such as environ-
mental purchasing (Green et al., 1996), green supply (Bowen
et al., 2001), green supply chain management (GSCM) (Zhu and
Sarkis, 2004), and sustainable logistics strategies (Kumar and
Putnam, 2008).

Research (Carter and Rogers, 2008; Molina-Azorı´n et al., 2009)
suggests that proactive green initiatives yield competitiveness,
economic beneﬁts, better corporate social responsibility, and
sustainability. However, the implementation of environmental
management involves numerous actors in the supply chain,
which may lead to managerial challenges related to broader
organizational complexities (Vachon and Klassen, 2008), high
transaction costs, supply risk, and effective control over suppliers
and implementation (Simpson and Power, 2005). These different
outcomes could be due to the fact that sustainability broadens
supply chain management to a wider and integrated perspective
rather than a uni-dimensional and dichotomous view (Linton
et al., 2007; Seuring and M ¨uller, 2008).

According to Linton et al. (2007), sustainability changes exist-
ing practices and creates new production and management
systems. As such, it is difﬁcult for ﬁrms to achieve a balance
between the traditional efﬁciency based performance and envir-
onmental beneﬁts, which in turn inﬂuences green management at
the business and functional
levels (Handﬁeld et al., 2005;
Mollenkopf et al., 2010). To mitigate the environmental risks
arising from supply chain uncertainties and other issues, new
analytical tools, performance metrics, and frameworks to are
needed address the environmental issues in the supply chain
(Fabbe-Costes et al., 2011; Handﬁeld et al., 2005; Simpson and
Power, 2005). However reengineering the supply chain under
such a complex and uncertain context is a challenge. Bielak et al.
(2007), in a survey of 391 CEOs, report that competing strategic
priorities and the lack of recognition from ﬁnancial markets
are the main impediments when implementing integrated
approaches to sustainability. They also indicate that it is difﬁcult
to manage a sustainable supply chain operating under different
national regulations and social norms. Thus, two research ques-
tions arise: (1) what is the effective management of the multiple
relationships between supply chain management and the envir-
onment, and (2) how does the deviation of the strategies from the
ideal affect the overall ﬁrm performance.

Mollenkopf et al. (2010) urge that research should address how
ﬁrms could implement green,
lean, and global supply chain
strategies concurrently to provide effective decision making across
the supply chain. Further, Monczka and Petersen (2012) suggest
that environmentally sustainable supply chain management is an
integrated strategy which must align closely with and support

business strategy in response to a changing marketplace. In the
context of aligning goals for both efﬁciency and the environment, it
is critical for ﬁrms to understand the unique needs of each strategy,
and develop new capabilities to strategically integrate sustainabil-
ity into the Supply Chain (SC) strategy and effectively manage the
complex relations underlying these two strategies. Accordingly,
this study adopts an alignment or ﬁt perspective to examine the
relationships between SC strategy and corporate environmental
(CE) strategy, and the inﬂuence of the degree of alignment of these
two strategies on performance enhancement.

Already, a signiﬁcant amount of strategic alignment studies
exists in the environmental management and green supply chain
management literature. For instance, based on both moderation
and mediation models, organizational factors and business cir-
cumstances are employed in discussing the environmental-
performance linkage, e.g. industrial growth (Russo and Fouts,
1997), complementary assets (Christmann, 2000), business cir-
cumstances (Gonza´ lez-Benito and Gonza´ lez-Benito, 2005), and
ﬁrm resources (Lo´ pez-Gamero et al., 2009). Further, research (e.g.
Kocabasoglu et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2012; Zhu and Sarkis, 2004)
has identiﬁed that factors such as production principles, will-
ingness to take risk, and institutional pressures have moderating
effects on green/reverse supply chain management. In contrast,
some studies suggest that environmental practices have mediated
impacts on green supply and manufacturing competitiveness (e.g.
Bowen et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2010). Nevertheless, these studies
mostly examine the relationships among the variables using the
reductionist approach, which may not fully explain the interde-
pendencies among the research constructs (Umanath, 2003).
Besides, there is a dearth of research on the alignment effects of
supply chain uncertainty and environmental strategy selection.
Our paper borrows from the IS literature and adopts the proﬁle
deviation approach (Venkatraman, 1989). In this approach, align-
ment is conceptualized as the adherence to an external proﬁle of
an ideal type. In short, an ideal alignment scenario is deduced
from theory and the deviations from this ideal state (usually
measured empirically) are computed for further analysis.

This paper makes the following contributions. First, we adopt a
novel methodological innovation as proﬁle deviation analysis is
relatively new to the environmental and supply chain ﬁeld (Chen
et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2009). Second, this study empirically
examines the alignment impact of SC strategy and CE strategy on
ﬁrm performance. Alignment in this study suggests that a ﬁrm’s
choice of a CE strategy ﬁts its SC strategy. Greater alignment is
viewed as a highly internal consistency of the activities that
implement the numerous attributes of SC and CE strategies. From
a managerial perspective, the alignment concept provides ﬁrms
with a useful and systematic tool for considering SC and CE
strategies simultaneously and then making holistic decisions
within the ﬁrm and across the supply chain. Combined, an
alignment of two distinct strategy streams under a proﬁle devia-
tion approach allows for effective decision making on environ-
mental resource allocation in a supply chain context. This is
unique to the ﬁeld and is consistent with the multi-dimensional
and holistic perspective of sustainable supply chain management.
Thus, a high degree of adherence to the ideal proﬁles of SC and CE
strategies improves ﬁrm performance. The third contribution is to
provide a research agenda that systematically addresses SC and
CE strategies to explain the possible beneﬁts on performance. In
doing so, this paper contributes to the literature by providing a
uniﬁed theoretical lens to examine the complex network relation-
ships and interactions of the different domains related to supply
chain, sustainability, strategy, and performance. This will lend
new insights into the theory and practice of SC and CE strategies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 ﬁrst
provides the theoretical background on the alignment concept

and the ideal proﬁles of the SC and CE strategies, and then
introduces the research model and hypotheses. Section 3
describes the research method, followed by a presentation of
the results in Section 4. Section 5 provides a discussion of the
ﬁndings, implications, and limitations and some directions for
future research.

2. Theoretial background and hypotheses

We ﬁrst discuss the alignment concept, the four ideal proﬁles
for SC strategy, and the four ideal proﬁles for CE strategy, and
then develop the research hypotheses.

2.1. Alignment concept

According to Nadler and Tushman (1980), alignment is the
adjustment of one component in relation to another component so
that the arrangement leads to an optimal consequence of the
relationship between the components. Kaplan and Norton (2006)
deﬁne strategic alignment as the internal consistency of the activ-
ities that implement the different attributes of strategy. The concept
of alignment or ﬁt is essential in a process of change in strategy
formulation. As suggested by Miles and Snow (1984:12),
‘‘the
process of achieving ﬁt begins, conceptually at least, by aligning
the company to its marketplace y this process of alignment deﬁnes
the company’s strategy.’’ Moreover, Venkatraman (1989) identiﬁes
six perspectives of alignment: moderation, mediation, matching,
gestalt, proﬁle deviation, and covariation. So far, only the modera-
tion and mediation models are commonly used in the environmen-
tal and supply chain management research.

Though conceptualized in the context of strategy research, the
alignment concept is also applicable to other disciplines. For
instance, the environmental management literature provides the
implications of the selection and interaction approaches in
examining the relationship between environmental practices
and performance (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Gonza´ lez-Benito and
Gonza´ lez-Benito, 2005; Lo´ pez-Gamero et al., 2009). Also, there are
some studies which address alignment under the mediated and
moderated perspectives in the context of green/reverse supply
chain management (Bowen et al., 2001; Kocabasoglu et al., 2007;
Wu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2010; Zhu and Sarkis, 2004). These
papers however examine alignment from a bivariate rather than
from a holistic perspective.

Alignment is the underlying conceptual theme for this study.
Speciﬁcally, this study uses alignment under a proﬁle deviation
perspective to examine the links between the SC and CE strate-
gies. Proﬁle deviation is deﬁned as the internal consistency of
multiple contingencies (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985). The higher
the degree of adherence to an ideal multidimensional proﬁle the
better the performance. Deviations from this proﬁle will result in
negative performance (Venkatraman, 1989). Thus, the basic idea
is that the SC and CE strategies should be aligned to enhance ﬁrm
performance (e.g. Sabherwal and Chan, 2001). Following Lee
(2002), this study applies four SC strategies types under two SC
uncertainty attributes, and four CE strategies types under three
environmental management attributes.

2.2. SC strategy ideal proﬁles

Given the concept of match between the type of product and
the type of supply chain, Fisher (1997) categorizes supply chains
as either efﬁcient or responsive. Alternatively, lean and agile
supply chains are used (e.g. Mason-Jones et al., 2000), with lean
supply chains being physically efﬁcient, and agile supply chains
being responsive. Further, through the supply chain uncertainty


222

landscape, Lee (2002) classiﬁes supply chains strategies as efﬁ-
cient, risk-hedging, responsive, and agile. We will use this
taxonomy.

Following Lee (2002), this study adopts demand and supply
uncertainties as the attributes to categorize the SC strategies.
The demand uncertainty attribute is the unpredictability of the
demand for a product, due to the quantity demanded, and
product variety (Christopher and Towill, 2000; Fisher, 1997; Lee,
2002). The supply uncertainty attribute refers to characteristics of
the procurement process and possesses a number of sub-
attributes including quality, buying, and delivery. We follow
Lee’s (2002, p. 114) classiﬁcation (High/Low) to help identify
the two attributes of each ideal SC strategy proﬁle as shown in
Table 1.

Functional products usually have predictable demand, long
product life cycles and lower proﬁt margins (Fisher, 1997). Thus,
ﬁrms handling such products require lower levels of capability
response to rapid design changes and volume swings. As these
products yield lower margins, such ﬁrms require a higher priority
on cost efﬁciency. Further, due to automation and efﬁcient
sourcing processes, the supply base is well established (Lee,
2002). An efﬁcient SC strategy is thus low on demand uncertainty
and supply uncertainty.

Next, ﬁrms that employ a risk-hedging SC strategy typically
hedge against supplier uncertainty. These ﬁrms face challenges
related to the process reliability, supply base, and long lead-time
from source to production, even though they produce functional
products (Lee, 2002). Hence, a ﬁrm employing a risk-hedging SC
strategy is high on supply uncertainty, but low on demand
uncertainty.

The very nature of innovative products makes demand unpre-
dictable, shortens their life cycles, albeit provides higher proﬁt
margins (Fisher, 1997). Firms that deploy a responsive SC strategy
aim at being ﬂexible to the changing and diverse needs of the
market, reﬂecting a moderate degree of price and service con-
sciousness (Mason-Jones et al., 2000). Such ﬁrms are oriented
toward improving quality, delivery, modular design, and relia-
bility performance. These improvements are beneﬁcial to a SC
strategy with innovative products while being reliable and have a
stable supply base (Lee, 2002). A responsive SC strategy thus
views the demand attribute as having high uncertainty but low
uncertainty for the supply attribute.

There are also cases where high levels of ﬂexibility and
responsiveness to the marketplace are needed (Fisher, 1997;
Mason-Jones et al., 2000). As an agile supply chain has an evolving
process where the customer demands are still unstable and
suppliers are unreliable and limited, such ﬁrms emphasize their
resources and capabilities on quality, delivery dependability, and
after-sales service (Lee, 2002; Mason-Jones et al., 2000). Hence,
ﬁrms with an agile SC strategy view both SC attributes as having
high uncertainty.

2.3. CE strategy ideal proﬁles

A CE strategy is deﬁned in terms of the extent in which an
organization is involved in a wide range of organizational and
managerial actions on environmental issues (Argon-Correa et al.,

Table 1
Ideal proﬁles of SC strategy.
Source: Derived from Lee (2002, p. 114).

2004; Sharma, 2000), and is categorized into different types and
levels based on the endogenous and exogenous forces exerted on
it (Argon-Correa et al., 2008; Banerjee, 2001b; Vastag et al., 1996)
For ease of ﬁt, for the CE strategies in this paper, we adopt
Henriques and Sadorsky’s (1999) strategy classiﬁcation: reactive,
defensive, accommodative, and proactive.

Drawing from the literature, we use resources and capabilities,
social responsibility, and stakeholder management as the attri-
butes of the four CE strategy conﬁgurations. Resources and
capabilities imply that a ﬁrm’s resources and capabilities facilitate
economic and sustainable beneﬁts (Hart, 1995). Social responsi-
bility denotes the level of management commitment to society
and the environment (Argon-Correa et al., 2004; Sharma, 2000).
Stakeholder management emphasizes that the role of managing a
ﬁrm’s stakeholders is highly associated with effective environ-
mental management (Delmas and Toffel, 2004; Henriques and
Sadorsky, 1999). We follow Sabherwal and Chan’s (2001) sugges-
tion in using a parsimonious three-point scale (low, medium, and
high) to identify the three attributes of each ideal CE strategy
proﬁle as shown in Table 2.

Under a reactive CE strategy, ﬁrms commit minimal resources
to environmental management and employee training (Henriques
and Sadorsky, 1999; Klassen and Whybark, 1999), on what they
view as unimportant environmental issues (Argon-Correa et al.,
2004; Sharma, 2000). Monitoring compliance is carried out at the
middle management level (Vastag et al., 1996). Some institutional
forces however affect a reactive CE strategy. For instance, a media
stakeholder can persuade a ﬁrm to rethink that strategy
(Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999) and focus more on environmen-
tal legislations (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). We therefore view
ﬁrms that employ a reactive CE strategy as being low, low, and
medium on resources and capabilities, social responsibility, and
stakeholder management, respectively.

Firms using a defensive CE strategy tend to commit more
resources to environmental issues than ﬁrms on a reactive CE
strategy (Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999). They may apply reg-
ulatory approaches but lend little development to modern environ-
mental practices (Argon-Correa, 1998). These ﬁrms view environ-
mental issues as threats rather than opportunities (Sharma, 2000)
and admit only minor social responsibility (Argon-Correa et al.,
2004). As for the institutional forces, a ﬁrm’s actions is conditioned
by the regulatory, secondary, and internal primary stakeholders
(Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). This study thus proposes a defensive CE
strategy as being medium on resources and capabilities and social
responsibility, but high on stakeholder management, respectively.

The degree to which ﬁrms with an accommodative CE strategy
interpret environmental issues as opportunities is greater than
those with a reactive CE strategy (Sharma, 2000). Also, such ﬁrms
perceive relatively higher pressure from all their stakeholders
(Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). As such, these ﬁrms will develop
green capabilities and adopt pollution prevention technologies for
better ﬁrm performance (Argon-Correa et al., 2004; Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003; Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999) but they have yet
to adopt a proactive attitude to the environment (Molina-Azorı´n
et al., 2009). Therefore, for a ﬁrm on an accommodative CE

strategy, resources and capabilities, and stakeholder management
are at a high level, while social responsibility is at a medium level.
Firms move towards environmental proactivity when perceiv-
ing a higher impact on both the internal and external constitu-
encies (Argon-Correa et al., 2004; Banerjee, 2001a, 2001b). Firms
on proactive CE strategies thus develop unique capabilities to
sustain competitiveness (Argon-Correa et al., 2008; Bowen et al.,
2001) which are viewed as being critical to a broader range of
stakeholders (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Henriques and Sadorsky,
1999). They view a CE strategy as being relevant to all divisions of
the ﬁrm (Molina-Azorı´n et al., 2009) and that strategy is well
deﬁned and highly articulated in company publications (Vastag
et al., 1996). This study thus views a proactive CE strategy as
being high on all three CE strategy attributes.

2.4. Research model and hypotheses

Fig. 1 summarizes the overall model for this study. An align-
ment under a proﬁle deviation approach is used to examine the
multiple relations between the SC and CE strategies. The hypoth-
esis development is discussed below.

Vastag et al. (1996) suggest that ﬁrms use advanced green
practices only when environmental performance is an essential
part of the business activity. Other studies also suggest that the
performance derived from an environmental strategy depends on
the economic fundamentals of the business. Schaltegger and
Synnestvedt (2002) indicate that the scope of environmental
concerns in the context of the overall ﬁrm’s activities is critical
in discussing the environment-performance link. Argon-Correa
and Sharma (2003) identify ten propositions that present the
contingency effects of a general business environment on such
connections. Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lo´ pez (2007) propose that
a CE strategy may be contingent on the business environment.
Simpson and Samson (2008) suggest the need to investigate the
traditional supply chain management focus when devising a
GSCM strategy. When alignment
is lacking, Monczka and
Petersen (2012) mention that supply management cannot sup-
port the business in response to socioeconomic pressures. Thus,
ﬁrms must align their SC and CE strategies in order to boost the
overall ﬁrm performance. We thus posit the ﬁrst hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1. The degree of alignment between the SC strategy and
CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance.

Under an efﬁcient SC strategy, the basis of competition is cost
efﬁciency and price (Lee, 2002; Mason-Jones et al., 2000). By
focusing on cost efﬁciency, a feasible approach is to integrate
environmental
issues into the operating decisions, providing

maximum environmental beneﬁts at minimum cost and under
limited uncertainty (Walley and Whitehead, 1994). Environmen-
tal certiﬁcations such as ISO14001 are likely to be adopted for the
efﬁcient supply chain (Corbett and Kirsch, 2001; King and Lenox,
2001). However, the relationship between ISO14001 and environ-
mental performance is not obvious (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-
Lo´ pez, 2007; Corbett and Kirsch, 2001) and such certiﬁcations
could be a reactive response to suppliers or customers in the
chain. Further, due to the low SC uncertainty, a ﬁrm’s environ-
mental risks including materials, technologies, and customers are
relatively less. Put simply, ﬁrms adopting environmental activ-
ities at the functional level will commit minimal resources to just
meet local/national regulations (Simpson and Samson, 2008). At
this point, a ﬁrm following an efﬁcient SC strategy will most likely
adopt a reactive environmental strategy (Vastag et al., 1996).
Hence, the level of alignment will be high and from Bergeron et al.
(2001), this will
impact ﬁrm performance. Thus, our second
hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2. The degree of alignment between efﬁcient SC strategy
and reactive CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance.

To reduce the upstream disruption risk, a risk-hedging SC
strategy will pool resources and information among the partners
of the supply chain (Lee, 2002) to counter the effects of high
supply side uncertainty. This is consistent with the research
(Mollenkopf et al., 2010; Vachon and Klassen, 2006) which points
out that a higher level of logistics integration is beneﬁcial to some
defensive environmental practices and monitoring. For instance,
Green et al. (1996) indicate that environmental purchasing is
easily diffused through close supplier partnerships, and Vachon
and Klassen (2008) suggest that upstream collaboration is closely
associated with superior process-based performance. From a
green perspective, environmental purchasing involves new sup-
plier assessment procedures and a deeper level of supplier
integration and development. This requires a ﬁrm on a defensive
CE stance to commit more effort and resources (Green et al.,
1996; Handﬁeld et al., 2005). Thus, a ﬁrm adopting a risk-hedging
SC strategy is likely to adopt a defensive CE strategy, yielding a
high level of alignment and again from Bergeron et al. (2001), this
will have a impact ﬁrm performance. We thus propose the third
hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3. The degree of alignment between risk-hedging SC
strategy and defensive CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance.

Following Gunasekaran et al. (2008), ﬁrms that employ a
responsive SC strategy see it as a competitive weapon in a
networked economy. Such ﬁrms will produce customized products

through virtual organizations and exchange the goods through
e-Commerce. In so doing, production is relatively leaner which in
turn brings about environmental beneﬁts such as source reduction
and lower emissions (King and Lenox, 2001). However, this may
require greater ﬁnancial and managerial commitment to produc-
tion changes, product redesign, and stakeholder management
(Hart, 1997; Pane Haden et al., 2009; Simpson and Samson,
2008). In short, ﬁrms on an accommodative CE strategy are likely
to embrace accommodative practices such as product stewardship,
green marketing and/or cleaner technologies, resulting in spillover
effects including resource productivity, new competitive posture,
and manufacturing improvement
(Hart, 1997; Simpson and
Samson, 2008). Hence, the degree of alignment between a respon-
sive SC strategy and an accommodative CE strategy will be high.
Thus, the improvement in competitiveness through the supply
chain and environmental management will lead to superior ﬁrm
performance. Accordingly, we present the fourth hypothesis:

Hypothesis 4. The degree of alignment between responsive SC
strategy and accommodative CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance.

Firms with an agile SC strategy are very sensitive to demand and
supply risks, and will use market knowledge for proﬁt and competi-
tiveness (Christopher and Towill, 2000; Lee, 2002; Mason-Jones et al.,
2000). These ﬁrms will strategically and proactively deal with
environmental issues, suggesting an opportunity-seeking behavior
rather than threat aversion (Argon-Correa, 1998). Such ﬁrms will
develop innovative capabilities to eliminate industry and environ-
mental risks to realize better resource productivity, higher proﬁts,
and sustained competitive advantage (Argon-Correa et al., 2008;
Christmann, 2000; Lo´ pez-Gamero et al., 2009). At the supply chain
level, a proactive CE strategy may facilitate proﬁtability, opera-
tion excellence, and sustainability for the partners in the chain
(Kleindorfer et al., 2005; Rao and Holt, 2005; Zhu and Sarkis, 2004).
Hence, the degree of alignment between an agile SC strategy and a
proactive CE strategy will be high, leading to better ﬁrm performance.
Thus, our next hypothesis is:

Hypothesis 5. The degree of alignment between agile SC strategy
and proactive CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance.

3. Research method

3.1. Sample and data collection

The research comes from export-oriented manufacturing ﬁrms
in Taiwan that have experienced sustainable corporate environ-
mental development prompted by their supply chain partners
and other green initiatives. This factor makes the sample selection
appropriate for testing our hypotheses. The sample is drawn from
the 2011 CommonWealth directory of the top 1000 Taiwan
manufacturers. The cover letter described the research goals
and instructions indicating that the survey respondents (senior
managers) should have a priori knowledge of the SC and CE
strategies of their ﬁrms. From October to December in 2011, the
questionnaires were distributed anonymously to the ﬁrms and
followed by reminders which indicated the survey due date. Of
the 230 questionnaires distributed, 178 were returned. Six were
eliminated due to missing data and 172 qualiﬁed questionnaires
were accounted for.

To check for non-response bias, we followed Armstrong and
Overton’s (1977) procedure and compared the answers of the
early survey respondents against those of the late respondents.
The test between the ﬁrst wave (n¼129, 75%) and the second
wave (n¼43, 25%) reveals no difference at a 5% signiﬁcance level
for geographic dispersion (w2 ¼2.290, df¼2, p¼0.318), employee
number (t¼0.743, p¼0.459), and annual revenue (t¼1.505,

p¼0.134). Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the respon-
dent ﬁrms. The responding ﬁrms were fairly evenly divided in
terms of geographical dispersion (measured as local, regional or
global) and the size of the ﬁrm. On average, the annual revenue
was USD 200 million.

3.2. Measurement

All items are operationalized based on related studies in the
environmental management and supply chain management lit-
erature. In all, 10 items were used for the demand and supply
uncertainty attributes, 14 items for the three CE strategy attri-
butes, and 7 performance items for revenue increase and cost
reduction. The CE strategy measures require that the ﬁrms
respond based on their current situation, whereas the question-
naires on both SC strategy and ﬁrm performance require an
evaluation of their condition against their competitors. All items
are measured on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (1¼strongly disagree,
5¼strongly agree). The measures and their related literature are
summarized in Tables 4–6.

This study uses two control variables: (1) geographic disper-
sion, and (2) number of employees as ﬁrm size. Prior studies
suggest that the regulatory situation in different countries and
their societal pressures and ﬁrm size affect the selection of
environmental strategies and supply chain management (Ambec
and Lanoie, 2008; Argon-Correa et al., 2008; Fabbe-Costes et al.,
2011; Molina-Azorı´n et al., 2009). In particular, larger ﬁrms are
more likely to adopt proactive CE strategies (Russo and Fouts,
1997; Sharma, 2000). Hence, we take geographic dispersion as a
proxy for the regulatory and societal pressures, and the number of
employees as a proxy for ﬁrm size, respectively.

3.3. Reliability and validity testing

We used SPSS ver 20.0 to assess how well behaved the
observed variable were in terms of composite reliability, con-
vergent validity, and discriminant validity. As shown through
Tables 4–6, the composite reliabilities of all the factors exceeded
0.860, well above the threshold value of 0.7 (Gefen et al., 2000),
indicating the existence of internal consistency. The test for
convergent validity shows that all indicators load satisfactorily
on the theorized constructs and the t-tests of all the loadings are
at the po0.001 level, providing evidence of convergent validity
(Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). Only two items were middling between
0.6 and 0.7, which is acceptable for an exploratory study of this
nature. Next, we tested for satisfactory discriminant validity of

category. Table 7 presents the mean, standard deviation, the

This study adopts Sabherwal and Chan (2001)’s process to
compute the level of alignment. This method, as discussed earlier,
is a holistic view of the parsimonious and relatively homogeneous

groups and assesses the alignment between two multivariate
constructs. All the items of the SC and CE strategies are used to
compute the level of alignment through proﬁle deviation analysis.
Thus, this study does not use CFA analysis to test for model-ﬁt.

analytic procedure to compute the level of alignment, we perform

a hierarchical regression on SPSS ver 20.0 to evaluate the level of
alignment between the SC and CE strategies on ﬁrm performance.

4.1. Alignment analytic process

First, we compute the values of both the demand and supply
uncertainty variables of the 172 observations and then compare
each observation to the sample mean values of the demand and
supply uncertainty measures. If the demand uncertainty value of
an observation is greater than the mean value of the sample, then
we regard this observation with a high demand uncertainty. The
same classiﬁcation method is employed on the supply uncertainty
attribute. Based on the supply chain uncertainty attributes of
Table 1, each respondent ﬁrm is classiﬁed into one of four SC
strategies, namely: efﬁcient, risk-hedging, responsive, and agile.
Using this alignment analytic process, 69, 34, 30, and 39 of the
respondent ﬁrms are categorized as having efﬁcient, risk-hedging,
responsive and agile SC strategies, respectively.

The second step is the normalization of all variables of the
three CE strategy attributes. By using the z-score, we determine
the relative location of the observation in a data set and the
standardized scores are used for the remaining data analysis. This
data standardization (mean centred with value of 0 and standard
deviation of 1) removes the effects of different measurement
units and potential multi-collinearity (Jaccard and Turrisi, 2003).
Third, the proﬁle deviation, a measure of the misalignment
between each ﬁrm’s CE strategy and its ideal CE strategy proﬁle, is
computed. This step comprises three tasks. The ﬁrst task is to

determine the ideal CE strategy proﬁle in terms of the three CE
attributes (see Table 2). The ideal CE attribute values of the
normalized scores were set to 1, 0, and  1 for high, medium,
and low, respectively. The second task is to compute the Euclidean
distance between each ﬁrm’s CE strategy and its ideal CE strategy
proﬁle for a speciﬁc SC strategy adopted by a respondent ﬁrm. In
short, if a ﬁrm is classiﬁed as having an efﬁcient SC, the distance
(misalignment) is computed for a reactive CE strategy as follows:
Misalignment (reactive)¼OS(Xj  Ij, reactive)2 where Xj is the normal-
ized score for the jth CE strategy attribute, Ij, reactive is the ideal
normalized score of that jth CE strategy attribute, with j ¼1, 2 3 for
the three CE attributes. A reactive CE strategy is expected to be best
aligned with an efﬁcient SC strategy. The same is done for the ideal
CE strategy proﬁles of the other CE strategies. A respondent ﬁrm
with a smaller Euclidean distance indicates that its CE strategy is
closer to the ideal proﬁle and that the degree of alignment is
higher. The third task is to subtract the chosen CE strategy distance
from 1, which helps convert it into a measure of alignment.

4.2. Results

regression model

We then perform a hierarchical regression to test the statistical
signiﬁcance of the proﬁle deviation values and the hypotheses. The
dependent variable is ﬁrm performance as measured by revenue
increase and cost reduction. Table 8 shows the regression results of
the alignment effects of the SC and CE strategies on ﬁrm perfor-
mance. The VIF values in all the regression models (1.000 to 1.466)
were all below 5, eliminating the likelihood of multi-collinearity.
Alignment is found to be signiﬁcantly associated with ﬁrm
performance in terms of revenue increase and cost reduction for
(R2¼0.127, F¼9.269, pr0.001;
the overall
R2¼0.105, F¼7.683, pr0.001, respectively). Hence, Hypothesis H1
is strongly supported i.e. the degree of alignment between the SC
strategy and the CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance. Thus, ﬁrms
should strive for better alignment between these two sets of
strategies so as to maximize their performance. Likewise, Hypothesis
H3 is supported i.e. the degree of alignment between a risk-hedging
SC strategy and a defensive CE strategy impacts ﬁrm performance
through revenue increase and cost reduction (R2¼0.339, F¼6.632,
pr0.001; R2¼0.236, F¼4.392, pr0.05, respectively). For Hypothesis
H4, a similar results holds i.e. the level of alignment between a
responsive SC strategy and an accommodative CE strategy impacts
ﬁrm performance partially through revenue increase and signiﬁcantly


T. Wu et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 147 (2014) 220–229

227

through cost reduction (R2¼0.240, F¼4.056, pr0.05; R2¼0.458,
F¼9.154, pr0.001, respectively). As for Hypothesis H5, the level of
alignment between an agile SC strategy and a proactive CE strategy
also impacts ﬁrm performance with the following results R2¼0.395,
F¼9.255, pr0.001; R2¼0.343, F¼7.600, pr0.001, respectively. The
control variable, geographic dispersion does not appear to lend any
statistical weight to the regression models, negating the results of
earlier studies (e.g. Fabbe-Costes et al., 2011).

5. Discussion and conclusion

This study employs an alignment analytic process using proﬁle
deviation analysis to examine the relationship between SC strategy
and CE strategy, and speciﬁcally the alignment effects on ﬁrm
performance in terms of revenue increase and cost reduction. As
shown in Table 8, except for the lack of statistical support on the
need for a good alignment between an efﬁcient SC strategy and a
reactive CE strategy, selecting a right CE strategy within the context
of a ﬁrm’s SC strategy results in better ﬁrm performance through
either revenue increase or cost reduction or both. Based on the
ﬁndings, some implications and contributions are discussed.

5.1. Discussion of results

Our results provide two main issues for discussion. First, the
alignment concept offers opportunities for ﬁrms to simultaneously
consider the organizational and strategy domains holistically
(Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985; Umanath, 2003). The result of
Hypothesis 1 lends support to the notion that an alignment between
the SC and CE strategies improves overall ﬁrm proﬁtability. Our
results thus suggest that an alignment viewpoint beneﬁts in
examining the complex relationships among the strategies, in which
ﬁrms could view an aligning state of SC and CE strategies as a
holistic construct to better understand the possible synthetic effects
on ﬁrm performance. This study complements the extant research
(e.g. Carter and Easton, 2011; Fabbe-Costes et al., 2011; Mollenkopf
et al., 2010) which highlights that ﬁrms need to adopt a systems
approach when assessing the complex relationships between envir-
onment, operations, supply chain, and performance.

Second, our ﬁndings identify that proper alignment between a
risk-hedging SC strategy and a defensive CE strategy, a responsive

Table 8
Alignment effects of SC and CE strategies on ﬁrm performance.

SC strategy and an accommodative CE strategy, and an agile SC
strategy and a proactive CE strategy leads to proﬁt enhancement
for the ﬁrm. Managerially, recognizing the alignment effects of SC
and CE strategies is valuable as it establishes a useful decision
making mechanism by which ﬁrms can effectively place a
strategic focus on the environmental sustainability effort in a
supply chain. In a dynamic marketplace, a ﬁrm’s capability to
identify a targeted set of supply strategies and managing compet-
ing strategic priorities between supply chain management and
green initiatives is essential and worthwhile (Bielak et al., 2007;
Monczka and Petersen, 2012). Speciﬁcally, an alignment under a
proﬁle deviation perspective enables ﬁrms to consider numerous
conﬁgurations of the various SC and CE strategies systematically.
In doing so, well placed decision making on environmental
resource allocations for risk-hedging, responsive, and agile supply
chains may ensure the leverage of both operational and environ-
mental efﬁciency.

5.2.

Implications for research

This study also offers some theoretical and managerial con-
tributions. First, in terms of the implications for research, this
study advances the existing research on operations management,
supply chains, sustainability, and performance. Our results pro-
vide empirical evidence that the alignment of the SC and CE
strategies may be useful as a holistic antecedent for ﬁrm perfor-
mance. Accordingly, a possible research focus of sustainable
supply chain management may shift from investigating the
speciﬁc features of the supply chain (e.g. purchasing or logistics)
to examining an integrated business model (Mollenkopf et al.,
2010; Monczka and Petersen, 2012). Further, from an alignment
viewpoint, we have modelled the multiple relationships of the SC
uncertainty environment with the different conﬁgurations of the
CE strategy. This is valuable to theory building as we set the tone
and direction for a new stream of research.

Second, proﬁle deviation analysis offers a theoretical extension
of using the strategic alignment concept as proposed by
Venkatraman (1989) to examine the multiple links between the
supply chain and the environment. As prior studies mostly
explore such complex relations using a reductionist approach
through moderation or mediation models, this may not provide a
the holistic patterns of
deep enough understanding of

interdependency among the research constructs (Umanath,
2003). On the methodology side, using proﬁle deviation analysis
to measure the degree of misalignment provides a useful starting
point to explore the multiple relationships between the business
and the broader environment.

5.3.

Implications for practice

Our results have managerial implications as well. For practi-
tioners, repositioning the beneﬁts resulting from green initiatives
into a set of business goals should be a priority. This study offers
some guidelines for ﬁrms to align goals for both operational
efﬁciency and pollution-reduction from a strategic alignment
perspective (i.e. under different supply chain uncertainties). This
is more useful than the traditionalist view of negotiating trade-
offs. As the alignment concept can generate knowledge about the
synergies and conﬂicts between the SC and CE strategies, this can
allow ﬁrms to be more proactive when deciding on strategic
priorities. For instance, ﬁrms should know that when operating
under a responsive SC strategy, they need to exercise an accom-
modative CE strategy so as to ensure that in their geographical
theatre of operations, they will beneﬁt materially and act as
good corporate citizens, leading to a win–win situation for all
concerned.

Finally, even though our results suggest the greater emphasis
needs to be placed on aligning certain CE strategies with SC
strategies, it may not be necessary nor appropriate for a ﬁrm to
(1) conﬁne to a speciﬁc aligning link(s) for an extended period, or
(2) lead their competitors on certain environmental issues. It is
common knowledge that even after a ﬁrm has achieved align-
ment between two sets of strategies,
its supply chain will
continue to evolve through changes in process or external
uncertainties, thus leading to a possibility of alignment failure.
Through our study, ﬁrms now have a basis to switch between two
different classes of strategy simultaneously and maintain compe-
titive posture. In short, the alignment viewpoint helps ﬁrms to
recognize and respond strategically to the needs of business and
society. This process of alignment can guide ﬁrms through
corporate transformation adequately when operating a volatile
marker such as Asia today.

5.4. Research limitations and future research directions

Some limitations exist. First, using the existing environmental
management and supply chain management literature, we con-
ﬁgure some attributes as the ideal proﬁles of the SC and CE
strategies. Yet, our ideal proﬁles may lack comprehensive power
in that not all factors relevant to the ﬁrm are evaluated. For
example, Delmas and Toffel (2004) urge that competitive forces
and industry characteristics may inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s environmental
policy. Thus, more variables could be included in future research
when identifying the ideal proﬁles of the SC and CE strategies. The
second limitation is that the sampling frame is manufacturing
ﬁrms in Taiwan. Though using samples collected in a single
country allows for greater control over contextual and operational
factors, this limits external generalizability. Future research
would beneﬁt from expanding this investigation across several
countries, which can assist in overcoming the potential problems
with generalizability.

Today, sustainability is becoming a leading focus of doing
business in Asia, at both the ﬁrm and supply chain levels. As such,
incorporating sustainability must offer a better understanding of
whether a ﬁrm’s engagement in a sustainable supply chain can
yield overall beneﬁts to both the ﬁrm and society. Competition
through and alignment of a SC strategy must go hand in hand
with the environment.
