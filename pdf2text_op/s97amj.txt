 THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATIVE KNOW-HOW:

 AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE LEARNING ORGANIZATION

 BERNARD L. SIMONIN
 University of Washington

 In this research, I proposed and tested a model of how firms learn from
 their strategic alliances. Based on a survey of 151 firms, the results
 suggest that experience alone is insufficient for the achievement of the
 greatest benefits from collaboration. Experience must be internalized
 first, and collaborative know-how must be developed for this experi-
 ence to contribute to future collaborative benefits.

 Many researchers have demonstrated the importance of knowledge to
 management, but few have focused on how companies can develop this
 know-how. What has been written is theoretical (Fiol & Lyles, 1985; Huber,
 1991; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995), and beyond small-sample, in-depth studies
 of a few organizations, there has been almost no empirical work in this area.
 Although the theories reflect an intuitive understanding of the effects of
 learning and knowledge-based resources on performance, there is a clear
 need for hypothesis development and testing (Fiol, 1994; Miller & Shamsie,
 1996). In this research, I responded to this need by using a large cross-
 sectional sample and one particular type of knowledge, collaborative know-
 how, to determine whether companies can develop specialized knowledge
 via experience and then use this knowledge to obtain further benefits.

 Collaboration between companies that do or could compete has at-

 tracted growing attention (Contractor & Lorange, 1988; Dodgson, 1996;
 Kogut, 1988; Parkhe, 1993). Although such collaboration has always been
 necessary, the rate at which firms formally collaborate has increased dra-
 matically in recent years (Glaister & Buckley, 1996; Gomes-Casseres, 1996;
 Gulati, 1995). These collaborations have become important, if not critical,
 means of supplementing corporate strengths and covering weaknesses (Har-
 rigan, 1988). Yet collaborations often do not achieve their original goals, and
 many fail. The costs of failure can be tremendous: companies can use the
 technological capabilities of their former partners against them (Hamel,
 1991; Lei & Slocum, 1992; Reich & Mankin, 1986).

 Given these high stakes, it is important to examine whether firms learn
 from the success and failure of collaborations and apply these lessons to new
 collaborations. Hill and Hellriegel (1994) argued that the lower-than-average
 failure rate of joint ventures in the oil industry can be linked to the fact that
 managers have learned the essentials of collaboration, whereas in other in-
 dustries, firms appear to need to use more time and resources to learn about
 their prospective partners and how to collaborate with them. In another
 context, when General Motors (GM) formed its joint venture with Korea's
 Daewoo Motors, GM had already entered numerous other strategic alliances
 with Asian partners, including Fanuc, Hitachi, Isuzu, Nissan and affiliates,
 Suzuki, and Toyota; these multiple collaborative experiences did not pre-
 vent the formation and continuation over several years of an enormously
 difficult and contentious relationship or the lengthy, heated divorce of GM
 and Daewoo (Serapio & Cascio, 1996). These examples show that experience
 with collaborations alone is not enough to guarantee good future collabora-
 tive performance.

 The central theme of this research note is that a firm's experience must
 be transformed into know-how before it can improve performance. This
 research extends existing work by (1) introducing a construct of collabora-
 tive know-how that measures the extent to which firms have skill in iden-
 tifying, negotiating, managing, monitoring, and terminating collaborations,
 (2) relating this collaborative know-how to the achievement of both tangible
 and intangible benefits from collaborations, (3) relating this collaborative
 know-how to past collaborative experience, (4) showing that experience
 with collaborations, without the development of collaborative know-how,
 will not contribute to the achievement of benefits, (5) examining the impact
 of firm size on the process, and (6) looking at a large sample of firms in a
 single study.

 THEORETICAL MODEL AND LITERATURE

 Management researchers have recently begun looking at elements

 within firms to explain their success and failure and, more specifically, how
 their competitive positions are enhanced through superior knowledge. Some
 theorists have focused on resources (Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt &
 Schoonhaven, 1996), capabilities (Kogut & Zander, 1992), or competencies
 (Helleloid & Simonin, 1994; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Others have looked
 more at how organizations acquire and develop their competencies over
 time (Fiol & Lyles, 1985; Huber, 1991; Levitt & March, 1988; Van de Ven &
 Polley, 1992). There is also a growing body of research on how firms can
 learn from and develop new resources through strategic alliances with other
 firms (Crossan & Inkpen, 1994; Dodgson, 1996; Kogut, 1988; Lyles, 1988). I
 integrated these streams of inquiry by developing and empirically testing a
 model of how organizational experience relates to the formation of special-
 ized know-how that in turn impacts organizational performance.

 Figure 1 encapsulates the theoretical model for this study, model 1,
 which was assessed against competing models (models 2a, 2b, and 3, see

 Table 3) following Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) two-stage procedure. No
 one path, but the simultaneity with which all hypothesized relationships
 can be modeled, confers integrity and relevance to the model. The basic tenet
 at the heart of the postulated model and testing sequence-that collaborative
 know-how is a more important asset than collaborative experience in shap-
 ing performance-is consistent with past research on organizational learning
 as well as with the resource-based view of the firm. In the area of organiza-
 tional learning, it is supported in particular by Nass's (1994) study of indi-
 vidual administrators' learning and Pennings, Barkema, and Douma's (1994)
 investigation of the relationship between organizational learning and corpo-
 rate diversification. Pennings and colleagues concluded not only that project
 expansions were more likely to succeed (in the present study, performance
 and benefits were the measure of success) when they are related and similar
 to those a firm has undertaken before (experience), but that experience with
 certain expansions should lead to a greater capacity (know-how) to imple-
 ment future expansions successfully (performance). Although Pennings and
 colleagues related the success of corporate expansion decisions to organiza-
 tional know-how and learning, they did not measure these constructs di-
 rectly, instead stating that learning can be inferred from the longevity or
 magnitude of expansion activities. Other organizational learning studies
 have also used inferences from experience or some type of benefit as a proxy
 for know-how. Yet without assessing know-how itself, researchers cannot
 confirm that learning has truly occurred; a change in the degree or type of
 benefits over the course of a number of experiences signifies that perfor-
 mance has changed for any number of reasons, with learning being only one
 of these. This study differentiates between mere experience and know-how
 through the derivation of an explicit construct of collaborative know-how.

 Resource-based arguments for sustainable competitive advantage and
 performance have focused on firm-specific assets that are valuable, rare,
 imperfectly imitable, and imperfectly substitutable (Barney, 1991). Collabo-
 rative know-how fits each of the criteria more closely than collaborative
 experience, in support of the theoretical model; this better fit accounts for
 know-how's being more critical than experience. With respect to the first
 criterion, collaborative know-how, or capability, has long been considered a
 valuable resource. For instance, Miller and Shamsie (1996) argued that
 knowledge-based resources often take the form of particular skills (know-
 how), including collaborative ones that help experts work and learn together
 effectively. Likewise, Prahalad and Hamel (1990) recognized NEC's compe-
 tency in managing interfirm collaborations as an important determinant in
 the company's ability to access and internalize new strategic assets from its
 alliance partners. By contrast, experience has been challenged for often be-
 ing a poor teacher (Berg, 1993; Levinthal & March, 1993) and therefore not as
 valuable.

 The high rate of alliance failures constitutes strong evidence that col-
 laborative know-how is also rarer than collaborative experience. If a band-
 wagon effect prevails, firms lacking proper know-how may multiply collabo-

 rative experiences and rush into arrangements that are ill-conceived, poorly
 managed and, therefore, prone to early termination.

 Under the third criterion, imperfect imitability, collaborative experi-

 ence can be traced, mapped, and therefore more easily duplicated than col-
 laborative know-how, which is socially complex (Barney, 1991) and causally
 ambiguous (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Collaborative know-how represents
 organization-wide culture and expertise that cut across departments, indi-
 viduals, and time (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995), a multifaceted capability that,
 as a result of its broad scope, is more difficult for competitors to replicate
 than is experience (cf. Grant, 1996). Furthermore, since they are better able
 to avoid early mistakes and resolve initial problems before they become
 insurmountable, firms with greater collaborative know-how are more likely
 to develop trust and reputation through repeated ties with other firms (Gu-
 lati, 1995), a process resulting in enduring relationships that are less imitable
 (and substitutable for) than those based on mere experience.

 Under the fourth criterion, experience can be substituted for more easily
 than know-how. Competition in the RISC chip industry,1 for example, has
 quickly led to a proliferation of alliance constellations centered on IBM,
 Mips, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems that allow these companies
 to develop, build, sell, and promote their respective chips and systems (cf.
 Gomes-Casseres, 1996). This example demonstrates that the implementation
 of the same collaborative strategy can be considered relatively straightfor-
 ward (i.e., replication of the others' experience); in contrast, replacing these
 firms' resulting collaborative know-how would be a very formidable chal-
 lenge because of the idiosyncratic nature of this know-how.

 With respect to the resource-based view of the firm on which the pre-

 vious approach draws, Miller and Shamsie (1996) recognized that empirical
 studies were too rare and that one of the main reasons for that rarity was the
 difficulty of operationally defining the notion of resources. This study builds
 on the resource-based view by defining one resource, collaborative know-
 how, and measuring it. The following sections describe each of the con-
 structs represented in the model.

 Performance: Tangible and Intangible Benefits

 The rationales for entering strategic alliances, encompassing a broad
 spectrum of strategic and tactical motives, have been well documented in the
 literature (cf. Contractor & Lorange, 1988; Dodgson, 1996; Glaister & Buck-
 ley, 1996). Since the benefits sought often do not materialize, the critical
 questions for a firm entering a new alliance become performance assessment
 and control (cf. Geringer & Hebert, 1991). Because alliance rationales and
 performance are multidimensional (cf. Dussauge & Garrette, 1995; Hill &
 Hillriegel, 1994), some researchers (Crossan & Inkpen, 1994; Hamel, 1991;
 Pucik, 1988) have argued for the need to explicitly distinguish the transfer of

 knowledge from other strategic and financial benefits. Ohmae, for example,
 argued that "most of the time, the financials don't capture the real benefits
 of alliances" (1989: 153). Likewise, as part of their findings, Crossan and
 Inkpen reported that "managers use performance as a direct proxy for gaug-
 ing learning occurrence . . . [and] managers in the American parent compa-
 nies frequently pointed to poor joint-venture financial performance as evi-
 dence that learning was either not occurring or could not occur" (1995: 77).

 Accordingly, in this study performance was divided into two concep-
 tually distinct constructs, tangible and intangible collaborative benefits.
 Tangible benefits are strategic and financial: generating additional profits,
 improving market share, and sustaining competitive advantage, for instance.
 Intangible benefits are learning or knowledge-based: learning specific skills
 and competencies (Kogut, 1988; Parkhe, 1991), learning about interfirm co-
 operation (Lyles, 1988), and learning how to behave cooperatively (Lane &
 Beamish, 1990); or, in an emerging area of interest to both scholars and
 practitioners, simply learning how to learn from collaborations (Crossan &
 Inkpen, 1994; Hamel, 1991). This learning imperative was best summarized
 by Lei and Slocum when they stated that "companies must learn how to
 better utilize strategic alliances as vehicles for learning new technologies
 and skills from their alliance partners while simultaneously protecting
 themselves from being 'deskilled' and 'hollowed out' " (1992: 81).

 Although it is certainly possible for firms to attain both tangible and
 intangible benefits, difficult operational trade-offs in managing and staffing
 collaborations emerge, depending upon the benefits sought (Pucik, 1988).
 Organizations that have targeted and achieved intangible benefits may not
 yet have realized the tangible benefits that will eventually flow from a col-
 laboration. Conversely, some collaborations may yield clear tangible benefits
 (e.g., market share growth), but intangible gains (e.g., superior knowledge
 about the market) may not yet be attained. In both cases, when partners use
 different time spans to measure the completion of a collaboration's objec-
 tives, there are likely to be difficulties in managing and monitoring the
 collaboration (Ganitsky & Watzke, 1990).
 Collaborative Know-How

 In many organizations, corporate perceptions and use of international
 joint ventures have become institutionalized and have resulted in the for-
 mulation of both explicit and implicit organizational routines (Tallman &
 Shenkar, 1994). It is this organizational know-how that determines how
 effectively new collaborations are entered and managed. Collaborative
 know-how per se is a complex, multifaceted construct, as the diversity of
 research themes in the literature suggests; these range from alliance forma-
 tion (Contractor & Lorange, 1988; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996) to per-
 formance evaluation (Geringer & Hebert, 1991; Hagedoorn & Schakenraad,
 1994). Given this broad spectrum of alliance issues, it is useful to think of
 collaborative know-how along the following four fundamental phases of a
 collaboration cycle:

 (1) Identifying and selecting potential collaborators (Geringer, 1991).
 Success in this area rests upon ability to determine which firms will actually
 deliver the benefits sought, to understand the strategic implications of
 choosing one firm over another, to accurately assess technological and mar-
 keting capabilities, as well as other strengths, and to evaluate the likely
 responses of different partners to various contingencies, including loss of
 valuable strategic information, which can result from even preliminary dis-
 cussions. This initial stage is critical since "the specific partner chosen can
 influence the overall mix of available skills and resources, the operating
 policies and procedures, and the short and long term viability" of a collabo-
 ration (Geringer, 1991: 55-56).

 (2) Negotiating the terms and structure of a collaborative agreement
 (Lorange & Roos, 1990). Doing this requires the ability to evaluate the im-
 portant legal, tax, and financial implications of different collaborative forms
 and structures, as well as to simply understand a collaborator's position and
 close the deal.

 (3) Monitoring and managing an ongoing collaboration (Ganitsky &
 Watzke, 1990; Hladik, 1985). This process calls for directing, evaluating, and
 enforcing the actions of others (Minkler, 1993), activities that require a va-
 riety of different skills, including staffing, trust building, resolving conflicts,
 transferring resources, training, and renegotiating agreements. These staff-
 ing, management, and control-related issues are important since they can
 significantly affect the learning that takes place in a collaboration and its
 ultimate success or failure (Van de Ven & Polley, 1992). Toward this end,
 Lorange and Roos (1990) suggested that the "competence mix" of the man-
 agement team running a collaboration should reflect the objectives set for the
 collaboration. Likewise, in his study of global strategic alliances, Parkhe
 (1991) pointed to the importance of developing sophistication-the capabil-
 ity to diagnose important differences between partners and devise novel
 solutions to accommodate them.

 (4) Terminating a collaboration (Serapio & Cascio, 1996). Since most
 collaborations eventually end, knowing when and how to exit can be critical
 to a firm's achieving its original objectives without compromising other
 competitive aspects of its operations (Serapio & Cascio, 1996). Organizations
 that do not learn how or when to exit may either fall into competency traps
 (Levitt & March, 1988) or find that their collaborators are ready to exit when
 they are not (Reich & Mankin, 1986). A construct of collaborative know-how
 must effectively capture all these issues pertaining to the different phases of
 a collaboration.

 Researchers have increasingly drawn attention to the critical links be-
 tween learning orientation (Nevis, DiBella, & Gould, 1995), knowledge
 (Nonaka, 1994), and learning and actual firm performance. Nass (1994)
 pointed out that the development of both skills and knowledge in a corpo-
 ration has clear, positive effects on performance. Levinthal and March stated
 this: "As researchers have considered the stability of differences in firm
 performance in the face of changing business environments, many have

 come to view the ability to learn as an important, indeed in some accounts
 a unique, source of sustainable competitive advantage" (1993: 96); Helleloid
 and Simonin (1994) echoed this view, maintaining that developing new
 organizational learning capabilities and challenging existing organizational
 routines is critical for guaranteeing core competence enhancement and sus-
 tained competitive advantage. Such issues are not only of interest to re-
 searchers, but are also under growing scrutiny by practitioners. Laukkanen
 pointed out that "increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of
 knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance" (1994: 322).
 Empirically, Miller and Shamsie (1996) showed in their study of major U.S.
 movie studios that knowledge-based resources that were difficult to buy or
 imitate indeed contributed to performance.

 In the context of interfirm collaboration, such a relationship between
 knowledge development and performance remains to be conceptualized and
 empirically verified. As firms develop collaborative know-how, future col-
 laborations should result in superior tangible and intangible benefits. In-
 creased collaborative know-how in terms of searching for, negotiating, man-
 aging, monitoring, and terminating collaborative agreements can provoke
 more informed decisions about further collaborations and more realistic and
 achievable objective settings for collaborations.

 Hypothesis la. Firms with higher levels of collaborative
 know-how will achieve higher levels of tangible benefits
 from a collaboration.

 This hypothesis partially addresses Miller and Shamsie's concern that
 "although there are long lists of candidates for valuable resources, there have
 been very few efforts to establish systematically if, when, and how these
 resources influence financial performance" (1996: 539).

 For completeness, it is also necessary to consider the impact of such
 resources on other dimensions of corporate performance, learning in par-
 ticular (intangible benefits). In this respect, Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr
 (1996) argued the following: "The development of cooperative routines goes
 beyond simply learning how to maintain a large number of ties. Firms must
 learn how to transfer knowledge across alliances and locate themselves in
 those network positions that enable them to keep pace with the most prom-
 ising scientific and technological developments" (1996: 119-120). Similarly,
 in a collaborative world in which social networks of prior alliances play an
 important role in shaping future alliance formation by providing conduits
 for valuable information (Gulati, 1995: 620), firms must become experts at
 "managing" such strategic information at both the receiving and emitting
 ends. Such capability calls for a collaborative expertise that cuts across all
 aspects and phases of an alliance. For instance, it can be extremely difficult
 to devise contracts for the transfer of tacit knowledge and the attainment of
 other types of intangible benefits (Grant, 1996; Lei & Slocum, 1992). As a
 result, the proper level of know-how needed to assist in the selection of
 partners who will understand, support, and agree to cooperate in this type of

 knowledge exchange is particularly critical. The ability to manage collabo-
 rations so that these benefits are attained and to monitor the flow or devel-
 opment of information that is by its very nature difficult to measure is also
 a capability enhanced by collaborative know-how.

 Hypothesis lb. Firms with higher levels of collaborative
 know-how will achieve higher levels of intangible benefits
 from a collaboration.

 Collaborative Experience

 Collaborative experience involves many aspects of a firm's collaborative
 history. Experience is determined not only by the frequency with which a
 firm has collaborated with other firms, but also by the intensity, longevity,
 and types of the collaborations. Some collaborations, like personal relation-
 ships, are incredibly intense and involve a great deal of interaction, and
 others are much more casual. Likewise, some collaborations are very brief,
 and others last a long time. For instance, Dow Corning, the collaboration
 between Dow Chemical and Corning Glass, is now itself a Fortune 300 firm.
 Most likely, a firm's propensity to transform collaborative experience into a
 form of competitive advantage will depend on its capacity to internalize and
 routinize lessons drawn from a variety of organizational and individual ex-
 periments (cf. Cohen & Bacdayan, 1994; Nelson & Winter, 1982; Nonaka,
 1994). In fact, a critical foundation for a learning organization is this ability
 to build from experience, the key to which resides with managers who "see
 their prime task as facilitating members' experimentation and learning from
 experience" (Marquardt & Reynolds, 1994: 54).

 Collaboration can take a variety of forms, including joint ventures, con-

 sortia, equity participation, contractual agreements, and informal coopera-
 tions. The particular form of a collaboration may be related both to the
 partners' specific goals for it and to the firms' experiences and expertise in
 collaboration (cf. Powell et al., 1996). Rather than focusing on just one of
 these forms, in this study I looked at a full range of collaborative arrange-
 ments when assessing a firm's prior collaborative experience. The actual
 form chosen for a collaboration may be related to governmental restrictions,
 managerial incentive systems, or equity market situations, all of which
 change over time. The construct collaborative experience should reflect all
 previous experiences of a firm in interfirm collaborations.

 In an in-depth study of four firms, Lyles (1988) found that, in fact, these

 firms had changed their approach to collaboration on the basis of their ex-
 periences with past collaborations. Indeed, Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr
 argued this: "Experience at collaborating is necessary to manage a diverse
 portfolio of ties. Hence . .. firms learn from exploration and experience how
 to recognize and structure different types of alliances" (1996: 120-121).
 Conceptually, the development of such collaborative know-how can occur
 either through direct collaborative experience or through nonexperiential
 methods like congenital learning, imitation, grafting, and searching (Huber,

 1991). Yet each collaboration is set within the context of particular firms,
 each with its own routines governing how it responds to change (Nelson &
 Winter, 1982). Thus, although knowledge about collaborations can be
 gleaned from external sources, much of this knowledge may not have value
 until it is internalized and applied to a firm's own unique situation. Firms
 that have greater levels of collaborative experience are also in a better posi-
 tion to recognize the similarities and differences between their own situa-
 tions and those of other firms. The effectiveness of imitating, grafting, and
 searching forms of learning can all be enhanced with prior experience, and
 even the ability to tap into congenital knowledge may be enhanced through
 experience.

 What knowledge is "stored" and "retrieved" may depend in part upon

 the knowledge structure already in place in a firm (Lyles & Schwenk, 1992).
 Organizational routines store organizational experience in a form that allows
 for a rapid transfer of that experience to new situations (Cohen & Bacdayan,
 1994). For instance, the draft of a letter of intent for a new joint venture is
 likely to reflect a format and content derived from previous experiences with
 a related, but still very different, context and situation. In that regard, the
 letter of intent is a manifestation of an organizational routine-the drafting
 process-that can be partially codified and formally updated over time.

 As Pennings, Barkema, and Douma stated, "Organizations evolve as
 they accumulate experiences, incrementally adjusting their reactions to
 similar problems while absorbing feedback about past decisions" (1994:
 609). Such notions of concrete experience leading to observations and re-
 flections, and in turn, to the formation of abstract concepts and generaliza-
 tions have long been postulated in various competing models of organiza-
 tional learning cycles (Kim, 1993; Kolb, 1984). Thus, a positive relationship
 between collaborative experience and know-how was expected.

 Hypothesis 2. Firms with greater collaborative experience
 will achieve higher levels of collaborative know-how.

 This hypothesis, taken at the organizational level, is consistent with the
 findings of Nass (1994) at the individual level-that greater experience is
 consistent with greater knowledge. Likewise, the general approach of this
 study reflects Cyert and March's (1963) view of "the organization as an
 adaptively rational system that basically learns from experience" (Kim,
 1993: 41). The logic of such a relationship is far from trivial, as is suggested
 by Senge's (1990) "learning dilemma," that people learn best from experi-
 ence but never directly experience the consequences of many of their most
 important decisions. According to Senge, organizational learning is con-
 strained by an individual "learning horizon," or the window in time and
 space through which effectiveness can be assessed and beyond which it is
 impossible to learn from experience. Likewise, Stata (1989) pointed to the
 limitations of organizational memory that is dependent on individuals and
 to the importance of institutional mechanisms: learning builds on past
 knowledge and experience-that is, memory. The various problems imped-

 ing learning (e.g., memory, turnover, conflicts, competency traps, tacitness,
 superstitious learning, fragmented learning, and learning from small
 samples) have been well documented by researchers (Corner, Kinicki, &
 Keats, 1994; March, Sproull, & Tamuz, 1991). Levinthal and March elo-
 quently summarized the general problems of learning from experience by
 stating this:

 Experience is often a poor teacher, being typically quite meager
 relative to the complex and changing nature of the world in
 which learning is taking place. Many of the same cognitive lim-
 its that constrain rationality also constrain learning. Learning
 from experience involves inferences from information. It in-
 volves memory. It involves pooling personal experience with
 knowledge gained from the experiences of others. The difficul-
 ties in learning effectively in the face of confusing experience are
 legendary. Even highly capable individuals and organizations
 are confused by the difficulties of using small samples of am-
 biguous experience to interpret complex worlds (1993: 96-97).

 Sample and Instrument

 METHODS

 The population for this study consisted of large and medium-sized U.S.

 companies. I randomly drew a sample of 1,000 public and privately owned
 U.S. companies from the Corptech Directory after controlling for largeness
 (defined by sales greater than $50 million and a workforce of more than 500
 employees). Since this study was concerned with the overall collaborative
 phenomenon, it was also important to consider these companies' experience
 with both domestic and international alliances. The selection of informants
 was dictated by two key imperatives: (1) an individual's high degree of
 familiarity with and expert knowledge of one specific international strategic
 alliance and (2) the individual's ability to report accurately and comprehen-
 sively given (a) the strategic nature of the survey's content, (b) its focus on
 cross-corporate boundaries issues, such as transfers of know-how and per-
 formance, and (c) the probing of past corporate experiences with collabora-
 tions.

 Given these requirements, choosing top executives whose understand-
 ing and fields of action pertained to their overall organizations was neces-
 sary. As informants, top managers are not only the most able to recognize
 and assess the relative importance of organizational changes, be they per-
 formance or strategy related (Glick, Huber, Miller, Doty, & Sutcliffe, 1990);
 they are also the most qualified to report specialized information on strategic
 alliances (cf. Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996; Geringer, 1991). The firms'
 top executives were the informants who were the most able to observe and
 to determine the impacts of specific alliances on the rest of the organizations'
 activities and were also the most likely to have knowledge of international
 cases. Thus, I also designed the screening process to target the informants
 most likely to be knowledgeable about international alliances, taking an

 approach similar to Parkhe's (1993) data collection. Informants were se-
 lected from the directory and prioritized on the basis of level and responsi-
 bility for international operations, corporate development, technology trans-
 fer, or joint ventures under the Corptech classification.

 The design of the questionnaire, its implementation, and the conduct of

 the survey were based on the total design method approach (Dillman, 1978).
 The questionnaire, pretested on 12 executives experienced with strategic
 alliances, prompted an informant to focus on the current (at least one year
 old) or the past but recent (terminated less than three years ago) international
 strategic alliance with which he or she was the most familiar. Informants
 were invited to select an international collaborative venture as a first choice
 but were encouraged to refer to a domestic alliance when the former choice
 was not possible or less appropriate, since the conceptual model being de-
 veloped and tested concerned both cases. In addition to general facts and
 descriptive information about the alliance under scrutiny, specific questions
 related to the partner, the collaborative objectives of each party, the observed
 impact on the parent companies, and issues of knowledge transfer were
 asked. Most of the items of the questionnaire followed a seven-point Likert-
 type scale.

 From the 192 companies that participated in the study, 151 fully com-
 pleted, usable questionnaires were obtained. With respect to the companies'
 numbers of employees, sales, and ages, no significant differences were ob-
 served between the respondent and nonrespondent groups. The majority of
 the respondents were top executives in some of America's largest corpora-
 tions. Over 50 percent of the companies included in the study had sales
 volumes greater than $350 million and workforces larger than 2,500 employ-
 ees. The strategic alliances still active and represented in the study were, on
 the average, six years old. At the time of the survey, 12 of the reported
 alliances had been terminated (6 the year of the survey, 6 others the year
 before) after averaging a seven-year life span.
 Model and Analysis

 To assess the direct and indirect relationships among the constructs
 collaborative experience, collaborative know-how, and tangible and intan-
 gible benefits posited in the theoretical model (Figure 1), I used the maxi-
 mum-likelihood LISREL VII program (J6reskog & S6rbom, 1989). The two-
 stage procedure recommended by Anderson and Gerbing (1988) was fol-
 lowed so that the theoretical model could be gauged against competing
 models (see Hoskisson, Johnson, and Moesel [1994] for a detailed explana-
 tion and application of the procedure).

 In addition to the structural model, Figure 1 encapsulates the measure-
 ment model. Each latent variable in the model is measured by multiple
 indicators. Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations for all these
 indicators as well as the correlation matrix used as input for the analyses.
 Because measuring performance in complex collaborations is inherently dif-
 ficult (Dussauge & Garrette, 1995; Geringer & Hebert, 1991; Hill & Hellriegel,

 1994), I considered both subjective and objective measures of ex post ben-
 efits for the parent company that was in the sample. In the first run of the
 structural equation model (run 1), all the measures of collaborative benefits
 (for '13 and q14) were self-reported measures. To address possible common
 method bias effects and to cross-validate the results, I performed a second
 run (run 2), which included a mix of self-reported measures of intangible
 benefits (i3) and external, secondary data on tangible benefits (r2).

 Collaborative experience. Two multiple-item scales were used, desig-

 nated as Y1 and Y2 (r = .57). Both indicators were derived from Terpstra and
 Simonin's (1993) taxonomy of strategic alliances. The first manifest variable,
 Y1, represented the level of experience with five different structural collabo-
 rative forms (informal cooperation, contractual agreements, equity joint ven-
 tures, equity purchase/swaps, and consortia) on a seven-point scale for each
 form (1 = not at all, 4 = moderate, 7 = a great deal). Y1 was computed as the
 mean of all these ratings. Likewise, on similar scales, Y2 represented the
 level of collaborative experience with the following ten different functional
 collaborative modes across the value chain (Porter & Fuller, 1986): joint
 research, joint product development, joint production, joint marketing, li-
 censing and cross-licensing, manufacturing arrangements and subcontract-
 ing, distribution (piggybacking) and cross distribution, after-market servic-
 ing, franchising, and barter and countertrade. Y2 is the mean of these ratings.

 Collaborative know-how. Five-factor scores were used, designated Y3 to

 Y7 (Ca = .82) to capture the essence of this complex and multifaceted con-
 struct in a parsimonious but still meaningful manner. I first performed a
 factor analysis (SPSS-X's FACTOR procedure) with the maximum-
 likelihood extraction method and direct "oblimin" rotation on a set of 20
 measures developed through the literature review and pretest stages. These
 measures correspond to the assessed level of corporate expertise with each
 listed aspect of collaborative know-how on a seven-point Likert-type scale.
 The analysis generated five factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that
 accounted for more than 70 percent of the total variance. Y3, collaborative
 management know-how (43.7 percent of variance explained), had eight
 items: building trust with the partner, managing alliance-parent company
 relations, conflict resolution, logistics and resource transfer, renegotiating
 initial agreements with partner, staffing, cross-cultural training, and techno-
 logical assessment. Y4, negotiation know-how (8.9 percent of variance ex-
 plained), had five items: estimating asset values and future cash flows, tax
 aspects, closing the deal, legal aspects, and negotiations. Y5, partner-
 searching know-how (7.1 percent of variance explained), had three items:
 partner selection, partner identification, and understanding strategic impli-
 cations of collaborating. Y6, knowledge and skills transfers (5.5 percent of
 variance explained), had two items: knowledge-skills acquisition and
 knowledge-skills safeguarding. Y7, exiting skills (5.2 percent of variance
 explained), had two items: profit and capital repatriation and exiting from
 the alliance. From these results, I computed additive factor scores for each

 observation, obtaining the five manifest variables for the collaborative know-
 how construct (X3).

 Performance: Tangible collaborative benefits. One set of three items

 and a pair of single-item scales were used. The items were designated Y8 to
 Y1o (o = .87), and the two scales were five-year financial ratio averages,
 return on investment (ROI) and return on assets (ROA; r = .91). The param-
 eter I3 captures the extent to which the alliance under consideration con-
 tributed to a variety of tangible benefits, including Y8, generating profits for
 the parent company; Yg, improving market share; and Ylo, sustaining com-
 petitive advantage. All values were recorded on a seven-point perceptual
 scale (1 = not at all, 4 = moderate, 7 = a great deal). To overcome possible
 effects of common method bias, I collected the two additional measures of
 performance, ROI and ROA, from Compact Disclosure's "Worldscope" cor-
 porate database. A five-year average of these annual returns was computed,
 with the year of the survey and the following year as the last two points in
 the five-year cycle. Full information on 73 companies was available as the
 basis of the second LISREL run.

 Performance: Intangible collaborative benefits. Three single-item

 scales, designated Y1l to Y13 (a = .75), were used. As in the construct pre-
 viously described, three measures of intangible collaborative benefits related
 to learning issues were considered: Y1l, learning about interfirm coopera-
 tion; Y12, learning specific skills and competencies held by the partner; and
 Y13, learning skills and competencies independent of the partner.

 Control variable: Firm size. Two single-item scales, X1 and X2 (r = .89),

 were used. Firm size, which has been considered a key impediment to organ-
 izational learning (Marquardt & Reynolds, 1994) and a determinant of alli-
 ance participation (Berg, Duncan, & Friedman, 1982; Hagedoorn & Schaken-
 raad, 1994), was measured by the logarithms of total sales (X1) and number
 of employees (X2) as reported in the Corptech Directory.

 Measurement Model

 RESULTS

 Tables 2 and 3 report the results of structural equation modeling based

 on Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) recommended two-stage procedure. In
 the first stage, I evaluated model 0 to ensure that the measurement model
 was strong before testing the theoretical model. Indeed, the pseudo chi-
 square test for the null model in Table 3 was nonsignificant (X2 = 107.39, df
 = 90, p > .10), indicating that there was no fundamental misspecification in
 the measurement model. All the constructs displayed satisfactory levels of
 reliability, as indicated by composite reliabilities ranging from .90 to .95.
 Similarly, all the Cronbach's alphas were greater than .70, satisfying Nun-
 nally's (1978) minimum criterion for internal consistency. All the factor
 loadings were significant (t-values greater than 4.87) and were highly related
 to their respective constructs, in support of convergent validity. Likewise, a

 series of chi-square difference tests on the factor correlations provided evi-
 dence of discriminant validity (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). In particular, the
 significant test (Ax2 = 40.57, Adf= 1) for the two latent variables tangible and
 intangible benefits indicated that the two constructs were not perfectly cor-
 related and that discriminant validity had been achieved (Bagozzi & Phillips,
 1982). That is, from a measurement-model point of view, tangible and in-
 tangible benefits represent two distinct constructs, not one. Their roles must
 be addressed separately.

 Structural Model

 Table 2 reports the parameter estimates and goodness-of-fit indicators of
 the structural equation system for the theoretical model obtained in the first
 LISREL analysis (run 1). Although the overall chi-square was significant (X2
 = 111.58, 83 df, p < .02), as might be expected with this statistic's sensitivity
 to sample size (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988), all the other fit indexes (nonnormed fit
 index [NNFI] = .96, normed fit index [NFI] = .89, comparative fit index [CFI]
 = .97) were within satisfactory ranges and suggested a more adequate fit of
 the model. In addition, the goodness-of-fit index (GFI = .91), the adjusted
 goodness-of-fit index (AGFI = .87), and the root-mean-square residual
 (RMSR = .07) were all within acceptable ranges and showed that the model
 accounted for a substantial amount of variance (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). Hence,
 the model was a reasonable representation of the data.

 Under the parameter estimates, collaborative experience (Xiq) displayed
 a significant, positive effect on collaborative know-how (I2)), in support of
 Hypothesis 2 (I21 = .47, t = 3.62). Simultaneously, the construct collabora-
 tive know-how showed a significant, positive effect on both tangible and
 intangible collaborative benefits (332 = .45, t = 4.15; f42 = .40, t = 3.74) in
 support of Hypotheses la and Ib; that is, the greater the degree of collabo-
 rative know-how, the higher the levels of tangible and intangible benefits
 obtained from a collaboration. For the control variable company size (,), a
 significant effect on collaborative experience was observed (Y11 = .39, t =
 4.90), indicating that larger companies had more experience with strategic
 alliances. The summary statistics in Table 3 indicate that model 1 was pre-
 ferred to model 2a (AX2 = 2.04, Adf= 2, p > .30), supporting a model with no
 direct relationship between collaborative experience and either tangible or
 intangible collaborative benefits (both direct paths in model 2a were statis-
 tically nonsignificant). Hence, results show that experience alone (without
 collaborative know-how) does not affect performance. Likewise, model 1
 was preferred to model 2b (AX2 = 2.35, Adf= 1, p > .10) and to model 3 (X2
 = 111.58 vs. x2 = 125.01, same df), further underlining the relevance of
 know-how as a mediator between experience and performance. In sum, the
 proposed theoretical model represented the preferred and most acceptable
 and parsimonious model.

 To further understand the role of company size as a possible moderator

 of the postulated learning process, I performed a complementary analysis by

 first dividing the sample into two groups (split at the median on size) and
 then running a multiple-group analysis (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989). No sta-
 tistically significant difference in the results for the two groups emerged
 even though both groups displayed fundamentally different characteristics
 (average number of employees, 1,192 vs. 21,040; average sales, $241 million
 vs. $2,433 million). The chi-square difference test (X2d [5, n1 = 74, n2 = 75] =
 2.74, p > .70) between the null model (where the structural paths were freely
 estimated for both groups simultaneously) and the restricted model (where
 all the paths were constrained to be equal across groups) showed that com-
 pany size did not affect the nature and magnitude of the hypothesized rela-
 tionships among experience, know-how, and collaborative benefits.

 Contributions

 DISCUSSION

 The results indicate that firms do learn from past collaborations by
 developing skills in identifying potential collaborators, negotiating the form
 and specifics of collaborative agreements, managing and monitoring the ar-
 rangements, knowing when to terminate them, and transferring knowledge.
 This collaborative know-how in turn allows firms to achieve greater benefits
 from collaborations. The results also demonstrate that previous collaborative
 experience alone does not ensure that a firm will benefit from a collabora-
 tion. That is, experience is only valuable if the lessons of this experience
 (both positive and negative) are internalized by the firm and drawn into
 specific know-how that can be used to guide future actions. These results
 point to the criticality of building a learning organization (Senge, 1990; Stata,
 1989) that can effectively utilize past experience when entering new col-
 laborations.

 The results supporting the relationship between collaborative experi-

 ence and know-how stress the importance of experiential learning in devel-
 oping collaborative know-how. These results are consistent with those of
 Lyles (1988): experience is critical in creating know-how that is tailored to
 specific firms. Although the process by which experience leads to know-how
 is often taken for granted, managing this process is problematic for firms.
 Organizations often cannot assess what they know because of forces of spe-
 cialization or departmentalization, and when they can, they may still not be
 able to anticipate future needs for particular information that may, as a
 result, get discarded (Huber, 1991). Under such conditions, the formaliza-
 tion of particular knowledge may be prevented, or the know-how may be-
 come dysfunctional in that it lacks important components.

 The results of this study may also shed some additional light on prior
 studies that have failed to substantiate a direct impact of past experience
 with collaboration on firms' performance. For instance, in his study of North
 American-Japanese joint ventures, Inkpen (1995) found that neither the ex-
 perience of having previously managed a joint venture nor the experience of
 having worked before with a given partner affected the learning efforts of

 parent companies. Similarly, in their study of internal corporate joint ven-
 tures, Shortell and Zajac (1988) rejected the hypothesis of a positive rela-
 tionship between past experience and the profitability of new joint ventures.
 Whereas this study points to a similar lack of direct effect, it nonetheless
 reveals that an indirect effect exists, mediated through the construct know-
 how. In that sense, collaborative know-how may constitute a missing link of
 theoretical and practical importance. Further refinements of the construct
 can be envisioned to provide practitioners with a more powerful self-
 assessment tool or researchers with more specialized scales, but these first
 findings begin to address Miller and Shamsie's (1996) concern about the
 difficulties of operationally defining the notion of resources and, therefore,
 conducting empirical work based upon the resource-based view of the firm.
 In its modeling of performance, this study follows a research tradition

 that calls for an explicit distinction between learning-based and financial
 motives in strategic alliances (cf. Crossan & Inkpen, 1994; Dodgson, 1996;
 Hamel, 1991; Pucik, 1988). The results are consistent with this view, as
 evidenced by the reported discriminant validity between tangible (%3) and
 intangible (-q4) benefits in the measurement model and by the simultaneous
 impact of collaborative know-how (and the lack of a direct effect for expe-
 rience) on these two distinct constructs.

 Finally, whereas the study showed that larger companies have more
 experience with strategic alliances, a result consistent with previous re-
 search (Bert et al., 1982; Hagedoorn & Schakenraad, 1994), it also, more
 importantly, revealed that company size does not affect the significance and
 magnitude of the relationships postulated among experience, know-how,
 and performance. That is, the process itself as encapsulated in the model of
 simultaneous equations is not subject to the structural impediments that
 corporate largeness or smallness typically triggers (cf. Marquardt & Reyn-
 olds, 1994). Still, these results should be challenged with other organiza-
 tional forms, such as start-up companies. Although the process itself may be
 invariant, no inferences can be made with respect to efficiency levels or
 outcomes. The question of small organizations' being more or less efficient
 learners or more or less successful alliance participants remains to be ex-
 plored directly.
 Limitations

 With respect to the present results, a number of caveats pertaining to
 common method, single-respondent, and social desirability biases should be
 acknowledged. To address the possibility of common method bias, I adopted
 two distinct approaches. First, following Scott and Bruce (1994) and Konrad
 and Linnehan (1995), I performed Harman's one-factor test on the question-
 naire measurement items. The resulting principal components factor analy-
 sis yielded 12 factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that accounted for 70
 percent of the total variance. Since several factors, as opposed to one single
 factor, were identified, and since the first factor did not account for the
 majority of the variance (only 22 percent), a substantial amount of common

 method variance does not appear to be present (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986).
 Second, as described above, accounting measures of performance (ROI and
 ROA) were substituted for the self-reported measures of tangible benefits to
 retest the appropriateness of the theoretical model. Following the exact same
 steps as in the earlier analysis, I used Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) two-
 step procedure and obtained very similar results (Table 2, run 2). Although
 the results of this analysis with external measures of performance provide
 further support for the hypothesized model, the presence of common
 method problems cannot be fully discarded.

 An important methodological imperative for this study was for each
 informant to be highly familiar and involved with one specific alliance as
 well as highly knowledgeable about overall corporate activities and perfor-
 mance across divisional boundaries. In this respect, the study was consid-
 ered satisfactory since the majority of the respondents were top executives in
 their respective organizations and since over 77 percent of them had been
 actively involved with their selected alliances since their inceptions (an-
 other 16 percent had been involved for at least half of the alliances' lives).
 Given the singular and highly specialized expertise associated with these
 informants, a single-informant approach was used. Since in large companies
 a strong tendency exists for upper-echelon executives to act not as teams but
 rather, as "mere constellations of executive talents" immersed in specialized
 and distinct domains (Hambrick, 1995: 115), I did not believe that a second
 informant could bring the same degree of expert knowledge to this study;
 including less knowledgeable informants would have led to less rather than
 more accurate information and therefore would not have improved the origi-
 nal estimates. To insure data reliability, I gave careful attention to the as-
 sessment of the construct reliabilities and have described above the satis-
 factory Cronbach alphas and levels of theoretical reliability established
 through causal modeling.

 Whereas survey data are sometimes subject to social desirability bias
 (Arnold & Feldman, 1981; Podsakoff & Organ, 1986), I did not perceive such
 bias to be a major concern for this study. Following previous research show-
 ing that anonymity reduces social desirability bias in studies of sensitive
 topics (cf. Konrad & Linnehan, 1995), I designed and implemented the sur-
 vey to guarantee respondents' anonymity. The topic of investigation, al-
 though strategic and often confidential, was not thought to be so highly
 sensitive (see Konrad and Linnehan [1995] for illustrations) as to be likely to
 prompt responses that would present the respondent or the organization in
 a favorable light. The original eagerness and candor of the executives who
 participated in the pretest seemed to support this view. However, the oc-
 currence of such bias cannot be totally ruled out.
 Future Research Directions

 Although this study reflects the commonly acknowledged notion that

 learning builds on past experience (Cyert & March, 1963; Levinthal & March,
 1993; Nass, 1994), it is not an attempt to measure the extent to which firms

 undertake nonexperiential learning. The propensity of firms to develop col-
 laborative know-how without actual collaborative experience remains to be
 explored as an alternate, complementary hypothesis. Focusing on the rela-
 tive importance of nonexperiential forms of learning could shed additional
 light on the relative effectiveness of various learning approaches and on the
 reasons why some firms are poor at learning from collaborative experience,
 as the results of Lyles's (1988) case studies suggest.

 This study did not investigate the link between individual and organ-
 izational experience, know-how, and learning (cf. Corner et al., 1994; Kim,
 1993; Kogut & Zander, 1992). Since collaborative know-how may be spread
 throughout an organization, with individuals from different parts of the
 organization learning and contributing to its knowledge base, the challenge
 for many firms is to properly isolate, capture, and disseminate such know-
 how. Some companies, like Boeing, proceed by encouraging systematic and
 organized reflections by the various stakeholders and participants on par-
 ticular situations the company has experienced (e.g., the 777 project or al-
 liances with Japanese partners). In doing so, these companies try to crystal-
 lize individual and sometimes disconnected involvement into an aggregate
 understanding through group sharing and interpretation. In other instances,
 specialized know-how is internalized, updated, and managed by experts or
 expert teams who serve as a knowledge base repository (e.g., in the past, IBM
 has concentrated a lot of its collaborative know-how pertaining to partner
 selection and alliance formation into a small corporate team of specialists
 handling a multitude of leads and situations throughout the organization).
 As these two examples underline, the role of individuals in the development
 and use of collaborative know-how may vary greatly across firms and, as
 such, warrants further investigation.

 The model tested in this study concerns the fundamental relationship

 between experience, knowledge, and performance at a macro level and thus
 remains generic and parsimonious. A stronger focus on knowledge creation
 and transfer (e.g., Crossan & Inkpen, 1994; Nonaka, 1994) within strategic
 alliances could motivate extensions of this model to incorporate firm- and
 alliance-specific variables such as strategic intent, transparency, organiza-
 tional capabilities, and resource commitments that typically relate to models
 of interfirm learning at a more micro level (Hamel, 1991).

 Finally, this study has focused on one type of organizational knowledge,
 collaborative know-how. Yet the general outline of this research could be
 applied to other types of knowledge. For example, this research could be
 extended to a particular form of collaboration, such as mergers and acqui-
 sitions. Much could be learned from the formulation of a merger and acqui-
 sition know-how construct and its antecedents and effects on firm perfor-
 mance in light of previous research (e.g., Pennings et al., 1994). As a second
 example, assessing product development know-how could prove useful to
 researchers and practitioners interested in improving the new product de-
 velopment process or in understanding why firms have different rates of
 success in bringing new products to market.

 Addressing the need noted by Huber (1991), Fiol (1994), and Miller and
 Shamsie (1996), and despite its limitations, this study constitutes an effort to
 advance the study of organizational knowledge creation, which typically has
 lacked large-sample investigation. Understanding of both strategic alliances
 and the learning organization will benefit from future research that values
 similar empirical undertakings.
