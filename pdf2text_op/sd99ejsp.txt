Procedural injustice at work, justice
sensitivity, job satisfaction and
psychosomatic well-being

Abstract

In a ﬁeld study with 295 factory employees, three hypotheses were tested: (1) Procedural
injustice at work is correlated negatively with job satisfaction and psychosomatic well-
being. (2) The perception of procedural injustice depends on the person’s chronic justice
sensitivity. (3) Justice sensitivity moderates the correlation of procedural injustice with
satisfaction and well-being, the correlation becoming larger with increasing justice
sensitivity. Procedural injustice was deﬁned as the discrepancy between desired (ought)
and perceived (is) procedures. Justice sensitivity and procedural fairness according to
Leventhal’s criteria (consistency, nonpartiality, accuracy, correctability, representa-
tiveness) and one additional criterion (open information) were measured via question-
naire. Job satisfaction, number of sick days during the last six months and number of
days a person felt sick at work during the last six months served as indicators of
psychosomatic well-being. The ﬁrst and second hypotheses were supported by the data.
Partial support was also obtained for the third hypothesis: Justice sensitivity moderated
the correlation of procedural unfairness with (a) the number of days the person felt sick
at work and (b) the sum of this variable with the number of sick days. Copyright # 1999

Considerable empirical evidence has been compiled showing that procedural justice in
the workplace is important for the e(cid:129)cient functioning of organizational structures,
for the mental health of employees, for their attitudes toward superiors and toward
the company, for organizational citizenship behavior and, last but not least, for the
economic health of a business (e.g. Bies, 1993; Greenberg, 1996; Meindl & Stensma,
1994; Sheppard, Lewicki & Minton, 1992). The group-value model proposed by Lind
and Tyler (1988) oers a psychological explanation for the eects of procedural
justice. The model assumes that procedural justice informs employees about their
relations to other group members and to authorities. Fair treatment indicates a

positive and respected position of the person within the group and makes the person
feel proud of being a group member. These two consequences, respect and pride, have
positive eects on self-esteem and positive group-oriented behavior.

The present investigation supplements previous work in two respects. First, the
assumption is explored that the perception of procedural unfairness depends on the
person’s chronic sensitivity to injustice. Second, it is predicted and tested that justice
sensitivity moderates the correlation of perceived procedural
injustice with job
satisfaction and psychosomatic well-being.

From a methodological perspective, an experimental manipulation of procedural
justice would be the ideal way for identifying the causal eects of unfairness.
However, several problems are associated with this methodology (cf. Lind & Tyler,
1988). First, treating people unfairly raises ethical concerns. Second, it is di(cid:129)cult to
manipulate procedural justice outside the laboratory. Regarding the context of work,
most companies and organizations would not allow ﬁeld experiments in which their
employees are treated unfairly (Greenberg, 1996). Third, stable individual dierences
in justice attitudes can hardly be manipulated in an experiment, but they may be as
important as situational factors. For these reasons, most studies on procedural justice
in the workplace and other social contexts have used survey methods (Bierho, 1992;
Lind & Tyler, 1988; Tyler, 1990). The weakness of this methodology is well known:
causal interpretations of the correlations between justice evaluations and ‘outcome’
variables such as emotions and behavior are only possible in longitudinal designs.

The most typical approach in survey studies on procedural justice has been asking
individuals how fairly they felt treated by others in a speciﬁc situation (e.g. Tyler,
Degoey & Smith, 1996). Tyler (1994), for example, used two questions for measuring
procedural justice evaluations of a speciﬁc experience employees had with their
supervisor: ‘How fairly were you treated by your supervisor?’ and ‘How fair were the
procedures used to handle the problem?’ Procedural justice according to these items
was connected with relational judgments (neutrality, trust, standing), serving as
antecedent variables, and with negative aect and willingness to accept the super-
visor’s decision, serving as outcome variables.

Individuals dier in their need for justice (Maes, 1994; Rubin & Peplau, 1973) and
in the extent to which they consider justice to be a central human value (Dalbert,
Montada & Schmitt, 1987; Schwartz, 1992). Therefore, it can be expected that the
consequences of justice judgments such as the ones identiﬁed by Tyler (1994) depend
on how important procedural justice is for the person. More speciﬁcally, it can be
expected that correlations between justice judgments and outcome variables are
stronger for individuals who consider procedural justice to be important than for
individuals who care less about justice. Two methods are apt for testing this
hypothesis. The ﬁrst uses moderated regression analysis for testing the interaction
between justice judgment and justice centrality (Aiken & West, 1991). The second
approach integrates both variables into one variable by comparing what ought to be
according to the person’s justice attitudes and what is according to the person’s
perception. This method was proposed by Jasso (1978) for the domain of distributive
justice. Jasso suggested the discrepancy between just share and actual share as a
measure for justice evaluation.1

1Jasso (1978) suggested formalizing the discrepancy as ln (actual/share). Despite some attractive
mathematical properties of this formalization, we prefer dierence scores (just share 7 actual share)
because they correspond more closely to the intuitive discrepancy notion.

Justice sensitivity and procedural injustice

445

Identifying individual dierences in the ought and is components of justice leaves
open from where these dierences originate. We suggest that the person’s chronic
justice sensitivity is a common source of both judgments. The construct of justice
sensitivity has been introduced into the social justice literature by several authors
(Dar & Resh, 1993; Hassebrauck, 1993; Huseman, Hatﬁeld & Miles, 1985; Lovas,
1995; Schmitt, Neumann & Montada, 1995). Despite dierences in the conceptual-
ization and measurement of justice sensitivity, the common assumption states that
individuals dier consistently across time and situations in how easily they perceive
procedures or distributions as unfair. In other words, justice sensitivity is assumed to
be a trait. Schmitt et al. (1995) developed a questionnaire for measuring justice
sensitivity with four indicators: the frequency of perceived unjust events, the intensity
of anger felt when treated unfairly, the intrusiveness of thoughts about unjust events
and the desire to punish the perpetrator. The convergent and discriminant validity of
these indicators was tested successfully by Schmitt et al. (1995) against indicators for
theoretically related constructs (frustration tolerance, trait anger, anger in, anger out,
life satisfaction, centrality of justice, interpersonal trust, need for control). Two
additional studies attest to the construct validity of the indicators. Schmitt and
Mohiyeddini (1996) found that individuals high in justice sensitivity reacted with
more resentment to a natural deprivation of a desired outcome than subjects low in
justice sensitivity. Mohiyeddini and Schmitt (1997) replicated this result for unfair
treatment in the laboratory. In both studies, resentment could be better predicted
from justice sensitivity than from measures for ‘competing’ constructs such as
frustration tolerance, self-assertiveness, trait anger and anger out.

The concept of justice sensitivity implies that individuals who dier in justice
sensitivity also dier in what they think ought to be done and in what they believe
is actually being done in terms of justice. A positive correlation between justice
sensitivity and the ought component can be expected because individuals with high
justice sensitivity are more vulnerable to injustice and need higher justice standards in
order to feel safe. At the same time, it follows from the perceptual threshold notion
contained in the sensitivity concept that individuals with high justice sensitivity will
detect more easily violations of procedures that are generally considered to be fair.
Accordingly, a negative correlation can also be expected between justice sensitivity and
the is component. As a mathematical implication of these two assumptions, a positive
correlation is to be expected between justice sensitivity and procedural unfairness
(ought–is).

In addition to bivariate correlations between justice sensitivity and the ought and
is components of justice evaluations, the possibility can be considered that justice
sensitivity ampliﬁes the eect of the person’s sense of justice on outcome variables.
This conjecture can be derived from the general synergetic interaction model which
is a constituent element of several theories, e.g. Cattell’s (1971) liability concept,
Spielberger’s (1972) proneness concept and the vulnerability concept of the general
diathesis-stress model (Davison & Neale, 1990). Regarding the present context, the
synergetic interaction model predicts that subjects scoring high in justice sensitivity
react more strongly to a discrepancy between what they desire (ought) and what they
perceive as being realized (is) in terms of justice.
Of the several consequences of procedural

justice that have been predicted
theoretically or identiﬁed empirically, we focus on two outcome variables that are
considered most

psychosomatic well-being. Both can be linked theoretically to the sense of injustice
(Greenberg, 1996) and both are relevant for the individual as well as the economic
interests of the organization. It is assumed that the experience of injustice evokes
negative emotions (Mikula, 1993) and that the frequent experience of negative
emotions associated with work decreases job satisfaction and injures psychosomatic
well-being (Johnson, 1990).

To summarize, the present study was designed for testing the following hypotheses:

(1) Procedural injustice is correlated negatively with job satisfaction and positively

with sickness as an indicator of psychosomatic well-being.

(2) The person’s chronic justice sensitivity correlates positively with the ought
component and negatively with the is component of procedural justice judg-
ments. As a mathematical implication, a positive correlation is also expected for
the ought–is discrepancy.

(3) Justice sensitivity moderates the correlation of the person’s sense of injustice, as
reﬂected by the ought–is dierence, with job satisfaction and psychosomatic well-
being. More speciﬁcally, the correlation of perceived unfairness with satisfaction
and well-being is expected to be a positive linear function of justice sensitivity.

Design, research setting, subjects and procedure

METHOD

This research was conducted as a cross-sectional questionnaire ﬁeld study with
employees of a large German automobile company. Subjects were laborers who
worked in small autonomous groups. Approximately 600 individuals were invited to
participate. Individuals were approached during group meetings. Participation was
voluntary. Refusal rate was approximately 50%, leaving 295 subjects. Subjects were
handed a booklet containing all questionnaires in the following order: procedural
justice, job satisfaction, psychosomatic well-being, justice sensitivity. Questionnaires
were ﬁlled in individually and anonymously.

Measurement instruments

Procedural justice

Based on previous research experiences of our group (unpublished) and informal
interviews conducted prior to this study with a sample of 40 employees, none of
whom participated in this study, Leventhal’s (1980) model was chosen for capturing
the subject’s sense of procedural
justice. Leventhal’s rules include: consistency,
nonpartiality, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, adherence to ethical and
moral standards. The last criterion was substituted by the principle of open
information. This rule was added because it was mentioned frequently by employees
during the preliminary interviews, whereas the last Leventhal rule was hardly ever
mentioned. Each principle was operationalized by ﬁve items, for example:
. Consistency: the evaluation of peers should always be based on the same criteria.
. Nonpartiality: a superior should not prefer one subordinate over another.

. Accuracy: every available piece of information should be taken into account before

a decision is made.

. Correctability: if something is obviously wrong, everybody should make an eort

to correct it, no matter what it is.

. Representativeness: before a decision is made, the interests of everybody who is

aected should be considered carefully.

. Open information: bad news should not be disguised.

The 30 statements were mixed in a random order. Each statement was followed by
two questions and rating scales. The ﬁrst question (How important is this to you?)
served to measure the ought component. Six-point rating scales ranging from 1/rather
unimportant to 6/very important were used. The second question (How often is this
followed in your work?) was used for the is component. Six-point rating scales ranged
from 1/very rarely to 6/very often.

Justice sensitivity

Due to the limited amount of time granted by the management for this investigation,
only the intrusiveness indicator was used for measuring justice sensitivity. Schmitt
et al. (1995) report the highest convergent validity for this scale. It contains 19 items
each referring to a particular type of unfair treatment or deprivation and the tendency
of the person to ruminate about the event, for example: If I perform better than others
without getting any appreciation or reward, I cannot forget about it for a long time.
Items were combined with six-point rating scales reﬂecting the degree to which the
person accepts the statement as a valid description of the self (1/totally false to
6/totally true).

Job satisfaction

Five indicators were adopted from the literature (e.g. Neuberger, 1985) and rephrased
to ﬁt the speciﬁc context of the present study: (1) I enjoy the work I am doing. (2) I like
working in my group. (3) I would rather move to a new area. (4) I would rather go back to
my former area. (5) I consider quitting my current job. Six-point frequency rating scales
ranging from 1/never to 6/very often were used. Items 3 through 5 were recoded before
analyses.

Psychosomatic well-being

Psychosomatic well-being was operationalized as sickness and measured as (1) the
number of sick days during the last six months and (2) the number of days during the last
six months the person felt sick but nevertheless went to work.2 Although the ﬁrst item

2It may be objected against the ﬁrst indicator that employees take sick leave for reasons other than being
sick. Note that unlike in the United States and perhaps other countries, it is illegal according to German
law to take sick leave for reasons other than being sick. In fact, sickness has to be conﬁrmed by a medical
doctor if the person stays at home for more than two days. Of course, employees may fake sickness to the
doctor. However, this could either be interpreted as indicating a lack of satisfaction and well-being or it
may serve the function of getting even with procedural unfairness (Greenberg, 1996; Marr, 1996). Both
interpretations do not contradict the construct validity of this indicator.

(number of sick days) is an objective indicator, it had to be measured via self-report.
The union was opposed to disclosing any personal data from the workers’ ﬁles
although a procedure was suggested that would have guaranteed total anonymity.

RESULTS

Factorial structure, internal consistency and distribution of the measures

Simultaneous factor analysis

In a ﬁrst analysis, all items were submitted to a simultaneous principle axes analysis.
The ﬁrst four eigenvalues amounted to: 17.9; 11.9; 7.9; 2.1. Cattell’s (1966) scree
criterion suggests three common factors. After varimax rotation to simple structure,
the loading pattern was straightforward: The ﬁrst factor loaded all is items with
loadings above 0.50. It also loaded, with loadings below 0.36, all outcome items (job
satisfaction and psychosomatic well-being). The second factor loaded all ought items
with loadings exceeding 0.36. The third factor loaded all justice sensitivity items with
loadings exceeding 0.52. Secondary loadings were never close in size to primary
loadings.

Separate factor and internal consistency analyses

Separate factor analyses were conducted for the ought items, the is items, the justice
sensitivity items and the job satisfaction items. According to the scree criterion, all
four scales are one-dimensional. The dierence between the ﬁrst and the second
eigenvalues is always very large and no further scree appears. Accordingly, internal
consistency coe(cid:129)cients alpha were high in relation to the length of the scales: ought
(0.93), is (0.97), justice sensitivity (0.95), job satisfaction (0.69).

A separate factor analysis was also conducted with the synthetic ought–is items
(dierence scores). Again, these items have only one factor in common and a very
high internal consistency of 0.96.

Next, the correlation between the two sickness variables was determined. The low
value of 0.14 shows that both indicators overlap only to a small degree, the most likely
reason being the intrinsic negative interdependence of both measures: on a given day,
a person cannot feel sick at work and stay home. Because of the low correlation, it
seems necessary to regress both indicators separately on the justice variables.
Additionally, both indicators were added to obtain a more reliable sickness index.
The sum of raw scores was chosen instead of averaging standard scores because both
variables were measured on the same natural frequency metric (number of days).
Since the number of sick days varied much less than the number of days felt sick, the
sum correlates more with the former component than with the latter (Table 1).

Distribution of the measures

Table 1 contains the means and standard deviations of the measures. The ought scale
is negatively skewed with subjects tending to consider procedural justice important.

The distribution of the is scale is bell-shaped. As a mathematical implication, the
ought–is scale is positively skewed. A slight negative skewness was obtained for the
justice sensitivity scale with subjects tending to be justice sensitive. The average job
satisfaction was high implying negative skewness. The mean number of sick days was
much lower than the mean number of days the person worked despite feeling unwell.
Both distributions and the distribution of the sum of both indicators (sickness) were
positively skewed.

Correlations among the variables

Hypotheses 1 and 2 can be tested by the bivariate correlations in Table 1. Most
correlations are consistent with the ﬁrst hypothesis. In line with expectations, pro-
cedural injustice, as reﬂected by the ought–is dierence, correlates negatively with job
satisfaction and positively with the sickness variables. The correlation with sick days
is not signiﬁcant, however.

The second hypothesis was entirely supported by the results. As expected, justice
sensitivity has a positive correlation with the ought component (0.16), a negative
correlation with the is component ((cid:255)0.19) and again a positive correlation with the
ought–is discrepancy (0.24).

Moderated regression analyses

Hypothesis 3 was tested via moderated regression analysis (Aiken & West, 1991).
The ought–is dierence served as the predictor variable, justice sensitivity as the
moderator variable. Job satisfaction, sick days, days felt sick and sickness were the
dependent variables. A separate analysis was conducted for each dependent variable.
Analyses revealed two signiﬁcant interaction eects. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant eect
occurred when days felt sick was used as the dependent variable [F(1,238) (cid:136) 5.23,

0.18 (main eects of predictor and moderator) to 0.24. The second signiﬁcant
interaction of justice sensitivity (cid:2) ought–is appeared when sickness, i.e. the sum of sick
days and days felt sick, was taken as the criterion [F(1,240) (cid:136) 5.67, p 5 0.05)]. In this
case, R went up from 0.19 to 0.24 when the product term was added to the main eect
model. Both eects are thus almost identical in size. Furthermore, both interaction
eects accord in direction with the hypothesis. In order to illustrate this, the moderator
eect with respect to days felt sick is displayed in Figure 1. It is su(cid:129)cient to display one
of the two eects because the other eect is almost identical. The two regression lines in
Figure 1 describe the conditional eect of ought–is on days felt sick for subjects scoring
one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the sample mean of
justice sensitivity.3 It can be seen that the eect of the ought–is dierence increases with
increasing justice sensitivity.

DISCUSSION

In line with theoretical predictions (Hypothesis 1) and other studies, procedural justice
was found to correlate with job satisfaction and sickness as two important indicators
of work-related well-being. The more that employees feel treated fairly at work, the
more they are satisﬁed with their job, the lower is their absenteeism and the more they

3Note that the regression lines are ﬁtted regression lines that deviate from the conditional sample means of
the dependent variable. The dependent variable cannot have negative values. The negative conditional
expectations for the dependent variable are due to its skewed distribution. For this reason, nonlinear
conditional regression eects were tested, but these eects were not signiﬁcant. Therefore, the model
containing only linear conditional regression eects was accepted.

feel healthy when working. This result gains signiﬁcance in light of the low correlations
between job satisfaction and psychosomatic well-being. Although these correlations
are consistent in direction, with a low job satisfaction corresponding to more sickness,
they are very small and not signiﬁcant (Table 1). This ﬁnding is consistent with results
from a meta-analysis of the relation between job satisfaction and achievement (Six &
Eckes, 1991). Obviously, sickness has many causes that are unrelated to work and that
have no direct impact on job satisfaction. However, it might be premature to conclude
from the low correlations that both outcome variables have distinct antecedents. It is
possible, for instance, that job satisfaction and sickness do share some factors but
reﬂect dierent styles of dealing with the situation. For instance, dissatisfaction
follows from a cognitive judgment and requires that some ought–is discrepancy, not
necessarily related to justice, has been detected. Furthermore, the dissatisfaction items
3, 4, 5 imply options for change. By contrast, feeling sick or getting sick does not
require a conscious awareness of distress and may stem, at least partly, from feelings of
helplessness and from lacking alternatives to the current job. The results of our study
suggest that job satisfaction and psychosomatic well-being, although not being related
to each other, may indeed have common factors, since we were able to identify at least
one common covariate: procedural
justice. This ﬁnding adds to the theoretical
repertoire of organizational psychology which has been concerned primarily with job
satisfaction and absenteeism and may pay too little attention to personality and social
interaction factors underlying both outcome variables simultaneously.

The relevance of procedural justice in work might be questioned because its
correlations with the outcome variables are low. While the correlation between
injustice (ought–is) and job satisfaction is moderate ((cid:255)0.35), the correlations between
injustice and the sickness variables are low with the highest correlation amounting to
0.17. The size of the correlations can be discussed from a practical and from a scientiﬁc
point of view. Regarding practical implications, the regression lines in Figure 1 show
that the dierence in number of days a worker felt sick at work varies from about 0 to
25 for the smallest and the largest empirical discrepancy between ought and is.
Assuming that the performance of an employee who feels sick at work is lower than the
performance of an employee who feels well, the economic consequences of procedural
fairness may be substantial. From a scientiﬁc perspective, the small correlation
between perceived injustice and sickness is hardly surprising for two reasons. First,
physical illness has multifold causes and a strong correlation with any single factor
cannot be expected. Second, psychosocial variables as the one investigated here do not
have direct eects on health. Rather, the impact of distress is mediated and dispersed
by biological mechanisms (Friczewski, Mascrhewsky, Naschold & Wotschack, 1982)
and moderated by psychological factors such as coping style (Klauer & Filipp, 1993).
As a second objection, it might be argued that the correlation between self-reported
unfairness, job satisfaction and self-reported sickness is spurious due to common
causes such as the general complaint proneness (Brose, 1982). This hypothesis cannot
be excluded with data from the present study because complaint proneness and other
third variables that may cause the spurious correlation at issue were not measured
and can thus not be controlled for statistically. However, data from ﬁeld experiments
(e.g. Greenberg, 1996) have clearly shown that procedural unfairness has a causal
eect on outcome variables that are functionally equivalent to those obtained here.
A second major goal of the present research was to explore the role of chronic justice
sensitivity (Hypotheses 2 and 3). In line with theoretical predictions, justice sensitivity

correlated positively with the ought component and negatively with the is component
of procedural justice judgments and therefore positively with the ought–is discrepancy
as well. Furthermore, support was obtained for the conjecture that justice sensitivity
moderates the correlation between procedural fairness and well-being. This latter
result suggests that it might be useful to include justice sensitivity as an organismic
factor in experimental justice research. Given the present ﬁndings, it seems likely that
justice sensitivity will amplify the eects of experimental justice manipulations on
emotion and behavior (Schmitt & Mohiyeddini, 1996; Mohiyeddini & Schmitt, 1997).
The present ﬁndings suggest that such a moderator eect would include two psycho-
logical mechanisms. (1) Justice-sensitive individuals seem to have a lower perceptual
threshold for the violation of justice norms. Consequently, it is more likely for them
than for insensitive individuals to detect unfair distributions or procedures in experi-
mental settings. (2) In addition, justice seems to be a more central concern for justice
sensitive individuals than to insensitive persons. Accordingly, the emotional and
motivational impact of perceived injustice should increase with the person’s justice
sensitivity. Therefore, a justice-sensitive individual will probably invest more eort in
restoring justice than an insensitive individual even if both evaluate a given situation as
equally unfair.
