 INTANGIBLE CAPITAL ASPECTS OF

 ADVERTISING AND R&D EXPENDITURES

 MARK HIRSCHEY*

 Twenty years have passed since economists first emphasized the "intangible
 capital" aspects of advertising. According to this view, ". . . consumers tend
 to forget brands and continuous advertising is needed to maintain a given rate
 of sales. Thus, advertising expenditures can be viewed as a capital good that
 depreciates over time and needs maintenance and repair [22, p. 197]." More
 recently, Weiss [25], among others, has suggested that research and devel-
 opment, R&D, costs might also be capitalized as such expenditures ". . . yield
 benefits mainly in the future [25, p. 421]." Unfortunately, most analyses of
 the intangible capital issue have been limited to advertising largely because no
 comprehensive data on R&D were available until quite recently. However,
 important recent theoretical contributions on the topic and improvements in
 data availability now make it possible more completely to consider the intang-
 ible capital aspects of both advertising and R&D expenditures.

 Here the intangible capital issue is investigated through use of a market
 valuation model. In this approach, significant future (intangible capital) ef-
 fects of advertising and R&D are suggested to the extent that current ex-
 penditures have significant effects on the market value of the firm. Given
 positive market value influences, individual coefficient estimates can be used
 to estimate both the total stock of intangible capital as well as average annual
 depreciation rates for advertising and R&D. While these depreciation rate
 estimates are interfirm averages and undoubtedly err in individual instances,
 they can be quite useful in indicating the general magnitude of corporate
 profit and tax misstatement due to current reporting and tax policies.

 In section I below, various articles closely related to this study are reviewed.
 Section II develops a valuation model embodying intangible capital consider-
 ations. The data are discussed in section III, and estimation results are presen-
 ted in section IV. And finally, conclusions and implications for public policy
 are discussed in section V.

 I. PREVIOUS STUDIES

 Previous studies attempting empirically to define the magnitude of the long-
 lived aspects of advertising expenditures have focused on a distributed lag

 relationship between current product sales and advertising expenditures [see
 5]. Results have been ambiguous. Peles [15] found significant future effects of
 advertising in beer and cigarettes, but not in automobiles. Abdel-Khalik [1],
 however, found evidence of long-lived effects for firms in food and in drugs
 and cosmetics, but not for tobacco and soap and cleansers firms. Schmalensee
 [20] examined the advertising effect on sales for both the cigarette industry as
 a whole and its individual firms and reported different effects for the various
 companies and for the industry in general. Like Schmalensee, Falk and Miller
 [8] also found nonuniform patterns of amortization of advertising ex-
 penditures for individual firms in the same industry. Brown [4] has concluded
 that such interfirm differences may be due, in part, to the age of the product
 promoted as the returns to promoting appear to be greater for new as opposed
 to older products. In reviewing previous studies, Picconi [ 17] found it trouble-
 some that even among the most heavily advertised products, a systematic
 relationship between advertising and sales or market share cannot consistently
 be found. Even more discouraging than this finding, Clarke discovered that
 the average implied duration interval derived from annual data is more than
 17 times as long as the average implied duration interval derived from
 monthly data! Needless to say, this conflicting body of empirical evidence has
 not resolved the policy question of whether to capitalize or expense advertis-
 ing expenditures. These ambiguous results, however, are quite understandable
 if one considers various theoretical and empirical problems of previous meth-
 ods. First, an almost exclusive emphasis has been placed upon an individual
 item's sales related or "product" advertising, while the importance of a firm's
 aggregate level of product and "institutional" advertising has been ignored.
 Certainly the product advertising for an individual item can be expected to
 have an important influence on its demand, but institutional advertising which
 is expected to improve the firm's image or aid the firm in its interactions with
 the public may also be important [see 18]. For example, the fact that "Body
 by Fisher" constitutes a "mark of excellence" undoubtedly contributes to the
 sales of the entire line of General Motors products. In a similar fashion,
 advertisements emphasizing the quality of Buick cars undoubtedly improve
 public perceptions of Chevrolet. Therefore, both institutional and product
 advertising might reasonably be expected to result in beneficial "spillover"
 effects. Such spillover effects will cause a weakening of the sales-product ad-
 vertising relationship for an individual product and cause one to draw poss-
 ibly erroneous conclusions regarding the importance and/or durability of ad-
 vertising expenditures.

 A second problem with previous methods is that they do not fully reflect the
 multipurpose goals of advertising. It is generally agreed that product advertis-
 ing is an attempt to move the consumer from an unawareness of product
 existence, to a favorable attitude towards the product, to an eventual pur-
 chase decision-in other words, increase sales. On the other hand, institution-
 al advertising may have quite different objectives. With institutional advertis-
 ing the firm addresses the public not only as consumers or potential buyers of

 its products, but also as voters on public policy issues important to the firm, as
 actual or potential shareholders, and as employees [18]. Rather than increas-
 ing sales, such advertising would seem directed towards reducing costs. Based
 on these observations, one might argue that the firm's overall objective in
 advertising is profit. It achieves this objective through sales related product
 advertising, and institutional advertising aimed at both increasing sales and
 reducing costs. To avoid measurement errors, analyses of advertising effective-
 ness must consider the complete body of intended effects.

 A third difficulty with previous research is that only aggregate media ex-

 penditures are considered. This leaves possible differential media influences
 ignored. In designing an advertising program firms have a wide choice of
 media to choose among. Comanor and Wilson [6], Mueller and Rogers [14],
 and Porter [19] have all suggested that the mix of advertising media adopted
 by sellers will have important implications for the level of intangible advertis-
 ing investment required for new firms ". . . to achieve parity with going firms
 [19, p. 401]." They argue that the advantages to advertisers over existing and
 potential competitors will be greater where the going firm competes and
 advertises nationally (as opposed to locally) because of the large sums required
 for national media, especially television, advertising. Importantly, Porter
 found greater profitability effects for television as opposed to,other forms of
 media advertising. Thus, it seems that the possibility of differential media
 influences is well worth considering.

 Statistical problems have presented a fourth problem for previous studies of

 advertising effectiveness. In particular, high multicollinearity between current
 and past levels of advertising expenditures has reduced the validity of tech-
 niques employed. In fact, Picconi concluded that the distributed lag approach
 is inappropriate for determining long-term advertising effectiveness. At a
 minimum, Clarke suggests that alternatives to the distributed lag models
 should be sought. He suggests that new approaches ". . . should (1) be more
 robust in the parameters which measure the cumulative advertising effect, (2)
 be derived from more realistic models of advertising effect, and (3) be less
 sensitive to data interval bias [5, p. 356]."

 Finally, the understandable failure to consider research expenditures in

 previous studies of advertising creates the possibility of specification bias. In
 support of Weiss' early suggestion of intangible capital aspects of R&D ex-
 penditures, Grabowski and Mueller [9] found that R&D expenditures like
 advertising expenditures have a large and consistent positive effect on firm
 profit rates. With various depreciation rates of between 5 and 20 percent per
 year, they indicated after-tax returns on R&D of between 15 and 20 percent.
 Since such returns are significantly above average returns earned on tangible
 investments, support is gained for Comanor and Wilson's observation that
 intangible capital may have a substantial required rate of return as no tang-
 ible asset is created which may be sold in the event of failure. Therefore, there
 appears to be ample theoretical as well as empirical justification for consider-
 ing the profitability influences of advertising and R&D expenditures jointly.

 Of course, failure to do so will tend to be most serious for firms in industries
 which are both advertising and R&D intensive (e.g., pharmaceuticals).

 Measuring Intangible Capital

 II. METHODOLOGY

 Since potentially important advertising and R&D capital are of an intangible
 and unobservable nature, an econometric problem is encountered in measuring
 their empirical relevance. Given only modest assumptions, however, it can
 easily be shown that there is a strictly proportional relationship between
 observable advertising and R&D expenditures, and unobservable advertising
 and R&D capital. Earlier studies [15, 25] have assumed that advertising
 depreciation is of the "evaporation" variety, and is constant at a rate of, say, 6
 per cent per period. If a similar assumption may be made concerning R&D
 capital, then

 00

 (la) ICt = E (1 -)it_i)

 i=O

 (lb) = (1 - 6)01t.o + Z (1 -)it_)

 i=l1
 (Ic) = It + (1 - 6)ICt-1.

 Where It refers to advertising and R&D expenditure levels during period t,
 and ICt is the total level of intangible advertising and R&D capital.

 If 0 < 6 <)1, then a portion of advertising and R&D expenditures in the
 current period will carry over to subsequent periods and constitute an invest-
 ment in intangible capital. On the other hand, if 6 = 1, then advertising and
 R&D expenditures would have an influence during the current period only,
 and should be expensed rather than capitalized.

 The effect of expenditure growth (net investment) over time can easily be
 incorporated into the analysis. Where advertising and R&D expenditures
 grow at a constant rate y per cent per period, It = Io(l + y)t.l Then, from
 equation (1 a) we can write

 (2a) ICt = E (1 - )io(l + y)t-i,

 00

 i=O

 oo

 (2b) = E (1 - )It(1 + Y)-i,

 i=O

 (2c) = i Q

 1 The assumption of a constant y is made to simplify the analysis. Nevertheless, Weiss sugges-
 ted that this assumption is "not wildly wrong in any case." In support of this assertion, Weiss
 reported a mean R' of .58 for logarithmic trends (log ads to time) for a sample of 32 IRS "minor
 industries."

 and since (1 1-()1(1 + Y) < 1, we can apply the power series rule and simplify
 to yield

 (2d) ICt = It

 1_ +y

 (2e) = It +Y

 This equation identifies the constant and proportional relationship ICt = fIt,
 which exists between intangible capital and current levels of expenditures
 where f = (1 + y)/(b + v).2 It follows that both advertising and R&D capital
 will be proportionate to current advertising and R&D expenditures, i.e.,
 ACt = fADADt and RCt = fR&DR&Dt. Importantly, amortization will only
 be appropriate should Pi > 1, since only then will 0 < at < 1.

 Of course, the above findings are of interest because they allow us to consi-

 der the market value effects of current advertising and R&D expenditures as
 indicative of the market value implications of intangible capital. Our testable
 hypothesis becomes

 (3a) MVt = f (ACt, RCt, Xt),

 (3b) = f (fADADt, fiR&DR&Dt, Xt).
 where f represents the relationship between the market value of the firm,
 MVt, advertising capital, R&D capital, advertising and R&D expenditures;
 and Xt, a vector of xi important determinants of firm market value which are
 neither advertising nor R&D related. Because all variables relate to the cur-
 rent period only, the subscript t can be dropped below without confusion.

 The Valuation Model

 On a theoretical basis, the market value of the firm represents the future profit
 stream discounted to the present at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of dis-
 count. On a practical basis, the market value of the firm is dependent upon
 various "indicators" of the firm's future profit potential. One such indicator is
 the level of firm investment in tangible capital. At any point in time this level
 will depend upon historical levels of investment, rates of physical and techno-
 logical depreciation, current opportunity costs, etc. Obviously, measuring the
 current level of tangible capital investment involves both theoretical and
 practical problems. While realizing the problem of understatement during
 inflationary periods, the accounting book value of the firm's capital invest-

 2 In a recent article Ben-Zion [2] asserted a similar proportional relationship, but one where
 p = 1/(b + y). This assertion is only valid, however, if y can be considered "small" in relation to
 3 + y. In light of commonly observed y's of .10 to .15 and previous estimates by Peles of b's in the
 .35 to .50 range, Ben-Zion's assertion seems inappropriate.

 ment, BV, will be adopted here. Current profits, xt, provides an additional
 important indicator of a firm's profit potential. It has been suggested by
 Thomadakis [23], for example, that in a capital market which evaluates all
 available information about the future profitability of the firm, market value
 will exceed the cost of investment to the extent that ex ante rates of return
 exceed competitive norms. Advertising and R&D expenditures will also con-
 stitute important determinants of firm market value to the extent that such
 expenditures result in the creation of an economically relevant amount of
 intangible capital. In order that the possibly differential market value effects
 of various media, particularly television advertising, may emerge, alternative
 aggregations of total advertising expenditures, ADi, will be considered. In all
 cases

 n

 EADi = AD.
 i=l1

 The above considerations suggest a basic valuation model of the following

 form:

 (4) MV =a1+ aoBV + a2 + a3 R&D + ai ADi + u

 i=l1

 n

 Direct estimation of such a form, however, would undoubtedly be hampered
 by both multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity problems as each variable is
 heavily influenced by characteristics related to firm size. If such influences can
 be taken as proportionate with size as measured by firm book value [e.g., see
 13], we may write

 MV 1 it R&D n AD
 (5) - =aO+aVBv + BV BV BV

 where u* = u/BV and as assumed to be homoskedastic.

 The dependent variable MV/BV described above has an important econ-
 omic interpretation when viewed as an approximation to "Tobin's q" ratio.
 Tobin's q is defined as the market value of the firm divided by the replacement
 cost value of total assets. Originally, Tobin proposed this measure as an
 indicator of a firm's propensity to invest in new plant and equipment [e.g., see
 24]. According to Tobin, when q > 1 firms will expand total investment in
 order to increase the total economic residual earned by stockholders. Whereas
 q > 1 creates an obvious incentive for firm expansion, q < 1 creates an equally
 obvious incentive for firm contraction.

 The use of approximations to Tobin's q in industrial organization is a fairly
 recent phenomena. Lindenberg and Ross [12], for example, have suggested
 that they can be most useful in indicating the extent to which stockholders
 capitalize rents attributable to invested capital, firm-specific factors and
 market power. While this analysis focuses on the roles played by advertising

 and R&D expenditures as firm-specific factors affecting the MV/BV ratio,
 such influences cannot be considered in isolation. To a degree, equation (5)
 allows for the effects of invested capital and market power through the 1/BV
 and r/BV variables. Because this allowance is imperfect at best, it seems quite
 reasonable to offer an expanded valuation model which more explicitly deals
 with the effects of invested capital and market power.

 Clearly, historical rates of return not only reflect the effects of market
 power, but also the effects of past investment decisions and firm-specific fac-
 tors as well. Nevertheless, when analyzing data for widely diversified firms,
 rates of return can capture market power influences partially obscured by
 primary product or weighted average concentration ratios. Concentration
 ratios for a firm's primary product industry are only a poor measure of market
 power at the firm level because many firms operate in several industries, with
 primary product sales often representing less than 50 percent of a firm's total.
 Even weighted concentration ratios reflecting firm involvement in a number
 of industries can fail to capture market power influences since critical con-
 centration ratio considerations are neglected. Of these problems associated
 with mapping industry concentration and firm operating data, those associ-
 ated with diversification seem most serious. Despite these limitations, the
 effects of a firm's weighted four-firm concentration ratio, CR, will be con-
 sidered as an additional important indicator of market power influences on
 the value of the firm. Some collinearity problems are obvious, but unavoid-
 able.

 In addition to dealing with estimation problems concerning the effects of
 market power, it seems reasonable to address measurement errors related to
 the use of accounting data. A potential method for dealing with differences
 among firms in the impact of inflation on accounting book values is to consi-
 der the effect of growth, GR, on market value. It seems reasonable that
 rapidly growing firms will have newer plant and equipment whose book
 values more closely correspond with economic values than do the book values
 of less dynamic firms with older tangible investment. One might expect,
 therefore, that GR will have a negative "accounting" effect in regressions
 where BV is also entered. Confounding this influence, however, is the fact that
 past growth rates are undoubtedly used by investors to form expectations
 concerning future growth in economic rents and rental opportunities. A priori
 it is difficult to predict whether the negative accounting effect will be over-
 whelmed by positive "signalling" effects. Because such influences can tend to
 cancel one another out, the net effect of GR on market value is uncertain.

 And finally, in considering the market value effects of invested capital,

 firm-specific factors and market power it is necessary to control for the ex-
 pected level of investor risk. While investor risk is often measured in terms of
 stock-price beta, Ben-Zion and Shalit [3] present an attractive alternative
 based upon the Standard & Poor's ranking of earnings and dividend stability
 where A +, A, . . . D, NR is translated into a numerical scale 1, 2, . . . 8, 9.

 Ben-Zion and Shalit found this measure attractive as it reflects the assessment
 of risk by investment agencies and other practitioners operating in the stock
 market. Because required rates of return can be expected to rise as the risk, R,
 of the anticipated profit stream increases, the discounted present (market)
 value effect of increased R will be negative.

 Therefore, the valuation model which will be tested below in an attempt to
 isolate the intangible capital effects of advertising and R&D expenditures can
 be written

 (6) BV = + 1 BV + 2 BV + P3CR+ P4GR

 where it is expected that f2, f3, P6, pi > 0; f5 < 0; while f1 and f4 are
 uncertain.

 III. THE DATA

 In developing an appropriate sample it would seem desirable to include firms
 which both do and do not spend substantial amounts on advertising and
 R&D. With this consideration in mind, the Fortune 500 for 1977 was adopted
 as a sample basis for this study. Several observations had to be dropped due to
 missing or incomplete data. Complete data were obtained on a representative
 sample of 390 firms from 12 major product groups. Approximately $5.0 billion
 in national media advertising and $15.2 billion in R&D expenditures were
 undertaken by sample firms. Not surprisingly, this sample provides a better
 coverage of total R&D expenditures (87.3 percent) than of national media
 advertising (23.9 percent).3 Nevertheless, coverage of both is quite high. Six
 categories of national media advertising are covered, including: network tele-
 vision, spot television, newspaper, magazine, radio and outdoor billboard
 advertising. This level of media aggregation will prove quite useful in testing
 for media differences in valuation effects. In particular, previous studies sug-
 gest lower rates of depreciation for television advertising since targeted audi-
 ences tend to be geographically stable.

 Accounting data on net income, sales and the book value of total assets were

 all obtained from Fortune. Interest expenses were added to net income in order
 to construct a profit variable which reflects returns to all holders of firm
 securities. Interest expense data were obtained from Standard and Poor's

 3 The Fortune 500 excludes retailers, for example, many of whom (Sears, McDonalds, etc.) are

 major advertisers.

 Compustat tapes. Four-firm concentration ratios weighted to reflect firm sales
 in various four-digit census industries were originally compiled by Economic
 Information Systems (EIS) Inc. and generously made available to this study
 by Kenneth M. Harlan. Unfortunately, while all firm data relate to 1977, the
 latest census data available at the time this analysis was undertaken were for
 1972. Thus, weighted census concentration ratios used here are largely for
 1972. In some instances, classification problems required the use of 1967 data.
 While it would obviously be preferable to use concentration data for 1977,
 concentration ratios are highly correlated over time and any-reduction in the
 market value effects of conicentration due to measurement errors should be
 minimal. And finally, all advertising data had Leading National Advertisers as its
 source, while R&D expenditures were obtained from Business Week. Individ-
 ual variables are defined as follows:

 MV/BV is market value deflated by book value calculated as the ratio of
 the market value of common plus book value of debt all divided
 by the book value of total assets.

 1/BV is deflated book value calculated as the inverse of the book

 value of total assets.

 r/BV is profitability calculated as net income plus interest expense all

 divided by the book value of total assets.

 CR is concentration calculated at the four-firm level and weighted
 to reflect firm involvement in various four-digit census indus-
 tries.

 GR is growth in terms of sales calculated as -1.

 R is risk as reflected by earnings and dividend stability where
 A +, A ... D, NR is translated into a numerical scale 1, 2, ...
 8,9.

 R&D/BV is R&D expenditures deflated by book value and is calculated
 as the ratio of R&D expenditures divided by the book value of
 total assets.

 AD/BV is advertising expenditures deflated by book value and is calcu-
 lated as the ratio of total national media advertising divided by
 the book value of total assets.

 A correlation matrix for the variables described above is included in Table
 I. Correlations for the television, TV, and nontelevision, NTV, portions of
 total advertising are also reported as these variables are also included in the
 analysis below.

 advertising expenditures are divided into their television and non-television
 advertising components in order that intermedia influences might be evalu-
 ated.

 Estimation results for the valuation model using total advertising ex-
 penditures indicate significant explanatory power for the aggregate advertis-
 ing form of the valuation model (equation (6)). On the basis of individual
 coefficient estimates, current profit rates seem to constitute an important
 positive and highly significant determinant of the market value of the firm. As
 suggested above, such effects may have efficiency or market power related
 sources. Somewhat surprisingly, neither concentration nor growth had indi-
 vidually significant influences. These results should be interpreted cautiously,
 however, as they probably reflect measurement and collinearity problems
 rather than indicate an irrelevance of market power and growth related influ-
 ences. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the accounting and signalling effects

 of growth rates on market values can tend to offset one another. Risk has the
 expected negative and significant effect. This finding supports use of the Ben-
 Zion and Shalit variable as an empirically relevant descriptor of risk.4

 Quite robust results for the effects of advertising and R&D expenditures on

 market value were obtained. Here we find support for their treatment as
 intangible capital since each has a highly significant positive influence on
 market value. Indeed, we can reject the null hypothesis that each variable is
 less than one (Ho: p3i < 1) at the a = .01 level. As a result, each coefficient
 estimate (/6 and /7, respectively) has an important interpretation in econom-
 ic terms since they can be used to derive advertising and R&D depreciation
 rate estimates for the Fortune sample.5 In equation (2e) we concluded that
 ICt = PJIt, where ,B = (1 + y)/(b + y). It follows that 3 = (1 + y - y)/fl.
 Therefore, average depreciation rate estimates, 's, for both R&D and adver-
 tising capital can be made using /6 and f7, given appropriate expenditure
 growth rate estimates, y's. For a given coefficient estimate, low (high) ^'s will
 result in high (low) $'s. Because S's are sensitive to even small changes in i's,
 the reader may wish to construct a range of S's on the basis of various assump-
 tions regarding "true" y. Here historical rates of growth in nominal R&D and
 advertising expenditures are used to generate j's. To the extent 's are below
 (above) long-term growth rates, S's will be above (below) long-term deprecia-
 tion rates.6 In light of recent growth rates for R&D expenditures of 8.8
 percent over the 1974 to 1977 period (firm data were unavailable before
 1974), an average depreciation rate for R&D of 25.8 percent per year is
 indicated. Similarly, recent growth in national media advertising of 12.3
 percent per year over the 1972 to 1977 period indicates an average yearly rate
 of advertising depreciation of 28.8 percent. This estimate for advertising de-
 preciation is in the middle of the range estimated in previous studies surveyed
 by Comanor and Wilson [7], while a R&D depreciation rate of roughly 25
 percent per year is above Grabowski and Mueller's recent presumption of a 10
 percent rate.

 In order to consider possibly important media influences the valuation
 model was also estimated with total advertising divided into its television and
 non-television advertising components (equation (6b)). While both of the
 television and non-television components of national media advertising seem

 4 Interestingly, estimation results for the variables of primary interest were quite insensitive to

 the risk measure adopted. Nearly identical results were found for the R & D/BV and ADJBV
 coefficients irrespective of whether the Ben-Zion and Shalit or stock-price beta measure was
 adopted.

 5 Only the total of national spot and network television advertising will be considered below

 since rates for national television ads vary little between the spot and network categories [see 16].

 6 Of course, b's would rise substantially if growth rates for real as opposed to nominal ex-
 penditures were adopted. Growth rates for nominal expenditures were used in order that re-
 sulting b's could be interpreted in terms of historical rather than replacement costs. This should
 facilitate comparisons of the results reported here with previous studies, as well as with common
 accounting data and standards.

 ADVERTSING AND R&D EXPENDITURES 387

 to have positive effects on market value, only the television advertising effect is
 statistically significant (and highly so). Therefore, the case for treating tele-
 vision advertising as intangible capital is far stronger than that for other types
 of advertising promotion. Given a recent 13.1 percent rate of growth in tele-
 vision advertising, an average depreciation rate of 21.1 percent per year is
 indicated. Thus, somewhat lower depreciation and a longer economic "life" is
 suggested for television advertising than for advertising in general. These
 results are consistent with previous suggestions concerning the superior ef-
 fectiveness of television advertising (see [10], [14], [19]). A lesser deprecia-
 tion rate for television advertising may be explained by the fact that television
 advertising addresses a diverse and broadly distributed population where
 rates of potential customer turnover can be lower than for other forms of
 media promotion (see [16]).

 The reader must exercise caution in interpreting the advertising and R&D
 depreciation rate estimates developed above. First, they are interfirm averages
 and could tend to vary according to the type of buyer addressed (consumer
 goods versus producer goods) as well as according to a firm's technological
 environment (or technological opportunity). Second, as Peles has pointed out,
 advertising depreciation will tend to be lower for large as opposed to small
 firms because larger firms address a larger and therefore more geographically
 stable audience. And third, with high inflation economic depreciation rates
 will be lower than in a stable price environment due to "replacement cost"
 effects. Thus, advertising and R&D depreciation rates will tend to be lower
 during the highly inflationary environment experienced in the late 1970's (our
 sample period). On balance, the depreciation rates estimated above should
 only be taken as rough estimates and may be somewhat less than "true"
 economic depreciation rates.

 And finally, the findings reported here may have important public policy
 implications. From equation (6a) we see that R&D capital will be roughly
 two and one-half times current expenditures and advertising capital will be
 roughly three times current levels of advertising. In light of current (1977)
 R&D and national media advertising expenditures of $15.2 and $5.0 billion,
 the stock of intangible capital enjoyed by Fortune 500 firms is estimated at
 $47.8 billion for R&D and $13.8 billion for advertising. If only television
 advertising is considered (using equation (6b)), the Fortune 500 stock of in-
 tangible capital due to advertising falls to $12.4 billion. On an overall basis,
 total 1977 private R&D and national media advertising expenditures indicate
 an accumulated national stock of $54.7 billion in R&D capital and $57.6
 billion in advertising capital (using equation (6a)). Again, care must be taken
 in interpreting these admittedly rough estimates (see above). Nevertheless, the
 total stock of intangible capital may be quite substantial. As pointed out by
 several authors (e.g., [21]), tax laws which permit an expensing of capital
 items result in substantial tax subsidies for affected firms. Currently, the

 annual tax subsidy for expensing versus capitalization will generally equal 38
 percent of the amount of net investment per year.7 While eliminating such tax
 subsidies could prove formidable, Weiss has suggested that conservative de-
 preciation guidelines for intangible capital could be established which pru-
 dently err on the side of short lives as they currently do for tangible capital. He
 states that such a change should improve the equity of the tax system and the
 accuracy of corporate accounts.8 The results reported here seem to support
 this view.

 IV. CONCLUSIONS

 This paper considers the intangible capital aspects of advertising and R&D
 expenditures through use of a market valuation approach. An empirical
 analysis finds that, on average, advertising and R&D expenditures have posi-
 tive and significant market value (intangible capital) effects. Admittedly
 rough average depreciation rate estimates for advertising are in the 20 to 30
 percent range, while an average R&D depreciation rate of approximately 25
 percent is indicated. However, because the intangible capital effects of adver-
 tising may stem from medium-associated influences of television advertising,
 the expensing versus capitalization issue is far from clear cut. Generally allow-
 ing firms to capitalize and depreciate both advertising and R&D expenditures
 is only appropriate to the extent that finding consistent future effects on
 average provides sufficient motivation. While such a tax policy would be
 consistent with current treatments of various classes of tangible capital invest-
 ment, a more precise policy would be to require the capitalization of television
 advertising and R&D expenditures, but withhold a decision concerning capi-
 talization of other forms of advertising until the duration of their influences is
 understood more fully. Furthermore, it may prove interesting in future re-

 7 This can easily be shown. Consider the following notation:

 S = Annual tax subsidy due to use of expensing versus capitalization option.

 TE = Annual tax using expensing option.
 Te = Annual tax using capitalization option.

 I = Annual net investment in intangible capital.
 it = Annual accounting profit before net intangible capital investment.
 m = Marginal tax rate.
 c = Investment tax credit rate.

 If TE = m(t - 1) and Te = mR - cI, an annual tax subsidy from expensing S = T- TE > 0
 will arise so long as m > c. Under current tax law m = 48 percent and c = 10 percent. Thus, the
 tax subsidy to expensing versus capitalization is 38 percent of annual net investment in intangible
 capital since:

 S = TC- TE,

 = mR - cI- m(t - 1),
 = (m-c)I,
 = (.48 - .10),
 = .38I.

 8 Accounting errors can create obvious obstacles to industrial organization research. For

 example, accounting errors relating to advertising depreciation make it difficult (if not imposs-
 ible) to learn whether price-cost margin effects of advertising reflect intangible capital or barrier
 to entry type influences (see [11]).

 search to also inquire whether or not rates of advertising and R&D deprecia-
 tion tend to vary over time or across industries. An obvious implication of
 findings reported here is that further investigations of the topic may be well-
 worthwhile.
