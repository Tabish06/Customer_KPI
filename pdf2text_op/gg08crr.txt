  ABSTRACT 
 When  a  firm  announces  a  significant  perma-
nent  layoff,  the  firm ’ s  reputation  among  key 
stakeholders  such  as  employees  and  investors 
suffers. However, what does this action mean 
for rival firms? How does the information con-
tained  in  a  layoff  announcement  by  one  firm 
transfer to the reputations of other firms in the 
industry?  Building  on  the  similarity  between 
the  reputation  formation  process  and  the  firm 
valuation  process,  we  use  stock  price  as  an 
aggregate measure of firm reputation in the eyes 
of  shareholders.  We  examine  how  changes  in 
the  announcing  firm ’ s  reputation  affect  the 
reputations  of  rival  firms,  through  changes  in 
their stock prices, in the same (contagion effect) 
or  opposite  (competitive  effect)  direction.  This 
paper examines a longitudinal sample of layoff 
announcements in the US oil and gas industry 
from  1989  to  1996.  Results  suggest  that 
reputation  effects  of  layoff  announcements 
spillover beyond the announcing ﬁ rm and extend 
to  other  firms  in  the  industry.  These  inter-
organizational reputation effects follow a con-
tagious process, that is, if shareholders respond 
negatively to a layoff announcement, they will 
exhibit  simultaneous  negative  reactions  for 
non-announcing  firms  and  that  the  negative 
effects  of  layoff  announcements  increase  with 
layoff  prevalence.  Furthermore,  we  find  that 
close  rivals  experience  a  dampening  of  the 
contagion effect, perhaps reflecting countervail-

ing  competitive  effects.  By  examining  layoff 
announcements  through  both  the  institutional 
reputation and resource-based lenses, our work 
begins  to  reconcile  how  the  two  competing 
forces  of  cooperation  and  competition  work 
together to influence firm-level outcomes.

 INTRODUCTION 
 If  a  company  takes  an  action  that  enhances 
its  reputation,  how  does  that  action  reﬂ ect 
upon  other  companies  within  the  industry? 
For  example,  did Wal-Mart ’ s  announcement 
about  its  efforts  to  adopt   ‘ green ’   policies 
(Carey,  2007  )  reﬂ ect  positively  upon  other 
ﬁ rms  in  the  discount  retail  segment?  Or, 
alternatively,  did  the  announcement  make 
Wal-Mart ’ s  competitors,  such  as Target  and 
K-Mart  now  look  less  favorable  for  not 
explicitly  having  ‘ green ’   policies? Would  the 
same  dynamics  apply  when  a  ﬁ rm  experi-
ences an event that harms its reputation, such 
as the Menu Foods (a private label pet food 
manufacturer) pet food recall (Hansell, 2007  )? 
The  reputation  of  national  brands  such  as 
Purina (manufactured by Nestle) or Eukanuba 
(manufactured by Proctor  &  Gamble) might

become more favorable compared to private 
label  brands.  On  the  other  hand,  the  recall 
could make pet owners question the quality 
of  all  pet  food  manufacturers  and  threaten 
the  reputation  of  the  entire  industry. These 
examples illustrate the importance of under-
standing how one ﬁ rm ’ s actions have resonant 
effects on the reputations of its rivals. 

 In  this  paper,  we  speciﬁ cally  examine  the 
inter-organizational  reputation  effects  of  a 
controversial type of managerial action  –  the 
announcement of a permanent layoff. Layoffs 
may have positive or negative effects on a ﬁ rm 
and on shareholder value. Layoffs can enable 
an  organization  to  adjust  to  major  environ-
mental changes by reducing labor costs, elim-
inating  unneeded  levels  of  hierarchy  ( Love 
and  Nohria,  2005 )  and  streamlining  opera-
tions  ( Freeman  and  Cameron,  1993 ).  How-
ever,  layoffs  have  been  found  to  change 
survivors ’  attitudes toward their work, thereby 
compromising  performance  and  morale 
( Brockner, 1990 ). Eliminating jobs and people 
disrupts  organizational  routines  (Cameron   et 
al ., 1993)   and can result in outcomes such as 
reduced creativity ( Amabile and Conti, 1999 ), 
hindered new product development ( Dough-
erty  and  Bowman,  1995 )  and  compromised 
safety  ( Rinefort   et  al .,  1998 ).  Not  only  are 
such  outcomes  detrimental  but  also  the  ﬁ -
nancial cost savings from layoffs are often not 
as great as envisioned ( Cascio  et al ., 1997 ) and 
the  average  shareholder  reaction  to  a  layoff 
announcement  is  slightly  negative  (e.g.   Lee, 
1997 ;  Worrell  et al ., 1991 ). 

 Given  these  implications,  a  layoff  an-
nouncement is likely to impact the reputa-
tion of the announcing ﬁ rm in the eyes of 
critical  constituents   –   such  as  shareholders, 
employees, suppliers and local communities. 
If other ﬁ rms interact with the same set of 
constituents, one ﬁ rm ’ s announcement may 
also  inﬂ uence  how  stakeholders  view  non-
announcing ﬁ rms, that is, the competitors of 
the  announcing  ﬁ rm.  Intra-organizational 
reputational  effects  could  be  in  the  same 
direction  as  the  announcing  ﬁ rm,  in  the 

opposite  direction,  or  have  no  effect  at  all. 
We  seek  to  understand  these  dynamics  in 
this  paper. We  draw  upon  two  theoretical 
streams  of  literature  to  answer  our  research 
question.  These  two  perspectives  address 
the  inherent  tension  between  cooperation 
and competition between ﬁ rms ( Astley and 
Fombrun,  1983 )  and  provide  a  foundation 
to  understand  intra-organizational  reputa-
tional  dynamics  and  organizational  ﬁ eld-
level legitimacy. 

 The ﬁ rst perspective is Institutional Theo-
ry  which  suggests  that  organizations  exhibit 
similar  activities  and  structures  in  order  to 
maintain legitimacy with important constitu-
ents  ( DiMaggio  and  Powell,  1983 ;   Meyer 
and  Rowan,  1977 ).  Shared  cognitive  values 
within  an  organizational  ﬁ eld  help  to  shape 
expectations  about  organizational  actions 
( Rindova  and  Fombrun,  1999 )  and  these 
expectations inﬂ uence perceptions of reputa-
tion. Institutional Theory would predict that 
an individual ﬁ rm ’ s reputation is strongly in-
ﬂ uenced  by  the  shared  level  of  legitimacy 
within  the  organizational  ﬁ eld  in  which  it 
operates. In this instance, inter-organizational 
effects of an event that harms the reputation 
of the focal ﬁ rm would also harm the shared 
legitimacy  of  the  organizational  ﬁ eld,  and 
therefore  harm  the  ﬁ rm-level  reputation  of 
other organizational ﬁ eld members. 

 The  other  perspective  is  the  resource-
based  view  (or  RBV)  of  the  ﬁ rm  ( Barney, 
1991 ; Montgomery, 1995  ;  Wernerfelt, 1984 ). 
RBV theory suggests that a ﬁ rm ’ s competi-
tive  advantage  emanates 
from  valuable, 
unique and rare resources that are in limited 
supply. A  ﬁ rm  with  these  types  of  strategic 
resources can differentiate itself and achieve 
higher  levels  of  proﬁ tability  than  competi-
tors.  Under  RBV  theory,  reputation  is  a 
strategic resource  –   ‘ Competitive advantage 
results  from  uniqueness,  and  uniqueness  is 
measured by reputation ’  ( Barnett, 2006: 275 ). 
Contrary  to  the  institutional  emphasis  on 
ﬁ eld-level 
legitimacy,  RBV  emphasizes 
differences  in  ﬁ rm-level  reputations. While

 Understanding Competitive and Contagion Effects of Layoff Announcements 

reputation  is  not  necessarily  in  limited 
supply, its strategic value emerges when ﬁ rms 
in an industry have varying levels of reputa-
tion ( Deephouse, 2000 ). When an important 
group of stakeholders maintains a more posi-
tive reputation for a particular ﬁ rm relative 
to others, this provides a competitive advan-
tage to the ﬁ rm. If other ﬁ rms improve their 
reputation,  this  reduces  the  reputational 
difference and erodes the competitive advan-
tage.  In  this  way,  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation  is 
inﬂ uenced by the changes in the reputation 
of other ﬁ rms. 

 We will ﬁ rst present our central theoreti-
cal argument that the stock price of a pub-
lic ﬁ rm reﬂ ects the ﬁ rm ’ s reputation in the 
eyes  of  shareholders. We  then  propose  spe-
ciﬁ c hypotheses relating to layoff announce-
ments and their effect on the reputation of 
non-announcing ﬁ rms with respect to share-
holders.  Our  methodology,  analysis  and 
results using a sample of petroleum industry 
layoff announcements follow. 

 The  theoretical  framework  and  empirical 
evidence  presented  here  deepen  our  under-
standing  of  the  development  and  impact  of 
ﬁ rm  reputation  by  explicitly  demonstrating 
the  ﬁ eld  level  of  inﬂ uences  on  ﬁ rm  reputa-
tion.  Inter-organizational  reputational  effects 
emphasize  the  impact  ﬁ rm  actions  have  on 
the  entire  organizational  ﬁ eld  through  their 
effects on the perceptions of stakeholders. We 
are able to theoretically and empirically dis-
tinguish between the simultaneous coopera-
tive  and  competitive  forces  that  factor  into 
reputation.  In  addition,  from  a  managerial 
perspective, the extent and direction of inter-
organizational reputational effects provides an 
incentive  for  ﬁ rm  leaders  to  contribute  to 
efforts  that  increase  the  common  reputation 
of the organizational ﬁ eld or industry.   

 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
 We  begin  our  theoretical  framework  with 
the following operational deﬁ nition of repu-
tation,  ‘ a collective representation of a ﬁ rm ’ s 
past  actions  and  results  that  describes  the 

ﬁ rm ’ s ability to deliver valued outcomes to 
multiple stakeholders. It gauges a ﬁ rm ’ s rel-
ative standing both internally with employ-
ees  and  externally  with  its  stakeholders,  in 
both  its  competitive  and  institutional  envi-
ronments ’  ( Fombrun and Van Riel, 1997: 10 ). 
Three particular aspects of this deﬁ nition can 
help us to conceptualize reputation from the 
perspective of shareholders. 

 The ﬁ rst important aspect of this concept 
is that reputation exists as a perception of  stake-
holders  who are interested in a  valued outcome . 
Stakeholders  are  deﬁ ned  as  ‘ any  group  who 
can  affect  or  is  affected  by  the  achievement 
of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  objectives ’   ( Freeman,  1984:  25 ). 
The valued outcome implies that these stake-
holders have a vested economic, emotional or 
political  interest  in  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  activities  and 
how  it  performs. As  stakeholders,  these  con-
stituents help to shape the norms and values 
that  deﬁ ne  legitimacy  within  an  organiza-
tional ﬁ eld and exert an institutional inﬂ uence 
upon ﬁ rm behavior ( Meyer and Scott, 1992 ). 
 While  all  stakeholders  are  necessary  to 
enable  the  organization  to  function,  share-
holders  play  an  especially  vital  role  for 
publicly traded companies. Shareholders pro-
vide  the  necessary  risk  capital  to  enable  the 
organization to continue operations. Formal-
ly, they are the owners of public corporations. 
As  owners,  shareholders  are  concerned  not 
only  with  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  activities  and  perform-
ance,  as  are  other  stakeholders,  but  they  are 
also concerned with the market value of the 
ﬁ rm (and their investment in it) as reﬂ ected 
in  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  stock  price.  Because  they  are 
interested  in  ﬁ rm  actions  and  outcomes, 
shareholders  are  motivated  to  pay  attention 
to ﬁ rm and industry activities to reduce the 
level of uncertainty inherent in predicting future 
ﬁ rm performance and, hence, ﬁ rm value. 

 The second inference from this deﬁ nition 
of reputation is that  representations are drawn 
from  ﬁ rm  actions.  Therefore,  as  described  in 
the  economic  perspective  of  reputation,  a 
ﬁ rm ’ s actions send signals to external stake-
holders  ( Clark  and  Montgomery,  1998 ;

values  are  shaped  by  the  cumulative  effect 
of other ﬁ eld participants, a ﬁ rm ’ s reputation 
is  relevant  only  in  comparison  to  other 
organizations  involved  in  the  same  organi-
zational ﬁ eld. 

 Firm  value,  like  reputation,  reﬂ ects  the 
standards  and  norms  of  the  organizational 
ﬁ eld. Financial markets as institutions include 
socially  constructed  collective  perceptions, 
values and norms ( Fligstein, 1996 ). These so-
cial  inﬂ uences  from  the  macro-environment 
are ultimately incorporated into the market 
price of a stock ( Zajac and Westphal, 2004 ). 
In order for the ﬁ nancial market to assign a 
value to a ﬁ rm, shareholders must ﬁ rst create 
a  meaning  for  the  ﬁ rm  and  understand  its 
line of business. Judgments about the attrac-
tiveness  of  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  products  and  services, 
comprehension  of  the  underlying  business 
model of the ﬁ rm, cognitive interpretations 
of the competitive ﬁ eld and opinions about 
managerial  effectiveness  are  all  factored 
into the value of a stock. By drawing upon 
the  norms,  values  and  strategic  paradigms 
of a familiar organizational ﬁ eld, sharehold-
ers  are  able  to  use  their  knowledge  and 
experience  with  that  organizational  ﬁ eld 
to  assess  the  value  of  a  particular  ﬁ rm. 
Theoretically this explains ﬁ ndings that link 
ﬁ rm reputation to stock price performance 
( Chauvin  and  Guthrie,  1994 ;   Herremans 
 et al ., 1993 ;  Vergin and Qoronﬂ eh, 1998 ). 

 In summary, we suggest that shareholders 
with  a  vested  or  potential  interest  in  ﬁ rm 
outcomes look to managerial signals to de-
termine  the  future  of  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  underlying 
economic  performance  in  comparison  to 
relevant competitors. The similarity between 
the general reputation formation process and 
the  ﬁ rm  valuation  process  leads  us  to 
propose  using  stock  price  as  the  aggregate 
measure  of  the  reputation  of  a  ﬁ rm  in  the 
eyes  of  existing  and  potential  shareholders. 
Using  this  conceptualization,  in  the  next 
section  we  speciﬁ cally  explore  the  ways 
in  which  changes  in  one  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation 
(as  reﬂ ected 
stock  price)  may 

its 

in 

 Weigelt  and  Camerer,  1988 ).  The  case  of 
shareholders  ﬁ ttingly  illustrates  this  dimen-
sion of reputation. The separation of owner-
ship  and  managerial  control  in  most  large 
public  corporations  leads  to  information 
asymmetries  between  managers  and  share-
holders  ( Jensen  and  Meckling,  1976 ).  Most 
shareholders do not have the beneﬁ t of the 
type of ﬁ rm-speciﬁ c and industry informa-
tion that managers possess. Signaling theory 
( Akerlof, 1970 ;   Spence, 1973 ) describes com-
munication  between  two  parties  when 
information  asymmetries  exist. This  theory 
poses that the party with superior informa-
tion will convey a portion of their informa-
tion  through  their  actions.  Consequently, 
managerial  actions  (such  as  dividend  an-
nouncements,  stock  buy-backs,  etc)  convey 
information  about  the  current  state  of  the 
ﬁ rm  and  managerial  expectations  for  the 
future,  above  and  beyond  the  information 
related  to  the  action  itself  ( Asquith  and 
Mullins,  1986 ;   Leland  and  Pyle,  1977 ). 
Shareholders  use  these  cues  to  revise  their 
perceptions and impressions about the com-
pany ’ s  future  economic  performance.  In 
general,  ﬁ rm  actions  shape  stakeholder 
impressions  of  reputation.  In  the  case  of 
shareholders,  managerial  actions 
inform 
impressions of ﬁ rm value. 

 The  third  important  dimension  to  the 
concept of reputation is that of  relative stand-
ing . Given the institutional, macro-cognitive 
foundations  of  reputation  ( Rindova  and 
Fombrun, 1999 ), reputation is not an abso-
lute measure. Rather, the reputation of one 
ﬁ rm  has  meaning  only  when  compared  to 
other  ﬁ rms  ( Shrum  and  Wuthnow,  1988 ). 
Organizational ﬁ elds consist of sets of ﬁ rms 
that fulﬁ ll a similar purpose, along with oth-
er stakeholders that interact with those ﬁ rms 
as they carry out their missions ( DiMaggio 
and  Powell,  1983 ).  Through  the  iterative 
quest for institutional legitimacy, an organi-
zational  ﬁ eld  becomes  infused  with  norms, 
shared  values  and  common  expectations 
( Fombrun,  1996 ).  Because  these  shared

 INTRA-INDUSTRY INFORMATION FLOWS 
AND FIRM REPUTATION 
 In  order 
inter-
organizational aspects of reputation, we must 
consider  the  comparative  nature  of  reputa-
tion  and  ﬁ rm  value.  Stakeholders  consider 
the  action  signals  of  ﬁ rms  closely  related 
to  the  ones  they  own.  It  is  through  the 
information  content  of  the  actions  of  rele-
vant  others  that  reputation  has  an  inter-
organizational component. An announcement 
of an action by one ﬁ rm not only conveys 
information about the announcing ﬁ rm but 
also  sends  signals  about  industry  economic 
and environmental conditions that could im-
pact the value of other industry ﬁ rms as well. 
In the accounting and ﬁ nance literatures, the 
term  ‘ information transfers ’  is used to indi-
cate  the  extent  to  which  one  ﬁ rm ’ s  action 
inﬂ uences  the  market  value  of  other  ﬁ rms. 
 ‘ Information  transfers  occur  if  announce-
ments made by one group of one or more 
ﬁ rms  contemporaneously  affect  the  returns 
to shares of another group of one or more 
non-announcing ﬁ rms ’  ( Schipper, 1990: 97 ). 
Information transfers expand the signiﬁ cance 
of  a  particular  event  beyond  the  focal  ﬁ rm 
and  have  been  demonstrated  to  exist  for 
managerial actions such as earnings announce-
ments  ( Foster,  1981 ),  bankruptcy  ( Lang 
and Stulz, 1992 ), drug withdrawals ( Ahmed 
 et al ., 2002 ) and new product introductions 
( Zantout  and  Chaganti,  1996 ). When  con-
sidering  reputation  from  the  perspective  of 
shareholders, in our view, information trans-
fers  signify  the  extent  to  which  inter-
organizational reputational effects are present. 
 Two  different  simultaneous  inﬂ uences 
determine  whether 
inter-organizational 
reputation effects are positive or negative. On 
the  one  hand,  ﬁ rms  are  in  competition  for 
limited resources in factor markets (e.g. labor 
markets)  and  for  customers  in  the  product 
markets.  Simultaneously,  they  are  jointly 

subject to the same conditions and require-
ments  from  the  technical  and  institutional 
environment. When considering information 
transfers, these two competing inﬂ uences can 
result  in  competitive  effects  or  contagious 
effects  ( Lang  and  Stulz,  1992 ).  Empirical 
evidence  of  information  transfers  associated 
with layoff announcements is somewhat con-
tradictory ( Madura  et al ., 1995 ;  Sun and Tang, 
1998 ). These contradictory ﬁ ndings emanate 
from  this  duality  and  provide  the  basis  for 
our ﬁ rst set of hypotheses.  

 Competitive and Contagious Effects 
 In  order  to  survive,  a  ﬁ rm  needs  resources 
such  as  labor,  physical  assets  and  ﬁ nancial 
capital in order to satisfy customers. Since all 
of  these  key  resources  are  in  limited  supply, 
ﬁ rms in the same industry must compete for 
employees as well as investors in their efforts 
to  compete  for  customers  ( Barney,  1986 ). 
When competition is the dominant mode of 
interaction, information ﬂ ows within a group 
of rivals are in the opposite direction of the 
announcing  ﬁ rm.  For  example,  Madura  and 
colleagues  ( Madura   et  al .,  1995 )  ﬁ nd  that 
banks making layoff announcements experi-
ence  negative  shareholder  reactions.  In  con-
trast,  portfolios  of  rival  banks  increase  in 
value  following  the  layoff  announcement  of 
a  competitor.  Alternatively,  if  a  managerial 
action is viewed positively by shareholders, as 
in  the  case  of  new  product  announcements 
( Zantout  and  Chaganti,  1996 ),  it  is  viewed 
as  a  competitive  disadvantage  for  rival  ﬁ rms 
who  experience  a  negative  effect  on  their 
share price. Each new product announcement 
by  one  ﬁ rm  implies  that  the  ﬁ rst  mover 
advantage will accrue to the announcing ﬁ rm, 
precluding other ﬁ rms from gaining such an 
advantage and putting them at a competitive 
disadvantage ( Zantout and Chaganti, 1996 ). 
the 
competitive  view  suggests  that  the  layoff 
announcement conveys negative information 
about the company implementing the layoff. 
This  reduces  its  reputation  in  the  resource 

 If  a  ﬁ rm  announces  a 

layoff,

factor  markets  (for  labor  and  investors).  It 
signals a limit in its ability to deliver valued 
outcomes  to  stakeholders.  The  tarnished 
reputation of the announcing ﬁ rm improves 
the  relative  reputation  of  rival  companies. 
These competitive effects motivate the ﬁ rst 
of our two competing hypotheses 

  Hypothesis 1a : 

 Non-announcing  ﬁ rms 
within  an  industry  will 
experience intra-industry 
information  transfers  in 
the  opposite  direction  of 
the market reaction to the 
announcing ﬁ rm. 

to 

 A  ﬁ rm ’ s  portfolio  of  resources  is  central 
to its ability to satisfy all of its stakeholders 
including  customers  and  investors.  Collec-
tions of ﬁ rms with resource similarities can 
be used to deﬁ ne the boundaries of an in-
dustry  or  organizational  ﬁ eld  ( Hofer  and 
Schendel,  1978 ).  Because  of  their  resource 
similarities,  ﬁ rms  in  the  same  industry  are 
subject  to  the  same  technical  and  institu-
tional environmental inﬂ uences. This shared 
exposure 
the  environment  provides 
another  mechanism  through  which  inter-
organizational reputational effects can ﬂ ow. 
 As we noted above, the separation of own-
ership and control between shareholders and 
managers in large public corporations creates 
a  state  of  information  asymmetry  (  Jensen 
and Meckling, 1976 ).  A layoff announcement 
may  indicate  problems  with  the  focal  ﬁ rm. 
However, this action may also reveal private 
information  and  managerial  assumptions 
about future conditions in the industry as a 
whole.  In  other  words,  a  layoff  announce-
ment  could  signal  industry-level  informa-
tion,  such  as  a  negative  forecast  for  future 
demand, 
increasing  commodity  prices, 
potential regulatory changes or new market 
entrants.  The  effects  of  these  types  of 
environmental  changes  extend  beyond  the 
announcing ﬁ rm. They also impact the entire 

industry  because  they  change  the  shared 
perceptions  held  by 
industry  managers 
and  stakeholders.  Consequently,  a  layoff 
announcement  may  signal  that  other  ﬁ rms 
with  similar  resource  allocations  may  soon 
face an increasingly hostile business environ-
ment  and  this  information  would  affect 
shareholder ’ s  expectations  of 
the  non-
announcing ﬁ rm ’ s ability to operate success-
fully  in  the  future  and  thereby  alter  the 
ﬁ rm ’ s value. 

 Therefore,  the  contagion  model  would 
predict  that  the  reaction  for  non-announc-
ing ﬁ rms would be in the same direction as 
the  reaction  for  the  announcing  ﬁ rm.  If 
shareholders  react  negatively  to  the  layoff 
announcement of one ﬁ rm, the market val-
ue  and  reputation  of  non-announcing  rival 
ﬁ rms  would  also  decline. This  leads  to  the 
second of our competing hypotheses: 

  Hypothesis 1b : 

 Non-announcing 
ﬁ rms 
within  an  industry  will 
experience  intra-industry 
information  transfers  in 
the  same  direction  of  the 
market  reaction  to  the 
announcing ﬁ rm. 

 Organizational Field Structural 
Inﬂ uences 
 Early in a wave of layoffs, the motivation for 
a layoff may be interpreted as company spe-
ciﬁ c,  such  as  poor  management  or  a  faulty 
strategy.  Subsequent  layoff  announcements 
may  shift  the  focus  of  shareholders  to  an 
external  cause  such  as  an  economic  slow-
down  or  industry  seasonality.  While  once 
viewed as acts of desperation, after multiple 
announcements,  layoffs  become  a  necessary 
action. This increased legitimacy reduces the 
negative image layoffs have traditionally car-
ried  with  shareholders  ( Budros,  1997 ).  As

greater proportion of the cause to industry-
level conditions. Layoffs motivated by indus-
try  factors  will  have  a  greater  impact  on 
other ﬁ rms in the industry than will layoffs 
motivated  by 
conditions 
within the announcing ﬁ rm. 

idiosyncratic 

 Therefore,  the  prevalence  of  layoff  ann-
ouncements  inﬂ uences  the  relative  strength 
of  competitive  and  contagious  effects  over 
time.  Early  in  a  wave  of  layoffs,  the  ann-
ouncement may be viewed more as an idi-
osyncratic  ﬁ rm  problem.  In 
this  case, 
competitive  effects  are  likely  to  dominate. 
However, as more companies announce lay-
offs, more of the problem may be attributed 
to  the  industry,  and  through  contagion,  all 
ﬁ rms will be negatively affected by each sub-
sequent announcement. This would lead to 
a negative impact on the reputation of rivals 
as prevalence of layoffs increases. 

  Hypothesis 2 : 

 Increasing layoff prevalence 
will lead to negative infor-
mation transfers. 

 Markets naturally have leaders and follow-
ers. Leadership or prominence can be deﬁ ned 
in  a  variety  of  ways.  Larger  companies  are 
often  viewed  as  market  leaders  ( Fligstein, 
1990 ). Their actions are more visible, attract 
more media coverage and are more likely to 
be noticed by shareholders ( Rao  et al ., 2000 ). 
Companies can be considered prominent to 
the  extent  they  most  closely  follow  the 
deﬁ ning  strategy  of  the  group  ( Peteraf  and 
Shanley,  1997 ).  Prominence  can  also  be 
achieved 
through  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  connections 
with organizations that are considered prom-
inent or of high status ( Stuart, 2000 ) or via 
endorsements  from  industry  experts  or 
authorities ( Rindova  et al ., 2005 ). 

 Because  a  prominent  ﬁ rm  may  be 
considered to be a leader and more closely 
represent  the  paradigm  of  an  industry  or 
organizational  ﬁ eld,  prominence  can  inﬂ u-
ence  the  magnitude  of  inter-organizational 

reputational  effects. We  contend  that  infor-
mation contained in an announcement from 
a  prominent  ﬁ rm  would  be  more  likely  to 
be viewed as reﬂ ecting industry-wide infor-
mation rather than being idiosyncratic to the 
ﬁ rm.  Such  an  announcement,  therefore, 
should  have  greater 
inter-organizational 
effects  than  one  from  an  obscure  ﬁ rm. 
For  example,  if  a  very  small  oil  producer 
experienced  a  tanker  accident,  this  news 
would  more  likely  reﬂ ect  on  the  company 
rather than on the industry as a whole. Con-
trast  this  with  the  Exxon Valdez  accident. 
The  details  of  tanker  operating  procedures 
revealed  by  this  accident  seriously  hurt 
the reputation of Exxon. At the same time, 
they  also  raised  doubts  about  the  extent  of 
potential  problems  existing 
tankers 
throughout  the  oil  industry  (Glasgall  and 
Cahan,  1989  ).  If  an  industry  leader  such  as 
Exxon maintained such low standards, what 
might  the  public  expect  from  the  industry 
as a whole? 

in 

 Therefore,  a  layoff  announcement  by  a 
prominent ﬁ rm would have a greater effect 
upon  the  reputation  of  other  ﬁ rms.  We 
expect that the prominence of the announc-
ing ﬁ rm will inﬂ uence the magnitude of the 
information transfers resulting from a layoff 
announcement. 

  Hypothesis 3 : 

 More  prominent  announc-
ing ﬁ rms will create greater 
information transfers. 

 Reputation is often considered as a rela-
tive measure and thus can only be considered 
in  comparison  to  other  ﬁ rms  competing 
within  the  same 
industry  ( Carter  and 
Rueﬂ i,  2006 ).  However,  companies  are  not 
uniform  within  industries.  Firms  exhibit 
various resource allocation patterns and stra-
tegies that result in sub-groups of ﬁ rms with-
in  an  industry  ( Cool  and  Schendel,  1987 ; 
Hunt,  1972  ).  Greater  overlap  in  product 
market  coverage  increases  the  competitive

dimension  of  industry  sub-groups  ( Young  
et al ., 2000 ) as well as the strength of shared 
strategic  group  cognitive  perceptions  and 
norms  ( Porac   et  al .,  1989 ;   Reger  and  Huff, 
1993 ). The presence of industry sub-groups 
means that some industry ﬁ rms can experi-
ence  stronger  information  transfers  than 
others, depending upon how similar they are 
to the announcing ﬁ rm. 

 We propose that inter-organizational rep-
utational  effects  would  be  greater  within 
sub-groups of an industry. Given that repu-
tation is considered in comparison to other 
ﬁ rms, the more ﬁ rms are viewed to be sub-
ject  to  the  same  technical  and  institutional 
environmental  demands,  their  reputational 
comparability will be stronger. This compa-
rability  increases  the  likelihood  that  the 
information signals sent by one ﬁ rm ’ s actions 
will  be  viewed  as  relevant  to  the  value  of 
another ﬁ rm. For example, we would spec-
ulate that the information transfers between 
Mobil and Chevron, two large international 
integrated  petroleum  producers,  would  be 
greater than between Mobil and Holly Corp, 
a smaller petroleum reﬁ ning and marketing 
ﬁ rm. Therefore, we would hypothesize that 
the  strength  of  information  transfers  is 
likely  to  be  greater  when  the  announcing 
ﬁ rm is viewed as a close competitor. Stated 
another  way,  as  the  comparability  between 
rivals decreases, so too will the information 
transfers. 

  Hypothesis 4 : 

 Information 
transfers  will 
decrease as the degree of rivalry 
between two ﬁ rms decreases. 

 METHODS  

 Research Context, Sampling Method and 
Time-Frame 
 Several  characteristics  of  the  petroleum 
industry  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s 
make  it  an  ideal  setting  and  time-frame  to 
test  our  proposed  hypotheses.  Given  the 

capital  intensive  nature  of  the  exploration, 
production,  reﬁ ning  and  marketing  of 
petroleum products, the industry consists of 
a  relatively  stable  set  of  major  ﬁ rms. This 
stability facilitates the development of indus-
try norms and paradigms that are understood 
by  the  ﬁ rms  as  well  as  major  stakeholders. 
They provide a way to comprehend the per-
formance  and  environmental  risks  inherent 
in petroleum operations. Given the strategic 
importance  of  their  product  and  the  high 
level  of  uncertainty  inherent  in  future 
performance,  reputation  is  important  in 
this industry. Because stakeholders form per-
ceptions  of  reputations  from  accumulated 
actions,  petroleum 
industry  managers 
actively  engage  in  managing  their  reputa-
tions 
their  actions.  Recently, 
ChevronTexaco ’ s  CEO  ‘ challenged  oil  and 
natural  gas  companies  to  work  together  to 
improve the industry ’ s reputation ’  ( Oil  &  Gas 
Journal,  2003:  41 )  One  example  of  ﬁ rm-
level  efforts  to  manage  reputation  in  the 
energy sector was seen following the Exxon 
Valdez  oil  spill.  Companies  increased  their 
environmental  disclosures  in  proportion  to 
the  company ’ s  ownership  in  the  Alaskan 
pipeline ( Patten, 1992 ). In another example, 
oil companies made discretionary write-offs 
during  times  of  high  crude  prices.  These 
reduced  excessive  proﬁ ts  and  reduced  the 
likelihood  of  price-gouging  accusations 
( Hall, 1993 ). 

through 

 The study time-frame (1989 – 1996) was a 
difﬁ cult period in the relationship between 
petroleum  companies  and  shareholders.  As 
seen in  Figure 1 , the industry experienced a 
15-year period of relatively high crude pric-
es in the 1970s and mid-1980s. During this 
time of extraordinary proﬁ ts, oil companies 
undertook  unwise  diversiﬁ cation  efforts. 
Some were energy related, such as Unocal ’ s 
shale oil operations. Others, however, diver-
siﬁ ed  into  unrelated  industries  such  as 
Mobil ’ s  acquisition  of  Montgomery Wards 
and Exxon ’ s foray into ofﬁ ce products. These 
proved to be unwise investments. However,

the  high  crude  prices  of  the  1970s  had 
enabled managers to hide weak performance 
and  still  generate  satisfactory  shareholder 
returns.  In  1986,  crude  prices  fell  dramati-
cally, from  $ 26.75 in December 1985 down 
to  $ 14.55 one year later, a 46 per cent drop. 
In  addition  to  the  dramatic  fall,  prices 
remained  low  beyond  the  usual  seven-year 
industry  cycle.  1    This 
left  oil 
company  managers  with  many  projects 
that  were  no  longer  viable.  This  period 
coincided  with 
shareholder 
power  among  publicly  held  oil  companies 
( Abolaﬁ a,  1996 ). As  a  result,  cost  competi-
tiveness,  proﬁ t  margins  and  relative  per-
formance  became  evaluative  dimensions 
for  shareholders  and  would  inﬂ uence  the 
reputation of companies within the ﬁ nancial 
community. 

increasing 

situation 

 These trends led to industry-wide reduc-
tions,  redirection,  reorganizations  and  re-
structurings.  Companies  engaged 
in  a 
variety of cost-cutting activities and strategic 
redirection, yet this time period was prior to 
the wave of large mergers that occurred in 
the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as the 
Enron  scandal  that  further  damaged  the 

reputation  and  credibility  of  managers  in 
the  energy  sector.  This  time-frame  also 
coincides with extensive downsizing in many 
industries, possibly reﬂ ecting a change in the 
negative  perception  shareholders  tradition-
ally  held  towards  layoff  announcements 
( Chatrath  et al ., 1995 ). 

 The initial sample was obtained from the 
1996  Oil  &  Gas Journal  list (hereafter referred 
to as the OGJ200) of the largest oil and gas 
companies  (Beck  and  Bell,  1996  ).  Compa-
nies remained in the sample if their primary 
business was in one of the following petro-
leum-related  SIC  codes:  1311,  1381,  1382, 
2911  and  5172.  Companies  were  excluded 
if  they  were  headquartered  outside  the 
United States or if we were not able to ob-
tain complete data for the company. Sixteen 
non-OGJ 200 companies were added to the 
sample because they were named as rivals by 
the sample companies. The resultant sample 
consisted of 57 companies. These companies 
account  for  a  signiﬁ cant  proportion  of  US 
petroleum business, comprising 86 per cent 
of  the  total  assets  and  90  per  cent  of  the 
total  revenues  of  the  domestic  companies 
included in the 1996 OGJ200 (excluding BP

of layoffs announced for each ﬁ rm are listed 
in  Table  1 .  Firms  without  layoffs  are  listed 
in  Table 2 .   

 Layoff Information 
 Indications  of  a  layoff  were  obtained  from 
permanent  domestic  layoff  announcements 
in major newspapers and trade journals. The 
announcement date was recorded as the date 
of the earliest article that speciﬁ ed an exact 
number of employees the company intended 

to layoff or had already laid off. Most layoff 
event  studies  include  layoff  announcements 
of  any  size.  A  few  studies  have  limited 
their  samples  to  layoffs  greater  than  1,000 
employees ( Hahn and Reyes, 2004 ) or great-
er  than  0.5  per  cent  of  employees  ( Nixon 
 et  al .,  2004 ). We  selected  1  per  cent  as  the 
cut-off  for  inclusion  in  the  sample.  This 
level  screens  out  layoffs  that  may  be  so 
focused that they do not have a great impact 
on the company, its strategy or its competi-
tive position.

 Dependent Variable  

 Abnormal returns for non-announcing firms 
 An  event  study  methodology  ( Brown  and 
Warner, 1985 ;  Fama, 1969 ) was used to meas-
ure  shareholder  reactions. While  event  study 
abnormal  returns  have  been  used  in  reputa-
tional  research  as  a  dependent  variable 
( Houston, 2003 ), we use announcing ﬁ rm re-
actions  as  one  of  our  independent  variables. 
For our dependent variable, we are interested 
in the reactions for the non-announcing ﬁ rms. 
Therefore, to measure information transfers, we 
obtained  abnormal  returns  for  the  non-
announcing  ﬁ rms  on  the  date  of  each  layoff

announcement.  Previous  layoff  event  studies 
use a variety of different event windows. Inher-
ent in any event study of layoff announcements 
is the challenge of meeting the unanticipated 
event  assumption  ( McWilliams  and  Siegel, 
1997 ) given that companies vary in how grad-
ually they reveal their plans to layoff employees. 
We selected two event windows: one-day (    −    1, 
0) and ten-day (    −    5, 5). The narrower window 
enables us to capture the immediate reaction, 
while the longer window enables us to relax 
the  assumption  of  strong  market  efﬁ ciency 
without also including too many other com-
peting  events  within  the  event  window.  To 
determine the extent of abnormal returns, the 
intra-industry  reactions  are  compared  to  a 
portfolio of companies with a similar market 
value  over  a  300-day  (    −    320,      −    21)  time  pe-
riod.  Several  methods  exist  to  determine  the 
comparable portfolio; however, different meth-
ods  do  not  have  signiﬁ cantly  different  results 
over  a  seven-year  time  period  ( Hahn  and 
Reyes,  2004 ). The  abnormal  and  cumulative 
abnormal  returns  were  obtained  using  the 
UC_EVENT program.    

 Independent Variables  

 Abnormal returns for announcing firms 
 The same event study methodology is used 
to  calculate  the  abnormal  and  cumulative 
abnormal  returns  for  the  announcing  ﬁ rm. 
The one-day and 10-day windows are used 
as well.   

 Prevalence 
 Prevalence  is  measured  as  the  per  cent  of 
companies  in  the  sample  that  have  under-
gone at least one layoff during the study time 
period. This  measure  gives  an  indication  of 
the overall prevalence of layoffs. It also ena-
bles us to incorporate the dimension of time 
into the model.   

 Announcing firm size 
 Given  that  the  event  of  interest  directly 
relates to the employees of the company, we 

selected the number of employees as report-
ed  in  10-K  ﬁ lings  as  our  measure  of  size 
rather than market capitalization or total rev-
enues.   

 Rivalry 
 Consistent with the idea that managers con-
sider a small group of companies as relevant 
( Porac   et  al .,  1989 ),  we  ﬁ rst  deﬁ ned  each 
company ’ s  rival  group  by  the  self-selected 
group of competitors listed in the company ’ s 
1996 Proxy Statement (Deﬁ nitive 14A). The 
SEC  requires  companies  to  compare  their 
ﬁ nancial  performance  to  a  broad  market 
index and to a self-selected group of com-
panies  engaged  in  similar  business  activities 
(as  indicated  under  17CFR240.14a-3  per-
taining  to  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of 
1934). We use self-selected rivals to identify 
those  rivals  most  salient  to  managers  (and 
shareholders).  It  is  this  group  that  we 
hypothesize  would  most  likely  serve  as  the 
reputational and value reference group. 

 While proxy statement rival citations have 
been found to contain some degree of bias 
in that managers tend to select ﬁ rms whose 
performance  makes  their  company ’ s  per-
formance look more favorable ( Porac  et al ., 
1999 ), 55 per cent of the sample companies 
performed  better  than  their  comparison 
group, while 45 per cent performed worse, 
suggesting a lack of citation bias in the over-
all sample. 

 We then used the rival citations to create 
a  company  by  company  rival  network 
matrix. The  network  of  rival  citations  pro-
vides the opportunity to model the dimin-
ishing  reputational  inﬂ uences  that  would 
take place as inter-ﬁ rm comparability lessens. 
We  used  UCINET  to  calculate  network 
distance,  which  we  used  as  our  measure  of 
rivalry.  A  distance  of  1  represents  direct 
rivals, a distance of 2 or greater would indi-
cate an indirect rival. As the network distance 
increases, the similarity of the rivals lessens. 
For  example,  Exxon  is  a  rival  of  Chevron, 
Chevron is a rival of ARCO, who is not a

rival  of  Exxon.  ARCO  is  also  a  rival  of 
Marathon Oil who is not a rival of Chevron 
or Exxon. In this illustration, Exxon-Chev-
ron,  Chevron-ARCO  and  ARCO-Mara-
thon would all have network distances equal 
to  1.  Exxon-ARCO  and  Chevron-Mara-
thon  would  have  network  distances  of  2. 
Exxon-Marathon  would  have  network 
distance of 3. 

 The  resulting  network  is  rather  sparse,  as 
shown in  Figure 2 . Companies cited from 3 
to  39  rivals,  with  an  average  of  10.29. As  a 
result, the overall density of the network was 
0.18, indicating that only 18 per cent of the 
total  possible  citations  were  present.  This 
reﬂ ects  that  industry  participants  primarily 
consider a restricted subset of ﬁ rms to be rel-
evant competitors. These industry sub-groups 
tend  to  be  based  upon  size,  globalization  of 
operations  and  involvement  in  various  stages 
of the oil production value chain (exploration, 
production, reﬁ ning and marketing). 

 Overall network reciprocity was 74.3 per 
cent. This high level of reciprocity indicates 
consistency in managerial perceptions of in-

dustry segments The network data includes 
24  companies  that  cite  standard  industry 
indices  (such  as  the  Dow  Jones  Secondary 
Oil  Index)  as  a  rival,  even  though  they 
themselves were not one of the index com-
panies and thus not likely to have their cita-
tion reciprocated. Taking out the links to this 
Index from these 24 companies, the level of 
reciprocity increases to 83.4 per cent.

company  employees  that  will  be  laid  off  as 
indicated in the layoff announcement, is also 
included as a control. The log of this meas-
ure is used in the analysis.   

 Prior market performance 
 We calculated total return to shareholders to 
control for the prior equity market perform-
ance of the non-announcing ﬁ rm ’ s stock. Total 
return  is  deﬁ ned  as  stock  price  appreciation

during  the  past  ﬁ nancial  quarter  plus  divi-
dends divided by the stock price at the begin-
ning  of  the  quarter. The  average  of  the  past 
three ﬁ nancial quarters is used in the model.   

 Merger-related layoffs 
 Given that layoffs frequently accompany the 
integration efforts that follow a merger, spin-
off or buy-out, we have included a control 
variable  to  account  for  this  particular  type 
of layoff announcement.   

 Announcement leakage 
 We have included a control variable to meas-
ure the days since the company provided an 
initial hint of a layoff. These were obtained 
from articles published within six months of 
the  ofﬁ cial  layoff  announcement.  Examples 
of  this  kind  of  leakage  included  annual 
shareholder meetings where ﬁ rms disclosed 
plans  to  cut  overhead  costs,  or  announce-
ments  of  large  reorganizations  that  men-
tioned an unspeciﬁ ed number of layoffs.     

 RESULTS 
 Our  search  of  news  sources  uncovered  71 
layoff events ranging from 1 to 40 per cent 
of employees in 30 companies (53 per cent 
of  the  sample)  between  1989  and  1996. 
Although layoffs occurred in every year, the 
sample time period contained two  ‘ waves ’  of 
layoffs,  one  in  1992,  and  one  in  1994. The 
layoffs are displayed graphically in  Figure 3 . 
 The  data  set  includes  measures  for  each 
non-announcing  ﬁ rm  at  the  time  of  each 
layoff  announcement,  for  a  total  of  3,618 
observations.  Descriptive 
and 
correlations  for  the  data  are  found  in  
Table 3 . 

statistics 

 Similar to the ﬁ ndings of most layoff event 
studies, the mean reaction for the announc-
ing  ﬁ rm  is  slightly  negative.  However,  the 
reactions  in  this  study  were  not  signiﬁ cant. 
The  mean  intra-industry  reaction  for  non-
announcing  ﬁ rms  was  positive  for  both 
event  windows,  but  not  signiﬁ cant.  The 
mean  intra-industry  reaction  for  the  1-day 

window  was  0.00008  ( p     <    0.89)  or  for  the 
10-day window was 0.0015 ( p     <    0.19). 

 The regression model results are present-
ed  in   Table  4 .  The  table  displays  the 
results for the two dependent variable event 
windows. 

 The  overall  model  ﬁ t  for  the  one-day 
window  was  signiﬁ cant  with  an   F -statistic 
of  9.24 ( p     <    0.001) with an adjusted  R  2     =    0.02. 
The  10-day  window  model  was  also 
signiﬁ cant  ( F     =    27.07,   p     <    0.001),  and  the 
model  had  better  explanatory  power  with 
an  adjusted   R  2   of  0.06. While  explanatory 
power of these models is relatively low, these 
results  are  comparable  with  other  intra-
industry reaction studies. 

 An  evaluation  of  prior  intra-industry 
reaction  research  revealed  that  three  meth-
odological  factors  affect  model  ﬁ t:  the  type 
of  announcement,  the  level  of  diversity  of 
comparable ﬁ rms in the sample and level of 
analysis of intra-industry reactions (indivi dual 
ﬁ rm  versus  portfolio  of  comparable  ﬁ rms). 
The  prior  study  with  the  highest  level  of 
explanatory  power  (indicated  by   R  2 )  uses  a 
portfolio  of  the  two  or  three  ﬁ rms  men-
tioned  in  the  new  product  announcements 
( Zantout and Chaganti, 1996   ). Their  R  2  sta-
tistics were in the 0.30 – 0.35 range. However, 
two other studies with methodologies more 
comparable to our design had lower levels of 
ﬁ t. The ﬁ rst study design included company-
level returns from the ﬁ ve companies in the 
same  4-digit  SIC  code  with  market  value 
closest to the focal layoff announcement ﬁ rm 
and their best ﬁ tting model had  R  2  statistics 
as  high  as  0.04  ( Sun  and Tang,  1998   ). The 
other  study  design  considered  returns  from 
all companies in the same 4-digit SIC code 
following  stock-split  announcements.  This 
analysis resulted in  R  2  statistics ranging from 
0.007 to 0.057 (Tawatnuntachai and D ’ Mello, 
2002  ). Given that our methodology includes 
ﬁ rm-level reactions to layoff announcements 
and a broadly deﬁ ned set of rival ﬁ rms, the 
explanatory  power  of  our  models  is  in  line 
with other comparable research in this area.

 Understanding Competitive and Contagion Effects of Layoff Announcements 

 The one-day window results indicate that 
the  strongest  contribution  comes 
from 
the  signiﬁ cant  positive  reaction  (  ♢      =    0.26, 
 p     <    0.001) for the announcing company. This 
positive coefﬁ cient provides support for the 
contagion theory of intra-industry informa-
tion  ﬂ ows,  as  predicted  in  Hypothesis   1b  
rather than the competitive theory proposed 
in  Hypothesis   1a .  If  a  layoff  is  viewed  as 
positive  information  for  the  announcing 
company,  it  is  also  viewed  as  positive  news 
for  other  ﬁ rms  in  the  industry.  Negative 
reactions  for  the  announcing  ﬁ rm  are 
viewed as bad news for other industry ﬁ rms. 
For the one-day window, we also ﬁ nd sup-
port  for  Hypothesis   2 .  Industry  prevalence 
of 
signiﬁ cant 
(  ♢      =        −    0.03,  p     <    0.10). As hypothesized, great-
er  industry  prevalence  of  layoffs  resulted  in 
slightly  larger  negative  reactions  for  non-
announcing ﬁ rms. 

layoffs  was  marginally 

 We do not ﬁ nd support for Hypothesis  3 . 
Announcing ﬁ rm size (  ♢      =        −    0.01,  p     <    0.73) 
did  not  signiﬁ cantly  inﬂ uence  the  one-day 
reactions for non-announcing ﬁ rms. The ef-

fect of rivalry also did not show a signiﬁ cant 
direct effect (  ♢      =    0.00,  p     <    0.85) on abnormal 
returns.  As  proposed  in  Hypothesis   4 ,  the 
effect  of  industry  transfers  on  rivals  should 
have  been  lower  for  ﬁ rms  that  do  not 
directly compete with the announcing ﬁ rm. 
 We  do  ﬁ nd  a  signiﬁ cant  negative  inter-
action (  ♢      =        −    0.16,  p     <    0.05) with the degree 
of rivalry and the announcing ﬁ rm reactions 
for  the  one-day  window. We  interpret  this 
result to indicate that when the announcing 
ﬁ rm  has  a  negative  reaction,  ﬁ rms  that  are 
closer  rivals  experience  less  of  a  negative 
effect. The same dampening effect is true for 
a positive reaction for the announcing ﬁ rm, 
that  is,  close  rivals  experience  less  of  a 
positive  effect.  The  negative  interaction 
co efﬁ cient  may  reﬂ ect  the  combination  of 
contagious  and  competitive  effects.  While 
distant  rivals  experience  mainly  the  conta-
gious effects of the announcements, the con-
tagious  effect  is  negated  somewhat  by  the 
competitive effects for close rivals. 

 Two of the control variables, prior market

merger  related  layoffs  (  ♢      =    0.05,   p     <    0.01) 
were also found to be signiﬁ cant for the one-
day  reactions.  The  standardized  coefﬁ cient 
for prior market performance was negative, 
indicating that if the non-announcing ﬁ rm ’ s 
stock  had  been  performing  well,  the  news 
of  a  layoff  by  an  industry  rival  was  viewed 
more negatively. Merger-related layoffs were 
found to have a signiﬁ cant positive effect on 
the  one-day  reactions  for  non-announcing 
ﬁ rms. The coefﬁ cients were not signiﬁ cant for 
the control variables for layoff size (  ♢      =    0.02, 
 p     <    0.29) or leakage (  ♢      =        −    0.02,  p     <    0.31). 

 The  pattern  of  ﬁ ndings  for  the  ten-day 
reactions were somewhat different than those 
of the one-day window. As with the one-day 
window, the largest contribution came from 
the ten-day reaction to the announcing ﬁ rm 
which  was  positive  (  ♢      =    0.26,   p     <    0.001), 
again 
the  contagion  model 
proposed  in  Hypothesis   1b .  The  ten-day 

supporting 

positive 

window model also had signiﬁ cant negative 
results for the prevalence of layoffs (  ♢      =        −    0.10, 
 p     <    0.001), thus supporting Hypothesis  2 . As 
more  companies  implemented  layoffs  (and 
over the passing of time), the layoff news had 
a negative impact on the value of other ﬁ rms. 
The  ten-day  window  results  supported 
Hypothesis  3 . When larger ﬁ rms make layoff

One way to interpret the positive direction 
of  this  coefﬁ cient  relates  to  unique  nature 
of  very  large  ﬁ rm  announcements.  Perhaps 
because  larger  ﬁ rms  have  more  organiza-
tional  slack  ( Love  and  Nohria,  2005 ),  their 
layoff  announcements  are  interpreted  more 
as efﬁ ciency-focused actions that are viewed 
positively,  as  indicated  by  the  positive  cor-
relation  between  layoff  company  size  and 
announcing  ﬁ rm  reaction.  This  positive 

impact

signal  of  industry  restructuring  may  carry 
through the rest of the industry. The ten-day 
model  did  not  demonstrate  either  direct 
(  ♢      =        −    0.01,   p     <    0.61)  or  indirect  effects 
(  ♢      =        −    0.07,   p     <    0.38)  of  the  degree  of 
rivalry projected in Hypothesis  4 . 

 For the ten-day model, several of the con-
trol variables were also signiﬁ cant. As in the 
one-day  model,  the  coefﬁ cient  for  market 
performance  was  negative  and  signiﬁ cant 
(  ♢      =        −    0.08,   p     <    0.001).  Additionally,  both 
layoff  size  (  ♢      =    0.04,   p     <    0.04)  and  leakage 
(  ♢      =        −    0.05,  p     <    0.01) were signiﬁ cant in the 
ten-day model. Larger layoffs tended to result 
in  more  positive  intra-industry  reactions, 
indicating  some  evidence  of  competitive 
effects. The  overall  results  tend  to  point  to-
wards  contagion  effects,  as  indicated  by  the 
positive  coefﬁ cient  for  the  announcing  ﬁ rm 
reaction.  However,  in  the  instance  of  very 
large layoffs, competitive effects may dominate 
because the largest layoffs (30 or 40 per cent 
of employees) may be viewed as idiosyncrat-
ic  to  the  company.  Shareholders  of  other 
companies would not view this as being rel-
evant to the value of the company they own. 
Announcement leakage had a signiﬁ cant neg-
ative inﬂ uence on the ten-day reactions. Ear-
lier  layoff  hints  from  the  announcing  ﬁ rm 
resulted in worse announcement reactions for 
non-announcing  ﬁ rms.  The  coefﬁ cient  for 
the  merger-related  control  variable  was  not 
signiﬁ cant (  ♢      =    0.02,  p     <    0.29). 

 The idea of intra-industry reactions is not 
inconsistent  with  theoretical  underpinnings 
of the market ’ s use of information in pricing, 
nor is it in violation of any of the assump-
tions of event study methodology ( Schipper, 
1990 ). However, the differences we ﬁ nd be-
tween the one-day and ten-day intra-indus-
try reactions may reﬂ ect different dynamics 
about  market  efﬁ ciency  that  have  not  yet 
been  explored. The  differences  we  observe 
here  may  reﬂ ect  that  the  process  of  incor-
porating new information into the value of 
other  ﬁ rms  may  function  differently  under 
different levels of efﬁ ciency.   

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 In this paper, we show that a ﬁ rm ’ s reputa-
tion with its shareholders, as reﬂ ected in the 
market  value  of  the  ﬁ rm,  depends  in  part 
upon  the  actions  of  other  ﬁ rms  in  the  in-
dustry  and  shareholders ’   interpretations  of 
those actions. If a ﬁ rm ’ s layoff announcement 
is seen as a negative signal about future pros-
pects  in  the  industry,  then  the  reaction  by 
the shareholders of other ﬁ rms will be neg-
ative as well. Furthermore, as layoffs become 
more prevalent in the industry over time, the 
impact  of  subsequent  announcements  on 
non-announcing  ﬁ rms  becomes  more 
negative.  Close  rivals  tend  to  be  insulated 
somewhat  from  the  immediate  reaction  to 
the  announcement,  as  the  competitive  ad-
vantages (disadvantages) offset the contagious 
bad  news  (good  news).  For  example,  if  the 
announcing  ﬁ rm  experienced  a  negative 
reaction,  direct  rivals  also  experienced  a 
negative  contagious  reaction.  However,  the 
magnitude  of  the  negative  reaction  was 
reduced,  possibly  by  countervailing  com-
petitive  effects.  Other  industry  participants 
further  removed 
the  announcing 
ﬁ rm did not beneﬁ t from the countervailing 
competitive  effects  and  experienced  more 
negative 
than 
direct rivals.

 Three  methodological  issues  should  be 
considered when interpreting the ﬁ ndings of 
this  research.  The  ﬁ rst  is  that  this  study 
examines  one  industry,  thus  limiting  the 
generalizability  of  the  results.  However, 
single  industry  samples  have  been  used  in 
other layoff studies to highlight mechanisms 
not evident in Fortune 500 samples, such as 
company  size  ( Alli   et  al .,  1994 ),  strategy 
( DeWitt,  1998 )  or  intra-industry  effects 
( Madura   et  al .,  1995 ). We  proposed  in  this 
study  that  the  commonality  of  business 
models, market conditions and environmen-
tal threats among industry rivals serves as the 
foundation  for  industry  norms  and  para-
digms  used  to  generate  perceptions  of 
value. While a multi-industry sample would

demonstrate our industry inﬂ uence assump-
tion by providing a variety of industry char-
acteristics  (risk,  cyclicality,  technologies)  to 
test. Such a sample would also enable us to 
test  other  deﬁ nitions  of  organizational 
ﬁ elds  that  would  inﬂ uence  ﬁ rm  reputation 
among  shareholders.  However,  our  single 
industry focus does enable us to identify and 
isolate  the  mechanisms  inﬂ uencing  intra-
organizational reputational effects. 

 The  second  methodological  challenge  is 
inherent in event studies of layoff announce-
ments.  The  continual  market  updating 
process  makes  the   ‘ unanticipated  events ’  
assump tion of the event study methodology 
somewhat  problematic.  Some  companies 
gradually  leaked  their  intention  to  layoff 
months in advance of the formal announce-
ment  date,  thus  reducing  the  likelihood  of 
our  model  capturing  an  abnormal  return 
within a narrow event window. We have at-
tempted to accommodate for this tendency 
by including a slightly longer event window 
for intra-industry reactions and by explicitly 
controlling for leakage. 

 While  longer  event  windows  can  enable 
us to capture the reactions with the leakage, 
it also increases the likelihood of competing 
events occurring during the event window, 
thus  raising  the  third  methodological  chal-
lenge. While  the  ﬁ nal  sample  of  layoff  an-
nouncements  does  exclude  instances  with 
competing  events  for  the  announcing  ﬁ rm, 
we  did  not  control  for  competing  events 
for  the  non-announcing  ﬁ rms.  While  this 
assumption is critical to be able to draw in-
ferences  about  the  effect  of  the  announce-
ment on the announcing ﬁ rm, we question 
the practicality of gaining that level of meth-
odological  control  for  the  non-announcing 
ﬁ rm. As  our  overall  results  indicate,  events 
outside the ﬁ rm can impact its stock price, 
and it would be impossible to control for all 
external  events.  In  addition,  we  might 
bias  the  sample.  Firms  are  more  likely  to 
announce a layoff in close time proximity to 
their  rivals  (Goins,  2000  )  and  these  inten-

tionally  close  announcements  would  be 
excluded  as  competing  events. To  exclude 
instances with a prompt rival response would 
not fully reﬂ ect the interdependencies inher-
ent  in  ﬁ rm  value  within  an  organizational 
ﬁ eld  and  the  way  these  inﬂ uence  manage-
rial actions. 

 Methodological  concerns  notwithstand-
ing,  this  research  contributes  theoretically 
to  our  understanding  of  dynamics  within 
organizational ﬁ elds. The process of compet-
ing for external stakeholder resources while 
simultaneously trying to maintain one ’ s rep-
utation  creates  a  duality  to  organizational 
ﬁ eld  membership.  Industry  rivals  not  only 
compete  with  each  other  in  factor  and 
product  markets,  but  they  share  a  joint  in-
terdependency  with  the  information  they 
convey to the ﬁ nancial markets through the 
totality  of 
actions. 
Empirically,  we  ﬁ nd  that  information  from 
the  actions  of  one  ﬁ rm  sends  signals  that 
shareholders  incorporate  into  their  valua-
tions  of  other  companies.  As  a  result,  the 
inﬂ uence  of  a  layoff  on  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation 
amongst  shareholders  is  not  limited  to  the 
announcing ﬁ rm, but ﬁ lters through to affect 
other rivals as well. 

independent  ﬁ rm 

 Theoretically,  our  work  responds  to  the 
call  to  further  explore  the  inﬂ uence  of  or-
ganizational  ﬁ eld  legitimacy  on  ﬁ rm-level 
reputation ( Deephouse and Carter, 2005 ). By 
broadening the lens to the ﬁ eld level, we are 
able  to  demonstrate  a  few  of  the  different 
environmental contingencies to consider in 
inter-organizational  reputational  dynamics. 
As we demonstrate, the theoretical founda-
tion  in  the  area  of  reputation  adequately 
incorporates  this  environmental  context; 
however,  it  may  not  be  as  well  under -
stood  or  studied  as  ﬁ rm-level  reputational 
dynamics. Therefore, the ﬁ eld-level perspec-
tive raises the importance of modeling some 
level  of  environmental  contingencies  into 
empirical  reputation  studies.  Our  ﬁ ndings 
also provide empirical evidence that reputa-
tion  can  be  conceptualized  as  a  strategic

resource, despite the fact that it is intangible 
and  is  externally  bestowed.  In  a  manner 
similar to dynamic capabilities ( Teece  et al ., 
1997 ),  reputation  appears  to  buffer  an 
organization from the inﬂ uences of organi-
zational ﬁ eld changes in legitimacy. 

 By  examining  a  phenomenon  through 
both  the  institutional  and  resource-based 
lenses, our work also begins to reconcile how 
the  two  competing  forces  of  cooperation 
and competition can work together to inﬂ u-
ence  ﬁ rm-level  outcomes.  Assuming  that 
both competitive  and  contagious  forces are 
present  in  any  information  transfer,  as  we 
suggested  in  our  hypotheses,  the  relative 
strength  of  these  two  forces  can  vary  over 
time.   Barnett  (2006)   theorizes  about  the 
shifts in organizational ﬁ elds from periods of 
competition to periods of collective action. 
Measuring the relative strength of competi-
tive and contagious intra-industry informa-
tion  ﬂ ows  over  a  period  of  time  could 
provide  an  empirical  way  to  identify  the 
inﬂ ection  points  in  this  process  over  time. 
In  addition,  different  salient  dimensions  of 
inter-group  rivalry  could  be 
identiﬁ ed 
by  examining  the  periods  of  signiﬁ cant 
competitive effects and periods of signiﬁ cant 
contagious effects. 

 Our  ﬁ ndings  carry  mixed  messages  to 
managers  of  publicly  traded  ﬁ rms. As  with 
much  of  the  research  using  an  institutional 
theoretical  base,  the  key  managerial  impli-
cation  is  that  some  level  of  managerial 
discretion  is  removed  from  many  strategic 
actions. Our results suggest that to some ex-
tent, shareholder perceptions of ﬁ rm reputa-
tion  are  not  completely  under  managerial 
control.  However,  our  ﬁ ndings  also  suggest 
that to the extent that industry rivals have a 
shared reputational destiny, managers would 
be  wise  to  become  aware  of  the  actions  of 
their  rivals.  In  the  instance  of  a  negatively 
perceived  action  such  as  a  layoff,  managers 
have  some  options.  In  the  event  that  the 
initial  layoff  announcement  is  attributed  to 
idiosyncratic  ﬁ rm  causes,  non-announcing 

ﬁ rms can try to differentiate their ﬁ rm from 
the  announcing  ﬁ rm  to  demonstrate  why 
their  reputation  should  not  be  negatively 
affected  as  well.  In  the  event  the  initial 
layoff announcement indicates industry wide 
weakness, it behooves managers to act quick-
ly  and  to  encourage  others  to  engage 
in  a  collective  effort  to  be  fast  followers. 
A  longer  and  more  drawn  out  response  by 
laggards within the industry has a detrimen-
tal  effect  on  the  ﬁ rm  value  of  competitors 
as  well  as  the  reputation  of  the  industry  as 
a whole. 

 In conclusion, by extending the theoreti-
cal reputation framework to consider reputa-
tion as reﬂ ected in ﬁ rm value, we provide a 
way  to  empirically  study  ﬁ rm  reputation 
from the perspective of shareholders. We ﬁ nd 
that  reputation  effects  of  layoff  announce-
ments spillover beyond the announcing ﬁ rm 
and extend to other ﬁ rms as a result of their 
interdependence.  Our  new  perspective  on 
the duality of organizational ﬁ eld member-
ship  can  provide  researchers  and  managers 
with a different framework within which to 
balance  the  somewhat  divergent  demands 
of  competition  and  cooperation  and  their 
inﬂ uence on ﬁ rm reputation.
