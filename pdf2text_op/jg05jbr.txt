Abstract

Social psychologists conceptualize trust in a manner that differs from conceptualizations used by marketing researchers to date. Building
from the social psychology literature, we posit that interpersonal trust in consumer-level service relationships has cognitive and affective
dimensions. We examine the relative impact of service provider expertise, product performance, firm reputation, satisfaction, and similarity in
influencing customer’s perception of these dimensions of trust in a service provider. Using survey data from 349 customers of a firm of
financial advisers in the United Kingdom, our results show that cognitive and affective dimensions of trust can be empirically distinguished
and have both common and unique antecedents. The results also provide further clarification concerning the relationship between trust and
sales effectiveness.

1. Introduction

Ever-increasing database management capabilities now
allow companies to focus on mass-customization rather than
mass marketing, share of customer rather than share of mar-
kets, and customer retention rather than customer recruitment
(Peppers and Rogers, 1993). The objective is to ‘‘own’’ the
customer by building high-trust relationships within which an
increasing array of products and services can be sold. Al-
though these developments have yielded significant benefits,
they are falling short of achieving a ‘‘relationship’’ with the
consumer due to their limited ability to stimulate emotional
linkages necessary to consummate a relationship. Overcom-
ing the emotional sterility that accompanies business-to-
consumer relationships has been identified as an important
challenge to relationship marketers (Fournier et al., 1998).
Yet, a review of the literature reveals only three studies
(Hawes et al., 1989; Swan et al., 1988; Swan et al., 1985)
that have examined emotional trust; none of these studies has
empirically assessed the unique role of emotional trust.

Accordingly, our study focuses on the role of emo-
tional trust in building relationships at the consumer level.
We draw on a well-established theoretical precedent for
examining emotional aspects of
from the social

trust

psychology literature that conceptualizes trust as having
cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions (Lewis
and Weigert, 1985). More specifically, we examine the
proposition that consumer trust in service providers has
distinct cognitive and affective dimensions with unique
antecedents and consequences. We assess whether these
dimensions are empirically supported, and what practical
insights can be gained on managing interpersonal aspects
of service relationships.

is likely to be salient

To make this assessment, we examine relationships
between consumers and their financial advisers. Emotional
trust
in this context because
consumer-service firm relationships are characterized by
credence qualities that reduce the ability of customers to
make objective assessments of service quality (Alford and
Sherrell, 1996). Customers may rely on affective signals
from the service provider as an indicator of service
quality. A patient may, for example, regard the personal
courtesies of his/her surgeon as a predictor of the sur-
geon’s commitment or even ability to conduct an opera-
tion successfully.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First,
we examine how cognitive and affective trust have been
defined in the sociology and social psychology literatures.
Second, we present a model of hypothesized antecedents
and consequences of cognitive and affective trust. And,
finally we report the results of the empirical test.

2. Cognitive and affective trust

Cognitive trust is a customer’s confidence or willingness
to rely on a service provider’s competence and reliability
(Moorman et al., 1992; Rempel et al., 1985). It arises from an
accumulated knowledge that allows one to make predictions,
with some level of confidence, regarding the likelihood that a
focal partner will live up to his/her obligations. It is what
Rempel et al. (1985) call ‘‘predictability’’ and Johnson-
George and Swap (1982) call ‘‘reliableness.’’ Knowledge is
accumulated from observation of partner behavior within the
focal relationship and from reported reputation in other
relationships. When reputation effects are strong, initial
interactions may be merely an opportunity to confirm or
disconfirm prior perceptions, and cognitive trust may become
definitive in one or a few interactions.

Although cognitive trust is knowledge-driven, the need
to trust presumes a state of incomplete knowledge. A state
of complete certainty regarding a partner’s future actions
implies that risk is eliminated and trust
is redundant.
Williamson (1993) argues this perspective by suggesting
that trust between firms is best labeled calculative trust,
since firms can minimize uncertainty and opportunistic
behavior through due diligence and contractual safeguards.
Consumer transactions, however, involve less contractual
safeguards, and knowledge asymmetry prevents compre-
hensive due diligence. A ‘‘leap of faith’’ is therefore a
permanent feature of consumer service consumption.

Affective trust is the confidence one places in a partner
on the basis of feelings generated by the level of care and
concern the partner demonstrates (Johnson-George and
Swap, 1982; Rempel et al., 1985). It is characterized by
feelings of security and perceived strength of the relation-
ship. Reputation effects also influence affective trust, but
affective trust
is decidedly more confined to personal
experiences with the focal partner than cognitive trust.
The essence of affective trust is reliance on a partner based
on emotions. As emotional connections deepen, trust in a
partner may venture beyond that which is justified by
available knowledge. This emotion-driven element of trust
makes the relationship less transparent to objective risk
assessments prescribed by economists.

Affective trust is closely related to the perception that a
partner’s actions are intrinsically motivated (Rempel et al.,
1985). An example of this is provided by a financial
advisers we interviewed who mentioned that a tactic use
by advisers to gain the trust of first-time customers is to
recommend a product that saves the customer transaction
fees and earns little or no commission for the adviser. The
adviser informs the customer of this act of benevolence,
which elicits an emotional bond of trust in the financial
adviser. According to the literature on customer participa-
tion, customers are not placid receivers of services but
coproducers of the service and comakers of expressed
emotions (Locke, 1996). As customers participate in the
ongoing service delivery process, they become exposed to

organizational socialization that generates positive affect
and elicits customer commitment. Thus, we argue that
emotional exchanges are a critical and ongoing part of
consumer-level service relationships and form the basis for
trusting bonds.

Our definitions of cognitive and affective trust are
consistent with basic notions of cognition and affect dis-
cussed in the marketing literature, most notably the adver-
tising literature. Just as Edell and Burke (1987) describe the
cognitive element of attitude as consisting of a subject’s
judgment of the ad’s characteristics, cognitive trust is a
willingness to rely on a service provider based on specific
instances of reliable conduct. And,
just as an affective
response to an ad is based on a subject’s feelings during
ad exposure (Edell and Burke, 1987), affective trust is based
on affect experienced from interacting with the service
provider.

There is a third component of trust, behavioral trust,
which constitutes actions that flow from a state of cognitive
and affective trust (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). This study
treats behavior trust
implicitly as the consequences of
cognitive and affective trust.

3. Conceptual model and hypotheses

Using previous research findings as a foundation, we
formulated a model of antecedents and consequences of
cognitive and affective trust (Fig. 1). Next, we present the
theory supporting the relationships detailed in the model.

3.1. Expertise

A customer’s perception of a salesperson’s expertise
reflects the identification of relevant competencies associ-
ated with the goods or service transaction (Crosby et al.,
1990). Expertise is typically assessed in terms of a service
provider’s level of knowledge and experience concerning
the focal service. Research has demonstrated that an
individual’s perceived level of expertise enhances his/her
source credibility and thereby trustworthiness (Busch and
Wilson, 1976). We anticipate that perceived expertise
should have a direct effect on cognitive, but not affective
trust, because assessments of expertise and cognitive trust
both employ an attribute evaluation process (Petty and
Cacioppo, 1986), involving specific identifiable actions of
the service provider.

H1: Perceived service provider expertise is positively related
to a customer’s cognitive trust (but not affective trust) in a
service provider.

3.2. Product performance

Product performance is defined as a customer’s assess-
ment of the performance of core service deliverables.

Fig. 1. A model of customer trust in service providers.

The services literature distinguishes between ‘‘process’’
or functional aspects and ‘‘outcome’’ or technical aspects
(Gronroos, 1984). Process quality is determined by behav-
ioral interactions, whereas outcome quality is determined
by the performance of tangibles. Because customers have
difficulty assessing intangibles, they pay particular attention
to the performance of tangible deliverables (Shostack,
1977). For example, in the context of financial advisory
services, where the core deliverable is financial advice,
return on investment constitutes ultimate proof of service
quality. Attribution theory holds that individuals will attri-
bute the cause of an event
if they can detect who is
responsible (locus), who had control over the cause (con-
trol) and the likely reoccurrence of the event (stability)
(Weiner, 1985). Since the service provider is often respon-
sible for the service implementation and often has consid-
erable control over its quality (Parasuraman et al., 1985), it
is likely that performance of core aspects will be attributed
to the service provider, and thus affect trust in the provider.
Product performance assessment conforms to the widely
accepted cognitive attribute evaluation process of mul-
tidimensional models of attitudes. Therefore, no direct link
is anticipated between product performance and affective
trust.

H2: Perceived product performance is positively related to a
customer’s cognitive trust (but not affective trust) in a service
provider.

3.3. Firm reputation

Perceived service firm reputation has been defined as
the customer’s belief that
the firm is fair and honest
(Doney and Cannon, 1997). Drumwright (1994) suggests
that a firm can gain a good reputation by doing things not
only because they are fair and balanced, but also because
they are the ‘‘right
thing’’ to do. Reputation is both a

symbol of value reciprocation and an expression of empa-
thy for the customer. We anticipate, therefore, that percep-
tions of firm reputation are sufficiently inclusive as to
impact both cognitive and affective trust. A buyer’s assess-
ment of the reputation of a firm will positively impact his/
her assessment of the trustworthiness of a service provider
or salesperson through a process of transference (Doney
and Cannon, 1997). For example, a customer who is not
yet sufficiently familiar with a service provider may ex-
trapolate his/her opinions directly from the reputation of the
firm.

H3: Perceived firm reputation is positively related to a
customer’s (a) cognitive trust and (b) affective trust in a
service provider.

3.4. Satisfaction with previous interactions

Satisfaction refers to an emotional state arising from
both a cognitive process of comparing customer’s expect-
ations with perceptions of service performance and an
evaluation of emotions experienced during the consump-
tion experience (Westbrook and Oliver, 1991). Customer
satisfaction assessments involve tangible attributes as well
as feelings of joy, fear and anger associated with the
service experience. Satisfaction with past outcomes leads
to a perception of equity in exchange process, which
enhances confidence that a partner will continue to meet
his/her obligations in the future (Ganesan, 1994). Given
the general multidimensional nature of satisfaction evalu-
ations,
the experience of satisfaction or dissatisfaction
potentially contributes to perceptions of both cognitive
and affective trust.

H4: Satisfaction with previous interactions is positively
related to a customer’s (a) cognitive trust and (b) affective
trust in a service provider.

3.5. Similarity

Similarity between a service provider and a customer
connotes the presence of common values and interests. Social
psychology researchers have found that in social relation-
ships individuals tend to display higher levels of attraction
toward people they perceive to have attitudes similar to their
own. Byrne (1969) suggests that this link occurs because the
detection of similarity (attitudes) in others confirms an
individual’s interpretation of the environment. This process,
he argues, elicits positive affect that becomes associated with
the referent individual through conditioning. This affinity
provides an environment conducive to trust development.
Accordingly, we posit that when a customer detects elements
of similarity in a service provider, an affective response may
result that leads to the development of a cooperative and
accommodating attitude towards the service provider. Thus,
we hypothesize a link between similarity and affective trust.

H5: Similarity is positively related to a customer’s affective
trust (but not cognitive trust) in a service provider.

3.6. Cognitive and affective trust

Cognitive trust provides a base for affective trust and
should therefore exist before affective trust develops (Lewis
and Weigert, 1985). But as affective trust matures,
the
potential for decoupling of trust dimensions and reverse
causation increases (McAllister, 1995). Although we model
cognitive trust as a positive antecedent of affective trust,
attitude theory researchers have long argued that the rela-
tionship between cognition and affect in attitude formation
is bidirectional. Our chosen direction of influence is con-
sistent with previous theorization and empirical research
(e.g., McAllister, 1995).

H6: A customer’s cognitive trust is positively related to a
customer’s affective trust in a service provider.

social bonds are important for continuity of a relationship,
they do not constitute a prerequisite for achieving economic
benefits from the relationship.

H7: A customer’s cognitive trust in a service provider is
positively related to sales effectiveness.

3.8. Anticipation of future interactions

Anticipation of future interactions constitutes a partner’s
intention to continue the relationship and has been widely
researched as a desirable outcome of both service marketing
and marketing channel relationships. Previous research
supports the link between trust and anticipation of future
interactions (Crosby et al., 1990). Consistent with this
previous work, we argue that anticipation of future interac-
tion can be driven by more cognitive considerations (like
product performance) as well as by emotional consideration
(like enjoyment of the service relationship).

H8: A customer’s (a) cognitive and (b) affective trust in a
service provider are positively related to a customer’s
anticipation of future interactions.

the customer has a vested interest

To the extent that the service provider is successful in
achieving a sale,
in
continuing the relationship. Theory and research findings
from the relationship – commitment literature suggest that as
investment in a relationship increases, commitment to the
relationship also increases (Rusbult, 1983). Customer –
salesperson interactions involve investments of time and
emotional
labor by customers and purchases constitute
economic investments in the relationship. These invest-
ments create relational equity that reduces the risk custom-
ers perceive to be associated with future transactions.

H9: Sales effectiveness is positively related to a customer’s
anticipation of future interactions.

3.7. Sales effectiveness

4. Method

Sales effectiveness refers to the seller’s success in
achieving sales of ‘‘preferred solutions’’ (Weitz, 1981).
Research findings have not consistently supported a link
between trust and economic outcome of exchange relation-
ships. Our hypothesis regarding sales effectiveness builds
from our distinction between cognitive and affective trust
and from the results of Crosby and Stephens (1987). Their
study found that although relationship-marketing practices
can affect some aspects of customer satisfaction,
is
product performance that tends to drive the actual purchase
decision. Given our previous argument that product perfor-
mance is related to cognitive trust, we argue that once the
variance associated with affective trust is explicitly mod-
eled, the link between cognitive trust and sales effectiveness
will emerge. However, we do not predict a link between
affective trust and sales effectiveness, because although

The model was assessed using survey data from custom-
ers of a large United Kingdom financial advisory service
firm. A total of 334 responses were realized from mailings
to 1880 randomly selected customers, constituting a 19%
response rate. Respondents comprise 57% male and 43%
female and have been with their advisers for an average of
15 months. Survey items are detailed in Appendix A.
Established measures were used with minor modifications
to suit
the study context. Measures of service provider
expertise and firm reputation were adapted from Doney
and Cannon (1997). Satisfaction with previous interactions
was measured using scales from Ganesan (1994). Similarity
and anticipation of future interactions were measured using
scales from Crosby et al. (1990). Sales effectiveness was
operationalized as a formative construct comprising sales-
value per account and cross-selling effectiveness (number of

different products purchased from the financial adviser),
which were then summed to form a single item.

New scales were developed for cognitive trust, affective
trust and product performance in accordance with conven-
tional procedures (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988; Churchill,
1979). Drawing from interviews with service providers and
customers and measures of interpersonal trust from previous
research (Johnson-George and Swap, 1982; McAllister,
1995; Rempel et al., 1985), 15 items each of cognitive and
affective trust were developed. Next, four doctoral students,
unconnected with the project, were provided with definitions
of cognitive and affective trust and asked to classify each of
the 30 items. Only items with 100% interrater reliability were
retained, resulting in seven indicators of cognitive trust and
seven indicators of affective trust. These items were then
tested via a pilot study of 134 customers of a financial
advisory service firm. Cognitive and affective trust demon-
strated convergent and discriminant validity with composite
reliabilities of 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. Items were further
eliminated through refinement of construct definition, result-
ing in five items each of cognitive and affective trust.

5. Analysis and results

Model assessment involved first testing for unidimen-
sionality and convergent and discriminant validity of latent
constructs, and subsequently testing the predictive validity
of trust dimensions using confirmatory and latent construct
assessment procedures.

Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation was used to de-
termine model parameters. The correlation matrix along
with means and standard deviations are reported in Table 1.

5.1. Dimensionality of consumer trust

Discriminant validity of cognitive and affective trust was
assessed by pooling construct measures and estimating a
measurement model with the phi coefficient (/ij) uncon-
strained. We then estimated a second model with phi con-

5.2. Measurement model and structural model fit

We observed the two-stage procedure for assessing
structural models (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). Compos-
ite reliabilities and variances extracted are detailed in Table
1. The composite reliability (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988) of
indicators of each construct is acceptable, ranging from
0.80 for cognitive trust to 0.95 for satisfaction with previous
interactions. Average variances extracted are all above the
recommended 0.5 level, supporting the discriminant validity
of measurement scales (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Each of
the 24 observable indicators load significantly (a=.001) on
its intended factor, supporting the convergent validity of
scale items. Item loadings and measurement errors (listed in
Appendix A) are also acceptable. The adjusted goodness-of-
fit index (AGFI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.90
and 0.97, respectively, are above the 0.90 thresholds,
indicating acceptable fit. In addition, a root mean square
error approximation (RMSEA) of 0.040 is below the thresh-
old level of 0.05, indicating a close fit of the model with the

(H9: b = 0.17, t = 4.10).

5.3. Examination of hypothesized relationships

The standardized solution was used for interpreting the
causal relationships supported by the structural model. All
but two hypothesized relationships are supported, and all
supported hypothesized relationships are in the predicted
direction (Table 2).

Expertise (H1: c = 0.40, t = 7.11), product performance
(H2: c = 0.14, t = 2.77) and satisfaction with previous inter-
actions (H4a: c = 0.39, t = 7.01) are significantly associated
with cognitive trust. However, the relationship between firm
reputation and cognitive trust is only marginally supported
(H3a: c = 0.09, t = 1.93). In terms of affective trust, the
antecedent role of firm reputation (H3a: c = 0.15, t = 3.66),
similarity (H5: c = 0.24, t = 5.53) and cognitive trust (H6:
b = 0.58, t = 7.16) are supported. However, the relationship
between satisfaction with previous interactions and affective
trust is not supported (H4b: c = 0.02, t = 0.01).

Predicted consequences of both cognitive and affective
trust are supported. Cognitive trust contributes significantly
to both sales effectiveness (H7: b = 0.18, t = 3.02) and antic-
ipation of future interactions (H8a: b = 0.64, t = 8.39), while
affective trust contributes significantly to anticipation of
future interactions (H8b: b = 0.15, t = 2.66). Lastly, sales

Next, we undertook additional investigation to determine
the unique contribution of affective trust to these relation-
ships. To do this, we estimated an alternative model with all
constructs except affective trust and similarity (Anderson and
Gerbing, 1988). Results of a chi-square difference test
comparing both models indicate that the full model has a
superior fit. The v2(97) (difference) value of 131.46 exceeds
the critical value of 120.98 ( P=.05). However, other tests,
which like the v2 test adjust for parsimony, suggest a more
moderate difference between the two models. The parsimo-
nious goodness of fit index (PGFI) of 0.67 for the full model
is not significantly different from 0.66 for the reduced model.
However, an RMSEA of 0.040 for the full model compared
with 0.046 for the reduced model supports the marginal
superiority of the full model.

6. Discussion

6.1. Research and managerial implications

Our study has produced moderate evidence in favor of
conceptualizing trust as having cognitive and affective
dimensions in financial service exchanges. Though the
two dimensions are highly correlated, they are empirically
distinguishable, and both dimensions of trust have unique
antecedents. Service provider expertise and product perfor-
mance are antecedents of cognitive but not affective trust,
and sales effectiveness is a consequence of cognitive trust
but not affective trust. Also, similarity is an antecedent of
affective trust but not cognitive trust.

The finding that satisfaction with previous interactions
contributes to cognitive trust and not affective trust, sug-
gests that customer satisfaction in the financial services
industry is primarily based on core aspects of service
delivery. Unlike some previous studies of trust in marketing,
our study found support for a relationship between (cogni-
tive) trust and sales effectiveness, indicating that a multidi-
mensional conceptualization may be fruitful for exploring
the managerial benefits of trust. Although we found that
affective trust contributes significantly to a customer’s
willingness to meet with a service provider in the future,
our study suggests that affective trust has a modest impact
on financial service relationships. Researchers have sug-
gested that
trust facilitates relationship processes, which
have a direct impact on economic outcomes (Anderson
and Narus, 1990). Perhaps affective trust has a direct impact


506

on processes such as customers’ listening behavior (Ramsey
and Sohi, 1997) and response to persuasive attempts, which
in turn directly affect sales effectiveness.

6.2. Directions for future research

trust

The proposed model of customer

in service
providers was developed to explore the multidimension-
ality of the trust construct and was not
intended to be
comprehensive. Therefore, several opportunities exist for
further research on the antecedents and consequences of
affective trust. A potentially fruitful avenue of research is
the impact of dissatisfying events on the different dimen-
sions of trust. Lewis and Weigert (1985) suggest
that
affective trust is particularly strongly affected when trust
is broken. Is affective trust more likely than cognitive
trust to be affected by dissatisfying events? Are custom-
ers with high affective trust more likely to voice their
dissatisfaction and experience service recovery than cus-
tomers with low affective trust?

In conclusion, we have provided a multidimensional
perspective on trust in business – consumer relationships that
incorporates affective noneconomic aspects of these rela-
