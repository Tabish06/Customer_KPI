The value chain of many business enterprises is increasingly required to demonstrate the proﬁtability
of their primary activities, starting from inbound logistics to operations, outbound logistics, marketing
sales, and ﬁnally to services. The adoption of green logistics management (GLM) presents an
opportunity for Chinese manufacturing exporters to competently respond to the escalating expectation
of the international community for resources conservation and to achieve environmental performance
proﬁtably. This study makes several important contributions to the literature on managing logistics
with environmental considerations. First, the authors identify the components of GLM: (i) procedure-
based practices, (ii) evaluation-based practices, (iii) partner-based practices, and (iv) general environ-
mental management practices. Second, they relate GLM to environmental and operational performance
in a developing country context. Third, they identify the institutional and operational antecedents that
prompt the adoption of GLM by export-oriented manufacturing enterprises in China. Fourth, they
examine the moderating effect of environmental regulatory pressure on the GLM-performance linkage.
The results are based on a survey of manufacturing exporters in China. The commonly held view that
economic motivation is related to the adoption of GLM is not supported. However, GLM positively
affects both environmental and operational performance, and regulatory pressure enhances the GLM-
performance relationship.

Introduction

Business enterprises in newly industrialized countries such as
the BRICs (Brazil, Russia,
India, and China) are increasingly
expected to comply with environmental standards such as the
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), the End of Life
Vehicle (ELV) Directive, and the Restriction of Hazardous Sub-
stances (RoHS) if their merchandises are to reach international
markets successfully. Such environmental-based trade barriers
have also aroused the awareness of customers, ﬁrms, and govern-
ment bodies for protecting the environment. Meanwhile, there
are growing international concerns on the environmental
damages associated with the accelerated industrial activities in
the BRICs and China in particular [1,2]. As global suppliers of
manufactured products, manufacturing enterprises in China need
to seek sustainable solutions such as green logistics management
(GLM) in pursuit of proﬁtable growth without inﬂicting environ-
mental damages to other countries through managing the

logistics cycle of their merchandises,
i.e., spanning sourcing,
manufacturing, distribution, and disposal [3]. Such a solution
should be able to improve business performance, while preser-
ving the local, as well as the global environment.

Nowadays, the majority of products consumed in developed
countries have their resource materials or part of their manu-
facturing processes served by developing countries. The globali-
zation of production highlights the importance of GLM on
prevention of environmental harm arising from product manu-
facturing and distribution activities. Serving as the world’s
factory, Chinese manufacturing exporters are encountering inter-
national pressure to conserve resources and reduce their environ-
mental consequences [4]. The circular economy law in China,
which promotes conservation of resources, reﬂects organizational
responsibility towards achieving this goal [5]. According to the
China’s National Development and Reform Commission, a circular
economy is a scientiﬁc development model, where resources
become products and the products are designed in such a way
that they can be fully recycled for sustainable development of a
country with a focus on balancing economic development and
environmental protection. Resource depletion and an increasingly
detrimental environmental burden caused by organizational pro-
duction operations have led the Chinese government to impose


268

stricter regulatory policy. This law took effect on 1 January 2009
and China is one of the pioneer emerging countries implementing
circular economy-oriented legislation to redress the environmen-
tal harms arising from the rapid growth of its industrial activities
in recent decades. The circular economy initiative of China has
major strategic importance for Chinese enterprises, particularly
those in the manufacturing sector which are considered a major
polluting source to the environment. Thus, proﬁtable growth,
increasing environmental awareness, and stringent regulatory
policies all suggest that Chinese manufacturing exporters need a
management approach to tackle these challenges. Managing the
logistics cycle of products in an environment-friendly manner and
the different facets of these environmental management practices
are increasingly embraced as a source of lasting competitive
advantage by many Chinese manufacturers [6].

As China aspires to develop a circular economy to promote
continuous economic development without generating signiﬁcant
environmental and resource challenges, GLM is congruent with
this goal featuring a focus on the three Rs (i.e., recycling, reuse,
and reduce) to improve internal procedures and external confor-
mances in managing product movements. To reach this circular
economy objective, the important role of logistics management
should not be neglected. Considerable opportunities exist along
the logistics chain to reduce a ﬁrm’s environmental impact; for
example, substituting chemicals that might reduce the generation
and handling of hazardous waste or by reducing the packaging
waste that must be managed and disposed. GLM is novel and
unique relative to concepts such as reverse logistics and closed-
looped supply chain, which are conﬁned to an emphasis on
mitigating the environmental damages through managing the
forward and reverse physical movements of goods among trading
partners. Reverse logistics focuses on planning, implementing,
and controlling efﬁcient ﬂows of materials, in-process inventory,
ﬁnished goods from the point of consumption to production for
the purpose of recapturing value or conducting proper dispo-
sal [7]. Similarly, closed-loop supply chain consists of a forward as
well as reverse supply chain, such that the loops of product ﬂow is
closed by reusing the product as itself, its components, or its
materials [8]. Although these concepts are helpful for environ-
mental protection by reducing the disposal to landﬁll with focus
on processes in handling end-of-life or returned products, e.g., by
recycling and remanufacturing, they neglect the management
practices that are useful
for mitigating the environmental
damages caused by products throughout their life-cycle. In com-
parison, GLM is a management approach that considers product
return and recycling, environmental management systems, and
eco-efﬁciency as viable ways to comply with environment-based
regulations in international trade [9,10]. While environmental
impacts occur at all stages of a product’s life cycle [11], GLM can
contribute to integrate these factors in organizational logistics
operations particularly on meeting market expectations, mana-
ging environmental
risks, complying with regulations, and
improving business efﬁciency. In particular, product distribution
requires partner participation and performance monitoring if the
recovery of products and materials in an environmentally sound
manner can succeed.

GLM reﬂects organizational ability to conserve resources, reduce
waste, improve operational efﬁciency, and satisfy the social expecta-
tion for environmental protection. Other than internal activities such
as product development and manufacturing processes, managing
physical product ﬂows is considered essential for environmental
protection from the logistics and international business perspectives
[12,13]. While there are studies linking logistics elements including
procurement, distribution, packaging, reserve logistics, to environ-
mental preservation [14,15], the literature is void of a theoretical
construct that captures the key elements of GLM. Thus, this study

ﬁlls this research gap by developing GLM as a composite construct
reﬂecting an organization’s strive to balance economic growth and
environmental protection in logistics management as well as the
structure (i.e., the procedures), relevant processes (i.e., the evalua-
tion), and strategy (i.e., partner and management focus) that supple-
ment this goal. Thus, at the core of GLM is the belief that ﬁrms can
improve both environmental and operational performance by mana-
ging the logistics cycle of their products.

We examine two performance measures for evaluating the
outcomes of GLM: (1) environmental performance, which is
related to reduction in emission, waste, and pollution incurred
from logistics activities, and (2) operational performance, which
is concerned with improvement in product development and
delivery. Based on the theory of structuration, we investigate
the antecedent economic and institutional factors pressurizing
the adoption of GLM by Chinese manufacturing exporters. Finally,
we evaluate the effect of regulatory pressure moderating the links
between the antecedent factors and performance outcomes.

We develop new measurement items and adapt existing scales
for evaluating GLM in manufacturing as well as the antecedent
and outcome factors experienced by Chinese manufacturing
exporters. The survey-based data were analyzed using conﬁrma-
tory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation modeling, and
multi-group analysis for moderating effect. Our empirical results
establish that GLM can be embraced as a manufacturing resource
to make the logistics cycle less wasteful and regulation plays a
role to strengthen the implementation of GLM due to customer
pressures as well as the performance outcomes in both economic
and operational aspects.

2. Conceptualization and developing the GLM construct

We conducted exploratory interviews to understand environ-
mental concerns of manufacturing enterprises in China. Speciﬁcally,
we explored attributes constituting GLM and the pressures that are
experienced by the manufacturers. The details of the exploratory
interviews are summarized in Appendix B. We now proceed to
elaborate on these four attributes of implementing GLM.

Procedure-based practices: Policy guidelines are needed to
implement any organizational practices such as GLM. We
deﬁne procedure-based practices as the management practice
to perform GLM activities based on company structure and
reporting systems in manufacturing enterprises. The proce-
dure-based practices in GLM help manufacturers to detail and
rationalize the actions to be taken in GLM, and serve as a
communication tool between organizational functions on their
responsibility in GLM.
Evaluation-based practices: Periodic performance evaluation is
desired for manufacturing enterprises to identify areas for
improvement. These practices reﬂect organizational ability to
evaluate, monitor, and improve performance on a continuous
basis. The purpose of evaluation-based practices is to provide
formal documents and reports to managers, reducing equivo-
cality on the success of GLM.
Partner-based practices: A logistics chain requires the support
and knowledge of internal staff members to work beyond
organizational boundaries for any initiative such as environ-
mental management to take effect. Staff communication and
training on GLM is therefore needed to achieve the targeted
implementation outcomes. A ﬁrm should not act unilaterally
and partnership, backward with suppliers and forward with
customers, is instrumental to competently mitigate the envi-
ronmental impact arising from inter-organizational activities
reﬂect
and product ﬂows. The partner-based practices

269

organizational ability in coordinating with internal staffs and
external partners on the implementation of GLM. Such prac-
tices emphasize information sharing and communication on
the development of GLM with related parties in the logistics
chain.
General environmental management practices: This component
of GLM requires visibility in the product development process
and that the activities are compliant with international envir-
onmental standards in a logistics chain. The general environ-
mental management practices evaluate the extent to which
ﬁrms are visible in environmental protection actions that are
the responsibility of different stakeholders. Firms maintain
records in satisfying environmental standards with a formal
reporting system for stakeholder access, such as publishing
corporate social responsibility reports [16].

This conceptualization of GLM based on our interviews is in
line with the thoughts on environmental management and the
logistics literature. The term environmental management has
been conceptualized as encompassing managerial efforts to mini-
mize the environmental harms generated throughout the life
cycle of manufactured merchandises. Environmental manage-
ment, composed of product and operations technologies and
international business management systems, is one important
determinant of environmental performance with the purpose to
develop, implement, manage, coordinate, and monitor organiza-
tional activities to reach compliance and waste reduction goals.
Acknowledging the environmental impact that stretches beyond
organizational boundary, some enterprises have begun to shift
from multiple sourcing and competitive bidding to more long-
term and traceable partnership as a preferred approach for
managing logistics [17]. Such approach involves the collective
efforts from different logistics parties including suppliers, trans-
porters, warehouses, and retailers to undertake environmental
management practices such as eco-design, product return, and
recycling to green the logistics chain [18]. In organizing inter-
organizational product ﬂow activities, a well-structured manage-
ment practice is essential to improve logistical coordination
amongst partners, hence reducing potential wastes such as idle
facilities and excessive inventories [19]. Extending beyond these
concepts, GLM is deﬁned in terms of these four speciﬁc attributes
and characterized as being speciﬁc and actionable by individual
ﬁrms to improve environmental and operational performance.

3. The antecedents of GLM

The notion of GLM resonates with the managers contacted in
our exploratory interviews, while they also believed that several
factors could affect the level of GLM a Chinese manufacturer
exhibits. These factors are broadly classiﬁed into customer pres-
sures, economic incentives, and regulatory requirements. Consis-
tent with the theory of structuration [20], these factors reﬂect
organizational actions that are inﬂuenced and structured by a set
of resources, relations, and conditions in the implementation of
GLM. In addition to institutional legitimacy, the resources avail-
able and regulatory constraints can determine the actions of
manufacturing enterprises.

Speciﬁcally, the resources aspect of structuration theory high-
lights the available resources and inputs supportive of environ-
mental management practices. Examples of these resources
include governmental subsidies and material costs savings, which
provide economic incentives for green logistics operations. In
servicing the international markets, manufacturing enterprises
need to mitigate the environmental
impact arising from the
development and distribution of their products while raising their

ecological efﬁciency. Such efﬁciency enhancements, which are
increasingly expected by international customers, can be struc-
tured by the environmental roles and expectations of their
partners along the logistics chain [21]. There are also regulatory
requirements, spanning from limiting materials used to waste
disposal, structuring the environmental management practices of
manufacturers.

Other than economic considerations, ﬁrms pursue GLM due to
customer pressures and institutional legitimacy [22,23]. A green
image is favorable for manufacturers, particularly those with
export orientation, to gain acceptance in the global market. By
adopting GLM, there can be spill-over effects nurturing customer
preference for related products with avoidance for environ-
mental incidents and the consequential legal costs and ﬁnes.
While GLM facilitates and promotes such actions as product
return and recycling services for their products, GLM implemen-
tation improves environmental reputation of manufacturers
through news and feature stories, cultivating a positive publicity
and corporate image to attract environmentally conscious custo-
mers [4]. While plentiful products exist in the market labeling
their environmental consciousness, customers may switch if a
product violates environmental laws or pollutes the environment
[24,25]. Many anecdotes suggest that sourcing from environmen-
tally irresponsible manufacturers has negative impact on the
reputation of downstream customer ﬁrms, e.g., retailers, which
often interact directly with individual end consumers. This
phenomenon gives rise to an increasing trend for manufacturing
enterprises seeking ISO 14000 certiﬁcation, environmental audit-
ing, and retrieving reusable products for reuse to satisfy the
environmental requests of their customers. GLM may serve to
‘signal’ the congruence of environmental management practices
with the ‘‘going green’’ expectation by the international commu-
nity. Doing so may lead to greater market acceptance and insulate
from criticisms by competitors [26]. GLM is helpful for Chinese
manufacturing exporters to showcase their environmental cre-
dentials and satisfy those increasingly better-informed and more
demanding international customers, enabling them to compete
effectively in export markets, especially in the longer term.

Hypothesis 1. The customer pressure for environmental protec-
tion encountered by a Chinese manufacturing exporter is posi-
tively related to its implementation of GLM.

GLM can be embraced as a valuable resource to satisfy the
growing organizational quest for productivity, while reducing
pollution and resources consumption. In addition to customer
expectation for cleaner production, there are two aspects of
economic pressures that are encountered by manufacturing
enterprises, namely dematerialization and decoupling [5], to gain
cost advantage in the global market. The former is concerned with
consuming less environmental resources for each unit of output,
while the latter refers to lower dependency on the input of
natural resources for continuous productivity growth. Since
environmental impacts occur at all stages of a product’s life cycle,
GLM plays a role to address these concerns. For instance, product
distribution in an environmentally sound way would require
procedures and evaluations to govern the processes so that
efﬁcient recovery of products can be achieved with partner and
compliance requirements fulﬁlled. A challenge for manufacturing
enterprises is to operate proﬁtably while reducing their adverse
impacts on the environment. In particular, the Chinese economy
is showing signs of overheating with rise of inﬂation, manufac-
turers in China experiencing intense growth of raw material costs
are fraught with threats of eroded earnings [27]. On the other
hand, as a manufacturing driven economy fuelled by rapid
industrialization, China has become the world’s largest waste


270

generator. To deter such enormous waste production, Chinese
government imposes higher fee of waste disposal and encourages
organizational adoption of environmental management practices
to retrieve reusable products in the hope of saving costs and
alleviating pollution problems. These situations lead to rising
costs for Chinese manufacturers to operate. In view of the eco-
nomic pressures, GLM can be a viable management approach to
resolve the cost challenge and respond the environmental request
by involving cross-functional efforts, and systematically monitor-
ing and reporting the progress of GLM to allow productivity and
environmental improvement in managing the logistics activities
throughout the product life cycle.

Hypothesis 2. The economic pressure for environmental protec-
tion encountered by a Chinese manufacturing exporter is posi-
tively related to its implementation of GLM.

4. The consequences of GLM

There is growing interest on eco-efﬁciency and environmental
performance. The outcomes of such environmental management
systems as ISO 14001relating to gross proﬁt margin and sales per
employee [28] as well as social and environmental performance
[29] have been examined. GLM is different with an emphasis on
customer and supplier participation to implement by establishing
various complementary management practices to facilitate such
implementation. Yet it remains unclear whether ﬁrms adopting
GLM more intensively perform better. This study examines two
performance aspects of GLM relating to environmental perfor-
mance and operational performance. The former assesses perfor-
mance on pollution reduction,
resources conservation, and
corporate environmental reputation, while the latter evaluates
performance on productivity gains.

When pollution arises, it reveals inefﬁcient use of inputs and
eco-unfriendliness in one or more logistics activities, spanning
from product design, production, distribution, to disposal. Such
problems can be prevented through redesigning product and
production processes [30]. Implementing GLM practices can also
make business less polluting. Examples of these practices include
substituting with less polluting inputs, recycling by-products of
processes, and innovating polluting processes. These practices are
helpful for reducing consumption of hazardous materials as well
as lowering disposal of waste water and solid wastes in the
production processes. The attributes of GLM are useful mechan-
isms to prevent environmental degradation caused by organiza-
tional activities through various managing,
reporting, and
monitoring procedures to control the logistics processes involved
throughout a product lifecycle [31]. Such management efforts can
lessen disposal of products and parts with residual values,
redeploy reusable parts into new products, reduce carbon emis-
sion in production and distribution, and extend the product
lifecycle. The improved logistics efﬁciency and reduced resources
consumption due to GLM are important environmental pursuits
by Chinese manufacturing enterprises [32]. By implementing
GLM that aims to reduce adverse environmental impact caused
by production and distribution activities, Chinese manufacturing
exporters stand a better chance to market their products in
overseas markets with demanding environmental expectations
by customers and environmental regulations.

Hypothesis 3. The implementation of GLM by a Chinese manufac-
turing exporter is positively related to its environmental performance.

There is a general belief on the trade-off between environmental
management and productivity [33]. To pursue environmental goals,
ﬁrms will
inevitably suffer from increased costs and reduced
productivity due to necessary investment in capital resources for

product and process changes which in turn will add costs and erode
proﬁtability. Nevertheless, the eco-efﬁciency perspective argues
that pollution is a form of economic inefﬁciency, whereby pollution
reduction is beneﬁcial to productivity [34]. GLM is oriented towards
eco-efﬁciency that proactively manages the same level or more of
product ﬂows, but reduces environmental degradation, resource
consumption, and costs.
It involves preventive approaches on
environmental protection spanning from materials sourcing to
end-of life product acquisition and processing. The collection and
use of reusable parts and components can lessen environmental
damages due to disposal in addition to reducing costs in materials
sourcing. Investigating end-of-life products also enables manufac-
turers to discern customer usage patterns and identify areas for
product quality improvements. In pursuit of pollution prevention,
complementary networks of suppliers and customers can be lever-
aged for productivity enhancement. For example, customers’ sup-
port for products acquisition facilitates product return for recycling
processes of manufacturers, improving the success of environmen-
tal initiative by manufacturers to reduce disposal. Chinese manu-
facturers advanced in supply chain cooperation perform better in
economic performance with regard to the cost for materials
purchasing, energy consumption, and waste treatment than their
laggard counterparts [5]. The procedure-, evaluation- and partner-
based focus of GLM necessitates the engagement of different func-
tions and participation of related parties to continuously improve
the logistics chain through reduction of task redundancy and waste.
GLM therefore offers a management structure to support environ-
mental-based logistics management coordinating the logistics chain
activities to reap operational performance gains.

Hypothesis 4. The implementation of GLM by a Chinese manufac-
turing exporter is positively related to its operational performance.

5. The moderating role of environmental regulations

Manufacturers need adaptation to the changing business envir-
onments [35,36], particularly environmental regulatory require-
ments, if their products are to compete in regulated markets.
Environmental regulatory pressure is concerned with regulations
that are enacted by local or oversea regulatory bodies to control
environmental damages caused by organizational activities ran-
ging from production, transportation, to product disposal. In many
cases, these environmental regulatory pressures are mandatory for
enterprises to produce, distribute, and sell their products under
the legal requirements. There are many such environmental regu-
latory pressures encountered by Chinese manufacturing exporters
in their operations. The regulations directed at the manufacturing
sector can bring operations and performance implications. For
instance, a comprehensive set of environmental regulations for
developing a circular economy such as Clean Production Law and
Environmental Impact Assessment Law relevant to the manufac-
turing industry have been enacted in China. External regulatory
pressures from the European Union (EU) have led many Chinese
manufacturing exporters to reconsider the environmental impact
engendered throughout their logistics chain. Exporting products
destined for the EU market must be free from hazardous sub-
stances (e.g., RoHS and REACH) and the original manufacturers are
mandated to undertake the responsibility for the collection,
treatment, and recycling of end-of-life products, for all electrical
and electronics equipment in the case of WEEE. Since the EU
constitutes a major market for manufacturing export, it is impor-
tant for manufacturers, especially those highly dependent on
export in China, to comply with these regulations or otherwise
suffer from massive export declines.

These regulatory pressures are reﬂective of the environ-
mental concerns by the local community and regulatory bodies


K.-h. Lai, C.W.Y. Wong / Omega 40 (2012) 267–282

271

as negative externalities caused by imports [37]. In the wake
of increased public pressure and the growth of more stringent
environmental regulations, GLM as a proactive international
logistics management approach towards protecting the environ-
ment is a viable way for developing an environment-friendly
corporate image to compete for international trade. Such envi-
ronmental reputation can be a valuable resource for manufac-
turers, particularly those who are export-oriented, in emerging
countries to access overseas markets, to comply with, and to
anticipate necessary changes with future legal environmental
standards in different countries. Manufacturers are often man-
dated to demonstrate their commitment for environmental pro-
tection and GLM can be leveraged for such purpose. Further to the
customer and economic pressures as antecedent drivers for GLM,
environmental regulatory pressure strengthens the implementa-
tion by providing guidelines on the environmental standards and
the export requirements of markets stipulating different environ-
mental conformances. The need for regulatory compliances also
intensiﬁes the environmental dedication of manufacturers for
GLM implementation to signal their environmental and produc-
tivity achievements. We argue that Chinese manufacturing expor-
ters encountering higher environmental regulatory pressures are
more receptive to customer and economic concerns on environ-
mental protection with a more intensive implementation of GLM.

Hypothesis 5a. When the environmental regulatory pressure
experienced by a Chinese manufacturing exporter is high, the
positive effect of customer pressures for environmental protec-
tion on its implementation of GLM will be stronger.

Hypothesis 5b. When the environmental regulatory pressure
experienced by a Chinese manufacturing exporter is high, the
positive effect of economic pressures for environmental protec-
tion on its implementation of GLM will be stronger.

The noncompliance penalties and ﬁnes [38] as well as the
public disclosure are regulatory punishments for polluting ﬁrms.
In many instances, manufacturers are pressurized to be proactive
in environmental protection in the hope of attaining both envi-
ronmental and productivity beneﬁts, while gaining recognition by
their overseas markets on regulatory compliance. Such pressures
highlight the needs of manufacturing enterprises to improve their
environmental management practices in the logistics chain.
Regulatory requirements for pollution reduction guide the perfor-
mance of GLM as such pressure promote environmental aware-
ness and standards for manufacturers to integrate the need for
environmental protection in their production processes. A more
proactive step is to develop management practices such as GLM
for improving environmental performance while minimizing
costs throughout the product life cycle. Environmental regulatory
pressure reinforce the need for implementing GLM to achieve
environmental performance where the regulatory requirements
provides guidance for manufacturers on practices useful
for
preserving the environment. To gain competence in countries
stringent in environmental regulations, it requires greater efﬁ-
ciency in the use of resources where GLM can contribute envi-
ronmental and operational beneﬁts to offset the compliance costs.
In view of the higher environmental standards due to the need
for regulatory compliances, manufacturers implementing GLM
are urged for strengthening their environmental and operational
performance outcomes
to establish their environmentally-
friendly position and showcase their performance achievements.

experienced by a Chinese manufacturing exporter is high, the

performance will be stronger.

performance will be stronger.

6. Methodology

6.1. Sample characteristics and data collection

This study uses Chinese manufacturing exporters as an empiri-
cal setting to test the hypotheses due to the following reasons.
First, China is a global production base, exporting a wide variety of
merchandises ranging from 4% to 40% of the world’s manufactur-
ing outputs of different products [39]. Second, the scale and speed
of China’s recent rise of industrialization has engendered many
environmental problems that have aroused international concerns
relating to its pollution impact not only on the environment, but
also on health issues such as birth defects and premature death
both locally and internationally [40]. What do we know about the
institutional and operational forces triggering the environmental
initiatives of Chinese manufacturing exporters is seriously lacking.
Third, environmental management has been observed as a critical
factor affecting the prosperity of Chinese manufacturing enter-
prises [6]. Fourth, the environmental management issues arising
from product distribution by Chinese manufacturing exporters
provide a rich research setting appropriate for examining GLM
pertaining to its antecedents, measurement properties, and per-
formance outcomes. In particular, given the global importance of
‘‘made in china’’ merchandises, the environmental protection
pressures exerted by the international community, and the insti-
tutional reform for ecological modernization desired by the
Chinese government can be scrutinized to gain insights on the
effect of regulatory pressure as a contextual condition affecting
the extent of implementing GLM and its performance outcomes.
The respondents in this study were senior executives of
Chinese manufacturing enterprises. We did not constrain the
sample organizations to speciﬁc manufacturing industries with
the aim to improve the generalizability of our study ﬁndings, but
we controlled the product type in our analysis to take account of
different environmental issues that may arise from the manufac-
turing processes and logistics activities [41]. We randomly drew a
sample of Chinese manufacturing exporters from the database
Dun & Bradstreet. These Chinese manufacturing exporters locate
in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China, which is a major industrial
zone that accounts for one third of China’s export trade value.
Located in the world’s manufacturing center with support of
well-developed logistics infrastructure for international trade
activities, majority of these manufacturers are export-oriented,
servicing foreign customers with a wide variety of manufactured
products ranging from electronics and toys to garments and
textiles. These manufacturers in the PRD region encounter similar


272

K.-h. Lai, C.W.Y. Wong / Omega 40 (2012) 267–282

issues pertinent to their environmental management practices
due to the pressures induced by their international customers,
local and oversea regulatory bodies, and rising operating costs
in China.
In addition to the executives’ contact information,
company name, address, phone number, and company’s business
proﬁle, we collected archival data on annual sales volume,
product type, and company size in terms of number of employees
from the database as control variables. We identiﬁed a qualiﬁed
key informant in each sample ﬁrm knowledgeable in environ-
mental and logistics-related management according to the infor-
mation provided by the database. Respondents were assured that
their answers are reported in aggregate with others, and their
identity and company details are kept conﬁdential. A total of 800
sample manufacturers were contacted. Furthermore, a survey
package containing the questionnaire, a self-addressed pre-paid
reply envelop, and a cover letter explaining the purpose of this
study, was mailed to each of them in 2008. Given the job nature of
the key informant managers in handling foreign customers, we
were able to administer the questionnaire in English language.
Follow-up telephone calls were made or emails were sent two
days after the initial mailing to seek acknowledgement of receipt
and to emphasize the importance of their responses to this study.
We then sent another survey package to the non-respondents two
weeks after the follow-up calls and emails of the initial mailing
with a cover letter to solicit their participation. Two weeks after
the second mailing, in addition to dispatching a third survey
package to the non-respondents, we made follow-up telephone

calls or sent emails to urge their response. Our data collection was
concluded three weeks after the ﬁnal mailing, with 134 com-
pleted questionnaires received for data analysis, representing a
response rate of 16.75%. We eliminated six returns due to
signiﬁcant missing data and the resulting effective response rate
of 16%is comparable to other survey-based environmental man-
agement studies, e.g. [42]. Table 1 summarizes the proﬁle of the
respondent manufacturers.

6.2. Common method variance

We took two steps to determine whether common method
variance (CMV) posed a serious threat to the study. First, Harmon’s
one-factor test was applied to assess whether a single latent factor
would account for all the constructs. The single-factor model yielded
a w2 value of 2090.71 (df¼376). A w2 difference test was conducted
against the hypothesized six-factor model to assess CMV. A sig-
niﬁcant difference between the w2 values of the two models
(Dw2¼1502.74; Ddf¼21, po0.001) indicated that the ﬁt in the
one-dimensional model was signiﬁcantly worse than it was in the
measurement model. Such result provided preliminary evidence
that CMV was not a problem in this study. In addition, we followed
the procedures recommended by Lindell and Whitney [43] to exam-
ine CMV. We used the type of ownership of ﬁrm (i.e., publicly-
owned vs. privately-owned) as the marker variable to perform the
CMV analysis because the marker variable is theoretically unrelated
to the dependent variables (i.e., operational and environmental
performance). The type of organizational ownership is not signiﬁ-
cantly correlated to operational performance with p¼0.21 and
environmental performance with p¼0.97. The correlations between
all constructs in the measurement model and the type of organiza-
tional ownership are summarized in Table 4. In addition, the partial
correlations between the constructs are signiﬁcant after partialing
out the effect of CMV, and the partial correlations are reported in
Table 3. We concluded that the measurement model possessed
reasonable ﬁt with the data, the constructs exhibited both con-
vergent and divergent validity, and CMV did not pose serious threat
to the interpretation of our study results.

6.3. Measurement development

We developed a structured survey instrument to measure the
practicing managers’ perception. Based on the conceptualization
of GLM according to the interviews results, we developed new
scales to operationalize the four attributes of GLM for evaluating
the extent of these environmental management practices imple-
mentation on managers’ perception. In addition, we included
measurement items on environmental protection for economic
pressure [44], customer pressure [45], operational and environ-
mental improvement [46], and regulatory pressure [45] after
suitably adopting existing scales.

We generated a pool of measurement items from the literature
on environmental and logistics management. These measurement
items were systematically amended to better reﬂect the manu-
facturing context. In the next step, we pretested these items with
six executives and ﬁve academics in the ﬁeld for assessing the
comprehensiveness,
logic, and relevancy of the measurement
items. On the basis of their feedback, we reﬁned the items and
administrated the revised measurement items to 30 executives for
a pilot test. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis to purify
our scales. Based on the analysis results, we deleted two items
because of their lower corrected item-to-total correlation than the
threshold of 0.30, which left us 49 items for further analysis. The
number of indicators employed in this study are similar to those
other studies in the management literature examining latent
constructs with organizational key informants, e.g. [36].

a Second-order indicators of GLM.
b Second-order factor.

As discussed previously, GLM is conceptualized as a second-
order construct comprising four attributes: (1) procedure-based
practices, (2) evaluation-based practices, (3) partner-based prac-
tices, and (4) general environmental management practices. The
six ‘‘procedure-based’’ items reﬂect the extent to which manu-
facturers formally document, manage, and report on how their
GLM practices are conducted by the responsible organizational
functions. The four ‘‘evaluation-based’’ items record the extent
to which manufacturers monitor, report, and assess their GLM
practices. The ‘‘partner-based’’ scale consists of ﬁve items asses-
sing how well manufacturers communicate with their internal
staff and external partners on their implementation of GLM. The
general environmental management scale evaluates the extent to
which manufacturers comply with environmental standards and
record their activities for formal reporting via publication of
annual report, etc. With reference to Russo and Fouts [44], we
developed a four-item scale to measure the increasing economic
costs of landﬁll and potential economic gains of product return
compliance programs.

We adopted an existing scale [45] to provide a four-item
measure for evaluating the extent of customer pressure for
environmental protection engendered from customer require-
ments and expectations. We operationalized regulatory pressure
using a ﬁve-item scale based on Zhu et al. [45] to evaluate the
environmental regulatory pressures experienced by manufac-
turers. A ﬁve-item scale and another six-item scale were devel-
oped with reference to Sroufe [46] for evaluating environmental
and operational performance, respectively. The ﬁnal scales are
summarized in Appendix A.

6.4. Measurement models analysis

were considered within acceptable levels. We evaluated the
measurement properties of the theoretical constructs by conduct-
ing conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the four attributes of
GLM. Then, CFA was conducted on the two antecedents (i.e.,
customer and economic pressures) and the moderator (i.e., envir-
onmental regulatory pressure) variables. Following the guidelines
by Gerbing and Anderson [47], we used maximum likelihood
estimation with sample covariance matrix as input in the CFA.

The GLM construct

As GLM is conceptualized as a second-order construct, its four
attributes, namely procedure-based, evaluation-based, partner-based,
and general environmental management practices are ﬁrst-order
factors and measured through their respective indicators. First, we
estimated the second-order factor of GLM by examining the target
coefﬁcient T2 [48]. The T indicates the extent to which the second-
order construct accounts for the variance amongst the ﬁrst-order
constructs. The ﬁrst-order constructs show the value of w2¼336.37,
while the second-order construct has w2¼352.41, giving a high T ratio
of 0.95. This result indicates that the relationships amongst the ﬁrst-
order constructs are sufﬁciently captured by the second-order con-
struct [49]. The second-order construct ﬁt was considered acceptable
on the basis of the ﬁt indices (w2¼352.41, df¼145, CFI¼0.91;
RMR¼0.05; IFI¼0.91; TLI¼0.90), which is consistent with Hu and
Bentler’s [50] recommendations. The path coefﬁcients between the
indicators and the ﬁrst-order factors are signiﬁcant at po0.05, while
the path coefﬁcients between the second-order construct (i.e., GLM)
and its four attributes are signiﬁcant at po0.05. Table 2 summarizes
the results of the CFA for GLM and its respective ﬁrst-order

We used a combination of SPSS 17.0 and AMOS 17.0 to examine
the univariate skewness and kurtosis of the variables and they

w2(second-order model).

constructs. On the basis of theoretical and empirical grounds, the
conceptualization of GLM as a second-order construct is tenable.

This evidence demonstrates that convergent validity exists for
the constructs. Table 3 summarizes the standardized loadings.

We further examined the second-order factor structure by con-
ducting one-factor CFA on the average scores of the four respective
ﬁrst-order constructs following prior studies, e.g. [51]. The model ﬁt
is good (w2¼16.28, df¼2, CFI¼0.97; RMR¼0.02;
IFI¼0.97;
TLI¼0.90). All the path coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant at po0.05. We
used the aggregated scale consisting of the average scores of the four
attributes as the indicators of GLM for further analyses.

The combined measurement model

We proceeded to ﬁt a CFA on all the six latent constructs
before testing the path coefﬁcients of the hypothesized structural
model. Composite reliability, Cronbach’s a, and average variance
extracted are summarized in Table 3. We assessed the unidimen-
sionality of the constructs by Cronbach’s a. The a values were well
above the threshold value of 0.70 in the range 0.89–0.92,
indicating that the construct measures are sufﬁciently reliable.
As shown in Table 2, composite reliability coefﬁcients for the six
latent constructs fell in the range from 0.90 to 0.92, suggesting
internal consistency for each set of observed variables in its
respective latent construct [52].

The six-factor measurement model exhibits a good ﬁt with
the data (w2¼587.97, df¼355; CFI¼0.92; RMR¼0.07; IFI¼0.92;
TLI¼0.90). The standardized factor loadings range from 0.59
to 0.96, and are statistically signiﬁcant at the po0.01 level.

We examined discriminant validity following the proposed
guidelines by Fornell and Larcker [52], which is widely adopted
by other researchers, e.g. [53]. We compared the average variance

extracted (AVE) of each construct with the highest variance that
each construct shares with the other constructs in the model. The
AVE for each construct is higher than the highest shared variance,
suggesting that all constructs exhibit discriminant validity. In
addition, we examined discriminant validity using an alternative
procedure [54]. Since the w2 values for the unconstrained models,
where each pair of constructs co-varies freely, are signiﬁcantly
lower than the constrained models (with the estimated correlation
for each pair of constructs constrained to one), the presence of
discriminant validity for all the constructs is evidenced.

7. Hypothesis testing

7.1. The structural model testing

The structural model used to test the hypotheses consisted
of the six factors validated in the measurement model, excluding
the moderating variable (i.e., environmental regulatory pressure).
The model ﬁt measures indicated acceptable agreement with
the covariance in the data (w2¼484.83, df¼287; CFI¼0.91;
RMR¼0.07; IFI¼0.91; TLI¼0.90; RMSEA¼0.07). The hypothesis
test results for H1–H4 are summarized in Table 5.

We found that GLM was positively associated with operational
(b¼0.35, po0.01) and environmental (b¼0.36, po0.01) perfor-
mance, providing support for H3 and H4. In support of H1,
customer pressure was positively associated with GLM (b¼0.21,
po0.05). The prediction in H2 that economic pressure encoun-
tered by manufacturing enterprises is positively associated with

Table 5
Results of hypothesis testing.

GLM implementation received no support (b¼0.28, p40.05). The
control variables, including annual sales volume, product type,
and company size in terms of number of employees, were
incorporated in the structural model as determinants to the
dependent variables (i.e., GLM, and environmental and opera-
tional performance). The control variables have no signiﬁcant
impact (p40.05) on the dependent variables. In sum, three of the
four hypotheses are accepted after testing the structural model.
For evaluating the impact of operational initiatives such as
GLM, it is worthwhile to examine against objective measures
of performance, although prior research has found strong links
between perceptual measures of performance with objective
measures. While we believe that our ﬁndings hold for objective
measures of performance, we extracted sales volume as an
objective measure from our database. This measure corresponds
to the perceptual measure OPer6 we obtained through the survey.
A correlation of 0.70 between sales volume and OPer6 indicates
a close association between these measures in our data. We
repeated the test for the structural model by substituting sales
volume for OPer6, and the results we obtained were similar to the
results from the structural model that contained the OPer6
perceptual measure. To further validate the ﬁndings, we carried
out the analysis comparing the model ﬁt of 10 randomly selected
subsamples, consisting of 100 respondents each, from our total
sample of 134. We found insigniﬁcant differences in the w2 value
when we speciﬁed equality for the parameters across two sub-
samples at a time. The results indicated no signiﬁcant change in
the model ﬁt, suggesting that the model was valid across different
subsamples.

7.2. The rival model testing

In our hypothesized model, GLM performs a mediating role
between the antecedent (i.e., customer and economic pressures)
and the consequence (i.e., operational and environmental perfor-
mance) constructs. The hypothesized model does not include direct
paths from the antecedent factors to the consequent outcomes. In
the rival model, we allowed the two antecedent variables and GLM
to have direct effects on operational and environmental performance.
As such, GLM is not modeled as a mediating construct. We compared
the hypothesized structural model with the rival model to test the
nomological status of GLM as a mediating variable [55]. The rival
model (number of distinct parameters to be estimated¼59) was less
parsimonious than the hypothesized model (number of distinct
parameters to be estimated¼57) with ﬁt indices w2¼489.72;
df¼285; CFI¼0.91; RMR¼0.07; IFI¼0.91; TLI¼0.90; RMSEA¼0.08.
Since the two models used exactly the same covariance structure as
input, we compared the two models using w2 difference test. The w2
difference test results (Dw2¼4.89; df¼2, p40.05) suggested that the
rival model did not explain the covariance structure better than that
of the hypothesized model. We also compared the two models based
on the percentage of the paths between the latent constructs. The
ratio of supported paths to the hypothesized paths was 3 of 4 (75%),
and the ratio of signiﬁcant paths to examined paths was only 2 of 6
(33%) in the rival model. While we prefer a more parsimonious
hypothesized model to that of the rival model, these results imply
that GLM holds a mediating role and is inﬂuential in bringing about
operational and environmental performance for Chinese manufac-
turing exporters.

7.3. Moderating effect of environmental regulatory pressure

lower environmental

H5 and H6 are concerned with the moderating effect of
environmental regulatory pressure on the relationships among
economic pressure, customer pressure, GLM implementation,
environmental performance,
and operational performance.
Following the procedures proposed by Byrne [56], we used
multi-group analysis within AMOS17.0 to assess the moderating
variable effects (i.e., environmental regulatory pressure) on the
structural model. A single environmental regulatory pressure
index was formed by averaging the measurement items. We
divided the sample into two groups (i.e., high vs. low environ-
mental regulatory pressure groups) with median split. Manufac-
turers with a total score of 3.20 or less were classiﬁed as ﬁrms
operating under
regulatory pressure
(n¼55), and those with a total score of higher than 3.20 were
classiﬁed as ﬁrms operating under high level of environmental
regulatory pressure (n¼73). Although the sample size of each
group is relatively small compared to similar studies, e.g. [57], the
multi-group analysis enables us to examine the structural rela-
tionships of the variables under high and low levels of environ-
mental
regulatory pressure. The multi-group analysis was
conducted in four steps. First, we developed a model where the
structural parameters vary freely across the two groups to form a
baseline model (Model 1). The baseline model has a value of
w2¼697.22 with df¼474. Second, the structural parameters were
constrained to be equal across the two groups (Model 2), gene-
rating an estimated covariance matrix for each group and an
overall w2 value for the sets of sub-models as part of a single
structural system. The constrained model has the value of
w2¼901.80 with df¼537. Third, the moderator effects were tested
by assessing whether statistical differences exist between the two
w2 values. We conducted a w2 difference test to compare the
constrained model (Model 2) with the unconstrained one (Model
M1¼204.58 with df¼63
1). The w2 difference test results in w2
at po0.05, which is statistically signiﬁcant. A signiﬁcant change

M2 w2

in the w2 value indicates the moderator effect of environmental
regulatory pressure, such that invariance is found attributable to
environmental regulatory pressure. Fig. 2 depicts the results of
the high versus low environmental regulatory pressure groups.

Then, we examined the moderator effect of environmental
regulatory pressure on the paths in our research model by assess-
ing the equality across two groups using a w2 difference test
between a model with a speciﬁc path set to be equal across two
groups (a constrained model) and a model where path coefﬁcient
varies freely (a baseline model). For example, to test Hypothesis
5a, we constrained the customer pressures-GLM path equally
across the high and low environmental regulatory pressure
(Ddf¼ 1)¼4.37
groups, and obtained the w2
(po0.05) suggests that across the two groups, the customer
pressures-GLM path is not equal. The signiﬁcant path coefﬁcient
is higher than that under low environmental regulatory pressure
(see Table 5 Panel B). The results support Hypothesis 5a, indicating
that the positive relationship between customer pressure and GLM
is stronger when environmental regulatory pressure is high than
when it is low. Next, we tested Hypothesis 5b, the moderator
effect of environmental regulatory pressure on the economic
(Ddf¼ 1)¼1.55 (p40.05) suggests that
pressure-GLM path. The Dw2
across the two groups, the economic pressure-GLM path is equal,
providing no support for Hypothesis 5b. We repeated the multi-
group analysis for testing Hypotheses 6a and 6b. The results
shown in Table 5 revealed that the GLM-environmental perfor-
mance path is signiﬁcantly different across the high- and low-
environmental regulatory pressure groups, lending support for
Hypothesis 6a that the GLM-environmental performance path is
stronger when manufacturers encounter higher level of environ-
mental regulatory pressure. For Hypothesis 6b, the results show
that the GLM-operational performance path is stronger when
environmental regulatory pressure is higher than when it is low.
The results of the multi-group analysis are summarized in Table 5.
The plots of the relationships under high and low level of
environmental pressures in Figs. 3–6 suggest that the effects of
customer and economic pressures on GLM implementation, and
the effect of GLM on environmental and operational performance
are enhanced in the presence of higher environmental regulatory
pressure.

are used, reduce speciﬁc environmental impacts of production
activities, and bring about environmental improvements. China’s
integration into the world’s economy began three decades ago
after its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). This
economic integration made China, particularly for those of the
manufacturing exporters, depends more upon the international
trade. Yet, China has evolved as an international manufacturing
powerhouse serving the global production demands. The com-
mensurate emissions that are produced during the manufacturing
processes have triggered substantial environmental burdens and
resource scarcity within China. These developments highlight

important implications for Chinese manufacturers who are con-
sidered as the major polluters and resources consumers. Increas-
ingly, there are international and domestic pressures urging
Chinese manufacturers to tackle the environmental issues caused
by their growing industrial activities. As a part of the world
factory, Chinese manufacturing exporters can contribute by
producing, distributing, and packaging merchandises with more
environment-friendly alternatives,
increasing the efﬁciency of
materials use through waste minimization and recycling, and
changing the composition of output by using materials that are
less harmful to the environment. Investigation of the antecedents

and consequences of adopting GLM will be helpful for Chinese
manufacturing exporters to understand the importance of green
logistics and overcome the trade barriers given the rising inter-
national concerns relating to the development and distribution of
products in world trade.

The literature has increasingly focused on the ability of ﬁrms
to ease environmental problems by making resources less waste-
ful and thus more sustainable, while retaining the basic system
of capitalist production and consumption. GLM can be seen by
manufacturing enterprises not as a ‘problem’, but more as an
‘opportunity’. Due to rising costs of materials and resources
scarcity such as rare metals, it can be a proﬁtable source for
manufacturers to recycle expensive materials from used products
such as mobile phones and consumer electronics. The importance
of investment recovery for Chinese manufacturers through better
utilization of scrap and used materials has also been emphasized
in the literature [32]. Yet, understanding of how effectively manu-
facturers can reduce environmental impact in product distribu-
tion throughout the product life cycle to meet this goal lags
far behind. The limited empirical evidence on the links between
GLM and performance provides little clue on the motivations for
adopting GLM, and speciﬁcally how manufacturers can leverage
GLM as a part of their environmental strategy to improve
performance.

Environmental management and sustainable logistics is an
emerging research area tackling such issues as pollution and
waste reduction in manufacturing processes. Our study is one of
the ﬁrst attempts to ﬁll this void by identifying and specifying the
management practices that are attributable to GLM. Based on our
interviews and survey data, we have developed and empirically
validated the GLM construct characterized with four attributes,
namely procedure-based, evaluation-based, partner-based, and
general environmental management practices. These attributes of
GLM suggest the importance of developing formal procedure and
assessment on the effort of GLM practices that enables continuous
improvement, while communicating with stakeholders on its
performance impact. The four attributes of GLM that we offer
are unidimensional and actionable measures that can indicate
where a manufacturer is headed in its efforts to manage logistics
in an environment-friendly manner. Understanding the four
attributes of GLM are essential for managers to develop proce-
dures, perform evaluation, involve partners, and adopt general
environmental practices integrating the environmental concerns
of the physical ﬂows (from production, distribution, to disposal)
throughout the life-cycle of products in support of both environ-
mental and productivity improvements as envisaged in a circular
economy.

Prior work has shown that environmental management in the
supply chain does matter for performance [58]. Our empirical
results substantiate this argument and ﬁnd that regulatory
pressure moderates the performance link. Speciﬁcally, GLM is
positively associated with environmental performance in redu-
cing carbon emission, waste water, solid waste, and consumption
of hazardous materials. It also contributes to various operational
performance aspects covering product quality, shortened lead
time, and reduced waste in production, allowing manufacturing
enterprises a better cost position to compete in the international
market. The environmental and operational beneﬁts of GLM are
highlighted with manufacturers implementing GLM more inten-
sively to experience productivity and reduced pollution in a
greater extent.

Our study ﬁndings indicate customer pressures for environ-
mental protection are positively related to the implementation of
GLM by Chinese manufacturing exporters. This result is consistent
with our theorization and echo the view that ﬁrms in emerging
countries pursue GLM in response to customer requirements such

as obtaining ISO 14000 certiﬁcation [59] and retrieving reusable
products from the market with a view to keep customers for
continued businesses [60]. Government and other public pres-
sures, growth in environmentally savvy customers, and enhanced
export and sale to foreign customers after the entry of China into
the WTO have collectively led to an increasing number of Chinese
manufacturing exporters to begin implementing environmental
management practices such as GLM. In line with the structuration
theory, these social conditions can inﬂuence and shape the
international
logistics operations of Chinese manufacturing
exporters. With relative scarcity of resources and the potential
pressure of ‘‘green barriers’’
in international trade, both the
Chinese government
and manufacturing enterprises have
had increasing reasons to initiate and take corporate and indus-
trial environmental management measures. Recently, China has
surpassed Japan as the second world’s largest economic entity
due largely to continuous internationalization of Chinese-made
products but this achievement also creates environmental con-
cerns. In response, the Chinese government has implemented the
circular economy law since 2009 so as to alleviate the contra-
diction between rapid industrialization and shortages of
resources, where GLM can be an answer for achieving this goal.
Other than domestic regulations, there are pressures attributable
to international forces stemming from foreign governments, non-
government bodies, consumers, and multi-national corporation
[32]. For example, extended producer responsibility has been
adopted in the European Union legislation for the reduction of the
amount of packaging waste, end-of-life vehicles, and electrical
and electronic wastes [61]. This trend for increased environmen-
tal responsibility to upstream manufacturers will accelerate
because a growing number of governments including China have
incorporated extended producer responsibility into their environ-
mental policy. However, economic pressures for environmental
protection as reﬂected by increasing cost of disposal, potential
savings from materials, and subsidies from government, are found
to have no association with implementing GLM by Chinese
manufacturing exporters. In the case of recycling mobile phone
in China,
it recovers only materials, where no component,
assembly or packaging energy is recovered at the end of product
life [62]. Even though rare metals such as palladium and tantalum
can be extracted from waste electronic appliances, efﬁcient
collection is a signiﬁcant hurdle to undertake recycling rendering
weak economic grounds for manufacturers to embark on GLM.
Another plausible reason is the lack of growth capacity through
cost reduction as they already command the status of low-cost
producers. The legitimacy to conform to the appeal of the inter-
national markets on environmental protection seems to be a more
salient incentive for Chinese manufacturing exporters to pursue
GLM. This is in line with the ex ante managerial belief of ‘‘it pays
to be green,’’ explaining the unattended economic opportunities
of green practices [34].

When Chinese manufacturing exporters are confronted with
environmental regulatory pressures at a high level, the positive
effects of GLM on environmental and operational performance are
enhanced. These differential strengths of performance outcomes
suggest that environmental regulations appear to be useful as a
guideline to direct the GLM efforts of manufacturers to improve
performance. Similar moderating effect of environmental regula-
tory pressure is also found on the relationship between customer
pressure and GLM. As regulatory pressure is a contextual condi-
tion governing organizational actions, environmental regulations
reinforce customer pressure to accelerate the implementation of
GLM by Chinese manufacturing exporters. New insights are
obtained in that environmental regulations are valuable for
enhancing the institutional legitimacy on the implementation of
GLM by Chinese manufacturing exporters and strengthening their

279

performance outcomes. Nevertheless, the moderating effect of
environmental regulatory pressures is found insigniﬁcant on the
relationship between economic pressure and GLM, suggesting
that environmental regulations are less effective to bolster the
economic incentives for Chinese manufacturing exporters to
pursue GLM.

As a major manufacturing country, GLM has become more
critical for Chinese manufacturing exporters, which enjoy many
international business opportunities but also encounter substan-
tial environmental burdens with this opportunity. The appropri-
ate development of the GLM concept and practices may indeed
aid Chinese manufacturing exporters by lessening the environ-
mental burden of development, distribution, and disposal of
products, while even potentially improving their efﬁciency and
economic positioning. The GLM construct encompasses a series of
managerial actions on environmental-based logistics manage-
ment with its four attributes to supplement these actions, which
can be developed into an inimitable bundle of resources for
superior performance. Thus, GLM as we conceptualize it can be
viewed as a composite of the underlying belief, environmental-
based logistics management, and the concurrent capabilities that
a manufacturer develops. One example to illustrate is Yidian, Inc.
that believes in preserving energy and resource consumption
through GLM.
It is an aluminum plate Chinese manufactur-
ing exporters in Luoyang, Henan Province. For managing its
growing international sales network (spanning from USA, Russia,
Germany, to South Africa) and stringent environmental regula-
tions in overseas countries, Yidian considers it strategically
important to develop and adopt environmentally responsible
management practices. In reengineering its workﬂows, Yidian
has relocated the aluminum molding production line close to its
electrolysis factory, eliminated steps of transporting the alumi-
num solution from the factory to the production line. Subsequent
to this elimination of inbound logistics process, the production
cost per kilogram of each aluminum plate is lowered from RMB
410 to RMB 148, saving RMB 80 million per year and reducing the
annual emission of sulfur dioxide (a greenhouse gas that causes
acid rain) by 60%.

The study results have implications for manufacturing enter-
prises to improve their GLM and hence performance. Like all
strategic international logistics operations, manufacturers need to
balance the costs of investment in the implementation of green
practices that may be offset by commensurate beneﬁts in terms of
improved productivity and environmental performance. In view
of the growing customer expectations for environmental protec-
tion, our results suggest that manufacturers can meet such
pressure by implementing GLM which is conducive to environ-
mental and operational performance improvement. Although the
economic beneﬁts of GLM implementation (e.g., disposal cost
increase and reduction of material cost) may not be realized as an
opportunity, manufacturers can beneﬁt from such implementa-
tion by catering to the customer expectation through retrieving
reusable products and participating in customers’ product return
program.

Our study also highlights that the importance for manufac-
turers to comply with environmental-based regulations to excel.
While implementing GLM can improve manufacturers’ environ-
mental and operational performance, such improvements are
more apparent when they comply with both the local and
international environmental regulations. Thus, manufacturers
adopting the four attributes of GLM should take account of the
regulations related to their products as well as international
logistics operations to strengthen their performance outcomes.
By using our measurement scale, manufacturers may assess and
identify the areas of their GLM for improvement actions. Those
who are new to adopting GLM can also make use of the scale in

structuring their assessment, reporting, and monitoring mechan-
isms of green logistics activities.

9. Limitations and future research

Although our study has validated the attributes of GLM and
established the links of implementing GLM with its antecedent
factors and consequent performance outcomes, longitudinal stu-
dies would help understand whether the nature of the beneﬁts
accrued is indeed long-term. Linkages within the attributes of
GLM, similar to the strengthening environmental-based logistics
management due to regulatory pressures, could also be examined
with longitudinal data. Richer insights might be available if future
studies are conducted across different and speciﬁc industrial
sectors such as telecommunication equipment component man-
ufacturing [63]. Factors such as knowledge management, infor-
mation integration, organizational
innovation, and market
orientation can be inﬂuential determinants of a manufacturer’s
positional advantages [64]. Future studies are also encouraged to
analyze how the ratio of local and export sales volume by
manufacturing exporters is related to their level of environmental
regulation pressures encountered and hence the implementation
of GLM by them. Recently, Chinese manufacturing exporters are
presented with pressure of accelerated inﬂation and export price
due to rise of RMB exchange rate. GLM can be a valuable approach
for them to improve operational performance. Future studies may
investigate how GLM is ﬁnanced under changing international
economic development. It is possible for the ﬁnancial investments
in GLM contributed by partners in the global logistics chain,
including third party logistics providers, wholesalers, and retai-
lers, which operate in various geographic locations spanning
different countries. Future empirical studies could examine the
relative contribution of GLM to performance and the collective
contribution of all these factors together to a manufacturer’s
performance outcomes.

While this study focuses on the management practices of
physical product ﬂow throughout a product life cycle, rather than
speciﬁc environmental activities, such as recycling, recovery,
remanufacturing, and reuse, this study provides insights into
the dimensions of GLM that are instrumental to manage and
reduce damages caused to the environment. Future research may
identify and examine speciﬁc organizational environmental prac-
tices that are useful in mitigating adverse environmental impact
arising from industrial operations.

As an initial exploration of GLM in emerging countries, the
sample frame of this study is conﬁned to export-oriented Chinese
manufacturers and we also encountered difﬁculty in empirical
data collection from them. Although our sample size and response
rate is similar to prior research that surveyed management
executives, such size may limit the generalizability of study
ﬁndings and the multi-group analysis result. The use of multi-
group analysis also requires the split of our sample into high and
low environmental regulatory pressure groups. Although multi-
group analysis allows us to examine the structural pressure–
practice–performance relationships for the manufacturing ﬁrms
characterized with different levels of environmental regulatory
pressures encountered, rather than merely testing the perfor-
mance impact of environmental regulatory pressure as an inter-
action term with the pressures and GLM practices. The sample
size for each group is relatively small in comparison to prior
studies using this analytical method. Our study establishes an
important step for GLM research in emerging countries, where
the level of environmental regulatory pressure faced by the
manufacturing exporters may vary due to the extent of their
export orientation. It is worthwhile for further research to collect


280

data from other countries with larger sample size to validate the
role of environmental regulations.

Successful implementation of GLM requires active involvement
of various parties, e.g., suppliers and customers, in the logistics
chain. The leadership of manufacturing exporters in pioneering
and diffusing GLM at the upstream can determine the implemen-
tation success of the downstream partners. Leadership issues in
the logistics chain on the diffusion of environmental management
practices such as GLM are worthy of investigation to extend this
line of research. It is also useful to examine how GLM can be
integrated with total quality management principles to continu-
ously improve quality in all aspects of the product life cycle to
exceed market expectations.

Our study examines only the moderating impact of environ-
mental regulatory pressures on the antecedents and conse-
quences of GLM, and other factors such as market uncertainty
and turbulence could be examined in future studies. On the
regulatory pressure, we did not differentiate such pressure
related to local and international regulations, which can be
considered by future studies to gain deeper insights on the
GLM-performance relationship. While the Chinese government
is supportive of environmental protection through initiating
discussions on global warming in such international arena as
the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenha-
gen, future studies may examine how Chinese government may
inﬂuence the institutionalization of GLM in the manufacturing
sector and in other industrial contexts such as shipping [65],
transport logistics [66], and the service sector [67]. After the
ﬁnancial tsunami in 2008, economic arguments of China with the
European Union and the United States on protectionism, trade
balance, and exchange rates become more frequent. There is also
rapidly growing industrial development at different Chinese
regions with varying investment efﬁciency [68]. How the inter-
national economic and political situations affect the investment
of Chinese manufacturing exporters on GLM and the coordination
among international logistics chain partners for the implementa-
tion are promising topics for investigation.

Appendix B. Exploratory interviews

Before administration of the mass survey to investigate the
research question of this study, we conducted interviews to
explore the environmental
issues in China, the attributes of
GLM, and the contextually embedded pressures that inﬂuence
GLM implementation and its success. We followed the grounded
theory [69] and conducted qualitative research to explore and
understand the pressures faced by Chinese manufacturing expor-
ters and their implementation of GLM. While the Chinese man-
ufacturers in Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China are mostly export
oriented and contribute to one-third of China export trade, we use

replication logic for multiple case studies to guide the selection of
manufacturers. Speciﬁcally, the manufacturing exporters are
deliberately selected from one case to the next based on the
matching of the underlying theory – the pressures faced by a
manufacturer or the GLM practices of a manufacturer would serve
as the basis to identify the next sample manufacturer. This
approach enables identiﬁcation of determinants that inﬂuence
GLM implementation and the attributes of GLM that are common
and important to the Chinese manufacturing exporters. We
conducted exploratory interviews with 35 managers from
exported-oriented manufacturing enterprises in Pearl River Delta.
To ensure the quality of the exploratory interviews, we fol-
lowed Yin’s [70] recommendations and used a case study protocol
and interview guide with interview questions to guide our collec-
tion of interview data. The key interview questions relate to: (1) Is
environmental concern more important in manufacturing than
before? (2) What capabilities are required for manufacturers to
implement GLM? and (3) What factors affect manufacturers most
in their implementation of GLM? We drafted the ﬁeld report for
each interview and returned it to the corresponding interviewee
for their review and comments. We identiﬁed the key pressures
and attributes of GLM by counting the pieces of evidence with
common theme, e.g., customer demand for environmentally
responsible products, economic pressures due to increasing price
of raw materials, management practices involved in logistics
management, and so forth. We then compared the case evidence
with insights from the literature on various organizational the-
ories to conﬁrm the determinants and attributes of GLM.

From the interview results, we identiﬁed four dimensions of
GLM practice with reference to the environmental management
and logistics literature. Most managers expressed the need for
environmental focus on their manufacturing outputs, especially
those targeted for export to developed nations with strict envi-
ronmental regulations. In the face of dwindling proﬁts and the
incessant rise of environmental awareness by customers, some
managers identify the economic and environmental potentials of
GLM. These potentials can be leveraged during the production and
distribution of their products with waste reduction and resources
conservation. Some managers mentioned that GLM needs formal
structures in organizational design with appropriate documenta-
tions and guidelines to successfully operate. Others noted that
management procedures, such as reporting systems, are required
to govern the implementation processes. We term this practice for
GLM as ‘‘procedure-based practices’’ that must be supplemented
with appropriate management practices to document and report
such green logistics activities as the percentage of used products
collected from the market and the percentage of those collected
items that are recycled. Managers also held the view that perfor-
mance outcomes must be monitored for ﬁrms to fully realize the
value of GLM. Thus, a ﬁrm should perform a periodic evaluation of
implementing GLM. As such, we term this practice as ‘‘evaluation-
based practices’’. Managers also commented that manufacturing
logistics involves partner relationships encompassing internal
staff as well as customers and suppliers where GLM requires their
participation to succeed. We term this practice as ‘‘partner-based
practices’’. Managers provided a further view that the GLM of a
ﬁrm should be transparent to its stakeholders and environmen-
tally responsible for its input and output processes in compliance
with the requirements of the international trade community by
implementing environmental management practices based on
international standards, e.g., ISO 14000. We term this practice as
‘‘general environmental management practices’’. Based on the
interview feedback, GLM is considered as a multi-dimensional
construct with these four attributes should we capture the basic
underlying managerial action and the management practices that
supplement this action.
