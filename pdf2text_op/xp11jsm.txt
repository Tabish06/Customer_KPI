This study uses the term of corporate associations to represent all the information that a
person holds toward a speciﬁc ﬁrm, and differentiates two key sub-dimensions of
corporate ability associations (CAA) (i.e. product quality and innovative ability) and
corporate social responsibility associations (CSRA) (i.e. philanthropic responsibility
and ethical responsibility). Further, a conceptual model is proposed to investigate how
these associations enhance customer relationship strength through different aspects of
trust. According to distinct sources, this study examines competence-based trust,
benevolence-based trust, and identity-based trust. A survey on young consumers is
conducted focusing on corporate brands providing electronic products in China.
Results support most hypotheses. Speciﬁcally, CAA can enhance competence-based
and benevolence-based trust while having no inﬂuence on identity-based trust. CSRA
affects relationship strength mainly through non-competence-based trust. Three
categories of trust all contribute to enhancing the company – customer relationship, and
interestingly identity-based trust is the most effective driver of relationship strength.

Keywords: corporate ability associations; corporate social responsibility associations;
trust; relationship strength

Introduction

Nowadays companies make all kinds of efforts in order to build long-term and strong
relationships with their customers (Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001). Enhancing corporate
capability in providing products/services and building a social responsible image are two
major and divergent strategies (Anderson & Sullivan, 1993; Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001).
For example, Lichtenstein, Drumwright, and Braig (2004) ﬁnd that companies reputable
for their high social responsibility are more likely to gain identiﬁed relationships with
customers. In addition, the strong connections between product quality and customer
satisfaction, trust and loyalty are well established in the literature (Anderson & Sullivan,
1993). Following Brown and Dacin’s (1997) deﬁnition, we use the term of corporate
associations to generically indicate all the information about a company that a person
holds (e.g. perceptions, inferences, beliefs). In other words, consumers transform all the
information about a company they obtain both actively or passively into their memory and
generate a dynamic knowledge network. From this perspective, consumers that hold
favorable associations on either corporate ability or social responsibility are more likely to

maintain active relationships with the focal company. Although the effectiveness of these
strategic initiatives in enhancing the customer – corporation relationship has received wide
support, the questions how they have impact and whether they work through different
mechanisms have not been answered. To address this academic gap, we propose a
conceptual model linking corporate associations (i.e. corporate ability associations and
corporate social responsibility associations) with customer – corporation relationship
strength through different types of trust.

Trust is regarded as a necessity in a variety of social exchange contexts, which determines
the nature of a relationship (Doney & Cannon, 1997; McAllister, 1995). Regarding the
customer–corporation relationships, building and maintaining customer trust is a top priority
for managers and thus becomes a core task for relationship marketing (Morgan & Hunt, 1994).
The construct of trust has rich conceptual connotations (Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis, 2007).
However, previous marketing studies mostly focus on investigating overall trust (see
exception in Sirdeshmukh, Singh, & Sabol, 2002). Social psychologists suggest that there are
different types of trust rooted in divergent trustworthy characteristics. For example, Mayer,
Davis, and Schoorman (1995) propose the evolution of interpersonal trust is dependent on
mutual judgment on ability/competence, benevolence, and integrity. Sichtmann (2007)
reveals that competence and credibility are the most powerful explanatory factors for building
trust in corporate brands. In addition, identity is another under-explored foundation to build
trust (Coleman, 1990; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Due to the signiﬁcant role of various
corporations in consumers’ self-deﬁnition and self-expression (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2003), it
is meaningful to examine identity-based trust in the context of corporation–customer
relationships. Therefore, we examine multiple dimensions of trust, namely competence-based
trust, benevolence-based trust, and identity-based trust, in this study.

In sum, this study intends to investigate how corporate ability associations (CAA) and
social responsibility associations (CSRA) contribute to customer relationship differently.
Speciﬁcally, a conceptual model linking corporate associations with multiple dimensions
of trust and ﬁnally customer – corporation relationship strength is examined.

Conceptual framework and hypotheses development

Corporate associations generically refer to all the information about a company that a
person holds (e.g. perceptions, inferences, beliefs) (Brown & Dacin, 1997). CAA is ‘the
company’s expertise’ and represents customers’ knowledge about a company in terms of
personnel expertise, R&D superiority, manufacturing expertise, industry leadership in the
industry, and so on (Brown & Dacin, 1997). CSRA represents customers’ knowledge about
corporate efforts in protecting and improving the welfare of society as a whole in addition
to the interest of organization (Davis & Blomstrom, 1975). As CAA and CSRA are both
broadly deﬁned concepts, each construct is composed of multiple dimensions. More
importantly, different dimensions have varying effects on consumer evaluation and
behaviors. In Carroll’s (1991) pyramid, corporate social responsibility involves multiple
layers, including economic responsibility, legal responsibility, ethical responsibility, and
philanthropic responsibility. In addition, Ellen, Webb, and Mohr (2006) suggest consumers
may classify corporate social responsible efforts, based on organizational motives, into
strategic, egoistic, stakeholder-driven, or value-driven categories. Further, consumers
exhibit
favorable evaluation on value-driven and strategic ones, but unfavorable
assessment on stakeholder-driven and egoistic ones. Luo and Bhattacharya (2006) propose
that consumers, to form CAAs, are concerned about not only the quality of corporate
offerings but also corporate innovation ability. They further reveal that corporate efforts in

building a social responsible image have no signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnancial performance
of ﬁrms with low ability in producing quality products, but have signiﬁcant negative
impact on ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms with low innovation ability. As such, this study
subdivides both CAA and CSRA, and focuses on two key dimensions of each construct.
Speciﬁcally, consistent with Luo and Bhattacharya’s (2006) classiﬁcation, CAA is
operationalized through product quality associations and innovation ability associations.
These two dimensions demonstrate superiority in different aspects of corporate ability
(ability to maintain existing products vs ability to develop new products) and emphasis
on divergent market strategies (exploiting existing needs vs satisfying changing and
emerging needs). Regarding CSRA, this study focuses on the ethical and philanthropic
layers in Carroll’s (1991) pyramid model. Reasons for such operationalization are twofold:
(1)
the economic responsibility in Carroll’s (1991) CSR pyramid shares much
commonality with the concept of CCA; and (2) ethical and philanthropic responsibilities
beyond economic and legal performance are better indicators of corporate motive to take
care of the whole society rather than only considering self-interest, therefore, are more
consistent with the deﬁnition of CSR in this study. Competence-based trust refers to
customers’ conﬁdence in a company’s ability to realize its promise. Benevolence-based
trust refers to customers’ conﬁdence that a corporation has a sincere concern about the
consumers’ interests and motivation to do good to its customers. Identity-based trust
builds up when a customer recognizes shared characteristics, values, and common goals
existing between a corporation and him/her (Coleman, 1990; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
Favorable CAA (i.e. expertise, R&D, and leadership) is accumulated essential evidence
in consumers’ mindset showing corporate superior competence. Corporate associations
related with product quality imply corporate ability to manage existing products and meet
current customer needs, while corporate associations regarding innovation ability indicate
corporate capability to develop new technology and design products with the hope of
satisfying frequently changing needs and market environment. All these perceptions and
evaluations on corporate ability can reduce perceived risk and increase customer conﬁdence
in corporate competence to perform as the corporation has promised, which subsequently
contributes to customer competence-based brand trust. In addition, companies with high
ability of providing quality/innovative products usually have more resources to make long-
term relationship investment and delight customers with additional beneﬁts. Real concern
for customer interests is an important motivation driving companies to persistently provide
good quality and innovation. It is possible for consumers to make such attribution.
Therefore, favorable CAA leads to positive perceptions on benevolence-based trust.
Moreover, favorable CAA is highly related with good reputation, prestige, expert,
activeness, leadership, and so on, and customers are more likely to ﬁnd similarity with good
companies. Therefore, favorable CAA leads to positive perceptions on identity-based trust.
In sum, we propose the following hypothesis:

H1:

Corporate ability associations can enhance (a) competence-based trust, (b)
benevolence-based trust, and (c) identity-based trust toward corporate brand.

Building a socially responsible image is beneﬁcial for companies to stand in a
competitively advantaged position in the current market place (Lichtenstein et al., 2004).
Enhanced credibility and customer trust are the key merits brought by favorable CSRA
(Hoefﬂer & Keller, 2002). CSRA indicates a company’s spirit and morals as well as the
value system guiding daily management (Brown & Dacin, 1997; Chappell, 1993). In
particular, the extent to which a company takes ethical responsibilities is a key practical
criterion to make judgment on whether the focal company behaves in an honest and reliable

way, and whether it adheres to the principles of justice and fairness during its interactions
with customers. Regarding the philanthropic aspect of CSRA, it is built on consumers’
perceptions on corporate contributions to the interests of the whole society and corporate
involvement in charitable causes. Typical examples of philanthropic responsibilities
include donation to education/sports causes, involvement in the community, and support of
environmentalism. Consumers that hold positive philanthropic associations are more
likely to believe the focal company as an amicable, caring, and helpful corporate citizen.
Such types of compassionate companies strive to treat others fairly, and customers as their
key stakeholders or partners will be deﬁnitely well taken care of. Therefore, favorable
CSRA has a positive effect on benevolence-based trust. Although not every consumer
applauds corporate socially responsible efforts, taking social responsibility is still a
generally appreciated business value. Yoon, Gu¨rhan-Canli, and Bozok (2006) ﬁnd that
people tend to use CSRA to draw inferences about individual characteristics of consumers
associated with a company. A consumer may ﬁnd shared characteristics and values between
a socially responsible company and his/her real self or ideal self. Moreover, taking social
responsibility is not inexpensive. Regardless of ethical or philanthropic responsibilities,
both ﬁnancial expense and managerial efforts are required. In this way, competent companies
have more resources to do this job. We cannot expect a company striving for survival
make much investment in charitable causes. As such, CSRA facilitates development of
competence-based trust. In sum, we propose the following hypothesis:

H2:

Corporate social responsibility associations can enhance (a) competence-based trust,
(b) benevolence-based trust, and (c) identity-based trust toward corporate brand.

Despite the widely recognized multidimensional conceptualization of trust, limited
research has investigated and compared different dimensions in relational evolution (see the
review by Colquitt, Scott, & LePine, 2007). Trust dimensions based on different sources
may have varying effects on maintaining and reinforcing relationships. Aaker, Fournier, and
Brasel (2004) propose the concept of relationship strength, which refers to the durability and
effectiveness of a relationship and includes multiple dimensions of satisfaction, intimacy,
commitment, and self-connection, to illustrate the quality of a customer–corporation
relationship. Regarding the relationship between a company and its customers, three trust
dimensions may all be able to enhance overall customer–brand relationship strength.

Satisfaction, commitment,

intimacy, and connection, which respectively capture
different connotations of a corporation – customer relationship, all contribute to relationship
strength. Satisfaction is an overall attitudinal evaluation, involving both cognitive and
affective factors. As some aspects of trust (i.e. competence-based trust and benevolence-
based trust) facilitate constructive cognitive judgment, and others (i.e. benevolence-based
trust and identity-based trust) motivate pleasant emotions, all dimensions of trust
can increase customer brand satisfaction. Much evidence supports the notion that
providing products of high quality is a necessary and key approach to satisfying customers
(Anderson & Sullivan, 1993). In addition, companies characterized with innovative minds
and actions may be more capable of identifying and then satisfying ever-changing customer
needs. They even delight customers by exceeding customer satisfaction (e.g. Bitner,
Brown, & Meuter, 2000). Therefore, CAA enhances customer conﬁdence in enjoying a
pleasing consumption experience by using its offerings. In interpersonal relationships,
intimacy between partners increases with occurrence of closer ‘physical, mental, and social
association’ (Oden, 1974, p. 3). By deﬁnition, identity-based trust develops when customers
are knowledgeable about and sympathize with the corporation’s values, goals, and so on.
In this way, consumers are connected with the focal corporation psychologically and

socially. Physical contact and improved understanding contribute to the formation of
intimate relationships. In addition, caring and giving are important features of intimate
relationships. Benevolent corporations are characterized as caring and sincere toward
consumers as well as the whole society. Therefore, benevolence-based trust is another
determinant of an intimate relationship. Moreover, the positive effect of overall trust on
commitment has been well established in the literature (Morgan & Hunt, 1994).

The psychological basis for individuals to form connected relationships with
companies (i.e. incorporation of the company into self-concept) is that consumers may
use products/companies to realize self-deﬁnition, self-approval, and self-enhancement.
Therefore, consumers engage in a matching process to select the company with an identity,
to a greatest extent, consistent with their self-images (Dolich, 1969). When consumers hold
high conﬁdence in commonality between a corporate brand and themselves in terms of
value, goals, and thinking, they are more willing to incorporate the corporation into self-
concept and connect themselves with companies. In sum, we propose the following
hypotheses and a conceptual framework shown in Figure 1.

H3:
H4:
H5:

Competence-based trust can enhance customer relationship strength.
Benevolence-based trust can enhance customer relationship strength.
Identity-based trust can enhance customer relationship strength.

The conceptual framework explaining the whole corporate association relationship

strength mechanism is shown in Figure 1.

Methodology

Data collection and sample

We conducted a survey focusing on corporate brands providing electronic products. This
research context was selected because of several reasons. First, a large number of
corporate brands exist in these industries, leading to multifarious corporate associations in
consumers’ mindset. Second, some corporations in these industries in the Chinese market
make much effort in taking social responsibility, through environment-friendly operation,
donation to charitable causes, involvement in the community, and so on, while others act
in a socially irresponsible way. Discrepant organizational behaviors provide a real-life

foundation for developing varying corporate social responsibility associations. Third,
some electronic products are purchased not only to meet functional needs but also to
obtain social and affective beneﬁts. Fourth, a pretest (N ¼ 21) indicates that young
consumers are generally familiar with electronic products.

The questionnaire was written in Chinese and the procedure of translation and back-
translation was employed to make sure of the appropriate translation of all items. Before the
main study, the questionnaire was also pretested with another 18 respondents to ensure its
clarity and understandability. After some minor modiﬁcations were made accordingly,
239 students from various departments in a top university in China were recruited as
respondents in exchange for 5 RMB (0.7$). In completing the questionnaire, respondents
were ﬁrst exposed to a brief introduction about the purpose of this research. Then they were
asked to write down a corporate name that satisﬁes two criteria: (1) they are familiar with;
and (2) they currently have one or more of its offerings. After that, respondents answered a
set of structured questions concerning the key constructs. They also provided individual
information at the end of the questionnaires. Finally, they were thanked and paid.

Measures

Measures for the key constructs are mostly adopted or adapted from previous research.
Relationship strength, including dimensions of intimacy, commitment, satisfaction, and self-
connection, is measured using the scales of Aaker et al. (2004) and Escalas and Bettman
(2003). Scales of competence-based trust and benevolence-based trust are adapted from
Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, and Dirks (2004), McAllister (1995), and Sirdeshmukh et al. (2002).
We employ the modiﬁed identity-based trust scale proposed by Lewicki and Bunker (1996)
and originally designed for interpersonal relationships within organizations. Corporate
ability associations are operationalized through product quality scale (Berens, van Riel, &
van Bruggen, 2005; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006) and innovative capability (e.g. Brown &
Dacin, 1997). Corporate social responsibility associations are operationalized through ethic
and philanthropic responsibilities and measured by scales of Brown and Dacin (1997) and
Grunig (1979). Relationship length and competition intensity are incorporated as two control
variables. Relationship length is measured by two items, namely ‘I have been in a relationship
with this corporation for a long time’ and ‘I just started to interact with this corporation.’
Competition intensity is measured by two items, namely ‘A limited number of competitors
exist in the market for this corporation’ and ‘The industry which the corporation focuses on is
competitive.’ As neither control variables have signiﬁcant effects on relationship strength
when trust variables are included, in the following section we will report results without
control variables. All items are measured by a seven-point scale and indicate satisfactory
reliability (Cronbach alphas . 0.7) (see Tables 1 and 2).

Results

Construct validity

Following Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988) two-step procedure, we ﬁrst conduct a
conﬁrmatory factor analysis on the measurement model before the simultaneous estimation
of the measurement model and the structural model. Speciﬁcally, the convergent and
discriminant validities of the focal constructs are evaluated through an 11-factor conﬁrmatory
measurement model. Results indicate that the measurement model has a satisfactory ﬁt with
data (x2 ¼ 2682.105, d.f. ¼ 1270, x2/d.f. ¼ 2.11; p , .001; CFI ¼ .97; TLI ¼ .96;
IFI ¼ .97; NFI ¼ .94; RFI ¼ .93, and RMSEA ¼ .068), verifying the unidimensionality of

the measures (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). Moreover, all indicators have signiﬁcant loadings
on the respective latent constructs ( p , .001) with the values varying from .616 to .882, and
the average variance extracted (AVE) indices of most constructs exceed the suggested
criterion of 0.5 except intimacy (0.44) and ethical corporate social responsibility associations
(0.48), thus conﬁrming good convergent validity (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988).

In addition, relationship strength is treated as a second-order construct embodying
multidimensions of intimacy, commitment, satisfaction, and self-connection in the con-
ceptual model. The second-order model of relationship strength (x2 ¼ 699.054, d.f. ¼ 185,
x2/d.f. ¼ 3.779; p , .001; CFI ¼ .97; TLI ¼ .96; IFI ¼ .97; NFI ¼ .95; RFI ¼ .94, and
RMSEA ¼ 1.08) and the ﬁrst-order model treating intimacy, commitment, satisfaction, and
self-connection as separate constructs (x2 ¼ 697.807, d.f. ¼ 183, x2/d.f. ¼ 3.813; p , .001;
CFI ¼ .97; TLI ¼ .96; IFI ¼ .97; NFI ¼ .95; RFI ¼ .94, and RMSEA ¼ 1.09) both show
acceptable and, more importantly, comparable model ﬁt. Therefore, in testing the connections
between trust and relationship strength, relationship strength is regarded as a second-order
multidimensional construct, which can reduce structural complexity and facilitate the
estimation process.

Further, Harman’s one-factor method is used to examine the existence of common
method bias. Speciﬁcally, an exploratory analysis of the data indicates no single factor
accounting for the majority of variance among the measures. Therefore, results of this
study are not vulnerable to common method bias (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). In sum, all
measures show good construct validities and desirable psychometric properties.

Hypotheses testing
Then, we conduct simultaneous estimation on both measurement and structural models.
While the chi-square statistic (x2 ¼ 3033.342, d.f. ¼ 1309, x2/d.f. ¼ 2.317, p , .001) is

H1 examines the effects of corporate ability associations on different aspects of trust.
Results indicate that corporate ability associations has positive inﬂuence on competence-
based trust (r ¼ 0.67, p , .001) and benevolence-based trust (r ¼ 0.26, p , .001), but no
signiﬁcant effect on identity-based trust (r ¼ 0.00, p . .1). Comparisons among the three
coefﬁcients imply that favorable ability associations consumers hold toward a company
are critical for building trust mainly through enhancing their perception on corporate
competence. Therefore, H1 is partially supported. H2 examines the effects of corporate
social responsibility associations on different aspects of trust. Results indicate that
corporate social responsibility associations can enhance competence-based trust (r ¼ 0.39,
(r ¼ 0.87, p , .001), and identity-based trust
p , .001), benevolence-based trust
(r ¼ 0.82, p , .001). Comparisons among the three coefﬁcients imply that corporate
efforts in building a social responsible image are worthwhile and beneﬁcial in terms of
gaining customer trust, in particular through enhancing perceptions on benevolence and
matched identity. Therefore, H2 receives supports from empirical evidence.

H3, H4, and H5 intend to explore how different aspects of trust with divergent origins
impact relationship strength. Results indicate that the customer – corporation relationship
can be strengthened by all competence-based trust (r ¼ 0.43, p , .001), benevolence-
based trust (r ¼ 0.20, p , .01), and identity-based trust (r ¼ 0.59, p , .001). It seems that
identity-based trust has the strongest effect
in enhancing the customer – corporate
relationship, which is followed by competence-based trust and then benevolence-based
trust. Therefore, H3, H4, and H5 are all supported.

To further explore whether different aspects of trust are the main routes through which
corporate associations inﬂuence customer – corporation relationship strength, we test the
mediating role of multiple dimensions of trust. Speciﬁcally, we compare the direct effects
of corporate ability associations and social responsibility associations on relationship
strength in two models respectively. Multiple dimensions of trust perform as intermediate
variables between corporate associations and relationship strength in one model (model 1),
while they are not linked to corporate associations in the other model (model 2). If model 2
has more signiﬁcant and/or stronger linkages of corporate associations – relationship
strength than model 1, the mediating role of trust can be conﬁrmed (Baron & Kenny,
1986). Results indicate that when multiple aspects of trust are incorporated, the direct
effect of corporate ability associations on relationship strength is weakened from .53
( p , .001) in model 2 to insigniﬁcancy (r ¼ 0.12, p . .1) in model 1, and the direct effect
of corporate social responsibility on relationship strength is weakened from .38 ( p , .001)
in model 2 to insigniﬁcancy (r ¼ 0.10, p . .1) in model 1. Therefore, multiple dimensions
of trust together play mediating roles in the linkages between corporate associations and
customer – corporation relationship strength.

Discussion and implications

This study investigates the underlying pathways through which corporate associations affect
relationship strength by trust based on different sources. We consider both CAA (i.e. quality
and innovation associations) and CSRA (i.e. philanthropic and ethical associations) as
second-order constructs. Results indicate that CAA can enhance customer perceptions on
competence-based trust and benevolence-based trust while having no inﬂuence on identity-
based trust. CSRA can enhance customer perceptions on all three categories of trust.

Especially, social responsibility associations affect relationship strength mainly through non-
competence-based trust. In addition, all three categories of trust contribute to strengthened
company–customer relationships. Satisfaction, commitment, intimacy, and self-connection
are comprehensively considered as indicators of relationship strength. Interestingly, this
study reports that identity-based trust is the most effective driver of relationship strength.

This study implies that it is wise for managers to create corporate associations in
consumers’ minds dexterously using marketing tactics. Both favorable CAA and CSRA can
enhance company–customer relationship strength through different source-based trust.
First, favorable perceptions and beliefs on both CAA and CSRA can be processed and
transformed into benevolent beliefs by consumers, and subsequently enhance customer
relationship with the focal corporation. Second, corporate performance on taking
philanthropic and ethical responsibilities leads to an enhanced relationship due to favorable
trustworthiness perceptions of benevolence and identity. Particularly, identity-based trust is
a major route through which social reasonability associations inﬂuence the customer
relationship. This ﬁnding supports the notion that consumers become increasingly concerned
about how a corporation shoulders its social responsibility as a social citizen. Because of
perceived shared values and identity, consumers are more willing to interact with a socially
responsible corporation than its irresponsible competitors. It implies that companies, when
conducting cause marketing, could emphasize the linkage between corporate initiative and
consumer individual values/goals, which facilitates the development of identity-based trust
and subsequently contributes to relationship quality. Third,
inconsistent with our
expectation, the ﬁndings suggest that corporate ability associations (e.g. product quality,
reliability) have nothing to do with identity-based trust. One potential reason for the
insigniﬁcant relationship could be the selected research context of electronic product
corporations. The common electronic products, such as cell phones, digital cameras, and
TVs, are generally cheap and do not vary much in quality. It is very possible that results will
be different when the study is set in a context of more expensive and ﬁxed products/services,
such as automobiles and jewelry. This possibility should be addressed in future studies.
