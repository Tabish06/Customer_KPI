 Investors, Corporate Social Perfor-
 mance and Information Disclosure:

 An Empirical Study

 Barry H. Spicer

 ABSTRACT: The objective of this study is to provide some empirical evidence relevant
 to the social performance disclosure question. To provide this evidence, the investigation
 concentrated on ascertaining the validity of a widely stated view of some investors that
 a moderate to strong association exists between the investment value of a company's
 common shares and its social performance. This was achieved by testing for associations
 between a number of economic and financial indicators of investment value (profita-
 bility, size, total and systematic risk, price/earning ratio) and corporate performance on
 one key social issue (pollution control) in a sample of companies drawn from a pollution
 prone industry. Some statistically significant associations were found to exist although
 there was a reduction in the level of these associations over time. While generalization
 of these results will require further research, the findings reported are consistent with
 stated investors' perceptions.

 O VER recent years there have been
 mounting social, political and eco-
 nomic pressures on corporate
 managements to pay greater attention to
 the wider social and environmental con-
 sequences of corporate activities in the
 decision-making process (cf., McKie
 [ 1 974] and Sethi [ 1 974]). These pressures,
 in turn, have resulted in a number of
 proposals aimed at the development and
 application of better methods of mea-
 suring, assessing and controlling the
 social performance of private enterprise
 with respect to issues of social concern
 such as environmental protection, racial
 and sexual discrimination and consumer
 policies. (cf., Longstreth and Rosen-
 bloom [1973], Council on Economic
 Priorities [1973, 1974], Baumol [1972]
 and Kapp [1973]). One such proposal is
 for the accounting profession to develop
 the capacity, i.e., theories, criteria and
 methodologies, to measure and report on

 all or various aspects of corporate social
 performance (Beams and Fertig [1971],
 Abt [1972], Linowes [1968, 1973], Colan-
 toni, Cooper and Dietzer [1972], Brum-
 met [1973], Bedford [1973], Est-s [1972,
 1975] and Seidler [1975]). Along these
 lines, the Study Group on the Objectives
 of Financial Statements [1973, pp. 53-55]
 has proposed that:

 An objective of financial statements is to re-
 port on those activities of the enterprise af-
 fecting society which can be determined and
 described or measured and which are impor-
 tant to the role of the enterprise in its social
 environment.

 I would like to thank W. Felix, Jr., G. Sundem and K.

 In general terms the normative ques-
 tion for accounting policy makers im-
 plicit in this latter proposal is whether
 corporations should be required to dis-
 close more information than they now
 do on their social performances with re-
 spect to issues of social concern. The reso-
 lution of this question poses a significant
 challenge for the future development of
 accounting theory and practice. It fore-
 shadows both a fundamental change in
 disclosure philosophy and a significant
 expansion in the subject matter- of ac-
 counting. Such an expansion carries with
 it implications for the specification of
 decision-makers of interest; the contents
 of financial statements, reports and other
 corporate disclosures; the properties of
 events and phenomena to be measured;
 legitimate techniques to be employed in
 measurement and the cost of information
 to decision-makers. A number of these
 issues are now, or recently have been, the
 subject of committee deliberations and
 reports by all major accounting bodies in
 the United States (American Accounting
 Association [1971, 1972, 1973, 1974,
 1975], National Association of Accoun-
 tants [1974] and Gaede [1974]). In addi-
 tion, a number of these issues have been
 the subject of recent hearings and rule-
 making by the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and the basis of a number of
 serious attempts by accounting academ-
 ics to develop a comprehensive theory of
 corporate social reporting (Estes [1975],
 Ramanathan [1976]).

 The developments in social accounting
 described above provide the motivation
 for this research, the general objective of
 which is to provide some empirical evi-
 dence which is relevant to the social per-
 formance disclosure question. To provide
 this evidence, the investigation concen-
 trated on judging the validity of a widely
 held view among investors that a mod-
 erate to strong association exists between

 the investment value of a company's
 common shares and its social perfor-
 mance. If such an association can be
 empirically demonstrated, it may provide
 a partial explanation of why increasing
 numbers of decision-makers in society,
 including investors, are seeking (and
 producing) information on corporate
 social performance to supplement or
 complement information that currently
 appears in financial statements and other
 corporate disclosures. In addition, it
 may strengthen the position of those who
 are presently seeking increased disclosure
 by corporations of their performance
 with respect to key social and environ-
 mental issues.

 The study is structural as follows: The

 first section looks briefly at the percep-
 tions of investors with respect to the
 relationship between the worth of a
 corporation's shares and its social per-
 formance and provides the basis for
 forming a number of testable hypotheses
 about these perceptions. These hypothe-
 ses are presented in the second subdivi-
 sion. The next three sections discuss the
 selection of a sample and the collection
 of data, the quantification of variables
 and the choice of a time period for the
 empirical investigation. The sixth sub-
 division presents the results of a series of
 statistical tests of the hypotheses. The
 final section presents a brief summary and
 conclusions.

 INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS OF RISK/RETURN
 AND CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE
 Traditionally, it has been assumed that

 investors will act in accordance with
 their economic interests when choosing
 from among alternative investments in
 common stocks, i.e., that they will seek
 the maximum possible return in terms of
 capital gains and dividends given their
 risk preferences. However, rising public
 concern over the social and environmen-

 tal consequences (side-effects) of cor-
 porate activities has resulted in a situa-
 tion in which two essentially new factors
 have been, introduced into investment
 decision-making.

 its securities. Under these conditions, it
 would not be surprising to find knowl-
 edgeable investors considering a corpora-
 tion's social performance in making their
 investment decisions.

 The first of these is that public concern
 over the side-effects of corporate activi-
 ties has lead to new and increasingly
 stringent sanctions against certain types
 of corporate activities. The second is an
 increase in the number of investors who,
 on the basis of moral or ethical predilec-
 tions (or because of pressure from various
 sources), believe they should avoid in-
 vesting in certain classes of corporations,
 i.e., those that are thought to be causing
 social injury or environmental damage of
 one type or another. While the propor-
 tion of investors that might be categor-
 ized as fitting into this "ethical investor"
 category is unknown, those who are
 concerned have become increasingly visi-
 ble in recent years (for example, the
 investors who hold shares in the highly
 publicized cleann 1 mutual funds, the
 investment objectives of which explicitly
 include social objectives or criteria).
 While the existence of this category of
 investors raises some interesting issues in
 regard to investment decision-making
 and information disclosure, the first fac-
 tor, i.e., the possibility of increasingly
 costly sanctions being applied to certain
 types of corporate activities, is of primary
 interest in this study.

 The sanctions that have been applied
 increasingly to corporate activities which
 have been judged to be socially undesira-
 ble include legislative enactments, gov-
 ernment regulation, judicial decisions
 and consumer retaliation. Clearly, when
 severe and costly sanctions are invoked,
 the expected economic impact on the
 affected corporation may be sufficient to
 induce a direct relationship between its
 social performance on certain key issues
 (e.g., pollution control) and the worth of

 A review of the published comments of

 investors in general and of a survey of
 institutional investors by Longstreth and
 Rosenbloom [1973] on this topic reveals
 a seemingly widespread view within the
 investment community that a moderate
 to strong association does exist between
 the risk/return profile of a corporation's
 securities and its attention to certain key
 issues of social concern. For example,
 based on 115 responses from the 196
 representative institutional investors sur-
 veyed, Longstreth and Rosenbloom
 found that 66 institutional investors
 (57.4 percent of responses) indicated that,
 in addition to strictly economic factors,
 they also consider social factors in the
 selection and retention of investments.
 Of these 66 institutional investors, 32
 indicated that they avoid certain types
 of investment as being socially undesir-
 able, immoral or contrary to institutional
 purpose. Seventeen institutional inves-
 tors (mostly religious organizations and
 insurance companies) indicated that a
 portion of their investment portfolio is
 directed towards socially oriented invest-
 ments and that economic factors are not
 the primary motive. Thirty-nine institu-
 tional investors (mostly banks and mu-
 tual funds) suggested that an association
 exists between socially responsible busi-
 ness enterprises and those that will pro-
 duce a satisfactory monetary return.
 Forty-nine institutional investors (42.6
 percent of responses) indicated that
 recently they have reviewed, or currently
 are reviewing, the social aspects of their
 investment policy. Twenty-seven institu-
 tional investors (23.5 percent of re-
 sponses) indicated that they have estab-
 lished special procedural mechanisms to

 take social considerations into account
 in the investment process or have pro-
 duced policy statements on the matter.

 While specific findings on the range of
 opinion held by each type of investor
 will not be repeated here (see Longstreth
 and Rosenbloom [1973, pp. 41-70]), the
 general findings presented above are
 sufficient to confirm the existence of a
 widespread view among an influential
 set of investors' that an association does
 exist between a corporation's social per-
 formance and its value as an investment.
 Predictably, the rationale given for this
 association by such investors is eco-
 nomically oriented. It recognizes that
 socially undesirable corporate activity
 may result in costly sanctions against the
 offending corporation in times of rapid
 social change and a heightened public
 awareness of the interplay between cor-
 porate operations and issues of social
 concern. The following comments of
 institutional investors reported by Long-
 streth and Rosenbloom [1973, pp. 62-63]
 capture the essence of this view:

 mental awareness and expectation of
 firms, there are many potential legal and
 economic risks to which the capital
 market is becoming increasingly sensi-
 tive. In Narver's opinion, failure of
 corporate management to respond to
 these expectations in a "socially responsi-
 ble" fashion may induce the capital
 market to perceive lower expected earn-
 ings and/or impute a higher risk factor
 resulting in a lower present value of the
 firm.

 Bowman [1973] agrees with the prem-
 ise that corporate expenditures in the
 general area of externalities (side-effects)
 may benefit a corporation over the longer
 run in a number of ways. One such benefit
 would accrue if investors associate lower
 levels of risk with the common stocks of
 corporations that demonstrate adequate
 social concern than with those that do
 not. Where such a tendancy is widespread
 amongst investors Bowman [1973, p. 34]
 argues:

 ... a long term economic perspective neces-
 sarily involves some social considerations,
 since a company with egregious pollution or
 employment problems is likely to bear eco-
 nomic consequences at a future date.

 ... if the emphasis on increased corporate
 responsibility continues, it would appear that
 adverse activities in any of the major (social)
 areas could conceivably have an effect upon
 the company's industry position, the accep-
 tance of its shares in the market and thus a
 direct bearing on the investment merits of the
 company for our accounts.
 This perception of an association be-
 tween corporate social performance and
 the overall desirability of that corpora-
 tion for investment purposes is not con-
 fined only to the investment community.
 It also enjoys considerable currency in
 the academic community. For example,
 Narver [1971 ] argues that given a society
 in which there is an ever-rising environ-

 ... it may well have an effect on the price/
 earning ratio that is "assigned" a company.
 In other words, the market's perception of
 corporate responsibility may affect the price
 of the stock and, therefore, the investor's re-
 turn (where both dividends as well as capital
 gains are considered as included in total re-
 turn). In addition to this direct effect, the
 price of stock will have subsequent effects on
 the cost of capital to the growing company
 and, utimately on its earnings.

 1 Dyckman, Downes and Magee [1975] argue that the

 conditions of an efficient market at the semi-strong level
 can be created even where there are substantial numbers
 of naive investors if the market includes a large group of
 professional investors who in essence "make the market."
 If it is true that this latter group of investors act as price-
 makers, then the statements of professional institutional
 investors with regard to the association they believe to
 exist between the risk/return profile of a corporation's
 securities and its social performance (or with regard to
 how they have attempted to integrate investment goals
 with social objectives) supplies valuable information on
 the formal and informal decision processes of an in-
 fluential sector of the capital market. This information
 is critical to the formulation of the hypotheses tested in
 this study.

 98 The Accounting Review, January 1978

 Along somewhat similar lines, Bragdon

 and Marlin [1972, p. 12] have written:

 From the longer term perspective, investors
 in stocks and bonds are becoming increasingly
 worried about the downside risk associated
 with companies having a poor pollution-
 control record. This may reduce the price
 that investors will pay, thereby increasing the
 cost of capital for companies that pollute.

 However, Bowman was the only one
 encountered in a review of the literature
 who attempted to extend the risk/return
 argument into the context of recent re-
 search in portfolio analysis and capital
 market theory. Bowman [1973, p. 34]
 states:

 ... many institutional investors now argue
 that the corporation which is not responsive
 to corporate social responsibility will be a
 more risky investment. While it is true, per-
 haps, that the research mentioned above does
 not focus on this kind of risk because it deals
 with statistical risk rather than latent risk
 (or "systematic risk" rather than "residual
 risk"), and though it is probably overly sim-
 ple to summarize this argument so briefly,
 this is equivalent to stating that the corpora-
 tion which is not socially responsible may be
 a security investment for its stockholder in
 the class of portfolios suggested by point B on
 the chart [the class of inefficient portfolios].
 In other words, the investor could have ob-
 tained lower risk (in the sense used here) with
 the same return or, if he had chosen, a higher
 return with the same risk.

 The questions of interest here is
 whether the presumed association be-
 tween corporate social performance and
 the investment worth of a corporation's
 securities is borne out by actual observa-
 tion. The next section discusses the devel-
 opment of testable hypotheses based on
 investors' stated perceptions reviewed
 in this section.

 DEVELOPMENT AND STATEMENT

 OF HYPOTHESES

 Development of testable hypotheses to

 investigate the empirical validity of some
 investors' assertions of an association

 between the investment worth of a cor-
 poration's securities and its social per-
 formance must deal with two problems:
 how to measure the investment worth of
 a corporation's securities, and how to
 measure a corporation's social perfor-
 mance.

 The strategy adopted here with respect
 to the first problem was to focus attention
 on a limited number of economic or
 financial indicators that are in common
 use by investors in assessing the worth of
 a security for their investment portfolios
 and which have been widely discussed in
 the literature. On this basis, the indi-
 cators chosen for inclusion in this study
 are profitability, size, total risk, syste-
 matic risk and a price/earnings ratio.
 How each of these indicators was mea-
 sured is discussed later.

 The second problem mentioned above
 is difficult. Any complete measure of
 corporate social performance would re-
 quire (1) the specification of those factors
 or components that can properly be said
 to be part of a corporation's social per-
 formance (2) the measurement of perfor-
 mance with respect to each of these
 factors or components; and (3) the sum-
 marization of these measures into a vec-
 tor of indices or one overall index of some
 type. The strategy adopted here was to
 avoid, as far as possible, the current con-
 troversy over these issues by considering
 corporate social performance with re-
 spect to one key issue of social concern.
 The performance area chosen for this
 purpose was a corporation's record with
 respect to pollution control. This was
 chosen because a strong a priori argu-
 ment can be advanced that it is a major,
 if not dominant, social issue for certain
 classes of corporations.

 The basis for this contention is as
 follows. First, there is considerable pub-
 lic pressure for environmental protection
 and pollution abatement. A study

 by Coppock, Dierkes, Snowball and
 Thomas [1972] of the content of three
 weekly news magazines (Newsweek, Time
 and Business Week) found that environ-
 mental protection issues accounted for
 35 percent of all pressures on the business
 community to perform better in areas of
 social concern over the 1965-1971 period
 (a percentage that grew from 25 percent
 of all pressures in 1965 to 58 percent of
 all pressures in 1971). As reported by
 Evans [1975, p. 19], these findings are
 supported by a public opinion poll con-
 ducted by the Opinion Research Cor-
 poration in August, 1975, on public
 attitudes towards environmental trade-
 offs. On the basis of their public survey,
 the Opinion Research Corporation con-
 cluded:

 The opinions of people at all levels of so-
 ciety indicate that environmental protection
 has become a relentless, institutionalized,
 mass movement with the potential to change
 the future course of industrial history. Equally
 important, current economic problems facing
 the nation, despite their distressing effect on
 so many segments of the population, do not
 seem to have dispelled the public's basic de-
 sire for permanent pollution controls. All
 together, business seems to have little choice
 but to adapt to and attempt to capitalize on
 the long term implications of the environ-
 mental protection movement.

 A second and related source of evi-
 dence for the contention may be found
 in a review of the economic impact of
 recent federal and state initiatives in the
 area of pollution control on private in-
 dustry as a whole and in their differential
 impacts on selected industries.2 Based on
 rough estimates prepared by the Council
 on Environmental Quality [1973; p. 92
 and 1974, p. 175], private industry over
 the period 1973-1982 is expected to
 expend $30.5 billion (in 1973 dollars) on
 capital investments and $45.7 billion on
 operating and maintenance costs in order
 to cut emissions of air and water pollu-

 tants sufficiently to meet standards set by
 the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Federal
 Water Pollution Control Act Amend-
 ments of 1972. Differential economic im-
 pacts on various industries can be judged
 from the following statistics. In 1970,
 only one industry (iron and steel) spent
 more than 10 percent of its capital budget
 on pollution abatement. (McGraw Hill
 (1970)). By 1973 there were four indus-
 tries spending in excess of this percentage
 (nonferrous metals 31.1 percent, paper
 18.8 percent, iron and steel 16.3 percent,
 and petroleum 10.3 percent). Estimates
 for 1974 indicated that six industries
 would spend in excess of 10 percent (non-
 ferrous metals 25.6 percent, iron and
 steel 22.3 percent, paper 20.1 percent,
 clay and glass 16.8 percent, petroleum
 13.4 percent, chemicals 11.6 percent and
 stone). (Council on Environmental Qual-
 ity [1974, pp. 233-236.]) These percent-
 ages refer to capital expenditures only
 and do not include operating and mainte-
 nance expenditures, which are expected
 to make up about 60 percent of total
 expenditures on pollution abatement.
 Other studies of the total and differential
 economic impact of recent pollution con-
 trol requirements have been conducted
 (see Council on Environmental Quality
 [1972, p. 287]), but the figures reviewed
 are sufficient to provide a reasonable
 basis for the inference that pollution con-
 trol is a major problem for corporations
 in pollution-prone industries.

 The following operational hypotheses,
 derived primarily from the stated per-
 ceptions of investors and others reviewed
 in the previous section (but subject to the
 modifications discussed above), were sub-
 jected to statistical testing. The associ-

 tion control at the federal level include the Clean Air
 Act of 1970; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
 Amendments of 1972; the Resource Recovery Act of
 1970 and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

 ated null hypothesis in each case is a
 hypothesis of no difference.

 Hypothesis I

 Companies with better pollution con-
 trol records have higher profitability
 than companies with poorer pollution
 control records.

 Hypothesis 2

 Companies with better pollution con-
 trol records are larger in size than
 companies with poorer pollution con-
 trol records.

 Hypothesis 3

 Companies with better pollution con-
 trol records have lower total risk than
 companies with poorer pollution con-
 trol records.

 Hypothesis 4

 Companies with better pollution con-
 trol records have lower systematic risk
 than companies with poorer pollution
 control records.

 Hypothesis S

 Companies with better pollution con-
 trol records have higher price/earningS
 ratios than companies with poorer
 pollution control records.
 The selection of a sample and the col-

 lection of data, the measurement of vari-
 ables and the choice of a time period for
 hypothesis testing purposes are discussed
 in the next three sections.

 SAMPLE SELECTION AND

 DATA COLLECTION

 The sample selected for the investiga-

 tion consisted of 18 firms in the pulp and
 paper industry. This particular sample
 was chosen for two reasons. First, a
 major issue of social concern arising out
 of the operation of firms in the pulp and
 paper industry is the resulting pollution
 of air and water resources. This conclu-
 sion is supportable in that (as indicated in
 the preceding section) the paper industry

 is included among those industries which
 spend substantial proportions of their
 capital and operating and maintenance
 budgets on pollution abatement. Further-
 more, a review of Standard and Poor's
 Surveys of the Paper Industry since 1970
 shows that industry analysts believe that
 the pressure on the industry to abate its
 pollution is of major economic signifi-
 cance. The 1972 survey (p. 18) contains
 this statement:

 Of the clouds that overhang the industry, the
 question of costs of pollution control and
 preservation of the environment is perhaps
 the darkest.... Overall, it may be said that
 the question of pollution control is going to
 be exerting considerable pressure on manage-
 ment of paper companies for some time. On
 the immediate horizon is the threat of a zero
 pollution bill that would prohibit any pollu-
 tion by 1985. Versions of the bill have been
 passed by both the House and Senate. It is
 estimated that such zero-discharge would re-
 quire an expenditure of $5 billion to $8 billion
 by 1985. Considering that the industry's total
 net worth is only $10.7 billion, this is not a
 good prospect.

 Second, the firms selected to make up

 the sample were included among the 24
 firms in the pulp and paper industry
 whose pollution control records were the
 subject of two major studies by the
 Council on Economic Priorities (CEP)
 [1970, 1972]. In these studies the CEP,
 based on the compilation of extensive
 data, rated each of the 131 pulp mills
 owned by study firms on the efficacy of
 their air and water pollution control
 systems. This data is essential to the
 empirical investigation because it pro-
 vides the basis for the construction of a
 number of pollution control indices that
 provide measures of a firm's relative
 pollution control record at a point in
 time. The CEP rating system and the
 derivation of pollution control indices are
 discussed later.

 All financial data on the various com-
 panies were taken from the annual

 COMPUSTAT tape. Monthly stock price
 data were obtained from the quarterly
 COMPUSTAT tape, supplemented where
 necessary by other sources.

 Of the 24 companies studied by the
 CEP, four were excluded because each
 had less than 25 percent of their sales in
 the paper industry. While the 25 percent
 sales requirement is admittedly arbitrary,
 the rationale of using some such cutoff is
 to include in the sample only those com-
 panies whose record in pollution control
 in the paper industry is likely to be con-
 sidered by investors in making investment
 decisions. Two companies were excluded
 because their financial data were not
 available on the annual COMPUSTAT tapes.
 The remaining 18 firms making up the
 sample are listed on the New York Stock
 Exchange and appear generally, to be,
 representative of the larger firms in the
 pulp and paper industry. Of these 13 firms
 had from 50 to 100 percent of their sales
 in the paper industry with the other five
 firms having between 25 and 50 percent.

 SPECIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

 OF VARIABLES

 Empirical testing of the five hypotheses
 set forth above requires measurement of
 a number of variables for companies in
 the sample. The paragraphs below indi-
 cate how each of these variables was
 quantified. The time periods for which
 these measurements were made are dis-
 cussed in the following section.

 Pollution con trol record

 The measurement of each company's
 pollution-control record was achieved

 by deriving several pollution-control in-
 dices from the basic data published by
 the CEP [1970, 1972] on the pollution-
 control systems employed by each com-
 pany in their pulping facilities. The CEP
 study focussed on virgin pulping facilities
 of each company because it concluded
 that these operations generate the most
 severe pollutants of all paper production
 processes. Because of this conclusion,
 the CEP [1970, p. 43] maintains that the
 pollution-control performance of each
 company in this area should provide a
 rough measure of the seriousness of its
 overall abatement activities. The CEP
 study rated each mill on the efficacy of its
 air and water pollution control systems.
 Water pollution-control systems were
 rated on the "adequacy" of primary,
 secondary and tertiary treatment facilities
 installed; air pollution-control systems
 were rated on the "adequacy" of controls
 over particulate emissions (from both
 power and production equipment) and
 gas and odor emissions. An "adequate"
 rating was assigned on the basis of an
 overall evaluation of installed equip-
 ment's ability to meet "state of the arty
 criteria which are essentially the highest
 level of control technologically and eco-
 nomically achievable. This is a flexible
 concept which changes over time as new
 and more efficient pollution-control
 methods become available.3 The ratings
 provided by the CEP studies [1970, 1972]
 were used to develop the following indices
 for each company:

 (1) A pollution index based on the
 percentage of the company's pulp and
 paper productive capacity' (tons/day) with

 3Further information on the criteria used by the CEP
 may be obtained from Chapters III and V of the original
 study. While there may be disagreement over the method
 used by the CEP to make its evaluation, it does have two
 important virtues. First, it is literally the only extensive
 evaluation available. Second, the criteria correspond
 fairly closely to recent legislative requirements, i.e., those
 promulgated under the Federal Water Pollution Control
 Act Amendments of 1972.

 adequate pollution-controls. This per-
 centage was determined by taking a
 simple average of the percentages of pro-
 ductive capacity with: (a) adequate pri-
 mary water pollution controls; (b) ade-
 quate secondary water pollution con-
 trols; (c) adequate controls over particu-
 late emissions; and (d) adequate controls
 over gas and odor emissions. For exam-
 ple, a company would be assigned a
 pollution index of 50 if it had a produc-
 tive capacity of 5,000 tons per day of
 which (a) 80 percent has adequate pri-
 mary water pollution-controls, (b) 40
 percent has adequate secondary water
 pollution-controls; (c) 50 percent has
 adequate controls over particulate emis-
 sions and (d) 30 percent has adequate
 controls over gas and odor emissions.
 Hereafter, this index will be referred to as
 the pollution index based on productive
 capacity or, simply, the pollution index
 (productive capacity).

 (2) A pollution index based on the
 percentage of a company's pulp and
 paper mills with adequate pollution-
 controls. This percentage was determined
 by taking a simple average of the percent-
 age of mills with: (a) adequate primary
 water pollution-controls; (b) adequate
 secondary water pollution-controls; (c)
 adequate controls over particulate emis-
 sions; and (d) adequate controls over gas
 and odor emissions. Hereafter, it will be
 referred to as pollution index based on
 mills or, simply, the pollution index
 (mills).

 The first index, which incorporates a
 measure of the size of mills, i.e., pulp and
 paper productive capacity, is conceptu-
 ally superior to the second index, which
 treats all mills equally. Given the wide
 variations in mill size and the different
 levels of expenditure necessary to clean
 up mills of various sizes, the better
 measurement of a company's perfor-
 mance will be provided by the pollution

 index based on productive capacity. In
 this respect, it is worthwhile noting that
 the Environmental Protection Agency
 has recognized that a few large plants in
 a few industries are responsible for most
 of the pollution problems and have
 structured control strategies to focus on
 the largest polluters first (Council on
 Environmental Quality [1973, p. 280]).
 Even so, the derivation of both of these
 indices is open to criticism. First, the two
 indices weigh water pollution and air
 pollution systems equally, whereas it can
 be argued that the adequacy of water
 pollution systems is more important in
 that greater expenditures are required to
 mitigate water pollution. Second, it
 would be desirable to utilize water usage
 rather than productive capacity or num-
 ber of mills due to differences in mill effi-
 ciencies in this respect. Unfortunately,
 water usage data was incomplete in the
 CEP studies. However, within limits, it is
 felt that each index provides a reasonable
 (and useful) assessment of the relative
 pollution control records of each of' the
 companies studied.

 Pro/itcbilit l. The measure of profitabil-

 ity is the average of annual ratios of
 income available for stockholders to
 ending common stockholder's equity
 over the chosen sample time period.

 Sife. The measure of size is the average
 of the natural logarithms of the yearly
 total asset size over the chosen sample
 time period. Total assets represent cur-
 rent assets plus net plant plus other non-
 current assets.

 Price/Elarnings Ratio. The price/earn-

 ings ratio used in this study is an average
 of the annual price/earnings ratios over
 the chosen sample time period.

 Market Measures of Risk. Two market

 measures of risk were used in this study.
 The first provides a measure of total risk
 of an individual security and was com-
 puted as the standard deviation of peri-

 odic stock returns for each company in
 the sample over the chosen sample time
 period. However, if investors are con-
 cerned with the selection of optimal in-
 vestment portfolios, rather than with
 individual securities per se, the appropri-
 ate measure of risk of a security is its
 contribution to the total riskiness of the
 portfolio as a whole. This measure of a
 security's riskiness, referred to as its
 systematic or nondiversifiable risk, was
 the second measure of risk used in this
 study. It was estimated from the market
 or diagonal model as developed by
 Sharpe [1963]. The contribution of the
 individual security to portfolio risk, i.e.,
 the security systematic risk, is given by
 the security's fi. Estimates of individual
 /3's for the time period under study were
 obtained in the usual manner by running
 a time-series least squares regression on
 monthly price data for the chosen sample
 period. The measure of general market
 conditions (the market factor) utilized
 was Standard and Poor's Composite
 Price Index.

 THE CHOICE OF A TIME PERIOD

 There were a number of ways a time
 period could have been chosen for the
 purpose of measuring the financial and
 economic variables referred to in the
 previous section. One obvious alterna-
 tive was to use single year data for 1970
 and 1972, the years that the CEP released
 its reports on the pollution-control rec-
 ords of sample companies. This alterna-
 tive was rejected because a review of
 financial data taken from the COMPUSTAT
 tape revealed substantial year to year
 changes around the two CEP report
 years. These changes raised a question
 about the degree to which the financial
 variables (in particular, profitability and
 the price/earnings ratio) based on yearly
 data could be considered as representa-
 tive of the longer term performances of

 the sample companies. It was this con-
 cern that prompted consideration of a
 longer time period which would tend to
 smooth out year-to-year changes and
 result in measures of financial and eco-
 nomic variables that were more generally
 representative of the relative performance
 of sample companies. Thus, two sets of
 time periods spanning a number of years
 were chosen. The first was a six-year
 period from 1968 through 1973. The
 second consisted of two overlapping
 three-year periods from 1969 through
 1971 and from 1971 through 1973.

 The 1968 through 1973 time period.
 This specific six-year time period was
 chosen for several reasons. First, it spans
 a period of significant growth in public
 pressure for environmental protection
 and pollution control (cf. Coppock et al.
 (1972)) as well as a period in which two
 major and far reaching pieces of environ-
 mental legislation were enacted, the
 Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Federal
 Water Pollution Control Act Amend-
 ments of 1972. If the hypothesized associ-
 ations are to be observed, it is reasonable
 to expect to observe these associations in
 a time period characterized by intense
 pressure for pollution abatement. Second,
 the 1968 through 1973 time period en-
 compasses the two CEP report periods of
 1970 and 1972. For the purposes of the
 empirical investigation, the two sets of
 pollution indices derived from the CEP
 reports data initially were interpreted in
 the following way. The pollution indices
 from the 1970 data were viewed as pro-
 viding surrogates for the average re-
 sponsiveness (social performance) of
 sample companies to public pressure for
 pollution abatement over the 1968-1973
 period. While this interpretation is open
 to criticism because it ignores the data
 contained in the CEP's 1972 report, it
 does have the advantage of providing a
 measure of the responsiveness of sample

 companies to public pressure before such
 pressures were formalized in federal anti-
 pollution statutes. However, to deal with
 the criticism that the CEP's 1972 data
 should not be ignored, another measure
 of companies' pollution-control records
 was derived by taking a simple average of
 the 1970 and 1972 pollution indices.
 The resulting average pollution indices
 also can be interpreted as surrogates for
 the average responsiveness of sample
 companies to anti-pollution pressures.
 In this case, the average indices reflect
 corporate responsiveness prior to the
 passage of anti-pollution legislation to-
 gether with corporate responses to the
 mandates of this legislation.

 The 1969-1971 and 1971-1973 timle
 periods. These two overlapping three-
 year time periods were chosen because it
 was recognized that there may be some
 reluctance to accept the interpretations
 of the 1970 and average pollution control
 indices discussed in the preceeding para-
 graph. In the empirical tests utilizing
 these time periods, the 1970 pollution-
 control indices were tested for association
 with the financial and economic variables
 measured over the 1969-1971 period.
 The 1972 pollution-control indices were
 tested for association with the financial
 and economic variables measured over
 the 1971-1973 period. In each case, a
 time period spanning a number of years
 was used for the measurement of finan-
 cial variables to smooth out the year to
 year changes in the financial data of the
 sample companies.

 EMPIRICAL TESTS AND RESULTS

 The five hypotheses investigated were
 that companies with better pollution-
 control records have: (1) higher profit-
 ability; (2) larger asset size; (3) lower
 total risk; (4) lower systematic risk; and
 (5) higher price/earning ratios, than
 companies with poorer pollution-control

 records. The associated null hypothesis
 in each case is a hypothesis of no differ-
 ence. These hypotheses were investigated
 with the following nonparametric statisti-
 cal tests: (1) the Spearman Rank Corre-
 lation Coefficient, ro, which provides a
 measure of association between two
 variables measured in or transformed
 into ranks; and (2) the Mann-Whitney U
 test, which provides a test for determining
 whether two independent samples are
 drawn from the same population. Non-
 parametric tests were chosen because, in
 most cases, the distributions underlying
 variables of interest, i.e., the pollution
 indices and the accounting based ratios
 were not known.

 The use of more than one statistical
 model to investigate essentially the same
 five hypotheses introduces an element of
 redundancy into the results of the analy-
 sis. However, the tests do utilize different
 parts of the information contained in the
 sample data and, in addition, manipulate
 these data differently. It follows that if
 these different statistical procedures yield
 essentially equivalent results, then greater
 confidence can be placed in the results of
 the tests than would be the case if one
 test were used alone.

 Enmpirical Tests and Results Based on
 the 1968-1973 Time Period

 The five hypotheses, initially, were in-
 vestigated by measuring the degree of
 association between each pair of vari-
 ables of interest utilizing Spearman's
 Rank Correlation Coefficient, r'. Table I

 of interest. The level of significance as-
 sociated with each rs is given in brackets

 test) the levels of significance shown gen-
 erally support the operational hypotheses
 under investigation. Table 1 also shows
 that correlation coefficients based on
 measurement of companies' pollution-
 control record by the pollution index
 (productive capacity) tended to be more
 significant than those based on measure-
 ment by the pollution index (mills).

 The Mann-Whitney U test also was
 used to test each of the five hypotheses.
 To obtain the two sample groups required
 for this test necessitated splitting the
 overall sample into two groups on the
 basis of their pollution control records.
 One way to do this would be to split the
 sample into two equal groups on the basis
 of their pollution control records placing
 those companies with the best records
 (as determined by a ranking according to
 pollution-control indices) in one group,
 and those companies with the worst
 records in the other. However, in order

 to overcome some of the ambiguity re-
 garding the classification of companies
 with "intermediate" pollution-control
 records, the sample was grouped into
 "best," "intermediate" and "worst" as
 shown in Table 2. Those companies with
 "intermediate" pollution-control records
 then were dropped and the Mann-
 Whitney U test was used to determine
 whether the two groups of companies
 with the best and worst pollution-control
 records could have been drawn from the
 same population with respect to profit-
 ability, size, total risk, systematic risk
 and a price/earnings ratio. The results of
 these tests are shown in Table 3.

 The results of the Mann-Whitney test
 shown in Table 3 are generally consistent
 with those of the Spearman Rank Cor-
 relations shown in Table 1. Once again,
 it is not possible in all cases to reject a
 null hypothesis of no association between
 variables of interest at a .05 level of
 significance for a one-tailed test. How-

 tematic risk and the price/earnings ratio
 with the 1970 pollution index (productive
 capacity) are significant at the .05 level
 for a one-tailed test. The other two
 variables of interest, i.e., profitability and
 total risk, show slightly lower associ-
 ations. However, a perusal of the Spear-
 man Rank Order Correlations and the
 results of the Mann-Whitney U tests for
 the 1971-1973 period show a marked re-
 duction in association for all pairs of
 variables of interest (except profitability),
 although all signs on the rs in Table 4 re-
 main in the hypothesized directions.
 This reduction in the levels of observed
 associations is due primarily to the
 marked improvement in the pollution-
 control records of sample companies
 from 1970 to 1972 as measured by the
 pollution index (productive capacity).
 The degree of improvement in this index
 is shown in the Appendix, and is most
 probably due to the response of sample
 companies to the mandates of anti-
 pollution statutes passed and regulations
 promulgated or threatened in the 1970-
 1972 period. With all sample companies,
 irrespective of profitability, size, risk or
 price/earnings ratios being forced to
 abate their pollution or face the threat of
 enforcement, it is not surprising to find
 an improvement in sample companies'
 pollution indices and a concomitant re-
 duction in the observed association be-
 tween the pollution index and each of
 the variables of interest.

 On the basis of these results and the re-

 sults of preceeding tests, the following
 conclusions seem reasonable. From the
 associations found between variables of
 interest for the 1968-1973 time period, it
 appears that the most profitable, larger
 companies in the sample tend to have the
 best pollution-control records and that
 these companies, in general, were judged
 by investors to be less risky in terms of
 both total and systematic risk. In addi-

 tion, these companies were awarded gen-
 erally higher price-earnings ratios than
 companies with poorer pollution-control
 records. These results constitute a con-
 firmation of investor's perceptions as re-
 viewed earlier in the paper. The associ-
 ations found for the 1969-1971 time
 period support the results obtained for
 the entire 1968-1973 time period. How-
 ever, an inference that might be drawn
 from the marked reduction in associ-
 ations for the 1971-1973 time period is
 that such associations may be relatively
 short-lived phenomena under circum-
 stances where public pressure results in
 legislation which requires significant pol-
 lution abatement on the part of sample
 companies.

 These results may be compared to
 those of an earlier study by Bragdon and
 Marlin [1972] which attempted to refute
 the view that pollution control is in-
 compatible with profits. Their study, like
 the research reported here, utilizes the
 data reported by the CEP on the pollu-
 tion-control records of 24 companies in
 the pulp and paper industry. The meth-
 odology they employed was to test the
 association exhibited between prior pro-
 fitability over the 1965-1970 period and
 three measures of a company's pollution
 control record using Spearman's Rank
 Correlation Coefficients. All signs of co-
 efficients were in the expected direction,
 i.e., positive, which they claim support
 ". ... the thesis that pollution control and
 profitability are compatible." While not
 strictly comparable due to a different
 sample and a different time period being
 selected, Bragdon and Marlin's results,
 at least, are not inconsistent with the re-
 sults obtained in this study.

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

 This study was motivated by recent
 proposals for the accounting profession
 to measure and report on companies' per-

 formances with respect to issues of social
 concern such as environmental protec-
 tion, racial discrimination, product
 safety, etc. The general objective was to
 provide some evidence, although of a
 preliminary nature, which is relevant to
 the social performance disclosure ques-
 tion. The question of whether informa-
 tion on corporations' social performances
 on certain key social and environmental
 issues should be disclosed is currently
 under consideration by the SEC and
 other accounting policy makers.

 The empirical investigation concen-
 trated on ascertaining the extent to
 which investor perceptions of a moderate
 to strong association between the invest-
 ment worth of a corporation's securities
 and its social performance on key social
 issues appeared warranted. This was
 achieved by testing for associations be-
 tween a number of economic indicators
 of investment worth and corporate per-
 formance with respect to one key social
 issue, pollution control. Some statistic-
 ally significant associations were shown

 to exist between corporations' pollution-
 control records (as defined in the study)
 and a number of other financial or
 economic variables of interest. Specific-
 ally, it was found that, for a sample
 drawn from the pulp and paper industry,
 companies with better pollution-control
 records tend to have higher profitability,
 larger size, lower total risk, lower sys-
 tematic risk and higher price/earnings
 ratios than companies with poorer pollu-
 tion-control records. However, as it also
 was found that there was a marked re-
 duction in these associations over a
 period of time for the sample companies,
 these findings must be tempered by an
 understanding that such associations
 may be relatively short-lived phenomena
 under circumstances where public pres-
 sure results in legislative mandates with
 respect to pollution abatement. While
 generalization of these results beyond the
 pulp and paper industry will require
 further research, the findings reported
 are consistent with stated investor per-
 ceptions.
