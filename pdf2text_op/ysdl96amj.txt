 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,
 MANUFACTURING STRATEGY, AND

 FIRM PERFORMANCE

 This study examines two alternative views-universal and contin-
 gency-of the human resources (HR)-performance relationship in man-
 ufacturing settings. Results from a survey of 97 plants primarily support
 a contingency approach to human resource management (HRM). An
 HR system focused on human capital enhancement was directly related
 to multiple dimensions of operational performance (i.e., employee pro-
 ductivity, machine efficiency, and customer alignment), but subsequent
 analysis revealed that this main effect was predominately the result of
 linking human-capital-enhancing HR systems with a quality manufac-
 turing strategy. Other manufacturing strategies also moderated the HR-
 performance relationship.

 It has become a widely held premise that people provide organizations

 with an important source of sustainable competitive advantage (Prahalad,
 1983; Pfeffer, 1994; Wright, McMahan, & McWilliams, 1994) and that the
 effective management of human capital, not physical capital, may be the
 ultimate determinant of organizational performance (cf. Adler, 1988; Reich,
 1991). The value of human capital may be especially apparent in modern
 manufacturing organizations that have invested heavily in production inno-
 vations such as advanced manufacturing technology, statistical process con-
 trol, and computer numerically controlled machine tools. Such initiatives
 tend to depend heavily on employee skills and commitment as key compo-
 nents in the value creation process (cf. Snell & Dean, 1992). Accordingly, it
 is instrumental for manufacturing firms to harness the productive potential
 of their employees in order to achieve superior performance.

 Though human resource (HR) activities are frequently acknowledged to

 play a central role in linking employee capabilities with the performance

 requirements of a firm, the specific form of this relationship is still open
 to debate. To date, two primary perspectives-a universal approach and a
 contingency approach-have been used to describe the link between human
 resource management (HRM) and firm performance. The universal, or "best
 practices," perspective implies a direct relationship between particular ap-
 proaches to human resources and performance, and the contingency perspec-
 tive posits that an organization's strategic posture either augments or dimin-
 ishes the impact of HR practices on performance. Analytically, this
 distinction has been operationally defined as main effects for the universal
 perspective and as interaction (or moderation) effects for the contingency per-
 spective.

 Although on the surface the universal and contingency perspectives may
 appear to be competing, we would argue that they can be complementary.
 A good deal of evidence suggests that individual HR practices, as well as
 internally consistent systems or bundles of HR practices, can indeed directly
 influence organizational performance (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995;
 Kleiner, Block, Roomkin, & Salsburg, 1987; Kochan & Osterman, 1994; Mac-
 Duffie, 1995; Osterman, 1994; Pfeffer, 1994; Russell, Terborg, & Powers, 1985;
 Terpstra & Rozell, 1993). Going beyond these direct HR-performance relation-
 ships, however, other evidence suggests that the impact of HR practices on
 firm performance may be further enhanced when practices are matched with
 the competitive requirements inherent in a firm's strategic posture (e.g.,
 Cappelli & Singh, 1992; Jackson, Schuler, & Rivero, 1989; Miles & Snow,
 1984; Wright, Smart, & McMahan, 1995). In short, the universal approach
 helps researchers document the benefits of HR across all contexts, ceteris
 paribus, and the contingency perspective helps us look more deeply into
 organizational phenomena to derive more situationally specific theories and
 prescriptions for management practice. Although support for one perspective
 over another is ultimately an empirical issue, the two perspectives are not
 necessarily mutually exclusive.

 As stated at the outset, these points are particularly germane to ongoing
 debate within the field of modern manufacturing management. In particular,
 the jury is still out on the value of "deskilling" versus "upskilling" ap-
 proaches to HRM in manufacturers (Hirschhorn, 1984; Kern & Schumann,
 1990; MacDuffie, 1995; Majchrzak, 1988; Walton & Susman, 1987; Zuboff,
 1988). Indeed, many have taken the position that the upskilling or deskilling
 decision ultimately rides on the particular manufacturing strategy a firm
 adopts (Klein, 1991; Parthasarthy & Sethi, 1992; Upton, 1995). To date, how-
 ever, much of the evidence remains anecdotal and continues to blur the
 distinction between what authors say manufacturers should do and what
 has actually worked in practice. With these issues in mind, we conducted
 this study with three overall objectives: to (1) determine the extent to which
 HR systems directly enhance performance, (2) analyze the moderating effects
 of manufacturing strategy on the relationship between HR and operational
 performance, and (3) assess the extent to which particular manufacturing
 strategies and HR systems are actually used in conjuction with one another

 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

 To explore the relationships among HRM, manufacturing strategy, and

 performance, we first examine the theoretical and empirical support for both
 the universal and contingency perspectives.
 The Universal Approach to HRM

 Over the years, researchers have amassed a fair amount of empirical

 evidence that certain HR practices can directly affect firm performance. For
 example, studies show that comprehensive selection and training activities
 are frequently correlated with both productivity and firm performance
 (Kleiner et al., 1987; Russell et al., 1985; Terpstra & Rozell, 1993; U.S. Depart-
 ment of Labor, 1993). More recently, researchers have found that bundles, or
 systems, of HR practices had more influence on performance than individual
 practices working in isolation (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995; MacDuffie,
 1995). An underlying theme in this research is that firms should create a
 high degree of internal consistency, or fit, among their HR activities. As Baird
 and Meshoulam emphasized, a firm's HR activities "must fit with and support
 each other" (1988: 122) if peak organizational performance is to be achieved.

 Supporting the HR systems and internal fit viewpoints, Arthur (1992,

 1994) found that HR practices focused on enhancing employee commitment
 (e.g., decentralized decision making, comprehensive training, salaried com-
 pensation, employee participation) were related to higher performance. Con-
 versely, he also found that HR practices that focused on control, efficiency,
 and the reduction of employee skills and discretion were associated with

 increased turnover and poorer manufacturing performance. Similarly, in a
 study of high performance work practices, Huselid (1995) found that invest-
 ments in HR activities such as incentive compensation, selective staffing
 techniques, and employee participation resulted in lower turnover, greater
 productivity, and increased organizational performance through their impact
 on employee skill development and motivation.

 Although support for a universal, or best practices, approach to HR
 exists, there are notable differences across studies as to what constitutes a
 "best" practice (see Table 1 for a summary of best human resource practices).
 Nonetheless, several themes emerge across the studies. At their root, most
 of the studies focus on enhancing the skill base of employees through HR
 activities such as selective staffing, comprehensive training, and broad devel-
 opmental efforts like job rotation and cross-utilization. Further, the studies
 tend to promote empowerment, participative problem solving, and teamwork
 with job redesign, group-based incentives, and a transition from hourly to
 salaried compensation for production workers.

 The logic connecting these HR practices and firm performance is intu-
 itively appealing and supported by theoretical arguments from a number of
 disciplines. From micro economics, human capital theory suggests that peo-
 ple possess skills, knowledge, and abilities that provide economic value to
 firms. Since firm investments to increase employee skills, knowledge, and
 abilities carry both out-of-pocket and opportunity costs, they are only justi-
 fied if they produce future returns via increased productivity (Duncan &
 Hoffman, 1981; Rumberger, 1987; Tsang, 1987). In other words, increased
 productivity derived from human capital investments depends on the contri-
 bution of employees to a firm. Therefore, the higher the potential for employee
 contribution in a firm, the more likely it is that the firm will invest in
 human capital (via human resource management activities) and that these
 investments will lead to higher individual productivity and firm performance
 (Becker, 1976; Parnes, 1984). As many contemporary manufacturers are said
 to be increasing the potential for employee contributions in their production
 equations (Walton & Susman, 1987), human capital theory would suggest
 that HR practices can directly influence firm performance.

 From strategic management and organizational economics, the resource-
 based theory of competitive advantage focuses on the role internal resources
 like employees play in developing and maintaining a firm's competitive
 capabilities (Barney, 1991; Wright & McMahan, 1992; Wright et al., 1994).
 In fact, numerous researchers have recently noted that people may be the
 ultimate source of sustained competitive advantage since traditional sources
 related to markets, financial capital, and scale economies have been weak-
 ened by globalization and other environmental changes (e.g., Reich, 1991;
 Ulrich & Lake, 1990). Pfeffer (1994), in particular, has made the case that
 firms wishing to succeed in today's global business environment must make
 appropriate HR investments to acquire and build employees who possess
 better skills and capabilities than their competitors. These theoretical argu-
 ments, bolstered by available empirical evidence, point to the performance

 potential of a universal approach to HR focused on human capital enhance-
 ment. Accordingly, they suggest

 Hypothesis 1: A human-capital-enhancing human re-
 source system will be positively associated with opera-
 tional performance.

 A Contingency Approach to SHRM

 According to the contingency approach to strategic human resource

 management (SHRM), however, the impact of HR practices on firm perfor-
 mance is conditioned by an organization's strategic posture. For example,
 at a basic level, one might argue that HR is superfluous to performance in
 manufacturers unless human capital is somehow a central component of a
 firm's manufacturing strategy. That is, if a firm's approach to competition
 depends on, or makes use of, the talents and capabilities of employees,
 then HR practices would be more likely to have an impact on performance;
 otherwise the connection between HR and performance might be minimal.
 Indeed, the prevailing wisdom in manufacturing for many years was to re-
 place labor with physical capital, thereby minimizing the effect that employ-
 ees could have on performance and effectively removing HR from the produc-
 tion equation (Zuboff, 1988).

 Although some firms still compete this way, a variety of strategies are
 used in contemporary manufacturing settings. In general terms, researchers
 have made a distinction between "low road" strategies that focus on cost
 reduction and "high road" strategies tending to focus on quality, variety,
 or service (Osterman, 1994: 179). Breaking this distinction down further,
 researchers have typically focused on three primary manufacturing strategies:
 cost, quality, and flexibility (e.g., Garvin, 1993; Leong, Snyder, & Ward,
 1990; Schroeder, Anderson, & Cleveland, 1986; Skinner, 1969; Upton, 1995;
 Wheelwright, 1981). Each of these strategies, contingency theorists would
 argue, implies something different about the potential role of human re-
 sources in improving firm performance. Such a perspective suggests that the
 best HR system is contingent on the manufacturing strategy of a firm. A
 number of theoretical arguments support this position.

 According to the behavioral perspective (Jackson et al., 1989; Miles &
 Snow, 1984; Schuler & Jackson, 1987; Wright & McMahan, 1992), for example,
 organizational characteristics such as strategy require unique attitudes and
 role behaviors if performance is to be effective, and HR activities are the
 primary means used to elicit and reinforce the kinds of employee behaviors
 a firm requires. Similarly, control theory advocates (e.g., Snell, 1992) contend
 that effective performance depends on matching appropriate HR practices
 with the administrative context established by a given strategy. Snell and
 Youndt (1995) found that the effect of input control, behavior control, and
 output control on sales growth and return on assets (ROA) was contingent
 on the clarity of cause-effect relationships and standards of performance (cf.
 Ouchi, 1977, 1978; Thompson, 1967).

 Although the behavioral perspective and control theory tend to focus
 attention on managing a firm's current employees' behaviors in an effort to
 maximize performance, firms also focus on competency management through
 acquiring, developing, and utilizing employees with particular knowledge,
 skills, and abilities (Wright & Snell, 1991; Wright et al., 1995). More specifi-
 cally, Wright and his colleagues (1995) found that organizations exhibited
 higher performance when they recruited and acquired employees possessing
 competencies consistent with the organizations' current strategies. Reversing
 the causal arrow, they also found that organizations exhibited higher perfor-
 mance when they sought out a strategy that matched their current employees'
 competencies (cf. Snow & Snell, 1993). This work provides empirical support
 for the general assumption that a tighter fit between human resource compe-
 tencies and strategy leads to superior performance (Baird & Meshoulam,
 1988; Miles & Snow, 1984, 1994).

 Although these arguments lend credence to the contingency perspective

 in general, they do not speak directly to the context of manufacturing strategy
 and performance in particular. Thus, in the following sections we discuss
 the specific theoretical links we anticipated among manufacturing strategy,
 HR systems, and operational performance.

 Cost strategies. Organizations can create customer value by either reduc-
 ing costs or increasing benefits in the production equation (i.e., value =
 benefits/costs). Since people are one of the most costly and uncontrollable
 resources affecting this equation, the conventional wisdom in manufacturing
 had been to control costs by diminishing the amount of human capital needed
 in the production process by substituting mechanized systems for labor.
 Such technological advances not only have the potential to reduce costs
 through the elimination of people, but can also suppress the wage levels of
 remaining employees if the new production systems require lower skill levels
 and decision-making capabilities (Majchrzak, 1988). In many cases, pro-
 grammed production systems and highly structured jobs have become de
 facto methods for deskilling manufacturing workers and reducing their dis-
 cretion (Helfgott, 1988: 67).

 In contexts in which production systems are purposely designed to
 minimize the impact of individual differences, the most consistent approach
 to HR would be one based on notions of command and control, where empha-
 sis is placed on efficiently managing a low-skilled, manual workforce. In
 such settings, the use of elaborate staffing systems, such as comprehensive
 employment testing, which seeks to find the best qualified candidates, would
 have a negligible impact on performance (Hofstede, 1978). Furthermore, as
 work is routinized to the point at which labor is essentially a commodity,
 the added expense of elaborate training systems would rarely be justified
 since their utility tends to be diminished (Cascio, 1991). Therefore, training
 efforts would only need to focus on general information, such as company
 policies and procedures, or be used as a remedial activity aimed at correcting
 skill deficiencies, not as a method for driving superior performance.

 Performance appraisal would also need to concentrate on areas such as
 error reduction and process standardization in order to reduce costs and
 improve efficiency (Majchrzak, 1988). Research suggests that results-based
 appraisal methods would likely be most appropriate for these purposes (cf.
 Ouchi, 1977; Snell & Youndt, 1995). However, a developmental approach to
 appraisal focused on strengthening employee skills and capabilities would
 likely have minimal utility (as noted, employees are accorded little discre-
 tion). At the extreme, appraisal systems would exist merely as perfunctory
 methods for detecting and correcting errors. As for pay systems, most manu-
 facturers have relied on hourly pay for their lower-level workers in order to
 maintain control over labor costs (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). If incentive
 compensation were to be used in conjunction with a cost strategy, we would
 expect it to focus on individual performance since contributions can easily be
 measured and attributed to specific individuals in standardized production
 settings (Gerhart & Milkovich, 1993; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). In short,
 administrative HR systems (i.e., selection for manual skills, policies and
 procedures training, results-based performance appraisal, hourly pay, and
 individual incentives) are consistent with the requirements of a cost strategy
 focused on standardizing processes, reducing errors, and maximizing produc-
 tion efficiency.

 Quality strategies. In contrast to traditional cost strategies that can en-
 courage deskilling are quality strategies that focus on continually improving
 manufacturing processes to increase product reliability and customer satis-
 faction (Fine & Hax, 1985; Garvin, 1993). In such strategic contexts, the
 ultimate determinant of organizational competitiveness may be the intellec-
 tual capital of firms. As Walton and Susman noted, "In plant after plant we
 see . . . output is more sensitive to variations in human skills, knowledge,
 and attitudes and to mental effort rather than physical effort" (1987: 99).
 More specifically, employees in such environments are required to make the
 transition from touch labor, where their responsibilities are limited to only
 the physical execution of work, to knowledge work, where their responsibili-
 ties expand to include a richer array of activities such as planning, trouble-
 shooting, problem solving, quality assurance, scheduling, maintenance, and
 so forth (Ayers & Miller, 1986; Helfgott, 1988; Hirschhorn, 1984; Kern &
 Schumann, 1990; Shaiken, 1984; Snell & Dean, 1994; Wilkinson, 1983; Zu-
 boff, 1988).

 Indeed, most total quality management theorists (e.g., Crosby, 1979;

 Deming, 1982, 1986) have argued that skill acquisition and development lie
 at the heart of a successful quality strategy. More specifically, the technical
 and problem-solving skills of employees tend to be more important in total
 quality environments (Hayes, Wheelwright, & Clark, 1988) because employ-
 ees must understand statistical process control (SPC) as well as be able to
 work in teams to diagnose and solve problems. Reflecting this relationship,
 selective staffing and comprehensive training programs that emphasize
 attracting and developing individuals with superior technical, problem-

 solving, and interpersonal skills should be instrumental for increasing pro-
 ductivity and ensuring conformance to customer requirements.

 Though many quality theorists have scorned the use of performance
 appraisal (cf. Deming, 1986), this disdain has been premised on managers'
 focus on the results and administrative aspects of evaluation to the exclusion
 of employee behavioral and developmental issues. More recently, observers
 such as Blackburn and Rosen (1993) and Ghorpade and Chen (1995) have
 noted that, in addition to skill development, performance appraisal plays a
 crucial developmental role in quality-focused organizations. The concept of
 continuous improvement that underlies most quality initiatives, for example,
 suggests that diagnosis and employee feedback are required for eliminating
 defects, increasing product reliability, and conforming to product specifica-
 tions.

 Given the team-based, problem-solving nature of total quality manage-
 ment programs, firms adopting a quality strategy must facilitate employee
 interaction and information exchange. Researchers (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin,
 1992; Pearce, 1987) have contended that group-based performance incentives
 promote these behaviors in production environments characterized by a
 high degree of interdependence, where no clear identification of individual
 contributions can be made. Similarly, a shift from hourly to salaried compen-
 sation tends to promote egalitarianism, which facilitates group information
 sharing and problem solving (cf. Arthur, 1992; Pfeffer, 1994). In summary,
 human-capital-enhancing HR systems-those with such features as selective
 staffing, selection for technical and problem-solving skills, comprehensive
 training, training for technical and problem-solving skills, developmental
 and behavior-based performance appraisal, group incentives, and salaried
 compensation-that focus on skill acquisition and development are consis-
 tent with the performance requirements underlying a quality strategy.

 Flexibility strategies. As more and more manufacturers are achieving
 low-cost and high-quality market positions, firms are seeking alternative
 sources of competitive advantage. Increasingly, manufacturers concentrate
 on flexibility as a way to outdistance their competition (Upton, 1995). In
 general terms, flexibility refers to a firm's agility, adaptability, and responsive-
 ness. However, flexibility remains a very elusive concept and conjures up
 many different meanings among manufacturers (Dean & Snell, 1995; Upton,
 1995). For example, some firms view flexibility as the ability to scale produc-
 tion up and down quickly in an effort to increase delivery performance, and
 other firms see flexibility as the ability to quickly expand the scope of their
 product offerings by producing small lots and accommodating nonstandard
 orders (DeMeyer, Nakane, Miller, & Ferdows, 1989; Leong et al., 1990).

 In the past, many advocates of a flexibility strategy argued that agility

 and responsiveness could be achieved through sophisticated technologies
 such as computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM). However, current research
 findings have shown that manufacturing flexibility depends much more on
 people than on technical factors per se. As Upton noted,

 845

 Although high levels of computer integration can provide criti-
 cally needed advantages in quality and cost competitiveness,
 all the data in my study point to one conclusion: Operational
 flexibility is determined primarily by a plant's operators and the
 extent to which managers cultivate, measure, and communicate
 with them. Equipment and computer integration are secondary
 (1995: 75).

 Consequently, if firms want to successfully pursue a flexibility strategy, they
 must develop and maintain a highly skilled, technologically competent, and
 adaptable workforce that can deal with nonroutine and exceptional circum-
 stances requiring creativity and initiative (Adler, 1988; Hayes et al., 1988;
 Upton, 1995).

 The above reasoning suggests that flexibility strategies would likely
 be complemented by comprehensive staffing systems aimed at acquiring
 talented employees who possess high levels of both problem-solving and
 technical skills that allow them to understand an entire production process,
 thereby facilitating quick production line and product changes (cf. Parthasar-
 thy & Sethi, 1992). Similarly, comprehensive training programs focusing on
 both problem-solving and technical skills would be advantageous in such
 environments.

 Continuous employee feedback and developmental performance ap-
 praisal would likely be of great value to manufacturers pursuing flexibility
 strategies because unpredictable environments require mutual adjustment for
 coordination (March & Simon, 1958; Thompson, 1967). Flexibility strategies
 would also likely benefit from compensation systems that support a multi-
 skilled and adaptable workforce. According to Gomez-Mejia and Balkin
 (1992), skill-based pay tends to work best in circumstances requiring adapt-
 ability, where technology and organizational structure experience frequent
 changes, and where employee exchanges are common. Thus, skill-based pay
 should be particularly beneficial to firms seeking to increase their flexibility
 by frequently scaling up and down production processes, quickly adapting
 to changes in product mix, routinely handling nonstandard orders, and the
 like. Additionally, since flexible production environments are characterized
 by a high degree of employee interdependence and require group problem
 solving, group-based performance incentives are likely to be appropriate. In
 short, much like quality strategies, flexibility manufacturing strategies require
 human-capital-enhancing HR systems that focus on skill acquisition and
 development in an effort to facilitate adaptability and responsiveness.

 The above arguments show that although firms can pursue a multitude

 of manufacturing strategies, both independently and in concert, each of their
 strategic orientations implies a somewhat different approach to HR (Jackson
 et al., 1989). Cost manufacturing strategies tend to focus on internal effective-
 ness, thereby reducing the impact of human capital on performance. Accord-
 ingly, administrative approaches to HR that focus on standardized policies
 and procedures would likely be most appropriate. On the other hand, quality
 and flexibility manufacturing strategies tend to require the upskilling of

 employees, thereby necessitating a human-capital-enhancing approach to
 HR that focuses on skill acquisition and development. Table 2 summarizes
 the distinctions between administrative HR systems and those designed to
 enhance the level of human capital within firms. Taken as a whole, the
 contingency perspective suggests the relationship between various HR sys-
 tems and performance depends upon the type of manufacturing strategy
 being pursued. More specifically,

 Hypothesis 2: Manufacturing strategy moderates the rela-
 tionship between human resource systems and operational
 performance.
 Hypothesis 2a: A cost manufacturing strategy will posi-
 tively moderate the relationship between an administra-
 tive human resource system and operational perfor-
 mance.

 Hypothesis 2b: A quality manufacturing strategy will posi-
 tively moderate the relationship between a human-capital-
 enhancing human resource system and operational perfor-
 mance.

 Hypothesis 2c: A flexibility manufacturing strategy will
 positively moderate the relationship between a human-
 capital-enhancing human resource system and opera-
 tional performance.

 In summary, we do not view the universal and contingency perspectives

 as necessarily competing, and our hypotheses are not set up to convey a
 critical test between the two. Rather, a universal approach implies a main
 effect between HR systems and performance, whereas a contingency perspec-
 tive implies a set of interaction effects between HR systems and manufactur-

 ing strategy as they relate to performance. Of course, both of these conditions
 can exist simultaneously. In such a situation a main effect is no longer a
 general effect, but rather a conditional effect that depends on the specific
 form of the interactions (Aiken & West, 1991; Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990).
 We explore both the analytical and interpretational implications of this prop-
 osition in the sections below.

 Data and Procedures

 METHODS

 A potential pool of 512 manufacturing plants was drawn from several
 segments of the metal-working industry: primary metals (Standard Industrial
 Classification [SIC] 33), fabricated metal products (SIC 34), industrial and
 metal-working machinery (SIC 35), transportation equipment (SIC 36), and
 precision instruments (SIC 37). We identified plants within these industries
 using the Harris Pennsylvania Industrial Directory. Plants, rather than entire
 firms, were the units of analysis because manufacturers frequently have
 several different production facilities that can be managed in very differ-
 ent ways.

 General managers. The initial contacts for this study were the general

 managers of the plants or business units at each site. In the context of a
 larger research project, we mailed each general manager a cover letter and
 questionnaire measuring HRM activities and plant performance. After three
 weeks, a prompting letter and a second questionnaire identical to the first
 were mailed to all general managers who had not yet responded. A final
 total of 160 (31 percent) of the general managers participated in the study.

 Functional managers. Each general manager was also asked to provide
 the names of managers in each of four functions: operations, quality, produc-
 tion, and human resources. Of the 160 participating general managers, 123
 provided the names of functional managers. We asked each functional man-
 ager about the process and content of the selection, training, performance
 appraisal, and rewards systems used in their organizations. After three weeks,
 a second letter and questionnaire were mailed to nonresponsive managers.
 In total, 102 (82 percent) of the operations managers, 109 (89 percent) of the
 quality, 97 (79 percent) of the production control, and 90 (73 percent) of the
 HR managers participated.

 Approximately one and a half years after the initial surveys were com-
 pleted, we mailed a second wave of questionnaires to all managers who
 had responded to the first wave. The questionnaires in this wave measured
 manufacturing strategy and performance and were identical for all managers.
 A case was considered valid if we had at least two informants per site for
 each variable. Using this criteria, our final sample size was 97. A comparison
 of plants in our final sample with a random sample of nonparticipating
 plants showed no significant differences in size, unionization, and industry
 membership (see descriptions of these measures below).

 Measures

 Because we had multiple respondents for each variable, mean values

 across respondents were used in all cases for subsequent analysis. To make
 certain that data could be aggregated to the plant level, we calculated inter-
 rater agreement (IRA) according to the methods prescribed by James, De-
 maree, and Wolf (1984, 1993). (For further discussions of rwg as a measure
 of interrater agreement, see Kozlowski and Hattrup [1992] and Schmidt and
 Hunter [1989]).

 Operational performance. Operational performance was measured in

 both waves of questionnaires and assessed each firm's current performance
 relative to other firms in its industry in terms of product quality, employee
 morale, on-time delivery, inventory management, employee productivity,
 equipment utilization, production lead time, and scrap minimization. For
 the purposes of this study, we chose to use self-report performance measures
 for several reasons. First, since our study focused on plants, many of which
 were cost centers as opposed to profit centers, objective financial performance
 measures were unavailable for our entire sample. Second, because of the
 cross-industry nature of our sample, standardized measures of these dimen-
 sions were unavailable for comparisons. Accordingly, we followed Beard
 and Dess (1981) and asked managers to assess their own plant's performance
 relative to that of rivals within their industry.

 Recognizing the potential problems with self-report measures, we took

 several steps to ensure the reliability and validity of the indexes used in
 this study. In accordance with past research, we averaged the performance
 measures for the two time periods (t, t + 1.5 years) to help guard against
 random fluctuations and anomalies in the data. In addition, to minimize
 other effects from random error, we used multiple items and multiple respon-
 dents to assess performance. Although any single item or observation con-
 tains true variance as well as systematic and random error, averaging across
 alternative measures reduces the random error component.

 Beyond issues of reliability (such as random error), systematic error that

 might detract from the validity of our performance measures was also a
 concern. To ensure content validity, we used a representative sample of
 items from the entire construct domain of operational performance: product
 quality, employee morale, on-time delivery, inventory management, em-
 ployee productivity, equipment utilization, production lead time, and scrap
 minimization. As in other research focused on the performance construct,
 these measures include both indicators of efficiency and effectiveness (cf.
 Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). To assess the convergence and divergence
 among these items (i.e., construct validity), we used principal components
 factor analysis with varimax rotation to determine the underlying dimen-
 sionality of our performance measures. A two-stage rule was used to catego-
 rize items into factors (cf. Nunnally, 1978). First, to make certain that a given
 item represented the construct underlying each factor, we used a factor
 weight of .40 as the minimum cutoff. Second, to avoid problems of cross-

 loadings, we required that each item be clearly defined by only one factor.
 Operationally, if the difference between weights for any given item was less
 than .10 across factors, we deleted the item from the final scale. Each of the
 performance items met these criteria. The final factor structure revealed three
 stable factors representing machine efficiency (e.g., equipment utilization,
 scrap minimization), customer alignment (e.g., product quality, on-time de-
 livery), and employee productivity (e.g., employee morale, employee produc-
 tivity). Each factor's eigenvalue and Cronbach alpha exceeded 1.00 and
 .60, respectively.

 Human resource management practices. The HR practices used in this
 study focused on the four most commonly recognized areas of HRM: staffing,
 training, performance appraisal, and compensation. Staffing practices in-
 cluded four different scales used to measure (1) selectivity in hiring,
 (2) selection for manual and physical skills, (3) selection for technical skills,
 and (4) selection for problem-solving skills. Training practices also included
 four different scales used to measure (1) comprehensiveness, (2) policies and
 procedural training, (3) training for technical skills, and (4) training for
 problem-solving skills. Performance appraisal practices included three dif-
 ferent scales used to measure (1) developmental focus, (2) results-based ap-
 praisal, and (3) behavior-based appraisal. Compensation systems included
 (1) hourly pay, (2) salary, (3) skill-based pay, (4) individual incentives,
 (5) group incentives, (6) individual equity, and (7) external equity.

 To empirically validate our multi-item scales, we performed confirma-

 tory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction (Joreskog & Lawley,
 1968). Separate factor analyses were performed for each HR area (i.e., staffing,
 training, performance appraisal, and compensation) in order to maintain
 appropriate sample-size-to-factor ratios (Nunnally, 1978). Following the pro-
 cedures recommended by Gorsuch (1983), we used a series of chi-square
 tests to confirm the a priori factor structure of our measures (staffing, X2 =
 370.78, p < .01; training, X2 = 415.97, p < .01; appraisal, X2 = 451.02, p <
 .01; compensation, X2 = 267.83, p < .01). This analysis as well as scree tests
 (Cattell, 1966) of eigenvalues plotted against factors confirmed our proposed
 factor structure. Each factor's eigenvalue and Cronbach alpha exceeded 1.00
 and .70, respectively.

 Next, we followed the procedures used by MacDuffie (1995), Osterman

 (1994), and Arthur (1992, 1994) to combine the HR practices into two aggre-
 gate indexes reflecting (1) the administrative HR system and (2) the human-
 capital-enhancing HR system. Such an additive approach to combining HR
 practices into an index suggests that firms can improve performance either
 by increasing the number of practices they employ within the system or by
 using the practices in an HR system in a more comprehensive and widespread
 manner. This approach is conceptually and empirically better than a multipli-
 cative approach to creating HR systems because it does not reduce the index
 value to zero if a single HR practice is absent from a system. Instead, the
 absence of a practice only weakens the net effect of the system (MacDuffie,
 1995; Osterman, 1994).

 Specifically, the index for the administrative HR system included the
 following scales: selection for manual and physical skills, policies and pro-
 cedures training, results-based performance appraisal, individual equity,
 individual incentives, and hourly pay. The index for the human-capital-
 enhancing HR system consisted of the following: selective staffing, selection
 for technical and problem-solving skills, comprehensive training, training
 for technical and problem-solving skills, developmental and behavior-based
 performance appraisal, external equity, group incentives, skill-based pay,
 and salaried compensation. As noted earlier, these groupings are based on
 normative theory derived from previous studies on the strategic management
 of human resources (e.g., Arthur, 1992, 1994; Huselid, 1995; MacDuffie, 1995;
 Pfeffer, 1994). Cronbach alphas for the administrative HR system and the
 human-capital-enhancing system were .61 and .68, respectively.

 Manufacturing strategy. Manufacturing strategy was measured by 31
 items that operationally defined potential competitive priorities in manufac-
 turing, including cost, quality, and flexibility. As there are minor differences
 in the sets of manufacturing strategies used by various authors, we used
 principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation to determine the
 underlying dimensionality of our manufacturing strategy measures. Again,
 a two-stage rule was used to assign items to factors (cf. Nunnally, 1978).

 This analysis produced four stable factors representing quality, delivery

 flexibility, scope flexibility, and cost, each of which had a eigenvalue above
 1.00 and a Cronbach alpha greater than .70. The first factor, quality, was
 comprised of virtually every quality-related item on our list (e.g., dependabil-
 ity, product performance). Two additional quality-related items, solving cus-
 tomer problems immediately and meeting customer expectations, loaded
 both on quality and a second factor and thus were not included in this scale.
 The second strategy dimension, delivery flexibility, involved releasing new
 products and making deliveries on time, scaling production up or down
 quickly, and generally being flexible. Interestingly, the high productivity
 item also loaded on this factor, perhaps indicating the cost advantages of
 doing things quickly (cf. Stalk & Hout, 1990). The third dimension, scope
 flexibility (Parthasarthy & Sethi, 1992), contained items related to adjusting
 product mix, handling nonstandard orders, and making products to order
 in small lots. The final dimension, cost, was made up of items dealing with
 low labor, material, and unit costs. This categorization of manufacturing
 strategies parallels those in the literature (e.g., Leong et al., 1990; Marucheck,
 Pannesi, & Anderson, 1990; Schroeder et al., 1986; Skinner, 1969; Upton,
 1995; Wheelwright, 1981). As flexibility is a somewhat vague and developing
 construct (Upton, 1995), it is not surprising that we found two distinct dimen-
 sions of flexibility.

 Organizational size. Since large organizations may be more likely than
 small ones to have well-developed HR practices, we controlled for any extra-
 neous effects of organizational size. Following Kimberly (1976), size was
 measured as the natural logarithmic transformation of the number of full-

 time employees, which was obtained from Standard & Poor's Directory of
 Corporate Affiliations.

 Industry environment. We included three additional variables in the
 study in order to eliminate their extraneous effects prior to examining our
 hypotheses. The first was munificence. Following Keats and Hitt (1988), we
 assessed growth in each industry by regressing the natural logarithm of sales
 against time. The antilog of the regression slope was used as an index of
 munificence. For dynamism, we used the antilog of the standard error term
 from each regression equation described above to assess the degree of change
 in industry sales. For complexity, the MINL formula (Schmalensee, 1977) of
 sales concentration was used as a surrogate for the H-index of complexity.
 Sources for this data were the Commerce Department's Survey of Manufac-
 tures and Moody's Industrials.

 Table 3 shows the means, standard deviations, interrater agreements,

 and correlation matrix for all variables.

 Hypothesis Testing

 To test our specific hypotheses, we used moderated hierarchical regres-

 sion analysis in order to isolate the main effects of the HR systems on perfor-
 mance and to independently assess how each manufacturing strategy moder-
 ated the relationship between HR and performance. Our overall procedure
 for each dependent performance variable (i.e., customer alignment, employee
 productivity, and equipment efficiency) was the same. In step 1, the three
 environmental variables (i.e., munificence, complexity, and dynamism) and
 firm size were added as a set. We added these variables first to control for
 any extraneous effects across industries and organizations. In step 2, the set
 of manufacturing strategies (i.e., cost, quality, delivery flexibility, and scope
 flexibility) were entered in order to control for any effects strategy might
 have on HR systems, operational performance, or their relationship. Signifi-
 cant effects here would indicate a direct relationship between manufacturing
 strategy and performance. In step 3, the two HR systems (i.e., administrative
 HR and human-capital-enhancing HR) were entered as a set to test the uni-
 versal approach to HR. A significant effect here between a human-capital-
 enhancing HR system and operational performance would provide support
 for Hypothesis 1. In addition, this procedure eliminated the main effects of
 HR systems prior to examining potential HR-strategy interaction effects (cf.
 Stone & Hollenbeck, 1989). Finally, in step 4, the cross products of each of
 the manufacturing strategies and the HR systems (e.g., cost by administrative
 HR, cost by human-capital-enhancing HR, quality by administrative HR,
 quality by human-capital-enhancing HR) were entered as a set. Entering the
 eight interaction terms simultaneously controlled for possible multicollinear-
 ity among the variables. Evidence of moderation exists when the set of inter-
 action terms accounts for significant residual variance in the dependent
 variable. Significant effects here would indicate that manufacturing strategy

 moderated the relationship between HR systems and performance, thereby
 providing support for Hypothesis 2. We used individual interaction terms
 (e.g., cost by administrative HR) to test our specific moderation hypotheses
 (2a, 2b, and 2c). Support for these hypotheses would exist if the individual
 interaction terms accounted for significant residual variance in operational
 performance. Tables 4-6 show the results of our moderated hierarchical
 regression analyses.

 Main effects/universal approach. With industry environment, firm size,
 and manufacturing strategy controlled, the HR systems as a set were signifi-
 cantly related to customer alignment (AR2 = .07, F = 4.60, p < .01) and
 employee productivity (AR2 = .14, F = 8.68, p < .01). Specifically, the
 human-capital-enhancing index had a significant main effect on employee
 productivity (b = 0.36, p < .01) and was marginally associated with customer
 alignment (b = 0.18, p < .10) and equipment efficiency (b = 0.20, p < .10).
 Overall, these findings provide preliminary support for Hypothesis 1 and
 suggest that, other things being equal, an HR system focused on enhancing
 human capital is a valuable approach for strengthening operational perfor-
 mance in manufacturing.

 Moderating effects/contingency approach. Beyond the direct relation-
 ships between human-capital-enhancing HR and performance, we also found
 support for the contingency approach to HR. As a set, the manufacturing
 strategy-HR interaction terms accounted for significant incremental variance
 in customer alignment (A R2 = .12, F = 2.20, p < .05). This result indicates
 that manufacturing strategy does in fact moderate the HR-performance rela-
 tionship, thereby providing support for Hypothesis 2, the basic moderation
 hypothesis. In testing the more specific moderation hypotheses, we found
 that a cost strategy interacts with an administrative HR system to predict
 equipment efficiency (b = 0.81, p < .05), thereby providing some support
 for Hypothesis 2a. Additionally, a quality strategy interacted with the human-
 capital-enhancing HR system to predict customer alignment (b = 2.70, p <
 .05), employee productivity (b = 2.42, p < .05), and equipment efficiency
 (b = 2.90, p < .05), thereby providing consistent support for Hypothesis 2b.
 Finally, delivery flexibility interacted with an administrative HR system to
 predict customer alignment (b = 1.41, p < .05). This result was counter to
 our anticipated results and therefore provides no support for Hypothesis
 2c. Overall, however, the moderation results provide strong evidence that
 manufacturing strategy influences the HR-performance relationship with a
 quality strategy interacting with human-capital-enhancing HR to predict per-
 formance and delivery flexibility and cost strategies interacting with adminis-
 trative HR to predict performance. In short, maximizing performance appears
 to depend on properly aligning HR systems with manufacturing strategy.

 As we stated earlier, main effects become conditional in the presence
 of significant interactions (Aiken & West, 1991; Jaccard et al., 1990). Accord-
 ingly, we went back and revisited the universal findings for human-capital-
 enhancing HR. Plotting the interactions of human-capital-enhancing HR and
 a quality strategy showed clearly that although human-capital-enhancing HR

 b The main effects in step 4 of our regression equations are simply the effect of human-

 interpretation problems since our interval scales do not include a zero value. Theoretically, it
 may be useful to think of a world in which manufacturing strategy equals zero but, as Tate
 (1984) and other have suggested, it only makes practical and statistical sense to examine condi-
 tional main effects over the range of one's data. Accordingly, we transformed our data and
 performed some exploratory analysis calculating human-capital-enhancing HR coefficients in
 the full regression model across the relevant range of strategy levels present in our sample. This
 analysis yielded all positive coefficients for human-capital-enhancing HR, thereby indicating
 that the conditional main effect of such HR practices on performance is positive across the
 applicable levels of manufacturing strategy in our sample.

 has a slight positive main effect, the results are primarily due to the large
 performance impact of linking human-capital-enhancing HR with a quality
 manufacturing strategy (see Figure 2). These findings imply that it is mislead-
 ing to suggest that human-capital-enhancing HR has a general main effect
 on performance.

 Additional Analyses

 In addition to the above hypothesis-testing procedures, two additional
 analyses were conducted to supplement our findings. First, recognizing that
 manufacturing strategies are used in combination rather than in isolation, we
 performed cluster analysis on the four manufacturing strategies orientations.
 This analysis yielded five clusters that we labeled (1) quality emphasis,
 (2) cost and quality emphasis, (3) cost, quality, delivery flexibility, and scope
 flexibility emphasis, (4) quality and delivery flexibility emphasis, and (5) no
 strategic emphasis. We repeated our regression analyses procedures substitut-
 ing these strategy clusters for the individual strategy variables. These regres-
 sions provided no evidence that the strategy clusters directly impacted manu-
 facturing performance or interacted with HR practices to predict
 performance.

 Second, we wanted to assess the extent to which particular HR systems

 and manufacturing strategies were actually used in conjunction with one
 another across the entire sample of participating firms. Accordingly, we
 regressed each HR system on the four manufacturing strategies, again control-
 ling for industry environment and firm size. The strategies as a set were
 predicitive of the human-capital-enhancing HR system (AR2 = .11, F = 2.97,
 p < .05), with the quality strategy (b = 0.39, p < .05) being positively
 associated with the human-capital-enhancing HR system. However, the man-
 ufacturing strategies as a set were not predictive of the administrative HR
 system (AR2 = .02, F = 0.56, n.s.). These results suggested that, with the
 exception of those employing a quality strategy, firms were not making a
 consistent connection between the manufacturing strategies they pursued
 and the HR systems they employed. This finding is somewhat surprising

 given the strong relationships among HR, manufacturing strategy, and perfor-
 mance.

 Overview and Implications of Findings

 DISCUSSION

 The purpose of this study was to examine both the universal and contin-
 gency approaches to HR and performance in a manufacturing environment.
 At the outset, we stated that theoretically and empirically these two ap-
 proaches-in and of themselves-are not necessarily incompatible. It is
 possible to have both main effects supporting the universal perspective
 and contingency effects supporting the contingency perspective. This argu-
 ment not withstanding, our analysis shows that the apparent main effect of
 human-capital-enhancing HR on performance is predominately a function
 of the performance enhancements obtained when firms link human-capital-
 enhancing HR systems with a quality manufacturing strategy. Accordingly,
 it is not accurate to conclude from our study that there are strong universal
 or best practices approaches to human resource management. Instead, our
 findings provide much more support for the contingency perspective. In the
 next section, we discuss the specific contingency findings uncovered in the
 current study.

 Contingency approach to HR. Given the consistent interactions between
 a quality manufacturing strategy and the human-capital-enhancing HR sys-
 tem as they relate to customer alignment, employee productivity, and equip-
 ment efficiency, we would argue that systematic efforts to enhance the skill
 levels of employees are especially important to firms trying to compete
 on quality. Although this idea has been well articulated in the total qual-
 ity literature (e.g., Crosby, 1979; Deming, 1986), our results add clarity to
 the specific aspects of operational performance affected by human-capital-
 enhancing HR systems. It appears that in such production environments,
 human-capital-enhancing HR systems designed to develop talented and
 team-oriented workers improve employee productivity, machine efficiency,
 and customer satisfaction.

 These findings parallel anecdotal evidence from companies such as Mo-
 torola, Nucor Steel, and Southwest Airlines that have used selective staffing,
 comprehensive training, and other skill development efforts as centerpieces
 in their quests to improve performance through total quality management
 initiatives (cf. Pfeffer, 1994). Moreover, the results suggest HR practices de-
 signed to professionalize employees and create an egalitarian work environ-
 ment positively influence operational performance when matched with qual-
 ity manufacturing strategies. Such findings coincide with the arguments of
 scholars (e.g., Lawler, Mohrman, & Ledford, 1992; Majchrzak, 1988) who
 promote the use of salaried compensation and increased employee problem
 solving as a means to foster egalitarianism. They also lend credence to the
 employee skill development and professionalization efforts of quality-
 focused companies, such as Saturn and Chaparral Steel, which promote

 increased employee problem solving, incorporate group incentives into their
 reward systems, and use salaried compensation on their plant floors (Arm-
 strong, 1990; Dumaine, 1992).

 In addition to the quality strategy and human-capital-enhancing HR
 system link, our findings indicate that an administrative HR system interacts
 with a cost manufacturing strategy to enhance employee productivity and
 also works in conjunction with a delivery flexibility strategy to improve
 customer alignment. These findings suggest that administrative HR systems
 are still very appropriate in strategic contexts that emphasize reducing costs
 and eliminating uncontrollable behavior. Although we hypothesized that
 flexibility strategies would require upskilled employees, it may in fact be
 the case that a delivery flexibility strategy can be based on flexible machines
 rather than flexible jobs (cf. Jaikumar, 1986). Such an environment likely
 necessitates standardized and routine behaviors and is therefore very consis-
 tent with a cost strategy. As Klein pointed out, such an approach to manufac-
 turing "can turn workers into extensions of a system no less demanding
 than a busy assembly line" (1991: 61). In short, our findings suggest that
 administrative HR systems can be used in standarized production contexts
 to increase productivity and customer alignment.

 There was only one instance in our contingency analysis in which a
 manufacturing strategy-HR combination was associated with diminished
 performance. Specifically, a scope flexibility strategy interacted negatively
 with an administrative HR system to affect customer alignment. Unlike deliv-
 ery flexibility (which showed a positive interaction with the administrative
 HR system), scope flexibility involves adapting to changes in product mixes
 and handling difficult and nonstandard orders. From our findings, it appears
 that this strategy requires an HR system that allows for more employee
 discretion and requires high employee skill levels (Upton, 1995). Although
 only a minor trend in our results, this particular finding highlights the impor-
 tance of separating different aspects of a flexibility strategy. Scope and deliv-
 ery flexibility are different conceptually, and they seem to demand very
 different approaches to HR management.

 Descriptive analysis. Since our analyses revealed that combining HR
 and manufacturing strategy could either enhance or hinder performance, we
 wanted to determine-from a purely descriptive standpoint-whether the
 actual practices of all manufacturers reflected these findings. In practice, the
 only HR-manufacturing strategy link we found across the entire sample was
 between the human-capital-enhancing HR system and a quality strategy. This
 finding indicates that manufacturers are capitalizing on the opportunity to
 improve performance by combining human capital enhancement with a qual-
 ity strategy but are missing out on the benefits gained by linking administra-
 tive HR systems with manufacturing strategies emphasizing cost containment
 and delivery flexibility.

 Several explanations may account for these findings. On the one hand,

 both practitioners and academics have spent considerable time trying to
 understand how firms can successfully implement quality strategies and

 have overwhelmingly concluded that quality initiatives tend to fail unless
 they are combined with employee skill-building efforts (e.g., Blackburn &
 Rosen, 1993; Crosby, 1979; Deming, 1986). On the other hand, there still
 remains much debate about how to effectively manage people in production
 environments pursuing cost containment through the introduction of tech-
 nology. For example, some studies (e.g., Helfgott, 1988; Kern & Schumann,
 1990; Spenner, 1983) encourage the use of human-capital-enhancing HR
 systems that facilitate teamwork and upgrade the technical and problem-
 solving skills of employees, and others (e.g., Butera & Thurman, 1984; Ger-
 win & Tarondeau, 1982; Shaiken, 1984) suggest a more traditional administra-
 tive approach to HR. Anecdotal observations (e.g., Walton & Susman, 1987)
 seem to indicate that many of today's manufacturers are moving toward the
 former view. Our results, however, indicate that administrative HR systems
 focused on standardized procedures, results-based performance appraisal,
 individual incentives, and the like may still be very appropriate for manufac-
 turers pursuing cost containment.

 The lack of a connection between delivery flexibility and an administra-
 tive HR system is not particularly surprising. A good deal of ambiguity
 currently surrounds the general concept of flexibility in both the academic
 literature and manufacturing organizations. And although numerous studies
 (Gupta & Somers, 1992; Sethi & Sethi, 1990) have attempted to outline the
 differing dimensions of manufacturing flexibility, there still remains a high
 degree of uncertainty about how to manage people to promote flexibility
 (Upton, 1995). Furthermore, as this study indicates, it appears that different
 types of flexibility require different people management systems, making
 the task of connecting flexibility strategies and human resources all the
 more difficult.

 Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research

 The limitations of this study constrain our interpretation of the findings
 and point to several issues for future research. First, this study only examined
 cross-sectional differences among manufacturing firms. Gaining a clearer
 understanding of the relationships between HR systems, strategy, and perfor-
 mance will require longitudinal analysis. Though we examined these rela-
 tionships in terms of HR systems adapting to the strategic requirements of
 firms, the opposite is possible as well. Indeed, researchers have suggested
 that firms may wish to adapt their strategies to complement their human
 infrastructures (Snow & Snell, 1993; Wright et al., 1995). Likewise, though
 we have suggested that HR systems and their match with strategy lead to
 performance, it is reasonable to contend that HR has a lagged effect. That is,
 successful firms possess the slack resources required to invest in the best
 HR practices. Future research might look at HR, strategy, and performance
 over time to examine the sequential and reciprocal relationship among these
 aspects of organizations.

 Second, this study explicitly examined manufacturing strategy, a func-
 tional strategy, as opposed to business- or corporation-level strategy. There

 are many appropriate levels of analysis for this type of research, but we chose
 to focus on manufacturing strategy because of its more direct relationship to
 what managers and first-line employees do daily. We thus viewed manufac-
 turing strategy as most likely to reveal a relationship between HR systems
 and operational performance at the plant level. Nevertheless, future SHRM
 research should be directed at clarifying and mapping out the distinctive
 HR, strategy, and performance relationships at differing levels of analysis.
 Further, although manufacturing strategy has been discussed in the literature
 for years, it remains a somewhat elusive concept. Research is needed to more
 fully understand the specific dimensions of manufacturing strategy and how
 they work together.

 A related point is that although we used multiple respondents to ensure
 agreement about strategy within each plant, there still remains an issue of
 whether managers presented us with intended or realized strategies (Mintz-
 berg, 1978). We believe that managers in this study were realistic in their
 responses to our survey, but future research might corroborate our self-report
 measures with more objective indicators of strategic posture (cf. Glick, Huber,
 Miller, Doty, & Sutcliffe, 1990).

 Third, our study focused on operational performance as opposed to
 financial performance or some other index of firm effectiveness. This focus
 was a conscious decision; however, we recommend that future research
 distill the performance consequences of HR activities at differing organiza-
 tional levels. For example, Huselid's (1995) recent study of high performance
 work practices focuses on turnover and productivity as well as corporate
 financial performance. This is an excellent example of how HR systems
 establish a set of linked performance consequences within firms.

 Fourth, the notions of internal and external fit suggest that there may
 be synergistic effects among and between both HR practices and strategy. In
 this study, we used bundles, or systems, of HR practices that were, strictly
 speaking, combined in an additive rather than multiplicative manner. In the
 future, more detailed work is needed on internal fit to ascertain whether HR
 systems are collections of distinct HR practices or whether there is a latent
 construct that subsumes the individual practices. And although we examined
 the interactions between HR systems and strategy, additional research that
 identifies configurations of HR practices and strategies is needed to reveal
 the potential synergistic effects among and between both HR practices and
 strategy (e.g., Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993; Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993).

 Finally, this study only looked at the moderating effects of manufacturing

 strategy on the HR-performance relationship. It is quite possible that other
 organizational characteristics, such as structure and technology, affect this
 relationship as well. The value of contingency research is that it allows
 researchers to look deeper into the HR-performance relationship. Accord-
 ingly, future contingency studies using other organizational characteristics
 as moderators are needed in order to gain further insights into the HR-
 performance relationship.

 In today's manufacturing organizations, the performance management
 of human resources is receiving a good deal of emphasis. The intent of this
 study was to examine two alternative forms-universal and contingency-of
 the HR-performance relationship. Our findings show that HR systems can
 substantially influence performance when aligned with appropriate manufac-
 turing strategies, thereby supporting a contingency view of HR. Establishing
 such a link is only one step of the many needed to gain a deeper understanding
 of how firms can manage human capital to improve competitiveness. So
 rather than dismissing one perspective or another, we would argue that more
 research is needed on how the two approaches may or may not converge.
 Certainly as manufacturers search for ways to enhance their productive po-
 tential for the future, this type of information would provide them with a
 richer understanding of how they can develop and manage human capital.
