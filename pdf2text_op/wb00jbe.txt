Criminal Activity, and Firm 
Reputation: Is There a Link?

Robert J. Williams
J. Douglas Barrett

ABSTRACT.  This study examined the influence of
corporate  giving  programs  on  the  link  between
certain  categories  of  corporate  crime  and  corporate
reputation.  Specifically,  firms  that  violate  EPA  and
OSHA regulations should, to some extent, experience
a  decline  in  their  reputations,  while  firms  that  con-
tribute  to  charitable  causes  should  see  their  reputa-
tions enhanced. The results of this study support both
of these contentions. Further, the results suggest that
corporate  giving  significantly  moderates  the  link
between  the  number  of  EPA  and  OSHA  violations
committed by a firm and its reputation. Thus, while
a  firm’s  reputation  can  be  diminished  through  its
violation  of  various  government  regulations,  the
extent  of  the  decline  in  reputation  may  be  signifi-
cantly reduced through charitable giving.

In recent years, a large amount of evidence has
been presented supporting the positive influence
of a good corporate reputation (image) on firm
Fortune,
value  (Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990; 
March 6, 1995; Gregory, 1991; Marconi, 1991;
Smith,  1994).  A  favorable  reputation  can  com-
municate  to  customers  the  quality  of  a  firm’s
product mix, which provides the firm an oppor-
tunity to charge premium prices for its goods and
services  (Klein  and  Leffler,  1981;  Milgrom  and
Roberts, 1986). A good image provides a firm’s
sales  force  easier  access  to  customers  (Garbett,
1988).  The  added  self  assurance  enjoyed  by
employees  who  work  for  a  well  respected  firm
easily translates into heightened employee morale
and  productivity  (Garbett,  1988;  Gray,  1986;
Gregory, 1991).

A  favorable  image  attracts  investors,  since  a
good  corporate  image  generally  implies  relative
investment security (Gray, 1986; Gregory, 1991;
Marconi,  1996;  Milgrom  and  Roberts,  1986).
Reputation also affects the ways lending institu-
tions view the firm, which, in turn, may influ-
ence  a  firm’s  access  to  financial  capital  (Beatty
and Ritter, 1986; Garbett, 1988).

Factors that affect corporate reputation

Prior  studies  have  identified  several  factors  that
affect a firm’s reputation. Firm size, for example,
is  directly  related  to  reputation,  as  larger  firms
enjoy greater name recognition than smaller firms
(Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Garbett, 1988). A
firm’s prior performance has a major impact on
its image, as does the firm’s risk profile (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990; Marconi, 1996).

publicity shape the firm’s image (Bromley, 1993;
Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990;  Garbett,  1988;
Gregory,  1991;  Marconi,  1996).  For  example,
under  “average  conditions”,  i.e.,  average  finan-
cial conditions, average stock market conditions,
average advertising budget and activities, a typical
firm would enjoy a stock price resulting from its
advertising efforts which is 4% higher than if the
firm  spent  nothing  on  advertising  (Gregory,
1991).

Additional factors such as dividend policy, the
percentage of the firm’s stock held by institutions,
and firm strategy all serve to shape a firm’s image.
According to Brigham (1995, p. 475), “investors
prefer  to  have  the  firm  retain  and  reinvest
earnings rather than pay dividends if the rate of
return the firm can earn on reinvested earnings
exceeds  the  rate  investors,  on  average,  can
themselves obtain on other investments of com-
parable risk.” Dividend policy, therefore, reflects
the  firm’s  own  assessment  of  its  future  growth
prospects, with more favorable growth prospects
resulting in higher earnings retention and lower
dividend  yields  to  investors  (Brigham,  1995;
Sears  and  Trennepohl,  1993).  Further,  institu-
tional portfolio managers make their investment
decisions after carefully reviewing relevant infor-
mation  about  a  firm  and  its  potential  perfor-
mance.  Those  firms  which  pass  this  screening
process should be viewed more favorably. Thus,
the holding by institutions of a large percentage
of a firm’s stock reflects favorably upon the firm,
and  serves  to  enhance  its  reputation  (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990).

Two  additional  factors  that  impact  corporate
image,  and  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  are
the  extent  to  which  firms  support  charitable
causes  and  adhere  to  established  laws  and  regu-
lations. It seems reasonable to expect that firms
that are involved in beneficial societal activities,
and that behave in a legally responsible manner,
should 
favorably
enhanced.

Historically,  firms  have  supported  educational
programs, 
service
programs,  and  environmental  protection.  Some
giving has been non-cash in nature, such as the
free  distribution  of  medicines  and  drugs  by
pharmaceutical  firms  to  those  in  need,  and  the
donation  of  software  by  computer  firms  in
support of educational programs. Most corporate
giving, however, has been in the form of direct
cash  contributions  made  through  corporate
giving  programs  and  established  trusts  (Miller,
1996).  In  recent  years,  as  a  percentage  of  total
corporate  giving,  the  balance  between  cash
contributions  and  gifts-in-kind  has  been  about
83% cash and 17% gifts-in-kind (Miller, 1996).
While  corporate  giving  increased  during  the
1970s,  merger  mania  and  confusion  as  to  the
proper role of corporate philanthropy in society
surfaced in the 1980s and prompted a decline in
giving  during  this  period  (Chronicle  of  Higher
Education,  May  11,  1988).  Recently,  however,
corporate giving has been on the rise, with firms
contributing approximately $7.4 billion to char-
itable causes in 1995 (Miller, 1996).

The diversification of the U.S. consumer base
has  reduced  the  role  of  mass  marketing  in  the
U.S. To meet this challenge, many firms are now
targeting consumer segments through charitable
giving programs (Graham, 1995). Firms are now
responding to the insistence of customers to deal
only with firms that portray a good image, and
philanthropy  is  a  means  to  create  that  image
(Miller,  1996).  In  addition,  many  firms  are
managed  by  baby  boomers  who  adhere  to  the
notion  that  corporate  giving  is  an  important
responsibility of the firm (Miller, 1996).

Many  Americans  admire  charitable  programs
that aid the less fortunate. Corporate-sponsored
programs that serve to relieve poverty, ignorance,
and  hunger,  or  that  aid  in  protecting  the  envi-
ronment  generally  present  a  favorable  image  of
the 
(Graham,  1995).
Charitable giving in conjunction with an effec-
tive  public  relations  campaign  can  be  an
extremely  effective  means  to  enhance  a  firm’s
image, as well as a means to reduce its advertising

and promotional expenses (Graham, 1995; Miller,
1996).  This  current  focus  on  “strategic  philan-
thropy” or “cause-related marketing,” stresses the
need  for  charitable  giving  to  bolster  the  firm’s
bottom line, and an enhanced reputation should
translate into improved overall firm performance
(Garbett, 1988; Miller, 1996; Smith, 1994).

We  would  expect  giving  to  improve  a  firm’s
image  to  some  extent.  Is  the  level  of  improve-
ment  marginal,  or,  does  the  level  of  giving
significantly enhance firm reputation enough to
justify  the  expenditure  of  funds  to  charity?  In
order  to  properly  examine  this  question,  the
following hypothesis is offered.

H1:  Corporate  philanthropy  and  corporate

reputation are positively related.

In  recent  years,  corporate  illegal  activity  has
captured  public  attention  and  has  resulted  in
significant economic losses for both taxpayers and
stockholders  (Baucus  and  Baucus,  1997).  For
example, the recent failures of many large savings
and  loan  institutions  have  been  directly  attrib-
uted  to  illegal  acts  by  the  managers  of  these
institutions (Akerlof and Romer, 1993). In many
instances,  stockholder  wealth  has  significantly
eroded  as  several  Fortune 500  firms  have  been
identified  and  sanctioned  as  violators  of  laws
designed to prevent practices ranging from price
fixing to anti-trust activities (Baucus and Baucus,
1997; Daboub, Rasheed, Priem and Gray, 1995;
Davidson and Worrell, 1988).

While  corporate  wrongdoing  is  clearly  an
integral  component  of  the  modern  business
environment,  the  reasons  managers  commit
illegal acts is less clear. Theoretical models exam-
ining corporate wrongdoing tend to follow two
distinct  schools  of  thought.  The  first  is  social
learning theory, which proposes that individuals
(managers  in  this  case)  learn  behaviors  through
modeling  and  imitation  of  others  (Bandura,
1974, 1977). Behavioral norms present within an
organization  can  serve  to  promote  ethical
behavior and codes of acceptable conduct among
managers, or alternatively, can serve to promote
organizational  performance  at  all  costs  and  a
“bottom-line philosophy” (Bandura, 1974, 1977;
Sutherland, 1947; Yeager, 1986). Such an aggres-

sive  and  restrictive  emphasis  on  performance
often  results  in  a  de-emphasis  on  law  abiding
behavior and the emergence of illegal acts (Hill,
Kelley, Agle, Hitt and Hoskisson, 1992).

The  second  approach  explains  corporate
illegalities  in  more  rational,  utilitarian  terms
(Daboub et al., 1995). According to the econo-
mists’ perspective, the decision to commit illegal
acts  is  based  on  rational  calculations  of  the
expected  costs  and  benefits  of  the  acts  (Becker,
1964).  Following  this  approach,  committing
illegal  acts  will  be  attractive  up  to  the  point
where the penalty for committing the act is equal
to  the  net  social  cost  of  the  act  divided  by  the
probability  of  detection  (Becker,  1964;  Cohen,
1992;  Daboub  et  al.,  1995).  This  rational
approach  assumes  that  managers  have  sufficient
knowledge and information to make the neces-
sary  mental  calculations  about  the  expected
benefits and potential costs of their actions.

While  both  approaches  may  offer  partial
explanations for managerial misconduct, no com-
prehensive theory of corporate wrongdoing has
been  developed  (Baucus  and  Near,  1991).
Instead,  researchers  have  tended  to  examine
certain identifiable antecedent factors as catalysts
for  promoting  managerial  misconduct.  Several
factors such as firm size, firm performance, firm
strategy,  and  firm  structure  have  all  been  the
focus of study on corporate wrongdoing (Baucus
and  Near,  1991;  Clinard  and  Yeager,  1980;
Daboub et al., 1995; Hill et al., 1992; Simpson,
1986; Staw and Szwajkowski, 1975).

In any event, detected corporate wrongdoing
that  is  made  public  should  serve  to  diminish  a
firm’s  reputation  to  some  extent.  Although  the
extent of such damage to a firm’s good name is
unclear, given the public’s desire for more ethical
behavior  from  big  business,  the  following  is
offered.

H2:  Corporate  criminal  activity  and  corpo-

rate reputation are negatively related.

Finally, the simultaneous effects of both giving
and illegal activity on firm reputation should be
of interest to managers, especially those managers
whose  firms  have  been  recently  identified  as
violators of the law. Perhaps, giving might offset

the negative impact of illegal activity on reputa-
tion  to  some  extent.  It  is  the  strength  of  the
interactive patterns between these variables that
is  of  particular  interest,  and  the  following
hypothesis is offered.

H3:  The decline in reputation associated with
criminal  activity  is  reduced  for  those
firms more heavily involved in corporate
philanthropy.

Research design

Sample

The  initial  sample  included  all  firms  that  were
continuously  listed  on  the  Fortune 500  for  the
years  1991  through  1994  (196  firms).  Due  to
mergers  and  acquisitions,  the  majority  of  firms
listed  in  1991  no  longer  existed  as  separate
entities  in  1994.  After  further  review,  it  was
determined  that  insufficient  data  had  been
obtained  on  12  firms,  and  those  firms  were
dropped  from  the  sample.  The  resulting  sample
consisted  of  184  firms  for  which  adequate
information was available regarding firm reputa-
tion, illegal activity, and corporate giving. 

Measures

Reputation. A measure of each firm’s reputation
(REPSCORE)  is  the  dependent  variable  in  the
study. The 1995 Fortune Corporate Reputations
Survey was used to obtain firm reputation scores.
The 1995 reputation survey was selected since it
provides  the  firms’  reputation  scores  at  the  end
of  the  1991–1994  time  period.  The  survey  is
conducted  annually  during  the  last  quarter.  In
compiling  reputation  scores,  Fortune
solicits
opinions  from  more  than  10,000  senior  execu-
tives,  outside  directors,  and  financial  analysts
about  the  ten  largest  firms  in  their  own  indus-
tries.  Firms  were  rated  on  an  11  point  scale
(0 = poor, 10 = excellent) relative to their major
competitors  on  eight  categories  of  reputation.
These  eight  categories  included  quality  of
management,  quality  of  products  or  services,

investment  value, 

long-term 
innovativeness,
financial  soundness,  ability  to  attract  and  keep
talented  people,  community  and  environmental
responsibility,  and  use  of  corporate  assets.  An
overall reputation index was calculated for each
firm based upon scores received on each of these
categories.

Fombrun and Shanley (1990) factor analyzed
the correlations among the eight attributes, and
summarized  their  results  with  a  rank  order  of
variables  that  affect  reputation  and  reflect  the
eight  categories.  Among  the  variables  included
in  their  study  were  financial  performance,  risk,
size,  institutional  ownership,  dividend  yield,
media  exposure,  diversification  (strategy),  and
social  responsibility.  We  included  these  same
variables in the present study as the control and
independent  variables,  and  added  an  additional
independent  variable  for  criminal  activity  in
order  to  extend  the  prior  studies.  While  we
attempted  to  use  the  same  measures  as  used  by
Fombrun and Shanley, certain differences in our
data required us to use slightly different measures
for  some  of  the  measures,  e.g.,  we  measured
institutional  ownership  as  an  average  over  the
study period versus a measure on a specific date
(Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, p. 246).

The  presence  of  a  “halo”  effect  in  which
firms’  financial  performance  may  heavily  influ-
ence  the  firms’  reputation  scores  and  blur
distinctions  among  the  categories  of  reputation
was  considered 
(Brown  and  Perry,  1994;
Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990).  As  discussed  in  a
later section, a dual approach was taken to ensure
that  the  presence  of  a  halo  effect  would  not
unduly bias the findings of the present study.

Citations. The  involvement  of  each  firm  in
criminal activity was computed using a two step
process. First, the total number of citations levied
against  the  firm  for  violations  of  Occupational
Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  and
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  regu-
lations during the 1991–1994 time period were
added. The sum of the citations was then divided
by  the  firm’s  revenues  during  the  same  time
period.  The  resulting  variable  (CITATIONS)
served as an independent variable. Following Hill
et  al.  (1992),  both  OSHA  and  EPA  violations


Charitable Giving, Criminal Activity, and Corporate Reputation

345

were  utilized,  as  these  two  categories  of  viola-
tions  constitute  the  largest  two  sources  of
corporate  legal  violations.  The  data  on  cited
OSHA  and  EPA  violations  were  obtained  from
the  U.S.  Government  under  the  1974  Freedom
of  Information  Act.  It  was  determined  that  the
federal  government  had  levied  no  citations
against 16 of the sample firms, leaving 168 firms
with  citations  resulting  from  violations  of  EPA
and/or OSHA regulations.

Giving. Each firm’s level of philanthropy during
1991–1994 was obtained from the Corporate 500
Directory of Corporate Philanthropy and the National
Directory of Corporate Giving. Both cash gifts and
gifts  in-kind  (if  appropriate)  were  added  and
divided by the firm’s revenues during the period.
The  resulting  independent  variable  (GIVING)
reflects giving per dollar of sales. 

Control  variables.  We  relied  heavily  upon  the
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) study in identifying
several  control  variables  believed  to  have  an
impact  on  firm  reputation.  These  variables
include  firm  size,  strategy,  performance,  adver-
tising  efforts,  institutional  ownership,  dividend
yield,  and  the  firm’s  debt-to-equity  ratio.  Firm
size  (SIZE)  was  measured  as  the  logarithm  of
average firm sales during the 1991–1994 period.
Rumelt’s (1974) typology was used to classify
each  firm’s  strategy  (STRATEGY).  Rumelt
categorized the strategies of firms based upon the
proportion  of  the  firm’s  revenues  derived  from
its largest business activity or its largest group of
related  business  activities.  Specifically,  single
business firms are basically committed to a single
business  activity,  vertically  integrated  firms
produce and sell a variety of end products, related
diversified firms have diversified by adding new
businesses similar to the firm’s existing businesses,
and  unrelated  diversified  firms  have  added
businesses that are largely unrelated to the firm’s
current business activities (Rumelt, 1974). As the
level of diversification increases, interdependence
and synergy among the firm’s business units tends
to diminish. An examination of the sample firms
revealed  the  extent  to  which  the  four  types  of
corporate  strategies  were  being  utilized;  single
business (36 firms), vertical integration (32 firms),

related  diversification  (72  firms),  and  unrelated
diversification (44 firms). Since firm unit inter-
dependence  diminishes  as  the  level  of  diversifi-
cation  increases,  we  treated  STRATEGY  as  a
continuous  variable  ranging  from  “1”  (single
business) to “4” (unrelated diversification) in the
analysis.

firm  advertising 

Each  firm’s  average  return  on  equity  (ROE)
during  1991–1994  served  as  the  performance
measure,  and  the  firm’s  debt-to-equity  ratio
(DERATIO)  was  used  to  control  for  risk.
Average 
(ADVERT)  was
included  to  control  for  media  exposure.  Each
firm’s  average  dividend  yield  (YIELD)  and  the
average percentage of outstanding shares held by
institutional investors (INSTITUTE) during the
1991–1994  time  period  were  also  included  as
control  variables.  Data  on  all  variables  were
gathered  from  Moody’s  industrial  Manual,  Value
Line Investment Survey, and from the firms’ 10K
reports for the selected years.

Analytical procedures

It has been observed in prior studies (e.g., Brown
and  Perry,  1994;  Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990)
that  firms’  reputation  scores  are  heavily  influ-
enced by the firms’ financial performance. Brown
and Perry state that firms’ financial performance
may  blur  distinctions  among  dimensions  of
reputation due to a strong overall impression, or
“halo” effect (Brown and Perry, 1994, p. 1349).
Given the presence of a halo effect, we initially
utilized  the  two-stage  regression  technique
proposed  by  Brown  and  Perry  to  obtain  “halo-
free”  data.  We  found,  however,  that  the  two-
stage  regression  technique  generated  similar
results to those produced by simply including the
performance measure as a control variable in the
regression equation. Thus, we opted for the more
traditional  approach  of  adding  control  variables
for firm performance to our regression model.
To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, we utilized OLS
regression  with 
variable
(REPSCORE) regressed on the two independent
variables and the seven control variables. A forced
order  of  entry  technique  was  utilized,  with  the
control  variables  entered  first  in  the  equation.

the  dependent

The  entire  sample  (184  firms)  was  used  to  test
H1 and H2.

A  hierarchical,  moderated  regression  analysis
was used to test Hypothesis 3. In the base model,
the  dependent  variable  (REPSCORE)  was
regressed on the two independent variables and
the  seven  control  variables.  Next,  we  added  to
the base model the interaction of CITATIONS
with  GIVING.  Since  H3  examines  the  moder-
ating  influence  of  GIVING  on  the  illegal
activity-reputation  relationship,  we  decided  to
use the abbreviated sample (168 firms) containing
only  those  firms  cited  for  criminal  violations.
The increment in R2 resulting from the inclusion
of the interaction term in the regression equation
was  used  to  assess  the  significance  of  the  inter-
action.

Results

Table I presents the descriptive statistics. Results
of  the  regression  analysis  are  presented  in
Table II.

The average reputation score was 6.48, with a
range of 3.09 (low) to 8.39 (high). The average
number  of  citations  per  firm  during  the  time
period was 16, with a range of 0 (16 firms had
no citations) to 140 citations during the period.
The  firms  donated,  on  average,  approximately
$9.25  million  annually  in  support  of  various
charitable causes, with the least amount donated
being  $65,000,  and  the  highest  amount  given
being $118 million.

Table I revealed several significant correlations
between  selected  variables.  As  expected,  SIZE
was positively correlated with both REPSCORE
and  CITATIONS.  Also,  CITATIONS  was
negatively  correlated  with  REPSCORE,  while
GIVING  was  positively  correlated  with  the
dependent variable.

The significant negative correlation between
REPSCORE  and  INSTITUTE  was  an  unex-
pected  surprise,  as  was  the  negative  correlation
between  SIZE  and  INSTITUTE.  It  seems
counter  intuitive  that  institutional  investors
would  be  attracted  to  firms  with  lower  reputa-
tion  scores  and  to  smaller  firms.  By  using  both
influence diagnostics and visual inspection of the

plotted  data  points,  it  was  observed  that  a
“threshold”, or minimum level of reputation was
important for institutional investors. For example,
about  90%  of  the  sample  firms  had  REP-
SCORES of 6.00 or higher. It was observed that
a few observations (outliers) below this minimum
level  seemed  to  exert  a  strong  negative  bias  on
the  correlation  between  REPSCORE  and
INSTITUTE.  Similarly,  several  outliers  among
the mid-sized firms seemed to strongly influence
the correlation between SIZE and INSTITUTE
in an unexpectedly negative direction. Although
these  identified  outliers  strongly  influenced  the
correlations,  their  inclusion  in  the  regression
analysis  did  not  materially  alter  the  regression
results.

Procedures  outlined  by  Belsley,  Kuh  and
Welsch  (1980)  were  utilized  to  detect  the
presence of multicollinearity among the variables.
The  collinearity  diagnostics  demonstrated  that
the  degree  of  multicollinearity  present  did  not
pose  a  significant  problem  in  conducting  the
analysis.

In model 1 (Table II), the results of the OLS
regression analysis for H1 and H2 are presented.
Hypothesis  1  states  that  corporate  giving  and
reputation 
related,  while
Hypothesis  2  predicts  a  negative  relationship
between corporate illegal activity and reputation.
Although relatively weak, as predicted, the results
indicate  a  positive  and  statistically  significant
(p < 0.10) relationship between firm giving and
reputation, and offer support for H1. The results
also support H2, with a negative and significant
(p < 0.01) relationship indicated between illegal
activity and reputation.

According to H3, the decline in firm reputa-
tion  attributed  to  criminal  activity  will  be
lessened  for  those  firms  more  heavily  involved
in  charitable  giving  programs.  We  ran  the  base
model (model 2) using only those firms (n = 168)
that had been cited for criminal violations. The
· CITATIONS
interaction  term  for  GIVING 
was  added  (model  3),  and  the  results  indicate  a
strong,  statistically  significant  (p <  0.001)  and
positive  parameter  estimate  for  the  interaction
term. The incremental change in R2 of 0.12 was
statistically significant, thus, offering support for
H3. The interaction term was plotted for visual

inspection and revealed that, as predicted, those
firms that give more to philanthropic causes do
experience  less  negative  image  fallout  from
criminal citations than those firms that give less
to charity.

Discussion

As  predicted,  the  results  support  significant
relationships  between  each  of  firm  giving  and
illegal  activity,  and  firm  reputation.  The  strong
negative  link  observed  between  illegal  activity
and  reputation  was  particularly  noteworthy.
Given  the  myriad  types  and  sheer  volume  of
existing  and  evolving  federal  and  state  regula-
tions,  the  inevitability  of  either  intentional  or
accidental  violations  seems  obvious.  As  these
violations occur, firm reputation will be dimin-
ished to some extent. Failure to control for such
misconduct in future studies may, as the present
study suggests, omit a very revealing component
of the reputation construct.

Of particular interest are the significant inter-
active patterns that were observed between giving
and citations and their link to reputation. If firms
do,  as  evidence  suggests,  place  a  great  deal  of
time and resources in promoting their images, the
findings  of  the  present  study  have  major  impli-
cations.  Given  the  results,  charitable  giving
appears  to  be  a  means  by  which  firms  may
partially restore their good names following the
commission of illegal acts. Caution is warranted
here,  however.  To  argue  that  firms  might  “buy
their way out of trouble” may be too bold. While
it was observed that firms’ reputations did suffer
when  publicly  sanctioned  for  legal  violations,
giving  was  not  observed  to  prompt  a  complete
restoration of the firms’ favorable image. Perhaps
giving  offers  a  firm  only  a  partial  remedy  for
regaining its good name.

From  an  economic  perspective,  corporate
giving  has  generally  been  justified  given  the
positive  publicity  it  generates  and  the  tax
deductibility  of  the  funds  given.  The  results  of
this study offer one additional economic incen-

tive  for  giving;  to  partially  compensate  for  the
negative publicity generated by either intention-
ally or unintentionally breaking the law.

Beyond  the  economic  issue  surrounding  the
corporate giving/criminal sanctions tradeoff lies
a  more  fundamental  question;  when,  if  ever,  is
it  morally  correct  for  a  firm  to  support  philan-
thropic causes in order to somehow compensate
for corporate wrongdoing? Shaw and Post (1993)
provide  an  excellent  answer  to  this  question
through their “litmus test” of the moral respon-
sibility of firms. They argue that firms need not
bear the moral responsibility to correct society’s
problems, unless those problems arise as a result
of  the  firm’s  actions.  General  societal  problems
should  be  addressed  by  other  democratic  insti-
tutions,  not  firms  who  may  lack  both  the
resources  and  the  expertise  to  solve  these
problems. Certainly, firms can help on a limited
basis to help alleviate poverty or to fight hunger
and illness, but these and other societal problems
are  seldom  caused  by  the  actions  of  firms.  In
those  situations  where  the  firm’s  actions  have
resulted  in,  say,  unsafe  working  conditions  or
environmental  pollution,  a  direct  causal  link
between  the  firm’s  actions  and  wrongdoing  has
been  demonstrated.  The  firm  has  passed  the
litmus  test  of  moral  responsibility,  and  firm
resources  should  be  allocated  to  correct  these
conditions  and  compensate  society  for  these
actions  (Shaw  and  Post,  1993).  In  such  cases,
some reasonable level of corporate philanthropy
seems justified.

In  this  study  we  have  observed  corporate
wrongdoing and how charitable giving seems to
reduce the negative effect of wrongdoing on firm
reputation.  Obviously,  we  were  not  able  to
examine the premeditation of firms in commit-
ting  these  illegal  acts.  We  are  certain  that  the
managers  of  some  firms  do  conduct  a  type  of
cost/benefit  analysis  between  charitable  giving
versus  the  economic  benefits  that  may  accrue
through  illegal  activity.  We  embrace  the  notion
of  a  litmus  test  in  order  to  justify  corporate
giving.  Nevertheless,  we  feel  that  to  premedi-
tate  criminal  activity  with  the  notion  of
somehow  buying  your  way  out  of  trouble
through charitable giving, if caught, can only be
viewed as morally bankrupt.

As  with  any  research,  the  present  study  has
certain limitations. In using the total number of
citations  as  the  gauge  of  illegal  activity,  differ-
ences in the magnitude and severity of illegal acts
were  not  considered.  This  facet  of  the  study
should  be  viewed  as  a  limitation.  Obviously,
minor violations of the law might be committed
more  often  than  major  violations,  resulting  in
varying  degrees  of  damage  to  reputation.  With
respect to giving, which types of giving tend to
better  enhance 
image?  For  example,
supporting a college scholarship program might
enhance reputation more than giving to support
more  controversial  programs, 
the
National  Endowment  for  the  Arts.  A  detailed
breakdown  as  to  where  firms  allocated  their
donations  was  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present
study.  Additional  research  along  these  lines,
however, is encouraged in future studies.
