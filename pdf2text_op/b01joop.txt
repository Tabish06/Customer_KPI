Short  research  paper

Testing  the  discriminant  validity  of

occupational  entrenchment

Gary  Blau*

Temple  University,  Philadelphia,  USA

Using  a  sample  of  medical  technologists  (MTs)  over  a  5-year  time  period,  this
study's  results  suggest  that  occupational  entrenchment  (Carson,  Carson,  &
Medeian,  1995)  may  be  better  represented  as  a  two-dimension,  i.e.  accumulated
costs  and  limited  alternatives,  vs.  three-dimension,  i.e.  investments,  emotional
costs, and  limited  alternatives, construct.  Results  show  that  professional  commit-
ment,  job  satisfaction,  job  involvement,  and  organizational  support  were  more
strongly  positively  related  to  accumulated  costs  than  limited  alternatives,  while
externality  (locus  of  control)  and  lower work  ethic were more  strongly  related  to
limited  alternatives  than  accumulated  costs.  It  is  speculated  that  these  results
may  be  useful  in  future  research  on  the  broader  construct  of  occupational
commitment.

According to Carson etal. (1995, p. 303) there are three dimensions  of  occupational
entrenchment—occupational  investments  (accumulated  investments  such  as  time  and
money  that  would  be  lost  if  one  pursued  a  new  occupation);  emotional  costs
(anticipated  emotional  costs  with  pursuing  a  new  occupation),  and  limitedness  of
occupational  altematives  (perceived  lack  of  available  options  for  pursuing  a  new
occupation). Employees  can be higher or lower on each of  these  three  dimensions,
with  their  sum  representing  overall  occupational  entrenchment.  In  their  develop-
mental  scale  study  of  occupational  entrenchment  (Carson  et  al.,  1995),  both
exploratory  and  confirmatory  factor  analyses,  across  different  samples,  supported
these  three dimensions. Twelve items loaded  cleanly across  these  dimensions  (four
items/dimension).

Further reflection  on the conceptual definitions  of occupational investments  and
emotional  costs  (Carson  et al., 1995)  suggests  that  both  dimensions  can  represent
types  of  'investments'  for  an  employee.  Correlational  evidence  for  demonstrating
the discriminant validity between investments vs. emodonal costs appear to be very
weak  (Carson  et  al.,  1995).  Even  where  there  is  a  significant  difference  in
correlations, e.g. r of investments with career identity is .17 vs. r of emotional  costs
with  career identity is .50, this is tempered  by career identity being  operationalized

using 'emotion  based' items  (Carson  & Bedeian,  1994). Investment  model  research
by  Farrell  and  Rusbult  (1981)  and  Rusbult  and  Farrell  (1983)  has  defined  an
investment  as resources  (e.g. personal  identity, retirement  programme,  status)  that
are  'put  into' some type of  commitment,  such  as one's  job. Both  'time  and  money'
and  'emotions' would  qualify  as  resources  put  into  one's  occupation.

Carson  et al  (1995)  stated  that  the  most  visible  emotional  cost  involved  in
changing  occupations  is  disrupted  interpersonal  relationships,  with  greater  costs,
such  as lost  social recognition  (status), for  more  professionally  trained  employees.
This  argument  seems  to  confound  partially  emotional  costs  with  occupational
investments.  In  their  confirmatory  factor  analyses,  Carson  et al. (1995)  presented
evidence  that  a  three-dimension  model  provided  a  better  fit  to  their  data,  vs.
two-dimension  and  one-dimension  models.  However,  their  two-dimension  model
was  based  on  distinguishing  negatively  vs.  positively  worded  items  across  the
investments,  emotional  costs  and  Hmited  alternatives  dimensions.  Carson  et al.
(1995)  did  not test  for  a two-dimension  model  of  occupational  entrenchment,  with
one  dimension  being  limited  alternatives  and  the  second  dimension  combining
emotional  costs and investments  items into  a larger  'accumulated  costs' dimension.
Carson,  Carson,  Phillips,  and  Roe  (1996)  and  in  particular,  Carson  and  Carson
(1997),  have  discussed  the  process  of  an  individual  becomng  occupationally
entrenched.  During 
to  psychological
(emotional)  costs, which  then  lead  to  limited  perceived  occupational  alternatives.
The  continual  process  of investing  and  re-investing  (e.g. by additional  training)  in
one's  occupation  can  increase  one's  need  for  psychological  (emotional)  preser-
vation, i.e.  one  has  made  the  correct  choice. This  focus  can  divert  an  individual's
energy  from  scanning  their  environment  for  occupational  alternatives.  Ignoring
external stimuli can create a 'tunnel vision' (Carson & Carson, 1997) for individuals,
which  over  time,  objectively  diminishes  viable  alternatives  (Brockner,  1992).
Occupational  change  is  less  difficult  when  individuals  perceive  occupational
alternatives  (Rhodes  & Doering,  1983).

lead 

Initial  job  and  organizadon  experiences  can  play  an  important  role  in  affirming
that employees have made the 'right' occupational decision  (Greenhaus  & Callanan,
1994).  Thus,  work  attitudes  and  perceptions  such  as  job  involvement,  job
satisfaction,  organizational  support  and  professional  commitment  would  seem  to
be more  significant  positive antecedents  of accumulated  costs, i.e. investments  and
emotional costs, vs. limited alternatives. If employees like their job, feel  committed
to  their  job  and  occupation,  and  feel  supported  by their  organization,  they  should
perceive  greater  'costs'  for  changing  occupations  (Carson  et al., 1996).

However,  the greater  perceptual  'finality'  (Carson  & Carson,  1997; Carson  et al.,
1996)  of  few  perceived  occupational  alternatives  suggests  that  the  above  more
'situational'  work  attitude  antecedents  could  have  less  impact  on  this  perception.
Instead,  more  dispositional  antecedents  such  as  internal-external  locus  of  control
and  work  ethic  might  be  expected  to  affect  more  strongly  limited  occupational
alternative  perceptions  (Neapolitan,  1980). Neapolitan  (1980)  found  that  personal
beliefs  about  the  control  a person  has  over  their  life, i.e. internal  locus  of  control,
and  that  hard work is important  to  succeeding in new areas, i.e. higher work  ethic,
played  a major  role  in  decisions  to  change  occupations.  Externals  have  exhibited

higher  continuance  occupational  commitment  (Irving, Coleman, & Cooper,  1997),
while employees  with a lower general work  ethic may feel  the most  'stuck' in  their
occupation  (Blau  &  Ryan,  1997). This  review  of  the  dimensions  of  occupational
entrenchment  and  proposed  antecedents  leads  to  the  following  study  hypotheses:

HI:  Professional  commitment,  job satisfaction,  job involvement,  and  organ-
izational support will be more strongly positively related to  accumulated
costs  vs. limited  alternatives.

H2:  Locus of control and work ethic will be more strongly negatively related

to  limited  alternatives  vs.  accumulated  costs.

Sample  and  procedure

Method

In  1993, the Board  of Registry of  the American  Society  for  Clinical Pathologists  began  a longitudinal
study of work  attitudes  and  career patterns  for  recendy graduated  medical  technologists  (MTs). MTs
work  in  a laboratory  in  a variety  of  health-related  settings  (e.g. hospitals,  independent  laboratories).
They  are  responsible  for  the  accurate  performance  of  tests  that  help  to  determine  the  presence  or
absence of disease. The basic requirement  for  entry into medical technology is a baccalaureate  degree
and  initial  training  or  work  experience  in  the  laboratory.

Surveys  were  sent  to  the  same  randomly  stratified  sample  of  recently  graduated  MTs  across
hundreds  of different  organizations  in  1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and  1997. In  1993, of  the 2002  surveys
mailed  out,  1156  (58%)  useable  surveys  containing  demographic  (e.g.  age,  gender,  marital  status,
education, work location)  data were voluntarily returned. At this point, the cohort changed  to  persons
who initially  responded.  In  1994, 832 of  1156  (72%) surveys were returned  by matched  respondents.
Matching  was  done  using  participant  social  security  numbers.  Information  on  demographics,  and
professional  commitment  was  collected.  In  1995,  739  of  the  1156  (64%)  matched  respondents
voluntarily  responded  to  the  third  survey  collecting  demographic  and  job  satisfaction  data.  In  1996,
for  672  of  1156  (58%)  matched  respondents,  demographic,  locus  of  control,  job  involvement,
organizational  support,  and  work  ethic  data  were  collected.  Finally  in  1997,  646  of  1156  (56%)
matched  participants  responded,  allowing  demographic  and  occupational  entrenchment  data  to  be
collected.  However,  based on  a variable  number  of  respondents  in any survey year, as well as missing
data,  complete  data  was  available  for  only  389  MTs.  A  1993 demographic  variable  comparison  (on
gender, age, marital  status, education,  and work location)  of  the 389 MT complete-data  sample  to  the
767  MT  incomplete-data  sample,  indicated  no  significant  differences.

Analysis  of  the  1993 demographic  data  for  the  sample  of  389  MTs  showed  that:  their  median  age
was 25, with an age range from  21 to 55 years; 78% were women; 97% had a baccalaureate degree and
3% had an advanced degree; 45% were married; 58% worked  in an urban location, 26% in a suburban
location  and  16% in  rural  locations. Most  had  recently  earned  certification  as  an  MT. By  1997, 68%
of  the  sample  was  married.  The  other  demographics  either  increased  as  expected  (e.g.  age)  or
remained  stable.

Survej  items
1997 outcomes.  Occupational  entrenchment  was  measured  using  six  items  taken  from  Carson  et  aL
(1995). Survey  length  constraints  led  to  using  only  two  of  four  items/dimensions.  These  two  items
showed  high  factor  loadings  on  the  emodonal  costs, investments  and  limited  alternative  dimensions.
The six items  are: emotional  costs, 'to  change  from  medical technology  to  another  occupadon  would
require  too  high  of  an  emodonal  cost'  and  'it would  be emotionally  difficult  to  change  from  medical
technology  to  another  occupation';  investments,  'for  me  to  enter  another  occupation  would  mean
giving  up  a substantial  investment  in  medical technology'  and  'I would  have  too  much  time  invested

in  medical  technology  to  change  occupadohs',  and  limited  alternatives,  'given  my  experience  and
background,  there  are  other  occupations  besides  medical  technology  available  to  me'  (R = reverse-
scored)  and  'if  I  left  medical  technology,  there  are  other  occupational  alternatives  for  me'  (R).  Item
responses  were  made  using  a  4-point  scale,  1 =  strongly  disagree,  2 = disagree,  3 = agree  and
4 = strongly  agree.

1993  antecedents.  Gender  was  measured  by  indicating  1 = female,  2 = male.  Age  was  based  on
respondents' filling in  their  year  of  birth.
1994 antecedent.  Professional  commitment  was  measured  using five items  adapted  from  Blau's  (1985)
career  commitment  scale. A sample item is 'if I  could  do it all over again, I would  choose  to work in
the  medical  technology  profession'.  A  4-point  response  scale,  1 = strongly  disagree  to  4 =  strongly
agree, was  used.  Items  were  summed  to  create  a  scale  score.

1995 antecedent. ]oh  satisfaction  was  measured  using Spector's  (1985)  measure, which  sums  nine  facet
scales: pay, promotion,  supervision,  benefits,  contingent  rewards, operating  procedures,  co-workers,
nature  of  work  and  communication.  A  4-point  response  scale,  1 = strongly  disagree  to  4 =  strongly
agree, was  used.  Items  were  summed  to  create  a scale  score.

1996 antecedents. Locus  of  control  was  measured  using  four  items  based  on  Spector's  (1988)  16-item
measure.  A  sample  item  is: 'a  job  is what  you  make it'.  The  higher  the  score  the  more  internal  (vs.
external)  the  respondent  is  (Spector,  1988). Job  involvement  was  measured  using  three  items  based
on  Kanungo's  (1982)  10-item  measure.  A  sample  item  is  'I  am  very  iiiuch  involved  in  my  job'.
Organizational  support was measured  by three items  based  on  Eisenberger,  Huntington,  Hutchinson,
and  Sowa's  (1986)  36-item  scale. A  sample  item  is  'the  organization  values  my opinion'.  Work  ethic
was  measured  using three  items  based  on  Blau  and  Ryan's  (1997)  18-item  scale. A  sample  item  is 'if
you work hard you will succeed'. Responses were made on a 4-point scale, where  1 = strongly disagree
to  4 = strongly  agree. Items  were  summed  to  form  respective  scale  scores.

Confirmatory  factor  analyses

Results

Given  the  small  number  of  occupational  entrenchment  items  involved,  any  factor
analysis  results  need  to  be  interpreted  cautiously.  Confirmatory  factor  analyses
(Arbuckle,  1997)  were  conducted  on  the  six  occupational  entrenchment  items.
Cornbining  the investments  and  emotional  costs items into a broader  'accumulated
costs'  dimension  resulted  in  the  following  fit  statistics  for  the  oblique  two-factor
(i.e. accumulated  costs, limited  alternatives)  model:  X^(7) = 8.25, p > .05;  goodness
of  fit  (GFI)  = .987;  adjusted  goodness  of  fit  (AGFI) = .955;  root  mean  square
residual  (RMSR) = .027. These values indicate  an acceptable  fit  (Bollen,  1989), and
statistically  support  the proposed  two-factor  structure. Breaking the  overall  sample
down  by gender  (male vs. female),  and  age  (24 or less vs. 25 or  more)  and  running
confirmatory  factor  analyses  also  provided  support  for  the  proposed  two-factor
structure.  Results  for  a  three-factor  model  (investments,  emotional  costs,  limited
alternatives)  are  comparable:  x^(5) = 4.42,  /) > .05;  GFI =  .989;  AGFI  = .961;
RMSR = .019. Finally,  using  a one-factor  model  to  represent  all  six items  resulted
in  a poor  data  fit:  ^2(9) =  572.5, ;>< .05; GFI = .777; AGFI  = .579; RMSR = .097.

investments  have  higher  means  than  limited  occupadonal  alternadves.  All  muld-
item  scales,  except  locus  of  control,  have  internal  consistencies  of  at  least  .70
(Nunnally,  1978). The  correladon  of  .69 between  emodonal  costs  and  investments
indicates  a stronger  overlap  between  these  scales  vs.  the  correladon  of  .48  which
Carson  et al. (1995)  found.  To  illustrate  further  the  lack  of  discriminant  validity
(Tesser  &  Krauss,  1976)  between  emodonal  costs  and  investments  as  disdnguish-
able  dimensions,  none  of  the  1993,  1994,  1995  or  1996  antecedents  in  Table  1
exhibited  a significantly  different  correladon  to  emodonal  costs  vs. investments.

involvement 

/(386) = 4.31;  job 

However,  as  Table  1  indicates,  significant  correladonal  differences  (p < .05,
two-tailed)  were  found  between  accumulated  costs  vs.  limited  alternadves  for
professional  commitment  /(386) = 4.10;  job  sadsfacdon  /(386) = 2.32;  locus  of
control 
/(386) = 3.45;  organizadonal  support
/(386) = 4.98;  and  work  ethic  /(386) = 3.29.  The  significance  of  the  difference
between  same-sample  correladons  was  determined  using  an  r to  ;^ transformadon
(McNemar,  1969,  p.  158).  These  results  support  the  two  study  hypotheses,  i.e.
HI—professional  commitment,  job  sadsfacdon,  job  involvement,  and  organiz-
adonal  support  are  more  strongly  posidvely  related  to  accumulated  costs  than
limited  alternadves,  and  H2—externality  (locus  of  control)  and  lower  work  ethic
are  more  strongly  related  to  limited  alternadves  than  accumulated  costs.  These
significant  correladonal  difl'erences  provide  support  for  a two-dimension  represen-
tadon  of  occupadonal  entrenchment.  Gender  and  age  did  not  have  a  differendal
impact  on  limited  alternadves  vs. accumulated  costs.

Regression  was  done  as  a  summary  analysis,  to  determine  how  much  overall
variance  (Ic)  in limited  alternadves  and  accumulated  costs  could  be explained.  For
limited  alternadves,  R^ = .08,  overall  i^=  3.27,  ^<  .01.  For  accumulated  costs,
R^  = .\l,  overall/^=  7.50,/)<.01.

Discussion

Collecdvely,  the  findings  of  this  study  more  strongly  supported  a  two-dimension,
i.e. accumulated  costs and limited alternadves, vs. three-dimension, i.e. investments,
emodonal  costs  and  limited  alternadves  (Carson  et al.,  1995),  representadon  of
occupadonal  entrenchment.  More  'dynamic'  situadonal  antecedents  such  as  job
sadsfacdon,  job  involvement,  and  perceived  organizadonal  support  seem  to  hold
greater  promise  for  influencing  perceived  accumulated  occupadonal  costs  (Carson
et al., 1996). The  potendally  pessimisdc  end-state  of  limited  occupadonal  alterna-
dves  (Carson  & Carson,  1997)  was  more  affected  by  the  more  stable  disposidonal
antecedents  of  locus  of  control  and  work  ethic.  However,  if  occupadonal
entrenchment  is  a  gradual  process  (Carson  &  Carson,  1997),  showing  that
percepdons  of  accumulated  costs  and  limited  alternadves  change  differendy  over
dme  would  provide  further  evidence  for  their  discriminant  validides  (Tesser  &
Kxauss,  1976).

There  are  important  study  limitadons  to  note.  First,  owing  to  survey  length
constraints,  two-item  instead  of  four-item  (Carson  et al., 1995)  measures  of  each
occupadonal  entrenchment  dimension  were  collected.  Excluding  items  may  have

narrowed  the breadth  of the dimensions  tested, affecting  the  factor  analyses, and is
an  alternative  explanation  for  finding  a  stronger  relationship  between  emodonal
costs  and  investments.  Survey  length  constraints  also  forced  shorter  antecedent
measures  to  be  used. The  sample  consisted  of  primarily  early  career  stage,  female
medical  technologists.  Replication  of  study  results  using  f\ill-length  measures  and
other  samples  is  necessary.  Time  differences  in  measurement  periods  between
antecedents  and  outcomes  (e.g.  relationship  of  1995  job  satisfaction  vs.  1996
organizational  support  to  1997  limited  alternatives)  may have  affected  the  results.
Repeated  measures  of  predictors  to  create  equal predictor-outcome  time  intervals
would  have  controlled  for 
'occupationally  portable'  meta-
competencies, such as adaptability and self-management  (Hall & Moss, 1998), could
have allowed for  explaining greater variance in limited alternatives and  accumulated
costs.

this.  Measuring 

Looking  at  these  results  in  a  broader  context,  recent  empirical  research  has
supported  a  three-dimensional  representation  of  occupational  commitment,  con-
sisting  of  affective,  normative  and  continuance  dimensions  (Irving  et al.,  1997;
Meyer,  Allen,  &  Smith,  1993).  Employees  with  stronger  affective  occupational
commitment  remain  in  their  occupation  because  they want  to, stronger  normative
commitment  because they feel they ought to, and stronger continuance  commitment
because  they need to. This three-dimensional  structure of occupational  commitment
extends  Meyer  and  Allen's  (1991)  three-dimension,  i.e.  affective,  normative  and
continuance,  representation  of  organizational  commitment.

However,  confirmatory  factor  analyses  of  organizational  commitment  have
found  two  distinguishable  dimensions  within  continuance  commitment, 
'high
personal  sacrifice'  and  'few  employment  alternatives'  (Allen  &  Meyer,  1996).
Despite  the difference  in occupational vs. organizational  referents,  there is a strong
dimension  correspondence  of  'accumulated  costs' (here) to  'high personal  sacrifice'
and  'limited  alternatives'  (here)  to  'few  employment  alternatives'.  Unfortunately,
neither  the Meyer et al.  (1993) nor Irving et al.  (1997) studies tested  for  continuance
occupational commitment being composed of multiple factors. Visual inspection of
the Meyer  et al. (1993, p. 44)  six-item  continuance  occupational  commitment  scale
suggests  that  these  two  themes  of  'accumulated  costs'  and  'limited  alternatives'
may  be  present.  Four  of  these  six  items  (1, 3,  4,  6)  suggest  'accumulated  costs'
(e.g. 'I  have put  too  much into  the  nursing profession  to consider  changing now').
One  item  (2,  'changing  professions  now  would  be  difficult  for  me  to  do')
indicates  'limited  alternatives',  and  one  item  (5)  is  ambiguous,  i.e.  'there  are  no
pressures  to  keep  me  from  changing  professions'  (reverse-scored).  Irving  et al.
(1997,  p.  448)  gave  a  breakdown  of  the  squared  parameter  estimate  vs.  error
component  for each of these six Meyer etal. (1993) items. Three items  (1, 5, 6) have
error components  of over .50, suggesting that these items can be improved  (Bollen,
1989).

As  noted  above,  the  occupational  entrenchment  dimensions  of  accumulated
costs  and  limited  alternatives  strongly  parallel  the  high  personal  sacrifice  and  few
employment  alterntives  dimensions  identified  within  continuance  organizational
commitment.  This  suggests  that  items  from  the  full  occupational  entrenchment
scale  may  be  helpful  in  building  a  stronger  two-factor  measure  of  continuance

occupational  commitment.  Empirical  research,  using  complete  measures  of  occu-
pational  entrenchment  (Carson  et al., 1995)  and  occupational  commitment  (Meyer
et al.,  1993), is needed  to test this idea. However, if support is found,  by subsuming
occupational  entrenchment  within  an  expanded  profile  model  (Law,  Wong,  &
Mobley,  1998) of occupational  commitment,  this will allow researchers  to  focus  on
a  common  construct.  Such  a  focus  should  lead  to  more  consistent  and  useful
research  findings  (Hinkin,  1995).
