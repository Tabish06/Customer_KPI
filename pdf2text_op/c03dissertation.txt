CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

New product development (NPD) has become increasingly important to the 

competitive postures of companies within many industries.  In a recent survey of 1,800 

corporate executives sponsored by the American Advertising Federation, product 

development was ranked as the most important marketing tactic, surpassing even 

strategic planning (Neubome 1999).  A number of trends have contributed to this 

increased importance of and reliance on innovation and NPD.  New product development 

takes place in an environment that is characterized by increased competition both 

domestic and global, the continuous introduction of new products and processes and 

changing customer requirements that shorten product life cycles, rising product 

development costs, and an increased reliance on collaboration in the NPD and 

commercialization processes (Gupta and Wilemon 1990; Wheelwright and Clark 1992).

Effective NPD requires a collaborative effort among a variety of personnel both 

inside the developing organization and outside.  One key source of input to the 

development process is the customer.  A fundamental tenet in marketing, the marketing 

concept, holds that “the key to achieving organizational goals consists in determining the 

needs and wants of target markets (customers) and delivering the desired satisfaction 

more effectively and efficiently than competitors” (Kotler 1984, p.22).  Thus, the

participation of customers in the NPD process is an essential requirement for new product 

success.

The increasing importance of relationship marketing has been called both a 

"fundamental reshaping of the field” (Webster 1992) as well as a genuine paradigm shift 

in marketing (Day and Wensley 1983; Gronroos 1994).  The movement away from arm’s 

length exchanges in favor of long-term relational exchanges will continue as companies 

refine their own core competencies and rely more on those of outside partners.  These 

relationships extend into and should enhance the NPD process.  A majority of dyadic 

channel relationship research has focused on the relational benefits that accrue to the 

customer (e.g., Lusch and Brown 1996; Noordewier, John and Nevin 1990).  This study 

investigates the benefits of channel relationships that accrue to the supplier in terms of 

customer acceptance of their new product.

New Product Development

Technologies continue to change.  While this technological change tends to make 

existing products obsolete, it also provides opportunities for new products.  Over 50 years 

ago, this increasing pace of technological change and the subsequent obsolescence of 

products was referred to as a “perennial gale of creative destruction” by Schumpeter 

(1950, p. 68).  The pace continues, driving the need for more and better new products.

As the demand for new products continues to accelerate, many companies remain 

dissatisfied with their level of new product success.  Hopkins found that nearly two-thirds 

of industrial firms view their new product success rate as “disappointing” or 

“unacceptable” (Hopkins  1980).  If new product success is defined as meeting original

criteria when commercialized, more recent evidence from the Product Development 

Management Association shows that new product success rates for manufacturing firms 

in the United States are between about fifty-five and sixty percent (Griffin 1997).  One of 

the more important reasons for the disappointing success rates for new products is the 

lack of customer participation in the design of the new products (Cooper and 

Kleinschmidt 1987).

Though technology continues to change, current trends regarding the evolving 

climate for innovation show that the driving force for new products is not so much 

science and technology—aspiring to technological excellence—as it is satisfying  the 

customers for whom the product is intended—the necessity to create customer value 

(Gupta and Wilemon 1996; Zirger and Maidique 1990).

Relationship Marketing

If relationship marketing is truly a paradigm shift in marketing, then it should 

have an impact on all facets of marketing including NPD.  But based on an extensive 

review of the literature, the effect of close relations with customers on the likelihood of 

their acceptance of a new product has been little studied.  Issues such as the participation 

of customers in the NPD process have been studied (e.g., Ciccantelli and Magidson 

1993), but not in the context of important relational variables such as trust, satisfaction, 

and continuity expectations.

Purpose of This Study

This study seeks to address the following research question:  How does the level 

of participation of an industrial customer (user) in a supplier’s NPD process impact the 

likelihood of that participant accepting the new product from the supplier?  Delineation 

of the terminology used in this dissertation is necessary.  The term “participation” refers 

to the amount of input by the customer in terms of the level of communication with the 

supplier during the NPD process.

In addition to investigating the effect of design participation on new product 

acceptance, the study  also evaluates the direct and moderating effects of two other sets of 

important constructs:  relationship quality and product characteristics.  The study 

methodology also allows the comparison of effect sizes between the different predictor 

variables, giving an indication of the differential contributions of  these factors to 

successful NPD.

Summary of Contributions

This dissertation makes substantive contributions to the field of marketing in a 

number of areas.  A model of industrial new product acceptance is developed.  Existing 

research is reviewed and extended, pertinent constructs are developed and refined, and 

the conceptual relationships between them are empirically tested.  The results of the study 

have important implications in the following areas:

New Product Development

This study contributes to the NPD literature in a number of ways.  First is the 

finding that relationship quality has a significant positive effect on user acceptance of a

new product.  This is the first study that could be identified that has included a global 

measure of interfirm relationship quality as a determinant of  new product acceptance.

The development of two new formative scales also contributes to the NPD 

literature.  The scale of intercompany NPD participation takes a view of participation 

based on all forms of communication methods during the NPD process.  The scale of user 

acceptance is the first known to take a multi-item measure of new product acceptance 

from the customer’s perspective.

Relationship Marketing

Showing that relationship quality has a significant positive effect on user 

acceptance of new products offers further support for the concept of relationship 

marketing and is a contribution to that field.

Sales Management

Sales managers and field salespeople hold great responsibility for building 

relationships with customers (Weitz and Bradford 1999; Jap 2001a).  The positive effect 

of relationship quality on new product acceptance will provide impetus for salespeople to 

build closer relationships with their customers in order to increase the likelihood of new 

product acceptance.

Outline of the Dissertation

This dissertation is organized into five chapters.  This first chapter is an 

introduction to the dissertation and provides an overview of the basic concepts entailed 

within the study and the purpose and substantive contribution of the dissertation.  The 

second chapter serves to provide a more in-depth review of the independent variables in

the proposed model—user participation in NPD, relationship quality, and product 

innovativeness—and their relationship to the dependent variable—new product 

acceptance.  A review of moderating effects in the proposed model is also included. 

Finally, this section includes the research hypotheses and the proposed model.  Chapter 3 

presents the research design and methodology used to test the model including the 

operationalization of constructs.  Chapter 4  presents the results of the analysis of the data 

including the testing of the hypotheses.  Finally, chapter 5 discusses the implications of 

the study results including limitations and suggestions for future research.

CHAPTER II

LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES

New Product Development Success

The importance of NPD for companies has been noted.  Thus, it is not surprising 

that there has been a great amount of research performed regarding the elements of 

successful NPD.  It is also not surprising that many studies have substantiated the 

importance of integrating user requirements into the NPD process (Bailetti and Litva 

1995).

Studies of NPD success have been categorized as either generalist—studying 

many determinants of success, or specialist—studying relatively few determinants 

(Gruner and Homburg 2000).  This section will briefly review the generalist studies of 

new product success.  The next section, User Participation in New Product Development, 

will review those specialist studies that have included user participation as a determinant 

of new product success.

One of the earliest sets of generalist studies was the SAPPHO project (Rothwell et 

al.  1974).  This series of studies concluded that an understanding of users’ needs was the 

most important discriminator between new product success and failure.  Cooper and 

Kleinschmidt have performed a number of studies that link new product success with 

effective project protocol—the up-front understanding of users’ needs and preferences 

(cf. Cooper 1988; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1987; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1994).

Clark and Fujimoto (1990) refer to external integrity, “the consistency between a 

product’s performance and customers’ expectations” (p.  108), as the single most 

important task for NPD.  In the first two phases of their three-phase, seven-year study of 

over 330 new products in the electronics industry, Zirger and Maidique (1990) found that 

new product success was greater when the firm had an in-depth understanding of its 

customers and the marketplace.  In a survey of 151  companies in both high- and non­

high-tech industries, Karakaya and Kobu (1994) asked respondents to evaluate the 

importance of sources of new product ideas.  In both types of industries, the respondents 

evaluated users as the most important source of new product ideas.

The participation of users in the NPD process is clearly necessary for the 

developing firms to gain the necessary knowledge of their customers’ needs and wants. 

Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of understanding customer needs to 

successful industrial NPD.

A meta-analysis on NPD success factors (Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994) 

offers further support for the link between user participation in NPD and new product 

success.  In their meta-analysis, Montoya-Weiss and Calantone reviewed forty-seven 

empirical studies on new product performance.  Criteria for inclusion of the studies in 

their analysis was that they have (1) a  dependent variable measuring the commercial 

performance of a new product, project or program, and (2) one or more explanatory 

factors (independent variables).  Though the authors noted concerns with inconsistent 

methodologies and incomplete statistics in the studies reviewed,  they were able to 

identify eighteen factors that were significant discriminators of new product success. 

Within these eighteen success factors, four stood out.  These were not only the four most

frequently studied explanatory variables, but they were also identified by the authors as 

being primary discriminators between success and failure in previous qualitative reviews 

of published research on new product performance.

The four primary discriminators of new product success identified by Montoya- 

Weiss and Calantone (1994) were:

•  Proficiency of technical activities

•  Proficiency of market-related activities

•  Product advantage

•  Protocol

The key factor relating to the current study is protocol, which “refers to the firm's 

knowledge and understanding of specific marketing and technical aspects prior to product 

development; for example, (1) the target market, (2) customer needs, wants, and 

preferences, (3) the product concept, and (4) product specifications and requirements.

This factor includes ‘origin of idea’ measures as well” (Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 

1994, p. 415).  The capability of a firm to demonstrate excellent protocol is dependent on 

its ability to secure input from the user.  The significance of protocol as a primary 

discriminator of new product performance indicates that user participation in the NPD 

process should increase the likelihood of user acceptance of the new product.

Generalist research on NPD success since the Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 

meta-analysis continues to demonstrate the importance of user participation in the NPD 

process.  Song and Parry (1997), in a study of 788 Japanese new products, found that the 

level of competitive and market intelligence was positively related to new product 

success.  The competitive and market intelligence construct includes the following item:

9

“During the development of this product, we understood the customer’s purchase 

decision well—the ‘who, what, when, where and how’ of his (or her) purchase behavior 

for this selected product” (Song and Parry 1997, p. 74).  Finally, a more recent meta­

analysis of 41  studies found that the developing firm managers’ perceptions of the new 

product meeting the customers’ needs was a dominant driver of new product success 

(Henard and Szymanski 2001).  Thus, there is ample evidence that participation of users 

in the NPD process that results in greater knowledge of their needs increases the 

likelihood of new product success.

In the current study, new product success is defined in terms of new product 

acceptance by the user.  New product acceptance is defined from the perspective of the 

customer.  Since no studies could be identified that view acceptance by the customer in 

other than a dichotomous manner (i.e., accept/not accept), this study seeks to broaden the 

conceptualization.  New product acceptance is therefore represented  by four interrelated 

variables:  (1) the level of satisfaction with the new product; (2) the likelihood of future 

purchases of the new product; (3) the percent of total business for a particular product 

application given to the new product offering; and (4) the percent of total business that 

the purchasing firm would like to give to the new product if they were unencumbered by 

any prior commitments.

User Participation in New Product Development

This section reviews the literature more specific to the effect of customer 

participation on new product success.  There are two contexts for marketing channel 

member participation in NPD.  These contexts are delineated in terms of the channel

10

member that is designing the new product and is responsible for performing the NPD 

process.  The first is supplier participation in the NPD process of the manufacturer.

There has been a considerable amount of research into supplier participation in 

manufacturer NPD going back at least 30 years when Myers and Markquis (1969) noted 

the contribution of supplier participation in NPD to early resolution of problems in the 

development process.  More recent work has been conducted by Ragatz, Handheld and 

Scanned (1997), McGinnis and Vallopra (1998), and Bidault, Despres and Butler (1998). 

But it is the second context that the present study seeks to investigate—the participation 

of customers (i.e., users) in their supplier’s NPD process.

Each of the studies cited in the previous section (New Product Development 

Success) deals with a relatively broad range of  determinants of new product performance 

of which user participation is but one.  Several of these studies pointed to the importance 

of user participation by showing the importance of up-front activities in the NPD process. 

But none focused on user participation or attempted to operationalize it.  Following is a 

review of those specialist studies that have dealt more explicitly with the concept of user 

participation as a determinant of new product success.

There is an extensive literature on the impact of user participation on information 

systems development success (e.g., Hunton 1996; Ives and Olson 1984; McKeen and 

Guimaraes  1997).  One of the important distinctions noted in this literature is the 

difference between involvement and participation.  Whereas many researchers have used 

the term involvement to describe the inclusion of various parties (e.g., customers, 

suppliers, internal functional areas) in the NPD process, Barki and Hartwick (1989) noted 

that there should be a distinction between these two terms.  They made two

11

recommendations: (1) to use the term user participation instead of user involvement 

when referring to the assignments, activities, and behaviors that users or their 

representatives perform during the systems development process, and (2) to use the term 

user involvement to refer to a subjective psychological state reflecting the importance and 

personal relevance that a user attaches to a given system.  This literature will be revisited 

when the user participation construct is operationalized in the following chapter.

The information systems development literature has generally found that user 

participation contributes to increased user satisfaction, acceptance, and use of the 

information system.  There has also been a considerable amount of research into the 

beneficial effects of individuals’ participation in decision-making processes (e.g., 

Ashmos, Duchon and McDaniel 1998; Oswald, Mossholder and Harris 1997).  But in 

each of these cases, the studies focus on intra-organizational interactions as opposed to 

external user relations (Gales and Mansour-Cole 1995).  Since the current study focuses 

on external user participation in the NPD process, these literatures will not be further 

reviewed.

Some of the earliest and most well-known work in studying user participation in 

NPD was conducted by von Hippel (1978).  In this article, von Hippel presented his 

Customer-Active Paradigm (CAP) and contrasted it with the Manufacturer-Active 

Paradigm (MAP).  In the CAP, “it is the role of the would-be customer to develop the 

idea for the new product; select a supplier capable of making the product; and take the 

initiative to send a request to the selected supplier.” (von Hippel 1978, p. 40)  His 

conclusion was that the CAP was a better fit to the requirements of industrial new 

product idea generation than the MAP.  Von Hippel’s original and subsequent (e.g., von

12

Hippel 1988) emphasis has been on the user as the “functional source of innovation.”

This refers to a particular set of customers (“lead users”) as being not only the source of 

the new product idea, but also performing up-front design tasks on their own when they 

perceive that the economic rents are attractive.

If the performance measure of NPD success is reduced NPD project cycle time, a 

number of studies have shown the benefits of customer particiption in NPD.  In their 

study of 31 high-technology firms,  Karagozoglu and Brown (1993) found that customer 

participation tied with the use of cross-functional teams were the factors contributing 

most to reduced NPD project cycle times.  Gupta and Souder (1998) also found a positive 

relationship between customer participation and reduced cycle time in their study of 110 

high-technology new products.  But even though the conventional wisdom states that 

reduced cycle time results in greater likelihood of new product success and improved 

organizational performance, there is evidence to the contrary.  In their study of two 

industries (automobiles and computers) in four countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and 

the United States), Ittner and Larcker (1997) found no support for the performance- 

enhancing effects of reduced cycle time in NPD.  Thus the remainder of the studies cited 

here use more traditional commercial measures of new product success.

Gales and Mansour-Cole (1995) used an information processing approach in their 

conceptualization of user participation.  They measured the  number of users contacted 

and frequency of user contact by NPD managers.  In their study of 44 innovation 

projects, they found a significant positive relationship between user participation and 

project success.

Li and Calantone (1998) investigated the effect of “customer knowledge process” 

on NPD success.  Customer knowledge process is a broad concept entailing not just 

customer information acquisition, but interpretation and integration as well.  They  found 

a significant and positive relationship between customer knowledge process and new 

product advantage, one of the key discriminators of new product success cited previously.

Souder,  Sherman, and Davies-Cooper (1998) studied R&D/customer integration 

as a determinant of NPD effectiveness.  They found that R&D/customer integration was 

significantly positively associated with three different measures of NPD effectiveness: 

prototype development proficiency, product launch proficiency, and market forecast 

accuracy.  In a previous study of customer-driven NPD, Souder, Buisson, and Garrett 

(1997) found that understanding user needs through tactics such as spending long periods 

of time at customer sites was positively related to new product success.

The most recent study identified as focusing on user participation in NPD was 

conducted by Gruner and Homburg (2000).  Their operationalization of user participation 

was similar to Gales and Mansour-Cole’s (1995) in that it emphasized the number of 

users contacted and the frequency of  these contacts.  They found that the intensity of 

user participation has a significant and positive effect on new product success in the early 

(idea generation, concept development) and late (prototype testing, market launch) stages 

of the NPD process but not the intermediate stages (project definition, engineering).

In spite of the research summarized above, the evidence for the benefits of user 

participation in NPD is not unanimous.  In their study of 88 industrial firms active in 

NPD, Campbell and Cooper (1999) found that there was no significant difference in new 

product performance (on a variety of measures) between partnership and in-house

14

innovation projects.  However, the authors chose to differentiate between partnership and 

in-house projects by letting the respondent choose based on a set of definitions.  A 

partnership project was defined as “a formal working relationship in which both partners 

worked closely together and shared both the costs and benefits of the project;” in-house 

development was defined as “an internal development with either minimal, or some 

contact with multiple customers undertaken at arms length and not with any one lead 

customer” (Campbell and Cooper 1999, p. 512).  The analysis was conducted based on 

this dichotomy instead of a continuous variable.  The current study uses a continuous 

formative operationalization of user participation.

Campbell and Cooper (1999) evaluated a number of project and partnership 

characteristics to explain the insignificant results.  Of the six project characteristics 

studied, only one—target market concentration—was significantly different between 

project types suggesting that the developing firms may enter into partnership projects for 

marketing reasons instead of pursuing the best possible partner resources.  Interestingly, 

of the six partnership characteristics studied, only one—ongoing participation by the 

customer—was a significant discriminator of project success in terms of financial impact. 

This ongoing participation construct was measured with two items:  past interactions and 

intent for future interactions with the customer in new product projects.  Thus, even 

though the authors found no significant differences in new product performance based 

upon their dichotomous operationalization of  user participation, they did find that a 

history of customer participation on innovation projects and future intentions to work 

with a customer on new product projects did have a significant impact on new product 

performance.  This ongoing participation construct taps the same conceptual domain as

the user participation construct offering some support for the benefits of user 

participation despite the main findings of the study.

Finally, a recent meta-analysis found that while customer input was not a 

significant driver of new product performance, it did find that having a product that meets 

customer needs was a dominant driver (Henard and Szymanski 2001).

The role of functional integration or the joint participation of the internal 

functions of the firm (especially marketing and R&D) in contributing to the success of 

the NPD process has been studied extensively (e.g., Griffin and Hauser 1996; Gupta, Raj 

and Wilemon 1986; Kahn 1996).  But very limited attention has been directed at 

customer integration or participation in the NPD process as a means to increase new 

product success (Gruner and Homburg 2000).  The current study seeks to help remedy 

this deficit.

While research to date has demonstrated the importance of user participation in 

NPD, there has been criticism that industrial firms in particular are not emphasizing user 

knowledge and participation in NPD process to the degree that they should (Clark and 

Fujimoto  1990; Cooper 1988; Parkinson 1985; von Hippel 1978).  The current study 

explores whether industrial firms are moving toward greater participation of users and 

hopes to offer more empirical evidence of the importance of user participation in NPD.

User participation in the current study is defined as the level of  interaction 

between the user and the developing firm in terms of project-related communication 

during the NPD process for a specific product.  It is a project-level construct.  It is 

operationalized as a formative measure based on the level of communication between the 

user and the supplier during the specific NPD process.  It is expected that user

participation in a developing firm’s NPD process will be positively associated with the 

user’s acceptance of that specific new product:

H I:  User participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process will be positively related to 
user acceptance of that new product.

Relationship Quality

Marketing Channel Relationships

It has been noted that relationship marketing represents a new paradigm in 

marketing (Day and Wensley 1983; Gronroos 1994).  Anderson and colleagues stated 

that “In business-to-business settings, dyadic relationships between firms are of 

paramount interest” (Anderson, Hakansson and Johanson 1994, p.  1).  This section will 

offer a brief overview of the relationship marketing literature in general.  The following 

section will present a more specific review of research that has investigated the impact of 

inter-firm relationships on industrial NPD success.

Relationship marketing has been defined as “all marketing activities directed 

toward establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges” 

(Morgan and Hunt 1994).  Morgan and Hunt also identified ten different types of 

marketing relationships that a focal firm can have.  These relationships were broken 

down into supplier partnerships, lateral partnerships, buyer partnerships, and internal 

partnerships (Morgan and Hunt 1994).  This broadening of the concept of relationship 

marketing  beyond the initial emphasis on a “customer relations” conceptualization may 

in part be responsible for the lack of consensus on just what relationship marketing is 

(Bejou 1997; Morris, Brunyee and Page 1998).  This lack of agreement on the definition

17

of relationship marketing and the application of the concept to more and different types 

of relationships require that one carefully delineate the type and context of the 

relationships under study.  For example, a great deal of empirical research has been 

directed at relationships within the context of marketing channels.  These relationships 

would fall under buyer and supplier partnerships in Morgan and Hunt’s typology.  But 

even within industrial marketing channels, there are many different types of relationships.

The vast majority of research into marketing channel relationships has addressed 

two contexts:  (1) supplier and manufacturer (e.g., Cannon and Perreault 1999; Doney 

and Cannon 1997; Dorsch, Swanson and Kelley 1998); and (2) manufacturer and agent or 

merchant intermediary (e.g., Boyle et al.  1992; John son 1999; Weitz and Jap  1995).  This 

review and the current study will focus on supplier and manufacturer (i.e., customer, 

user) relationships in industrial channels.

Research dealing with the performance implications of manufacturer-supplier 

relationships takes one of the two perspectives.  From the perspective of the buyer, the 

underlying reasons for pursuing relationships with suppliers include increased cost 

efficiency, increased effectiveness, enabling technologies, and increased competitiveness 

(Sheth and Sharma 1997).  The majority of the literature on channel relationships takes 

the perspective of the buyer by emphasizing the benefits to them of closer relationships 

with fewer suppliers (e.g., Cannon and Homburg 2001).

The current study takes the perspective of the seller in terms of the benefits to 

them of closer channel relationships.  Most of the studies addressing the performance 

implications of channel relationships from the seller’s perspective are from the sales 

management literature.  For example, in their study of 126 buyers, Biong and Seines

18

(1996) found that a salesperson has a substantial influence on a buyer’s motivation to 

continue in their relationship and that this desire to continue in the relationship should 

result in increased long-term sales for the salesperson.  Leuthesser (1997) studied 454 

relationships and found that for longstanding relationships, the quality of the relationship 

had a significant effect on the supplier’s share of business.  In a recent review of 

relationship marketing in personal selling and sales management, Weitz and Bradford 

(1999) describe the evolving partnering role of the salesperson and reiterate the 

performance benefits to be achieved when the sales function emphasizes building 

relationships rather than making short-term sales.  But little research from the sales 

management literature emphasize the importance of the buyer-supplier relationship on 

new product acceptance by the buyer (Anderson 1996).

One study outside of the sales management literature that took the perspective of 

the supplier investigated whether suppliers benefit from long-term relationships with 

customers.  In this study, Kalwani and Narayandas (1995) found that suppliers in long­

term relationships are more profitable (measured by return on investment) than suppliers 

with multiple short-term contracts.  And while the authors discuss the increased 

understanding and responsiveness to the customer that come about as a result of these 

relationships, they do not specifically address the impact of the relationships on the 

likelihood of customer acceptance of new products.

Some of the research on the performance implications of channel relationships 

has investigated both sides of the dyad.  In a longitudinal study of  over 220 channel 

dyads, Jap (1999) concluded that the dyads’ mutual investments and efforts to exploit the 

unique characteristics of their relationship resulted in improved profit performance and

19

competitive advantages.  Finally, Cannon and Perreault (1999) developed a taxonomy of 

business relationship types based on relationship profiles of over 400 buyer-supplier 

relationships.  They concluded that “More effective buyer-seller relationships help both 

parties manage uncertainty and dependence, increase efficiency by lowering total costs, 

and enhance product development and market orientation through better knowledge of 

customers and their needs” (Cannon and Perreault 1999, p. 458).  It is this last benefit of 

relationships—enhancing product development—that is the emphasis of the current 

study.  The following section will review the literature that has investigated the impact of 

channel relationships on the NPD process.

Channel Relationships and New Product Development

Before proceeding with this section, it is necessary to clarify and distinguish the 

meaning of relationship used in this study.  There has been very little research 

investigating the impact of channel relationships on the NPD process.  The research that 

has been conducted (e.g., Athaide and Stump  1999; Campbell and Cooper 1999; More 

1986; Parkinson  1985) invariably takes a broad view of the definition of relationships 

that includes collaboration on NPD.  These studies confound the two key independent 

variables of the current study, namely user participation in a specific NPD project and 

relationship quality between the user and supplier firms.

In the current study, the measure of the channel relationship is relationship 

quality.  The measure of relationship quality is a higher-order construct that encompasses 

trust, satisfaction, and continuity expectations.  It is a global measure of the relationship 

between the firms—a firm-level construct.  In contrast, the measure of user participation 

is specific to the activities during a particular NPD process—a project-level construct.

No previous research could be identified that specifically investigated the 

relationship between a global measure of the channel relationship quality and new 

product success.  But the studies reviewed in the previous section (Marketing Channel 

Relationships) do support the performance implications of channel relationships in 

general.  Since new product success plays a key role in overall organizational 

performance (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Wheelwright and Clark 1992), it follows that 

better relationships should be related to new product success.  Thus, it is expected that 

higher relationship quality between the user firm and the supplier firm  will be positively 

associated with user acceptance of a new product:

H2:  The quality of the relationship between the user and the supplier firm will be 
positively related to the user’s acceptance of a new product offering by the supplier.

No studies could be identified that propose any type of moderating effect of 

relationship quality in a model of new product acceptance or success.  As has been noted 

previously, there has been little research conducted on the direct effect of channel 

relationships on new product success.  Nonetheless, there is face validity in the 

supposition that a higher quality relationship between the supplier and customer firms 

should strengthen the positive relationship between the customer’s participation in the 

NPD process and their acceptance of that new product.  A higher quality relationship 

means that the firms have worked well together in the past and trust each other.  This 

history and experience will interact with the level of participation in a particular NPD 

project to increase the likelihood that they will accept the new product.  Thus, as the 

quality of the relationship between the firms increases, there should be a stronger 

relationship between user participation and user acceptance of a new product:

21

H3:  The greater the relationship quality between the user and the supplier firms, the 
greater the positive relationship between user participation in a supplier’s specific NPD 
process and user acceptance of that new product.

Product Innovativeness

Product innovativeness in this study refers to the level of newness of the product 

to the purchasing firm.  Past research on the relationship of product innovativeness to 

new product success has been inconclusive, though a positive relationship has received 

the greatest amount of support (Henard and Szymanski 2001).  In the majority of studies, 

though, the innovativeness of the product is assessed by the developing firm.  In the 

current study, innovativeness is as perceived by the user of the new product.

The relationship of innovativeness to user acceptance will be positive:

H4:  The innovativeness of the new product offering will be positively related to the 
user’s acceptance of that new product offering by the supplier.

The innovativeness of the new product offering is also expected to moderate the 

relationship between user participation and user acceptance of the new product.  In their 

study of 45 NPD projects from 12 firms, Olson, Walker and Ruekert (1995) found that 

more participative structures (e.g., teams) contribute to greater effectiveness and 

timeliness of the development process when the product being developed is more 

innovative.  They note that when the product is more innovative, it creates greater 

dependencies and the need for greater information flows between the functional areas 

engaged in the NPD process.  Though they did not study customer participation in the 

development process, the same increased need for participation should be present and

22

lead to a greater likelihood of new product success.  Thus it is expected that as 

innovativeness increases, there should be a stronger relationship between user 

participation and user acceptance of a new product:

H5:  The greater the innovativeness of the new product offering, the greater the positive 
relationship between user participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process and user 
acceptance of that new product.

Product Criticality

Product criticality refers to how important the new product or component is to the 

purchasing firm.  Bello, Lohtia and Dant (1999) hypothesized that the more critical the 

component, the more likely it would be for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to 

collaborate with their vendors in the development of component parts.  Because they did 

not find a statistically significant relationship between criticality and collaboration in 

their sample of electronics manufacturers, they expressed concern about their 

operationalization of criticality as “importance.”  In addition, their operationalization was 

specific to entering goods (i.e., subassemblies and/or components) which were part of a 

larger assembly or product.

Cannon and Perreault (2001) used a very similar construct that they called supply 

importance.  Their operationalization of the construct focused on the importance of a 

specific product to the purchasing firm but was not specific to entering goods.  In their 

study of 428 buyer-supplier relationships, they did find support for a relationship between 

the importance of a product and the likelihood of operational linkages and information 

exchange.

23

While the previously cited studies have focused on the relationship between the 

product importance and level of collaboration between buyers and sellers, the present 

study is concerned with the moderating effect of product criticality on the relationship 

between user participation in NPD and the user’s acceptance of that new product.  It must 

also be noted that criticality is not believed to have a main effect on user acceptance in 

this study—it is a moderator only.  This is because there is no reason to believe that the 

criticality of a product will have any impact on the likelihood of acceptance because 

criticality should not vary between the different suppliers’ offerings.  It reflects only the 

relative importance of that particular product to the purchasing firm.

Though no studies could be found investigating this moderating effect of product 

criticality, Athaide and Stump (1999) found that bilateral collaborations (ongoing 

interactions between buyer and seller) during successful NPD are more common with 

customized products.  If it is reasonable to believe that a more customized product 

indicates a more critical product, then it is expected that as a component becomes more 

critical to the user, there should be a stronger relationship between user participation and 

user acceptance of a new product:

H6:  The greater the product criticality, the greater the positive relationship between user 
participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process and user acceptance of that new 
product.

Model of User Participation in Industrial New Product Development

The proposed model of user participation in industrial NPD including the 

constructs used in this study are shown in Figure 1.  The unit of analysis for the study is a 

particular instance of a new product offering to the buying firm.  This study investigates

the direct effects on new product acceptance of user participation in the NPD process for 

the particular product offering, the quality of the relationship between the user and 

supplier, and the innovativeness of the product offered.  Moderator effects of relationship 

quality, product criticality, and product innovativeness on the relationship between user 

participation and user acceptance are also investigated.  The hypotheses deriving from the 

model are summarized below it.

CHAPTER III

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

Field Study

To test the proposed hypotheses, a field survey of purchasing department key 

informants was conducted to obtain information on the determinants of their new product 

acceptance.  The unit of analysis was a particular instance of a new product offering to 

the buying firm.

Survey Approach

The present study employs a survey methodology to assess the relationships 

between constructs.  The survey approach has been widely used to conduct research in 

the marketing field.  A search of the last two full years (2001-2002) of three respected 

marketing journals (i.e., Journal o f Marketing, Journal o f Marketing Research,  and 

Journal o f the Academy o f Marketing Science) revealed more than 30 articles using a key 

informant survey approach.  Campbell (1955) notes that key informants are able to 

provide reliable assessments of organizational phenomenon provided that they hold 

positions which make them knowledgeable about the issue under investigation and are 

willing to participate in the research project.  While the multiple informant approach may 

be generally preferable (Kumar, Stem and Anderson 1993), resource constraints and the

difficulty identifying additional informants with the requisite knowledge on all aspects of 

the questionnaire make a single informant approach justifiable (Cannon and Perreault 

1999; Heide and John 1990).

Sample Selection

To assess the relationships between constructs, a large representative sample  was 

required.  Because of the sample size required to provide sufficient statistical power, a 

cross-sectional field study method of data collection was employed.  The sampling frame 

consisted of  2,100 names from a list of purchasing professionals provided by the 

National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM).  Many studies of 

interorganizational relationships have successfully employed purchasing professionals as 

key informants (e.g., Cannon and Perreault 1999; Doney and Cannon 1997; Heide and 

Stump  1995; McGinnis and Vallopra 1998; Noordewier, John and Nevin 1990; Sriram, 

Krapfel and Spekman 1992).  In addition, the sales personnel with whom purchasing 

professionals interact have been shown to be the most important source of customer 

information, including their desires for and reactions to new products (Gordon et al.

1997).  The sampling frame contained only manufacturing organizations from the 2-digit 

SIC codes 35, 36, and 37 (industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment; 

electronic and other electrical equipment and components; and transportation equipment) 

representing OEMs involved with purchasing new products from suppliers (Heide and 

John 1990).  The number from each SIC code in the sampling frame was proportional to 

the membership in NAPM.

Data Collection 

Pilot Study

One hundred names were drawn randomly from the 2100-name sampling frame. 

A three-step data collection process was employed.  First, each of the 100 key informants 

was mailed a cover letter, questionnaire, and postage-paid envelope.  Then, at two 

subsequent two-week intervals, all non-respondents were mailed a reminder letter, 

questionnaire, and postage-paid envelope.  Such follow-up mailings have been shown to 

significantly increase overall response rates (Brennan 1992), particularly in industrial 

mail surveys (Jobber 1986; Yammarino, Skinner and Childers  1991).  One other method 

was employed to maximize response rate.  A help-the-sponsor appeal was used in the 

cover letter since it has been shown to significantly increase response rate under 

university sponsorship (Schneider and Johnson 1995).

Twenty-one total responses were received (21% response rate).  Of these 21 

surveys,  15 were usable.  Of the six that were unusable, 4 respondents stated that the 

survey did not apply to them and 2 were unemployed.  The completed surveys indicated 

that the instrument was well-understood by the respondents and no modifications were 

made to the survey for the main study.

Main Study

The main study data collection was initially going to be conducted in the same 

manner as the pilot study, but circumstances dictated a change in procedure.  The main 

study began with an initial mail wave just as the pilot study.  Each of the 2,000 key 

informants was mailed a cover letter, questionnaire, and postage-paid envelope.

Approximately one month later, a second mailing containing the same items was sent to 

the 1,921 non-respondents from the first wave.  A clerical error resulted in 596 of these 

surveys being sent to the wrong address, therefore a third mailing was sent to these.

From the total sampling frame of 2000,  181  (9.05% response rate) total responses 

were received.  Combined with the pilot study, the total overall response rate was 

202/2100 or 9.6%.  The low response rate in the main study required further investigation 

and resulted in a change in the original data collection procedure.  Instead of a third 

mailing wave to all non-respondents,  a phone/fax follow-up campaign was initiated.

A random sample of 500 non-respondents was selected and phoned.  If they were 

contacted, they were asked if the survey applied to them and if they would fill it out.  If 

the survey applied to them and they agreed to complete it, the survey was faxed to them. 

If they were not contacted after five calls over three weeks, they were sent the survey via 

fax.  (The Appendix contains all cover letters, phone scripts, fax transmittal sheets, and 

the survey instrument).  Table 1  shows the breakdown of results from the 500 non­

respondents in the phone/fax follow-up effort.

These results help to explain the relatively low overall response rate.  For many of 

the respondents (35.8%; items 2-4), the research question was not applicable to them.

The large number of individuals no longer with the company as well as bad/wrong 

numbers and inability to contact (52.8%; items 6-8)  can best be explained by aging of 

the list and an economic recession prior to and during data collection.  If one looks only 

at items  1  and 5 as the sampling frame, an effective response rate of 50.9% (29/(39+18)) 

can be calculated.  After all data collection was complete, there was a total of 169 usable 

surveys.  See Table 2 for a summary of respondent companies.

Excluding the company information collected (number of employees; annual 

sales) there was a total of 22 respondents with missing data for a total of 63 missing 

items.  For missing items within a scale, the average of the other items for that respondent 

was substituted.  For missing scales, the average of other respondents was substituted. 

Missing data for any one item or scale did not exceed five percent, thus missing data in 

this study should not present a problem (Roth and Switzer 1999).

An analysis was performed to assess nonresponse bias by comparing respondents 

to non-respondents.  This extrapolation method is based on the idea that “Persons who

and are expected to be similar to nonrespondents” (Armstrong and Overton 1977, p. 397) 

A comparison was made between the first 29 surveys received in the main study and the 

last 29 surveys received as a result of the phone/fax follow-up.  Those results are 

presented in Table 3.

Measurement

To meet the research objectives of the current study, measures of the constructs in 

the model of user participation in industrial NPD were identified.  Wherever possible, 

existing measures were used.  This was the case with all but the user participation and 

user acceptance constructs, which are new formative measures.  Details of scale 

development are presented in appropriate parts of this section.

The survey was first given to two academic experts for review.  Face validity, 

comprehensiveness, clarity, and flow were checked.  After revision, two professional 

buyers reviewed the instrument for face validity, comprehensiveness, clarity, and a test of 

completion time.  After minor modifications, the instrument was retested on a random 

sample of 100 informants from the initial sampling frame of 2,100.  The responses to this 

pilot study indicated that there were no interpretation or other problems associated with 

the instrument.  The following sections describe how each variable in the study was 

measured.

User Acceptance of New Product

Because the vast majority of research on NPD success studies the developing 

firm, the measurement of NPD success has relied most often on commercial measures 

such as sales and profit (Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994).  Some studies have also 

used a dichotomous operationalization of success: adopt/non-adopt (Ayers, Dahlstrom 

and Skinner 1997; Tomatzky and Klein 1982).  Since the current study uses the customer 

firm as the key informant, a customer-based measure of new product acceptance is

34

required.  Also, since a variety of different industries are surveyed in this study, the 

measure must not be specific to a particular product (e.g., automobile).

Griffin and Page (1996) studied a number of success measures at the product level 

and concluded that customer satisfaction and customer acceptance are two of the best 

measures of customer-based NPD success.  But their study did not identify any specific 

operationalizations of these constructs.  The current study seeks to broaden the concept of 

acceptance from the customer’s perspective.  Whereas most studies of new product 

acceptance from the customer’s perspective measure acceptance as a dichotomous 

(adopt/non-adopt) variable, this study uses four separate items to measure new product 

acceptance:  (1) the level of satisfaction with the new product; (2) the likelihood of future 

purchases of the new product; (3) the percent of total business for a particular product 

application given to the new product offering; and (4) the percent of total business that 

the purchasing firm would like to give to the new product if they were unencumbered by 

any prior commitments.  These items are based on both the recommendations of Griffin 

and Page (1996) and on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) proposed by Davis 

(Davis 1989).  Davis’ key construct related to acceptance of information technology was 

intention to use which relates to the future purchase intention item.

There is an extensive literature on customer satisfaction.  The majority of it is 

focused either on consumer markets (see Szymanski and Henard 2001  for a recent meta­

analysis) or global channel member satisfaction if in the context of industrial markets 

(see Geyskens, Steenkamp and Kumar 1999 for a recent meta-analysis).  The current 

study calls for a product specific measure of satisfaction in an industrial channel context.

Measures of product satisfaction can take two forms.  They can either address a 

specific product (Mano and Oliver 1993) or be generalizable.  Because the specific new 

products in the current study will vary between respondents, a generalizable measure is 

required.  Though multi-item measures are generally preferable, Mittal, Ross, and 

Baldasare, Jr. (1998) justified their use of a single-item satisfaction measure by finding 

considerable precedent for such use in the context of large-scale satisfaction studies.

They cite LaBarbera and Mazursky (1983) who discuss the issue of using single- versus 

multi-item scales for measuring overall satisfaction and conclude that, in large-scale 

survey research, the use of multi-item scales may actually decrease the quality of 

measurement rather than enhance it. They also cite Kekre, Krishnan, and Srinivasan 

(1995) who used a single-item measure for overall satisfaction in their large-scale study 

of drivers of customer satisfaction in the computer industry.  Finally, in their meta­

analysis, Szymanski and Henard (2001) state that aggregate (single-item) and attribute 

(multi-item) measures of satisfaction may diverge and that the aggregate measure may be 

a more accurate measure of customer satisfaction.  The measure of satisfaction was a 

seven-level semantic differential scale with the anchors “Very satisfied” and “Very 

dissatisfied” in response to the question: “Based on your ownership experience, how 

would you rate your satisfaction with this new product?”

The second measure of new product success or acceptance recommended by 

Griffin and Page (1996) is product acceptance.  Two single-item measures were used to 

capture this construct.  The first is the likelihood of future purchase or purchase 

intentions.  Mittal, Ross, and Baldasare, Jr. (1998) justified their use of a single-item 

future purchase intention scale in the same manner as they did for the satisfaction scale.

Mittal and colleagues have successfully employed single-item measures of both 

satisfaction and repurchase intent in subsequent studies (Mittal and Kamakura 2001; 

Mittal, Kumar and Tsiros  1999).  The measure of satisfaction was a seven-level semantic 

differential scale with the anchors “Very likely” and “Very unlikely” in response to the 

question: “Based on your ownership experience, how likely are you to purchase this 

product from this supplier at your next purchase occasion?”

The second aspect of product acceptance is two items related to the amount of 

business given to the new product.  The first is a single-item measure of the percentage of 

total business for the specific product application given to the new product offering and 

the second is the amount of business the purchasing firm would like to give to the new 

product if they were unencumbered by any prior commitments to other suppliers.

Studies of new product acceptance from the consumer’s perspective that use a 

dichotomous adopt/non-adopt operationalization of success (e.g., Ayers, Dahlstrom and 

Skinner 1997; O'Callaghan, Kaufmann and Konsynski  1992; Tomatzky and Klein 1982), 

fail to capture the possibility of a company not giving all of their business for a particular 

product to a single supplier or the possibility of prior commitments.  These possibilities 

are incorporated into the overall acceptance measure of the current study.

The resulting scale of user acceptance is a formative indicator.  Unlike reflective 

measures, formative (or causal) indicators make up the latent variable—the latent 

constmct is dependent on the indicators (Bollen and Lennox 1991).  When there is an 

increase in one indicator of a formative scale, there is not necessarily an increase in any 

other.

User Participation in NPD

A variety of different operationalizations of this construct have been used in a 

number of different contexts.  In interorganizational industrial NPD, all studies identified 

that evaluate user participation in NPD are from the perspective of the developing firm. 

Campbell and Cooper (1999) relied on their developer organization key informants to 

classify their NPD projects as either partnership or in-house and their analysis evaluated 

differences between the elements of this dichotomous operationalization.  Others have 

relied on either a single-item measure of frequency of contact (Souder, Buisson and 

Garrett 1997) or multi-item scales that tap both frequency of interaction with and number 

of customers contacted (Gales and Mansour-Cole 1995; Gruner and Homburg 2000).

But the need to tap user participation at the different stages of the NPD process 

has been noted (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Clift and Vandenbosch 1999).  There has 

been some research conducted on supplier participation in the customer’s NPD process 

that incorporates the stages of the process (Bello, Lohtia and Dant 1999), but the majority 

of research on user participation that considers the stage of the NPD process comes from 

intraorganizational projects, primarily information systems design (e.g., Barki and 

Hartwick 1994; Leonard-Barton and Sinha 1993).  In each of these cases, the researchers 

identified a number of activities within each stage of the information systems design 

process that were indicators of user participation.  The study informants then either 

evaluated the intensity of each of these activities on a Likert-type scale or simply 

indicated whether or not they had occurred.  In the former case, each activity represented 

a scale item, thus there was a scale for each stage (Bello, Lohtia and Dant 1999; Gruner 

and Homburg 2000).  These items were then summed to generate a participation scale 

(Heide and John 1990).  In the latter case, the multiple dichotomously measured

38

participation items are summed to develop a continuous participation measure (Barki and 

Hartwick 1994).

In all of the studies reviewed above, the key informants are participants in the 

NPD process from the developing organization.  Since these informants are very close to 

the NPD process, they are in a good position to evaluate their customer’s specific 

activities over the stages of the NPD process.  In the context of the current study, there 

was concern that the purchasing professional key informants are not able to effectively 

evaluate a number of different activities in a number of different stages of the NPD 

process (Atuahene-Gima 1995a).  Thus the measure of user participation in NPD 

employed in the current study focuses on NPD project-based communication by 

communication method for each stage of the NPD process.  Like the scale of user 

acceptance, the resulting scale is a formative indicator.  When there is an increase in one 

indicator of a formative scale, there is not necessarily an increase in any other.  In the 

context of the current scale of user participation, this means that participation in one stage 

of the NPD process does not necessarily correlate with participation in any other stage of 

the NPD process.

Formative measures have been used to operationalize participation in previous 

studies.  Gruen, Summers and Acito (2000) measured member participation in a 

professional association by using a number of  items describing participative activities 

such as reading the association’s trade magazine or attending meetings.  Spake and 

colleagues (1999) measured advertiser’s participation with ad agencies by having 

respondents indicate the frequency with which they participated in specific activities 

(e.g., meetings) with their agency.  Summed scales were used in both cases.

In the current study, the respondents indicated the frequency of specific types of 

project-related communication over the stages of the supplier’s NPD process.  The types 

of communication are face-to-face, phone, US mail, e-mail, and other electronic means. 

This is similar to the formative scale of collaborative communication used by Mohr, 

Fisher and Nevin (1996).  The descriptors for the 4 stages of the NPD process (Urban and 

Hauser 1993) were refined based on the interviews with purchasing professionals and the 

pretest of the entire survey instrument.  These stage descriptors and the scale root are 

presented in Table 4.  The response format was a seven-point semantic differential scale 

for each type of communication under each stage of the NPD process with the anchors: 

“None at all;” “A great deal.”  The items were summed to create the user participation 

scale.

Relationship Quality

Relationship quality is a broad concept describing the overall quality of the 

relationship between two firms or individuals—its essence is a belief in the integrity and 

reliability of the other party (Jap 2001b).  It has been measured with as few as 2 items 

(Johnson 1999) and as many as 73 items (Dorsch, Swanson and Kelley 1998).  Most 

researchers have conceptualized relationship quality as a higher-order construct 

composed of any number of first-order constructs.  But difficulty arises because there has 

not been agreement on just which first-order constructs to include.  Table 5 summarizes 

the various studies in the marketing literature that have attempted to operationalize 

relationship quality.  The table shows the study context and the first-order constructs used 

along with their corresponding number of items and reliability coefficients where 

available.  In looking at these previous operationalizations, some patterns do arise.  Of 

the sixteen studies summarized, all but one agrees that trust is a component of 

relationship quality.  Next is satisfaction with nine out of sixteen followed by continuity 

expectations and commitment with four and three studies respectively.  No other 

component of relationship quality is present in more than two studies.

Commitment concerns a party’s intention to continue a relationship and thus 

represents a pledge of relational continuity (Scheer and Stem 1992).  Thus the concept of 

commitment is closely related to that of continuity expectations as they both focus on the 

future of the relationship.  The current study conceptualizes relationship quality as a

43

second-order construct comprised of the first-order constructs satisfaction, trust, and 

continuity expectations.

The satisfaction and trust scales were taken from Crosby, Evans and Cowles 

(1990).  Both Crosby and colleagues and Dorsche, Swanson and Kelley (1998) used each 

of these scales in their operationalizations of relationship quality.  The satisfaction 

measure is a three-item, seven-level semantic differential scale with the root “Our firm is

_______ with/toward this vendor.”  The anchors are: “Satisfied—Dissatisfied;”

“Pleased—Displeased;” and “Favorable—Unfavorable.”  Both previous studies using this 

satisfaction measure achieved a reliability (coefficient alpha) of 0.99.

Because both of the studies cited above addressed interpersonal trust, the trust 

scale items were modified based on Doney and Cannon (1997) to reflect a firm-level 

conceptualization.  The reliability (coefficient alpha) achieved in these previous studies 

ranged from 0.89 to 0.94.  The continuity expectations scale was taken from Kumar, 

Scheer and Steenkamp (1995) who used it in their operationalization of relationship 

quality.  Though they did not report individual reliabilities (coefficient alphas) for their 

seven first-order factors, they did state that they ranged between 0.67 and 0.90.  The 

response format for both the trust and continuity expectations scales was a seven-point 

Likert-type scale with the anchors: “Strongly agree;” “Strongly disagree.”

The final relationship quality measure was constructed by averaging the three 

separate elements (equally weighted) (Noordewier, John and Nevin 1990).  See Table 6 

for the individual items for both the trust and continuity expectations scales.

SCALES OF TRUST AND CONTINUITY EXPECTATIONS

Rate the extent to which you agree with each statement as it applies to the relationship your firm 
has with the vendor firm:

Trust in vendor firm:

•  This supplier can be relied on to keep promises it makes to our firm.

•  This supplier is trustworthy.

•  We believe the information that this supplier provides us.

•  This supplier is genuinely concerned that our business succeeds.

•  When making important decisions, this supplier considers our welfare as well  as its own.

•  We trust this supplier to keep our best interests in mind.

•  There are times when we find this supplier to be a bit insincere, [reverse  coded]

•  We find it necessary to be cautious when dealing with this supplier, [reverse coded]

Continuity expectations with vendor firm:

•  We expect our relationship with this supplier to continue for a long time

•  Renewal of our relationship with this supplier is virtually automatic.

• 

It is unlikely that our firm will still be doing business with this supplier in 2 years, [reverse 
coded]

Product Innovativeness

The vast majority of measures of product innovativeness reviewed for the current 

study are categorical scales derived from Booz, Allen and Hamilton’s (1982) taxonomy 

of new product types (e.g., Kleinschmidt and Cooper 1991; Kotabe and Swan 1995; Sethi

2000).  In addition, the vast majority of conceptualizations were from the perspective of 

the developing firm key informant and included items tapping the newness of the product 

to the developing firm (e.g., Olson, Walker and Ruekert 1995).  Since the current study 

uses a customer key informant, product innovativeness is defined as newness to the 

customer.  Only one study was identified that used a continuous, multi-item measure of 

product innovativeness from the customer’s perspective (Atuahene-Gima 1995b).  This 

measure was used after modifying the item wording to apply to a customer informant 

since Atuahene-Gima used a developing firm informant.  He achieved a reliability 

(coefficient alpha) of 0.78 in that context.  The response format was a seven-point Likert- 

type scale with the anchors: “Strongly agree;” “Strongly disagree.”  These items are 

presented in Table 7.

Product Criticality

Product criticality refers to how important the new product or component is to the 

purchasing firm.  Previous operationalizations of this construct have been tailored to a 

specific category of new product such as entering goods (Bello, Lohtia and Dant 1999). 

Since the current study requires a non-specific measure of criticality, a scale of supply 

importance from Cannon and Perreault (1999) was used.  Like the current study, these 

researchers also employed purchasing professional key informants.  The root for this 

seven-level semantic differential scale is “Compared to other purchases that your firm 

makes, this product is:” and the anchors are: “Important—unimportant;” “Nonessential— 

essential;” “High priority—low priority;” and “Insignificant—significant.”  The 

reliability (coefficient alpha) achieved by Cannon and Perreault (1999) was 0.85.

Control Variables

Three measures were identified that represent potentially influential variables 

outside the main focus of the study.  Two of these control variable have been shown to 

play an important role in the context of channel relationships.  The first variable is history 

effects or relationship length which relates to the ability of the parties to align their 

interests and impacts the overall assessment of the relationship (Heide and John 1990). 

New product acceptance is considered more likely in a long-term relationship.  This 

variable was measured by the time period over which the purchasing firm has been 

purchasing from the supplier.  The second control variable was the availability of 

alternative suppliers for the particular product application— vendor scarcity (Bello,

Lohtia and Dant 1999).  Few supply alternatives may be a source of uncertainty and 

dependence for the buying firm (Cannon and Perreault 1999).  If there are relatively few

47

alternative suppliers available for a particular new product application, the likelihood of 

acceptance of any one supplier’s new product is increased.  The scale for this measure 

was adapted from Bello, Lohtia, and Dant (1999) who achieved a reliability (coefficient 

alpha) of 0.85.  The response format was a seven-point Likert-type scale with the 

anchors: “Strongly agree;” “Strongly disagree.”  The items are presented in Table 8.

TABLE 8 

SCALE OF VENDOR SCARCITY

Rate the extent to which you agree with each statement as it applies to the supply situation for the 
new product?

•  There were few potential suppliers from whom we could have sourced this item.

•  There were hardly any other suppliers who were qualified to supply this item.

•  We had limited choices among alternative suppliers who could have supplied this item.

•  There was very little competition among suppliers to supply this item.

The third control variable is a primary discriminator of NPD success (Montoya- 

Weiss and Calantone 1994; Henard and Szymanski 2001 )-product advantage.  It reflects 

the relative advantage of the new product over competitive offerings in the marketplace. 

The scale for this construct is based on the product competitive advantage scale used by 

Song and Parry (1997) who achieved a reliability (coefficient alpha) of 0.89.  One item 

was reworded to incorporate the concept of lower cost as an aspect of product advantage.

TABLE 9

SCALE OF PRODUCT ADVANTAGE

Rate the extent to which you agree with each statement as it applies to the new product?

•  This item was clearly superior to competing items in terms of meeting our needs.

•  This item permitted us to do a job or do something we could not presently do with what was 

available.

•  This item was higher quality than competing items—tighter specifications, stronger, lasted 

longer, or more reliable.

•  This item had superior technical performance relative to competing items.

•  This item had a lower cost relative to competing products.

Data Analysis

This study addresses the following research question:  How does the level of 

participation of an industrial customer (user) in a supplier’s NPD process impact the 

likelihood of that participant adopting the new product from the supplier?  It also seeks to 

investigate the direct effects of relationship quality and product innovativeness on new 

product acceptance as well as the moderating effects of relationship quality, 

innovativeness, and product criticality on the relationship between user participation and 

user acceptance.

49

To meet these objectives, a model and hypotheses have been presented that 

propose specific relationships between the predictor variables user participation in NPD, 

relationship quality, product characteristics, and the criterion variable, new product 

acceptance.

In the next chapter, the reliability of the scales measuring the model constructs is 

assessed.  In addition, the hypotheses based upon the theoretical model are investigated 

through the use of moderated multiple regression which allows for the examination of the 

influence of the independent variables on new product acceptance by customers.  In 

addition, the moderating effects of relationship quality, product criticality, and product 

innovativeness on user participation are evaluated while controlling for the length of the 

relationship with the supplier, the availability of alternative sources of supply, and the 

superiority of the product.

CHAPTER IV

RESEARCH FINDINGS

This chapter presents the empirical results for the hypothesized relationships in 

the conceptual model.  These findings are presented in three sections.  The first section 

presents descriptive statistics for the data.  An assessment of the reliability of the model 

constructs is presented in the second section.  Finally, hypothesis testing is presented in 

the third section.

Descriptive Statistics

Preliminary regression analysis of the data indicated that outlier observations may 

have unduly influenced the estimated coefficients.  Following an analysis of studentized 

deleted residuals, centered leverage values, standardized dfbetas and partial regression 

plots, a total of four cases were identified as outliers (Cook and Weisberg,  1982).  Further 

examination of the actual survey instruments returned by respondents supported their 

removal from the data set.  In addition, one respondent indicated that they did not 

participate at all in their supplier’s new product development process.  Since the 

instructions asked respondents to refer to their “most recent experience participating in 

the development of a new offering from a supplier”, that observation was also deleted. 

The analyses that follow reflect the deletion of these five observations which resulted in a 

final sample size of 164.

User Acceptance of New Product

The composite score for user acceptance of new product is the mean of the scores 

for its four dimensions.  Since two of the four items were recorded as percentages 

between zero and one hundred, these were rescaled to a seven-point scale before 

averaging.  Table 10 summarizes the number of items, mean, standard deviation (s.d.), 

range, minimum, and maximum for all of the study constructs.  The dispersion in the 

study variables indicates that enough variation exists to test the hypothesized 

relationships in the study model.  The mean for user acceptance of new product is more 

than one standard deviation higher than the scale midpoint.  This and the fact that the 

minimum is  1.62 indicate that the products in the study had a relatively high level of 

acceptance.

Predictor Variables

Summary statistics for the predictor variables in the model are also presented in 

Table  10.  Each variable is calculated as the mean summate of its individual items.  Two 

variables have values greater than one standard deviation above the scale midpoint.

These means for both relationship quality and product criticality indicate a high level of 

these characteristics in the study.  Since the survey instrument stipulated some level of 

participation in the supplier NPD process, this could account for higher relationship 

quality.  The mean for product criticality exceeds the midpoint by more than two standard 

deviations, thus products in the study were generally deemed very important to the 

customer companies.

Control Variables

Table  10 also presents the summary statistics for the control variables in the 

study:  relationship length, vendor scarcity, and product advantage.  Each is calculated as 

the mean summate of its individual items.

Correlation Analysis

Table 11 presents the correlation matrix for all variables in the study.  In general, 

these correlations are supportive of the results reported later.

Scale Reliabilities

User Acceptance of New Product

User acceptance, the dependent variable of the theoretical model, was measured 

with a formative indicator and as such is not subject to validation techniques applied to 

reflective measures.  There are, though, a number of steps recommended for evaluating 

the construction of a formative index.  The following assessment is based upon the 

recommendations of Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer (2001).

The first issues of formative index construction are content and indicator 

specification.  For the user acceptance indicator, this study seeks to expand the typical 

dichotomous operationalization (accept/not accept) to include four separate indicators of

new product acceptance:  (1) the level of satisfaction with the new product; (2) the 

likelihood of future purchases of the new product; (3) the percent of total business for a 

particular product application given to the new product offering; and (4) the percent of 

total business that the purchasing firm would like to givd to the new product if they were 

unencumbered by any prior commitments to other suppliers.

The next issue in formative indicator construction is that of indicator collinearity. 

Unlike reflective scales, excessive collinearity in a formative scale is undesirable.  To 

analyze the issue, the four indicators were regressed on the relationship quality construct. 

Multicollinearity did not appear to be a problem as the highest variance inflation factor 

was 1.627, which is well below the common cut-off limit of 10 (c.f. Kleinbaum, Kupper, 

and Miller 1988).  See Table 12.

The final issue in formative indicator construction is external validity. 

Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer (2001) note that this issue in the context of formative 

indicators is not fully resolved.  They suggest that the researcher evaluate the correlation 

of the formative indicator to a global construct that “summarizes the essence of the 

construct that the index purports to measure (Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer 2001; p.

272).  In the case of the current study, there was no other global measure of new product 

acceptance available as one of the purposes was to broaden the concept of new product 

acceptance.

Predictor and Control Variables

With the exception of the user participation scale, all of the predictor variable 

scales in this study were taken from previous studies.  These data were factor analyzed 

and support for the a priori scales was found.  Table 13 presents the results of the 

principle component analysis with varimax rotation.  To assess the internal reliability of 

the scale items, coefficient alphas and item-to-total correlations were also calculated. 

These items are presented in the following sections.

User Participation.  Like the user acceptance dependent variable discussed above, 

user participation was measured with a formative indicator.  This scale consisted of a 

total of twenty items—five for each phase of the new product development process. 

Again, the recommendations of Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer (2001) were followed in 

construction of this index.

The first issues of formative index construction are content and indicator 

specification.  In establishing the domain of the user participation construct, 

communication between a customer and supplier new product developer was established 

as the means through which any type of participation must occur.  Thus, respondents 

were asked to evaluate the extent to which various types of communication were used 

between the supplier and customer specifically related to the development of a particular 

new product.  This included all forms of communication that could occur:  face-to-face, 

phone, postal/express mail, e-mail, and other electronic means.

The second issue of indicator collinearity was evaluated by regressing the 

formative indicator items against another study variable—in this case, user acceptance. 

Table  11 presents the variance inflation factor data for items in each stage of the  new 

product development process.  In this case, the highest variance inflation factor is 2.172 

which is well below the suggested cut-off point of ten noted previously.

The third issue of formative index construction is external validity.  In this case, 

one other global reflective measure of user participation was measured.  This was a scale 

of intensity of customer interaction (Gruner and Homburg, 2000).  The correlation 

between the formative measure of user participation and this global measure is 0.689 and 

is significant at the p < 0.01  level.  All of the above factors indicate that the formative 

operationalization of user participation in this study is a valid measure.

Relationship Quality.  Relationship quality was measured as a second-order 

construct consisting of the three first-order constructs of satisfaction, trust, and continuity 

expectations.  These items capture the broad concept of the overall relationship between 

the developing and customer firms.  As can be seen in factor analysis results in Table 11, 

the only crossloading greater than 0.4 was for a single item in the continuity expectations

construct.  Given that relationship quality is conceptualized as a single global measure of 

the relationship between firms, this crossloading is not of concern.  Table 15 presents the 

items, coefficient alpha, and item-to-total correlations for the three first-order constructs 

of relationship quality.  These indicate reliability of the existing scales.  Coefficient alpha 

for all fourteen items together in the relationship quality scale is .95

Product Innovativeness.  Product innovativeness was measured using an existing 

six-item scale which applied to the developing firm.  The scale was adapted to measure 

the newness of a product from the view of the customer firm.  The product 

innovativeness scale’s items, coefficient alpha, and item-to-total correlations from the 

current study are presented in Table 16.  The relatively high coefficient alpha and item-

Control Variables.  There were three control variables used in the present study. 

The first, relationship length, is a single-item measure not subject to validation 

procedures.  The other two variables are vendor scarcity and product advantage.  Vendor 

scarcity was measured with a four-item scale designed to capture the availability of 

alternative sources of supply for the specific new product application.  Product advantage 

was measured using a five-item scale adapted from an existing product competitive 

advantage construct.  The item that was modified to take new product cost into 

consideration had a very low item-to-total correlation of .05 (scale coefficient alpha of 

.71) and was dropped from the analysis.  Items, coefficient alpha, and item-to-total 

correlations from the current study for both vendor scarcity and product advantage are 

presented in Table 16.  The relatively high coefficient alpha and item-to-total correlations 

indicate reliability of the existing scale.

Hypotheses Testing

The tests of the six hypotheses presented in the theoretical model were conducted 

using moderated regression analysis according to Aiken and West (1991) and Irwin and 

McClelland (2001).  The significant interaction in the model was examined through 

simple slope analysis, a technique that overcomes the need to create subgroups from 

continuous independent variables (Aiken and West 1991).  All independent variables 

were mean-centered to minimize multicollinearity between the interaction terms and their 

constituent terms in the regression model (Aiken and West 1991).  The criterion variable 

for each of the hypotheses is user acceptance of the new product.  The results of the 

moderated regression analysis are presented in Table 18.  All variables were entered 

simultaneously.  The overall regression model is significant (F = 4.519,/? < .001) with an 

R2 indicating that 22.8% of the variation in user acceptance of the new product is 

explained by the predictor variables.

Hypothesis 1: User Participation

In reference to user participation, it was hypothesized that:

H I:  User participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process will be positively 
related to user acceptance of that new product.

65

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


This hypothesis postulates that the level of the user’s participation in their supplier’s new 

product development process will have a positive relationship to their acceptance of that 

new product from the supplier.  The multiple regression results presented in Table 18 

indicate that this hypothesis is not supported (B = -.033; t = -.466; p = .642).

Hypothesis 2: Relationship Quality

In reference to relationship quality, it was hypothesized that:

H2:  The quality of the relationship between the user and the supplier firm will be 
positively related to the user’s acceptance of a new product offering by the 
supplier.

This hypothesis postulates that the quality of the relationship between the user and 

supplier will have a positive relationship with the user’s acceptance of a new product 

from the supplier.  The multiple regression results indicate a high level of support for this 

hypothesis (B = .456; t= 5.514;p < .001).

Hypothesis 3: Relationship Quality as Moderator

In reference to relationship quality as a moderator, it was hypothesized that:

H3:  The greater the relationship quality between the user and the supplier firms, 
the greater the positive relationship between user participation in a supplier’s 
specific NPD process and user acceptance of that new product.

This hypothesis postulates that a higher quality relationship between the user and supplier

will result in a stronger positive relationship between the user’s participation in the

supplier’s new product development process and the user’s acceptance the supplier’s new

product.  The regression analysis supports a moderator effect, but the direction of the

effect is opposite from that hypothesized (B = -.148; t = -1.998; p  = .048).  As

recommended by Aiken and West (1991), simple slope analysis was conducted to better 

understand the nature of this interaction.  This technique overcomes the need to create 

subgroups from continuous independent variables.  Simple slope analysis involves 

creating one low (i.e., one standard deviation below the mean), one moderate (i.e., mean), 

and one high (i.e., one standard deviation above the mean) conditional value of the 

moderator variable.  After substituting the values of relevant unstandardized regression 

coefficients from the trimmed regression model, the equation is solved for the slope of 

the independent variable (user participation) at the different levels of the moderator 

(relationship quality).  The simple slopes at low, moderate, and high levels of relationship 

quality were 0.121, -0.028, and -0.177 respectively.  These values indicate that at low 

levels of relationship quality, there is a slight positive relationship between user 

participation and that user’s acceptance of the new product.  But as the level of 

relationship quality increases, that positive relationship becomes a negative relationship.

Hypothesis 4: Product Innovativeness

In reference to product innovativeness, it was hypothesized that:

H4:  The innovativeness of the new product offering will be positively related to
the user’s acceptance of that new product offering by the supplier.

This hypothesis postulates that the innovativeness of the new product offering from the 

supplier will have a positive relationship with the user’s acceptance of a new product 

from the supplier.  The regression analysis does not support this hypothesis (B = .016; t = 

.215; p = .830).

67

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


Hypothesis 5: Innovativeness as Moderator

In reference to innovativeness as a moderator, it was hypothesized that:

H5:  The greater the innovativeness of the new product offering, the greater the 
positive relationship between user participation in a supplier’s specific NPD 
process and user acceptance of that new product.

This hypothesis postulates that a higher level of product innovativeness will result in a

stronger positive relationship between the user’s participation in the supplier’s new

product development process and the user’s acceptance the supplier’s new product.  The

hypothesis is not supported by the regression analysis (B = -.026; t — -.449; p = .654).

Hypothesis 6: Product Criticality as Moderator

In reference to product criticality as a moderator, it was hypothesized that:

H6:  The greater the product criticality, the greater the positive relationship 
between user participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process and user 
acceptance of that new product.

This hypothesis postulates that a higher level of product criticality will result in a stronger

positive relationship between the user’s participation in the supplier’s new product

development process and the user’s acceptance the supplier’s new product.  The

regression analysis does not support the hypothesis (B = .124; t = 1.527; p = .129).

Summary of Research Findings

The purpose of this study was to evaluate determinants of user acceptance of new 

products.  The empirical results offer limited support for the research hypotheses and 

some unexpected findings.  Table 19 presents the moderated regression analysis for a 

trimmed model.  Figure 2 presents the model and significant relationships.

As shown in these results, the hypothesis with respect to the main effect of 

relationship quality was supported.  While there was a significant interaction of 

relationship quality with user participation, the direction was opposite of that 

hypothesized.  In addition, a main effect of product criticality on user acceptance was 

discovered that was not expected.  The findings are discussed in detail in the following 

chapter.

CHAPTER V

DISCUSSION

The discussion of this study is presented in five parts:  First, the supporting 

literature is reviewed.  This is followed by a discussion of the research findings.  Third, 

the implications for theory and practice are developed.  Fourth, the limitations of the 

study are investigated.  Finally, recommendations for future research are presented.

Overview of Supporting Literature

The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of user participation in 

the new product development (NPD) process of their supplier on the likelihood of the 

user accepting the supplier’s new product.  It also investigated the effects of relational 

and product characteristics on user acceptance.

User Participation

Both generalist and specialist studies have established that a key to new product 

success is meeting customer expectations (Clark and Fujimoto  1990; Montoya-Weiss and 

Calantone 1994).  A recent meta-analysis by Henard and Szymanski (2001) found that 

one of the dominant drivers of new product performance is that the product meet 

customer needs.  An obvious way to understand and meet customer needs is to allow 

them to participate in the new product development process.

Relationship Quality

Research on dyadic relationships in industrial channels has focused on the 

relational benefits that accrue to the customer firm (e.g., Lusch and Brown 1996; 

Noordewier, John and Nevin 1990).  Most research investigating the benefits of channel 

relationships that accrue to the supplier firm come from the sales management literature 

and show positive benefits (e.g., Biong and Slenes  1996; Leuthesser 1997).  Research 

investigating the effect of relationships on new product success have taken a broad view 

of relationships that entails collaboration on NPD.  This confounds the two key predictor 

variables of the current study—user participation in a specific NPD project and the global 

relationship quality between the user and supplier firm.  No previous research was found 

that isolates these two related factors.

Product Characteristics

The majority of research on the contribution of product innovativeness to new 

product success has found a positive relationship, but the evidence is mixed (Henard and 

Szymanski 2001).  There is evidence that the greater information flows necessary during 

the development of an innovative product make collaboration between groups involved in 

the development more important (Olson, Walker and Ruekert 1995).  Thus a more 

innovative product should increase the positive relationship between user participation 

and user acceptance.  A similar argument is made for the moderating effect of product 

criticality.  Athaide and Stump found that collaboration between buyer and seller during 

successful NPD was more common with customized (i.e., critical) products.

Summary of Findings

There were three primary research objectives for this study.  The first was to 

determine how the level of user participation by an industrial customer in a supplier’s 

NPD process affects the likelihood of that participant accepting the new product from the 

supplier.  The second objective was to evaluate the direct and moderating effects of 

relationship quality on new product acceptance.  The third was to evaluate the direct and 

moderating effects of the product characteristics innovativeness and criticality on new 

product acceptance.

To accomplish these objectives, hypotheses were formulated to test each of the 

relationships.  In addition, new formative scales were developed for user participation 

and user acceptance.  These scales were developed and validated in accordance with the 

recommendations of Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer (2001).  All other scales in the 

study were identified from previous research.  These were subjected to reliability testing 

and factor analysis prior to hypotheses testing and support for each of the scales was 

found.  This minimized the likelihood of misinterpretation of the hypotheses testing due 

to invalid or unreliable measures.

A questionnaire containing measures of user participation, user acceptance, 

relationship quality, product innovativeness, product criticality as well as 3 control 

variables was mailed to 2000 members of the National Association of Purchasing 

Management in 2 waves.  This was followed by a phone and fax effort directed at 

nonrespondents.  A final total of  164 surveys were used in the data analysis.

Hypothesis 1  suggested that a user’s participation in the NPD process for a 

particular new product and their acceptance of that new product will be positively

73

associated.  Support was not found for this relationship.  This suggests that user 

participation in a supplier’s specific NPD process is not positively related to the user’s 

acceptance of that new product.  Such a non-intuitive finding may be partially explained 

by the recent meta-analysis of Henard and Szymanski (2001).  They found that customer 

input was a non-significant driver of new product success.  But they also found that 

manager’s perceptions o f product meeting customer needs was a dominant driver of new 

product success.  Combined with the mixed results of other research on customer 

participation in NPD cited earlier, all of these findings indicate that the process by which 

new product developers ensure that new products meet customer needs is not well 

understood.

Hypothesis 2 stated that the quality of the relationship between the user and the 

supplier firm will be positively related to the user’s acceptance of the new product 

offering by the supplier.  This is the strongest and most significant relationship in the 

study.  It implies that suppliers who pursue high quality relationships with their 

customers are more likely to have those suppliers accept their new product offerings.

Hypothesis 3 investigated the moderating effect of relationship quality on the 

relationship between user participation in the NPD process and user acceptance of the 

new product.  The hypothesis suggested that when there is a higher quality relationship 

between user and supplier, there will be a stronger relationship between user participation 

and user acceptance.  An opposite relationship was found, though the magnitude of the 

effect was relatively small.  The findings suggest that when there is a lower quality 

relationship between user and supplier, there is a positive effect on the relationship 

between user participation and user acceptance.  But when relationship quality increases,

74

this turns into a negative effect on the relationship between user participation and user 

acceptance.  An explanation could be that at low levels of relationship quality, there is a 

positive association between user participation and user acceptance because the benefits 

of the participation offset any negative effect from the low relationship quality.  This 

would be particularly true during the beginning stages of a relationship when the low 

quality is due to a lack of familiarity.  At high levels of relationship quality, the negative 

association between participation and acceptance could be due to the old adage that 

familiarity breeds contempt.  There is some support for this contention.  A national 

survey found that less face-to-face contact an organization had with their customers, the 

happier the customers were (Smith 1996).  Thus if the relationship quality is already high, 

the added exposure of  the user to the supplier during development could reduce their 

likelihood of accepting the new product.  Another possible explanation for the negative 

relationship between participation and acceptance is that when relationship quality is 

high, the customer might not want to be viewed as “being in bed” with the supplier and 

thus is less likely to accept the new product.

According to hypothesis 4, innovativeness of the new product offering will be 

positively related to the user’s acceptance of that new product.  Support was not found for 

this hypothesis.  There are two possible explanations for this finding.  First, virtually all 

of the previous studies indicating a positive relationship between innovativeness and new 

product performance were based on the developer’s perceptions of both product 

innovativeness and new product success.  The current study measures innovativeness and 

new product acceptance from the perspective or the new product user.  Thus from the 

new product user’s perspective, innovativeness may not have any impact on their

acceptance of the new product.  Second, there has been some limited support in the past 

for a curvilinear relationship between innovativeness and new product success (Cooper 

and Kleinschmidt 1991).

Hypotheses 5 and 6 investigated the moderating effect of product innovativeness 

and product criticality respectively on the relationship between user participation in the 

NPD process and user acceptance of the new product.  Neither of these hypotheses was 

supported.  This indicates that these two product characteristics do not affect the 

relationship between user participation and user acceptance.

There was one unexpected finding.  In order to properly evaluate the moderating 

effect of product criticality on the association between user participation and user 

acceptance, each component of the product term had to be included (Irwin and 

McClelland 2001).  The regression results showed a significant positive relationship 

between product criticality and user acceptance of the new product.  When originally 

formulating hypotheses, the potential for this relationship was not considered because 

criticality should not vary between different suppliers’ offerings for the same product 

application and thus should not affect acceptance.  It reflects only the relative importance 

of the product to the purchasing firm.  But there does appear to be a positive effect of 

criticality on user acceptance.  This could be because on critical items, customers may be 

more likely to solicit from a smaller group of more reliable suppliers thus increasing the 

probability of any one supplier’s new product being accepted.  There is some support for 

this in that when vendor scarcity is controlled for in the full model, the beta and 

significance for the criticality (B = .193; p = .055) are less strong than when vendor 

scarcity is not controlled for in the trimmed model (B = A99,p = .032).

Implications

The findings from this study make contributions to the fields of marketing, 

industrial channel relationships, and new product development in both theory and 

practice.  These contributions are discussed in the following sections.

Theoretical Implications

From a theoretical perspective, the present study:

1.  Extends and links existing research in the areas of channel relationships, new 

product development,-and sales management.

2.  Introduces and operationalizes the formative constructs user participation in 

NPD and user acceptance of new product.

3.  Empirically examines the conceptualized relationships in the theoretical 

model of user participation in NPD from the customer’s perspective.

Relationship quality is a global measure of the quality of a channel relationship. 

The effect of relationship quality has been ignored as a determinant of new product 

acceptance in the literature.  This study extends the research in NPD and integrates it with 

that of channel relationships.  And since the study found a strong relationship between 

relationship quality and new product acceptance, there are implications for sales 

management.  Salespeople are boundary-spanners who contribute greatly to the quality of 

the relationship with their customers (Weitz and Bradford 1999; Jap 2001a).

The second theoretical implication is the new formative measures of user 

participation and user acceptance of new product.  The measure of user participation 

expands the concept of  customer participation to include all possible means of 

communication during the NPD process.  The measure of user acceptance brings the

customer’s perspective to the evaluation of new product success.  Most studies have 

measured new product success based only upon managers’ perceptions or financial 

outcomes in the developing organization.  The new measure introduced in this study 

considers 4 separate aspects of user acceptance from the customer’s perspective:  (1) the 

level of satisfaction with the new product; (2) the likelihood of future purchases of the 

new product; (3) the percent of total business for a particular product application given to 

the new product offering; and (4) the percent of total business that the purchasing firm 

would like to give to the new product if they were unencumbered by any prior 

commitments to other suppliers.

The final theoretical implication relates to the empirical investigation of the 

relationships in the conceptual model.  The development and testing of this model adds to 

and helps integrate the theoretical foundations of industrial channel relationship research 

with that of new product development.

Managerial Implications

From a managerial perspective, the present study provides guidance for firms 

engaged in NPD to help them increase acceptance of their new products by users.  By far, 

the most significant result is the positive association between relationship quality and 

user acceptance of a new product.  Thus it is important for firms engaged in new product 

development to foster good relationships with their customers.  This has major 

implications for sales management.

A smaller effect was found that indicates developing firms will gamer greater new 

product acceptance through user participation in the NPD process when the quality of 

their relationship is low, but not as much when the quality of the relationship is high.

This means that when suppliers are beginning a relationship or have not built a strong 

relationship with a customer, they should pursue a high level of customer participation in 

their NPD process.  But when a supplier already has a good relationship with their 

customer, bringing that customer into the NPD process may lessen the likelihood of their 

new product being accepted.  This has major implications for NPD managers.

Finally, firms involved in new product development should work toward 

determining how critical specific new product applications are to their customer.  Results 

of the study indicate that their new products are more likely to be accepted when they are 

critical to the user.

Limitations

There are a number of limitations with respect to this study.  The first is the 

relatively low overall response rate of 9.6%.  Even though calculations from the 

phone/fax follow-up indicate the actual effective response rate may be as high as 50%, 

generalizability of the study findings may be limited.  Also limiting generalizability may 

be that the study drew from only three specific SIC codes.  But these codes represent a 

wide variety of products and industries (Heide and John 1990).

Time and resource constraints dictated the use of a single key informant for each 

new product development project.  This may have presented problems in that some of the 

purchasing professionals surveyed were not fully informed on all of the study variables 

with respect to a single NPD project.  In addition, the study results are subject to common 

method variance.

Another limitation of the study is the external validity of the user acceptance 

scale.  Due to the lack of a global indicator of user acceptance, the scale was unable to be 

correlated as recommended by Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer (2001).

As this was a cross-sectional study, no causal ordering of the variables in the 

model was investigated.  Though there was theoretical justification for the relationships 

in the conceptual model, others are possible.  For example, relationship quality could be 

an antecedent of user participation or vice versa.  This indicates that different 

methodologies could be used to examine the theoretical relationships.

Future Research

The findings of the current study provide a basis for future research.  First, as 

mentioned above, different methods could be used.  Longitudinal research would aid in 

identifying causal relationships and mediating effects as would alternative statistical 

analyses such as path analysis or structural equation modeling.

Second, the whole issue of customer participation and customer knowledge in the 

NPD process needs to be delineated.  This study found no association between user 

participation in an NPD project and the user’s acceptance of the new product.  The recent 

meta-analysis of Henard and Szymanski (2001) found that customer input was a non­

significant driver of new product success.  But the same study found that managers’ 

perceptions of a new product meeting customer needs was a dominant driver of new 

product success.  There is still much to be learned regarding how best to both determine 

and incorporate customer knowledge into the NPD process as well as its effects on new

product success.  Another related issue is when participation in the NPD process (which 

stage) is most effective in increasing acceptance.

Third, the most significant finding of the study—the association of relationship 

quality with new product acceptance—deserves further research.  This is the first known 

finding connecting these two important concepts.

Finally, the reasons underlying the significance of product criticality as a 

determinant of new product acceptance could be further investigated.

Phone/Fax Follow-Up Phone Script and Spreadsheet Coding

My name is Scott Cragin and I'm currently a doctoral candidate at Oklahoma State

Hi, 
University...  Toward the end of last year, you probably received a survey or two from me 
regarding customer involvement in supplier NPD...  Unfortunately, my response rate wasn’t 
what the pilot study predicted and in order to have a large enough sample to complete my 
dissertation,  I  need some additional participants...  Now the survey is very short—I would fax 
to you—and it may or may not even apply to you...  Can you tell me if you've been offered a 
new or improved item from a supplier recently where your firm participated to some degree in 
the supplier’s NPD process for that'new item—anywhere from idea generation to product 
launch?...
Yes  Would you  be willing to complete my survey if I fax it to you?  It shouldn't take more 
than  10 minutes to complete and it would really help me out.  It's completely voluntary and 
anonymous...?

Yes  ->  Thank you very much.  Let me double-check your fax#...  [End—fax survey]

No ->  I understand.  Do you mind if I ask you just a couple o f questions to help me better 
understand nonrespondents?

Yes  ->  (ask questions below)
No ->  I understand.  Have a nice day.

1.  First, approximately how many employees are there in your business unit?...

2.  What are the approximate annual sales of your business unit?

1-<$250,000 
4-$10-100 million  5~>$100 million

2-$250K-$1  million 

3—$1-10 million

Other possible responses (see Dissertation Call Status below), e.g., “So would you say that 
you haven't been offered a new or improved item recently or that you  have, but just did not 
participate in the supplier’s development process?”

Dissertation Call Status (coding for spreadsheet)

C = call cannot be completed as dialed/disconnected/wrong #
Number = unsuccessful attempts to contact (not in, line busy (B),  no answer (NA))
Date = date survey faxed; assumes that offered  NP with some level of participation
L = no longer with company
NO = not offered a new product recently
NP = offered  new product, but didn't participate to any degree
NA = not applicable

d = don’t do that type of purchasing/no longer in purchasing 
r = retired
Others, e.g., did participate, but not recently or product didn’t make it to market or it is still 

in development 

U = unwilling to participate 

t = no time
r = rude or simply decline
