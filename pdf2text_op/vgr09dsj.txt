ABSTRACT

Applying the behavioral agency model developed by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia
(1998), this article analyzes human resource factors that induce supply chain exec-
utives (SCEs) to make decisions that foster or hinder supply chain integration. We
examine two internal sources (compensation and employment risk) and one external
source (environmental volatility) of risk bearing that can make SCEs more reluctant
to make the decision to promote supply chain integration. We argue and empirically
conﬁrm the notion that an employment and compensation system that increases SCE
risk bearing reduces the SCE’s willingness to make risky decisions and thus discour-
ages supply chain integration. We also reveal that this negative relationship becomes
stronger under conditions of high environmental volatility. In addressing the “so what?”
question, we found empirical support for the hypothesis that supply chain integration
positively inﬂuences operational performance. Even though this decision has a positive
value for the ﬁrm, we showed that SCEs discourage supply chain integration when they
face higher risk bearing. Hypotheses are tested using a combination of primary survey
data and archival measures in a sample of 133 Spanish ﬁrms.

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

INTRODUCTION

Research on strategic supply chain management has viewed supply chains not
only as production and distribution mechanisms but also as important competitive
weapons (Hult, Ketchen, & Nichols, 2002; Hult, Ketchen, & Slater, 2004). Firms
such as Toyota, Inditex, and Dell have used the collective capabilities of their
supply chains rather than solely their individual capabilities to succeed in an
increasingly competitive market. Firms recognize that they do not possess the full
range of capabilities to design, produce, and deliver the products and services
that demanding markets require or to compete globally (Gomes-Casseres, 1994).
They thus need to develop strategic partnerships with other supply chain members
(Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996; Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000; Mentzer, Min, &
Zacharia, 2000; Kotabe, Martin, & Domoto, 2003; Wisner, 2003) with the objective
of accessing new resources and achieving an integrated coordination that allows
them to respond more efﬁciently and more quickly to current market needs.

However, supply chain partnerships may be inherently risky. Knowledge may
spill over to potential competitors (Bleeke & Ernst, 1995; Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gu-
lati & Gargiulo, 1999; Kale, Singh, & Perlmutter, 2000; Myers & Cheung, 2008),
and partnership-speciﬁc investments may be lost through poor managerial deci-
sions (Williamson, 1985; Osborn & Hagedoorn, 1997; Jap, 1999). Opportunism
by a partner may be difﬁcult to detect because of information asymmetries and
this self-serving behavior could erode the ﬁrm’s competitive position (Eisenhardt,
1989). Supply chain executives (SCEs) aware of the potentially high, but uncertain
beneﬁts derived from supply chain partnerships might be less willing to engage in
collaborative initiatives with supply chain partners if they believe that by doing so
their compensation and employment security would be at risk.

There is a large body of literature suggesting that when the executive feels
vulnerable in terms of potential losses to personal income and/or the possibility of
dismissal as a result of managerial decisions, they take a more conservative path
and avoid perilous choices that they believe augment personal risk bearing (e.g.,
Gray & Cannella, 1997; Bloom & Milkovich, 1998). Environmental uncertainty
also magniﬁes executives’ vulnerability as it severely limits how much control they
can exert over performance outcomes resulting from a particular choice (Miller,
Wiseman, & Gomez-Mejia, 2002). This literature has almost exclusively focused
on the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) with the ﬁrm as the unit of analysis. In
this article, we take a different approach and focus on how SCEs respond to these
internal and external risks in promoting or hindering supply chain integration,
which we argue is a risky endeavour despite its potential beneﬁts.

This study makes three main contributions to the decision-making literature
and supply chain research in particular. First, previous research on executive risk
bearing and risk taking has focused almost exclusively on the CEO (e.g., Tosi &
Gomez-Mejia, 1989; Wiseman & Bromiley, 1996; Gray & Cannella, 1997; Tosi,
Werner, Katz, & Gomez-Mejia, 2000; Larraza-Kintana, Wiseman, Gomez-Mejia,
& Welbourne, 2007; Devers, McNamara, Wiseman, & Arrfelt, 2008) and more
recently on the Chief Information Ofﬁce (CIO) (Preston, Chen, & Leidner, 2008).
However, the SCE also plays a pivotal role in how much risk is taken by the ﬁrm to
ensure its continued competitiveness and success (Mangan & Christopher, 2005).

We develop a multidisciplinary research framework that analyzes how a ﬁrm’s
employment and compensation system inﬂuences its SCE’s decision to foster
or limit supply chain integration. This is a unique study that combines research
streams from behavioral decision making and supply chain management, and uses
matched-pair survey data as well as archival measures to test hypotheses. Second,
we extend the behavioral agency model (BAM) (Wiseman & Gomez-Mejia, 1998)
by examining the moderating role of environmental risk in the relationship between
risk bearing and risk taking, which has not been analyzed in prior research. Our
model combines elements of agency theory with behavioral views of decision
making under uncertainty to examine how compensation and employment risk
inﬂuences SCE choices when the outcomes of these choices may be at least partially
beyond the executive’s control (when environmental uncertainty is high). Lastly,
previous research on supply chain integration has mainly stressed the importance
of trust, commitment, information technologies, and information sharing. Within
this list of factors that enable supply chain integration, we examine the distinct and
additive impact of managerial incentives as the key element in the SCE’s decision
to foster this risky choice.

In summary, this study attempts to develop guidelines for designing an em-
ployment and compensation system for the SCE in order to encourage supply chain
integration through the development of supply chain partnerships. We argue and
ﬁnd empirical support for the notion that greater compensation and employment
risk for the SCE is negatively associated with supply chain integration, and that
this negative relation becomes stronger under conditions of high environmental
uncertainty. Furthermore, we hypothesize and our results conﬁrm that as supply
chain integration declines so does performance.

We organize the article into ﬁve sections. In the next section, we discuss the
conceptual framework and formulate the hypotheses. First, we present the behav-
ioral agency framework, leading to the hypotheses concerning how SCE compen-
sation (Hypothesis 1) and employment (Hypothesis 2) risk negatively inﬂuencing
supply chain integration and the moderating role played by environmental risk
(Hypothesis 3a and b) in this process. Second, we deal with the “so what” ques-
tion by discussing how supply chain integration affects operational performance
(Hypothesis 4). In the third section, we describe the methodology used to test
the hypotheses, which combines both archival and primary survey measures in a
sample of 133 Spanish ﬁrms. In the fourth section, we present the results conﬁrm-
ing the hypotheses. In the ﬁfth and last section, we conclude with a discussion
of theoretical and practical implications of the ﬁndings and an agenda for future
research.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES

To support our arguments, we developed a theoretical framework that uses the BAM
of managerial risk taking (Wiseman & Gomez-Mejia, 1998). As discussed below,
this theory suggests that decision makers are loss-averse when facing uncertain
outcomes that threaten their personal wealth resulting from particular choices (such
as entering supply chain partnerships).

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

Behavioral Agency Model (BAM)
The BAM developed by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia (1998) integrates elements
of agency theory and behavioral views of corporate governance decision making
under conditions of uncertainty in order to develop a model of managerial risk
taking. Behavioral models of decisions (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992) explain how risk
preference changes with the framing of problems. The BAM predicts that decision
makers will avoid risk when selecting among positively framed problems and seek
risk when selecting among identical but negatively framed prospects (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979).

Risk bearing under the BAM is deﬁned as the potential reduction in wealth
(either in the form of income and/or employment loss) for the decision maker when
confronted with a particular choice. The potential loss of compensation implies
a threat to the person’s basic standard of living. Furthermore, “since termination
results in the complete loss of all current income and puts in serious jeopardy
future income, employment risk represents the ultimate threat to an agent’s wealth”
(Larraza-Kintana et al., 2007). Risk bearing makes the executive more vulnerable
to the negative consequences (such as foregone pay or dismissal) of taking risks
(such as pursuing supply chain integration) if the results of such choices are poor
or disappointing. This risk bearing is compounded when the ability of the decision
maker to inﬂuence or control outcomes resulting from a decision decreases, as is
the case in highly volatile environments (Miller et al., 2002).

Simply put, according to the BAM any action that threatens base pay or ad-
justments to it or reduces employment security (e.g., receiving a poor performance
evaluation, unmet targets) greatly increases risk bearing and thus the reluctance
of the decision maker to make risky choices. This tendency is likely to be present
no matter how potentially beneﬁcial the risky decision might be. In our particular
context, the BAM suggests that the SCE is loss averse and that risk bearing occurs
when there is a threat to his or her compensation and employment security if he
or she were to pursue high-risk/high-return alternatives (such as choices related to
supply chain integration). In other words, the SCE may perceive the integration
choice as beneﬁcial to the ﬁrm; yet, avoid that choice if it implies a private threat
to his/her wealth. Next, we explain why supply chain integration represents a risky
choice followed by a discussion of the factors that would dissuade the SCE from
making this choice.

Integrated supply chains as a risky choice
Integrated supply chains are those whose members synchronize their processes
and share relevant, updated information hoping to improve their performance.
Herein, integrated supply chain partners combine resources in a unique way and
may gain an advantage over competing ﬁrms that are unable or unwilling to do
so. Together they generate and own relational proﬁts that cannot be created by
either ﬁrm independently (Dyer & Singh, 1998). On the other hand, there are some
implicit risks involved in a supply chain integration decision.

According to the relational view, ﬁrms beneﬁt from systematically shar-
ing valuable knowledge within the supply chain (Dyer & Singh, 1998); but, of


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

course, there is a risk of disclosure to potential competitors. The relational view
also suggests that greater partnership-speciﬁc asset investments will lead to higher
collective proﬁts (Asanuma, 1989; Clark & Fujimoto, 1991; Dyer, 1996; Dyer &
Singh, 1998); however, these investments may create a high degree of interdepen-
dence and information asymmetries between supply chain partners and, hence,
risk for the participating parties who must rely on the purported good faith of
the other parties involved in the relationship. That is, supply chain partnerships
create potential for a breach of trust among partners, which may be difﬁcult to
detect by SCEs (Gulati & Singh, 1998; Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999). These threats
are discussed in greater detail below.

The ﬁrst inherent hazard in supply chain partnerships is knowledge transfer
to external parties. In supply chain partnerships, there is a high likelihood that
a ﬁrm participates in several supply chain partnerships simultaneously (Rice &
Hoppe, 2001). Thus, knowledge shared with a supplier or knowledge jointly created
between a buyer and its supplier may not enjoy proprietary protection and be raided
by potential competitors (Bleeke & Ernst, 1995; Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gulati
& Gargiulo, 1999; Kale, Singh, & Perlmutter, 2000; Myers & Cheung, 2008).
This situation is intensiﬁed when there is no formal contractual agreement, as is
the case in many supply chain partnerships (Lambert, Emmelhainz, & Gardner,
1996). Unlike other types of interﬁrm partnerships, a supply chain relationship is
built upon repeated transactions and reliance on the other party’s capabilities to
complete the value chain process, rather than shared equity or contracted objectives
(He, Ghobadian, Gallear, Race, & Spinks, 2007). In such a situation, the ﬁrm
faces considerable moral hazard because its supply chain partners may “free-
ride” by limiting their contributions to the partnership or might simply behave
opportunistically (Gulati, 1998).

The second implicit threat in fostering supply chain integration is the high
level of investments in speciﬁc assets. For instance, the use of purchased inputs
(e.g., customized new technology) may only have value within the unique context
of the buyer–supplier relationship and hence cannot be easily transposed to other
uses (Williamson, 1985; Anderson & Weitz, 1992; Kumar, Scheer, & Steenkamp,
1995; Dyer & Singh, 1998). At the same time, “tailor made” training or devel-
opment programs for employees involved in the buyer–supplier partnership are
indispensable in order to achieve higher levels of knowledge sharing routines be-
tween partners (Monczka, Petersen, Handﬁeld, & Ragatz, 1998; Krause, Scannell,
& Calantone, 2000; Modi & Mabert, 2007). Such investments in valuable tangible
assets and human capital are costly and may produce asymmetric gains favoring
the partner or, conversely, produce largely unrecoverable losses if the partnership
fails or produces disappointing results (Williamson, 1985; Jap, 1999).

In short, despite the potential advantages to participating ﬁrms, the uncer-
tainty of disclosure of key knowledge and the important speciﬁc investments in
supply chain partnerships makes this a risky decision to the extent that the SCE
is made accountable for the outcomes of such a decision. The risk is privatized
by the SCE even though he or she may not be fully or even partially responsible
for the observed results. As discussed next, the more vulnerable the SCE is to
losses (in terms of compensation and employment, plus the compounding effect

of environmental uncertainty), the less likely the SCE is to support an integra-
tion decision (Hypotheses 1–3), even if the SCE sees it as “the right thing to do”
(Hypothesis 4).

Vulnerability of the SCE: Sources of executive risk bearing
Figure 1 provides an overview of the conceptual model. Three kinds of risk—
compensation risk, employment risk, and environmental risk—augment the vul-
nerability of the SCE and thus reduce his or her willingness to foster supply chain
integration (which, as argued above, represents a risky choice). Each of these ele-
ments is discussed next, followed by a discussion of the consequences of supply
chain integration or the lack thereof.

Compensation risk: Developers of traditional agency models (Beatty & Zajac,
1994; Gray & Cannella, 1997) assume that the executive is risk averse and
thus prefers higher proportions of certain compensation over uncertain (vari-
able) compensation. In contrast, under the BAM, variable pay is assumed to
have little effect on agent risk bearing when it is simply added to a compensa-
tion scheme as an “extra layer” (e.g., from 10% to 20% of variable pay).This is
because (i) variable compensation is normally used for discretionary consump-
tion expenses and savings, which can be deferred into the future or, perhaps,
forgone altogether (Strahilevitz, 1992; Arkes, Joyner, & Stone, 1994) and (ii)
it is not usually counted in calculations of perceived current wealth due to the
fact that it is far less certain (Wiseman & Gomez-Mejia, 1998; Larraza-Kintana
et al., 2007).

Under BAM, base pay is anticipated and viewed as essential to the execu-
tive’s standard of living. It is usually linked primarily to indispensable consumption
expenses (i.e., rent, food, utilities, and so forth) (Strahilevitz, 1992) and, conse-
quently, threats to this type of compensation would be more prominent than threats
to variable pay. In the words of Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia (1998, p. 140) “threats
to future base pay and its value (e.g., losing cost of living or market adjustments)
would seem more salient than threats to variable pay, since losses associated with
future base pay pose a signiﬁcant threat to an executive’s perceived wealth, future


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

earnings potential and, ultimately, to his or her standard of living.” For instance,
the base pay of the SCE may be frozen, fall behind market, lose ground relative to
other managers or new hires, and, in the extreme case, may be cut.

In contrast to CEOs (the central focus of most of this research), who normally
receive 40% of their pay in a variable form (Devers et al., 2008), for SCEs, base
pay or salary on average represents 94% of total pay (salary.com’s survey, 2008).
These ﬁgures are derived from the U.S. surveys but the percentage of base pay
for SCEs in Spain (where the study was conducted) is likely to be much higher,
probably closer to 98% on average. This means that to the extent that supply chain
integration constitutes what Larraza-Kintana et al. (2007) identify as “downside
risk” to SCE’s base pay (e.g., by receiving a weak performance appraisal if supply
chain integration targets are not met and thereby foregoing merit pay adjustments),
the SCE will tend to avoid that risk even if risk avoidance implies surrendering the
potential beneﬁts to the ﬁrm of such integration.

Employment risk: A related but different source of risk bearing is employment
risk. Herein, the SCE may face a greater probability of (i) termination and (ii) neg-
ative reputation in the market if the investment to create supply chain partnerships
does not produce the desired results. In the ﬁrst case, top executives have a tendency
to “scapegoat” those below them when results are disappointing (Gomez-Mejia,
Nu˜nez-Nickel, & Gutierrez, 2001). In the second case, it is difﬁcult for outsiders to
distinguish unfortunate circumstances from poor decisions (Wiseman & Gomez-
Mejia, 1998). As termination plus negative reputation equals loss of all current
income and seriously jeopardizes all future income, employment risk represents
a more severe threat to the SCE’s wealth than does compensation risk (Larraza-
Kintana et al., 2007). This is consistent with Tversky and Wakker’s (1995) research
on choice behavior related to risk, which suggests that a loss-averse SCE will tend
to avoid supply chain integration if this further jeopardizes the SCE’s job security,
which is associated with the loss of all of his or her current income and negatively
impacts further income stream.

The employment risk perceived by the SCE is also intimately related to the
ﬁrm’s evaluation and reward system. Failure to meet performance targets usually
translates into being perceived by superiors as a substandard contributor and,
hence, more amenable to being replaced (Wiseman & Gomez-Mejia, 1998). At
the very least, this is likely to be perceived by the SCE as damaging to his or
her career prospects both within the ﬁrm and in the labor market at large. In
short, SCEs who do not meet quantiﬁable performance targets are likely to receive
(or perceive that they will have) low performances marks and consequently face
greater employment risk.

Hypothesis on internal sources of risk
To summarize our discussion so far, SCEs experiencing high levels of compensa-
tion and employment risk are less likely to foster supply chain integration. Such
an integration is risky in terms of uncertainty of eventual outcomes. Conditions of
high compensation and employment risk should dissuade SCEs from undertaking
this additional risk (as falling below performance targets again in the near future


642

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

could mean a poor evaluation or immediate dismissal). To this, we would like
to add three other related reasons. First, supply chains nowadays are viewed as
important competitive weapons for most ﬁrms (Hult et al., 2002, 2004) and, thus,
should be considered as part of the strategic planning process. However, few ﬁrms
include this facet (or ambiguously implement it) as part of the evaluation criteria
for SCEs. Most SCEs are appraised in the traditional way, mainly by measuring
operative outcomes relative to targets such as price reduction (Rossetti & Choi,
2005) or short-term proﬁts (Ro, Liker, & Fixson, 2007). To the extent that efforts
or processes to develop (long-term oriented) supply chain partnerships are not
given sufﬁcient weight in the SCE’s annual review, these executives are unlikely
to perceive that they are being evaluated or rewarded for this risky endeavor and,
thus, discourage supply chain integration. Second, SCEs might suspect that they
could increase the probability of an unfavorable evaluation by top managers when
pursuing supply chain partnerships even if upper echelons pay lip service to it.
Because of asymmetrical power, SCEs might become an easy blame target by
superiors under lackluster results while superiors may claim credit if the outcomes
are positive (Boeker, 1992; Gomez-Mejia et al., 2001). Lastly, the focal SCE knows
that the result of supply chain partnerships does not exclusively depend on his or
her own effort; instead, it depends on the collaborative effort of other SCEs who
could become members of the supply chain. These three situations intensify the
vulnerability of SCEs and, thus, they might be more reluctant to allocate resources
to pursue collaborative supply chain partnerships. Thus,

H1: The higher the level of base compensation risk, the less likely the SCE is

to promote supply chain integration.

H2: The higher the level of perceived employment risk, the less likely the SCE

is to promote supply chain integration.

The moderator role of environmental risk: The third kind of risk bearing analyzed
in this research is related to external risk (i.e., environmental volatility), which is
likely to compound the effects of employment and compensation risk.

Environmental risk is typically deﬁned as greater variability in organizational
returns and increased chances for corporate ruin (Baird & Thomas, 1985; Miller
& Bromiley, 1990). Industry-wide forces and other external factors (e.g., global
ﬁnancial crisis) expose the ﬁrm to performance uncertainty over which it may
exert very little control (Gray & Cannella, 1997; Bloom & Milkovich, 1998; Cruz,
Gomez-Mejia & Becerra, in press). This risk also has implications for agents. For
instance, a greater external risk may itself threaten executives’ income as uncertain
cash ﬂows or greater chances of organizational failure may make it more difﬁcult
for a ﬁrm to meet its present and future compensation obligations (Bloom &
Milkovich, 1998). The downside of the cycle also means that upward adjustments
to base pay are minimized (Milkovich & Newman, 2008). When a decision could
lead to failure (e.g., because of high market variability), despite the best efforts of
the SCE, he or she may be much more willing to withhold effort or to take evasive
actions designed to reduce risk exposure. This is because environmental risk will
magnify the fear that compensation would suffer for reasons that are totally beyond
the control of the SCE. We therefore expect that:


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

643

H3a: The negative effect of compensation risk on promoting supply chain inte-

gration will be greater for a higher degree of environmental risk.

Similarly external risk as captured by high ﬁrm performance variability threatens
employment stability as ﬁrms attempt to reduce costs during down cycles; a threat
to which the SCE is not immune. Under the BAM perspective, we would expect
that a highly volatile environment would make the SCE less willing to take the
additional risk of promoting supply chain integration as this might exacerbate an
anticipated loss of employment. Not only do the risks of supply chain integration
increase in volatile environments (Liker & Choi, 2004; Chopra & Meindl, 2007),
but also the SCE may rightfully fear that, cost considerations aside, it is easier for
superiors to rationalize or make negative performance attributions to the SCE if
he or she takes additional risk during the down cycle and use that negative bias to
replace the executive, hoping to get a better substitute (Boeker, 1992). Thus,

H3b: The negative effect of employment risk on promoting supply chain inte-

gration will be greater for a higher level of environmental risk.

Supply Chain Integration and Performance
So far, we have discussed the antecedents of supply chain integration from the
perspective of SCEs as decision makers and risk bearers. The last hypothesis deals
with the consequences of promoting supply chain integration on ﬁrm performance.
Firms are increasingly discovering the advantages that can be gained by
seeking mutually beneﬁcial partnerships with other supply chain members (Pow-
ell et al., 1996; Dyer & Singh, 1998; Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000; Mentzer et al.,
2000; Kotabe et al., 2003; Wisner, 2003; Liker & Choi, 2004; Myers & Cheung,
2008). The access and use of knowledge and resources of their supply chain part-
ners allows them to better exploit and improve their capacities. To achieve such
advantages, integrated partners should seek to synchronize processes, establish
high levels of coordination, and share updated, relevant information (Handﬁeld
& Nichols, 1999; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2001; Wisner, 2003; Chen & Paulraj,
2004; Malhotra, Gosain, & El Sawy, 2005). They should systematically seek to
create a value that could otherwise not be created by either partner independently
(Zajac & Olsen, 1993). Conversely, the lack of supply chain integration may lead
to increased inventories, poorer product availability, higher manufacturing cost,
increased replenishment lead times, and a drop in proﬁts (Lee, Padmanabhan, &
Whang, 1997; Chopra & Meindl, 2007).

Previous research (Lee et al., 1997; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2001; Sahin
& Robinson, 2002; Vickery, Jayaram, Droge, & Calantone, 2003; Wisner, 2003;
Chen & Paulraj, 2004; Liker & Choi, 2004; Modi & Mabert, 2007; Wang & Wei,
2007) has consistently shown that high levels of supply chain integration improve
the operational performance of the committed partners. This effect is due to the
intensive use of communication channels that permit partners to better synchronize
their processes and better coordinate their activities. This directly translates into
reduced variability that, in turn, leads to greater efﬁciency along with a cost
reduction and improved lead time. The teamwork between supply chain partners


644

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

also makes them more willing to help each other to cope with uncertainty from
supply, manufacturing, and demand. They gain a better understanding about how
the supply chain they belong to works and what role they play to strengthen supply
chain capabilities. Partners therefore become more responsive to markets, having,
for instance, shorter lead time, better service levels, greater product variety and so
forth. Finally, fostering an environment of mutual support, integrated partners aim
to become quality-oriented organizations that seek (i) the fulﬁllment of the quality
standard of products, (ii) the reduction of shipments rejected and defect rates, and
(iii) the increment of order entry accuracy. Effective supply chain integration thus
seeks to improve participant performance with the main objective of offering better
levels of service owing to the better use of capabilities, expertise, and technologies
of committed partners within the partnership.

H4: Supply chain integration should be positively related to improved opera-

tional performance.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Sample Selection and Data Collection
It is difﬁcult to obtain data on compensation systems, evaluation systems, decision
making, and performance from SCEs because these matters are usually considered
conﬁdential, the information is sensitive, and unlike the case of many CEOs,
the data are not publicly available. This study thus used multiple methods that
combine surveys and interviews with SCEs and human resources management
(HRM) executives as well as secondary data in order to reduce source bias and
obtain reliable and valid data.

A pilot survey was designed and developed from a thorough literature re-
view. The survey was next validated through a pre-test. Comments from three
academics, seven SCEs, and two senior consultants in the ﬁeld of supply chain
management (SCM) help to reﬁne the research constructs. These individuals are
members of the Supply Chain Management Interest Group (SCMIG); a discussion
forum composed of executives from Spanish and multinational ﬁrms sponsored by
IE Business School in Madrid. They closely reviewed and critiqued the pilot survey
and offered several suggestions for improving its wording, design, and adminis-
tration. Finally, we sent the deﬁnitive survey to the sample members, along with
a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study and the assurance of anonymity
for respondents. In some cases, SCEs in different industries were visited to collect
data and interviewed to have in-depth information.

Our population was primarily composed of manufacturing Spanish ﬁrms and
subsidiaries of multinational companies operating in Spain. We selected these com-
panies from the list of 5,000 large companies published by the respected Spanish
business periodical Actualidad Economica. A three-member panel of experts with
extensive experience in SCM and cognizant of the Spanish market selected 932
companies from this list using as a criteria the extent to which SCM is an impor-
tant part of their operations. As noted later, most of these ﬁrms fell into the food
& beverage, chemical & pharmaceutical, and automotive sectors. Most service

organizations were deliberately excluded because they generally lack a tangible
resource or because their SCM operations are menial, which could create differ-
ences in the nature of their interﬁrm collaboration requirements (Chase, Jacobs, &
Aquilano, 2006). The data-collection process yielded 133 usable responses, for a
response rate of 14.3%. This rate compares favorably with those reported by other
studies conducted in Spain (Cruz et al., in press; Gallo & Villaseca, 1996) and ex-
perienced by other surveys in SCM issues (Wisner, 2003; Modi & Mabert, 2007;
Sanders, 2007). This response rate is higher than “the 10–12% rate typical for
studies that target executives in upper echelons” (McDougall & Robinson, 1990;
Hambrick, Geletkanycz, & Fredrickson, 1993; Judge & Dobbins, 1995; Koch &
McGrath, 1996; Geletkanycz, 1997, p. 622; Larraza-Kintana et al., 2007). Table 1
shows the proﬁle of the sample, which reﬂects the diversity that exists among
the participating ﬁrms, based on the number of employees, industry sectors, and
annual sales.

The targeted respondents consisted of SCEs at decision-making levels and in
strategically oriented positions. The most common titles for these SCEs included
corporate directors of purchasing, supply chain directors, and supply chain man-
agers. In addition to the SCE survey, we also secured independent sources of data
following guidelines from previous research (McDougall, 1989; Hitt, Hoskisson,
Johnson & Moesel, 1996). First, we sent a questionnaire about SCE compensation

policies to the HRM directors of the responding ﬁrms. Completed responses from
HRM managers were received from 26 of the 133 responding companies. These
data were used to determine interrater agreement regarding the responses to sur-
vey items concerning compensation and employment risk between supply chain
managers and human resources managers.

Second, we accessed archival data for all of the responding ﬁrms. The sec-
ondary data came from the “Sistemas de An´alisis de Balances Ib´ericos” (SABI)
database that compiles data from the annual reports ﬁled by 949,246 Spanish ﬁrms
in the year 2008. This database includes ﬁrm size, ﬁrm age, industry sector, ﬁnan-
cial information, operational rates, and other miscellaneous data for each company.
Survey-based measures were cross-checked and validated with information from
the SABI database in order to ensure reliable and valid data. This database was
also used to check for a nonresponse bias and calculate several of the control vari-
ables, the environmental risk variable, and the objective operational performance
measure used in the analysis.

Nonresponse Bias
A nonresponse bias was tested by examining the difference between the answers
of respondents and nonrespondents (Lambert & Harrington, 1990). A nonresponse
bias was assessed using a t test, which showed no signiﬁcant difference for ﬁrm
size (p = .192), ﬁrm age (p = .292), and return on assets (ROA) (p = .092)
between responding and no responding companies. A chi-square test, moreover,
showed no signiﬁcant differences for industry sector (χ 2 = 8.09, p > .05). These
results collectively suggest that a nonresponse bias is not present in the data and
that participating ﬁrms represented the population from which they were drawn.

Measurement Scale Items
The different objective and perceptual measures used in the study are described
below.

Compensation risk indicates the degree to which compensation is at risk
of loss. To capture this measure, we asked the SCE to indicate the extent to
which he/she assumes any type of risk to his/her base pay. Responses were made
on a ﬁve-point scale (1 = no risk to my pay; 5 = extremely high risk to my
pay). Responses to these questions were independently validated by calculating
interrater agreement with responses from HRM managers in terms of risks to
annual base salary (r = .79; p < .001), which as noted earlier is the predominant
pay form for SCEs. It is important to note that previous research on CEO pay has
operationalized compensation risk for various forms of retribution (e.g., salary,
short term bonus and stock options). Because SCEs’ salary on average represents
the largest percentage of their total pay (94% in U.S. according to salary.com’s
survey 2008, and possibly higher in Spain), we decided to focus our attention on
annual base salary. This is also entirely consistent with the BAM, which treats
base salary as “essential compensation” and variable forms of pay (e.g., long-term
bonuses) as “nonessential compensation.”

Employment risk values the probability of termination for SCEs. To mea-
sure this risk, we asked the SCE to indicate the degree to which he/she has

failed to satisfy performance targets during the most recent review periods. The
response format for this item ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree). Higher failure in achieving the performance target as part of the ap-
praisal process is a warning sign that superiors are unhappy with the subordinate’s
progress and hence places this person’s job at risk (i.e., it increases the probabil-
ity of termination or replacement; Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, & Cardy, 2009). Hence,
below-target performance as reported by the SCE should be an indicator of higher
employment risk as perceived by the respondent. Answers to this question were
recorded into a dummy variable, where “one” indicates SCEs who responded with
“strongly agree” to the statement and “zero” represents those who selected an-
swers 1 through 4 on this scale. Our focus on the extreme case (those who chose
“strongly agree”) was to ensure that we had captured those SCEs for whom termi-
nation was most likely, as previous research had suggested (Larraza-Kintana et al.,
2007).

The probability of termination for the SCE is ﬁrm speciﬁc and depends
on a variety of factors, including, for instance, evaluation systems. In general,
quantitative goals transfer more risk to executives as they are made accountable
for observed performance outcomes even if these are not entirely under their
control (Gomez-Mejia, Berrone, & Franco, 2010). At the other end, so-called
strategic goals tend to be more process oriented, subjective, and ﬂexible. This
allows for the possibility of receiving a good ex post evaluation if the original
plan was reasonable, given the information available at the time, even if observed
results or ﬁnal outcomes were disappointing and suggest a reconsideration of the
strategic plan (Baysinger & Hoskisson, 1990). Consistent with this and supporting
the construct validity of the employment risk measure, we found that the “below
performance target” responses were positively correlated (r = .294; p < .001) with
another survey item that measured the extent to which the evaluation system of
the SCE is based on quantitative goals rather than qualitative (strategic) goals. As
an external validation of this measure, we asked HRM managers to indicate if the
SCE’s evaluation system was based on strategic goals or if it was mainly focused
on meeting operational performance targets. These responses were validated with
those from SCEs, showing a strong and statistically signiﬁcant correlation (r =
.73, p < .001).

Environmental risk values the degree of volatility of organizational per-
formance. Following previous studies to measure environmental risk (Bromiley,
1991; Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993; Miller et al., 2002; Miller & Chen, 2004),
we used the coefﬁcient of variation of ROA (obtained from SABI) within each
industry sector over the 5 years prior to our survey (2003–2007). We ﬁrst iden-
tiﬁed the ﬁrm’s industry sector following the classiﬁcation made by Spain’s Na-
tional Institute of Statistics and then calculated the average coefﬁcient of varia-
tion for all ﬁrms within each sector. As many of these ﬁrms were not publicly
traded, stock market return data could not be used to calculate a coefﬁcient of
variation.

Supply chain integration measures the degree to which the ﬁrm and its
collaborative supply chain partner (i.e., its supplier) jointly work in the pursuit
of improved performance. We developed a multiitem scale based on a thorough


648

literature review (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Handﬁeld & Nichols, 1999; Frohlich &
Westbrook, 2001; Wisner, 2003; Chen & Paulraj, 2004; Modi & Mabert, 2007)
and reﬁned it based on feedback obtained from a pre-test. This resulted in four
items measuring the extent to which (i) partners share relevant information to
evaluate and adjust to market needs, (ii) partners exchange information about
the technology used, (iii) partners allocate resources in encouraging coordinated
activities, and (iv) partners exchange information frequently and informally, which
allows a better knowledge of their needs. Each item was rated on a ﬁve-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). When these items
were factor-analyzed (with a varimax orthogonal rotation), only one factor reached
an eigenvalue higher than 1.0, explaining 53% of the variance. The reliability
of this scale was measured by Cronbach’s alpha, achieving a satisfactory value
of .70.

Operational performance captures the operative improvements owing to
teamwork between the ﬁrm and its collaborative supplier. To measure it, we
used two different, but related measures of operational performance. The ﬁrst
(subjective) measure came from the survey and has been adopted from pre-
vious studies that capture the overall operational performance using multiple
items (Scannell, Vickery, & Dr¨oge, 2000; Frohlich & Westbrook, 2001; Wis-
ner, 2003; Malhotra et al., 2005; Modi & Mabert, 2007; Sanders, 2007). Using
a ﬁve-point scale, we asked SCEs to indicate the extent to which they believe
that their ﬁrms’ operations improve as they engage in supply chain integration
in terms of (i) higher productivity, (ii) shorter lead time, (iii) improved quality,
and (iv) better service levels. Only one factor reached an eigenvalue higher than
1, explaining 57% of the variance. The Cronbach’s alpha value of this construct
was .72.

The second (objective) measure came from the SABI database and has been
extensively used as a measure of performance (Swamidass, Nair, & Mistry, 1999;
Frohlich & Westbrook, 2001; McKone, Schroeder, & Cua, 2001; Malhotra et al.,
2005; Mitra & Singhal, 2008) and considered as a strategic performance ratio
(Grifﬁs, Cooper, Goldsby, & Closs, 2004; Grifﬁs, Goldsby, Cooper, & Closs,
2007). Inventory turnover represents the degree to which a ﬁrm’s supply chain
processes are streamlined and integrated with those of its partners. A high level
of stock turnover indicates a greater efﬁciency in demand management, the use
of advanced supply chain technology, and a lower risk of loss through unsaleable
stock. However, an inventory turnover that is out of proportion to industry norms
may suggest losses due to shortages and poor customer-service. We therefore used
stock turnover as an important operative measure that indicates the coordinated
effort within supply chain operations. Data about the stock turnover rate of each
ﬁrm came from the SABI database for the year 2007.

Control Variables
This study included several relevant control variables. These were classiﬁed into
three types: one set concerns ﬁrm characteristics, another set captures industry
membership, and the last set measures the presence of enablers for supply chain
integration as suggested in the literature.


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

Organizational-level variables
Company size, ﬁrm age, and ﬁrm performance were controlled in this study. All of
these variables may covary with employment and compensation risks and perhaps,
supply chain integration (the dependent variable). Information on these variables
was gathered through the SABI database. Firm size was measured as the stan-
dardized average value of annual sales. Previous research shows that managerial
compensation covaries with ﬁrm size and that sales volume is the most commonly
used proxy for size (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1989; Tosi & Gomez-Mejia, 1989;
Gray & Cannella, 1997; Bloom & Milkovich, 1998; Miller et al., 2002; Larraza-
Kintana et al., 2007). Employment and compensation risks also tend to be lower
in larger, more established companies (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1987). Moreover
large ﬁrms differ from smaller ﬁrms in their supply chain relationships due to
larger budgets and differences in the power they exert in these relationships (Sub-
ramani & Venkatraman, 2003; Benton & Maloni, 2005) as well as their greater
experience in developing strategic partnerships. Firm age was measured as the
standardized value of number of years the company has been in business since
its founding. Older ﬁrms tend to exhibit higher employment stability and lower
compensation risk than younger ﬁrms (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1990). Lastly, ﬁrm
performance was measured using average ROA for the 2003–2007 period. More
proﬁtable ﬁrms may be able to pay more and have a more stable compensation
and employment system (Anderson, Banker, & Ravindran, 2000). They can also
afford to devote more resources to foster supply chain integration and to absorb
losses if the integration does not produce the desired results.

Industry membership
Industry sector was controlled in order to partial out the inﬂuence of industry-level
effects on managerial pay and employment risk as previous research indicates
(Bloom & Milkovich, 1998; Yanadori & Marler, 2006). Previous research also
suggests that ﬁrms in some industries, such as the automotive sector, engage in
more integration within the chain (Dyer, 1996; Vickery et al., 2003). In the SABI
database, each ﬁrm reports its industry membership based on the categorization
supplied by Spain’s National Institute of Statistics. As the samples in some of the
industry sectors were small, we had to group the 62 registered categories into four
clusters: food and beverage (23.3%), chemical and pharmaceutical (22.6%), auto-
motive (20.3), and others. Because each sector was treated as a dummy variable,
it was necessary to omit one cluster from analysis. The omitted sector was that
represented by “others” that included 33.8% of our sample.

Enablers of supply chain integration
This group of control variables was included with the main purpose of captur-
ing the unique and additive impact of compensation and employment risks and
their interactive effects with environmental risk on supply chain integration, after
partialling out the inﬂuence of enablers such as trust, commitment and informa-
tion technology, which have been amply studied as key factors of supply chain
integration (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Monczka et al., 1998; Mentzer et al., 2000;


650

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

Sahin & Robinson, 2002; Kotabe et al., 2003; Vickery et al., 2003; Saeed, Mal-
hotra, & Grover, 2005; Klein, Rai, & Straub, 2007; Sanders, 2007; Wang & Wei,
2007).

Trust was measured by a seven-item scale previously validated by Zaheer
and Venkatraman (1994); Siguaw, Simpson, and Baker (1998); and Morgan and
Hunt (1994). The items on this scale measured the level of conﬁdence that the
buyer ﬁrm has in its supplier’s reliability, integrity, and fairness. Commitment was
measured by a three-item scale adapted from Gilliland and Bello (2002) and Richey
(2003). The items of this scale measured the extent to which the ﬁrm is willing to
develop a long-term relationship with its collaborative supplier in the future and
the extent to which it recognizes that the loss of its partner means an important
loss in ﬁnancial investments and knowledge developed during the relationship.
Lastly, information technology captures the degree to which the ﬁrm can easily
interact and coordinate efforts with its collaborative supplier through established
and cost-efﬁcient information systems. This was assessed with two survey items
that measure the availability of electronic links (e.g., electronic data interchange)
and the use of specialized technologies to share updated and relevant information
within supply chain operations. The response format for each of these items ranged
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Cronbach’s alpha values were
.86, .74, and .65 for trust, commitment, and information technology, respectively.

RESULTS

Table 2 presents means, standard deviations, and correlations among all variables.
None of the correlations among the independent and the control variables exceeds
.70, and the highest correlation is between chemical and pharmaceutical sector
and environmental risk (r = .59), indicating that multicollinearity is not a major
problem for the regression analyses.

All variables were centered prior to conducting a regression analysis (Cohen,
Cohen, West, & Aitken, 2003), except the dichotomous measure for employment
risk. The hypotheses were tested using a regression analysis. As is customary,
control variables and main effects were entered ﬁrst. Multiplicative terms were
added later to examine the hypothesized interactions. Tables 3 and 4 report the
results from the regression analysis with supply chain integration and operational
performance as the dependent variables. These tables also report the changes in
adjusted R2 at each step and the signiﬁcance of each regression equation.

Hypothesis 1 predicts a negative association between compensation risk and
the SCE’s decision to foster supply chain integration. Consistent with prediction,
this hypothesis was supported (ß = −.13, p < .05) suggesting that the higher the
level of perceived compensation risk, the less likely the SCE promotes supply chain
integration (see Table 3, model 2). Hypothesis 2 predicts that there is a negative
relationship between the SCE’s employment risk and supply chain integration.
The regression results support hypothesis 2’s prediction (ß = −.47, p < .05) (see
Table 3, model 2). These ﬁndings collectively suggest that the higher the risk
perceived by SCEs, either to compensation or employment stability, the less likely
that they will allocate resources to encourage supply chain integration.

The results regarding the interaction effects of compensation, employment,
and environmental risk on supply chain integration (Hypotheses 3a and 3b) are
presented in model 3 of Table 3. The equation for the full model was statistically
signiﬁcant at p < .0001. The adjusted R2 increased from 18.2 (model 2) to 22.1
(model 3) when the multiplicative terms are added to the equation. The change
in adjusted R2 was statistically signiﬁcant at p < .001. However, only one of the
moderating effects was signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 3a, which predicts that the negative
effect of compensation risk on promoting supply chain integration will be greater
for a higher degree of environmental risk, was not statistically supported (ß=−.04,
ns). Hypothesis 3b, which predicts that the negative effect of employment risk on
promoting supply chain integration will be greater under higher levels of environ-
mental risk, was strongly supported. The results show that this interaction term was
signiﬁcantly negative (ß = −.67, p < .01), suggesting that when environmental
risk is high, employment risk has a more negative effect on the pursuit of supply
chain integration than when environmental risk is low. The reader should note that
these results are immune to method variance as the indicator of employment risk
comes from the SCE (which is highly correlated with the independent assessment

by the HRM executive) and the environmental risk indicator is obtained from the
SABI database. The results thus suggest that when it comes to an assessment of
the risk bearing attached to environmental volatility by the SCE, the main concern
is losing his/her job rather than losing base pay (of course, the former implies
forfeiting all base pay, which is a more severe threat). Figure 2 shows a plot of this
interaction effect, using procedures by Aiken and West (1991).

Turning our attention to the control variables (see Table 3, model 1), it is
interesting to note that, as expected, ﬁrm size, trust, and commitment are positively
related to supply chain integration. Surprisingly, ﬁrm age has a negative impact
on supply chain integration, perhaps indicating that more traditional organizations
with well-established routines exhibit greater inertia and thus higher reluctance
to engage in joint decision making with supply chain partners. Firm performance
(ROA) also shows a negative impact on integration, perhaps insinuating that ﬁrms
that are doing well might see less gain in collaborative efforts within the supply
chain.

Hypothesis 4, which predicts a positive association between supply chain
integration and operational performance, was supported. There was a positive and
signiﬁcant correlation between supply chain integration and our subjective measure
of operational performance (r= .22, p < .05) assessed by the SCE and our objective
measure of stock turnover (r = .16, p = 0.08) obtained from the SABI database
(see correlation matrix, Table 2). We also regressed the effects of supply chain
integration on operational performance after ﬁrst introducing control variables
related to ﬁrm characteristics and industry (see Table 4). We did not include the
group of control variables related to enablers in Table 4 because (i) theory tells us
that they are conceptually related to factors that enhance supply chain integration
rather than performance outcomes, (ii) they were already introduced in the ﬁrst
regression (Table 3) in which the focus was to analyze the additive impact of

compensation risk and employment risk and their interactions with environmental
risk that goes further of the effects of previous enablers studied in the literature, and
(iii) this would produce an unnecessary loss of degrees of freedom. The regression
results show that supply chain integration was signiﬁcantly and positively related
to our subjective measure (ß = .25, p < .01) and our objective measure (ß = .17,
p = .07) of operational performance (see Table 4, model 2). Once again the reader
is reminded that “common source” cannot account for any of the latter variance
or statistical signiﬁcance as the objective measure (stock turnover) was gathered
independently from the SABI database.

DISCUSSION

Increasingly SCEs realize that their organizations’ operations are not run indepen-
dently from their supply chains. They should allocate resources to synchronize
processes and share knowledge with other key supply chain partners in order to
improve their ﬁrms’ operational performance. Simultaneously, they have to deal
with the risks resulting from the intense level of collaborative knowledge sharing
and the high level of relationship-speciﬁc investments. This uncertain situation
limits SCEs’ risk taking because they may see their personal wealth threatened if
the expected result of supply chain integration does not occur. In order to promote
supply chain integration and ensure continued ﬁrm competitiveness and success,
ﬁrms must therefore develop an employment and compensation system that re-
duces executive risk bearing and thus promotes risk taking for their SCEs.


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

655

Previous research has consistently suggested that integrated supply chains
improve the operational performance (Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000; Frohlich & West-
brook, 2001; Vickery et al., 2003; Wisner, 2003; Liker & Choi, 2004; Modi &
Mabert, 2007; Myers & Cheung, 2008). But what are the factors that foster or
hinder integration? By examining human resource factors using the BAM, this
article attempts to explain how to induce SCEs to foster supply chain integration
under the perspective of managerial risk bearing. An extrapolation of our ﬁndings
suggests that the SCE is more willing to take the risky decision of fostering supply
chain integration when a ﬁrm’s employment and compensation system assures
his/her essential (base) pay and also emphasizes the strategic desirability of his/her
decisions to the ﬁrm’s interests in the appraisal process rather than meeting quan-
titative operational targets that augment employment risk. In these cases, the idea
is to reduce executive risk exposure (e.g., by decoupling employment risk from the
pursuit of supply chain integration) in order to change the SCE’s risk preference.
Clearly, our results suggest that SCEs will tend to avoid supply chain integration
if this involves a personal risk, no matter how beneﬁcial the SCE believes this
integration might be for the ﬁrm.

Almost 20 years ago, Baysinger and Hoskisson (1990) suggested that boards
of directors and upper echelons should rely mainly on strategic rather than on
numerical control systems. While they did not use our language nor did they apply
our theoretical arguments, these authors’ recommendations are congruent with our
logic and results. Under strategic control systems, judgments are made about the
quality of decisions made by SCEs before implementation, considering the context
facing the ﬁrm. Hence, the use of strategic controls by superiors relieves SCEs of
achieving short-term operative performance outcomes where their inﬂuence may
only be partial (e.g., when ﬁrms operate in volatile environments), and instead
focuses evaluation on means that can sustain long-term competitiveness (e.g.,
supply chain integration process), which can be subjectively assessed. This article
thus suggest that a ﬁrm’s evaluation system should rely on strategic control systems
with top managers actively giving support to SCEs’ long-term oriented decisions,
such as supply chain integration, through continuous advice and encouragement.
Based on the BAM, this research suggests that by insulating a basic com-
pensation from the threat of loss, we reduce the capacity of SCEs to protect their
perceived current wealth and, as a consequence, they are more conﬁdent of pursuing
high-return, albeit risky, supply chain partnerships. Doing this, the ﬁrm provides
incentives for the SCE that are tied to its performance, without the threat of loss
that pursuing strategies such as supply chain integration entails. In the same vein,
the lack of strategic goal setting for SCM, the ambiguity of evaluation criteria, and
the focus to evaluate and reward primarily on meeting (short-term) performance
criteria make SCEs less willing to put efforts in developing important supply chain
partnerships, which imply surrendering their potential beneﬁts.

This article also extends the BAM developed by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia
(1998) by incorporating the moderating role of environmental risk. Firms operating
in volatile environments have more difﬁculty in assuring reliable compensation and
employment stability for their executives; a situation that is taken into account in
the decision-making process by SCEs. The results showed that loss-averse SCEs
exhibit less risk-taking behavior in highly volatile markets than stable markets.


656

A Multidisciplinary Behavioral Agency Perspective

This suggests that ﬁrms operating in dynamic markets that seek to promote supply
chain integration (as a way to gain control over supply uncertainty and share
risks with partners) should attempt to assure essential compensation and, more
importantly, focus on the quality of the decision-making processes of SCEs as they
may be blamed for poor results even if performance outcomes are largely beyond
their control.

This article also uses a new context to examine managerial risk bearing.
Past research on compensation design has been almost exclusively concerned with
CEOs. A major novelty of this study is its focus on the SCE, who plays an increas-
ingly pivotal role in ensuring continued ﬁrm competitiveness and success (Mangan
& Christopher, 2005). We have analyzed how a ﬁrm’s appropriate employment and
compensation system induces the SCE to foster supply chain partnerships, which
improve operational performance. This is important because increasingly compe-
tition actually does take place between supply chains and, therefore, to have richer
insights about which human resource factors facilitate supply chain integration
(despite the inﬂuence of enablers such as trust and commitment) becomes vital for
researchers and practitioners. Finally, this article conﬁrms previous empirical ﬁnd-
ings that supply chain integration improves operational performance of committed
partners.

Lastly, it is important to remind the reader that even when the SCE believes
that supply chain integration has a salutary effect on operational performance (as
captured by the four Likert type items) this individual is willing to decide against
it when compensation or employment security is at risk. This is consistent with
BAM predictions that excessive agent risk bearing increases agency costs (in our
case foregoing the purported advantages of supply chain integration).

Limitations and Future Research
The limitations of this research provide fertile areas for further research. First,
this article emphasizes the new tendency toward greater collaboration between
supply chain partners, but such collaborations are difﬁcult where competing supply
chains have common suppliers or where suppliers compete with customers (Rice
& Hoppe, 2001). Our conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution in
those situations. Second, although we used multiple respondents and secondary
data to strengthen the veridicality of the results, we examined the viewpoint of
the SCE of a buying ﬁrm in relation to its main supplier to evaluate supply chain
integration. Future studies should also collect data from both enterprises involved in
the partnership to ensure a balanced view. Third, we analyzed a speciﬁc situation of
SCEs’ risk-taking behavior regarding supply chain integration. Although we have
no reason to think that our ﬁndings can change for other types of risky decisions,
it might be interesting to conﬁrm the strength of our ﬁndings with other similar
decisions involved in SCM.

Fourth, this article does not address advantages of supply chain integration
that go beyond operations management to areas such as innovation and marketing.
Executives of these areas could be interested in developing joint strategies with
supply chain members to achieve their ﬁrms’ goals. It would be interesting to
consider how to design a compensation plan for teams of executives, in addition


Villena, Gomez-Mejia, and Revilla

657

to individual compensation studied here. Relatedly, we have focused our com-
pensation analysis on base pay but it would be interesting to examine the role of
other managerial incentives that Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia (1998) refer to as
“nonessential pay.” We have argued that a ﬁrm’s employment and compensation
system should assure reliable pay that is perceived as essential to the SCE’s stan-
dard of living. But layering variable-pay incentives on top of essential (base) pay
may persuade the SCE to seek higher return, albeit risky projects such as supply
chain integration. Fifth, the variables of compensation and employment risk in this
research are measured by single items, and as such may be subject to a measure-
ment error (Churchill, 1979). Future research might develop multiple-item scales
that can better specify the constructs’ domain and improve their validity and reli-
ability. Finally, this study does not analyze the inﬂuence of the decisions of SCEs
on the bottom line, for example on their ﬁrms’ stock price. Future research could
analyze the extent to which SCEs, unlike other senior executives, can inﬂuence
their ﬁrms’ stock prices.

There are many questions that arise from this study that are amenable to
future multidisciplinary research. These include examining the conditions when
bilateral dependence, power imbalance, and information asymmetries among sup-
ply chain partners increase the SCE’s risk bearing; how various types of trust
(e.g., ability, benevolence, and integrity; Cruz et al., in press) inﬂuence the per-
ceived vulnerability (and hence risk bearing) of the SCE; how the SCE sets the
reference points for gains or losses (Wiseman & Gomez-Mejia, 1998) in supply
chain partnerships; and the extent to which the organizational culture is tolerant
of failure and hence allows the SCE to take more risks within the integration
process.

Conclusions
In this article, we state that the propensity of a ﬁrm to promote supply chain
integration is related to the attitudes of the SCE toward risk and that these attitudes
will change systematically according to the three kinds of risk-bearing analyzed.
This research also suggests that an appropriate employment and compensation
system can help to induce SCEs to exhibit risk-taking behavior as exempliﬁed in
supply chain integration. Such risk-taking behavior is also likely to have positive
consequences for the ﬁrm (such as salutary impact of supply chain integration on
operational performance).

Our theoretical arguments and ﬁndings indicate that external context facing
the ﬁrm is a critical element to consider when designing the compensation and
employment contract for SCEs. High levels of ﬁrm-speciﬁc risk augment executive
risk bearing and, thus, reduce risk-taking behavior. This suggests that ﬁrms oper-
ating in highly uncertain markets that seek to develop strategic partnerships within
the supply chain should put more emphasis on evaluating the decision-making
process of the SCE, rather than on the extent to which performance outcomes
have been met (because uncertain environments allow SCEs little control over the
operational performance).
