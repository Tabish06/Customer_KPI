ABSTRACT: The present study investigated the role of psychological contract
breach in employees’ experience of emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction.
Employees (N = 161) from a large financial corporation completed questionnaires
assessing work-related attitudes and behaviors. Fulfillment of organizational ob-
ligations predicted both emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction, and job de-
mands predicted only emotional exhaustion. Supervisory support and control did
not predict emotional exhaustion or job satisfaction when controlling for fulfill-
ment of organizational obligations and job demands. The results suggest that
psychological contract breach contributes to employee experience of job strain.

KEY WORDS: psychological contract breach; emotional exhaustion; job dissatis-
faction.

Today’s organizations are downsizing, restructuring, and in many
ways not living up to the obligations that employees feel their organiza-
tion has to them (Howard & Frink, 1996; Morrison & Robinson, 1997;
Turnley & Feldman, 1998). Such breaches or violations of the psychologi-
cal contract have been viewed as having negative effects on employees
(Kozlowski, Chao, Smith, & Hedlund, 1993; Zeitlin, 1995), potentially
leading to experienced stress and strain (Maslach, Schaufeli & Leiter,
2001). There has been considerable research indicating that job de-
mands, possibly in combination with a lack of control and social support,
can result in employee burnout and job dissatisfaction (Burke & Richard-
sen, 1993; Cordes & Dougherty, 1993; Etzion & Westman, 1994; Kara-
sek & Theorell, 1990). The purpose of this study was to examine the

moderating effects of organizational fulfillment of obligations on the re-
lationship between job demands, control, social support, and emotional
exhaustion and job dissatisfaction.

PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS

Psychological contracts, involving employee beliefs about reciprocal
obligations between themselves and their employers, are the foundation
of employment relationships (Roussau, 1995; Shore & Tetrick, 1994). By
interacting with organizational agents and observing organizational pro-
cedures, employees develop beliefs about what they owe to their em-
ployer as well as how the organization is obligated to reciprocate their
efforts and actions (Rousseau & Parks, 1993). However, organizations
may sometimes not be able or willing to fulfill all of the obligations made
to their employees, resulting in psychological contract breach.

Psychological contract breach refers to employee perceptions that
their organization failed to meet one or more obligations associated with
perceived mutual promises (Morrison & Robinson, 1997). Employee per-
ceptions of breach have negative consequences for organizations, such as
lowered performance and citizenship behavior, reduced commitment and
satisfaction, as well as actual turnover (Robinson, 1996; Robinson &
Rousseau, 1994; Robinson, Kraatz & Rousseau, 1994). Research also sug-
gests that psychological contract breach is the norm as opposed to an
exception at work (Robinson & Rousseau, 1994), particularly during
times of organizational change and uncertainty (Howard & Frink, 1996;
Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Turnley & Feldman, 1998). For employees,
psychological contracts lay the foundation for perceptions of predictabil-
ity and control, which are decreased when obligations associated with
psychological contracts are not fulfilled (Shore & Tetrick, 1994; Tetrick &
LaRocco, 1987). This lack of predictability and control may be associated
with experienced stress for employees (Maslach, Schaufeli & Leiter,
2001; Sutton, 1990). We propose that the effects of job demands on emo-
tional exhaustion and job satisfaction may depend on individuals’ per-
ceptions that their organization has fulfilled its obligations.

FULFILLMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL OBLIGATIONS

Present theoretical thinking about the employment relationship is
that it represents an exchange between the individual employee and the
organization (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, & Sowa, 1986; Rous-
seau, 1995). The essence of social exchange is that reciprocation of ser-
vices creates interdependence and a social bond between the parties


ANIKA GAKOVIC AND LOIS E. TETRICK

237

participating in the exchange (Blau, 1964). In the work context, the foun-
dation of the exchange is a psychological contract, or employee beliefs
about mutual obligations that are expected to be reciprocally fulfilled
(Roussau, 1995; Rousseau & Parks, 1993; Shore & Tetrick, 1994). When
obligations associated with the psychological contract are not fulfilled,
employees may experience reduced predictability and control, conse-
quently leading to stress for the individual (Shore & Tetrick, 1994;
Sutton, 1990). Similarly, much of the organizational change literature
suggests that times of substantial organizational change result in the
experience of stress for employees (Howard & Frink, 1996; Shaw, Fields,
Thacker, & Fisher, 1993; Zeitlin, 1995) and that organizational change
may precipitate the breach of individuals’ psychological contracts (Mor-
rison & Robinson, 1997; Turnley & Feldman, 1998). Thus, the literature
suggests that unfulfilled organizational obligations may be related to
employee stress. Two ways in which strain has frequently been looked at
in the stress literature are emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction
(Kahn & Byosiere, 1992; Lee & Ashforth, 1996; Maslach, Schaufeli &
Leiter, 2001). Therefore, it can be expected that company failure to fulfill
obligations to its employees would be associated with job strain for the
individuals, manifested through increased emotional exhaustion and de-
creased job satisfaction.

H1. Fulfillment of organizational obligations is negatively related to
emotional exhaustion and positively related to job satisfaction.

SOCIAL SUPPORT

The literature also suggests that social support may help counter-
balance the demands of work for employees (Cordes & Dougherty, 1993;
Hobfoll, 1989; Maslach, Schaufeli & Leiter, 2001). Major work demands
include stressful events and workload pressures, while major resources
include control and social support from various sources (Burke & Richard-
sen, 1993; Cordes & Dougherty, 1993). Therefore, control and social sup-
port may function as coping resources that ameliorate the potentially
negative effects of work demands (the “buffering hypothesis”) such
as increased emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction (Cordes &
Dougherty, 1993; Karasek & Theorell, 1990). However, while studies
have shown that the lack of social support is consistently linked to burn-
out, research on the moderating role of control and social support in
stress has been inconclusive (Etzion & Westman, 1994; Maslach,
Schaufeli & Leiter, 2001; Schechter, Green, Olsen, Kruse, & Cargo,
1997). Based on the social support literature, the source of social support
needs to be someone in the work environment, such as a supervisor, who


238

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

understands the work environment and conceivably can render assis-
tance to the individual in meeting the job demands (Cohen & Wills,
1985). Therefore, supervisory social support may buffer employees from
the effects of job demands in terms of job strain, while supervisory fail-
ure to support individual employees should strengthen the relationship
of job demands with emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction for
those individuals. Given the discussed inconsistency in the literature, we
hypothesize the following:

H2. Supervisory social support moderates the relation between job

demands and emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction.

H3. Supervisory social support moderates the relation between job

control and emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction.

Organizational fulfillment of obligations can be conceptualized as a
reflection of organizational support for the individual employee (Guzzo,
Noonan, & Elron, 1994). When obligations associated with the psycholog-
ical contract are not fulfilled, the message to employees may be that the
organization does not value their contributions or care about their well-
being, also referred to as the lack of organizational support (Eisenberger
et al., 1986; Robinson, 1995). Thus, fulfillment of organizational obliga-
tions can be seen as an aspect of social support that may buffer employ-
ees from the effects of job demands in terms of job strain. In other words,
organizational failure to fulfill promises to individual employees should
strengthen the relationship of job demands with emotional exhaustion
and job dissatisfaction for those individuals. Therefore, the following are
hypothesized:

H4. Fulfillment of organizational obligations moderates the rela-

tionship between job demands and emotional exhaustion.

H5. Fulfillment of organizational obligations moderates the rela-

tionship between job demands and job satisfaction.

METHOD

Sample

Employees from a large financial corporation voluntarily partici-
pated in the study. The employees were experiencing significant organi-
zational changes including a merger, a change in computer systems for
performing their work, and the physical relocation of the office several
miles away from the old location. These events were implemented unilat-
erally, without the employees having any voice in the decisions, although

239

the organization did provide training on the new computer system. Con-
versations with a contact person at the organization indicated that em-
ployees were experiencing stress as a result of the changes. Participants
were asked to complete questionnaires assessing work-related attitudes
and behaviors. A portion of the sample completed the questionnaires in
a group administration (N = 85). The rest of the questionnaires were sent
out through internal mail and 128 were returned for a response rate of
78%. The total sample size was 213, but after listwise deletion for miss-
ing data the sample size was 161. The missing data in the majority of the
deleted cases were on demographic information, suggesting that some of
the respondents may have been concerned about being identified. In the
sample used for the analyses, 90% of participants were women, and 85%
of the participants were employed full-time.

Measures

Emotional Exhaustion. Participants were asked to complete four items
adapted from the emotional exhaustion dimension of Maslach’s (1982)
measure of burnout. An example of an item is “I feel emotionally drained
from my work.” A five-point response scale was used (1 = strongly dis-
agree to 5 = strongly agree).
Job Satisfaction. Three items from the Job Diagnostic Survey (Hack-
man & Oldham, 1980) were used to measure overall job satisfaction. An
example of an item is “All in all, I am satisfied with my job.” A five-point
response scale was used (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).
Organizational Fulfillment of Obligations. Participants were asked to
respond to two items measuring the degree to which they perceived that
their organization had fulfilled its obligations and promises to them as
individual employees. These items were adapted from Robinson and
Rousseau (1994) and a five-point response scale was used (1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree). For example, one of the items is “My or-
ganization has kept its promises to me.”
Job Demands. Conversations with officers of the organization suggested
that the primary stressor in the work environment was workload. There-
fore, three items were used to measure qualitative workload (LaRocco,
Tetrick, & Meder, 1989) and two items from House (1980) were used to
measure quantitative workload. The five items were moderately corre-
lated with each other so were combined into a single composite of job
demands. A seven-point response scale was used (1 = none or a very little
extent to 7 = very much or to a great extent). An example of an item is
“To what extent do you have to work long hours?”


240

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

Control. Participants were asked to respond to three items measuring
the degree of control they had in the work environment that were
adapted from Sutton and Kahn (1986). A seven-point response scale was
used for this measure (1 = none or a very little extent to 7 = very much
or to a great extent). A sample item is “To what extent do you have
influence over the things that affect you on the job?”
Supervisor Support. Participants were asked to respond to four items
adapted from Caplan et al. (1975) to assess perceived support from their
supervisors. A seven-point response scale was used for this measure
(1 = none or a very little extent to 7 = very much or to a great extent).
An example of an item is “How easy is it to talk with your immediate
supervisor?”

RESULTS

Means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations are shown
in Table 1. Coefficient alpha estimates of internal consistency are pre-
sented on the diagonal. Examination of the means indicated that, despite
the organizational changes, participants were not experiencing high lev-
els of emotional exhaustion (mean = 2.52, SD = .88) or low levels of job
satisfaction (mean = 3.84, SD = .74).

The two dependent variables, emotional exhaustion and job satisfac-
tion were strongly, negatively related (r =− .60). Organizational fulfill-
ment of obligations was negatively related to emotional exhaustion (r =
−.43) and positively related to job satisfaction (r = .55). Job demands
were positively related to emotional exhaustion (r = .27) and both control
(r =− .20) and supervisor support (r =− .32) were negatively related to
emotional exhaustion. Somewhat surprisingly, job demands (r =− .01)
were not related to satisfaction, although control (r = .27) and supervisor
support (r = .28) were positively related to satisfaction.

The results of the regression analyses are shown in Table 2. None
of the hypothesized interactions were significant. Neither aspect of social
support, fulfillment of organizational obligations and supervisory sup-
port, acted as moderators. There was no support for fulfillment of organi-
zational obligations as a moderator of the relationships of job demands
and emotional exhaustion or job satisfaction. Further, there was no evi-
dence for the moderating effects of control and supervisory support on
the relations between job demands and emotional exhaustion or job sat-
isfaction. This is not unexpected since prior research has not found con-
sistent support for the moderating effects of supervisor support or con-
trol (e.g., Etzion & Westman, 1994; Schechter et al., 1997).

Although the hypothesized interactions were not supported, job de-
mands and fulfillment of organizational obligations significantly pre-
dicted emotional exhaustion (β= .26 and β=− .33, respectively). Some-
what surprisingly, control and supervisor support did not independently
predict emotional exhaustion. Higher job demands were associated with
higher levels of emotional exhaustion, and higher levels of organizational
fulfillment of obligations were associated with lower levels of emotional
exhaustion. This supports the notion that organizational fulfillment of
obligations offsets the negative effects of job demands.

Organizational fulfillment of obligations was also a significant pre-
dictor of job satisfaction (β= .49). The more the organization was viewed
as living up to its promises the more satisfied the employees were. It
was somewhat surprising that job demands, control, and supervisor sup-
port were not predictive of satisfaction given the prior literature on the

stress-strain model in which dissatisfaction frequently has been used as
an indicator of strain (Kahn & Byosiere, 1992). However, in this particu-
lar sample, these variables did not predict satisfaction.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of psy-
chological contract fulfillment to predict emotional exhaustion and job
satisfaction in the context of organizational change. The results indi-
cated that job demands were positively related to emotional exhaustion
while fulfillment of organizational obligations, as well as control and
supervisory support, were negatively related to emotional exhaustion.
Fulfillment of organizational obligations, control, and supervisor support
were positively related to job satisfaction. Such correlations were con-
sistent with the existing stress literature and the buffering hypothesis
(Cordes & Dougherty, 1993; Karasek & Theorell, 1990; Maslach,
Schaufeli & Leiter, 2001).

The data did not support the hypothesized moderating effects of su-
pervisory social support and fulfillment of organizational obligations on
the relationships between job demands and emotional exhaustion or job
demands and job satisfaction. Further, there was no evidence for the
moderating effects of control and supervisor support in predicting emo-
tional exhaustion and job satisfaction. Such results correspond with the
existing mixed support for the interactions among job demands, control,
and social support (Etzion & Westman, 1994; Schechter et al., 1997).
These findings are also consistent with Dollard and Winefield’s (1998)
conclusion that smaller scale studies using homogenous samples gener-
ally fail to provide support for the interaction effects between job de-
mands, control, and social support.

The data did support our prediction that psychological contract breach
may be source of employee reports of emotional exhaustion and job dis-
satisfaction. Namely, organizational failure to fulfill obligations was as-
sociated with emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction for the
employees. Also, as predicted, job demands were associated with emo-
tional exhaustion. However, job demands, control and supervisory sup-
port were not associated with job satisfaction after controlling for organi-
zational fulfillment of obligations. Another surprising finding was that
control and supervisory support did not predict emotional exhaustion
after controlling for organizational fulfillment of obligations. Therefore,
the present study failed to find support for the “buffering hypothesis”
(Cordes & Dougherty, 1993; Karasek & Theorell, 1990).

Shore and Tetrick (1994) suggested that psychological contracts may
be a factor in employee perceptions of predictability and control. There-

fore, psychological contract breach would be associated with a decrease
in employee perceptions of predictability and control as well as subse-
quent experience of stress for the employees (Sutton, 1990). This was
supported by the finding in the present study that organizational failure
to fulfill obligations towards its members was associated with increased
emotional exhaustion for the employees. Therefore, the concept of the
psychological contract can be theoretically and empirically integrated
with the stress literature, suggesting that the employment exchange re-
lationship plays a role in employee experience of job strain.

The findings of the present study have important practical implica-
tions. With job stress claims on the rise in the United States as well as
globally (Aldred, 2000; Sauter & Hurrell, 1999), and the potential loss of
productivity through absence and illness (Baker & Green, 1991; Beehr &
Newman, 1978; Tafalla & Evans, 1997), stress experienced by employees
is clearly an important issue. Much literature on stress has focused on
job and role-related factors. The present study suggests that psychologi-
cal contracts, and particularly their breach on the part of the organi-
zation, play a role in employees’ experience of stress. Psychological
contracts are closely related to organizational justice perceptions, specifi-
cally individual assessments of procedural fairness (Cropanzano & Pre-
har, 2001). Therefore, managers in organizations undergoing change
should consider employee perceptions of procedural justice, as these play
a role in employee evaluations of psychological contract breach (Robin-
son, 1995; Turnley & Feldman, 1998). Possible ways to enhance proce-
dural justice perceptions include giving explanations for organizational
decisions that may be viewed by the employees as having negative out-
comes, as well as giving employees a chance to participate in organiza-
tional decision-making processes (Bies, 1987). The importance of attend-
ing to psychological contract breach is evident from the literature
showing the negative impact of it on important organizational outcomes,
such as citizenship behavior, commitment, satisfaction, and employee in-
tention to remain with the organization (Robinson, Kraatz & Rousseau,
1994; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994).

The present research was carried out in an organization going
through many changes (e. g., merger, new computer system, change in
physical location), which were expected to have a negative effect on the
employees. Surprisingly, the reported levels of emotional exhaustion
were relatively low while job satisfaction was relatively high among the
employees. One possible explanation for this is that the majority of indi-
viduals who were adversely affected by the changes may have already
left the organization or declined to participate. It is also possible that
organizational activities to implement the changes were successful in
reducing the negative effects of organizational change.

The findings of the present study should be considered in light of


244

several limitations. One limitation was the cross-sectional survey design.
Since this was the first empirical integration of the psychological con-
tract and job stress literature to our knowledge, it seemed appropriate
to use a cross-sectional design (Schmitt, 1994). We may have failed to
find support for the proposed interaction effects because of the skewed
frequency distributions of the outcome variables and the modest sample
size after the removal of missing data (Cohen, 1988). Another potential
limitation concerns the homogeneity of the sample, which consisted pri-
marily of women who held clerical and telephone sales positions. This
homogeneity may have been a factor in failing to find interaction effects
(Dollard & Winefeld, 1998). Also, the homogeneity of the sample used in
the present study raises questions regarding the generalizability of the
findings, namely, whether the results would hold for men or for people
in other types of jobs. However, in terms of gender, results of another
study conducted in the British banking sector suggested that links be-
tween gender and attitudes towards changes in the psychological con-
tract are “largely stereotypical” (Sparrow, 1996, p. 87). Specifically, Spar-
row (1996) found that gender was related to expectations and feelings
regarding career opportunities, but that psychological contract changes
were not linked to gender differences in trust, commitment, and satisfac-
tion. Regardless, the results of the present study need to be replicated.
Future research should examine whether organizational fulfillment of
obligations connotes a form of perceived organizational support.

CONCLUSION

The present study contributes to the stress literature by incorporat-
ing the effects of the employment relationship perceptions in the stress
process. The findings suggest that, while increased job demands are as-
sociated with employees reporting more emotional exhaustion, when an
organization lives up to its promises, employees experience less emo-
tional exhaustion and are more satisfied with their jobs. Therefore, our
study suggests that perceptions of organizational failure to fulfill obliga-
tions, or psychological contract breach, may be an important source of
emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction for the employees.
