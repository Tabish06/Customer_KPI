 policy which consider corporations' social responsibilities (15), and mutual
 funds with social objectives (6, 9). Such social consciousness might be
 expected to reduce the demand (and therefore price) for the stock of the
 socially irresponsible company.

 An empirical study was made of investors' valuation of nine paper com-
 panies after substantial publicity was released about their pollution tend-
 encies. Cross-section valuation models were prepared for the four quarters
 beginning just prior to the publicity. Both institutional purchases and price
 changes were analyzed to determine the impact of the undesirable publicity.

 Method and Empirical Tests

 The companies were selected from a study by Joseph H. Bragdon and
 John A. T. Marlin (2). This study was highly publicized in such media as
 the New York Times, Business Week magazine (8), and the NYSE's
 Exchange (5). Essentially, Bragdon and Marlin found a correlation be-
 tween profitability and good pollution control.

 Although the Bragdon and Marlin study included 17 companies, the lack

 of stable earnings histories limited the companies in the present study to the
 nine listed in Table 1. Five of the deleted companies had experienced rather
 heavy merger activity. Of the remaining 12, Westavco and Potlatch did not
 have long continuous histories, and Hammermill had earnings below $.10
 for the full period of this study.

 The first two pollution indexes, A and B, represent the percentage of a
 company's mills that have an adequate degree of pollution control in four
 categories-water, particle, gas, and odor. The first index weights water
 pollution twice as heavily as the other three components; index B weights
 water pollution three times as heavily, thereby giving equal weight to water
 and air (the three other components) pollution. Rank correlation indicated
 the obvious similarity between the two indexes. The third index, C, was an
 overall environmental rating.

 For each company, data from March 1971 through March 1972 were

 collected on quarterly earnings and the closing share price six weeks after
 the end of the quarter, thereby allowing time for the earnings information
 to be disseminated. The quarterly earnings were normalized by using a four-
 quarter moving average; the importance of normalization has been justified
 and explained in such studies as Friend and Puckett (7) and Bower (1).
 While other normalizing procedures could have been used, it was believed
 that this procedure would eliminate seasonality as well as reduce the impact
 of "abnormal" quarters.

 Cross-Sectional Regression Analysis-It was hypothesized that, if in-
 vestors were becoming more socially conscious, companies with better
 pollution ratings would be capitalized more favorably than would companies
 with lower ratings. More specifically, a company's price/earnings ratio
 would tend to be higher relatively if it had a better pollution rating. To test
 this, the following equation was formulated:

 (P/En)i,t a-+b (P/En)l,base + b2Si + e

 where (P/En)i,t is the price-earnings ratio for the ith company in the tth
 quarter, with the earnings normalized by a four-quarter moving average,
 and Si is the ith company's social responsibility measure based upon pollution
 index a multiplied by 100. The purpose of the (P/E)i,base variable is to
 capture and hold constant the firm effects such as growth and risk. The base
 period was six weeks after the March 1971 quarter, approximately three
 months prior to the publication of the Bragdon-Marlin study.

 Cross-section regression analyses were then performed for the above
 model in each of the four quarters subsequent to the base period. As Table
 2 indicates, no positive relationship was found between valuation in later
 periods and a company's pollution rating. Indeed, the trend was just the
 reverse although not statistically significant: the price/earnings ratios of
 the less responsible companies increased.

 These rather contradictory results can be explained primarily by the fact
 that the earnings of the less socially responsible declined more than did
 those of the other companies at a time when the earnings of most paper
 companies declined. That is, normalization by a four-quarter moving aver-
 age still contained too much of the abnormal earnings impact.

 While it would have been possible to use other measures of normalization,
 any such procedure would require a rather subjective process of measure-
 ment. Indeed, it was felt that by successively trying enough normalization
 methods, a "desirable" correlation could be reached; that if 10 measures
 were tried, on the average a "desirable" correlation at the 10 percent level
 of significance would be found. Yet this does not reflect good research.
 Accordingly, rather than forcing a meaningless correlation, further analysis
 was directed to the relationship between relative price changes and insti-
 tutional purchase patterns.

 Mutual Fund Purchase-The quarterly mutual fund purchases for the
 companies within the sample are given in Table 3. There appears to be
 little relationship between the pollution ratings and mutual fund purchases.
 Such purchases appear to be more heavily influenced by other economic
 information. This lack of social discrimination by institutional investors was
 further verified by cross-section regressions performed on the mutual fund
 purchases versus the pollution ratings (independent variable).

 Short-Run Price Performance-Although the above tests and data could

 not discern any long-run price impact, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize
 that a short-run price break might have occurred near the date of the initial
 publicity. Indeed, the prices of those companies labelled polluters might be
 expected to incur a temporary "sell-off"; alternatively, the whole paper
 industry might sell off if investors felt that the publicity applied to the whole
 industry.

 To examine the above hypotheses, daily stock prices were collected on
 each company for a 20-day period-10 days preceding the initial publicity
 (8) and 10 days following. Various adjustments were tried for overall
 market movements. Daily "betas" were calculated for each stock by regres-
 sing the 19 daily price changes on the corresponding daily changes in the
 Standard and Poor's Industrial Average. Additional adjustments were nade
 by utilizing betas supplied by one of the commercial investment services.
 None of these adjustments affected the basic results substantially, and since

 each contains implicit measurement biases, it was decided that unadjusted
 price movements with a graph of the overall Standard and Poor average
 would provide the best information.

 The short-run price changes indicated that the pollution information had
 no discernible impact on the market during the period under study. This
 was true for the individual companies and for the industry as a whole. Both
 Owens-Illinois and Weyerhauser (highest control indexes) declined al-
 most continually-the same price reaction as for Kimberly Clark (lowest
 control index). Crown Zellerbach (third highest indexes) initially declined
 and then rose, essentially following the pattern of the overall market as
 represented by the Standard and Poor's Industrial Average. St. Regis (next
 to worst) showed no decline until the last three days. Naturally, these
 results may indicate that the market had already considered the effect of
 stricter pollution control legislation and its subsequent impact on paper
 company earnings. Yet, when it has been common to see one-day sell-offs in
 industry stocks as a result of unfavorable articles in widely read periodicals,
 it is surprising that no similar reaction is evident for pollution publicity.

 Conclusions

 Often when unfavorable news is announced, a temporary sell-off will
 occur in the cited stock(s). No such sell-off was evidenced when certain
 paper companies were cited as polluters. Little or no effect was found on the
 companies' price valuation, which lends support to Wolozin's (16) request
 for institutional change. Naturally, to the extent that stiffer pollution con-
 trol requirements have been imposed, such controls may be affecting earn-
 ings directly and thus already affecting company valuation. Yet, the results
 are in agreement with the expected results in an efficient capital market
 composed of a majority of "return" conscious investors-that is, while
 socially conscious investors might sell the shares of less socially responsible
 companies, such sales would be viewed as bargains by the return conscious
 investors. Thus, as the shares changed hands, the price would tend toward
 the original risk-return valuation price. This process would continue unless
 the majority of investors became socially conscious. Although such an event
 may occur, it does not appear to exist at the moment. For further evidence
 that institutional investors do not reflect a high social concern in their
 actual investing, see the questionnaire survey of Ryans et al. (14). Recent
 price changes and investor demand appear related to other economic con-
 siderations. Accordingly, this initial empirical research indicates that it may
 be premature to advise managers on the functional relationship between
 social responsibility and present value maxmization (13); such an expected
 relationship, and its implied behavioral response from investors, is a com-
 plex phenomenon, as shown by the empirical results. These results are
 presented as stimulation for further research on this important aspect of
 managerial responsibility.
