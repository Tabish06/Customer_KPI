About This Article

The  two  specific  corporate  environmental
strategies  discussed  here  are  the  “end-of-pipe”
and  the  integrated  pollution  prevention  ap-
proaches, as reflected by the actual physical envi-
ronmental  performance  of  the  companies,  and
following  the  concept  of  environmental  share-
holder value (ESV; Schaltegger & Figge, 2000). 

The research de-
scribed applies mul-
tiple 
regression
analysis to the data
in  order  to  under-
stand  the  relation-
ship  between  the
environmental  and
economic  perfor-
mance of firms. The analysis takes into account
the influence of a number of important control
variables.  These  include  country  of  origin,
processes operated by firms, and firm size.

The  results  of  the  analysis  indicate  that  cor-
porate environmental strategies may have an im-
portant  influence  on  the  relationship  between
environmental and economic performance.

Background: The Relationship between
Environmental and Economic Performance

Win-Win or Profit Reducer? 

Following  the  argument  made  by  Lankoski
(2000)  and  Schaltegger  and  Synnestvedt  (2002),
an inversely U-shaped curve would represent the
best  possible  case  for  the  relationship  between
environmental and economic performance; it al-
lows for the existence of win-win situations with
profitable  environmental  performance  improve-
ment activities.

Alternatively,  if  environmental  performance
improvements  simply  increase  costs  and  reduce
profits for an individual firm, such win-win sce-
narios would not be possible. Under such condi-
tions,  the  optimal  level  of  environmental  per-
formance for a firm would be the one prescribed

by  environmental  regulations—i.e.,  compliance
without overcompliance.

Exhibit  1 summarizes  the  relationship
between  economic  and  environmental  perfor-
mance. 

Weak versus Strict Regulatory Schemes

A unique aspect of the analysis presented here
concerns how environmental regulation interacts
with the model proposed in Exhibit 1. What be-
comes clear is that there are two distinct alterna-
tives, depending on the stringency of the appli-
cable regulations:

•

If  the  regulatory  regime  is  weak,  so  that  the
environmental performance level required by
regulation is below the optimum indicated by
the curve in Exhibit 1, then the optimal level

•

of environmental performance would depend
on  whether  the  “traditionalist”  or  the  “revi-
sionist” view of the environmental/economic
performance  relationship  applies.  Under  the
revisionist  view,  it  would  be  beneficial  (and
thus rational for companies) to improve their
environmental performance beyond the level
required by law, since this would simultane-
ously  improve  their  economic  performance.
By contrast, under the traditionalist view, the
optimum level of environmental performance
would  require  no  more  than  achieving  legal
compliance  with  environmental  and  social
regulations.
If  the  regulatory  regime  is  strict  (the  right
vertical  line  in  Exhibit  1),  then  even  under
the revisionist view, the optimal level of en-
vironmental  performance  should  not  be
higher than prescribed by regulatory compli-
ance obligations, as can be seen from the fact
that the level of environmental performance
that  maximizes  economic  performance  is
lower  than  the  minimum  level  of  environ-
mental  performance  required  by  environ-
mental  regulation.  The  same  conclusions
would  be  reached  under  the  traditionalist
view.  Thus,  in  this  case,  the  outcome  for
both  types  of  curves  would  be  the  same—
that is, the optimal environmental perform-
ance  level  to  choose  is  that  which  just
achieves regulatory compliance.

Accordingly, therefore, analysis of the interac-
tion  between  environmental  regulation  and  the
precise  functional  relationship  between  eco-
nomic  and  environmental  performance  reveals
that  if  regulation  is  weak,  then  firms’  rational
choices  depend  crucially  on  whether  the  firm
faces  (or  thinks  it  faces)  a  revisionist  or  a  tradi-
tionalist relationship between economic and en-
vironmental  performance.  The  same  conclusion
probably holds true in the case of sustainability

performance (which includes both environmen-
tal and social performance aspects).

When Regulation Is Weak: Four Possible
Outcomes for Firms

Based on firms’ differing perceptions of the
relationship  between  economic  and  environ-
mental/sustainability  performance,  and  what
the  factual  link  is  between  the  two,  four  situa-
tions are possible as outcomes when regulation
is weak:

•

•

Four situations are possible as
outcomes when regulation is
weak.

Firms are faced with a traditionalist-type rela-
tionship,  which  they  accurately  perceive:  In
this  case,  firms  generally  will  choose  (based
on the information
available  to  them
and their own per-
ceptions of the sit-
uation)  to  merely
comply  with  the
applicable  regula-
tions, which is the
optimal  choice  for  them  under  the  circum-
stances.
Firms are faced with a traditionalist-type rela-
tionship but perceive that they are facing a re-
visionist-type relationship: In this case, firms
generally will choose (based on their percep-
tion)  to  be  overcompliant,  which  is  not  the
optimal choice under the circumstances.
Firms  are  faced  with  a  revisionist-type  rela-
tionship,  which  they  accurately  perceive:  In
this  case,  firms  generally  will  choose  (based
on  their  perception)  to  be  overcompliant,
which is, in fact, the optimal choice under the
circumstances.
Firms  are  faced  with  a  revisionist-type  rela-
tionship  but  perceive  that  they  face  a  tradi-
tionalist-type  link:  In  this  case,  firms  gener-
ally  will  choose  (based  on  the  information
available to them and their own perceptions

of  the  situation)  to  merely  comply  with  the
applicable regulations, which is not the opti-
mal choice under the circumstances.

When Regulation Is Strict

When regulation is strict, firms generally will
always chose merely to be compliant, regardless
of whether the actual and perceived relationships
differ or are the same.

Strategic Decisions 

The research described in this
article focuses on a nonlinear
specification of the relationship
between environmental and
economic performance. 

Given the possibility that firms may not be able
to  establish  accurately  which  environmental/eco-
nomic  performance  re-
lationship they actually
face,  it  seems  that  in
many cases it would be
most  rational  for  firms
simply to be compliant.
However,  as  will  be
shown, strategic choices
can be a decisive factor
that  may  enable  firms
to create unique competitive advantages from their
striving for sustainability.

Research Methodology

The research described in this article focuses
on  a  nonlinear  specification  of  the  relationship
between  environmental  and  economic  perfor-
mance.  This  type  of  relationship  has  not  previ-
ously been tested empirically.

Two empirical analyses were used to analyze
the question stated earlier (i.e., what is the rela-
tionship  between  the  environmental  and  eco-
nomic performance of firms?). The two analytic
methods are described below.

First Empirical Analysis: Paper Industry Survey
The first empirical analysis used purposive sur-
vey methodology for the paper industry. It focuses
specifically on firms from four European countries

(Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United
Kingdom) in the pulp and paper sector as defined
by the two-digit NACE code (which classifies eco-
nomic activities in the European Union).

For all firms, data on various environmental
performance indicators (EPIs) and financial ratios
were collected. The main EPIs were sulfur dioxide
(SO2) emissions, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions,
chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions, total
energy input, and total water input, all per ton of
paper produced.

In order to use these indicators in the analyses,
two composite indices of the EPIs had to be calcu-
lated, employing a method initially developed by
Jaggi and Freedman (1992) in the adaptation used
in Tyteca et al. (2002). The indicators used to cal-
culate scores for the first (outputs-oriented) index
score  were  SO2,  NOx,  and  COD.  For  the  second
(inputs-oriented)  index  score,  total  energy  input
and total water input were used.

The reason for using two indices was that the
input-oriented  index  relates  more  to  pollution
prevention (which, as will be shown later, is also
linked to a strong ESV orientation). By contrast,
the  output-oriented  index  reflects  more  end-of-
pipe activities. Given that economic performance
in the short term can be approximated through
profitability, such performance was measured in
terms  of  profitability  ratios  like  return  on  sales
(ROS),  return  on  capital  employed  (ROCE),  and
return on equity (ROE). 

Analysis  of  the  relationship  between  firms’
environmental  and  economic  performance  in-
volved an estimation procedure based on a panel
data  model  in  which  environmental  and  eco-
nomic  performances  were  considered  to  have  a
causal  relationship.  The  indicators  used  to  mea-
sure environmental performance were considered
to influence the economic performance variables,
which hence were the endogenous variables.

The analysis uses a pooled model based on or-
dinary least squares (OLS) regression. Accounting

for the panel structure, it also uses and compares
random-effects and fixed-effects panel data mod-
els.  In  order  to  test  the  research  question  using
this  (panel)  regression  framework,  incomplete
panel data were used for a set of 37 paper firms in
four  EU  countries  (Germany,  Italy,  the  Nether-
lands, and the United Kingdom) over the period
from 1995 to 1997.

Exhibit  2 summarizes  all  variables  used  in
the first empirical analysis and their definitions.

Second Empirical Analysis: EBEB Survey Data
for European Manufacturing Firms

The  second  empirical  analysis  used  data  for
European  manufacturing  firms  from  the  Euro-
pean  Business  Environment  Barometer  (EBEB)
survey,  which  allows  a  distinction  to  be  made
among  corporate  environmental  strategies  in
terms  of  companies’  orientation  toward  share-
holder value.

The EBEB is a biannual survey of the state of
environmental management practices carried out
in  several  European  countries  (Baumast  &  Dyl-
lick, 2001). The data used here are from the last
survey round in 2001.

Characterizing Corporate Environmental
Strategies

The  approach  chosen  to  identify  corporate
environmental  strategy  (CES)  was  based  on  the
concept  of  environmental  shareholder  value
(ESV) developed by Schaltegger and Figge (2000).
Basically, the ESV concept argues that the level
of corporate environmental protection in itself nei-
ther spurs nor reduces shareholder value (or other
measures  of  economic  performance).  Rather,  ESV
links environmental performance and shareholder
value in a more differentiated way by means of the
theoretically  derived  value  drivers  of  the  original
shareholder value concept (Rappaport, 1986).

Environmental Quality Management /  Spring 2005  /  35


Firms’  corporate  environmental  strategies
were empirically derived based on a checklist of
shareholder value drivers in their relationship to
environmental management. By means of factor
analysis, eight items from the checklist that were
included in the EBEB survey questionnaire could
be  condensed  into  two  underlying  factors—ex-
pected profitability and variable costs. 

• Expected Profitability

The “expected profitability” from a firm’s en-
vironmental management activities mainly refers
to cost reductions, along with profit margin and
sales increases, better control of capital-intensive
investments,  and  ex-
tension of product and
process lifetimes.

Higher variable costs through
environmental management means
lower exposure to variations in
profitability. 

The  expected  prof-
itability 
factor  was
characterized  by  high
agreement among sur-
vey  respondents  (and,
thus, high factor load-
ings)  with  items  such
as the following: “Through eco-products or eco-
marketing we can achieve above-average market
prices  for  our  current  products”  and  “Eco-
products or eco-marketing help us to sell more of
our current products.”

• Variable Costs

In  the  case  of  the  second  underlying  factor,
one item (variable costs) had a high positive load-
ing. As used here, the term “variable costs” refers
to reduced variability in profitability.

Higher variable costs through environmental
management  (implying,  all  else  being  equal,
lower fixed costs) means lower exposure to varia-
tions in profitability. Therefore, a high score on
the “variable costs” factor equates to a lower fi-
nancial risk exposure for the firm (i.e., lower vari-
ability of firm profitability). 

• Differentiating ESV and Non-ESV Corporate

Environmental Strategies
Based on a cluster analysis of the two under-
lying  ESV-based  factors  (expected  profitability
and  variable  costs),  corporate  environmental
strategies  oriented  strongly  toward  shareholder
value could be differentiated from strategies that
are  not  strongly  oriented  toward  shareholder
value. Accordingly, two separate groups of firms
could be identified.

Exhibit  3 shows  a  coordinate  system  with
the axes defined by the two factors described and
the two clusters of firms.

Measuring Environmental Competitiveness

In addition to identification of firms’ corporate
environmental strategies, the other unique aspect
of this analysis involved measuring their environ-
mental competitiveness. Making this measurement
was  challenging  since  no  commonly  accepted
quantitative definition of the concept exists.

As used in this article, “environmental com-
petitiveness” is defined as that part of the overall
competitiveness of a firm that can actually be in-
fluenced  by  environmental  management  activi-
ties.  Environmental  competitiveness  is  being
used here as a measure of economic performance.
Few quantitative data are available on the en-
vironmental competitiveness of individual com-
panies.  Instead,  the  approach  used  in  this  re-
search relied on self-assessment by firms based on
a number of items. This approach also was used
by Sharma (2001) in a similar context.

For purposes of the research reported here, en-
vironmental  competitiveness  was  measured  by
means of an item battery asking about the effect
of environmental management activities on dif-
ferent  items  such  as  competitive  advantage  or
corporate image enhancement.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was car-
ried  out  on  the  environmental  competitiveness
items used in the survey. This allowed for identi-

fication  of  several  different  dimensions  of  envi-
ronmental competitiveness, as follows.

• Market-Oriented Environmental

Competitiveness
The  first  dimension  of  environmental  com-
petitiveness  includes  competitive  advantage,
product image, sales, market share, and new mar-
ket  opportunities.  This  dimension  has  been  la-
beled  “market-oriented  environmental  competi-
tiveness”  since  it  predominantly  relates  to  the
market-  and  product-related  benefits  of  a  com-
pany’s environmental activities.

• Internal/Image-Oriented Environmental

Competitiveness
The second dimension of environmental com-
petitiveness  includes  corporate  image,  owner/

shareholder satisfaction, management satisfaction,
worker satisfaction, and recruitment and staff re-
tention.  This  factor  was  labeled  “internal/image-
oriented environmental competitiveness” since it
mainly refers to the internally oriented satisfaction
and company image benefits resulting from a com-
pany’s environmental activities, based on a specific
corporate environmental strategy.

• Efficiency/Profitability-Oriented
Environmental Competitiveness
The third dimension of environmental com-
petitiveness includes short- and long-term prof-
its,  cost  savings,  and  productivity.  Since  these
factors predominantly affect the profitability of
a  company,  the  dimension  was  labeled  “effi-
ciency/profitability-oriented  environmental
competitiveness.”

Sustainability and Competitive Advantage

Environmental Quality Management /  Spring 2005  /  37


• Influence of Environmental Risk on

Financial Conditions
Two  remaining  items,  “improved  insurance
conditions”  and  “better  access  to  bank  loans,”
could not be assigned to one of the three factors
outlined above. However, it is clear that they po-
tentially  represent  a  fourth  dimension  of  envi-
ronmental competitiveness.

Both are linked to the financial exposure that
a company experiences because of its level of en-
vironmental risk. For this reason, the two items
were treated as a fourth factor labeled “influence
of environmental risk on financial conditions.”

• Environmental Competitiveness Indices

Given that the second empirical
analysis concerns cross-sectional
data, OLS is an efficient estimation
method. 

For  further  analysis,  indices  were  calculated
based  on  the  dimen-
sions identified above.
The  indices  related  to
the  four  independent
dimensions  of  envi-
ronmental  competi-
tiveness  along  which
firms  can  position
themselves:  market
benefits, satisfaction and reputation, profitability
and efficiency, and risk reduction. 

• Self-Assessment Survey Responses 

Environmental performance was measured in
terms of an index assessing the reduction of firms’
environmental impacts in a number of categories
(such  as  energy  or  water  use,  or  use  of  toxic  in-
puts), each measured by a separate item variable.
For each of the items, the survey asked about
the  degree  to  which  environmental  manage-
ment activities over the years 1998–2000 had re-
duced the company’s environmental impact for
this variable during the period studied. Respon-
dents were asked to provide answers on a five-
point Likert scale (ranging from “no reduction”
and  “little  reduction”  to  “average  reduction,”

“strong  reduction,”  and  “very  strong  reduc-
tion”), with the highest score corresponding to
the largest reduction.

Prior  to  completing  the  statistical  analysis
discussed next, it was established that the sam-
ple  of  respondents  used  was  representative  of
both  Germany  and  the  United  Kingdom  in
terms  of  firm  size  and  sector  distribution  of
firms. The sample consisted of the 301 valid re-
sponses to the EBEB survey received from man-
ufacturing  companies  in  the  United  Kingdom
(135) and in Germany (166).

• Statistical Analysis Methodology

Since 25 independent variables were used in
the regression analysis, data for the United King-
dom and Germany were pooled. Given that the
second  empirical  analysis  concerns  cross-
sectional  data,  OLS  is  an  efficient  estimation
method. The multiple linear regression equation
estimated via OLS is defined as follows:

Environmental  competitiveness  dimension  i
=  linear  additive  function  (firm  size,  square  of
firm  size,  sector  dummies,  country  dummies,
market  growth  rate,  firm  age,  legal  ownership
form, overall profit, dummies for level of EMS im-
plementation,  environmental  impact  reduction
index, square of environmental impact reduction
index) plus residual value

overall. The hypothesis that no fixed effects exist
for any firm was rejected.

The  results  were  analyzed  separately  for  the
three  measures  of  economic  performance  used.
These  were  return  on  capital  employed  (ROCE),
return  on  sales  (ROS),  and  return  on  equity
(ROE).  The  Breusch-Pagan  Lagrange  Multiplier
and the Wu-Hausman specification tests were ap-
plied to determine the most appropriate model.
As can be seen from Exhibit 5, for ROCE as
a dependent variable used to measure economic
performance, the model with fixed effects (FE) is
the best specification, since the Wu-Hausman test
is  significant.  The  FE  model  is  also  significant

In the model, the linear term of the environ-
mental index is significant (at the 1 percent level)
and  has  a  positive  effect  on  ROCE.  In  addition,
the  squared  term  of  the  environmental  index
with a level of 10.4 percent is also almost signifi-
cant (at the 10 percent level) and has a negative
effect on ROCE.

The result is also economically relevant, since
a  10  percent  increase  in  environmental  perfor-
mance  increases  ROCE  by  3.3  percent,  all  else
being equal. (The large size of the increase in Ex-
hibit 5 is due to the environmental index taking

only values between zero and one.) The squared
term also is economically relevant.

The  level  of  environmental  performance  that
maximizes ROCE in the FE model is equal to an
index value of 0.12. With the index taking values
between zero and one, this corresponds to a rela-
tively low level of environmental performance. See
Wagner (2005) for details on all other variables.

With  respect  to  ROS  as  a  measure  of  firms’
economic  performance,  it  was  found  that  the
fixed-effects  specification  is  most  appropriate
(since  the  Wu-Hausman  test  is  significant).  Re-
sults  show  that  the  linear  term  of  the  environ-
mental performance index has a positive but in-
significant effect on ROS, while the squared term
of the index has a significant and negative effect.
This is also relevant in economic terms: a 10
percent  increase  in  environmental  performance
reduces ROS by 7.2 percent, all else being equal.

The  level  of  environmental  performance  that
maximizes ROS in the fixed effects model corre-
sponds to an index value of 0.0188.

It thus corresponds to an even lower level of
environmental performance than was the case for
ROCE, which is consistent with the observation
that only a significant negative effect of environ-
mental on economic performance exists for ROS.
For  the  estimations  with  ROE  as  the  depen-
dent  variable,  similar  findings  were  made  as  for
ROS.  Here  again,  fixed  effects  were  found  to  be
the most appropriate model. As was the case with
ROS, the linear term of the index had a positive,
yet insignificant, effect on ROE.

By  contrast,  the  squared  term  had  a  signifi-
cant  negative  effect  on  ROE,  with  the  ROE-
maximizing level of environmental performance
corresponding to an index value of 0.0353. This
effect is also relevant in economic terms, since a

10  percent  increase  in  environmental  perfor-
mance reduces ROE by 22.6 percent, all else being
equal. See also Wagner (2005) for further details
on the results. 

Input-Related Environmental Performance
Index 

For the input-related index of environmental
performance (driven by strategies based on inte-
grated pollution prevention), with ROCE as a de-
pendent  variable  measuring  economic  perform-
ance,  the  model  with  random  effects  (RE)  was
found to be the best specification, as indicated by
an  insignificant  Hausman  test.  The  fixed-effects
model  is  not  better  than  the  random-effects
model in that the estimated coefficients are not
significantly different between the two models.

Even though the Breusch-Pagan test is insignif-
icant,  the  random-effects  model  is  still  preferred
over the pooled model, since the former is signifi-
cant overall, but the latter is not. In the RE model,
the linear term of the environmental index, as well
as its squared term, are insignificant.

With respect to ROS, the results indicate that
the pooled model is most appropriate, since the
Breusch-Pagan  test  is  insignificant  and  only  the
pooled model is significant overall. In the pooled
model, however, the linear and the squared terms
for the environmental performance index are in-
significant (Wagner, 2005). 

Finally, concerning ROE as a dependent vari-
able, none of the models estimated are significant
overall, nor are the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan
tests. In the pooled and the random-effects mod-
els, the linear and squared terms of the environ-
mental performance index and of firm size were
found to be insignificant.

Overall Results of the First Empirical Analysis
The  first  empirical  analysis  testing  the  re-
search  question  posed  in  this  article  found  a
predominantly  negative  relationship  between

environmental  and  economic  performance  in
the  case  of  an  emissions-based  index.  In  the
case  of  an  inputs-based  index,  no  significant
link was found.

Based  on  these  results,  it  can  be  concluded
that the relationship between environmental and
economic performance is less negative (i.e., bet-
ter) for firms with pollution prevention–oriented
environmental strategies than for those with an
end-of-pipe focus.

The relationship between
environmental and economic
performance is less negative (i.e.,
better) for firms with pollution
prevention–oriented environmental
strategies than for those with an
end-of-pipe focus.

For  this  analysis,  regressions  were  carried  out
separately for the two sets of firms with and with-
out  a  shareholder  value–oriented  corporate  envi-
ronmental strategy based on the regression equa-
tion described earlier. Regressions also were carried
out separately for the four different environmental
competitiveness dimensions identified above.

Market-Oriented Index

In  the  case  of  the  environmental  competi-
tiveness  index  relating  to  market-  and  product-
oriented  benefits  from  environmental  manage-
ment, the OLS model was significant overall for
the set of firms with an ESV-oriented CES, but in-
significant for the set of firms without a specific
ESV orientation.

Sustainability and Competitive Advantage

Environmental Quality Management /  Spring 2005  /  41


A significant positive effect for the linear term
of  the  environmental  performance  index  was
found  for  the  set  of  firms  with  an  ESV-oriented
CES, but not for the set of firms without a specif-
ically  ESV-oriented  CES.  See  Wagner  (2005)  for
further details. 

Internal/Image-Related Index

Exhibit 6 summarizes the results for the in-
ternal/image-related  index  of  environmental
competitiveness as an independent variable. For
easier  reading,  insignificant  results  for  industry
sector dummy variables are suppressed here and
in Exhibit 7.

In  the  case  of  this  environmental  competi-
tiveness dimension, which relates to internal sat-
isfaction  and  company  internal/image-related
benefits  from  environmental  management,  the
model  was  found  to  be  significant  overall  for
both subsets of firms. Thus, the results reject the
hypothesis, based on the model’s F statistic, that
all coefficients are jointly zero.

Most importantly, in the subset of firms with
an ESV-oriented CES, the environmental impact

reduction index was found to have a significant
positive effect (at the 5 percent level). The square
of the index was found to have a significant neg-
ative effect (at the 1 percent level). No significant
index influence was found for the subset of firms
without  a  specific  ESV  orientation  in  their  CES,
indicating  a  more  positive  link  for  the  ESV-
oriented strategy.

Efficiency/Profitability-Related Index

For  the  third  dimension  of  environmental
competitiveness, relating to efficiency/profitabil-
ity,  only  the  model  estimated  for  the  subset  of
firms  with  an  ESV-oriented  CES  was  significant
overall (1 percent level). For this model, the envi-
ronmental  index  was  found  to  be  positive  and
significant (at the 10 percent level, with its nega-
tive square almost significant). The index was in-
significant for the other set of firms.

Environmental Risk-Related Index

Finally, for the fourth dimension of environ-
mental competitiveness, relating to the influence
of  environmental  risk  on  financial  conditions,

both models (for the subset of firms with an ESV-
oriented  CES,  as  well  as  for  the  subset  of  firms
without  a  specific  ESV  orientation)  were  signifi-
cant overall (at the 5 percent and 10 percent lev-
els, respectively). These results are summarized in
Exhibit 7.

For the subset of ESV-oriented firms, the envi-
ronmental  impact  reduction  index  (which  is  of
particular relevance to the research question ana-
lyzed in this article) was found to have a signifi-
cant positive influence at the 10 percent level.

For the subset of firms with no particular ESV
orientation,  neither  the  linear  nor  the  squared
term  of  environmental  impact  reduction  had
any  significant  influence  on  the  financial  risk-
related  dimension  of  environmental  competi-
tiveness. See Wagner (2005) for more details on
all other variables.

Overall Results of the Second Empirical
Analysis

out on the subset of firms with an environmental
shareholder value-oriented CES, the environmen-
tal impact reduction index was found to have a
significant and positive influence on the various
environmental  competitiveness  dimensions
(market-oriented,  internal/image-related,  prof-
itability-related, and risk-related).

For 

firms  not  pursuing  a  shareholder
value–oriented corporate environmental strategy,
environmental  performance  had  (after  control-
ling for other relevant influences) no significant
relationship with any of the four dimensions of
environmental competitiveness identified.

These  results  indicate  that  strategy  choice
does make a difference. Firms that actively pursue
a  shareholder  value–oriented  CES  seem  more
likely to achieve a positive relationship between
environmental  and  economic  performance.  By
contrast, companies that do not actively pursue
such a strategy seem less likely to achieve such a
positive relationship.

The  overall  results  of  the  second  empirical
analysis show that for all four regressions carried

cussed later in this article. This lends further sup-
port to the consistency of the analytical results, as
well as pointing to the weaknesses of the end-of-
pipe focus.

The  results  reported  here  do  not  preclude  a
company  from  pursuing  a  corporate  environ-
mental strategy that is not specifically focused on
shareholder  value.  The  results  imply,  however,
that a positive link between environmental and
economic  performance  would  be  less  likely  to
arise in such a case. 

In  order  to  clarify  the  link  between  the  first
and  the  second  empirical  analysis  and  between
ESV  and  a  pollution  prevention  orientation,  a
cluster  analysis  was  also  carried  out  on  the  ESV
items used in the EBEB questionnaire for the set
of paper firms in the first empirical analysis. Un-
fortunately,  these  firms  were  surveyed  on  their
ESV  orientation  after  the  initial  data  collection,
so that not all firms provided this additional in-
formation. Exhibit 8 summarizes the responses.
Given the low number of firms, PCA was not
necessary, and the cluster analysis was carried out
using the above items directly. As for the EBEB set
of  firms,  the  two-cluster  solution  distinguishes

two sets of firms that have significantly different
ESV orientation. For the basic indicators used to
construct  the  inputs-  and  outputs-oriented  in-
dices of the first analysis above, tests were carried
out for significant differences in the mean values
of  the  indicators  between  the  two  sets  of  firms,
the results being summarized in Exhibit 9.

As can be seen from Exhibit 9, only the dif-
ference for water use significantly favors the ESV-
oriented firms. This means that firms pursuing an
ESV-oriented strategy are not significantly penal-
ized in terms of their economic performance, but
show  generally  equal  or  better  environmental
performance compared to firms without an ESV
orientation.

Key Conclusions

The  first  empirical  analysis  reported  here  ap-
plies panel regression models to data on the Euro-
pean  paper  industry.  Results  from  this  analysis
confirm  the  inversely  U-shaped  relationship  be-
tween environmental and economic performance
that was suggested at the beginning of this article
for  an  output-oriented  environmental  perfor-
mance index in the fixed effects models. Lankoski

(2000)  also  provides  a  theoretical  justification  of
such a relationship. The positive part of the rela-
tionship was found to be relatively weak, however.
For  the  input-oriented  environmental  per-
formance  index,  where  the  pooled  models  are
most  appropriate,  no  significant  relationship
could be detected.

From  these  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that
for firms with pollution prevention-oriented en-
vironmental strategies, the relationship between
environmental  and  economic  performance  is
more positive (or less negative).

Expanding on the first empirical analysis, the
second  empirical  analysis  used  a  set  of  novel
measures  for  environmental  competitiveness.  It
was  based  on  two  portfolios  of  firms  that  were
matched for industry membership, country loca-
tion, and firm size.

The  measures  chosen  were  intended  to  ad-
dress  the  criticisms  raised  by  Lankoski  (2000).
Lankoski argues that any causal effect of environ-
mental  performance  on  overall  economic  per-
formance is likely small, and thus difficult to de-
tect  with  common  measures  of  overall  or
aggregated economic performance.

The  results  of  the  second  empirical  analysis
indicate  that  for  all  four  regressions  carried  out
on  the  subset  of  firms  with  an  environmental
shareholder  value–oriented  CES,  the  environ-
mental  impact  reduction  index  was  found  to
have a significant and positive influence on the
various  environmental  competitiveness  dimen-
sions 
(i.e.,  market-oriented,
internal/image-related,  profitability-related,  and
risk-related).

considered 

By contrast, for all four regressions carried out
on the subset of firms without a specific ESV ori-
entation  in  their  corporate  environmental  strat-
egy,  the  environmental  impact  reduction  index
was  found  to  have  no  significant  influence  on
any  of  the  four  environmental  competitiveness
dimensions analyzed.

Thus, for firms that are not pursuing a value-
oriented corporate environmental strategy, envi-
ronmental performance has (after controlling for
other relevant influences) no significant relation-
ship with any of the four dimensions of environ-
mental competitiveness identified.

This indicates that strategy choice makes a dif-
ference: Firms that actively pursue a shareholder

Sustainability and Competitive Advantage

value–oriented CES seem most likely to achieve a
positive relationship between environmental and
economic performance. By contrast, firms that do
not actively pursue such a strategy seem less likely
to create such a positive relationship.

Overall,  the  research  reported  here  shows
that,  depending  on  the  specific  conditions  that
exist  within  a  firm,  it  is  possible  to  find  a  pre-
dominantly positive, a mainly neutral (that is, in-
significant),  or  a  predominantly  negative  rela-
tionship  between  environmental  and  economic
performance  (or,  alternatively,  environmental
competitiveness).

It is possible to find a
predominantly positive, a mainly
neutral or a predominantly negative
relationship between environmental
and economic performance.

This also implies that both theoretically derived
conceptions  of  the  en-
vironmental/economic
performance  relation-
ship—the  “traditional-
ist”  and  the  “revision-
ist”  views—have  their
merits, but under differ-
ent conditions. 

Recommendations for Action

The question posed at the beginning of this ar-
ticle concerned the relationship between environ-
mental and economic performance, and whether
the choice of a (ESV-oriented) corporate environ-
mental strategy has a significant effect on it.

The analysis reported here shows that in en-
vironmentally  intensive  industries,  such  as
paper  manufacturing,  it  may  be  difficult  for  a
firm to achieve a positive relationship between
the  two.  But  the  task  is  made  easier  when  the
firm focuses on integrated pollution prevention
(which can be viewed as one particular type of
ESV-oriented CES).

The analysis also indicates that for firms with
a  strategy  based  on  the  environmental  share-
holder  value  concept,  the  relationship  between
environmental performance and different dimen-

sions  of  environmental  competitiveness  is  more
positive than for firms without such a strategy. 

The commonly held view is that the amount
of environmental protection (or, more precisely,
the  level  of  environmental  performance  related
to this amount) is negatively or positively related
in a simple and straightforward way to the eco-
nomic  performance  (or,  more  specifically,  envi-
ronmental  competitiveness)  of  firms.  The  re-
search reported here refutes this view. Instead, it
empirically confirms the theoretical argument of
ESV—i.e., that the relationship strongly depends
on factors internal to the company.

Of particular relevance are the corporate envi-
ronmental strategies and resulting environmental
management activities pursued by the company.
These emerge as major internal factors that influ-
ence  the  relationship  between  environmental
and economic performance.

For  a  defined  level  of  environmental  perfor-
mance,  according  to  ESV  theory,  economic  per-
formance can be improved to a greater degree if
the environmental management activities of the
company  are  linked  to  the  key  drivers  of  share-
holder value. 

High levels of environmental competitiveness
can be achieved simultaneously with high levels of
environmental  performance  only  if  a  company’s
environmental management activities—resulting
from its (ideally ESV-oriented) CES—have a posi-
tive effect (or a minimized detrimental effect) on
the  drivers  of  shareholder  value.  The  challenge
here, of course, lies in defining appropriate tools
to realize this outcome.

End-of-Pipe versus Pollution Prevention
Approaches 

According  to  Rappaport  (1986)  and  Schal-
tegger  and  Figge  (2000),  the  important  share-
holder  value  drivers  are  investments  in  current
and  fixed  assets,  profit  margin,  cost  of  capital,

46 /  Spring 2005  /  Environmental Quality Management

Marcus Wagner


and the value growth duration (i.e., the time pe-
riod  during  which  a  competitive  advantage  can
be sustained).

End-of-pipe environmental activities (such as
flue gas desulphurization) often require large in-
vestments in fixed assets (possibly also increasing
the cost of capital), and thus have a detrimental
effect on this driver of shareholder value. 

Accordingly, one would expect an end-of-pipe
environmental  strategy  (leading  to  improve-
ments  mainly  in  the  undesired  outputs  of  pro-
duction  processes,  such  as  emissions  to  air  and
water)  to  result  in  few  positive  effects,  or  even
negative  effects,  on  economic  performance  (as
was found in the first empirical analysis). Thus, a
corporate environmental strategy based on end-
of-pipe  activities  cannot  be  considered  an  ESV-
oriented strategy.

By contrast, efficiency improvements brought
about  by  means  of  integrated  pollution  preven-
tion often do not require additional investments,
and may result in reduced operating costs, thereby
increasing  profit  margins  (Schaltegger  &  Figge,
2000). Pollution prevention can encompass activ-
ities such as improvements in the efficiency of a
company’s  energy  or  water  use,  or  increased  re-
source efficiency (that is, reduced amounts of pro-
duction input per unit of product output). 

Corporate environmental strategies that focus
on environmental management activities, which
lead to efficiency improvements, including inte-
grated  pollution  prevention–based  strategies,
thus have a strong ESV orientation. This is partic-
ularly true from a material flow perspective, be-
cause efficiency gains may also result in indirect
cost reductions that can be revealed by methods
such as activity-based costing.

Adopting an ESV Orientation

Based on the research results reported here, it
is  recommended  that  companies  cross-check

their  corporate  environmental  strategies  against
the principles of the ESV concept. With the rele-
vance of ESV empirically validated, this compari-
son can provide valuable top-down guidance for
strategy development.

A company can also screen its environmen-
tal management activities based on the drivers
of  shareholder  value  in  order  to  obtain  a  bot-
tom-up  perspective  on  the  degree  to  which  its
activities  create  economic  value  and  improve
competitiveness.

Such  screening  (which  should  focus  particu-
larly on the significant differences between end-
of-pipe vs. integrated pollution prevention activ-
ities) can guide corporate environmental strategy
development.
