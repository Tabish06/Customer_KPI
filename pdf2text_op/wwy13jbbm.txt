ABSTRACT Purpose: Extant literature has devoted more attention to customer value
co-creation and knowledge sharing, not only in business-to-customer (B2C) markets,
but also in business-to-business (B2B) markets. This study explores and examines the
antecedents and consequences of customer knowledge sharing in the context of B2B
markets by applying the motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework.
Methodology/Approach: This empirical study involves two structured surveys of
project managers from both suppliers (n = 213) and customers (n = 312), which
were conducted in the context of the Chinese telecommunication service industry.
The conceptual model of this study was subsequently tested by developing Partial
Least Squares (PLS) based structural equation models.

Findings: It was found that customer knowledge sharing is facilitated by four MOA
factors: customer orientation, customer perceived beneﬁts, customer socialization,
and customer technological capability. It was determined that knowledge sharing
has a direct and signiﬁcant effect on project performance. Furthermore, the study
revealed that such relationships vary across suppliers and customers.

Research Implications: This study extends the existing research stream of inter-
ﬁrm knowledge sharing by examining the antecedents and consequences of customer
knowledge sharing from dual perspectives of customers and suppliers, and sheds light
on the beneﬁts of customer knowledge sharing. The dyadic perspective embodied
in this design facilitates our understanding and management of knowledge sharing
between organizations.

Originality/Value/Contribution: This article provides an important contribution
to the existing literature of customer knowledge sharing by revealing how to effec-
tively facilitate interorganizational knowledge sharing, particularly knowledge from
customers to suppliers, and discovers conditions under which customers are more
likely to exchange information, and share knowledge with their suppliers from the
dyadic perspective.

How to more effectively enable customers to share knowl-
edge with their suppliers has been a perennially compelling
issue in the literature of knowledge management for more
than three decades (e.g., Lausen and Salter 2006; von
Hippel 1976, 1986). Previous research demonstrates that
customers, especially lead users, can not merely perceive
the future necessity of an innovation but may even invent
what they need by themselves or in conjunction with their
suppliers (von Hippel 1976, 1986). Thus, knowledge
embedded on the customer side of the equation can
be an important source for product innovation (Grifﬁn
and Hauser 1993;Thomke and von Hippel 2002), and
customers are increasingly seen as a ﬁrm’s co-producers
and co-creators of products and services (e.g., Vargo and
Lusch 2004; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Hoyer
et al. 2010). Accordingly, ﬁrms striving for various ways
of identifying, learning, and absorbing new knowledge
possessed by their customers are more likely to achieve
high innovativeness and sustainable competitive advantage
(Cohen and Levinthal 1990).

Customers, however, are not obliged to share knowl-
edge with their suppliers, and their interests may not be
well aligned with those of their suppliers. As evidenced by
Morrison, Roberts, and von Hippel (2000), more than half
of the libraries in the Australian community prefer not to
share their own modiﬁcations with their system suppliers.
Furthermore, if customers perceive that such knowledge
sharing behaviors weakens their competitive advantage,
they may even impose secrecy on their new ideas or new
solutions (Hansen, Mors, and Lovas 2005; Tsai 2002).
Therefore, ﬁrms must understand how to induce and
enable customers to share knowledge easily. Unfortunately,
research on how to effectively facilitate interorganizational
knowledge sharing, especially knowledge from customers
to suppliers, has not received enough attention (Lawson,
Petersen, Cousins, and Handﬁeld 2009). Consequently,
conditions under which customers are more likely to
exchange information, and share knowledge with their
suppliers, remain unclear.

The present study attempts to bridge this research gap
by applying the well recognized motivation-opportunity-
ability (MOA) framework to examine antecedents and
consequences of customer knowledge sharing in the
context of high-technology industries (Rothschild 1999).
This study deﬁnes customer knowledge sharing as the
extent to which customers exchange their own infor-
mation, ideas, and expertise with their suppliers. Based
on this MOA framework, we argue that customers are
more likely to share knowledge with their suppliers when

228

they have incentives, opportunities, and capabilities to
exchange (Ahuja 2000). Consequently, we identify factors
from extant research that inﬂuence customer knowledge
sharing,
including customer orientation, customer per-
ceived beneﬁts, customer
socialization, and customer
technological capability.

This article makes both theoretical and empirical con-
tributions to the existing literature on knowledge sharing.
First, this study focuses speciﬁcally on knowledge ﬂow
from customers to suppliers, an aspect that has received
limited attention in the literature. Second, by applying
the MOA framework, this study adopts a more holis-
tic perspective to investigate customer knowledge sharing.
Although previous research has discussed, to some extent,
the incentives, opportunities, and capabilities of knowl-
edge sharing, most studies examine only part of the MOA
framework. They thus lack a comprehensive overview
of customer knowledge sharing. Finally, most studies on
knowledge sharing sample either from suppliers or cus-
tomers (although Im and Rai 2008 is an exception), and
it is unclear whether suppliers and customers have sim-
ilar views as to how to induce and facilitate customer
knowledge sharing. This study addresses this limitation
by sampling from both parties and makes comparisons of
empirical ﬁndings between the two groups.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Customer Co-Creation and Customer

Knowledge Sharing

The wide adoption of new information technologies
has redeﬁned the roles that customers play in innova-
tion and value creation (e.g., Nambisan and Baron 2009).
Customers are increasingly involved in the development
of new products and processes in both consumer mar-
kets and industrial markets, and the research of customer
co-creation has gained growing attention from different
academic areas (von Hippel 1976, 1986, 2004; Morrison,
Roberts, and von Hippel 2000; Thomke and von Hippel
2002). Co-creation can be deﬁned as activities in which cus-
tomers are involved related to the design and production of
superior value they desire by using their knowledge and/or
other resources in conjunction with either peer customers,
or ﬁrms (e.g., suppliers), who also seek value creation
(Vargo and Lusch 2004; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004;
Hoyer et al. 2010). The value achieved from such a co-
creation process shifts from a ﬁrm-centric perspective,
which emphasizes the quality of a ﬁrm’s products and

service, to personalized customer experiences, in which
the importance of customer knowledge sharing is widely
acknowledged and well documented in current literature.
Two broad streams of literature have explored the impact
of customer knowledge on suppliers’ new product devel-
opment and market performance. The open innovation
literature suggests a porous organizational boundary for
product innovation and argues in favor of active commu-
nication between a focal ﬁrm and its connected parties
(Chesbrough 2003). Compared to the traditional research
and development (R&D) model that emphasizes self-
reliance and internal R&D for new ideas and product
innovations, the open innovation model suggests that ﬁrms
can use both internal and external pathways to generate
and commercialize their new products (Chesbrough 2003).
This is because useful knowledge elements are generally
widespread in society (Hayek 1945), and a single organiza-
tion cannot generate and use all relevant knowledge due to
the effects of bounded rationality and limited resources.
Consequently, ﬁrms operating in this contemporary era
have to identify, absorb, and integrate external knowledge
to gain and maintain competitive advantage (Cohen and
Levinthal 1990).

Researchers preferring the open innovation model
suggest that knowledge from customers is a critical exter-
nal source for innovation (e.g., Chesbrough 2003). For
instance, Chesbrough (2003) illustrated the importance of
customer knowledge, citing the example of Intuit which
has developed and maintained a close and disciplined
relationship with its customers
to understand what,
precisely,
its customers need and how to satisfy those
needs using externally acquired technologies. Laursen
and Salter (2006) provided some empirical evidence on
the open innovation model by linking external search
depth and breadth to innovative performance among U.K.
manufacturing ﬁrms. They generate a list of 16 external
sources from which a ﬁrm may obtain knowledge. The
source of clients or customers is ranked second in terms of
reference usage. Therefore, both theoretical and empirical
evidence shows that customer knowledge contributes to
ﬁrm performance, in the area of, for example, new product
innovation.

The second stream of literature on customer knowledge
sharing relates to user innovation research, which origi-
nates from the observation that users, rather than suppliers,
can be the source of commercially important new prod-
ucts and processes (von Hippel 1976). As observed by von
Hippel in the scientiﬁc instruments industry, users not
only perceive future development of instrumentation but

also invent and build new prototypes, and even distribute
their inventions (von Hippel 1976). To follow such inno-
vative progress, suppliers must encourage their users to
share inventions and transfer knowledge from their users.
Von Hippel (1976) concluded that it is the lead users,
rather than all users, who contribute most to new products
and processes. He deﬁned lead users as “users whose
present strong needs will become general in a marketplace
months or years in the future” (von Hippel 1986: 791).
Compared to non-lead users, lead users tend to have a
higher level of leading-edge status, in-house technical skills
and incentives to modify existing solutions (Morrison
et al. 2000). Lilien and his colleague (2002) demonstrated
that ﬁrms systematically using lead user processes can
facilitate their new product development and generate
better sales from new products. All these ﬁndings provide
evidence on the importance of learning from lead users
about their needs and solutions, during which process
user knowledge sharing is an indispensable element. Given
the tacit nature of technological know-how and personal
experiences, it is difﬁcult for a focal ﬁrm to learn and
transfer customer knowledge and inventions without
cooperation from its customers (Kogut and Zander 1992).
Thus, it is urgent for ﬁrms to understand the conditions
under which their customers are willing to share and
exchange their proprietary knowledge.

The MOA Framework and

Knowledge Sharing

The MOA framework aims to explain the factors that
drive a person or an organization to engage in a speciﬁc
behavior (Rothschild 1999). The ﬁrst driver is motiva-
tion, which refers to the desire or readiness to perform a
behavior. There are many factors that can inﬂuence per-
sonal motivation, such as proper incentives (Ferrin and
Dirks 2003), group norms (Blumberg and Pringle 1982;
Szulanski, Capetta, and Jensen 2004), and so on. The
second driver is opportunity, which refers to a variety
of environmental and contextual mechanisms that enable
the behavior. This includes communication tools, work-
ing conditions, and organizational policies (Blumberg and
Pringle 1982). The third driver is ability, which refers to
the skills or knowledge base related to the action. In gen-
eral, the MOA framework argues that an organization
tends to perform a speciﬁc behavior when it has the moti-
vation, opportunity, and ability to engage in that behavior.
Until now, the MOA framework has been widely
used in management research, including topics such as

Customer Participation, Knowledge Sharing, and Firm Performance

human resource management policy adoption (Katou and
Budhwar 2010), advertising repetition (Batra and Ray
1986), small ﬁrm growth (Davidsson 1991), and inter-
ﬁrm linkage formation (Ahuja 2000). Researchers also
use this framework to study the issue of knowledge shar-
ing. For instance, Siemsen, Roth, and Balasubramanian
(2008) focused on informal knowledge sharing among
individual employees within a workgroup and ﬁnd that
motivation, opportunity, and ability, taken together, drive
knowledge sharing behavior. Fey and Furu (2008) inves-
tigated only the impact of the motivational factor on
knowledge sharing among a multinational company’s sub-
sidiaries. Their study shows that when managers’ incentive
pay is aligned with the collective performance of the MNC,
knowledge sharing among units is more likely to hap-
pen. Similarly, Quigley, Tesluk, Locke, and Bartol (2007)
looked at how motivational mechanisms facilitate knowl-
edge sharing among managers and concluded that group
incentive systems and group norms jointly inﬂuence the
level of managerial knowledge sharing. In general, existing
literature supports the importance of the MOA frame-
work in explaining the behavior of knowledge sharing.
However, extant research on knowledge sharing across
organizational boundaries, especially across vertical levels,
is rather limited.

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES
According to the MOA framework, when a focal ﬁrm
tries to induce its customers to share knowledge, it has to
ensure satisfaction of three key conditions: First, whether
a customer has enough incentives to share knowledge;
second, whether a customer has enough opportunities to
interact with representatives from a focal ﬁrm; and third,
whether a customer has something innovative to share.
This study identiﬁes four important factors from exist-
ing literature that relate to the motivation, opportunity,
and ability of a focal ﬁrm’s customers in terms of knowl-
edge sharing: customer orientation, customer perceived
beneﬁts, customer socialization, and customer technolog-
ical capability. The following segment examines in detail
the impacts of these four factors on customer knowledge
sharing and subsequent outcomes.

Customer Orientation

The ﬁrst motivational factor related to customer knowl-
edge sharing is customer orientation, which refers to the
extent to which a supplier emphasizes the importance

230

of identifying and fulﬁlling customer needs (Kohli and
Jaworski 1990). Such a focus on customer needs cor-
responds to increasing competitive intensity and envi-
ronmental dynamism. As Narver and Slater (1990) have
argued, a customer-oriented ﬁrm is more likely to estab-
lish an organizational culture “that most effectively and
efﬁciently creates the necessary behaviors for the cre-
ation of superior value for buyers and, thus, continuous
superior performance for the business” (p. 21). Similarly,
Deshpande and Farley (1998) concluded that ﬁrms with
customer orientation are more likely to discover cus-
tomer needs, genuinely care about customer satisfaction,
and offer superior quality products and services. In sum,
a ﬁrm with a “customer orientation” tends to prioritize
its customers’ interests and organize its activities to ful-
ﬁll customers’ expressed and latent needs (Narver, Slater,
and MacLachlan 2004). The literature has shown that
customer orientation helps ﬁrms improve innovativeness,
sales growth, and proﬁtability (e.g., Atuahene-Gima 1995;
Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Slater and Narver 1994).

Applying the concept of customer orientation to the
setting of customer knowledge sharing, we argue that
customers are more likely to exchange information and
share knowledge with customer-oriented suppliers com-
pared with those who pay no attention to customers. This
is because when a supplier is customer-oriented, it priori-
tizes customer interests and develops a series of programs
and activities to both understand and satisfy the customer’s
needs; this process lays a solid foundation for knowledge
sharing with each other. Furthermore, customer-oriented
suppliers always tend to react quickly to the demands and
feedback of their customers and create more channels or
opportunity to exchange knowledge with customers. This
usually stimulates a consultative, open, collaborative, and
two-way dialogue between suppliers and customers (Saxe
and Weitz 1982), which may, in turn, stimulate the moti-
vations and strengthen the actual behaviors of customer
knowledge sharing. Moreover, comparatively speaking,
there is a high degree of probability that customer-oriented
suppliers will resolve customer problems quickly or pro-
vide customized, quality solutions. As long as customers
recognize the positive outcomes and the friendly attitude of
their suppliers, customers may exhibit strong willingness to
exchange information actively with their suppliers, lower
both the psychological and physical barriers to effective
information exchange, and make every effort to achieve
better solutions for themselves. Therefore, we conclude
that a customer-oriented supplier is more likely to induce
customer knowledge sharing.

H1: Customer orientation is positively related to customer

knowledge sharing.

Customer Perceived Beneﬁt

The second motivational factor related to customer
knowledge sharing is customer perceived beneﬁts, that is,
how many beneﬁts a customer expects to gain from a joint
project. As Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) suggested, attitudes
and subjective norms towards a speciﬁc behavior determine
the intention to engage in that behavior. If a person adopts
a favorable attitude toward a behavior, she/he will be very
likely to engage in that behavior. Applying this logic to the
setting of knowledge sharing, we argue that the behavior of
customer knowledge sharing is more likely to occur when
the beneﬁts of such a behavior outweigh the costs (Bock
and Kim 2002).

Empirical studies have provided evidence supporting
the notion that the greater the beneﬁts associated with
knowledge sharing, the more positive the attitudes and
intentions for knowledge sharing. For instance, Bock,
Zmud, Kim, and Lee (2005) argued that individuals
tend to hoard knowledge for various reasons and to
induce knowledge sharing, organizations have to provide
proper extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces,
and organizational climate. Similarly, Lin (2007) differ-
entiated two types of motivators (extrinsic and intrinsic)
to explain employee knowledge sharing intentions. His
empirical results derived from 172 employees of 50 large
organizations in Taiwan show that motivational factors
such as perceived beneﬁts from knowledge sharing are
signiﬁcantly correlated with employee knowledge sharing
attitudes and intentions. We argue that the same logic
can be extended to the organizational level, and that when
customers perceive more beneﬁts associated with sharing
knowledge with their suppliers, they are more likely to
engage in those kinds of activities.

H2: Customer perceived beneﬁt is positively related to

customer knowledge sharing.

Customer Socialization

The two foregoing motivational factors highlight the
incentives for customers to share knowledge;
in addi-
tion, suppliers must create opportunities for customer
knowledge sharing to occur, and one possible choice is
via customer socialization. Customer socialization refers
to the level of interaction and communication between

the supplier and the customer (Gupta and Govindarajan
2000). In particular, this study focuses on the informal
aspect of customer socialization, which often happens out-
side of the physical setting of the workplace, such as family
parties, off-site meetings, personal gift exchanges, and
interest groups (Lawson et al. 2009). Although socializa-
tion is a well-accepted concept in the organizational behav-
ior literature, few studies have empirically examined how
customer socialization inﬂuences information exchange
and knowledge sharing within a supplier-customer con-
text (Cousins and Menguc 2006; Gupta and Govindarajan
2000). We argue that a focal supplier can induce higher lev-
els of customer knowledge sharing through active customer
socialization due to three potential beneﬁts.

First, customer socialization provides ample oppor-
tunities for the representatives from suppliers and cus-
tomers to become acquainted and understand each other,
which helps overcome behavioral and cultural barriers
(Chalos and O’Connor 2004; Handﬁeld and Bechtel
2002). Further, interpersonal familiarity and afﬁnity pro-
vide more opportunities for open communication and thus
facilitate more exchanges of information and know-how
(Gupta and Govindarajan 2000). Second, customer social-
ization means that much wider channels are available for
customers to exchange information with suppliers (Daft
and Lengel 1986). Without social interaction, a focal ﬁrm
can only exchange ideas and access customer knowledge
through formal meetings and discussions, thus limiting the
amount and types of information exchanged. Through var-
ious types of customer socializations, a focal ﬁrm increases
the frequency and intensity of the exchange of ideas
and information. Third, interactive customer socialization
helps build mutual trust and forms friendships (Handﬁeld
and Bechtel 2002). Friends are more likely to exchange
tacit and proprietary knowledge, thus leading to more
knowledge sharing. Expanding on this notion, in such
emerging economies as China, the countless guanxi net-
works used in most business transactions should be more
widely acknowledged. For centuries, guanxi has been per-
vasive in every aspect of Chinese organizational activity,
where informal customer socialization is very popular and
even vital for maintaining quality business relationships.

Empirical research on the role of socialization generally
supports the previous arguments and indicates that effec-
tive socialization helps increase partner-speciﬁc absorptive
capacity (Dyer and Singh 1998), allows for higher levels
of product integration with suppliers (Ragatz, Handﬁeld,
and Petersen 2002), facilitates knowledge transfer (Gupta
and Govindarajan 2000), and improves new product

development (Lawson et al. 2009). For instance, Lawson
et al. (2009) conducted a survey among U.K. manufac-
turing ﬁrms and found that informal socialization mecha-
nisms exert a positive inﬂuence on the level of knowledge
sharing within interorganizational product development
teams. Similarly, Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) collected
data from 374 subsidiaries within 75 MNCs and demon-
strated that when a subsidiary’s president is active in the
socialization process, this subsidiary will have a higher level
of knowledge inﬂow and outﬂow from peer subsidiaries.

H3: Customer socialization is positively related to cus-

tomer knowledge sharing.

Customer Technological Capability
The MOA framework implies that ability is an impor-
tant antecedent of an expected action (Blumberg and
Pringle 1982; Rothschild 1999). When a person or an
organization possesses good skills or relevant knowledge
bases relating to an action, the chance of successfully
performing that action increases accordingly. Given the
context of high-technology industries, this study focuses
on customers’ technological capabilities that relate to cus-
tomers’ accumulated knowledge and experience relevant
to current projects. We believe that customers are more
likely to share knowledge with their suppliers when they
are highly innovative and have accumulated a large stock
of detailed knowledge. This is true for two reasons. First,
customer technological capability forms the premise for
knowledge sharing with suppliers (Grant 1996). When
customers lack technical skills and competencies, they
are less likely to generate new ideas and original knowl-
edge elements, thus reducing the probability of knowledge
exchange with their suppliers. Second, when customers are
highly innovative, they tend to become more demanding
of their suppliers and expect their suppliers to keep pace
with their technological development. Consequently, such
customers may exchange information and share knowledge
frequently with their suppliers.

H4: Customer technological capability is positively related

to customer knowledge sharing.

(e.g., Grant 1996; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). In this
study, project performance refers to an overall measure
of performance consisting of the following items: (1) the
degree to which project cost is reduced; (2) the degree to
which project cycle is shortened; (3) the degree to which
project quality is improved; (4) the degree to which cus-
tomer complaints are decreased after project completion;
and (5) the degree to which the customer’s operating
cost
is reduced. We argue that customer knowledge
sharing has a positive effect on project performance. First,
when customers are willing to share their information and
technological know-how with their suppliers, suppliers can
better understand customer needs and problems, which
is the basis for improving customer satisfaction (Narver
and Slater 1990). Through frequent
interaction and
knowledge exchange, suppliers can integrate customers’
comments and suggestions into the production process
and make modiﬁcations accordingly. As a result, customer
knowledge sharing can reduce customer response time,
lower transaction costs, and lead to more cost savings
(Carr and Pearson 1999).

Second, customer knowledge sharing helps reduce the
psychological barriers between suppliers and customers,
thus fostering trust and cooperation (Szulanski et al.,
2004). This makes it possible, and more cost-effective,
for suppliers to understand what customers really want.
Through exchange of internal information and know-how,
these dyadic relationships can make full use of all available
knowledge for superior project performance. Third, given
knowledge components provided by customers, suppliers
can broaden their own stock of knowledge and increase the
probability of creating new processes or products through
recombination (e.g., Fleming, 2001), thus suppliers can
offer more innovative outputs to the customers, decrease
project costs, shorten project cycle, improve project quality,
and/or avoid customer complaints.

H5: Customer knowledge sharing is positively related to

project performance.

industry in China. The TCE service industry is proper
for this study because project teams constitute the basic
work units in this industry, and customized services as
well as intimate interactions with customers are required
during the process of project planning, implementation,
evaluation, and maintenance. To derive a more holistic
overview encompassing the issue of customer knowledge
sharing, we designed two studies and collected data from
both suppliers and customers, respectively.

Study 1: Project Managers from the Service
Providers

We selected three major TCE providers from China as
the major source of respondents. We ﬁrst contacted the
general managers of three TCE companies to explain the
purpose of the study and invite their participation. The
three companies operate within a wide geographic area in
China, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
and Anhui. With permission and assistance of top man-
agers, we constructed an initial sample of 400 project
managers actually working within their companies.

The questionnaire for the survey was originally pre-
pared in English, and subsequently translated into Chinese
by two management researchers from a top university in
China. To avoid cultural bias and ensure validity, the
Chinese version was then back-translated into English.
We conducted a pilot study to clarify the instrument
with 50 project managers. According to feedback from the
pretest, we revised the questionnaire to improve clarity.
Then the questionnaire was mailed to other project man-
agers, together with an invitation letter from their general

managers. Respondents were asked to ﬁnish the question-
naire based on one of their recent projects with which
they were most familiar. After one month, we mailed a
memorandum to non-responding ﬁrms and made a call to
remind non-responding project managers to complete and
return the questionnaire within another one month.

After two rounds of correspondence, we eventually
received 213 effective questionnaires from the supplier
side, with a valid response rate of 53.3%. Among
them, 136 copies were ﬁrst-round responses (termed early
responses) while the rest were second-round responses
(termed late
responses). Following the suggestion of
Armstrong and Overton (1977), this study compared early
responses with late responses using a t-test analysis. The
result showed that these two groups of respondents dis-
played no signiﬁcant differences across all key variables
of this study, that is, customer orientation, customer
perceived beneﬁt, customer socialization, and customer
technology capability.

Study 2: Project Managers from the
Customers

Study 2 asked the three TCE service providers to pre-
pare a list of project managers who had worked as their
customers and who had collaborated with them in the past.
Initially, a name list of 500 project managers was compiled.
We followed the same process used in Study 1 to clar-
ify and improve the items in the questionnaire and then
mailed questionnaires to the potential respondents. It is to
be noted that all instruments used in Study 2 were similar
to those in Study 1, except that we changed the wording

312 effective questionnaires from the customer side, repre-
senting a valid response rate of 62.4%. Table 1 captures the
characteristics of both samples, including the gender, age,
work experience, and education of respondents, as well as

Measures and Validation

The items used to measure the theoretical constructs
were derived from an extensive review of the extant
literature. All items were measured using a 7-point Likert

scale anchored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree). Table 2 shows the list of all measures and the results
of conﬁrmatory factor analysis.

Project performance was measured by a scale adapted
from the well-known study by Bonner, Ruekert and
Walker (2002),
including project cost reduction, time
saving, quality improvement, complaint decrease, and
customer cost reduction. The respondents were asked
to evaluate the extent to which the above project goals
were achieved on a 7-point Likert scale. We applied a
subjective performance measure in this study because prior
research has provided evidence supporting the reliability

explanatory variable was customer technological capability,
which was measured by 7 items adapted from Morrison
et al. (2000).

We also controlled for two key variables that might
inﬂuence project performance: project duration and
project size. Project duration was measured as the number
of months that a project required to ﬁnish. Project size was
measured as the number of people involved in a project.

To test unidimensionality, inter-item correlations were
calculated and item-to-total correlations were examined,
one scale at a time. Also an exploratory factor analysis
was conducted to explore the unidimensionality of each
scale using an eigenvalue of 1.0 (Steenkamp and Van Trijp
1991).

To test the construct validity, we followed the pro-
cedures suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981) and
conducted the conﬁrmatory factor analysis. The general
ﬁndings showed that our measures had good discrim-
inant and convergent validities. As shown in Table 2,

all composite reliability values were above the suggested
threshold of 0.70, with a minimum of 0.86 for customer
perceived beneﬁts in the customer sample. In addition, the
standardized factor loadings for all items were above the
suggested cut-off point of 0.60, and all were signiﬁcant
with strong evidence of convergent validity. Furthermore,
as shown in Tables 3 and 4, the average variance extracted
(AVE) value of each construct in the model was more than
0.50, which met the requirement that a construct’s AVE
should be at least higher than 0.50 (Fornell and Larcker
1981). In addition, discriminant validity was demonstrated
by the square root of the AVE of each construct being
generally higher than the correlations with any other con-
structs in the model (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Thus,
the constructs were shown to be both conceptually and
empirically distinct from each other.

As with all self-reported data, there is a potential for
common method variance. Therefore, statistical analyses
were conducted before hypothesis testing. First, Harmon’s

one-factor test was conducted (1967) and results showed
that six factors explained 76.9% of the variance, with no
single factor explaining more than 20% of the variance.
Second, a more stringent test was conducted, as well, based
on what Liang et al. (2007) suggested. We included in
the PLS model a common method factor that links to
all the principal constructs’ indicators, and calculated each
indicator’s variances substantively explained by the princi-
pal construct and by the method factor. It was found that
most of the method factor loadings are insigniﬁcant, and
that the indicators’ substantive variances are substantially
greater than their method variances. This implies that the
potential problem of common method variance did not
appear to be signiﬁcant in our study.

RESULTS

After establishing conﬁdence in the measurement
model, we applied structural equation modeling to test our
hypotheses. There are at least two estimation techniques
for structural equation modeling: maximum likelihood
(ML) covariance structural analysis and partial least squares
(PLS) variance analysis. Although the PLS method is not
as popular as the ML method, it does provide a way to
avoid problems of improper solutions and factor indeter-
minacy, as well as the violations of distributional assump-
tions, which can be associated with the ML method.
Furthermore, the PLS method has been gaining popular-
ity recently because of its ability to model latent constructs
under conditions of nonnormality and small to medium
sample size, which is preferable to techniques such as
regression assuming error free measurement. In addition,
given its exploratory nature and its major concern focused
on the predictive power of the research model, this study
adopted the PLS method with PLS-Graph 3.0 to develop
structure equation models.

Table 5 presents the empirical ﬁndings using the PLS
approach for both samples. Hypothesis 1 proposed a pos-
itive relationship between customer orientation and cus-
tomer knowledge sharing. In Table 5, we found that the
corresponding path coefﬁcients for both samples were pos-
itive and signiﬁcant (p < 0.01), providing full support for
Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 argued for a positive linkage
between customer perceived beneﬁts and customer knowl-
edge sharing. Table 5 indicates that such a relationship
only exists for the customer sample. Hypothesis 3 argued
that customer socialization had a positive effect on cus-
tomer knowledge sharing, which only received support in
the supplier sample (path coefﬁcient = 0.30, t = 5.17).

238

We also found that in both samples, a positive and signif-
icant relationship existed between customer technological
capability and customer knowledge sharing, providing full
support for Hypothesis 4. Finally, for both samples, the
path coefﬁcients between customer knowledge sharing and
project performance were positive and statistically signiﬁ-
cant, providing full support for Hypothesis 5. In addition
to the foregoing, we controlled two key other variables
that may inﬂuence project performance. As indicated in
Table 5, negative and positive but signiﬁcant effects of
project size was found for samples of suppliers and cus-
tomers, respectively, whereas a signiﬁcant effect of project
duration was found for customer sample only.

DISCUSSION

This study extended the existing research stream of
interﬁrm knowledge sharing by examining the antecedents
and consequences of customer knowledge sharing from
dual perspectives. Speciﬁcally, we applied the MOA
framework to examine the extent to which customers are
willing to share knowledge with their suppliers. We also
explored the impact of customer knowledge sharing on
project performance. To obtain a holistic view of this issue,
we conducted two studies with respondents from both the
customer and supplier sides.

Our ﬁndings indicate that the MOA framework pro-
vides substantial power in explaining the drivers of cus-
tomer knowledge sharing. First, our results suggest that
customer orientation is positively related to customer
knowledge sharing in both samples. This indicates that
customers are more willing to share their knowledge when
their suppliers are concerned about their interests. This
ﬁnding is consistent with previous literature indicating
that motivational factors are important determinants of
people’s behaviors (Rothschild 1999).

Second, we ﬁnd that customer perceived beneﬁts are
positively related to customer knowledge sharing in cus-
tomer samples. This means that customers are more likely
to exchange ideas and information with their suppliers
when they anticipate more beneﬁts from such interac-
tion, thus providing support for the motivational argu-
ment. However, such a relationship was not proved in the
supplier sample, which is an extremely interesting result.
So, from the suppliers’ standpoint, the customers’ antici-
pated beneﬁt from a project is not a key driver for customer
knowledge sharing. This judgment may be misleading
because project managers are actually concerned about the
beneﬁcial returns of a project. Further, our ﬁndings suggest

that project managers, on the suppliers’ side, seek to pro-
vide real value to their customers to obtain more positive
input from their customers.

Third, according to the MOA framework, customer
knowledge sharing tends to be facilitated when both parties
have opportunities to exchange information and new ideas.
Our ﬁndings show that customer socialization has a pos-
itive effect on customer knowledge sharing within our
sample of suppliers. Therefore, in the eyes of the suppli-
ers, frequent interactions and friendship building activities
can generate a platform to involve customers in knowledge
sharing. This conforms to Lawson et al.’s study (2009),
indicating that informal socialization mechanisms are pos-
itively associated with higher levels of knowledge sharing
within inter-organizational development teams. However,
such a linkage did not occur in our sample of customers.
That is, frequent socialization does not necessarily guar-
antee that customers would be willing to share their new
ideas and internal information. It is found that energizing
customer knowledge sharing is a subtle issue: Although
project managers, on the supplier side, place more empha-
sis on generating opportunities for customer knowledge
sharing, project managers, from the customers’ stand-
point, pay more attention to motivational factors such as
perceived beneﬁts.

Fourth, our ﬁndings indicate that customers’ technolog-
ical capabilities are an important determinant of customer
knowledge sharing in both samples. This result conﬁrms
previous studies that found that ability is an important
antecedent of an expected behavior (Rothschild 1999).
The present study’s results suggest that, at the project
level, if a customer lacks a solid knowledge base or expe-
rience in a speciﬁc technological area, the customer acts
as a pure recipient and cannot contribute meaningfully to
the project. Therefore, only when customers have already
accumulated certain technological capabilities will they be
willing and able to share knowledge with suppliers.

Finally, this study provides further evidence shedding
light on the beneﬁts of customer knowledge sharing.
In both samples, we found that customer knowledge shar-
ing helps improve project performance, which conﬁrms
prior research underscoring the importance of customer
knowledge (Lausen and Salter 2006; von Hippel 1976,
1986).

Methodologically, this study contributes to the liter-
ature by demonstrating the power of two independent
studies addressing the same research question using differ-
ent samples. Although previous studies have explored the
antecedents and consequences of knowledge sharing, little
research has investigated this issue from dyadic perspec-
tives. We believe that perception of knowledge sharing,
from either single party, is biased to some extent; and,
our results are more holistic by considering responses from
both customers and suppliers.

A few limitations in this study can be addressed in future
research. First, this study is conducted on the basis of the
well-known MOA framework and only four antecedents
were included in our study. Because there exist other incen-
tives for customers to share knowledge, further studies may
integrate more incentives into one framework to reveal a
more comprehensive picture of customer knowledge shar-
ing. Second, the MOA framework is predicated not only
on main effects, but also on the effects of interaction.
For example, even if a customer is motivated, knowledge
sharing may not happen at all if there is no opportu-
nity or ability to share information. Thus, future research
may explore how these factors interact with each other in
inﬂuencing customer knowledge sharing. Third, the gener-
alizability of our ﬁndings is limited because the sample of
this study is drawn from three major TCE service providers
from China. Future studies may address this limitation
by applying the same framework to different empirical
settings. Fourth and last, since prior studies have empha-
sized both behavioral and cultural aspects of customer

orientation (e.g., Bharadwaj, Nevin, and Wallman 2012),
future research may proﬁtably explore the differentiated
effects of each aspect.

IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS

MARKETING PRACTICE

Findings conﬁrm the importance of customer knowl-
edge sharing in customer value co-creation in B2B markets,
and how to induce and facilitate customer knowledge shar-
ing. Speciﬁcally, this study, in concert with past research on
customer knowledge sharing, implies that strengthening
knowledge sharing between customers and suppliers pos-
itively impacts project performance. So, from a managerial
perspective, the article deepens current understanding of
how to induce and enable customers to share knowledge,
and thus how to achieve superior project performance.
Importantly, managers can use the ﬁndings of this article
to support their decisions related to customer value co-
creation by facilitating customer knowledge sharing since
customer knowledge sharing has a positive and signiﬁ-
cant effect on project performance in samplings of both
customers and suppliers.

Secondly, given the signiﬁcant effects on knowledge
sharing in both samples of customers and suppliers,
customer relations managers can strive to stimulate their
suppliers to become more customer oriented, whereas
managers of suppliers can try their best to become more
customer oriented. Moreover, customer managers can
devote attention to enhancing their technological capa-
bility, while managers of suppliers can evaluate and help
strengthen the technological capability of their customers.
Thirdly, managers should also recognize the perception
gap between customers and suppliers so as to bridge
the gap or take effective measures to adapt the gap.
For instance, suppliers tend to emphasize the relative
importance of customer socialization, whereas customers
stress the signiﬁcance of customer perceived beneﬁts in
achieving superior project performance by facilitating
knowledge sharing.

In sum, this article highlights areas where managers
could focus more attention on motivation, opportunity,
and ability, doing so simultaneously to achieve superior
project performance through facilitation of customer
knowledge sharing. Managers must maintain the right bal-
ance among motivation-related, opportunity-related, and
ability-related factors to arrive at an optimal solution that,
given the existence of perception gaps between the two par-
ties, addresses the needs of both customers and suppliers.
