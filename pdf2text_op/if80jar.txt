 Environmental Performance and

 Corporate Disclosure

 ROBERT W. INGRAM* AND KATHERINE BEAL FRAZIERt

 Disclosure of the social consequences of firms' behavior has been
 proposed in the professional literature (e.g., see Bauer and Fenn [1972],
 Bauer, Cauthorn and Warner [1975], and Estes [1972]) under the as-
 sumption that reliable social responsibility disclosures would prove useful
 to external users. Recent studies, however, cast doubt concerning the
 demand for social disclosures (e.g., Buzby and Falk [1979], Opinion
 Research Corporation [1974], and Duff and Phelps [1976]). These results
 could reflect either a lack of disclosure quality or the nonrelevance of
 social disclosures to external users' decision models. This study centers
 on the first possibility by examining the relationship between measures
 of firm's environmental performances and the environmental disclosures
 contained in the firms' annual reports.

 In the present institutional environment, most social responsibility
 disclosures are voluntary and unaudited. Few efforts have been made to
 monitor firms' social activities or to validate their disclosures so that
 motivation may exist for management to distort voluntary disclosures, to
 the extent that these disclosures reflect aspects of managements' relative
 performances. For the disclosures to be useful, there should be a corre-
 spondence between the disclosures and actual events. If external users do
 not perceive this correspondence, they might discount the social respon-
 sibility disclosures, which would be consistent with the negative findings
 cited above.

 Disclosure quality may be gauged by assessing the relationship between
 (1) what firms identify as their accomplishments and objectives and (2)

 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND DISCLOSURE 615

 independent measures of actual performance. Although disclosures are
 readily identifiable in firms' annual reports, the primary source of vol-
 untary information, to capture this data in a form permissive of analysis
 presents a problem. Many disclosures are in narrative form and often
 reflect only personal opinion. Moreover, independent measures of per-
 formance are not readily available for most firms.

 The procedures described in the next section provide a systematic
 method for quantifying the content of firms' disclosures. The measured
 content was then compared to a set of performance indices derived from
 actual measurements of specific types of environmental activities. The
 results suggest limitations in voluntary social disclosures, which would
 justify, at least in part, the reluctance of individual investors to use this
 information in their investment decisions.

 Methodology

 The hypothesis examined here is posited in the null form as follows:
 Ho: The content of firms' environmental disclosures is not associ-

 ated with the firms' environmental performances.

 Lacking any generally accepted measure of firms' environmental perfor-
 mances, we had to use surrogates of such activities. Our surrogates
 consisted of the indices of firms' performances devised by the Council on
 Economic Priorities (CEP) [1977]. These indices were selected because
 they were available for a sizable cross-section of widely traded firms (50)
 and were derived from independent assessments of the air and water
 emissions of firms' plants. We might add that they also appear to be
 consistent with market assessments of firms' behavior (Spicer [1978]).

 Our assumption was that if firms' environmental disclosures are reflec-
 tive of their environmental activities, a high degree of correlation should
 exist between these indices and the content of their disclosures. The
 indices range from a maximum of 10 for the worst performance for all
 pollutants to 0 for no emissions or discharges; thus, the lower the index,
 the better the performance. The CEP indices cover 50 firms in four
 industries (electric utilities, iron and steel, petroleum refining, and pulp
 and paper), each of which was evaluated in one out of the four years,
 1970 to 1974. All firms in the same industry were evaluated in the same
 year. From this set of 50 firms, 40 provided annual reports containing
 environmental disclosures for the fiscal year ending after the calendar
 year in which the CEP indices were computed.1

 Content analysis was used to measure the content of each firm's
 environmental disclosures.2 The methodology of content analysis involves

 user response, see Ingram and Frazier [1979].

 the selection of analytical categories within the context of the content
 material. Variables are defined by identifying criteria which will allow
 any item to be judged as either belonging or not belonging to a particular
 category. Categories must be defined as precisely as practicable so that
 different judges could be expected to apply them to the same messages
 and arrive at the same results.3 Systematic categories result from the
 consistent application of a set of rules so that results could be replicated.
 Each set of related categories should be exhaustive and mutually exclu-
 sive and defined so that identifying an item with a category is not a
 discretionary process. The quantitative criteria distinguish content anal-
 ysis from other forms of textual analysis.

 The categories used were specifically developed within the context of
 the sample firms' disclosures by selecting at random four annual reports
 from firms in the same industries as those analyzed but not otherwise
 included in the study. The nature and attributes of the disclosures made
 by the firms were listed by two independent readers. These lists were
 compared and common items were selected for inclusion in the research.
 The categories reflect four testable dimensions which appear within
 the disclosures: evidence, time, specificity, and theme. These dimensions
 have been used in other content analyses (e.g., Shepard [1956] and
 Ellsworth [1965]) and have been shown to be useful discriminators. A
 priori, it would seem that firms with better performance records would
 have more factual evidence related to the firms' own actual accomplish-
 ments than would poorer performers, if the firms' disclosures reflect their
 environmental activities.

 Twenty content categories were selected representing the four testable

 dimensions:

 Evidence Time Specificity Theme

 Monetary Past Specific Public Interest
 Nonmonetary Present General Economic Consequences
 Qualitative Future Irrational Activists
 Declarative Government Regulation
 None Litigation

 Regulatory Compliance
 Actual Accomplishments
 Proposed Accomplishments
 Environmental Control
 Other

 These categories are defined in Appendix A. The list of categories
 developed from the examination of firms' disclosures was consistent with
 categories identified as being potentially useful discriminators in the
 social responsibility and content analysis literatures. (See Holsti [1969]
 for a description of these categories.)

 Environmental disclosures identified in each of the 40 annual reports

 used in the analysis were typed in order to standardize their format and
 to delete all references to proper names, locations, and dates. These
 procedures provided some control over exogenous variables which could
 have biased the results. Two independent judges (both familiar with
 content analysis procedures) were provided with copies of the disclosures,
 category definitions, and worksheets for identifying the number of items
 in each category for each firm. This procedure has been used frequently
 in the content analysis literature (see Holsti [1969]).

 Several pilot studies were run with the judges, using different variations
 of worksheets and different units of analysis. The sentence was selected
 as the unit of analysis for the final research since a sentence is easily
 identified, is less subject to interjudge variation than phrases, clauses, or
 themes, and has been evaluated as an appropriate unit in previous
 research (see Stone et al. [1962]). In rare cases in which complex sentence
 structures would have produced misleading results, major clauses were
 used instead.

 The judges were instructed to read each sentence and then place a
 check on the worksheet adjacent to the appropriate category in each
 dimension. The number of checks were then totaled to compute the total
 score for each category for each firm.4 Scores were standardized for firms
 in each industry by dividing the differences between the firm's score and
 its industry mean for each category by that category's standard deviation.
 This process, which produced a common scale for firms in different
 industries and for disclosures from different years, permitted pooling the
 firms to increase the degrees of freedom in the analysis. Thus, although
 firm A in industry I cannot be determined to be a better performer than
 firm A in industry II, it is possible to describe the relationship between
 the better performers across industries (in terms of standardized scores)
 and the nature of the disclosures of these firms (in terms of standardized
 scores).

 Results

 The relationship between firms' environmental performances (CEP
 index scores) and the content of the firms' environmental disclosures

 4 The objectivity criteria for the categories were verified by computing the coefficient of
 reliability (Holsti [1969]), which is the ratio of the number of interjudge agreements to the
 total number of judgments made. A refinement of this coefficient, known as the index of
 reliability (Scott [1955]), was also computed. This index is a modification of the coefficients
 of reliability in order to take account of the expected interjudge agreement which would
 result from chance and is computed as: IR = (OA - EA)/(1 - EA), where IR is the index
 of reliability, OA is the percentage of observed agreement, and EA is the percentage of
 expected agreement computed as EII2, where Ih is the proportion of the total items in
 category c and is summed over all c. The coefficient was calculated to be .851, and the index
 of reliability was calculated as .814. While no standard of acceptability exists for either
 measure, .851 for the coefficient appears to be satisfactory, compared to other content
 analysis studies (see Kassarjian [1977] for discussion). These results indicate that the
 categories selected for analysis were objective in the sense that independent judges could
 use them to arrive at similar decisions.

 (content analysis scores) was estimated first by product-moment corre-
 lations. Table 1 indicates these correlation coefficients for the CEP index
 with each content analysis score. The correlations indicate a weak posi-
 tive correlation (between content and performance) for all categories
 except litigation, which is negative and also weak. As such, they suggest
 that, on average, the poorer performers made slightly more disclosures
 than the better performers in all categories except litigation.

 Since amount of disclosure as measured by the total number of disclo-
 sures identified by the judges appears to be an important instrumental
 variable, partial correlation coefficients were computed to control for
 amount of disclosure. Once amount of disclosure is included in the
 analysis, the relationships are even weaker (again, see table 1).

 Multiple regression was then used to determine the multivariate asso-
 ciation between the content analysis scores and the CEP indices by
 treating the content analysis scores as predictor variables. A first step in
 this procedure was to reduce the set of content analysis scores to a set of
 uncorrelated variables.5 Using varimax rotated factor analysis we identi-

 a problem in analyzing the descriptive statistics to determine the significant predictor

 fied four factors which significantly explained intercorrelations in the 20
 variables (accounting for 73.5 percent of the total variance). Factor
 loadings greater than .50 are shown in table 2. The highest loading
 variable in each factor-actual accomplishments, general, litigation, and
 compliance-was used in the multiple regression analysis. While the
 other variables were highly correlated with one or another of these four,
 these four variables were not intercorrelated.

 Table 3 shows the results of the multiple regression analysis. It is
 apparent that none of the four variables is significantly associated with
 the CEP index. The multiple R2 of .0746 is also indicative of the weak
 relationship among the variables.6 Thus, there is little basis on which to
 reject Ho.

 These insignificant results suggest that the content analysis scores of
 firms' disclosures do not relate strongly to CEP indices of firms' environ-
 mental activities. The only important relationship identified was that the

 variables. This was not a problem in the light of the results of this study and other analyses
 where it appears that use of a complete variable set did not alter the results. See Ingram
 and Frazier [1979] for further description.

 { Interaction was also examined by combining the content analysis scores into composite
 indices. This procedure did not detect significant interaction or any combination of variables
 which were significantly related to the CEP indices.

 annual reports of the poorer performers (as indicated by the CEP indices)
 contained more environmental disclosures than the better performers,
 except for disclosure of litigation. This finding is somewhat significant in
 itself, since litigation is the only category of environmental disclosure
 contained in the audited financial statements. In contrast, the greater
 amount of disclosure by the poorer performers appears in the narrative,
 discretionary section of the annual report.

 Conclusion

 The quality of social responsibility disclosures may be a factor affecting
 the utility of the data for external users. The results of this study indicate,
 at best, only a weak association between quantitative measures of disclo-
 sure content and independent measures of social performance. This weak
 association may be due to the lack of external monitoring of firms' social
 disclosures. Since management is free to use its own discretion in selecting
 information to be reported, it is possible for poorer performers to bias
 their selections in order to appear like the better performers. This could
 explain why investors tend to discount such information.

 Of course, our findings and conclusion must be tempered by the limited
 number of firms and time periods sampled. In addition, both the content
 analysis procedures and the performance indices used abstracted only
 limited attributes of firms' actual activities.
