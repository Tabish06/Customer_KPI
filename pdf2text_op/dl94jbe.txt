 Pollution, Profits, and Stakeholders:
 The Constraining Effect of Economic
 Performance on CEO Concern with

 Stakeholder Expectations

 Robert S. Dooley
 Linda D. Lerner

 ABSTRACT. This study examined the constraining effect of
 economic performance on the relationship between CEO
 'stakeholder orientations and four pollution performance
 categories. Economic performance was found to moderate
 the relationship for two of the four categories. Additionally
 economic performance was found to consistently interact
 with some CEO stakeholder orientations and not others.
 Overall the results suggest that CEO concern with stake
 holder expectations is in large part moderate by the eco
 nomic performance of the firm.

 The strategic choice approach to managerial decision
 making suggests that managers have the ability to
 choose the domain in which the organization will
 operate and how the organization will navigate that
 domain (Child, 1972). Recent work in this research
 stream suggests that strategic decisions themselves
 are influenced by managerial values and characteris
 tics (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). A more balanced
 view recognizes that organizations are faced with
 both internal and external constraints that can limit
 managerial discretion in strategic decision making
 (Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987; Finkelstein and
 Hambrick, 1990). Organizational constraints restrict
 the organization's ability to operate freely in the
 pursuit of such things as potential new markets,
 more profitable opportunities, and social perform
 ance goals (Ansoff, 1990).

 corporate social performance, women in management, and
 business venturing.

 Although corporations are confronted with nu
 merous constraints, financial performance may be
 the most significant, especially with regards to goals
 which are not explicitly profit oriented. When faced
 with low economic performance, for example, the
 aim of improving social performance may be as
 signed lower priority in the corporations' hierarchy
 of goals. Similarly, stakeholder interests not per
 ceived to be directly tied to the economic perform
 ance of the firm may be prioritized differently
 depending on economic performance.

 Specifically this paper examines the interaction of
 economic performance and CEO stakeholder orien
 tation (i.e. what CEOs would like to do but can't
 because of the constraints of economic performance)
 on pollution performance. While the study of CEOs
 does not capture every aspect of the strategic deci
 sion making process, CEOs are considered to set the
 primary strategic direction of the firm (Lorange,
 1980; Pierce and Robinson, 1987; Hitt and Tyler,
 1991). Similarly, stakeholder management, while it
 does not capture the entire strategic context of the
 organization, is considered a primary dimension of
 organizational (Hambrick, 1989) and social perform
 ance (Wood, 1991a). Although it is recognized that
 pollution performance has been used as a crude
 measure of social performance, for the purposes of
 this paper it was chosen because of the renewed
 interest in environmental issues by both industry
 and society alike, thus suggesting its worthiness for
 study in its own right. Secondary to this criteria is
 the fact that pollution performance measures have
 historically been used extensively in the literature
 (Bragdon and Marlon, 1972; Bowman and Haire,
 1975; Folger and Nutt, 1975; Spicer, 1978a; Spicer,
 1978b; Ingram and Fraizer, 1980; Freedman and

 The remainder of the paper is divided into three
 parts. The first section reviews the Corporate Social
 Performance literature and its links to economic
 performance and stakeholder management, thus
 laying the conceptual framework for the relationship
 to be tested. The second section describes the
 methodology used to test the proposed relationship
 with data gathered from FORTUNE 500 companies
 and the EPA's toxic release inventory tracking
 program. The final section discusses the findings and
 implications for future research.

 Background

 Corporate social performance and economic performance

 Since the industrial revolution, a certain amount of
 tension has existed between business and society over
 the economic benefits provided by business and
 perceived negative consequences of business activity.
 Ansoff (1990) states that after sustained economic
 growth was achieved, "the emergent affluent society
 no longer had to tolerate business excesses and the
 firm's environment turned from benign to hostile"
 (p. 197).

 Bowen's (1953) book Social Responsibilities of the
 Businessman was an early attempt to diffuse this
 hostility by prescriptively explicating the responsi
 bilities of business beyond the economic. Subse
 quently, Milton Friedman's (1962) remark that the
 "only responsibility of business is to make a profit"
 provided a lighting rod to which advocates of social
 responsibility responded. Indeed, the social perform
 ance literature is replete with typologies, classifica
 tions and theories that have attempted to reconcile
 the relationship between profits and social perform
 ance (for a review of the literature see Wood, 1991a).
 Conceptually, Carroll's (1975) model of Corpo
 rate Social Performance was the first to integrate
 economic responsibilities into a framework of cor
 porate social responsibility. Although Carroll states
 "the first and foremost social responsibility of busi
 ness is economic in nature . . . and ... all other
 business roles are predicated on this fundamental
 assumption" (p. 500), he does not consider the fulfill
 ment of economic responsibilities as a sufficient

 criteria for social responsibility. Social responsibility
 consists of fulfilling the "economic ... as well as . . .
 the legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that
 society has of organizations at a given point in time"
 (Carroll, 1979, p. 500).

 Previous empirical research examining the link
 between social and economic performance has been
 inconclusive (Arlow and Gannon, 1982; Aupperle et
 al, 1985). It is not clear that economic benefits
 accrue to firms ranked high on social performance
 dimensions or that high economic performance is
 inconsistent with high social performance. While the
 general thrust of much of this research has been to
 determine whether social performance leads to
 higher firm or market-based measures of economic
 performance (Ullman, 1985), it may be more appro
 priate to view economic performance as a constraint
 to achieving social performance related goals. The
 alternative hypothesis that increases in economic
 performance will lead to increasing levels of social
 effort has been suggested as a potentially more
 "fruitful" approach for research (McGuire et al,
 1988).

 Stakeholder management and strategic choice

 Ullman (1985) suggested the missing link in the
 social performance literature was strategic context.
 Subsequent social performance models, most notably
 Wood's (1991b), have incorporated stakeholder man
 agement as a salient strategic dimension. Stakeholder
 management has emerged as one way of understand
 ing the strategic posture of the firm in relation to
 social issues (Freeman and Gilbert, 1988), by provid
 ing a framework in which corporations can identify
 and respond to the ubiquitous values of society. As a
 strategic choice based theory, the formulation of
 stakeholder strategies will in part be shaped by
 managerial values. In fact Freeman (1984) states that
 one would expect to find a high level of congruence
 between managerial values and the overall values
 attributed to the corporation.

 The corporate social performance literature has
 also acknowledged the importance of strategic
 choice and managerial values as essential elements in
 developing a social performance model. In explicat
 ing the importance of strategic choice, Miles (1987)
 considers top management's philosophy as the most

 Pollution, Profits, and Stakeholders 703

 important factor influencing how a corporation
 attempts to manage its social environment, and
 Ackerman (1975) considers the strategic choices of
 the CEO fundamental in directing the "corporation's
 position relative to emerging social demands" (p. 38).
 Wood (1991b) considers strategic choice an essen
 tial element of social performance, and argues for
 its elevation in importance in social performance
 models under the rubric of managerial discretion.
 Within this social performance framework, the
 implied ability of managers to make discretionary
 choices regarding social issues is somehow less
 inhibited by organizational constraints. While this
 may hold true for many day-to-day operating deci
 sions, it would appear to be less so for strategic
 decisions (e.g. those decisions that are ill structured,
 resource intensive, and complex) such as modifying a
 firm's pollution performance. Thus, for example,
 constraints may limit management's ability to re
 spond to social issues that are pertinent to specific
 stakeholder groups, especially when responding
 would have strategic implications for the firm.
 Managerial discretion in this context is markedly
 different from the more traditional concept devel
 oped by Hambrick and Finkelstein (1987), a distinc
 tion Wood herself acknowledges.

 However, if economic performance is considered

 a constraint to strategic choices (Ansoff, 1990; Ham
 brick and Finkelstein, 1987), then it is logical to
 hypothesize that profitability will influence CEO
 concern with stakeholder expectations surrounding
 strategically important issues. Therefore it is hy
 pothesized that:

 H{: Economic performance will moderate the
 relationship between CEO stakeholder
 orientations and pollution performance.

 Methodology
 Data

 The sample in this study resulted from the merging
 of two sets of data. The first data base was gathered
 by Lerner (1989) and has been used in previous
 studies (Lerner and Fryxell, 1990). It consists of CEO
 stakeholder orientations for 222 U.S. FORTUNE
 500 Industrial and U.S. FORTUNE 500 Service

 companies. The second data base consists of the EPA
 toxic release inventory of 8,000 publicly and pri
 vately held companies. The merging of the two data
 sets resulted in a final sample of 86 companies.

 The use of such a small sample size raises the
 important issue of statistical power, as the ability to
 correctly reject the null hypothesis varies directly
 with sample size and Type I error rate (Sawyer and
 Ball, 1981). Large Type I error rates and large sample
 sizes increase statistical power, while the converse is
 true for small Type I error rates and small sample
 sizes. Thus our use of a small sample size and low
 Type I error rate of 0.05 reduces the potential for
 finding statistically significant results. In light of
 having to overcome this hurdle, statistically signifi
 cant findings would suggest that the strength of the
 relationships are quite strong.

 Stakeholder orientation measures

 Questionnaires were sent out to the 1,000 chief
 executive officers listed in the FORTUNE 500
 Industrial and FORTUNE 500 Service directories,
 with 222 usable questionnaires returned. A review of
 responses revealed that the sample represents a full
 range of industry types found in the Fortune group.
 In order to test for nonresponse bias, we compared
 our survey respondents with a sample of 100 non
 responding firms randomly chosen from the Fortune
 1000 of the same year. The firms in the two samples
 were compared in terms of size, as measured by total
 sales volume, and economic condition, as measured
 by return on assets and return on equity. No signifi
 cant differences (p > 0.01) were found in a test of
 differences between responding and nonresponding
 firms. The CEOs in the firms in the two samples
 were also compared. The mean age of the CEOs in
 both the responding and nonresponding firms was
 56 years and the firm tenure of the CEOs in both
 groups was 22 years. There were no significant
 differences (p > 0.01) between the mean salaries
 paid to CEOs in both responding and nonrespond
 ing firms or the number of years as CEO, although
 the responding CEOs had served a somewhat shorter
 average tenure as CEO (7 years as compared to 9
 years).

 The questionnaire consisted of statements corre
 sponding to Freeman's (1984) six generic stakeholder

 classifications of stockholder, community, customer,
 employee, government, and management. The CEO
 responded to the level of importance for each state
 ment as it related to the importance of strategic
 choices and goals of the firm. In effect, the question
 naire measured the prioritization given by the CEO
 to the six stakeholder groups.

 To ensure the statements were representative of
 stakeholder orientations, the statements were de
 rived from prior studies involving business activity
 relative to each stakeholder group (Buehler and
 Shetty, 1976; Holmes, 1977; Abbott and Monsen,
 1979; Aupperle, 1984; Logsdon, 1985; Clarkson,
 1988). The items were also screened by a panel of
 judges who were asked to sort the statements into
 categories pertaining to each stakeholder group.
 Those statements among which there was a consensus
 were used in the instrument. A factor analysis1 also
 confirmed five of the six stakeholder groups. Factor
 analysis was unable to load the questions corre
 sponding to management orientation onto a single
 factor.

 Each statement was measured on a five-point
 Likert scale describing the relative importance of
 that particular stakeholder group. The scale ranged
 from "one of the two or three least important
 activities" to "one of the two or three most impor
 tant activities". A stakeholder orientation index was
 computed by summing the Likert scale responses for
 each stakeholder classification and dividing the sum
 by the number of statements relating to that clas
 sification.

 Reliability statistics were run on each of the stake
 holder orientation scales, with alphas ranging from
 0.62 for management orientation to 0.84 for com
 munity orientation. Because of the low reliability
 measure for management orientation this group was
 excluded from the analysis. Alphas of 0.70 are
 generally considered acceptable in survey research
 (Nunnally, 1971). Descriptive statistics and tests for
 normality revealed that the data could be considered
 as coming from a normal distribution.

 Pollution performance measures

 Prior research using pollution performance has
 typically used pollution performance rankings

 (Bragdon and Marlon, 1972; Bowman and Haire,
 1975; Folger and Nutt, 1975; Spicer, 1978a; Spicer b;
 Ingram and Fraizer, 1980; Freedman and Jaggi, 1982;
 Wiseman, 1982; Freedman and Wasley, 1990). How
 ever, the reliability of such third party rankings has
 been called into question, with the suggestion that a
 better measure of pollution performance might be
 pollution data filed with the EPA (Ullman, 1985).

 This study uses the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
 data gathered by the EPA for the year 1989. Toxic
 releases in pounds were divided into four categories:
 direct releases to air and water, releases to public
 sewage, off-sight transfers, and a total category
 which is a measure of overall performance and is
 comprised of the other three. To control for in
 dustry, the original pollution data base was first
 grouped by SIC code (SIC groupings with less than
 five companies were excluded). These groupings
 were then used to calculate a standardized pollution
 index for each company (mean = 0, standard devia
 tion ? 1). Since most companies operate in multiple
 SIC codes, the standardized pollution indices were
 averaged for each company to create an overall
 company pollution index (mean = 0, standard devia
 tion ? 1).

 Descriptive statistics and tests for normality re
 vealed that the data could not be considered as
 coming from a normal distribution. However, the
 effects of skewness and non-zero kurtosis on the
 robustness of correlation coefficients is considered
 minimal for non-prediction interval studies (Miller,
 1986).

 Economic performance measures

 When measuring economic performance, the re
 searcher is most always faced with having to choose
 among multiple criteria. For the purposes of this
 study, the accounting measure of ROA (return on
 assets) was used. Because of its general use as a
 profitability ratio (Van Home, 1989) and its overall
 measure of the effective use of capital, it was deter
 mined to be an adequate measure of economic
 performance. To control for industry variations in
 ROA, firm specific ROA was divided by its in
 dustry's average ROA.

 Additionally, because size is known to affect

 Strategie decision processes and corporate outcomes,
 the number of full-time employees was included as a
 control variable in the analyses.

 Analysis

 To test the moderating role of economic perform
 ance multiple hierarchal regression was used. First to
 test for main effects, each pollution performance
 category was regressed on CEO stakeholder orienta
 tions (along with ROA and the control variable for
 size). Second to test for the moderating effect of
 economic performance, a similar regression was used
 that entered as a group the interact variables of ROA
 X CEO-Stakeholder-Orientations. Rsquare and
 change in Rsquare are reported to assess the incre
 mental effect of adding economic performance as a
 moderator.

 Results

 Descriptive statistics are given in Table I. The mean
 index scores for CEO stakeholder orientations sug
 gest that customer expectations followed closely by
 stockholder expectations are given the most con
 sideration by CEOs, while community expectations
 are given the least. Further inspection by industry
 group showed a high level of consistency in this
 pattern of CEO stakeholder orientations. As would
 be expected given the nature of the sample, the
 companies tended to be profitable and large with a
 mean ROA of 1.157 and mean employee size of
 32,515.

 An overall inspection of the correlations between
 CEO stakeholder orientation measures and pollution
 indices reveals no significant relationships. Positive,
 although fairly weak, relationships were found be
 tween ROA and the pollution indices of total toxic

 releases (r = 0.33) and direct toxic releases to air and
 water (r ? 0.27). Interestingly no significant relation
 ships were found between ROA and CEO-Stake
 holder-Orientations. Significant inter-correlations
 among the explanatory variables ranged from 0.22
 for size and employee orientation to 0.51 for em
 ployee and community orientations. While a cor
 relation of 0.51 is substantial, it would not introduce
 serious problems with multicollinearity (Hanushek
 and Jackson, 1977).

 An effective way to summarize the moderating

 effect of profitability on CEO stakeholder orienta
 tions and pollution performance is to examine the
 incremental effect of consecutive regression equa
 tions on Rsquare. To recapitulate, two regressions for

 each pollution category were run. The first model
 consisted of the control variable for size and main
 effects, while the second model consisted of the
 control variable for size, main effects and ROA X
 CEO-Stakeholder-Orientation interactions. The re
 sults of the hierarchial regressions are reported in
 Table II.

 Based on the results, our hypothesis is supported
 for the category of total toxic releases, a measure of
 overall pollution performance, the pollution cate
 gory of direct toxic releases of air and water, but not
 for off-site transfers and releases to sewage. The
 main effects model for the overall measure of total
 toxic releases was significant with an R2 of 0.22.
 However, ROA accounted for the majority of the

 explanatory variance and was the only significant
 explanatory variable. When the interaction terms
 were added to the model the main effect of ROA
 disappeared, while the change in R2 of 0.19 and the
 overall model R2 0.41 were both highly significant.
 The interaction term of ROA X CEO-Government
 Orientation was significant and positive, while ROA
 X CEO-Community-Orientation was significant
 and negative. These were the only significant ex
 planatory variables in the second order model.

 The first order model for direct release to air
 and water was not significant. Yet when the inter
 action terms were added to the model, both the
 change in R2 and the resulting model were sig
 nificant, with a AR2 = 0.22 and a model R2 = 0.34.
 Consistent with the total toxic releases category the
 only two significant explanatory variables were ROA
 X CEO-Government-Orientation and ROA X CEO
 Community-Orientation. Again the directional rela
 tionships were positive for the former and negative
 for the latter. The remaining two pollution cate
 gories, off-site transfers and toxic releases to sewage,
 when regressed on main effects and main effects plus
 interaction terms were not significant.

 Discussion

 The results lend convincing support to the idea that
 there is a relationship between managerial intentions
 and overall pollution performance when that rela
 tionship is considered within the context of firm
 profitability. In the case of total and direct toxic
 releases, profitability appears to moderate the CEO's
 responsiveness to the expectations of specific stake
 holder groups. While the moderating effect of
 profitability on CEO-stakeholder orientation is not
 always in the direction one might expect, the results
 lend support to the argument that firm outcomes are
 a function of managerial discretion (Hambrick and
 Finkelstein, 1987) as well as the constrains of eco
 nomic performance, especially in the pursuit of less
 profit oriented goals (Ansoff, 1990).

 Considered alone, none of the CEO stakeholder
 orientation scores were related to pollution perform
 ance. One might expect, for example, a different
 level of performance from a firm with a CEO who
 expresses heightened concern for community or
 governmental expectations. Given the cost of pollu

 tion control, it may well be that the inclination to
 support community expectations is constrained by
 the ability of the firm to support those efforts. On
 the other hand, if profitability operated only as a
 constraining factor, one might expect a negative
 relationship between financial and pollution per
 formance rather than the positive relationship actu
 ally found.

 The simple rationale, then, that more profitable

 firms would be better able and so would be more
 inclined to invest in pollution control is not sup
 ported. This position assumes that the decision to
 lower toxic emissions is primarily a financial one.
 There is evidence to suggest, however, that when
 faced with what may be viewed as a discretionary
 expense, a CEO acts in a fashion consistent with his
 or her own values (Lerner and Fryxell, 1991). Appar
 ently other conditions must exist before lowering
 total toxic emissions become a firm priority. Indeed,
 the addition of the interaction terms provides much
 greater explanatory power.

 CEO Community-orientation, when considered

 within the context of financial performance, is
 significantly associated with lower overall total
 releases and direct toxic releases. Community stake
 holder groups are probably the most directly affected
 by pollution. The significance of the interaction
 term would suggest that while a CEO may have a
 strong community orientation, and consequently be
 concerned about the effects of pollution on the
 community, the ability to act upon his or her's
 values is restricted by economic performance. This
 may be especially true if pollution control is viewed
 as a discretionary expense, in which case the values
 of the CEO may well influence how firm profits are
 reinvested or distributed to stockholders.

 For their part, stockholders and customers are

 probably less likely to be directly affected by pollution
 or be concerned with a corporation's pollution per
 formance. While some stockholders and customers
 may consider pollution performance an important
 issue, the vast majority are far enough removed from
 the affects of a particular corporation's pollution not
 to consider it relevant. Moreover, previous research
 that has tried to link pollution performance with
 market based performance measures and customer
 perceptions has resulted in tenuous results at best
 (for a review of the literature see Ullman, 1985).
 With regard to CEO-Employee-Orientation, as

 employees are simultaneously members of the firm
 and the community, a CEO's concern with em
 ployee expectations on the job is likely fulfilled by
 OSHA requirements, while concern for employees
 off the job is reflected in his or her community
 orientation. This could explain the lack of signifi
 cance for the CEO-Employee-Orientation interac
 tion variable.

 More complex is the strong positive relationship

 between pollution performance and the ROA X
 GEO Government-Orientation interaction variable.
 It is likely that firms which are more profitable
 would be under greater pressure from governmental
 agencies to lower pollution levels. In the same vein,
 companies which are losing money probably do not
 feel the same pressure to meet governmental expec
 tations. Perhaps firms which pollute more, especially
 when profits are high, feel vulnerable to government
 pressure, hence the increased attention to govern
 ment expectations. This would be consistent with
 organizational theory which suggests that organiza
 tions attempt to adjust to environmental demands
 through cooptation (Selznick, 1948). For example,
 Waste Management and its subsidiaries currently
 employee nine former EPA officials. Five of these
 individuals are vice presidents for Waste Manage
 ment and four are attorneys (Sanjour, 1992).

 An examination of the questionnaire items per
 taining to government orientation does suggest that
 CEOs with high government orientations support
 and respond to government policies, agencies and
 regulations. Ironically, many government policies
 may actually encourage activities the EPA seeks to
 control (e.g. nuclear energy, heavy industrial indus
 tries surrounding defense contracting, policies on
 fluorocarbons, etc.). Perhaps the commitment of
 CEOs to respond to government expectations is con
 comitant with the firm's ability to reduce the threat
 of EPA penalties.

 It is also interesting to note that while the results
 support the notion that economic performance
 moderates the relationship between stakeholder
 orientation and total pollution performance as well
 as direct toxic releases, that support was not found
 for the remaining two pollution categories. Perhaps
 these findings can best be understood by a closer
 examination of the relative importance of pollution
 performance to CEOs.

 One plausible explanation for the significance of
 the total market releases model is that, strategically,
 CEOs tend to be less concerned with particulars and
 more concerned with the big picture. Off-site
 transfers, direct releases, and releases to sewage
 are more plant specific measures of pollution per
 formance, as certain plants may dispose of toxic
 materials differently depending upon the sewage
 capacity of the local community or the type of
 toxic material being handled. Conversely, a measure
 of total pollution captures the entire corporation's
 pollution performance. However, this would not
 explain the significance of direct releases to air and
 water.

 While in general it might be concluded that
 CEOs are more concerned with the big picture, their
 attention may be drawn to specific issues that are
 considered strategically important. Given the num
 ber of lawsuits and negative publicity that have
 surrounded toxic dumping in the past (i.e. Love
 Canal and Champion International), the relative
 strategic importance of direct releases to air and
 water becomes more apparent. The media and the
 public seemingly pay considerably less attention to
 off-site transfers and releases to sewage (both are
 out-of-site, out-of-mind) thus reducing their poten
 tial for becoming strategically important issues.

 Finally, although pollution performance is a
 relevant social issue, an important caveat to keep in
 mind when interpreting the results is not to infer it
 as a proxy measure for social performance. The
 categorization of pollution performance into four
 categories was specifically done to more thoroughly
 assess the relationship of pollution performance with
 CEO Stakeholder-Orientations. Those relationships
 differ depending on the particular measure of pollu
 tion performance under examination, a finding
 which also supports prior research (Lerner and
 Fryxell, 1988).

 Limitations

 Before proceedings with conclusions, two limitations
 warrant further comment. First the use of cross
 sectional data makes it impossible to claim causality,
 although we do not hypothesize or claim causality in
 the tested relationship. Second the results are prob

 ably not generalizable beyond the stable corporate
 giants of the FORTUNE 500. CEOs of smaller and
 entrepreneurial firms may have more flexibility in
 meeting the expectations of specific stakeholder
 groups and also may have more direct control of
 corporate outcomes such as pollution. Alternatively,
 economic constraints may be more problematic for
 many smaller and entrepreneurial firms as their
 access to capital is more restricted, thus potentially
 limiting their ability to meet stakeholder expecta
 tions with regards to pollution performance.

 Conclusions

 Overall the fact that relationships between CEO
 stakeholder orientations and pollution performance
 exist in the presence of ROA but not in its absence,
 suggests that economic performance is indeed a
 moderating variable in this relationship. The influ
 ence of profitability on that relationship, however,
 depends on the particular stakeholder-orientation
 variable under consideration. It is not sufficient to
 say that profitability acts as a constraint. Apparently
 it only does in the presence of a strong commitment
 to community interests or expectations. In situations
 where this commitment does not exist, profitable
 companies may actually feel increased vulnerability
 to government expectations and so devote increased
 attention to constraining the effect of government
 regulation.

 As the ramifications from pollution take on
 heightened importance, these findings raise some
 questions about the tendency to rely on govern
 mental pressure to obtain compliance with regula
 tions. While there is a strong relationship between
 CEO government-orientation and toxic releases, it is
 not in the expected direction. Increased attention to
 governmental expectations is associated with worse
 performance, not superior performance. Rather than
 penalizing firms for poor pollution performance,
 it might be more prudent to offer incentives, par
 ticularly ones which may generate a more positive
 relationship between the firm and the larger com
 munity.

 These results also suggest the efficacy of using
 strategic dimensions when examining corporate out
 comes that have social implications. Ullman (1985)

 states the exclusion of strategic dimensions has
 resulted in the inconclusiveness of findings on such
 issues as economic performance and social perform
 ance. Perhaps the most important implication of
 these findings is their potential relevance to social
 performance models. The results tend to suggest that
 three criteria are necessary in order for firms to
 respond to important social issues. First, the social
 issue must be strategically relevant to the firm.
 Second, the CEO must care about the issue and its
 impact on specific stakeholder groups, and third, the
 firm must have the economic capability to respond.
 It therefore might be appropriate to think of social
 performance models in terms of inter-dependent
 dimensions that consist of managerial values, strategic
 relevance, and economic performance.
