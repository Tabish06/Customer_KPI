 Summary An increasing number of scholars and practitioners have emphasized the importance of

 'feelings of ownership' for the organization (even when employees are not legal owners).
 In this exploratory study, we examine the relationships of psychological ownership with work
 attitudes and work behaviors. We start by developing hypotheses based on the psychology of
 possession and psychological ownership literatures. We then test these hypotheses with data
 from three field samples, using responses from over 800 employees, as well as manager and
 peer observations of employee behavior. Results demonstrate positive links between psycho-
 logical ownership for the organization and employee attitudes (organizational commitment,
 job satisfaction, organization-based self-esteem), and work behavior (performance and orga-
 nizational citizenship). More important, psychological ownership increased explained var-
 iance in organization-based self-esteem and organizational citizenship behavior (both peer
 and supervisor observations of citizenship), over and above the effects of job satisfaction
 and organizational commitment. Contrary to prior theoretical work on psychological owner-
 ship, results, however, fail to show an incremental value of psychological ownership in pre-
 dicting employee performance. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

 Introduction

 The idea of psychological ownership for the organization (i.e., the possessive feeling that some object
 is 'MINE' or 'OURS') has received increasing attention from scholars and practitioners as a poten-
 tially important predictor of employee attitudes and behaviors (Brown, 1989; Dirks, Cummings, &
 Pierce, 1996; Peters, 1988; Pierce, Rubenfeld, & Morgan, 1991; Pierce, Kostova, & Dirks, 2001;
 VandeWalle, Van Dyne, & Kostova, 1995). Psychological ownership is the psychologically experi-
 enced phenomenon in which an employee develops possessive feelings for the target.

 An extensive amount of research in a wide variety of fields (child development, geography,

 philosophy, gerontology, psychology, law, and consumer behavior) emphasizes the importance of

 possessions and ownership in influencing human attitudes, motivation, and behavior. For example,
 scholars have addressed legal and psychological perspectives on ownership (cf. Etzioni, 1991; James
 1890/1950/1963) and links to self-identity, self-adjustment, and well-being (cf. Kasser & Ryan, 1993)
 as well as ownership of tangible (e.g., home, toys) and intangible (e.g., ideas) objects (Isaacs, 1933;
 Rochberg-Halton, 1980). In the management literature, scholars (cf. Rousseau & Shperling, 2003;
 Tannenbaum, 1983) have addressed the role of formal organizational ownership arrangements (e.g.,
 cooperatives and employee stock ownership plans), as well as the role of psychological ownership
 (Dirks et al., 1996; Pendleton, Wilson, & Wright, 1998; Pierce et al., 1991, 2001).

 In this paper, we suggest that the possessive nature of psychological ownership for the organization
 differentiates it from other work-related attitudes while simultaneously (and more importantly) allow-
 ing psychological ownership for the organization to increase our understanding of employee attitudes
 and behavior, by explaining variance over and above existing constructs (such as commitment and
 satisfaction). In other words, even though psychological ownership should be related to other work-
 related attitudes, it has a fundamentally different conceptual base (possession) and, accordingly,
 should differ in its explanatory power. We develop this idea later in the paper by drawing on the lit-
 erature on possessions (Belk, 1988; Rudmin, 1991) and the psychology of possession (Furby, 1978,
 1991; James, 1890/1950/1963) to argue and then empirically demonstrate the value-added nature of
 psychological ownership for the organization.

 To date, we are aware of only three published empirical studies that have examined psychological
 ownership. VandeWalle et al. (1995) examined psychological ownership of housing cooperative resi-
 dents and showed relationships of psychological ownership with commitment and satisfaction to the
 cooperative and self-perceptions of extra-role behavior. Pendleton et al.'s (1998) study of four U.K. bus
 companies showed feelings of ownership were related to satisfaction, involvement, integration, com-
 mitment, and self-perceived changes in attitudes and work-related behaviors. Finally, Parker, Wall, and
 Jackson's work on quality management (1997) showed production ownership was linked to concerns
 for unfinished work.

 Our research differs from these prior studies because we emphasize possession as the unique core of
 psychological ownership for the organization. We also include observer perceptions of performance
 and organizational citizenship to avoid self-presentation biases, and we examine its incremental con-
 tribution in explaining employee behavior, over and above that of the two most commonly researched
 employee attitudes: organizational commitment and job satisfaction.

 Building on the psychological ownership theoretical framework introduced by Pierce et al.
 (2001), we examined the relationships between psychological ownership for the organization and
 employee work attitudes (organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and self-concept) and two
 employee work behaviors (performance and organizational citizenship). We start with a brief summary
 of the psychology of possession literature (e.g., Furby, 1978), discuss psychological ownership for the
 organization, and develop hypotheses based on the psychology of ownership and property literatures
 (Pierce et al., 2001). We test our predictions with three field samples and conclude by discussing both
 theoretical and practical implications of our work.

 The Psychology of Possession

 A sense of possession (feeling as though an object, entity, or idea is 'MINE' or 'OURS') is the core of
 psychological ownership (Furby, 1978). Possessive feelings are ubiquitous, can refer to tangible or
 intangible objects (Beaglehole, 1932; James, 1890), and can occur based on legal ownership or in

 the absence of legal ownership (Wilpert, 1991). Scholars in a wide variety of fields note the close con-
 nection between possessions, feelings of possession, and feelings of ownership. For example, Etzioni
 (1991) described ownership as a 'dual creation, part attitude, part object, part in the mind, part "real"'
 (p. 466). James (1890/1950/1963) noted that 'a man's Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his,
 not only his body and his psychic powers, but his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his repu-
 tation' (pp. 291-292). In sum, people tend to equate feelings of possession with feelings of ownership
 (Dittmar, 1992; Furby, 1978). In the next three paragraphs, we draw more specifically on the psychol-
 ogy of possession research to discuss links with attitudes, self-concept, and sense of responsibility.

 Attitudes

 The psychology of possession literature demonstrates that people feel positively about tangible and
 intangible targets of ownership. For example, Beggan (1992) proposed the idea of 'mere ownership
 effects' based on empirical analysis of reactions to perceptions of ownership. Results of this study
 showed that people evaluated ideas and objects more favorably when they felt a sense of ownership
 for the target. In other words, feelings of psychological ownership lead to positive attitudes about the
 entity (Nuttin, 1987).

 Self-concept

 The psychology of possession also proposes that feelings of ownership cause people to view tangible
 and intangible possessions as part of the extended self (Belk, 1988; Dittmar, 1992; Furby, 1978). For
 example, James (1890) linked 'mine' and 'me': 'We feel and act about certain things that are ours very
 much as we feel and act about ourselves' (p. 291). Sartre (1943/1969) observed that 'the totality of my
 possessions reflects the totality of my being ... I am what I have ... What is mine is myself' (pp. 591-
 592). Thus, tangible and intangible possessions and feelings of psychological ownership become
 linked to the self-concept (Furby, 1978).

 Sense of responsibility

 According to Beaglehole (1932) and Furby (1978), possessions and feelings of ownership trigger a
 sense of responsibility for the entity. For example, Hall (1966) argued that possession causes indivi-
 duals to protect and defend their ownership rights. The property rights literature also emphasizes pro-
 tecting and enhancing possessions (Wilpert, 1991). This includes improvements and controlling or
 limiting access by others.

 In sum, theory and research on the psychology of possession link feelings of ownership with positive
 attitudes about the target of ownership, the self-concept, and sense of responsibility for the target. In
 the next section, we draw on these fundamental processes to further define and specify the construct of
 psychological ownership.

 Psychological Ownership for the Organization

 Psychological ownership is the psychologically experienced phenomenon in which an employee
 develops possessive feelings for the target. Building on Furby (1978) and Dittmar (1992), Pierce

 and colleagues (2001) linked feelings of possession with feelings of ownership and defined psycholo-
 gical ownership as the state in which an individual feels that an object (i.e., material or immaterial) is
 experienced possessively (i.e., it's 'MINE' or it is 'OURS').'

 Pierce, Kostova, and Dirks (2001, 2003) described psychological ownership as an attitude with both
 affective and cognitive elements. They illustrate this with the following commonly used phrases that
 denote feelings of ownership or possession. For example, 'She is MY daughter,' or 'That is OUR
 house!' include both affective and cognitive information based on affective judgments and more
 abstract beliefs. This is consistent with basic psychological research on attitudes (Breckler & Wiggins,
 1989) and with Weiss and Cropanzano's (1996) Affective Events Theory that differentiates beliefs
 about the job from emotional experiences at work. Affective Events Theory proposes that different
 attitudes have different mixes or relative proportions of affective and cognitive elements. Extending
 this idea and applying it to psychological ownership, we propose that psychological ownership is dif-
 ferent from other work-related attitudes and has unique explanatory power because its conceptual core
 is feelings of possession that trigger affect-driven behaviors. In other words, psychological ownership
 consists, in part, of an emotional attachment to the organization that transcends the mere cognitive
 evaluation of the firm.

 This tight connection between possession and feelings of ownership can be directed at the organiza-
 tion (or workplace) as a whole or at specific aspects of the organization such as the group, job, work
 tools (i.e., a computer or production machine), or work itself. Different targets of ownership can vary in
 salience, depending on the individual and the situation. For example, some employees have psycho-
 logical ownership for their work and others might have ownership feelings for the overall organization.
 In this investigation, we focus on the organization as the target of feelings of ownership (psychological
 ownership for the organization).

 Conceptual distinctiveness of psychological ownership

 Pierce et al. (2001) theorized that psychological ownership can be differentiated from other constructs
 based on its conceptual core (possessiveness) and motivational bases. They argued that psychological
 ownership satisfies three basic human needs: 'home' (having a sense of place), efficacy and effectance,
 and self-identity. When employees experience psychological ownership, they are able to satisfy these
 basic needs.

 The first need (to have a 'place' or home) is the basic need to have a sense of belonging. Ardrey
 (1966), Duncan (1981), and Porteous (1976) argued that possessions such as those captured symboli-
 cally by 'home' provide individuals with a sense of place. According to philosopher Simone Weil
 (1952), having a place is an important 'need of the human soul' (p. 41) because the soul 'feels isolated,
 lost, if it is not surrounded by objects which seem to it like an extension of the bodily members' (p. 33).
 Porteous (1976) argued that home is not only a plot of land and four walls, but it can also be a village,
 compound, or neighborhood. Home, or a sense that this space is mine, provides a context for comfort,
 pleasure, and security (Heidegger, 1967).

 'From a Western, individualistic cultural tradition, the word 'our' suggests two simultaneous relationships. First, it implies that
 the object of possession has a connection with the self (me/my). Second, it also signals that the possessive relationship is shared
 with other individuals (us/our). For example, the phrase 'she is OUR daughter' indicates she is 'MY' daughter as well as my
 spouse's daughter. Thus, 'OUR' indicates a collective target of possession. This same connotation applies in organizational
 settings when groups of employees acquire a sense of psychological ownership for the organization. We acknowledge cultural
 differences in the use and meaning of possessive terms such as 'my' and 'our.' For example, although some cultures tend to use
 'my' and 'our' interchangeably when referring to collective entities, other cultures do not recognize individual ownership.

 PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP 443

 Feeling efficacious is a general human need to feel capable in specific areas (Bandura, 1977). Effec-

 tance motivation is the need to feel capable of interacting effectively in a setting (White, 1959). For
 example, having a red sports car helps some people feel powerful. Others gain a sense of capability by
 feeling they cause things to happen. Thus, possessions facilitate feelings of control and influence over
 both tangible and intangible items (Pierce, O'Driscoll, & Coghlan, in press).

 Self-identity is the final need identified by Pierce et al. (2001). It is the need to have a clear sense of

 self (Burke & Reitzes, 1991). Possessions and a sense of 'mine' help people know the self. 'Posses-
 sions are repositories of memories of one's self-identity in the past' (Cram & Paton, 1993, p. 19). Pos-
 sessions are also symbolic expressions of the self that show core values or individuality (Abelson &
 Prentice, 1989; Dittmar, 1992; Porteous, 1976).

 Differentiating psychological ownership for the organization conceptually from other work-related

 attitudes (e.g., organizational commitment, organizational identification, internalization, psychologi-
 cal empowerment, job involvement, and job satisfaction) is important to avoid construct proliferation
 (Morrow, 1983). The focus or 'question' answered by each of these relationship constructs is different.
 Psychological ownership for the organization asks 'How much do I feel this organization (workplace)
 is mine?' Organizational commitment asks 'Why should I maintain my membership in this organiza-
 tion?' (i.e., because I want to, because I need to, or because I ought to?) (Meyer & Allen, 1997). Orga-
 nizational identification asks 'Who am I?' (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994; Mael & Tetrick,
 1992; Pratt, 1998). Internalization asks 'What do I believe?' (O'Reilly & Chatman, 1986). Psycholo-
 gical empowerment asks 'Do I feel capable and intrinsically motivated in my work role?' (Spreitzer,
 1995). Job involvement asks 'How important is the job and job performance to my self-image?'
 (Lawler & Hall, 1970). Finally, job satisfaction asks 'What evaluative judgments do I make about
 my job?' (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996).

 Feeling a sense of ownership for the organization (feeling possessiveness and feeling that the orga-

 nization is 'MINE' or 'OURS') is fundamentally different from feeling the desire, need, or obligation
 to remain in an organization (organizational commitment: Meyer & Allen, 1997). It is different from
 using a distinctive and admired characteristic of the organization to define the self (organizational
 identification: Mael & Tetrick, 1992). It is different from association based on goal congruence (inter-
 nalization: O'Reilly & Chatman, 1986). Psychological ownership for the organization is different from
 feeling capable and intrinsically motivated at work (psychological empowerment: Spreitzer, 1996). It
 differs from being consumed by work and having the job as a central life interest (job involvement:
 Lawler & Hall, 1970). Finally, the possessive feeling that some object is 'MINE' or 'OURS' differ-
 entiates psychological ownership from positive or negative evaluative judgments of the job or job
 situation (job satisfaction: Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996).

 In the next section, we address the relationship of psychological ownership for the organization with
 employee attitudes and behaviors. Here we build on the above arguments that psychological ownership
 is distinct from other constructs and develop the logic for our hypotheses.

 Psychological Ownership and Employee Attitudes and Behaviors

 The psychology of possession identifies three fundamental outcomes associated with feelings of pos-
 session: positive attitudes toward the target, enhanced self-concept, and a sense of responsibility
 (Furby, 1978, 1991). In work organizations, we suggest that this sense of possession (which allows
 individuals to satisfy their basic needs for place, efficacy and effectance, and self-identity) is key to
 work-related attitudes (commitment and satisfaction), self-concept (organizational-based self-esteem),
 and behaviors (performance and organizational citizenship).

 Work-related attitudes

 Organizational commitment is the psychological attachment individuals feel for the organization
 (O'Reilly & Chatman, 1986). Organizational commitment asks 'Should I maintain my membership
 in this organization and why?' Those with strong commitment want to continue their organizational
 affiliation. Affective commitment is the strength of emotional attachment to the organization (based on
 positive attraction and a sense of belonging) (Meyer & Allen, 1997).

 As argued earlier, the psychology of possession shows that possessions give people a sense of place,
 belonging, and personal space (Porteous, 1976). Thus, possessions and feelings of ownership satisfy
 the basic human need for place. According to Beggan (1992) and the 'mere ownership effect,' people
 generally become more attached to things they feel they possess than similar things that they do not
 feel they possess. Since feeling a sense of attachment and belonging are the essence of organizational
 commitment, it seems reasonable to predict a positive relationship between psychological ownership
 for the organization and organizational commitment. In other words, feeling possessive toward the
 organization (psychological ownership) should lead to high levels of organizational commitment.
 Through a sense of possession for the organization, employees view it as a place in which to dwell
 ('home')-a place that provides a psychic comfort and security (Dittmar, 1992; Furby, 1978; Pierce
 et al., 2001). Accordingly,

 Hypothesis la: Psychological ownership will be positively related to organizational commitment.

 Extending our logic for links between psychological ownership for the organization and commit-
 ment, we also propose that feelings of ownership for the organization have implications for other
 work-related attitudes, such as satisfaction. General satisfaction is a positive or negative evaluative
 judgment of the overall job situation, and job satisfaction is the more proximal positive or negative
 evaluative judgment of the job (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996). Job satisfaction asks 'How do I evaluate
 my job?' We propose that feelings of possession for the organization (psychological ownership)
 enhance general satisfaction and provide the context (or environment) in which job satisfaction is
 embedded (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). When evaluative judgments about the organization and orga-
 nizational experiences are positive, this provides an overall framework that should influence evaluative
 judgments of job satisfaction.

 The theory of psychological ownership argues that a sense of possession directed toward the orga-

 nization satisfies three basic human motives (efficacy and effectance, self-identity, and having a place
 or home) and produces positive evaluative judgments (Pierce et al., 2003). This is consistent with the
 possession research that demonstrates that people develop favorable evaluations of their possessions
 (Beggan, 1992) and judge owned objects more favorably than similar, un-owned objects (Nuttin,
 1987). Thus, when organizational members feel possessive toward the organization (they have influ-
 ence and control at work, intimate knowledge about the organization, and feel they have invested
 themselves in their organizational roles), they should have high levels of general satisfaction, which
 in turn should influence job satisfaction. In contrast, if these needs are not met (low psychological own-
 ership), both general and more specific evaluative judgments should be negative. In sum, we propose a
 positive relationship between feelings of possession directed at the organization (psychological own-
 ership for the organization) and positive evaluative judgments directed at the job (job satisfaction).

 Hypothesis lb: Psychological ownership will be positively related to job satisfaction.

 Furby's second major theme from the psychology of possession is enhanced self-concept. As

 described above, feelings of possession are linked to the self (Belk, 1988; Dittmar, 1992) and only
 a fine line separates 'mine' from 'me' (James, 1890/1950/1963). In organizations, an important

 self-construct is organization-based self-esteem (Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, & Dunham, 1989).
 Organization-based self-esteem is an employee's self-concept as a member of the work organization.
 This is a special sense of self that emerges from organizational experiences (Jex & Elacqua, 1999;
 Pierce et al., 1989; Tang & Peng, 1997) and reflects employee evaluations of personal adequacy
 and self-worth within the organizational context.

 When employees develop a sense of ownership for the organization, the psychology of possession

 suggests that these feelings of ownership become an extension of self-concept (Furby, 1978). Posses-
 sions can symbolize the self and show core values (Abelson & Prentice, 1989; Dittmar, 1992; Porteous,
 1976). Psychologically experienced possessions (both tangible and intangible) thus become positive
 expressions of the self and serve basic human needs for self-identity and self-enhancement (Dipboye,
 1977; Korman, 2001). Thus, we hypothesized that when employees feel the organization is their per-
 sonal psychological property, they will also have positive self-assessments of themselves as members
 of the organization.

 Hypothesis 2a: Psychological ownership will be positively related to employee self-esteem within
 the organizational context (i.e., organization-based self-esteem).

 We also propose that to make a meaningful contribution to the literature, psychological ownership

 for the organization must improve our ability to predict over and above other work-related attitudes
 such as commitment and satisfaction (Morrow, 1983). To date, research has demonstrated that com-
 mitment and satisfaction are related to organization-based self-esteem (cf. Gardner & Pierce, 1998;
 Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000). Thus, emphasizing the unique emphasis of psychological ownership
 on possessions and sense of possession (Pierce et al., 2001), we propose psychological ownership for
 the organization will improve predictions of organization-based self-esteem beyond commitment and
 satisfaction.

 Hypothesis 2b: Psychological ownership will increase explained variance in organization-based
 self-esteem, over and above the effects of organizational commitment and job satisfaction.

 Work behaviors

 The third theme highlighted in the psychology of possession literature is sense of responsibility. Bea-
 glehole (1932) and Furby (1978) argue that feelings of possession create a sense of responsibility that
 influences behavior. When individuals have possessive feelings, they proactively enhance, control, and
 protect both tangible and intangible targets of ownership (Hall, 1966). When employees feel a sense of
 psychological ownership or possession toward the organization, work acquires existential significance
 (Wilpert, 1991) that triggers active participation (Dirks et al., 1996; Rochberg-Halton, 1980). Drawing
 on the close link between feelings of ownership and active involvement, we focus on performance and
 citizenship.

 As noted above, Pierce et al. (2001) theorized that psychological ownership addresses three basic

 human needs: having a sense of place, efficacy and effectance, and self-identity. We propose that when
 these basic needs are fulfilled in an organizational context employees will be proactive in protecting
 and enhancing the target of their feelings of ownership. Thus, employees should be proactive in mak-
 ing behavioral contributions to the organization. When organizations provide employees with a valued
 sense of belonging (place), sense of efficacy and effectance, and sense of self-identity, they will be
 motivated to reciprocate (Gouldner, 1960). In other words, psychological ownership for the organiza-
 tion causes feelings of responsibility that lead to investing time and energy to benefit the organization.

 This psychology of 'mine' should lead to conscientious role behaviors and high levels of job perfor-
 mance.2 Thus, we hypothesized:

 Hypothesis 3a: Psychological ownership will be positively related to employee performance.

 We return to our earlier point that psychological ownership for the organization must go beyond

 existing research. To date, prior research has demonstrated that commitment and satisfaction can be
 related to work performance (Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, 2001; Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, &
 Topolnytsky, 2002). Thus, psychological ownership must make a unique contribution to performance
 beyond that accounted for by commitment and satisfaction. Since possession (the core of psychologi-
 cal ownership) is fundamentally different from feeling attached (committed) or having positive eva-
 luations (satisfied), we propose that the sense of responsibility triggered by feelings of psychological
 ownership for the organization will increase explained variance in employee job performance beyond
 that provided by these two work-related attitudes. Accordingly,

 Hypothesis 3b: Psychological ownership will increase explained variance in employee perfor-
 mance, over and above the effects of commitment and job satisfaction.

 Our second work behavior is organizational citizenship (discretionary work behaviors that contri-

 bute to organizational well-being, but are not part of formal job expectations) (Organ, 1988). Prior
 research demonstrates that organizational citizenship is related to organizational commitment and
 job satisfaction (LePine, Erez, & Johnson, 2002). Here we extend this research and propose that feel-
 ings of ownership and possession should be especially relevant to non-prescribed behavior (such as
 OCB) because organizations cannot sanction lack of citizenship and employees choose to contribute
 OCB based on personal experiences. When employees find their needs for belonging, efficacy and
 effectance, and self-identity are met based on a sense of possession or psychological ownership for
 the organization (Pierce et al., 2001) this triggers a sense of responsibility.

 Feelings of 'mine' cause proactive behavior aimed at protecting and enhancing the target of own-

 ership (Beaglehole, 1932; Wilpert, 1991). In addition, when employees feel that the organization con-
 tributes to their basic needs, they reciprocate by making positive, proactive contributions to the
 organization. For example, Pierce et al. (1991, 2001) and Van Dyne et al. (1995) proposed that psy-
 chological ownership would be related to extra-role behaviors. These volitional behaviors include
 helping co-workers, volunteering for special tasks, and orienting new employees. In sum, we propose
 that a sense of possessiveness causes discretionary actions intended to benefit the organization. In addi-
 tion, consistent with the unique role of possession, we propose that psychological ownership for the
 organization will add explanatory power beyond organizational commitment and job satisfaction.
 Thus,

 Hypothesis 4a: Psychological ownership will be positively related to organizational citizenship.

 Hypothesis 4b: Psychological ownership will increase explained variance in organizational citizen-
 ship behavior, over and above the effects of commitment and job satisfaction.

 In summary, we have hypothesized that, based on feelings of possession, psychological ownership
 for the organization will be related to commitment, satisfatiion, organization-based self-esteem, per-
 formance, and organizational citizenship behavior. We also proposed that psychological ownership
 will account for variance that is unaccounted for by commitment and satisfaction.

 2While we posit a positive relationship between psychological ownership and performance, we acknowledge that this
 relationship is unlikely to be direct. Instead, as with most attitude-behavior relationships (e.g., commitment-performance),
 motivation and other psychological processes most likely mediate the connection.

 Organizational Context

 PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP 447

 Multiple Settings
 We tested our model with data from three field samples in order to increase the generalizability of
 our findings and to represent a broad range of regional, firm, job, and respondent characteristics. All
 data were collected from employees working in the United States. Accordingly, although some sam-
 ples may have included participants with different cultural backgrounds, the majority of respon-
 dents were U.S. citizens and represent the diversity of the national culture in the United States.

 Multiple Firms
 The first two studies were conducted in specific organizations and thus relationships that we report
 may have been influenced by the location of each firm within the country (midwest and southeast).
 The third sample addresses this possibility because it sampled a broad range of employees from a
 wide range of organizations from throughout the country.

 Multiple Types and Levels of Jobs
 Overall, respondents represent employees holding clerical, office, supervisory, professional, and man-
 agement jobs, further increasing the applicability of our results. In Sample 1, participants were exempt
 employees (managers, professionals, and supervisors) from the top four levels in the organizational
 hierarchy. In Sample 2, participants were exempt and non-exempt employees (managers, professionals,
 supervisors, clerical, and office staff). In Sample 3, participants were exempt professionals who held
 jobs such as accountant, auditor, purchasing agent, mechanical engineer, and software engineer.

 Multiple Respondents
 In Studies 1 and 2, we obtained data from employees. In Study 3, we expanded our design and
 included data from employees, their supervisors, and their work group peers.

 Employees
 Each sample represents a different proportion of males and females (Sample 1: 87 per cent male;
 Sample 2: 57 per cent male; Sample 3: 39 per cent male). In Sample 3, typical participants had
 college degrees, were 34 years in age, and had worked for their current employers for 7 years.

 Supervisors
 In Sample 3, we obtained matched data from the employee's supervisors for 68 per cent of the
 respondents.

 Work Group Peers
 In Sample 3, we obtained matched data from the employee's work group peers for 76 per cent of the
 respondents.

 Generalizability of Results
 In sum, our use of multiple settings, multiple firms, multiple types and levels of jobs, and multiple
 respondents increases our confidence in the applicability of our findings to a wide range of firms,
 jobs, and employees in the United States. We recommend that future research examine psycholo-
 gical ownership in other cultural settings.

 Method

 To increase generalizability of our research and to replicate our analyses of psychological ownership,
 we conducted three convenience sample field studies including clerical, office, supervisory, profes-
 sional, and management jobs from different areas of the United States. We tested hypotheses sepa-
 rately in each sample. Sample 1 is 186 managers, professionals, and supervisors from the top four
 hierarchical levels of a MidWestern electrical utility (88 per cent response rate; 87 per cent male).
 In Sample 2, 409 employees from a variety of functional units representing all but the top two levels
 of the hierarchy in a southeast diversified services organization completed questionnaires (90 per cent
 response rate; 57 per cent male). Sample 3 is 227 professional employees (accountant, auditor, pur-
 chasing agent, mechanical engineer, and software engineer; 61 per cent female) from a wide range of
 organizations from throughout the country who provided data and contact information for their super-
 visors and peers as part of a professional development seminar. On average, participants had a college
 degree, were 34 years old, and had 7 years organizational tenure. We obtained matched data from two
 peers for 173 of these employees (76 per cent response rate) and from supervisors for 154 employees
 (68 per cent response rate). Three months later, we obtained test-retest data on psychological owner-
 ship for 184 of the original 227 employees (81 per cent).

 Measurement of psychological ownership for the organization

 Although this field study focuses on substantive issues pertaining to psychological ownership for the
 organization, the study is exploratory because there is limited previous research that measures this psy-
 chological state and we are aware of no empirical work on the construct validation of psychological
 ownership for the organization. As a consequence, we include initial construct validation evidence as a
 precursor to our examination of the hypothesized relationships.

 Consistent with our earlier discussion of the core meaning of psychological ownership for the orga-

 nization, we emphasized possession as the basis of our attitudinal measure of psychological ownership
 and used possessive vocabulary such as reflected in everyday associations with property and posses-
 sions-'That idea was MINE,' 'This is MY office,' 'She is OUR daughter!'-for our items (cf. Furby,
 1978, 1991; Litwinski, 1942, 1947; Pierce et al., 2001).

 We had five judges (organizational behavior faculty) assess content validity of our measure (see
 Table 1). None identified any items as outside the theoretical domain (no contamination) and none
 proposed additional items to cover omitted aspects of the domain (no deficiency). A second, non-
 overlapping panel of three judges (undergraduate management majors) independently sorted randomly
 ordered items that assessed psychological ownership for the organization, commitment (Porter, Steers,
 Mowday, & Boulian, 1974), affective commitment (Meyer & Allen, 1991), organizational identifica-
 tion and internalization (O'Reilly & Chatman, 1986), job satisfaction (Smith, 1976), and job involve-
 ment (Lawler & Hall, 1970). Judgments for the initial seven psychological ownership items were 90
 per cent accurate (19 of the 21 ratings provided by the three judges).

 We examined the homogeneity and dimensionality of the ownership items with CFA (LISREL 8),

 using maximum likelihood estimation and listwise deletion (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). In Sample 1
 (n = 186), a one-factor model of the initial seven-item psychological ownership scale produced a sig-
 nificant chi-square (x2 = 31.56, 14 d.f., p <0.05, RMSEA = 0.09, CFI = 0.97). Completely standar-
 dized factor loadings ranged from 0.68 to 0.91 and all t-values were significant (10.18-15.67).
 Modification indices indicated the model could be improved by dropping the last three items. This
 improved the chi-square statistic such that it failed to reach significance (X2 = 5.29, 2 d.f., p > 0.05),

 PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP 449

 Table 1. Psychological ownership items

 Psychological ownership
 Instructions: Think about the home, boat or cabin that you own or co-own with someone, and the experiences and
 feelings associated with the statement 'THIS IS MY (OUR) HOUSE!' The following questions deal with the
 'sense of ownership' that you feel for the organization that you work for. Indicate the degree to which you
 personally agree or disagree with the following statements.

 Item
 1. This is MY organization.
 2. I sense that this organization is OUR company.
 3. I feel a very high degree of personal ownership for this organization.
 4. I sense that this is MY company.
 5. This is OUR company.
 6. Most of the people that work for this organization feel as though they own the company.
 7. It is hard for me to think about this organization as MINE. (reversed)

 with factor loadings 0.71-0.87 and t-values 10.64-13.97. In Sample 2 (n = 409), CFA of the revised
 measure again showed a non-significant chi-square (X2- 3.69, 2 d.f., p > 0.05, RMSEA - 0.05,
 CFI = 0.99), with factor loadings 0.76-0.91 and t-values 17.44-22.65. The chi-square was also non-
 significant in Sample 3 (X2 - 3.74, 2 d.f., p > 0.05, RMSEA = 0.06, CFIH 0.99, n - 227), with factor
 loadings 0.73-0.93 and t-values 11.32-17.99. Overall these results support homogeneity and unidi-
 mensionality of the psychological ownership measure.

 Cronbach's coefficient alpha showed acceptable internal consistency reliability (0.87, 0.90, and
 0.93) in each of the samples. In Sample 3, we also assessed test-retest reliability with 3-month lagged
 data. As expected for measurement of an attitude, stability was moderate (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), with T1
 mean = 4.70 (SD = 1.58) and T2 = 4.73 (SD = 1.48); T2 a = 0.89.

 Other measures

 In Sample 1, we measured organizational commitment with six items (e.g., I am proud to tell others that I
 am a part of this organization; I really care about the fate of this organization) (Porter et al., 1974; 1 =
 strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree; a = 0.88). In Samples 2 (a = 0.82) and 3 (a = 0.86), we measured
 affective commitment with four items (e.g., I would be happy to spend the rest of my career in this orga-
 nization; I enjoy discussing my organization with people outside it; Meyer & Allen, 1991; 1 = strongly
 disagree, 7 = strongly agree). In Samples 1 and 2, we assessed general job satisfaction with two items
 (e.g., satisfaction with supervision and good organization to work for; a = 0.77 and 0.77) (Smith, 1976;
 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). In Sample 3, we measured job satisfaction (a = 0.81) with
 four items (e.g., satisfaction with supervision and overall quality of work life (Kunin, 1955).

 In all three samples, we assessed organization-based self-esteem with five items (e.g., I COUNT
 around here; I make a DIFFERENCE around here; Pierce et al., 1989; 1 = strongly disagree, 5 =
 strongly agree; a = 0.86, 0.85, 0.91). In Sample 3, supervisors rated employee performance with five
 items from Van Dyne and LePine (1998) (e.g., quantity and quality of work, relationships with
 others, initiative, and reliability (1 = very much does not meet performance expectations, 7 = very
 much exceeds performance expectations; a = 0.92). Supervisors (a = 0.93) and peers (a = 0.93)
 also assessed organizational citizenship behavior with five items (e.g., volunteers to do things for
 this work group, helps orient new employees, attends functions that help the group; 1 = strongly
 disagree, 7 = strongly agree) from Van Dyne and LePine's (1998) helping organizational citizenship
 scale.

 450 L. VAN DYNE AND J. L. PIERCE

 We collected demographic information in Sample 3 because maturity, gender, and tenure can influ-
 ence performance at work (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998). Employees reported age (years), gender
 (1 = male; 2 = female), education (six ordered categories), and organizational tenure (months).

 We assessed distinctiveness of psychological ownership for the organization relative to other
 constructs using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In Sample 1, factor analyses of the
 17 items with principal component analyses (varimax rotation; scree plot; eigenvalues > 1.0) indicated
 four factors (68 per cent of the variance). All items loaded on expected factors (54-0.89, with highest
 cross loading = 0.43 versus primary loading = 0.68). In Sample 2, factor analysis of the 15 items
 produced four factors (73.3 per cent of the variance; loadings = 0.63-0.90, with highest cross-
 loading = 0.39 versus primary loading = 0.63). In Sample 3, the 32 items produced a seven-factor
 solution (73 per cent of the variance; loadings = 0.55-0.91, with highest cross-loading = 0.39 versus
 primary loading = 0.70).

 To further assess these relationships, we used LISREL to conduct nested model confirmatory factor
 analysis. In Sample 1, loadings for all items (n = 17) were significant, and nested comparisons showed
 significant improvement in model fit for each successive comparison: two-factor model was better than
 one-factor model (Ax2 = 138.27, 1 d.f.), three-factor better than two (Ax2 = 88.60, 2 d.f.), and four
 better than three (AX2 = 273.55, 3 d.f.). Since each of these exceeds the critical value based on degrees
 of freedom, results demonstrate the superiority of the hypothesized four-factor model. Nested model
 comparisons in Sample 2 were similar, showing successively better fit for models with more factors,
 ending with four factors better than three factors (Ax2 = 603.85, 3 d.f.). In Sample 3, nested model
 comparisons again showed that models with more factors produced better fit to the data (e.g., seven
 factors versus six factors (Ax2 = 702.16, 6 d.f.). In sum, these analyses differentiate psychological
 ownership for the organization from commitment, satisfaction, organization-based self-esteem, perfor-
 mance, and supervisor-rated and peer-rated OCB.

 We tested hypotheses with hierarchical regression. We used Change-F statistics to assess each

 regression step and t-values to interpret individual parameters.

 Results

 Results support Hypothesis 1a. In each sample, the correlation between psychological ownership for
 the organization and commitment (see Table 2) was significant (r =0.68, p< 0.001; r= 0.70,
 p < 0.001; r -0.40, p < 0.001). In Sample 3, regression results (see Table 3) show that after accounting
 for the demographic controls (age, education, gender, and organizational tenure) psychological own-

 ership for the organization increased explained variance in commitment by 15 per cent (AF-= 30.59,
 p <0.001). Results in all three samples support Hypothesis lb, showing a positive relationship
 between psychological ownership for the organization and job satisfaction (r=0.48, p < 0.001;
 r= 0.28, p < 0.001; r= 0.42, p < 0.001). In addition, in Sample 3 (see Table 3), psychological own-
 ership for the organization increased explained variance in satisfaction by 16 per cent (AF = 33.81,
 p < 0.001), beyond the controls. Hypothesis 2a was supported with a positive relationship between
 psychological ownership for the organization and organization-based self-esteem (r = 0.46,
 p < 0.001; r = 0.57, p < 0.001; r-= 0.45, p < 0.001). Results also support Hypothesis 2b (see Table 4).
 Psychological ownership for the organization increased explained variance in organizational-based
 self-esteem by 6 per cent (AF= 14.25, p <0.001, AF= 35.48, p <0.001, AF-= 15.37, p <0.001),
 showing psychological ownership for the organization has a unique relationship with organization-
 based self-esteem not accounted for by commitment or satisfaction.

 Hypothesis 3 predicted a positive relationship between psychological ownership for the organiza-

 tion and performance. Although the correlation in Table 2 is significant (r = 0.15, p < 0.05), regression
 results in Table 5 show that the beta for psychological ownership failed to reach significance
 (AF = 3.45, p < 0.10), after accounting for demographic controls. Similarly, psychological ownership
 for the organization did not increase explained variance in performance (see Table 6, step 3) beyond
 commitment and satisfaction (AF = 0.02, p > 0.05). Thus, results fail to support Hypothesis 3. Results
 support Hypotheses 4a and 4b, demonstrating a positive relationship between psychological ownership
 for the organization and organizational citizenship. We report two sets of results here because Sample
 3 includes supervisor and peer observations. Table 5 shows that psychological ownership added 7-9
 per cent to explained variance in citizenship beyond demographics (AF=-11.45, p<0.001;
 AF= 16.48, p < 0.001). In addition, psychological ownership for the organization continued to
 increase explained variance in supervisor- and peer-rated OCB (3-4 per cent), over and above the
 effects of commitment and satisfaction (in addition to demographics) (see Table 6: AF-4.50,
 p < 0.05; AF = 8.27, p < 0.01). In sum, psychological ownership for the organization provides

 attitudes/behaviors. Results demonstrate that psychological ownership for the organization increased
 explained variance in organizational citizenship behavior (for both supervisor and peer assessments of
 citizenship), over and above demographic characteristics, organizational commitment, and job satis-
 faction (Hypothesis 4). Results also demonstrate, as predicted, that psychological ownership was
 related to organizational commitment and to job satisfaction (Hypothesis 1). Finally, results show that
 psychological ownership added significantly to the prediction of organization-based self-esteem, over
 and above the effects of organizational commitment and job satisfaction (Hypothesis 2). Overall these
 findings are important because they show that psychological ownership for the organization increases
 our ability to predict and understand employee attitudes and behavior at work, over and above the two
 most commonly researched concepts that describe the employee-organizational relationship.

 Before we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our research, we note several impor-
 tant limitations. Although our objective was to examine psychological ownership for the organization
 across a broad range of jobs in a broad range of settings, our study is bounded by cultural and geo-
 graphic factors. Future research should examine psychological ownership in different settings such as
 in European settings where different legal arrangements and social programs may influence employee
 conceptualizations of ownership (Rousseau & Shperling, 2003). We also recommend research in non-
 Western settings where cultural values such as collectivism and role obligations may reduce the effects
 of psychological ownership on employee behavior.

 In addition, since our study is an initial step toward understanding the link between psychological

 ownership for the organization and workplace attitudes and behaviors, our model is incomplete and
 under-specified. Future research should consider a wider range of concepts that are theoretically rele-
 vant to psychological ownership. Similarly, although we examined the incremental validity of psycho-
 logical ownership over and above organizational commitment and job satisfaction, future research
 should further refine the distinctiveness of psychological ownership compared to a broader range of
 constructs. For example, it would be useful to compare the incremental validity of psychological own-
 ership with that of proactive personality (Crant, 2000) and psychological empowerment (Spreitzer,
 1995). Finally, while the pattern of observed relationships supports our hypotheses, the cross-sectional
 design prohibits causal inferences. We encourage other researchers to examine these relationships and
 to extend our work by using experimental and/or quasi-experimental designs that assess causality.

 In discussing theoretical implications, we note the interesting contrast for job performance versus
 organizational citizenship. While psychological ownership for the organization predicted citizenship
 (beyond the controls, commitment, and satisfaction), it did not add explanatory value to performance
 beyond that contributed by demographic characteristics, commitment and satisfaction (Hypothesis 3).
 Although this differs from past theoretical predictions (Pierce et al., 2001), the contrasting relation-
 ships for performance and citizenship are consistent with VandeWalle et al.'s (1995) results showing
 attitudes were more strongly related to discretionary behavior than to role performance.

 This contrast has important theoretical implications because it suggests psychological ownership for

 the organization has special relevance to volitional behavior such as organizational citizenship and
 extra-role behaviors. In contrast, psychological ownership for the organization may have less rele-
 vance to required behaviors where role constraints are a critical limit on individual variability in role
 performance (Organ, 1988; Van Dyne & LePine, 1998). Accordingly, we recommend additional theory
 development based on the psychology of possession (Furby, 1978; Wilpert, 1991) that delineates situa-
 tions where psychological ownership should have stronger versus weaker effects.

 Drawing on the psychology of possession, we recommend that future research refine conceptualiza-
 tion of the target of ownership. In this research, we focused on psychological ownership for the orga-
 nization. Yet, feelings of ownership can form around multiple targets (Beaglehole, 1932; Belk, 1988;
 James, 1890/1950/1963; Kline & France, 1899). Thus, researchers may want to extend past theorizing
 to include a more fine-grained view of psychological ownership. This could include possessiveness

 toward specific targets (such as the work group, work in general, work equipment, and products and
 services produced during work time). In addition, we think it would be interesting to develop theore-
 tical predictions specifying when certain targets of possession would be salient to employees and how
 feelings of possession for these specific targets might influence work-related attitudes and behavior.

 Future research should also assess an expanded set of outcomes. This could include positive feelings

 of empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995) or resistance to change (Dirks et al., 1996). For example, when
 change is externally imposed, employees with a strong sense of possession may feel threatened and
 may try to protect their 'turf.' Thus, we do not suggest that a sense of possession is always positive.
 Perhaps extremely high levels of psychological ownership for the organization are counter-productive.
 Future research should consider when psychological ownership leads to positive consequences and
 when the consequences are more likely to be negative. Shifting levels of analysis, research could also
 assess cross-level effects of social structure (e.g., group size, norms, role breadth, interdependence,
 and culture) on psychological ownership (Spreitzer, 1996).

 Given the early stages of research on psychological ownership for the organization, it would be pre-
 mature to make strong recommendations for practice. At the same time, consultants have emphasized
 benefits of psychological ownership for years (Brown, 1989; Peters, 1988). Thus, our results provide a
 preliminary foundation for discussing implications for managers. Since psychological ownership for the
 organization predicted variance in attitudes and discretionary behavior (beyond commitment and satis-
 faction), we are optimistic about implications for managers. If our results are replicated, managers may
 want to pay special attention to employee feelings of possession when employee attitudes (commit-
 ment, satisfaction, organization-based self-esteem), and discretionary behaviors (such as organizational
 citizenship) are critical to work effectiveness. For example, a sense of ownership may be especially
 important for service employees with direct customer contact and for supervisory employees with dis-
 cretionary responsibility for decision making. In these situations, managers may want to design work to
 allow employees the opportunity to exercise control, acquire knowledge, and personally invest in their
 work (Pendleton et al., 1998; Pierce et al., 1991), thus facilitating positive feelings of possession.

 It is also important to acknowledge managerial implications of the potentially negative effects of
 extreme cases of psychological ownership. This can occur in two different manners. First, as proposed
 by Dirks et al. (1996), extremely high psychological ownership can cause resistance to change and low
 cooperation ('stay out of my sandbox'). Perhaps managers should be especially mindful of psycholo-
 gical ownership during transitions and should stress overall shared ownership rather than individual
 feelings of possession for a particular job. Second, our research suggests that managers should be
 aware that low psychological ownership can reduce discretionary behavior. This may be particularly
 relevant for supervisory employees and service employees with direct customer contact and decision-
 making responsibility because low psychological ownership may have negative implications for qual-
 ity and customer satisfaction. In these situations, managers may need to intervene and transfer employ-
 ees to different jobs, redesign jobs to place less emphasis on discretionary behavior, or try to enhance
 employee feelings of control, knowledge, and personal investment in the work.

 In conclusion, although scholars, consultants, and practitioners have described the benefits of

 psychological ownership, this is the first study to demonstrate that psychological ownership for the
 organization differs from other constructs that represent work-related attitudes. In addition, the three
 field studies reported in this paper suggest that the unique emphasis of psychological ownership on
 possession increases our understanding of and ability to predict employee commitment, satisfaction,
 organization-based self-esteem, performance, and organizational citizenship behavior. Finally, results
 of this study provide additional evidence of the value of psychological ownership for the organization
 by demonstrating that psychological ownership predicts two forms of organizational citizenship
 (supervisor and peer perceptions), over and above the two most commonly researched predictors of
 citizenship (satisfaction and commitment).

 Thus, our research (which examines psychological ownership in three different samples of employ-
 ees in work organizations) begins to provide an empirical foundation for future research on psycho-
 logical ownership. Overall, results demonstrate that psychological ownership increased our ability to
 predict and understand organization-based self-esteem and organizational citizenship behavior in work
 organizations, beyond demographic characteristics, commitment, and satisfaction. Accordingly, we
 recommend that future research should continue to examine the unique contribution of psychological
 ownership for understanding employee attitudes and behavior.
