Environmental management has been researching extensively in the last two decades. Pressure from
environmental regulations or policies plays an important role to boost environmental management
practices. Nevertheless, the relationship between such pressure and the ultimate Ô¨Årm performance is not
very obvious. Although green product innovation has been recognized as a predictor to improve envir-
onment performance, there is a lack of discussion in the literature to examine the mediating effect of
green product innovation between the aforementioned pressure and Ô¨Årm performance. Additionally,
most previous studies adopted a static view which ignores the implications on external dynamic factors
in many empirical studies. In this connection, this study contributes to the Ô¨Åeld of knowledge by Ô¨Ålling
these two gaps. More speciÔ¨Åcally, this study: (i) examines the effect of green product innovation on the
relationship between pressure of environmental regulations (or policies) and Ô¨Årm performance; and
(ii) evaluates the moderating effect of environmental dynamism on the relationship between green
production innovation and Ô¨Årm performance. A questionnaire survey is conducted in an emerging
country, China, to verify the hypotheses.

Introduction

Undoubtedly, various managerial practices are used to improve
the performance of Ô¨Årms, such as that by better allocating their
resources (e.g. Tse et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). This ultimately
helps Ô¨Årms to generate proÔ¨Åts and gain competitive advantage in
the market. SpeciÔ¨Åcally to the operations management domain,
companies widely implement quality management strategies, like
total quality management, to enhance customer satisfaction that
in turn would contribute to the business performance (Jayaram
et al., 2010). Environmental management is one recent concern
that has received massive attention from both researchers and
practitioners. Environmental management is now a widely adop-
ted operations strategy (Gupta, 1995; Klassen and Whybark, 1999).
Although with an explicit focus on addressing environmental
concerns into implementing supply chain, surprisingly, only a

handful of studies can provide evidences that organizations may
generate business opportunities to outperform their competitors
(e.g. Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Zhu et al., 2008). Even cost efÔ¨Å-
ciency, which is the traditional focus of operations management,
has not been studied well in this regard (Porter van der Linde,
1995).

One main driver to the development of environmental man-
agement is the corresponding pressure from environmental reg-
ulations (Zhu et al., 2011; Tseng et al., 2013). Existing research
mainly focuses on retailers' perspective to understand environ-
mental issues by considering consumers' perception as the inde-
pendent variable of environmental issues (Lee et al., 2012). One
possible drawback of this approach is that the perception of con-
sumers is somehow so subjective and difÔ¨Åcult to measure exactly.
In practice, environmental issues are usually affected by various
factors, for instance, packaging and labels (Hyllegard et al., 2012).
Thus, we advocate taking the perspective of suppliers to investi-
gate environmental issues. Stated clearly, we argue that awareness
to environmental related regulations or policies takes a crucial role
to affect the integration of environmental issues into supply chains
in companies. This is because one important, underlying driver of
environmental management in organizations is the pressure from
external regulations (Zhu et al., 2011). However, it is believed that


H.K. Chan et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 181 (2016) 384‚Äì391

385

such pressure cannot lead to good performance directly. This is
explained below.

Researchers generally recognize that the success of integrating
environmental issues into organization cannot be achieved easily
if the concern of green innovation is not clearly addressed when
developing business process for companies (Chen et al., 2006;
Chen, 2008; Ziegler and Nogareda, 2009). Whether or not Ô¨Årms
can boost their performance through environmental management
would be a combination of many factors. Among them, the ability
to provide green product innovation and the awareness of, hence
pressure generated from, environmental regulations cannot be
separated. However, this relationship has not been investigated.
Therefore, it is worth studying the effect of green product inno-
vation on the relationship between the aforementioned pressure
and Ô¨Årm performance, which is the Ô¨Årst research question of
this work.

That being said, strictly static regulation and market may not
necessarily result in technical efÔ¨Åciency (van der Vlist et al.,
2007). As a matter of fact, the assumption that ‚Äúexternal envir-
onmental is very stable‚Äù can hardly be justiÔ¨Åable on majority of, if
not all, occasions. Like many operations management variables,
environmental regulations and technology are always subject to
change. In this connection, it is worth investigating the afore-
mentioned relationship between the pressure of environmental
regulations, green product innovation, and Ô¨Årm performance
when the external environment is uncertain. Above can be
explained through the lens of contingency theory because static
theories or best practices for operations strategy are no longer
effective (Sousa and Voss, 2008; Chavez et al., 2015). Environ-
mental dynamism can be regarded as external uncertainty and
can be deÔ¨Åned as the rate of change or unpredictability prevalent
in a Ô¨Årms' environment (Eroglu and Hofer, 2014). It is a possible
moderating variable by taking the contingency view. This will be
further explained in Section 2. In this connection, environmental
dynamism is expected to have different degrees of moderating
effect on the association between green innovations and Ô¨Årm
performance. This is the second research question to be answered
in this work.

To address the above-mentioned questions, this paper proposes
a research framework that sets out to investigate the following
research objectives:
 To examine the relationship among the pressure of environ-
innovation, and Ô¨Årm
 To investigate the moderating effect of environmental dyna-
mism on the relationship between green product innovation
and Ô¨Årm performance.

This paper therefore contributes to the environmental man-
agement research by understanding the relationship of the pres-
sure of environmental policies and Ô¨Årm performance via green
product innovation, and to study the moderating effect of envir-
onmental dynamism on the relationship between green product
innovation and Ô¨Årm performance. The rest of the paper is orga-
nized as follows: Section 2 reviews existing studies, and then
formulates the hypotheses accordingly. This is followed by Section
3 which outlines the research method and data collection. Section
4 presents the results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the Ô¨Åndings and
concludes this paper.

2. Literature review and hypotheses development

2.1. Pressure of environmental regulations/policies

Regulatory pressure is probably the key driver to push Ô¨Årms
towards sustainable development, especially if the target markets
include the member states of the European Union (De Brito et al.,
2008). The REACH Directive (European Union, 2003) is a typical
example that Ô¨Årms need to follow in order to control chemical
substances being used in a product. Aligning Ô¨Årms' activities to the
regulations would be a necessity. However, whether or not such
alignment will eventually affect the Ô¨Årms performance is unclear.
Firm performance is always a key concern of companies. However,
to date,
there is limited research investigating the relation
between the pressures from the environmental regulations and
business outcome. Empirical Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that environ-
mental regulations lead to improved environmental performance
(Kagan et al., 2003). But conversion of such environmental per-
formance to Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability, for example, may not be linear. For
example, King and Lenox (2001) also Ô¨Ånd that there is a rela-
tionship between the environmental performance and Ô¨Ånancial
gain, but which one is the cause or effect was unclear.

In China, environmental issues are notorious and hence the
country also started imposing environmental regulation since
1980s, initially set by the State Environmental Protection Agency
(SEPA), which is now rebranded as the Ministry of Environmental
Protection (MEP) (McGuire, 2014; Bai et al., 2015). This is a
reÔ¨Çection of the determination of the Chinese Government to
tackle environmental
issues. For example, MEP published the
Chinese version of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(WEEE) regulation in 2009 for the implementation in 2011 (Zhu
et al., 2013). Such regulations deÔ¨Ånitely have exposed Chinese
Ô¨Årms to great pressures, let alone the external pressures from
other countries which require the exported products to comply
with the respective regulations. In this connection, Bai et al. (2015)
review the state-of-the-art in corporate sustainability develop-
ment in China and the associated development of the regulatory
pressures, which support the views of the authors of this article.
Therefore, we argue that the pressure of environmental reg-
ulations or policies may not directly lead to better Ô¨Årm perfor-
mance. Hence, it is urged to gain more understanding on whether
or not Ô¨Årms can convert the environmental performance achieved
through the pressure of environmental regulations to Ô¨Årm per-
formance. For instance, Rao and Holt (2005) provide empirical
evidence that implementing green operations can enhance a
company's competitiveness and economic performance. Moreover,
there is a clear relationship between improvements in environ-
mental performance and compliance with environmental regula-
tions on a company's competitiveness (Bacallan, 2000). More
recently, Shu et al. (2014) claimed that government support
strongly mediates the effect on radical green product innovation
than its effect on incremental product innovation. Therefore, the
pressure of such environmental regulations, which will deÔ¨Ånitely
affect the implementation of environmental practices, should also
positively relate to the Ô¨Årm's performance. The next question is of
course, what other factor(s) may be able to facilitate such process.
In the next section, we will explore one such possible factor, which
is green product innovation.

2.2. Green product innovation and Ô¨Årm performance

Green product innovation takes the environmental factors (e.g.
material usage, energy consumption, etc.) into product design


386

H.K. Chan et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 181 (2016) 384‚Äì391

considerations for both new and (modiÔ¨Åcation of) existing pro-
ducts, with the prime objective to reduce the negative environ-
mental impacts over the products' life-cycle (Dangelico and Pujari,
2010, Chang, 2011). Guoyou et al. (2013) consider green innovation
as ‚Äúan instrument to improve Ô¨Årms' environmental management
process‚Äù, and is related to any changes, either technologically,
organizationally, societally, or institutionally, that result in a
reduction of environmental burdens. More speciÔ¨Åcally, green
product innovation has an impact on Ô¨Årms' competitive advantage
and theirs image (Chen et al., 2006; Chen, 2008; Wong, 2012). Lin
et al. (2013) also showed that green product innovation had a
positive effect on Ô¨Årm performance via an empirical study in the
automobile industry.

The ultimate objective of any business is to earn proÔ¨Åt and
survive in the marketplace. This can be accomplished by adding
value to the customers through the core business processes.
Incorporating environmental concerns into corporate operations
can be one of many ways to accomplish the objective (Hansmann
and Claudia 2001). This can also improve Ô¨Årms overall efÔ¨Åciency as
the traditional way to deÔ¨Åne efÔ¨Åciency does not take bad outputs
into consider, and, as a consequence, can include increasing
environmental performance and reduce cost (Rao, 2002). Vachon
and Klassen (2008) veriÔ¨Åed such relationship for North American
organizations through an empirical study. This in line with Porter
and van der Linde's (1995) assertion that environmental man-
agement practices can help Ô¨Årms to introduce innovations in order
to offset the cost of implementing the practices. Consequently,
forms can be more competitive in the market via the environ-
mental management practices.

Curwen et al. (2013) offer a potential solution approach to relief
consumers' environmental concern by claiming that ‚Äúexamination
of the connections between design process and the supply chain is
imperative for advancing sustainable practices in the apparel and
textile industry‚Äù. Grounded in their claim, we propose a research
model which links green product innovation to Ô¨Årm performance
in terms of operations efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability. Green
product innovation plays an important role to inÔ¨Çuence consumer
behavior and hence Ô¨Årms performance (Lee et al., 2012; Lin et al.,
2013). Chen and Burns (2006) presented a relevant case study to
support this assertion. They advocated that ‚Äúsolutions cannot be
achieved without action by the government, industry, and the
consumers‚Äù. This brings out another issue which is the pressure of
environmental regulations or policies in our proposed model.
Green product innovation should link to the pressure of environ-
mental
regulations or policies directly. Such pressure is
inevitable (otherwise they are not called regulations or policies) so
green product innovation is a direct consequence of it. The pres-
sure itself cannot lead to good environmental performance, but
green product innovation is a proper medium to convert such
pressures to improve environmental performance and hence
possibly Ô¨Årm performance. This can also be explained by the
contingency theory and further discussion can be found at the end
of next sub-section.

A recent empirical study in China revealed that customer and
regulatory pressures could promote organization responses which
then could improve green innovation, albeit unspeciÔ¨Åc to green
product innovation (Huang et al., in press). This Ô¨Ånding coupled
with the above discussion in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, we Ô¨Årst
hypothesize that pressure of environmental regulations/policies
would affect green product innovation, which then affect Ô¨Årm
performance. This is represented by the Ô¨Årst two hypotheses:

H1: Pressure of environmental regulations/policies is positively

associated with green product innovation.

H2: Green product innovation is positively associated with (a) cost

efÔ¨Åciency and (b) Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability.

2.3. Environmental dynamism

Environmental problems of many manufacturing supply chains,
which typically include a number of early manufacturing activities
outsourced to emerging counties like China, are also difÔ¨Åcult to
tackle due to its complexity, let alone the dynamics of a real
business (Chan et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the effects cannot be
underestimated (J√∏rgensen et al., 2010). To better capture the
dynamics of the business, contextual factors, such as market
dynamism, play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in environment management
and business performance. A lack of such factors is believed to be a
key success to explain why environmental policies have not
achieved their objectives successfully (Revell and Rutherfoord,
2003). Market dynamism exerts an external impact on Ô¨Årms due
to various changes induced by different sources, such as technol-
ogy innovation, customer expectation, and product demand.

The impact of the external environment on innovation and
performance has been examined extensively (e.g., Matusik and
Hill, 1998; Jansen et al., 2006). Environmental dynamism is con-
cerned with the extent to which external environment are char-
acterized by ‚Äúchange in technologies, variations in customer pre-
ferences, and Ô¨Çuctuations in product demand or supply of mate-
rials‚Äù (Jansen et al., 2006). It refers to the rate of change and the
degree of instability of environment (Dess and Beard, 1984; Aza-
degan et al., 2013; Eroglu and Hofer, 2014). Under a dynamic
environment with frequent and rapid changes induced by tech-
nology, customers, and suppliers, existing products and processes
are easy to become obsolete. As such, the dynamic environment
provides a drive for the improvement of the existing and processes
or the development of new products and processes. An empirical
study concluded that environmental dynamism is a driver in China
that affects competitive advantage signiÔ¨Åcantly (Li and Liu, 2014).
Accordingly, Ô¨Årms pursuing green product innovation are more
likely to capture changing circumstances by improving the exist-
ing and processes or developing new products and processes.
Hence, we expect that environmental dynamism would have a
moderating effect on green product
innovation and Ô¨Årm
performance.

Above assumption can be explained through the lens of con-
tingency theory. The theory involves three types of variables
(Sousa and Voss, 2008): Contextual variables, response variables,
and performance variables. Contextual variables refer to the exo-
genous situational characteristics which can inÔ¨Çuence the orga-
nizations of concern. Environmental dynamism is an example of
such contextual variables, and a classic example is uncertainty in
market demand (Eroglu and Hofer, 2014). For example, if market
demand has a positive relationship with environmental perfor-
mance (e.g. Lin et al., 2013), Ô¨Çuctuations of demand would deÔ¨Å-
nitely inÔ¨Çuence the performance and hence the effectiveness of
green product innovation. Therefore, it is unreasonable to assume
that the external environment is static. For instance, Azadegan
et al. (2013) studied the moderation effect of environmental
dynamism on lean operations practice performance. However, this
is the Ô¨Årst study to examine the moderation effect of environ-
mental dynamism on the relationship between green product
innovation and Ô¨Årm performance.
In this study, not only the
environmental dynamism is modeled as a contextual factors, the
pressures of environmental regulations/policies is in fact another
type of contextual factor which is subject to change over time, and
is primarily an exogenous factor.

In addition to the contextual factors, green product innovation
is the response variable in the contingency theory paradigm,
which is the actions taken by the organizations in response to the
contextual factors (i.e. the pressure of environmental regulations /
policies and environmental dynamism in this study). The last piece
the puzzle is the performance variables which are the
of

independent variables that measure the effectiveness of the
response variables (i.e. the actions) subject to the contextual
variables. They are represented by Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability and cost efÔ¨Å-
ciency in the proposed research model in this study. Therefore,
environmental dynamism is expected to moderate the relation-
ship between green product innovation and Ô¨Årm performance, i.e.
H2a an H2b mentioned in previous section. Therefore, the last
hypothesis is as follows:

H3: Environmental dynamism moderates the effect of green pro-

duct innovation on (a) cost efÔ¨Åciency and (b) Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability.

To conclude, the proposed research model is depicted in Fig. 1.
Next section will present the details of the research design and
research instrument to verify above hypotheses.

3. Research methodology

3.1. Survey development and measurements

A self-administrated questionnaire was developed as the
research instrument to examine the hypotheses. As depicted in
Appendix A, all questionnaire items were based on a 7-point Likert
scales, from 1 (strongly disagress) to 7 (strongly agree). All mea-
sures in our study were adapted from the extant literature as
shown in Appendix A. Adaptation is required mainly because the
questionnaire survey was conducted with Chinese respondents.
Therefore, some words and even sentence structures are changed
to improve understanding.
In addition, back-translation was
employed between English and Chinese by bilingual Chinese
researchers to ensure conceptual equivalence (Cai et al., 2010). The
questionnaire was then reviewed by three academics in this Ô¨Åeld
and further adjustment in use of words was implemented. The
revised questionnaire was pilot-tested with a small group of post-
doctoral researchers to ensure that the indicators were under-
standable and relevant to practices in China (Hensley, 1999). The
wordings in some of the questions are further adjusted based on
the feedback from the pilot test.

3.2. Data collection and sample

Due to the nature of this research, the target frame of the
survey is operations managers or equivalent from the industry
operating in China. Samples cover a variety of industries (such as
automotive industry, electrical and electronic industry, chemical
industry, manufacturing industry,
textile industry, and toys
industry, etc.) in order to improve the generalizability of this work
and the proposed model. In short, the units of analysis were set as
individual Ô¨Årms whereas the units of data collection were man-
agers. The survey was conducted online and took place from April

returned from the online survey.

4. Analysis and results

We now examine the reliability and validity of our constructs.
We adopted the two-step approach prosed by Gerbing and
Anderson's (1988). The Ô¨Årst step is to examine the measurement
model, which includes convergent validity and discriminant
validity. The objective is to assure that the measures used in the
analysis are reliable and valid. This is followed by the structural
model to analyze the data. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics
on each variable and the correlations among constructs.

4.1. Measurement instrument validation

Convergent validity exists if a group of indicators are measuring
one common factor. Composite reliability and average variance
extracted were calculated using the procedures suggested by
Fornell and Larcker (1981). Composite reliability (CR) for each
construct is at least 0.813, and average variance extracted is at
least 0.524. Cronbach's alpha values of all factors are well above
0.70. Table 2 provides all of these values and suggests sufÔ¨Åcient
convergent validity.

Discriminant validity among the constructs can be tested by
comparing the average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct
with the square of the correlation between all possible pairs of
constructs (Hair et al., 2010). Table 3 shows that all the AVE values
(in bold) fulÔ¨Åll this as they are all greater than the square of the
correlation between all possible pairs of constructs.

Additionally, the overall measurement model provides a good
to the data (œá2¬º473.029, Dof¬º242, p¬º0.00, CFI¬º0.948,
Ô¨Åt
TLI¬º0.941, and RMSEA¬º0.062). Overall, the results offer support
for discriminant validity among the constructs.

A number of steps were followed to investigate the moderating
role of the environmental dynamism in the GPI‚ÄìCE relationship.
First, we examined the interaction between GPI and environ-
mental dynamism. In order to reduce the threat of multi-colli-
nearity, the two variables were Ô¨Årst centered (Aiken and West,
1991). Next, CE was

GPI  dynamism. The interaction term was signiÔ¨Åcant (Œ≤¬º.119,
p¬º.007) and multi-colinearity (VIF¬º1.061) was not a problem, so
environmental dynamism moderates the relationship between
green product innovation and cost efÔ¨Åciency. As such, Hypothesis
3a was conÔ¨Årmed. Results indicate that the positive relationship
between green product innovation and cost efÔ¨Åciency is stronger
in environments characterized by high dynamism.

regressed on dynamism, GPI

A similar procedure was employed to examine the moderating
role of the environmental dynamism in the GPI‚ÄìFP relationship.
First, we investigated the interaction between GPI and environ-
mental dynamism. FP was regressed on dynamism, GPI and
GPI  dynamism. The interaction term was marginally signiÔ¨Åcant
(Œ≤¬º.076, p¬º.092), providing marginal support for Hypothesis 3b.

5. Discussions

Our main effects (hypotheses H1, H2 (a), and (b)) results pro-
vide the empirical evidence to support Porter and van der Linde
(1995) proposition that environmental pressure enables Ô¨Årms to
develop green innovations and that the beneÔ¨Åts derived from
these innovations may offset the cost of implementing environ-
mental management and enable the Ô¨Årm to act more competi-
tively (hypotheses H1, H2(a) and H2(b)). Moreover, in our study,
we distinguished two measurements of Ô¨Årm performance ‚Äì cost
efÔ¨Åciency and proÔ¨Åtability. These two measurements can repre-
sent different major focuses of organizations, some Ô¨Årms are cost-
oriented, and others are pursuing premium prices. Our study
suggest that green product innovation could bring Ô¨Årms not only
cost efÔ¨Åciency but also proÔ¨Åtability, thus for Ô¨Årms with either
orientation, green product innovation development is a key cap-
ability for competiveness.

While green product innovation is generally recognized as the
key to environmental development, the empirical Ô¨Åndings mainly
show that green product innovation is a predictor for environ-
mental performance (e.g., Rao, 2002; Vachon and Klassen, 2008).
However, this research clearly demonstrates that green product
innovation is a mediator after pressure of environmental regula-
tions is introduced. Speaking clearly, pressure of environmental

4.2. Common method bias

We performed Harman's single factor test

(œá2¬º1734.213,
Df¬º252, p¬º0.00, CFI¬º0.665, TLI¬º0.634 and RMSEA¬º0.153). Our
Harmon's single factor test results are considerably worse than
those of the measurement model (œá2¬º473.029, Dof¬º242, p¬º0.00,
CFI¬º0.948, TLI¬º0.941, and RMSEA¬º0.062). As suggested by Lin-
dell and Whitney (2001), we also employ the lowest bi-variate
correlation among the manifest variables as the marker variable to
check for the impact of method variance. The adjusted correlation
matrix was computed and was tested with the signiÔ¨Åcance of the
adjusted correlations. It was found that after adjustment, all cor-
relations remain signiÔ¨Åcant. Based on the above reliability and
validity tests, we are conÔ¨Ådent to conclude that common method
bias does not exist in this study.

4.3. Hypothesis testing

4.3.1. Main effects results

We Ô¨Årst established a structural equation model to test each
hypothesis, namely, H1, and H2a, and H2b. According to the results
summarized in Table 4, the overall Ô¨Åt of this structural model is
acceptable, with the CFI and TLI well above the recommended

regulations impacts positively green product innovation that in
turn affects cost efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability. This reveals that
aligning Ô¨Årm‚Äôs activities to cope with the pressure of the envir-
onmental regulations is necessary. In doing so, a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs ability of
developing green product innovation and Ô¨Årm‚Äôs business perfor-
mance will be increased. This research extends this body of lit-
erature on environmental management by empirically showing
that the mediating effect of green product innovation on the
relationship between pressure of environmental regulations and
operational performance or business performance.

That being said, it is the Government who initiates and controls
those environment regulations or policies. In other words, the
pressures generated by such regulations or policies were actually
originated from the policy makers. The presence of the mediating
factor (the green product innovation) between such pressures and
Ô¨Årm performance clearly implies that policy makers should take
the capability of the industry in terms of green product innovation
into consideration. For example,
limiting carbon emissions by
setting up a regulation and cap it at any level is easy, whether or
not the industry can respond to this regulation and then achieve
good technical efÔ¨Åciency is another issue. The traditional way of
calculating efÔ¨Åciency does not take bad outputs (i.e. carbon
emissions in the example) into consideration. Therefore, once
these bad outputs become part of the equation, the overall efÔ¨Å-
ciency is deÔ¨Ånitely reduced as more resources are expected to put
in place to lower the bad outputs while maintaining the same level
of good outputs. In other words, the inputs would need to be
increased which lower the efÔ¨Åciency of the system from tradi-
tional deÔ¨Ånition. That‚Äôs also the reason why green product inno-
vation is the mediating factor because such innovation can bring
the level of bad outputs lower with less extra input resources. At
least the reduction in efÔ¨Åciency could be controlled at a lower
level. Therefore, the results of this research are also beneÔ¨Åcial to
policy makers and the advice to them is that setting up environ-
mental regulations without considering the practical implications
would only blindly shift the responsibility to the manufacturers
and in a long run, many companies who are unable to innovate in
this aspect will not be able to survive. This in fact will affect the
economy of the whole country in a long run.

This study also contributes to the literature on environmental
management by investigating moderating effects. The Ô¨Åndings of
this study indicate that environmental dynamism moderates the
relationship between green product innovation and cost efÔ¨Åciency
and between green product innovation and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability (i.e.
hypotheses 3(a) and 3(b)); the former is stronger. So far, there is
limited research examining moderating factors in the environ-
mental context. Perhaps, this may be due to the complexity of
environmental problems (Chan et al., 2012). But, it is still sug-
gested that the impact of environmental problems cannot be
underestimated (J√∏rgensen et al., 2010). In this study, we provide
empirical evidence to support environment dynamism is an
important contingency factor for the relationship between green
innovation and Ô¨Årm performance. Firms pursuing green product
innovation can better improve their performance in terms of cost
efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability under a dynamic circumstance. To
describe the performance improvement
the
improvement is found to be more for cost efÔ¨Åciency than for Ô¨Årm
proÔ¨Åtability. This empirical Ô¨Ånding suggests that under high
dynamic business environment, Ô¨Årms could more likely to achieve
cost efÔ¨Åciency rather than proÔ¨Åtability. Although it might be
because cost efÔ¨Åciency is easier to measure a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs operations
while a Ô¨Årm's proÔ¨Åtability is often affected by many factors, it still
suggests managers could put more efforts on the cost-saving-
oriented environment activities under higher environment
dynamism.

in the country rather

If we look at this from another angle, the moderating effect
implies that the effect of green innovation is more sensitive to
dynamic environment, which directly related to the introduction
of new technology or materials (i.e. more frequently changing of
the modes of production or the rate of innovation). From this
perspective, the Government may consider spending resources on
the technological
than
spending resources on sorely setting up regulations and studying
the impact of environmental issues. Take carbon emissions again,
we all know that we should limit the level of emissions, but
spending effort only to deÔ¨Åne the limit will not be constructive to
efÔ¨Åciency. Resource should also be spent on the technological
improvement and to promote green product innovation (in fact
they are directly related to each other). In this case, all companies
can be beneÔ¨Åcial from it and the carbon emissions will be reduced
accordingly to a level that is governed by the technological cap-
ability. Just to clarify that it is not the intention of the authors to
suggest lifting the regulations or policies completely, which is still
an important driver to green product innovation. Please see below.
The results on the impact of pressure of environmental reg-
ulations on green product innovation imply that understand
environmental
In practice,
manufacturing companies with a goal of providing green innova-
tive products are suggested to align their Ô¨Årms' activities to the
environmental regulations. Further, the Ô¨Åndings of the moderating
effect of environmental dynamism on the relationship among
green product innovation and cost efÔ¨Åciency or Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability
imply that under a dynamic environment that is characterized by
frequent and rapid changes induced by technology, customers, and
suppliers, manufacturing companies may consider such kind of
changes when designing and/or manufacturing green innovative
product for the reason that such changes can enhance a Ô¨Årm‚Äôs
ability to achieve higher cost efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability.

issues is necessary and important.

6. Conclusion

The objectives of this research are: (1) to examine the rela-
tionship among the pressure of environmental regulations, green
product innovation, and Ô¨Årm performance and (2) to investigate
the moderating effect of environmental dynamism on the rela-
tionship between green product innovation and Ô¨Årm performance.
In accordance with these objectives, a research model was devel-
oped to test the relationship among pressure of environmental
regulations, green product innovation, cost efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm
performance and the moderating effect of environmental dyna-
mism on the hypothesized relationships. The model was tested
using the collected samples from 250 companies in the Mainland
China and employing structural equation modeling. The test
results of this study show that pressure of environmental regula-
tions has a positive impact on green product innovation, which in
turn inÔ¨Çuences cost efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability. The Ô¨Åndings
of this research also show that environmental dynamism has a
relatively strong moderation effect on the relationship among
green product innovation and cost efÔ¨Åciency and moderates
marginally the relationship among green product innovation and
Ô¨Årm proÔ¨Åtability. The results provide useful insights to research
and practice for environment management.

There are two key limitations in this research. First, this
research considers pressure of environmental regulations as the
predictor of green product innovation in sampled manufacturing
companies. There are other possible predictors that may affect
green product innovation. For instance,
institutional pressures
may have inÔ¨Çuence on green product innovation. Therefore, future
research may identify various kinds of institutional or external
pressure and investigate their inÔ¨Çuence on green innovation.

Second, this research only considers environmental dynamism as
the moderator for investigation. Further research may identify
other moderators relevant to the studied context, like top man-
agement championship for environmental management, and
examine their moderating effects on the relationship among
innovation and performance. Based on the above, future research
is, drawing upon organizational value and institutional theory, to
investigate how institutional pressures (such as Coercive Pres-
sures) motivate companies to adopt proactive environmental
management strategy and how such effects are moderated by

organizational value (such as Organizational Culture, Organiza-
tional Learning).
