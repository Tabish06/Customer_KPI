Abstract 
In  this  paper  we  examine  the  efficiency  and  its  determinants  in  the  banking 
systems of Central and Eastern European countries during a four-year period from 2004 
to  2008.  We  use  two  approaches  in  order  to  examine  the  efficiency  of  the  banking 
industry: SFA method and DEA method. 

From empirical results we see that the average efficiency of banks in Central and 
Eastern  European  countries  grew  in  the  period  analyzed.  Increase  may  be  due  to 
increased competition with EU accession and the entry of foreign banks, also caused by 
extensive  legislative  changes  which  led  banks  to  become  more  efficient.  Based  on  the 
results  we  see  that  the  highest  level  of  technical  efficiency  are  recorded  in  banking 
systems  from  Romania  and  Czech  Republic,  and  the  lowest  are  recorded  in  Slovenia. 
Looking  at  the  average  efficiency  scores  for  each  country,  we  observe  significant 
variation  across  the  banking  systems  of  the  Central  and  East  European  country. 
Technical  efficiency  values  estimates  with  SFA  method  range  from  0,6275  in  Slovak 
Republic to 0,8644 in Romania. 

In  order  to  assess  the  level  of  productivity  growth  of  the  banking  industry,  we 
calculate Malmquist productivity index, calculated using the linear programming. In the 
analyzed  period,  on  average,  the  productivity  of  banks  increased  in  2008  by 
approximately 24,27 % in relation to 2004, an increase owed especially to technological 
modification.

1. Introduction 

The efficiency of banks has been widely and extensively studied in the last few 
decades.  For  banks,  efficiency  implies  improved  profitability,  greater  amount  of  funds 
channeled in, better prices and services quality for consumers and greater safety in terms 
of improved capital buffer in absorbing risk (Berger, Hunter and Timme, 1993). 

The  information  obtained  on  the  evaluation  of  the  bank's  performance  may  be 
used to improve its overall efficiency of operations and in turn, may contribute towards 
achieving its competitive edge. 

The creation of an effective and solid financial system constituted an important 
objective of the process of reform and passing from a centralized economy to a market 
economy  in  Central  and  Eastern  European  countries.  The  liberalization  of  prices,  the 
liberalization  of  the  circulation  of  goods,  services  and  of  capital,  the  deregulation  of 
financial systems, globalization and the mutations on the level of the economic, social 
and  political  environment  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  development  of  the  CEE 
banking  system.  The  banking  systems  in  the  developing  countries  suffered  ample 
mutations with the purpose of creating some efficient banking institutions and with a high 
degree of soundness capable of facilitating economic growth. 

The efficiency of the banking system is a theme of interest both for the academic 
world, as well as for the decision factors around the world. During last three decades a 
large number of papers has been published in which the efficiency of banking industry 
both  in  the  developed  and  developing  countries  has  been  investigated.  Generally  in 
papers  concerning  developed  the  attention  has  been  focused  on  analyzing  the  market 
structure, the degree of concentration, and deregulation and their impacts on efficiency. 
On other hand, in case of developing countries the concentration has generally been on 
investigation of the impact of the bank reforms, of the privatizations of the state banks, of 
entering foreign banks and their effects on the efficiency (Asaftei and Kumbhakar, 2008; 
Bauer et al., 1998; Bauer, Berger and Humphrey, 1993; Beccalli, Casu and Girardone, 
2006; Berger and Humphrey, 1997, Berger and Mester, 1997; Berger and Mester, 2003; 
Bonin,  Hassan  and  Wachtel,  2005;  Casu  and  Girardone,  2002;  Casu,  Girardone  and

Molyneux,  2004;  Guzmán  and  Reverte,  2008;  Koutsomanoli-Filippaki,  Margaritis  and 
Staikouras, 2009; Yildirim and Philippatos, 2007).  

The increasing number of studies pertaining to the analysis of performance and 
efficiency of banks is a result of the transformations in the financial services sector and 
unprecedented  advancement  in  financial  and  non-financial  technologies  (Berger  and 
Mester, 2003). The valuation of the productivity of the banking system presents a major 
interest  for  the  public  authorities  because  an  increase  of  the  productivity  of  banks  can 
lead to better banking performances, the decrease of costs and improvement of the quality 
of services, as well as to an improvement of the allocation of resources and increase of 
productivity on the level of the entire economy. The increase of productivity contributes, 
also, to the increase of the soundness and stability of the banking system provided that 
the achieved profits are channeled towards the increase of equity and of provisions that 
allow for a better absorption of risks (Casu et al., 2004).  

The analysis of the efficiency and productivity of banks can be performed with 
both the help of the parametrical methods and that of non-parametrical methods. For a 
comparison  of  these  methods  see  Berger  and  Humphrey  (1997),  Berger  and  Mester 
(2003) and Casu et al. (2004). 

In the literature in the field there are a considerable number of studies regarding 
the  efficiency  of  banks,  most  of  these  studies  refer  to  the  banking  systems  in  the 
developed countries especially the USA and the European Union.  

In  this  paper  we  pursue:  the  analysis  of  efficiency,  determining  the  factors  that 
influence  the  level  of  efficiency  and  the  analysis  of  the  mutations  on  the  level  of  the 
productivity  of  banks  in  7  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  countries  (Bulgaria,  Czech 
Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Hungary) for the period 2004-
2008.  

On contrary to many other regions, the examination of efficiency and productivity 
- banking industry in Central and Eastern Europe countries, has receive little attention . 
Most studies focused on the banking sector in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are only 
performed at the level of one state and do not offer comparative information regarding 
the efficiency of banks in these states. However, in recent years, several papers have been 
published on comparative analysis highlighting the impact of the property ownership on

banks’ efficiency and productivity (Fries and Taci, 2001; Grigorian and Manole, 2002; 
Weill, 2003, Hasan and Marton, 2003; Bonin, Hasan and Wachtel, 2005; Fries and Taci, 
2005;  Rossi  et  al.,  2005;  Havrylchyk,  2006;  Yildirim  and  Philippatos,  2007; 
Koutsomanoli-Filippaki et al., 2009). 

The  analysis  of  the  mutations  on  the  level  of  the  productivity  of  banks  is 
performed, in the literature in the field, with the help of the total productivity index of the 
Malmquist  factors  (see  Alam,  2001,  Berg  et  al.,  1992;  Chaffai,  Dietsch  and  Lozano-
Vivas,  2001;  Grifell-Tatje  and  Lovell,  1997;  Guzman  and  Reverte.  2008,  Isik  and 
Hassan,  2003;  Liu,  2010;  Rebelo  and  Mendes,  2000;  Wheelock  and  Wilson,  1999)  or 
through the parametric estimation of the distance function (Cuesta and Orea; 2002; Feng 
and Serletis, 2010; Koutsomanoli-Filippaki et al., 2009; Rezitis; 2008). 

We analyze the efficiency of banks in CEE through two methods: a parametric 
method – the SFA Method (Stochastic Frontier Analysis) and a non-parametric method – 
the  DEA  Method  (Data  Envelopment  Analysis).  The  use  of  two  different  methods  is 
justified because: although in a great many research regarding efficiency and productivity 
the hierarchy of methods was tried, until now no consensus was reached regarding which 
method should be used (Bauer et al., 1998); the use of different methods to analyze an 
economic phenomenon is a cross verification procedure for the robustness of the obtained 
results  (Learmer  and  Leonard,  1983);  considering  that  the  real  level  of  efficiency  of  a 
financial institution is not known and that the opportunity of using a certain method is 
given  by  the  distribution  of  the  set  of  data,  the  use  of  both  methods  will  reduce  the 
potential  error  caused  by  the  distribution  hypothesis  of  the  data  set  (Berger  and 
Humphrey, 1997). 

The two methods used present both comparative advantages and disadvantages. 
The DEA Method is a deterministic method based on linear programming which does not 
take into account the random errors and thus requires no predefinition of the distribution 
of  the  error  term.  While  the  SFA  Method  is  a  stochastic  method,  which  integrates  the 
random errors but also requires the predefinition of the functional form. In the case of the 
SFA method the output of a firm is a function of inputs, inefficiency and random error 
and requires the predefinition of the distribution of the error term. The DEA method does 
not take into account the “statistical noise”, and such the estimates regarding efficiency 

 

4 


can  be  biased  if  the  production  process  of  the  firm  is  characterized  by  stochastic 
elements. 

Because of its deterministic character, the DEA method entails as hypothesis that 
all  deviations  from  efficiency  are  caused  by  the  firm.  Nevertheless,  there  are  some 
elements  such  as  the  legislative  frame,  the  level  of  competition  etc.  that  cannot  be 
controlled  by  the  company  and  that  affect  the  performance  of  the  company.  On  the 
contrary,  the  SFA  method  allows  for  the  shaping  of  these  factors  by  introducing  the 
random  error  in  the  specification  of  the  model  for  the  determination  of  the  efficiency 
frontier (Murillo-Zamorano, 2004). 

The analysis of the mutations on the level of productivity will be performed with 
the  help  of  the  Malmquist  productivity  index  calculated  with  the  help  of  linear 
programming. The approach of productivity with the help of the Malmquist productivity 
index allows for the separation of the effect of the modification of efficiency – mutations 
on  the  level  of  the  technical  efficiency  of  banks  –  from  the  effects  owed  to  the 
technological modification – mutations on the level of the efficiency frontier owed to the 
technological progress. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  section  2  is  allocated  to  the 
description of the methodology used; in section 3 we present the variables and data used; 
section  4  is  meant  for  the  presentation  of  the  empirical  results;  the  conclusions  are 
presented in section 5.  
2. The methodology of research 

In  the  analysis  of  the  efficiency  of  the  banks  in  CEE  countries  we  will  use  two 
methods: a parametric method – the SFA Method (Stochastic Frontier Analysis) and a 
non-parametric method – the DEA Method (Data Envelopment Analysis).  

The DEA Method (Data Envelopment Analysis) is a non-parametric method of linear 
programming  used  to  create  the  efficiency  frontier  and  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  of  a 
decisions  unit.  The  DEA  method  provides  for  the  ensemble  of  analyzed  units  the 
efficiency  frontier,  according  to  which,  each  decision  unit  in  the  set  of  data  used  is 
evaluated in relation to this frontier and a relative efficiency is associated to it relative to 
the units with the “best” performances. These units with the “best” performances that are 

 

5 


on  the  efficiency  frontier  are  considered  to  be  efficient,  and  the  others  are  considered 
inefficient and an inefficiency score is associated to them. 

The decisional units found being inefficient are inefficient in that at least one other 
decisional unit can produce the same quantity of outputs with a lower quantity of inputs 
or a higher quantity of outputs with the same quantity of inputs. The level of efficiency of 
the  any  decisional  unit  cannot  be  higher  than  1.  The  DEA  method  is  designed  to 
maximize the relative efficiency of each decisional unit, provided that the ratios obtained 
in this way for each decisional unit are also feasible for all other decisional units in the 
data set. In this way both the reference points – the relatively efficient functional units – 
that define the efficiency frontier as well as the inner points – relatively inefficiency units 
– that are beneath the efficiency frontier are identified. If a functional unit is inefficient, 
the DEA method suggests the necessary strategies in order to increase the efficiency of 
this unit, referring to the selected units as being the best practices. Depending on these 
data, managers can evaluate to what extent a less efficient unit under-uses or over-uses 
certain inputs and what is to be done in order to improve the situation.  

In the literature in the field a lot of versions were developed, in the present paper 
we  will  apply  the  model  proposed  by  Banker,  Charnes  and  Cooper  (1984),  a  model 
oriented towards outputs and which had the hypothesis of variable returns to scale. This 
model  is  also  met  in  the  literature  in  the  field  as  the  VRS  model  (Variable  Returns  to 
Scale). 

The DEA models can be “input oriented models” or “output oriented models”. In the 
case of input oriented models, the DEA Method defines the efficiency frontier, searching 
for  each  analyzed  decisional  unit  the  maximum  decrease  in  the  use  of  inputs  so  as  to 
maintain the level of outputs constant. In the case of output oriented models the levels of 
the inputs are maintained constant and the possible maximum for outputs is sought. In 
case  the  productive  process  is  characterized  by  a  direct  proportionality  connection 
between  the  size  of  the  inputs  and  the  size  of  the  outputs,  the  two  measurements  of 
efficiency  produce  the  same  efficiency  scores.  Otherwise  the  two  approaches  lead  to 
different efficiency scores. 

The use of the specifications of constant returns to scale is only appropriate when all 
decisional  units  in  the  data  set  are  operational  at  the  optimum  scale.  The  imperfect 

 

6 


competition, the constraints regarding financing, the restrictions regarding the adequacy 
of capital, the prudential requirements etc. can make that some units do not operate on 
optimum  scale.  The  fact  that  banks  are  confronted  with  constant  returns  to  scale  was 
empirically proven in several studies (McAllister and McManus, 1993 and Wheelock and 
Wilson, 1999). The use of the constant returns to scale specifications in this case leads to 
measures of the technical efficiency mistaken with the returns to scale. That is why, the 
use of the hypothesis of variable returns to scale is imposed. 

The model developed by Banker, Charnes and Cooper (1984) can be written as: 

 

(1) 

The level of efficiency obtained by applying the BCC model is also called pure 
technical efficiency and is obtained by running program (1) for all decisional units. The 
BCC model eliminates from the analysis the scale component of efficiency and, thus, the 
level  of  efficiency  obtained  through  the  BCC  model  is  lower  or  equal  to  the  level  of 
efficiency resulted from applying the CCR model. 

In order to obtain the measures of efficiency to scale both DEA models must be 
solved. The technical efficiency scores obtained from the CRR model are decomposed 
into two components: one owed to the inefficiencies to scale and the other owed to pure 
technical inefficiency. If there are differences between scores for the same DMU in the 
two models, then the difference between them provides the measure for inefficiency to 
scale: 

where: 

 - technical efficiency in the BCC model; 

, 

 - technical efficiency in the CRR model; 

 - efficiency to scale.

The  SFA  Method  (Stochastic  Frontier  Analysis)  is  an  econometrical,  deterministic 
method for estimating the efficiency frontier. Unlike the non-parametric methods based 
on the technique of linear programming, the SFA method entails a certain functional form 
for  the  relation  between  inputs  and  outputs.  The  SFA  method  was  first  proposed  by 
Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977).  

The deterministic production frontier is given by the relation: 

where: 

  (2) 

 

Transposed into log-linear form, the deterministic production frontier becomes: 

or 

where: 

 

(3) 

 

(4) 

. 

A major problem of the deterministic method is the fact that it does not allow for the 
decomposing  of  the  error  term  and  the  separate  analysis  of  inefficiency  from  the 
stochastic shock. 

The SFA method entails as expression form of the production frontier; 

  (5) 

where: 

 –  production  function; 

 –  technical  inefficiency  component; 

random  error  component  (statistical  „noise”); 

 –input  elasticity; 

 –  inputs; 

 – 

 – 

outputs. 
The 

 variable  reflects  the  effects  of  the  conditions  independent  of  the  analyzed 

decisional unit and the measuring errors and it presupposes that, in general, it follows a 
 is a variable manageable 
normal distribution. The second component of the error term 

by the decisional unit, which represents inefficiency and presupposes that a semi-normal 
distribution follows. 

According to Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) the production function for a panel-

type set of data can be written thus: 

 

8 


 

 

(6) 

Kumbhakar  (1987)  and  Battese  and  Coelli  (1988)  generalized  the  hypothesis 
 and proposed for the panel-type set of data 

concerning the semi-normal distribution of 

a normal truncated distribution. The general form for the production form of a series of 
panel-type set of data can be written as: 

 

(7) 

where: 

 –output  vector; 

 –input  vector; 

 –  independent  variable  coefficient; 

 – random error 

; 

 – truncated error variable. 

The  production  frontier  (7)  can  be  estimated  through  Maximum  Likelihood 
Estimation  (MLE).  The  resulting  error  component  is  decomposed  into  the  „noise” 
component and the stochastic inefficiency component that is used in estimating the level 
of inefficiency for each decisional unit. For the estimation of the efficiency frontier in the 
case of panel-type data series aside from the Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML) the 
LSDV  approach  (least  square  dummy  variable  method)  and  the  GLS  approach 
(generalized least squares method) can also be used. 

A disadvantage of the models presented above is the fact that they presuppose that 
inefficiency  is  stable  in  time,  this  presupposition  being  difficult  to  accept  when  the 
number of analyzed periods is high enough. In time, it is to expect that managers learn 
from  past  experience  in  the  production  process  and  modify  their  decisions  so  that  the 
effects of inefficiency change their characteristics in time. 

Cornwell,  Schmidt  and  Sickles  (1990)  proposed  a  model  in  which  the  effects  of 

technical inefficiency are specific to each company and vary in time thus: 

 

 

8) 

The  obtained  model  can  be  treated  either  as  a  fixed  effects  model,  or  as  one  with 
random  effects  and  it  relaxes  the  invariance  hypothesis  of  the  effects  of  inefficiency. 
Kumbhakar  (1990)  suggested  the  use  of  a  model  in  which  the  effects  of  technical 
inefficiency vary systematically in time, according to the relation: 

 

(9) 

 

9 


where 

 are distributed semi-normal, and b and c are the parameters that have to be 

estimated using the MLE method. 

Battese and Coelli (1992) proposed an alternative model to the model developed by 
Kumbhakar (1990) in which the parameters of the model are estimated with the method 
of maximum likelihood and in which the terms vary exponentially in time according to 
the relation: 

 

(10) 

where: 

 - unknown parameter to be estimated,  

 

According to this model technical efficiency can vary in time, but the evolution is the 

same for all analyzed units. 

The  restrictions  regarding  the  function  of  the  stochastic  frontier  are  more  flexible 
when  a  functional  form  of  the  translog  (TL)  type  production  function  is  applied,  than 
when a Cobb-Douglas type functional form is applied. The translog form does not impose 
the  hypothesis  regarding  the  constant  elasticity  of  the  production  function  or  of  the 
elasticity of the substitution between inputs. Another advantage of the translog form is 
that  it  allows  data  to  indicate  the  real  value  of  the  curb  of  the  function,  rather  than 
imposing prior hypotheses regarding its value.  

The production frontier variable in time can be expressed in translog form thus: 

  (11) 

where: 

 –output  vector; 

 –input  vector; 

 –  independent  variable  coefficient; 

 –  random  error 

; 

 –  error  variable  that  follows  a  normal-truncated 

distribution; t – time component. 

The translog (TL) form (14) can be written more simply in the form: 

 

(12) 

Battese and Coelli (1995) introduced a model for the frontier of a panel-type set of 
. The authors presuppose as hypothesis 

data that quantifies the effect of inefficiency in

 

10 


that  the  term  non-negative  technical  efficiency  follows  a  truncated  distribution  with 
different environments for the analyzed units.  

 

(13) 

where: 

 – inefficiency of variable. 

In the analysis we will perform we be using for determining the stochastic production 

frontier the model developed by Battese and Coelli (1995). 

In order to quantify the mutations on the level of the productivity of banks we will 
use  the  total  productivity  index  of  the  Malmquist  factors.  The  Malmquist  index  was 
introduced by Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982). The advantage of this method is 
that the adopting of some restrictive hypotheses imposed in the approaches of Fisher or 
Törnqvist is not necessary. Besides, the hypothesis that companies have as objective the 
minimization  of  costs  or  the  maximization  of  incomes  must  not  be  considered,  an 
advantage in the analyses of the non-profit sectors or activities.  

The total productivity index of the Malmquist factors measures the modification of 
total productivity of the factors between the two periods of time, by calculating the ratio 
between the distance from each point observed in the respective technology. Färe et al. 
(1992) proposed the following form for the Malmquist index (output oriented), between 
two periods of time t (basic period) and (t+1) (current period):  

  (14) 

where we noted with 

 the distance from the point observed in the period t+1 

to  the  frontier  of  the  technology  of  period  t.  A  value  of

 proper  will  indicate  an 

increase of the total productivity of factors from one period to another, while an improper 
value corresponds to a decline of total productivity of factors.  

We must note that relation (14) is actually a geometric mean of two indexes of total 
productivity of factors: the first one evaluated in relation to the technology of period t, 
and  the  second  one  relative  to  the  technology  of  period  t+1.  Relation  (14)  can  be  re-
written in the form: 

 

11 


  (15) 

in which the ratio outside the square brackets measures the modification of the Farrell 
measure  of  the  output  oriented  technical  efficiency  between  the  periods  t  and  t+1.  In 
other words, the modification of efficiency is equivalent to the ratio of the two Farrell 
measures:  

 

(16) 

The remaining part is a measure of the technological modification – the geometrical 
 and 

mean of the modifications in technology between the two periods, evaluated in 

; that is:  

 (17) 

The  Malmquist  productivity  index  is  a  theoretical  index,  and  the  empirical 
application needs its estimation. The estimation of the distance function involved in the 
analysis  of  productivity  is  performed  by  using  linear  programming  methods  or 
econometrical methods. See Balk (2001), and Diewert and Nakamura (2003, 2005) for a 
synthesis  of  the  performed  researches.  In  the  performed  analysis  we  will  estimate  the 
Malmquist index with the help of the DEA-type linear programming method, a method 
that was introduced by Färe et al. (1992) and developed by many other authors (Fried, 
Lovell and Schmidt, 2008). 

In the empirical analysis of the mutations on the level of the productivity of banks we 
have  to  calculate  four  distance  measures  that  occur  in  equation  (14)  for  each  pair  of 
adjacent  periods  of  time.  Having  at  disposal  panel  sets  of  data,  we  can  calculate  the 
distance functions with the help of the DEA method. For the bank „i”, i =1,2,..., N the 
four  DEA  linear  programming  problems,  in  the  hypothesis  that  the  technologies  have 
constant returns to scale, can be written:  

 

12 


  

(18)  

 

(19) 

The  four  linear  programming  problems  must  be  solved  N  times,  once  for  each 
company in the ensemble. The introduction of solutions to the 4 problems in relation (14) 
allows for the estimation of the Malmquist index of productivity.  

The empirical results of the studies regarding the efficiency of banks show that the 
level of efficiency differs in time and from one bank to another, this entails that the level 
of efficiency of a bank is influenced by a series of micro and macroeconomic factors. The 
performances of a bank are determined by a series of internal factors that are specific to 
the  bank  and  external  factors  that  are  specific  to  the  environment  in  which  the  bank 
performs  its  activity,  these  factors  influence  the  degree  of  efficiency  of  the  respective 
bank.  

As such, the recognition and use of the factors that have a significant influence on the 

performance of banks are necessary conditions for improving efficiency.  

The  microeconomic  factors  have  a  influence  only  on  a  certain  area  of  activity  and 
include endogenous factors, such as used resources, used technology, size of the assets, 
invested capital, organization method and management that are manageable by the bank 
and exogenous factors such as specific legislation, market share, prices and availability of 
resources that do not depend only on the management of the bank. The macroeconomic 
factors  (inflation  level,  level  of  economic  growth,  GDP  per  capita,  population  etc.) 
influence the efficiency of all companies no matter the area of activity they perform in. 

In  the  literature  in  the  field,  the  studies  regarding  the  factors  influencing  the 

efficiency of banks used the following variables: 
• 
Microeconomic factors: total assets (Favero and Papi (1995), McKillop, Glass and 
Ferguson  (2002)),  profitability  (Casu  et  al.  (2004)),  capital  rate  (Casu  et  al.  (2004)), 

 

13 


loans/total  assets  ratio  (McKillop,  Glass  and  Ferguson  (2002)),  non-performing  loans 
(McKillop,  Glass  and  Ferguson  (2002)),  degree  of  liquidity  (McKillop,  Glass  and 
Ferguson (2002));  
• 
GDP/inhabitant (Grigorian and Manole, 2002).

In the analysis regarding the factors influencing the efficiency of banks we will use 
the method of multivariate regression that uses the estimated levels of efficiency through 
the parametric or non-parametric methods as dependent variables and a series of other 
factors as explicative variables. The empirical models used in the literature in the field 
(see Favero and Papi, 1995; Grigorian and Manole, 2002) use a two-stage procedure: in 
the first stage the level of efficiency is estimated through parametric or non-parametric 
methods and in the second stage the regression analysis is applied in which the levels of 
efficiency are dependent variables. 

According to Xue and Harker (1999), regression analysis is among the most useful 
and most widely used statistical methods. It is a reliable and easy to use tool to determine 
whether  or  not  certain  factors  influence  the  decision-making  unit's  (DMUs)  efficiency 
scores.  However,  because  efficiency  measures  range  between  0  and  1,  it  is  argued  to 
apply a two-tailed Tobit model in place of OLS regression to explore factors correlated 
with  inefficiency  thus,  given  that  the  dependent  variable,  the  efficiency  scores,  is 
distributed over a limited interval, it is appropriate to use a censored (Tobit) regression 
model to analyze the relationships with other variables. Furthermore, in smaller samples 
there is some concentration of the values of the dependent variable at the upper margin.  

Thus, according to this view, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, however, is 
not a valid method to use when the dependent variable is the DEA efficiency score. The 
dependent variable has an upper limit of 100 %, and therefore is a censored variable. If 
such censoring were the only concern, then Tobit regression could be used. But, because 
we  also  have  to  deal  with  biases  caused  by  inefficiency,  Tobit  regression  is  not  valid 
either (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000).

Because efficiency measures range between 0 and 1, it is argued to apply a two-tailed 
Tobit model in place of OLS regression to explore factors correlated with inefficiency 
thus, given that the dependent variable, the efficiency scores, is distributed over a limited 
interval,  it  is  appropriate  to  use  a  censored  (Tobit)  regression  model  to  analyze  the 
relationships  with  other  variables  (Hoff,  2007).  McDonald,  (2009)  advocate  not  using 
Tobit, he argued that Tobit estimation is inappropriate in the 2-stage of DEA, in contrast, 
OLS  is  a  consistent  estimator.  However,  theoretical  literature  provides  opposing 
arguments with respect to the use of OLS and Tobit in the second stage of the DEA based 
analysis. In our study, the focus is to measure the technical efficiency which is regressed 
by estimating OLS model. 

In order to determine which factors can affect the efficiency scores, we examine some 
aspects  of  bank’s  structure  which  is  related  to  efficiency  estimates.  For  this  purpose, 
efficiency  scores  are  regressed  on  a  set  of  common  explanatory  variables;  a  positive 
coefficient  implies  efficiency  increase  whereas  a  negative  coefficient  means  an 
association with an efficiency decline. 
3. Data and variables used  

The data used in the analysis of bank efficiency in CEE are taken from the Annual 
reports of banks, the Reports of the National Bank and from Bankers Almanac Database. 
The  data  set  comprises  information  regarding  the  112  banks  in  Bulgaria  (21),  Czech 
Republic (9), Poland (23), Romania (23), Slovak Republic (10), Slovenia (13), Hungary 
(13) in the period 2004-2008.  

In the literature in the field there is no consensus regarding the inputs and outputs that 
must  be  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  efficiency  of  commercial  banks  (Berger  and 
Humphrey, 1997). In the studies in the field five approaches for the definition of inputs 
and  outputs  in  the  analysis  of  the  efficiency  of  a  bank  were  developed,  these  are: 
Intermediation  approach;  Production  approach;  Assets  approach;  User  costs  approach; 
Value added approach. 

According to the Intermediation approach, banks are considered intermediaries that 
transfer  the  financial  resources  from  the  agents  with  surplus  of  funds  to  those  with  a 
deficit of funds. In this approach it is considered that the bank uses as inputs: deposits, 

 

15 


other  funds,  equity  and  work,  which  they  transform  into  outputs  such  as:  loans  and 
financial investments. 

The  opportunity  of  using  each  method  varies  depending  on  the  circumstances 
(Tortosa-Ausina,  2002).  This  intermediation  approach  is  argued  to  be  particularly 
appropriate for banks where most activities consist of turning large deposits and funds 
purchased  from  other  financial  institutions  into  loans  or  financing  and  investments 
(Favero and Papi, 1995). 

In the performed analysis we will use the following set of inputs and outputs in order 
to quantify the efficiency and mutations on the level of the productivity of banks: outputs: 
Total  loans  (LOAN);  Total  investments  (INV);  Other  incomes  (OI);  Inputs:  Total 
deposits and borrowings (DEP); Fixed assets (FA); Total operational expenses (OE). All 
variables are expressed in USD. 

In  the  analysis  of  the  factors  influencing  the  efficiency  level  of  the  banks  in  CEE 
countries we used the following variables: bank capital structure (Equity/Total assets – 
EC_TA  in  USD);  size  of  the  bank  (Total  Assets  –  TA  in  USD);  Total  Asset  Banking 
System  (TABS  in  million  EUR);  return  on  average  equity  (ROE);  return  on  assets 
(ROA);  GDP  increase  rate  (%)  (GDP);  annual  inflation  rate  (%)  (IR);  Asset  share  of 
state-owned  banks  (%)  (ASO);  Asset  share  of  foreign-owned  banks  (%)  (AFO);  Bank 
nonperforming  loans  to  total  gross  loans  percentage  (NPL);  Domestic  credit  to  private 
sector  (DC);  ownership  form  of  the  bank  (FP);  the  level  of  concentration  in  banking 
system (Herfindahl-Hirschmann index – HHI); percentage of the assets owned by the 5 
largest  banks  in  the  system  (S5);  the  banking  reform  and  interest  rate  liberalisation 
indicator (BRIRI); Refinancing rate (RR); Interbank market rate (IMR); deposit rate (DR) 
and lending rate (LR). 
5. The empirical results 

Considering  that  our  database  is  a  panel-type  base  we  can  estimate  the  efficiency 
frontier  for  all  banks  for  the  entire  analyzed  period  or  we  can  estimate  an  efficiency 
frontier separately for all the years. In the literature in the field it is claimed the fact that 
building a separate frontier for all the years offers a higher flexibility than a single multi-
annual  frontier  (Bauer,  Berger  and  Humphrey  1993).  Building  some  separate  frontiers 
allows for the analysis of the evolution of the efficiency degree on the level of each bank 

 

16 


in time, a very important aspect especially in the situation when the market conditions 
change. 

Table no.1  

 

From  empirical  results  we  see  that  the  average  efficiency  of  banks  in  Central  and 
Eastern  European  countries  grew  in  the  period  analyzed.  Increase  may  be  due  to 
increased competition with EU accession and the entry of foreign banks, also caused by 
extensive  legislative  changes  which  led  banks  to  become  more  efficient.  Based  on  the 
results  we  see  that  the  highest  level  of  technical  efficiency  are  recorded  in  banking 
systems from Romania and Czech Republic, and the lowest are recorded in Slovenia. 

Looking  at  the  average  efficiency  scores  for  each  country,  we  observe  significant 
variation across the banking systems of the Central and East European country. Technical 
efficiency values estimates with SFA method range from 0,6275 in Slovak Republic to 
0,8644 in Romania. 

We determined with the help of the linear programming method, respectively of the 
Malmquist productivity indexes, both the modification of productivity in the 5 analyzed 
years,  and  the  decomposition  of  this  modification  in  the  components:  modification  of 
technical efficiency and technological modification. 

The analysis is based on the hypothesis of constant returns to scale, as two authors 
with  important  preoccupations  in  the  field  suggested.  Grifell-Tatje  and  Lovell  (1995) 
made the recommendation that, when the Malmquist productivity indexes are determined, 
technology is presupposed with constant returns to scale, in order to highlight the gains or 
losses owed to the scale effects. 

Table no.2  

 

In the analyzed period, on average, the productivity of banks increased in 2008 by 
approximately 24,27 % in relation to 2004, an increase owed especially to technological 
modification.  

 

Table no.3  

Analysis of technical efficiency level of banks in the Central and Eastern European 
countries shows that private banks are more efficient than state-owned banks, which may 
support  the  idea  that  the  state  should  privatize  all  banks  which  is  the  majority 

 

17 


shareholder. In terms of productivity we see that state-owned banks have recorded in the 
period under review a larger increase than that of private banks, this may be explained by 
the  modernization  and  restructuring  state  banks  due  to  increased  competition  in  the 
banking systems of these states. 

Tabel no. 3 also shows the average technical efficiency results for banks of different 
size. Banks are classified into 3 different categories considering the size of total assets of 
banks: small if it has total assets< 1 000 mil EUR; medium if it has total assets >1000 mil 
EUR and <10 000 mil EUR; and large if it has total assets > 10 000 mil EUR. The results 
reveal that the medium sized banks show the highest growth in terms of productivity and 
the small medium sized banks are more efficient than large and medium sized banks. 

Table no.4  

 

 

The  application  of  the  OLS  regression  analysis  in  the  analysis  of  the  factors 
influencing the level of efficiency of banks showed that the technical efficiency of banks 
in CEE countries is influenced by the following variables: bank capital structure; size of 
the bank; total asset of banking system; annual inflation rate; asset share of state-owned 
banks;  asset  share  of  foreign-owned  banks;  ownership  form  of  the  bank;  the  level  of 
concentration in banking system; percentage of the assets owned by the 5 largest banks in 
the  system;  the  banking  reform  and  interest  rate  liberalization  level;  deposit  rate  and 
lending rate. 
6. Conclusions  

In  this  paper  we  examine  the  productivity,  efficiency  and  its  determinants  of 
Central and Eastern European banking systems during a four-year period from 2004 to 
2008. 

We use two approaches in order to examine the efficiency of the banking industry 

in Romania: Stochastic Frontier and Data Envelopment Analysis.  

From  analyze  results  we  see  that  the  average  efficiency  of  banks  in  Central  and 
Eastern European countries grew in period analyzed. Increase may be due to increased 
competition with EU accession and the entry of foreign banks, also caused by extensive 
legislative changes which led banks to become more efficient. Based on the results we 
see that the highest level of technical efficiency are recorded in banking systems from 
Romania and Czech Republic, and the lowest are recorded in Slovenia.

In  order  to  assess  the  level  of  productivity  growth  of  the  banking  industry,  we 
calculate Malmquist productivity index, calculated using the linear programming. In the 
analyzed  period,  on  average,  the  productivity  of  banks  increased  in  2008  by 
approximately 24,27 % in relation to 2004 

Analysis results achieved are very important in terms of banks and governmental 
authorities  perspectives.  Thus,  banks  to  increase  the  efficiency  need  to  improve  the 
quality  of  assets  owned  by  improving  the  lending  process  and  adjust  the  bank  capital 
structure. A topic of interest in the current context of international economic and financial 
crisis is the optimal size of banks, the analysis results as an increase in bank size, gauged 
by total assets held, results in an increase in technical efficiency. To facilitate increase the 
level  of  efficiency  of  banks,  government  authorities  must  accelerate  the  process  of 
liberalization and reform of the banking system and make every effort to ensure a low 
inflation rate.
