 DELEGATION AND EMPLOYEE WORK OUTCOMES:

 AN EXAMINATION OF THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF

 MEDIATING PROCESSES IN CHINA

 We used cultural self-representation theory to develop a model of the processes linking
 delegation to work outcomes. We tested this model with data from a sample of 171
 subordinate-supervisor dyads from the People's Republic of China. Regression results
 revealed that organization-based self-esteem and perceived insider status fully medi
 ated the influence of delegation on affective organizational commitment, task perfor
 mance, and innovative behavior and partially mediated delegation's influence on job
 satisfaction. Furthermore, traditionally moderated the relationships between delega
 tion and the mediators in such a way that the relationships were stronger for individ
 uals lower rather than higher in traditionality.

 As a form of employee involvement in decision
 making, delegation describes a category of leader
 behavior that entails assignment of new responsi
 bilities to subordinates and additional authority to
 carry them out (Yukl, 1998) or a supervisor's em
 powerment of a subordinate to take responsibility
 for certain activities (Bass, 1990). The practitioner
 literature promotes delegation as a critical element
 in leadership effectiveness and is replete with pre
 scriptive accounts of why and how to delegate
 (Ford, 1983; McConkey, 1974). In the past two de
 cades or so, the prescriptive accounts of delegation
 in the practitioner literature have been comple
 mented by empirical research. Much of this re
 search has focused on why managers delegate
 (Leana, 1986,1987; Yukl & Fu, 1998) and outcomes
 of delegation such as job satisfaction and perfor
 mance (Farrow, Valenzi, & Bass, 1980; Leana, 1986,
 1987; Schriesheim, Neider, & Scandura, 1998). Al
 though the empirical research has illuminated un
 derstanding of why managers delegate and the out
 comes of delegation, there is a paucity of research
 on the conditions under which delegation is effec
 tive (Leana, 1986, 1987; Schriesheim et al., 1998;
 Yukl, 1998) and why delegation is related to its
 demonstrated outcomes. The growing adoption of
 flat or nonhierarchical organizational structures
 and the consequent empowering of employees to
 create effective workplaces suggest that delegation

 will become an increasingly popular managerial
 technique or leader behavior. Understanding the
 processes through which delegation influences em
 ployee work outcomes therefore constitutes an im
 portant research task.

 Underpinned by Erez and Earley's (1993) cul
 tural self-representation model, the first objective
 of the current study was to examine the self
 concept constructs of organization-based self
 esteem (OBSE) and perceived insider status (PIS) as
 mediators of the relationship between delegation
 and the work outcomes of job satisfaction, affective
 organizational commitment, task performance, and
 innovative behavior. Further, research on delega
 tion has rarely been conducted in non-Western
 contexts; hence, knowledge of the cultural vari
 ables that promote effective delegation in these
 contexts is scant. A second objective of the current
 study was to examine the moderating influence of
 the individual cultural value orientation of tradi
 tionality (Farh, Earley, & Lin, 1997) on the relation
 ship between delegation and the self-concept con
 structs of organization-based self-esteem and
 perceived insider status in a non-Western setting
 (i.e., China). Figure 1 schematically depicts these
 objectives.

 THEORY AND HYPOTHESES

 The cultural self-representation model proposed
 by Erez and Earley (1993) represents a culture
 based model of work motivation that evaluates the
 motivational potential of managerial techniques or

 practices (e.g., delegation) across cultures. The
 model's assumption is that individuals self-regu
 late behavior by processing self-relevant informa
 tion in terms of the extent to which it contributes to
 self-worth and well-being. In the processing of self
 relevant information, cultural values play an im
 portant role in determining the implications of
 managerial practices for self-concept. This is be
 cause cultural values define what it means to be a
 person in a particular society and therefore provide
 the criteria for evaluating managerial practices in
 terms of the extent to which they satisfy self
 derived motives leading to enhanced self-worth
 and well-being. Consequently, congruence between
 a managerial practice and the cultural values in a
 particular society has a positive effect on employee
 work attitudes and behavior (Newman & Nollen,
 1996).

 Following Erez and Earley (1993), we posited
 that self-concept constitutes an underlying mecha
 nism through which delegation is related to work
 outcomes. Self-concept describes the "totality of an
 individual's thoughts and feelings having reference
 to him or herself as an object" (Rosenberg, 1979: 7).
 Although self-concept is considered to be highly
 complex, Gecas (1982) distinguished between two
 dimensions of the construct: (1) self-conception
 and (2) self-evaluation. In his view, self-conception
 is defined by, for example, identity, which reflects
 the meanings that comprise the self as an object. In
 the context of the current study, identity is re
 flected by a person's status as an organizational

 insider. Since perceived insider status connotes an
 employee's sense of having earned a personal space
 and acceptance as an organizational member
 (Masterson & Stamper, 2003: 483), the status of
 organizational insider defines his or her identity.
 Hence, perceived insider status reflects the self
 conception dimension of self-concept. In contrast,
 Gecas (1982: 4) considered self-esteem an example
 of the self-evaluation dimension of self-concept.
 This is because self-esteem reflects a personal eval
 uation of what one thinks of oneself as an individ
 ual. Given our focus on self-esteem in the context of
 work, and following Gecas (1982), organization
 based self-esteem represents the self-evaluation
 component of self-concept in our study.

 Delegation and Employee Self-Concept

 Following Tharenou's (1979) recommendation
 that the conceptualization and measurement of
 self-esteem should be consonant with a given situ
 ation, Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, and Dunham
 (1989) developed and validated a measure of organ
 ization-based self-esteem. It describes the self
 perceived value that individuals have of them
 selves as important, competent, and capable within
 their employing organizations; employees with
 high organization-based self-esteem have come to
 believe that "I count around here" (Pierce & Gard
 ner, 2004: 593). As a leader behavior, delegation
 will foster high levels of organization-based self
 esteem. This is because delegation provides an em

 ployee the opportunity to exercise self-direction
 and control, which signals to the employee that the
 supervisor/organization considers him or her to be
 able, task-competent, organizationally important,
 and need-satisfying (Gardner, Van Dyne, & Pierce,
 2004; Pierce & Gardner, 2004). The incorporation of
 such positive messages into the employee's self
 concept leads to enhanced organization-based
 self-esteem.

 Perceived insider status depicts an employee's
 conception of him-/herself as having earned a per
 sonal space and acceptance inside a work organi
 zation and therefore, a sense of personal related
 ness with other organization members (Stamper &
 Masterson, 2002). Following leader-member ex
 change (LMX) theory (Dansereau, Graen, & Haga,
 1975; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995), we expect delega
 tion to be related to perceived insider status. Ac
 cording to LMX theory, leaders develop differenti
 ated relationships with subordinates ranging from
 low to high quality, and the level of a given rela
 tionship's quality may be reflected in the subordi
 nate's status as out-group or in-group member.
 Drawing an analogy to these differentiated relation
 ships a leader develops with his/her subordinates,
 Stamper and Masterson (2002) argued that per
 ceived insider status connotes differentiated rela
 tionships that organizations have with employees.
 In their view, organizations foster a differentiation
 of their workforces (insiders versus outsiders) by
 using inducements such as benefits, training, and
 promotion (which define the quality of the employ
 ment relationship) to send signals to certain em
 ployees that they have achieved insider status
 (Stamper & Masterson, 2002: 877). Supporting LMX
 theory predictions, the high-quality employee
 organization relationship that the leader behavior
 of delegation fosters will enhance or signal to an
 employee his/her status or identity as a member not
 only of the supervisor's but also of the organiza
 tion's in-group. Further, delegation will be posi
 tively related to perceived insider status because
 being empowered to take responsibility for certain
 activities signals inclusion or acceptance in the
 organization and therefore the individual's re
 spected position within the organization.

 Hypothesis 1. Delegation is positively related
 to both organization-based self-esteem and
 perceived insider status.

 Mediating Influence of Employee Self-Concept

 In addition to the work outcomes of job satisfac
 tion and task performance (Farrow et al., 1980;
 Leana, 1986, 1987), we hypothesized that delega

 tion is related to affective organizational commit
 ment and innovative behavior. Given that delega
 tion reflects high-quality employee-organization
 relationships, it will encourage employees to incor
 porate their statuses as organization members into
 their self-concepts, leading to affective organiza
 tional commitment. The influence of delegation on
 innovative behavior can be explained in terms of
 the opportunity to experience self-direction in
 work that delegation engenders. The experience of
 self-direction will motivate employees to experi
 ment with new ways of doing their jobs, leading to
 innovative behavior. We contend, however, that
 the influence of delegation on these work outcomes
 is indirect, mediated through the self-concept con
 structs of organization-based self-esteem and per
 ceived insider status.

 The hypothesized mediating influence of the two
 self-concept constructs on the relationships be
 tween delegation and the work outcomes is predi
 cated on the notion that, as a managerial behavior,
 delegation enhances self-concept, and the motiva
 tional implications of self-concept (Markus & Wurf,
 1987; Shamir, 1991) in turn influence work out
 comes. Organization-based self-esteem has been
 shown to be related to job satisfaction, organiza
 tional commitment, task performance, and extra
 role behavior (Chen, Aryee, & Lee, 2005; Judge &
 Bono, 2001; Pierce et al., 1989; Pierce & Gardner,
 2004). Self-consistency, employed as a regulatory
 mechanism, may explain the demonstrated out
 comes of organization-based self-esteem. Korman
 posited that "all other things being equal, individ
 uals will engage in and find satisfying those behav
 ioral roles which maximize their sense of cognitive
 balance or consistency" (1970: 32). According to
 Korman (1970), individuals with high organiza
 tion-based self-esteem will engage in behavior, pos
 sess attitudes, and choose roles that reinforce their
 positive self-cognition. Although some evidence
 links organization-based self-esteem to extra-role or
 discretionary behavior (Pierce & Gardner, 2004),
 innovative behavior has not been previously exam
 ined as an outcome of organization-based self
 esteem. Innovative behavior entails the production
 or adaptation of useful ideas and idea implementa
 tion (Kanter, 1988). It may involve a fair amount of
 risk taking, especially in the implementation stage,

 1 In addition to self-consistency, self-protection and
 self-enhancement motives operate in the service of the
 self. Self-enhancement describes a motivation to attain
 outcomes that indicate personal growth, whereas self
 protection represents a defense of one's self-concept from
 threatening environmental forces (Korman, 2001).

 when an individual will need to build a coalition of
 supporters to sponsor the idea. In keeping with their
 positive self-cognition as competent and capable em
 ployees, individuals with high organization-based
 self-esteem will be more willing to take risks and
 thereby will engage more in innovative behavior than
 individuals with low organization-based self-esteem.
 Those individuals and individuals who have nega
 tive self-cognition will engage in behavior or hold
 attitudes that reinforce or are consistent with that
 image and preclude taking the risk of experimenting
 with new ways of performing their task roles. Fur
 thermore, high organization-based self-esteem indi
 viduals will hold attitudes about their jobs and
 organizations that reflect their sense of value
 and/or importance to the organization, leading to
 job satisfaction and affective organizational com
 mitment. Given that organization-based self-es
 teem and its motivational implications are more
 proximal to work outcomes, organization-based
 self-esteem will mediate the influence of delega
 tion on work outcomes.

 As an indicator of the quality of an employment
 relationship, we expect perceived insider status to
 be related to the behavioral and attitudinal work
 outcomes. The influence of perceived insider status
 on employee task performance and innovative be
 havior can be explained in terms of the motiva
 tional implications of membership. Stamper and
 Masterson (2002) equated organizational insider
 status to Graham's (1991) notion of citizenship,
 with its implied acceptance of certain responsibil
 ities. They therefore argued that an individual's
 conception of him-/herself as an organizational in
 sider leads him or her to accept the responsibilities
 of citizenship. This acceptance entails performing
 the prescribed work role dependably as well as
 engaging in discretionary work roles such as inno
 vative behavior (Stamper & Masterson, 2002). Per
 ceived insider status fosters a sense of belonging
 that encourages employees to explore ways of pro
 moting both their organization's and their own fu
 ture well-being. We argue that exploring ways to
 promote that mutual future well-being motivates
 organizational insiders to engage in innovative be
 havior. The impact of perceived insider status on
 job satisfaction and affective organizational com
 mitment is explicable in terms of the inducements
 employees receive from their organization. Draw
 ing on inducement and contribution theory (March
 & Simon, 1958), Stamper and Masterson (2002) ar
 gued that one of the reasons why employees regard
 themselves as organizational insiders is that they
 receive more inducements from their organization
 (e.g., training and promotion opportunities) than
 do other employees, which leads to job satisfaction.

 The inducements organizational insiders receive
 also reflect the quality of their employment rela
 tionship, which they reciprocate by incorporating
 their organizational membership into their self
 concept, leading to affective organizational com
 mitment. In addition, attainment of organizational
 insider status satisfies the socioemotional need for
 affiliation or belonging, leading employees to in
 corporate their organizational membership and role
 status into their self-concept (cf. Rhoades, Eisen
 berger, & Armeli, 2001). Demonstrating positive
 work behavior and possessing positive work atti
 tudes will be consistent with one's self-concept of
 perceived insider status, which will, therefore, me
 diate the influence of delegation on work
 outcomes.

 Following the preceding discussion, and to the
 extent that delegation is positively related to the
 self-concept constructs, which are in turn related to
 the work outcomes, we expect the delegation-work
 outcome relationships to be indirect, operating
 through the motivational implications of organiza
 tion-based self-esteem and perceived insider status.
 Hypothesis 2a. Organization-based self-esteem
 and perceived insider status are both positively
 related to job satisfaction and mediate the del
 egation-job satisfaction relationship.
 Hypothesis 2b. Organization-based self-esteem
 and perceived insider status are both positively
 related to affective organizational commitment
 and mediate the delegation-affective organiza
 tional commitment relationship.
 Hypothesis 2c. Organization-based self-esteem
 and perceived insider status are both positively
 related to task performance and mediate the
 delegation-task performance relationship.
 Hypothesis 2d. Organization-based self-esteem
 and perceived insider status are both positively
 related to innovative behavior and mediate the
 delegation-innovative behavior relationship.

 Traditionality as a Moderator of Delegation-Self
 Concept Relationships

 In view of the emergent trend of examining indi

 vidual-level orientations that reflect cultural values
 (Lam, Chen, & Schaubroeck, 2002), we examined
 traditionality as a moderator of the relationship
 between delegation and self-concept. Schwartz
 (1992) defined traditionality as commitment to, re
 spect for, and acceptance of the customs and norms
 of a traditional society. In Chinese society, the de
 fining characteristics of the traditional culture in
 clude respect for authority, filial piety, ancestor

 worship, fatalism, and a general sense of powerless
 ness (Yang, Yu, & Yeh, 1989). Because respect for
 authority is a key aspect of traditionality (Farh et al.,
 1997), researchers (Hui, Lee, & Rousseau, 2004) have
 suggested that high-traditionality employees have
 characteristics similar to the characteristics of those
 high in "power distance," and low-traditionality em
 ployees are similar to those low in power distance.
 Hofstede (1991: 28) defined power distance as the
 extent to which less powerful members of institutions
 and organizations in a country expect and accept that
 power is distributed unequally. In the context of an
 organization, it is typical for high-traditionality indi
 viduals (who resemble high power distance individ
 uals) to accept status differences, and their behavior
 tends to be guided by their role as subordinates. Thus,
 high-traditionality employees tend to be more willing
 to comply with their leaders' directives but less in
 clined to assume roles that fall within the domain of
 the leader, and may even be distressed when empow
 ered to do so. The reluctance of high-traditionality
 individuals to accept responsibility for certain work
 related activities may stem from their sense of pow
 erlessness or low sense of agency. As a result, dele
 gation will not enhance the self-concept of high
 traditionality individuals. Indeed, Kirkman and
 Shapiro (1997) suggested that high power distance
 employees (who are similar to high-traditionality em
 ployees) may resist the type of autonomy and respon
 sibility that characterize a high degree of self-manage
 ment. In contrast, low-traditionality individuals (who
 are similar to low power distance individuals), who
 may be similar to those observed in Western settings,
 are less constrained by the expectations of the subor
 dinate-superior relationship. Such individuals may
 have a high sense of agency and will therefore be
 more desirous of obtaining authority to carry out cer
 tain work-related activities. Consequently, delegation
 will be instrumental in enhancing not only a low
 traditionality individual's perception of his/her sta
 tus in a group (perceived insider status) but also his/
 her belief that "I am an important part of this place"
 (organization-based self-esteem).
 Hypothesis 3. Traditionality moderates the
 relationships between delegation and both
 organization-based self-esteem and per
 ceived insider status in such a way that the
 relationships will be stronger for people
 lower, rather than higher, in traditionality.

 METHODS

 Sample and Procedures

 Participants in the current study were employees

 of a manufacturing company located in a major city

 in southern China. Separate questionnaires were
 administered to supervisors and subordinates. The
 supervisor questionnaires were distributed to 70
 supervisors, and the subordinate questionnaires
 were distributed to 210 immediate subordinates of
 these supervisors. Each supervisor was asked to
 rate the job performance indicators of three of his/
 her immediate subordinates. The average span of
 control for supervisors in this sample was about 13
 employees. With the assistance of the human re
 source department and using systematic sampling,
 we randomly selected three immediate subordi
 nates for each supervisor in order to ensure objec
 tivity in the ratings of the focal performance indi
 cators. Respondents were informed that the survey
 aimed to examine their experience of the compa
 ny's human resource practices and were assured of
 the confidentiality of responses. Completed sur
 veys were individually returned to a box in the
 human resource department designated for that
 purpose. Sixty-two supervisor and 185 subordinate
 questionnaires were returned, for response rates of
 88.1 and 88.6 percent, respectively. After we had
 deleted records with unmatched supervisor-subor
 dinate pairs, a total of 171 supervisor-subordinate
 dyads (171 subordinates and 62 supervisors) re
 mained and constituted the sample for this study.
 Of the 171 respondents, 62.6 percent were male.
 Respondents reported an average age of 26.84 years
 (s.d. = 6.25), an average organizational tenure of
 3.46 years (s.d. = 3.60), and an average of 12.01
 years of education (s.d. = 2.85). They represented
 diverse occupational backgrounds, including ac
 counting/finance (7.6%), engineering (16.0%),
 sales/marketing (14.5%), production/manufactur
 ing (44.3%), computer systems (2.3%), human re
 sources/administration (9.9%), consumer services
 (2.3%), and research and development (3.1%). Of
 the supervisors, 63.6 percent were men; the average
 reported age was 37.45 years (s.d. = 9.80), the av
 erage reported organizational tenure, 4.12 years
 (s.d. = 2.42), and the average reported education,
 13.85 years (s.d. = 2.49). In terms of level in the
 management hierarchy, 41.4 percent were lower
 level managers, 45.1 percent were middle-level
 managers, and 13.6 percent were senior/top-level
 managers.

 Measures

 With the exception of two scales (traditionality
 and task performance), the measures were origi
 nally constructed in English. To assure equivalence
 of the measures in the Chinese and the English
 versions of the survey instrument, we performed a
 standard translation and back-translation proce

 dure (Brislin, 1980). The Chinese version was sub
 sequently pilot-tested on employees of the partici
 pating organization who were not included in the
 final sample. On the basis of the feedback, we re
 worded a few items to ensure clarity. Unless other
 wise indicated, response options ranged from 1,
 "strongly disagree," to 5, "strongly agree."
 Delegation. As a form of empowerment or self
 direction in the context of work, delegation differs
 from the conceptually similar construct of auton
 omy. We conceptualized delegation as a form of
 leader behavior but autonomy as a structural fea
 ture of a job (Hackman & Oldham, 1980). We used
 a six-item scale (Schriesheim et al., 1998) based on
 two three-item scales developed and validated by
 Schriesheim and Neider (1988) to measure per
 ceived delegation. Response options ranged from 1,
 "none of the time," to 5, "always." Sample items
 were, "My supervisor does not require that I get
 his/her input or approval before making decisions"
 and "My supervisor permits me to get needed in
 formation from him/her and then make my own
 decisions." We conducted an exploratory factor
 analysis of the six delegation items whereby the
 factors were extracted using principal components
 and the resulting factor matrix rotated by varimax.
 The results yielded a one-factor solution because
 the latent root for factor 2 (= .08) was smaller than
 1 (cf. Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998).
 Thus, we combined the two scales to create a com
 posite measure. The scale's reliability of .87 com
 pared favorably with the .84 reported by
 Schriesheim et al. (1998).

 Organization-based self-esteem. We used
 Pierce et al.'s (1989) ten-item scale, which has pre
 viously been used in a Chinese context (Chen et al,,
 2005; Hui & Lee, 2000) to measure organization
 based self-esteem. Sample items were, "I count
 around here" and "I am taken seriously around
 here." The scale's reliability was .91.

 Perceived insider status. We used a six-item
 scale developed by Stamper and Masterson (2002)
 to measure perceived insider status. Sample items
 were, "I feel I am an 'insider' in my work organ
 ization" and "My work organization makes me be
 lieve that I am included in it." The scale's reliabil
 ity was .80.

 Job satisfaction. We used a five-item general job
 satisfaction scale within Hackman and Oldham's
 (1975) Job Diagnostic Survey to measure job satis
 faction. Sample items were, "Generally speaking, I
 am very satisfied with this job" and "I frequently
 think of quitting this job" (reverse-scored). The
 scale's reliability was .85.

 Affective organizational commitment. We used
 Meyer, Allen, and Smith's (1993) six-item scale to

 measure affective organizational commitment. This
 scale has previously been used in a Chinese context
 (Chen & Francesco, 2003). Sample items were, "I
 would be very happy to spend the rest of my career
 in this organization" and "This organization has a
 great deal of personal meaning for me." The scale's
 reliability was .82.

 Task performance. We used a four-item scale
 developed by Farh and Cheng (1999) to measure
 task performance. This scale has previously been
 used in a Chinese context (Chen, Tsui, & Farh,
 2002). Sample items were, "This subordinate
 makes an important contribution to the overall per
 formance of our work unit" and "The performance
 of this subordinate always meets my (supervisor's)
 requirements/expectations." The scale's reliability
 was .76.

 Innovative behavior. We used a six-item scale
 by Scott and Bruce (1994) to measure innovative
 behavior. Supervisors rated each of their subordi
 nates who participated in the survey on the extent
 to which "this employee generates creative ideas"
 and "this employee develops adequate plans and
 schedules for the implementation of new ideas."
 The scale's reliability was .76.

 Traditionality. We used eight items from the
 Chinese Individual Traditionality Scale developed
 by Yang et al. (1989) to measure this construct. This
 eight-item scale, including the five items used by
 Farh et al. (1997), has been previously used in a
 study conducted in mainland China (Chen, 1997).
 Sample items were, "The best way to avoid mis
 takes is to follow the instructions of senior per
 sons" and "When people are in dispute, they
 should ask the most senior person to decide who is
 right." The scale's reliability was .89.

 Controls. We controlled for four demographic
 variables and one contextual variable that might
 potentially confound the results. Previous research
 has shown age, gender, and tenure to be related to
 affective organizational commitment (Meyer, Stan
 ley, Herscovitch, & Topolnytsky, 2002). Education
 has been found to be related to innovative behavior
 (Scott & Bruce, 1994), and gender has been found to
 be related to task performance (Chen, Tsui, & Farh,
 2002). Gender and education have been shown to
 be related to traditionality (Farh et al., 1997). Age,
 education, and tenure were measured by number of
 years. Gender was coded 1 for "male" and 0 for
 "female." The contextual variable of position in the
 organizational hierarchy was coded 1 for "nonman
 agerial employee," 2 for "first-level supervisor/
 manager," 3 for "middle-level manager," and 4 for
 "senior-level manager." We controlled for position
 because lower-level employees may respond more
 positively to delegation than higher-level employ

 ees, because the role of lower-level employees gen
 erally precludes having the authority to take re
 sponsibility for certain task-related activities.

 Data Analysis

 To examine the distinctiveness of the study vari
 ables, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis
 (CFA) using LISREL 8.5 (J?reskog & S?rbom, 2001).
 We compared the fit of our hypothesized model to
 a number of nested plausible alternative models.
 After demonstrating the distinctiveness of the
 study variables, following Baron and Kenny's
 (1986) recommended conditions for establishing
 mediation, we tested Hypothesis 1 and Hypotheses
 2a to 2d using regression analysis. To test Hypoth
 esis 3, we conducted a moderated regression anal
 ysis. Following Aiken and West (1991), to reduce
 multicollinearity we centred the variables used in
 the interaction term.

 RESULTS

 Table 1 presents the results of the CFA that ex
 amined the distinctiveness of the study variables.
 As shown in this table, the fit indexes revealed the
 hypothesized eight-factor model was better fitting
 than any of the alternative nested models, indicat
 ing support for the distinctiveness of the constructs
 in the study.

 Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations,
 and correlations among the study variables and the
 controls. Table 3 presents results of the regression
 analysis.

 As shown in Table 3 (model 1, Hypothesis 1),
 delegation was related to organization-based self
 esteem (? = .52, p < .01) and perceived insider
 status (? = .29, p < .01). Furthermore, the results
 showed that delegation was related to the work
 outcomes of affective organizational commitment
 (? = .27, p < .01), job satisfaction (? = .35, p < .01),
 task performance (? = .24, p < .01), and innovative
 behavior (? = .20, p < .01). As is evident from the

 table (model 2), both organization-based self
 esteem and perceived insider status were signifi
 cantly related to each of the work outcomes exam
 ined when delegation, the demographic character
 istics, and the contextual variable of position in the
 organizational hierarchy were controlled for. Per
 taining to the mediated hypotheses, model 2 fur
 ther revealed that with the exception of job satis
 faction, the previously significant relationships
 between delegation and the work outcomes ceased
 to be significant in the presence of the two media
 tors. Taken together, the support for Hypothesis 1
 and the significant relationship between delegation
 and the work outcomes confirmed two of the con
 ditions for testing mediation. However, since dele
 gation continued to be significantly related to job
 satisfaction in model 2, the third condition for me
 diation was only partially supported. Specifically,
 Hypothesis 2a received partial support, whereas
 Hypotheses 2b-2d were fully supported.

 Table 4 presents the results of the moderated
 regression analysis that examined the moderating
 influence of traditionality on the relationships be
 tween delegation and the self-concept constructs of
 organization-based self-esteem and perceived in
 sider status. As predicted (Hypothesis 3), tradition
 ality negatively moderated the influence of delega
 tion on organization-based self-esteem (? = -.25,
 p < .01) and perceived insider status [? = -.23, p <
 .01). Their interaction term accounted for 6 percent
 (An2 = .06, AF = 14.14, p < .01) and 5 percent
 (AjR2 = .05, AF = 9.50, p < .01) of the explained
 variance in organization-based self-esteem and per
 ceived insider status, respectively.

 To interpret the moderated effects, we calcu
 lated regression equations for the relationship
 between delegation and each of the self-concept
 variables at high and low levels of traditionality.
 Following Cohen and Cohen (1983), we defined
 the high and low values as plus and minus one
 standard deviation from the mean. In Figures 2
 and 3, as predicted, the plots of the interaction
 terms show that delegation was related to both

 perceived insider status. Furthermore, both self
 concept constructs were related to each of the work
 outcomes and fully mediated the influence of del
 egation on the work outcomes, except in the case of
 job satisfaction, where mediation was partial. The
 moderated regression results revealed that the in
 fluence of delegation on both organization-based
 self-esteem and perceived insider status was con
 tingent upon the individual cultural value orienta
 tion of traditionality. Delegation positively en
 hanced self-concept for individuals who were low
 in traditionality but did not enhance self-concept
 for high-traditionality indi vidais. This finding sug
 gests that employees do not uniformly interpret the
 signal that delegation conveys and that traditional
 ity constitutes an important cultural value orienta
 tion that moderates the delegation-self-concept
 relationship.

 Theoretical Implications

 Our findings regarding mediation contribute to
 the delegation literature in several ways. First, the
 mediating effect of self-concept moves research on
 delegation beyond main effects to an examination

 of the mechanisms that underpin the demonstrated
 influence of delegation on work outcomes. Specif
 ically, they lead us to suggest that, at least in a
 Chinese context, the previously demonstrated in
 fluence of delegation on work outcomes (Farrow et
 al., 1980; Schriesheim et al., 1998) is indirect, op
 erating through enhancement of the self-concept
 constructs of organization-based self-esteem and
 perceived insider status. Schriesheim and his col
 leagues (1998) theorized that delegation influences
 employee work outcomes through job characteris
 tics model relationships (Hackman & Oldham,
 1980). In light of our findings, future research may
 need to examine the relative utility of self-concept
 and job characteristics as mechanisms through
 which delegation influences employee work out
 comes. Second, our findings support the cultural
 self-representation model in which Erez and Earley
 (1993) propose that self-concept (e.g., organization
 based self-esteem and perceived insider status)
 mediates the relationship between managerial
 practices (e.g., delegation) and employee work out
 comes (e.g., affective organizational commitment,
 task performance, and innovative behavior). Addi
 tionally, the mediating role of self-concept further
 underscores its motivational implications (Markus
 & Wurf, 1987; Shamir, 1991). In his formulation of
 a self-concept-based motivational theory, Shamir
 (1991) posited that work behavior is not necessarily
 goal-oriented and may be an expression of the com
 ponents of the self-concept that an individual seeks
 to validate in his or her work.

 Our finding pertaining to the moderating influ
 ence of traditionality on the relationship between
 delegation and the self-concept constructs of organ
 ization-based self-esteem and perceived insider sta
 tus is consistent with Erez and Earley's (1993) for
 mulations and the extant literature (Newman &
 Nollen, 1996). Specifically, our findings suggest
 traditionality as an individual cultural value orien
 tation that moderates the role of delegation in en
 hancing the two studied self-concept constructs. As
 previously noted, a key dimension of traditionality,
 respect for authority, is conceptually similar to
 power distance, which has been empirically shown
 to moderate the effectiveness of leader behavior/
 management practices that devolve work-related
 decision-making authority (Hui, Au, & Fock, 2004).
 Although employees from a high power distance
 culture such as China may not be considered recep
 tive to delegation, the results of the moderated re
 gression suggest that a focus on individual differ
 ence is more appropriate, especially when societal
 cultures are in transition. This is because individ
 ual difference cultural values better reflect the na

 al., 2002).

 Managerial Implications

 The results of our study have several managerial

 implications. First, the moderating role of the indi
 vidual cultural value orientation of traditionality
 has implications for improving the effectiveness of
 delegation. A prerequisite for effective delegation
 suggested by McConkey (1974: 100) is the willing
 ness of an employee to accept responsibility for the
 execution of duties assigned to him or her. To make
 delegation a more effective managerial behavior or

 practice, managers must identify individual cul
 tural values that moderate the influence of delega
 tion on employee self-concept. The moderating in
 fluence of traditionality suggests that delegation
 will be more effective with low-traditionality sub
 ordinates than with high-traditionality subordi
 nates. Perhaps because of the willingness of the
 former to accept responsibility for delegated tasks,
 delegation enhances self-concept for low-tradition
 ality subordinates, leading to the work outcomes.
 However, managers may enhance the willingness
 of high-traditionality subordinates to accept dele
 gated tasks through such psychological capital
 strategies as mastery experiences, vicarious learn

 ing, positive feedback, and social recognition
 (Luthans & Youseff, 2004). These practices will influ
 ence self-concept and, ultimately, work outcomes.
 Second, since cultural/individual values have been
 changing in China (Ralston, Egri, Stewart, Terpstra, &
 Yu, 1999), the new generation in China may become
 less traditional in the future. Thus, our finding that
 low-traditionality employees were receptive to dele
 gation because it enhanced self-concept and ulti
 mately work outcomes highlights the potential viabil
 ity of delegation in China. Finally, our findings of the
 mediating influence of the self-concept constructs
 suggest that organizations should sensitize supervi
 sors to the effects of their leadership practices on the
 self-concepts of subordinates. Accordingly, strategies
 that enhance subordinate self-concept should be in
 corporated into leadership training programs. Al
 though our results generally support the study's prop
 ositions, the generalizability of our findings to other
 cultural contexts remains an empirical question. In
 view of the popularity of management practices that
 devolve responsibility for certain work activities to
 subordinates, future research should replicate our
 findings using samples from different cultural
 contexts.

 Limitations

 The current study has a number of limitations that
 should be addressed in future research. First, the use
 of cross-sectional data implies that cause-effect rela
 tions cannot be inferred from our findings. For exam
 ple, it is intuitively plausible that organization-based
 self-esteem and perceived insider status influence
 delegation. This relationship might exist because su
 pervisors delegate to employees with histories of
 competence and to in-group members (Leana, 1986).
 Our findings are, however, consistent with the cul
 tural self-representation theory that underpinned our
 study. Second, even though we obtained data on the
 outcome variables of task performance and innova
 tive behavior from a separate source (i.e., supervi
 sors), the two attitudinal outcome variables (i.e., af
 fective commitment and job satisfaction) in the
 models were based on subordinates' self-reports. Al
 though results of the CFA demonstrated the distinc
 tiveness of the focal variables, it is unclear to what
 extent the results involving the work attitudes were
 attributable to method variance. Third, we measured
 delegation from the subordinates' perspective. Future
 research should obtain data on delegation from both
 supervisors and subordinates to more objectively
 measure the construct (Schriesheim et al., 1998).
 Fourth, it is unclear to what extent traditionality is
 meaningful in a Western context. Although the core
 element of traditionality is similar to power distance,

 these two constructs may not have similar moderat
 ing effects. Future research in a Chinese context
 should include both constructs as individual cultural
 value orientations, to empirically demonstrate their
 relevance as moderators in research on delegation
 work outcome relationships. A final limitation is that
 we did not include LMX in our study, even though
 we discussed delegation as a leader behavior and a
 defining characteristic of a high-quality leader-mem
 ber exchange. Future research should include LMX
 either as a moderator of the delegation-work outcome
 relationships (Schrieshiem et al., 1998) or as a control
 variable.

 Conclusion

 The findings of the current study suggest that the
 influence of delegation on employee work out
 comes is indirect, operating through enhancing the
 self-concept constructs of organization-based self
 esteem and perceived insider status. Because these
 aspects of self-concept motivate employees to be
 have in ways and/or hold attitudes that are consis
 tent with their positive self-images, they constitute
 more proximal antecedents of work outcomes than
 delegation. However, the influence of delegation on
 these self-concept constructs is contingent upon
 the individual cultural value orientation of tradi
 tionality. Delegation is more effective in enhancing
 the self-concept constructs of organization-based
 self-esteem and perceived insider status among in
 dividuals lower rather than higher in traditionality.
 From a managerial perspective, organizations and
 their managers should increase the sense of agency
 of employees high in traditionality if delegation is
 to enhance self-concept and ultimately improve or
 ganizational effectiveness for these employees.
