ABSTRACT
To date (mid-2004), the Reputation Quotient
(RQ) study has been carried out in 24 indivi-
dual countries. In early Spring 2004, however,
the ﬁrst attempt was made to apply the RQ in
a regional context. During May-June 2004,
RQ Scandinavia results were simultaneously
released in the three Scandinavian countries of
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Although
Denmark has carried out the RQ three times,
this was the ﬁrst
time Norway and Sweden
have used the instrument. The Scandinavian
countries are often seen and treated by busi-
nesses as one and the same. The inhabitants
and the culture are often seen as homogeneous
and this is supported by the fact that residents
from all three countries can normally converse
in and read each other’s native language. This
paper discusses the similarities and diﬀerences
that
the Scandinavian RQ research found in
Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The analysis
is based on the ﬁndings of the 15 most visible
companies in Sweden and Denmark and the 16
most visible companies in Norway. The analy-
sis shows many similarities, but also some sur-
prising diﬀerences. One of
the most obvious
similarities is that, parallel to other RQ stu-
dies, emotional appeal is also the most impor-
tant
for
Scandinavians. Further, the majority of visible

companies in the three Scandinavian countries
have a local heritage. Finally,
the general
public agrees on the importance of corporate
social responsibility (CSR) in all countries and
considers ‘treatment of employees’ and ‘treat-
ment of the environment’ as the most important
dimensions of CSR. This analysis also revealed
many diﬀerences. One of the most obvious con-
cerned the level of trust in each country. The
aggregated RQ average of all the Danish com-
panies was 74.2, the Norwegian average was
64.9 and the Swedish average was 60.7. The
aggregated average of the Top 5 in each coun-
try, however,
the Norwegian
results were the lowest on all six reputational
dimensions. The authors also found diﬀerences
between the countries in relation to how much
the companies should communicate about their
CSR activities. Danes are more reluctant than
Swedes and Norwegians on the subject of com-
panies communicating their good deeds.

RI global project has so far studied corpo-
rate reputations in Europe and the USA,
using the same methodology: the Harris-
Fombrun RQ.

In accordance with all other RQ coun-
try studies,
the Scandinavian RQ study
was carried out in two phases. In the ﬁrst
nomination phase, a representative sample
of respondents from the general public was
interviewed regarding their perceptions
about ﬁrms with the ‘best’ and ‘worst’
reputations in their home country. All the
nominations were open-ended and, from
the results, the researchers constructed a list
of
in each
country.

the most visible companies

In the second rating phase, respondents
were asked to give a detailed rating of two
of the visible companies with which they
were ‘very familiar’ or ‘somewhat famil-
iar’. The rating phase was done on the
internet in Sweden and on the telephone in
Denmark and Norway. In the rating phase,
in the spring of 2004, a total of 8,879
people
from the Scandinavian general
public rated the 46 most visible companies.
In total, 55 questions were measured in this
phase,
reputational
dimensions and the 20 RQ attributes. The
dimensions used were emotional appeal,
products & services, workplace environ-
ment, ﬁnancial performance, vision & lea-
dership and social responsibility (Fombrun
et al., 2000). The companies were each
rated on 20 attributes
in the six main
dimensions mentioned above.

Respondents were also asked general

Scandinavian

questions about corporate reputation, cor-
porate communication (the Expressiveness
Quotient) and corporate social responsibil-
ity (CSR). On average, each company was
rated by 250 respondents who had indi-
cated familiarity with the company. All
data were weighted to be representative of
the
population.
Weighting variables were demographic
variables (ie age, sex, education and house-
hold income). An RQ index was calculated
based on the respondents’ ratings of each
company on the 20 attributes
for each
company to determine the rankings. The
highest possible score was 100 and the
lowest score approximately 15. Each RQ
rating has an estimated sampling error of
+1.5. In comparing any two RQ scores, a
diﬀerence of 1.96 would be considered sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent at the 90 per cent conﬁ-
dence level. Data in the rating phase were
collected by MMI Univero in Norway, by
Vilstrup in Denmark and by Temo in
Sweden.

THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES
The Scandinavian countries have a number
of similar characteristics. All countries have
small populations: Norway *4 million,
Denmark *5 million and Sweden, with
*9 million inhabitants, has
the largest
population in the region. Many of
the
companies in the region have lately experi-
enced signiﬁcant changes in their business
environment as a result of national deregu-
lation and international restructuring, parti-
cularly the telecommunications
industry,

some public transport,
sector
and, in Norway, the oil sector. Both Den-
mark and Norway are dominated by small
and medium-sized companies (Schultz et
al., 2002), while the Swedish companies are
larger and more international. In a popula-
tion-based comparison with the EU and
the world, Sweden has the largest compa-
nies in the EU and comes out as number
three in the world after Switzerland and
Hong Kong.

According to Business Week’s

‘Global
1000’ (2004) survey, Sweden has 15 compa-
nies on the top 1,000 list of
the most
valued companies in the world, Norway
ﬁve and Denmark four. That Scandinavia
as a region is important is conﬁrmed by its
treatment in international marketing texts
and courses and that marketing research

often clusters the countries in studies of the
Scandinavian market. A quick internet
search resulted in more than 10,000 hits on
Scandinavian stereotypes and more than
170,000 on marketing and Scandinavia.

Overall Scandinavia RQ Analysis

Denmark
Denmark’s largest company, A.P. Møller-
Mærsk, operating primarily in shipping
and gas, moved from No. 3 in 2002, to
No. 2 in 2003 and ﬁnally to the No. 1
reputation rank with the highest score ever
in Denmark. The other top tier companies
are Danfoss, Grundfos, Bang & Olufsen
and Novo Nordisk. This represents a sig-
niﬁcant move forward for both Danfoss
and Grundfos compared with 2002. It is

particularly notable that Danfoss
is also
ranked as No. 1 in relation to both social

With the exception of Bang & Olufsen,
in Denmark are
the top tier companies
business-to-business manufacturing,
ship-
ping or pharmaceutical operations.

The reputation of
two years,

the winner of
the
previous
toy manufacturer
LEGO, has fallen back to a No. 6 position.
Although the company had a rather small
decline in its absolute RQ score (2.3) it
suﬀered from the general
increase in the
reputation level among almost all other
companies in the ranking. Thus, a major-
ity of companies have moved up the repu-
tation ladder with A.P. Møller-Mærsk
receiving a very high reputation standing
compared with previous years and com-
pared with the best RQ level
in other
countries (eg US winner Johnson & John-
son 2003 has an RQ of 79.5).

The Scandinavian benchmark highlights
the most remarkable overall
impression:
The level of corporate reputation has increased
in Denmark. The average RQ of the 15
most visible companies has increased from
69.3 in 2002 to 74.2 in 2004, which implies
that
the general public is expressing a
higher level of trust and admiration for
Danish companies than previous years —
particularly compared with their Scandina-
vian neighbors. All ﬁve top tier companies
have an absolute RQ beyond 80.0, which
is
remarkable compared with all other
countries using the RQ scale. The same
relatively high level of reputation is found

at the other end of the scale, where the
lowest RQ in Denmark is 63.4, compared
with Skandia in Sweden having an RQ of
34.0 — the same level as WorldCom in the
USA. In a year when echoes of severe cor-
porate scandals have generated a decline in
corporate reputation in many countries,
Denmark has so far not had any signiﬁcant
corporate scandals and this may be a main
reason behind the increase in the general
reputation level.

Norway
The reputation winner in Norway is Tine,
with a score of 75.0. Tine, a cooperative
dairy company that has a near monopoly
in this sector,
is one of the most well-
known brands in Norway and regularly
ranks positively among Norwegian consu-
mers in other rankings carried out in the
country. Tine scored highest on four of the
six reputational dimensions (see Table 3).
The exceptions were ﬁnancial performance
and vision & leadership, where they ranked
third, behind the second ranked company
Rema 1000. What is most surprising is that
Norwegians ranked a foreign ﬁrm, The
Coca-Cola Company, highest on these two
dimensions. The soft drinks ﬁrm received
the highest dimension scores of any other
ﬁrm,
including Tine. Furthermore, The
Coca-Cola Company is the sole non-Nor-
wegian ﬁrm among the country’s 16 most
visible ﬁrms. Norwegians’ admiration of a
US ﬁrm for its vision and leadership is see-
mingly an interesting paradox that should
provide food for thought for managers,

given recent press coverage on the negative
inﬂuence of American culture on Norwe-
gian diets (Brønn, 2004).

Norwegians also stand out with respect
to trusting companies, ie in general, they
rank companies low on trust. Tine, the top
ranked ﬁrm overall, was also the top
ranked when it comes to trust. But only 40
per cent said they would trust the ﬁrm in

the event of a product/service problem,
followed by 27 per cent for the second
ranked ﬁrm.

Since this is the ﬁrst year in which the
in
RQ survey has been carried out
Norway,
it is not possible to establish a
pattern of behavior for these ﬁrms. It is
seen that the highest ranking Norwegian
ﬁrm had a score of 75.0, with the second

lower than the highest ranked Danish ﬁrm,
which had a score of 84.4, but Norway is
not too far from Sweden, whose highest

Norway. The lowest ranked Norwegian

Norway and Sweden’s scores are in fact
comparable with the top ranking RQ
ﬁrms in the USA, for 2003. It should be
noted, however, that the USA has seen a
drop in overall scores, probably due to an
increasing distrust of businesses as a result
of scandals in that country.

Sweden
The internationally well-known furniture
retailer IKEA achieved the highest score in
Sweden. IKEA was a clear winner in ﬁve
of the six dimensions. On the products &
services dimension,

munications company, Nokia.

The majority of

the 15 most visible
companies in Sweden market their pro-
ducts/services towards consumers. All com-
panies, with the exception of Microsoft
and McDonald’s from the USA and Nokia
from Finland, have
local heritage.
Sweden was the only country where two
international companies, Nokia and Micro-
soft, were rated in the top tier. This could
mean that the Swedish general public is
more open to international companies than
their neighboring countries. The car manu-
facturers Volvo and Saab both received
relatively high ratings (fourth and sixth,
respectively). Even though they are now
part of Ford and General Motors they have
a strong reputation that is partly based on
their Swedish origins. The question arises,
however, given the seeming openness of
Swedes to international ﬁrms, whether the
national association of Volvo and Saab will
become less important.

In comparison with its neighbors, the
averages of Sweden’s 15 most visible com-
panies were much lower than in Norway
and Denmark. There are at least three pos-
sible reasons for this low result. The ﬁrst
reason, and an important one, is the man-
agement scandal with Skandia that started
in the autumn of 2003, resulting in this
company’s extremely low RQ of 34.0. The

Page 224

second reason concerns ABB and Ericsson.
Both of these companies have been in poor
ﬁnancial condition and they barely sur-
vived their crises. ABB also received a lot
of bad press due to another scandal with
the former management. A third reason is
that the old state-owned monopolies, Telia
Sonera, Systembolaget, SJ and Posten, have
had a diﬃcult time building a strong repu-
tation among the general public. The alco-
hol retailer Systembolaget was involved in
a corporate scandal due to bribery at the
retail outlet level. All of this has had a
negative impact on companies in Sweden.
The aggregated average of
the Top 5,
however, showed that the Swedish results
were better than the Norwegian results in
all six reputational dimensions. The Danish
results were the best in Scandinavia on all
dimensions.

than their counterparts

Comparison of Countries
As noted above, the ratings of the top tier
in Sweden and Norway are
companies
much lower
in
Denmark. The Swedish top tier companies:
IKEA, Nokia and Microsoft have RQs in
the range between 79.3–74.2. The two
Norwegian top tier companies, Tine and
Rema 1000, have RQs of 75.0 and 72.2,
respectively. The Danish top tier consists of
ﬁve companies that have RQs above 80.0,
which is quite impressive. The Danish top
tier companies are all in the range between
84.4–80.4. In Denmark there are 11 com-
panies with an RQ over 70.0.

One clear pattern found for the three
countries was the nomination of food retai-
lers (ICA in Sweden, Coop in Sweden,
Denmark and Norway, Dansk Super-
marked and the Norwegian Rema 1000),
but also other
forms of retailing with
direct consumer relations such as fast food
(McDonald’s both in Sweden and in Den-
mark), furniture (IKEA), ﬁnancial services
(Danske Bank and Den Norske Bank),
alcohol retailing (Systembolaget) and post-


services (in both Sweden and Norway).
One characteristic for Norway was
the
nomination of their large national oil com-
panies,
ie the Norwegian petrol retailers
Hydro and Statoil.

A comparison of the nominated compa-
nies in the three countries shows that the
majority are ﬁrms with a national heritage,
although current ownership may be much
more international. Similar
results have
been found in other European countries
measured with the RQ. Only ﬁve nomi-
nated companies from a total of 46 have
clear international ownership; four of them
are US ﬁrms. In Sweden there are three
companies, Microsoft
international
and
McDonald’s
from the USA and Nokia
from Finland. In Denmark there is only
McDonald’s and in Norway only The
Coca-Cola Company. Microsoft’s high
rating in Sweden was surprising since the
company had an ambiguous reputation in
the Swedish nomination phase where it
received an almost equal number of nomi-
nations for ‘best’ and ‘worst’ reputation. A
similar ﬁnding for companies with ambig-
uous reputations was also discovered in a
US nomination study (Gardberg and Fom-
brun, 2002).

of

Telia

Sonera

A clear pattern found was that state-
owned or former state-owned companies
tend to have low RQs in all three coun-
tries. In Sweden, the state-owned compa-
nies
(telecom),
Systembolaget (alcohol retailing), SJ (rail-
way) and Posten (mail) had very low RQs
in the range between 56.4–40.4. Among
the 15 nominees,
the four current or
former state-owned companies were found
at position 11–14. Only Skandia had a
worse reputation in Sweden. The RQs of
the four Norwegian state-owned or former
state-owned companies were: Telenor (tel-
ecom) 65.4, Posten (mail) 60.1, SAS (air-
line) 55.0 and NSB (railway) 54.8; ranking
them at 9, 14, 15 and 16, respectively. The
RQs of the three Danish state-owned or

former state-owned companies were: TDC
(telecom) 67.7, SAS (state-owned by all
three countries) 65.9 and DSB (railway)
65.2, ranking them at 12–14, respectively.

It appears that in Scandinavia there is a
real reputation challenge for current or
former state-owned ﬁrms, which is more
than supported by their poor performance
on the RQ. Part of the reason for this in
Norway and Sweden at least is the mono-
polistic behavior of many of these ﬁrms.
This is a recurring theme in the media for
Telenor and Telia Sonera. Tine, the RQ
leader in Norway, while never a state-
owned organization, has
also received
negative press coverage for its monopolis-
tic-like behavior. Posten in Norway is
investing large sums in corporate branding
activities in an attempt to change its image
to one that
is more consumer friendly.
Posten and SJ in Sweden also score very
low on customer service. Many people in
Sweden have also lost a lot of money in
Telia Sonera, since they invested in stock
when it became a publicly owned com-
pany.

Obviously, there is now a trend toward
a more deregulated market in Scandinavia,
where many of the countries have been
characterized as
social democracies and
where the state (particularly in Norway
and Sweden) has been a primary owner of
a number of very large businesses, which
are now increasingly exposed to a more
competitive business environment.

The Importance of Emotional Appeal
It is clear from Figure 4 that emotional
appeal has
impact on the
overall reputation of a company in all
three countries. This is also the dimension
on which the general public feels it knows
most about companies. While Danes and
Norwegians ﬁnd emotional appeal nearly

between Denmark and Norway, Swedes
rank them in a diﬀerent order. While both
Norwegians and Danes ﬁnd workplace

Arguably, there is little diﬀerence between
the weightings on a few of these dimen-
sions, but at least one is noteworthy, that
of CSR.

more important than the Norwegians or
Danes
respectively). A
further analysis of this dimension indicates
that the concept of CSR in Scandinavia at
least is something that needs deeper investi-
gation.

In all three Scandinavian countries, over
90 per cent of the public indicated that
companies should take social responsibility.
Fewer Swedes than Norwegians and Danes,
however, believe that companies
should
have a broad social responsibility, ie that
they have a responsibility to shareholders,
employees and customers plus a broad
social responsibility. Some 20 per cent of
the Swedish general public want their com-
panies to have a broad social responsibility,
versus 31 per cent of the Norwegian and
almost half (48 per cent) of the Danish
population, who want their companies to
have a broad social responsibility. All Scan-
dinavian countries, however, believe that
companies have a responsibility primarily
to shareholders, employees and customers.
But, again, Sweden diﬀerentiates itself from
the others. Three-quarters of the Swedish
general public supported this in comparison
with 60 per cent of Norwegians and 48 per
cent of Danes.

As noted above CSR was an important
dimension in all countries for reputation,
with some diﬀerences between countries.
As regards corporate citizenship, however,
Swedes, Norwegians and Danes all agree
that treatment of employees is most impor-

tant to CSR and the most essential aspect
to a company’s engagement in CSR activ-
ities. Other aspects of
importance, on
which there was little diﬀerence between
the countries were: treatment of the envir-
onment, risk associated with using a pro-
duct, ethics in marketing (more important
to Norwegians), involvement in the local
community and charitable and other good
causes (see Figure 5 for more information).
Regarding the issue of what aspect of
CSR is most essential to corporate citizen-
ship (the respondent had to choose one of
the activities shown in Figure 5), the coun-
tries were in relatively close agreement on
the most important: treatment of employ-
ees. In Denmark and Norway, the second
most essential was treatment of the envir-
onment. In Sweden, this activity was third
(23 per cent) after risk associated with
using a product (24 per cent). There appear
to be large diﬀerences in opinion on the
other aspects, however. Norwegians clearly
ﬁnd ethics in marketing to be more impor-
tant and essential
than both Danes and
Swedes (only 2 per cent of Swedes found it
essential versus 15 per cent of Norwegians).
Similarly, only 12 per cent of Norwegians
found risk associated with using a product
essential for corporate citizenship versus 24
per cent of Swedes. Norwegians (8 per
cent) also found involvement in the local
community more essential than Swedes (3
per cent).

Another important ﬁnding had to do

Page 228


with the question of whether or not com-
panies should publicize their good deeds.
The results showed that the number of
people who believed that corporations
should not publicize their good deeds was
noticeably higher
in Denmark than in
Sweden and Norway. Only 5 per cent of
Swedes and 10 per cent of Norwegians do
not want their companies to publicize their
good deeds. In Denmark, however, 21 per
cent of the population do not want their
company to go public with their CSR
activities. Furthermore, 50 per cent of the
general public in Sweden and Norway
believe it is acceptable to publicize CSR
activities
through advertising and public
relations versus 33 per cent in Denmark. A
word of caution is necessary, however, as
the numbers are relatively high in all three
countries of people who believe CSR
activities should only be publicized mini-
mally through such media as press releases,
annual reports and websites.

CSR is the dimension about which the
general public in all countries ﬁnds it the
most diﬃcult to answer questions. People
do not know whether or not companies
support good causes. In Sweden and Den-
mark, the average of ‘not sure’ responses
for this question was 33 per cent and in
Norway 31 per cent.

Communicating Reputation
The familiarity of almost all companies
measured was very high in Scandinavia.
The research demonstrates that high visibi-
lity and familiarity are necessary for a
strong reputation — but visibility alone is
not enough. It is what a ﬁrm is known for
that decides whether the general public
perceives it positively or negatively.

There was a high correlation between
ﬁve elements of corporate communication
as deﬁned by Fombrun and van Riel
(2004) and a ﬁrm’s overall reputation. The
better a company expresses itself on the
ﬁve corporate communication dimensions,

visibility

consistency,

the more likely it will help the company to
build a strong reputation. The ﬁve ele-
ments are: sincerity/authenticity, transpar-
ency,
and
distinctiveness. The dimensions are referred
to as the Roots of Fame and the Expres-
siveness Quotient (Fombrun and van Riel,
2004; Schultz et al., 2000). The most
important communication dimension was
‘sincerity’, where a high correlation can be
seen between the perception of the com-
munication and the overall
reputation.
Swedes found ‘transparency’ more impor-
tant
than Norwegians and Danes. One
explanation for this result is that the man-
agement scandal with the insurance com-
pany Skandia never seemed to come to an
end in the media because the company
never showed suﬃcient transparency. This
scandal has made Swedes more aware of
the importance of this dimension and they
are now seeking it from Swedish compa-
nies. Norwegian and Danish ﬁrms would
be well advised to take a proactive stance
on this element.

value a relationship with their organiza-

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The
reputation
survey is exciting for a number of reasons.
For one thing, it adds a new dimension to
the RQ. A recent issue of Newsweek con-
cludes
set an
example for the world (July 2004). Do
Scandinavians in fact view the world in a
diﬀerent
(and better) way? The authors
took three seemingly similar countries and
were able to conclude that their popula-
tions diﬀer on how they view ﬁrms in
some key areas. But they also concluded
that, irrespectively, Scandinavians hold the
same things important as other countries

Most importantly, however, is the reali-

While Danish companies appear to be
improving on building trust with their
constituencies, the Norwegians and Swedes
have some way to go. The research here
shows that the process must start internally.
The most important dimension for respon-

images of a ﬁrm was emotional
appeal and, while products & services was
the most important driver of this dimen-
sion, workplace environment and CSR
were also seen as central. Furthermore, the
general public considered treatment of
employees to be the most important activ-
ity of CSR. This was supplemented with
the fact that the most signiﬁcant communi-
cation dimension was sincerity. Firms have
to ‘walk the talk’. This supports the con-
