ABSTRACT 

Customer participation in the new product development (NPD) process is becoming more 

common. Involving customers in the NPD process has been widely considered to enhance 

market adoption of co-created products and speed up time to market. However, several potential 

risks relevant to coordination among co-production activities have been raised in recent studies. 

Drawing on coordination theory, this dissertation examines the conditions under which 

customer participation in the NPD process improves or deteriorates new product success. The 

specific focus is on non-linear relationships between customer participation and market adoption 

and time to market. Furthermore, this dissertation investigates the differential effects on market 

adoption and time to market of when customers are engaged, the breadth of customer 

participation, NPD teams’ capability to leverage customer insights, product individuality, and 

price positioning strategy of co-produced products. 

In Study 1, the hypotheses were tested using data from 647 NPD projects from 

SourceForge.net, a leading open source software development repository in which end users are 

involved in developing new software. To test generalizability of the results, Study 2 investigated 

the same hypotheses based on survey data from 159 NPD managers who have worked on NPD 

projects in which customers have been involved to some extent to co-create new products. 

The results of Study 1 show that customer participation enhances market adoption up to a 

certain point but degrades it beyond that point. Furthermore, the inverted U-shaped relationship 

between customer participation and market adoption is moderated by breadth of customer 

participation and the NPD team’s co-production capability. With regard to time to market, the

findings of Study 1 demonstrate that customer participation continuously slows time to market, 

confirming serious risks of customer participation. Although the curvilinear relationship found in 

Study 1 is not extended to various industries of Study 2, the results of Study 2 still indicate that 

the relationship between customer participation and market adoption is moderated by the timing 

and breadth of customer participation, and product individuality. The findings highlight a close 

analysis of benefits and costs of customer participation and provide insights into how and when 

customers should be engaged in the NPD process.

CHAPTER 1 

INTRODUCTION 

Customer participation in the new product development (NPD) process has become 

common. More than 120,000 customers around the world served as voluntary members of 

Boeing’s World Design Team and contributed ideas and input regarding the design of its new 

787 Dreamliner airplane (O’Hern and Rindfleisch 2009). Each week, Threadless.com, a 

Chicago-based fashion start-up, markets new T-shirt designs created and chosen by end 

customers (Fuchs, Prandelli, and Schreier 2010). P&G’s Connect + Develop program enables 

customers to submit their ideas for new product offerings or for P&G’s specific needs and offers 

rewards for the selected ideas. Bounce, P&G’s dryer sheets, was introduced through P&G’s 

Connect + Develop program (O’Hern 2009). In the open source software development process, 

end customers are eagerly involved in developing, improving, and testing new software 

programs. Linux and Firefox are successful products that resulted from customer participation in 

the open source software context. 

Academic researchers have noticed the benefits of this new approach in the value 

creation process. Companies which have traditionally managed new product development or 

innovation as an internal process based on their own skills and capabilities began to open their 

value creation processes to outside members including end customers and suppliers. Chesbrough 

(2003) named this approach “open innovation.” Drawing on service-dominant logic developed 

by Vargo and Lusch (2004), researchers in marketing have also focused on customers’ 

contributions in the NPD process (e.g., Alam 2002; Hoyer et al. 2010; O’Hern 2009). 

 

1 


 

 
Researchers and managers alike have recognized the value creation approach via customer 

participation as a viable alternative to create new products and have emphasized the benefits 

(O’Hern and Rindfleisch 2009; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Vargo and Lusch 2004). For 

instance, involving customers in the NPD process enables NPD teams to more closely mirror 

customer needs and find ways to solve these needs, which in turn increases market acceptance of 

co-produced products (Enkel, Perez-Freije, and Gassmann 2005; Ernst et al. 2011; Nambisan 

2002). Furthermore, because customer participation helps identify and correct need-related 

problems of products early in the NPD process and customers take charge of certain portions of 

the development process as co-developers, the time that elapses until the product is launched in 

the market may be decreased (Alam 2002; O’Hern and Rindfleisch 2009; von Hippel and Katz 

2002).  

 

However, customer participation in the NPD process does not come without costs (e.g., 

Fang 2008; Hoyer et al. 2010). Customer participation in the NPD process may diminish the 

company’s control and increase the complexity of the NPD process (Hoyer et al. 2010). 

Increasing customer input can potentially overload the process, causing confusion, coordination 

problems, and duplication of effort (Datar et al. 1996; Sethi 2000). Malone and Crowston (1994) 

and Heath and Staudenmayer (2000) pointed out difficulties in integrating and coordinating 

interdependent work between firms and customers in the value co-production process.  

Despite these potential costs of customer participation, there has been little research on 

conditions under which customer participation deteriorates new product success. The conflicting 

arguments regarding customer participation suggest that it may not always lead to greater market 

adoption or result in shorter time to market and that these effects might hinge on certain 

additional conditions. Thus, the objective of this dissertation is to examine the conditions under 

 

2 


 
which customer participation in the NPD process enhances or deteriorates market adoption, time 

to market, or both. More formally, the basic research question relates to whether there are 

 

nonlinear relationships between the level of customer participation and market adoption and time 

to market. Customer participation may improve market adoption and speed up the development 

process to a certain point, but deteriorate them beyond that point.  

Furthermore, this dissertation addresses three contextual variables related to how 

companies implement customer participation in the NPD process and two contextual variables 

related to product-specific characteristics. First, the timing of when companies engage customers 

in the NPD process might affect the effects of customer participation on new product success. 

According to Gruner and Homburg (2000) and Hoyer et al. (2010), customers’ main role and 

their contributions at different NPD stages vary. For example, customer participation in early 

NPD phases such as ideation and concept development versus in later NPD phases such as 

product testing may improve market adoption but delay time to market. Second, it is likely that 

the effects of customer participation depend on the breadth of customer participation in the NPD 

process. For instance, customer participation in a wide range of activities versus customer 

participation in just one activity may enhance market adoption but hinder quick launch. Third, 

the effectiveness of customer participation is expected to be contingent on the NPD team’s co-

production capability. NPD teams which have a high level of ability to effectively leverage 

insights from customer participation might not only improve market adoption but also accelerate 

time to market.  

In addition to contextual variables related to customer participation execution, the 

impacts of customer participation may vary depending on product and market characteristics. 

The effects of customer participation on market adoption may be more valued in markets in 

 

3 


 

 
which highly individualized products are offered or product price is relatively high. This is 

because reflecting customer’s needs through customer participation is more important in these 

markets (Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann 2011). Therefore, the dissertation tests whether the 

effects of customer participation on market adoption hinge on two product-specific 

characteristics (i.e., product individuality and product price positioning).  

The research questions are examined with two different samples. In Study 1, the 

nonlinear relationships and three potential moderating effects related to customer participation 

implementation are tested using archival data from SourceForge.net, a website created to manage 

a wide variety of open source software development projects. This is an appropriate context to 

test the research questions because open source software development projects on the web offer 

the opportunity for customers to participate by suggesting new features, reporting bugs, 

developing patches, and so on. However, the findings in one specific context (i.e., open source 

software development) may not necessarily be generalized to other contexts due to market and 

product characteristics of software. Study 2 is conducted in an attempt to validate the findings of 

the first study and assess the potential moderating impacts of industry and product 

characteristics. Survey data are collected from NPD managers who have worked on NPD 

projects in which end customers have been involved to some extent. The survey sample includes 

a variety of industries which show different levels of product individuality and price positioning. 

Contributions of the Dissertation 

The findings of these studies are expected to make several theoretical contributions. First 

and foremost, by integrating coordination theory with service-dominant logic, a theoretical 

explanation can be provided of the conditions under which customer participation enhances or 

deteriorates new product outcomes. Research on customer participation to date has focused on 

 

4 


 
showing desirable outcomes of customer participation within service-dominant logic. However, 

 

service-dominant logic may not explain the whole story of how the effects of customer 

participation on new product success hinge on additional circumstances. The concept of 

coordination neglect suggested by Heath and Staudenmayer (2000) and the coordination theory 

developed by Malone and Crowston (1994) bridge the gap by identifying psychological barriers 

that get in the way of integrating individual work into a common goal and coordination problems 

that occur when coordination mechanisms do not work well. 

Second, the findings highlight the importance of a NPD team’s co-production capability. 

Previous literature on co-production has primarily placed emphasis on how to engage customers 

in more co-production activities. Thus, much attention has been paid to building various places 

such as online communities for active customer participation and promoting interactions and 

collaboration between customers and organizations (Ballantyne and Varey 2006; Ramani and 

Kumar 2008). However, merely involving customers in more co-production activities is not 

enough to generate positive effects of customer participation. There has been a growing 

emphasis on reflecting and leveraging input arising from customer participation (Bendapudi and 

Leone 2003; Fuchs, Prandelli, and Schreier 2010). This dissertation bridges the gap by proposing 

a new construct which captures a NPD team’s co-production capability to leverage customers’ 

input and empirically testing the moderating effect of the NPD team’s co-production capability. 

The findings of Study 1 confirm that companies with a high level of co-production capability can 

obtain more benefits from customer participation without costs. 

Third, the dissertation shifts the boundaries of customer participation from Business to 

Business (B2B) to Business to Customer (B2C). Previous studies of customer participation in the 

NPD process have been conducted in the B2B context, specifically focusing on co-production 

 

5 


 

 
between manufacturers and suppliers (Hoyer et al. 2010; O’Hern 2009). However, as shown in 

the cases of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, Threadless, and open source software development 

projects, end customers are increasingly involved in various parts of the NPD process. In 

addition, end customers’ participation may differ from suppliers’ involvement in NPD in that 

suppliers are relatively limited in terms of numbers and have extensive knowledge about 

particular NPD projects compared with end customers. Therefore, efficient coordination, 

reducing complexity, and maximizing the benefits of divergent ideas might play more important 

roles in co-production with end customers. The results of this dissertation shed light on the 

benefits and risks of end customers’ participation in the NPD process.  

These results also provide managerial implications into how customer participation in the 

NPD process should be implemented and in which markets companies should engage customers 

in the NPD process. First, the dissertation sounds a warning to organizations which have jumped 

on the bandwagon of co-production without a close analysis of the benefits and costs of customer 

participation. The inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and market 

adoption and continuous increase in time to market found in Study 1 imply that managers need to 

take into account the trade-off between benefits and costs of customer participation. Because the 

costs of customer participation on new product success are greater especially in technology-

driven industries such as IT and software development, managers need to seriously consider how 

to engage customers. 

Second, the findings provide insights into questions of how customers should be engaged 

in NPD. In particular, the findings from both studies show a strong moderating impact of breadth 

in the relationship between customer participation and new product success. As the breadth of 

customer participation increases, the positive impact of customer participation on market 

 

6 


 

 
adoption increases. In contrast, broad customer participation lengthens time to market more than 

narrow customer participation. The result demonstrates that there is a trade-off among the two 

different measures of new product success. Broad customer participation contributes to 

improving market adoption but is detrimental to time to market. Thus, when companies decide 

how broadly customers are involved in the NPD process, they need to consider their goal. When 

the goal of a NPD team is to develop a new product which reflects well customers’ needs at the 

cost of time to market, a NPD team needs to engage customers broadly. In industries that 

emphasize fast launch of new products due to short product life cycle time and heightened 

competition (Chen, Damanpour, and Reilly 2010), NPD teams could see better benefits by 

engaging customers narrowly.  

Third, the results suggest that the effects of customer participation on market adoption 

vary depending on the level of product individuality. As shown in Study 2, in markets where 

individualized products are offered to customers, customer participation improves market 

adoption, whereas in markets whose products are less individualized, the impact of customer 

participation on market adoption is immaterial. The results imply that managers need to take into 

account product characteristics as well when engaging customers in their NPD process.   

Finally, the findings from the two complementary samples indicate that the impact of 

customer participation can depend on industry characteristics. Overall, the results from Studies 1 

and 2 show that the costs of customer participation are greater in technology-driven industries 

such as software development. Ordinary customers may lack the technical expertise and 

experience required in the technology-driven NPD process. Thus, end customers’ participation in 

technology-intensive product development may increase complexity but not provide insights 

good enough to be accepted by companies.

Organization of the Dissertation 

 

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the topic area, contributions of the study, and 

overall organization of the dissertation. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on co-production, 

customer participation, and customers’ roles in the NPD process and new product success as well 

as the theoretical foundations of service-dominant logic and coordination theory. Chapter 3 

develops the hypotheses and offers logical arguments behind them. The hypotheses are tested 

using two types of data: archival data from SourceForge.net and survey data from NPD 

managers. Chapter 4 provides a description of Study 1, including how focal constructs are 

measured and analyzed using archival data from SourceForge.net. The results using data from 

SourceForge.net are described and discussed. Chapter 5 offers a description of Study 2 and 

outlines the measures and analysis method using survey data. The findings based on survey data 

from NPD managers are given and discussed. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes main findings from 

both studies and provides theoretical and managerial implications. Limitations of the dissertation 

are discussed and new venues for future research are described.

CHAPTER 2 

LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 

Co-Production in New Product Development 

Traditional marketing thought and practice largely view value creation as an internal, 

 

 

‐

firm

based process in which end customers are relatively passive buyers and consumers (O’Hern 

and Rindfleisch 2009; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Vargo and Lusch 2004). In the 

conventional value creation process, firms and customers had distinct roles of production and 

consumption, with firms regarded as the only subjects to generate value for customers (Prahalad 

and Ramaswamy 2004). However, this traditional paradigm is currently being challenged by a 

‐

new perspective in which customers are viewed as active co

creators of the value they buy and 

use. Value is not generated for customers but jointly created with customers (Restuccia 2009). In 

a similar vein, Payne, Storbacka, and Frow (2008) contend that firms are being asked to change 

their production logic from Inside-Out (making, selling and serving) to Outside-In (listening and 

co-creating).  

Against this backdrop, companies are increasingly encouraging direct involvement of end 

customers and high-quality interaction between firms and end customers in the NPD process to 

co-create value (Restuccia 2009). Boeing’s Dreamliner jet, Threadless.com’s T-shirts, and 

P&G’s Connect + Develop program, to name a few, are good examples of how companies 

engage end customers in the NPD process. In this dissertation, co-production in NPD is defined 

as collaborative new product development activity that actively engages end customers in the 

NPD process (O’Hern 2009). Co-production in NPD could involve end customers providing new 

 

9 


 
product ideas or new features, participating in designing new products, engineering new products, 

 

testing new products before launch, and commercializing new products. 

In the basic definition, co-creation refers to collaborative behaviors when customers and 

firms are intimately involved in jointly creating value (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004). In the 

literature, the terms co-creation and co-production are sometimes used interchangeably, or the 

concept of co-creation sometimes involves the idea of co-production. However, several 

researchers distinguish co-production from co-creation (e.g., Etgar 2008; Lusch and Vargo 2006; 

Saxena 2010). Lusch and Vargo (2006) define co-creation as all cooperative activities between 

consumers and firms in the usage or consumption stage, whereas co-production is defined as all 

cooperative activities between consumers and firms in the production process of the core 

offering itself, which precedes the usage stage. To clarify the phenomenon, end customers’ 

active participation in the development stage of a core offering will be referred to as co-

production rather than co-creation throughout the dissertation.   

The emphasis on interaction and dialogue between companies and customers is not new. 

Ideas related to marketing concept, market orientation, and customer orientation have echoed the 

importance of interaction (e.g., Deshpandé, Farley, and Webster 1993; Jarworski and Kohli 

1993; Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Narver and Slater 1990). However, co-production is neither 

market orientation nor a (mass) customization of products and services (Franke, Keinz, and 

Steger 2009; Franke, Schreier, and Kaiser 2010; Prahalad and Ramazwamy 2004). In addition, 

co-production in the NPD process is different from conventional market research in which 

customers’ needs are examined through various research tools such as customer focus groups, 

direct observation of product use, and interviews with end customers.

First, co-production in the NPD process emphasizes the creative act itself; customers are 

actively engaged in designing and developing new product improvements. Market orientation 

and traditional marketing research methods focus on obtaining information from customers by 

either soliciting their reactions to new product concepts or gathering their ideas and insights 

(Aaker 1995). Co-production activities, in contrast, require that customers not only engage in a 

process of ideation but also devote substantial energy to the actual creation of new product 

solutions (O’Hern 2009). The other important feature which distinguishes co-production from 

traditional company-customer interaction is customers’ autonomy or empowerment (Piller, Ihl, 

and Vossen 2010). According to Ramani and Kumar (2008), customers’ empowerment refers to 

giving customers a voice in–and an opportunity to change–a company’s general offerings. 

Although each NPD project grants different degrees of freedom to customers in the NPD process, 

end customers in the co-production process have some autonomy to influence new products. In a 

nutshell, co-production in the NPD process is collaborative new product development activity 

beyond conventional customer participation in the process of ideation in which empowered 

customers are actively involved in the actual production of new offerings.  

Customer Participation 

Customer participation refers to the extent to which customers are involved in the NPD 

process (Fang 2008; Gruner and Homburg 2000). In the co-production context, the terms 

customer involvement (e.g., Carbonell, Rodriguez-Escudero, and Pujari 2009; Magnusson, 

Matthing, and Kristensson 2003), customer integration (e.g., Enkel, Perez-Freije, and Gassmann 

2005; Moeller 2008), customer interaction (e.g., Alam 2006; Gruner and Homburg 2000), and 

customer empowerment (e.g., Fuchs, Prandelli, and Schreier 2010; Ramani and Kumar 2008)

Even though considerable research has been conducted on customer participation in a 

 

 

 

business-to-business context, the existing literature still falls short of offering a clear 

conceptualization of customer participation because customer participation occurs in many forms 

and degrees (Fang 2004; Meuter and Bitner 1998). For example, Chan, Yim, and Lam (2010) 

view customer participation as a behavioral construct to measure the extent to which customers 

provide or share information, make suggestions, and become involved in decision making. In 

other words, they assess the degree of customer participation in terms of amount of information 

provision. This definition of customer participation reflects the perspective that customers in co-

 

13 


 

 
production activities are an information resource (Fang 2008; Nambisan 2002). Claycomb, 

Lengnick-Hall, and Inks (2001) and Hsieh, Yen, and Chin (2004) also note that information 

provision is an important dimension of customer participation.  

In contrast, Gruner and Homburg (2000) and Carbonell, Rodriguez-Escudero, and Pujari 

(2009) place more emphasis on intensity of actual interaction between customers and a 

company. The number of involved customers, the duration, and the frequency of interaction are 

main components to capture customer participation. Combining these two dominant ways to 

assess the degree of customer participation in the value co-creation process, I define customer 

participation in the NPD process with two dimensions: amount of information provided by end 

customers and intensity of actual interaction between end customers and a company. In a similar 

vein, Sheng (2009) recently measured customer participation using the amount of information 

that a customer provided, the amount of time that a customer spent, and the extent of effort and 

work that a customer contributed. 

Customer Roles in the NPD Process 

 

Recently, customer participation has been regarded as a new source of a firm’s 

competitive advantage and a differentiator in the future (e.g., Bendapudi and Leone 2003; 

Ramani and Kumar 2008). In most cases, researchers have examined the merits of active 

customer participation in the NPD process (Sheng 2009). In particular, the benefits that 

companies can obtain from customer participation have been explained by two distinct roles of 

customers in the NPD process: information providers and co-developers (e.g., Lengnick-Hall 

1996; Fang 2008; Nambisan 2002).  

The former involves activities such as sharing information on customers’ needs or new 

product ideas with the NPD team. As an ultimate target which should be satisfied by a firm, end 

 

14 


 
customers can supply accurate and diverse information on their needs to NPD teams. Thus, from 

a firm’s perspective, end customers are an excellent source of useful information that should be 

integrated in the NPD process. The role of co-developers refers to the extent to which end 

customers play a pivotal role in developing a significant portion of the development tasks. The 

 

role of co-developers ranges from product design activities to product engineering activities 

(Nambisan 2002). For example, in the software industry, enterprise software developers like 

Microsoft and SAP often have representatives from customers as members of their product 

development teams (Hoch, Roeding, and Lindner 1999). Because end customers may have 

valuable developmental technology or skills that NPD teams do not hold in house, firms need to 

integrate their development technology or skills by engaging customers as co-developers in the 

NPD process. As a result of this integration, NPD teams may enhance new product success. 

Table 2.2 summarizes the main roles of customers in the NPD process.

New Product Success 

New product success is a multifaceted concept (Campbell and Cooper 1999; Griffin and 

 

Page 1993; see Cooper 1979 and Griffin and Page 1993 for various dimensions of new product 

success). Griffin and Page (1993) identified various measures of new product success. 

Combining their literature review on measures of new product success with the results of surveys 

from companies, they classified measures of new product success into five dimensions: (1) firm-

level measures such as percentage of sales by new products; (2) program-level measures; (3) 

product-level measures including speed to market, product quality, and development cost; (4) 

measures of financial performance such as new product’s profitability; and (5) measures of 

customer acceptance such as customer satisfaction.  

More recent contributors provide broader categorization. Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 

(2001) argue that new product success can be evaluated by operational and market perspectives. 

Operational outcomes emphasize project work execution, or how effectively and efficiently a 

NPD project is implemented. They typically assess time to market, development cost, and 

product quality from an internal perspective (Carbonell, Rodriguez-Escudero, and Pujari 2009; 

Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 2001). In contrast, market outcomes reflect how well customers 

in the market accept the new product and how much financial success companies can achieve 

through the new product. In comparison to operational outcomes, market outcome measures 

assess the development effort from an external perspective (Carbonell, Rodriguez-Escudero, and 

Pujari 2009; Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 2001). Following Tatikonda and Montoya-Weiss 

(2001), new product success is assessed in this study from both operational and market 

perspectives. Time to market, defined as the time elapsed between the initial development and 

the ultimate introduction of a product into the marketplace (Griffin 1997), will be included in an 

 

16 


 
attempt to evaluate the efficiency of project execution. In addition, market adoption, defined as 

the extent to which customers buy the new product (O’Hern 2009), will be utilized to measure 

market outcomes for the new product. Table 2.3 summarizes dimensions of new product success 

 

in the literature.

Service-Dominant Logic 

The service-dominant logic of marketing provides a foundation for value co-creation 

between customers and NPD teams (Vargo and Lusch 2004). This logic has evolved from the 

ideas of academics who argue for recognition of the customer’s active role in the value creation 

process (e.g., Lusch, Brown, and Brunswick 1992; Normann and Ramirez 1993; Prahalad and 

Ramaswamy 2000). This perspective basically emphasizes the inherent collaborative nature 

among all of the actors in the value creation process (Lusch and Vargo 2006; Vargo 2008; Vargo 

and Lusch 2008). These are jointly captured in the contentions that “the customer is always a co-

creator of value” and “all social and economic actors are resource integrators” in the revised 

foundational premises of service-dominant logic (Vargo and Lusch 2008, p. 7). Since no entity 

 

17 


 

 
has the expertise or relative advantage in terms of competence to perform all value-creating 

processes, the importance of collaboration and value co-creation by sharing resources with other 

economic actors becomes evident (Lusch and Vargo 2006; Vargo, Lusch, and Morgan 2006). 

The role as a firm’s resource-integrator is expressed well in the statement that “organizations 

exist to integrate and transform micro-specialized competencies into complex services that are 

demanded in the marketplace” (Vargo and Lusch 2006, p. 53). 

In the resource-integrating process, operant resources have been of greater importance 

than operand resources. Operand resources, defined as “resources on which an operation or act is 

performed to produce an effect,” include natural or production resources such as land, plant life, 

minerals, and other natural resources, whereas operant resources are resources “which are 

employed to act on operand resources” such as knowledge and skills (Vargo and Lusch 2004, p. 

2). Given the current economic thought that a firm’s productivity is primarily dependent on 

knowledge and skills (Capon and Glazer 1987; Nelson, Peck, and Kalachek 1967), service-

dominant logic holds that the application of specialized skills and knowledge is the fundamental 

unit of exchange, and knowledge and skills are viewed as key for competitive advantage (Vargo 

and Lusch 2004). From a firm’s perspective, customers’ competences (e.g., knowledge and 

skills) become valuable operant resources for the firm and goods, and the firm receives support 

from integrated knowledge and skills (Akaka 2007; Edvardsson, Tronvoll, and Gruber 2011; 

Lengnick-Hall 1996; Nambisan 2002). Specifically, customers can directly provide market 

information, which allows the manufacturer to capture their needs more effectively in product 

design. In addition, customers may provide access to development capabilities and other 

resources that the manufacturer lacks in-house (Campbell and Cooper 1999). Consequently, co-

production between customers and NPD teams generates better value through information and 

 

18 


 
resource integration. This logic has supported the argument that customer participation in the 

 

NPD process has positive effects on new product success. 

Coordination Theory 

However, service-dominant logic does not take into account coordination problems 

which may arise from integrating customers in the NPD process. Coordination is a process that is 

required when one or more actors perform interdependent activities to achieve goals (Crowston 

1997; Malone 1988; Malone and Crowston 1990). Specifically, the need for coordination is 

generated by two types of interdependencies: among actors and among activities. Many 

organizational researchers have defined interdependency or dependency as arising between 

multiple actors who attempt to accomplish their goals (Crowston 2003). For example, Victor and 

Blackburn (1987) defined dependency as the “extent to which a unit’s outcomes are controlled 

directly by or are contingent upon the actions of another unit” (p. 490). McCann and Ferry 

(1979) similarly defined interdependency as “when actions taken by one referent system affect 

the actions or outcomes of another referent system” (p. 113). In contrast to most organizational 

researchers, researchers studying dependency in other fields have analyzed dependency arising 

between activities. For instance, a software engineer planning to change one module in a 

computer system must first determine if the change will affect other modules because of 

interdependency among modules. In developing coordination theory, Malone and Crowston 

(1994) have also viewed dependence as arising between activities. According to coordination 

theory, dependencies among activities are primarily generated in four cases: when actors share 

resources, when producers and consumers design products together, when activities among 

actors need to occur at the same time, and when multiple actors select the overall goal and divide 

tasks to achieve it. In sum, interdependency can be generated when actors, activities, or both rely 

 

19 


 

 
on the actions of other actors, and coordination is required in these interdependent situations. In 

this regard, co-production that involves more than two actors (i.e., NPD teams and end 

customers) sharing resources and assigns tasks to them to co-develop new products is viewed as 

a context that demands harmonious coordination among actors and activities.  

At the heart of coordination is managing dependencies among actors or activities and 

integrating divided efforts into a common goal through coordination mechanisms (Crowston, 

Rubleske, and Howison 2006; Heath and Staudenmayer 2000; Lewis et al. 2001; Malone and 

Crowston 1994). However, the integration and harmonious adjustment of individual work efforts 

toward accomplishing a larger goal is not that easy (Singh 1992). First of all, there may be 

psychological barriers that get in the way of integrating divided work into a common goal (Heath 

and Staudenmayer 2000). Heath and Staudenmayer (2000) named these psychological problems 

“coordination neglect.” Individuals who participate in interdependent work neglect the 

importance of coordination mechanisms and consequently fail to integrate their individual work 

into a completed goal. They exhibit coordination neglect because they tend to focus more on 

partitioning a task than on the process of integration (i.e., partition focus) and concentrate on 

individual components when they try to diagnose problems or intervene to provide a solution 

(Heath and Staudenmayer 2000). For example, when individuals who are assigned to certain jobs 

in the co-production process have partition focus and component focus, they may not understand 

the overall flow of the entire system (Pasquale 2001) and may not be aware of the decision 

procedures of the other actors. In addition, different languages and perspective among actors 

may lead to inadequate communication and insufficient translation which finally results in 

failures to integrate individual work into a common goal (Heath and Staudenmayer 2000; 

National Science Foundation 1989). Goal conflict among different actors is another cognitive 

 

20 


 

 
block which may lead to coordination neglect. If different goals among actors are not 

coordinated within the overall goal, the actors cannot achieve the final objective of the process. 

Coordination neglect can be applied to the NPD co-production context between NPD 

teams and end customers. When several individual jobs are assigned to end customers in NPD, 

customers may have a greater tendency to focus on partitioning and components. Because 

customers lack a firm goal to develop a new product by integrating individual work compared 

with NPD team members, they may only focus on individual work assigned to them. 

Furthermore, because NPD teams and end customers generally have different languages and 

perspective, communication among them may be inadequate and insufficiently translated. In 

sum, customers’ cognitive problems such as partition and component focus and inadequate 

communication may lead to coordination neglect, which results in failure to develop the new 

product through co-production with end customers. As such, the integration of work that is 

divided up to pursue a common goal is by its nature hard for NPD teams to do. 

Even when NPD teams overcome this difficult problem and integrate individual work, 

developing better outcomes is still difficult because although each decision from individual 

actors is locally optimal, it may not be globally optimal. In addition, actors may generate 

mutually conflicting decisions (Pasquale 2001). This problem is evident in the case of software 

development (DeMarco 1995; DeMarco and Lister 1987). When companies develop new 

software, they usually divide the entire development process into several modules and assign 

development of each module to individual specialists. Even though each module developed by 

specialists demonstrates locally optimal performance, integrating all modules into complete 

software may cause mutual conflicts among modules and unanticipated inadequate design 

(Boehm and Papaccio 1988; Kemerer 1997). As such, actors who fail to harmoniously 

 

21 


 
coordinate their activities may co-create products with sub-optimal features or performance 

 

(Carley 2001; Malone and Crowston 1994).  

In terms of time elapsed until development, additional work and efforts required to 

mitigate coordination problems and integrate individual work may delay the overall NPD process 

(Crowston et al. 2005). Various modes of coordination have been discussed in the literature. 

Making mutual adjustments through formal and informal meetings, conducting direct 

supervision, and standardizing work processes, outputs, norms and skills based on plans and 

rules are examples of steps organizations often take to coordinate activity (Mintzberg 1979; Van 

de Ven, Delbecq, and Koenig 1976). Regardless of modes of coordination, conducting formal 

and informal meetings, supervising activities of other actors, and setting up plans and norms 

demand additional time for companies who want to coordinate work activities in the NPD 

process.

CHAPTER 3 

HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT 

Nonlinear Relationship: Customer Participation and New Product Success 

Through customer participation, NPD teams attempt to accelerate time to market and 

improve market adoption, both of which are key objectives for new product success (Carbonell, 

Rodriguez-Escudero, and Pujari 2009). For the purpose of this study, market adoption is defined 

as the extent to which customers buy the co-produced product (O’Hern 2009), and time to 

market represents the time elapsed between the initial development and the ultimate introduction 

of a product into the marketplace (Griffin 1997). As an information resource, customers can play 

a pivotal role in the NPD process by providing accurate information about their needs. 

Information directly from customers themselves enables NPD teams to more closely reflect 

customer needs, thus contributing to enhanced product market fit (Enkel, Perez-Freije, and 

Gassmann 2005; Hoyer et al. 2010; Nambisan 2002). Furthermore, involving various customers 

in NPD can generate more divergent insights and ideas, which increases the possibility of 

creating a better product (Magnusson, Matthing, and Kristensson 2003; Troy, Hirunyawipada, 

and Paswan 2008). Thus, according to service-dominant logic, integrating customers as a good 

information resource is expected to enhance market adoption.  

However, as more interactions and more information are involved in the NPD process, 

coordination theory suggests that dependencies of activities between NPD teams and customers 

become more complex, and managing the dependencies becomes more challenging (Malone and 

Crowston 1994). Issues arising from coordination neglect (Heath and Staudenmayer 2000) make 

integrating individual work divided between NPD teams and end customers into a completed 

 

23 


 

 
product difficult by nature. Thus, some NPD teams which engage end customers in the NPD 

process may hold the NPD projects for a long time without accomplishing the final goal (i.e., 

development of the new product). Even when NPD teams overcome coordination neglect and 

introduce new products into the market, the outcomes of the co-produced products could be 

unsatisfactory. Assigning NPD tasks among a large number of customers is likely to make it 

difficult for NPD teams to grasp the overall flow of the entire system and to generate an optimal 

solution from a wide variety of customer input due to mutually conflicting decision problems and 

goal conflicts (Pasquale 2001). For example, Crowston, Rubleske, and Howison (2006) pointed 

out that actors may suggest features of new software without being aware that the new features 

may unintentionally negatively affect other features. Consequently, NPD teams may end up with 

suboptimal solutions in circumstances in which excessive customer participation makes 

harmonious coordination among co-production activities impossible. This will lead to lower 

market adoption. Customer participation in the NPD process is thus expected to enhance market 

adoption up to a certain point where harmonious coordination is optimal, but begin to degrade it 

beyond that point. 

H1: There will be an inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and 

market adoption. 

Building on coordination theory, similar arguments can be applied to the relationship 

between customer participation and time to market. Through active participation, customers 

provide NPD teams with accurate accounts of their needs and requirements. This shortens NPD 

teams’ iterative searching process to discover customers’ needs (Nambisan 2002). Because 

customer participation is likely to help identify and correct problems early in the NPD process, 

NPD teams can reduce the risk of having to redo the whole NPD process (Alam 2002; O’Hern 

 

24 


 
and Rindfleisch 2009; von Hippel and Katz 2002). Moreover, customers as co-developers are 

sometimes in charge of developing certain portions of the new product (Nambisan 2002). This 

customer role as an information resource and co-developer is expected to speed up the overall 

 

NPD process.  

However, coordination neglect would suggest that NPD teams may not even achieve 

launch of the new product (Heath and Staudenmayer 2000). Due to the psychological barriers in 

integrating individual tasks into a common goal, many NPD projects are left in the development 

process for a long time or stopped without developing new products. In the real world, several 

new software development projects in SourceForge.net which engaged end customers remain 

inactive without launching new software. Coordination theory also suggests that customer 

participation beyond a certain point robs NPD teams of the effort and time needed to understand 

the entire NPD process, harmonize mutually conflicting ideas and goals, and communicate with 

various customers (Malone and Crowston 1994; Pasquale 2001). The time and resource demands 

required by the strong need for coordination among co-production activities may offset benefits 

of customer participation (Datar et al. 1996; Sethi 2000; Troy, Hirunyawipada, and Paswan 

2008). Thus, customer participation is expected to shorten development time up to the point 

where serious coordination problems do not take place, but increase it beyond that point. 

H2: There will be a U-shaped relationship between customer participation and time to 

market. 

Contextual Effect: Stages of Customer Participation 

Customers play an important role at various stages of the NPD process, but their main 

role and their contributions to NPD differ depending on the stage. In the early phases of NPD 

such as ideation, customers primarily contribute by providing divergent and creative ideas about 

 

25 


 
customers’ needs and new ways to meet these needs (Gruner and Homburg 2000; Hoyer et al. 

2010). Quantity of information (i.e., large number of ideas) is regarded as more important than 

quality of information (Troy, Szymanski, and Varadarajan 2001). In contrast, the main role of 

customers at later stages such as product testing is to recognize problems and suggest 

 

incremental modifications within a range of already developed prototypes, as well as make the 

product error-free (Jeppesen and Molin 2003; O’Hern and Rindfleisch 2009). Quality rather than 

quantity of information is emphasized (Troy, Szymanski, and Varadarajan 2001). However, “at a 

very late stage, customers’ input is reduced to mere incremental improvement of the prototype 

and can no longer be radical” (Enkel, Perez-Freije, and Gassmann 2005, p. 432).  

With regard to market adoption, customer participation in the initial stage is expected to 

enhance market adoption because a large amount of innovative and divergent input has greater 

potential to find alternative ways to satisfy customers’ needs (Arnold, Fang, and Palmatier 2011). 

Conversely, customer participation in the later phase is limited to mere incremental 

improvements of the developed product. The wrong product concept chosen in the initial phase 

cannot be overthrown, which may not improve market adoption of the co-produced product.  

When it comes to time to market, however, the opposite effect is expected. Determining 

and launching a final solution from a large number of ideas requires more time due to difficulty 

in sharing ideas among participants and building a consensus (Crowston, Rubleske, and Howison 

2006; Pasquale 2001). Especially when the ideas are very diverse, deciding on a final solution 

from many options is extremely difficult. Arnold, Fang, and Palmatier (2011) mentioned that 

diversity of ideas maximizes any confusion or complexity in the innovation process by making it 

more difficult to establish formal, structured coordination mechanisms. Thus, a large number of 

 

26 


 
divergent ideas in the early stage of NPD may delay time to market, whereas relatively 

homogenous ideas in later NPD phases may not generate serious coordination problems. 

 

H3: The effect of customer participation on market adoption will increase as the ratio of 

customer participation at early stages to late stages increases.  

H4: The effect of customer participation on time to market will increase as the ratio of 

customer participation at early stages to late stages increases.  

Contextual Effect: Breadth of Customer Participation 

Relevant research to date on customer participation has rarely addressed breadth of 

customer participation, focusing instead on intensity of customer participation. However, Fang, 

Palmatier, and Evans (2008) and Hoyer et al. (2010) argue that customer participation should be 

understood with breadth representing the scope of participation as well as intensity representing 

the level of involvement. Breadth of customer participation is defined as the extent to which 

customers are involved in a wide range of activities in the NPD process (Fang, Palmatier, and 

Evans 2008). More specifically, breadth is assessed by the number of NPD stages that end 

customers actively participate in. For example, when customers are engaged in just one activity 

(e.g., idea generation), breadth of customer participation is 1. When customers are involved in a 

wide range of activities from idea generation to product testing, breadth of customer participation 

increases.   

From a NPD team’s perspective, customer participation in a wide variety of NPD 

activities provides opportunities to capture customers’ specific requirements expressed at various 

NPD stages (De Luca and Atuahene-Gima 2007; Kogut and Zander 1992). For example, when 

customers are engaged in various activities including ideation, development of the parts of the 

new product, and product testing, NPD teams can get ideas about ideal features of a new product, 

 

27 


 
suggestions about solutions to satisfy customers’ needs, and information on problems related to 

usage situations. Although narrow customer participation within a particular NPD activity tends 

to provide NPD teams with sophisticated information on a particular area, it may limit input or 

 

ideas which can be captured within a particular NPD activity (Wang and von Tunzelmann 2000). 

Furthermore, customers who participate broadly are likely to develop a stronger feeling of 

psychological ownership of the new product, which leads to stronger demand for the new 

product (Fuchs, Prandelli, and Schreier 2010). As a result, broad customer participation may 

improve market adoption, whereas narrow customer participation may not improve market 

adoption as much.  

However, broad customer participation might hinder quick launch of new products. 

Coordination theory suggests that when customers are involved in a wide variety of NPD 

activities, NPD teams need to manage interdependencies that arise from the various NPD 

activities (Malone and Crowston 1994). Communication and coordination between NPD teams 

and customers in each activity take significant time and managerial resources, and this problem 

can never be eliminated completely (Pasquale 2001). Conversely, narrow customer participation 

within a particular NPD activity may not delay the overall NPD process because the need for 

coordination is limited to a particular activity and sophisticated information from customers 

allows the NPD team to move forward quickly to the next stage.  

H5: The effect of customer participation on market adoption will increase as the breadth 

of customer participation increases. 

H6: The effect of customer participation on time to market will increase as the breadth of 

customer participation increases.

Contextual Effect: NPD Team’s Co-Production Capability 

A NPD team’s ability to effectively and efficiently manage customer participation is 

increasingly being recognized as a source of lasting competitive advantage (Prahalad and 

Ramaswamy 2000, 2004; Ramani and Kumar 2008; Rayport and Jaworski 2005; Van Doorn et 

al. 2010; Zhang and Chen 2008). However, research on how companies can manage customer 

participation as a source of competitive advantage is very limited. As a notable exception, 

Ramani and Kumar (2008) proposed a new concept of interaction orientation, defined as “a 

firm’s ability to interact with its individual customers and to take advantage of information 

obtained from them through successive interactions” (p. 27). As one important dimension of 

interaction orientation, they emphasized a firm’s ability to facilitate the process of allowing 

customers to share feedback on products and services and to participate actively in designing 

products and services. Mathwick, Wiertz, and de Ruyter (2008) also contended that companies 

need to encourage customers to be involved in co-production behaviors by providing various 

places for them to express their ideas and thoughts. As such, extant literature has focused on how 

companies can encourage customers to be involved in the co-production process.  

However, previous researchers have overlooked the value of a firm’s ability to leverage 

customer input through co-production behaviors. Encouraging customers to be engaged in co-

production is necessary but not sufficient to nurture and harness the positive potential of 

customer participation in the NPD process. To nurture the benefits, companies need to recognize 

the value of input from customer participation and effectively apply it to new products. In the 

dissertation, this concept is reflected in a NPD team’s co-production capability, which is defined 

as a firm’s ability to effectively leverage customer input through co-production behaviors in the 

NPD process. Specifically, this capability captures a process to recognize the value of customer 

 

29 


 
input and apply the input to commercial ends. Similar to the concept of absorptive capacity 

(Cohen and Levinthal 1990), the process emphasizes not information itself but transformation 

 

and exploitation of information to commercial ends.  

Currently, the capability to leverage customers’ input has been growing in importance. 

First of all, if a NPD team is not able to leverage the insights, valuable information from 

customer participation becomes useless. Furthermore, Bendapudi and Leone (2003) and Fuchs, 

Prandelli, and Schreier (2010) demonstrated that if the outcome of the co-creation activity does 

not adequately reflect customers’ needs or preferences, customers have a negative attitude 

toward the co-produced product and the company. Consequently, NPD teams may benefit from 

customer participation only when they have high co-production capability. Moreover, a NPD 

team’s ability to leverage customers’ input may accelerate the overall NPD process because NPD 

teams can quickly proceed to the next phase of the NPD process by using customers’ valuable 

input and efficiently coordinate the co-production process.  

H7: The effect of customer participation on market adoption will increase as the NPD 

team’s co-production capability increases. 

 H8: The effect of customer participation on time to market will decline as the NPD 

team’s co-production capability increases.

Contextual Effect: Product Individuality 

 

In addition to contextual variables related to customer participation execution, specific 

characteristics of products may also moderate the relationships between customer participation 

and market adoption. Product individuality is suggested as a potential product-specific moderator. 

In this study, product individuality refers to the extent to which a NPD team offers individualized 

products rather than standardized ones (Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann 2011). 

 

In some industries, products themselves are highly individualized to meet the customers’ 

specific needs (Tuli, Kohli, and Bharadwaj 2007). In environments in which highly 

individualized products are offered, identifying customers’ needs and applying them to 

commercial ends are crucial in improving market outcomes of the new product. Thus, obtaining 

information on customers’ specific needs through active customer participation may be much 

more valuable for individualized products. The argument of Verbeke et al. (2008) that a 

salesperson’s ability to understand specific customer needs is more strongly related to sales 

 

31 


 
performance in industries in which highly individualized products are sold lends support. Along 

the same lines, Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann (2011) recently found that a salesperson’s 

customer orientation is much more valuable in enhancing sales performance if products are 

 

individualized rather than standardized.  

 

However, this situation is different for standardized products. In situations in which 

products are standardized, customers may not be aware of new features or ideas of the products 

or they may perceive highly complex and individualized products in such situations as 

inadequate or useless (Verbeke et al. 2008). Thus, companies may not obtain valuable insights 

on new products from customer participation in the NPD process and customer participation may 

simply increase complexity of the NPD process without benefits. On the basis of this logic, the 

effect of customer participation on market adoption is expected to be stronger if the co-produced 

product is individualized rather than standardized.  

H9: The effect of customer participation on market adoption will increase as the 

individuality of the co-produced product increases.  

Contextual Effect: Product’s Price Positioning 

 

The relationship between customer participation and market adoption may vary 

depending on the co-produced product’s overall price positioning. The co-produced product’s 

overall price positioning is defined as the overall price level of the co-produced product 

compared to that of competitors’ products (Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann 2011). From a 

customer’s point of view, a product’s general price level indicates its quality and, accordingly, 

the equivalent value a customer receives (Rao and Monroe 1989). Consequently, if a product’s 

price level is substantially above the market average, customers expect additional benefits in 

return for accepting higher prices (Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann 2011). 

 

32 


 

 
 

In situations in which the overall price level of a co-produced product is higher than the 

market average, companies need to more closely reflect customers’ specific needs in order to 

satisfy customers’ high expectations. In contrast, if the co-produced product’s price level is 

below the market average, companies attempt to compete in the market on the basis of lower 

prices. Therefore, identifying customers’ specific needs and applying them to the co-produced 

product through customer participation in the NPD process seems to be much less valuable. 

Rather, lowering prices by maintaining only fundamental functions of the product may be a 

highly useful strategy. Furthermore, customers do not expect additional benefits from products 

with lower prices. Thus, the efforts that companies make to engage end customers in the NPD 

process in an attempt to seek information about lower-priced products might not be evaluated 

highly. Consequently, the effect of customer participation on market adoption is expected to be 

stronger when the overall price level of the co-produced product is high. 

H10: The effect of customer participation on market adoption will increase as the price 

level increases.

CHAPTER 4 

STUDY 1 

Overview of Studies 1 and 2 

The hypotheses were tested using two complementary samples. The first sample comes 

 

 

from SourceForge.net, the leading open source software repository, which provides websites that 

allows NPD teams who develop new software and users to organize and coordinate open source 

software development (Grewal, Lilien, and Mallapragada 2006). The open source software 

development context in which end users co-create new software by suggesting new features, 

developing portions of the new software, reporting bugs, developing patches, and so on has been 

considered a prototypical example of collaborative co-production (O’Hern and Rindfleisch 

2009). SourceForge.net has accumulated information on co-production activities in which end 

users participated in new software development. Thus, data from SourceForge.net are expected 

to provide a good context to test the hypotheses regarding the impact of customer participation in 

the NPD process. 

 

However, co-production with end customers in the NPD process takes a wide variety of 

forms in terms of the degree to which companies allow customer contribution activity, who 

mainly selects the final product, and so on (O’Hern and Rindfleisch 2009; Piller, Ihl, and Vossen 

2010). Given the variety of co-production forms and different characteristics of the co-produced 

product and industry, the results from one specific setting (i.e., open source software 

development) may not be extended to other contexts. In order to validate the findings of the first 

study and examine whether there are product- or industry-specific variables to moderate the 

 

34 


 

 
effect of customer participation on new product success, survey data from a wide variety of 

industries are collected using a Qualtrics panel. Comparing the results of data from 

SourceForge.net with the Qualtrics survey data allows the effect of customer participation in the 

NPD process on market adoption and time to market to be thoroughly investigated. First, the 

analysis approach and findings from SourceForge.net are provided in this chapter. 

Context and Data Source of Study 1 

 

The hypotheses were tested in the context of open source software development. This 

seems to be a reasonable context for several reasons. First and foremost, open source software 

development represents well the phenomenon of customer participation in the NPD process 

(Kogut and Metiu 2001; Lee and Cole 2003; Mallapragada 2008; O’Hern 2009; von Hippel 

2005; von Hippel and von Krogh 2003). Core developers in the open source software 

development context usually initiate software development projects on public online 

development sites and anyone from anywhere in the world can participate in the software 

development process (O’Mahony and Bechky 2008). In this process, users (i.e., end customers) 

are actively engaged in suggesting features for a new product (i.e., software), developing the 

product, and testing it across the entire NPD process. “Ideas emerge from a diverse pool of 

distributed contributors and are accepted or rejected by the core developers” (O’Mahony and 

Bechky 2008, p. 428). The open source software development process is very similar to the NPD 

process in which end customers are actively involved in that ordinary individuals are voluntarily 

engaged in the NPD process, share their ideas with firms (core developers in case of open source 

software development), and firms gather ideas from ordinary individuals and finally decide to 

accept or reject them. In suggesting a typology of customer co-creation, O’Hern and Rindfleisch 

 

35 


 
(2009) noted that open source software development is a good example of the most active type of 

 

customer co-creation.  

Second, open source software development is a good context to show the need for 

coordination (O’Mahony and Ferraro 2007). Basically, because any individuals from anywhere 

in the world can participate in the open source software development process, managing 

interdependence to achieve a common goal (i.e., new software development) is not easy. In 

addition, core developers in the open source development context must integrate individual 

contributions into a common pool, which can heighten interdependencies and the need for 

coordination mechanisms (e.g., O’Mahony and Ferraro 2007; Thompson 1967).   

Third, open source software development features a wide variance in terms of the degree 

of user participation. In some software development projects which require specific skills, 

customer participation is limited and a few developers take charge of the whole development 

process. On the other hand, customers tend to be actively engaged in other software development 

projects which usually do not need complex expertise. Thus, an open source development project 

is viewed as an adequate unit of analysis in testing the effect of increasing customer participation 

on new product success. 

 

Finally, open source software development projects keep track of cumulative data on 

customer participation in the new software development process and make the data publicly 

available. SourceForge.net is the leading open source repository that provides websites for NPD 

teams and users to organize and coordinate open source software development (Grewal, Lilien, 

and Mallapragada 2006). As of February 2012, more than 3.4 million users had participated in 

open source development processes in more than 324,000 projects reported on SourceForge.net. 

The collaborative tools that the website provides enable a project founder to recruit volunteer 

 

36 


 

 
users and organize the development of the product via the Internet. Von Hippel and von Krogh 

(2003) suggested that SourceForge.net could be utilized as an attractive venue for research into 

open innovation models which encourage customers to actively participate in the firm’s 

innovation process. Based on their suggestions, there have been several recent studies in which 

data from SourceForge.net were used and analyzed (e.g., Grewal, Lilien, and Mallapragada 

2006; Mallapragada 2008; O’Hern 2009). I have been granted access to secondary data from its 

data warehouse, which records and organizes all activities on the site (Madey 2005). 

Sample of Study 1 

To avoid inconsistencies and confounds from different start times, only new projects 

initiated from January 2007 to March 2007 were included in the sample frame for this study. 

These projects were tracked over a period of four years from January 2007 to March 2011. Given 

that Mallapragada (2008) traced the projects in the SourceForge for 42 months, the period of 48 

months seems to be reasonable. In total, 6,163 new projects were launched during the first 

quarter of 2007. Of these, 1,008 new software development projects included end customers as 

participants in any co-production behavior (e.g., bug reports, feature requests, support requests, 

and patch submission), meaning that 16.36% of the NPD projects listed in SourceForge.net 

during the period allowed customers to engage in co-production activities. Among these 1,008 

projects, 342 projects were deleted from the study due to incomplete data, resulting in 666 new 

software development projects to be included in the sample. Extreme values were identified 

following Cook’s distance (Cook 1977, 1979) and Bollen and Jackman’s (1990) guideline to cut 

off outliers (i.e., Cook’s distance > 4/n, n = the number of observations). Seventeen outliers for 

market adoption and nineteen outliers for time to market were detected, and the results were 

compared with and without outliers. There is no specific reason that the detected extreme values 

 

37 


 
are distorted, and the findings from both samples with and without outliers are consistent. 

However, because the detected extreme values tend to amplify the multicollinearity between 

independent variables and interaction terms, the hypotheses are tested based on a total of 649 

projects for market adoption and 647 projects for time to market after deleting the extreme 

 

values.  

Measures of Study 1 

Customer participation. Customer participation is measured as the sum of any co-

production behavior (i.e., bug report, patch submission, new feature suggestions, and support 

suggestions) that registered users made on the new software development project, following 

Chan, Yim, and Lam (2010).  

Market adoption. Market adoption, representing the market-based performance of the co-

produced product, is assessed as the number of downloads of the co-produced software over the 

life-span of the project (Grewal, Lilien, and Mallapragada 2006; O’Hern 2009). Given that the 

co-produced software is distributed only through SourceForge.net and freely available, the 

number of downloads could be used as a surrogate for sales (Chandrashekaran et al. 1999). 

Time to market. Time to market is measured as the hours from the beginning of 

development to the first package release of the co-produced software, following Mallapragada 

(2008). SourceForge.net provides information on time of project registration and time of first 

package software release for the project, so the hours that elapse between the initial development 

and the first introduction of a product into the marketplace can be calculated. Hours are utilized 

as a unit of measure instead of days because some new software development projects indicated 

the first package release of the new software in a few hours. In particular, when new software is 

based on previously developed codes, the release time of software is relatively short. 

 

38 


 

 

Stages of customer participation. Stages of customer participation are measured as the 

ratio of feature suggestions divided by average feature suggestions to bug reports divided by 

average bug reports. Suggesting new features for a software product mainly takes place in the 

early phase, whereas reporting bugs in the developed software occurs in the later NPD phase. 

Thus, the number of feature suggestions of a project divided by average feature suggestions that 

users made in the sample projects reflects the degree to which users are involved in the early 

stage. Similarly, the number of bug reports in a project divided by average bugs reported by 

users in the sample project represents the degree of customer participation in the later NPD stage. 

Consequently, the ratio of feature suggestions divided by average feature suggestions to bug 

reports divided by average bug reports captures the extent to which end users are involved in the 

early phase of the new software development process as opposed to in the later stage. 

Breadth of customer participation. Breadth of customer participation is assessed as the 

number of activities in the project that users actively participate in. SourceForge.net records five 

different activities users can be involved in: new feature suggestion, bug reporting, patch 

development, idea posting in the forum, and support suggestion. If the number of times users 

within a project participate in a particular activity out of the five activities is greater than the 

average of the particular activity in the sample projects, users within the project can be 

considered to be actively participating in the activity. If each NPD project in the sample 

evaluates its participation in the five activities in such a way, breadth of customer participation of 

each project can range from zero to five. Zero means that customers do not actively participate in 

any co-production activities among the five different activities, whereas five means that 

customers are engaged in all five co-production activities. This is consistent with the approach of 

 

39 


 
Fang, Palmatier, and Evans (2008) in measuring breadth of customer participation based on the 

 

number of NPD process activities customers participated in. 

Co-production capability. A NPD team’s capability to leverage customers’ input is 

measured as the ratio of the closed suggestions to all the suggestions that users in the project 

made. In other words, compared with projects which have many suggestions generated by users 

left open, projects which are able to reflect or close more users’ suggestions could be regarded as 

having a high level of co-production capability to leverage customers’ input. The number of all 

the suggestions from users refers to the sum of the numbers of bugs reported by users, patches 

developed by users, supports suggested by users, and new software features suggested by users. 

For the co-production capability, the ratio of how many users’ suggestions (i.e., reported bugs, 

developed patches, suggested support, and suggested features) are closed by the project’s 

developers is calculated. Table 4.1 summarizes the measures of focal constructs of interest.

Control Variables of Study 1 

 

To rule out other effects on market adoption, several control variables are included. 

Because market adoption measured by number of downloads is likely to increase with the age of 

the project, number of months since the inception of the project is utilized to control for the age 

of the project (Grewal, Lilien, and Mallapragada 2006). In addition, to control for different levels 

of market potential of new software, number of page views is collected because this directly 

signals the general interest level in the project and its market potential (Grewal, Lilien, and 

Mallapragada 2006). Because the degree of complexity of products may influence how easily 

customers adopt the products, this is assessed by size of the released software files for the project 

in megabytes. Finally, to control for open source software characteristics, type of open source 

license of projects is included in the model. In the open source software setting, different licenses 

grant various degrees of control over the source code to users (Stewart, Ammeter, and Maruping 

2006; Subramaniam, Sen, and Nelson 2009). The most common licenses include the generally 

public license (GPL) and the less restrictive limited general public license (LGPL). Because GPL 

is the most widely used, I coded the license type variable as a dichotomous variable, where 1 

indicates use of GPL and 0 otherwise. This is consistent with Mallapragada’s (2008) approach. 

Table 4.2 summarizes the control variables included in the model. 

 

Time to market is also influenced by several variables other than focal constructs. First of 

all, overall experience of developers in the NPD project could affect time to market 

(Mallapragada 2008). Because greater experience of developers is expected to shorten time to 

market, overall experience of developers is controlled for in the model for time to market. The 

overall experience of developers is assessed by using the cumulative time (i.e., days) since they 

registered in the open source community (Mallapragada 2008). Time to market may also depend 

 

42 


 
on the degree of complexity of products and prior code availability for the project. More 

complicated or more difficult projects need more development time prior to release of the 

 

product. Following Mallapragada (2008), complexity of projects is measured by the size of the 

released project files for the project in megabytes. Some projects lead to product releases 

immediately after registration because the development team has been working on the source 

code before registering the site. To control for this prior code availability, data about the status of 

the project at the time of its registration are obtained. A dichotomous variable indicates if prior 

code was available at the time of registration, equal to 1 if prior code was available and 0 

otherwise (Subramaniam, Sen, and Nelson 2009). Finally, to control for open source software 

project characteristics, type of open source license is included. Consistent with the model for 

market adoption, the license type variable is coded as a dichotomous variable, where 1 indicates 

use of GPL and 0 otherwise (Mallapragada 2008). Table 4.2 indicates control variables included 

in the models of Study 1.

Data Analysis of Study 1 

Two different models are specified for the two dependent variables (i.e., market adoption 

and time to market). To examine the relationships among customer participation, various 

moderators, and market adoption, moderated hierarchical OLS regression is employed. In 

general, when the outcome variable is count data, count models such as Poisson and a negative 

binomial regression are preferred to OLS regression because count data are often analyzed 

incorrectly with OLS regression (O’Hern 2009). In the current dissertation, because market 

adoption as a dependent variable is count data which is assessed as the number of downloads of 

the co-produced software, a Poisson or negative binomial regression model may be appropriate. 

However, if the values of the outcome variable are dispersed as in the data used in this study, the 

results of OLS regression are expected to be correctly estimated although the dependent variable 

is count data. In addition, in Poisson and negative binomial regression models, including the 

interaction terms between the squared term (i.e., CP2) and moderating variable causes 

interpretation problems. Therefore, the relationship between customer participation and market 

adoption is analyzed using OLS regression after log-transforming market adoption. In addition, 

because focal variables for this model (i.e., market adoption and customer participation) are 

 

44 


 
censored, the results of the censored regression are also compared with those of OLS analysis to 

 

check the robustness of the results.  

To analyze the relationship between customer participation and time to market, a survival 

model (i.e., hazard model) is specified. Because the dependent variable (i.e., time to market) is 

strictly positive, the estimates from a regression-based approach may be biased and inconsistent 

(Datar et al. 1996). When the dependent variable is a measure of the duration from one time to 

another, as in the data used in this study, the hazard function model has been widely used (e.g., 

Datar et al. 1996; Mallapragada 2008). To check robustness of the result, OLS regression after 

log-transforming time to market and censored regression are also conducted.

Table 4.3 presents means and standard deviations of all the variables in Study 1. On 

average, end users in the 649 sample projects participated in 11.17 co-production behaviors for 

each project, including bug reporting, support requests, new feature suggestions, and patch 

development. However, as shown in Figure 4.1, customers are relatively less engaged in co-

production behaviors in most projects. Between 1 and 5 co-production behaviors were conducted 

in 64.25% of the projects (417 of 649 projects). In contrast, more than 70 co-production 

behaviors took place in 20 projects. The mean of market adoption is 5,713.06. However, as seen 

in Figure 4.2, the level of market adoption (i.e., number of downloads) varies from project to 

project. Of the 649 projects, 46.07% (299 projects) have fewer than 1,000 cumulative downloads, 

whereas 12.63% (82 projects) had more than 10,000 downloads. Time to market also differs 

according to projects. The mean time to market is 1,739.36 hours (i.e., 72.47 days). While 110 

projects took less than 24 hours to release the first package of the co-produced software, 82 

projects spent more than 5,000 hours (i.e., 208.33 days).

Table 4.4 shows correlations of the variables in Study 1. The correlations provide first 

insights into the relationships of interest. As shown in Table 4.4, customer participation is 

positively related with market adoption (r = .22, p < .01) and log-transformed market adoption (r 

= .21, p < .01). The more end customers are engaged in co-production behaviors, the more the 

product is adopted in the market. The correlation between customer participation and time to 

market is not significant (r = .05, p > .10). However, customer participation is positively related 

with time to market after log-transformation (r = .10, p < .05), implying that the more customers 

are involved in co-production behaviors, the longer it takes for the product to be launched into 

the market.  

 

48 


 

 

The correlations in Table 4.4 also show the relationships between dependent variables 

and control variables. As expected, products which have high market potential are positively 

related with market adoption (r = .44, p < .01). Complexity of products has significant positive 

relationship with time to market (r = .10, p < .01), demonstrating that products which are 

complicated require longer time to be introduced in the market. Prior code availability also 

shows the expected negative association with time to market (r = -.23, p < .01). In other words, if 

new software is based on previously developed code, time until the launch of the software in the 

market is short. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 present the scatter plot among customer participation, market 

adoption, and time to market. In particular, the scatterplot between customer participation and 

market adoption in Figure 4.4 demonstrates the possibility of non-linear relationship between the 

two variables.

Hypotheses Tests for Market Adoption in Study 1 

The two models for market adoption and time to market were conducted to investigate 

the non-linear relationships between customer participation and market adoption and time to 

market, and moderating effects in the non-linear relationships. Therefore, we need to statistically 

test for the presence of non-linear relationships before testing the hypotheses. 

The Ramsey Regression Equation Specification Error Test (RESET) is a general 

specification test for the linear regression model (Ramsey 1969). More specifically, it tests 

whether non-linear combinations of the fitted values help explain the dependent variable. The 

idea behind the test is that if non-linear combinations of the independent variables have any 

power in explaining the dependent variable, the model is mis-specified. The null hypothesis for 

the RESET is that the model has no omitted variables related to non-linear combinations of the 

independent variables. Thus, rejection of the null hypothesis means that the model has omitted 

variables related to non-linear combinations of the independent variables.  

To first test the presence of non-linear relationship between customer participation and 

market adoption, a RESET test was conducted. Control variables, independent variables, and all 

possible two-way interactions among independent variables were introduced in the model in 

order to investigate the possibility of non-linearity after ruling out the effects of all possible 

interactions among independent variables (Aiken and West 1991; Baer and Oldham 2006; Luo 

and Donthu 2006; Ritter and Walter 2012). The result of the RESET shows that the model 

includes non-linearity (F (3,631) = 9.19, p < .01). Thus, I proceeded to a formal moderated 

hierarchical regression analysis to test the nonlinearity between customer participation and 

market adoption and the moderating effects of stage, breadth, and capability in the nonlinear 

relationship.  

 

52 


 

 

Table 4.5 presents the results of the moderated hierarchical regression analysis used to 

test the hypotheses. The control variables were introduced into a regression equation (step 1). In 

step 2, after centering the independent variables (Aiken and West 1991), the main effect 

variables and the linear two-way interactions were entered in order to control for linear trends 

(Baer and Oldham 2006; Luo and Donthu 2006; Ritter and Walter 2012). Next, to test the 

prediction that customer participation would have a curvilinear relation to market adoption 

(Hypothesis 1), the quadratic customer participation term was introduced in step 3 of the 

regression equation. Finally, the relevant quadratic-by-linear interactions (i.e., CP2 x Stage, CP2 

x Breadth, CP2 x Capability) were introduced in steps 4, 5, and 6 to investigate the moderating 

roles of stage, breadth and co-production capability in the inverted U-shaped relationship. 

As shown in Table 4.5, the coefficient associated with the quadratic customer 

participation term was statistically significant (β = -.503, p < .05), showing the inverted U-

shaped relationship between customer participation and market adoption. The results 

demonstrate that in line with hypothesis 1, customer participation increases market adoption up 

to a certain point, but decreases market adoption beyond that point.

To check for robustness, I compared the result from the moderated hierarchical 

regression with those from the regression using robust standard error and the censored regression.

Tables 4.6 and 4.7 demonstrate the regression results based on robust standard error and 

censored regression result. Consistent with the result in Table 4.5, the results in Tables 4.6 and 

4.7 indicate that customer participation has a positive impact on log-transformed market 

adoption (b = .025, p < .05), whereas the square term of customer participation has a negative 

 

effect on log-transformed market adoption (b = -.027, p < .10).

Furthermore, to ensure that the nonlinear relationship between customer participation and 

market adoption is an inverted U-shape (one turn) and not an S-shape (two turns), a cubed IV 

term was included as well. The results demonstrated that the squared term is significant but the 

 

56 


 
cubed term is not. Thus, we can say that the nonlinear relationship between them follows an 

 

inverted U-shape. 

Hypotheses 3, 5, and 7 predict that stage when end customers are engaged in the NPD 

process (Hypothesis 3), how broadly end customers are involved in the NPD process (Hypothesis 

5), and a NPD team’s capability to leverage customers’ insights (Hypothesis 7) would moderate 

the inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and market adoption. As 

indicated in Table 4.5, the interaction term between CP2 and stage was not significant (β = -.098, 

p > .10), rejecting Hypothesis 3. In contrast, the coefficients of interaction terms between CP2 

and breadth and co-production capability were significant (for breadth: β = -.219, p < .10, for co-

production capability: β = .563, p < .01), supporting Hypotheses 5 and 7. As seen in step 5 of 

Table 4.5, the addition of the interaction term between CP2 and breadth explains significant 

additional variance in market adoption (ΔR2 = .009, ΔF= 6.791, p < .01). The addition of the 

interaction term between CP2 and co-production capability also demonstrates significant increase 

in R2 (ΔR2 = .010, ΔF= 7.913, p < .01). Finally, the results based on robust standard error and the 

results from censored regression also confirmed the same conclusions related to Hypotheses 3, 5, 

and 7.  

To facilitate the interpretation of the moderating effect of breadth, the relationship 

between customer participation and market adoption was plotted, where high and low levels of 

breadth were indicated as those above and below one standard deviation from the mean (Aiken 

and West 1991). Figure 4.6 displays the moderating effect of breadth in the non-linear 

relationship between customer participation and market adoption.

The direction of the moderation is as expected. Overall, NPD teams can benefit more 

from high level of breadth in terms of market adoption. I also computed the optimum level of 

customer participation based on the first derivative of the OLS regression equation (Aiken and 

West 1991; Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann 2011). In other words, the level of customer 

participation was calculated when making the first derivation of the OLS regression equation 

zero. For high level of breadth, the optimum level of customer participation is 39.19, whereas the 

optimum level of customer participation for low level of breadth is 60.75. Even though broad 

customer participation overall can help improve market adoption, the optimum level of customer 

participation for high level of breadth is lower than that for low level of breadth. High level of 

breadth can provide opportunity to obtain various insights from broad customer participation but 

at the same time may increase coordination problems from a wide variety of customer 

 

58 


 

 
participation. Thus, compared with low level of breadth where the possibility of coordination 

problems is less, the optimum level of customer participation for high level of breadth is low. 

Similarly, to better understand the moderating effect of co-production capability, the 

relationship between customer participation and market adoption was plotted, where high and 

low levels of co-production capability were indicated as those above and below one standard 

deviation from the mean (Aiken and West 1991). Figure 4.7 displays the moderating effect of co-

production capability in the non-linear relationship between customer participation and market 

adoption.

As shown in Figure 4.7, when a NPD team has a low level of co-production capability, 

the effect of customer participation on market adoption follows the inverted U shape. In contrast, 

when a NPD team has a high level of co-production capability, the effect of customer 

participation on market adoption slightly increases as customer participation increases. Because a 

NPD team with a high level of co-production capability can effectively leverage and coordinate 

various insights from customers, the team improves market adoption as customer participation 

increases. The result confirms the importance of NPD team’s co-production capability. 

Hypotheses Tests for Time to Market in Study 1 

To first test for a non-linear relationship between customer participation and time to 

market, a Ramsey RESET was conducted (Ramsey 1969). Consistent with the test for market 

adoption, control variables, independent variables, and all possible two-way interactions among 

independent variables were introduced in the model in an attempt to test the possibility of non-

linearity after ruling out the effects of all possible interactions among independent variables 

(Aiken and West 1991; Baer and Oldham 2006; Luo and Donthu 2006; Ritter and Walter 2012). 

The result of the Ramsey RESET indicates that the model does not include any combination of 

non-linearity (F (3,629) = 1.34, p > .10). This finding is contrary to Hypothesis 2 which predicts 

a U-shaped relationship between customer participation and time to market, rejecting Hypothesis 

2. Contrary to my expectation, customer participation continuously increases time elapsed until 

the launch of co-produced products. This finding sounds a serious warning about the potential 

costs of customer participation in the NPD process in terms of time to market.  

Because the result of RESET indicated no non-linear relationship between customer 

participation and time to market, I only tested the moderating roles of stage, breadth, and NPD 

team’ co-production capability in the linear relationship between customer participation and time 

 

60 


 
to market. To test the hypotheses, a COX proportional hazards model (Cox 1972), which is a 

widely used survival model, was first analyzed. However, one of the main assumptions of the 

 

Cox proportional hazard model is proportionality, which assumes that the unique effect of a unit 

increase in an independent is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. To test the 

proportionality assumption, I conducted Schoenfeld’s (1982) test to show whether the model 

satisfies the proportionality assumption as a whole and each predictor in the model satisfies the 

proportionality assumption. The result of the global test indicates that we cannot reject 

proportionality (χ2 = 10.50, d.f. = 10, p > .10), supporting the assumption of proportional hazard. 

However, the results of Schoenfeld’s (1982) test for individual predictors demonstrate that 

complexity of products (χ2 = 1311.80, d.f. = 1, p < .01), NPD team’s co-production capability (χ2 

= 8.53, d.f. = 1, p < .01), and interaction between customer participation and stage (χ2 = 3376.17, 

d.f. = 1, p < .01) do not satisfy the proportionality assumption. Therefore, I tested hypotheses 

related to time to market based on parametric survival models rather than the proportional 

hazards model. Table 4.8 displays the results of the parametric survival models. Based on values 

of log-likelihood, two parametric survival models were reported in Table 4.8. One is based on 

gamma survival distribution, whereas the other is based on lognormal survival distribution. The 

findings from both parametric survival models are consistent. All control variables are 

significant and show expected directions. For instance, the overall experience of developers as 

well as prior code availability decreases time to market, whereas complexity of products 

increases time to market.

Furthermore, customer participation had a significant positive effect on time to market 

(for parametric survival model based on gamma distribution: b = .012, p < .01; for parametric 

survival model based on lognormal distribution: b = .011, p < .05), implying that customer 

participation continuously increases time required until the product launch. In addition, the 

significant moderating roles of stage and breadth were found from both models. In the 

parametric survival model using gamma distribution, the ratio of customer participation in early 

stages as opposed to that in later stages moderated the relationship between customer 

participation and time to market (b = .002, p < .10), and the breadth of customer participation 

 

62 


 
also significantly moderated the customer participation-time to market link (b = -.008, p < .05). 

 

Similarly, I found that both stage (b = .002, p < .05) and breadth (b = -.007, p < .10) significantly 

moderated the relationship between customer participation and time to market in the parametric 

survival model using lognormal distribution. To check the robustness of the above results, 

moderated hierarchical OLS regression, regression using robust standard error, and censored 

regression analysis were conducted and the results are reported in Tables 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11.

First, a moderated hierarchical regression approach was used as suggested by Aiken and 

West (1991). All predictor variables were centered to reduce multicollinearity among the 

 

63 


 
predictor variables and the interaction term. The maximum variance inflation factor (VIF) was 

 

3.325, which is below the rule of thumb cutoff of 10 (Kutner, Nachtsheim, and Neter 2004). This 

indicates that multicollinearity is not a serious threat in estimating the coefficients. In the first 

step, the control variables of overall experience of developers, complexity of products, prior code 

availability and license_dummy were entered into the regression equation. Next, in step 2, the 

main effect variables of customer participation, stage, breadth, and co-production capability were 

introduced. Finally, in step 3, the linear two-way interactions between customer participation and 

moderators were introduced.  

As seen in Table 4.9, control variables explain significant variance of time to market (ΔR2 

= .459, ΔF= 136.326, p < .01). As expected, the longer the overall experience of developers, the 

shorter the time to market (β = -.061, p < .05). As products are complex, a NPD team requires a 

longer time to launch the products in the market (β = .062, p < .05). Consistent with expectation, 

prior code availability has a negative impact on time to market, implying that the presence of 

prior code shortens time elapsed until the launch of products (β = -.650, p < .01). 

The results in step 3 shown in Table 4.9 indicate the moderating effects of stage, breadth, 

and co-production capability in the linear relationship between customer participation and time 

to market. First, the addition of three moderating effects in step 3 shows a significant increase in 

explaining the variance of time to market (ΔR2 = .005, ΔF= 2.190, p < .10). Furthermore, breadth 

of customer participation significantly moderated the relationship between customer 

participation and time to market (β = -.083, p < .05).  

To test the moderating impacts more rigorously, regression analysis using robust standard 

errors was implemented. The finding of the regression is more robust by testing the significance 

 

64 


 
of coefficients based on robust standard errors which take into account heteroscedasticity. Table 

 

4.10 presents the regression results using robust standard errors.

Overall, the results in Table 4.10 are in line with the findings in Table 4.9. One difference 

is that the findings based on robust standard errors indicate significant moderating impacts of 

when end customers are engaged in the NPD process (b = .002, p < .05) as well as breadth of 

customer participation (b = -.007, p < .10). The results from censored regression analysis as 

shown in Table 4.11 also demonstrate that both stage and breadth of customer participation 

moderate the relationship between customer participation and time to market. Taken together, we 

 

65 


 
can confirm the moderating roles of stage and breadth in the linear relationship between 

 

customer participation and time to market.

To facilitate the interpretation of the moderation effects, the customer participation-time 

to market relationships were plotted, where high and low levels of stage and breadth respectively 

were indicated as those above and below one standard deviation from the mean (Aiken and West 

1991). Figures 4.8 and 4.9 show the moderating impacts of stage and breadth.

Figure 4.8 

 

 

            

 

As seen in Figure 4.8, when the ratio of how much end customers are involved in early 

 

 

 

stage as opposed to later stage is high, customer participation has a positive impact on time to 

market. In other words, when end customers are mainly engaged in the early NPD process, 

customer participation increases time required until the product launch. On the other hand, when 

the ratio of how much end customers are involved in early stage as opposed to later stage is low, 

customer participation does not increase time to market. I further analyzed this interaction by 

evaluating simple slopes. Following Aiken and West (1991), simple slopes at two levels of stage 

where low is one standard deviation below the moderator and high is one standard deviation 

 

67 


 
above the moderator were estimated. Results indicate that when the ratio of customer 

participation in early stages as opposed to in later stages is high, the simple slope of the 

 

regression shows significant positive value (b = .012, t = 2.290, p < .05). In contrast, when the 

ratio of customer participation in early stages is low, the simple slope of the regression is not 

significantly different from zero (b = .006, t = 1.040, p > .10). Consistent with my expectation, 

compared with customer participation in later stages, customer participation in early stages tends 

to lengthen time to market. 

Figure 4.9 

The Moderating Effect of Breadth between Customer Participation and Time to Market 

            

 

 

68 


 
 

As seen in Figure 4.9, for both high and low breadth, customer participation seems to 

 

lengthen time elapsed to the new product launch. To statistically test whether each slope of the 

regression lines is significantly different from zero, simple slope tests were conducted. When end 

customers are broadly involved in the NPD process, simple slope of the regression line is not 

significant (b = .004, t = 1.056, p > .10). On the other hand, for low breadth, simple slope is 

significantly different from zero (b = .023, t = 2.833, p < .01). These findings are very interesting. 

For high breadth where end customers are involved in a wide variety of co-production activities, 

the impact of customer participation on time to market is consistent regardless of the level 

(intensity) of customer participation. Even at a low level, broad customer participation seriously 

impacts time to market. However, for low breadth where involvement of end customers 

concentrates on a limited number of co-production activities, customer participation significantly 

lengthens time elapsed until the new product launch.

CHAPTER 5 

STUDY 2 

Study 1 investigated a sample in one specific industry (i.e., open source software 

 

 

development). Although open source software development is a good context to vividly show 

customer participation in the NPD process, the findings of Study 1 may not be valid in other 

contexts because of the unique characteristics of the open source software industry. Therefore, 

Study 2 tests the generalizability of the findings from Study 1 and moderating effects of product 

individuality (H9) and price positioning (H10) by collecting survey data from a wide variety of 

industries. 

Pretest Sample and Data Collection of Study 2 

 

A pretest of the survey was conducted to check the validity of survey measures and 

procedures. The survey data for pretest were collected from NPD managers using Zoomerang. 

Zoomerang.com is an online survey tool that allows users to create and send surveys online and 

analyze the results on-demand. The website also offers commercial online panels composed of 

people who are pre-recruited to participate in online surveys. These online panels encompass 

managers in various industries as well as general customers. Therefore, I collected survey data 

from NPD managers in a Zoomerang online panel who have worked on a NPD project in which 

end customers have been involved to some extent to co-produce new products. The NPD 

managers cover a wide variety of industries. They were asked to respond to survey questions 

based on the most recently launched NPD project in which end customers were involved. 

 

70 


 
 

For the pretest of survey measures and procedures, 100 questionnaires were collected 

 

from July 22 to July 27, 2011. From a total of 689 NPD managers who got invitations for the 

online survey, 100 completed the survey for a response rate of 14.51%. Seven questionnaires out 

of the 100 questionnaires were removed because the same answers were selected for all the items 

in the survey. Another 12 responses were deleted because respondents’ knowledge of the 

particular NPD project that they had in mind when completing the questionnaire is below 4 on a 

7-point scale, indicating they were not knowledgeable of the particular NPD project. After these 

deletions, 81 responses were left to be analyzed for the pre-test. The mean of 81 respondents’ 

knowledge of the particular NPD project is 5.93 on a 7-point scale (S.D. = .972). Table 5.1 

presents the respondents’ characteristics.

All of the measures used in this study except co-production capability were adapted from 

existing scales. Items for co-production capability were newly developed for this study. All 

measures used a 7-point scale with the anchors such as 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly 

agree, 1 = not at all to 7 = a great extent, 1 = low to 7 = high, or 1 = much lower to 7 = much 

higher. All measures are provided in Appendix A.  

Customer participation. Customer participation is assessed with the initial seven items 

adapted from Chan, Yim, and Lam (2010) and Gruner and Homburg (2001). In this dissertation, 

customer participation is defined in terms of amount of information provision and intensity of 

actual interaction between a NPD team and end customers. Three items capturing how much 

information end customers provide to NPD teams come from Chan, Yim, and Lam (2010), and 

four items representing the intensity of interaction are adapted from measures developed by 

Gruner and Homburg (2001).  

 

72 


 
 

Market adoption. Market adoption is measured using three items from Lau, Tang, and 

 

Yam (2010). Market adoption represents market outcomes reflecting how much customers in the 

market accept the new product and how much financial success companies can achieve through 

the new product. Thus, these items assess the extent to which the NPD team achieves sales or 

profit compared with its goal. These perceptual performance measures have been used to 

effectively evaluate a firm’s performance. Given that firms are likely to be reluctant to share 

objective performance data due to confidentiality issues (Ward, Bickford, and Leong 1996) and 

differences in objective performance might vary in different industries (Ledwith 2000; Pagell 

and Krause 2004), comparing market performance of NPD teams in different industries using 

perceptual measures versus their goals is appropriate. 

 

Time to market. Time to market is assessed using three items adapted from Fang (2008). 

Specifically, the items ask respondents to rate their perceived speed of development of the new 

product compared with the industry norm or typical product development time. Given the 

difference in the speed of development of the new product in different industries, perceptual 

measures compared to the industry norm or typical development time rather than objective 

development time are expected to more effectively evaluate time to market. 

 

Stages of customer participation. Stages in which customers are involved are assessed 

by rating the degree to which end customers participated in each of the seven stages of the NPD 

process (i.e., idea generation, concept screening, product design, product engineering, product 

testing, market testing, and commercialization). This approach is consistent with Gruner and 

Homburg (2000) and Fang, Palmatier, and Evans (2008). Similar to the approach used in Study 1, 

the ratio of the degree to which customers are involved in early NPD stages (i.e., the sum of 

scores in idea generation, concept screening, product design, and product engineering divided by 

 

73 


 
four) to the degree to which customers are engaged in later phases (i.e., the sum of scores in 

product testing, market testing, and commercialization divided by three) is generated. In other 

words, as the ratio increases, customers on the project tend to be engaged in early NPD phases. 

Breadth of customer participation. Breadth of customer participation is operationalized 

 

as the sum of the number of activities which end customers actively engaged in (Fang, Palmatier, 

and Evans 2008). On the basis of the NPD literature, seven activities central to the NPD process 

(i.e., idea generation, concept screening, product design, product engineering, product testing, 

market testing, and commercialization) are identified. For each activity, respondents are asked 

the extent to which end customers are involved in the activity (rated on a scale of 1 = “not at all” 

to 7 = “a great extent”). The sum of the number of activities that the customer was engaged in to 

some extent (i.e., activities rated between 5 and 7 on the scales) is used to represent the breadth 

of customer participation.  

Co-production capability. The scale for co-production capability was newly developed 

for this dissertation. On the basis of the literature review and discussion with academic and 

professional experts in this area, the concept of co-production capability was clarified and five 

items were generated to capture the construct. Co-production capability is defined as a NPD 

team’s ability to leverage customer input to develop the new product in the NPD process. 

Specifically, co-production capability is composed of a process by which the NPD team 

recognizes value of input from end customers and applies it to the new product. Two items 

captures the NPD team’s ability to recognize the value of input and three items represent the 

NPD team’s ability to apply input to a new product.  

 

74 


 

 

Product individuality. To assess product individuality, NPD managers evaluated the 

degree to which the co-produced product is individualized rather than standardized using three 

items adapted from Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann (2011).  

Product price positioning. Product price positioning is measured with a single item from 

Homburg, Müller, and Klarmann (2011) that assesses the overall price level of the co-produced 

product compared with competitors’ products. Because product price positioning refers to a 

concrete and singular concept, there is expected to be no difference in the predictive validity of 

the multiple-item and single-item measures (Bergkvist and Rossiter 2007). Table 5.2 presents the 

source and number of items of focal constructs.

Control Variables of Study 2 

To control for effects of other variables on new product success (i.e., market adoption 

 

and time to market), several control variables are included. At the project level, new product 

innovativeness, which refers to the extent to which the co-produced product differs from 

competing alternatives in the industry (Dewar and Dutton 1986; Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001), 

may influence market adoption and time to market. I measured new product innovativeness using 

a three-item, seven-point Likert scale adapted from Moorman’s (1995) new product creativity 

scale. The scale items ask respondents about the extent to which the co-produced new product is 

novel to the industry and offers new ideas.  

Several researchers suggest that product quality enhances market adoption (e.g., Li and 

Calantone 1998; Sethi 2000). Therefore, to control for the quality of co-produced product, I 

assessed product quality using four items adapted from Atuahene-Gima and Wei (2011). 

Measures for product quality evaluate it in terms of reliability, durability, and functionality of the 

co-produced product. Finally, this dissertation controlled for project size, which is measured by 

the number of people in the NPD project. Because large teams have more cognitive and other 

resources, they may be capable of developing better new products, which leads to a higher level 

of new product success (Atuahene-Gima and Wei 2011). 

 

In addition to characteristics at the project level, firm-specific characteristics may 

influence new product success (Fang 2008). Building on previous literature, a firm’s size, 

measured by the number of full-time employees, was controlled for. 

 

At the environmental level, environmental turbulence was included because of its 

influence on new product success (Gatignon and Xuereb 1997). This was measured with three, 

seven-point Likert scales adapted from the work of Fang (2008) and Atuahene-Gima and Wei 

 

76 


 

 
(2010). These items rated the extent of change and predictability of customers’ preference and 

the market. Finally, industry dummy was included in order to rule out industry-specific effects. 

This is important to do given the possibility of the different impact of customer participation in 

new service development and new product development processes (e.g., Melton and Hartline 

2010; Schleimer and Shulman 2011). Table 5.3 indicates control variables and their sources.

Measure Assessment of Pretest 

 

To test reliability and validity of the measures, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was 

conducted including independent variable (i.e., customer participation), dependent variables (i.e., 

market adoption and time to market), and several moderating and control variables. After 

dropping three items from customer participation, two items from NPD team’s co-production 

capability, and one item from environmental turbulence, the selected measures provided good 

explanations for each construct. Table 5.4 presents the results of CFA. 

 

As seen in Table 5.4, all item loadings are positive and statistically significant, indicating 

unidimensionality and establishing convergent validity (Anderson 1987). In addition, there are 

 

77 


 
no negative variances (Bagozzi and Yi 1988). Latent variables are measured reliably. Average 

variance extracted (AVE) of all latent variables is above .50 and composite reliabilities (CR) of 

 

all focal constructs except environmental turbulence (CR = .68) are well above the recommended 

threshold of .70 (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). Squared multiple correlations (SMC) for most 

measures are also above .50 except TIME1 (SMC = .49), QUAL2 (SMC = .49), and TURB3 

(SMC = .35). Even though the measures for environmental turbulence should perhaps be revised 

for the main study, the measures exhibit good psychometric properties overall. In addition, the fit 

of the CFA model containing all constructs is satisfactory (χ2 = 242.17, d.f.= 188, p < .01, χ2/d.f. 

= 1.29, comparative fit index (CFI) = .94, non-normed fit index (NNFI) = .93, root mean square 

error of approximation (RMSEA) = .06, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .066).

Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) method was used to evaluate discriminant validity. In this 

method, the amount of variance within the scale must be greater than the amount of variance 

between two variables to find support for discriminant validity. Table 5.5 presents correlations 

among focal constructs and square root of the AVEs on the diagonal. The results show 

discriminant validity because the square roots of the AVEs on the diagonal are greater than the 

corresponding latent variable correlations in the same row and column. Overall, survey measures 

show reliability and validity. Thus, survey measures except environmental turbulence which are 

included in main study were not changed. However, due to low loading and low reliability of 

items on environmental turbulence, the measures on environmental turbulence were changed. 

Specific changes are reported in the main study section.

Common Method Variance (CMV) of Pretest 

I collected survey data on customer participation and new product success from the same 

 

source (i.e., NPD managers) at the same time using the same method. Thus, common method 

variance (CMV) may inflate the relationships between the variables of interest (Podsakoff et al. 

2003). I conducted two tests to examine the possibility of common method bias. 

 

First, a Harman one-factor test was employed to determine whether a single factor would 

account for a large part of the variance of all manifest variables (Podsakoff et al. 2003). The one- 

factor model yielded a chi-square of 761.67 with d.f. = 209 (see Model 3: Method only in Table 

5.6), and a model (see Model 2: Trait in Table 5.6) in which I specified all relevant constructs 

individually led to a significant improvement in fit (Δχ2 = 519.5 with 21 difference in d.f., p 

< .01). This suggests that CMV is not a serious threat. 

 

Second, I added a method factor to the measurement model to see if it improves the fit of 

a measurement model. To test whether CMV exists, four models were employed and their chi-

squares were compared. They are Model 1: Null model (there are no factors underlying the data), 

Model 2: Trait model (in which all items are going to the corresponding factors), Model 3:  

Method only model (in which all of the items are loaded on one factor, i.e., CMV factor), and 

Model 4: Trait and Method model (in which a method factor is added to a trait model). The 

results of the chi-square difference tests are presented in Table 5.6. The logic behind these chi-

square difference tests is that if CMV exists, the method only model (Model 3) should explain 

significantly more variance in the data than the trait model (Model 2). As shown in the two chi-

square difference tests, both these conditions hold, indicating that CMV exists in the data. 

However, the common method variance accounts for only 5% of the variance. Given that 

Williams, Cote, and Buckley (1989) found that an average of 25% of the variance in the articles 

 

81 


 
they examined was due to CMV, only 5% of CMV does not seem to be a serious threat to the 

 

results.

Main Study Sample and Data Collection of Study 2 

 

The survey data for the main study were collected from NPD managers in a Qualtrics 

online panel. Like Zoomerang which was utilized for the pretest, Qualtrics also offers 

commercial online panels composed of people who are pre-recruited to participate in online 

surveys. I collected survey data from NPD managers in a Qualtrics online panel who have 

worked on a NPD project in which end customers have been involved to some extent to co-

produce new products. Survey data for the pretest and the main study were collected from 

different online panels because I wanted to avoid the possibility that the same sample responds to 

both the pretest and main study. Therefore, a Qualtrics online panel was purchased for the main 

study. The NPD managers in the Qualtrics online panel represent a wide variety of industries.  

The NPD managers were first screened by using a qualification question: “Have you 

worked on a New Product Development (NPD) project in which end customers have been 

involved to some extent to co-create new products? Co-creation of new products could involve 

end customers providing new products ideas or new features, participating in designing new 

 

82 


 
products, engineering new products, testing new products before launch, and commercializing 

new products.” Only qualified NPD managers who responded yes to the screening question are 

asked to respond to survey questions based on the most recently launched NPD project in which 

 

end customers were involved.  

For the main study, a total of 2,096 managers who work on NPD teams were contacted to 

take the survey. From these, 289 questionnaires were collected from January 17 to January 23, 

2012, resulting in a response rate of 13.79%. To examine the possible effects of nonresponse bias 

(i.e., people who respond differ substantially from those who do not, Armstrong and Overton 

1977), responses from people responding later were compared with those from people 

responding readily (Ferber 1948). The logic behind this approach is that people responding later 

are assumed to be more similar to nonrespondents (Ferber 1948). Given that the second 

invitation letter which asks online panels to take survey was sent on January 20, and 90.29% of 

responses were collected by January 19, responses collected between January 20 and January 23 

were viewed as late responses. The results of ANOVA test indicate that there is no significant 

difference between early responses and late responses in terms of NPD team size, firm size, 

industry, department, and length of time that the respondent has worked in the company. Thus, 

nonresponse bias is not a serious threat for this study.  

First, out of the 289 completed questionnaires, questionnaires which were completed in 

less than 4 minutes were removed, resulting in 206 valid questionnaires. Given that the average 

length of survey is 7 minutes after excluding several extreme cases, 4 minutes is considered to be 

a reasonable cutoff. Following Cook’s distance (Cook 1977, 1979) and Bollen and Jackman’s 

(1990) guideline to cut off outliers (i.e., Cook’s distance > 4/n, n = the number of observations), 

extreme values were identified. As a result, 45 extreme values were deleted and final analyses 

 

83 


 
were based on a total of 161 samples. Knowledge level of the particular NPD project that 

respondents in the final sample had in mind when completing the questionnaire is above 5 on a 

7-point scale and the average level of knowledge is 6.04 on a 7-point scale (S.D. = .745). Table

Because all the measures in the main study except environmental turbulence were utilized 

without changes from the pretest (see Table 5.8), I only explain the revised measures of 

environmental turbulence in this section. With regard to environmental turbulence, because items 

to assess environmental turbulence demonstrated low loadings, SMCs, and reliability among 

items in the pretest, items on environmental turbulence were revised. The three items involved in 

the pretest were: (1) Customers’ preferences change quickly over time in the market for this 

product (2) Market demand and consumer tastes in the market were unpredictable, and (3) 

Actions of competitors in the market were unpredictable. It is possible that the measures of 

environmental turbulence did not work well because the measure attempts to capture different 

 

85 


 
two concepts: speed of change and unpredictability of customers’ preferences. Taking into 

account this problem, Moorman and Miner (1997) utilized items of environmental turbulence 

 

which only focus on the pace of changes in the industry.  

In addition, the items included in the pretest only focused on turbulence from the 

customers or market perspective. However, Moorman and Miner (1997) pointed out that 

environmental turbulence needs to be assessed by combining technological with market 

turbulence. In line with Moorman and Miner (1997), Im and Workman (2004) also emphasized 

the impact of technological turbulence on new product performance. Following these suggestions, 

four items which reflect the pace of technological change and customer preference changes were 

introduced for the main study (see Table 5.8 for the specific measures). These items were 

adapted from measures of Jaworski and Kohli (1993) and Moorman and Miner (1997).

Measure Assessment of Main Study 

To test reliability and validity of the measures for the main study, confirmatory factor 

analysis (CFA) was conducted. After dropping two items from customer participation, two items 

from NPD team’s co-production capability, one item from product individuality, one item from 

product innovativeness, two items from product quality, and two items from environmental 

turbulence, the selected measures provided good explanations for each construct. Table 5.9 

presents the results of CFA.

Note: χ2 = 258.01, d.f.= 181, p < .01, χ2/d.f. = 1.43, comparative fit index (CFI) = .98, non-
normed fit index (NNFI) = .97, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .05, 
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .05 
 

 

As seen in Table 5.9, all item loadings are positive and statistically significant, indicating 

unidimensionality and establishing convergent validity (Anderson 1987). In addition, there are 

no negative variances (Bagozzi and Yi 1988). Average variance extracted (AVE) of all latent 

variables is above .50 and both Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliabilities (CR) of all focal 

constructs are well above the recommended threshold of .70 (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). 

Squared multiple correlations (SMC) are also above .50 except CP6 (SMC = .49). The measures 

exhibit good psychometric properties overall. In addition, the fit of the CFA model containing all 

constructs is excellent (χ2 = 258.01, d.f. = 181, p < .01, χ2/d.f. = 1.43, comparative fit index (CFI) 

= .98, non-normed fit index (NNFI) = .97, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 

= .05, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .05).  

Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) method was used to evaluate discriminant validity. Table 

5.10 presents the correlations among focal constructs and square root of the AVEs on the 

diagonal. The results show discriminant validity because the square roots of the AVEs on the 

diagonal are greater than the corresponding latent variable correlations in the same row and 

column. Overall, survey measures for the main study show reliability and validity.

Common Method Variance (CMV) of Main Study 

Common method variance (CMV) may inflate the relationships among the variables of 

 

interest because survey data on customer participation and new product success were collected 

from the same source (i.e., NPD managers) at the same time using the same method (Podsakoff 

et al. 2003). To examine the possibility of common method bias, a Harman single-factor test and 

several chi-square difference tests were conducted. 

 

First, a Harman one-factor test was employed to determine whether a single factor would 

account for a large part of the variance of all manifest variables (Podsakoff et al. 2003). The one- 

factor model yielded a chi-square of 987.40 with d.f. = 209 (see Model 3: Method only in Table 

5.11), and a model (see Model 2: Trait in Table 5.11) in which I specified all relevant constructs 

individually led to a significant improvement in fit (Δχ2 = 729.39 with 28 difference in d.f., p 

< .01). This suggests that CMV is not a serious threat. 

 

Second, I added a method factor to the measurement model to see if it improves the fit of 

a measurement model. To test whether CMV exists, four models were employed and their chi-

squares were compared. They are Model 1: Null model (there are no factors underlying the data), 

Model 2: Trait model (in which all items are going to the corresponding factors), Model 3: 

Method only model (in which all of the items are loaded on one factor, i.e., CMV factor), and 

Model 4: Trait and Method model (in which a method factor is added to a trait model). The 

results of the chi-square difference tests are presented in Table 5.11. The logic behind these chi-

square difference tests is that if CMV exists, the method only model (Model 3) should explain 

significantly more variance in the data than the trait model (Model 2). As shown in the two chi-

square difference tests, both these conditions hold, indicating that CMV exists in the data. 

However, the common method variance accounts for only 5% of the variance. Given that 

 

93 


 
Williams, Cote, and Buckley (1989) found that an average of 25% of the variance in the articles 

they examined was due to CMV, only 5% of CMV does not seem to be a serious threat to the 

 

results.

Hypotheses Test for Market Adoption in Study 2 

 

Before testing hypotheses based on survey data, RESET was conducted in order to 

examine the presence of non-linearity between customer participation and market adoption 

(Ramsey 1969). Similar to the approach implemented in Study 1, control variables, independent 

variables, and all possible two-way interactions among independent variables were introduced in 

the model (Aiken and West 1991; Baer and Oldham 2006; Luo and Donthu 2006; Ritter and 

Walter 2012). The result of the RESET indicates that the model does not include non-linearity (F 

(3,126) = 1.05, p > .10). This result is not consistent with that from Study 1 and implies that the 

inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and market adoption may not be 

generalized to various industries but is caused by technology-focused industry characteristics 

such as an open source software context. In technology-driven industries which require 

specialized knowledge, end customers who may lack a deep understanding of technological 

knowledge may not help improve new product success (Vanhaverbeke and Du 2010). Rather, 

 

94 


 
ordinary customer participation in the development process of technological products may be 

detrimental to new product development. In a similar vein, von Hippel (1986) also contended 

that lead users differ from ordinary users. Due to this characteristic, it may be more likely to find 

the inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and market adoption in an 

 

open source software context. 

 

To investigate this possibility, I broke down survey data into subsamples according to 

industry and then examined nonlinearity between customer participation and market adoption 

only using the IT (Information Technology) industry subsample. Table 5.12 indicates the results 

of hierarchical regression analysis using the IT industry subsample. Even though this subsample 

includes just 66 NPD projects, the possibility of a curvilinear relationship between customer 

participation and market adoption is found.

Because the main purpose of Study 2 is to test generalizability of the results in Study 1, 

hypotheses tests in Study 2 are based on a total survey sample including various industries. 

Given that the results of RESET demonstrate absence of nonlinearity in the model, I only tested 

the moderating roles of stage, breadth, NPD team’s co-production capability, product 

individuality, and product price positioning in the linear relationship between customer 

participation and market adoption.  

To test the hypotheses, a moderated hierarchical regression approach was used as 

suggested by Aiken and West (1991). First, all predictor variables were centered to reduce 

multicollinearity among the predictor variables and the interaction term. In the first step, the 

control variables of product quality, environmental turbulence, firm size, NPD size, product 

innovativeness, and industry_dummy were entered into the regression equation. Next, in step 2, 

the main effect variables of customer participation, stage, breadth, co-production capability, 

product individuality, and product price positioning were introduced. Finally, in step 3, linear 

two-way interactions between customer participation and moderators were introduced. Table 

5.13 demonstrates the results of the moderated hierarchical regression analysis.

As seen in Table 5.13, the additions of independent variables in step 2 (ΔR2 = .130, ΔF = 

6.579, p < .01) and interactions in step 3 (ΔR2 = .054, ΔF = 3.565, p < .01) explain substantial 

variance in market adoption. Overall, the results from Tables 5.13 and 5.14 are consistent. When 

end customers are engaged in the NPD process (β = -.196, p < .05 in Table 5.13, b = -.284, p 

< .05 in Table 5.14), how broadly end customers are involved in co-production (β = .229, p < .05 

in Table 5.13, b = .075, p < .05 in Table 5.14), and product individuality (β = .239, p < .01 in 

Table 5.13, b = .250, p < .01 in Table 5.14) moderated the linear relationship between customer 

 

98 


 
participation and market adoption. To better understand the significant moderating relationships, 

moderating plots were generated where high and low levels of stage, breadth, and product 

individuality respectively were indicated as those above and below one standard deviation from 

 

the mean (Aiken and West 1991).  

Figure 5.1 graphically displays the moderating role of stage between customer 

participation and market adoption. Following simple slope analyses (Aiken and West 1991), 

customer participation has significant positive impact on market adoption for both high (b = .534, 

t = 7.442, p < .01) and low stage (b = .662, t = 7.402, p < .01). However, contrary to my 

prediction that market adoption will be greater when the ratio of customers participation in early 

stages as opposed to later stages is high (H3), the findings demonstrate that the impact of 

customer participation on market adoption was greater when the ratio of customer participation 

in later stages is high. This result implies that customers’ involvement in making the new product 

error-free in later stages can make a greater contribution to improve market adoption. These 

findings are reflected in a comment by the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs: “We do no market 

research. We don’t hire consultants” (Smith 2010). Customers’ contributions in the early idea 

generation stage improve market adoption. However, customer involvement in early stages may 

not lead to as great improvement in market adoption as we expected.

Figure 5.2 displays the moderating impact of breadth between customer participation and 

 

 

 

 

market adoption. When customer participation is low, customer participation in a limited area 

can improve market adoption more than diverse involvement of customers in a wide variety of 

co-production activities. In contrast, when customer participation is high, broad customer 

participation can benefit more from customers’ insights on various aspects including new 

features, design, and product testing. However, when customers participate in a limited area to a 

 

100 


 

 
great extent, companies have a hard time coordinating customer participation and selecting 

optimal product problem. Thus, for low breadth, customer participation decreases market 

adoption. Overall, these findings are consistent with H5, which assumes that broad customer 

participation helps improve market adoption. A simple slope analysis indicates that two simple 

slopes for high breadth and low breadth are significantly different from zero respectively (for 

high breadth: b = .753, t = 7.077, p < .01 and for low breadth: b = -.404, t = - 4.391, p < .01).

The findings on the moderating effect of product individuality between customer 

participation and market adoption provide support for H9, which predicts that the impact of 

customer participation on market adoption is greater as product individuality increases. As seen 

in Figure 5.3, for high product individuality, the effect of customer participation on market 

adoption is always higher than that for low product individuality. This result shows that when 

companies introduce highly individualized products, getting insights on customer needs directly 

from customers is more important. In addition, the results of a simple slope test indicate that the 

simple slope for high product individuality is significant at the .01 level (b = .523, t = 6.067, p 

< .01), whereas the simple slope for low product individuality is barely significant at the .10 

level (b = .196, t = 1.868, p < .10).

Hypotheses Test for Time to Market in Study 2 

RESET was implemented in order to examine the presence of non-linearity between 

customer participation and time to market (Ramsey 1969). The result of RESET shows that the 

model does not include non-linearity (F (3,135) = 1.10, p > .10). Thus, I tested the moderating 

effects of stage, breadth, and NPD team’s co-production capability in the linear relationship 

between customer participation and time to market. 

 

To test interactions, a moderated hierarchical regression was implemented. The results 

are shown in Table 5.15. Each step demonstrates significant improvement in explaining variance 

of time to market. In step 1, several control variables which may influence time to market were 

first entered and explained 22.7% of the variance of time to market (ΔR2 = .227, ΔF = 5.434, p 

< .01). In step 2, independent variables including customer participation, stage, breadth, and 

NPD team’s co-production capability were introduced (ΔR2 = .050, ΔF = 2.474, p < .05). Finally, 

interactions between customer participation and three moderators (i.e., stage, breadth, and co-

production capability) were entered; these improved R2 significantly (ΔR2 = .049, ΔF = 3.429, p 

< .05). As seen in Table 5.15, only breadth of customer participation moderated the relationship 

between customer participation and time to market (β = .227, p < .05). This finding is in line 

with that from the regression analysis using robust standard errors as shown in Table 5.16.

Following Aiken and West (1991), a moderating plot was created where high and low 

levels of breadth were indicated as those above and below one standard deviation from the mean. 

Figure 5.4 graphically displays the moderating role of breadth of customer participation. 

Consistent with H6 which predicts that the impact of customer participation on time to market 

increases as breadth of customer participation increases, customer participation always shows a 

longer time until product launch for high breadth than for low breadth. In addition, for high 

breadth, customer participation increases time to market (simple slope result: b = .449, t = 3.944, 

 

105 


 
p < .01), whereas for low breadth, customer participation does not increase time to market 

 

(simple slope result: b = -.128, t = -.976, p > .10).

CHAPTER 6 

DISCUSSION 

In this chapter, I first discuss the findings from the two studies conducted in this 

dissertation. Next, I discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the results. Finally, I 

address some of the potential limitations and future research directions. 

Discussion of Findings 

 

In this section, the findings from the hypothesis testing of the two studies are combined 

and compared. Table 6.1 compares the hypothesis testing results from Studies 1 and 2. 

 

In Hypothesis 1, I proposed an inverted U-shaped relationship between customer 

participation and market adoption. The finding from the open source software context provided 

support for the curvilinear relationship, whereas the result from NPD managers in a wide variety 

of industries did not support the hypothesis. Rather, the result from Study 2 indicates that 

customer participation continuously increases market adoption, emphasizing the merits of 

customer participation. However, further analysis using an IT subsample of survey data revealed 

that customer participation increases market adoption up to a point, but decreases it beyond that 

point. Taken together, the inverted U-shaped relationship between customer participation and 

market adoption cannot be generalized to all industries. However, in technology-intensive 

industries, the involvement of ordinary customers who may lack technology expertise and 

experience, is more likely to deteriorate new product success (Magnusson 2009; Vanhaverbeke 

and Du 2010; von Hippel 1986).

The findings on Hypothesis 2, which assumes a non-linear relationship between customer 

 

 
 

participation and time to market, can be interpreted similarly to the findings for Hypothesis 1. 

Overall, the results from both studies did not reveal any non-linear relationship between the two. 

In Study 2 including a wide variety of industries, the effect of customer participation on time to 

market is so diverse that I cannot find any significant pattern between customer participation and 

time to market. This finding seems to reflect well differences among industries. For example, 

Melton and Hartline (2010) found that the extent of customer involvement in the new service 

development process improves project efficiency (i.e., the new service had less launch time than 

planned) through service marketability and launch preparation. Consistent with this result, 

Carbonell, Rodriguez-Escudero, and Pujari (2009) also found that customer involvement in new 

service development has a positive effect on innovation speed. Taken together, customer 

participation in the new service development context may continuously decrease time to market, 

but involving end customers in the new technology intensive product development process may 

slow down time to market. Given that survey data from Study 2 includes services industries as 

well as manufacturing and IT, finding no pattern between customer participation and time to 

market may be expected.   

In contrast, in the technology-driven industry of Study 1, there was a significant positive 

impact of customer participation on time to market. In other words, involving customers in the 

development process of a technology-intensive product generates serious costs in terms of time 

elapsed until product launch. Overall, the results on Hypotheses 1 and 2 imply that the 

relationships between customer participation and new product success depend on industry 

characteristics; especially in technology-intensive industries, the costs to engage end customers 

into the NPD process should be thoroughly considered.

Hypothesis 3 proposes that the effect of customer participation on market adoption will 

 

increase as the ratio of customer participation at early stages to late stages increases. While the 

moderating effect of stage was not significant in Study 1, the result from Study 2 showed a 

significant moderating role of stage though the direction of the moderation was contrary to my 

expectation. I had hypothesized that customer participation in early stages as opposed to in late 

stages has greater impact on improving market adoption, but customer involvement in late 

phases had a more positive effect than customer participation in early stages. In fact, both early 

and late stages of the NPD process have great potential to improve market adoption from 

different perspectives (e.g., Lettl, Herstatt, and Gemuenden 2006; Yli-Renko and Janakiraman 

2008). This is because in the early idea generation phase, customers are the source of new 

product ideas (Von Hippel 1978) and in the later testing phase of new product development, 

customers can serve as the testing ground for the new product’s relevance and acceptance in a 

variety of user contexts (Yli-Renko and Janakiraman 2008). The findings of this dissertation 

suggest that making new products error-free and hassle-free through engaging customers in later 

stages can make a greater contribution to improving market-related performance. 

 

With regard to Hypothesis 4, which predicted that the effect of customer participation on 

time to market will increase as the ratio of customer participation at early stages to late stages 

increases, the result from Study 1 provided support. When customers are involved in early stages 

as opposed to in late stages, customer participation tends to slow down the entire development 

process. Even though there has been little research on comparing magnitudes of the effects, some 

previous research on the effects of interdepartmental integration (e.g., joint involvement of 

marketing-R&D in the NPD process) on new product development time suggests a potential 

 

111 


 
moderating effect of stage between customer involvement and new product development time 

 

(Song, Thieme, and Xie 1998; Swink and Song 2007).  

 

In both studies, breadth of customer participation turned out to be a powerful moderator 

between customer participation and new product success. The findings of Studies 1 and 2 

provided support for Hypothesis 5, which proposed that the effect of customer participation on 

market adoption will increase as the breadth of customer participation increases. Involving 

customers in a wide variety of co-production activities rather than customer involvement in just a 

few activities can achieve greater market adoption.  

However, these results need to be understood by taking into account the influence of 

broad customer participation on time to market. As shown in the supporting results from Study 2 

for Hypothesis 6, customer participation in a wide variety of activities slows down time to 

market more than customer participation in a limited number of activities. In sum, broad 

customer participation contributes to improving market adoption but is detrimental in terms of 

time to market. Therefore, the decision whether a company should engage end customers broadly 

or not fully hinges on the company’s goal for the new product development process. Should 

companies launch new products as soon as possible in the market and take first-mover advantage 

or should they launch better products at the cost of development time? Given that there has been 

a dearth of research dealing with the breadth of customer participation, the findings of 

Hypotheses 5 and 6 provide new insights to managers. 

Hypothesis 7 assumed that the effect of customer participation on market adoption will 

increase as the NPD team’s co-production capability increases. The results from Study 1 

supported the hypothesis by showing that for low co-production capability, the relationship 

between customer participation and market adoption follows an inverted U-shape, whereas for 

 

112 


 
high co-production capability, customer participation appears to continuously improve market 

adoption. In other words, because NPD teams with a high level of co-production capability have 

enough ability to effectively leverage customers’ insights from diverse ideas, they can improve 

 

market adoption without experiencing the costs of high customer participation. 

However, I did not find a significant moderating effect of a NPD team’s co-production 

capability between customer participation and time to market in both studies. One potential 

reason to reject the hypothesis may be related to the concept of co-production capability itself. In 

this dissertation, NPD team’s co-production capability was defined as a NPD team’s ability to 

leverage customers’ input to develop the new product in the NPD process. More specifically, co-

production capability is composed of two processes: recognizing the value of input from 

customer participation and effectively applying it to new products. Because this concept itself 

focuses on a NPD team’s ability to find valuable ideas from customer participation and apply it 

to new products, the influence of co-production capability on new product success was found 

only for market adoption.  

Another possible reason for the lack of effect is that there may be conflicting effects of 

co-production capability between customer participation and time to market. For instance, 

because NPD teams with a high co-production capability do not have to spend more time in 

searching for appropriate ideas and applying them to new products, they may speed up time to 

market. In contrast, compared with neglecting all input from customers, recognizing and 

applying a few valuable ideas may require substantial time. Given these two conflicting 

arguments, the moderating effect of co-production capability in the link between customer 

participation and time to market may disappear. 

 

113 


 

 

The contextual effects of product individuality and price positioning strategy were tested 

only in Study 2. The finding indicated that in markets where highly individualized products are 

offered, the effect of customer participation on market adoption is much greater, supporting 

Hypothesis 9. This result is consistent with the implication from Homburg, Müller, and 

Klarmann (2011), who discovered that the effect of customer orientation with regard to sales 

performance is higher for salespeople selling individualized products. As such, insights directly 

from end customers are more valued when selling individualized products. However, the finding 

of Study 2 did not provide support for Hypothesis 10, which predicted that the effect of customer 

participation on market adoption will increase as the product price level increases.  

Theoretical Implications 

This dissertation provides several theoretical implications. First and foremost, this 

dissertation adds theoretical explanation to why customer participation does not always lead to 

desirable new product outcomes by combining service-dominant logic with coordination theory. 

Drawing on service-dominant logic, previous literature in marketing on customer participation 

has focused on showing desirable effects of customer participation (e.g., Alam 2002; Hoyer et al. 

2010; O’Hern 2009). Roles of customers as information sources and co-developers in the NPD 

process have provided the main arguments for desirable contributions of customer participation 

(Fang 2008; Nambisan 2002).  

However, coordination theory demonstrates that co-production in the NPD process that 

involves more than two actors (i.e., NPD teams and end customers) sharing resources and 

assigns tasks to co-develop new products is a context that demands harmonious coordination 

among actors and activities. If the coordination mechanisms are neglected or do not work well, 

co-production would be stopped without developing a new product or end up with sub-optimal 

 

114 


 
performance even when co-production achieves its goal (i.e., new product development). 

Specifically, this dissertation makes theoretical contributions by explaining potential risks of co-

production in the NPD process utilizing the concept of coordination neglect and coordination 

 

theory.  

Coordination neglect explains some psychological barriers such as partition and 

component focus and inadequate communication and translation that get in the way of 

integrating and coordinating interdependent work into a common goal (Heath and Staudenmayer 

2000). According to the concept of coordination neglect, because integrating and coordinating 

divided work is by its very nature hard for NPD teams to do, NPD teams and customers neglect 

the importance of coordination. As a consequence, a co-production project between a NPD team 

and customers may end without developing their planned new product or a company which 

initiated a co-production project may not be able to use the results of co-production. In the real 

world, NPD projects accompanying co-production are frequently stopped or abandoned. 

SourceForge.net data also confirms that a substantial number of projects do not release even the 

first package of new software for a long time and are left alone without any development 

activities. As such, this dissertation provides additional explanation by pointing out the risk that 

co-production projects may end up with nothing due to coordination neglect. This topic has been 

ignored by researchers.      

Coordination theory explains why even when NPD teams overcome coordination neglect 

and develop new products, the results through co-production may not be desirable outcomes 

(Malone and Crowston 1994). Local optimal may not be global optimal, and the coordination 

mechanism itself requires substantial time and effort, so the outcomes generated through co-

production could be better or worse. In sum, this dissertation provides theoretical reasons why 

 

115 


 
customer participation in the NPD process does not always lead to better outcomes by combining 

 

service-dominant logic with the concept of coordination neglect and coordination theory. 

Second, this dissertation developed a new concept, NPD team’s co-production capability, 

and empirically tested its moderating effect in the link between customer participation and new 

product outcomes. While extant literature put an emphasis on how to engage customers in more 

co-production activities by building places for customer participation, researchers have recently 

begun to pay attention to a company’s ability to recognize and leverage good ideas out of diverse 

inputs through customer participation (Bendapudi and Leone 2003; Fuchs, Prandelli, and 

Schreier 2010). As customer participation becomes more common, merely involving customers 

in the NPD process is not enough to lead to desirable new product outcomes. The firm’s ability 

to manage and effectively take advantage of customer contribution in the co-production process 

can determine the amount of benefits or costs of customer participation.  

In particular, the concept of co-production capability adds value to the co-production 

literature in that it is distinct from a firm’s coordination capability. Effectively and efficiently 

coordinating and integrating interdependent work in the co-production process is important if the 

firm wishes to maximize the benefits from co-production. However, the capability to recognize 

and leverage valuable customer input in co-production is differentiated from coordination 

capability. The findings of Study 1 confirmed the importance of a NPD team’s co-production 

capability in improving market adoption by showing that companies with a high level of co-

production capability continuously increase the positive effect of customer participation on 

market adoption, whereas companies with a low level of co-production capability cannot obtain 

any benefits from customer participation beyond a certain point.

Managerial Implications 

There are several managerial implications from the findings of this study. First, the main 

 

effect of customer participation on new product success hinges on the type of industry. The 

findings for Hypotheses 1 and 2 from both studies suggest that the costs of customer 

participation can be greater in technology-driven industries. Do the results mean that companies 

in these industries should not engage ordinary customers who lack technology expertise but 

should recruit lead users who have substantial expertise? The answer is not that simple. In terms 

of market adoption and time to market, involving ordinary end customers in the NPD process 

may generate coordination problems and increase the complexity of the development process. 

However, Magnusson (2009) argues that ordinary customers compared with lead users have a 

high propensity to produce radical ideas that challenge the prevailing dominant logic in the 

market. Ordinary users are not expected to contribute ideas that can be directly put into the new 

product development process; rather, ordinary customer involvement may be regarded as a 

process whereby a company learns about radical ideas and is inspired to innovate. Therefore, 

even in technology-driven industries, involving end customers in the co-production process 

should be still considered as an alternative value creation process for creating radical products.  

 

Second, this dissertation provides managers with insights into at which stage in the NPD 

process end customers should be involved. The findings suggest that NPD mangers need to place 

more emphasis on engaging end customers in the later NPD phases such as product testing and 

commercial testing in order to improve market adoption and shorten time to market. Previous 

literature on co-production has focused on customer involvement in the fuzzy front end of the 

NPD process (e.g., Khurana and Rosenthal 1997; Kim and Wilemon 2002; Reid and de Brentani 

2004) because understanding customer’s needs and judging the marketability of new ideas have 

 

117 


 

 
been regarded as key success factors. Despite the lack of academic interest in customers’ 

contribution in later NPD phases, the results of this dissertation show that companies can stably 

increase market acceptance without the hassle of co-production. Thus, managers need to pay 

more attention to maximizing the benefits of customer participation by engaging customers in 

validating the product concept, eliminating performance problems prior to market introduction, 

serving as an effective sales promotion device (Dolan and Matthews 1993). However, the results 

do not negate the customer contribution in early stages but highlight the value of customer 

participation in later phases. 

 

Third, the findings suggest that companies need to implement co-production differently 

in terms of breadth of customer participation according to their NPD project’s goal. The results 

indicate that customer participation in a wide variety of co-production activities can contribute to 

improving market adoption but may be detrimental to time to market. Thus, the decision on how 

broadly end customers should be involved in the NPD process should be in line with the NPD 

team’s goal. When the goal is to launch better products and improve market adoption, companies 

need to engage end customers in a wide variety of co-production activities with the costs of time 

to market. In contrast, when the goal is to introduce new products as soon as possible and benefit 

from first-mover advantage, involving customers in just a few co-production activities which 

really require end customers’ input would be a better strategy.   

 

Finally, the findings highlight that every company does not have to engage customers in 

its NPD process. However, companies which offer highly individualized products in the market 

need to more effectively utilize customer participation in the NPD process. The result for 

Hypothesis 9 suggests that for less individualized products, the effect of customer participation 

on market adoption did not significantly increase, whereas for highly individualized products, 

 

118 


 
customer participation significantly improves market adoption. Given that engaging customers in 

 

the NPD process requires additional resources and time, only companies which offer highly 

individualized products need to utilize co-production as an alternative NPD process. 

Limitations and Future Research 

 

Some of the limitations of this dissertation provide opportunities for future research. First, 

future researcher need to test the costs of customer participation found in Study 1 in other high 

technology industries. The results of both studies indicate that the effects of customer 

participation vary from industry to industry and there is a possibility that it generates more risks 

in technology-driven industries. Even though the results of survey data using an IT sub-sample 

confirmed this possibility, I could not test the moderating effect of breadth and co-production 

capability in the curvilinear relationship between customer participation and market adoption 

found in Study 1 using an IT sub-sample due to the small sample size (i.e., 66 IT sub-sample). 

Therefore, the inverted U-shaped relationship and the interactions in the curvilinear relationship 

in the new software development process should be confirmed by testing the generalizability of 

Study 1 using either survey data from technology-driven industries or other secondary data from 

high technology industries.  

 

Second, this dissertation did not pay attention to the interactions among moderators. Even 

though this dissertation thoroughly examined the interactions between customer participation and 

various moderators such as stage, breadth, and co-production capability, it hardly investigated 

the possibility of interactions among moderators. For instance, stage may be associated with 

breadth. In this dissertation, breadth of customer participation was measured by the simple sum 

of the number of activities (stages) which end customers actively engaged in. In other words, 

each co-production activity was assumed to have the same effect on new product success from 

 

119 


 
the breadth perspective. However, even though NPD teams have the same level of breadth, the 

effect of breadth on new product success may differ according to the stages at which end 

customers are involved. For example, there are two NPD projects whose level of breadth of 

 

customer participation was 1. One of these projects engaged customers only in the ideation stage, 

whereas the other engaged customers only in the product testing stage. These two NPD projects 

may show different effects of the breadth on new product success. Thus, the interactions among 

moderators included in the dissertation should be considered for future study. 

 

Third, this dissertation needs to investigate the impact of customer participation on new 

product outcomes other than market adoption and time to market. For example, new product 

innovativeness, defined as the degree to which new product developed through co-production is 

novel to the industry (Fang 2008), could be considered as another interesting outcome variable. 

According to Magnusson (2009), end customer participation in the NPD process can be a good 

opportunity to obtain ideas about radical new products. In addition, at which stage and how 

broadly end customers are involved in the NPD process may moderate the relationship between 

customer participation and new product innovativeness. For instance, customer participation in 

the early ideation stage contributes to introducing radical new products, whereas customer 

participation in the later product testing phase contributes to introducing incremental new 

products. While involving customers broadly can facilitate radical innovations due to a diversity 

of customer ideas, narrow customer participation may relatively contribute to incremental 

innovations.   

 

Finally, future researchers need to investigate the mechanism by which customer 

participation influences new product outcomes. This dissertation did not investigate any potential 

mediators between customer participation and market adoption and time to market. As in the 

 

120 


 
findings of Melton and Hartline (2010) which showed the mediating roles of service 

marketability and launch preparation between customer participation and new service outcomes 

in the new service development context, there may be mediators in the direct link.
