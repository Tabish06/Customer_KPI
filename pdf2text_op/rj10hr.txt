Abstract
This study examined the relation between personality and three dimensions of job 
performance (in-role performance, creativity, and citizenship behavior) under differing 
levels  of  job  scope. The  basic  premise  was  that  higher  job  scope  would  facilitate 
performance for those who were dispositionally inclined toward a particular dimension 
of  performance  and  damage  the  performance  of  those  who  were  dispositionally 
disinclined. Among 383 work-unit dyads in 11 organizations, some support was found 
for  the  predicted  interactions  between  Big  Five  personality  traits  and  job  scope  in 
predicting various aspects of performance.

The Big Five model, which is the most accepted personality taxonomy (Judge and Ilies, 
2002), is to a large extent responsible for the revival of research on personality in orga-
nizations. In the beginning of this revival, much research simply concentrated on probing

the main effects of personality on various organizational behaviors, most notably indi-
vidual performance. However, gradually, an interactionist approach was accepted, recog-
nizing that ‘complex human behavior is regulated by interactions that depend intimately 
on situational conditions (stimulus variables) as well as on dispositions’ (Mischel, 1977: 
334). This shift was prompted by a mixture of scientific curiosity, some disappointment 
in the size of personality–behavior relations, and meta-analytic findings of much unex-
plained variation in these relations, suggesting the operation of moderators.

The interactionist trend took one of three approaches. One was to look for occupational 
moderators of personality-behavior relation in meta-analyses (e.g. Meyer et al., 2009). 
For example, is conscientiousness a robust predictor of performance across occupations? 
Or, is extraversion a particular asset for salespeople? A second approach examined the 
moderating  role  of  very  specific  job  characteristics.  Thus,  Barrick  and  Mount  (1993) 
found that autonomy moderated the relation between two Big Five traits (conscientious-
ness and extraversion) and job performance. Similarly, Stewart (1996) provided evidence 
that reward structure and extraversion jointly affected sales performance. A third approach 
can be seen in some of the research in the domain of person–organization fit. This research 
attempts to gauge how fit between personality and organizational culture affects individ-
ual behavior and attitudes (e.g. Judge and Cable, 1997).

Each of these approaches has contributed to our understanding of people in the work 
context. However, each has limitations that led us to focus on job scope as a potential 
moderator, with scope being defined by a job’s degree of richness, challenge, and com-
plexity. We chose to focus on job scope because the overall design of a job is one of the 
most  important  contextual  variables  affecting  work  behavior  (Pervin,  1989;  Tett  and 
Burnett, 2003; Tett et al., 1991, 1999). Given this, it is rather surprising that job scope has 
not explicitly been investigated as a moderator of personality-behavior effects. This is 
especially so given the fact that personality tests are most often used to make selection 
and placement decisions that pertain to ‘whole’ jobs, not to a ‘whole’ organization or to 
a discrete job characteristic. Although the occupational moderator approach does con-
cern whole jobs, it offers little in the way of diagnostic capacity for why person–situation 
interactions  occur  or  how  to  generalize  across  specific  jobs.  Job  scope  offers  both  of 
these  advantages. Thus,  the  primary  goal  of  the  current  research  was  to  examine  the 
viability of job scope as a moderator of personality–performance relations, recognizing 
that this might vary according to the type of performance under consideration.

Funder  (2001)  argues  that  to  better  understand  personality  effects  we  need  to  pay 
attention to all elements of the triad comprising personality, situation, and behavior. This 
study does this by investigating the joint effects of personality and job scope, a contex-
tual  variable,  on  three  forms  of  performance–in-role  job  performance,  creativity,  and 
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). The specific decision to study in-role perfor-
mance, creativity, and OCB was motivated by three factors. First, reliable in-role perfor-
mance,  exceeding  regular  role  requirements,  and  engaging  in  creative  or  innovative 
activities are all necessary for the continued vitality of organizations (Katz, 1964) and it 
is not obvious that individuals are equipped by temperament to be equally facile at per-
forming  these  complementary  roles.  Second,  available  meta-analyses  reveal  weak  to 
modest  connections  between  personality  and  job  performance  (Barrick  and  Mount, 


Raja and Johns

1991), citizenship behaviors (Organ and Ryan, 1995), and creativity (Feist, 1998) signal-
ing the likely presence of moderators. Third, the use of multiple dependent variables is 
important to highlight the role of contextual (e.g. job design) effects (Johns, 2006). As 
will be seen below, this is because situational requirements for various work behaviors 
intersect with job design to produce trait-related situational cues.

Job scope as potential moderator
The Job Characteristics Model (JCM) is one of the most widely studied models of job 
design (Fried and Ferris, 1987; Xie and Johns, 1995). In the JCM, core job characteristics 
comprising  skill  variety,  task  identity,  task  significance,  autonomy,  and  feedback  are 
summarized by job scope (Hackman and Oldham, 1976). The model suggests that higher 
scope jobs being rich, complex, and challenging lead to positive work outcomes such as 
internal work motivation through three critical psychological states (experienced mean-
ingfulness, responsibility, and knowledge of results) (Fried and Ferris, 1987; Hackman 
and Oldham, 1980). The basic core of the model enjoys good empirical support, and the 
effects of job scope on internal motivation, job satisfaction, and job performance are well 
documented (Humphrey et al., 2007; Johns et al., 1992).

Although  Hackman  and  Oldham  were  open  to  the  likely  interaction  of  individual 
traits with job scope, growth-need strength is the only trait that has received research 
attention,  with  decidedly  mixed  results  across  criterion  variables  (Fried  and  Ferris, 
1987). No study to the best of our knowledge has explicitly considered job scope as a 
moderator in the relation between the Big Five and work outcomes. We acknowledge 
that the study of discrete job characteristics as moderators (e.g. autonomy, Barrick and 
Mount,  1993)  is  useful  for  job  design  purposes.  However,  we  are  interested  taking  a 
holistic view  of job  scope and  exploring  how  it could  potentially  have an  effect  on 
personality–behavior  relations.  Moreover,  much  interest  in  personality  stems  from  its 
role in selection and placement, for which global job scope seems more pertinent. Also, 
from a more theoretical viewpoint, the unit of analysis of overall job scope seems more 
commensurate with most conceptualizations of person–environment (PE) and person–
organization (PO) fit.

It is plausible to consider personality as a moderator in job scope versus outcomes 
relations, and doing so would follow from the traditional job characteristics model. However, 
our intent in the current study was to focus the unexplained variance in personality–
outcomes relations. As stated earlier, the unexplained variance in meta-analyses on per-
sonality–outcome relations (e.g. Barrick and Mount, 1991; Judge and Ilies, 2002) clearly 
indicates the potential for moderators. Therefore, we believe that it is theoretically trac-
table to position job scope as a moderator while acknowledging that interaction effects 
are statistically symmetrical.

Our specific predictions that job scope will moderate the relation between personality 
and critical work behaviors are predicated on 1) the concept of trait activation (Tett 
and Burnett, 2003; Tett and Guterman, 2000) and 2) conceptions of individual differ-
ences in stress reactions (Penley and Tomaka, 2002). Drawing on Murray’s (1938) idea 
of the ‘press’ that situations exert on individuals to behave in trait-related ways and

the principles underlying the fit theories (PE fit: Murray, 1938; Pervin, 1968; and PO fit: 
Chatman, 1989; O’Reilly et al., 1991), Tett and colleagues suggest that trait activation is 
the process by which people express their traits behaviorally if presented with trait-related 
situational cues. In other words, dispositions are most likely to manifest themselves when 
primed by contextual requirements (House et al., 1996).

When people are dispositionally inclined toward a particular aspect of performance 
(in-role, OCB, or creativity), elevated job scope will have a salutary effect on the con-
tribution of personality to that performance dimension. The exact details of this vary 
according to the particular dimension. However, for example, the merits of autonomy 
and  diverse  stimulation  (via  skill  variety)  for  creativity  have  long  been  recognized. 
The essential point is that the degree of fit between the person and the situational cues 
for a particular type of performance is enhanced by the opportunities inherent in ele-
vated job scope, given the person and the performance dimension in question. Thus, 
positive  trait-relevant  cues  stem  from  the  co-occurrence  of  particular  performance 
cues and job scope.

When people are dispositionally disinclined toward a particular type of performance, 
elevated job scope has an inhibiting effect because it complicates an already demanding 
situation and can also evoke stress and anxiety. For instance, Xie and Johns (1995) dem-
onstrated that people who perceived low demands–abilities fit experienced considerable 
stress and anxiety under more versus less complex jobs. In this case, negative trait rele-
vant cues stem from the co-occurrence of incompatible performance cues and high job 
scope, and what are opportunities for some become threats for others. These threats stem 
from the responsibility and accountability that characterize higher scope jobs in conjunc-
tion  with  the  cues  to  exhibit  work  behaviors  for  which  one  is  less  well  prepared  or 
inclined.

Hypotheses
Conscientiousness    Conscientiousness  is  associated  with  adjectives  such  as  efficient, 
organized,  reliable,  planful,  thorough,  responsible,  and  risk  averse  (Goldberg,  1990). 
These  sub-traits  reflect  two  major  facets,  achievement  and  dependability  (Mount  and 
Barrick, 1995). Conscientiousness is considered one of the most consistent personality 
predictors of performance (Meyer et al., 2009). From the situation trait relevance model 
(Tett and Burnett, 2003) perspective, we argue that a high scope job will be internally 
motivating  for  conscientious  individuals  because  they  are  achievement  oriented  and 
focused on growth and development. Jobs high in scope can provide conscientious indi-
viduals with enhanced autonomy, more achievement prospects, and challenge, resulting 
in  improved  performance.  Barrick  and  Mount  (1993)  found  that  conscientiousness 
resulted in better performance when job autonomy, a significant dimension of job scope, 
was high. Also, conscientious people are expected to see feedback as an opportunity to 
improve performance and plan for future job requirements. Overall, higher job scope and 
situational requirements for in-role performance will provide trait-relevant cues resulting 
in a strengthened association between conscientiousness and job performance. On the 
contrary, low job scope will signal limited opportunities for achievement and weaken the 
translation of conscientiousness into performance.

Hypothesis 1: The relation between conscientiousness and job performance will be more highly 
positive under higher levels of job scope.

Tett et al. (1999) asserted that the very attributes that make conscientiousness a desirable 
trait could also make it a liability. Thus, the risk averse, methodical, and planful nature of 
highly conscientious employees could be a hindrance in situations that demand high toler-
ance  for  ambiguity.  As  creativity  entails  less  structure  and  greater  uncertainty,  it  is 
expected that conscientious individuals’ desire for planning, control, meticulousness, and 
the certainty of high performance will gain heightened importance under such circum-
stances. Meta-analytic evidence suggests a negative relation between conscientiousness 
and creativity (Feist, 1998), and Gellatly (1996) found that high conscientiousness led to 
higher goals only when people were certain that they could perform well. High scope jobs 
are associated with uncertainty, challenge, and less structure. We argue that in an attempt 
to retain their situational control and manage uncertainty, planning and risk avoidance are 
more important for conscientious people than coming up with novel solutions. Therefore, 
high job scope in combination with requirements for creativity will provide conscientious 
individuals with negative cues triggering their risk averseness. They will prefer to focus 
on established routines instead of being creative.

Hypothesis 2: The relation between conscientiousness and creativity will be more highly nega-
tive when job scope is higher.

Among the Big Five personality dimensions, conscientiousness is a positive predictor of 
OCB (Meyer et al., 2009; Organ and Ryan, 1995). The most compelling arguments can 
be  drawn  for  a  positive  association  between  OCB  directed  toward  the  organization 
(OCBO) and conscientiousness. For example, a dependable, organized, and efficient per-
son is likely to exhibit outstanding attendance, comply with norms, and in general exhibit 
elevated responsibility. Evidence suggests a positive relation between conscientiousness 
and compliance, a major facet of OCBO (Organ and Ryan, 1995). However, our conten-
tion is that conscientious individuals will exhibit elevated levels of OCBOs when their 
job is cognitively more demanding. Being risk averse, conscientious people will become 
more focused and organized to avoid possible failure. They will organize themselves to 
maintain high performance and be more punctual and responsible employees. Therefore, 
we expect that when job scope is high, the expected positive relation between conscien-
tiousness and OCBO will be stronger. As conscientiousness is not a socially described 
trait, there is little reason to argue for its relation with OCBI.

Hypothesis 3: The relation between conscientiousness and OCBO will be more strongly posi-
tive when job scope is high.

Extraversion    Ambition and sociability are the two primary components that characterize 
extraversion (Hogan, 1983). Extraverts are thus described as sociable, talkative, ener-
getic, enthusiastic, assertive, and optimistic. They seek excitement, are active and impul-
sive, and desire praise, social recognition, status, and power (Costa and McCrae, 1992; 
Hogan and Hogan, 1992; Watson and Clark, 1997).


986   

Human Relations 63(7)

Meta-analyses show that extraversion is positively related to performance in jobs that 
require interpersonal skills, such as management and sales (Barrick and Mount, 1991; 
Salgado,  1997),  although  much  variance  in  correlations  across  studies  remains  unac-
counted  for.  Barrick  and  Mount  (1993)  illustrated  how  greater  autonomy,  one  of  the 
components of job scope, interacted with extraversion to enhance job performance. As 
extraverts  strive  for  positions  of  power  and  status,  they  will  see  prospects  of  gaining 
greater social significance by performing well on jobs that are important and have con-
siderable influence on other people’s lives. Extraverts are expected to perceive enriched 
jobs as an opportunity for growth and economic gain, resulting in improved performance. 
On the contrary, jobs low in scope should be seen as limiting by extraverts, leading to 
decreased performance. Job scope will influence PE fit for extraverts such that the fit 
will be good when extraverts have challenging and complex jobs and bad when they 
have simple and repetitive jobs.

Hypothesis 4: Job scope will moderate the relation between extraversion and job performance 
such that the relation will be more strongly positive when job scope is high.

There  is  evidence  for  a  positive  relation  between  extraversion  and  creativity  (Feist, 
1998). Individual factors such as self-confidence and achievement striving, which pre-
dict  creativity  (Oldham  and  Cummings,  1996),  are  also  major  facets  of  extraversion 
(McCrae  and  John,  1992).  Extroverts  are  expected  to  exhibit  more  creative  behavior 
when job scope is high. Research on creativity reveals that contextual factors such as 
autonomy, resources, and diverse stimulation facilitate creativity (Amabile et al., 1996). 
These factors are inherent in higher scope jobs. Research also shows that in comparison 
with routine, repetitive, and restrictive jobs, extraverts perform better on tasks that prom-
ise greater freedom (Barrick and Mount, 1993) and reduced routine (Barrick and Mount, 
1991). It is, therefore, expected that extraverts will perform more creatively when job 
scope is high.

Hypothesis 5: Job scope will moderate the relation between extraversion and creativity such 
that it will be more strongly positive when job scope is high.

Available  research  on  the  dispositional  correlates  of  OCB  does  not  support  a  clear 
link with extraversion. However, the finding that people with high PA, a trait closely 
associated with extraversion, perform more OCBs (Organ and Konovsky, 1989) pro-
vides some evidence for a link. OCBO includes behaviors such as outstanding atten-
dance, compliance with norms, and being a responsible employee. Although extraverts 
are expected to be among the better performers owing to their high energy and ambi-
tion,  they  are  also  carefree,  impulsive,  and  mischievous  (Goldberg,  1990),  which 
leads to higher absenteeism (Judge et al., 1997b). Extraverts, being spontaneous and 
social, may not tend to fall in line with organizational norms and might be seen as 
careless and at times rude by others. The finding by Hogan and Hogan (1989) that 
sociability was negatively associated with employee reliability provides some support 
for these arguments. Similarly, Judge et al. (1997b) contended that extraverts may see 
work as an obstacle to spending time with family and friends. Such a view of work 


Raja and Johns 

987

does not bode well for extra-role behavior. A highly social person might not be very 
interested in going out of the way to help the organization at the expense of his or her 
personal  life. Although  the  social  aspect  of  extraverts  suggests  that  they  would  be 
willing to help their colleagues and friends at work, we believe that this would only 
occur when job requirements are less challenging. Being ambitious and materialistic, 
extraverts will likely divert their energy to in-role performance when the job is higher 
in scope, putting help to others as a second priority. In other words, the level of job 
scope conditions the occurrence of the two ‘faces’ of extraversion. We therefore sug-
gest the following hypotheses.

Hypothesis 6a: Job scope will moderate the relation between extraversion and OCBO such that 
it will be more strongly negative when job scope is high.

Hypothesis 6b: Job scope will moderate the extraversion – OCBI relation such that it will be 
positive when job scope is low and negative when job scope is high.

Neuroticism    Associated  with  negative  emotions  (Penley  and  Tomaka,  2002),  people 
high  in  neuroticism  are  self-pitying,  anxious,  less  trusting,  depressed,  and  nervous 
(McCrae and John, 1992). Neuroticism is closely related to negative affectivity (NA) 
(Watson and Tellegan, 1985), and researchers have often used the variables interchange-
ably (e.g. Erez and Judge, 2001).

Meta-analyses  suggest  that  neuroticism  is  negatively  related  to  job  performance 
(Barrick and Mount, 1991; Tett et al., 1991). However, the results also suggest the pres-
ence of moderators. We argue that job scope will provide trait-relevant situational cues 
for neurotics such that it will play a moderating role in the trait–performance relation. 
Judge  et  al.  (1997a)  argued  that  neuroticism  is  negatively  related  to  self-esteem  and 
people with high neuroticism are averse to in-role performance cues, particularly on jobs 
that are cognitively challenging and demand initiative and a variety of skills. Having a 
preference for clearly defined, simple, low risk jobs, neurotics will feel threatened when 
a job requires taking control and facing less structured situations. Therefore, a complex 
job will arouse feelings of helplessness and anxiety among them, leading to negative 
outcomes such as poor performance and low creativity. High scope jobs provide high 
autonomy  and  put  fewer  constraints  on  behavior  (Hackman  and  Oldham,  1980). The 
negative relation between neuroticism and performance is expected to be most evident 
when the job demands control, decision-making, and initiative. On the contrary, a simple 
and  clearly  defined  job  with  clearly  defined  behavioral  expectations  will  weaken  the 
effects of the trait on behavior.

Hypothesis 7: The relation between neuroticism and performance will be more strongly nega-
tive for high scope jobs.

Oldham and Cummings (1996) assert that broad interests, attraction to complexity, intu-
ition, tolerance for ambiguity, and self-confidence relate positively to creativity in a vari-
ety of domains. The markers of neuroticism suggest that it should be negatively related 
to  creativity,  an  inference  partially  supported  by  the  meta-analytic  findings  of  Feist 


988   

Human Relations 63(7)

(1998),  which  also  indicated  the  presence  of  moderators.  Neuroticism  is  negatively 
related to several correlates of creativity, and people high on this trait are not psychologically 
well equipped to embrace ambiguity (Judge et al., 1997a). They lack confidence and are 
highly vulnerable to situations that demand initiative (Judge et al., 1997a). It is expected 
that the negative connection between neuroticism and creativity will be exacerbated if 
the situation provides cues that activate feelings of nervousness and anxiety. High scope 
jobs require greater self-confidence, initiative, uncertainty tolerance, and accountability 
(Hackman and Oldham, 1980). Therefore, job characteristics can provide trait-relevant 
cues to neurotic individuals such that a high scope job could be seen as an excessive 
burden, resulting in the worsening of PE fit, which in turn will magnify the negative 
effects of neuroticism on creativity.

Hypothesis 8: The relation between neuroticism and creativity will be more highly negative 
when job scope is high.

Although the relation between neuroticism and citizenship behaviors is not well sup-
ported  by  available  research  (Organ  and  Ryan,  1995),  there  are  theoretical  grounds  to 
expect a negative association between neuroticism and OCB. High neuroticism is reflected 
in  a  lack  of  trust  in  others,  suspicions  concerning  others’  motives,  and  high  anxiety 
(Goldberg, 1990). Such people are expected to be wary of their colleagues and managers. 
Some empirical evidence suggests that neuroticism might be negatively associated with 
both forms of OCB. For example, a few studies (e.g. Smith et al., 1983) have reported 
neuroticism or its correlate NA to be negatively related to altruism, a component of OCBI. 
Also,  neuroticism  is  positively  related  to  transactional  contracts,  perceived  contract 
breach, and felt violation (Raja et al., 2004), which are negative correlates of citizenship 
behaviors (Kickul et al., 2004; Robinson et al., 1994). We believe that when the job is 
cognitively demanding and requires self-control, the trait anxiety of people high on neu-
roticism will make them feel even more vulnerable and anxious. High job scope com-
bined with citizenship cues or requests will provide neurotics with negative trait relevant 
cues, decreasing the probability of their exhibiting any form of citizenship behavior.

Hypothesis 9a: Job scope will moderate the relation between neuroticism and OCBO such that 
it will be more strongly negative when job scope is high.

Hypothesis 9b: Job scope will moderate the relation between neuroticism and OCBI such that 
it will be more strongly negative when job scope is high.

Agreeableness and openness to experience    Agreeables are flexible, forgiving, coopera-
tive, friendly, trusting, good-natured, and generous (Costa and McCrae, 1992; Goldberg, 
1990; McCrae and John, 1992). Openness to experience is described by adjectives such 
as  imaginative,  cultured,  curious,  original,  broad-minded,  intelligent,  and  artistic 
(Goldberg, 1990). Among the Big Five dimensions, agreeableness and openness to expe-
rience tend to have unstable factor structures (Hough and Ones, 2001) and are somewhat 


Raja and Johns 

989

rarely related to organizationally significant variables. For example, Barrick and Mount 
(1991: 21) note, ‘results for agreeableness suggest that it is not an important predictor 
of job performance, even in those jobs containing a large social component (e.g. sales 
or management)’. Agreeableness also fails to exhibit a significant relation with OCB 
(Organ  and  Ryan,  1995),  an  ostensibly  logical  correlate.  Similarly,  Judge  and  Bono 
(2000) mention that openness to experience is the least studied trait both inside and out-
side of organizations, and its exact internal structure has been a subject of controversy 
among researchers (Hough and Ones, 2001). Therefore, we have not offered hypotheses 
for agreeableness and openness to experience. However, both traits were examined for 
exploratory purposes.

Method
Data collection and sample
To avoid problems associated with common method bias and social desirability, we col-
lected data using self- and peer-reports for different variables in the study. While person-
ality variables and all demographic data were measured with self-reports, job scope and 
the behavioral outcomes were tapped through peer-reported data.

The self- and peer-report versions of the survey were similarly numbered for pairing 
of received responses. The cover letter on both questioners explained the purpose and 
scope of the study, assured them of anonymity of the responses, and that the decision to 
participate in the study was voluntary. The letter on the self-report version requested the 
respondents to complete the attached survey and hand over the peer-report version to a 
colleague after filling in their name on the top slip, which would be removed by their 
peer before handing in the completed questionnaire to ensure anonymity. They were to 
select a peer from a designated cohort, which was a group of employees working in the 
same department for at least a year and according to their manager were in a position to 
comment on the respondents’ behaviors. Completed responses were personally collected 
by the first author or his representative.

Data were collected through onsite administration of a survey in 11 different organi-
zations.  The  business/operations  of  the  organizations  included  engineering  services, 
manufacturing  (e.g.  paint,  consumer  goods,  and  petrochemical  products),  financial/
banking services, and operations of governmental departments. A total of 600 distributed 
questionnaires yielded 435 returns for a response rate of 72.5 percent. After removing 
incomplete  questionnaires  and  ones  with  missing  peer-reports,  383  complete  useable 
pairs of responses (64% effective response rate) were available for analysis.

The sample represented more than 60 occupations at all levels ranging from entry 
level office work to top management. The educational qualifications of the respondents 
ranged from high school to doctoral degrees with 72 percent of the respondents having 
formal  university  education.  Ninety-three  percent  of  the  respondents  were  male.  The 
mean age of the respondents was 35.6 (SD = 9.38) years with average tenure of 9.72 
(SD = 8.10) years.

Measures
The surveys were conducted in English, as it is taught as a compulsory course in school 
and is the medium of instruction for all higher education in Pakistan. Thus, it is well 
understood by the great majority of the working population, and in broad use at work, 
especially by those in our sampling frame. Past workplace research conducted in Pakistan 
using questionnaires in English (e.g. Butt and Choi, 2006; Butt et al., 2005; Raja et al., 
2004) affirms our choice concerning the language of the questionnaire.

Personality    We used the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI; John et al., 1991) to measure 
personality. This is a frequently used, robust self-report measure of the Big Five (e.g. John 
and Srivastava, 1999; John et al., 1991; Vaidya et al., 2002). In the BFI, eight items mea-
sure neuroticism and extraversion, nine items pertain to conscientiousness and agreeable-
ness, and 10 items assess openness to experience. All items have anchors of 1 = strongly 
disagree to 5 = strongly agree, and higher mean values reflect higher levels of the corre-
sponding trait. Examples of the statements corresponding to each of the five traits include 
(I see myself as someone who . . .) ‘Has a forgiving nature’ for agreeableness, ‘Does a 
thorough job’ for conscientiousness, ‘Is talkative’ for extraversion, ‘Gets nervous easily’ 
for neuroticism, and ‘Is inventive’ for openness to experience.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and reliability estimates revealed that removing 
three  items  each  from  the  measures  of  agreeableness  and  openness  resulted  in  an 
improved  factor  structure,  as  these  items  loaded  below  .40  on  their  intended  factors. 
Removing these items resulted in substantial gains in reliability (.60 to .70 for agreeable-
ness and .60 to .72 for openness). This is not surprising considering that these two dimen-
sions have been reported to have weak factor structures and reliabilities (McCrae and 
Costa, 1997). Therefore, we dropped three items each from the agreeableness and open-
ness scales and used a 38-item shortened version of the BFI. The internal consistency 
reliabilities were .70 for agreeableness and neuroticism, .72 for conscientiousness and 
openness to experience, and .69 for extraversion. These correspond well to those reported 
for  similar  cultures  such  as  India,  Indonesia  and  other  non-US  samples  (e.g.  Benet-
Martinez and John, 1998; Schmitt et al., 2008).

Job scope    Peer-ratings of job characteristics were assessed with the Job Rating Form 
(JRF),  the  observer  version  of  the  well  validated  self-report  Job  Diagnostic  Survey 
(JDS; Hackman and Oldham, 1976). Like the JDS, the JRF measures five core job char-
acteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback), and 
an ‘additive’ index was used to express job scope, averaging the responses across the 
five dimensions. A high score reflects high scope. We dropped four items for improved 
factor structure and scale reliabilities. The full and the shortened measures were highly 
correlated (r = .96, p < .001), and no major differences were observed in the results 
using the full and the shortened scales. Good reliability was achieved for overall job 
scope (α = .81).

Job performance and citizenship behaviors    Job performance and citizenship were mea-
sured  using  peer-reports  to  a  21-item  measure  developed  by  Williams  and Anderson 


Raja and Johns

(1991).  Seven  items  each  tapped  in-role  performance,  OCBI,  and  OCBO.  The  rating 
scale  had  anchors  of  1  =  almost  never  to  5  =  almost  always,  and  a  high  mean  score 
reflected a high level of the corresponding behavior. The results of confirmatory factor 
analysis (CFA) revealed that four items did not load on any of the factors above a modest 
cut-off  point  of  .30.  These  items  also  had  low  factor  loadings  in  the  Williams  and 
Anderson study. Therefore, the four items were removed to improve the factor structure 
and scale reliabilities. The correlation between the performance and OCBO scales 
(r = .66, p < .01) warranted caution. We thus performed a CFA to ascertain discriminabil-
ity between the two measures. Results showed that a two-factor model (c2 = 129.56, 
d.f. = 43, CFI = .92, GFI =.93, AGFI = .90, RMSEA = .07) was superior to a single-factor 
model (c2 = 150.51, d.f. = 44, CFI = .90, GFI = .92, AGFI = .89, RMSEA = .08). Retained 
items  included,  ‘Adequately  completes  assigned  duties’  and  ‘Fulfills  responsibilities 
specified in job description’ for job performance, ‘Helps others who have been absent’ 
and ‘Goes out of the way to help new employees’ for OCBI, and ‘Gives advance notice 
when unable to come’ and ‘Conserves and protects organizational property’ for OCBO. 
The job performance and OCBI scales had reliabilities of .76, while the reliability of the 
OCBO measure was .70.

Creativity    Creativity was assessed using peer-ratings on a three-item measure devel-
oped by Oldham and Cummings (1996). Ratings with anchors of 1 = very little to 7 = 
very much were averaged such that high values represented higher creativity. This mea-
sure provides definitions of creativity, adaptability, and practicality as part of each item. 
Examples of the items included, ‘How CREATIVE is this person’s work? (Creativity 
refers to the extent to which the employee develops ideas, methods, or products that are 
both original and useful to the organization)’ and ‘How ORIGINAL and PRACTICAL is 
this person’s work? (Original and practical refers to developing ideas, methods, or prod-
ucts that are both totally unique and especially useful to the organization.)’ The reliability 
of this scale was .88.

Considering  that  the  behavioral  outcomes  and  job  scope  were  obtained  from  the 
same source, we performed CFAs to ascertain the discriminant validity of all the vari-
ables.  First,  we  compared  a  four-factor  model  with  performance,  creativity,  OCBO, 
and  OCBI  as  independent  factors  with  a  single  factor  constrained  model.  Results 
showed clearly that the unconstrained four-factor model (c2 = 435, d.f. = 160, CFI = 
.90, GFI = .90, AGFI = .88, RMSEA = .07) was a much superior fit of the data as 
compared with the single factor model (c2 = 1056.4, d.f. = 188, CFI = .60, GFI = .74, 
AGFI = .69, RMSEA = .12). In addition, we compared the two-factor model and the 
forced single factor model for every possible paring of the job scope and the outcomes 
variables. In every case the two-factor model fit the data better than the single factor 
constrained model.

Control  variables    Although  individual  differences  in  demographic  variables  such  as 
gender, age, and job tenure are often associated with organizational behavior, age and job 
tenure had no bearing on the outcome behaviors in our dataset. However, one-way analy-
ses of variance revealed significant differences among men and women in job perfor-
mance (F = 5.37, p < .02) and OCBI (F = 2.80, p < .09) with men having slightly lower 


992

performance and higher OCBI than women. Therefore, we controlled for the effects of 
gender using dummy coding. Differences were also observed across organizations in job 
performance (F = 4.41, p < .001), creativity (F = 3.05, p < .001), and OCBO (F = 5.07, 
p < .001). Post-hoc tests revealed that these differences stemmed from four of the orga-
nizations. Using dummy coding, we controlled for the effects of these four organizations 
in all substantive analyses.

Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix for all variables.

Regression analyses
Moderated hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Results 
of  theses  analyses  are  shown  in Table  2.  Baron  and  Kenney  (1986)  suggested  that 
moderation is confirmed if the product term of independent variable and moderator 
(interaction)  has  significant  effects  on  the  dependent  variable  controlling  for  the 
effects of the independent and the moderator variables. Therefore, control variables 
were entered into the equation followed by the Big Five traits in the second step, and 
job scope in the third step. Finally, in the fourth step, the cross products of each of the 
Big Five traits and job scope were added to the equation. We used centered values of 
independent and moderator variables for moderated regression analyses. For signifi-
cant  interactions,  we  calculated  the  high  and  low  values  of  the  moderator  variable 
using  the  M  ±  SD  rule.  We  then  plotted  the  regression  lines  using  unstandardized 
regression coefficients.

Job  performance    Hypotheses  1,  4,  and  7  predicted  the  joint  effects  of  personality 
and job scope on job performance. Table 2 shows that, controlling for the effects of 
organization and gender, only conscientiousness (β =.11, p < .05) and extraversion 
(β  =.10,  p  <  .03)  were  significantly  related  to  job  performance,  both  in  a  positive 
direction. Results in Table 2 show that only one interaction term involving job scope 
and neuroticism (β = -.14, p < .01) was significantly related to job performance. The 
interaction effect, as shown in Figure 1, was such that neuroticism had a negative rela-
tion  with  performance  when  job  scope  was  high  and  a  positive  relation  when  job 
scope was low. These results lend support to Hypothesis 7. Hypotheses 1 and 4 were 
not confirmed, as interactions for conscientiousness and extraversion failed to achieve 
acceptable significance levels.

Creativity    Hypotheses 2, 5, and 8 predicted combined effects of personality and job 
scope on creativity. Results of the moderated regression analyses presented in Table 2 
show that peer-reported job scope interacted with extraversion (β = -.07, p < .05) and 
neuroticism (β = -.08, p < .05) to predict creativity. The directions of the significant 
interactions  are  shown  in  Figures  2  and  3.  Both  extraversion  and  neuroticism  were 
negatively  related  to  creativity  when  peer-reported  job  scope  was  high  and  slightly 
positively related when it was low. These findings for neuroticism provide support for

Hypothesis 8. However, the results are contrary to Hypothesis 5, which predicted a 
stronger  positive  relation  between  extraversion  and  creativity  for  high  job  scope. 
Hypothesis 2 was not confirmed as the interaction term for conscientiousness failed to 
achieve significance. Among the Big Five only openness to experience (β =.22, p < .001) 
was a significant predictor of creativity. Also, Table 2 shows that the openness x scope 
interaction term was significant for creativity (β = -.10, p < .03). Somewhat counterin-
tuitively, openness to experience was strongly positively related to creativity when job 
scope was low.

OCB    Hypotheses  3,  6,  and  9  predicted  the  combined  effects  of  personality  and  job 
scope on citizenship behaviors. Table 2 shows that interactions of job scope with agree-
ableness (β = .13, p < .02), extraversion (β = -.09, p < .04), and neuroticism (β = -.11, 
p < .03) were significant for OCBI. For OCBO interactions of job scope and conscien-
tiousness (β = -.09, p < .07), extraversion (β = -.09, p < .04), and neuroticism (β = -.10, 
p < .04) were significant.

The significant interactions for OCBI are shown in Figures 4 and 5, while those for 
OCBO are presented in Figures 6, 7, and, 8. Figures 4, 5, 7, and 8 show that the relations 
of  both  extraversion  and  neuroticism  with  OCBI  and  OCBO  were  positive  when  job 
scope was low and negative when job scope was high. These results provide support for 
Hypotheses 6a, 6b, 9a and 9b. The direction of the significant conscientiousness x job 
scope  interaction  for  OCBO  is  depicted  in  Figure  6.  Interestingly,  and  contrary  to 
Hypothesis 3, conscientiousness was positively related to OCBO when job scope was

(β = .15, p < .01) had a significant relation with OCBI. However, for OCBO three 
traits  emerged  as  the  significant  predictors.  Conscientiousness  (β  =  .11,  p  <  .05), 
openness to experience (β = .09, p < .06), and neuroticism (β = .10, p < .05) were 
positively related to OCBO.

Discussion
Overall, of the 10 hypotheses, five were confirmed (H6a, 6b, 7, 8 and 9), three were not 
supported (H1, 2 and 4), and findings were contrary to two of the hypotheses (H3 and 4). 
More specifically, our results pertaining to the hypothesized relations can be summarized 
as follows. All three predictions concerning neuroticism were confirmed. That is, neuroti-
cism was more strongly negatively related to in-role performance, creativity, and OCBs 
when job scope was higher. Our two predictions concerning extraversion and OCBs were 
also confirmed. Job scope moderated the relation between extraversion and both dimen-
sions of OCB (O & I) such that it was more strongly negative when job scope was higher. 
Three of our predictions were not confirmed, in that conscientiousness and extraversion 
did not interact with job scope to predict in-role performance, and conscientiousness did 
not interact with job scope to predict creativity. Finally, two interactions occurred that were 
contrary in form to our predictions, in that the conscientiousness–OCBO relation was more 
strongly positive under low (rather than high) job scope, and high scope impeded rather 
than facilitated the connection between extraversion and creativity.

Theoretical implications
Previous examinations of situational moderators of the connection between personality 
and work behavior have generally concentrated on discrete characteristics of jobs (e.g. 
autonomy) or broader characteristics of the organization (e.g. organizational culture). In 
this study we examined an intermediate contextual unit of analysis in investigating the 
moderating role of job scope, arguably one of the most well researched means of describ-
ing jobs. This is important, because selection and placement, especially when it relies on 
personality tests, is most generally oriented toward ‘whole’ jobs.

Overall, our results provide a reasonable support for the interactionist view of person-
ality, especially the ‘trait activation’ (Tett and Burnett, 2003) idea. Trait activation theory 
suggests that situations are unlikely to activate all traits in a similar fashion. It is rather 
the fit between the stimulus situation and the trait that results in a certain type of behavior 
or variation in it. This is what our results tend to suggest. In particular, higher job scope 
shows some tendency to facilitate performance for those who are dispositionally inclined 
toward a particular dimension of performance and damage the performance of those who 
are dispositionally disinclined.

An interesting finding concerns our results pertaining neuroticism. Although they con-
firmed our hypotheses, an interesting trend of cross-effects was observed in all cases such 
that the relation (neuroticism versus performance, OCBs, and creativity) was negative or 
non-existent when scope was high and positive when scope was low. These results high-
light that, contrary to the widely negative view of neuroticism, this trait might not lead to 
undesired outcomes under all situations. Rather, when the situation is not threatening (e.g. 
low scope job), neurotics not only exhibit an improving trend in job performance and 
creativity but also tend to show improving OCBOs and exhibit more OCBIs.

Although owing to limited research history we did not present formal hypotheses for 
agreeableness and openness to experience, we included both traits in our study for explor-
atory purposes. While agreeableness did not emerge as a robust correlate of organizational 


1000 

 

Human Relations 63(7)

behaviors in general, results for openness to experience were interesting and insightful. Not 
only was openness related to creativity and OCBs, but also, interestingly, openness had 
more impact on creativity under conditions of low job scope suggesting that openness to 
experience appears to pay a creativity premium when the job itself is less interesting. We 
believe these results contribute to our understanding of the relatively neglected personality 
traits of agreeableness and openness to experience from the Big Five taxonomy. Moreover, 
our  study  enhances  the  advancement  of  knowledge  in  theory  testing/building  in  non-
Western cultures. The study provides concrete evidence that job scope–behavior relations 
and the Big Five taxonomy hold up well in a non-Western culture, such as Pakistan.

Practical implications
Our  results  provide  useful  insights  for  managers  and  consultants,  especially  in  the 
domain of selection and placement. Organizations select employees into a whole job, not 
discrete dimensions or aspects of a job. Similarly, promotion entails a complete job, not 
some single job facet such as autonomy or skill variety. Therefore, although research 
focusing on dimensions of jobs can be helpful for job design, our results are useful when 
it comes to placing individuals with similar skills but different personalities on various 
jobs.  For  instance,  some  of  the  potential  problems  that  employee  neuroticism  might 
entail  can  be  ameliorated  by  placement  in  lower  scope  jobs.  Moreover,  the  idea  that 
extraverts will invariably do well when it comes to more challenging and demanding 
tasks has to be qualified. If our contention that extraverts move to protect self-interest 
when a job becomes complex and demanding is true, then managers have to ensure that 
extraverted individuals are provided with safety mechanisms or help that ensures their 
self-interest so that their energy and ambition could be deployed on a demanding job.

Another aspect of this study that can provide insight for practitioners is that it was 
conducted in a developing country. Multinational organizations frequently have to deploy 
managers educated in Western cultures in developing countries. The results of this and 
similar studies inform such managers if the theories they studied will hold up well in 
countries  such  as  Pakistan.  For  example,  although  we  did  not  explicitly  test  the  Job 
Characteristics Model, the basic principles of this model would seem to apply in Pakistan 
given our results indicating the usefulness of job scope in predicting important work-
related outcomes. Similarly, our results show that the trait activation concept, built on 
person–job fit theory, would also be applicable there. This would certainly improve manag-
ers’ confidence in interventions devised around these concepts in developing countries.

Limitations and directions for future research
One of the limitations of the study is the between-jobs design. This design can potentially 
confound job type and its correlates with job scope. To examine the implications of this, 
we reran our key analyses controlling for occupational level, which we coded from job 
titles. No material changes in the results reported here were observed. Thus, our findings 
appear to generalize across job levels. This said, the research design does not strictly 
allow for within-job inferences as to what might happen if job scope were increased or 
decreased within a particular job category via job redesign principles. However, much 


Raja and Johns 

1001

interest in personality in the workplace has stemmed from its potential use in selection 
and  placement,  where  the  job  is  taken  as  fixed.  Our  results  speak  to  this  application. 
Finally, we used ‘generic’ measures of in-role performance and creativity. The indicators 
of these variables might have differed across jobs or organizations and thus built some 
noise into our results.

Another issue that deserves attention is the modest reliabilities of the personality scales 
(.69–.72), because such reliabilities can undermine the detection of significant interac-
tions in moderated regression (Stone, 1988). A workplace study conducted in Pakistan 
using the NEO FFI (Raja et al., 2004) also revealed somewhat attenuated reliabilities for 
the Big Five dimensions. Another study (Schmitt et al., 2008) conducted in similar cul-
tures (e.g. India, Indonesia) reported a similar trend of slightly lower levels of reported 
reliabilities. It is possible that there are cultural manifestations in the expression of the self 
which make the use of the Big Five measures, mostly developed in the US, relatively less 
reliable in Pakistan. For example, our mean score for agreeableness was higher than the 
US norms reported for this trait by Benet-Martinez and John (1998). In a collectivist cul-
ture people may be more inclined to report being agreeable owing to social desirability. 
Also, items such as ‘I am a person who has an assertive personality’ would be susceptible 
to social biases in a culture where being individually assertive is seen as undesirable.

On the other hand, the use of independent measures of in-role performance, OCBs, 
creativity, and job scope rules out some problems associated with method bias, adding 
credibility to the results. A field study with 383 paired responses (self- and peer-reports) 
with respondents belonging to a wide variety of occupational groups, levels, and organi-
zations, is rare. Also, the use of multiple behavioral criteria provided a unique opportu-
nity for exploring how the Big Five mapped onto the requirements for different forms of 
contribution to the organization. For example, the results show that neuroticism results 
in improving performance when job scope is low. Finally, in the OB literature, there has 
been intermittent criticism of research concerning job design that did not incorporate a 
wide enough range of jobs to sample a fair and adequate range of values in job charac-
teristics. Aware of this problem, we chose to enhance the variance in jobs sampled by 
choosing several research sites. This not only incorporated a wider range of jobs, but also 
improved the generalizability of our results across organizations and job types.

Future research could focus on developing more elaborate models similar to the one 
examined in this study. For example, over and above the task characteristics captured by 
Oldham  and  Hackman’s  (1976)  model,  more  recently  charted  social  and  knowledge 
characteristics of jobs could be incorporated (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006). Also, it 
would be fascinating to examine how individuals with various personality traits respond 
to changes in job design, effected either by job redesign or job reassignment. The inclu-
sion of other situational factors at the group and organizational level could direct focus 
to the person–situation fit issue. For example, exploring how organizational structure or 
group pressures influence the personality–outcome relation could result in useful find-
ings. Another area for future research is to employ narrow traits along with broad per-
sonality  factors  to  determine  their  relative  importance  as  predictors  (see  Raja  et  al., 
2004). Such studies would on one hand allow researchers to explore the relative useful-
ness of the Big Five against narrower traits and, on the other hand, can provide useful 
insights into possible interactions among the Big Five and narrow traits. For example,

one could explore how the attitudes and behaviors of extraverts with high equity sensi-
tivity differ from extraverts with low equity sensitivity.

To conclude, the interactionist view of personality seems to have much more to offer 
to enhance our understanding of individual behavior in varying situations. We provide 
some convincing evidence in support of the trait activation idea whereby interactions of 
the Big Five traits and job scope predict performance, creativity, and citizenship behav-
iors differently highlighting the usefulness of individual level situational variables such 
as job scope in enhancing predictability of individual traits.
