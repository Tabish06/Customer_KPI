abstraCt: While integrating information flows between internal organizational func-
tions and across partner firms is widely acknowledged as a contributor to organizational 
competitiveness, there is little empirical research on the effects of situational factors on 
the success of information integration. Based on contingency theory, we address the 
following question: u nder what circumstances does information integration contribute 
to better performance outcomes in supply chain management (SCM)? Our results 
provide a contingency perspective of information integration, which highlights that 
the performance outcomes of information integration are contingent on both external 
environmental conditions and internal operational characteristics. We find that infor -
mation integration improves firms’ ability to perform, particularly when they operate 
under favorable environmental conditions—a highly munificent and a less uncertain 
environment—and  when  they  offer  durable  and  complex  products.  Our  findings 
advance contingency research on the performance outcomes of information integra-
tion for SCM. Our study provides managers with empirical insights on the effects of 
information integration on the cost and customer-oriented operational performance 
of SCM under favorable and unfavorable environmental conditions.

effeCtive information sharing is Considered essentiaL to the success of supply chain 
management (SCM) because partner firms in a supply chain (SC) need timely and 
quality  information  to  coordinate  intra-  and  interorganizational  business  activities 
to compete in the marketplace [37, 47, 71]. t o tackle the complexity of the business 
activities involved in SCM, firms develop electronic connectivity for accessing and 
sharing information across intra-organizational functions and with partners in their 
SCs [33, 55]. a  firm’s electronic connectivity, which we label as the firm’s extent of 
information integration, reflects its organizational ability to generate and disseminate 
information in support of its SC activities [73]. Information integration is defined as 
the information sharing infrastructure of firms to support information exchange and 
coordination across business functions and partner firms [5, 34].

a lthough information integration is considered essential to streamlining in SCM [52], 
it is not necessarily related to SC cost reduction [67], and it may even be detrimental 
to efficiency in interorganizational coordination [15] and customer service perfor -
mance [16]. these mixed results suggest that the contribution of information sharing 
to firms’ ability to create value in their SCs is highly dependent on firms’ business 
environmental conditions and operating characteristics [41]. h ence, empirical research 
investigating the determinants of the business value of information integration to SCM 
is needed. the results will help identify the performance implications and contingen-
cies of information integration in SCM.

the objective of this study is to address two critical issues related to the business 
value of information integration to SCM. First, we empirically examine the effects 
of information integration on firms’ operational and cost performance. Second, we 
explore the effects of selected determinants of information integration on performance 
outcomes in order to answer the following research question: 

RQ: Under what circumstances does information integration contribute to better 
performance outcomes in SCM? 

We probe into two key situational determinants of information integration, namely, 
a firm’s business environmental conditions and its operating characteristics, which 
constrain, condition, or influence the success of SC coordination [44].

Literature review

Conceptual Foundation and research on Information Integration

information  integration  is  CharaCterized  bY  eLeCtroniC  LinKages  and  integrated 
information sharing within and beyond organizational boundaries to facilitate cross-
functional coordination in the SC [45]. the conceptualization of information inte-
gration revolves around the fundamental notion of developing information sharing 
infrastructure in the SC with electronic linkages to facilitate timely, accurate, and 
standardized data exchange across internal and external organizational functions [7, 
32]. In line with this view, prior studies on SCM (e.g., [78]) suggest two levels of 
integration in support of business process coordination that underpins SCM, namely,

intra-organizational information integration that spans internal functional boundaries 
and interorganizational information integration that seeks to improve communica-
tion  between  SC  partners.  Intra-organizational  information  integration  refers  to 
the electronic linkages of a firm’s information technology (It) applications to data 
acquisition and storage systems to facilitate the sharing of accurate and timely infor-
mation in support of cross-functional processes [35]. however,  interorganizational 
information integration involves standardizing and digitizing information exchange 
spanning cross-organizational business activities [48, 100]. Such integration makes 
information available for timely dissemination to relevant SC partners for responsive 
decision making and market actions.

Contingency theory

Contingency  theory  asserts  that  a  firm’s  performance  is  attributable  to  the  match 
between its strategic behaviors and its internal and external environmental condi-
tions [91]. Such a match may require the adoption of organizational processes and 
strategies to reflect the particular circumstances confronting the firm [29]. Contingency 
theory views the firm as an open system, where information is exchanged through 
the input-process-output procedure [80]. “Input” refers to the contextual issues (e.g., 
functional coordination and demand fluctuation) that reside within or outside orga-
nizational boundaries, creating uncertainties or opportunities, hence influencing how 
the firm should operate in the SC [89]. “Process” is concerned with organizational 
operations that manage and cope with the contextual issues by sharing information 
and coordinating business processes. “Output” refers to the outcomes of the process 
procedures, which reflect how well firms process, adapt, or mitigate issues arising from 
the environment (i.e., input). this analogy is in line with organization theory, which 
stresses the value of both external and internal organizational attributes to business 
performance [3].

Following the work of Daft and Lengel [19], we argue that information integration 

is a strategic action that is beneficial to SCM by enhancing firms’ ability to better co-
ordinate their operations. h owever, firms should not neglect the situational conditions 
that affect their organizational ability derived from information integration to make 
informed decisions [29]. the situational conditions are engendered by firms’ internal 
operating characteristics that are inherent in their business operations [72], and firms’ 
external environmental conditions that are shaped by different external entities (e.g., 
suppliers, customers, and competitors) and factors (e.g., business opportunities) [26]. 
this contingency-theoretic view provides an appropriate theoretical lens to examine 
the performance variances of information integration attributable to the internal and 
external constraints of firms [91].

Synthesis of the Extant Literature

upon conducting an extensive literature review, we summarize the seminal works in 
t able 1 and notice the following limitations in the literature. First, although information

VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

integration is important to SCM, the role of information integration under different 
business conditions has not received due research attention [94, 95, 96]. Prior studies 
focus on examining what environmental conditions drive the development of infor-
mation integration, rather than studying how those conditions affect the performance 
outcomes of information integration. For example, grover and Saeed [34] investigate 
the various product characteristics (e.g., product complexity) and environmental factors 
(e.g., demand uncertainty) that spur the development of interorganizational system 
integration. Only a few studies have provided anecdotal evidence [32] and discussed 
the contingency of information integration on SC characteristics [9, 23].

according to  astley and Van de Ven [3], firms are influenced and constrained by 

external forces while conditioned and affected by internal attributes. Such a classical 
duality perspective of organizational theory advocates the presence of deterministic 
and  voluntaristic  forces  that  determine  firm  performance. 
t he  environmental  and 
external constraints are deterministic, where firms adapt and react to such constraints 
but  lack  control  over  them.  h owever,  voluntaristic  factors  refer  to  organizational 
endogenous  attributes  (e.g.,  product  characteristics  and  It   infrastructure)  that  are 
relatively more controllable by firms [12]. Prior studies focus on either the moderat-
ing role of internal capabilities (e.g., integrated IS capability [9]) in affecting or the 
effects of environmental conditions (e.g., competition [23]) on SCM performance 
outcomes, neglecting that both internal and external factors are important determi-
nants of SCM performance outcomes. In addition, the deterministic and voluntaristic 
nature of these factors that influence the success of information integration is absent. 
grounded in contingency theory [29, 89], we investigate the performance contingen-
cies and constraints of information integration in SCM residing within and outside 
organizational boundaries.

Second, studies have investigated interorganizational information integration and its 
impact on reducing uncertainty in SCs [70, 73]. t he importance of intra-organizational 
information integration is also acknowledged in studies of enterprise resource planning 
adoption to support cross-function operations in firms [40, 90].  although the SCM 
literature has suggested the importance of integrating internal and external processes 
[43], prior studies tend to neglect the importance of taking into account both intra- and 
interorganizational information integration in SCM. this study is novel in expanding 
the previous narrow investigation of information integration to encompass both the 
intra- and interorganizational dimensions of information integration for SCM.

third, instead of focusing on unfavorable situational conditions that give rise to 
uncertainty in business operations [97], we respond to the call for investigating the 
impact of environmental munificence, often considered a salient force influencing 
the coordination of business activities across firms [63, 84], which has not been duly 
researched. We consider both the positive and negative business environmental condi-
tions of firms that may affect information integration’s impact on firms’ performance. 
Moreover, although variants of contingency theory predict that information integration 
is beneficial to performance by reducing uncertainty in SCM [6, 29], they provide 
few empirical insights on the performance implications of information integration at 
different levels. We aim to provide insights on the performance effects of information

integration  by  examining  the  performance  strength  when  these  contingencies  and 
constraints are present at low versus high levels.

hypotheses

our studY Consists of induCtive fieLd researCh1 followed by a survey. We first con-
duct interviews with ten managers in the areas of information systems management, 
SCM, and operations management. appendix a  provides the details of the inductive 
field research.  grounded in contingency theory, we develop the research hypotheses 
based on the inductive field research findings to identify the contingency factors and 
the performance effects of information integration in practice. this approach ensures 
the hypothesized relationships reflect real-life situations.

Based on the field interviews, prior research, and the duality perspective of organiza-

tional theory, we classify the contingency factors related to information integration into 
two categories, namely, internal operating characteristics and external environmental 
conditions. Specifically, the internal operating characteristics of firms are concerned 
with firms’ product type and level of product complexity that are inherent in their 
information integration implementation. the external environmental conditions con-
sidered critical to successful SCM implementation relate to the levels of munificence 
and uncertainty characterizing the business environmental conditions. Figure 1 depicts 
the research model that guides our study.

Effect of Information Integration on Operational and  
Cost Performance

Information integration across partner firms enables close communication and allows 
sharing of information in support of their SC operations and determining appropriate 
performance improvement actions [19]. For example, integrating a manufacturer’s 
production schedule with the procurement plans of its buying firms can be helpful for 
adapting changes to product specifications, while the buying firms can receive timely 
updates on the delivery status of their orders to plan ahead marketing activities. Infor-
mation integration enables partner firms to satisfy the operating needs of one another 
with a common performance improvement goal. the implementation of information 
integration lowers the costs of coordinating the SC activities of firms while improv-
ing their information-processing abilities by providing technical infrastructure [73]. 
Cost performance is concerned with reducing costs in activities such as distribution, 
inventory, order management, and the related administrative processes [49]. On the 
other  hand,  customer-oriented  operational  performance  of  firms  indicates  service 
quality, flexibility, and responsiveness of firms in satisfying customer needs. Based 
on the argument of Malone and his colleagues [56, 57, 58] that information sharing 
is essential to integration among multiple organizational functions working together 
toward common goals, we reason that information integration provides a coordination 
mechanism that supports task completion and reduces coordination costs.

Hypothesis  1:  Information  integration  of  a  firm’s  SC  is  positively  associated

performance.

Contingent role of External Environmental Conditions

Environmental Munificence

Environmental munificence refers to the extent to which a business environment can 
sustain business growth [83]. a  high level of environmental munificence suggests an 
abundance of business opportunities and resources for a business to grow [13]. Firms 
operating in a highly munificent environment will find information integration use-
ful because it allows them to acquire and share information with their SC partners 
about market expansion opportunities, new market prospects, and growing market 
demand, which they can exploit to capture business opportunities in a timely manner 
at a low cost. a  manager noted this aspect of environmental munificence during the 
interview:

It  is  very  important  for  us  to  share  information  with  our  upstream  partners, 
including raw material suppliers and contract manufacturers, especially when 
we detect and are trying to capture a new market segment. For example, in these 
few years, we observe there are increasing numbers of business customers using 
our products to create their own. We therefore expand our market by promoting 
different applications of our products. however, such a business opportunity 
requires timely product delivery, particularly when customers are exploring new 
applications. Failing to act swiftly, we will lose our customers as they may have 
successfully applied our competitors’ products and will continue to do so.

Information integration enables firms to compete more effectively in the marketplace 
because they can exploit valuable information resources in the SC to help minimize 
various forms of waste, such as inventory excesses or shortages, and underutilized 


170     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

business processes [81], and respond to changing market needs swiftly. Information 
integration  leverages  opportunities  in  a  highly  munificent  environment  (e.g.,  new 
potential market) by effectively utilizing organizational resources and capabilities to 
maintain flexibility and provide timely response to changing market demand at a low 
cost. With abundant resources, firms are able to undertake complementary organiza-
tional investments (e.g., in new product lines) and to leverage the existing information 
integration infrastructure for reducing cost and improving service, hence strengthening 
coordination and capacity utilization in SC operations [11]. But operating in a declin-
ing but highly competitive market with limited business opportunities and resources 
for growth, that is, a less munificent environment, firms focus on maintenance and 
logistical functions, and standardized routines to enhance efficiency and strive for 
survival [21]. Organizational efforts in innovating and modifying products, lowering 
prices, offering incentives and new services to customers, and market repositioning 
by product differentiation are required to compete for business. While these activities 
require management efforts beyond information integration to coordinate business 
activities, achieving the desired performance with information integration in a less 
munificent environment is more difficult than that in a highly munificent one.

Hypothesis 2: The positive associations between the information integration of 
a firm’s SC and its (a) customer-oriented operational performance and (b)  cost 
performance strengthen when the firm experiences a high level of environmental 
munificence.

Environmental uncertainty

Environmental uncertainty refers to firms’ inability to accurately predict the outcomes 
of their decisions [79]. a n uncertain business environment is characterized by changing 
customer demand, unpredictable competitor action, or fluctuating sales volume  [61], 
which constrains and hinders firms’ ability to achieve the projected results  [3]. Informa-
tion is a valuable asset that enables firms to cope with uncertainty while information 
integration is a useful means to overcome environmental uncertainty. Firms often 
proactively gather information in an attempt to make informed decisions and predict 
the outcomes of their actions with ease [24]. however, several managers expressed 
that they could not solely rely on information sharing to manage their SC activities, 
particularly ad hoc arrangements such as urgent requests or delivery changes on short 
notice due to demand changes. Events of such nature require other means of com-
munication (e.g., fax and phone calls) that provide quick response and flexibility in 
coping with unforeseen events. Such a shortfall of information integration became 
apparent in the comment of an It  manager:

We share relevant data with our partners to coordinate our production schedule, 
shipment, warehouse, and other related supply chain activities. however, to 
compete in this severely competitive business environment, it is inadequate to 
rely on information sharing to prevent the problem of excessive inventory or 
insufficient capacity to fulfill urgent orders. Our account executives work closely 


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

O SuPPLY  ChaIN MaNagEMENt     171

with our customers and suppliers to track events that do not fully reflect in the 
data shared. a lthough this practice increases our costs, we are able to stay ahead 
of the game and competently handle drastic changes in supply and demand.

On the contrary, firms can better predict the outcomes of their decisions under a less 
uncertain business environment. Such an environment allows faster response to market 
needs and reduces operating costs as information integration provides an enabling 
mechanism to improve the coordination of organizational activities.

Hypothesis 3: The positive associations between the information integration of 
a firm’s SC and its (a) customer-oriented operational performance and (b)  cost 
performance strengthen when the firm experiences a low level of environmental 
uncertainty.

Contingent role of Internal Operating Characteristics

the operating characteristics of a firm are determined by its production structure, 
which is shaped by management’s strategic choices and constrained by the firm’s 
product type and level of product complexity [77]. ragowsky et al. [72] suggest that 
the operating characteristics of firms are related to their inherent internal operating 
conditions involving multiple organizational functions, which are voluntaristic and 
organized to reflect organizational resource allocation and coordination.

Durable Versus Nondurable Products

In line with Fisher’s [27] view, our interviewees suggested that the nature of their 
production processes and product demand influence and constrain their SC operations. 
the uncertainty involved in managing products with different characteristics (e.g., 
durable versus nondurable goods) is determined by the degree of demand fluctuation 
caused by such factors as price change and frequency of customer purchase [18]. 
Durable products2 have relatively longer product life cycles and more pronounced 
fluctuations in demand that are influenced by various factors (e.g., economic condi-
tions and technology advancement) [17]. Firms offering durable goods should better 
coordinate with their SC partners so that they can react quickly to fast-evolving changes 
in inventory and delivery time to improve customer-oriented operational performance. 
Information  integration  facilitates  information  sharing  across  organizational  func-
tions and improves the competence of firms in handling unforeseen demand changes 
by coordinating effectively with SC partners. an It
 manager of a home electronic 
products trading company noted:

When we encounter drastic increases or decreases in the demand for our products 
that may end up with shortage or excessive stocks, we need to seek help from 
our supply chain partners, ranging from suppliers, contract manufacturers, to 
logistics service providers, with a view to negotiating for special arrangements 
and trading terms that involves direct communication and interaction. Luckily, 


172     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

our products have a slow rate of obsolescence and we have little worry about them 
being out-of-date quickly. Our major concern is about the inventory maintenance 
and storage costs if we have excessive stocks or the sourcing costs if we have 
a shortage. We are able to quickly consolidate inventory information related to 
the work-in-progress at our manufacturers, inventory in our warehouses, unsold 
products in our distributors, and so forth, where our information system is in-
strumental for us to take responsive actions in reducing the costs arising from 
market demand fluctuations.

But nondurable products have short product life cycles so they are relatively faster 
in product obsolescence. although the rate of consumption can be relatively stable 
with lower demand fluctuation, quick replenishment or special warehousing arrange-
ments are desirable for nondurable products to reach market without obsolescence 
and spoilage. Our interview findings indicate that firms offering nondurable products 
often operate and maintain costly in-house functions in order to ensure quick delivery 
to market. For example, contrary to the trend toward outsourcing noncore activities to 
logistics service providers for reducing labor and operating costs (e.g., maintenance 
costs of logistics facilities, trucks), a leading local food and beverages supplier operates 
its own logistics functions to ensure product freshness and short lead-time delivery. 
In trading with voluminous small and medium-size customers, the food and beverage 
supplier finds the sole reliance on information integration inadequate to coordinate with 
its SC partners. Particularly, the phone-in order system of the supplier accentuates the 
inadequacy. this observation highlights the insufficiency of information integration 
in handling nondurable products.

Hypothesis 4: The positive associations between the information integration of 
a firm’s SC and its (a) customer-oriented operational performance and (b)  cost 
performance strengthen when the firm offers durable products.

Product Complexity

Product complexity refers to the nature of product development that involves a number 
of different organizations (e.g., suppliers), degree of technological advancement, diver-
sity of inputs, and frequency of adjustments needed from suppliers [42]. the presence 
of these factors suggests that a complex product has a highly intricate requirement for 
coordinating business activities to manage multiple business units and partner firms 
involving a large number of physical components. Developing a complex product 
brings forth numerous business activities ranging from sourcing to distribution with 
considerable coordination efforts of multiple functions to eliminate such problems 
as input shortage and delivery delay in the SC [82]. Information integration provides 
electronic linkages and coordination mechanisms across various organizational func-
tions and parties to support the development of such product type [10], while coordi-
nating the SC needs management efforts to deal with ambiguities in product design 
and specification that may confuse different organizational functions.  an operations 
executive noted this:


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

O SuPPLY  ChaIN MaNagEMENt     173

It is impossible for us to expect a perfect product to be delivered by merely 
sharing our product design with our contract manufacturers. We have to work 
closely with them, especially in the new product design phase, to ensure they 
understand our specifications and expectations. Indeed, we often send our engi-
neers to the manufacturers’ factories to troubleshoot our design and help them 
with production issues. Our information integration with suppliers enables us to 
share the latest data on product development such as testing results and design 
changes, which has significantly shortened our development lead-time.

Interacting beyond the information sharing infrastructure is common, particularly 
when the product development and design interface across organizational functions is 
not properly planned [82]. Information integration streamlines business processes for 
cost reduction and operational efficiency for businesses characterized by low product 
complexity. h owever, the value of such integration can be trivial in differentiating SCM 
performance outcomes among firms offering less complex products.  this is because 
the competition of firms offering less complex products goes beyond the effectiveness 
and efficiency of product development that can be supported by information integra-
tion, and involves their service and marketing strategies [8].

Hypothesis 5: The positive associations between the information integration of 
a firm’s SC and its (a) customer-oriented operational performance and (b)  cost 
performance  strengthen  when  the  firm  offers  products  with  a  higher  level  of 
product complexity.

Method

Sample and Data Collection

We obtained the data for this researCh from senior executives of wholesale trading 
companies in hong Kong, which come from two groups of wholesale trade, 3 namely, 
SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes 50 (i.e., wholesale trade—durable goods) 
and 51 (i.e., wholesale trade—nondurable goods). We randomly drew a sample of 800 
wholesale trading firms from the directory Dun  & Bradstreet. We conducted three 
rounds of survey mailings and received in total 196 responses, representing a response 
rate of 24.5 percent. h owever, we disqualified eight responses, where six of them were 
blank or incomplete returns and the remaining two we received too late for the analysis. 
the survey generated 188 usable returns, yielding an effective response rate of 23.5 
percent, which was comparable to prior studies of a similar nature [20, 51].

Bias Issues

We check possible problems of nonresponse bias in two steps. Following the work 
of armstrong and Overton [2], we verify that the early and late respondents do not 
differ significantly in their responses to a random selection of questionnaire items, 
at p < 0.001. In addition, we compare the differences in the mean values of the ob-


174     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

jective measures, namely, firm size and annual sales volume, between the early and 
late firms. We find no significant differences in firm size (F 
= 1.077, p = 0.300) and 
annual sales volume (F = 1.136, p = 0.287), suggesting that nonresponse bias is not 
an issue in the collected data.

t o find out whether common method variance posed a serious threat to our study, 
we  perform  three  steps.  First,  we  conduct  the  h arman’s  one-factor  test,  which  is 
widely followed by other researchers (e.g., [99]). We examine whether the chi-square 
of a single-latent factor would account for the hypothesized six-construct model. a  
significant difference between the chi-square values (∆χ 2 = 1,832.39, ∆df [degrees of 
freedom] = 12, p < 0.05) of the two models indicates that the fit in the one-dimensional 
model is significantly worse than that in the hypothesized model. Second, following 
the work of Lindell and Whitney [53], we use type of firm ownership as a marker vari-
able, which is theoretically unrelated to all the dependent variables, to test for potential 
common method variance. We find that type of firm ownership does not significantly 
relate to any of the variables, further indicating that common method variance is not 
an issue in our study. third, in our research design, we conduct both qualitative case 
study and quantitative survey to overcome the shortcomings of common method bias 
by triangulating the data collected from both research methods.

Measurement Development

We conduct an extensive literature review and adopt items used previously to improve 
the reliability and validity of the measures.4 a  pilot test with a group of 50 managers 
resulted in slight modifications to the wording of nine measurement items. In addition, we 
conduct exploratory factor analysis to purify our scales and deleted three items because 
their corrected-item-to-total correlations are lower than the 0.30 threshold value, sug-
gesting that these items do not capture what we intended to be measured. this elimina-
tion resulted in a more parsimonious survey instrument as shown in appendix  B [36]. 
We used two types of measure in the survey instrument, namely, single-item measure 
and reflective multi-item measure.  t he single-item measure is the objective measure of 
product type. For the observed variables, which are manifestations of the underlying 
constructs, we use a reflective measurement model  [4]. t he reflective multi-item measures 
used are intra-organizational information integration, interorganizational information 
integration, operational performance, cost performance, environmental munificence, 
environmental uncertainty, and product complexity. Following prior studies [65, 85], we 
invited respondents to evaluate their organizational characteristics with respect to each 
item posed in the survey relative to those of their major competitors.

Independent Variable

a s information integration is concerned with establishing electronic linkages to support 
standardized information sharing for coordination, we adapt the measurement scale 
of intra-organizational information integration [16, 73, 75] and interorganizational 
information integration [62, 73] from the literature.


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

O SuPPLY  ChaIN MaNagEMENt     175

Dependent Variables

We evaluate the performance implications of information integration for SCM by 
considering (1) how well the focal firm meets its customers’ operations needs (i.e., 
customer-oriented operational performance) and (2) its performance in cost reduction 
(i.e., cost performance) [76]. t he customer-oriented operational performance evaluates 
how well the focal firm fulfills customer orders with short lead times and as scheduled, 
attains a high level of responsiveness in handling order changes, and replenishes stock 
for customers with a high level of accuracy [93]. the cost performance  reflects how 
well the focal firm achieves the economic goal of reducing costs, including distribu-
tion cost, inventory cost, order management cost, and so forth [49].

Moderating Variables

this study takes into account environmental munificence and uncertainty, which can 
be beneficial or detrimental to the performance outcomes of information integration. 
We adapt the measurement scales of environmental munificence and uncertainty de-
veloped by Sutcliffe and h uber [86]. t o measure the operating characteristics of firms, 
we use the objective measure of product type and evaluate firms’ product complexity 
by adopting a four-item measurement scale from the literature [42, 68]. We measure a 
firm’s product type objectively by the firm’s two-digit SIC industry code [74], which 
is either wholesale trade of durable goods or nondurable goods. Product complexity 
comprises number of components, degree of interactions between trading partners, 
and extent of product novelty [68].

Control Variable

We include firm size (i.e., number of employees) as a control variable as it affects 
organizational ability in developing information integration because larger firms tend 
to enjoy scale efficiency in information sharing [38] and they have more resources 
to  support  the  development  of  intra-  and  interorganizational  information  integra-
tion [101]. We measure firm size by taking the natural logarithm of the number of 
employees in each firm.

Measurement Validation

We first perform confirmatory factor analysis (CF a) using  amos  7.0 to evaluate the 
psychometric properties of the factor structures. We follow the guidelines provided 
by gerbing and  anderson [30] and use the maximum likelihood estimation with the 
covariance.

Information Integration

as discussed earlier, information integration is a second-order construct that includes 
the  two  complementary  dimensions  of  intra-  and  interorganizational  information 


176     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

integration [65], which co-vary and interact with each other. We explored whether 
we should use a more parsimonious measure for information integration, at a second-
order level, to test the hypotheses. Following the work of t anriverdi [88], we conduct 
three  tests  to  compare  the  first-order  and  second-order  models  of  this  construct. 
First, we compare the goodness-of-fit statistics of the first-order model (χ
2 = 245.3, 
df = 50, rMr [root mean square residual]  = 0.05, IFI [incremental fit index]  = 0.93, 
CFI [comparative fit index]  = 0.93) and the second-order model (χ2 = 247.2, df = 50, 
rMr  = 0.05, IFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94), which are almost identical. this result suggests 
that the second-order model is a better predictor of information integration. Second, 
the first-order factors load significantly onto the second-order factor (i.e., 
p < 0.05), 
which lends support for the presence of the second-order model. third, we compute 
the target coefficient value and obtain  T = 0.99, which is equal to the theoretical upper 
limit of 1.0. this result indicates that the relationship among the second-order factors 
accounts for 99 percent of the first-order factors [60].  t able 2 summarizes the results 
of the CFa  on information integration.

Combined Measurement Model t est

We conduct CFa  on all the theoretical constructs examined in this study. Measures 
of overall fit evaluate how well the CF a  model reproduces the observed variables’ 
covariance matrix. the six-factor measurement model exhibits a good fit of the data 
(χ2  =  939.53,  df  =  508,  rMr  =  0.07,  IFI  =  0.90,  CFI  =  0.90). the  measurement 
items load significantly (i.e.,  p < 0.01 and t > 2.0) onto their respective constructs 
with loadings ranging between 0.50 and 0.93, indicating convergent validity of the 
constructs [1]. t o assess discriminant validity, we follow Fornell and Larcker [28] by 
evaluating the average variance extracted (a VE) estimates of all the constructs, which 
are found to be greater than the squared correlation between any pair of them, sug-
gesting that the measurement items share common variance with their hypothesized 
constructs more than with the other constructs, providing evidence of discriminant 
validity. t able 3 summarizes the composite reliability, Cronbach’s alphas, and a VE, 
and t able 4 summarizes the CFa  results. Composite reliability represents the shared 
variance among a set of observed variables that measure an underlying construct’s 
reliability [28], and the composite reliability of all the constructs meet the criterion 
of 0.60. the Cronbach’s alpha values obtained range from 0.70 to 0.93, exceeding 
the threshold value of 0.70 recommended by Nunnally [69], suggesting a reasonable 
degree of internal consistency between the corresponding measurement items.

results and Discussion

Performance Effects of Information Integration

We use amos 7.0 to test the hYpotheses using the maximum likelihood estimation with 
the sample covariance matrix as input. t he results indicate that the structural model of 
information integration, and operational and cost performance provide a reasonable fit

of the survey data with fit indices  χ2 = 401.12, df = 183, NFI [normed fit index]  = 0.91, 
IFI = 0.92, tLI [t ucker–Lewis index] = 0.91, and CFI = 0.92. Information integration 
is positively associated with customer-oriented operational performance (β = 0.45, 
t = 4.12) and cost performance (β = 0.50, t = 4.31), supporting h1.

Environmental Contingency Determinants:  
Munificent and uncertain Environment

We examine the contingencies of the relationships between information integration 
and performance measures using the multigroup analysis in amos  7.0 for a number of 
reasons.5 In evaluating the impact of the moderating variables, we follow the guidelines 
of Marsh and hocevar [59] and prior studies (e.g., [22]). 6

We first create a two-group model by dividing the total 188 sample firms into a high 
group (n = 104) and a low group (n = 84) with respect to environmental munificence 
based on the median split.7 a  significant change in the chi-square values of the baseline 
and constrained models is found (∆χ2 = 94.92, ∆df = 48, p < 0.01), providing support 
for the contingent role of environmental munificence on information integration and 
business performance. We then test the equality of paths between the high and low 
environmental  munificence  groups  with  respect  to  customer-oriented  operational 
performance,  and  find  support  for  the  contingency  of  environmental  munificence 
(∆χ2 = 5.17, ∆df = 1, p < 0.05). the relationships between information integration and 
customer-oriented operational performance in the high group (β = 0.72, t = 2.95) and 
in the low group of munificent environment (β  = 0.29, t = 2.01) are both positively 
significant.  the relationships between information integration and cost performance 
in the high group (β = 0.73, t = 2.81) and the low group of munificent environment 
(β = 0.35, t = 2.23) are both positively significant, with a significant change in the chi-
square values between the two groups (∆χ2 = 5.01, ∆df = 1, p < 0.05). these results 
suggest that information integration is beneficial to both operational performance and 
cost performance of firms when operating under a highly munificent environment, 
lending support for h2a and h2b.

Following the same procedure, we test the influence of environmental uncertainty 
by classifying the sample firms into high (n  = 81) and low (n = 107) groups of envi-
ronmental uncertainty based on the median split. Consistent with the literature that 
environmental uncertainty influences the performance outcomes of SC coordination 
efforts, the chi-square difference test shows that the associations between information 
integration and business performance measures are contingent on environmental un-
certainty (∆χ2 = 86.46, ∆df = 48, p < 0.05). In line with h3b, information integration 
is found beneficial to cost performance with a low level of environmental uncertainty 
(β = 0.41, t = 2.57), but the relationship is insignificant in a highly uncertain environ-
ment (β = 0.63, t = 1.53). these results suggest that information integration for SCM 
can reduce various costs incurred from coordinating SC activities when firms operate 
under a less uncertain environment. however, the relationship between information 
integration and customer-oriented operational performance in the high group (β = 0.61, 
t = 1.48) and in the low group of uncertain environment (β = 0.46, t = 1.27) are both 
insignificant, suggesting the relationship is insensitive to environmental uncertainty, 
and  h 3a  is  not  supported.  Information  integration  can  be  a  useful  organizational 
resource to share the needed information for managing day-to-day operations and to 
meet customer-oriented operational needs regardless of the level of environmental 
uncertainty. t able 5 summarizes the results of the invariance tests for environmental 
contingency determinants.

Internal Contingency Determinants:  
Product t ype and Product Complexity

h4b that the association between information integration and cost performance is 
moderated by product type in terms of durability is supported (∆χ2 = 4.89, ∆df = 1, 
p  <  0.05). the  relationships  are  positively  significant  for  both  durable  (β  =  0.53, 
t = 3.74) and nondurable product types (β = 0.33, t = 2.17). this indicates that infor -
mation integration is useful to reducing the costs of coordination in SCs, particularly 
when firms trade durable products.  however, the association between information 
integration and customer-oriented operational performance is not contingent on product 
type (∆χ2 = 2.04, ∆df = 1, p > 0.05), lending no support for h4a.  this suggests that 
information integration is valuable to firms to gain operational efficiency and satisfy 
customer needs regardless of the level of product durability.

t he associations between information integration and customer-oriented operational 
performance in the high (β = 0.58, t = 3.07) and low group of product complexity 
(β = 0.36, t = 2.64) are both significant, with the chi-square values significantly dif-
ferent between the two groups (∆χ2 = 4.02, ∆df = 1, p < 0.05), supporting h5a. Based 
on the difference in β, the positive association between information integration and 
customer-oriented operational performance strengthens when product complexity is 
high. h owever, the relationship between information integration and cost performance 
is invariant at different levels of product complexity (∆χ2 = 1.85, ∆df = 1, p > 0.05). 
h5b is therefore not supported.  this indicates that firms are able to reduce costs with 
information integration for SCM irrespective of product complexity. t able 6 summa-

Implications

theoretical Implications

the  studY  findings  provide  impLiCations  and  Contribution  to  contingency  theory. 
While contingency theory posits the value of information integration as a mechanism 
to overcome uncertainty in SCM, our findings suggest that firms are able to achieve 
better  customer-oriented  operational  and  cost  performance  particularly  when  they 
operate in a highly munificent environment. When resources are abundant, it becomes 
relatively easy for firms to pursue goals of improving operational and cost performance 
by exploiting information integration to generate and disseminate timely and accurate 
information, and to work with partners for better coordination of SC activities. Yet the 
value of information integration in a less munificent environment is still beneficial to 
firms for performance improvement.  this result advances contingency theory in the 
context of information integration for SCM by providing empirical evidence on the 
different performance contingencies beyond managing uncertainty in SCs.

Consistent with our theorization, the findings suggest that information integration 

is significantly instrumental in improving firms’ cost performance, particularly when 
they  experience  a  low  level  of  environmental  uncertainty,  where  firms  can  derive 
much value from leveraging information integration to coordinate activities across 
partner firms in the SC.  the study results also suggest that information integration is 
valuable to operational performance and not affected by environmental uncertainty. 
We explain this result by the fact that firms achieve autonomy in coordinating tasks 
and operations across organizational functions through information integration. Such 
autonomy in task coordination reduces errors in replenishment, shortens lead time, and 
enables on-time delivery, which are concerned with the efficacy of operations despite 
changes in sales volume, competition actions, and customer attitude. however, firms 
tend to provide additional resources and incur costs in dealing with such uncertainty 
in their environments. an It

 manager commented:

By integrating our business functions for information sharing and maintaining 
our own logistics operations, we are able to satisfy local customer needs by 
fulfilling their orders within 24 hours.  however, we find it difficult to reduce 
our operating costs as we maintain a high level of inventory as well as a large 
work force to support the logistics function.

another major theoretical implication and contribution of this study relates to the in-
tegration of contingency theory with the classical duality perspective of organizational 
theory [3]. In addition to examining the performance effect of external environmental 
conditions that are deterministic in nature, this study extends the knowledge frontier 
of contingency theory by empirically investigating the performance contingencies of 
information integration for SCM on the voluntaristic conditions of firms in terms of

product type and complexity. this advances understanding of the effects of inherent 
operating conditions on information management, beyond prior contingency-theoretic 
studies with a focus on environmental uncertainty, which is external to firms  [71]. 
this study also provides an empirical explanation for the mixed performance effects 
of information integration observed in prior studies. Our findings suggest that when 
firms’ environmental conditions are deterministic, the value of information integration 


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

O SuPPLY  ChaIN MaNagEMENt     187

is less salient under a severe environmental condition (i.e., low munificence and high 
uncertainty) versus a forbearing environmental condition (i.e., high munificence and 
low uncertainty). In situations where the operating characteristics are voluntaristic 
and relatively more controllable than those characterizing the external environment, 
firms offering durable and complex products stand a good chance to reap performance 
gains from information integration for SCM.

Information integration enables firms to take advantage of long product life cycles 
and low levels of product obsolescence by facilitating collaboration with partner firms 
to reduce various operating costs in administration, inventory, distribution, and order 
management. thus, firms offering durable products can reap a higher level of cost 
benefit by information integration than their counterparts offering nondurable products. 
this is in line with organizational theory that the voluntaristic nature of operational 
characteristics is taken into account in information integration, where firms streamline 
functions and eliminate task redundancy in the hope of achieving cost reduction. Such 
a coordination mechanism enabled by information integration allows firms to reduce 
transaction and coordination costs in managing operational activities, particularly for 
durable products.

the customer-oriented operational performance of information integration is invari-

ant at different levels of product durability. Such invariance suggests that information 
integration is insufficient to differentiate firms’ operational efficiency. 
as suggested 
by an It  manager in our interview, information integration has become a competition 
qualifier to ensure timely delivery and error reduction. Information integration is es-
sential not only to coordinating internal tasks but also to acquiring relevant informa-
tion from external parties (e.g., component suppliers and contract manufacturers) to 
achieve operational performance irrespective of product durability.

Similarly, our findings indicate that product complexity has no influence on the cost 

performance of information integration. t he coordination mechanism among functions 
for making complex products is structured in the development of intra- and interorga-
nizational information integration. Such information integration is helpful for reducing 
coordination costs as well as improving transactional efficiency, which is beneficial to 
cost reduction and asset turns in an SC. an operations manager also highlighted the 
use of information integration to support repair and maintenance services involving a 
large group of field engineers and components.  the system supported by information 
integration facilitates the repair and maintenance service by providing timely informa-
tion about spare parts availability and their whereabouts while improving inventory 
turns. Information integration improves firms’ ability to share the latest information 
on product development and shorten lead time with delivery flexibility that enhances 
operational performance, even for firms offering complex products.

Managerial Implications

Our study has several managerial implications. First, the findings show that effec-
tive SCM is key to mitigating uncertainty in coordinating the SC with reduced costs. 
While information integration facilitates the physical movement of goods in SCs, it 


188     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

also affects how well firms achieve operational and cost performance improvement in 
a munificent environment. Firms should consider investing in information integration 
for SCM when there is market potential for growth.

Second, it is often argued that cost reduction is difficult to achieve when firms 

undergo business expansion to capture market growth [39]. Cost reduction is often 
the step taken only when firms have reached the state of maturity in the market to 
strive for further business gains. Information integration enables firms to achieve cost 
reduction in coordinating SCs in a munificent business environment.

third, our research shows that contingency factors that are external as well as inter -
nal to firms are related to the performance outcomes of information integration.  t he 
implication is that managers should consider the conditions of their business environ-
ments, as well as their internal operating characteristics, in establishing their target 
operational and cost performance goals when developing information integration. 
Managers should not expect information integration to deliver the same performance 
benefits as those that can be derived under pleasant environmental conditions (i.e., 
high munificence and low uncertainty). Nevertheless, information integration invest-
ment is still needed in a less munificent environment for firms to reap performance 
gains.  Similarly,  information  integration  is  instrumental  in  reducing  costs  when 
firms operate under a less uncertain environment.  h owever, in a highly uncertain 
environment, information integration is insufficient for improving cost performance 
because additional resources and costs (e.g., offering additional services) are needed 
to deal with such uncertainty. a lthough our findings are different from the expectation 
that SC uncertainty can be mitigated with information systems, it is in line with the 
cases of vertically integrated organizations. For example, in Zara, one of the largest 
international fashion companies, the coordination of its SC activities does not solely 
rely on information sharing. t he company maintains other communication channels 
(e.g., faxes and phone calls) and reengineers business processes to facilitate coordi-
nation of SC activities among functions through which to gain both operational and 
cost advantages [14]. We suggest that managers pursue information integration for 
SCM to achieve operational performance improvement regardless of the extent of 
environmental uncertainty they face.

Fourth, firms should take advantage of information integration when trading durable 

products to lower the costs for coordinating SC activities. Information integration is 
also beneficial to operational performance regardless of product durability. In addition, 
firms trading highly complex products would also benefit from information integra-
tion with the ability to respond to customer needs in an efficient manner. Enterprises 
seeking cost performance in SCM should benefit from information integration for 
operating cost reduction regardless of product complexity.

Fifth, managers can use our instrument for measuring the contingency factors to 
diagnose the conditions of their business environments. It is a useful tool for planning 
and implementing information integration for SCM, which may require significant 
investment to develop. In addition, the empirically validated measure of information 
integration provides a useful guide for managers to assess and develop information 
integration  for  SCM,  as  both  the  technical  and  coordination  aspects  of  informa-


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

tion sharing should be taken into account in weighing performance improvement 
actions.

Limitations and Future research Directions

our  WorK  Can  be  extended  in  a  number  of  direCtions.  First,  although  our  study 
provides evidence in support of our theoretical reasoning, a proportion of the vari-
ance remains unexplained, as is the case for most empirical studies of organizations. 
Future  research  might  incorporate  other  determinants  than  the  external  business 
environment and operating characteristics that are the moderators investigated in this 
study. Second, the unit of analysis in this study is not a specific SC for a given prod-
uct line. We examine the SCs of focal firms and their primary products.  this unit of 
analysis allows us to focus on organization-wide patterns of information integration, 
business environmental conditions, and operating characteristics. Nevertheless, due 
to the varied nature of the operations of different SCs, it is worthwhile to investigate 
the contingency factors through case studies on the temporal dimension. third, we 
focus on the relative levels rather than the absolute levels of situational conditions. 
Further research on the issue of the absolute level of the impact of the study variables 
is warranted. Fourth, the use of multiple research methods, as well as the international 
business nature of respondents, is valuable for the analysis of data across studies and 
the generalizability of findings  [50]. although this study identifies the environmental 
and operating contingencies of information integration, the strengths of these factors 
on performance outcomes may vary due to industry-specific operational requirements, 
such as just-in-time arrangement in the automotive industry. Future studies concerning 
industries with different operational requirements (e.g., logistics and shipping require-
ments [54]) can improve the generalizability of our research findings.

Conclusions

this  studY  advanCes  the  KnoWLedge  frontier  of  information  integration  research 
whereby we adopt contingency theory to examine the performance outcomes of in-
formation integrating for SCM in firms that operate under favorable and unfavorable 
environmental conditions. We provide empirical evidence to account for the mixed 
results concerning information integration for SCM in the literature. Drawing on the 
classical duality perspective of organizational theory, we differentiate the performance 
contingency factors into two sets: (1) external environmental conditions in terms of 
environmental uncertainty and munificence, and (2)  operating characteristics of firms 
in terms of product complexity and durability. t he study findings provide explanations 
on how and why the effects of information integration vary with these contingency 
factors.

We identify the external environmental conditions and the operational characteris-
tics of firms associated with which the value of information integration to improving 
cost and customer-oriented operational performance for SCM is more salient. Based 


190     WONg, LaI, aND ChENg

on related theories and our empirical findings, we provide managers with insights on 
the operational and environmental conditions under which information integration is 
more likely to bring performance gains. We lay the foundation for future information 
integration research, which may investigate other performance contingency factors that 
affect information integration for SCM or explore possible ways in which the value of 
information integration for SCM can be strengthened under unfavorable conditions.

notes

1. the field interviews help us to understand the importance of information integration to 

SCM, how it can be measured, and the contingency factors that are conducive to its success. a  
valuable insight obtained from the interviews is that managers appreciate the value of informa-
tion integration to SCM, but many of them find difficulty in realizing its potential.

2. We note that there are exceptional cases of durable products (e.g., computers and cell 
phones) that may lose market value and become obsolete quickly from the marketing perspec-
tive. Similarly, some nondurable products (e.g., canned food) do not perish or become obsolete 
quickly. In this study, product durability refers to product life cycle and demand fluctuation due 
to a product’s rates of consumption and functions.

3. We restrict our sample to wholesale trade to minimize extraneous variations in SC opera-
tions that might arise because of differences in industry. In addition, the business environmental 
conditions of wholesale trading companies are likely to be different because they handle different 
sets of competitors, suppliers, customers, government regulations, and economic conditions 
when they trade different products. It is therefore reasonable to expect that wholesale trading 
companies possess different levels of information integration, and they operate under different 
business environmental conditions and with different operating characteristics, enhancing the 
generalizability of our results.

4. We sought comments from a panel of six academics and five practitioners in the areas of 
information systems and SCM to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of each measurement item 
for each theoretical construct, (2) the comprehensiveness of the measurement items, and (3) the 
suitability of the wording. In addition, we interviewed five senior executives, drawn from our 
sampling frame, to seek their opinions on (1) relevance of our research questions to their SC 
operations, (2) survey design quality, and (3) wording of the measurement scales.

5. We use multigroup analysis for the following reasons. First, multigroup analysis enables 
us to compare different conditions (e.g., highly complex versus less complex products) that are 
beneficial and detrimental to the performance outcomes of information integration. Second, 
multigroup analysis can reveal the structural associations between the independent and depen-
dent variables across firms operating under these different situational conditions, allowing us 
to test the equivalence of both item-factor loadings and structural weights across firms.  third, 
multigroup analysis has been shown as a more appropriate approach to assess the effects of 
contingency determinants than if they are posited as a direct effect (e.g., [1, 23]). Moreover, 
multigroup analysis can avoid misinterpretation of the mean differences of hierarchical multiple 
regression approach [93].

6. We conduct the multigroup analysis in three steps: (1) the structural parameters are al-
lowed to vary freely across the two groups (e.g., high versus low environmental munificence 
groups of firms) to form a baseline model, (2) 
the structural parameters are constrained to 
be equal between the two groups to form a constrained model, and (3) equality of the paths 
between the two groups is tested using the chi-square difference between the constrained and 


VaLuE OF INFOrMatION INtEgratION t

O SuPPLY  ChaIN MaNagEMENt     191

the baseline model. a  statistically significant change in the chi-square value between the two 
groups indicates a moderating effect. a  nonsignificant or small chi-square difference indicates 
structural invariance, which suggests that the same pattern of structural relationships exists 
between the two groups and the magnitudes of the coefficients are not statistically different 
between the two groups.

7. We use median split to classify the sample firms into high and low groups to avoid the 

impact of outliers. Median split is more robust than mean split, which is subject to possible 
mean value distortion by outliners. the fact that the divided groups are unequal in size does 
suggest that the distribution is skewed as many firms have the same median score. 
t o ensure 
the validity of the analysis, we also test the hypotheses using mean split and find virtually no 
change in the findings and the conclusions remain the same.

appendix  a: Inductive Field research Methodology

We ConduCt Case studY researCh to expLore the importanCe of information integration 
to SCM and the contextually embedded factors that influence information integration 
to achieve desirable performance of businesses. Following the grounded theory [31], 
we approach these research inquiries with a fairly open mind to understand the con-
textual conditions that are pertinent to information integration and to exploring their 
relationships. We apply a holistic, ex post case study design for this purpose. this 
research approach is appropriate for us to investigate the phenomenon of information 
integration and the determinants of the situation (e.g., uncertainty faced by firms) in 
which the phenomenon is occurring, enabling us to identify the key factors that may 
affect the performance outcomes of information integration. 

Sample Selection

the relevant population of this study is wholesale trading firms in  hong Kong, which 
serve as intermediates for companies sourcing from China and which are considered 
to exhibit different SC characteristics, such as product type and demand uncertainty. 
From this population, we use the replication logic for multiple-case studies to guide 
the selection of the wholesale trading firms such that the sampling firms are purposely 
selected from one case to the next based on the match of the underlying theory [98]. 
For example, the situational determinants found in a case study are the basis to iden-
tify the next case company. this provides confidence that the emerging situational 
determinants that influence the performance effects of information integration are 
common and important in the industry [64]. 

Data Collection

In order to ensure the quality of our qualitative field research, we take several steps, 
including the use of a replicable case study protocol, an interview guide, collection of 
multiple sources of evidence, development of databases to maintain evidence, triangu-
lation with multiple sources of evidence for convergence, and key informant factual 
review of field reports [25, 98]. 
t o guide our qualitative data collection, we follow 
Yin’s [98] recommendations and develop a case study protocol with five sections: 
(1) an overview of the objectives and relevant background of the study, including a 
glossary of the terms used in the research and the details of the preparation that needs 
to be done before visiting the case companies; (2) a detailed data collection procedure 
that describes the steps taken for site visits and interviews; (3) a list of interview 
questions that cover the relevant issues of the study; (4) an outline of the case report 
to guide the write-up of the case report after data collection; and (5) the follow-up 
procedures to be taken after the write-up of case reports, which include sending the 
reports back to the informants of the case companies for factual verification.  the data 
sources include company public reports, press articles, trade publications, archival 
data, and interviews. the interview questions include, but are not limited to, “how

does your firm coordinate business activities with your trading partners?” “Why is 
information integration implemented to support your supply chain activities?” “What 
are the uncertainties that your business experiences in your supply chain?” “how 
do they affect your business?” and “how does information integration play a role in 
overcoming these uncertainties?” the interviewees are managers who work in the 
areas of information systems management, SCM, and operations management of the 
sample companies. While managing trade in an international arena, these interviewees 
possess knowledge about their firms’ internal and external information integration, 
the conditions of their business environments and operations, and the performance 
effects of information integration. 

Data analysis and hypothesis Development

We analyze the case data with the explanation-building analytic technique to build an 
explanation for the various outcomes of information integration, through which we 
identify the key situational determinants that exhibit across firms and develop hypoth-
eses for testing in a later stage of the study. We identify the key situational determinants 
by counting the pieces of evidence on a common theme, such as growing opportunities 
in market, uncertainty in SC coordination, and product characteristics relating to SC 
coordination. this technique allows us to go through successive iterations and revi-
sions of our initial theorization through comparing the findings of the cases until no 
new result is found [98]. this technique also serves as part of a hypothesis-generation 
process [31]. We compare the insights from the literature on various organizational 
theories (e.g., contingency theory) and the case evidence to develop a theoretically 
and empirically grounded set of situational factors and hypotheses for verification in 
the next stage of the study.
