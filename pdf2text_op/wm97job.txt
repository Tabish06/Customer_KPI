Summary

Although research has shown that demographic dissimilarity within groups is negatively
associated with organizational attachment-orientated variables,
few studies have
investigated its relations with other job-related variables. Focusing on relational
demographics within the context of superior–subordinate dyads, associations between
relational demographic characteristics and subordinate job attitudes and perceptions
were examined using polynomial regression. Relational race was found to correlate with
perceptions of procedural
justice and job satisfaction, but not job burnout. The
implications of these ﬁndings for future relational demographic research are discussed.

Introduction

Though individual demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, and education have
long been studied in connection with workplace phenomena (e.g. Kacmar and Ferris, 1989;
McEvoy and Cascio, 1989; Waldman and Avolio, 1986, 1991), their importance for under-
standing organizational behavior and attitudes has been the subject of greater attention in recent
years. A particularly interesting perspective on demographic characteristics, known as organ-
izational demography, asserts that distributional properties of individual and group demo-
graphic characteristics in the organization can have meaning beyond that associated with any
demographic characteristic considered in isolation (Pfeer, 1983). Researchers have begun to

explore the explanatory potential of this perspective. For example, rather than considering the
age of individuals per se as a correlate of turnover, Wagner, Pfeer and O’Reilly (1984) examined
the age distributions within the top management teams and found that heterogeneity in age
among team members was associated with turnover. Similarly, others have found the demo-
graphic composition of top management work teams to be related with turnover (Jackson, Brett,
Sessa, Cooper, Julin and Peyronnin, 1991; O’Reilly, Caldwell and Barnett, 1989). Demographic
dissimilarity in work units at lower organizational levels has also been associated with decreased
organizational attachment (e.g. McCain, O’Reilly and Pfeer, 1983; Pfeer and O’Reilly 1987;
Tsui, Egan and O’Reilly, 1992).

While organizational demography was introduced with reference to non-interacting organ-
ization members and has been studied largely in terms of group level eects, Tsui and O’Reilly
(1989) suggested that demographic variation should also be analyzed in the context of interacting
individuals. They coined the term relational demography to refer to ‘the comparative demo-
graphic characteristics of members of dyads or groups who are in a position to engage in regular
interactions’ (Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989, p. 403). Though some group-focused studies have shown
that turnover probabilities increase for individuals who are most demographically dierent from
their groups (Jackson et al., 1991; O’Reilly et al., 1989), relatively few studies have focused on the
individual level eects of demographic diversity. Likewise, few studies have targeted variables
that were not attachment-oriented. One such study was conducted by Zenger and Lawrence
(1989), who discovered that engineers who diered demographically from others in their project
teams had less frequent technical communication with team members. Also, Tsui and O’Reilly
(1989) found that race, education, and gender dierences between superiors and their sub-
ordinates were associated with role eectiveness and interpersonal attractiveness ratings given by
superiors as well as subordinates’ role ambiguity.

Relational Demography and Job-related
Perceptions and Attitudes

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether relational demography eects could be
detected in variables reﬂecting broader job-related perceptions and reactions. The relational
context of the study, the superior–subordinate dyad, is one in which frequent job-functional
interactions would be expected. Surprisingly, except for two studies (Judge and Ferris, 1993; Tsui
and O’Reilly, 1989), relational demographic eects have not been explicitly examined at the
dyadic level. When hierarchical dierentiation is an integral part of ongoing interpersonal
interactions, as in superior–subordinate dyads, relational demographic eects may surface in
variables other than those that are attachment-oriented. This follows logically because superiors
are the organizations’ immediate representative and a major force in deﬁning the realities of
subordinates’ jobs. Superior–subordinate dyadic exchanges necessarily reﬂect superiors’ decisions
concerning resource allocation, execution of responsibilities, and evaluate information about job
behavior, all of which aect subordinates because of their lesser hierarchical status in the dyad
(Graen and Scandura, 1987). Dynamics that impede superior–subordinate exchanges could
eventually aect subordinates’ perceptions of the exchange as well as attitudes about the job itself.
Relational demography eects have been explained in terms of two complimentary theories.
The more predominant of these, the similarity–attraction paradigm (Byrne, 1971), posits that
individuals tend to be attracted to those who are more similar to them. Greater similarity leads to

SUPERVISOR–SUBORDINATE DYADS

353

positive attitudes and beliefs regarding similar others. Perhaps as a result of the reliance on this
paradigm, much research on demographic eects has focused on attachment-oriented variables
or those that are socially deﬁned (e.g. role-oriented) rather than job-related perceptions and
attitudes. A second perspective, self-categorization theory (Turner, 1985), is being used increas-
ingly to explain relational demography eects. Self-categorization theory proposes that
individuals take socially deﬁned categories or groups into account when making evaluations
about others. In brief, the theory holds that groups including the self are likely to be regarded
positively whereas outgroup individuals are viewed in opposite terms. This can lead to anxiety in
interactions with outgroup individuals and avoidance of them.

Demographic attributes are highly visible markers used routinely as behavioral guides by
people in everyday life (Jackson, Stone and Alvarez, 1992). Individuals use immediately apparent
features, like demographic characteristics, as a basis for socially categorizing others and use
demographic-based social categories to make inferences about underlying dispositions and
motives of others (Stangor, Lynch, Duan and Glass, 1992). Research has shown that responses
to demographic characteristics can be predictive of interpersonal relations (e.g. Stangor, Sullivan
and Ford, 1991) and that demographic group identity may bias one’s judgments about the
fairness of others’ actions (James, 1993). In accordance with social categorization theory,
demographic dissimilarity can result in polarization between dyad members, because members
may be inﬂuenced by the dynamics that deﬁne relations between their social groups as a whole
(Turner and Oakes, 1989). Where demographic minorities exist, as is often the case in organ-
izational contexts, those in the minority may distrust the majority’s motives and behavior
(cf. Fernandez, 1981) and those in the majority may possess biases toward the minority
(cf. Moscovici and Mugny, 1983).

Given demographic dissimilarity within the dyad, superiors and subordinates may tend to
accentuate their dierences and be more prone to stereotype one another. Also, it is consistent
with the dyadic organizing framework that superiors would provide less encouragement to
subordinates with whom they have outgroup relationships (Graen and Scandura, 1987). Because
superior–subordinate exchanges are at the functional core of many jobs, social categorization
theory thus provides a basis for suggesting the subordinates who dier demographically from
superiors may be aected not only in terms of attachment-oriented variables, but broader job-
related variables as well.

Research Hypotheses

A stream of research has demonstrated that fairness concerns are fundamental to many work-
related phenomena (Greenberg, 1990; Lind and Tyler, 1988), including dyadic exchanges between
superiors and subordinates (Folger and Konovsky, 1989). A construct tapping process fairness
concerns, such as those that would arise in superior–subordinate exchanges, has been the subject of
much recent research. This construct, procedural justice, refers to the perceived fairness experienced
by employees regarding organizational procedures and policies used to make important work
decisions (Greenberg, 1990). Fairness in dyadic exchanges should be especially important to
subordinates, as they are the less powerful party in the exchange relationship (cf. Tyler, 1990).

Perceptions of procedural justice are inﬂuenced by both the interpersonal treatment people
receive from decision makers (e.g. courtesy, timely feedback, and opportunities for self-expression)
as well as the adequacy with which formal decision-making procedures are discussed with them.
Procedural justice research has demonstrated that individuals are more likely to accept authority
ﬁgures’ judgments as procedurally fair when they believe those authorities have considered their

own views (e.g. Tyler, 1990). When superiors listen to subordinates’ views, more relevant
information may be used in decision making and subordinates’ concerns may be more clearly
acknowledged, both of which should positively inﬂuence fairness perceptions (Greenberg, 1993). If
demographic dierences prevent superiors from exhibiting, or being perceived to exhibit such
behaviors, there is greater potential for subordinates to develop perceptions of unfair treatment.
Consistent with the logic of social categorization theory, the following hypothesis is oered:

Hypothesis 1: Within the superior–subordinate dyad, greater demographic diversity will be
negatively associated with subordinates’ perceptions of procedural justice.

The diminished dyadic exchange may prompt subordinates to feel that the utility of the dyadic
relationship has declined. If the quality of exchanges with superiors decreases, subordinates
could be expected to develop negative attitudes towards the structural element (i.e. the job) which
dictates that the interactions must continue nevertheless. To tap such attitudes, we employed
two variables representing basic reactions to work, job satisfaction and job burnout. Some
studies have found simple employee demographic characteristics to correlate with satisfaction
(e.g. O’Reilly and Chatman, 1986; Rhodes, 1983) and job burnout (e.g. Golembiewski,
Munzenrider and Stevenson, 1986; Jackson, Schwab and Schuler, 1986; Seltzer and Numerof,
1988), but none have considered whether these two variables are associated with relational
demographics.

According to social categorization theory, interaction dynamics should be such that demo-
graphic dierences correlate negatively with job satisfaction and positively with job burnout. The
rationale for this supposition stems partly from perspectives of jobs that depict them as quasi-
stable and involving on-going negotiations of duties and responsibilities (cf. Graen and
Scandura, 1987; Ilgen and Hollenbeck, 1991). Emergent task elements—aspects of subordinates’
work that are by deﬁnition subjective, personal, and dynamic—are incorporated into the job as
necessary through role making processes. Social categorization theory intimates that superiors
and subordinates who dier demographically should have more di(cid:129)culty accomplishing these
processes, due to the dierent perspectives they hold of each other (and perhaps of the emergent
task elements themselves). Because role making is central in job accomplishment (Ilgen and
Hollenbeck, 1991), productive exchanges become more problematic under such conditions.
Subordinates experiencing di(cid:129)culties in the role/job making process should thus experience
lower overall job satisfaction.

At least with regard to gender and race demographics, Ford (1980, 1985) has described
research suggesting that minorities experience greater stress when supervised by majority, as
compared to minority, group members. Extrapolating from social categorization theory,
demographically dierent subordinates may experience greater anxiety and stress in interactions
with superiors and, in the extreme, come to view their jobs as frustrating, dead-end propositions.
For such individuals, job burnout potential will be elevated. Subordinates who must continue in
uncomfortable dyadic relationships with superiors may feel trapped in emotionally exhausting
exchanges, and emotional exhaustion is a primary indicator of burnout (Cordes and Dougherty,
1993). Furthermore, subordinates who perceive themselves to have dysfunctional exchanges may
harbor a sense of futility about discussing work issues with superiors. For them, the potential
beneﬁts of supervisory support and counseling, important mechanisms for coping with stressful
jobs (Russell, Altmaier and Van Velzen, 1987), would become restricted.

Consistent with these ideas, the following hypothesis is oered:

Hypothesis 2: Within the superior–subordinate dyad, greater demographic diversity will be
negatively associated with subordinates’
job satisfaction and positively associated with
subordinates’ job burnout

Method

Sample

Employees working at two service-oriented companies located in the southeastern United States,
a public utilities company and computer services company, provided data for the study. Jobs
performed by these employees were varied, but all involved a degree of face-to-face service contact
with others. Presidents of both companies circulated memoranda supporting the study and
highlighting the potential beneﬁt for organizational functioning. Study data were collected as part
of an investigation directed toward answering questions about the organizations’ management
systems. The survey cover letter informed employees that participation was voluntary and
conﬁdential, that data would be used for research purposes only, and that all completed surveys
were to be mailed directly to the researchers. Questionnaires were sent to 170 subordinates and
their immediate superiors (n (cid:136) 170 dyads). A follow-up reminder was sent to potential
respondents if they had not answered within a certain time span. A total of 296 questionnaires
were returned for a response rate of 87 per cent; response rates were similar for superiors
(n (cid:136) 151; 89 per cent) and subordinates (n (cid:136) 145; 85 per cent). The returned questionnaires
included 124 (75 per cent) dyads with the complete information required for the study.

Among superiors, 3.2 per cent were African American; among subordinates, 16.1 per cent
were African American. Compared to subordinates, superiors were older, with slightly higher
education levels. The majority of superiors were Caucasian, male (62.1 per cent), and educated
beyond the high school level (89.5 per cent). The average age of the superiors was 38.69 years. An
approximately equal number of males (49.2 per cent) and females comprised the subordinate
sample. The majority of subordinates were Caucasian and had participated in educational experi-
ences beyond the high school level (86.3 per cent). The mean subordinate age was 33.56 years.

Measures

Demographic characteristics
While there are a number of demographic characteristics by which superiors and subordinates
may be categorized, four were selected for use in the present study. In keeping with other recent
demography research (Tsui et al., 1992; Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989), age, gender, and race were used
because these characteristics are highly relevant for self-categorization and easily observable.
Superior–subordinate dierences on these characteristics would be readily discernable. Though
not observable like the other variable, education was also selected for use as per previous
relational demography research (Tsui et al., 1992; Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989).

Superior and subordinate demographic attributes of age, gender, and race were obtained from
personnel records. In addition, superiors and subordinates each provided information about
their own education level. Gender was coded as 0 (cid:136) male and 1 (cid:136) female. Race was coded as
0 (cid:136) Caucasian and 1 (cid:136) African American. Age was measured in years and education was
assessed using nine dierent categories, ranging from ‘non-high school graduate’ to ‘doctoral
degree’, with higher values corresponding to higher school education levels.

Satisfaction
Subordinates’ general job satisfaction was assessed using the 5-item subscale from the Job
Diagnostic Survey (Hackman and Oldham, 1980). A 7-point response scale was used, with higher

scores indicating greater satisfaction ((cid:11) (cid:136) 0:79). Items were averaged to obtain scale scores.
Sample items include: ‘Generally speaking, I am very satisﬁed with this job’, and ‘I am generally
satisﬁed with the kind of work I do in this job’.

Burnout
Subordinates’ job burnout was measured using the 10-item Gillespie–Numerof Burnout Inven-
tory (Form A; Seltzer and Numerof, 1988). An 8-point scale was employed, with higher scores
indicating greater levels of job burnout ((cid:11) (cid:136) 0:91). Items were averaged to obtain scale scores.
Sample items are: ‘I feel like giving up on my job’, ‘I feel buried in my job’, ‘I’m discouraged
about my work’, and ‘I feel unable to get out from under my work’.

Procedural justice
Given the dyadic focus of our study, subordinate perceptions of procedural justice were assessed
using items from Folger and Konovsky (1989). The items concerned formal and informal
supervisory activities shown to aect perceptions of procedural
justice (e.g. supervisors’
performance feedback, overall communication, honesty and fairness in dealing with sub-
ordinates, and subordinates’ voice in planning procedures). For all 15 items, a 7-point response
scale was used, with higher scores indicating that greater procedural justice was perceived by the
subordinate ((cid:11) (cid:136) 0:94). Responses to the items were averaged to obtain scale scores. Sample
items include: ‘My supervisor shows a real interest in trying to be fair’, ‘My supervisor gets input
from me before giving raise/promotion recommendations’,
‘My supervisor gives me an
opportunity to express my side’, ‘My supervisor ﬁnds out how well I think I am doing my
job’, and ‘My supervisor is honest and ethical in dealing with me’.

Because procedural justice, job satisfaction, and job burnout could be expected to inter-
correlate, we conducted a conﬁrmatory factor analysis to examine their viability as separate
scales. Models having large numbers of variables often result in failure to ﬁnd a good ﬁtting
model (Bentler and Chou, 1987). Therefore, following procedures used by others (e.g. Brooke,
Russell and Price, 1988; Mathieu and Farr, 1991), we ﬁrst reduced the number of indicators of
the job burnout and procedural justice factors to ﬁve each, which was equal to the number of
indicators for the job satisfaction factor. The comparative ﬁt index (CFI, Bentler, 1990) was
used to assess the ﬁt for this model because it prevents the underestimation of ﬁt in smaller
samples. A CFI of 0.94 was obtained for the correlated three-factor model, indicating an
acceptable level of ﬁt. A model positing that a single factor underlies the three scales did not ﬁt
well (CFI (cid:136) 0:62). These results suggest that the three work reactions could be examined as
separate variables.

Analyses

Relational demographics have often been researched by computing squared dierence measures
between superior and subordinate demographic characteristics (e.g. Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989),
and then investigating correlates of these measures. Owing to some criticism of this approach
(Edwards, 1994), the present study used polynomial regression in examining potential correlates
of relational demographics. The general
logic underlying polynomial regression has been
described thoroughly elsewhere (e.g. Edwards, 1993, 1994); we thus focus only on the operational
details of this procedure as applied in the present study. Letting A denote a subordinate

demographic variable and B denote a superior variable, the polynomial regression procedure
involved generating the following set of terms for each of the four demographics: A, B, AB, A2,
and B2. In the tradition of Tsui and O’Reilly (1989), all of the terms for each of the four
demographics were entered simultaneously into one equation, which in turn was used to predict
variance in job satisfaction, burnout, and perceived procedural justice. Following this procedure
allowed us to estimate the eects of dierences across the four demographic variables simul-
taneously. If the hypothesized pattern of signiﬁcant terms appeared for a particular demographic
variable in this omnibus polynomial regression equation, further testing could be performed by
entering all terms for that demographic variable only in a separate regression equation. This
follow-up analysis could better indicate whether dierences on that demographic variable alone
were important.

Results

Descriptive statistics and correlations among study variables are listed in Table 1. Correlations
between the subordinates’ and superiors’ demographics indicated that relations between all like
variables were positive and signiﬁcant. The relations of subordinate and superior demographics
with job satisfaction, job burnout, and procedural justice were generally low whereas moderate
intercorrelations were found among the latter three variables.

Separate omnibus polynomial regressions were used in testing hypotheses for each of the work
reactions. All terms (i.e. A, B, AB, A2, and B2 as deﬁned previously) were entered into the
regressions as a block. In line with Edwards and Cooper (1990), the idea that demographic
dierences correlate with work reactions would be supported if the higher-order terms
(i.e. A2, AB, and B2) for satisfaction and justice were signiﬁcant, with the signs of the terms being
negative, positive, and negative, respectively. An opposite pattern of signiﬁcant signs—positive,
negative, positive—should be found for burnout. It is important to note that because gender and
race were coded as dichotomous (0–1) variables, the simple and squared terms of gender and
race are redundant and could not both enter the polynomial regression equation. Thus, for these
two variables, three terms (A/A2, AB, and B/B2) comprised the complete demographic informa-
tion in the omnibus polynomial regressions.

Table 2 displays the beta weights produced in each of the three omnibus polynomial
regressions1. As can be seen, the hypothesized pattern of relationships appeared only for race, in
connection with job satisfaction and procedural
justice. For burnout, the superior and
subordinate-by-superior terms were signiﬁcant, but the subordinate demographic was not.

We followed up the omnibus polynomial regression analyses with ones that considered the
eect of demographic dierences in race alone. When focusing solely on a dichotomous variable
such as race, polynomial regression is inappropriate. Instead, a planned contrast comparing the
mean of the same-race dyads to the mean of the mixed-race dyads may be used. This test is
analogous to tests of constraints described in Edwards (1994). There were 106 same-race dyads
(85 per cent) and 18 (15 per cent) mixed-race dyads. These same- and mixed-race dyads

1 As noted above, the simple and squared terms for dichotomous variables such as race are redundant. We arbitrarily
listed squared (rather than simple) terms for race and gender in Table 2 to communicate that the results were consistent
with the pattern of higher-order terms that was hypothesized to appear in the omnibus polynomial regressions.

percentages were comparable to those found in other relational demography studies (e.g. Tsui
and O’Reilly, 1989) For job satisfaction, subordinates in mixed-race dyads exhibited lower mean
satisfaction (Mmixed (cid:136) 4:85 versus Msame (cid:136) 5:49; F(cid:133)1;122(cid:134) (cid:136) 5:21; p < 0:024) and perceived there

to be less procedural
compared to those in same-race dyads.

Although the hypothesized pattern of signiﬁcant terms was found only for race, a subordinate-
by-superior age interaction also surfaced in connection with job satisfaction and procedural
justice. We conducted a polynomial regression analysis including only the ﬁve terms for the
demographic variable of age to examine this eect more closely. The subordinate-by-superior
interaction term was again signiﬁcant ( p < 0:04), but the R2 for the polynomial regression
equation itself was not signiﬁcant. Given that the interaction eect was not hypothesized to
occur alone, we did not attempt to interpret this interaction in the context of a nonsigniﬁcant
overall F (cf. Bedeian and Mossholder, 1994).

Discussion and Implications

In the face of growing workforce diversity, organizations should seek a broader understanding of
processes associated with demographic dierences (cf. Jackson et al., 1992). Within the conﬁnes
of the superior–subordinate dyad, relational demography has been found to correlate with
subordinates’ performance and role outcomes (Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989). The present study
extends this line of research, ﬁnding that relational demographics accounted for signiﬁcant
amounts of variance in job-related variables that were not strictly attachment-oriented. Signiﬁ-
cant results were found in connection with relational race, but not relational age, gender, or
education. These results are in line with recent research underscoring that race is a salient
demographic variable in the social context of organizations (Ibarra, 1995).

In the present study, the racial composition of dyads was important for understanding sub-
ordinates’ job satisfaction and their perceptions of procedural justice. As hypothesized, mixed-
race dyads occasioned less positive reactions on these variables than did same-race dyads. When
racial dissimilarity is a deﬁning contextual feature, subordinates may have a heightened sensi-
tivity about exchanges with superiors. Actions by the superior that might be considered less
consequential in same-race dyads could have repercussions in mixed-race dyads (Fernandez,
1981; Ford, 1985).

Some additional comments are necessary to put our ﬁndings in perspective. The use of a
polynomial regression approach resulted in a smaller than desirable subjects-to-parameter ratio
in the analyses. Thus, replications of the study are needed to bolster the generalizability of our
ﬁndings. It should also be noted that our procedural justice measure focused on interaction
dynamics salient within superior–subordinate dyads. Future relational demography research
should employ measures that capture other procedural dimensions (e.g. organizational policies).
Finally, demographic information was collected from personnel ﬁles (except for education level
which was self-reported by superiors and subordinates). Thus, common method variance would
seem to be a factor in the associations that were found between relational demographic and the
subordinate work reactions.

Researchers should begin to consider the broader eects of relational demography in
organizational settings. A contribution of the present study is to show that, at least in a dyadic
context, the impact of demographic diversity may have some potentially important conse-
quences where job-related perceptions and attitudes are concerned. Additional relational
demography research on superior–subordinate dyads should be conducted, given that this
linkage is fundamental in organizations. Being primary conduits for policy implementation,
superiors must become adept at managing increasing diversity among their subordinates. With
regard to the context of dyadic exchange, it is appropriate for organizations interested in
creating a climate of support and acceptance to sensitize superiors to varying perspectives of
fairness that may be held by demographically diverse subordinates. Accordingly, superiors
should endeavor to learn and exhibit behaviors that constitute fair treatment. Skill-building
training that focuses on how to respond to diversity in the workplace (e.g. Cox and Blake,
1991) may help to accomplish this goal. In the face of demographic diversity, superiors may
also need to expand and adjust their interaction skills, depending on the types of subordinates
they manage. Making such adjustments may facilitate job-relevant interactions and have a
positive eect regarding subordinates’ job satisfaction. They might also permit superiors to
develop more empathetic relationships with demographically dierent subordinates. Such
suggestions are not completely new; however, they may be taking on a new sense of urgency
with increasing workplace diversity. Organizations must begin to develop more comprehensive

views of demographic diversity so that they may be proactive in managing the challenges it
presents.
