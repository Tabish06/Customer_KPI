The HRM  literature  emphasises the importance of people in  enhancing  firm
performance or  even creating competitive advantage. This  study provides further
evidence on  the link between  so-called high performance work systems and firm
performance and relates these to organisational culture. In total 175 organisations from
different sectors in the Netherlands participated. Senior HR managers were questioned
on HRM practices and chief executives on organisational culture. Three different groups
of personnel are distinguished in the measures: core employees, managers and specialist
professional staff. One high performance work system could be distinguished, consisting
of a combination of practices with an emphasis on employee development, strict selection
and providing  an  overarching goal or direction.  Results of  regression  analyses
controlling for sector, ® rm size and  age show a signi® cant impact of this system on
several performance outcomes (perceived economic  outcomes, beyond contract and
absenteeism), as well as positive  relationships with three organisational  culture
orientations. Practices that are not part of this combination also show some positive (but
limited) links with culture and outcomes.

T he  role  of  employees  or  `human  resources’   in  enhancing  organisational

performance  or  creating  sustained  competitive  advantage  has  attracted  much
research  attention. A single,  widely  accepted  definition  of  human  resource
management does not exist, but Storey (1995: 5) de® nes HRM as `a distinctive approach
to  employment  management  which  seeks  to  achieve  competitive  advantage  through
the  strategic  deployment  of a highly  committed  and  capable workforce,  using  an
integrated  array  of  cultural, structural  and  personnel  techniques’.  Within  the  HRM
field,  several  authors  argue  for  the  existence  of so-called  `high  involvement  work
practices’ (eg Delaney  and  Huselid,  1996) or  `high  performance  work  practices’ (eg
Huselid, 1995) that are likely to result in increased organisational performance. Authors
also propose  a synergistic  effect of certain  combinations  of  practices  (eg  Delery,  1998;
Wright  and  McMahan,  1992). Such  combinations  are  sometimes  labelled  high
performance work systems or high involvement work systems (eg Huselid, 1995). Such
systems  have  been  related to a range  of outcomes and  measures  of ® rm  performance
(see, for  example, Arthur,  1992; Batt, 2002; Becker  and  Gerhart,  1996; Delaney  and
Huselid,  1996; Guthrie,  2001; Huselid,  1995; Ichniowski  et  al,  1996; Ichniowski  and
Shaw,  1999; MacDuf® e,  1995). Overall,  results  of empirical  work  suggest  substantial
bene® ts from managing human resources effectively, although many questions remain
unanswered (Delery, 1998).

High performance work systems, organisational culture and rm effectiveness

Many of the studies in this area were carried out in the US (eg Huselid, 1995) or UK
(eg Guest,  2001) contexts, and  an interesting  question  is  whether  similar  results  are
found  in other countries. The  study described  here  took place in the  Netherlands  and
aims  to offer a test  of the  high  performance  work  practices/® rm  performance  link  in
the  Dutch  context. To meet  this  aim  we  ® rst  test  whether  the high  performance  work
practices measured in our study can be combined into high performance work systems.
Next,  we  test  whether   such  practices  explain  different  outcomes  (perceived
organisational  and  economic  performance,  employees’  willingness  to  go  beyond
contract, absenteeism  and  turnover).  The  study  also aims  to add  to previous  research
by  relating   hig h  performa nce  work   practices  to  an  established   measure  of
organisational  culture.  Thus,  we  assess  whether  high  performance  work  practices
employed  by the  organisation  can be empirically  combined  into  high  performance
work  systems  and  how  they  relate  to  several  performance  measures  as  well  as
organisational culture in a sample of 175 Dutch organisations.

SYSTEMS AND PERFORMANCE

The  relationship  between  high  performance  work  practices or  systems  and  firm
performance has been the topic of a heated debate over the last decade (eg Wright and
Snell,  1998; Guest,  1999; Purcell,  1999; Gerhart  et  al,  2000a). Signi® cant progress  has
been  made  in  unravelling  the  links  between  such  systems  and  performance,  even
though  several  theoretical  and  empirical  problems  remain.  For  example,  as Purcell
(1999), Guest (2001) and others  have noted, there  is no clear consensus  on the number
or  content  of  the  practices  that  should  be included.  Many  different  practices  are
studied. Also, whereas some focus on (separate) practices and their effects (eg Dyer and
Reeves  1995; Guest, 1997; Osterman,  1994), others  take a systems  approach and  argue
for  synergetic  effects  of  combinations  of practices  (eg Arthur, 1994; Bae  and  Lawler,
2000; Ichniowski  et al, 1997; Koch and  McGrath, 1996). Although  empirical  support is
found for positive effects of some such (combinations of) practices, many issues remain
unclear. For  example,  Delery  (1998) points  out  that HRM  practices  do  not  necessarily
only have synergistic effects, but may also act as substitutes or work against each other.
Also,  it  is  not  always  clear  when  a  single  `policy’  or  `practice’ is  in  fact a `system’  or
`bundle’ (eg Boselie and Dietz, 2003). For example, training and development is usually
seen  as  a single  HRM  practice. However,  it  can be  operationalised  as  management
development,  internal  promotion,  career  planning  or  skills  training.  Several  of these
may  be  present  in  an organisation  and,  as  such,  `employee  development’  can also be
seen as a bundle of related and aligned practices in this area. 

Boselie  and   Dietz  (2003) review  published articles  focusing  on  the  high
performance work practices/performance link to assess which practices are most often
included.  They  find  that  practices  related  to  employee  development  and  training,
participation and  empowerment,  information  sharing  and  compensation  systems  are
most  often  mentioned  as  part  of the  high  involvement  or  high  performance  work
practices or systems approach. Batt (2002) reaches a similar conclusion. She states that
high  involvement  work  systems  generally  include  `relatively  high  skill  requirements;
work designed so that employees have discretion and opportunity to use their skills in
collaboration with other workers; and an incentive structure that enhances motivation
and  commitment’  (Batt, 2002: 587). Delaney  and  Huselid  (1996) mention  employee
participation  and  empowerment,  job  redesign   including  team-based  systems,
extensive  employee  training  and  performance-contingent  incentive  compensation  as
practices  that are  likely  to  improve  organisational  performance.  However,  the

operationalisation  of these  practices varies  widely  in  different  studies  and a range  of
other  practices is also included  in many models  (for instance, in  the area of selection
and performance appraisal). 

The  context in  which  organisations  operate may  limit  or  enhance  the  usefulness,
distinctiveness  and success of high performance work practices or systems. The current
study was carried  out in  the  Netherlands.  Dutch labour laws  are  strict  and  some  high
performance  work  practices  that  vary  widely  elsewhere  are  required  by law  or
regulated in the Netherlands  (eg Boselie et al, 2001). Thus, in some areas ® rms have less
leeway to distinguish themselves from other employers. For example, the Dutch system
of works  councils  ensures  employee  participation  (every  firm  of more  than  50
employees  is  obliged  by law to have  a works  council) and  Dutch  law provides  the
representatives  of the  employees  with  a number  of  rights  towards  employers  and
management.  There  are  strict  laws  on  working  conditions  regulating,  for  example,
maximum numbers of hours, safety and equipment. Also, trade unions are involved in
an extensive system of collective bargaining at the sector level. For example, sector-level
wage  agreements  are  strict  and  renegotiated  regularly, resulting  in  wage  compression.
Thus,  an individual  organisation’s  freedom  to  vary  reward  schemes  is  much  more
limited  in  the  Netherlands  than,  for  instance,  in  the  US.  Collective  agreements  also
ensure  relatively  high  job  security.  Thus,  regulations  constrain  or  prescribe  several
practices  found  in  the  high  performance  work  systems  literature  (including  employee
participation, employment  security  and  compensation). Of course, this  does  not  mean
that there  is no  room for manoeuvre. Other  practices are less  regulated. Also,  whereas
labour  legislation  and  collective  bargaining  agreements set  the  boundaries,  HR
managers can, within these boundaries, tailor the speci® cs to their organisation.

In  the  current  study  we  included  a  set  of practices  that have  been  suggested  or
shown  to be part of high performance work systems (taking the Dutch system  of laws
and  regulations  into  account). We  focus  on  practices  in  the  following  areas:  strict
selection,  incentive  pay  and  pro® t  sharing,  the  use  of job  redesign  and  task  analysis,
informa tion  sha ring   and   employee  autonomy  (as  an  operationa lis ation  of
participation),  performance  appraisal, teamwork,  training,  and  an  emphasis  on
keeping  skil ls  up to date,  having  opportuniti es  for internal  promotion  and
management  development,  as  well  as  having  an  overarching  philosophy  (a  mission
statement and HRM strategy). This list is not exhaustive, but encompasses many of the
relevant  high  performance  work  practices  identi® ed  in  previous  empirical  as  well  as
theoretical  work  (eg  Huselid,  1995; Delaney  and  Huselid,  1996; Guest,  1997; Guthrie,
2001). A more detailed  description  of each  of  the  practices,  as  well  as  thei r
operationalisation, is provided in the `Method’  section. 

Many studies measure practices without taking into account that organisations may
use  different  practices  for  different  groups  of  personnel  (a  notable exception  is  the
study  by  Lepak  and  Snell,  2002). For  instance,  managers  are  often  selected  and
rewarded  in  a  different  way  from  other  employees.  This  study  taps the  use  of high
performance  work  practices for  three  different  groups  of  personnel,  namely  core
production  or  service  employees,  line  managers  and  specialist  staff (such as technical
experts  or  professional  specialists).  This  offers  the  opportunity  to check  whether
practices are applied similarly for these different groups.

The lack of consensus regarding  which high performance work practices should be
included  also  holds  for  the  aspects  of firm  performance  that these  practices  are
proposed  to affect.  Studies assess  different  outcomes  ranging  from  financial
performance (eg Huselid et al, 1997) or ® rm productivity (eg Guthrie, 2001) to employee
commitment (eg Whitener, 2001), absenteeism (eg Guest and Peccei, 1994) and customer

satisfaction (eg Rogg et al, 2001). Vast differences  also exist  in the operationalisation of
such  measures  (Boselie  and  Dietz,  2003).  For  example,  financial  performance  is
operationalised  as sales  or  return  on  sales,  return  on  investment,  return  on  assets,
return  on equity or  pro® t (which  can again  be measured  in different  ways). Similarly,
productivity  is  de® ned  in  many  ways  (for  example,  in  terms  of  sales  per  employee,
time required to produce a product or as output divided by labour input).

Here, we use perceived measures of organisational performance. Studies by Delaney
and  Huselid  (1996) and  Bae  and  Lawler  (2000) use  similar  measures. As  Guest (2001)
points out, using measures of a perceptual nature is often hard to avoid when different
types of organisations from vastly different sectors are studied simultaneously. We also
relate  high  performance  work  practices  to behavioural  measures  of  turnover  and
absenteeism  (eg Guest and  Peccei,  1994). Finally,  we  assess  managers’  assessments  of
employees’  willingness  to  go  beyond  contract, which  Storey  (1995) suggests  to  be an
important  HRM  outcome.  We  expect high  performance  work  practices  to  correlate
positively  with  perceived  performance,  employees’  willingness  to go  beyond  contract
and  negatively  with  turnover  and  absenteeism.  Another  important  element  of  this
study  is  the  link  between  high  performance  work  practices  and  culture,  which  is
explored below.

ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE

HRM  is  often  associated  with  organisational  culture (see,  for  example,  Guest,  1994;
Legge,  1995; Mabey  and  Salaman, 1995). According  to  Deal  and  Kennedy  (1982),
successful ® rms distinguish  themselves  from less  successful ones through their  clearly
articulated  and  shared  norms  and  values  regarding  organisational  functioning.  They
hold that `people are a company’s greatest resource, and the way to manage them is not
directly  by computer reports,  but by the  subtle cues of a culture’  (Deal  and  Kennedy,
1982: 15). In their  view,  creating  a strong  organisational  culture  is  a  powerful tool to
in¯ uence  employees’  behaviour  and  improve  performance.  The  informal  rules  may
help  employees  to understand  what  is  expected  of them  and  such  a culture may  also
help  people  feel  better  about their  efforts  on  behalf  of  the  organisation.  Or,  as Guest
puts it: `Employees perform because they want to, or at least feel obliged to, rather than
in response to ® nancial incentives or bureaucratic requirements’ (Guest, 1994: 254). 

Guest (1994) suggests  that, through  selection, socialisation and training  procedures,
HRM  may  contribute  to both  the  emergence  and  maintenance  of  shared  patterns  of
norms, values and informal rules within organisations. Thus, HRM practices and, more
speci® cally,  high  performance  work  practices  may  have  an impact on  organisational
culture (which in research  would imply treating  culture as a dependent  variable). One
can also argue  the  reverse.  The  dominant  culture may  in¯ uence  the  HRM  policy  and
practices adopted by organisations. Likely, the in¯ uence runs both ways. Another type
of proposition worth exploring is whether performance is better where  HRM practices
and  culture align  (a  ® t perspective).  Research  on  all these  perspectives  is  useful. Our
empirical tests focus mainly on the ® rst perspective. We assess the relationship between
high  performance  work  practices and  culture  orientations  and  assess  whether  such
practices explain variance in culture orientations.

Many  different  de® nitions  of  culture  have  been  proposed  over  the  years  (see,  for
example, Denison, 1996). Here, we de® ne organisational culture as `a set of core values,
behavioural norms, artefacts and behavioural patterns which govern the way people in
an  organisation  interact  with  each  other  and  invest  energy  in  their  jobs  and  the
organisation  at  large’   (Van  Muijen et  al,  1992: 250). Two  layers  of  culture can  be

58

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, VOL 14 NO 1, 2004


Deanne N. Den Hartog and Robert M. Verburg 

distinguished  in  this  de® nition.  The  expressive  symbols  constitute  the  behavioural
component of organisational culture ±
 the visible top layer in which culture manifests
itself. The deeper layer of culture is formed by invisible norms and values. These create
the underlying causes of behaviour. 

Managers  and  especially  top  managers  play  a  crucial  role  in  culture  formation  as
they embed and transmit culture in the thinking, feeling and behaviour of members of
the  organisation. According  to Schein  (1992), managers  have  several  primary  `culture
embedding mechanisms’. These include what they as leaders regularly pay attention to
 measure  and  control; how  they  react  to  organisational  crises;  and  their  role  in
modelling  and  coaching. High  performance  work  practices  can  also  act as culture
embedding  mechanisms.  Examples of HRM practices that can play such a role are the
observed  criteria  by which  resources,  rewards  and  status  are  allocated  in  the
organisation  and the  criteria  used to recruit,  select, promote, retire  or excommunicate
organisational  members.  Kerr  and  Slocum (1987), for  instance,  describe  two types  of
corporate reward systems that give rise to different cultures (so-called clan and market
cultures,  cf Ouchi, 1981). As  such, high  performance  work  practices  may  play  an
important  role  in  shaping  culture.  Schein  (1992) also describes  several  secondary
`culture articulation and reinforcement’  mechanisms. These  are secondary  in the sense
that they work only when they are in line with the primary mechanisms. These include
organisational  structure, syst ems  and  procedures,  and  formal  statement s  of
organisational  values,  philosophy  or  creed.  These  again  suggest  that  different  high
performance work practices may in¯ uence organisational culture.  

In this  study  we  used  the  FOCUS measure of organisational  culture. FOCUS is  an
interna tional  group  of  researchers  who  developed  a  questionnaire  to measure
organisational  culture  (Van Muijen  et  al,  1999). The  questionnaire  is  based  on  the
`competing  values’ model  (Quinn, 1988). This  model  consists of two dimensions  with
contrasting poles (see Figure 1). The ® rst dimension represents the organisation’s focus.
This is either directed internally, which makes the organisation itself, its processes or its
people  central,  or  externally,  in  which  case the  relation  of  the  organisation  with  its
environment  is  emphasised.  The  second  dimensio n  contrasts  the  emphasis  on
flexibility  and  control.  Combining  the  two  dimensions  yields  four organisational
culture  orientations  (cf Quinn,  1988). Organisations  can score  high  or  low  on  any

combination of  these  dimensions.  The  four orientations  are  labelled  the  support,  the
innovative,  the  rules  and  the  goal  orientation  (see also  Den  Hartog  et al, 1996; Van
Muijen and Koopman, 1996; Van Muijen et al, 1999).

Central  to the  support orientation  are  concepts such  as co-operation, social, mutual
trust, group cohesion and individual  growth. Commitment  of the individual  employee
is emphasised. High performance work practices aimed at employee development seem
especially  relevant  for  this  orientation.  The  innovative  orientation  is  characterised  by
concepts such as searching for new information in the environment,  creativity, openness
to change, competition, anticipation and experimentation. Control from above is neither
possible  nor  required,  and  management  expects flexibility  and  involvement  of
employees.  High  performance  work  practices emphasising  ¯ exibility,  empowerment
and openness  seem  most  relevant  for this orientation.  The  goal orientation  emphasises
rationality, objectives, productivity and functionality. Ef® ciency and accomplishment of
employees  is  emphasised.  High  performance  work  practices emphasising  progress
towards  targets  such  as performance  measurement  and  performance-related  pay seem
relevant  here.  The  rules  orientation  emphasises  respect  for authority,  rationality  of
procedures and  division  of work.  The  structure  is  hierarchical.  Compliance is  stressed.
Practices  emphasising  control  and  following  procedures  are  likely  to be  related  to  this
orientation.  Such  practices are  usually  not  proposed  to  be  part of  high  performance
work  systems.  Therefore , the  relationship  between such  systems  and  the  rules
orientation is likely to be lower than for the other orientations.

To  date,  the  empirical  research  evidence  regarding  the  link  between  culture,  high
performance work practices and performance is limited. In this study we explore these
relationships  using  top managers  as key  informants.  In order  to decrease  problems of
same-source  bias, two  key  informants  per  organisation  were  involved  (HR  directors
provided information on HRM while chief executives discussed organisational culture).
Thus,  we  focus  on  high  performance  work  practices,  as  rated  by HR  directors,  and
organisational  culture orientations  as perceived  by top managers  (chief executives),  as
well as outcome measures (provided by both informants). 

METHOD

The highest ranking HR manager and the chief executive (or, when the chief executive was
not  available,  another  member  of  top management) of  678 organisations  in  the
Netherlands  were  sent  questionnaires.  The  sample  was drawn  from  the  database of  the
Netherlands  Association  for Personnel  Management  (NVP) which  has  more  than  5,000
members.  Not all members  are  senior  HR  managers,  but the  database includes  their
positions. From the category of senior HR or personnel directors (ie top management level)
a random selection of names was made. These HR directors were sent two questionnaires.
The  ® rst  was the  human  resource  management  inventory,  a  questionnaire assessing  the
HRM practices employed  by the organisation. HR managers  were  asked to ®
ll these  out
personally. The second questionnaire was an organisational culture and ® rm performance
questionnaire (see below). The HR managers were asked to give this second questionnaire
to the chief executive to ® ll out (or, if that was not possible, to another member of the top
management  team). The  HR  managers  were  asked  to  return  both questionnaires. Three
weeks  later, a reminder  was sent. Two weeks  after that the  researchers  called  those who
had  not  responded  to request  their  participation. Dillman  (1978) recommends  such  a
procedure using reminders and a follow-up call in survey studies. 

In total, 175 complete  sets  of  two  questionnaires  were  returned  ±

  a 25.8 per  cent
response  rate. This  response  rate  is comparable to other studies. For  instance, Huselid

60

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, VOL 14 NO 1, 2004


Deanne N. Den Hartog and Robert M. Verburg 

(1995) reports a 28 per cent response, Delery and Doty (1996) 21 per cent and Brewster
and Hegewisch (1994) 22 per cent. The follow-up calls provided the possibility to check
reasons for non-response. Fourteen per cent of the HR managers who were approached
had  left  the  organisation. A further  3  per  cent  indicated  that  they  had  terminated
membership  of  the  NVP and  were  not  interested  in  participating  in  such  a  survey
supported by them. (Many managers  who did respond indicated that the fact that the
NVP supported the survey to them  was one of the reasons  to participate.) Finally, the
remaining reasons given for non-response were lack of time and `survey-fatigue’. 

Table 1 shows sector and number of employees  of organisations  in the sample. The
largest group of organisations was in the industrial sector, followed by foundations and
governmental  institutions,  healthcare  and  consulting  ® rms. A substantial  percentage
was in  the  miscellaneous  group, including  sectors such  as transport  and  distribution,
construction, publishing and food services. Organisation size varied. Only a few small
® rms (fewer than 50 employees) were found in the sample (1.1 per cent). A total of 17.7
per  cent  were  relatively  large  organisations  (>  1,000 employees),  the  rest  were  in
between. The age of the participating ® rms varied from one year to 385 years; 16.6 per
cent  were  relatively  young  and  founded  up to 10 years  previously;  13.1 per  cent  had
existed  between  10 and  25  years  and  44.5 per  cent  between  25 and  100 years.  The
remainder  had been active even longer. In the regression analyses presented below we
will  control  for  sector,  age  and  size  of  the  organisation.  The  firms  also  indicated  a
strong  emphasis  on  change.  Over  65  per  cent  indicated  that  they  were  involved  in
major  restructuring  in  the  previous  three  years  and  72 per  cent  said  that  they  had
attempted to change culture in the same period.

MEASURES

As stated, survey measures of HRM, culture and outcomes were used. We ® rst describe
those completed by senior HR managers and next the ones ®
lled out by chief executives.

HR managers 

HRM items and scales  The Human Resource Management Inventory used in this study
was  developed  and  tested  in  pilot  studies  by  Verburg  (1998). The  questionnaire  asks
HR managers to provide information on an array of HRM practices in domains such as
recruitment  and  selection,  performance  appraisal  and  rewards  and  training  and
development,  as  well  as  job  design,  participation  and  task  ful®
lment.  In  most  items,
three  groups  of personnel  are  distinguished,  namely  core  employees  (de® ned  in  the

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, VOL 14 NO 1, 2004

questionnaire  as  core  employees  involved  in  the  primary  process  of  the  organisation,
such  as core  production  or  service  employees),  specialists/staff  members  and
managers. For instance, in an item referring to training and development, HR managers
are asked to indicate how  many days  a year  people receive  training  (see also Huselid,
1995). In this study HR managers were asked to indicate this separately for each of the
three aforementioned groups of employees. 

We  selected  items  referring  to practices  that have  been  associated  with  high
performance  or  high  involvement  work  systems  in  previous  work  (see, for  example,
Huselid,  1995; Delaney  and  Huselid,  1996; Guthrie,  2001; Rogg  et al,  2001; Snell  and
Dean, 1992). Different response formats were used. Some items required an answer on a
® ve-point  scale;  others  asked  respondents  to  provide  percentages,  rate  frequencies  or
provide a `Yes’ and `No’ answer, indicating whether or not the practice was followed by
the organisation. This  mix of formats is also found in previous research  (eg Rogg et al,
2001; Vandenberg et al, 1999). Where possible, we combined items into scales. All items
and scales are presented  in detail below. Most of the items are similar  to those used in
previous  research. A difference  with  previous  measures  is  that  HR  managers  were
asked  to provide  information  for  three  groups  of  employees.  Below, we  ® rst  describe
the separate items  for the  different  practices and then  analyse whether  these  practices
can be meaningfully combined. 

Following  studies  by  Huselid  (1995) and  others,  we  included  selectivity  in  hiring.
This helps ensure that organisations get highly skilled  and quali® ed people for the job,
and has a symbolic function towards newly  recruited  employees  (to whom it conveys
the message  that they  are appreciated and chosen speci® cally to join this organisation,
which  helps  create  high  performance  expectations)  (Pfeffer,  1994). Huselid  (1995)
measures  this  by  asking  for  the  proportion of  the  workforce  that  receives  an
employment  test  prior  to hiring.  We  asked  HR  managers  to  indicate  on  a  ® ve-point
scale (1 = `Never ’ to 5 = `Always’)  whether  a list of ® ve types of selection  procedures
(standard  forms,  interviews,  psychometric  tests,  assessment  centres  and  specialised
search  ® rms)  were  used  in  the  selection  of  each  of  the  three  groups  of  personnel.  A
principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed  on  all these  items
(see Table 2) and yielded two factors. The ® rst factor explains 22.93 per cent of variance
and the second 19.04 per cent (eigenvalues 3.4 and 2.9 respectively). The ® rst factor was
labelled  `Strict  selection’  and  combined  the  use  of  tests  and  assessment  for  all  three
groups, as well as search ® rms for managers and specialists (Cronbach’s alpha was .80;
mean was 2.49). The  second factor describes  the use of standard forms for each of the
groups,  and  was left  out of further  analyses  as this  was not  considered  part of a high
performance  work  systems  approach. Interviews  and  the  use  of  search  firms  for
employees did not load clearly on either factor. 

Four  items  were  included that  were  linked  to  different aspects  of  employee
development and internal  career opportunities. Keeping  skills up-to-date and learning
new  things  is  needed  to ensure  quality  and  improvement  of  performance,  and
providing  employees  with  promotion  opportunities  can  be  highly  motivating.  In line
with Huselid (1995), we asked how many days a year each of the three groups received
training  (means  were  5.02, 6.61 and  6.00 for employees,  specialists  and  managers
respectively).  Cronbach’s  alpha for the scale combining  these  three  items  was .81. HR
managers were also asked to indicate to what extent employees were required to keep
their knowledge  and skills  up to date (from 1 = hardly at all to 5 = very strongly).  The
mean for employees was 3.23, for specialists 3.8 and 3.7 for managers. Cronbach’s alpha
for the  scale combining these  three  items  was  .80. We  also asked  whether  firms
employed  a system  of management  development;  105 ® rms  indicated  that their  ® rms

had  such  a  system  while  69 did  not.  Finally, HR  managers  rated  the  possibilities  for
internal  promotion  for  each  of these  three  groups  (`How  would  you  rate  the
possibilities  for  promotion  within  this  organisation  for the  following  groups  of
employees...?’ on a ® ve-point scale from 1 = `Very poor’ to 5 = `Excellent’). This item is
similar to items measuring internal career opportunities developed by Delery and Doty
(1996). Means were 2.77 for employees,  2.91 for specialists and 2.79 for managers, and
Cronbach’s alpha was .73.

Two items  focused on  rewards  (pay-for-performance  and  pro® t sharing).  Delaney
and Huselid  (1996) and others suggest  that these  practices motivate high  performance.
As stated, the Dutch collective bargaining  system  restricts  differentiation  in rewards  in
terms of salary and performance-based pay. However, limited pay-for-performance and
pro® t-sharing schemes are often present. The ® rst item asked (for all three groups) what
the  individual  level  reward  consisted  of (1 =  base salary, 2  =  base salary  plus  general
bonuses, 3 = base salary plus performance-related bonuses, 4 = base salary plus general
and  performance-related  bonuses).  For  employees  the  mean  was 1.53; 119 ® rms  had
base salary only, 20 a general  bonus but no  performance-related  element  and 28 had  a
performance-related  component  in  their  pay.  For  specialists,  the  mean  was  1.74; 105
® rms  had base pay only, 18 a general  bonus and 45 a performance related-component.
For managers,  the  mean was 2.16; 77 ® rms  had a base salary only, 21 a general  bonus
and  70 a performance-related  component.  Thus,  performance-based  pay  was found
mostly for managers. Cronbach’s alpha for the scale combining these was .84. 

The  second  aspect  of  compensation  we  measured  was whether  organisations
employed  a  formal  system  of  pro® t  sharing  for  each of  the  three  groups.  Fifty-four
® rms  had  such  a  scheme  for employees,  58 for specialists  and  61 for  managers.  The
Cronbach’s alpha was .98 for the combination of these three items.  

Several  authors  propose  that performance  evaluation should  form  the  basis  for
compensation and promotions and is, as such, important in attaining high  performance
(eg Fletcher, 2001; Huselid, 1995). We measured two elements, namely the frequency with
which individual level performance is measured and whether team performance plays a
role  in  performance  evaluation.  The  frequency of individual  level  performance
evaluation was reported on a ® ve-point scale (1 = once a year or less to 5= continuously)
for each of the three  groups. For employees,  the majority of ® rms assessed  performance

High performance work systems, organisational culture and rm effectiveness

only once a year or less  (N = 127). However, for specialists and managers, performance
was assessed more often, with a mean of 3.29 for specialists and 3.25 for managers. Scale
analyses  shows  that  the  corrected  item  total  correlation  for employees  was rather  low
(.28). This item was removed from the scale, which increased Cronbach’s alpha from .69
to .91. Thus,  the  ® nal  scale for frequency  of performance  measurement  consisted  of the
rating  for managers  and  specialists  only. Respondents  were  also  asked  whether  or  not
team performance played a role in performance evaluation for each of the three groups,
which  in  most  cases it  did  (varying  from  113 for managers  to 138 for specialists).
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.71.  

Participation  and  communication  are  often  stressed  as part  of  high  performance
work  systems  (eg Batt,  2002). Participation and  information  sharing  are  proposed  to
affect discretionary  effort through  their  in¯ uence  over  employee  skills  and  motivation
and through organisational structures that provide employees with the ability to control
how their roles are performed (Huselid, 1995). As stated, Dutch labour law implies that
a  formal  system  of  employee  participation  is  mandatory  (for organisations  with  more
than  50 employees).  Other  participation and  information  sharing  practices vary.  We
measured  the  extent  to which  organisations  have  formalised  information  sharing
meetings  (werk overleg)  at  the  department  or  organisational  level.  In  such  meetings
managers  present  work-related  issues,  policies  and  procedures  and  get  employees’
feedback. We  asked  how  often  such  meetings  were  held  (1 =  every  week,  2 = every
month, 3 = a few  times  a year  or  less).  The  mean was 2.53. A total of 30 organisations
had such meetings  weekly, 77 monthly, and the remaining  organisations  a few times  a
year  or  less. Employee  participation is  often operationalised  as employee  discretion  in
decision-making  or  employee  autonomy (eg Delery  and  Doty,  1996). In our study  HR
managers  rated employee  autonomy (`To what extent do employees  have discretion  in
determining  how they perform their tasks?’) on a ® ve-point scale (1 = `Not at all’ to 5 =
`Always’);  mean  was  3.2. Delery  and  Doty  (1996) used  similar  items  to  tap  employee
participation (eg `Employees in this job are allowed to make many decisions’). 

Some authors  also  propose an impact  of  task  analys es  and  job design  on
performance  (eg Delaney  and  Huselid,  1996). Here,  HR  managers  were  asked  to
indicate  whether  the  organisation  used  thorough  task  analyses  and  evaluations  with
the aim to improve productivity; 105 indicated that they did so. 

Finally,  two  items  were  used  to tap  the  extent  to  which  organisations  had  an
overarching  philosophy. Pfeffer  (1994) suggests  that  this  is  important  for aligning
employee  efforts.  Vandenberg  et  al (1999) note  that mechanisms  must  be  in  place  to
communicate  the  organisation’s  goals  or  intended  direction  to employees.  Vision  or
mission  statements  have  been  linked  to performance  (eg Baetz  and  Bart,  1996; Sidhu,
2003; Larwood et  al, 1995). A sense  of  mission  can  be highly  involving  for employees
and  increase  motivation  to work  towards  the  common  goal  (eg Klemm et al,  1991).
Having  such  an  overarching  philosophy may  also help  align  the  different  HRM
practices. Two items were used here to tap this. The ® rst was whether the organisation
had  a mission  statement  (89 ® rms  indicated  that they  had  one,  while  84 did  not) and
the  second  asked  whether  the  organisation  had  a  written  HRM  strategy  (66 firms
indicated they did have such a strategy; 107 did not).

High performance work system To assess whether the separate practices we measured can
be seen as coherent high performance work systems, we followed the approach used by
Husel id  (1995)  and  performed  a  princ ipal  component   analysi s  on  the  14
aforementioned items and scales. The scree plot suggests a two-factor solution. The ® rst
factor explains  17.65 per  cent  of  the  variance,  the  second  11.73 per  cent  (eigenvalues

64

were  2.5 and  1.6 respectively).  Table  3 presents  the  loadings  of the  items  on  these
factors.  Only  the  item s  in  the  first  factor  formed  a  relatively  consistent  and
interpretable  scale.  This  factor combined  seven  items/scales  related  to  employee
development and promotion, strict selection and the overarching philosophy. The item
asking for days of training had a very low corrected item-total correlation (.17) and was
removed  from  the  scale. The  remaining  six-item  scale had  a  Cronbach’s  alpha  of .62,
which is somewhat low but deemed acceptable. We labelled this scale `Employee skills
and  direc tion’ . The  second  factor  did  not  yield  an  intern ally  consist ent  and
interpretable  scale. Thus,  the  seven  items  that  were  in  the  second  factor were  used
separately in further analyses.

Table 4 presents  the intercorrelations  between the high  performance work practices
measures. These correlations are relatively low. Employee skills and direction correlates
signi® cantly positively with the two items on compensation (pay-for-performance and
pro® t  sharing).  Pay-for-performance  and  pro® t sharing  also  correlate  positively.  The
frequency  of  individual  level  performance  evaluation (for managers/specialists)
correlates positively with the use of team performance in evaluation and the frequency
of information sharing  meetings.  Finally, autonomy correlates negatively  with the use
of job evaluation and task analyses.

High performance work systems, organisational culture and rm effectiveness

Outcomes The  questionnaire  filled  out  by  the  HR  managers  also  tapped several
outcomes (beyond contract and performance as well as turnover and absenteeism). HR
managers  rated  whether  the  three  groups  tended  to  go beyond  contract  (`Do
employees/specialists/managers do more than is typically required in their contract or
job  description?’ )  on  a  five-point  scale,  from  1  =  `No’  to  5  =  `To  a high  degree’ .
Cronbach’s alpha was .73. The scale was labelled `Beyond contract’. HR managers also
answered two general performance items. These were `How would you rate the overall
quality and performance of your employees in relation to your competitors?’ (1 = `Low’
to 5 = `Very high’) and `How would you rate the overall performance of your company
in  relation  to  other  signi® cant  companies  in  your  market?’ (1  =  `Much worse’  to  5  =
`Much better’ ).  These  two  performance  items  are  similar  to  the  types  of  items  to
measure  perceived  organisational  performance  used  by  Delaney  and  Huselid  (1996),
and were combined with the ® rm performance ratings provided by the chief executives
(see below for principal components and scale analyses). 

HR  managers  were  also  asked  to  provide  the  percentages  of absenteeism  and
turnover  for each of the  three  groups.  Other  studies  have  also assessed  turnover  and
absenteeism in relation to practices (eg Dyer and Reeves, 1995; Guest and Peccei, 1994).
We  calculated Cronbach’s  alpha and  the  corrected item-total correlations  for the  three
turnover items. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.63 and corrected item-total correlation for core
employees (.35) was much lower than for the other two items (.61 and .54 respectively).
Cronbach’s  alpha increased  to 0.85 by removing  the  item  referring  to employees  from
the  scale. Thus,  we  combined  managers  and  specialists  and  kept  employees  separate.
This results in two turnover measures, one referring to employees and the other to both
managers  and  specialists. The  same holds  for absenteeism.  Cronbach’s alpha was 0.66
and  increased  to 0.91 when  the  item  referring  to employees  was  removed.  Thus,  two
absenteeism  measures  are  used.  The  first  refers  to  employees  and  the  other  to
managers/specialists. 

Chief executives

Culture Chief  executives  were  asked  to  fill  out the  descriptive  part of  the  FOCUS
questionnaire  designed  to  measure  indications  of  organisational  culture (see,  for
example,  Van Muijen  et  al,  1999). The  questionnaire  instructed  respondents  to  rate  25
items on a six-point scale (from `Never’ to `Always’). A sample item was given for each
of the four orientations: 

Support: `Employees with personal problems are helped here’
Innovative: `This organisation continually searches for new markets for
products/services’
Rules: `In our organisation all instructions are written down’
Goal: `In this organisation people have clear goals for their work’
Cronbach’s alpha was .87 for the support, .89 for the innovative, .73 for the rules and
.88 for the goal orientation  scale. The  correlations  between the culture orientations  are
presented  in  Table 6.  Some are  rather  high,  yet  similar  to those  found  in  previous
research (eg Den Hartog et al, 1996; Van Muijen et al, 1999).

Outcomes Chief executives  ®
lled  out six  items  on performance, rating  the organisation
compared  with  main  competitors  in  terms  of  profitability,  market  share,  projected
future investments and competitive position. 

Sample items  were:  `Within  your  market  and  sector,  how  would  you  rate  you
organisation  on  market  share  (rated  on  a ® ve-point  scale from  1 = `Declining’  to  5  =
`Rapid  expansion’);  pro® tability  (rated  on  a  ® ve-point  scale  from  1  =  `Losses’  to  5 =

`High pro® ts’); competitiveness (rated on a ® ve-point scale from 1 = `Very weak’ to 5 =
`Very  strong’ )’. A principal  component  analysis  of the  eight  performance  items  (six
rated by the chief executive and two by the HR manager) yielded two factors (see Table
5). The  first  explains  34.88 per  cent  of  the  variance  and  the  second  16.19 per  cent
(eigenvalues  2.8 and  1.3 respectively).  The  first  combined  five  items  on  general
performance (three answered by the chief executive and two by the HR manager) and
was labelled `Perceived ® rm performance’. Cronbach’s alpha for this measure was .71.
This  measure  is  similar  to  Delaney  and  Huselid’ s  (1996)  measure  of perceived
organisational  performance.  The  second  factor (three  items,  all  answered  by  the  chief
executive)  combined  ratings  of the  organisation’ s  marketing,  investments  and
pro® tability  compared  with  other  organisations  in  the  same  sector  and  was  labelled
perceived economic outcomes. This measure is similar to Delaney  and Huselid’s (1996)
measure  of perceived  market  performance. For  perceived  economic outcomes,
Cronbach’s  alpha  was  somewhat  low  (.54). Thus,  interpretation  of the  results  for  this
measure should be done with some care. 

Table 6 also presents the correlations among the outcome measures and culture. The
correlations among the different performance and outcome measures are relatively low
and  they  seem  to  relate  to different  aspects  of  the  performance  of organisations.  The
culture orientations  are  not  correlated  with  turnover.  However,  the  innovative,  goal
and  support  orientations  are  negatively  related  to absenteeism  in  the  manager/
specialist  groups  and  innovation  is  also  related  to employee  absenteeism. These
innovative,  support and  goal  culture  orientations  are  positively  related  to perceived
® rm performance,  going  beyond  contract and economic  outcome. However, the  rules
orientation is not related to these measures. 

RESULTS

Table  7 presents  the  correlations  of  high  performance  work  systems  and  practices
measures  with culture and outcome measures. Employee skill and direction correlates
positively  and  signi® cantly  with  going  beyond  contract and  economic  outcome.  The
correlation with perceived ® rm performance is not signi® cant. This remarkable pattern
is  simila r  to  the  findings  in  Delaney  and  Huselid’ s  (1996)  study, where  more
relationships  were  found  between  HRM  and  perceived  market  performance  than
between  HRM  and  perceived  organisational  performance. Also,  the  correlations  of
employee  skills  and  direction  with  both  absenteeism  measures  are  significantly
negative.  Those  with  turnover  are  not. Absenteeism  (for  managers/specialists)  also

correlates  significantly  negatively  with  pay-for-performance.  Pay-for-performance
correlates  positively  with  perceived  economic  outcome,  as  does  pro® t sharing.  The
frequency  of performance  evaluation  for  managers/specialists  correlates  negatively
with  turnover  for  that  group.  Turnover  for  employees  correlates  negatively  with
information  sharing  meetings.  Finally, autonomy  correlates  positively  with  going
beyond contract. 

Table  7  also reports  the  correlations  between  high  performance  work  practices
measures  (as provided  by HR  directors)  and  the culture orientations  (as answered  by
chief  executives). The  scale for employee  skill  and  direction  correlates  positively  with
three out of four culture measures (especially innovative and goal); only the correlation
with  the  rules  orientation  is  not  significant. Interestingly, the  innovative  culture
orientation correlates positively with ® ve out of eight high performance work practices
measures (employee skills and direction, pay-for-performance, pro® t sharing, frequent
performance  evaluations  and  use  of  job evaluation and  task  analysis),  and  the  goal
orientation  with  four (employee  skills  and  direction,  pay-for-performance,  profit
sharing and use of teams). The support orientation only correlates with employee skills
and  direction.  The  rules orientation  does not correlate  positively  with any  of the high
performance  work  practices measures.  However,  a signi® cantly  negative  correlation
with employee autonomy is found. 

Hierarchical  regression  analyses  were  done  to assess  whether  employee  skills  and
direction as well as the remaining  practices explain variance in the outcome and culture
measures. As  we  used  a diverse  sample  of  organisations  from  different  sectors,  we
controlled  for sector, ® rm  size and  ® rm  age. The  control  variables  were  entered  in  the
® rst  step,  employee  skills  and  direction  in  the  second  step  and  the  remaining  high
performance  work  practices measures  in  the  third  step.  Significantly, variance  is
explained  in perceived  economic outcomes as well as going  beyond contract (see Table
8), but not in perceived ® rm performance or turnover. For these latter measures, none of
the three steps of the hierarchical regression  analysis were signi® cant (and are therefore

not  reported  in  the  table). Regarding  the  two  absenteeism  variables, HRM  practices
signi® cantly  predict  variance  in  the  absenteeism  measure  for the  combined  group  of
managers  and  specialists,  but  not  for  employees.  For  the  latter,  only  the  ® rst  step  is
signi® cant, and  6  per  cent  of the  variance  is  explained,  with  sector  as the  signi® cant
predictor. The second step approaches signi® cance (total adjusted R2 .075 and p-value of
the change in R2 is .08). In this step sector and employee skills and direction are the most
relevant  predictors  (the  latter  again  a  negative  predictor  as  expected,  p-value .08).
However,  as these  values  are  not  signi® cant at the  .05 level,  they  are  not  reported  in
Table 8. 

Table  8  prese nts  the  results  for  economic  outcomes,  beyon d  contract  and
absenteeism (manager/specialist). It shows the standardised  beta weights, adjusted R2
and their  F-values, as well as the  F-value for the  change  in  unadjusted  R2 for each of
the  steps.  HRM  and  control  variables  explain  a  total  of 7.7 per  cent  of  (adjusted)
variance  in  economic  outcomes,  10  per  cent  in  beyond  contract  and  7  per  cent  in
absenteeism  for managers/specialists.  For  all three,  the  second  step,  in  which
employee  skills  and  direction  is  added,  is  most  relevant  (the  change  in  explained
variance is signi® cant here but not in the ® rst and third step). Thus, these results show
that the combination of high  performance work practices we labelled employee skills
and direction helps predict economic outcomes, beyond contract and absenteeism (for
managers/specialists).

We  also assessed  whether  high  performance  work  practices explain variance in  the
culture  orientations.  For  each  of  the  four  dependent  variables  we  performed
hierarchical  regression  analyses.  The  control  variables  (sector, size  and  age)  were
entered  in  the  first  step,  employee  skills  and  direction  in  the  second  step  and  the
remaining  practice  measures  in  the  third  step.  As  can  be  seen  in  Table  9,  explained
variance ranges from a low of 3.5 per cent for the support and 11 per cent for the rules
orientation  to  a  high  of  21 per  cent  for  the  innovative  and  25  per  cent  for  the  goal
orientation. In three out of four cases, sector is a signi® cant predictor (innovative, rules
and goal) and, for three out of four (support, innovative and goal), employee skills and
direction adds signi® cantly to the prediction. Signi® cant predictors in the third step are
autonomy  (negative)  for  the  rules  orientation,  pay-for-performance (positive)  for  the
goal orientation  and  the  extensive  use of job evaluation and  task analyses  to improve
productivity (positive) for the innovative orientation.

DISCUSSION

Recent  overviews  describe  various  theoretical  and  methodological  challenges  that
researchers interested in the relationship between high performance work practices and
® rm  performance  face. These  include  the  number,  content  and  operationalisation  of
HRM  practices, the  relationships  between  them,  how  to address  within  ® rm  variance
on practices, the nature of the relationship with strategy (and how to measure strategy),
which  performance  indicators  are  relevant,  how  to maintain  ® rm  ¯ exibility,  levels  of
analysis and aggregation issues, and the low reliability of single raters (eg Gerhart, 1999;
Gerhart et al, 2000b; Guest, 2001; Wright and Boswell, 2002; Wright and Sherman, 1999;
Wright  and Snell, 1998). Also, the strategic HRM ® eld needs  to better understand  how
and  when  practices  may  enhance  or  complement  each  other  (eg Delery, 1998; Wright
and McMahan, 1992). 

The  current  study  aimed  to provide  further  evidence  regarding  the  proposed  link
between high performance work systems and several aspects of performance. A multi-
source survey study  was carried  out, in  which  senior  HR  managers  provided

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, VOL 14 NO 1, 2004


Deanne N. Den Hartog and Robert M. Verburg 

information  on  the  practices,  chief  executives  completed  a  questionnaire  tapping
organisational  culture  and  both  provided  some  of  the  outcome measures.  One  of the
questions  addressed  here  was  whether  an  alignment  of  practices  would  be found.
Results  show  that  a  combination  of practices existed  involving  strict  selection,  an
emphasis  on  employee  development  and  interna l  promotions,  and  having  an
overarching  philosophy  in  terms  of a mission  statement  and  HR  strategy.  This  set  of
high  performance  work  practices was labelled  `Employee  skill  and  direction’.  Several
other high performance work practices, such as autonomy, pay-for-performance, pro® t
sharing and information sharing did not cluster and were considered separately. 

As  expected,  we  found  positive  relationships  between  the  set  of practices  labelled
`Employee  skill  and direction’  and employees’  willingness  to go beyond contract, and
negative relationships with the two measures of absenteeism. Autonomy also showed a
positive  relationship  with  willingness  to go  beyond  contract.  Turnover  was  not
strongly  related to the high  performance work practices; only performance evaluation
and information sharing showed the expected negative correlations with turnover. 

High  performance  work  systems  and  practices were  also hypothesised  to affect
perceptual ® rm  performance  measures  in  our study. Although  the  use  of perceptual
measures allowed us to assess the ® rm-level impact of high performance work practices
in ® rms for which ® nancial measures of performance are generally  unavailable (eg non-
pro® t ® rms),  ® nancial measures  of  ® rm  performance  are  more  desirable.  Perceptual
measures  are  regularly  used  in  research,  and  our results  for  the  perceived  economic
outcomes measure are consistent with studies that used objective performance measures
(eg Huselid, 1995). Employee skill and direction, as well as several of the other practices,
were positively related to this perceived economic performance measure. However, this
does not hold for the measure of perceived ® rm performance that we used. Delaney and
Huselid  (1996) present  similar  results,  showing  stronger  relationships  for perceived
market than for perceived organisational performance. Perhaps reversed causality plays
a role, in that ® rms performing better in economic terms (ie with better pro® tability and
a better investment position) may have more resources to devote to HRM. However, this
is  merely  a suggestion  and  research  is  needed  to  clarify  the  differences  between  more
general  perceived  performance  measures  and  more  focused  measures  assessing  more
speci® c perceptions  regarding  ® nancial or market-related  performance in their  relation
to high performance work practices.

As  stated,  we  assessed  the  use  of practices  for  three  different  groups  (managers,
employees and specialists). In most cases the items focusing on different groups can be
combined  to form  an  internally  consistent  scale. However,  firms  did  differentiate
between  these  groups.  Means  differed  and,  in  a few  cases, the  items  referring  to  the
different  groups  were  not  part of a single  scale (eg items  for frequency  performance
measurement  and  the  use  of specialised  ® rms  in  selection  cluster  for  managers  and
specialists/professionals, but not for employees). Thus, assuming that organisations use
only a single set of practices may sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions (depending
on  the  practice one  is  interested  in).  Other  groups  (such  as  core  versus  temporary
employees)  could also  be of interest  here.  Future  models  and  studies  should  more
carefully  delineate  which  groups  of people  they  are  describing.  Research  on
psychological  contracts and  person-environment  ® t  suggest  that  different  groups  of
people  may  value certain  HRM  practices to a greater  or  lesser  extent  (eg Kristof, 1996;
Rousseau, 1990). Thus, the effect of creating `® t’ by aligning HR practices with the needs
of different groups within the organisation seems a relevant area for future research.

We  also  assessed  the  relationship  between  high  performance  work  practices  and
organisational  culture. As  different  informants  (HR  director  and  chief  executive)

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, VOL 14 NO 1, 2004

High performance work systems, organisational culture and rm effectiveness

provided  the practices and culture ratings, these results do not suffer from same-source
bias. The  rules  orientation  is  least  often  correlated with  high  performance  work
practices. A negative  correlation  is  found  between the  rules orientation  and  autonomy;
more emphasis on rules and procedures implies less discretion for employees.  The goal
and innovative orientation (and to a lesser extent the support orientation) are positively
related to several of the high performance work practices and especially to the combined
set  of employee  skills  and  direction  practices. Although  the  high  correlations  between
some  of the  orientations  imply  that differentiating  between  them  is  problematic, some
differences  are  found.  Besides  employee  skills  and  direction,  the  goal  orientation  is
explained by pay-for-performance and the innovative orientation by the extensive use of
job  evaluation and  task  analyses  to  improve  productivity.  However, future research
could use different culture measures and include additional dimensions. 

In this study the chief executive (or another member  of the top management  team)
was  the  informant  regarding  culture. Thus  the  study  provides  information  on  the
dominant  values  at the  top  of the  organisation.  An  interesting  question  for future
research  is also whether  the  view of the  chief executive regarding  culture is similar  to
that  of  employees.  If views  within  the  organisation  on  culture are  highly  similar, one
could  speak  of a  homogeneous  or  strong  culture,  if  not  of  a weak  culture. A strong
culture would imply more shared norms and values and a shared view on `how we do
things  around  here’ .  It  would  be interesting  to test  whether  high  performance  work
systems  tend  to  result  in  stronger  cultures. It  would  also be interesting  to assess  the
possible  moderating  role  culture may  have  in  the  relationship  between  HRM  policies
and outcomes. Some HRM practices may have more prominent effects on employees in
one type of organisational culture than in the other. 

A number of cautions are in order. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, the
direction of the effects could not be tested. As stated, reverse  causality may play a role.
Firms  with better ® nancial outcomes may have more money  to spend  on HRM. Thus,
better  economic  performance  may  lead  to  more  use  of  high  performance  work
practices. Future  research  could assess  such  associations  in  a  longitudinal  manner.
Another aforementioned concern is that ® rm performance measures were perceptual in
nature. As  the  organisations  were  from  many  very  different  sectors  (including  non-
pro® t)  this  was hard  to avoid  (see also  Guest, 2001). We  therefore  also included  other
outcome measures,  such  as absenteeism,  turnover  and  the extent to which  employees
go  beyond  contract. Also,  to  minimise  same-source  bias,  two informants  per
organisation  (the  most  senior  HR  manager  and  the  chief  executive) participated.  Our
sample was diverse  and came from different  sectors. Future  work  could tailor models
of high  performance  work  systems  or  practices more  speci® cally  to the  context. For
example, Boxall (2003) notes that many models  originate  in the manufacturing context
and presents a set of propositions regarding HR strategy in services.

CONCLUSION

This study assessed the high performance work practices/outcomes link in a sample of
175 Dutch ® rms. An extensive (yet not exhaustive) set of practices mentioned in the high
performance  work  systems  literature  was  included  in  the  study.  We  found  a
combination of practices involving  rigorous selection, extensive employee development
and  an  overarching  philosophy.  Several  other  high  performance  work  practices we
measured,  such  as autonomy, pay-for-performance,  profit  sharing  and  information
sharing,  did  not  cluster  and  were  analysed  separately.  The  set  of  practices  labelled
`Employee skill  and direction’ and several of the other practices were  positively related

to workers’  willingness  to go beyond contract and perceived  economic performance of
the  ® rm  and  negatively  to absenteeism.  Also, relationships  with organisational  culture
dimensions  were  found.  Thus,  our  results  suggest  that  the  highly  institutionalised
Dutch context left  suf® cient  room  for ® rms  to distinguish  themselves  in  terms  of high
performance work practices.

The high performance work systems literature tends to focus rather narrowly on the
relationship between such systems and hard indicators of ® rm performance. Boxall and
Purcell (2003) present a much broader view of HRM and its goals and outcomes that can
help to shape future studies in this area. They argue that HRM can have different goals
and is concerned with three aspects of performance that contribute to the organisation’s
viability, namely  its  productivity, ¯ exibility  and  legitimacy. Strategic tension  may arise
where  goals are  incompatible (eg in striving  for long-term  agility as well as short-term
responsiveness  where  ¯ exibility  is  concerned).  In  their  analysis  of the  productivity
aspect of performance, Boxall and Purcell (2003) call attention to the importance of cost-
effectiveness.  The  high  performance  work  system  found  in  this  study  incorporates
rigorous  selection  and  extensive  internal  development  and  thus  re¯ ects  a  relatively
expensive,  high-skill  model  of labour management.  When  does  investing  in  such
expensive HR practices make sense in terms of cost effectiveness? Such questions can be
considered in future studies taking the multiple goals of HRM into account.

Also,  as  Godard  (2001) points  out, what  many  view  as best  practice  for employers
may  not  also  be  best  practice  for  workers.  This  is  related  to  the  aforementioned
legitimacy goal. Firms operate within societies and are bound by their social norms and
legislation,  which  is  clearly  important  in  the  institutionalised  Dutch  context of this
study. Elements of social legitimacy also include the ® rm’s reputation as an employer, its
impact on the natural environment,  ethics  and social responsibility. Like  many studies
on high performance work systems, our study focuses more on managers’ perspectives
and  perceptions  than  on  employee  outcomes and  voices.  Ideally, future work  assesses
both hard  ® rm  performance  and  worker  outcomes (see, for example, Appelbaum et al,
2000). As Boxall and Purcell (2003: 19-20) point out: `Studies of high performance work
systems  should  include  data on  costs and  bene® ts  for both  companies  and  workers
because worker  motivation  and  broader  legitimacy  are  unlikely  to  improve  if  only
management gains.’
