This study considers how turnover in self-managing work teams influences the team interaction 
processes that promote effective task accomplishment. Drawing from research on self-managing 
work teams and group process, the authors propose that team turnover affects performance in 
self-managing teams by affecting social integration, team learning behavior, and task flexibility. 
Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 47 self-managing work teams using longitudinal panel 
data and an objective measure of team performance. Results suggest that team turnover indeed 
decreases  social  integration,  team  learning  behavior,  and  task  flexibility  in  self-managing 
teams but that only task flexibility and team learning behavior mediate the negative relationship 
between team turnover and team effectiveness.

and Ledford (1995) found that the use of self-managing work teams increased substantially 
between 1987 and 1993 with as many as 68% of firms reporting self-managing team use in 
1993 compared with only 27% in 1987. A broader study of team use in a sample of 12000 
firms with 100 or more employees found that 35% reported using self-managing work teams 
in  1992  (see  Devine,  Clayton,  Philips,  Dunford,  &  Melner,  1999).  And  Reynolds  (2006) 
concluded that the use of self-managing teams has remained fairly constant or even increased 
in recent years. Moreover, the use of self-managing work teams has been found to result in 
a number of important benefits, including increased worker satisfaction and engagement in 
team  tasks  (Cordery,  Mueller,  &  Smith,  1991;  Kirkman  &  Shapiro,  2001;  Wall,  Kemp, 
Jackson,  &  Clegg,  1986)  and  higher  productivity  and  quality  (Cohen  &  Ledford,  1994; 
Goodman, Devadas, & Hughson, 1988).

The defining characteristic of a self-managing work team (also referred to as an autono-
mous or semiautonomous team) is that the team as a collective, rather than some external 
manager, has the authority to determine how member efforts will be organized, monitored, 
and  managed  to  accomplish  the  team’s  work  (Hackman,  1995,  pp.  511-512;  Kirkman  & 
Shapiro, 2001). In comparison with traditional groups, self-managing work teams therefore 
depend more heavily on invested members who engage in bottom-up processes of coordina-
tion  and  self-organization  (Cohen,  Ledford,  &  Spreitzer,  1996;  Druskat  &  Pescosolido, 
2002).  Consequently,  creating  an  environment  where  these  processes  can  take  place  is  a 
critical requirement for self-managing work team effectiveness.

A key factor that may influence such an environment within a self-managing work team 
is the magnitude of turnover within the team. In today’s volatile economy, job changes are 
simply a fact of organizational life. In the United States, for example, more than 25% of all 
workers have been with their company less than 1 year and 33% of workers have been with 
their company less than 2 years (Rollag, Parise, & Cross, 2005). Moreover, internal restructur-
ing initiatives, promotions and transfers, and temporary task force assignments all contribute 
to  a  constant  state  of  membership  flux  in  many  if  not  most  contemporary  organizations 
(Arrow & McGrath, 1995; Dalton, 1997). As a result, many self-managing work teams must 
strive to foster collaborative, bottom-up interaction processes in an environment of frequent 
turnover—a difficult challenge given the documented disruptive effect of turnover in work 
teams (Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, & Lockhart, 2005).

This fact raises an important question: How does turnover in self-managing work teams 
influence the team interaction processes that are essential for effectiveness? Past research 
provides little guidance on how to answer this question. Although we know that team turn-
over in general can compromise group efficiency and productivity (Argote, Insko, Yovetich, 
& Romero, 1995; Goodman & Leyden, 1991; Kacmar, Andrews, van Rooy, Steilberg, & 
Cerrone, 2006), we know very little about the specific group processes that might mediate 
these effects (Dineen & Noe, 2003: 7; Kacmar et al., 2006: 134). Our ability to understand 
and predict the group process and consequent group performance effects of team turnover in 
teams generally, let alone self-managing work teams, is therefore quite limited.

The  study  described  here  was  designed  to  provide  insight  into  this  question.  Drawing 
from past work on team self-management and team turnover, we propose that team turnover 
will disrupt key interaction processes in self-managing work teams. Moreover, we argue that 
these process disruptions will compromise team effectiveness by affecting a team’s capacity

to self-regulate and self-coordinate. In terms of a specific model, we will suggest that the 
relationship between turnover and effectiveness in self-managing work teams will be medi-
ated by three interaction processes deemed critical to the effectiveness of self-managing work 
teams in past research, namely, social integration, team learning behavior, and task flexibil-
ity. We test this mediated model in a sample of self-managing work teams from a Volvo 
truck manufacturing plant in Sweden, using longitudinal panel data and an objective mea-
sure of team effectiveness.

In pursuing this research agenda, the present article makes two key contributions. First, we 
provide  deeper  insight  into  the  specific  processes  that  mediate  the  oft-studied  relationship 
between team turnover and team performance. Few studies have empirically examined these 
mediating processes. In a review of the literature on turnover in teams, for example, Dineen and 
Noe (2003: 7) argued that researchers should “look more closely at process issues and emergent 
states instead of focusing directly on performance outcomes.” Doing so should enable more 
accurate prediction and suggest ways to mitigate the negative consequences of team turnover. 
Second,  this  article  extends  our  understanding  of  self-managing  work  teams  by  empirically 
examining key theoretical predictions about performance-enhancing processes and by explicitly 
examining the significance of team turnover for both team processes and performance.

Theory and Hypotheses

Team Turnover and Team Processes

In  an  attempt  to  explicate  the  functioning  and  effectiveness  of  small  groups,  many 
researchers have turned to some version of a basic input–process–output (I-P-O) model (e.g., 
Hackman, 1987; McGrath, 1984; Steiner, 1972). In this model, group processes (e.g., com-
munication, conflict) mediate the relationship between group inputs (e.g., composition, task, 
context)  and  group  outputs  (e.g.,  efficiency,  productivity,  innovation).  A  key  assumption 
underlying I-P-O models of group effectiveness is that although establishing input–output 
relationships is an important first step in any research program, an articulation and under-
standing of intervening mechanisms is critical if we are to truly understand, predict, and, 
ultimately,  manage  a  given  system  (Anderson  et  al.,  2006).  In  a  recent  review,  Ilgen, 
Hollenbeck, Johnson, and Jundt (2005) noted that the I-P-O model has proven tremendously 
influential  as  an  overarching  framework  for  understanding  and  researching  groups.  They 
also note that, in fact, researchers adopting the I-P-O model have looked at other mediators 
besides those that we would typically classify as group processes, most notably, emergent 
cognitive or affective states (e.g., team cohesiveness, team efficacy). It is therefore important 
to keep in mind that, although groups researchers may use the I-P-O terminology, the term 
process should be understood in the sense described by Van de Ven (1992, p. 169), that is, 
as “a logic that explains a causal relationship between independent and dependent variables.” 
We might also use the term social mechanisms (Hedström & Swedberg, 1998) to capture 
what groups researchers often mean by the term process.

Team turnover, which we define as a type of membership change that involves the depar-
ture and/or arrival of a formally designated member or members (see related discussion in

Arrow & McGrath, 1995; Levine & Choi, 2004), has occupied both an input role and an 
output role in past I-P-O models of group dynamics. Researchers who view team turnover as 
an output are interested in understanding how various input factors lead to interaction pro-
cesses or emergent states within a group which then affect patterns of member turnover. So, 
for example, O’Reilly, Caldwell, and Barnett (1989) looked at how the demographic com-
position of a group affected social integration which then affected member turnover (see also 
Sorensen, 2000; Wiersema & Bird, 1993). These studies recognize that team turnover may 
occur for reasons that are entirely unrelated to what may be going on in a group (e.g., down-
sizing, retirements). Nevertheless, they seek to understand that portion of variance in team 
turnover that may be due to the structure, composition, and/or functioning of the group itself.
In  contrast,  research  on  team  turnover  as  an  input  considers  how  turnover  in  groups 
affects  group  processes  or  emergent  states  in  groups  and  how  this  translates  into  perfor-
mance outcomes. Although recognizing that turnover may occur for reasons internal to the 
group, this approach positions turnover as an exogenous variable or as something which the 
group must accommodate regardless of why members may have left. This approach begins 
by  acknowledging  that  turnover  within  a  group  can  disrupt  routines,  change  norms,  alter 
composition, and introduce new ideas and ways of doing things, all of which have important 
implications for team effectiveness. Researchers adopting this version of the I-P-O model 
(including the present study) therefore seek to understand and document these effects.

Much of the empirical research examining team turnover as an input has focused on the 
relationship between turnover and various indicators of group performance such as produc-
tivity, efficiency, or knowledge transfer without explicitly examining intervening processes or 
emergent states (Argote et al., 1995; Arrow & McGrath, 1993; Goodman & Leyden, 1991; 
Kane, Argote, & Levine, 2005; Levine & Choi, 2004; Virany, Tushman, & Romanelli, 1992; 
Ziller, Behringer, & Goodchilds, 1962). There are, however, a few exceptions. O’Connor, 
Gruenfeld, and McGrath (1993) found that turnover affected members’ experience of con-
flict in laboratory groups but that conflict did not mediate a turnover-performance relation-
ship.  More  recently,  Kacmar  et  al.  (2006),  in  an  explicit  attempt  to  address  the  lack  of 
research examining process mediators of the team turnover-performance relationship, stud-
ied turnover in fast food restaurants and found that efficiency (customer wait time) mediated 
the relationship between crew turnover and restaurant profitability. Although this finding is 
important, efficiency is often viewed as an output variable rather than as a process variable 
(Marks, Mathieu, & Zaccaro, 2001), which leaves the question of intervening group pro-
cesses unaddressed.

Team Processes in Self-Managing Teams

In  this  study,  we  examine  key  processes/emergent  states  that  mediate  the  relationship 
between team turnover and performance in self-managing work teams. In a recent review of 
the literature on self-managing work teams, Druskat and Pescosolido (2002) concluded that 
theories attempting to identify success factors in self-managing work teams have tended to 
converge on three categories of team process: (a) psychological ownership, (b) continuous 
learning, and (c) heedful interrelating.

At the core of psychological ownership is “the feeling of . . . being psychologically tied 
to an object” (Pierce, Kostova, & Dirks, 2001). Processes of psychological ownership are 
exemplified by the construct of social integration, defined as “the degree to which an indi-
vidual  is  psychologically  linked  to  others  in  a  group”  (O’Reilly  et  al.,  1989:  22).  Social 
integration is a key indicator of the groupiness of a group (Moreland & McMinn, 2004). It 
is evidenced by “attraction to the group, satisfaction with other members of the group, and 
social interaction among the group members” (O’Reilly et al., 1989: 22). Social integration 
is critical to effectiveness in self-managing teams because self-management requires a high 
degree of member engagement and investment in the team and its goals and processes.

Processes of continuous learning are those processes that promote self-evaluation and self-
correction (Edmondson, 1999). Team learning processes are exemplified by the construct of 
“learning behavior,” defined as “an ongoing process of reflection and action characterized by 
asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors 
or  unexpected  outcomes  of  actions”  (Edmondson,  1999:  353;  see  also  Drach-Zahavy  & 
Somech, 2001; Van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005). Research has suggested that these activi-
ties can promote group effectiveness by facilitating adaptive and proactive responses to a 
group’s task environment (Edmondson, 1999; Gibson & Vermeulen, 2003; Van der Vegt & 
Bunderson, 2005). Such behaviors are critical in self-managing work teams in which learn-
ing is the responsibility of the team rather than higher level managers and staff members.

Finally, heedful interrelating includes processes related to “flexible coordination” (Pearce 
& Ravlin, 1987; see also Campion Medsker, & Higgs, 1993), that is, member interactions 
that  reflect  awareness  of  each  member’s  task  and  how  those  tasks  interrelate.  These  pro-
cesses are exemplified by the construct of “task flexibility,” defined as the extent to which 
team  members  can  and  do  substitute  for  one  another  in  the  performance  of  team  tasks 
(Campion, Papper, & Medsker, 1996). A team is more flexible when team members are able 
to easily and seamlessly transition from one subtask to another and less flexible when mem-
bers are not able to trade tasks. Although there are teams in which flexibility is an unrealistic 
or undesirable goal (e.g., teams composed of functional specialists or members with highly 
specialized  knowledge),  task  flexibility  can  be  a  worthwhile  goal  in  many  self-managing 
work teams where members have similar training and/or perform tasks that do not require 
extensive training or education. In such teams, flexibility can lead to more adaptive, enrich-
ing, collaborative, and higher quality work as members engage in task rotation, cross-training, 
and interpersonal helping.

In  sum,  effectiveness  in  self-managing  work  teams  requires  social  integration,  team 
learning behavior, and task flexibility. It follows that anything which affects these process 
variables in a self-managing work team should have a corresponding effect on team effec-
tiveness.  It  is  the  central  thesis  of  this  article  that  team  turnover  is  just  such  a  factor. 
Specifically, we will argue that turnover in a self-managing team will interrupt established 
routines (Zellmer-Bruhn, 2003) and thereby disrupt these critical interaction processes. And 
these process disruptions can compromise team effectiveness by decreasing a self-managing 
team’s capacity to coordinate and regulate individual member efforts toward team goals. In 
other words, we will argue that the relationship between team turnover and effectiveness in 
self-managing  work  teams  is  mediated  by  social  integration,  team  learning  behavior,  and 
task flexibility. We elaborate this basic proposition in the following sections.

Team Turnover and Social Integration

There is considerable research evidence to suggest that stability and continuity in inter-
personal relationships are an important prerequisite for the development of social integration 
within a group and that team turnover, by extension, can have a negative effect on social 
integration. Relationship stability within a group allows for member familiarity, which smooths 
coordination  and  encourages  positive,  team-building  behaviors  (Gruenfeld,  Mannix, 
Williams, & Neale, 1996; Rockett & Okhuysen, 2002). Stability and continuity in interper-
sonal relationships also foster the development of a group identity which minimizes intra-
group conflict and fosters team-oriented efforts (Brewer & Miller, 1984; Gaertner, Dovidio, 
& Bachman, 1996; O’Connor et al., 1993). And longevity in member relations facilitates 
trust among group members (Moreland & Levine, 2002).

Turnover  within  a  self-managing  work  team  complicates  all  of  these  integrating  proc-
esses. Assuming at least partial replacement, the departure of established members decreases 
familiarity (Goodman & Leyden, 1991), weakens feelings of a shared group identity, and 
introduces  uncertainty  in  the  place  of  patterns  of  increasing  trust  (Moreland  &  Levine, 
2002). As a result, we would expect that teams experiencing turnover will be less socially 
integrated than teams with stable membership. This prediction is consistent with research by 
O’Reilly et al. (1989) and Smith et al. (1994) in which it was found that heterogeneity in 
team tenure—suggesting a history of team turnover within a team—was negatively related 
to  group  social  integration.  These  arguments  lead  to  the  following  hypothesis  about  the 
relationship between team turnover and social integration within a team:

Hypothesis 1: Turnover is negatively associated with social integration within self-managing work 

teams.

Team Turnover and Team Learning Behavior

The nature of the relationship between team turnover and team learning behavior is not 
obvious and compelling arguments can be developed for both positive and negative relation-
ships. On one hand, turnover could promote team learning behavior within a self-managing 
work team by encouraging mindful reflection on the team’s functioning. Research by Katz 
(1982) suggests, for example, that teams develop routine patterns of working and interacting 
over time which decreases the felt need for communication and reflection. The departure of 
existing  members  should  disrupt  these  routines  and  encourage  team  members  to  actively 
consider their work processes (Zellmer-Bruhn, 2003). Team turnover may also spur intrateam 
learning by introducing new team members who bring with them new ideas and different 
work approaches from their previous work settings. When new members offer these ideas 
and  suggestions,  dialogue  and  reflection  about  the  best  way  to  perform  work  may  ensue, 
leading to the adoption of superior practices or the development of creative new syntheses. 
These arguments are consistent with research by Arrow and McGrath (1993) in which it was 
found that laboratory groups with an experimentally imposed new member and groups with 
member absences performed better on a task requiring reflection about the group’s internal

process. Also, research by Ziller et al. (1962) found that laboratory groups which either added 
or lost a member generated more new ideas than stable groups.

On the other hand, one of the more robust findings in research on team learning is that 
teams are more likely to engage in team learning behaviors when there is a climate of psy-
chological safety within the group, that is, when group members feel that the group is a safe 
place for interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999). And this environment of safety and 
trust is simply more likely to be found in groups where there is stability in group member-
ship such that members can come to know and trust one another (Moreland & Levine, 2002; 
O’Connor et al., 1993). When relationships are unstable or when members are unfamiliar 
with  one  another,  there  is  greater  uncertainty  associated  with  admitting  one’s  ignorance, 
discussing failures, or experimenting with a new idea because one does not know what to 
expect from others (Gruenfeld et al., 1996). This evaluation apprehension may stifle learning 
behaviors by leading to greater inhibition and self-censoring.

One possible explanation for these conflicting predictions about the relationship between 
team turnover and learning behavior is that the relationship is actually inverse U-shaped, that 
is, positive at lower levels of team turnover but negative at higher levels. Small amounts of 
team  turnover  (e.g.,  involving  one  member)  may  spur  learning  behavior  for  the  reasons 
outlined above without creating an uncertain or threatening environment for team members. 
In fact, the studies cited above in which team turnover was found to promote reflection and 
creativity were conducted using laboratory groups in which just one member was added to 
or  removed  from  a  group.  It  may  be  that  at  higher  levels  of  team  turnover,  however,  the 
uncertainty and discomfort associated with unfamiliar members will overwhelm the poten-
tial positive effects of team turnover, resulting in a negative relationship between team turno-
ver and performance. We therefore hypothesize the following:

Hypothesis  2:  The  relationship  between  team  turnover  and  team  learning  behavior  within  self-
managing work teams is inverse U-shaped; the relationship will be positive at small amounts of 
team turnover and will become negative at larger amounts of team turnover.

Team Turnover and Task Flexibility

Task flexibility is critical for successful self-management in teams because it allows for 
bottom-up  (as  opposed  to  top-down)  coordination  between  and  among  team  members  in 
response  to  potentially  shifting  task  demands.  We  expect  that  task  flexibility  will  suffer 
when team membership is unstable (see Dineen & Noe, 2003). Stability in team membership 
allows time for members of a self-managing team to observe other members as they perform 
unfamiliar tasks, to ask questions about the performance of those tasks, and to eventually 
assist or even fill in for other members in performing those tasks. The extent to which mem-
bers  of  a  given  group  will  be  motivated  to  engage  in  these  sorts  of  cross-task  learning 
activities  will,  of  course,  vary  across  teams.  But  given  a  sample  of  self-managing  work 
teams with the same task and incentive structures, we would expect to find that those teams 
with greater member stability will have greater task flexibility. Furthermore, even teams in 
which  members  begin  with  roughly  the  same  background  and  training  require  time  for

members to learn team-specific task and coordination routines before task rotation will be 
possible. Support for this expectation was found in Campion et al.’s (1996) study of 60 teams 
in a financial services organization in which they found a positive relationship between team 
permanence (i.e., membership stability) and task flexibility. It follows that higher levels of 
team turnover in self-managing teams should be negatively associated with task flexibility.

Hypothesis 3: Team turnover is negatively associated with task flexibility in self-managing work 

teams.

Process Mediators of the Team Turnover–Performance Relationship

The above hypotheses suggest that team turnover in self-managing work teams will result 
in lower levels of social integration, less flexibility in sharing tasks, and, at higher levels of 
team turnover, less engagement in learning behaviors. We next present arguments to suggest 
that these process consequences of team turnover will have important implications for team 
effectiveness in self-managing work teams. In other words, we will suggest that the relation-
ship between team turnover and effectiveness in self-managing work teams will be generally 
negative and that this negative relationship can be explained by the effects of team turnover 
on social integration, team learning behaviors, and task flexibility.

Social integration. Past research has reported positive relationships between social inte-
gration and task group effectiveness. Socially-integrated teams are expected to perform better 
because they are performing their work as a group rather than as a collection of individuals. 
Individual efforts, information, and knowledge are therefore more likely to be coordinated 
in the service of task accomplishment in a socially integrated team. A study by Smith et al. 
(1994) supports this expectation. They found that social integration was positively associ-
ated with both return on investment and sales growth in a sample of 53 top management 
teams from technology-intensive firms. These results are consistent with research on group 
cohesiveness which suggests that members of cohesive groups work harder and longer to 
solve group problems (Berkowitz, 1954; Shaw & Shaw, 1962). As noted above, social inte-
gration is particularly critical in self-managing work teams where member commitment and 
bottom-up  coordination  are  critical  success  factors  (Druskat  &  Pescosolido,  2002).  We 
therefore expect that one way team turnover can influence effectiveness in self-managing work 
teams is through its effect on social integration. Stated formally,

Hypothesis 4: Social integration partially mediates a generally negative relationship between team 

turnover and effectiveness in self-managing work teams.

Team  learning  behaviors.  Research  from  several  past  studies  has  suggested  that  team 
learning behaviors are positively associated with team performance outcomes in task groups 
(Edmondson,  1999;  Gibson  &  Vermeulen,  2003;  Schippers,  Den  Hartog,  Koopman,  & 
Wienk, 2003; Van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005). Teams that engage in learning behaviors are 
more likely to learn from their mistakes, integrate new information about their environment,

benefit from member experience, effectively use member diversity in information and per-
spective, and better coordinate their efforts—all of which should lead to higher task perfor-
mance. And these activities are especially critical in self-managing work teams where learning 
takes place within the group. A second means by which team turnover can influence effec-
tiveness in self-managing work teams is by influencing levels of learning behavior within the 
team.

Recall,  however,  that  Hypothesis  2  posited  a  curvilinear  relationship  between  team 
turnover and team learning behavior. That is, we expected small amounts of team turnover 
to have a positive effect on team learning behavior whereas larger amounts of team turnover 
would have a negative effect. If the relationship between team turnover and team effective-
ness were fully explained by team learning behavior, this hypothesis would imply that the 
team turnover–effectiveness relationship in self-managing work teams would also be curvi-
linear. But, because we have acknowledged that other processes will also mediate the team 
turnover-performance  relationship,  processes  which  we  expect  to  exhibit  monotonic  rela-
tionships  with  team  turnover,  we  expect  that  the  relationship  between  team  turnover  and 
performance in self-managing work teams will be generally negative. And at higher levels 
of team turnover, this negative relationship can be partially explained by a team’s decreased 
engagement in team learning behaviors. Stated formally,

Hypothesis 5: Team learning behavior partially mediates a generally negative relationship between 

team turnover and effectiveness in self-managing work teams.

Task flexibility. Past research has also suggested that task flexibility can be associated 
with higher task group effectiveness. When group members can rotate tasks, the best prac-
tices learned or developed by each member in performing particular work are more likely to 
be shared because group members can observe and learn from the task performance of other 
group members. Furthermore, these group members can more readily fill in for one another 
or  provide  task  assistance  when  unusual  situations  arise  and  can  work  together  to  solve 
complicated task-related problems. And as noted earlier, these bottom-up task coordination 
behaviors are particularly critical for self-managing work teams. Consistent with this expec-
tation,  Campion  et  al.  (1993)  found  a  positive  and  significant  relationship  between  task 
flexibility and supervisor ratings of team effectiveness in a sample of 79 work teams. The 
following hypothesis therefore seems reasonable:

Hypothesis 6: Task flexibility partially mediates a generally negative relationship between team 

turnover and effectiveness in self-managing work teams.

Sample and Data

Method

We tested these hypotheses using data obtained from self-managing production teams in 
a large truck manufacturing plant of the Volvo Company in Sweden. This manufacturing

facility  builds  between  45,000  and  55,000  truck  cabs  annually,  mostly  for  the  European 
market, from steel plate to completely fitted cabs. The teams included in this study were 
operating in the “press and detail” and “assembly” areas of the manufacturing facility where 
they were responsible for completing production tasks of similar complexity and workflow 
interdependence with efficiency and high quality. Volvo has been a pioneer in using prin-
ciples  of  self-managing  teams  in  its  manufacturing  facilities  and  has  been  doing  so  with 
documented  success  for  several  decades  (see  Berggren,  1993;  Engström,  Blomquist,  & 
Holmström, 2004). The teams in this facility were organized according to these established 
principles such that each team had the autonomy to decide how to organize their own efforts 
in order to maintain high standards of quality and productivity (for a detailed description of 
these teams, see Kuipers, De Witte, & Van der Zwaan, 2004).

This sample of teams had several notable strengths given the purposes of this research. 
First, these are ongoing self-managing production teams with a history of intensive, work-
related interaction. Second, these teams all come from the same organization, which mini-
mizes  concerns  about  potential  contextual  confounds  that  arise  when  teams  come  from 
different organizations. Third, meaningful, objective measures of performance were avail-
able  for  these  teams  (described  below).  And  fourth,  there  was  variation  in  team  turnover 
across these teams.

We  collected  data  from  these  production  teams  using  a  cross-lagged  panel  design 
(Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Rogosa, 1980). In this research design, measures are obtained 
at two (or more) points in time such that a researcher can consider the effects of an indepen-
dent variable (or variables) at Time 1 (t1) on a dependent variable (or variables) at Time 2 
(t2) while controlling for the dependent variable at t1. This approach allows us to examine 
whether team turnover helps to explain that portion of variance in team process or perfor-
mance that is not accounted for by prior or baseline levels of each process or performance 
dependent variable. By controlling for process or performance at an earlier point in time, we 
are essentially examining the relationship between team turnover and changes in process and 
performance between t1 and t2 (Finkel, 1995). Although a significant coefficient for team 
turnover or process in such an analysis does not prove causation, it is strongly suggestive 
(Williams & Podsakoff, 1989). As a result, researchers studying team turnover (e.g., Dineen 
&  Noe,  2003)  have  recommended  this  design  (while  lamenting  that  few  studies  of  team 
turnover have actually adopted it).

Data were collected at two points in time separated by 1 year. We selected a 1-year period 
in this study under the assumption that 1 year would be long enough for team turnover to 
have observable effects on team processes and performance (see Keck & Tushman, 1993). 
Data were collected on site by the third author with the cooperation and assistance of our orga-
nizational partners. Data were collected by means of a team member survey, a supervisor 
survey, and by consulting organizational archives. Team members and supervisors completed 
surveys during one of their daily team meetings. Individual responses were anonymous.

Usable team member responses were received from 55 teams at t1 and 61 teams at t2. 
Usable supervisor responses were received from 52 supervisors at t1 and 56 supervisors at 
t2. Mean intrateam response rates were 88% at t1 (SD = .15) and 93% at t2 (SD = .17). Our 
final sample consisted of 47 teams for which the necessary t1 and t2 team turnover, process, 
and  performance  data  were  available.  This  sample  size  is  comparable  with  sample  sizes

reported in other studies of team turnover (e.g., Campion et al., 1996; Shaw et al., 2005). 
Average team size was 10 (SD = 2.7). Average team tenure was 2.8 years (SD = 2.3). In 
terms of sample characteristics, 81% of the sample was male, average age was 33.6 years 
(SD = 6.8), and 11% of respondents had completed only a secondary education (with 61% 
completing a lower level of vocational education and 28% completing an intermediate level 
of vocational education). None of these sample characteristics was significantly related to 
team turnover.

Measures

The  team  member  and  supervisor  surveys  consisted  of  Likert-type  scale  items  with  a 
5-point response scale ranging from 1 = strongly agree, to 5 = strongly disagree. Survey 
items were randomly ordered to alleviate bias. All items were adapted from existing scales. 
However, based on the results of a pilot study and after extensive discussions with employ-
ees,  the  wording  of  some  items  (particularly  those  measuring  social  integration  and  team 
learning behavior) were changed to increase their interpretability and relevance for the teams 
under study. We conducted a validation study with 94 masters of business administration 
(MBA) students to examine the convergence of these revised items with published, validated 
scales. Those results are described below.

Team turnover. We measured team turnover as the number of members who left a team 
between t1 and t2. Furthermore, as Arrow and McGrath (1995: 396) noted, “[M]agnitude of 
team turnover must be considered in relation to group size and relative proportion of mem-
bers involved . . . [T]he bigger the proportion of the group involved, the stronger the effects.” 
(p. 396). We therefore divided the number of departures between t1 and t2 by group size at 
t1 to arrive at our measure of team turnover for this study. This measure is consistent with 
existing measures of team turnover (e.g., Kacmar et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2005). All mem-
bership changes that took place in this sample of teams during the study period were volun-
tary changes.

Social integration. Past research has measured social integration using items that assess 
three underlying dimensions: team cohesiveness, behavioral integration, and an individual’s 
personal satisfaction with the team (see O’Reilly et al., 1989; Shaw, 1981; Smith et al., 1994; 
Van der Vegt, 2002). Given limitations in the items that we could include in our survey, we 
developed  a  three-item  measure  of  social  integration  to  assess  these  three  dimensions  of 
social  integration.  Specifically,  we  measured  social  integration  using  the  following  three 
items: “The members of this team form a cohesive unit” (team cohesiveness), “The members 
of  this  team  really  work  together  as  a  team”  (behavioral  integration),  and  “I  like  to  be  a 
member of this team” (personal satisfaction with the team). Cronbach’s alpha for this three-
item measure was .80 at t1 and .79 at t2. To verify that this reduced scale remains a valid 
measure  of  the  underlying  construct,  we  compared  our  three-item  scale  with  the  six-item 
scale in Van der Vegt (2002) using data from our validation study among 94 MBA students. 
We found that a one-factor model provided strong fit, c2(27) = 87.90, p = .001, comparative

fit index (CFI) = .92, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .06, goodness-of-fit 
index (GFI) = .89, normed fit index (NFI) = .89, and that a two-factor solution in which these 
two scales loaded on separate factors did not reduce the chi-square over a one-factor model 
(Dc2 = 1.03, p = .31). Moreover, the Pearson correlation between the two social integration 
measures was .76 (p < .001). These results support our scale as a valid measure of the one-
dimensional construct measured with the six-item scale in Van der Vegt (2002).

Team  learning  behavior.  Team  learning  behavior  was  measured  from  team  member 
responses  to  four  items  that  were  adapted  from  the  work  of  Drach-Zahavy  and  Somech 
(2001) and Van der Vegt and Bunderson (2005) with input from our organizational partners. 
The four items were “The team acts upon errors/mistakes,” “Team members support initia-
tives for improvement from others,” “Team members take the initiative to improve things,” 
and “The team often reflects upon its own functioning.” Cronbach’s alpha for this four-item 
scale was .72 at t1 and .74 at t2. As with social integration, we compared our revised items 
with the team learning behavior scale in Van der Vegt and Bunderson (2005) using data from 
our validation study. We found that a two-factor solution in which these two scales loaded on 
separate factors actually increased the chi-square over a one-factor model (two-factor solu-
tion, c2[13] = 39.1, p < .001, CFI = .92, SRMR = .06, GFI = .88, NFI = .88; one-factor solu-
tion, c2[14] = 19.1, p < .16, CFI = .96, SRMR = .06, GFI = .94, NFI = .88). Moreover, the 
Pearson correlation between the two learning measures was .78 (p < .001). This pattern of 
results confirms that these two scales assess the same underlying construct.1

Task flexibility. Task flexibility was measured using a three-item scale adapted from the 
scale developed by Campion et al., (1993). The items were revised slightly based on pilot 
study results and discussions with employees. The three items were “All team members fill 
in for one another if necessary,” “Team members are able to perform all different tasks in 
the team,” and “Team members regularly shift tasks.” Cronbach’s alpha for this three-item 
scale was .77 at t1 and .80 at t2.

Confirmatory  factor  analysis.  We  conducted  confirmatory  factor  analyses  to  assess  the 
convergent and discriminant validity of the social integration, team learning behavior, and 
task  flexibility  scales.  Parameter  estimates  were  computed  using  the  LISREL  8  computer 
package, with the maximum likelihood method. The expected three-factor model resulted in 
a satisfactory fit of the measurement model to the data at t1: c2(32) = 222.79, p < .001, 
SRMR = .05, GFI = .91, CFI = .90, NFI = .89. For the t2 data also, results showed a satisfac-
tory fit, c2(32) = 247.43, p < .001, SRMR = .06, GFI = .90, CFI = .89, NFI = .88). The load-
ing of each item on its corresponding construct was significant at the .001 level or better at 
both t1 and t2, indicating convergent validity. These three-factor models fit the data signifi-
cantly better than all possible alternative one- or two-factor models (p < .001), supporting the 
discriminant validity of the task flexibility, learning behavior, and social integration scales.

Interrater  agreement  and  reliability.  Team-level  measures  of  social  integration,  team 
learning behavior, and task flexibility were computed by averaging responses from all team 
members.  To  verify  that  aggregation  was  justified,  we  evaluated  interrater  agreement  by

computing  an rwg  score  for  each  team  on  each  of  these  three  variables  for  both  t1  and  t2 
responses using a “small skew” distribution (James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984: 93-94). Results 
suggested strong interrater agreement within teams with median rwg scores of .93 (t1) and 
.90 (t2) for social integration, .95 (t1) and .94 (t2) for team learning behavior, and .94 (t1) 
and .94 (t2) for task flexibility. The lowest rwg score for any of these t1 or t2 scales across 
all teams was .63.

We also evaluated the extent to which social integration, team learning behavior, and task 
flexibility were, in fact, meaningful team-level measures in this sample of teams by comput-
ing ICC(1) and ICC(2) scores (ICC = intraclass correlation) for each of these three variables 
at t1 and t2 (see Bliese, 2000; Dineen & Noe, 2003). ICC(1) scores were very strong with 
scores of .59 (t1) and .63 (t2) for social integration, .48 (t1) and .52 (t2) for team learning 
behavior, and .59 (t1) and .75 (t2) for task flexibility. ICC(2) scores were also strong for 
social integration (.74 at t1 and .77 at t2), team learning behavior (.65 at t1 and .68 at t2), 
and task flexibility (.73 at t1 and .86 at t2). These results provide very strong evidence that 
these  process  measures  converge  within  teams  while  varying  across  teams  and  therefore 
provide valid and useful insight into key process differences across the teams in this sample.

Team  effectiveness.  Team  effectiveness  was  measured  as  the  percentage  of  a  team’s 
assigned daily work that left the team without unacceptable defects the first time through. In 
this context, zero-defect percentage is a direct measure of the extent to which a team effec-
tively  accomplishes  the  goals  it  was  designed  to  accomplish,  namely,  to  perform  high-
quality  work  on  a  given  number  of  vehicles  each  day.  To  calculate  a  team  effectiveness 
measure for this study, we averaged zero-defect measures for 4 consecutive weeks that coin-
cided with the period in which survey data were being collected. A shorter period than 4 weeks 
(e.g., 1 week) would have resulted in effectiveness data that might be biased by short-term 
fluctuations in effectiveness (e.g., production stops due to maintenance, staffing problems 
due to illness, etc.). A much longer period (e.g., 1 year) would have resulted in effectiveness 
scores  that  do  not  reflect  the  changes  in  effectiveness  resulting  from  interteam  differ-
ences regarding our process measures at the time of our study. Moreover, the choice of a 
4-week period was practical because the planning and feedback systems at Volvo are based 
on a 4-week period. So, we computed one 4-week measure of team effectiveness from t1 
weekly quality measures and a second 4-week measure of team effectiveness from t2 weekly 
quality measures.

Control variables. We controlled for several variables to explicitly consider and eliminate 
alternative explanations for observed effects. First, we controlled for average team tenure 
and team tenure heterogeneity because these two variables have been commonly used in past 
research as indirect measures of team turnover/stability within teams (Ancona & Caldwell, 
1992; Katz, 1982). We measured team tenure from team member responses and team tenure 
heterogeneity  as  the  coefficient  of  variation  (standard  deviation  divided  by  the  mean)  in 
team tenure scores for members of a given team.

We  controlled  for  changes  in  member  experience  to  explicitly  consider  the  alternative 
explanation that any performance effects due to team turnover result from experience losses 
rather than process losses (see Shaw et al., 2005). We measured changes in member experience

as the average organizational tenure of team members at t2 minus the average organizational 
tenure  of  team  members  at  t1.  We  also  controlled  for  changes  in  team  size  because  the 
effects of team turnover on team processes and performance may be different for teams that 
grew rather than shrunk (Arrow & McGrath, 1995). We measured changes in team size as 
team size at t2 divided by team size at t1.

Finally, we controlled for past levels of each process and performance dependent variable 
in all regression models as required by a cross-lagged panel design. And because process can 
be affected by prior performance levels (Lindsley, Brass, & Thomas, 1995), we left prior 
performance levels in all regression models (not just in models where performance was the 
dependent variable).

Analyses

Hypotheses were tested using cross-lagged hierarchical multiple regression analysis as 
noted above (Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Rogosa, 1980; Williams & Podsakoff, 1989). Prior 
levels of process and performance (the lagged dependent variable and prior performance) 
were entered in the first block. Control variables (team tenure, team tenure heterogeneity, 
experience change, and team size change) were entered in a second block. Process mediators 
were entered in a third block (for performance only). And, finally, team turnover (and in the 
case of team learning behavior, team turnover squared) was entered in a fourth block. The 
change in R2 was noted and reported for each block. We report only the beta coefficients 
from the final block of the regression model.

We examined mediation using the procedures recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986). 
That is, we looked for significant relationships between team turnover and each of our three 
mediating  variables  (social  integration,  team  learning  behavior,  and  task  flexibility)  and 
between  team  turnover  and  performance  without  the  mediating  variables  included  in  the 
model. We then added the mediators to the performance model and looked for significant 
relationships between each mediator and performance and a smaller and statistically nonsig-
nificant  relationship  between  team  turnover  and  performance.  This  pattern  of  results  is 
consistent with our expectation that the effect of team turnover on performance is accounted 
for by its effect on the three mediating processes.

Descriptive Statistics

Results

Descriptive statistics and correlations among all study variables are presented in Table 1. 
As we see in Table 1, mean team turnover was around .40 per year with considerable varia-
tion across teams in the magnitude of team turnover. Each of the t1 process and performance 
measures was significantly correlated with the corresponding measure at t2, suggesting sta-
bility  in  these  measures  across  time,  although  these  autocorrelations  were  lower  for  task 
flexibility and social integration (.55 and .50 vs. .74 and .78 for learning behavior and

performance, respectively). Finally, the Pearson zero-order correlations between t2 process 
and performance measures were significant and, for the most part, in the directions antici-
pated by the above hypotheses. Interestingly, the correlations between the process and perfor-
mance measures were stronger at t2 than at t1. A possible reason for this change in relations 
over time is that in the 6 months preceding t1, the facility changed the lay-out of the assem-
bly stations and the work methods used. Teams had to become familiar with these new work 
practices, which may have attenuated the concurrent relationships between team processes 
and performance at t1. However, because these changes took place before the actual study 
was conducted, it is unlikely that they have affected the relationships between team turnover 
at t1 and subsequent changes in team processes and performance between t1 and t2.

Hypothesis Testing

Table 2 presents the results of our cross-lagged hierarchical multiple regression analyses. 
All regressions met the major model assumptions. That is, no serious violations were found 
in the plots of standardized residuals as compared with the predicted values, in the normal 
probability plots of standardized residuals, and in the independence of error terms. Moreover, 
variance  inflation  factors  for  all  models  were  all  well  below  4,  suggesting  that  multicol-
linearity was not a problem in our analyses (Miles & Shevlin 2001).

The first set of analyses examined the relationship between team turnover and the three 
process variables: social integration, team learning behavior, and task flexibility. Adding the 
first block of variables to the regression equations revealed significant and positive coeffi-
cients for all of the lagged dependent process variables, and significant and positive coeffi-
cients for prior performance in the case of social integration (b = .34, p < .05) as well as task 
flexibility  (b  =  .29,  p  <  .05).  Of  the  control  variables  entered  in  the  second  block,  only 
change in team size was significantly and negatively related to learning behavior. In the final 
block  of  the  analysis,  team  turnover  (and  team  turnover  squared  in  the  case  of  learning 
behavior) was added to the regression equations. Significant and negative relationships were 
found between team turnover and social integration (b = -.32, p < .05, DR2 = .06), learning 
behavior (b = -.41, p < .01, DR2 = .10), and task flexibility (b = -.37, p < .01, DR2 = .09). 
The relationships between team turnover squared and learning behavior were not significant. 
Together, these results are consistent with Hypothesis 1 (social integration) and Hypothesis 3 
(task flexibility), but not Hypothesis 2 (team learning behavior squared; we did, however, 
observe a negative linear relationship between team turnover and team learning behavior).

In the second set of analyses, we tested the direct relationship between team turnover and 
team effectiveness as well as the hypothesized mediating role of the three process variables. 
After controlling for prior performance, team tenure, team tenure heterogeneity, experience 
change, and team size change, team turnover was found to be significantly and negatively 
related to team effectiveness (b= -.36, p < .001, DR2 = .09). When the three process media-
tors were added to the model, however, the coefficient for team turnover no longer reached 
significance (b = -.17, NS) whereas significant coefficients were found for both learning 
behavior (b = .33, p < .01) and task flexibility (b = .22, p < .05). The coefficient for social 
integration  was  not  significant  (b  =  -.17,  NS).  Together,  the  three  process  mediators

van der Vegt et al. / Why Turnover Matters in Self-Managing Work Teams    1185

explained an additional 19% of the variance in performance. These results, together with 
those above, suggest that learning behavior and task flexibility fully mediate the effects of 
team turnover on performance as suggested in Hypotheses 5 and 6.

Discussion

Taken together, the findings of this study support two key conclusions about the relation-
ship between team turnover, process, and performance in self-managing work teams. First, 
team turnover has a negative effect on the performance of self-managing work teams. This 
finding  confirms  and  extends  research  conducted  in  other  types  of  teams  (Argote  et  al., 
1995; Goodman & Leyden, 1991; Kacmar et al., 2006). Second, and more important, this 
negative effect of team turnover on performance in self-managing teams is due in large part 
to the disruptive effect of team turnover on the key interaction processes that enable success-
ful self-management, namely, on team learning behavior and task flexibility.

Theoretical Implications

The present study advances our understanding of self-managing work teams by examin-
ing  how  team  turnover  affects  specific  interaction  processes  deemed  critical  to  effective 
self-management in teams, namely, social integration, team learning behavior, and task flex-
ibility (Druskat & Pescosolido, 2002). Our results confirm that team learning behavior and 
task flexibility do indeed promote effectiveness in self-managing work teams. Social inte-
gration was not significantly associated with team performance when included in a regres-
sion model with the other process variables, suggesting that social integration may not be a 
critical performance requirement in self-managing teams. Moreover, we extend past research 
on self-managing work team effectiveness by suggesting and demonstrating that team turn-
over can disrupt processes of team learning and task flexibility and thereby compromise team 
effectiveness. These results therefore enrich our understanding of group processes and effec-
tiveness in self-managing work teams by elaborating an important antecedent condition.

Additionally,  our  findings  provide  support  for  a  process  losses  theory  of  membership 
change in self-managing work teams, an important complement to the social capital losses 
theory proposed by Dess and Shaw (2001). Dess and Shaw have argued that commonly-used 
human capital and cost-based explanations cannot fully account for the negative effects of 
personnel departures on organizational performance and that we must also consider “social 
capital losses” resulting from departures, that is, decreases in the quality and efficiency of 
network interactions. This social capital losses theory of personnel turnover was supported 
in  a  study  of  restaurants  in  which  it  was  found  that  changes  in  network  structure  due  to 
member  departures  compromised  organizational  performance  after  controlling  for  human 
capital losses, that is, the loss of high-performing employees (Shaw et al., 2005). The present 
article complements this past work by supporting a “process losses theory” of team turnover 
in self-managing work teams, a theory in which the negative effect of team turnover on per-
formance is a function of decreases in the quality and efficiency of key interaction processes

within the team, over and above the effect of changes in the aggregate experience of group 
members (i.e., human capital losses or gains). This approach extends the social capital losses 
theory to the domain of self-managing work teams and to the question of group processes.

The research presented here also offers several refinements to the way we think about 
learning behavior in teams. For example, past research has often focused on the advantages 
of team turnover for team learning, suggesting that team turnover can signal an opportunity 
for self-reflection in teams, can shake up existing practices, and can introduce new ideas and 
insights  (Arrow  &  McGrath,  1993;  Katz,  1982;  Ziller  et  al.,  1962).  In  this  article,  we 
acknowledged these potential benefits but suggested that the disruptive effect of high levels 
of team turnover could also compromise team learning efforts by creating an environment 
of uncertainty and reduced psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999; Moreland & Levine, 
2002;  O’Connor  et  al.,  1993).  We  therefore  explicitly  considered  the  possibility  that  the 
relationship between team turnover and team learning behavior would be quadratic—positive 
at lower levels of team turnover but negative at higher levels. This quadratic hypothesis was 
not supported. Instead, we found a negative linear relationship between team turnover and 
learning behavior in this sample of self-managing teams. This result suggests that in the case 
of self-managing work teams, any amount of team turnover may create an uncertain inter-
personal environment in which team members are uncomfortable taking the risks necessary 
to engage in learning behaviors. Some degree of membership stability therefore seems impor-
tant to learning behaviors in self-managing work teams.

These results also confirm that team learning behavior is positively associated with team 
performance, even after controlling for the effects of past performance, tenure, tenure het-
erogeneity, experience changes, changes in team size, and the other group process measures 
(social  integration  and  task  flexibility).  This  finding  provides  an  important  validation  of 
past research in which a positive relationship between learning behavior and team perfor-
mance was observed using subjective performance ratings (Edmondson, 1999; Gibson & 
Vermeulen, 2003; Schippers et al., 2003; Van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005). Although the 
use  of  subjective  performance  ratings  is  certainly  defensible  in  research  on  teams,  it  is 
important  to  establish  that  the  same  performance  relationships  hold  when  performance 
measures that truly matter to an organization are used. This study confirms a relationship 
between  team  learning  behaviors  and  team  performance  using  an  objective  measure  of 
performance quality.

Finally, the research design adopted in this study addresses many of the criticisms that 
have  been  leveled  at  past  research  on  team  turnover,  offering  greater  assurance  that  the 
observed findings are, in fact, robust. Specifically, most research on team turnover in teams 
has been conducted in laboratory teams (with minimal history, artificial tasks, low stakes) 
by rotating a member out of the team and then noting the consequences for decision quality 
or performance. Although this approach has the benefits of experimental control, it raises 
questions about how team turnover will affect group outcomes in real organizational teams 
with varying levels of team turnover and using objective and strategically important mea-
sures of group performance. The design of this study allowed us to speak directly to these 
questions. Furthermore, the cross-lagged panel design adopted in this study allowed us to 
control for prior levels of process and performance in these teams in order to better isolate 
the  effects  of  team  turnover  in  a  given  time  period  for  group  process  and  performance

van der Vegt et al. / Why Turnover Matters in Self-Managing Work Teams    1187

following that period. These design characteristics give us greater confidence that the effects 
observed here are robust effects.

Limitations and Future Research Directions

Although this study had several notable strengths (e.g., a field setting with self-managing 
team experience, objective performance measures, longitudinal data), there were also some 
accompanying limitations in terms of measurement. Specifically, we used condensed mea-
sures  of  social  integration  and  team  learning  behavior  rather  than  complete  scales  from 
previously-validated  research.  To  provide  some  assurance  that  these  revised  scales  were 
valid measures of the underlying constructs, we conducted a validation study in a separate 
sample of MBA students. Results from that analysis strongly supported the validity of our 
measures. Nevertheless, future research using more complete scales would provide additional 
confidence in these results.

In addition, this study was conducted using a sample of self-managing work teams in a 
manufacturing setting. Although this sample is certainly representative of the type of work 
that many teams perform, it is possible that the results observed here would not generalize 
to teams that must constantly change their routines and structures in response to a changing 
stream  of  nonroutine  inputs,  and  therefore,  might  respond  very  differently  to  changes  in 
team membership. One might even argue that team turnover would be critical in such teams 
because it offers a key source of new ideas and perspectives. On the other hand, teams facing 
more complex, nonroutine task environments might need even greater stability to consis-
tently apply a more complex set of decision-making routines in making sense of that envi-
ronment.  In  other  words,  the  moderating  role  of  task  complexity  and  variability  on  the 
relationship  between  team  turnover  and  team  outcomes  (process  or  performance)  is  still 
largely unknown and, consequently, it is premature to assume that the results observed here 
would be obtained in teams engaged in different tasks.

Finally, our focus in this article has been on the disruptive effects of team turnover rather 
than on the potentially divergent effects of member arrivals. In most standing self-managing 
work  teams,  including  the  teams  in  our  sample,  team  turnover  and  member  additions  are 
generally highly correlated. As a result, it is difficult if not impossible in such settings to 
disentangle the independent effects of one versus the other. In settings where departures and 
arrivals are loosely coupled, however, it may be useful to examine the independent effects 
of these distinct change events (see Arrow & McGrath, 1995). If the goal is to isolate the 
independent process effects of additions and subtractions, samples in which teams experi-
ence  just  one  or  just  the  other  type  of  membership  change  are  needed.  This  may  require 
follow-up research in controlled laboratory settings.

Managerial Implications

Despite these limitations, the results of this study have important implications for practic-
ing managers involved in designing or overseeing self-managing work teams. Specifically,

this study confirms that team turnover can have detrimental consequences for effectiveness 
in self-managing work teams and, just as importantly, helps us to understand why this is the 
case.  These  results  imply  that  organizations  adopting  self-managing  work  teams  should 
commit to maintaining stable team membership where possible and should carefully con-
sider the effect of other, perhaps well-intentioned, human resource policies and practices on 
the membership of established teams (e.g., restructuring initiatives, temporary team assign-
ments).  Moreover,  if  organization-initiated  team  membership  changes  are  necessary  or  if 
changes  are  initiated  by  members  themselves,  the  results  of  this  study  can  be  helpful  in 
predicting how turnover will affect the key interaction processes that are necessary for team 
effectiveness.  This  knowledge  may,  in  turn,  help  managers  to  craft  targeted  remedies  for 
minimizing  the  negative  process  consequences  of  team  turnover—in  the  same  way  that 
knowing how patients tend to react to a particular drug or surgical procedure improves our 
ability to dampen the negative consequences of that drug or procedure and therefore hasten 
recovery. In the case of self-managing teams experiencing turnover, this may mean targeted 
interventions to improve intrateam trust (e.g., off-site team-building) or member awareness 
of each member’s task (e.g., cross-training).

Note

1. As a test of discriminant validity, we compared this one-factor team learning behavior scale with the one-
factor social integration scale described above. A two-factor solution provided a significantly better fit over a one-
factor solution with Dc2(1) = 121.27, p = .001, suggesting that survey respondents clearly differentiated between 
these theoretically distinct items.
