The Effects of Cross-Functional Integration on Proﬁtability, Process
Efﬁciency, and Asset Productivity

W e employ information processing theory (IPT) to posit beneﬁcial impacts of internal integration on ﬁrm proﬁtability and its underlying

components of process efﬁciency and asset productivity. We further hypothesize that these effects are greater for ﬁrms that operate
wider spans of supply chain processes. These expectations are tested with the combination of two different data sources: primary data collected
to gauge levels of internal integration, and secondary data collected from ﬁnancial reports including proﬁtability performance and related ﬁnan-
cial ratios. The results provide evidence that internal integration mainly affects proﬁts by driving process efﬁciencies. These efﬁciencies appear
to be especially signiﬁcant in sales, general, and administrative related costs for ﬁrms that have broad process spans. In contrast, the data analy-
sis offers no evidence of a relationship between internal integration and asset productivity. Based on these ﬁndings, we point out important
implications for the applicability of IPT in explaining the effects of internal integration, and identify a call for action for practitioners. Overall,
our study enhances both the rigor and relevance of internal integration research by grounding it in IPT, by utilizing objectively reported ﬁnan-
cial data, by identifying speciﬁc cost beneﬁts, and by studying the impact of process span as an important contingency.

INTRODUCTION

integration,

Internal integration, also known as cross-functional, inter-func-
tional, and inter-departmental
is deﬁned as the
mutual alignment of cross-functional interdependencies through
interaction,
information sharing, and collaboration (Kahn and
Mentzer 1998; Morash and Clinton 1998; Pagell 2004). Research
into the effects of internal integration is still emerging, often only
descriptive, and lacking deep theoretical grounding (a summary
of past research is provided in Appendix A). More rigor and rel-
evance is needed (Frankel and Mollenkopf 2013), particularly
regarding internal
integration’s performance impacts. From the
perspective of practice, many supply chain managers perceive
that their companies have become proﬁcient in external integra-
tion, but not in internal integration (Poirier et al. 2008). Organi-
zational, political, and resource-related challenges make high
levels of integration difﬁcult to achieve and maintain, and current
research falls short of providing the strong evidence needed to
make a solid business case for investments in organizational
changes, training, and technologies typically required. Demon-
strated impacts on proﬁt metrics, as studied in this research, are
needed to convince managers of the beneﬁts associated with
internal integration (cf. Timme and Williams-Timme 2000; Man-
rodt et al. 2005; Ellinger et al. 2011).

This research article documents our efforts to extend work on
internal integration. We study the impact of internal integration
on proﬁtability, through process efﬁciency and asset speciﬁcity.
Speciﬁcally, we add rigor and relevance to the study of internal
integration by deeply grounding our expectations in information

processing theory (IPT), by measuring achieved (rather
than
expected) internal integration, by investigating the direct effects
of internal integration on objectively reported measures of ﬁnan-
cial performance, and by studying supply chain process span as
an important contingency that moderates integration’s effects.
This work thus signiﬁcantly extends past research efforts which
have often lacked a theoretical anchor, have exclusively relied
upon perceptual measures of performance, and have largely
ignored contingency factors other than external integration and
uncertainty. From a managerial perspective, by demonstrating
bottom-line beneﬁts, we issue a call for practitioners to become
more internally integrated, with a focus on the apparent transac-
tional beneﬁts that integration provides.

Our arguments relating internal integration to proﬁtability, pro-
cess efﬁciency and asset productivity are grounded in the IPT
(Galbraith 1974). Speciﬁcally, we view internal integration as a
key information processing capability that reduces both uncer-
tainty and equivocality, thus enabling better process efﬁciency
and asset productivity. Such capability is posited to be especially
valuable in today’s complex, dynamic, and hypercompetitive
market environment. Internal
integration helps workers across
functions to process gathered information better and faster, to
develop a shared understanding, and distribute it
to the most
appropriate constituents within the ﬁrm, thus providing an impor-
tant infrastructural support for value-creating processes. In addi-
tion, by developing an integrative foundation for processing and
sharing information, the bounded rationality (Williamson 1985)
of workers is likely reduced, enabling better decision making.

Building upon the arguments above, we contribute to research
and practice by developing a more precise theory of IPT and its
applicability to internal integration. In addition, the results of the
study suggest even ﬁner-grained applications of
the theory.
While we conﬁrm the positive association of internal integration

efﬁciencies, the association of internal integration with greater

asset productivity is not supported. These ﬁndings suggest that
internal
integration beneﬁts apply more to transactional and
transformational efﬁciencies reﬂected by labor and material costs,
rather than to utilization or other productivity factors reﬂected by
capital costs. We further ﬁnd that the association of internal inte-
gration with proﬁt
is magniﬁed by ﬁrms’ process spans. The
added beneﬁts of integration for ﬁrms with wider process spans
appear to be mainly a product of better transactional efﬁciencies
reﬂected by lower sales, general, and administrative (SG&A)
costs.

These ﬁndings contribute to the understanding of internal inte-
gration by adding speciﬁcity and a novel perspective on its
effects. In addition, the ﬁndings provide guidance for managers
regarding what they should expect, and how they should measure
the impacts of internal integration efforts. We thus extend the
empirical corroboration and conﬁrmation of a concept considered
to be fundamental to supply chain management (SCM).

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. First, we
review key tenets of IPT and substantiate its application to our
research. In addition, we review extant work on internal integra-
tion and demonstrate the need for more rigor and relevance in its
study. Second, we develop a set of hypotheses relating internal
integration to various ﬁnancial performance measures, and pro-
vide arguments for the moderating role of process span. Our
expectations are grounded in IPT. Third, we describe the meth-
odology applied to test our hypotheses, including an overview of
the data collection and sample, and the measures. Fourth, we
report the statistical analyses and results, followed by exploratory
extensions and robustness tests. Fifth, we discuss our results and
highlight their implications, especially in terms of how we have
enhanced the rigor and relevance of internal integration’s study,
and how our results extend the IPT. And sixth, we conclude our
work with a summary,
including limitations, and avenues for
future research.

INFORMATION PROCESSING THEORY AND
INTERNAL INTEGRATION

Information processing theory

IPT views organizations as entities that aim to efﬁciently gather,
interpret, synthesize, and coordinate information (Burns and
Wholey 1993). Underlying this notion is the assumption that
ﬁrms are open social systems that face uncertainties (Tushman
and Nadler 1978). This condition creates the need for informa-
tion processing mechanisms. Galbraith (1974) suggests three
ways to manage low levels of uncertainty: coordination by rules
or programs, hierarchy, and coordination by targets and goals.
However, if uncertainty levels exceed the processing capabilities
of these routine mechanisms, Galbraith (1974) maintains that
organizations can either reduce the need for information process-
ing (via the creation of slack resources, buffers, and self-con-
tained tasks) or increase the capacity to process information (via
investment in vertical information systems and creation of lateral
relations).

The IPT provides a useful lens to investigate the link between
internal integration and ﬁnancial performance (proﬁtability, pro-
cess efﬁciency and asset productivity) in three important ways.

life cycles,

First, today’s competitive and dynamic environment is character-
ized by shortening product
increasing customer
expectations, heightening competition, and decreasing margins
(Weick and Quinn 1999). As such, dealing with uncertainty has
become a primary concern for managers (Merschmann and
Thonemann 2011). Information can be gathered from suppliers
and customers as a means to reduce or manage uncertainties
(Kahn et al. 2006). However, ﬁrms also need internal informa-
tion processing capabilities in order to interpret and channel
externally collected information to the most appropriate internal
stakeholders (Schoenherr and Swink 2012). Moreover, divisional
organizational structures can also create uncertainties within a
ﬁrm. For example, when interdependent departments conduct
planning and decision making independently, one unit
is left
with uncertainty about another department’s actions. In contrast,
integrative organizational structures (e.g., cross-functional teams,
an example of lateral relations) clarify interdependencies and
build information processing capabilities (Tushman and Nadler
1978). Such structures, along with other integrative lateral pro-
cesses and vertical information systems, reduce uncertainties by
giving organizations the ability to share and structure information
for best use.

Second, adaptations of the IPT include the notion of equivo-
cality, along with uncertainty, as a driver of information process-
ing needs. Once managers acquire information, deciding on the
best action might not be as straightforward as it would seem.
The meaning of information can be unclear and subject to differ-
ent interpretations (Daft and Macintosh 1981), representing what
has been termed equivocality (Daft and Weick 1984). Informa-
tion thus needs to be processed, that is, sense-making needs to
take place, and a common understanding needs to be developed.
Again,

such information processing, thereby helping to promote a shared
interpretation of
information among various decision makers
(Daft and Lengel 1986).

Third, due to the boundary spanning nature of SCM decisions,
decision makers need to consider various other functions and
departments within the ﬁrm (Swink et al. 2007). However,
because of potential limitations in experience, myopic perspec-
tives, and the limited availability of information, departmental
decision makers are often subject to bounded rationality (Galbra-
ith 1973). This means that their access, interpretations, and appli-
cations of information are bounded by the limits imposed by
organizational position, experience, and perspective. Internal inte-
gration serves to reduce and overcome bounded rationality, as it
enables a wider range of personnel to participate in joint evalua-
tions and planning for the use of knowledge content. In addition,
internal
integration promotes collaboration between functional
areas within the ﬁrm, thereby leading to greater goal alignment,
cross-fertilization,

alignment across functions through enhanced information shar-

functions can break down the “silo” mentality and local optimi-
zation, fostering a process view and enabling global optimization
(Lawrence and Lorsch 1967). Through internal integration, func-
tional specialists obtain a broader and more informed picture of
ﬁrm processes and objectives (Keller 2001), and are more likely
to understand and utilize ﬁrm resources located in different
departments.

internal

While these broad tenets are fairly well accepted, more rigor
and relevance is needed in the study of internal
integration,
speciﬁcally as it relates to performance. Appendix A provides a
summary of research studies that have speciﬁcally addressed
the effects of
integration on performance outcomes.
These foundational studies make important contributions to
knowledge in SCM (see the column “Findings” in Appen-
dix A). However, a readily apparent shortcoming in the body
of literature is the varying levels of focus and deﬁnition repre-
sented in operationalizations of internal integration. For exam-
ple, Stank et al. (1999) and Ellinger et al. (2000) study only
the integration of marketing and logistics, and Springinklee and
Wallenburg (2012) consider only the integration of the logistics
and the production functions, where other studies are broader
in the scopes of inter-departmental integration that they address.
Moreover, operationalizations of internal integration in some of
these studies assess the presence or absence of infrastructural
enablers of integration (e.g., presence of information systems)
(Gattiker and Goodhue 2004) rather than assessing levels of
achieved integration. Several researchers note the importance of
measuring achieved,
integration (Pagell
2004; Springinklee and Wallenburg 2012; Turkulainen and Ke-
tokivi 2012).

than intended,

in many studies,

Another limitation of prior works on internal

integration is
the frequent absence of a strong theoretical grounding for the
researchers’ expectations. Arguments relating internal
integra-
tion to performance are,
limited to restate-
ments of what
integration is, for example, alignment,
better communication and cooperation, richer information shar-
ing, more intense interactions, etc. Few statements are provided
that identify the means by which these attributes of integration
are linked to speciﬁc performance elements. Exceptions include
Wong et al. (2011) and Germain and Iyer (2006), who rely on
process-oriented views to argue for internal integration’s role in
the elimination of resource redundancies and nonvalue-added
activities. Others have highlighted the value of
information
access for improved decision making as an important beneﬁt of
internal integration (Stank et al. 1999; Germain and Iyer 2006).
Schoenherr and Swink (2012) employ IPT as a means for
explaining the information-driven beneﬁts of internal
integra-
tion. We extend these foregoing ideas, applying additional rigor
to the theoretical development of arguments tying internal inte-
gration to performance (van Weele and van Raaij 2014).

All of the studies described in Appendix A address relation-
ships of internal integration to some aspect of organizational per-
formance. However, it should be noted that the primary focus of
some studies is the indirect or moderating effect of internal inte-
gration on dimensions of operational performance (e.g., relative
cost, quality, etc.), rather than its potential direct effect on ﬁrm
proﬁtability (Narasimhan and Kim 2002; Germain and Iyer 2006;
Schoenherr and Swink 2012). Moreover, associations of internal
integration to immediate operational outcomes tend to be more
strongly represented in the literature than associations with ﬁnan-
cial performance. For instance, researchers have associated inter-
nal
integration with greater logistics performance (Stank et al.
1999, 2001b; Ellinger et al. 2000; Sanders and Premus 2005;
Germain and Iyer 2006), greater supply chain agility/responsive-
ness (Braunscheidel and Suresh 2009; Flynn et al. 2010), and
better quality, delivery, ﬂexibility and cost performance (Sanders
and Premus 2005; Wong et al. 2011; Schoenherr and Swink
2012).

Of the few studies that assessed the impact of internal integra-
tion on ﬁnancial performance, both signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁ-
cant relationships are evident (e.g., Rodrigues et al. 2004). While
Flynn et al. (2010) and Chen et al. (2007) ﬁnd a positive associ-
ation of internal integration with overall business performance
(an amalgam of sales, proﬁt, and growth indicators), associations
of internal integration with ﬁnancial measures are not signiﬁcant
in studies by Ellinger et al. (2000) and Germain and Iyer (2006).
One reason for these inconsistent results may be the studies’ use
of self-reported, perceptual ﬁnancial metrics measured on ordinal
or interval scales, often amalgamated into single factor scores.
Obtaining objective measures is difﬁcult, and the use of percep-
tual measures has been shown to be valid in many empirical
research settings. Nevertheless, perceptual measures of perfor-
mance are subject to certain biases, and they provide little basis
for concrete comparisons or projections of objectively measured
impacts (Ketokivi and Schroeder 2004; Wall et al. 2004). The
lack of evidence of direct ﬁnancial beneﬁts of internal integration
leaves open the opportunity to provide a more compelling case
for investments in internal integration.

A ﬁnal

indication of the nascent nature of research in this
area is that few contingencies regarding the effects of internal
integration have been identiﬁed. Several researchers have tested
interactions of internal integration with forms of external inte-
gration (Germain and Iyer 2006; Flynn et al. 2010; Schoenherr
and Swink 2012; Williams et al. 2013), and one study has
examined environmental uncertainty (Wong et al. 2011). How-
ever, ﬁrm structural characteristics that may amplify or dampen
the impacts of
integration have not been examined.
Such work is needed to establish boundary conditions on
expectations and developing theories related to internal integra-
tion.

internal

In sum, many research studies have addressed internal integra-
tion, offering foundational concepts and correlating managerial
perceptions of integration and performance. To add relevance
and rigor to the study of internal integration, we build upon these
works to offer a more theoretically grounded set of arguments,
and to address some of their limitations. Namely, we investigate
the impacts of achieved integration on objectively measured
aspects of ﬁnancial performance (proﬁtability, process efﬁciency,

and asset productivity), utilizing secondary data sources. In addi-
tion, we test the moderating effect of a ﬁrm’s supply chain pro-
cess span, in order to develop further insights into the nature and
limits of integration’s effects.

THEORY DEVELOPMENT AND HYPOTHESES

Rapid change has become the norm in today’s business envi-
ronment. As a result, companies face increasing levels of
uncertainty (Weick and Quinn 1999; Merschmann and Thone-
mann 2011). The IPT suggests that high levels of uncertainty
can be managed through buffers (e.g., slack capacity,
inven-
tory) or through enhanced information processing capabilities
(Galbraith 1973). Accordingly, we

the most appropriate internal constituents,
thereby enabling

Galbraith (1974) speciﬁcally refers to the power of “integrating
roles” in this regard. More integrated decision making regard-
ing resource applications and process planning is expected to
positively impact a ﬁrm’s proﬁtability, which is often opera-
tionalized as ROA.

Internal

More speciﬁcally, achieved internal integration improves inter-
faces between internal functions, leading to enhanced communi-
cation, coordination and collaboration (Pagell 2004). According
to Galbraith (1973), internal integration is achieved through lat-
eral relations and vertical information systems; examples include
team-oriented structures, cross-functional planning processes,
rotational job assignments, liaison roles, and integrated informa-
tion systems (Stevens 1989; Gattiker and Goodhue 2004). In
describing IPT, Galbraith (1973) maintains that such lateral rela-
tions and vertical information systems work together to enhance
the information processing capacity of the organization. Given
this capacity,
information travels faster and more accurately
through internally integrated processes, enabling greater agility
and ensuing adaptation of strategy (Galbraith 1974). Addition-
reductions in equivocality and bounded rationality can
ally,
enhance visibility and inter-departmental
interactions aimed at
rationalizing redundant resources and duplications of effort. Inter-
nal integration may further foster unique relationships between
individuals in the ﬁrm, going beyond simple or mechanistic con-
nections. In an ideal setting, a community is created to share,
combine and integrate functional expertise (Rosenzweig et al.
2003).

These information processing and collaborative beneﬁts of
achieved internal integration, as expressed in the IPT, explain
why we expect
integration to be associated with greater ﬁrm
proﬁtability. Such integration is complex, difﬁcult, and requires
considerable time, effort,
trust and conviction (Ellinger et al.
2006; Richey et al. 2010). The rare ﬁrms that are able to achieve
high levels of internal integration are expected to enjoy signiﬁ-
cant proﬁtability advantages by virtue of their superior informa-
tion processing capacities.

The foregoing hypothesis posits a high level

relationship
between internal integration and ﬁrm proﬁtability (ROA). To add
further
relationships
between internal integration and two key components of proﬁt-
ability, process efﬁciency and asset productivity. These compo-
nents of proﬁtability are typically measured by return-on-sales
(ROS) and asset
respectively (Kinney and
Wempe 2002).1 We ﬁrst focus on ROS, which is regarded as a
gauge of a ﬁrm’s efﬁciency (Income/Sales) (Kinney and Wempe
2002). For a given level of sales, ROS is improved by making
processes more efﬁcient in ways that serve to lower various cost
elements,
including costs of goods sold (COGS) and SG&A
costs; these two cost categories often represent the majority of a
ﬁrm’s operating costs, and as such, they have been studied inten-
sely (Levesque et al. 2012).

turnover

(ATO),

Consistent with tenets of IPT, we expect that the information
integration lead to
processing capabilities afforded by internal
greater process efﬁciencies. Speciﬁcally, a central
trade-off in
organizational design involves the beneﬁts of specialization and
local responsiveness in divisionalized forms, versus the beneﬁts
of control, standardization, and efﬁciency in centralized forms
(Galbraith 1973). Internal integration, however, provides mecha-
nisms to afford efﬁciencies through greater
immediacy and
breadth of information processing, while preserving some degree
of departmental specialization and autonomy (Chen et al. 2007).
Integration mechanisms serve to automate or eliminate cross-
departmental
transactions and data translations, and similarly
reduce other process “wastes” associated with functional silos
(Swink et al. 2007); for example, both planning and execution
processes involving various stakeholders can be streamlined. As
a result we expect reductions in overhead costs associated with
the management of inter-departmental communications and indi-
rect costs associated with planning and coordination. In addition,
we expect that direct costs of execution will be lowered by inter-
nal integration through a higher quality of planning. For exam-
ple, more
and
operations planning) foster more complete goal alignment and
more global resource optimization, leading to lower processing
costs. Thus, internal integration should yield greater process efﬁ-
ciencies (ROS) as reﬂected in COGS and SG&A.

(e.g.,

sales

In addition, a central tenet of IPT is that information process-
ing capacity is necessitated by uncertainty and interdependence,
which work together to create “unexpected events” and “excep-
tion scenarios” (Galbraith 1973). An organization can invest in
slack resources to buffer itself against these incidents. However,
it is often better off when it uses lateral and vertical mechanisms
to reduce uncertainty and to rationalize interdependencies, thus
preventing unexpected problems that require work-arounds (Gal-
braith 1974). For example, communication of, and commitment
to, a single plan (as opposed to independently developed depart-
mental plans) should lead to more internally consistent and syn-
chronized actions (e.g., purchases and production schedules),
thereby eliminating process costs associated with responses to

unexpected events (Sheremata 2000). Such costs include expedit-
ing, rework, costs associated with raising and lowering resource
capacities, and other transition costs. Global, integrated optimiza-
tion also promotes balance across decisions made in departments
with incompatible metrics and goals. For example, production
functions typically pursue large batch schedules and low invento-
ries, while logistics functions emphasize small batches and high
service levels (Pyke and Cohen 1993; Arshinder and Deshmukh
2008). We posit that internal integration enables information pro-
cessing required to balance such competing objectives. In these
ways, internal integration should lead to greater process efﬁcien-
cies.

H2: Internal integration is positively associated with

process efﬁciency (ROS).

In contrast to ROS, ATO is regarded as an indicator of pro-
ductivity (Kinney and Wempe 2002). As such, ATO is improved
by more productive uses of assets, both current assets (e.g., cash,
inventory) and ﬁxed assets (e.g., plant, property, and equipment).
ATO is essentially an output-over-input productivity measure
(Sales/Assets). We suggest
integration enables
improved utilization of both current and ﬁxed assets, thus pro-
ducing greater ATO.

Our arguments are founded in IPT’s premise that internal inte-

1974). Through
improved planning processes and greater coordination of depart-
mental plans and actions, internal integration likely lowers the
need for asset buffers such as cash and inventory (Swink et al.
2007). For example, we suggest
joint
planning and coordination should lead to less volatile cash ﬂows
in purchases, as well as less uncertainty in both demand and sup-
ply. Hence, safety stocks of cash and product inventories could
then be reduced. Fewer current assets (cash and inventory) would
be needed to hedge against uncertainties, poor or incomplete
planning, forecast errors, and so on. In essence, enhanced visibil-
ity and associated ability to better plan and forecast via internal
integration is exchanged for inventory (cf. Wang and Wei 2007).
According to the tenets of IPT, this is accomplished via effective
information processing and sense-making that occurs via internal
integration.

that cross-departmental

In the same way, we suggest

that more complete planning
made possible through internal integration should produce pro-
duction and logistics schedules that allow asset managers to more
fully utilize existing ﬁxed assets. Consistent with IPT, faster,
more complete, and more accurate information processing capac-
ity gives asset managers more advanced notice of the need to
scale asset resources up or down (cf. Wang and Wei 2007), lead-
ing to better overall utilization over time. Better decision making
is enabled by a reduction in bounded rationality achieved via
internal integration—a better mutual understanding and compre-
hension can be accomplished (Sheremata 2000). Internal integra-
tion also gives asset managers a voice in demand and supply
planning, thereby enabling them to veto or modify decisions that
would lead to rapid shocks or other volatilities that create
extreme loads on productive assets. In these ways, internal inte-
gration provides for creativity and coordination mechanisms

(Galbraith 1974) that should lessen the need for buffer capacity,
and lead to higher levels of asset productivity.

H3: Internal integration is positively associated with asset

productivity (ATO).

internal

According to the above arguments,

integration pro-
vides greater connectivity and coordination across ﬁrm functions
(Galbraith 1974). We would expect that these beneﬁts are more
important in organizations that comprise greater levels of supply
chain process span. Akin to the notion of vertical integration,
process span reﬂects the breadth and diversity of business activi-
ties conducted by a ﬁrm (Swink and Way 1995). From a supply
chain perspective, process span is evident in the breadth of sup-
ply chain activities (i.e., manufacturing, distribution, retailing) in
which the ﬁrm is engaged. Since the internal organizations of
ﬁrms with greater process span include a broader mix of dispa-
rate business activities and associated functional perspectives
(Swink and Way 1995), we suggest that the potential beneﬁt of
internal integration is greater in these settings.

Our argument is grounded in IPT’s notion that internal inte-
gration is motivated by the desire to reduce bounded rationality
(Bergh 1998). Personnel who work in different functions occupy
different thought worlds, pursue different objectives, and have
different priorities. They are boundedly rational
(Williamson
1985), meaning they have biased preferences, and they lack full
information when making decisions. Personnel occupying more
disparate business activities are likely to have more disparate
scopes of rationality. For instance, managers of retail operations
have different perspectives than managers of manufacturing oper-
ations. Since internal integration enables an organization to better
synthesize information, put it into context, and facilitate more
comprehensive decision-making,
it works to reduce bounded
rationality (Alexander 1991).

Several researchers point to internal integration as a remedy
the bounded rationality of organizational actors in ﬁrms
for
whose operations encompass broad sets of processes (Chikan
2001; Schoenherr and Swink 2012). For example, Chikan (2001)

decreasing internal
transaction costs associated with managing
diverse, interdependent functions. Pagell (2004) argues that, by
improving information ﬂows, collaborations, and awareness of
functional interdependencies and biases, internal integration fos-
ters better intra-ﬁrm, cross-functional goal alignment and better
utilization of each function’s strengths and competencies. Consis-
tent with IPT, the “processing” of information is enhanced.

Our rationale is further grounded in the belief that, in a con-
text where one can inﬂuence more value-adding processes (i.e.
with greater process span), the beneﬁts of internal integration for
greater performance are magniﬁed (since much more can be pos-
itively effectuated by enhanced visibility and coordination made
possible via internal integration). A greater breadth of activities
is integrated, and associated information is shared, enhancing the
decision making capabilities of supply chain managers,
likely
yielding better performance. Parallels can be found in prior
research that has associated a greater span of control with an
increase in the volume of decision inputs (Melnyk et al. 2004).
Support is also provided by studies that have postulate the bene-
ﬁts of integration between marketing and logistics (Chen et al.

tura 2005).

Finally, a ﬁrm that controls a variety of supply chain activities
may be more prone to divisionalize tasks (e.g., have the manu-
facturing function separate from the distribution function). We
expect that, in environments characterized by wider process span,
the potential derived via internal integration is magniﬁed, due to
the ability to beneﬁcially impact many more functions and con-
stituents. A shared understanding can be developed across the
functions, and task coordination can be enhanced (Stank et al.
1999). Such information processing capacity can even break
down the “silo” mentality and reduce tendencies for local optimi-
zation,
thus enabling more global optimization (Lawrence and
Lorsch 1967). Through internal integration, functional specialists
obtain a broader and more informed picture of ﬁrm processes
and objectives (Keller 2001), and are more likely to understand
and utilize ﬁrm resources located in different departments (these
represent key beneﬁts postulated by IPT). Accordingly, we
expect
integration are magniﬁed
when a ﬁrm’s activities span a broader set of supply chain opera-
tional processes.

METHODOLOGY

Data collection and sample

The foregoing hypotheses are tested by making use of both pri-
mary and secondary data sources. We analyze primary data col-
lected in multiple rounds of the Global Survey of Supply Chain
Progress, administered in 2007, 2008, and 2011 (surveys con-
ducted in other years did not include internal integration vari-
ables). These surveys were co-sponsored by the authors,
the
Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, Computer
Science Corporation, and the magazines Supply Chain Manage-
ment Review and Supply Chain Europe. In addition, we matched
the survey data with the ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial records found in COM-
PUSTAT, a database containing ﬁnancial information on publicly
traded ﬁrms.

Survey invitations were sent to supply chain executives and
managers in procurement, operations, and logistics functions
drawn from readers of the Supply Chain Management Review,
clients of the Computer Sciences Corporation’s supply chain
consulting division, and a list of former participants of supply
chain executive education programs at a large Midwestern uni-
versity. The survey was further advertised on the journal and
participating corporate websites. A total of 609 usable responses
were received, 141 for 2007, 262 for 2008, and 206 for 2011.

Survey respondents’ ﬁrms were matched to their ﬁnancial
records in COMPUSTAT. The availability of data was limited
due to the fact that some of the survey respondents did not pro-
vide company name information, and many were from privately
held and/or non-U.S. ﬁrms. Nevertheless, a total of 115 respon-

dents could successfully be matched to their ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial
records. The distribution of records across the three years of data
collection is 30 unique companies from 2007, 32 unique compa-
nies from 2008, and 47 unique companies from 2011. Six com-
panies were represented in more than one year; we averaged the
responses for these six observations.

Overall, the sampled ﬁrms represent many different industries;
the largest categories include process manufacturing (13.9%),
consumer goods (10.4%), discrete manufacturing (11.3%), and
retail (13.9%). A total of 73.0% of the ﬁrms were involved in
manufacturing, 32.2% were involved in retail, and 73.9% were
involved in distribution. All respondent ﬁrms were involved in at
least one of these three supply chain activities, and 39.1% also
identiﬁed additional business activities in which they were
engaged (e.g., services, research and development/design). The
sample includes a wide range of ﬁrm sizes; annual sales ranged
from $12M to $393B. Quartile cutoffs were $2.1B, $7.9B, and
$24.9B, respectively.

Respondents to the survey were supply chain executives
embedded in ﬁrms located throughout the world. Based on the
key informant approach, we screened the responses and elimi-
nated informants whose titles were not directly related to a sup-
ply chain function (Wall et al. 2004). We obtained responses
from individuals holding a range of managerial positions, includ-
ing executive managers (C-level executive, Executive Vice Presi-
dent, Senior Vice President, and Vice President—29.6%), upper
managers (Senior Director, Director, Head—36.5%), managers
(Senior Manager, Manager—24.3%), and various other positions
(Analyst, Buyer, Planner, Specialist—9.6%). This distribution
indicates that a large majority of respondents (90.4%) held a rank
of manager or higher, suggesting that they have relevant knowl-
edge regarding the survey content.

Based on the survey design,

the total number of contacted
potential respondents who met our criteria is unknown, making
the calculation of a response rate not possible. Therefore, we
used respondent data and general industry information to assess
response biases and sample representativeness. Speciﬁcally, in a
ﬁrst test we compared the mean ROA values of the sampled
ﬁrms with their respective industry median values; the difference
was not statistically signiﬁcant (p = .474). In a second test we
assessed differences in the responses for all measurement items
across early (ﬁrst 25%) and late respondents (last 25%) in each
survey (Armstrong and Overton 1977). Again, none of the differ-
ences were statistically signiﬁcant. Hence, we conclude that non-
response bias is not a serious concern.

Measures

Measures for internal integration were collected via the survey.
Our work focuses on the role of internal integration in managing
on-going supply chain planning and execution; we therefore omit
integration efforts related to product development and technology
innovation (e.g., Handﬁeld et al. 1999; Dr€oge et al. 2004; Kouft-
eros et al. 2005, 2010; Narasimhan et al. 2010). The items for
our study, which were adapted from prior research (Narasimhan
and Kim 2002; Koufteros et al. 2005), assess the extent to which
intra-ﬁrm functional teams (operations, logistics, sales, market-
ing, supply management) work together to accomplish supply
chain planning and execution (Schoenherr and Swink 2012). As


Effects of Cross-Functional Integration

they tap directly into the underlying notions of IPT as
such,
articulated by Galbraith (1973, 1974). Respondents were pre-
sented with a set of statements to which they were asked to indi-
cate their degree of agreement on a 5-point Likert
scale
(Appendix B).

To measure supply chain process span, the surveys assessed
the simultaneous ownership of several SCM activities, including
manufacturing, distribution, and retail (Stearns et al. 1995). We
asked respondents to indicate whether manufacturing, distribu-
tion, and retail activities, respectively, were conducted by the
ﬁrm. We computed a process span score of 1, 2, or 3 based on
the number of activities conducted by the ﬁrm.

For the dependent variables, we computed ROA, ROS, and
ATO values using data supplied by the COMPUSTAT database.
ROA is calculated as operating income (Sales—COGS—SG&A
expense) divided by total net assets. Note that we ignored
expenses such as taxes, depreciation, and extraordinary items in
order to assess operating performance more directly, and to limit
the possibility of outliers due to extraneous causes (Hendricks and
Singhal 1997). ROS is calculated as operating income divided by
sales. ATO is calculated as sales divided by total net assets. In
order to explore the components of these performance ratios, we
also computed gross margin (GM = 1—COGS/Sales), the margin
for selling, general and administrative expenses (SGAM = 1—
(CAT = Sales/Current
SG&A/Sales),
Assets), and the plant, property, and equipment proportion of ﬁxed
asset turns (PPET = Sales/Net Plant, Property, and Equipment). In
order to account for variances in these measures over time, we
computed an average for each of the performance scores for
each respondent over two years, the year of the survey and the
immediate subsequent year. Averaging over
two years helps
smooth out some of the variance in performance due to general
economic conditions in any given year. To control for industry
differences, we adjusted each of the dependent variable scores
for each company by subtracting the median value of each variable
for all the companies listed in the sample company’s industry
(three-digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation). Thus, adjusted
ROAi = ROAi   ROAmedian.

turnover

current

asset

In addition to these primary variables, several control vari-
ables were collected, via both the survey and the COMPU-
STAT database. To control for ﬁrm size and time frame of the
data, we included the log-transformed sales of the company,
and two dummy variables indicating the year in which the sur-
vey was conducted. To control for halo effects, we included a
survey question asking the respondent to indicate his/her ﬁrm’s
overall level of supply chain competence, relative to other ﬁrms
in the industry. In addition, we included a three-item scale ask-
ing respondents to indicate their ﬁrm’s usage level of informa-
tion technologies
these
factors helps to separate the effects of achieved internal integra-
tion from respondents’ overall positive feelings about the orga-
nization, and from the effects of
supporting infrastructural
technologies.

(see Appendix B). Controlling for

To further isolate the contribution of internal integration from
extraneous effects, we controlled for supplier integration and cus-
tomer integration (Flynn et al. 2010). Supplier integration refers
to coordination and information sharing activities with key sup-
pliers, leading to, for instance, more effective planning and fore-
casting (Bowersox et al. 1999; Ragatz et al. 2002). Customer

integration is deﬁned as close collaboration and information shar-
ing with key customers, yielding strategic insight
into market
expectations and enabling a more efﬁcient and effective response
to customer needs (Swink et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2011). Items
for supplier and customer integration were adapted from prior
research (Koufteros et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Swink et al.
2007), and assessed the degree to which more involved, synchro-
nized and proactive relationships are sought with suppliers or
customers (Schoenherr and Swink 2012). These two variables
were included only in the 2007 and 2008 surveys.

Finally, we recognized the potential mismatch between the
reporting units for the surveys and for the ﬁnancial data. The
ﬁnancial data represent performance for the entire ﬁrm, whereas
survey respondents may have given information pertaining to all
or only a part of the ﬁrm. To control for this effect, we included
a question asking the respondent to indicate the organizational
level that his/her responses represented (see Appendix B). This
question, which we used as a control variable in a robustness
test, was included only in the 2007 and 2008 surveys.

Validity and reliability of the multi-item scales were assessed
via approaches suggested by Anderson and Gerbing (1988). Spe-
ciﬁcally, the adaptation of the measurement items from extant
research, and their subsequent reﬁnement with academics and
industry professionals, ensured content validity. The coefﬁcients
estimated from the sample data loaded signiﬁcantly on their
underlying construct, being indicative of convergent validity
(Table 1). Discriminant validity was established by the square-
roots of the average variance extracted (AVE) being greater than
the corresponding correlations. Reliability was provided by satis-
factory Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values. A
composite score was computed for each factor by averaging the
scores of the factor items. Summary statistics and correlations
are provided in Table 2.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

We use ordinary least squares regression analyses to test our
hypotheses. Table 3 summarizes the results for the regression
models. For each dependent variable, three regression models are
presented: model 1 includes the control variables, model 2 adds
the main effects of process span and internal integration, and
model 3 adds the interaction between process span and internal
integration. We remind the reader that all dependent variables
have been adjusted by subtracting industry median values in
order to control for extraneous industry effects.

Hypothesis tests

H1 suggests that internal integration is positively associated with
ROA. In model ROA2, the standardized beta coefﬁcient of internal
integration is positive and highly signiﬁcant (b = .330, p < .01),
providing strong support for H1. Regarding the control variables,
only the survey year dummy variables are signiﬁcant, being posi-
tively associated with ROA. The R-squared for the model
is
20.4%. We consider this amount of explained variance to be sub-
stantial, especially given the wide number of potential contributors
to overall ﬁrm proﬁtability. In addition, the F-value indicates that
the model is highly signiﬁcant.

H2 suggests a positive and signiﬁcant

inﬂuence of internal
integration on ROS, which represents the efﬁciency aspect of
overall ﬁrm performance. The results provide support for H2, as
the coefﬁcient in model ROS2 is signiﬁcant (b = .263, p < .05).
As before, the survey year dummies are the only control vari-
ables that are signiﬁcant
in the ROS models. The R-squared
value for the ROS2 model is 14.1% (again a substantial amount
of explained variance) and the F-value indicates that the model
is signiﬁcant.

H3 posits a positive inﬂuence of internal integration on pro-
ductivity, as measured by ATO. This relationship is not sup-
ported by our data (b = .072, ns). While the R-squared value for
the ATO2 model is 9.7% (driven by the time frame control vari-
able for 2008), the F-values indicate that the model is not statis-
tically signiﬁcant.

H4a–c state that supply chain process span positively moder-
ates the effects of internal integration on each of the foregoing
performance variables, respectively. Model ROA3 in Table 3
shows that the interaction of process span and internal integration
is positive and signiﬁcant (b = .210, p < .05), thus supporting
H4a. The model also experienced a signiﬁcant increase in vari-
ance explained, with the R-squared value of ROA3 being 24.5%.
The comparable coefﬁcients in models ROS3 and ATO3 are not
signiﬁcant, and provide no support for H4b and H4c (variance
explained did not improve for both models, and was at 15.0%
and 11.2%, respectively).

Exploratory tests of associations with components of
efﬁciency and productivity

To bring further insight into how internal integration might affect
the underlying process structures that drive ROS and ATO, we
assessed the inﬂuence of internal integration on their major com-
ponents. For ROS,
these components include mid-level proﬁt
measures addressing two major cost/expense categories, GM

sures of cost efﬁciency. Interestingly,
the results indicate that
internal integration is signiﬁcantly associated with improved GM

positive only for SGAM (see model SGAM3).

Robustness test

As a robustness check of the ﬁndings against possible confounds
and sampling issues, we repeated the regression analyses for

adjusted ROA,
this time adding three additional control vari-
ables. Some ﬁrms may pursue multiple integration efforts simul-
taneously. Accordingly, we added controls for customer and
supplier integration. As mentioned in the Methodology section
above, we also recognized the possibility of reporting effects due
to mismatches between the unit
for which the respondents
reported and the unit for which ﬁnancial data were available. To
address this issue, we included the control variable for organiza-
tional reporting level. Data for these control variables were only
available in the 2007 and 2008 surveys, so the analyses are lim-
ited to those samples. However, the test using this subset of the
data allows a check of the robustness of the results to sampling
issues.

Table 6 shows the regression results. None of the additional
control variables are signiﬁcant. However, the main and interac-
tion effects of
integration on adjusted ROA remain
strongly signiﬁcant. These ﬁndings suggest that the support for
the hypotheses is robust to the identiﬁed issues.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

We designed this study to extend prior research and practice per-
taining to internal integration. While the importance of internal
integration is largely unquestioned, much scholarly work on
internal integration has been descriptive, has offered limited theo-
retical development, and has failed to provide strong evidence
for the relationship between internal
integration and proﬁt. In
addition, managers feel that actual practice has much room for
improvement (Poirier et al. 2008). Within this context, we add
rigor and relevance to the study of internal integration by mea-
suring achieved internal
integration, by deeply grounding our
expectations in IPT, by investigating the direct effect of internal
integration on performance using objectively reported ﬁnancial
metrics, and by studying the contingency of supply chain process

span. Two of our hypotheses are supported, one is partially sup-
ported, and one failed to receive support. The insights from these
ﬁndings, as described below, provide intriguing implications for
the applicability of IPT to the study of internal integration. Of
particular interest is the differentiated impact of internal integra-
tion on various ﬁnancial performance measures, enabling us to
propose a more speciﬁc theory of internal integration through the
lens of IPT.

Grounding our expectations in IPT, we ﬁrst theorized the posi-
tive association of internal
integration with proﬁtability, mea-
sured by ROA (H1). The data strongly support this hypothesis,
consistent with the assertion that enhanced information process-
ing capabilities are provided by internal
integration (Galbraith
1973). Internal integration is achieved when supporting organiza-
tional infrastructures and processes enable the effective and accu-
rate processing of information,
including its dissemination to
appropriate constituents within the ﬁrm. This enhances visibility,
reduces uncertainty, and enables effective decision making. Inte-
gration mechanisms, such as the use of teams, also provide for
give-and-take discussions of new information; thus clariﬁcations
can be made, equivocality can be addressed, and bounded ratio-
nality can be overcome. Through processing information in these
ways, more comprehensive situation assessments can be made,
better deployments of resources can be initiated, functional goals
and plans can be better aligned, and redundancies and uncer-
tainty buffers can be reduced. In these ways, proﬁtability (ROA)
can be increased.

In order to add rigor and relevance to the investigation of
internal
integration’s impact on ROA, we sought additional
insight into the ﬁnancial evidence for the various beneﬁts iden-
tiﬁed above. Accordingly, we independently theorized and
tested the positive association of
integration with
ROA’s components: ROS (H2, process efﬁciency) and ATO
(H3, asset productivity). The support for our second hypothesis
suggests that internal integration produces greater planning and
process efﬁciencies, as evidenced by higher levels of ROS. In-
frastructural mechanisms afforded by internal
integration can
streamline, improve, and potentially automate information ﬂows,

thus lowering direct costs. In contrast,

Our ﬁne-grained analyses provide evidence of

integration
beneﬁts for both direct and indirect cost elements, as reﬂected
in higher GM and SGAM, respectively. The GM ﬁnding dem-
onstrates the positive inﬂuence of internal
integration on the
percent of total sales revenue the ﬁrm retains after considering
all COGS. This comports well with the efﬁciency arguments
founded in IPT; internal integration offers information process-
ing mechanisms that enable the ﬁrm to operate more efﬁ-
ciently,
the efﬁciency
effects of internal
integration on SGAM appear to be signiﬁ-
cant only for ﬁrms that operate broader sets of supply chain
business processes. From an IPT perspective, this again makes
sense; where GM is primarily a measure of the efﬁciency in
the usage of direct
resources (material purchases and direct
labor expenses), SGAM reﬂects efﬁciencies in indirect pro-
cesses, including the management of transactions, coordination
costs, overhead costs, and indirect labor costs. It seems sensi-
ble under an IPT perspective that indirect costs are raised by
the number of different business processes that the ﬁrm man-
ages, as the number and breadth of uncertainties are raised,
and the potential
for competing functional biases (bounded
rationality) is heightened. Information processing capacity pro-
vided by internal
integration is therefore likely to be more
important
in broad-span ﬁrms, as a means to manage these
added challenges.

Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that, for ﬁrms with both
narrow and wide scopes of process span, operating process efﬁ-
ciencies gained through internal integration apply to direct cost
savings in areas of purchase costs, direct labor costs, logistics
costs directly attributable to speciﬁc products, and other elements
of COGS. The IPT perspective suggests that these direct cost
savings reﬂect greater process efﬁciencies from more accurate,
consistent, and synchronized actions across procurement, produc-
tion, and delivery. However, ﬁrms that engage in wider sets of
business activities might also expect to see beneﬁts from internal
integration in areas of indirect costs, which include corporate
overheads, managerial salaries, systems costs, and other elements
of SG&A. Greater information processing capacity is thought to
make the transactional and coordination processes that absorb
these types of costs more efﬁcient. The importance of our contri-
bution lies in the conﬁrmation of the logical arguments devel-
oped and grounded in IPT, offering a level of theorizing that
delves deeper into the underlying rationales. Speciﬁcally, we
have identiﬁed an important boundary condition pertaining to the
applicability of IPT. Beneﬁts derived from information process-
ing capabilities materialize in greater SGAM only among ﬁrms
with greater process span, due to their need to coordinate across
a broader mix of functions.

internal

Our ﬁndings for process efﬁciency gains are in line with fore-
going researchers that have suggested the boundary-spanning nat-
ure of
integration improving the interface between
functions (e.g., Swink et al. 2007; Schoenherr and Swink 2012).
The IPT suggests that this can be accomplished through the use
of speciﬁc rules and programs, or by creating lateral relations
through teams,
liaison roles, and social networks (Galbraith
1974). The formal nature of such structures enables the sharing
of information across functional boundaries, while at the same

independence. All

interactions and data
ﬂows can be streamlined, reducing organizational redundancy
and duplication of effort. Increased visibility in company pro-
cesses and available information enables more cohesive and
coordinated decision making, and better planning, reducing non-
value-added activities. The cumulative effect of associated efﬁ-
ciency gains across affected processes is to lower operating costs,
and thus improve ROS.

Our third hypothesis, which theorized the effect of internal
integration on asset productivity, is not supported by the data.
This is true for the ATO measure, as well as for the underlying
productivity elements that we explored, that is, CAT and PPET.
We based our expectations on the IPT-inspired argument
that
more integrated planning processes should lower the need for
buffer assets, and also enable higher levels of asset utilization
(Narasimhan and Kim 2002; Rodrigues et al. 2004; Wong et al.
2011). An explanation for the lack of a signiﬁcant ﬁnding may
be that structural changes to physical assets are necessary to
effectuate asset productivity improvements, and managers are
either reluctant to make these changes, or are unaware that they
can do so. For example, changes to plant, property, and equip-
ment are not made easily or quickly, they typically occur in large
chunks, and they take time to ramp up. While managers may
observe steady, incremental improvements to direct and indirect
costs as internal integration grows and planning improves, they
may ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to implement step-function changes to
physical capacity needed to attain capital cost improvements. We
might expect that changes to current asset levels (inventories and
cash) would be easier to make, yet opportunities for lowering
such buffer assets might go unrecognized. Policy changes in
these areas might also be resisted by personnel (e.g., marketing
in the case of inventory, and ﬁnance in the case of cash) who
view the changes as risky, especially if drops in uncertainty lev-
els are not readily apparent. Overall, costs of capital are not as
visible as costs of labor and materials, and so improvements to
asset productivity may lag more transparent
improvements to
process efﬁciencies. It would be interesting for future research to
examine our speculations regarding these effects. The larger
implication that should be examined in future research is that
internal integration beneﬁts appear to apply more towards efﬁ-
ciency gains,
than toward asset-oriented productivity
gains.

rather

Our fourth hypothesis received mixed support. While supply
chain process span positively moderated the relationship between
internal integration and ROA, the moderation effect was signiﬁ-
cant for none of the more speciﬁc cost elements, except for
SGAM. As we explained above, the moderation effect of process
span makes good sense as it pertains to SG&A processes, as
these are the indirect and overhead processes that must often
consolidate and rationalize inputs from varied business functions.
It
is not possible to determine whether these SGAM beneﬁts
account for all of the signiﬁcant moderating effect at the ROA
level, or if other small effects in other cost categories also accu-
mulate to drive the signiﬁcant ROA result. We can say that the
impacts of process span seem to be most salient in the elements
associated with SG&A.

Our post hoc analysis provides another

interesting result.
While the effects of internal integration remain signiﬁcant and
substantial, effects of external integration appear to be mostly
non-signiﬁcant (at least in the subset of data for which we had
measures of external
integration). The apparent differences in
effects of internal versus external integration uncovered in this
study suggest the need for future research to make comparative
examinations of
the independent and potentially interacting
effects of different integration efforts on ﬁnancial performance.

Signiﬁcant variation in the levels of achieved integration rep-
resented in our sample suggests that integration opportunities are
often either ignored or are difﬁcult to achieve. This is in line
with recent studies that argued for internal integration requiring
signiﬁcant organizational commitment (Ellinger et al. 2006; Ri-
chey et al. 2010). As such, our ﬁnding solidiﬁes the potential for
internal integration as a distinctive source of advantage.

From a meta-theoretical perspective, our study adds both rigor
and relevance to prior research that has investigated the inﬂuence
of internal integration on performance. Most importantly, prior
studies have consistently employed only perceptual measures of
performance, collected via surveys (van der Vaart and van Donk
2008; see Appendix A for empirical studies). For example,
respondents were asked to indicate whether they judged their
performance as being above or below the industry average (e.g.,
Germain and Iyer 2006). We complement this inherently subjec-
tive measure in the present research by objective ﬁnancial data
from ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial records. To the best of our knowledge, the

present research is the ﬁrst to utilize externally-collected perfor-
mance measures to assess the impact of integration. This contri-
bution provides empirical corroboration of a concept considered
fundamental to SCM, and thus adds rigor to the investigation of
internal integration and its effect on performance. As noted by
Douglas and Craig (2005) and van Weele and van Raaij (2014),
replicatory studies aimed at validating theory in different con-
texts are essential for ascertaining the predictive validity and gen-
eralizability of
for ensuring rigor and
relevance. From an even broader perspective, our research con-
tributes to the scarce but emerging research in logistics and SCM
that considers proﬁt measures drawn from external databases
(Melnyk et al. 2004; Ellinger et al. 2011), alleviating concerns
pertaining to common method bias.

theory, as well as

the lack thereof)

This study also calls attention to the variety of theoretical
lenses (or
that have been drawn upon to
develop expectations and explicate ﬁndings pertaining to internal
integration. Such theoretical diversity can be useful, yet much of
the foregoing theory is limited in that it addresses integration
effects only vaguely and at rather high levels. Our study provides
more concrete logical arguments that apply IPT to potential efﬁ-
ciencies and productivities. Moreover, we use this theoretical
lens to formulate speciﬁc hypotheses regarding process efﬁciency
and asset productivity, as well as the moderating role of supply
chain process span. Prior studies have not addressed performance
effects at
this level of speciﬁcity, nor have they tested such
effects using unambiguous ﬁnancial data. In Table 7, we provide

more speciﬁc calls to action for managers and future research
opportunities for academics, derived from our ﬁndings.

From a practical perspective, we provide evidence for the sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnancial value of internal integration, and offer motiva-
tion for practitioners to pursue such efforts. We clariﬁed this link
with commonly-accepted ﬁnancial metrics, as called for by Ellin-
ger et al. (2011). The backing of integration beneﬁts by quantiﬁ-
able results should help practitioners in making the case for the
importance of internal
integration. The lack of such evidence
may explain, at least in part, deﬁciencies in internal integration
perceived by managers (Poirier et al. 2008).

Our results suggest that the potential effects of internal inte-
gration are quite substantial. The data indicate that a ﬁrm that
has a level of internal integration one standard deviation higher
than other ﬁrms enjoys a 6.7 percentage points larger GM, an
8.2 points larger ROS, and a 5.7 points larger ROA. These val-
ues represent 25%, 76%, and 57% improvements over the sam-
ple average values of these proﬁtability metrics, respectively.
Hence, our results suggest
that considerable improvements in
proﬁts can come from greater internal integration. The promise
of such gains should offer further motivation for managers to
pursue process efﬁciencies from related investments.

Our ﬁndings serve as a call to managers, especially to those
who already “believe” in the value of internal integration, but
who lack company support for implementation of the necessary
organizational and technological changes. Our study provides
hard evidence for the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of internal integration.
In addition, our ﬁndings suggest that managers should look, at
least initially, for improvements in direct process costs (COGS)
as a result of internal integration, and recognize that asset pro-
ductivities and associated capital cost
improvements may take
longer to materialize, if at all. Accordingly, we would expect
improvements to show up on the income statement more than
on the balance sheet. Because the creation of integration struc-
tures (relationships and systems) mainly affects intangible fac-
tors
(information ﬂows, planning, decision making, cross-
functional relations), managers will need to make measurements
of
tracking improvements in
cost outcomes, but also evaluating changes in the quality of
planning and collaboration across functions. We suggest
that
both types of measures are needed in order to build an appre-
ciation of
integration’s full effects, and to estimate its true
return on investment. We thus issue a call to be persistent in
the pursuit of

CONCLUSION

internal

Most scholarly work in the domain of internal integration has
been descriptive and theoretically underdeveloped (Frankel and
Mollenkopf 2013). In addition, no previous research has utilized
externally collected ﬁnancial data to assess the impact of integra-
tion. Furthermore, while supply chain managers perceive their
companies to have reached proﬁcient levels of external integra-
tion, this is not the case for internal integration (Poirier et al.
2008). We have aimed to overcome limitations
in extant
research, and have answered the question of whether internal
integration concretely affects ﬁnancial performance. Our hypoth-
eses on the effects of internal integration on performance metrics
are grounded in IPT. Accordingly, we theorized and conﬁrmed
the positive inﬂuence of
integration on proﬁtability
(ROA) and related process efﬁciencies (ROS, GM, and SGAM).
This corroborates expectations inherent
to IPT, and provides
practical motivation for managers. However, our arguments asso-
ciating internal integration with improved asset productivity are
not supported. We provided possible explanations for this result.
Although this research signiﬁcantly advances the rigor and rele-
vance of internal integration research within the logistics and SCM
domain, its contributions are tempered by its limitations, which
also provide opportunities for future research. First, our sample
relies mostly on large, publicly-traded U.S.-based ﬁrms, and the
results are therefore not necessarily transferable to smaller enter-
prises or ﬁrms that are not publicly-traded, or to other countries or
cultures. Future research is encouraged to replicate our study in
different contexts and countries to identify potential differences.
We can imagine, for example, that the degree of individualism/col-
lectivism associated with a certain culture has an inﬂuence on the
efﬁcacy of internal integration in inﬂuencing performance out-
comes. Second, our sample is restricted by the limited availability
of ﬁnancial data for only a subset of companies represented in
three surveys. We also note the potential mismatch between the
reporting units for the surveys and the ﬁnancial data. While we
aimed to control for this mismatch and our results were robust, we
recognize this mismatch as a limitation. Future research is encour-
aged to pursue such study with a more targeted data collection
effort, maximizing the participation of publicly-traded ﬁrms for
which ﬁnancial data are readily accessible. And third, our data are
comprised of ﬁrms primarily in manufacturing, distribution, and
retail industries. The ﬁndings are therefore not necessarily general-
izable to other industries. It is our hope that the present research
serves as a motivation for further investigation in this area.
