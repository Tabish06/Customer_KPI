Original formulations of the Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS) proposed a uni-
dimensional structure of this measure; however, more recently, evidence for a two-
dimensional structure has been reported, with separate subscales for internal and external
loci of control. The current study evaluates the one- and two-factor models with confir-
matory factor analysis. The results suggest that although the two-factor model provides a
better fit of the data than does the one-factor model, it still does not reach an adequate
standard of fit. Exploratory factor analysis reveal the presence of a third factor, and con-
firmatory factor analysis indicates that the three-factor model provides a superior fit to
either the one- or two-factor model. This finding is replicated with a second independent
sample. These findings call into question the psychometric robustness of the WLCS and
indicate that further refinement is required.

The importance of various individual dispositional variables has become increas-

ingly recognized within organizational psychology research, especially in terms
of their role of “third variables” between predictor and criterion associations (Zapf,
Dormann, & Frese, 1996). In particular, locus of control has been shown to be an
important variable influencing behavior at work by affecting a number of work-
related variables, including job satisfaction, job performance, and turnover (Spector,
1982, 1986). However, there are continuing theoretical and psychometric issues about
how best to measure this construct.

The locus of control concept developed out of social learning theory (Rotter, 1954),
specifically from the observation that certain individuals appeared to ignore or were

immune to reinforcement contingencies (Phares, 1976). These individuals were
thought to hold generalized expectancies that their actions would not lead to desired
rewards or avoidance of punishments. Hence, such individuals were said to have a
locus of control that was external to them, as they believed they had little or no control
over events and personal circumstances. Conversely, individuals perceiving a high
degree of control over their surroundings were thought to attribute the responsibility
for such events to themselves, effectively internalizing this responsibility. Such indi-
viduals are defined as having an internal locus of control.

One of the first measures of this concept was Rotter’s (1966) Internal-External
General Locus of Control Scale. This measure conceptualized an individual’s external
or internal locus of control perceptions along a bipolar continuum. A number of
researchers have questioned the assumption of the internal-external continuum, pro-
posing alternative, more complex formulations (Carver, 1997). For example, within
the educational psychology literature, researchers seeking to measure teachers’ locus
of control have developed a number of measures such as the Teacher Efficacy Scale
(Gibson & Dembo, 1984) and the Teacher Locus of Control Scale (Rose & Medway,
1981). Such scales were found to be composed of two separate dimensions, described
roughly as internal and external control (or internal efficacy and efficacy for external
influences), and were found to be only moderately correlated, suggesting that the
dimensions existed independently rather than as opposites of the same continuum.
Henson (2002) and Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy, and Hoy (1998) provided
reviews of this literature. Henson, Kogan, and Vacha-Haase (2001) conducted a reli-
ability generalization study for several of these instruments and found some disturb-
ing psychometric weaknesses.

Paulhus and Christie (1981; Paulhus, 1983) have suggested that internal and exter-
nal control could vary depending on the domain in which it is assessed. Three dimen-
sions of control were proposed: personal efficacy, interpersonal control, and socio-
political control, in which individual expectancies of control were argued to vary
among these independent domains. Levenson (1974) also argued for a multidimen-
sional locus of control construct in which control is assigned to three sources: internal
control, powerful others, and chance.

In an attempt to produce a work-specific measure, Spector (1988) developed the
Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS). The 16-item scale purported to measure gener-
alized control beliefs within the work setting, with 8 items each tapping internal con-
trol and external control. Despite the existence of theoretical and empirical evidence
supporting a multidimensional model of control (as discussed above), the WLCS was
proposed to be unidimensional. The items relating to internal control are reverse
scored so that internality is represented by low scores and externality by high scores.
Although Spector provided evidence of adequate internal reliability and criterion-
related validity, evidence regarding the underlying structure of the scale was not
reported. However, the absence of such psychometric evidence of the WLCS’s struc-
ture has not hindered its widespread use (e.g., Coleman, Irving, & Cooper, 1999;
Oiling, Spector, Cooper, & Donald, 2001; Tat-wing, Oi-ling, & Spector, 2000).


Oliver et al. / Confirmatory Factor Analysis the WLCS 837

Several studies have sought to investigate the psychometric properties of the
WLCS, and they have suggested that the WLCS is not unidimensional but contains
two factors. For example, in an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) study across two
samples, Daniels and Guppy (1992) uncovered a clear two-factor structure that
reflected independent dimensions of internality and externality. Both the internally
and externally obtained scores were found to have good internal reliability and a high
degree of replicability across the two samples. These findings have been replicated
elsewhere (e.g., Macan, Trusty, & Trimble, 1996).

In response to such studies, Spector (1992) returned to the original data used to for-
mulate the scale and conducted an EFA. The result of this analysis was identical to the
two-factor structure found by Daniels and Guppy (1992); however, Spector concluded
that the results of the factor analyses were insufficient to abandon the unidimensional
structure. He cited evidence drawn from correlations of the separate internal and
external scales with a variety of other criterion variables.

In light of the conflicting reports surrounding the subfactor structure of the WLCS,
the present study sought to examine this issue through the use of confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA). The CFA technique was used in the current study to compare explic-
itly the one- and two-factor models. Based on the aforementioned literature, it was
hypothesized that the one-factor model would provide an adequate fit to the data but
that the two-factor model’s fit would be superior. However, in the case that neither
model was found to adequately fit the data, then alternatives to the one- and two-factor
models would be examined with the aim to develop a better fitting model.

Study 1: Method

Participants

As part of a large longitudinal study, mental health support workers were recruited
from various community mental health organizations throughout New Zealand. An
identical questionnaire was sent out twice to the same pool of 1,000 participants with a
time lag of 6 months. Participants were asked to provide an identification code so that
matching surveys could be identified. The sample was the result of an amalgamation
of participants who responded either to the first wave of questionnaires or to the sec-
ond wave only; in other words, the participants were sampled only once. No statisti-
cally significant differences existed between the two groups on a number of demo-
graphic variables including age, gender, and education levels. The final sample con-
sisted of 261 participants.

The research participants were all employed in the support of mental health service
users (patients) within a community setting. Support workers are generally not
required to have any specific educational or training requirements for the job. Of the
sample, 64.8% were women. The mean age for the sample was 40.6 years with a range
from 18 to 69 years. The mean job tenure was 2.5 years with a range of 1 month to 21.5
years. Sixty-three percent of the respondents were European New Zealand, 12.6%


838 Educational and Psychological Measurement

were New Zealand Maori, and 10% identified as “New Zealander.” A further 11%
responded as Other, and 3.4% did not provide a response.

Procedure

Mental health organizations throughout New Zealand were contacted and invited
to participate. Self-report questionnaire packs were posted to the consenting organiza-
tions for distribution among their employees. Each questionnaire pack contained a
questionnaire booklet, an information sheet, and a prepaid return envelope (addressed
to the authors at the university).

Instruments

WLCS. Spector’s (1988) measure of work locus of control was administered to all
participants. The measure is composed of eight items designed to tap internal control
and eight items tapping external control. A sample internal control item is “A job is
what you make of it.” A sample external control item is “Getting the job you want is
mostly a matter of luck.” As recommended by Spector, a 6-point Likert-type response
format was used (1 = disagree very much to 6 = agree very much). High scores there-
fore indicate an external locus of control.

Results

Descriptive Statistics on the One- and Two-Factor Structures

The Cronbach’s alpha for scores of the single-factor structure was .73; the internal
reliabilities of the two-factor structure were .71 for the Internal subscale scores and .87
for the External subscale scores. Nunnally (1978) suggested that alpha values should
be at least .70; however, a cutoff value of .80 is generally considered acceptable
(Henson, 2001). The two subscales were modestly but statistically significantly corre-
lated (r = –.12).

Statistical Analysis

CFA was conducted to compare the one-factor model with the two-factor model.
Using LISREL 8.5 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993), a number of fit indices were generated
to determine which of the two models best fit the observed data. In total, six indices of
fit were examined. Because there is no one universally accepted fit index, a variety of
indices were used to provide a comprehensive indication of fit. First, the chi-square
test was conducted to test the fit between the sample covariance matrix and the matrix
implied by the models. A large chi-square value and a statistically significant result
(i.e., p < .05) indicate a poor fit in that there is a substantial proportion of variance in
the data not explained by the model. As this statistic is somewhat sensitive to sample
size, a second calculation can be made that involves dividing the chi-square value by

the degrees of freedom (Kline, 1998). Although no clear-cut guideline exists, a ratio
below 3 is generally considered to be acceptable (Kline, 1998). Fit statistics insensi-
tive to sample size were also used, including the goodness-of-fit index and the
nonnormed fit index. Index values of .90 and higher are generally seen as indicative of
a good fit (Bentler & Bonnett, 1980; Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996). Finally, two residual
estimates were used, these being the root mean square residual and the root mean
square error of approximation. Values below .05 for the root mean square residual
(Kline, 1998) and below .10 for the root mean square error of approximation (Browne
& Cudeck, 1993) are generally considered to be acceptable.

Table 1 presents the fit indices produced by the CFA on both the one- and two-
factor models. As can be seen, the one-factor model fit the data poorly as none of the fit
indices approached an acceptable level. The two-factor model provided a better fit, as
indicated by all fit indices. Using the observed differences in the chi-square values in
conjunction with the differences in the degrees of freedom, it was possible to test if the
improvement was statistically significant. Such a test showed that the two-factor
model was a statistically significant improvement over the one-factor model (differ-
ence in χ2[1] = 414.91, p < .001); however, the indices of this latter model did not reach
adequate levels. The chi-square/degrees of freedom ratio approached the suggested
value of 3 but did not fall below it. Both the goodness-of-fit index and the nonnormed
fit index failed to exceed the recommended value of .90, and neither of the residual
estimates was below the suggested acceptable levels.

Because the two-factor model did not provide an adequate fit, it was decided to
conduct an EFA on the data to examine the possibility of an alternative model that
would fit the data better. To further investigate the underlying structure, principal com-
ponents analysis with an oblique rotation using the direct oblimin procedure (oblimin
with a delta of 0) was conducted.

To determine the number of components, only those factors with an eigenvalue
greater than one were retained (Kaiser criterion). This was supplemented by the use of
parallel analysis, in which obtained eigenvalues were compared to eigenvalues
obtained from a comparable set of random data (Thompson & Daniel, 1996).
Extracted factors can therefore be said to exceed the variance accounted for by chance.
This led to the retention of three factors.


840 Educational and Psychological Measurement

Table 2 displays which items related to each of three obtained factors and reports
pattern and structure coefficients. This analysis revealed the presence of three compo-
nents that explained a total of 53.08% of the variance (prerotation) in the measure. The
first component accounted for 27.72% of the variance and was composed of eight
items concerned with factors out of the individual’s control, that is, related to chance
and luck, and can be thought of as “external control.” This component corresponded
with the original external control items proposed by Spector (1988). The second com-
ponent explained 17.21% of the variance, and the third component explained 8.23%.
These components represented a split in the internal control subfactor. Because these
components were not easily interpretable, they were labeled Internal 1 and Internal 2.
Cronbach’s alphas and intercorrelations for these three factors are presented in
Table 3. The intercorrelation between the two internal control factors was .35, which
although statistically significant was not high enough to suggest that the scales sub-
stantially overlapped.

Although unexpected, early indications supported the three-factor structure, and it
was therefore decided to compare its structure against the one- and two-factor models
using CFA with the current data set. This examination was conducted on an explor-
atory basis because EFA and CFA are not typically performed on the same data set.
The results of the CFA indicated that the three-factor model yielded a better fit than did
the preceding models (see Table 1). Improvements were seen on all of the model fit
indices, although again these results were not completely within the generally
expected fit index levels. The chi-square difference test revealed that the difference
between the two- and three-factor models was statistically significant (difference in
χ2[2] = 101.02, p < .001), indicating that the three-factor model was a statistically sig-
nificant improvement over the two-factor model.

Discussion

CFAs of the WLCS showed that neither the one- nor the two-factor model ade-
quately fit the observed data. An EFA yielded a three-factor model that obtained supe-
rior CFA fit indices to both the one- and the two-factor models.

The results of this study were surprising and did not reflect the hypothesized expec-
tations. Although the hypothesis was partially confirmed in that the two-factor model
was found to provide a better explanation of the data as compared to the uni-
dimensional model, the subsequent EFA and CFA revealed that a three-factor model
provided the best fit of all. Neither previous empirical nor theoretical work has pointed
to the presence of a three-factor structure within this scale. The internal reliability esti-
mates and interfactor correlations also produced support for the three-factor structure.
Although the results appeared to support consistently the three-factor model, it must
be remembered that these findings are exploratory in nature because both an EFA and
a CFA were performed on the same data set. To adequately demonstrate that the three-
factor structure is robust and not unique to the present sample, the key findings should
be replicated. The following study was conducted to attempt to replicate this structure.

Study 2

The second study sought to replicate the results of the first by using CFA to exam-
ine the one-, two-, and three-factor structures of the WLCS on a second independent
sample. In addition, two main concerns with regard to the construct validity of the
three-factor model were addressed: (a) discriminant validity (whether the factors
show different patterns of relationships with other criterion variables) and (b) incre-
mental validity (whether the three factors provide an improvement in statistical preci-
sion compared to the one-factor model). Consequently, further analyses were con-
ducted to establish whether differences existed in the predictive ability of the Internal
1 and Internal 2 scales with various other work-related variables. If differences could
be found, further weight would be added to the hypothesis that these are independent
dimensions rather than simply a consequence of an arbitrary division of the internal
scale. The criterion variables used for this purpose were negative affectivity, general
psychological well-being, job satisfaction, social support, and work-related well-
being. Previous literature has demonstrated that each of these variables has been indi-
vidually associated with locus of control (e.g., Daniels & Guppy, 1994; Widerszal-
Bazyl, Cooper, Sparks, & Spector, 2000).

Method

Participants

The participant sample consisted of 293 nonacademic university staff working at a
New Zealand university. As with the previous study, an identical survey was sent out
twice to the same pool in this study of 700 participants. Responses were collected as
part of a larger longitudinal study. Participants were asked to provide an identification
code so that matching surveys could be identified. The final sample was composed of
an amalgamation of participants who responded only at the first stage of this project
and those who responded only at the second time. No statistically significant differ-
ences were found between the two groups on a number of demographic or dis-
positional variables. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 62 years with an average
age of 40 years. Women constituted 65.2% of the sample. The mean job tenure was
5.73 years with a range from 1 month to 38.9 years. Sixty-seven percent of the respon-


Oliver et al. / Confirmatory Factor Analysis the WLCS 843

dents identified themselves as European New Zealander, 13% as being a “New Zea-
lander,” and 4.4% as being New Zealand Maori. A further 10% responded as Other,
and 5.6% did not provide a response.

Procedure

Questionnaires were sent out to all nonacademic staff at the university. The partici-
pants were asked to complete an anonymous self-report questionnaire. Completed
questionnaires were returned directly to the researcher via the university’s internal
mail system.

Instruments

WLCS. Spector’s (1988) measure of work locus of control was used. Its character-

istics were described above in Study 1.

Negative affectivity. The Neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory
(Eysenck & Eysenck, 1968) was included as a measure of negative affectivity. The
scale was developed as a measure of the degree to which people worry, are anxious, or
are pessimistic, and it is a widely accepted measure of negative affectivity (Watson &
Clarke, 1984). This study used the shortened 12-item scale (Eysenck, Eysenck, &
Barrett, 1985) with a 4-point response scale ranging from almost never to almost
always. High scores indicate high levels of negative affectivity. An acceptable internal
consistency estimate (Cronbach’s alpha) of .87 was obtained from the present sample.
A sample item in the scale is “Do you ever feel ‘just miserable’for no good reason?”

Psychological well-being. Psychological well-being was measured with the 12-
item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12; Goldberg, 1978). The GHQ is designed
to detect minor mental health disorders and is widely used in both clinical and occupa-
tional settings (e.g., Banks et al., 1980; Parker, Wall, & Myers, 1995). The respondents
were invited to answer the 12 questions referring to their psychological well-being
behaviors over the past few weeks. An example of a question is “Been able to face up
to your problems?” The respondents indicated their answers on the scale by choosing
one of four answer alternatives: “better than usual,” “same as usual,” “less than usual,”
and “much less than usual.” High scores indicate poor psychological well-being. An
internal consistency value of .88 was obtained for scores on this measure.

Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured using a 15-item scale developed by
Warr, Cook, and Wall (1979). The scale asks respondents the degree to which they are
satisfied with both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of their jobs. The respondents were
asked to indicate on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 =
extremely satisfied) how generally satisfied they were with various aspects of their
current jobs, such as the current work conditions. The overall job satisfaction scale
yielded an internal consistency of .92.


844 Educational and Psychological Measurement

Social support measure. Social support was measured using a 12-item scale devel-
oped by Caplan, Cobb, French, Van Harrison, and Pinneau (1980). The scale contains
three subdimensions that measure support received from the respondent’s immediate
supervisor, other work colleagues, and friends and family. For example, questions
asked how much supervisors, colleagues, and family would be willing to go out of
their way for the respondent. Responses were given on a 4-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The internal consistency for the scale
scores was found to be .84 in this sample. High scores indicate high levels of support.

Work-related well-being. Work-related well-being was measured using Warr’s
(1990) 12-item scale. The measure was constructed to tap affective well-being at work
and asked respondents to indicate, over the past few weeks, how much their jobs led
them to feel, for example, tense, uneasy, or depressed. Answers were given on a 6-
point response format (1 = never to 6 = all of the time). Scores on this scale demon-
strated an internal consistency of .92. Higher scores indicate higher levels of well-
being.

Results

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for Study 2 variables are presented in Table 4. The Cronbach’s
alpha for scores of the single-factor structure of the WLCS was .64; the internal
reliabilities of the two-factor structure were .76 for the Internal subscale and .83 for
the External subscale. The fact that the reliability estimates for the two subscales’
scores were higher than the WLCS total score estimate suggests that the instrument is
not unidimensional. The two subscales were modestly but statistically significantly
correlated (r = –.27). The reliability estimates for the three-factor model were .83 for
the External subscale scores, .70 for the Internal 1 subscale scores, and .71 for the
Internal 2 subscale scores. The External subscale was similarly correlated with the
Internal 1 (r = –.23) and Internal 2 (r = –.25) subscales. Internal 1 was positively corre-
lated with Internal 2 (r = .46).

CFA

Table 5 displays the findings of the CFAs comparing the one-, two-, and three-
factor models for the WLCS. The pattern of results is very similar to the pattern found
for the first study, demonstrating a progressively better fit from the one-factor model
to the three-factor model. Once again, the three-factor model was superior on all indi-
ces compared to both the one- and two-factor models and achieved acceptable good-
ness of fit for all five measures of model fit. Using the chi-square difference test, the
chi-square values for the one- and two-factor models were found to be statistically sig-
nificantly different (difference in χ2[1] = 469.34, p < .001), as were the chi-square val-
ues for the two- and three-factor models (difference in χ2[2] = 91.51, p < .001), indi-

846 Educational and Psychological Measurement

cating that the three-factor structure was the best fitting model of the three. Thus,
Study 2 appears to confirm the presence of a three-factor structure for the WLCS as
identified in Study 1.

Regression Analyses

The final step in this analysis was to examine the discriminatory ability of the Inter-
nal 1 and Internal 2 scales. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine the
amount of unique variance that could be explained by the two scales with regard to a
variety of criterion variables. If these two subscales are mere mirror copies of each
other, then they should predict scores on other tests with large amounts of shared vari-
ance and very little unique variance. However, given the results of the previous EFA
and CFA results, we predicted that statistically significant amounts of unique variance
would be provided by each subfactor.

A total of 10 hierarchical regression equations were constructed: 2 separate equa-
tions for each of the five criterion variables. Table 6 summarizes the results of these
analyses by displaying the standardized regression coefficients and the R2 change val-
ues for each of the equations. In addition, the unique variance, the shared variance, and
the total variance explained within each of the five criterion variables are displayed.
These values were calculated following the procedure outlined above.

An examination of the unique variance values in Table 6 clearly demonstrates that
the two internal subscales differentially predicted statistically significant amounts of
unique variance in each of the criterion variables. Although the magnitude of the vari-
ance explained is not large, it is the difference that is critical. For example, the Internal
1 variable explained 4% of the variance in GHQ in a unique fashion, whereas Internal
2 accounted for only 2% unique variance. Moreover, with regard to job satisfaction,
the opposite was found to be true as Internal 2 predicted 7% of the unique variance,
whereas Internal 1 accounted for only 1% unique variance. The differential predictive
ability of each of the internal subscales was further emphasized by the ratio of total
unique variance to shared variance. When predicting job satisfaction, the unique vari-
ance is close to twice as large as the shared variance. This difference is particularly evi-
dent in the prediction of negative affectivity, in which there was no shared variance
explained. On average, across the five criterion variables, the two subscales accounted
for 6.2% unique variance together as compared to 4% shared variance. It is acknowl-
edged that the amount of variance explained here is not great, but the pattern of results
does tend to support the hypothesis that the two internal scales represent somewhat
distinct constructs.

Discussion

The CFA of the WLCS showed that the three-factor model obtained a superior fit to
the data compared to the one- and two-factor models. However, it was noted that not
all the fit indices fell within their recommended ranges, suggesting that the three-fac-
tor model does not constitute a uniformly acceptable fit to the data.

848 Educational and Psychological Measurement

To further support the three-factor model, the predictive abilities of the Internal 1
and Internal 2 subscales were examined with a range of criterion variables. It was
hypothesized that if the two internal scales represented independent constructs, then
each scale should predict the criterion variables differentially. This prediction was
supported with findings that showed that the amount of unique variance explained by
each of the scales, although not large, differed among the group of criterion variables.
Furthermore, substantial differences were found between the ratio of unique and
shared variance explained by each of the scales. These findings support the hypothesis
that the two scales exist as two relatively independent constructs.

General Discussion

The evidence presented across the two studies reported here provides tentative sup-
port for a three-factor model of the WLCS. Previous research has supported either a
one- or a two-factor model for this measure; however, results of the CFAs on two inde-
pendent samples reported here failed to support an argument of psychometric reliabil-
ity for either of these two models. Instead, a psychometrically derived three-factor
model showed a substantially better fit. In addition, the regression analyses suggested
that the Internal 1 and Internal 2 subscales identified in this research differentially pre-
dicted a number of criterion variables. If these two obtained internal control–oriented
subscales tap the same construct, they should be found to be highly correlated and
would, therefore, be unable to predict any substantial unique variance on the criterion
variables. Neither of these characteristics was found within the analyses reported here.
In the absence of previous psychometric comparisons, the aim of this study was to
examine both the one- and two-factor structure of the WLCS through the use of CFA.
Although CFA is not an inherently superior statistical technique to EFA, it does pro-
vide complementary information to that offered by EFA (see discussion by Hurley
et al., 1997, on this point). Specifically, CFA allows for the direct comparison of vari-
ous alternative factor structures to estimate which structure provides the best descrip-
tion of the data. In the first study reported here, data did not support either the one- or
two-factor structure, and an alternative was sought. Although the findings of the cur-
rent studies provide consistent support for a three-factor model, it is recognized that
this model was derived on a purely empirical basis and may result in subfactors that
lack theoretical clarity. In particular, no clear distinction is obvious between the two
obtained internal subfactors. Furthermore, although the three-factor model was found
to provide a better fit than that provided by the one- and two-factor models, it was not
found to be wholly adequate. Therefore, it needs to be acknowledged that the findings
presented here should not be taken as conclusive evidence for a three-factor structure
within this scale; rather, we believe that they are indicative of a lack of psychometric
robustness within the Internal subscale. In summary, these findings point to the need
for revision of this subscale so as to optimize statistical and conceptual precision and
predictive power.


Oliver et al. / Confirmatory Factor Analysis the WLCS 849

What is clear from this research is the statistical superiority of the two-factor
model—supporting the separation of the internal and external dimensions—over the
one-factor model. Clearly, by using the one-factor model, a great deal of specificity
and precision is lost. In contrast, the two-factor structure, although not nearly as
widely used, provides the opportunity for an examination of the distinct operation of
the separate internal and external dimensions. These issues should be carefully con-
sidered within the context of specific hypotheses and research aims when deciding
which scoring scheme to use.

These findings point to the importance of conducting a thorough psychometric
evaluation of a scale in the development process. Spector (1988) did not report any
information pertaining to the structure of the scale in his initial article. Later work by
Spector and others (Daniels & Guppy, 1994; Macan et al., 1996; Spector, 1992) relied
on EFAs to provide psychometric information. However, in many cases, these reports
also failed to report internal reliabilities for scores of the proposed subscales and the
correlations between these subscales. This type of statistical information is useful in
determining and evaluating factor structure.

Future research using the WLCS should be performed with caution. Results pre-
sented here clearly indicate that the scale is not unidimensional, consistent with those
studies that have demonstrated a two-factor model (i.e., Daniels & Guppy, 1992;
Macan et al., 1996; Spector, 1992). However, because the three-factor model per-
formed in a superior fashion on both the psychometric and validity tests reported here,
our results point to the need for a revision of the theoretical underpinnings and of the
psychometric properties of the WLCS.
