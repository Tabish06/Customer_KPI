  ABSTRACT 
 We first examine whether there is a relation-
ship  between  firm  reputation  and  the  stated 
propensity of an individual to pursue behaviors 
that  support  the  firm.  We  then  examine  the 
extent  to  which  the  reputation-supportive 
behavior  linkage  is  moderated  by  the  firm ’ s 
foreignness, its industry and its exposure in its 
local  market.  In  a  multi-level  analysis  using 
117,195 individual evaluations of 125 com-
panies  in  the  context  of  Latin  America  and 
Spain,  we  find  a  strong  direct  relationship 
between reputation and supportive behavior in 
the  product,  capital  and  labor  markets.  We 
also find that this relationship is moderated by 
variables  related  to  foreignness,  industry  and 
local exposure.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Corporate  reputation  refers  to  the  overall 
knowledge and esteem about a corporation 
held by the public ( Fombrun, 1996 ). Repu-
tation  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  associ-
ated with numerous important ﬁ rm outcomes 
( Dowling,  2006 ),  and  is  well  established  as 
an area of signiﬁ cant interest in the strategy 
ﬁ eld  ( Fombrun  and  Shanley,  1990 ;   Basdeo 
 et  al. ,  2006 ).  Moreover,  a  link  has  been 
established  between  corporate  reputation

and the supportive behaviors of individuals 
( Caruana  et al. , 2006 ). As effective competi-
tion in labor, ﬁ nancial and product markets 
is often viewed as critical to ﬁ rm perform-
ance (eg,  Khanna and Palepu, 1997 ;  Chacar 
 et  al. ,  2009 ),  we  suggest  that  garnering 
individual support in these areas of support-
ive behavior could be particularly important 
for ﬁ rm success. However, evidence regard-
ing which particular ﬁ rms most likely ben-
eﬁ t  from  improved  reputation  in  terms  of 
inﬂ uencing  supportive  behavior  remains 
limited,  despite  the  academic  and  practical 
relevance  of  this  issue.  Herein,  we  ﬁ rst 
examine whether there is indeed a relation-
ship between ﬁ rm reputation and the stated 
propensity of an individual to pursue behav-
iors that support the ﬁ rm in the context of 
Latin America and Spain. We then examine 
the extent to which the reputation-supportive 
behavior  linkage  is  moderated  by  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
foreignness, its industry and its exposure in 
its local market. 
 Understanding 

the  conditions  under 
which  reputation  has  a  stronger  link  with 
ﬁ rm  supportive  behaviors  is  important  for 
multiple reasons. First, it is well established 
that the perceptions of external stakeholders 
inﬂ uence ﬁ rm performance ( Freeman, 1984 ; 
 Jimenez  and  Davila,  2008 ).  Organizations 
depend  upon  external  constituencies  for 
revenue,  capital,  labor,  etc.  Yet,  relatively 
little  research  examines  important  factors 
that  cause  these  external  constituencies  to

pursue behaviors that are supportive of the 
ﬁ rm.  By  examining  a  major  outcome  of 
reputation, organizational supportive behav-
ior, this manuscript addresses  Fombrun and 
Shanley’s (1990: 235)  suggestion that  ‘ repu-
tational  consequences  are  also  worthy  of 
considerable attention in future research ’ . 

 Second,  prior  research  has  established 
reputation as a powerful signal that develops 
as  a  result  of  numerous  supporting  signals 
related  to  a  ﬁ rm  and  its  competitors  (eg, 
 Basdeo   et  al. ,  2006 ).  We  suggest  that  the 
degree  to  which  individuals  rely  on  the 
reputation  signal  will  partially  depend  on 
the  availability  of  other  signaling  variables 
from  which  to  make  supportive  behavior 
judgments. In particular, we aim to improve 
our understanding of the reputation-supportive 
behavior  relationship  by  examining  factors 
related  to  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  foreignness,  its  industry 
and its local exposure, all of which provide 
signals  to  individuals  that  either  lessen  or 
strengthen their need to utilize reputation as 
an information cue when deciding whether 
to support a ﬁ rm. 

 One  factor  affecting  public  perception 
is  ﬁ rm  legitimacy  (eg,   Deephouse  and 
Suchman,  2008 ).  MNCs  doing  business  in 
foreign  countries  are  commonly  described 
as  facing  legitimacy  issues  stemming  from 
unfamiliarity with and a lack of embedded-
ness in a local environment ( Zaheer, 1995 ). 
However, the degree to which these liabil-
ities impact reputation assessments, particu-
larly in developing world settings, is not well 
understood. As emerging market investment 
continues to gain interest among both schol-
ars and practitioners ( Hoskisson  et al. , 2000 ; 
 Meyer,  2004 ),  a  better  understanding  of 
how 
characteristics 
inﬂ uence  perceptions  of  ﬁ rms  is  becoming 
increasingly  useful  and  important.  In  par-
ticular, MNC investment into Latin Amer-
ica  increased  dramatically  during  the  1990s 
( Robles   et  al. ,  2003 ;   Casanova,  2005 ), 
increasing  the  relevance  of  examining  for-
eignness perceptions, and their relationships 

internationalization 

to  reputation  and  supportive  behavior  in 
this region. 

 Associated  with  this  recent  wave  of  for-
eign investment into Latin America, certain 
industries,  such  as  telecom,  ﬁ nancial  and 
energy, have received increased scrutiny in 
this  region.  These  industries  mirror  the 
major investment trends in the region, which 
were  driven  largely  by  deregulation  and 
privatization  in  several  sectors  in  the  late 
1980s  and  1990s  (eg,   Casanova,  2005 ). 
Accordingly, examining industry effects (eg, 
 Barnett and Hoffman, 2008 ) on the reputa-
tion-supportive  behavior  relationship  may 
help us understand the effects of this  attention. 
 Additionally, ﬁ rm characteristics, such as 
information  availability  or  visibility,  inﬂ u-
ence  attention  ( Ross  and  Nisbett,  1991 ; 
 Gardner  et al. , 1989 ). The degree to which 
alternative sources of information are avail-
able  regarding  a  ﬁ rm  may  inﬂ uence  the 
degree to which respondents rely on reputa-
tion  as  a  signal  when  making  supportive 
behavior  decisions.  As  such,  the  degree  to 
which ﬁ rms have exposure in the local mar-
ket may inﬂ uence the reputation-supportive 
behavior  relationship,  and  is  worthy  of 
examination. 

 Finally, 

theoretically  and  empirically 
examining  the  largely  understudied  Latin 
American  region  is  important  as  a  goal  in 
itself.  Emerging  markets  are  increasingly 
gaining interest among international business 
and management scholars (eg,  Meyer, 2004 ; 
 London and Hart, 2004 ). However, a casu-
al  review  of  emerging  market  publications 
in  top  international  business  and  manage-
ment  journals  quickly  reveals  that  the  vast 
majority  of  recent  work  in  this  area  has 
focused on China  –  particularly in terms of 
management-related  issues.  While  China  is 
justiﬁ ably  important  as  the  top  emerging 
market destination of foreign direct invest-
ment ( United Nations, 2006 ), other emerg-
ing markets deserve much greater attention 
as  the  degree  to  which  extant  research  on 
China  applies  to  these  markets  may  vary

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

signiﬁ cantly  due  to  differences  in  size, 
culture,  government  type  and  numerous 
other variables. Greater knowledge of non-
Chinese  emerging  markets  would  beneﬁ t 
both  academics,  in  terms  of  reﬁ ning  and 
expanding existing theories, as well as man-
agers, who are increasingly being drawn to 
these  regions.  Greater  knowledge  of  Latin 
America may also provide insights into the 
future of the neighboring United States, as 
the origin of what is now the largest minor-
ity  group 
in  the  US,  with  Hispanics 
accounting  for  14.8  percent  of  the  US 
population as of 2006 ( US Census Bureau, 
2009 ). 

 In this manuscript, we develop hypotheses 
predicting a respondent ’ s stated propensity to 
pursue ﬁ rm supportive behavior based upon 
their  assessment  of  ﬁ rm  reputation  and  its 
interaction with variables related to a ﬁ rm ’ s 
foreignness, industry and local exposure. We 
then  present  the  study  methodology,  fol-
lowed  by  our  results.  Our  analysis  is  based 
upon 117,195 individual evaluations of 125 
companies in Spain and seven Latin  American 
countries collected by the Reputation Insti-
tute in conjunction with the Foro de Rep-
utacion  Corporativa.  We  conclude  with 
some general discussion and implications.   

 HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT 
 In the following subsections, we ﬁ rst predict 
the  degree  to  which  reputation  impacts  a 
respondent ’ s  stated  propensity  to  pursue 
behavior  supportive  of  a  ﬁ rm,  in  terms  of 
purchasing  its  products,  company  invest-
ment  or  the  desire  to  pursue  employment. 
We then predict when the base reputation-
supportive  behavior  relationship  may  be 
modiﬁ ed  based  upon  characteristics  related 
to a ﬁ rm ’ s foreignness, its industry and local 
exposure.  We  suggest  that  these  three  sets 
of  variables  provide  signals  to  individuals 
that direct their attention (eg,  Gardner  et al. , 
1989 )  to  reputation  to  a  greater  or  lesser 
extent  when  making  supportive  behavior 
decisions.  

 Direct Reputation Affect 
 As  effective  competition  in  labor,  ﬁ nancial 
and  product  markets  is  often  viewed  as 
critical  to  ﬁ rm  performance  in  emerging 
markets  (eg,   Khanna  and  Palepu,  1997 ), 
garnering  individual  support  in  these  areas 
could be particularly important for ﬁ rm suc-
cess. Numerous authors note the importance 
of  taking  multiple  stakeholder  perspectives 
into consideration in developing and emerg-
ing markets (eg,  Jimenez and Davila, 2008 ; 
 Chen  et al. , 2009 ). 

 Individuals  who  perceive  companies  as 
having  a  better  reputation  may  be  more 
likely to pursue company-supportive behav-
iors, based upon stronger perceptions of ﬁ t 
with these companies. Individuals who pos-
itively  evaluate  companies  may  be  more 
likely to perceive a ﬁ t with these companies 
(eg,   Kristof,  1996 ;   Newburry   et  al. ,  2008 ). 
 Chatman 
(1989:  339)   deﬁ ned  person-
organization ﬁ t as  ‘ congruence between the 
norms and values of organizations and values 
of  persons ’ ,  such  that  when  individual 
abilities  and  values  match  organizational 
 demands,  person-organization  ﬁ t  occurs. 
This  concept  is  similar  to  what   van  Riel 
(2008)   referred  to  as  obtaining  a  strategi-
cally aligned workforce, and may extend to 
other stakeholder groups as well. 

 From  an   employment   standpoint,  a  com-
pany  with  a 
stronger  reputation  may 
seem  more  stable  and  able  to  consistently 
support  employees  in  their  job  aspirations. 
Although not the main focus of their study, 
 Newburry  et al.  (2006)  found that reputation 
was  highly  signiﬁ cant  in  predicting  com-
pany  workplace  attractiveness.   Turban  and 
Greening  (1996)   also  found  a  relationship 
between  ﬁ rm  reputation  (with  respect  to 
corporate  social  responsibility)  and  ﬁ rm 
attractiveness as an employer. Examining the 
context of a Spanish MNC, BBVA, and its 
international 
 Alloza  (2008)  
noted that reputation in terms of employee 
satisfaction leads to greater employee moti-
vation  and  retainment.  From  an   investment

standpoint,  potential  investors  seek  out 
companies that they believe will increase in 
value, such as those with strong reputations 
( Roberts and Dowling, 2002 ;  Caruana  et al. , 
2006 ).  While  past  performance  does  not 
guarantee future success, it is nonetheless a 
strong indicator.  Helm (2007)  found that the 
impact  of  reputation  on  behavioral  loyalty 
among investors works through the mediat-
ing  variables  of  investor  satisfaction  and 
affective loyalty. From a  product  standpoint, 
products of ﬁ rms with high reputations (and 
reputable  brands)  might  also  be  viewed  as 
superior, as this may be seen as an indicator 
that  the  ﬁ rm  produces  highly  desirable 
products (eg,  Wang  et al. , 2006 ). Similarly, 
within  service  industries,  companies  with 
reputations for better customer service will 
have  more  satisﬁ ed  and  loyal  customers 
( Alloza, 2008 ). 

 Based  upon  the  above  arguments,  we 

suggest  H1  as follows: 

 H1:         Reputation  positively  inﬂ uences  stated 
propensity to pursue supportive  behaviors.  

 Foreignness Moderations 
 MNCs  are  commonly  thought  to  face  a 
liability of foreignness ( Hymer, 1976 ;  Kindle-
berger,  1969 )  in  foreign  markets.  These 
liabilities  stem  from  unfamiliarity,  lack  of 
roots, and lack of legitimacy in a local en-
vironment ( Zaheer, 1995 ;  Meyer and Row-
an, 1977 ), and suggest that foreign ﬁ rms will 
have  more  negative  reputations  in  general. 
While legitimacy and reputation are distinct 
concepts,  King and Whetton (2008)  note a 
deﬁ nite relationship between them.  Mezias 
(2002)  found that foreign subsidiaries oper-
ating in the United States were more likely 
to have labor lawsuits brought to a judgment 
than US-owned ﬁ rms. As lawsuits may lead 
to negative press, this again suggests a nega-
tive  link  between  foreign  status  and  com-
pany reputation. 

stakeholders  believe 

 In addition to the direct negative foreign-
ness effects on supportive behavior found in 
prior  studies  (eg,   Newburry   et  al. ,  2006 ), 
foreignness  may  also  moderate  the  reputa-
tion-supportive  behavior  relationship  by 
making reputation more salient to an indi-
vidual.  As  possessing  a  foreign  HQ  may 
cause  a  ﬁ rm  to  be  considered  an  outsider, 
this may lessen the degree to which poten-
tial 
they  possess 
adequate  knowledge  to  evaluate  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
competence.  Due  to  different  operating 
practices and a lack of local embeddedness, 
information  regarding  ﬁ rms  from  foreign 
countries  may  also  be  considered  either 
incomplete  or  inaccurate  ( Zaheer,  1995 ; 
 Newburry  et al. , 2006 ). As such, information 
cues regarding these ﬁ rms, such as ﬁ rm rep-
utation,  may  be  relatively  more  important 
in  evaluating  foreign  ﬁ rms  than  domestic 
ﬁ rms,  where  other  sources  of  information 
may be available to make supportive behav-
ior  decisions.  Accordingly,  we  suggest  the 
following hypothesis: 

 H2:         The reputation-supportive behavior rela-
tionship is moderated by foreignness char-
acteristics, such that the relationship will 
be more positive for foreign headquartered 
ﬁ rms. 

 Internationalization  refers  to  the  process 
by which organizations become more inter-
national  in  their  cross-national  business 
transactions ( Newburry  et al. , 2006 ). Inter-
nationalization  levels  have  been  shown  to 
have  strong  effects  on  ﬁ rm  performance 
( Contractor   et  al. ,  2003 ;   Lu  and  Beamish, 
2004 ).  Here,  it  is  suggested  that  degree  of 
internationalization  serves  as  a  signal  to 
potential  stakeholders  that  a  company  is 
doing  well.  Because  it  takes  resources  to 
invest  in  foreign  locations,  ﬁ rms  that  con-
duct this type of investment may appear to 
be  more  prosperous  than  ﬁ rms  that  only 
operate  locally.  This  increased  investment

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

may  also  create  the  appearance  of  compe-
tence as it demonstrates that ﬁ rms can oper-
ate  under  multiple  national  environments. 
Particularly  in  developing  countries,  being 
able  to  compete  in  an  international  arena 
may have particularly strong signaling pow-
er  for  individuals  ( Namazie  and  Frame, 
2007 ;  Newburry  et al. , 2008 ). As such, per-
ceptions  regarding  the  internationalization 
of  a  ﬁ rm  may  reinforce  reputation  percep-
tions  in  inﬂ uencing  supportive  behavior, 
thus  creating  a  positive  moderating  effect. 
Accordingly,  we  suggest  the 
following 
hypothesis: 

 H3:         The reputation- supportive behavior rela-
tionship  is  moderated  by  international 
scope  such  that  the  relationship  will  be 
more  positive  for  more  international 
ﬁ rms. 

 Industry Moderations 
 Industry has been established as an important 
component  of  reputation  management  (eg, 
 Winn  et al. , 2008 ). In the context of Latin 
America and Spain, certain industries, such 
as  telecom,  ﬁ nancial  and  energy,  have 
received increased scrutiny. These industries 
mirror  the  major  investment  trends  in  the 
region,  which  were  driven 
largely  by 
deregulation  and  privatization  in  several 
sectors  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s  (eg, 
 Casanova, 2005 ). Examining industry effects 
on the reputation-supportive behavior rela-
tionship may help us understand the effects 
of this attention. 

 While the degree of this effect may vary 
by industry, we suggest that in high scrutiny 
industries where fast changes to the market 
are  occurring  due  to  deregulation  and 
privatization,  individuals  will  look  toward 
ﬁ rm  reputation  to  a  greater  extent  when 
making 
supportive  behavior  decisions. 
Collective  industry  reputations  (eg,   Winn 
 et  al. ,  2008 )  may  have  not  yet  emerged  in 

these  industries.  Information  cues  upon 
which  to  make  supportive  behavior  deci-
sions  may  not  yet  be  available,  or  may  be 
heavily  discounted  due  to  rapid  change, 
causing  ﬁ rm  reputation  to  become  a  more 
important  signal  in  decision-making  proc-
esses. Accordingly, we suggest the following 
hypothesis: 

 H4:         The reputation- supportive behavior relation-
ship  is  moderated  by  industry  such  that 
the  relationship  will  be  more  positive  for 
rapidly  changing  industries  (herein,  the 
telecom, ﬁ nancial and energy industries). 

 Local Exposure Moderations 
 Information-related  characteristics  of  ﬁ rms, 
such as information availability or visibility, 
inﬂ uence  the  attention  ﬁ rms  receive  from 
potential  stakeholders  ( Ross  and  Nisbett, 
1991 ).  The  degree  to  which  knowledge  is 
available  regarding  a  ﬁ rm  from  various 
sources  may  impact  the  degree  to  which 
individuals rely on reputation when making 
supportive  behavior  judgments.  In  the  fol-
lowing  three  hypotheses,  we  suggest  that 
company  proﬁ tability,  company  tenure  in 
the local market and company familiarity all 
have important signaling effects, which may 
impact  the  reputation-supportive  behavior 
relationship. 

 Firm  proﬁ tability  and  reputation  have  a 
well-established association (eg,  Roberts and 
Dowling,  2002 ).  Regarding  proﬁ tability, 
 McGuire  et al.  (1988)  found that return on 
assets  (ROA)  serves  an  important  signaling 
function,  not  just  with  respect  to  the 
economic  health  of  a  ﬁ rm,  but  also  with 
respect to ﬁ rm reputation for social respon-
sibility.  Moreover,  greater  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance  implies  a  greater  ability  to  hire 
employees,  greater  potential  proﬁ ts 
for 
investors and higher quality products. Given 
the  amount  of  information  that  ﬁ nancial 
performance  provides,  it  is  suggested  that

this  variable  will  negatively  moderate  the 
reputation-supportive behavior relationship. 
Reputation cues will be less informative in 
this case as individuals possess another objec-
tive  basis  on  which  to  make  supportive 
behavior decisions. Accordingly, we suggest 
the following hypothesis: 

 H5:         The reputation- supportive behavior rela-
tionship is moderated by proﬁ tability such 
that the relationship will be less positive 
for ﬁ rms that are more proﬁ table. 

 Another  factor  affecting  public  percep-
tions  regarding  a  ﬁ rm  is  the  tenure  of  the 
ﬁ rm in a country deﬁ ned as the number of 
years  a  ﬁ rm  has  done  business  in  a  focal 
country. According to  Stinchcombe’s (1965)  
   liability of newness, new organizations have 
to learn new roles inside the organization as 
well  as  in  a  society.  In  addition,   ‘ new  or-
ganizations are also assumed to typically lack 
broad  bases  of  inﬂ uence  and  endorsement, 
stable  relationships  with  important  external 
constituents and the legitimacy that years of 
experience in providing particular products 
or  services  confer  on  older  organizations ’  
( Baum and Shipilov, 2006: 62 ). Stable rela-
tionships  with  important  institutions  and 
community agencies have strong effects on 
liabilities  of  newness  ( Baum  and  Oliver, 
1991 ;  Henderson, 1999 ). 

 Public perceptions of ﬁ rms are based on 
ﬁ rm  information  and  knowledge.  These 
perceptions are affected by ﬁ rms ’   relationships 
with  both  the  general  public  and  local  in-
stitutions,  which  length  of  tenure  in  the 
local market helps provide. In other words, 
the  external  legitimacy  of  ﬁ rms  has  deter-
mining  effects  on 
societal  perceptions. 
 Gonzalez  and  Perez-Floriano  (2008)   note 
the  importance  of  developing  trust  and 
relationships  in  South  America.  As  such, 
similar to the previous hypotheses, local ten-
ure may provide information cues that less-
en the need to rely on corporate reputation 

in  making  supportive  behavior  decisions. 
Accordingly,  we  suggest  the 
following 
hypothesis: 

 H6:         The  reputation- supportive  behavior  rela-
tionship is moderated by service years such 
that the relationship will be less positive for 
ﬁ rms that have been in a market longer. 

  Cable and Turban (2001)  echoed a com-
mon  view  that  notes  that  familiarity  is 
associated  with  positive  feelings  for  a  ﬁ rm, 
which  ultimately  increases  ﬁ rm  reputation. 
However,  as  noted  by   Brooks  and  High-
house (2006) , evidence connecting familiar-
ity  and  reputation  is  undoubtedly  mixed. 
One reason for this mixed evidence may be 
that  knowledge  plays  a  more  indirect  role 
with  respect  to  reputation  and  supportive 
behavior. Here, we suggest that knowledge 
will  moderate  the  reputation-supportive 
behavior relationship such that the relation-
ship  will  weaken  as  knowledge  becomes 
stronger.   Linville  (1982)   noted  that  indi-
viduals with complex knowledge structures 
regarding a topic are more likely to include 
both unfavorable and favorable attributes in 
their descriptions of the topic, and to inte-
grate apparently conﬂ icting information into 
a  common  description  (see  also   Gardberg 
and Newburry, 2009 ). As such, individuals 
who are more familiar with a ﬁ rm may use 
this familiarity to make supportive behavior 
decisions,  which  would  lessen  the  need  to 
rely on reputation as a decision cue. Accord-
ingly, we suggest the following hypothesis: 

 H7:   

     The reputation- supportive behavior rela-
tionship is moderated by familiarity such 
that the relationship will be less positive 
for ﬁ rms that are more  familiar.

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

studied  by  the  Reputation  Institute  in 
association  with  The  Foro  de  Reputacion 
Corporativa:  Spain,  Argentina,  Chile, 
Colombia,  Brazil,  Mexico,  Peru  and  Vene-
zuela. The analyses contained herein are based 
upon data collected for this project between 
January  2006  and  July  2008.     Question-
naire items were based upon the Reputation 
Institute ’ s  reputation  survey  that  aims  to 
measure multiple aspects of corporate repu-
tations.  Respondents  were  identiﬁ ed  from 
the  respondent  pool  of  a  well-established 
data collection agency operating in all of the 
study countries. To be eligible for the study, 
potential  respondents  were  screened  to 
determine if they met the minimal require-
ment  of  being  at  least  somewhat  familiar 
with the focal company of evaluation based 
on their ability to answer three out of four 
general  questions  regarding  the  company 
( Asher, 2004 ). In this context, awareness or 
familiarity with a company reﬂ ects the inci-
dence rate within the population. The pop-
ulation  of  respondents  was  also  targeted  to 
be  representative  of  the  general  population 
of each country in terms of gender and age. 
Questionnaires were administered via com-
puter  assisted  telephone  interviews  in  the 
local language of the respondent (Spanish or 
Portuguese). For the purpose of this analysis, 
this procedure produced a total of 117,195 
usable responses. Study companies represent 
a broad spectrum of industries operating in 
Latin America, and mirror major investment 
trends  in  the  region,  which  were  driven 
largely by deregulation and privatization in 
several  sectors  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s 
(eg,  Casanova, 2005 ).  

 Dependent Variable 
  Company  Supportive  Behavior   was  measured 
using the following three items, which cor-
respond  to   Khanna  and  Palepu’s  (1997)  
product, ﬁ nancial and labor markets. Given 
strong collinearity across the items, a compos-
ite supportive behavior variable was created. 
Analyses  conﬁ rmed  the  unidimensionality, 

convergent validity and ﬁ t of the scale items 
(Alpha    =    0.820; Factor Analysis Eigenvalue    = 
2.213, explaining 73.776 percent of variance), 
which  was  also  found  to  be  equivalent  in 
each country.   

   1.   I would purchase the products / services of 

[Company]. 

   2.   I would invest in [Company]. 
   3.   I would work at [Company].     

 Independent Variables 
  Corporate Reputation  ( H1 ) is measured using 
the following four general items used by the 
Reputation Institute to gage a ﬁ rm ’ s overall 
reputation. Multiple authors have found that 
items measuring general perceptions tend to 
have  greater  face  validity  across  cultures 
than  more  speciﬁ c  culturally  derived  items 
( Scandura   et  al. ,  2001 ;   Newburry   et  al. , 
2008 ). Respondents evaluated the items on 
a 7-point scale, where  ‘ 1 ’  indicates  ‘ I  strongly 
disagree ’  and  ‘ 7 ’  indicates  ‘ I strongly agree ’ . 
Respondents also had the option to indicate 
 ‘ Not Sure ’ . LISREL analyses conﬁ rmed the 
unidimensionality,  convergent  validity  and 
ﬁ t  of  the  scale  items.  As  interpretation  of 
items can vary across cultures (eg,  Gardberg, 
2006 ), the factor structure for the four items 
was evaluated in each country and found to 
be equivalent. 

 The  items  contained  in  this  measure  are 

as following:   

   1.   [Company] has a good overall reputation; 
   2.   [Company]  is  a  company  I  have  a  good 

feeling about; 

   3.   [Company] is a company that I trust; 
   4.   [Company]  is  a  company  that  I  admire 

and respect.     

 Interaction Effects 
 To test hypotheses 2 – 7, multiplicative inter-
actions were created between our company 
reputation measure and each of the follow-
ing  variables.  Company  foreignness  and 
other  data  were  obtained  primarily  from

company annual reports, and supplemented 
when  needed  with  data  from  the  Econo-
matica,  Mergent  and  Hoover ’ s  Online 
databases. 

  Foreign  HQ   ( H2 )  is  a  dichotomous  vari-
able, coded  ‘ 1 ’  if a ﬁ rm ’ s headquarters was 
located  outside  the  country  where  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
reputation  was  being  evaluated  and   ‘ 0 ’   if 
located in the focal country. 

  International  scope   ( H3 )  measures  a  re-
spondent ’ s perception of the scope of a ﬁ rm ’ s 
international activities, based upon the item: 
 ‘ [Company] has an international scope ’ , with 
responses ranging from 1 (Does not describe 
well) to 7 (Describes very well). 

  Industry   effects  ( H4 )  were  tested  for  the 
 Telecom ,   Financial   and   Energy   industries. 
These  industries  mirror  the  major  invest-
ment  trends  in  the  region,  which  were 
driven largely by deregulation and privatiza-
tion in several sectors in the late 1980s and 
1990s (eg,  Casanova, 2005 ). 

  Return  on  assets   ( H5 )  indicates  the  2006 
ratio of net income over total assets for the 
company. 

  Local  tenure   ( H6 )  is  measured  as  the 
number of years that a ﬁ rm had operated in 
a  particular  market  at  the  time  of  survey 
administration. 

  Familiarity   ( H7 )  with  a  company  was 
measured using the item,  ‘ I am familiar with 
[Company] ’ , with responses ranging from 1 
(Not at all familiar) to 4 (Very familiar). As 
respondents  needed  to  meet  a  familiarity 
threshold to be included in the sample, re-
sponses  for  this  variable  are  highly  biased 
toward the top end of the scale.   

 Control Variables 
 While  the  hierarchical  linear  modeling 
(HLM)    nature of the analysis (see next sub-
section)  controls  for  ﬁ xed  effects  at  the 
country  and  company  levels,  the  following 
individual-,  company-  and  country-level 
controls  were  added.  Respondent  demo-
graphic  characteristics  were  controlled  for 
based  upon  self-reported  data.   Gender   is 

dichotomous, coded  ‘ 1 ’  for females and  ‘ 0 ’  
for males.  Respondent age  is categorical, rang-
ing from  ‘ 1 ’  if under 18 to  ‘ 10 ’  if over 60. 
Respondents under 18 were eliminated from 
the  sample.   Education   is  categorical,  coded 
 ‘ 1 ’  if less than a basic education (eg, elemen-
tary  school)  ranging  to   ‘ 7 ’   if  completed 
graduate school. As standards of living differ 
signiﬁ cantly across countries within the sam-
ple,  different  scale  responses  were  used  in 
each  study  country  to  examine   Household 
income . For the purpose of this analysis, these 
responses  have  been  standardized  to  allow 
inclusion of different countries in the same 
dataset.  Thus,  this  variable  is  coded   ‘ 1 ’   for 
low  income,   ‘ 2 ’   for  mid-level  income  and 
 ‘ 3 ’   for  afﬂ uent.  Additional  individual-level 
control variables included dummies for cas-
es  in  which  respondents  were  surveyed  in 
years   2007   and   2008   (compared  to  a  base 
year of 2006). 

  Firm  sales   indicates  the  2006  sales  for  a 
company. In addition to the industries stud-
ied in  H4 , additional industry controls were 
included  for  the   Retail   and   Food / Beverage  
industries,  with   Other   industries  serving  as 
the excluded industry variable. 

  GDP  per  capita  (GDPpc)   measures  the 
gross  domestic  product  for  each  country 
divided  by 
the  population.  Additional 
controls  were  considered  for   Hofstede’s 
(2001)   cultural  dimensions,  as  these  have 
been  shown  to  impact  reputation  assess-
ments  ( Deephouse   et  al. ,  2009 ).  However, 
these were not included due to the limited 
variance across the study countries, most of 
which  was  already  captured  by  the   GDPpc  
variable. Strong correlations of three dimen-
sions  with   GDPpc   also  created  collinearity 
problems.   

 Analysis 
 As our analysis involved a hierarchical data 
structure with nested data ( Hitt  et al. , 2007 ), 
we  used  the  hierarchical  linear  modeling 
program  HLM6  ( Raudenbush   et  al. ,  2004 ) 
to  compute  a  model  with  three  data  levels

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

(individual  within  company  within  coun-
try). The approach of examining reputation 
from  multiple  analysis  levels  is  consistent 
with  Barnett and Hoffman (2008) , who re-
cently noted the multi-level nature of repu-
tation.  While  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS) 
regression  is  often  used  for  analyses  of  this 
type,  OLS  does  not  account  for  the  inter-
dependence  of  individual-level  data  being 
nested  within  higher  levels  of  observation. 
To minimize multicollinearity, we standard-
ized and centered the direct effects prior to 
creating  the  moderating  effects,  with  the 
exception of the binary variables in a man-
ner consistent with  Joshi  et al.  (2006) .    

 RESULTS 
  Table  1   presents  descriptive  statistics  and 
correlations for our study variables. Due to 
our large sample size, most variables appear 
statistically  signiﬁ cantly  correlated.  Foreign 
headquartered ﬁ rms account for 51 percent 
of our sample. In addition to coming from 
within  the  eight  study  countries  (eg,  Tele-
fonica,  a  Spanish  ﬁ rm,  being  evaluated  in 
Mexico), foreign headquartered ﬁ rms came 
from  the  United  States,  the  United  King-
dom,  France,  Germany,  Canada,  Switzer-
land and Luxembourg. All ﬁ rms sold products 
or services, and operated facilities in the host 
country where they were evaluated. 

  Table 2  presents the basic models used to 
test  hypotheses  1 – 7.  All  models  have  sig-
niﬁ cant  Chi-square  statistics  ( p     <    0.001).  In 
order  to  test  for  multicollinearity,  we  re-
computed  each  study  model  using  OLS 
regression.  Variance  inﬂ ation  factors  for 
these models were all 3.0 or below, suggest-
ing  that  multicollinearity  is  not  a  concern 
( Netter  et al. , 1996 ). 

 Model 1 is used to test our direct reputa-
tion hypothesis on supportive behavior pri-
or  to  adding  interaction  effects.  As  can  be 
seen in this model, reputation assessment is 
strongly  associated  with  the  stated  propen-
sity  to  pursue  ﬁ rm  supportive  behavior. 
Thus,  H1  is supported.  

 Interaction Effects 
 Models 2 – 4 separately introduce the interac-
tion effects for our foreignness, industry and 
local exposure hypotheses. Model 5 includes 
all  the  interaction  effects  at  once.  When 
interpreting the interaction results, note that 
these reﬂ ect changes from the base reputa-
tion-supportive behavior relationship, which 
was highly signiﬁ cant and positive. Thus, a 
negative interaction indicates that the over-
all slope of the reputation-supportive behav-
ior  relationship  is  less  positive  under  that 
condition (and not necessarily negative). 

 Looking ﬁ rst at our  foreignness  hypotheses, we 
see in Model 2 that both our foreign HQ ( H2 ; 
 p     <    0.05)  and  our  international  scope  ( H3 ; 
 p     <    0.001)  interactions  with  reputation  are  sig-
niﬁ cant in predicting supportive behavior, con-
sistent  with  our  hypotheses.  However,  in 
Model 5, only the international scope interac-
tion is signiﬁ cant. Thus, only  H3  is supported. 
 Regarding  our   industry   hypothesis  ( H4 ), 
in Model 3, we ﬁ nd positive signiﬁ cant cor-
relations for our reputation interactions with 
the telecom ( p     <    0.05) and ﬁ nancial ( p     <    0.001) 
industries,  consistent  with  our  hypothesis. 
However, we also ﬁ nd a negative signiﬁ cant 
correlation for the energy industry ( p     <    0.001), 
opposite to our hypothesis. This result will 
be examined in more detail in the discussion 
section, in which we divide this variable into 
energy exploration and energy provision in 
a post-hoc analysis (see Alternate Model 3). 
In  Model  5,  only  the  ﬁ nancial  and  energy 
industries  remain  signiﬁ cant.  Thus,  this 
hypothesis received mixed support.

 hypotheses, in Model 4, we ﬁ nd a negative

interaction,  and  thus,  no  support  for   H6 . 
Additionally,  we  ﬁ nd  a  strong  signiﬁ cant

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 In a multi-level analysis using 117,195 indi-
vidual  evaluations  of  125  companies,  we 
ﬁ nd  a  strong  direct  relationship  between 
reputation  and  supportive  behavior  in  the 
product, capital and labor markets. We also 
ﬁ nd  that  this  relationship  is  moderated  by 
variables related to foreignness, industry and 
local exposure. While previous research has 
examined the impact of reputation on sup-
portive behavior (eg,  Caruana  et al. , 2006 ), 
it  has  generally  examined  only  the  direct 
relationship,  without  considering  moderat-
ing factors. We help to ﬁ ll this research gap 
by conducting such an examination. 

 We  focused  on  the  labor,  ﬁ nancial  and 
product  markets  (eg,   Khanna  and  Palepu, 
1997 ) as our indicators of supportive behav-
ior, as these areas are often viewed as criti-
cal to ﬁ rm performance in emerging markets. 
Our basic argument suggested that individ-
uals  who  perceive  companies  as  having  a 
better  reputation  may  be  more  likely  to 
pursue behaviors that support these compa-
nies,  as  they  are  more  likely  to  perceive  a 
ﬁ t with these companies (eg,  Kristof, 1996 ; 
 Newburry  et al. , 2008 ). Overall, we found 
strong  support  for  a  direct  relationship 
between  reputation  and  supportive  behav-
ior. While this result was certainly expected, 
it nonetheless adds to the existing literature 
in this area, particularly given our relatively 
unstudied Latin American context.  

 Moderating Results 
 Looking  speciﬁ cally  at  our  moderating 
variables, our ﬁ rst two hypotheses addressed 
two important aspects of  foreignness : wheth-
er a ﬁ rm has a foreign headquarters and the 
degree  to  which  the  ﬁ rm  is  perceived  as 
having  an  international  scope.  Overall,  we 
found that both variables positively interact 
with  reputation  assessment  in  predicting 
supportive behavior, although the relation-
ship for foreign HQ is weak at best. These 
results are consistent with our hypothesized 
suggestion  that  individuals  will  rely  on 

reputation in determining whether to pursue 
supportive behaviors more for foreign ﬁ rms 
(either because of a foreign HQ or because 
of a larger portion of their operations outside 
a  home  country)  than  domestic  ﬁ rms.  It  is 
also  noteworthy  that  the  direct  effects 
for these variables were both signiﬁ cant, but 
in  opposite  directions.  Consistent  with 
 Newburry  et al.  (2006) , in their examination 
of foreignness and workplace attractiveness, 
our respondents were less likely to support 
ﬁ rms with a foreign HQ, while being more 
likely  to  support  more  international  ﬁ rms. 
Our  study  contributes  to  the  liability  of 
foreignness  literature  by  demonstrating  a 
moderating  impact  of  foreignness  above 
and  beyond  the  direct  effects  found  by 
previous scholars (eg,  Zaheer, 1995 ;  Mezias, 
2002 ). 

 Regarding  industry , we suggested that the 
reputation-supportive  behavior  relationship 
is moderated by industry such that the rela-
tionship will be more positive for industries 
subject to greater public scrutiny (herein, the 
telecom, ﬁ nancial and energy industries). In 
the  context  of  Latin  America  and  Spain, 
certain industries, such as telecom, ﬁ nancial 
and  energy,  have  received  particular  atten-
tion, driven largely by deregulation and pri-
vatization in several sectors in the late 1980s 
and  1990s  (eg,   Casanova,  2005 ).  We  sug-
gested  that  in  these  industries,  individuals 
will  look  toward  reputation  to  a  greater 
extent  when  making  supportive  behavior 
decisions since other information cues may 
not be easily available, or may be discount-
ed due to rapid change. In our analyses, we 
found  positive  signiﬁ cant  correlations  for 
our reputation interactions with the telecom 
and ﬁ nancial industries, consistent with our 
expectations. Thus, the reputation- supportive 
behavior relationship is stronger in the tel-
ecom and ﬁ nancial industries. In the telecom 
and  ﬁ nancial  industries,  consumers  have 
direct exposure to companies via their pro-
vision  of  services,  and  they  also  have  the 
opportunity  to  make  an  active  choice  of

service provider. Thus, ﬁ rm reputation may 
be  useful  for  them  in  their  decision  proc-
esses. Given the negative attention they have 
received  in  the  media,  it  is  not  surprising 
that  the  direct  relationships  for  both  the 
ﬁ nancial  ( p     <    0.001)  and  telecom  ( p     <    0.05) 
industries were negative. 

 By contrast, we found a negative signiﬁ -
cant  correlation  for  the  energy  industry, 
suggesting  a  weaker  reputation-supportive 
behavior  relationship.  In  order  to  better 
understand  our  energy  industry  results,  we 
divided the companies in this category into 
two groups  –  companies primarily involved 
in  energy  exploration  and  those  primarily 
involved in energy provision. These results 
are reported in  Table 2 , Alternate Model 3. 
When  this  distinction  is  made,  the  energy 
exploration  interaction  is  not  signiﬁ cant, 
suggesting  that  these  companies  follow  the 
same  base  reputation-supportive  behavior 
relationship  found  in   H1 .  We  also  re-ran 
these results eliminating Petrobras from the 
sample due to its strong reputation in Brazil. 
When  Petrobras  is  excluded,  the  energy 
exploration 
approach  marginal 
signiﬁ cance ( p     <    0.128) in a positive  direction, 
consistent  with  the  results  found  for  the 
telecom and ﬁ nancial industries. In contrast 
to energy exploration, the energy provision 
interaction is signiﬁ cant ( p     <    0.001) and neg-
ative. In energy provision, it is noteworthy 
that consumers often have little direct inter-
action  with  companies  and  the  provider 
often  has  a  monopoly,  which  limits  con-
sumer choice. Other peculiarities regarding 
energy provision, such as government regu-
lations  regarding  pricing,  could  also  be 
inﬂ uencing this result. 

results 

 Our last set of hypotheses dealt with fac-
tors  related  to   local  exposure   of  a  company 
within  a  marketplace.  In  these  hypotheses, 
we  suggested  that  company  proﬁ tability, 
company familiarity and company tenure in 
the local market all have important signaling 
effects,  which  may  impact  the  reputation-
supportive behavior relationship. 

 Regarding proﬁ tability, we found a neg-
ative signiﬁ cant reputation interaction with 
ROA,  consistent  with  our  expectations. 
 McGuire   et  al.   (1988)   found  that  ROA 
served an important signaling function. Giv-
en the amount of information that ﬁ nancial 
performance  provides,  our  results  are  con-
sistent  with  the  argument  that  reputation 
cues will be less informative for ﬁ rms with 
high  proﬁ tability  since  individuals  possess 
another  objective  basis  on  which  to  make 
supportive behavior decisions. We found no 
signiﬁ cant  direct  effect  for  ROA  in  our 
analyses. 

 We  found  no  signiﬁ cant  relationship  for 
our  local  years  interaction.  According  to 
 Stinchcombe’s  (1965)   liability  of  newness, 
new  organizations  have  to  learn  new  roles 
inside the organization as well as in a soci-
ety. Public perceptions of ﬁ rms are affected 
by  ﬁ rms ’   relationships  with  both  the  gen-
eral  public  and  local  institutions,  which 
length  of  tenure  in  the  local  market  helps 
provide. As such, we expected local tenure 
to  provide  information  cues  that  lessen 
the need to rely on corporate reputation in 
making supportive behavior decisions. Our 
insigniﬁ cant result may stem from the com-
position of our sample. As the average local 
tenure of ﬁ rms in our sample was very high 
(58 years as of 2006), most ﬁ rms may have 
passed the point where a liability of newness 
exists.  We  also  found  no  signiﬁ cant  direct 
effect for local tenure in our analyses.

interaction, contrary to our hypothesis. Our 
contrary result may have stemmed from the 
knowledge  threshold  required  to  become 
part  of  our  sample.  As  only  individuals 
reaching  a  speciﬁ c  knowledge  threshold 
were  surveyed,  they  may  have  passed  the 
point where additional knowledge serves as 
a  beneﬁ t  in  terms  of  making  supportive 
behavior decisions. After a certain threshold, 
too  much  knowledge  may  even  confuse 
respondents, causing them to rely more on

 Reputation and Supportive Behavior 

reputation.  However,  this  interpretation  is 
highly  speculative  and  certainly  worthy  of 
further  study.  It  is  noteworthy  that  in 
contrast  to  our  other  two  local  exposure 
variables,  familiarity  has  a  strong  positive 
( p     <    0.001) direct effect in our analyses.   

 Theoretical Contributions 
 Organizations  depend  upon  external  con-
stituencies  for  revenue,  capital,  labor,  etc. 
Yet,  relatively 
little  research  examines 
important  factors  that  cause  these  external 
constituencies  to  pursue  behaviors  that  are 
supportive  of  the  ﬁ rm.  By  examining  a 
major outcome of reputation, organization-
al supportive behavior, this manuscript helps 
address  Fombrun and Shanley’s (1990: 235)  
suggestion  that   ‘ reputational  consequences 
are  also  worthy  of  considerable  attention 
in future research ’ . 

 More  speciﬁ cally,  our  research  helps 
inform  the  literature  on  reputation  impacts 
on  supportive  behavior  by  examining  three 
important categories of moderating variables 
that  have  important  signaling  properties  in 
terms  of  impacting  an  individual ’ s  relative 
usage  of  reputation  in  their  supportive  be-
havior decision making. We build upon the 
liability of foreignness (eg,  Zaheer, 1995 ), the 
industry  effects  (eg,   Barnett  and  Hoffman, 
2008 ;  Winn  et al. , 2008 ) and the knowledge 
(local  exposure)  literatures  (eg,   Ross  and 
Nisbett, 1991 ) by demonstrating the impor-
tance of these three variable types. 

 We also contribute to our understanding 
of  reputation  in  the  largely  understudied 
Latin  American  region.  As  MNC  invest-
ment into Latin America increased dramati-
cally during the 1990s ( Robles  et al. , 2003 ; 
 Casanova,  2005 ),  the  theoretical  relevance 
of  examining  the  impacts  of  foreignness, 
industry  changes  and  local  knowledge  of 
ﬁ rms has increased signiﬁ cantly.   

 Managerial Implications 
 Clarifying  the  conditions  under  which  the 
reputation-supportive  behavior  linkage  is 

particularly strong or relatively weak is also 
an important goal in terms of advising ﬁ rms 
in their behavior. Understanding factors that 
impact  the  reputation-supportive  behavior 
relationship  may  help  managers  to  better 
address the triggers that impact their success. 
While some factors cannot be easily changed 
(eg,  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  foreignness  or  its  industry), 
knowing  the  inﬂ uence  of  these  factors  can 
suggest  strategies  to  counteract  them  (such 
as  making  extra  efforts  to  become  more 
embedded in local marketplaces).   

 Limitations and Directions 
for Future Research 
 We also acknowledge that there are limita-
tions  to  our  study  that  provide  future 
research opportunities. First, reputation is a 
multidimensional construct, and as such, dif-
ferent dimensions of reputation could have 
differential impacts on supportive behavior. 
Future research might examine these differ-
ences. Second, the Latin American context 
is  increasingly  recognized  as  being  less  ho-
mogeneous  than  commonly  perceived  (eg, 
 Lenartowicz and Johnson, 2003 ; Crane and 
Rizowy, 2005   ). Accordingly, future research 
might further dive into country-level differ-
ences  with  respect  to  the  relationship  be-
tween  reputation  and  supportive  behavior. 
Third, this study is cross- sectional and future 
research  can  investigate  how  changes  in 
reputation  over  time  affect  supportive  be-
havior toward MNCs. Fourth, some of our 
measures could be developed further in fu-
ture  work,  in  particular,  our  measures  of 
company familiarity and international scope 
perceptions. Regarding our familiarity vari-
able, future studies could examine familiar-
ity  effects  in  a  sample  including  a  greater 
range of respondents. Regarding our inter-
national  scope  measure,  future  research 
could  examine  multiple  dimensions  of  this 
construct.  Fifth,  our  supportive  behavior 
measures  could  be  developed  further  in 
future  work,  and / or  supplemented  with

 In  summary,  clarifying  the  conditions 
under  which 
reputation-supportive 
behavior  linkage  is  particularly  strong  or 
relatively weak is an important goal in terms 
of  advising  ﬁ rms  in  their  behavior.  By 
examining these factors in terms of a ﬁ rm ’ s 
foreignness,  its  industry  and  its  local  expo-
sure, we believe we have contributed to the 
supportive  behavior  literature,  which  until 
now has primarily examined the direct rep-
utation-supportive  behavior  relationship, 
without  considering  moderating  effects. 
By  examining  these  issues  in  seven  Latin 
 American  countries  and  Spain,  we  believe 
we have added to existing knowledge, while 
also  helping  to  inform  and  clarify  existing 
supportive  behavior  theories,  which  were 
originally  formulated  primarily  in  English-
speaking developed world contexts.
