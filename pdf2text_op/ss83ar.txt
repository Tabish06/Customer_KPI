 Market Response to Environmental

 Information Produced Outside

 the Firm

 Philip B. Shane and Barry H. Spicer

 ABSTRACT: Over the last ten years, large corporations have significantly increased
 their voluntary disclosures of socially-oriented information in annual reports. External
 organizations such as the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP) also have been active
 in producing information bearing on firms' social performances-particularly with
 respect to pollution control. This study investigates whether security price movements are
 associated with the release of externally produced information about companies' per-
 formances in the pollution-control area-information which has attributes of consistency
 and comparability not typically found in voluntarily reported, socially-oriented data.
 Specifically, the study investigates security price movements associated with the release
 of eight major studies conducted by the CEP of firms' environmental performances in four
 industries. The observed price movements are consistent with changes in investors'
 perceptions of the probability distributions of future cash flows of the sample firms at the
 times of release of the CEP studies. The reported results also are consistent with investors
 using the information released by the CEP to discriminate between companies with
 different pollution-control performance records.

 O VER the last decade, numerous
 proposals have been made for
 accountants to develop methods

 to measure and report on corporate social
 performance [Beams and Fertig, 1971;
 Abt, 1972; Linowes, 1968 and 1972;
 Brummet, 1973; Bedford, 1973; Estes,
 1975; Seidler, 1975; and Spicer, 1978b].
 Several attempts also have been made to
 develop a normative theory of account-
 ing for corporate social performance
 [Churchill, 1974; Estes, 1976; and
 Ramanathan, 1976]. In addition, the
 form and content of corporate disclosures
 of socially-oriented data have been the
 subject of a series of public hearings and
 pronouncements by the Securities and
 Exchange Commission (SEC) [see SEC,
 1973, 1975, and 1976], as well as the topic
 of committee deliberations and reports
 by the three major accounting associa-

 tions in the U.S.A.-the American Ac-
 counting Association [1973, 1974, 1975,
 and 1976], the National Association of
 Accountants [1974], and the American
 Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 [1972, 1977].

 Over the same period, large corpora-
 tions significantly increased their volun-
 tary disclosures of information about

 their social performances in published
 annual reports.1 In addition, a number of
 external organizations such as the Coun-
 cil on Economic Priorities (CEP) were
 formed in the U.S.A. to collect and dis-
 seminate information bearing on the
 social performances of corporations.2

 As a consequence of these events, a

 number of recent empirical studies have
 investigated the general question of
 whether investors and/or creditors have
 found socially-oriented disclosures useful
 for investment decision making. These
 studies have involved: (1) surveys of
 institutional investors' demands for so-
 cially-oriented information [Longstreth
 and Rosenbloom, 1973; Buzby and Falk,
 1978 and 1979]; (2) association tests
 between various measures of firms' social
 performances and the overall desirability
 of their securities for investment pur-
 poses as measured either by accounting
 numbers [Bragdon and Marlin, 1972;
 Bowman and Haire, 1975; Preston, 1978;
 Spicer, 1978a; and Trotman and Bradley,
 1981] or by stock market performance
 [Moskowitz, 1972; Vance, 1975; Alex-
 ander and Buchholz, 1978; and Spicer,
 1978a and 1978c]; and (3) tests for stock
 market reactions to voluntary disclosures
 by corporations of information bearing
 on their social performances [Belkaoui,
 1976; Ingram, 1978; and Anderson and
 Frankle, 1980].

 gested by Spicer [1978a, 1980], Chen and
 Metcalf [1980], and Buzby and Falk
 [1980], there may be other explanations
 for the observed correlations. To the
 extent that there are other explanations
 for the associations, social performance
 information may not be of value to in-
 vestors in assessing investment worth
 because the same information is available
 from more traditional and readily avail-
 able sources.3

 The purpose of this paper is to investi-
 gate the question of potential information
 content of socially-oriented disclosures
 more directly by investigating security
 price behavior associated with the release
 and publication of corporate social per-
 formance information produced outside
 the firm. The source of this externally
 produced information is the Council on
 Economic Priorities (CEP), a non-profit
 organization. Since its formation, the
 CEP has published a number of studies
 ranging from investigation of companies'
 employment practices to assessments of
 their performances with respect to en-
 vironmental matters. Our interest is in
 the socially-oriented disclosures made by
 the CEP in eight major studies of the
 pollution-control records and costs of
 abatement of companies in four impor-
 tant industries in the U.S.A.: pulp and

 Taken as a whole, these studies provide
 only limited support for the proposition
 that investors find disclosures of some
 socially-oriented data useful for invest-
 ment decision making. In particular, all
 the association tests referred to in item
 (2) above are subject to the limitation
 that while social performance and various
 measures of investment worth appear to
 be correlated, it is not clear that investors
 actually make use of available social
 performance information in making in-
 vestment decisions. As has been sug-

 ' The wide extent of these voluntary disclosures by
 companies in the U.S.A. is documented in a series of
 annual Ernst and Whinney surveys of social responsibil-
 ity disclosures of the Fortune 500. Recent surveys of
 British, European, and Australian companies reveal a
 similar trend towards increased disclosures of socially-
 oriented data in annual reports (see Dierkes and Cop-
 pock [1978], Lessem [1979], and Trotman [1979]).

 2 A detailed discussion of the functions of the CEP
 and other organizations with similar purposes is con-
 tained in CEP [1973, pp. 47-54]. The most detailed,
 consistent, and comparable data bearing on corporate
 social performance has been published by the CEP. It
 appears to be the most active external producer of infor-
 mation in this area.

 the literature, see Shane [1982, pp. 12-24].

 paper, electric power, iron and steel, and
 petroleum. These industries had been
 identified as a significant source of en-
 vironmental pollution and as industries
 requiring the largest expenditures to
 achieve compliance with environmental
 regulations [Council on Environmental
 Quality, 1974, p. 233-236]. The informa-
 tion published in these eight CEP studies
 is the best source of consistently pre-
 pared, externally produced social perfor-
 mance information currently available.

 In keeping with its objectives of influ-
 encing consumer and investor behavior
 (and implicitly the behavior of regulators)
 through its studies, the CEP released each
 of its eight reports with considerable
 publicity at news conferences and, in
 some cases, meetings of security analysts
 in New York City. Each study was
 extensively reported on in the Wall Street
 Journal and/or the New York Times im-
 mediately following the public release of
 the information in the report by the CEP
 (see Table 1 for details). While it cannot
 be argued that the disclosures made by
 the CEP are free from bias or measure-
 ment error, the CEP reports have gener-
 ally been regarded with respect for the
 care taken to present factual information.
 For example, Time Magazine (December
 28, 1970) in a review of the first CEP
 study gave the following description of
 the CEP and its reports:

 ... the CEP report is as dry and statistic
 laden as a stock prospectus ... Now,
 C.E.P. has about 800 subscribers for its
 regular research publications-includ-
 ing banks, investment houses, founda-
 tions, universities, and more than 40
 corporations.... Borrowing the meth-
 ods of securities analysts, the Council's
 staff of 20 interviews company officials,
 spot-checks the results for accuracy (both
 in the field and with outside specialists)
 and then compiles its surveys.... Its
 philosophy is just to present unadorned,
 hitherto unavailable facts.

 Until now the only security price
 studies dealing with social accounting-
 type information have concentrated on
 voluntary disclosures.4 Both Ingram
 [1978] and Anderson and Frankle [1980],
 for example, made use of the annual
 Ernst and Whinney compilations of vol-
 untary disclosures made by the Fortune
 500. While these studies provide some
 support for the proposition that socially-
 oriented disclosures are valued in the
 market, their results are severely limited
 by the imprecise, ambiguous, and often
 self-serving nature of the voluntary dis-
 closures investigated. These two types of
 social accounting disclosures, voluntary
 and externally produced, differ in impor-
 tant ways. In the absence of mandated
 disclosure and reporting standards, vol-
 untary disclosures tend to be inconsistent
 and non-comparable from firm to firm,
 even within the same industry. On the
 other hand, externally produced infor-
 mation (at least as produced by the CEP)
 was gathered using consistent procedures
 for collection and reporting across firms.
 Comparisons across firms are thereby
 possible and potentially meaningful. In
 addition, much more detailed social per-
 formance information is available from
 the CEP reports than is typically avail-
 able in voluntary disclosures by firms in
 their annual reports.

 In summary, therefore, this paper in-
 vestigates whether security price move-
 ments were associated with the release of
 externally produced information about
 companies' pollution-control records and
 their costs for coming into compliance
 with currently promulgated standards. If
 no security price movements are found to
 be associated with the release of this
 externally produced information, then

 pirical research on the capital market effects of voluntary
 social disclosures from an accounting perspective is given

 the value to the market of consistent and
 comparable social accounting informa-
 tion of the sort published by the CEP will
 be open to serious question. If, on the
 other hand, significant price associations
 are detected, then the way is open for
 further study of the association between
 various kinds of social accounting infor-
 mation and security prices.

 The next section of this paper discusses
 related hypotheses as to why an associ-
 ation between stock price movements and
 the release of CEP studies might be ex-
 pected. Sample selection and data collec-
 tion are discussed in the third section.
 Test procedures and results are presented
 in the fourth section. The paper closes
 with a brief summary and conclusion.

 HYPOTHESES

 It is hypothesized that the release of the
 CEP reports will be found to be associ-
 ated with an overall movement in the
 share prices of those firms reported on.
 Finding such a movement could reason-
 ably be interpreted as evidence that the
 releases of the reports were associated
 with changes in investors' perceptions of
 probability distributions of future cash
 flows to the firms involved.

 Investors' perceptions could be af-
 fected in at least two related ways. First,
 the studies may have had a "disclosure
 effect" resulting from new information
 being made available to investors about
 how close individual firms were to meet-
 ing minimum standards currently pre-
 scribed by pollution-control laws. It
 seems likely that this was the case. The
 evaluations contained in the CEP studies
 are the only extensive evaluations of the
 studied companies' pollution-control rec-
 ords available. Also, the criteria used by
 the CEP to rate the overall efficacy of
 companies' pollution-control systems
 correspond fairly closely to legislative
 requirements promulgated under the

 Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 and
 the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
 Amendments of 1972. Conceivably, there-
 fore, the information supplied by the CEP
 in these reports could have altered inves-
 tors' perceptions of the probability distri-
 bution of future expenditures to meet
 current mandated abatement standards.
 The expected direction of this possible
 effect depends on the expectations inves-
 tors had formed from other sources prior
 to the release of the CEP studies. If a
 CEP study revealed that a firm was
 further from compliance than originally
 perceived by investors (thereby revealing
 information about future capital and
 operating costs of compliance), then the
 sign of any disclosure effect should be
 negative. This is considered to be the most
 likely possibility.5 Only if a particular
 firm was revealed to be closer to being in
 compliance than originally perceived by
 investors would the expected sign of any
 disclosure effect be positive. However,
 because of this latter possibility, we use
 two-tailed tests for testing purposes.

 In addition to any disclosure effect of
 information reported by the CEP there
 may also be a related "regulatory effect."
 This is possible if investors perceived the
 acts of information dissemination by the
 CEP as events that increased the proba-
 bilities that stricter regulatory enforce-
 ment and more stringent sanctions could
 be applied to the studied firms. There are
 reasons to believe that the release of the

 5 There are two reasons. First, during the time-
 period in which the CEP released its reports, many
 companies in the industries studied mounted extensive
 public-relations campaigns to present themselves in a
 favorable light regarding their degree of compliance
 with pollution-control regulations. These campaigns
 appear to have been specifically designed to leave the
 impression that particular firms were closer to being in
 compliance than was actually the case. Second, based on
 a reading of the various publications of the CEP, it is
 clear that one reason the CEP undertook these studies
 was because of a belief that the public perception of the
 level of compliance of firms in the four industries studied
 was too high.

 CEP reports could have been viewed this
 way. The time-period over which the
 CEP published these studies was a period
 of considerable public and media pres-
 sure for environmental protection and
 pollution abatement (see Coppock, et al.
 [1972] and Evans [1975] for confirming
 evidence). Based on the estimated eco-
 nomic impacts of major pollution-con-
 trol initiatives on the industries selected
 for study by the CEP (see Council on
 Environmental Quality [1972, p. 287;
 1973, p. 92; and 1974, p. 175]), it seems
 reasonable to hypothesize that investors
 could have viewed the extensive news-
 paper reports of the CEP studies as sig-
 nals of increased regulatory activity with
 respect to the studied companies. The
 perceived threat of stricter enforcement
 and costly sanctions may have been suffi-
 cient to induce an adverse stock market
 reaction.

 investors may use the same information
 to assess which companies may be subject
 to stricter scrutiny and costlier enforce-
 ment actions by regulators. In either
 case, investors can only assess these
 possibilities through information bearing
 on individual companies' pollution-con-
 trol records. If this view is correct, then
 a differential market response to firms
 receiving a relatively high as compared
 to a relatively low pollution-control
 performance rating (based on the infor-
 mation released by the CEP) also should
 be observed. Therefore, it is hypothe-
 sized that firms receiving relatively low
 ratings will suffer, on average, a more
 adverse price movement than those re-
 ceiving a higher rating on or about the
 release dates of the CEP reports. This
 directional hypothesis will be tested
 using one-tailed tests of significance.

 Both of these related effects are poten-
 tially relevant for reporting and account-
 ing purposes. The disclosure effect is
 relevant because the CEP disclosures
 may alter investors' perceptions of a com-
 pany's future expenditures to meet man-
 dated abatement standards. Similarly,
 the regulatory effect is relevant because

 of the studies. Table 1 provides the dates
 of each newspaper report and the column
 inches devoted to each story.

 The numbers of sample companies
 identified from each CEP study also are
 given in Table 1. Two studies were con-
 ducted in each industry: pulp and paper
 [CEP, 1970 and 1972a]; electric power
 [CEP, 1972b and 1977b]; iron and steel
 [CEP, 1974 and 1977a]; and petroleum
 [CEP, 1975a and 1975b]. The second
 study in each case was either a follow-up
 or a sequel to the initial report. Only firms
 that were included in both the initial and
 follow-up reports were eligible for in-
 clusion in the sample. This criterion
 reduced the number of eligible firms in
 Power II from 15 to ten; other studies
 were unaffected. This selection criterion
 was adopted so that any price movements
 associated with the release of the four ini-
 tial reports and the four follow-up
 reports could be considered separately,
 while at the same time retaining a basis
 for a comparison of the observed reac-
 tions to each set of studies. The number
 of firms eligible from each CEP study and
 the number of firms remaining in our
 sample after the application of further
 exclusion criteria (to be discussed below)
 are shown in the last two columns of
 Table 1.

 The Test Period

 The test period selected was a six-day
 trading period around the release date
 for each CEP report. For consistency, the
 date of the Wall Street Journal account
 was set as day zero, with one exception-
 in the case of Power II, the date of the
 New York Times article was set as day
 zero because the Power II study was not
 reported in the Wall Street Journal.

 This short, six-day test period was
 selected for two reasons. The first in-
 volves market efficiency. If there was an
 aggregate investor reaction to the release

 of the CEP reports due to either disclo-
 sure or regulatory effects, or both, then
 the effect should be impounded into
 stock prices within a few days of the
 publication and release of each report.
 Unless there is serious concern about
 information leakage, searching over a
 longer time-period is not likely to be
 fruitful.

 The second reason involved a decision

 to trade-off length of test period in favor
 of sample size. Expansion of the test
 period much beyond the six-day period
 chosen would have resulted in a signifi-
 cant reduction of sample size due to the
 presence of other confounding events and
 news announcements for many of the
 companies in the sample.6 One disad-
 vantage of such a short test period is the
 possibility of not detecting some antici-
 patory price reactions due to information
 leakage. However, the choice of a six-day
 test period is still considered to be a
 reasonable one for two reasons: first,
 assurances were received from an official
 of the CEP that the information con-
 tained in each report had been controlled
 until the day of its release, and second,
 preliminary empirical work using a
 longer test period but a smaller sample
 (and a slightly different method) did not
 detect any significant price movements
 outside the six-day test period used here.
 For these reasons, the possibility of an-
 ticipatory price movements due to leaks
 was not considered to be of sufficient
 importance to significantly reduce sample
 size in favor of the length of the test
 period.

 Exclusion Criteria

 Selection of firms for the sample was
 based on several exclusion criteria de-
 signed to deal with the possibility of

 6 The presence of these other confounding events was

 determined by an extensive search of the Wall Street
 Journal Index.

 confounding events around the release
 dates of the CEP reports.7 A search for
 confounding events was conducted
 through the Wall Street Journal Index
 for each of the companies studied by the
 CEP in the eight-day period shown below.

 Search for confounding events

 6-day test period

 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3

 Based on a careful analysis of news
 announcements made on these days, the
 following exclusions were made:

 (1) Any firm found to have a "signifi-
 cant" news announcement (other
 than news of the release of the CEP
 report) on days -2, -1, 0, or 1 of the
 test period was removed from the
 sample entirely.

 (2) Any firm found to have a "signifi-
 cant" news announcement on either
 of days -4 or -3 was excluded from
 the sample only on those two days of
 the test period.

 (3) Any firm found to have a "signifi-
 cant" news announcement on days

 + 2 or + 3 was excluded from the
 sample only on days 0 and + 1 of the
 test period.

 Complete details of the effects of applying
 these exclusion criteria are given in Table
 2, together with the types of news an-
 nouncements considered to be "signifi-
 cant." Sample size was once again a
 primary consideration in selecting these
 exclusion criteria. This procedure, which
 was suggested by Foster [1980, p. 55],
 allows the retention of more observa-
 tions than if a complete exclusion ap-
 proach was followed in all cases.

 For criterion (2), the underlying as-
 sumption is that news announcements
 are rapidly impounded into stock prices
 and that any effect of a news announce-
 ment on days -4 or -3 would not carry
 over significantly into the remainder of
 the test period. For criterion (3), the
 underlying assumption is that any leak-

 ' The situation faced here is not one where cross-
 sectional aggregation in large samples for recurring
 releases (such as earnings or dividend announcements)
 can be relied upon to average-out the impact of other
 releases of information. For the eight C.EP reports
 investigated here, randomization over time and across
 industry takes place to only a very limited extent.

 event clustering, the problem of cross-
 sectional dependence is even more severe
 than in the Brown and Warner simula-
 tion.

 Making these exclusions leaves a rela-

 tively clear six-day test period. Finding a
 stock price movement associated with
 the release of the CEP reports on days
 -2, -1, or 0 would be consistent with
 our method of excluding firms due to
 other news announcements. Of the 103
 possible data points for each day of the
 test period (i.e., the overall number of
 firms studied by the CEP and eligible for
 inclusion in the sample), 65 are included
 on days -4 and -3, 72 on days -2 and
 -1, and 64 on days 0 and 1. Care was
 taken to ensure that tests on results for
 each day of the test period were con-
 structed in a way that specifically ad-
 justed for these differences in sample
 composition.8

 TESTS AND RESULTS

 Several test procedures which draw on
 work by Brown and Warner [19801,
 Jaffe [1974], Mandelker [1974], and
 Patell [1976] were used in the investiga-
 tion. A general problem faced when de-
 signing test procedures was that of cross-
 sectional dependence of sample firms'
 returns caused by firms experiencing an
 event at the same point in time. Here the
 subsamples of firms making up each of
 the CEP report groups cluster on the
 same event date. The result is a lack of
 cross-sectional independence among the
 returns for firms included in each CEP
 report group. Brown and Warner's [1980,
 p. 234] simulation results clearly demon-
 strate that unless this cross-sectional
 dependence is taken into account, the
 null hypothesis of no abnormal returns
 during the test period will be rejected too
 frequently when it is true. As our study is
 also characterized by industry as well as

 Development of Test Procedures

 In this investigation, tests were based

 primarily on mean-adjusted returns.
 Brown and Warner's study provides
 strong support for the use of the mean-
 adjusted return measure, as it was found
 by them to perform as well as or better
 than more sophisticated measures in a
 variety of circumstances.9 However, for
 completeness, all tests reported here were
 also performed using risk- and market-
 adjusted returns, using test statistics
 similar to those described below. All
 tests are based on daily returns and are
 explicitly designed to allow for cross-
 sectional dependence among sample se-
 curities' returns.

 All security returns were taken from

 the daily CRSP tapes. The estimation
 periods, crude adjustment periods'0 (to
 deal with cross-sectional correlation),
 .tnd test periods were laid out as shown
 in Figure 1.

 The 100-day estimation period was

 used to estimate expected returns:

 = 1 - 5

 (i) 100 t= E104 * 1

 8 Preliminary unpublished empirical work which
 followed a complete exclusion approach generated
 results similar to those reported later in the paper. This
 earlier work used a smaller sample size and a different
 method.

 9 Daily data are used in this study, whereas Brown
 and Warner's [1980] results are based on monthly data.
 However, there is no obvious reason to believe that the
 implications of their results would be altered by the use
 of daily data. Nonetheless, this is, as yet, an unanswered
 empirical question, and the results reported here should
 be interpreted with this in mind.

 10 The use of a crude adjustment period to deal with
 cross-sectional correlation is discussed in Brown and
 Warner [1980].

 the newspaper report. That price move-
 ments occurred on these two days is not
 particularly surprising given the manner
 in which the CEP released these reports.
 In at least three cases (Paper I, Steel I,
 and Paper II), news conferences and
 meetings of analysts to release the CEP
 reports were held on the day preceding
 the Wall Street Journal account of these
 reports. In one further case (Power I),
 the New York Times account preceded
 the Wall Street Journal account by one
 day.

 To test hypotheses about abnormal
 mean-adjusted returns during the test
 period, we formed group test statistics
 for all eight CEP reports taken together,
 then for the first four CEP reports (Paper
 I, Power I, Steel I, Oil I), and then for the
 second four CEP reports (Paper II,
 Power IIL Steel II, Oil II). Analyzing the
 first four and the second four CEP reports
 separately provides an opportunity to
 compare the market's reaction to each
 set of reports.

 Standardized average (across reports)
 abnormal mean-adjusted returns, Z, are
 shown in Table 3 for each day in the test
 period. From these results, it can be seen
 that firms included by the CEP in its
 eight studies experienced, on average,
 relatively large negative abnormal re-
 turns on days -2 and -1 of the test
 period, using one-day returns. The two-
 tailed probabilities of observing abnor-
 mal returns more extreme than these are
 .000 and .003, respectively. The observed
 negative abnormal returns are consistent
 with the hypothesis that there was, on
 average, a significant net price decrease
 associated with the release of the CEP
 studies.

 Several other observations and com-
 ments about these results are in order.
 First, significant price movements occur
 on the two days immediately preceding

 Notes: (a) The two-tailed level of significance associated
 with each abnormal return is given in the
 rounded brackets immediately below the ab-
 normal return to which it belongs.

 (b) The presence of a starred square bracket
 below an abnormal return on day -2 or - 1
 indicates that this abnormal return is more
 negative than any abnormal return observed
 in the crude adjustment period. The number
 in the bracket indicates the gap from the next
 most negative abnormal return.

 (c) The presence of an unstarred square bracket

 below an abnormal return indicates the num-
 ber of abnormal returns observed in the 50-
 day crude adjustment period that were more
 negative than the tabled abnormal return.

 the test statistics is available from the authors.

 Second, the signs of the average ab-
 normal returns on the two critical days of
 the test period are negative. This is con-
 sistent with the release of the CEP re-
 ports eliciting, on average, an adverse
 reaction from investors.

 Third, average abnormal returns ag-
 gregated for the first four CEP reports
 are much larger than for the follow-up
 reports. There are two possible explana-
 tions for this result. The first is that any
 impacts of this externally produced in-
 formation came at the time of the first
 release to the market. The first set of
 reports showed the seriousness of the
 problem by detailing the probable costs
 to companies of coming into compliance
 with minimum required standards and
 sharply criticized the companies studied
 for foot-dragging on pollution abate-
 ment. In practical terms, the reiteration
 of the seriousness of these problems in
 the second set of reports may have pro-
 vided little new information to the market
 or may have done little to change inves-
 tors' probability assessments of increased
 regulatory enforcement. A later section
 in the paper further investigates this
 apparent lack of overall significant price
 movement associated with the follow-up
 reports.

 Finally, although not reported in de-
 tail here, results based on risk- and mar-
 ket-adjusted returns using either a value-
 weighted or an equally-weighted index
 were completely consistent with the
 results reported in Table 3, which are
 based on mean-adjusted returns. The
 only difference was that the results based
 on mean-adjusted returns were a little
 stronger in terms of statistical signifi-
 cance.'3

 In addition, all tests performed on
 mean-adjusted or risk- and market-
 adjusted returns were repeated using
 two-day return periods, formed by com-
 bining days -4 and -3 into one return
 period, days -2 and -1 into one return
 period, and so on. The use of two-day
 return periods allows for the possibility
 that the price impact of the release of the
 CEP reports may best be isolated within
 a two-day period because of uncertainty
 about the earliest date at which investors
 actually received information about each
 CEP report.'4 Again, the results were
 totally consistent with the results re-
 ported in Table 3 based on one-day
 returns and were very strong in terms of
 statistical significance.

 Fourth, the numbers in the starred and
 unstarred square brackets in Table 3
 show the results of a comparison of the
 negative abnormal returns in the two
 critical days of the test period, with com-
 parable abnormal returns in the 50-day
 period prior to the test period. The results
 of this comparison are consistent with
 the statistical results. They were included
 to provide another view of the magnitude
 of the negative abnormal returns re-
 ported in Table 3 in a way that abstracts
 from questions about the normality of
 the distribution of the statistics.12 By
 this criterion, the results once again
 appear highly significant.

 Extent of the Observed Price Reaction

 While all the results discussed above
 indicate that the release of the CEP
 reports was associated, on average, with
 a net negative price reaction for the firms

 12 Non-normality of the distributions of daily return

 data is discussed in Fama [1976, pp. 21-26].

 13 The reasons for slightly weaker results for risk- and

 market-adjusted returns using a value-weighted index
 may be that the market return removes part of the effect
 under investigation. All the companies involved in our
 study are very large companies, and therefore what
 happens to them on a particular day may be reflected to
 a degree in the market return.

 14 Both Dann [1981] and DeAngelo and Rice [1980]
 advocate the use of two-day returns. The authors in
 each of these studies used two-day returns because they
 could not determine whether the actual announcement
 preceded or followed the close of trading on the desig-
 nated announcement date.

 Note: The two-tailed level of significance associated with each abnormal return is given in the rounded brackets im-

 in the sample, a question arises as to how
 widespread these price associations were.
 Was the price decrease experienced gen-
 erally for all firms in the sample, or were
 the total sample results dominated by the
 price movements associated with the
 release of one or two of the studies?

 To provide some insight into these
 questions, Table 4 provides details on
 standardized average abnormal mean-
 adjusted returns, Zte, for each of the
 eight CEP studies using one-day returns.
 A couple of observations can be made.
 First, the Steel I group experienced the
 most negative standardized abnormal
 mean-adjusted return of any of the eight
 CEP study groups on days -2 and -1.
 The apparent strength of this price move-
 ment clearly contributes substantially to
 the overall sample results for all eight
 CEP reports on these two days. How-
 ever, it is also apparent that price de-
 creases on days -2 and - 1 were wide-
 spread. Notice that they occurred for all
 CEP report groups on these two critical
 test days.

 The widespread nature of negative
 price reactions on days -2 and -1 was
 investigated further by looking at the
 number of firms in the sample that ex-
 perienced abnormal mean-adjusted re-
 turns lower than their median abnormal
 return for the 50-day period immediately
 preceding the test period. Based on this
 criterion, a highly statistically significant
 number of firms experienced abnormal
 returns below their preceding 50-day
 medians.'5 Once again, similar tests
 using risk- and market-adjusted returns
 and two-day return periods yielded
 consistent results. Based on this analysis,
 it would appear that the negative price
 reactions on days -2 and -1 involved a
 significant number of firms studied by
 the CEP.

 15 On day -2 of the test period, 57 of the 72 firms

 included in the sample experienced mean-adjusted
 abnormal returns below their median abnormal return
 for the 50-day period immediately preceding the test
 period. On day - I of the test period, 53 of the 72 firms
 had mean-adjusted returns below this median. Using a
 non-parametric sign test, these results are significant at
 the .000 and .001 levels, respectively.

 Firms' Pollution-Control Performance
 Ratings and Observed Price Changes

 The preceding results indicate that the
 release of the CEP reports was associated,
 on average, with a significant price move-
 ment for sample firms and that these
 negative price movements involved a
 significant number of firms. The next
 question is whether observed security
 price movements were different for com-
 panies with different pollution-control
 performance characteristics as revealed
 by the CEP reports. This difference
 should be observed if investors actually
 used the CEP information to revise their
 assessments of companies' future ex-
 penditures to meet mandated abatement
 standards, or to revise their assessments
 of the likelihood of costly enforcement
 actions by regulators. The hypothesis
 under investigation is that firms revealed
 by the CEP disclosures to have relatively
 low pollution-control performance
 ratings suffered, on average, a more
 negative overall price movement than
 those firms with relatively high ratings
 on or about the release dates of the CEP
 studies.

 Based on information reported by
 the CEP studies, a pollution-control
 performance index (PCPI) for each sam-
 ple firm in each report group was calcu-
 lated.16 These indices were used to rank
 firms in each CEP report group and to
 split them by thirds into high, intermedi-
 ate, and low groupings. Those companies
 falling into the intermediate grouping
 were then dropped in order to clearly
 differentiate the firms with respect to
 their pollution-control performance
 rankings. For each report, the firms in
 the top (bottom) third, which had not
 been eliminated from the sample for
 reasons cited earlier, constituted the high
 (low) PCPI group for that report.

 difference in the returns of high- and
 low-PCPI groups on day zero for the
 follow-up reports is consistent with
 investors using the information in these
 follow-up reports to once again dis-
 criminate between low- and high-ranking
 firms.

 The last column of Table 5 reports

 standardized differences in average mean-
 adjusted returns between those groups of
 sample firms in the follow-up reports
 with the greatest and least improvement
 in their pollution-control performance
 ratings since the initial reports. A signifi-
 cant difference between these groups is
 observed on day + 1. Although no signifi-
 cant difference is observed on day zero,
 this overall result appears to be generally
 consistent with the other results reported
 here.

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

 The reported results indicate that the
 CEP firms experienced, on average,
 relatively large negative abnormal re-
 turns on the two days immediately prior
 to newspaper reports on the release of the
 CEP studies. Moreover, returns for those
 companies revealed to have low pollu-
 tion-control performance rankings were
 found, on average, to have significantly
 more negative returns than companies
 with high rankings on the day the news-
 paper reports were published. Given the
 experimental design employed and the
 consistent results using a number of test
 procedures, it seems reasonable to at-
 tribute these observed associations to the
 CEP studies. These associations are

 is the raw return on day t. The only dif-
 ference between this and earlier tests is
 that seven rather than eight reports are
 now involved, as Oil II was dropped from
 the set of follow-up reports. The reason is
 that while the Oil II report elaborated on
 and embellished the information released
 in the Oil I report, the pollution-control
 performance indices for each company
 studied were the same in each report.
 Reference back to Table 1 shows that Oil
 I and Oil II were released only five
 months apart.

 The results indicate that on day zero,
 observed returns for low-ranking firms
 were on average significantly lower than
 those for high-ranking firms. For firms
 in all CEP report groups combined, the
 one-tailed probability of observing a
 difference more extreme than the tabled
 difference is .0 19.'1 ' The second and third
 columns of Table 5 report similar results
 for the initial reports and their follow-
 ups.18

 These findings are most interesting

 when interpreted in conjunction with the
 finding of significant negative overall
 price movements for the combined sam-
 ple on days -2 and -1. One plausible
 interpretation of this result is that the
 market at this point was expecting gener-
 ally negative news or regulatory re-
 sponses to the release of the CEP reports.
 Then, on the day the information con-
 tained in the reports received wide
 dissemination through newspaper re-
 ports, the market responded with greater
 precision by discriminating between com-
 panies with high and low pollution-
 control performance ratings.

 A second interesting result is the sig-
 nificant difference observed between the
 high- and low-ranking groups on. day
 zero for the follow-up reports. Even
 though no significant overall price move-
 ment was observed on any day of the
 test period (see Table 3), the significant

 17 In addition, a non-parametric Mann Whitney (two-

 sample) rank test showed that the high-ranking group of
 sample firms had a significantly higher median of
 standardized mean-adjusted returns than that did the
 low-ranking group on day zero of the test period (alpha
 of .005 for a one-tailed test).

 18 All these results need to be interpreted with care

 because of the small sample sizes which result when
 firms are put into high and low PCPI groups.

 consistent with changes in investors' per-
 ceptions of the probability distributions
 of future cash flows of the sample firms
 at the time of release of these reports. The
 reported results also are consistent with
 investors using the information released
 by the CEP to discriminate between
 companies with different pollution-con-
 trol performance records.

 The fact that some significant associ-
 ations have been found between security

 price movements and the release of
 externally produced social performance
 information is significant because of the
 attributes of consistency and compara-
 bility of the CEP data across firms.
 However, while the CEP data do have
 characteristics of consistency and com-
 parability, it cannot be claimed to be
 unbiased and therefore is different from
 both voluntary firm disclosures of social
 accounting information and possibly

 mandated, unbiased disclosures prepared
 under specific measurement and report-
 ing standards. Information gained from
 studies of all these types of social dis-
 closures is potentially relevant to any
 consideration of mandated reporting
 standards in this area.

 Additional sources of social account-
 ing information need to be searched out
 and examined. It is especially important
 to gain a better understanding of how the
 market forms expectations from available

 information. If such understanding were
 achieved, then meaningful tests of the
 significance of the information could be
 done by ranking firms based on their
 performance relative to prior market ex-
 pectations. In testing the usefulness of
 social accounting information that has
 been made available, more work is
 needed to determine whether it is possible
 to separate any regulatory effect from the
 disclosure effect of the information in
 the publication.
