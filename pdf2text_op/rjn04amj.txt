 THE IMPACT OF PERSONALITY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL

 CONTRACTS

 This research examined the relationship between employee personality and psycho
 logical contract type, perceptions of contract breach, and feelings of contract violation.
 In general, personality characteristics (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism,
 self-esteem, equity sensitivity, and locus of control) were related to reported contract
 type. They also tended to predict perceptions of contract breach and to moderate the
 relationship between those perceptions and feelings of contract violation. Both con
 tract type and feelings of violation were associated with job satisfaction, organizational
 commitment, and intentions to quit.

 Recent years have seen a renewal of interest in
 two phenomena with histories of research in organ
 izational behavior?personality, and psychological
 contracts. In this article, we examine the relation
 ship between these two phenomena to address im
 portant research omissions in both domains.

 Despite renewed interest in personality, spurred
 in part by convergence among researchers on the
 utility of the five-factor model of personality (Gold
 berg, 1990), and despite growing evidence of asso
 ciations between personality and work attitudes
 and behavior (e.g., Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge &
 Bono, 2001), the exact mechanisms by which per
 sonality affects organizational behavior have not
 been well specified. This is a serious omission in
 light of the fact that the failure to specify the mech
 anisms linking particular personality traits or di
 mensions to criteria was in part responsible for the
 earlier demise of research on personality in the
 workplace (Hough & Schneider, 1996). At the same
 time, despite growing agreement among research
 ers that psychological contracts are personal and
 idiosyncratic (Rousseau, 1989), research has not
 systematically examined dispositional contributors
 to contracts. This omission is curious, given that
 such contracts are self-constructed. In what fol
 lows, we offer theoretical arguments that predict

 what kinds of contracts people with certain person
 ality traits will establish, as well as the likelihood
 that they will perceive contract breaches and report
 feelings of violation. In addition, we consider how
 contract type and violation are associated with im
 portant personal and organizational outcomes.

 Psychological contracts are defined as a person's
 perceptions and expectations about the mutual ob
 ligations in an employment exchange relationship
 (Rousseau, 1989). Transactional contracts are
 short-term, have a purely economic or materialistic
 focus, and entail limited involvement by both par
 ties. Relational contracts are long-term and broad,
 as they are not restricted to purely economic ex
 change but also include terms for loyalty in ex
 change for security or growth in an organization
 (Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Rousseau & McLean
 Parks, 1993). Concepts that have attracted attention
 in research on psychological contracts include per
 ceived breach and felt violation. According to Mor
 rison and Robinson, "Perceived breach refers to the
 cognition that one's organization has failed to meet
 one or more obligations within one's psychological
 contract in a manner commensurate with one's
 contributions . . . perceived breach represents a
 cognitive assessment of contract fulfillment that is
 based on an employee's perception of what each
 party has promised and provided to the other"
 (1997: 230). Violation, however, refers to emotional
 distress and feelings of betrayal, anger, and wrong
 ful harm arising from the realization that one's or
 ganization has not fulfilled a highly salient promise
 (Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Rousseau, 1989). This
 distinction clearly signifies breach as the product
 of a more deliberate and cognitive search aimed at
 monitoring how well one's psychological contract

 is being upheld by one's organization. Violation is,
 on the other hand, a deep emotional response that
 is more affective and a result of blaming one's or
 ganization for a broken promise. Other things being
 equal, a more serious breach should lead to stron
 ger feelings of violation. However, it is our conten
 tion that personality will influence the propensity
 both to detect breach and to respond to breach with
 feelings of violation.

 PERSONALITY, CONTRACTS, AND OUTCOMES

 Relating Contract Types, Perceived Breach, and
 Violation to Personality

 Personality might affect psychological contract
 dynamics through three processes: choice, con
 strual, and enactment. Choice refers to job-seeking
 behavior and is most pertinent to the type of con
 tract sought after or negotiated. The motivational
 implications of personality are most relevant to
 preferences for contract type. Construal refers to
 perceptions of contract type, breach, and violation.
 The cognitive and affective implications of person
 ality are most relevant to construal. Rousseau
 (1989) has stressed the highly personal, idiosyn
 cratic, self-constructed nature of psychological
 contracts. These characteristics suggest that there
 are few external constraints on construal, thus al
 lowing for the influence of personality (cf. Mischel,
 1968). Finally, enactment refers to the impact of
 personality on organization behavior and attitudes.
 Such behavior and attitudes might influence the
 contract terms offered by an employer or the mod
 ification of a contract over time. We chose person
 ality variables for study and framed hypotheses
 mainly on the basis of their relevance for choice
 and construal. In the discussion section, we spec
 ulate about the role of enactment in the interpreta
 tion of our results.

 Given our belief that personality might affect or

 ganizational behavior in part through its impact on
 contracting, we chose personality variables with a
 demonstrated history of relevance to behavior in
 organizations. We began with the "Big Five" model
 of personality (Goldberg, 1990), which has had con
 siderable impact on thinking about organizational
 behavior (e.g., Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge,
 Heller, & Mount, 2002). Below, we offer specific
 logic for inclusion of the Big Five variables neurot
 icism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. We
 omitted from consideration the Big Five dimension
 known as openness to experience in view of its
 controversial structure, limited research history,
 and generally weak relevance to organizational be
 havior (e.g., McCrae & Costa, 1997). Because of

 their preference for close relationships and their
 cooperative good nature, we predicted that individ
 uals high on the Big Five trait agreeableness would
 report relational contracts and be less prone to ex
 periencing breach and violation. However, we were
 unable to establish a reliable level of measurement
 for agreeableness (a ? .43) and thus omitted it from
 our predictions and analyses.

 For exploratory purposes, we were also inter
 ested in incorporating a few narrower, more spe
 cific traits. We developed a list of such traits and
 eliminated those that were closely associated with
 particular Big Five dimensions or with each other.
 Equity sensitivity was retained in light of the prom
 issory aspect of psychological contracts and previ
 ous conjecture concerning its relevance to contract
 ing (Morrison & Robinson, 1997). Self-esteem was
 incorporated because its implications for self-con
 fidence and vigilance respectively pertain to con
 tract formation and maintenance. Similarly, locus
 of control was chosen because its relevance for
 sensitivity to future events and vigilance respec
 tively pertain to contract formation and mainte
 nance. Narrower traits considered relevant but not
 measured owing to conceptual overlap included
 negative affectivity, which is highly correlated with
 the Big Five neuroticism dimension (Watson &
 Clark, 1997), and generalized self-efficacy, which is
 highly correlated with self-esteem (e.g., Judge,
 Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998).

 Neuroticism. Neuroticism is a widely researched
 personality trait from the Big Five. It is associated
 with emotional instability, mistrust, anxiety, self
 pity, and lack of psychological adjustment (Gold
 berg, 1990; Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, & Barrick,
 1999). Neurotics are limited in social skills and
 avoid situations that demand taking control (Judge,
 Locke, & Durham, 1997).

 There is a negative correlation between neuroti

 cism and job satisfaction (Judge et al., 1999; Judge,
 Heller, & Mount, 2002), extrinsic career success
 (Judge et al., 1999), job complexity (Judge, Bono, &
 Locke, 2000), and performance (Barrick & Mount,
 1991) over a wide variety of jobs. High anxiety, an
 important facet of neuroticism, is negatively related
 to performance on complex tasks (Spector, 1982).
 The characteristics associated with neuroticism
 suggest that such individuals will not engage in
 relationships that require long-term commitments
 on their part and demand high social skills, trust in
 others, and initiative. They will form psychological
 contracts that are short-term and purely economic,
 involving exchanges for specific aspects of perfor
 mance that do not demand high initiative and con
 fidence.

 On the one hand, the low trust of neurotics in

 others suggests that they would expect breach to
 occur. On the other hand, neurotics are not ex
 pected to be active information seekers monitoring
 how well their psychological contracts are being
 maintained, because such processes can lead to the
 discovery of psychologically disquieting informa
 tion. Also, being an affect-related trait, neuroticism
 is more likely to influence an individual's emo
 tional response (violation) than to influence per
 ceived breach, which is more cognitive (Morrison &
 Robinson, 1997). We therefore suggest that:

 Hypothesis la. Neurotics will tend to form
 transactional contracts.

 Hypothesis lb. Neuroticism will be negatively
 related to perceived breach.
 Extraversion. Extroverts are highly social, talk
 ative, energetic, enthusiastic, assertive, and ambi
 tious (Costa & McCrae, 1992). They have high de
 sire for material gain, status, recognition, and
 power (Costa & McCrae, 1988). The assertive com
 ponent of extraversion is associated with a desire
 for increased salary and status (Cattell, 1981). Ex
 traversion is also positively related to performance
 (Barrick & Mount, 1991) and job satisfaction (Judge
 et al., 2002). Although extroverts actively seek eco
 nomic rewards in exchange relationships, they will
 tend to form long-term psychological contracts.
 The reason is that short-term, purely economic con
 tracts are very limited and restrictive. Such psycho
 logical contracts cannot offer opportunities for
 gaining desired status, power, or recognition that
 require central positions in social networks (Krack
 hardt, 1990). We argue that extroverts will form
 relational contracts with more emphasis on mate
 rialistic terms and opportunities for gain in their
 exchange relationships. Being highly assertive, en
 ergetic, ambitious, and susceptible to materialistic
 influence, extroverts will be very vigilant in moni
 toring how well their contracts are being fulfilled
 by their organization. Using their high social skills,
 they will actively seek information to ensure that
 the organization does not deny them opportunity
 for gain in the short or the long term.

 Hypothesis 2a. Extroverts will tend to establish
 relational contracts.

 Hypothesis 2b. Extraversion will be positively
 related to perceived breach.
 Conscientiousness. Individuals with high con
 scientiousness are methodical, dependable, and
 risk averse (Goldberg, 1990). They tend to exhibit
 high performance and to be satisfied with their jobs
 (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge et al., 1999, 2002).
 People rating high on this trait exhibit motivation

 for achievement, and they are more concerned with
 task accomplishment than with economic rewards
 (Stewart, 1996). We argue that conscientious peo
 ple will tend to form long-term employment ex
 change relationships. They will try to choose an
 environment in which they have greater opportu
 nities for achievement and success, even though
 they might have to delay gratification for future
 growth opportunities. Although conscientious peo
 ple will form relational contracts, they will be very
 active in monitoring how well their contracts are
 being maintained. Being risk averse, they will ac
 tively seek information regarding their exchange
 relationships with organizations so that they do not
 face any unpleasant surprises. Also, their desire for
 growth and success will stimulate vigilance to
 monitor their psychological contracts. We therefore
 propose:

 Hypothesis 3a. Employees with high conscien
 tiousness will tend to form relational contracts.

 Hypothesis 3b. High conscientiousness will be
 positively related to perceived breach.

 Equity sensitivity. Proposed by Huseman, Hat
 field, and Miles (1987), equity sensitivity is a per
 sonality variable that explains individual differ
 ences in reactions to inequity (O'Neil & Mone,
 1998). Persons high in equity sensitivity are outcome
 oriented, wanting more than others for a given level
 of inputs (Sauley & Bedeian, 2000). On the other
 hand, those low in equity sensitivity pay more atten
 tion to their inputs and are less sensitive to equity
 issues in exchange relationships (Huseman et al.,
 1987; Sauley & Bedeian, 2000). Miles, Hatfield, and
 Huseman (1994) found that people high in equity
 sensitivity place importance on tangible extrinsic
 outcomes such as pay, status, and fringe benefits.
 Employees with low equity sensitivity placed impor
 tance on intangible intrinsic outcomes such as a sense
 of accomplishment, making use of one's abilities, and
 feelings of personal worth. Equity sensitivity is neg
 atively related to job satisfaction and organizational
 commitment and positively related to intentions to
 quit (O'Neil & Mone, 1998). Equity sensitivity is also
 associated with a poor work ethic and low social
 responsibility (Mudrack, Mason, & Stepanski, 1999).
 In light of the above, we expect that people high
 in equity sensitivity will form transactional con
 tracts. Being focused on pay, status, and material
 gain, they will form contracts that provide clear
 opportunity for these. Being very sensitive to eq
 uity issues, they will place less importance on re
 lationships than on extrinsic gains. As they exhibit
 low social responsibility and tend to sacrifice the
 work ethic to make gains (Mudrack et al., 1999),

 they will not form long-term psychological con
 tracts that may require delay of gratification and/or
 the exhibition of high social responsibility in their
 organizations. Similarly, being highly concerned
 with equity issues, they will be very vigilant in
 monitoring the maintenance of their psychological
 contracts. We therefore propose the following two
 hypotheses:

 Hypothesis 4a. People high in equity sensitivity
 will tend to form transactional contracts.
 Hypothesis 4b. Equity sensitivity will be posi
 tively related to perceived breach.
 Locus of control. Locus of control is a variable
 reflecting how people perceive the strength of the
 link between their own actions and the outcomes of
 those actions (Rotter, 1966). People with internal
 loci of control ("internals"), as compared to those
 with external loci of control ("externals"), believe
 more strongly that outcomes (such as rewards) are
 under their own control (Rotter, 1966; Spector,
 1982). Externals are less likely to perceive a rela
 tionship between their inputs or efforts and out
 comes. They attribute success or failure to factors
 beyond their own control, such as chance or pow
 erful others. Internal locus of control is positively
 related to affective commitment (Meyer, Stanley,
 Herscovitch, & Topolnytsky, 2002) and job satisfac
 tion (Judge & Bono, 2001).

 Compared to internals, externals find jobs that
 are less well suited to them (Judge et al., 2000), are
 less satisfied and motivated, and exhibit lower job
 performance (Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge et al.,
 2000). Externals show low alertness and are not
 sensitive to information related to future situations
 and outcomes (Miller, Kets De Vries, & Toulouse,
 1982; Phares, 1976; Spector, 1982). Paying little
 attention to future situations, externals will be less
 concerned with long-term relationships. They will
 form contracts that offer them accessible short-term
 gains rather than future opportunities fraught with
 uncertainty. As opposed to internals, who are bet
 ter adjusted in their jobs, externals will form psy
 chological contracts that allow maximization of the
 short-term outcomes of their inputs. They will not
 vigilantly monitor their exchange environment, as
 they believe outcomes to be under the control of
 factors such as influential others or luck.

 Hypothesis 5a. Externals will tend to form
 transactional psychological contracts.

 Hypothesis 5b. External locus of control will be
 negatively related to perceived breach.
 Self-esteem. Self-esteem, which refers to the
 value one puts on the self, has been termed the

 evaluative component of the self-concept (Rosen
 berg, 1979). People high in self-esteem value them
 selves, exhibit confidence, and opt for occupations
 that match their abilities and self-perceived traits
 (Judge et al., 1997, 2000; Tharenou, 1979). Self
 esteem is positively related to job satisfaction, task
 motivation, and job performance (Erez & Judge,
 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001). Individuals with high
 self-esteem tend to have a desire for achievement
 and are highly competitive (Brockner, 1988). Being
 strong performers and having a desire for growth,
 achievement, and success, they will form psycho
 logical contracts that promise such opportunities.
 The preference for growth and achievement is un
 likely to be fulfilled through a purely economic,
 short-term relationship. It calls for a long-term re
 lationship in which economic terms are accompa
 nied by factors such as status and prestige being
 linked to high performance. Also, as they choose
 jobs that match their abilities and personalities
 (Judge et al., 2000), they will be well adjusted in
 their jobs, considering them to provide maximum
 opportunities for success. Therefore, individuals
 with high self-esteem will form long-term contracts
 that are somewhat balanced in terms of relation
 ship and performance/rewards criteria. Their high
 confidence and perceptions of high self-worth will
 make them active and vigilant in monitoring infor
 mation pertinent to exchange relationships. In or
 der to maintain their positive self-concepts, they
 will exhibit high alertness to ensure that their psy
 chological contracts are being properly maintained
 and they are receiving what is expected from their
 organizations.

 Hypothesis 6a. People high in self-esteem will
 tend to form relational contracts.
 Hypothesis 6b. Self-esteem will be positively
 related to perceived breach.

 Contract Type and Personal and Organizational
 Outcomes

 Theory provides good grounds for expecting that
 relational contracts will facilitate positive personal
 and organizational outcomes better than transac
 tional contracts will (Rousseau, 1995; Rousseau &
 McLean Parks, 1993). Indeed, relational contracts
 have been shown to relate positively (and transac
 tional contracts, negatively) to job commitment, or
 ganizational commitment, and expected job tenure
 . (Millward & Hopkins, 1998; Rousseau, 1990). How
 ever, most other evidence bearing on the differen
 tial outcomes of these contract types is indirect
 (e.g., Robinson, Kraatz, & Rousseau, 1994; Shore &

 Barksdale, 1998). In light of such limited but sug
 gestive evidence, we hypothesize that:

 Hypothesis 9a. Perceived breach will be posi
 tively related to violation.

 Hypothesis 7a. Relational contracts will be
 negatively related to intentions to quit and pos
 itively related to job satisfaction and affective
 commitment.

 Hypothesis 7b. Transactional contracts will be
 positively related to intentions to quit and neg
 atively related to job satisfaction and affective
 commitment.

 Perceived Breach, Violation, and Outcomes

 Perceived breach signals an imbalance in the so
 cial exchange process in which an employee does
 not receive expected outcomes from an organiza
 tion for fulfilling his or her obligations (Morrison &
 Robinson, 1997). To address this imbalance, em
 ployees have the options of altering either their
 own or the organization's obligations (Robinson et
 al., 1994). Available theory and some empirical
 evidence justify a positive relationship between
 perceived breach and undesirable outcomes such
 as intentions to quit and actual turnover (Bunder
 son, 2001; Robinson, 1996). Similarly, literature
 supports the idea of a negative relationship be
 tween perceived breach and desirable outcomes
 such as job satisfaction, organizational commit
 ment, and performance (Bunderson, 2001; Robin
 son & Morrison, 2000).

 Hypothesis 8. Perceived breach will lead to
 higher intentions to quit and lower job satisfac
 tion and affective commitment.

 Violation describes the feelings of anger, distress,

 injustice, and mistrust arising from the realization
 that one's organization has failed to fulfill its obli
 gations (Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Rousseau,
 1989). Whether perceived breach is converted into
 feelings of violation depends on the size and sa
 lience of the promise or expectation the organiza
 tion failed to fulfill (Morrison & Robinson, 1997).
 Violation therefore is one of the mechanisms
 through which perceived breach is translated into
 outcomes such as intentions to quit, low job satis
 faction, and low organizational commitment. Em
 ployees who realize that their organization has
 failed to provide them something that they not only
 deserved, but that is also important to them, expe
 rience feelings of anger, mistrust, and betrayal.
 These feelings in turn make the employees dissat
 isfied, less committed to the organization, and
 likely to quit.

 Hypothesis 9b. Violation will mediate the rela
 tionship between perceived breach and inten
 tions to quit, job satisfaction, and affective
 commitment.

 Robinson and Morrison (2000) showed that attri
 butions and fairness perceptions interacted with
 perceived breach to predict violation. We antici
 pated that personality would serve a similar mod
 erator function. Personality explains how people
 differ in their social interactions, reactions to per
 ceived injustice, and attachment of importance to
 various extrinsic and intrinsic outcomes. Conscien
 tious people are more concerned with task accom
 plishment than with rewards (Stewart, 1996). They
 are willing to forego immediate extrinsic rewards
 for future success (Goldberg, 1990). These people
 are not expected to readily convert the realization
 of every unmet promise into feelings of violation.
 In order to maintain healthy relationships with
 their employers and have optimal opportunities for
 growth and achievement, they will tend to focus
 more on their inputs in order to give their best.
 People with high self-esteem tend to be good per
 formers and to choose professions that best fit their
 abilities and strengths (Judge et al, 1997, 2000;
 Tharenou, 1979). Being well adjusted, they will
 trust their organizations and not show emotional
 reactions to every breach they detect. Similarly,
 externals are less likely to feel violated because
 they attribute success and failure more to factors
 such as chance (Spector, 1982). They will neither
 be too excited over a success nor be too surprised if
 some of their expectations are not met. Extroverts
 will not exhibit very strong emotional reactions to
 any detected breaches to conserve their relation
 ships with their employers and maintain social
 reputation.

 People high in neuroticism are anxious, lack
 trust, and perceive failures in life (Judge et al.,
 1999). They are expected to show stronger affective
 reactions to a perceived breach, once detected, than
 those who are low in neuroticism. Skarlicki, Folger,
 and Tesluk's (1999) finding that negative affectiv
 ity, which is very closely related to neuroticism
 (Watson & Clark, 1997), moderated the relationship
 between perceptions of fairness and retaliatory be
 haviors extends some support to this idea. Simi
 larly, people high in equity sensitivity want more
 outcomes for a given level of inputs than do refer
 ent others (Huseman et al., 1987). They also view
 the world as unfair, and a small breach can make
 them feel that they have been treated unjustly. Be
 ing highly sensitive to equity issues, and focusing

 more on outcomes than on inputs, people high in
 equity sensitivity are more likely to experience
 feelings of violation than are those who are less
 concerned with outcomes and who focus more on
 their own inputs (such as internals). We therefore
 suggest that personality will interact with breach in
 predicting violation.

 Hypothesis 10. Personality will moderate the
 positive relationship between breach and vio
 lation in such a way that the relationship will
 be stronger for people high in equity sensitivity
 and neuroticism and weaker for persons high
 in extraversion, conscientiousness, external lo
 cus of control, and self-esteem.

 METHODS

 Sample and Procedure

 The sample consisted of employees working in
 five well-established private and public sector or
 ganizations located in Pakistan. The research sites
 included a branch of a private sector bank, a fertil
 izer processing and production company, an engi
 neering firm, a research lab of a semiautonomous
 government research organization, and the head
 office of a large multinational consumer products
 organization. Research access was gained through
 personal and professional contacts of the first au
 thor who made these organizational units available
 for sampling.

 Surveys were distributed to employees working
 in secretarial, clerical, or higher-level positions
 through designated, trained people in their respec
 tive organizational units. A cover letter explaining
 the purpose and scope of the study assured respon
 dents of strict anonymity and that participation in
 the study was voluntary. Of the 300 surveys dis
 tributed, 45 went to the bank (responses, 31; re
 sponse rate, 68%), 100 to the fertilizer company
 (responses, 66; response rate, 66%), 45 to the engi
 neering company (responses, 30; response rate,
 66%), 30 to the research lab (responses, 21; re
 sponse rate, 70%), and 80 went to the head office of
 the multinational company (responses, 49; re
 sponse rate, 61%). Overall, from the 300 question
 naires distributed, we received 197 usable re
 sponses, representing a response rate of 66 percent.
 The respondents had a mean age of 38.81 years
 (s.d. = 9.86), and 94 percent were male. Mean
 tenure with the organization was 12.25 years (s.d.
 = 9.50). Education levels ranged from high school
 completion to receiving a Ph.D., with 10.2 percent
 of the respondents having a high school certificate
 and the remaining 89.8 percent having college or
 university education. Although respondents occu

 pied diverse occupational levels, ranging from cler
 ical and secretarial staff to upper management,
 most of the sample (76%) occupied junior and
 middle-level managerial, professional, and techni
 cal positions. To partially check for sampling bias,
 we compared the mean age of our respondents with
 the corresponding organizational means for the fer
 tilizer (37.1 vs. 38.7, t = 1.26, n.s.) and multina
 tional (37.4 vs. 39.5, t = 1.16, n.s.) companies. A
 close correspondence was observed in both cases.

 Measures

 All measures were obtained from a "self-report"
 questionnaire. Unless otherwise noted, a response
 scale anchored by 1, "strongly disagree," and 5,
 "strongly agree," was used, and high variable
 scores denote high levels of the construct in ques
 tion. In Pakistan, English is taught as a major, com
 pulsory subject beginning in grade school and is
 the medium of instruction for all university educa
 tion. Except for entry-level jobs in which almost no
 education is required, every person employed in
 Pakistan can at least read and understand English.
 Thus, given the sampling frame, we did not have to
 translate the questionnaire into the native lan
 guage.

 Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientious
 ness. Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscien
 tiousness were measured with 36 items (12 items
 each) taken from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory
 (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992). The NEO-FFI
 was derived from the revised NEO Personality In
 ventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and is an exten
 sively validated and used measure of the Big Five
 personality dimensions (Costa & McCrae, 1988).
 Examples of items include "I often feel inferior to
 others," for neuroticism; "I like to have a lot of
 people around me," for extraversion; and "I am
 pretty good about pacing myself so as to get things
 done on time," for conscientiousness. Alpha reli
 abilities were .72 for neuroticism, .62 for extraver
 sion, and .77 for conscientiousness.

 Equity sensitivity. Equity sensitivity was mea
 sured with the 16-item Equity Preference Question
 naire (EPQ) developed by Sauley and Bedeian
 (2000). They presented construct validity evidence
 and argued that their measure does not have prob
 lems endemic to earlier measures (e.g., see Miles et
 al., 1994). Items such as "I prefer to do as little as
 possible at work while getting as much as I can
 from my employer" tap high equity sensitivity, or
 an orientation toward outcomes. Items such as "I
 feel obligated to do more than I am paid to do at
 work" reflect low equity sensitivity, or orientation
 toward inputs. Scores on items reflecting low eq

 uity sensitivity were reverse-coded so that a high
 score on the scale reflected high equity sensitivity.
 The reliability of the EPQ measure was .75.

 Locus of control. We assessed locus of control
 with Spector's (1988) Work Locus of Control Scale
 (WLCS). The WLCS is a 16-item measure designed
 to capture employees' beliefs about their control
 over their organizational outcomes (Spector, 1988).
 Eight items each are worded to reflect external ver
 sus internal locus of control. An example of an
 externally worded item is "It takes a lot of luck to
 be an outstanding employee on most jobs." Con
 versely, "On most jobs, people can pretty much
 accomplish whatever they set out to accomplish" is
 an example of an internally worded item. Scores for
 internally worded items were reversed so that a
 high score reflected high external locus of control.
 The WLCS demonstrated an internal consistency
 reliability of .63.

 Self-esteem. Self-esteem was measured with the
 eight-item Rosenberg Global Self-Esteem Scale
 (Rosenberg, 1965), an instrument that captures
 overall perceptions of self-appreciation and self
 worth. "I feel that I'm a person of worth, at least on
 an equal plane with others" is a sample item. The
 internal consistency reliability for this scale was
 .70.
 Given that we measured 76 personality items
 with 197 respondents, we assessed the discrimi
 nant validity of the six personality traits following
 procedures recommended by Anderson and Gerb
 ing (1998). This assessment involved 15 confirma
 tory analyses assessing the discriminant validity of
 each pair of traits in which a constrained model (a
 single-factor model or a two-factor model with a
 perfect correlation of one) was compared with an
 unrestricted two-factor model. Discriminant valid
 ity was achieved for all personality variables, as the
 chi-squares in all the comparisons were signifi
 cantly lower [p < .001) for the unconstrained
 models.

 Psychological contract. The reported psycholog
 ical contract was initially measured with the 31
 item Psychological Contract Scale developed by
 Millward and Hopkins (1998). Two dimensions,
 comprising relational (11 items) and transactional
 (20 items) contracts, underpin the instrument. Prin
 cipal axis factor analysis forcing two factors did not
 exactly replicate the Millward and Hopkins (1998)
 solution. Five items did not "load" on either factor.
 In addition, a number of Millward and Hopkins's
 transactional items (items that their own focus
 group had designated as relational) cross-loaded or
 loaded negatively onto our relational factor. We
 considered this instability unhelpful for future re
 search and thus trimmed the measure so as to retain

 only the items that had replicated loading patterns
 in both studies. In doing so, we retained 9 of their
 11 relational items and 9 of their 20 transactional
 items. These items were among those also retained
 in a factor analysis of contract terms by Irving,
 Cawsey, and Cruikshank (2002). The shortened 18
 item scale revealed a clear two-factor solution that
 accounted for 36.4 percent of the variance (see the
 Appendix), with coefficient alphas of .79 for rela
 tional contract and .72 for transactional contract.
 To examine the validity of our shortened scale, we
 administered both it and the contract items (10
 relational, 8 transactional) from Rousseau's (2000)
 Psychological Contract Inventory to an indepen
 dent sample of 103 employees attending university
 sponsored employee development programs in Pa
 kistan. Our derived measures of transactional and
 relational contracts correlated .71 and .59 with the
 respective Rousseau measures, thus providing evi
 dence for convergent validity.

 Perceived breach. A five-item measure devel
 oped by Robinson and Morrison (2000) was used to
 assess perceived contract breach. It captured em
 ployees' perceptions of how well their employing
 organizations had fulfilled their obligations to
 them. Robinson and Morrison (2000) argued that
 this measure was consistent with current psycho
 logical contracts literature in which breach is
 viewed as an overall estimation of employer-kept
 promises (Robinson, 1996; Rousseau, 1989). Items
 for perceived breach included "My employer has
 broken many of its promises to me even though I've
 upheld my side of the deal." The perceived con
 tract breach scale demonstrated an internal consis
 tency reliability of .79.

 Feelings of violation. Feelings of violation were
 assessed with a four-item measure developed by
 Robinson and Morrison (2000). While breach has a
 cognitive focus, violation is meant to capture affec
 tive reactions in the context of a contract. Respon
 dents were asked to indicate how much they agreed
 with statements such as "I feel extremely frustrated
 by how I have been treated by my organization."
 Coefficient alpha for feelings of violation was .81.
 The high correlation between perceived breach
 and violation (r = .72) and the relative newness of
 the scales warranted caution in using them. We
 therefore performed a confirmatory factor analysis
 to see if perceived breach and violation were dis
 tinct constructs. Results revealed that a two-factor
 model [x2 = 68.43, df = 26, CFI = .94, GFI = .93,
 AGFI = .88, RMSEA = .09) fitted the data slightly
 better than a single-factor model [x2 = 76.20, df =
 27, CFI = .92, GFI = .92, AGFI = .86, RMSEA =
 .10), and the difference in chi-squares was signifi
 cant (A*2 = 7.77, df = 1, p < .01), Similar tests

 supported the discriminability of the contract types
 from breach and violation.

 Outcomes. Intentions to leave the organization

 were measured with a three-item scale extracted
 from the Michigan Organizational Assessment
 Questionnaire (Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins, &
 Klesh, 1982). Items included "I will probably look
 for a new job in the next year." The coefficient
 alpha for the scale was .83. Affective commitment
 was measured with the eight-item scale developed
 by Allen and Meyer (1990). Items included "I enjoy
 discussing my organization with people outside it."
 For this scale, the coefficient alpha was .82. Job
 satisfaction was measured with Hoppock's (1935)
 scale, which comprises four multiple-choice ques
 tions, each of which offers seven answer options.
 For example, for the question "Which one of the
 following shows how much of the time you feel
 satisfied with your job?" response options range
 from 1, "never," to 7, "all the time." The reliability
 coefficient was .75. Confirmatory factor analyses
 revealed that a three-factor model best fitted the
 outcome data (x2 = 152.71, df = 87, CFI = .94,
 GFI = .90, AGFI = .87, RMSEA = .06), providing
 evidence for discriminant validity.

 Control variables. Age, tenure with the em
 ployer, occupational level, and organization were
 used as control variables. Age and tenure were
 included because contract dynamics may change
 over the course of an individual's career. Occupa
 tional level was measured by reported job title and
 job grade. We coded jobs in such a way that higher

 numbers corresponded to higher occupational lev
 els. Thus, the lowest number (1) corresponded to
 the clerical and secretarial level, and the highest
 number (5) was assigned to upper management.
 One-way analyses of variance were conducted to
 compare occupational levels on breach, violation,
 relational contract, transactional contract, job satis
 faction, affective commitment, and intentions to
 quit. These tests revealed that there were differ
 ences in contract type [F = 3.26, p < .01) and
 violation (F = 4.79, p < .001) across occupational
 levels, with higher levels reporting more relational
 contracts and less violation. Thus, we controlled
 for occupational level in regression analyses. Also,
 one-way analyses of variance were performed on
 these same variables across organizations. Signifi
 cant differences were observed for affective com
 mitment [F = 6.77, p < .001) and job satisfaction
 [F = 5.07, p < .001), and post hoc tests indicated
 that they were due to the tendency for the bank
 employees to be somewhat more committed and
 satisfied than the balance of the sample. To con
 serve degrees of freedom, we formed a dummy
 coded variable (1 = "bank," 0 = "other organiza
 tion") to serve as a control variable.

 for transactional contract type was 2.61, and that
 for relational contract was 3.74. The correlation
 between the two contract types was -.15. The
 mean for perceived breach was 2.63 (s.d. = 0.74)
 and for violation it was 2.22 (s.d. = 0.77). These
 values are consistent with research by Robinson
 and Morrison (2000), who reported means of 2.63
 (s.d. = 0.95) for perceived breach and of 2.05 (s.d.
 = 0.95) for feelings of violation in a sample of
 recent U.S. MBA graduates. Robinson and Morri
 son (2000) reported a correlation of .68 between
 perceived breach and violation, and in the current
 study this value was .72.

 The bivariate associations shown in the correla

 tion matrix indicate provisional support for all
 "main effect" hypotheses dealing with personality
 and contract type, contract type and outcomes,
 breach and outcomes, and breach and violation.
 However, several hypotheses concerning personal
 ity and breach were not supported: lb, 2b, 3b, 5b,
 and 6b.

 Regression Analyses

 We performed several hierarchical regression
 analyses to formally test the hypotheses. In all the
 regressions, age, tenure, occupational level, and or
 ganization type were entered as control variables in
 the first step. Because this exploratory study in
 cluded a range of broad and narrow personality
 traits, a legitimate question arose as to how to an
 alyze the data. In most cases, we conducted sepa
 rate regression analyses for the broader Big Five
 personality traits of neuroticism, extraversion, and
 conscientiousness and the more specific, focused
 traits of equity sensitivity, locus of control, and
 self-esteem. This analytic technique respected the
 basic taxonomic level of the personality variables
 (Hough & Schneider, 1996), and it was also consis
 tent with their typical treatment in the literature.
 For example, the Big Five variables or a subset of
 them are frequently analyzed simultaneously,
 while the same has applied to the more focused
 variables under consideration here (e.g., Sauley &
 Bedeian, 2000). Also, separate analyses corre
 sponded more closely to the theoretical thinking
 that guided the development of the specific hy
 potheses. That is, the hypotheses were guided by
 research devoted to explicating the nature of the
 individual traits rather than possible higher-order
 amalgamations of them (cf. Judge, Bono, Hies, &
 Gerhardt, 2002). For instance, our treatment of lo
 cus of control owes at least as much to its implica
 tions for environmental scanning and information
 processing as it does to its possible higher-order
 self-evaluative properties, such as core self-evalua

 tions (Erez & Judge, 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001).
 Nevertheless, we later report three analyses that
 assess the simultaneous impact of the broader
 and narrower traits thought to represent core self
 evaluations.

 Relational contracts. The hypotheses predict
 that extraversion, conscientiousness, and self
 esteem will be positively related to relational con
 tracts. To test these predictions, we regressed con
 tract type on the Big Five traits and then on the
 narrower traits (see Table 2). Conscientiousness
 (? = .27, p < .001) was a significant predictor of
 relational contract type, supporting Hypothesis 3a.
 However, extraversion was not related to relational
 contract type, disconfirming Hypothesis 2a. For the
 narrow traits, a significant positive relationship be
 tween self-esteem (? = .15, p < .05) and relational
 contracts confirmed Hypothesis 6a. Though not hy
 pothesized, a negative relationship with relational
 contracts was found for neuroticism (? = - .20, p <
 .007), external locus of control (? = -.21, p < .003),
 and equity sensitivity (?=-.20,p<.01).

 Transactional contracts. The hypotheses predict
 that neuroticism, equity sensitivity, and external
 locus of control will be positively related to trans
 actional contracts. As shown in Table 2, neuroti
 cism (? = .15, p < .06) was related (with marginal
 significance) to transactional contracts, supporting
 Hypothesis la. Of the narrower traits, equity sensi
 tivity (? = .37, p < .001) showed a significant,
 positive association with transactional contracts,
 but locus of control did not. These findings support
 Hypothesis 4a but fail to support Hypothesis 5a.
 Though not hypothesized, a negative relationship
 emerged for extraversion and transactional con
 tracts (? = - .18, p < .01)

 Perceived breach. The hypotheses predict that
 all six personality variables will be associated with
 perceptions of breach. Results presented in Table 2
 show that of the Big Five variables, neuroticism
 (marginally, at ? = .14, p < .08) and conscientious
 ness (? = -.17, p < .04) were related to perceived
 breach, but in directions contrary to those pre
 dicted in Hypotheses lb and 3b. Extraversion was
 not significantly related to perceived breach, and
 hence no support was found for Hypothesis 2b.
 Among the narrow traits, external locus of control
 (? = .34, p < .001) was a significant predictor of
 perceived breach but in a direction opposite to that
 predicted in Hypothesis 5b. No significant relation
 ship was found for either equity sensitivity or self
 esteem to support the predictions in Hypotheses 4b
 and 6b.

 Three of the traits we studied, neuroticism, locus
 of control, and self-esteem, have been incorporated
 in the higher-order construct core self-evaluations

 (Erez & Judge, 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001). In order
 to address the concerns of one reviewer about pos
 sible overlap among these traits, we regressed the
 two contract types and breach on the three traits
 simultaneously. For relational contracts and per
 ceived breach, all results were similar in direction,
 magnitude, and significance to those reported ear
 lier. For transactional contracts, neuroticism was
 no longer a significant predictor, as expected from
 Hypothesis la. However, in this supplementary
 analysis external locus of control was positively
 related to transactional contracts (? = .16, p < .03),
 providing support for Hypothesis 5a.

 Violation. Violation was regressed on breach and
 the control variables. Results presented in Table 2
 show that breach significantly predicted violation
 (? = .70, p < .001), lending support to Hypothesis 9a.

 Outcomes. We performed regression analyses to
 test contract type, perceived breach, and violation
 as predictors of the outcome variables intentions to
 quit, affective commitment, and job satisfaction.
 Regressing each of the three outcome variables on
 the two contract types simultaneously and on per
 ceived breach and violation resulted in nine regres
 sion equations. Results are presented in the upper
 portion of Table 3.

 Relational contracts were negatively related to

 intentions to quit (?=-.53,p<.001) and posi
 tively related to affective commitment (? = .49, p <
 .001) and job satisfaction (? = .43, p < .001). Trans
 actional contracts were positively related to inten
 tions to quit (? = .18, p < .003) and negatively
 related to affective commitment (? = -.32, p <
 .001) and job satisfaction (? = -.19, p < .001).
 These results provide support for Hypotheses 7a
 and 7b. As predicted in Hypothesis 8, perceived
 breach was significantly related to intentions to
 quit (? = .44, p < .001), affective commitment (? =
 -.45, p < .001), and job satisfaction (? = -.27, p <
 .001). Similarly, violation was a significant predic
 tor of intentions to quit (? = .60, p < .001), affective
 commitment (? = - .53, p < .001), and job satis
 faction (? = -.35, p < .001).
 Moderator and mediator analyses. Moderated
 regression analysis was used to examine the inter
 active effects of breach and personality traits on
 violation. Controlling for extent of breach, this test
 examined the propensity of those with particular
 personality traits to react more strongly in terms of
 violation. First, control variables were entered into
 the model. In the second step, we entered person
 ality variables along with breach to predict viola
 tion. Then, in the last step, the interaction terms
 between breach and personality were entered.

 Altogether, two regression equations (involving
 the two sets of personality traits) yielded two sig
 nificant (one marginally so) interactions. The re
 sults, presented in Table 4, show that interaction
 terms for equity sensitivity (? = .77, p < .07) and

 external locus of control (? = -1.34, p < .009) had
 effects on violation indicating that perceived
 breach had a stronger, positive relationship for
 higher values of equity sensitivity and lower values
 of external locus of control. In other words, people

 who were sensitive to equity issues were prone to
 convert breach into feelings of violation, as were
 those who were more internal. These results lend
 partial support to Hypothesis 10, which predicts
 significant interactions for all personality variables.
 Hypothesis 9b states that violation will mediate
 the relationship between breach and the three out
 comes. Results of regressions shown in Tables 2
 and 3 reveal breach as a significant predictor of
 violation as well as of the three outcome variables.
 In order to check for the mediation effects of viola
 tion, we regressed the three outcome variables on
 breach and violation together. As shown in the
 lower portion of Table 3, with violation in the
 equation, considerable reduction in the effect size
 of perceived breach was observed for intentions to
 quit (from ? = .44, p < .001 to ? = .04, p < .65),
 affective commitment (from ? = -.45, p < .001 to
 ? = -.15, p < .04), and job satisfaction (from ? =
 -.27, p < .001 to ? = -.05, p < .55). These results
 confirm Hypothesis 9b, indicating that the negative
 outcomes of breach are substantially a function of
 the degree of felt violation.
 We decided to perform two more sets of analyses
 to test for additional mediation effects. One analy
 sis was conducted to assess whether contract type
 mediated the relationship between personality and
 the outcomes, and the other was to test whether
 perceived breach mediated the relationship be
 tween personality and violation. In these tests, we
 employed all six personality variables as a block.
 As shown in the lower portion of Table 3, with
 contract type controlled, the variance explained by
 personality was reduced from .09 (F = 3.24, p <
 .05) to .02 [F = 1.18, n.s.) for intentions to quit;
 from .15 [F = 7.27, p < .05) to .02 [F = 1.11, n.s.) for
 affective commitment; and from .14 [F = 6.43, p <
 .05) to .03 [F = 1.56, n.s.) for job satisfaction. The
 reduced variance supported the mediating role of
 contract type in the personality-outcome relation
 ship. Similarly, results in the lower portion of Ta
 ble 4 show that, with perceived breach controlled,
 the variance in violation explained by personality
 decreased from .14 (F - 5.10, p < .001) to .03 (F =
 1.74, n.s.), again providing evidence for mediation.

 Summary of Results

 To summarize our results, Hypotheses la, 4a,
 and 5a respectively predict a positive relationship
 between transactional contracts and neuroticism,
 equity sensitivity, and external locus of control.
 Although Hypotheses la and 4a were confirmed,
 we found no support for Hypothesis 5a, as locus of
 control was not related to reports of a transactional
 contract. Hypotheses 2a, 3a, and 6a respectively

 contracts and extraversion, conscientiousness, and
 self-esteem. Results confirmed Hypotheses 3a and
 6a but failed to support the predicted association
 between extraversion and relational contracts.

 Hypotheses lb, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, and 6b predict
 relationships between personality traits and per
 ceived breach. No relationship existed between
 perceived breach and extraversion, equity sensitiv
 ity, and self-esteem. Thus, Hypotheses 2b, 4b, and
 6b were not supported. Although neuroticism, con
 scientiousness, and locus of control were signifi
 cantly related to perceived breach (neuroticism was
 marginally so), the directions were opposite to
 those predicted in Hypotheses lb, 3b, and 5b. Un
 expectedly, individuals with high neuroticism, low
 conscientiousness, and high external locus of con
 trol were the most likely to perceive breach.

 Hypothesis 7a proposes relationships between
 relational contracts and the outcomes. This hypoth
 esis was supported in all respects, as relational
 contracts were negatively related to intentions to
 quit and positively related to job satisfaction and
 affective commitment. Similarly, full support was
 observed for Hypothesis 7b, which predicts that
 transactional contracts will be positively related to
 intentions to quit and negatively related to job sat
 isfaction and affective commitment.

 Breach was positively related to feelings of vio
 lation and intentions to quit and negatively related
 to satisfaction and commitment, thus supporting
 Hypotheses 8 and 9a. Violation mediated the rela
 tionship between perceived breach and all out
 comes, supporting Hypothesis 9b. Hypothesis 10
 proposes that all six personality traits will moder
 ate the relationship between perceived breach and
 felt violation. It was partially supported, in that
 moderator effects in the predicted direction were
 found for equity sensitivity and locus of control.

 DISCUSSION

 In general, we found reasonably good support for

 many of the hypotheses. In particular, four of the
 six predictions concerning personality and contract
 type were confirmed, with "equity sensitives" and
 neurotics reporting transactional contracts, while
 people with high conscientiousness and self
 esteem reported relational contracts. Although no
 support was found for the prediction that extro
 verts would form relational contracts, extraversion
 was negatively associated with transactional con
 tract terms. In addition, consistent support was ob
 tained for the favorable impact of a relational con
 tract on job satisfaction, affective commitment, and
 intentions to quit and the unfavorable impact of a

 transactional contract and breach of contract on
 these same outcomes. Some support was found for
 the prediction that personality would moderate the
 translation of breach into violation?as predicted,
 equity sensitives were more inclined, and externals
 were less inclined, to respond to breach with feel
 ings of violation.

 The data did not bear out our hypotheses con
 cerning the personality predictors of perceived
 breach. In particular, extraversion, equity sensitiv
 ity, and self-esteem were unrelated to breach. More
 worrisome, neuroticism was positively related to
 breach (atp < .08), as was external locus of control,
 while conscientiousness was negatively related to
 breach, all directionally counter to expectations.
 The hypothesized relationships were predicated on
 Morrison and Robinson's (1997) portrayal of breach
 as an essentially cognitive estimation. Thus, our
 predictions were based on the implications of the
 various personality dimensions for vigilance and
 information processing. If breach is a "hotter" con
 struct than the cool calculation Morrison and Rob
 inson described, our findings make sense, on the
 basis of the more emotive implications of the stud
 ied traits. For instance, neurotic personalities often
 lack trust, and such individuals might be inclined
 to see breach more easily than the less neurotic.

 There are, however, two other plausible reasons
 for our results for breach. First, it is possible that
 breach and violation are more easily separable con
 cepts for employees new to their jobs (cf. Rousseau,
 2001) than for our sample, whose members aver
 aged over 12 years of tenure. New employees are
 more likely have explicitly reasoned contracts
 based on fresh pre-employment expectations and
 are more likely to respond to breach queries as if
 they were filling out a checklist. On the other hand,
 when seasoned employees are queried about
 breach, they may aggregate instances over consid
 erable time, on the basis of the salience of these
 instances, which is surely a function of felt viola
 tion. In this case, the personality correlates of
 breach and violation would be similar. Conceptu
 ally, this argument implies a breach by tenure
 interaction when violation is being predicted, an
 interaction that we could not support with the cur
 rent data. Second, our breach hypotheses were
 founded on the expected impact of personality on
 the perception or detection of breach, not on its
 actual occurrence. However, conscientious indi
 viduals might have engaged in more careful and
 diligent job search, thus reducing the probability of
 breach. Also, organizations might be less likely to
 breach the contracts of satisfied, productive em
 ployees. Thus, the salutary consequences of consci
 entiousness, low neuroticism, intemality, and self

 esteem for both satisfaction and performance
 (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge
 et al., 2002) might account for our findings that
 neurotics and externals perceived breach but the
 conscientious did not, as well as for our null find
 ings for self-esteem. This pattern of findings sug
 gests a reciprocal relationship between breach and
 related organizational behavior, and it illustrates
 the role of enactment?the conversion of personal
 ity into job behavior and attitudes.
 We believe that this study contributes to both
 research on personality and research on contracts.
 In the domain of personality, the study joins a
 small but growing body of research that opens the
 black box to explain how personality affects or
 ganizational behavior. Barrick, Stewart, and Pi
 otrowski (2002) showed how motivation mediated
 the relationship between personality and job per
 formance, and Judge and his colleagues (1998) il
 lustrated how perceptions of core job characteris
 tics mediated the relationship between personality
 and job satisfaction. We contribute to this stream of
 research by showing that contract dynamics also
 mediate the relationship between personality and
 personal and organizational outcomes. From the
 standpoint of contracts research, we contribute ev
 idence that suggests an explanation for one of the
 most interesting phenomena in organizational be
 havior?how employees facing ostensibly identical
 job conditions self-construct either disappointing
 or rewarding relationships with their employers. A
 tentative explanation is that personality influences
 contract terms, breach perception, and feelings of
 violation.

 Three aspects of our research warrant caution in
 interpretation. First, we interpreted our findings
 concerning personality and contract type in terms
 of employee choice and construal of contracts.
 However, one of our reviewers suggested that con
 scientious individuals and those with high self
 esteem might be offered more encompassing and
 enduring relational contract terms because of their
 proclivity for high performance and job satisfac
 tion. Conversely, more dispensable externals and
 neurotics might be held to less committing transac
 tional contracts. This explanation, which is based
 on enactment, while complementary to ours, illus
 trates the need to view contracts dynamically.

 Second, our use of cross-sectional data dictated
 that we examine two essentially parallel models,
 one pertaining to contract type (personality ?? con
 tract ?? outcomes) and the other to contract breach
 (personality ?> breach ?? outcomes). However,
 breach was moderately related to both relational
 contracts (r = -.45) and transactional contracts
 (r = .22), and Robinson and her coauthors (1994)

 reported that breach led to a shift from relational to
 transactional contracts. This background raised
 questions about how much independent informa
 tion our results contained. Thus, we retested our
 hypotheses pertaining to personality and contract
 type, controlling for breach. In all cases, the results
 paralleled those for the uncontrolled tests. Simi
 larly, controlling for breach did not materially af
 fect any of the reported relationships between con
 tract type and outcomes. All in all, these results
 indicate that there is utility in discriminating be
 tween breach and contract type. However, they do
 not obviate the need for process-oriented longitu
 dinal designs that better capture the true dynamics
 of personality, contract type, breach, and violation
 over time.

 A third concern was the potential for common
 method variance, since all variables were measured
 in the same questionnaire. However, self-reports
 are the conventional way to assess both personality
 and aspects of psychological contracts. Although
 researchers have sometimes used observers or clin
 ical interviews to assess personality, such tactics
 are rare and hard to execute in the workplace. Ini
 tially, we intended to separate the measurement of
 personality in time from that of the other variables,
 but our firsthand experience at the research sites
 convinced us that doing this would badly damage
 our response rates. Nevertheless, several factors
 mitigate some concern about common method vari
 ance. First, having people describe themselves in
 general and then report their work experiences
 would seem much less prone to common method
 variance than having people both describe and
 evaluate their work in the same questionnaire. In
 our study, the link between breach or violation and
 work outcomes would seem to be most prone to
 common method variance, but this link was not the
 major focus of the research, and it has been dem
 onstrated through use of independent methods
 (Kickul, 2001). Also, we proposed and found some
 evidence for the operation of personality as a mod
 erator of the effects of breach on violation, and
 method variance, if present, would work against
 the detection of moderators. Finally, Judge and co
 authors (1998) found similar patterns of correla
 tions between personality and satisfaction (life and
 job) even when predictor and criteria were mea
 sured with independent methods. Thus, all in all,
 we are confident that our primary findings con
 cerning personality were not seriously affected by
 common method variance.

 Conducting the reported study in Pakistan was a
 decision predicated on access to the research sites.
 In planning the study, we considered but did not
 find any reason to expect that our predictions,

 based on Western research, would not apply in
 Pakistan. Having conducted the study, we had no
 specific experiences that violated this expectation.
 However, it is possible that the marginal reliabili
 ties for extraversion and locus of control and the
 unacceptable reliability for agreeableness partly re
 flect subtleties of linguistic comprehension or cul
 tural values. For example, our questionnaire ad
 ministrators reported more than one query about
 the colloquial NEO item "I am not a worrier." Also,
 the negative implication of not being agreeable in a
 collective culture might have prompted socially
 desirable responses among some employees. We
 were unable to find normative personality data for
 Pakistan to illuminate these conjectures.

 Like the samples used in most extant research on
 psychological contracts, our sample consisted
 mostly of managers, professionals, and technical
 people, an occupational elite with similar if not
 identical education and training across cultures.
 Below this elite, transactional contract dynamics
 might dominate, especially in less economically
 developed countries. Studying these occupations
 in Pakistan resulted in a sample that was almost
 totally male. However, the implications of this pre
 dominance of men are unclear given that very little
 research has examined the impact of gender on
 contract matters (Millward & Brewerton, 2000). We
 can only observe that the Pakistan locale and the
 mostly male sample did not appear to constrain
 variance in reported contract type, perceived
 breach, or experienced violation (cf. Johns, 1991).
 Two suggestions for future research pertain to
 organizational context. Except for the implication
 that contract breaches might have occurred, contex
 tual factors were not examined in this exploratory
 study. Clearly, a person by situation perspective
 would further illuminate the conditions under
 which personality might be more or less relevant to
 contract dynamics. For example, people with par
 ticular personality traits might be more susceptible
 to the breach of particular contract terms or to the
 manner in which a breach occurred (for instance, to
 perceived degree of procedural justice). Time is
 frequently a surrogate for changes in context
 (Johns, 2001), and the role of time also merits scru
 tiny. In exploratory analyses, we found significant
 tenure by personality interactions in predicting
 breach for four of the six studied traits (extraver
 sion, equity sensitivity, self-esteem, and locus of
 control). In each case, the relationship between per
 sonality and perceived breach was weaker for em
 ployees with lower tenure. This pattern of findings
 raises the possibility that newer employees face
 "strong situations" (Mischel, 1968) that constrain
 the impact of personality on perceived breach. On

 the other hand, long-tenured employees might have
 experienced a series of contractual ambiguities that
 stimulate "eye of the beholder" effects, shaped by
 personality.

 A third suggestion for future research that would
 also address the relevance of time concerns our
 earlier contention that personality might affect con
 tract dynamics via choice of employment, percep
 tual construal of one's contract, or personality
 related attitudes and behaviors enacted on a job.
 Longitudinally, this formulation implies a se
 quence?choice, construal, enactment, construal?
 that merits attention. Particularly interesting is the
 possibility that certain personality traits are differ
 entially relevant to the various events in this con
 tract cycle. More basically, the impact of enactment
 merits future attention, since extant contract theory
 is mainly silent on how work behavior and atti
 tudes on the part of employees affect changes in
 contracts over time. Although contracts may in
 deed be "psychological" (that is, construed), per
 sonality has been shown to affect important work
 attitudes and behaviors that should influence the
 actual terms offered by an employer.

 To conclude, a number of authors have mused

 about the likely importance of individual differ
 ences in matters concerning psychological con
 tracts. We have provided some tentative empirical
 evidence for the merits of this idea. At the same
 time, we have illustrated that contractual mecha
 nisms are one likely path by which personality
 affects organizational behavior.
