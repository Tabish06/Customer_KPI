An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Strategic Sourcing and Flexibility 

on Firm’s Supply Chain Agility 

 

Abstract 

 

Purpose  –  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  two  potentially  key  drivers  of  a  firm’s 

supply  chain  agility,  namely  strategic  sourcing  and  firm’s  strategic  flexibility.  Despite  some 

theoretical  and  conceptual  works  suggesting  that  some  elements  of  these  two  constructs  may 

relate to agility, this has not  yet been assessed together empirically. This study aims to address 

this gap in the literature. 

Design/Methodology/approach  -  This  study  involves  an  empirical  investigation  of  a  theory-

F

based  model  based  on  the  competence-capability  framework,  and  a  dynamic  capabilities 

o

theoretical perspective, where the internal competencies of strategic sourcing and firm’s strategic 

flexibility  relate  to  the  dynamic  capability  of  the  firm’s  supply  chain  agility. This  investigation 

r 

P

also  includes  the  testing  of  a  possible  mediation  effect  of  firm’s  strategic  flexibility  on  the 

relationship between strategic sourcing and the firm’s supply chain agility. The model is tested 

e

utilizing data from 144 U.S. manufacturing firms via partial least square (PLS) methodology. 

e

r 

R

Findings  –  The  results  of  the  empirical  study  indicated  that  both  strategic  sourcing  and  firm’s 

strategic flexibility were significantly related to the firm’s supply chain agility. In addition, while 

a full mediation effect was not found on the part of strategic flexibility, there was evidence for 

partial mediation. 

e

Research  limitations/implications  –  Given  that  the  data  is  from  specific  U.S.  industries,  the 

generalizability  of  current  findings  to  other  industries  or  countries  may  require  additional 

v
i
e

investigation.  

Originality/value – Given the attention paid to agility in terms of its importance to responding 

w

to business uncertainty, and more recently, as an important capability in managing supply chain 

disruption  risks,  this  paper  investigates  how  strategic  sourcing  and  flexibility  can  contribute  to 

agility.

INTRODUCTION 

Supply chain agility has received increasing attention over the last decade due to two important 

developments.  First,  firms  have  increasingly  been  competing  in  business  environments 

characterized by short product life cycles, globally extended supply chains, and volatile demand 

patterns. Second, issues relating to supply chain disruption risk have been gaining prominence. 

Given  such  developments,  the  cultivation  of  supply  chain  agility  has  been  suggested  as  an 

effective response strategy (Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009; Lee, 2004; Swafford et al., 2006). 

Research on issues surrounding flexibility, agility and responsiveness has been of topical 

F

interest  to  both  academics  and  practitioners.  One  of  the  key  developments  in  this  context  has 

o

r 

been  the  recognition  that  the  terms  flexibility  and  agility  have  been  used  somewhat 

interchangeably  in  the  past.  Accordingly,  a  new  research  stream  investigating  the  differences 

P

between  flexibility  and  agility  has  emerged  in  the  context  of  improving  the  competitiveness  of 

e

firms operating in volatile business conditions. Among the recent works, study of Swafford et al. 

(2006) considered flexibility-agility to have a competence-capability relationship (Prahalad and 

Hammel,  1990),  where  competence  is  about  “what  an  organization  can  do  particularly  well” 

R

(Andrews,  1987),  and  capability  is  defined  as  “appropriately  adapting,  integrating,  and 

e

reconfiguring internal  and external organizational skills, resources, and  functional competences 

e

r 

to  match  the  requirements  of  a  changing  environment”  (Teece  et  al.,  1997).  This  raises  issues 

relating  to  the  fit  of  a  competence  with  the  needs  of  an  organization  facing  fast-changing 

w

demands in the marketplace.  

This  framework  has  subsequently  been  used  in  other  studies  on  flexibility  and  agility 

(e.g., Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009; Li and Ogunmokun, 2008). It has been recognized that a 

system can be flexible without being agile, while an agile system is definitely flexible (Prahalad 

and  Hammel,  1990).  In  line  with  these  developments,  flexibility  is  defined  in  this  study  as:  a 

competence built by an organization to be able to change or react with little penalty in time, cost, 

or performance (Swafford et al., 2006) whereas a “firm’s supply chain agility” is defined as: the

capability  of  the  ﬁrm,  internally,  and  in  conjunction  with  its  key  suppliers  and  customers,  to 

adapt  or  respond  in  a  speedy  manner  to  a  changing  marketplace,    contributing  to  agility  of  the 

extended  supply  chain  (Braunscheidel  and  Suresh,  2009).  In  other  words,  while  flexibility 

concerns  the  manager  in  terms  of  what  kind  of  processes  should  be  designed,  what  kind  of 

resources  should  be  obtained  and  what  investments  made  to  reduce  time,  cost  or  performance 

penalties  to  adjust  to  changes,  agility  is  more  specifically  about  whether  the  organization  has 

made investments that are aligned with the competitive demands of the environment. 

In  addition to flexibility-agility linkage, a second emerging stream of research has been 

F

on how different sourcing strategies may contribute to the agility of a firm. Christopher (2000) 

o

was an early work recognizing the linkages between sourcing, flexibility and agility. Paulraj and 

Chen  (2007)  concluded  that  firms  become  more  agile  with  enhanced  strategic  buyer-supplier 

e

r 

relationships. Ledyard and Keough (2007) described the case of a firm which augmented agility 

e

through better information sharing with its suppliers. Swafford et al. (2006) found that sourcing 

flexibility has a positive and direct impact on agility. However, with the exception of Khan and 

Pillania  (2008),  the  above  studies  in  this  stream  have  investigated  the  influence  of  various 

R

elements  of  strategic  purchasing  with  agility,  without  considering  them  comprehensively  under 

e

the  construct  of  strategic  sourcing.  In  the  work  of  Khan  and  Pillania  (2008),  flexibility  is  not 

considered as a separate construct, and it was shown that strategic sourcing has a positive impact 

v
i
e

on supply chain agility and business performance. In Kocabasoglu and Suresh (2006), the notion 

w

of  strategic  sourcing  is  defined  as  a  construct  consisting  of  four  sub-constructs:  strategic 

purchasing,  inter-functional  integration  of  purchasing,  information  sharing  with  suppliers,  and 

supplier  development.  We  utilize  this  comprehensive  construct  of  strategic  sourcing  for  the 

current study. Table 1 provides a summary of past research studies which have partially explored 

the  linkages  between  the  three  constructs  of  strategic  souring,  flexibility  and  agility.  It  is  seen 

from Table 1 that only four studies address the issue of agility, based on various antecedents.

Given  these  developments,  it  is  of  significant  interest  currently  to  investigate  the 

influence  of  strategic  sourcing  alongside  flexibility  on  supply  chain  agility,  with  all  three 

constructs  defined  comprehensively.  This  study  is  also  based  on  a  theoretical  platform  that 

considers  strategic  sourcing  and  flexibility  as  internal  competences  which  may  lead  to  the 

capability of agility. In addition to this competence-capability relationship, we consider agility as 

a dynamic capability, drawing from the theory of dynamic capabilities (Teece et al., 1997; Teece 

2007),  which  extends  both  resource-based  view  (RBV)  of  the  firm  and  the  competence-

capability perspective.   

F

This work contributes to the research literature on agility in the following ways. First, it 

o

examines the antecedents of a firm’s agility in the supply chain context more broadly than prior 

studies. A few past studies have investigated the relationship individually between sub-elements 

of  strategic  sourcing  and  agility,  between  firm-level  flexibilities  and  firm-level  agility,  and 

e

between strategic sourcing and firm-level flexibilities. This study considers all three key factors 

(strategic  sourcing,  flexibility  and  agility)  together.  Secondly,  this  study  examines  these 

relationships  within  a  theoretical  framework  of  competence-capability  relationship,  utilizing  a 

R

dynamic  capability  perspective.  This  study  also  explores  whether  flexibility  is  a  possible 

e

mediator  between  strategic  sourcing  and  agility,  affecting  the  direct  relationship  between 

e

r 

r 

P

v
i
e

strategic sourcing and agility.  

From a methodology point of view, this study applies structural equation modeling to test 

w

the relationship among the three constructs, and a method for testing mediation effects. Thirdly, 

this  research  considers  the  influence  of  contextual  factors  such  as  firm  size,  manufacturing 

process, and the product characteristics, in order to examine the robustness of the relationships in 

various  business  settings.  Prior  works  such  as  Swafford  et  al.  (2006),  Khan  and  Pillania  (2008) 

and  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009)  did  not  consider  influences  from  the  external  environment, 

product nature, or production process.  

The next section provides the theoretical background and model development, including 

definition of the constructs and the rationale for the research hypotheses. The following section 

4

describes  data  collection  and  research  methodology.  A  discussion  of  survey  results  and 

managerial  implications  of  the  results  are  provided  next.  Finally,  the  conclusions,  limitations, 

and future research issues are mentioned in the last section. 

 

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT 

In  this  study,  strategic  sourcing  and  the  firm’s  strategic  flexibility  (FSF)  are  explored  as  two 

major  antecedent  competences  for  the  enhancement  of  the  firm’s  supply  chain  agility  (FSCA), 

which  is  viewed  as  a  dynamic  capability.  In  addition,  FSF  is  also  investigated  as  a  possible 

mediator  that  may  influence  the  relationship  between  strategic  sourcing  and  FSCA.  The 

F

o

theoretical model postulated is shown in Figure 1. The definitions for the various constructs and 

r 

P

the  rationale  for  the  hypothesized  model  structure  are  outlined  below,  after  first  describing  the 

theoretical underpinnings.  

e

A  dynamic  capabilities  perspective  (DCP)  refers  to  the  ability  of  a  firm  to  achieve  new 

------- Insert Figure 1 Approximately Here ------- 

e

r 

forms of competitive advantage by renewing competences to achieve congruence with changing 

R

business environments (Teece et al. 1997; Teece 2007). The DCP is a framework which extends 

e

and  applies  both  resource-based  view  (RBV)  and  the  competence-capabilities  perspective  to 

explain  the  sources  of  firm-level  competitive  advantage  over  time  (Teece  et  al.,  1997;  Teece 

v
i
e

2007). DCP explains how firms create value by developing relevant organizational processes and 

w

structures  to  leverage  relationship  assets.  Dynamic  capabilities,  which  continuously  create, 

extend,  upgrade,  and  protect  the  firm’s  unique  asset  base,  are  capabilities  that:  (1)  sense  and 

shape  opportunities  and  threats,  (2)  seize  chances,  and  (3)  maintain  competitiveness  through 

enhancing,  combining,  protecting,  and  reconfiguring  the  organization’s  intangible  and  tangible 

assets. This framework assumes that firms with dynamic capabilities are able to provide timely 

response,  and  rapid,  flexible  product  innovation,  coupled  with  the  management  capability  to 

effectively coordinate and redeploy organizational competencies. DCP has also been applied in 

the context of new technologies and related processes. For instance, in Wheeler (2002), DCP was

invoked to demonstrate that digital network technology (including Internet) in organizations is a 

dynamic  capability  which  enables  firms  to  create  customer  value  in  volatile  environments.  A 

description of this application was also provided by Zahra and George (2002).  

Model Constructs and Sub-Constructs 

The  first  major  construct  in  Figure  1  pertains  to  strategic  sourcing.  The  concept  of  strategic 

sourcing has evolved over the past two decades. Strategic sourcing is defined as “the process of 

designing  and  managing  supply  networks  in  line  with  operational  and  organizational 

performance objectives” (Narasimhan and Das, 1999) and is measured by the four sub-constructs 

F

of  strategic  purchasing,  internal  integration,  information  sharing,  and  supplier  development 

o

(Kocabasoglu and Suresh, 2006). The survey items for each of these sub-constructs are adopted 

from Kocabasoglu and Suresh (2006), and the four sub-constructs are explained below. 

Strategic  purchasing:  Considering  increasing  uncertainty  in  the  business  environment  due  to 

e

globalization, outsourcing and shorter product life cycles, purchasing can play a major role as a 

boundary spanning function that has ties both within the firm and with several business partners 

(Kocabasoglu and Suresh, 2006). In this study, strategic purchasing is defined as a demonstration 

R

of  the  strategic  role  of  purchasing  in  the  firm’s  long-term  planning  and,  as  explained  further 

e

e

below, this is posited to have a bearing on supply chain agility. 

Internal  integration:  It  has  been  shown  that  when  firms  consider  the  purchasing  function  in  a 

strategic  role,  internal  communication  between  purchasing  and  other  departments  occurs  more 

w

frequently and deeply (Krafcik, 1988). Integration with other departments was found to be more 

frequent within firms in which purchasing managers took a proactive role (Cavinato, 1991; Reck 

and Long, 1988) and it improves business performance (Eng, 2005; Sislian and Satir, 2000). Our 

definition  for  internal  integration  is  the  presence  of  cross-functional  communication  between 

purchasing and other functions, and integrated decision making activities.  

Information  sharing  with  suppliers:  Communication  and  information  sharing  are  effective 

means  to  maintain  mutually  beneficial  long-term  relationships  which  improve  supply  chain 

performance  (Monczka  et  al.,  1998;  Paulraj  et  al.,  2008;  Stank  et  al.,  1999).  A  comprehensive 

6 

 


International Journal of Operations and Production Management

review of information sharing in supply chains is available in Sahin and Robinson (2002). In this 

study, information sharing with suppliers refers to coordination and information sharing behavior. 

Supplier  development:  The  practice  of  supplier  development  is  aimed  at  strengthening 

relationships with key suppliers so that risk of opportunistic behavior is limited. Dyer and Singh 

(1998)  and  Dwyer  et  al.  (1987)  claimed  that  if  firms  invest  in  relationship-specific  assets  and 

have  shared  know-how,  opportunistic  risk  is  decreased  and  such  relationships  might  improve 

performance and reduce uncertainty. In this study, the definition of supplier development follows 

Krause (1999) as being any activity that a buyer undertakes to improve a supplier’s performance 

F

and/or capabilities to meet the buyer’s short-term or long-term supply needs.   

o

business  performance,  but  rarely  on  business  agility.  Strategic  purchasing  has  been  shown  to 

enhance  financial  performance  (Carr  and  Pearson,  1999;  Chen  et  al.,  2004;  Kerlinger,  1973), 

e

business  performance  (Gonzalez-Benito,  2007),  supply  chain  performance  (Paulraj  and  Chen, 

2007), and customer responsiveness (Chen et al., 2004). Strong buyer-supplier relationships have 

also been seen to improve supply chain agility (Paulraj and Chen, 2007) and enhance knowledge 

R

transfer  between  supply  chain  partners  (Squire  et  al.,  2009).  It  also  has  been  established  that 

e

better  information  sharing  with  suppliers  improves  flexibility  and  responsiveness  of  the  supply 

chain  (Schmenner  and  Tatikonda,  2005;  Stevenson  and  Spring,  2007).  Finally,  supplier 

v
i
e

development has been shown to have a positive relationship on supplier’s performance (Krause 

w

et  al.,  2000).    However,  the  focus  of  interest  in  the  current  study  is  on  the  impact  of  strategic 

sourcing on the agility dimension.  

The  second  major  construct  in  the  model  shown  in  Figure  1  pertains  to  the  firm’s 

strategic  flexibility  (FSF).  Over  the  years,  many  studies  have  categorized  various  types  of 

flexibility. Vokurka and O’Leary-Kelly (2000) provided definitions and a review of various types 

of  manufacturing  flexibility.  In  recent  years,  the  emphasis  has  shifted  from  manufacturing 

flexibility to supply chain flexibility. Vickery et al. (1999) argued that supply chain flexibility is 

composed  of  five  customer-focused  flexibilities:  product,  volume,  responsiveness  to  target

markets,  launch,  and  access  flexibilities.  They  found  that  firms  with  stronger  supply  chain 

flexibility  demonstrated  better  business  performance.  Among  the  five  flexibility  dimensions, 

volume and launch flexibilities were more linked to time-based performance measures. Sanchez 

and Perez (2005) identified ten supply chain flexibility dimensions, which were categorized into 

a framework of three layers: aggregate (supply chain), system (company) and basic (shop floor) 

levels. They found that firms tend to devote more efforts on the development of basic flexibilities 

like  volume  flexibility  and  product  flexibility  than  on  aggregate  flexibilities.  However,  it  is 

aggregate  flexibility,  including  launch  flexibility,  sourcing  flexibility,  response  flexibility,  and 

F

access  flexibility,  which  is  more  positively  related  to  firm  performance.  Hence  they  concluded 

o

that firms should emphasize more on these high-level, strategic flexibilities.  

Stevenson and Spring (2007) provided a conceptual hierarchy of flexibilities in a supply 

r 

P

e

r 

chain,  consisting  of  four  layers:  operational,  tactical,  strategic,  and  supply  chain  flexibilities. 

e

However,  no  empirical  research  was  performed  to  investigate  the  effectiveness  of  these 

flexibilities. Zhang et al. (2002; 2003) developed a framework for value chain flexibility based 

on competence and capability theory. This was tested to explore the relationships among flexible 

R

competence  (machine,  labor,  material  handling,  and  routing  flexibilities),  flexible  capability 

e

v
(volume flexibility and mix flexibility), and customer satisfaction.  
i
e

The  notion  of  strategic  flexibility  introduced  by  Worren  et  al.  (2002)  was  product  and 

technology  design  oriented.  They  measured  strategic  flexibility  by:  1)  model  variety,  2)  model 

w

introduction  rate,  and,  3)  new  product  introduction  rate.  Hitt  et  al.  (1998)  argued  that  firms 

require  strategic  flexibility  to  survive  in  an  environment  characterized  by  rapid  technological 

change.  Tachizawa  and  Thomsen  (2007)  suggested  that  supply  flexibility  has  a  strategic 

influence as well. Beckman (1990) considered that product flexibility and process flexibility are 

two types of production resource flexibility.   

The  current  research  focuses  on  the  issue  of  flexibility  from  a  strategic  perspective,  by 

taking  into  account  the  competence-capability  framework  and  an  integrative  approach  to 

strategic  flexibility.  We  measure  strategic  flexibilities  as  being  those  which  are  inter-firm  or

intra-firm  flexibilities  which  constitute  important  factors  to  enhance  a  firm’s  flexibility 

competence.  This  construct  recognizes  the  linkages  with  strategic  sourcing,  and  hence  supply 

flexibility was also considered within strategic flexibility. Thus, this construct, referred to as the 

firm’s  strategic  flexibility  (FSF)  comprises:  1)  supply  flexibility,  2)  product  design-related 

flexibility, and 3) process-related flexibilities. These three sub-constructs are defined below. 

Supply flexibility:  Duclos et al. (2003) defined supply flexibility as the ability to meet changing 

needs  from  customers  and  changing  supply  of  products,  including  mix,  volume,  product 

variations  and  new  products.  Sanchez  and  Perez  (2005)  defined  sourcing  flexibility  as  a  firm’s 

F

ability  to  find  alternative  suppliers  for  different  raw  materials  and  components.  Swafford  et  al. 

o

(2006)  defined  sourcing  flexibility  as  the  availability  of  a  range  of  options  and  the  ability  to 

r 

P

e

r 

effectively  exploit  them  so  as  to  respond  to  changing  requirements  related  to  the  supply  of 

purchased components. Similarly, Tachizawa and Thomsen (2007) considered supply flexibility 

e

as  an  ability  to  respond  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner  to  changing  requirements  of 

purchased  components.  In  the  current  study,  supply  flexibility  is  defined  as  the  buyer’s  (focal 

company)  evaluation  of  major  suppliers’  ability  to  satisfy  the  buyer’s  dynamically  changing 

R

specifications in terms of quality, time, and product mix.  

e

Product  design-related  flexibility:  This  is  an  aggregate  concept  consisting  of  three  individual 

product  design-related  manufacturing  flexibilities:  new  product  design  flexibility,  modification 

v
i
e

flexibility, and mix flexibility. Sanchez (1995) stated that product flexibility increases the range 

w

of  products  which  a  production  system  can  process  and  reduces  the  cost  and  time  required  to 

switch  production  resources.  We  thus  define  the  product  design-related  flexibility  as  the 

competence of the system to develop new products, make minor design  change,  and adjust the 

product mix to satisfy the dynamic market demand in timely and cost-effective manner.  

Process-related  flexibility:  Sanchez  (1995)  argued  that  process-related  flexibility  enhances  the 

ability of a production system to deal with internal or supply contingencies and increases the rate 

and  cost  efficiency  of  capacity  utilization.  In  the  current  study,  process-related  flexibility  is 

considered to include volume flexibility, process flexibility, and labor flexibility. Thus, we define

process-related  flexibility  as  an  internal  competence  to  adjust  the  production  processes  and 

volumes based on the changing needs of the marketplace. 

The third major construct in the research model refers to the firm’s supply chain agility 

(FSCA).  Consistent  with  the  recent  work  of  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009),  FSCA  in  this 

study is defined as the capability of the ﬁrm, internally, and in conjunction with its key suppliers 

and customers, to adapt or respond in a speedy manner to a changing marketplace, contributing 

to  agility  of  the  extended  supply  chain.  FSCA  consists  of:  1)  customer  responsiveness,  2) 

demand  response,  and  3)  joint  planning.  The  survey  items  for  the  three  sub-constructs  are 

F

adapted  from  Kocabasoglu  (2002),  and  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009).  The  specific  scale 

o

items for these measures can be seen in the Appendix.  

r 

P

Following  the  above  definitions  for  the  constructs  and  sub-constructs  in  the  model,  we 

next develop hypotheses for the various relationships in the proposed model structure.  

e

Impact of Strategic Sourcing on FSCA 

e

Past research has suggested that some of the elements of strategic sourcing are positively related 

to agility (Khan and Pillania, 2008; Mason et al., 2002; Narasimhan and Das, 1999b; Paulraj and 

R

Chen,  2007).  This  relationship  has  been  attributed  to  enhanced  buyer-seller  relationships, 

e

r 

facilitating  the  exchange  of  demand  and  supply  information,  and  helping  to  develop  inter-

organizational  trust.  However,  while  some  of  the  links  between  various  elements  of  strategic 

sourcing  and  agility  have  been  established,  the  construct  of  strategic  sourcing  as  a  whole  by 

w

collectively  considering  its  sub-dimensions  of  strategic  purchasing,  internal  integration, 

information  sharing,  and  supplier  development  has  not  been  investigated  before.  Likewise,  the 

notion  of  agility  is  expanded  in  the  current  study  to  the  firm’s  supply  chain  agility  (FSCA), 

composed  of 

the  sub-dimensions  of 

joint  planning,  demand  response,  and  customer 

responsiveness. In addition, this notion of agility and the antecedent of firm’s strategic flexibility 

(FSF)  are  viewed  in  a  competence-capability  relationship,  providing  an  opportunity  for  an 

enhanced understanding of these relationships. 

One  of  the  four  sub-constructs  of  strategic  sourcing  is  strategic  purchasing,  as  stated 

10

earlier. Strategic purchasing reflects a strategic and proactive role on the part of the purchasing 

function,  enabling  the  purchasing  function  to  work  closely  and  collaboratively  with  selected 

suppliers  in  various  planning  processes.  Similarly,  strategic  purchasing  gives  the  purchasing 

function  the  ability  to  communicate  market  demand  changes  quickly  to  suppliers,  which  may 

enable  suppliers  to  understand  and  plan  to  meet  the  changing  supply  needs  of  the  organization 

and    help  the  organization  be  responsive  to  their  customers’  needs  and  expectations.  Likewise, 

internal  integration  sub-construct  of  strategic  sourcing  provides  the  purchasing  function  the 

ability  to  recognize  changing  requirements  in  earlier  stages  when  developing  new  products  or 

F

while facing changes in the existing product mix, and giving timely information to suppliers and 

o

enabling them to respond effectively. In addition, internal integration enables different functions 

r 

P

within the firm to share information seamlessly, enabling faster and more coordinated responses 

to changing environments.  

e

Similar  positive  relationships  can  also  be  expected  between  the  other  sub-constructs  of 

e

strategic  sourcing  and  FSCA.  The  sub-construct  of  information  sharing  with  suppliers  reflects 

the ability of the organization and its suppliers to acquire information on marketplace changes as 

R

well as current supply chain inventory levels, which should enable them to collectively develop 

e

r 

demand response strategies and improve customer responsiveness. The sub-construct of supplier 

development  reflects  a  strengthening  of  the  relationships  with  key  suppliers,  enabling 

v
i
e

organizations  to  help  suppliers  build  responsiveness  capabilities  that  are  more  aligned  with 

w

market needs. With these expected relationships among the strategic sourcing elements and the 

FSCA components, we hypothesize a causal relationship between strategic sourcing and FSCA:  

Hypothesis 1.  Strategic sourcing has a positive impact on a firm’s supply chain agility. 

Impact of Strategic Sourcing on FSF   

The second hypothesis is aimed at investigating the relationship between strategic sourcing and 

the firm’s strategic flexibility (FSF), which was defined above as consisting of supply flexibility, 

product design-related flexibility and process-related flexibility.

Some  prior  studies  have  confirmed  some  positive  relationships  between  elements  of 

strategic sourcing and a few flexibility measures (e.g., Narasimhan and Das, 1999a; Das, 2001). 

Das (2001), for instance, has shown that internal integration of purchasing may improve product 

design-related flexibility. Likewise, it may be surmised that stronger external integration, enabled 

by  strategic  sourcing,  may  result  in  more  effective  co-design  of  products  and  processes  with 

suppliers and, in the process, may help build strategic flexibility. However, many of the possible 

relationships between various elements of strategic sourcing and strategic flexibility are yet to be 

fully investigated.  

F

The  positive  linkage  between  strategic  purchasing  and  supply  flexibility  aspect  may  be 

o

expected. Strategic purchasing helps the firm to identify the most appropriate supply base for its 

needs.  It  enables  a  firm  to  implement  flexible  sourcing,  and  to  reconfigure  the  supply  chain 

continuously  in  line  with  changing  flexibility  requirements  (Tachizawa  and  Thomsen,  2007). 

e

Supplier  selection  based  on  flexibility  and  internal  collaboration  are  two  major  practices  in 

r 

P

pursuit  of  this  strategy.  Development  of  long-term  buyer-supplier  relationships,  information 

sharing,  and  supplier  development,  etc.  may  all  be  expected  to  contribute  towards  supply 

R

flexibility. There is also a significant role for suppliers as input providers with the advent of just-

e

in-time  (JIT)  systems.  Supplier’s  role  in  supporting  operational  goals  such  as  flexibility  has 

become important in JIT systems. Thus, strategic purchasing may be expected to improve several 

v
i
e

dimensions of a firm’s supply flexibility. Likewise, internal integration, information sharing and 

w

supplier development sub-constructs of strategic sourcing may also be expected to be positively 

related  to  supply  flexibility  aspect.  Information  sharing  aspect  of  strategic  sourcing  allows  for 

improved  supplier  responsiveness,  due  to  suppliers  being  able  to  work  with  more  complete 

information,  contributing  to  supply  flexibility  (Tachizawa  and  Thomsen,  2007).  Better 

information  sharing  can  help  suppliers  align  their  plans  with  the  needs  of  the  buying  firm  and 

allow  for  better  preparedness  and  response  on  the  part  of  suppliers  to  changing  needs,  thus 

resulting in increased supply flexibility.  

In  addition,  strategic  purchasing,  reflecting  a  strategic  orientation  and  authority  for  the 

12 

 

e

r

purchasing function, has been shown to improve product design-related flexibility by improving 

new design, mix and product modification flexibility (Das, 2001).  The link between information 

sharing  and  process  related  flexibility  has  been  partially  validated  by  Narasimhan  and  Das 

(1999a), who showed that information sharing specifically improved volume flexibility, which is 

a  part  of  process-related  flexibility.  Information  sharing  and  supplier  development  were  also 

examined by Suarez et al. (1996) on how they enable the suppliers to quickly respond to product 

feature  changes  and  improve  the  new  design  flexibility  and  modification  flexibility  for  the 

buying company. 

F

Thus, it may be expected that process-related flexibility may be positively influenced by 

o

strategic sourcing. Volume flexibility, process flexibility, and labor flexibility are considered to 

r 

P

v
i
e

measure the process-related flexibility. Volume flexibility is improved when the supplier has the 

ability to respond quickly and efficiently to unexpected changes through enhanced relationships 

e

created from sharing information and supplier development (Narasimhan and Das, 1999a). 

e

Supplier development sub-construct of strategic sourcing may help a buying firm support 

the  development  of  its  supplier’s  process  flexibility,  the  ability  to  produce  efficiently  in  small 

R

quantities, etc. Past research has also shown it to be positively related to product design related 

e

r 

flexibility (Narasimhan and Das, 1999a; Suarez et al. 1996). Similar to the case of information 

sharing,  the  relationship  between  supplier  development  and  process-related  flexibility  has  been 

partially  validated.  Thus,  based  on  the  above  fragmented  findings,  and  expected  relationships, 

w

the second hypothesis is advanced as: 

Hypothesis 2: Strategic sourcing has a positive impact on a firm’s strategic flexibility. 

Impact of FSF on FSCA 

Flexibility has been stated to be a major antecedent of  agility in recent  research  (Aitken  et  al., 

2002; Swafford et al., 2006). It may be expected that a firm’s strategic flexibility may influence 

all three elements of FSCA, joint planning, demand response and customer responsiveness. For 

instance,  supply  flexibility  aspect  of  FSF  may  be  expected  to  strongly  influence  joint  planning 

aspect  of  FSCA.  When  the  supplier  can  consistently  satisfy  the  buyer’s  requirement,  trust  and

stronger relationship are created between the firms so that the buying company is motivated to 

work  closely  with  the  supplier.  In  addition,  supply  flexibility  ensures  that  the  suppliers  are 

capable  of  supporting  organizations  for  their  changing  supply  needs,  thus  improving  demand 

response and customer responsiveness aspects of FSCA. Krause and Scannell (2002) suggested 

that the imperative of working closely is a required foundation for joint planning and many other 

supply  chain  practices.  Hence,  through  the  development  of  trust,  supply  flexibility  may  have  a 

positive  impact  on  the  level  of  joint  planning.  Similarly,  demand  response  and  customer 

responsiveness aspects of FSCA may be influenced by supply flexibility. Supply flexibility may 

F

enable  fast  response  to  demand  variations  and  customer  requirement  in  dynamic  markets, 

o

characterized by short product life cycles, more product variety, and customization, and may thus 

r 

positively influence demand response and customer responsiveness. .  

P

Likewise,  design-related  flexibility  may  be  expected  to  significantly  affect,  primarily 

e

demand  response  and  customer  responsiveness  aspects  of  FSCA.  The  trend  towards  shorter 

product life cycles, more product variety, and increased pressure for customized products is well 

recognized  and  firms  that  have  adequate  levels  design-related-flexibility  may  be  more  in  line 

R

with their customers’ needs, thus contributing to demand response and customer responsiveness. 

e

The  third  aspect  of  FSF,  process-related  flexibility  may  provide  a  firm  the  ability  to 

change its production plan and product designs in response to new information about changing 

demand  trends  and  customization.  Manufacturers  adopting  a  push  strategy  make  production 

w

plans  several  periods  before  demand  is  observed  so  that  it  may  be  hard  to  change  from  one 

product  to  the  other.  And  even  for  supply  chains  that  utilize  a  pull  strategy  downstream,  it  is 

unlikely  that  the  entire  chain  can  benefit  from  this  strategy.  Under  such  limitations,  firms  with 

superior process-related flexibility may more efficiently meet changing demands. Thus, a strong 

linkage  between  process-related  flexibility  and  demand  response  and  customer  responsiveness 

aspects of FSCA may be expected.  

Thus, all three FCF sub-constructs may be expected to have positive impacts on demand 

response  and  customer  responsiveness  dimensions  of  FSCA.  Flexibility  and  agility  have

frequently been discussed together, as overlapping concepts in much of past research (e.g. Aitken 

et  al.,  2002).  A  clear  distinction  between  these  two  concepts  and  empirically  validation  of  the 

resulting constructs is of recent origin (Swafford et al., 2006). In the current study, we investigate 

the  relationship  between  FSF  and  FSCA  more  comprehensively,  and  thus  the  above  arguments 

lead to the following hypothesis:   

Hypothesis  3:  A  firm’s  strategic  flexibility  has  a  positive  impact  on  the  firm’s  supply 

chain agility.

The above three hypotheses are aimed at investigating the relationship between every two of the

three major constructs. However, in order to investigate the mediation effect of FSF, which may 

or  may  not  enhance  the  influence  of  strategic  sourcing  on  FSCA,  it  is  necessary  to  conduct  a 

comparison between the direct and the indirect impacts of strategic sourcing on FSCA. 

e

 

Fisher  (1997)  argued  that  a  supply  chain  has  both  a  physical  distribution  and  market 

mediation  function.  While  the  physical  distribution  function  focuses  on  getting  the  products  to 

the market efficiently, the market mediation function is primarily related to scanning the market 

to make sure that a firm (or a set of firms in the supply chain) seizes opportunities in the market 

e

by  synchronizing  the  demand  with  their  supply.  This  raises  the  following  question  about  the 

exact nature of the relationship between strategic sourcing and FSCA. If one considers only the 

v
i
e

physical function, strategic sourcing can be primarily seen as comprehending procurement needs 

w

of an organization and ensuring the arrival of supplies consistent with these needs. If one focuses 

on  the  market  mediation  aspect,  the  question  becomes  whether  there  is  additional  information 

that  purchasing  can  collect,  given  its  boundary  spanning  role  and  its  relationships  with  other 

firms  regarding  the  market,  which  may  help  a  firm  synchronize  the  supply  with  end-customer 

demands  better.  If  the  former  scenario  applies,  one  may  expect  flexibility  to  fully  mediate  the 

relationship between strategic sourcing and agility since the positive or negative contributions of 

strategic  sourcing  will  be  fully  absorbed  by  the  internal  operations.  If,  on  the  other  hand, 

purchasing has a role in market mediation, one would not expect to see full mediation.

No prior study, to the best of our knowledge, has considered this issue. Khan and Pillania 

(2008)  tested  only  the  direct  influence  of  the  implementation  of  strategic  sourcing  on  supply 

chain  agility.  The  possible  mediating  effects  of  flexibility  in  this  relationship  has  not  been 

considered in past research. Thus we formulate the following hypothesis:  

Hypothesis  4:  There  is  a  significant  mediation  effect  from  FSF  on  the  relationship 

between strategic sourcing and the firm’s supply chain agility. 

 

Control Variables 

Four control variables are considered in this study: 1) firm size, 2) type of production process, 3) 

F

product seasonality, and  4) product perishability.  It may be expected that  firm size may  have a 

o

negative relationship with FSCA. Cohen and Klepper (1992) claimed that small firms have more 

r 

creativity  and  agility,  while  larger  firms  may  be  bureaucratic.  Firm  size,  thus,  may  have  a 

P

negative  impact  on  the  development  of  FSCA.  Rogers  (1995)  suggested  that  firm  size  is 

e

commonly  applied  as  a  control  variable  to  serve  as  a  surrogate  measure  of  total  resources  and 

organization structure. Prior studies have used either sales or the number of full time employees 

(FTE) to measure firm size. In this study, the number of FTE is applied.  

R

Production  process,  the  second  control  variable,  included  engineer-to-order,  make-to-

e

order,  assemble-to-order,  and  make-to-stock  process  types.  Lee  (1996)  asserted  that  production 

e

r 

process  is  strongly  related  to  the  level  of  customization  and  the  level  of  inventory,  either  as 

work-in-process or the final product. Lamming et al. (2000) suggested that high inventory level, 

w

which  implies  mass  production  and  less  customization,  may  be  necessary  to  develop  agility  in 

response of market dynamics. Based on this logic, it is expected that the production process may 

have an influence on the model relationships.  

Product seasonality and product perishability are two causes for demand uncertainty. van 

Hoek et al. (2001) suggested that agility is important to create competitive advantages in current 

dynamic market characterized with uncertain demand. Likewise, Baker (2008) stated that agility 

is needed to cope with the demand uncertainty caused by seasonality, short product life cycles, 

and consumer demand fluctuations. Firms facing strong demand uncertainty may be more likely

to implement an agility developing strategy. Hence, product seasonality and product perishability 

are expected to have an influence on the model relationships.    

 

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

To develop the survey instrument, an extensive literature review was first conducted to identify 

scales  used  in  past  literature  that  were  shown  to  have  strong  validity  and  reliability.  The  first 

draft  of  this  survey  instrument  was  tested  through  reviews  and  semi-structured  interviews  with 

supply  chain  professionals,  business  consultants  and  academics  in  U.S.  and  Netherlands.  The 

survey  was  sent  to  the  interviewees  in  advance.  During  interviews  lasting  between  30  to  90 

F

minutes, the interviewees were asked to provide suggestions to improve the clarity of the survey, 

the format and the time required for completing the questionnaire. The survey was then refined 

based  on  the  suggestions  received.  A  pilot  study  was  then  conducted  and  the  results  were

analyzed to ensure avoidance of systematic bias in the survey instrument. 

 

The specific questions for each variable, the sources and anchors for the questions in final 

survey instrument are provided in the Appendix. In addition to items relating directly to the three 

major research constructs, several questions for the contextual factors were selected to serve as 

e

control variables. A 5-point Likert scale was used, with two different schemes: very low to very 

v
i
high, and strongly disagree to strongly agree, as shown in the Appendix.  
e

The  respondents  for  the  final  survey  were  selected  from  senior  supply  chain  and 

w

purchasing executives of manufacturing firms in the U.S. who were members of the Institute for 

Supply  Management  (ISM).  Senior-level  executives  were  deemed  to  be  at  a  sufficiently  high 

level in the organizational hierarchy to have supply chain-level visibility and knowledge. High-

ranking  respondents,  with  sufficient  level  of  seniority  tend  to  be  more  reliable  sources  of 

information than their subordinates, in accordance with Phillips (1981) and numerous other past 

studies. In accordance with Dillman's (1978) guidelines for mail surveys, a mailing package was 

sent,  which  included  a  letter  of  support  from  ISM,  a  cover  letter  from  the  investigators  of  this 

study, the questionnaire, and a paid return envelope. A reminder postcard was mailed two weeks

later. The survey was sent to 1972 potential respondents, after which 144 valid responses were 

obtained  with  a  response  rate  7.3%,  which  is  consistent  with  other  empirical  studies  using 

complex  survey  instrument.  For  instance,  the  response  rate  was  7.25%  in  the  study  of  Kristal, 

Huang, and Roth (2010); 6.4% in Tan and Vonderembse (2006), etc. One method for testing non-

response bias is to test for significant differences between the responses of early and late waves 

of  returned  surveys  via  t-tests  (Armstrong  and  Overton,  1977).  We  utilized  this  approach  of 

comparing early and late respondents in terms of demographic variables (e.g. annual sales, full 

time equivalent employees). The t-tests yielded no statistically significant differences among the 

F

demographic variables. 

o

The survey respondents were from firms belonging to SIC codes 34 to 38. It can be seen 

that the respondents were primarily from firms in either the growth or maturity stages of their life 

cycles. Regarding firm size, the annual sales for most firms was 20 to 99.99 million, or 100 to 

e

499.99 million dollars. About 50% of the responding firms carried less than 500 stock keeping 

r 

P

units (SKUs) as finished products. A summary of the respondent profile is provided in Table 2.  

To  investigate  the  relationships  among  the  major  constructs  by  using  the  partial  least 

R

squares (PLS) technique, SmartPLS 2.0 (Ringle et al., 2005) was used to assess the measurement 

e

model  and  structural  model.  PLS  analysis  was  chosen  because  it  can  analyze  all  paths  at  once 

(Barclay  et  al.,  1995;  Gefen  et  al.,  2000)  and  does  not  require  a  large  sample  size  (Gefen  and 

v
i
e

Straub,  2005).  To  test  the  relationships,  all  measurement  items  were  standardized  and  missing 

w

values were replaced by sample means to examine validity, reliability, and statistical power. The 

bootstrapping method was used, which approximates the sampling distribution of an estimator by 

re-sampling with replacement from the original sample (Moore and McCabe, 2005; Temme et al., 

2006), to derive more reliable results. The size of subsamples to run the bootstrapping technique 

followed the suggestions in Efron and Tibshirani (1998, p.52). 

To test second-order constructs in the model, a repeated indicators approach, also known 

as  the  hierarchical  component  model  (Wold,  1982)  was  used.  This  technique  is  widely  used  to 

estimate higher order constructs for PLS studies (Wilson, 2007; Zhang et al., 2006). The impacts

Measurement Model 

Figure  1  provides  overall  results  for  the  hypothesized  model.  A  good  model  fit  in  PLS  is  seen 

when there are significant path coefficients, acceptable R2 values, and good construct reliability 

(Gefen et al., 2000). This is seen in Figure 1. The predictability of the model, reflected by the R2 

values, is another important determinant of the strength of the model (Chin, 1998; Komiak and 

Benbasat, 2004). The R2 value for the second-order variables are acceptable (25% for FSCA and

13% for FSF) when compared to the R2 values seen in past empirical research studies in supply 

chain management.   

 

For  the  assessment  of  reliability,  composite  reliability  and  average  variance  extracted 

(AVE), shown in Table 3 are the two main measurements used in this study. Composite reliability 

does  not  assume  that  all  indicators  are  equally  weighted  (Chin,  1998)  which  implies  that 

composite  reliability  may  be  more  appropriate  to  measure  reliability.  Composite  reliability  is 

recommended to be larger than 0.7 (Barclay et al., 1995; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The other 

measure,  AVE,  denotes  the  amount  of  variance  that  a  construct  captures  from  its  indicators 

F

relative  to  the  amount  due  to  measurement  error  (Chin,  1998).  For  the  first-order  factor,  the 

o

recommended minimal critical value for AVE is 0.5 (Hu et al., 2004). The composite reliability 

v
i
e

and AVE values shown  in Table 3 are seen to meet these  criteria though  the AVE for demand 

response is relatively smaller than the desired value. 

e

Convergent  validity  is  the  ability  of  items  in  a  scale  to  converge  or  load  together  as  a 

e

single  construct.  It  is  measured  by  examining  individual  loadings  for  each  block  of  indicators. 

The  standardized  loadings  should  be  greater  than  0.7,  implying  that  the  indicators  share  more 

R

variance  with  their  respective  latent  variable  than  with  error  variance.  A  lower  bound  of  0.50 

e

r 

may  be  sufficient  (Chin,  1998).  Table  4  provides  a  list  of  standardized  loadings  for  each 

construct, and it is seen that they are above the acceptable minimum values. As for second-order 

constructs, convergent validity is established by having path coefficients that are significant, and 

w

greater  than  0.7,  between  each  1st  order  construct  and  the  corresponding  2nd  order  construct 

(Fornell and Larcker, 1981). All the path coefficients in this study are statistically significant and 

greater than 0.5. Although the numerical value for several path coefficients do not satisfy the 0.7 

critical value, since these 2nd-order constructs were  considered in prior studies, we believe that 

the level of convergent validity is acceptable.  

Discriminant  validity  represents  how  well  each  item  factor  links  to  its  hypothesized 

construct  relative  to  others  (Kerlinger,  1973;  Swafford  et  al.,  2006).  Discriminant  validity  is 

estimated  through:  1)  cross-loadings,  and  2)  the  relationship  between  correlations  among  first-

20 

 


International Journal of Operations and Production Management

Page 22 of 64

order constructs and the square roots of AVE (Chin, 1998; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The cross-

loadings  shown  in  Table  5  exhibit  adequate  levels  of  discriminant  validity  for  each  construct. 

Every item factor in the highlighted areas of Table 5 shows strong loadings to the corresponding 

latent  construct  and  low  loadings  to  other  constructs.  The  relationship  between  square  roots  of 

the  AVE  values  and  the  correlations  among  first-order  latent  constructs  support  the  same 

conclusion.  In  Table  3,  it  is  seen  that  the  square  roots  of  AVE  (bold  numbers  in  diagonal)  are 

greater than the correlations among the constructs (off-diagonal values).  

To test for common method bias, the analytical approach proposed by Liang et al., (2007) 

F

was  adopted.  Based  on  the  insignificant  test  results  obtained,  it  was  concluded  that  common 

o

method bias was not a concern in the study.

P

Structural Model 

The results from evaluation of the structural model are reported in Figure 1 and Table 6. First, in 

e

Figure 1, it can be seen that the standardized path coefficient from strategic sourcing to FSCA is 

e

r 

significant (0.347; p < 0.01). Thus, a high level of strategic sourcing is seen to result in a high 

level of FSCA, lending  support to H1. Likewise, the path coefficient from strategic sourcing to 

R

FSF  is  also  significant  (0.353;  p  <  0.05),  supporting  the  notion  that  strategic  sourcing  has  a 

e

positive  impact  on  the  level  of  FSF.  Hence,  H2  is  supported.  The  standardized  path  coefficient 

from FSF to FSCA is also statistically significant with a path coefficient of 0.229 (p < 0.05). This 

v
i
e

result lends support to hypothesis H3 that a high level of FSF significantly contributes towards a 

w

high level of FSCA. Thus, it can be stated that the level of FSCA is positively influenced by both  

implementation of strategic sourcing and the improvement of the levels of FSF.

In order to test for the mediation effects of FSF (Hypothesis 4), the guidelines of Baron 

and  Kenny  (1986)  were  followed:  two  separate  models,  as  shown  in  Figure  1,  needed  to  be 

assessed: one with FSF and one without FSF, in order to assess the direct path coefficient of the 

relationship  between  strategic  sourcing  and  FSCA.  This  procedure  has  also  been  adopted  in  

many  other  studies  e.g.,  Shamir  et  al.  (1998).  This  procedure  states  three  conditions  for  the 

presence  of  a  full  mediation  effect:  1)  variations  in  level  of  the  independent  variable  (strategic 

sourcing)  significantly  account  for  variations  in  the  presumed  mediator  (FSF),  2)  variations  in 

F

the mediator (FSF) significantly account for variations in the dependent variable (FSCA), and, 3) 

o

when  the  paths  between  independent  variable  and  mediator,  and  between  mediator  and 

r 

P

dependent  variable  are  controlled,  a  previously  significant  relation  between  the  independent 

variable (strategic sourcing) and dependent variable (FSCA) is no longer significant. 

e

Table  7  shows  the  results  for  the  two  PLS  models:  the  hypothesized  model  with 

e

mediation  effect  and  the  alternate  model  without  FSF  to  assess  the  direct  effects  of  strategic 

sourcing  on  FSCA.  In  the  alternate  model,  strategic  sourcing  was  analyzed  as  the  only 

R

independent  variable.  Firm  size,  production  process,  product  seasonality,  and  product 

e

r 

perishability were considered as control variables in both models. It can be seen in Table 7 that 

the path coefficients for the hypothesized model are both positive and significant. The alternate 

v
i
e

PLS model indicates that FSCA is positively and significantly related to strategic sourcing. Our 

w

results  meet  the  first  two  conditions,  requiring  FSF  to  be  influenced  by  strategic  sourcing,  and 

FSCA to be significantly affected by FSF. However, the results do not meet the third necessary 

condition that the path coefficient between strategic sourcing and FSCA becomes insignificant or 

at  least  reduced.  Since  the  path  coefficient  between  strategic  sourcing  and  FSCA  remains  as 

significant and strong, it can be concluded that a full mediation effect of FSF does not exist.

On the other hand, according to Sosik et al. (2009), partial mediation exists when the path 

F

coefficients between the predictor variable, strategic sourcing, and the intervening variable, FSF, 

o

and between the intervening variable and outcome variable,  FSCA, are  significant. Thus, since 

the direct path and the two mediating paths were both significant, a partial mediation effect can 

stated to exist, and thus H4 is supported for a partial mediation effect.  

e

The path coefficients for all four control variables are positive but insignificant, as seen in 

e

Figure  1.  The  values  for  the  path  coefficient  from  firm  size,  production  process,  product 

r 

seasonality, and product  perishability to FSCA  are 0.07, 0.01, 0.08, and 0.02, respectively. The 

R

insignificant  path  coefficients  imply  that  these  factors  do  not  influence  the  relationships  in  the 

e

proposed  model.  The  model  relationships  among  strategic  sourcing,  strategic  flexibility  and 

r 

P

agility were thus found to be robust, regardless of the settings of the contextual variables.

DISCUSSION & MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS 

The research  results are  discussed below in the following order.  First, the relationship between 

strategic sourcing and a firm’s supply chain agility (FSCA) is discussed. The impact of strategic 

sourcing on a firm’s strategic flexibility (FSF) is described next, followed by an examination of 

the relationship between FSF and FSCA. The mediation effect of FSF, which was not found to 

exist, is discussed next, followed by a discussion on the influence of contextual factors on FSCA. 

Impact of Strategic Sourcing on FSCA  

Strategic  sourcing,  consisting  of  strategic  purchasing,  internal  integration,  information  sharing,

and supplier development, were found to be direct antecedents of FSCA, explaining a significant 

portion of the variance in the FSCA construct. In addition, strategic sourcing was also found to 

have  an  indirect  relationship  to  FSCA  through  FSF.  These  results  empirically  validate  the 

assertions made by Das (2001), Paulraj and Chen (2007), and Khan and Pillania (2008) that the 

adoption of strategic sourcing may be a contributing factor for supply chain agility. The results 

support the notion that the implementation of strategic sourcing enhances a firm’s supply chain 

agility  (FSCA)  in  order  to  adapt  or  respond  in  a  speedy  manner  to  marketplace  changes,  both 

before and after the changes have occurred.   

F

From a dynamic capabilities perspective, Teece  et  al. (1997) suggested that competitive 

o

advantages  result  from  a  firm’s  distinctive  processes,  specific  asset  positions,  and  evolutionary 

r 

P

v
i
e

path.  Strategic  sourcing,  especially  enhanced  buyer-supplier  relationships  through  information 

sharing and supplier development practices, may be regarded  as a  competence and expected to 

e

improve  performance  and  competitiveness.  More  specifically,  strategic  sourcing  is  also 

considered  a  structural  asset  for  external  linkages  in  dynamic  capabilities  and,  thus,  has  an 

important bearing on how competencies and capabilities co-evolve and develop. Hence, FSCA is 

R

seen  to  be  a  critical  dynamic  capability  in  a  volatile  environment,  consistent  with  earlier  

e

e

r 

assertions (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2007).  

Strategic  purchasing  helps  to  select  a  group  of  strategic  suppliers  to  develop  a  possible 

long-term  partnership.  Internal  integration  enables  purchasing  to  understand  the  needs  of  other 

w

functions like design, R&D and production. These two elements of strategic sourcing provide a 

basis  for  the  company  to  connect  its  internal  functions  with  external  partners  through  one 

strategic  and  informative  purchasing  function.  Information  sharing  and  supplier  development 

then enhances the relationship between the firm and its selected suppliers. The close relationship 

and  the  strategic  role  of  purchasing,  thus,  provide  a  foundation  to  conduct  joint  planning, 

response to market demand change,  and satisfy  specific  customer  requirements on the product. 

These  associations  are  examined  through  the  correlations  between  factors.  Thus,  firms  can 

strengthen FSCA and improve the performance through the implementation of strategic sourcing.

Impact of Strategic Sourcing on FSF  

FSF was also found to be affected by the adoption of strategic sourcing. We found that strategic 

sourcing  has  significant  and  positive  influence  on  product  design-related  flexibility  (mix 

flexibility,  new  design  flexibility,  and  modification  flexibility),  process-related  flexibility 

(volume flexibility and labor flexibility), and supply flexibility. These results mostly satisfy our 

expectations  in  studying  the  relationship  between  strategic  sourcing  and  the  internal  strategic 

flexibility competence, which serves as the foundation for the competence-capability mechanism 

in flexibility-agility relationship.  
F

The only inconclusive relationship observed was between strategic sourcing and machine 

o

flexibility within process-related flexibilities. This result is consistent with the arguments made 

by Narasimhan and Das (1999a) that strategic sourcing may not have a bearing on machine and 

labor  flexibilities.  However,  a  positive  association  was  found  between  strategic  sourcing  and 

e

multi-functionality of labor.  

Impact of FSF on FSCA  

e

r 

FSF  was  found  to  be  an  antecedent  of  FSCA.  This  part  of  the  investigation  confirms  past 

R

findings that flexibility is a valid antecedent to develop agility under the competence/capability 

e

paradigm (e.g. Swafford et al., 2006). Yet, this study extends past research beyond the focal firm 

r 

P

a little more to the supply chain level by evaluating supply flexibility in addition to the flexibility 

v
i
e

within the focal firm.  

w

Impact of Mediation Effect of Flexibility  

In this study, two causal paths were investigated between strategic sourcing and FSCA. The first 

is a direct path connecting the two factors while the other considers FSF as a mediator, linking 

strategic sourcing and FSCA. Prior studies have investigated relationships among selected pairs 

of  sub-constructs  of  these  three  factors,  but  none  has  explored  mediation  effects  of  flexibility. 

The  results  demonstrate  that  the  direct  effect  of  strategic  sourcing  on  FSCA  is  greater  than  the 

indirect influence through FSF. Thus, although it might be concluded that the implementation of 

strategic  sourcing  in  itself  contributes  significantly  and  directly  to  external-facing  FSCA,  FSF 

28

does  have  a  partially  mediating  influence  on  the  enhancement  of  FSCA.  This  is  a  new  finding 

resulting from the current study.  

 

CONCLUSIONS 

A  firm’s  supply  chain  agility  is  a  critical  capability  for  survival  in  today’s  dynamic  business 

environments.  Given  this  fact,  this  work  examined  the  antecedent  role  of  strategic  sourcing  in 

building FSCA and investigated the influence of contextual factors on the FSCA. Building on the 

foundations of works such as Kocabasoglu and Suresh (2006), Swafford et al. (2006), Khan and 

Pillania  (2008),  and  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009),  this  research  extended  our  current 

F

o

understanding of FSCA in the following ways.  

r 

P

Strategic  sourcing  was  examined  in  conjunction  with  the  firm’s  strategic  flexibility,  as 

antecedents  of  FSCA.  This  study  applied  dynamic  capabilities  theoretical  perspective  and  the 

e

competence-capability  relationship  to  construct  and  examine  the  relationships  among  the  three 

e

r 

latent factors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first in the research stream of supply chain 

agility  to  utilize  these  theoretical  bases.  The  findings  also  showed  that  strategic  sourcing  has  a 

R

greater  influence  on  FSCA  than  FSF.  In  addition,  the  mediation  effect  of  FSF  was  not  to  be 

e

significant.  This  finding  adds  to  the  findings  of  previous  studies,  which  primarily  focused  on 

only  two  of  the  three  variables  considered  at  a  time.  For  example,  in  Swafford  et  al.  (2006), 

v
i
e

supply  chain  process  flexibility  was  proposed  to  directly  contribute  to  the  development  of 

w

internal  supply  chain  agility.  Khan  and  Pillania  (2008)  investigated  the  relationship  between 

strategic  sourcing  and  supply  chain  agility.  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009)  tested  the 

relationship  between  FSCA  and  organizational  practices  and  provided  a  more  comprehensive 

formation for FSCA.  

This  study  also  examined  the  influence  of  contextual  factors  on  FSCA.  This  research 

responds  to  van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk's  (2008)  call  to  investigate  the  effect  of  business 

conditions in survey studies. Through path analysis, none of the investigated contextual variables 

presented  a  significant  impact  on  FSCA.  Hence  it  can  be  stated  that  a  manufacturing  firm  can

augment  business  agility  through  strategic  sourcing  and  flexibility  initiatives  regardless  of  the 

specific  business  conditions  or  business  characteristics  such  as  firm  size  is,  production  process 

used, and whether the products offered have seasonality or perishability characteristics.  

Since  FSCA  research  is  still  in  its  early  stages,  a  set  of  reliable  and  generally-accepted 

measurements are still under development. This study was based on US manufacturing firms. As 

another  possible  future  extension,  it  may  be  important  to  understand  whether  similar 

relationships are observed in service industries. Service industries have significant influences in 

every supply chain to fulfill end consumer demand and to develop the supply chain agility.  It is 

F

of great value to consider service industries such as the retail sector, when discussing the issues 

o

of supply chain agility. In addition, considering the importance of FSCA to survive in a dynamic 

market, it is critical to identify other antecedent factors by considering other manufacturing and 

r 

P

non-manufacturing practices and organizational perspectives.   

e

Some  of  the  common  limitations  of  survey-based  research  apply  to  this  study  as  well. 

e

These include, for instance, the limitations arising from reliance on key informants and the need 

for further research improvements in the assessment and reduction of common methods variance. 

R

Furthermore,  the  survey  data  are  cross-sectional,  which  may  limit  the  predictive  ability  of  the 

e

r 

conclusions over time. In addition, due to the limited number of observations in the survey data, 

this  study  might  only  partially  revalidate  the  finding  so  prior  works.  Likewise,  there  may  be 

v
i
e

other  limitations  arising  from  the  methods  applied.  The  use  of  PLS  is  still  relatively  in  the 

w

nascent stages, despite its strong theoretical groundings. PLS is often used when faced with small 

sample sizes, in conjunction with bootstrapping. In such cases, the stability of path coefficients 

may be reduced since bootstrapping is strongly influenced by the variation in the original sample.

RESPONSES TO REVIEWER 

 
Responses to Reviewer 1: 
 
Responses to Comments under “Other Remarks” 
1. Hypotheses - the hypotheses (especially H1 - H3) are not new, and most of them have been 
tested. 

We  thank  the  reviewer  for  this  comment.  We  seem  to  have  given  the  wrong  impression 
somehow  that  H1-H3  are  not  new.  In  the  revised  manuscript,  we  have  now  more  clearly 
brought out the new contributions of the study in the Introduction, as follows:  

• This study is based on a theoretical platform that considers both strategic sourcing and 
flexibility  as  internal  competences  which  may  lead  to  the  dynamic  capability  of  agility. 
This is a new, theory-based aspect in this stream of research. 

F

• In  addition  to  the  above  competence-capability  theoretical  framework,  we  consider 
supply  chain  agility  as  a  dynamic  capability,  drawing  from  the  theory  of  dynamic 
capabilities  (Teece  et  al.,  1997;  Teece  2007),  which  extends  both  resource-based  view 
(RBV) of the firm and the competence-capability perspective.  This is again new. 

o

r
 

• This study examines the  antecedents of a firm’s agility in the supply chain context more 
broadly  than  prior  studies.  The  limited  past  studies  on  agility  have  investigated  the 
relationship  between  sub-elements  of  strategic  sourcing  and  agility;  or  sub-elements  of 
firm-level  flexibilities  and  agility.  This  study  considers  all  three  key  factors  (strategic 
sourcing, flexibility and agility) together.  

e

e

P

• We  have  also  relied  on  broader  definitions  for  all  three  constructs,  unlike  past  studies 
which have been based on sub-elements of these constructs, and based the study on more 
comprehensive  definitions  of  the  constructs,  and  tested  the  relationships  in  a  broader 
framework.  

R

r
 

• From  a  methodology  point  of  view,  this  study  applies  structural  equation  modelling  to 
test  the  relationship  among  the  three  constructs,  and  a  method  for  testing  mediation 
effects in this context.  

• This  research  considers  the  influence  of  contextual  factors  such  as  firm  size, 
manufacturing  process,  and  the  product  characteristics,  in  order  to  examine  the 
relationships in various business settings in contrast to prior studies such as Swafford et 
al. (2006), Khan and Pillania (2008) and Braunscheidel and Suresh (2009). 

w

e

v
i
e

• This  study  also  introduces  discussion  on  the  interdependence  and  balance  between 
purchasing  and  manufacturing  activities  and  how  they  jointly  contribute  to  agile  supply 
chains.   

• Flexibility  and  agility  have  frequently  been  discussed  as  interchangeable  terms  in  past 
literature (e.g. Aitken et al., 2002). A separation and clear distinction between flexibility 
and  agility  have  been  conceptualized  and  empirically  validated  only  quite  recently,  in 
studies such as (Swafford et al., 2006) and in this study. 

• Likewise, in various other parts of the paper, we have now attempted to clearly bring out 

the new aspects investigated in this paper.

2. Research limitations section - The authors listed some trivia limitations such as the ability 
to generalize findings to other industries and country, but failed to mention the more severe 
problems of the research - both methodology and analysis related issues. 

Thanks…. We have added a few more substantive limitations in the end.   

 
3. This manuscript is extremely long (47 pages!).  The introduction is almost 4 pages long. 
 
Yes,  indeed….  The  previous  manuscript  was  quite  long.  We  noticed  redundancies  in  the 
Literature Review and Model Development sections, and elsewhere. We have now eliminated 
the  Literature  Review  section,  moving  its  contents  to  Introduction  and  Model  Development 
stages,  and  eliminating  duplications.  This  also  conforms  to  the  format  of  more  recent 
empirical research papers.  We also combined Figures1 and 2, etc.  

The revised manuscript is now only 31 pages of text, including the tables which are 
placed within the text. We kept the tables within the text to conform to IJOPM format.  The 
References and one figure come after this.   
 
4. Why used PLS and not Lisrel, Mplus or EQS? 

F

o

The  primary  reason  for  using  the  partial  least  squares  (PLS),  rather  than  the  covariance-
based  technique  of  structural  equation  modelling  (SEM)  was  the  small  sample  size.  This 
issue,  and  some  other  aspects  of  PLS  that  made  it  the  preferred  methodology  is  expanded 
upon in the subsequent paragraphs.  

e

P

e

Similar to covariance-based SEM, the structural and measurement models under PLS 
(Wold, 1966; Lohmohller, 1989; Chin, 1998a, b; 2001) consist of three sets of relations: (a) 
The  inner  (structural)  model,  which  specifies  the  relationships  between  latent  variables,  (b) 
The  outer  (measurement)  model,  which  specifies  the  relationships  between  the  latent 
variables and their associated observed variables, and (c) The weight relations upon which 
the case values for the latent variables can be estimated.

The  PLS  method  is  designed  to  maximize  prediction  rather  than  fit  (Anderson  and 
Gerbing, 1988). That is, PLS differs in its approach from other structural equation modelling 
techniques such as LISREL in that it tests the strength of individual component relationships 
rather  than  the  overall  fit  of  a  proposed  model  to  observed  covariances  amongst  all  of  the 
variables.  PLS  uses  a  series  of  interdependent  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regressions  to 
minimize  residual  variances,  placing  minimal  demands  on  data  in  terms  of  measurement 
scales,  sample  size,  and  distributional  assumptions  (Chin,  1998b;  Fornell  and  Bookstein, 
1982;  Wold,  1982).  PLS  is  also  a  conservative  modelling  approach  that  tends  to 
underestimate  rather  than  overestimate  path  coefficients  (Dijkstra,  1983),  reducing  the 
likelihood  of  Type  1  errors  in  hypothesis  testing  (Bagozzi  et  al.,  1991).  We  can  infer  the 
relative strength of relationships among variables by their path loadings. We can also judge 
the extent to which variation in one set of variables might help explain variance in a variable 
of  interest,  through  the  R2  calculated  by  the  program.  As  with  multiple  regression,  the 
predictive  powers  of  PLS  can  help  in  refining  theory  by  showing  which assumed  predictors 
have substantive links to outcomes.

Partial least squares (PLS) is preferable to covariance-based SEM in cases where the 
sample  size  is  relatively  small  (Bagozzi  et  al.,  1991;  Hulland,  1999).  Earlier  work  has 
demonstrated that PLS is capable of providing provide unbiased estimates with small sample 
sizes (Chin and Newsted, 1999; Falk and Miller, 1992). Of course, the larger the sample, the 
more stable the parameter estimates, yet there is no agreement as to the  minimum required

sample size. A standard rule of thumb for PLS suggests a sample size equivalent to the larger 
of the following: (a) ten times the number of indicators for the scale with the largest number 
of  formative  (causal)  indicators;  or  (b)  ten  times  the  largest  number  of  structural  paths 
directed at a particular construct in the structural model (Chin, 1998b). 

Due to these characteristics, PLS has been used in several other studies in operations 
and supply chain management (e.g. Camison and Lopez, 2010; Jeffers, 2010; Johnston et al., 
2004;  Morgan  et  al.,  2007;  Ordanini  and  Rubera,  2008;  Raymond  and  St-Pierre,  2005; 
Rosenzweig, 2009).

o

One  method  for  testing  non-response  bias  is  to  test  for  significant  differences  between  the 
responses  of  early  and  late  waves  of  returned  surveys  via  t-tests  (Armstrong  and  Overton, 
1977).  We  utilized  this  approach,  comparing  early  and  late  respondents  in  terms  of 
demographic variables (e.g. annual sales, full time equivalent (FTE)). The t-tests yielded no 
statistically  significant  differences  among  the  demographic  variables  as  can  be  seen  in  the 
table below. This is now mentioned in the manuscript.

6. When was data collected? 

The data was collected in 2002. We do recognize that the data set was collected 8 or 9 
years  ago.  However,  we  respectfully  submit  that  the  research  results  based  on  this 
data  set  will  still  be  of  value  to  academic  and  practitioner  communities.  We  would 
also  expect  these  results  to  be  conservative  as  the  need  for  supply  chain  agility  has 
increased over this time span.

8. Page 22 and Table 2, what do you mean by "firms in growth or maturity stages of

o

We apologize for the mistake and concur with the reviewer that it is the product’s life 
cycle that is the focus. We reworded “Product life cycle stage” as “The stage of the 
product in its life cycle” to clarify. 
r
 

We used Stanton’s definition of a product’s life cycle as “the stages a product 
goes through from its introduction, to its growth and maturity, to its eventual decline 
and  death  (withdrawal  from  the  market  or  deletion  from  the  company’s  offerings) 
(Stanton, 191, pg. 643). This position is also reflected in our specific survey question, 
which was:  What stage of the product life cycle is your main product currently in?

9. Page 24, what are the PLS fit indices? 

R

e

PLS is a components-based approach to structural modelling (Chin et al., 2003).  The 
structural  and  measurement  models  under  PLS  consist  of  three  sets  of  relations:  a) 
the  inner  (structural)  model  which  specifies  the  relationships  between  latent 
variables;  b)  the  outer  (measurement)  model  which  specifies  the  relationships 
between  the  latent  variables  and  their  associated  observed  variables;  and,  c)  the 
weight relations upon which the case values for the latent variables can be estimated 
(Chin,  1998a,  b).  In  PLS,  a  good  model  fit  is  established  with  significant  path 
coefficients, acceptably high R2 values and internal consistency (construct reliability) 
being  above  0.7  for  each  construct  (Gefen  et  al.,  2000).  Unlike  covariance-based 
structural equation modelling, PLS does not use fit indices.  

v
i
e

w

This standard way of applying PLS can be seen in numerous other studies in 
operations and supply chain management such as: Camison and Lopez (2010), Jeffers 
(2010), and Ordanini and Rubera (2008).

10. Page 24, The authors argued that the composite reliability and AVE shown in 
Table 3 met the reliability assessment criteria, despite that four out of 13 constructs 
has AVE lower than 0.5. All the three second-order constructs (strategic sourcing, 
strategic flexibility, and supply chain agility) fall in this group.  Shouldn't this be an 
indication that there is a problem with the constructs? 

r
 

P

e

We thank the referee for this insightful comment. We searched the literature to 

reexamine our understanding of this aspect.  

e

r
 

As expected, we found that factor loadings, composite reliability, and average 
variance  extracted  (AVE)  are  three  measures  widely  used  for  the  analysis  of 
measurement reliability (e.g., Sosik, et al. 2009, p.21, 3rd paragraph).   

R

For the first two measures, factor loadings of indicators for the corresponding 
latent  variable  exceeding  0.6,  and  composite  reliability  developed  by  Werts  et  al. 
(1974) of over 0.7 have been suggested to ensure measurement reliability (Sosik, et al. 
2009).  

e

v
i
e

In  our  study,  all  thirteen  factor  loadings,  except  the  one  for  product  design-
related  flexibility  are  above  the  0.6  threshold,  while  the  results  of  composite 
reliability are all satisfied with the 0.7 cutoff point.  

w

However, for the third measure, AVE, the AVEs for 4 out of the 13 constructs 
are indeed lower than the suggested 0.5 value. The AVE measure, created by Fornell 
and  Larcker  (1981)  assesses  predictiveness  for  the  evaluation  of  PLS  model  (Chin, 
1998, p.316). AVE attempts to measure the amount of variance that a latent variable 
component  captures  from  its  indicators  relative  to  the  amount  due  to  measurement 
error (p. 321, 1st paragraph).  Fornell and Larcker (1981) further suggested that AVE 
can also be interpreted as a measure of reliability for the latent variable component 
score (p.321, 3rd paragraph). 

From  our  literature  review,  we  have  verified  that  not  all  three  criteria  must 
satisfy  their  respective  criteria.  In  fact,  Chin  (1998,  p.325),  in  an  example  of  an 
empirical  application  of PLS  showed  that to  conduct  a  PLS  analysis,  the  researcher 
needs  to  first  ensure  the  individual  item  reliability,  which  implies  that  the 
standardized loadings should be greater than 0.707. Once the individual reliabilities

are  considered,  the  composite  reliability  is  considered  next  (p.326).  Chin  (1998) 
tested  the  measurement  reliability  merely  based  on  the  two  criteria  mentioned  and 
then,  (p.327)  moves  on  to  test  the  discriminant  validity  by  calculating  AVE  and 
comparing  AVE  to  the  square  of  the  correlations  among  constructs.  As  a  matter  of 
fact, our reliability test procedure is completely followed the methods of Chin (1998) 
to conclude the reliability of our measurement model.  

 
Moreover, we also notice that a  few prior studies (e.g., Cousins, 2005; Oltra 
and Flor, 2010;Urgal-Gonzalez and Garcia-Vazquez, 2007), using covariance-based 
SEM  techniques  like  LISREL,  reported  less  than  the  desired  reliability  test  results 
suggested in Nunnally (1978).  

Due to the above mentioned observations, we submit that the reliability of our 

 
studied constructs is sufficiently adequate for this study.

1. Originality:  Does the paper contain new and significant information adequate to 
justify publication?: The relationships among strategic sourcing, flexibility and supply 
chain agility have been explored quite extensively.  Indeed, the authors have

identified quite a few of these studies.  This paper concluded that strategic sourcing 
affects strategic flexibility and supply chain agility, and strategic flexibility affects 
supply chain agility.  These findings have been concluded in the literature.  Citing 
Frohlich and Dixon (2001) the authors argued that their study contributed to the 
literature by replicating past research results. In my opinion, the marginal contribution 
of this research is too insignificant to justify publication in IJOPM. 
 
We sincerely believe that this study makes useful and timely contributions. But we do 
acknowledge  that  they  were  not  laid  out  effectively  in  the  earlier  version.  In 
particular,  we  did  not  quite  convey  the  current  gaps  in  literature,  and  the  new 
contributions we have made. As stated under the response to the first comment above, 
we have: 

• This  study  is  based  on  a  theoretical  platform  that  considers  both  strategic 
sourcing  and  flexibility  as  internal  competences  which  may  lead  to  the  dynamic 
capability of agility. This is a new aspect. 

F

o

• In  addition  to  the  above  competence-capability  theoretical  framework,  we 
consider supply chain agility as a dynamic capability, drawing from the theory of 
dynamic  capabilities  (Teece  et  al.,  1997;  Teece  2007),  which  extends  both 
resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the competence-capability perspective.  
This is again new. 

r
 

P

e

• This study examines the antecedents of a firm’s agility in the supply chain context 
more  broadly  than  prior  studies:  the  limited  past  studies  on  agility  have 
investigated  the  relationship  between  sub-elements  of  strategic  sourcing  and 
agility; or sub-elements of firm-level flexibilities and agility. This study considers 
all three key factors (strategic sourcing, flexibility and agility) together.  

r
 

e

v
i
e

• We  have  also  relied  on  broader  definitions  for  all  three  constructs,  unlike  past 
studies which have been based on sub-elements of these constructs, and based on 
more comprehensive definitions of the constructs, and tested the relationships in a 
broader framework.  

e

R

• From  a  methodology  point  of  view,  this  study  applies  structural  equation 
modelling  to  test  the  relationship  among  the  three  constructs,  and  a  method  for 
testing mediation effects.  

• This  research  considers  the  influence  of  contextual  factors  such  as  firm  size, 
manufacturing  process,  and  the  product  characteristics,  in  order  to  examine  the 
relationships  in  various  business  settings  in  contrast  to  prior  studies  such  as 
Swafford  et  al.  (2006),  Khan  and  Pillania  (2008)  and  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh 
(2009). 

w

• This  study  also  introduces  discussion  on  the  interdependence  and  balance 
between purchasing and manufacturing activities and how they jointly contribute 
to agile supply chains.   

• Flexibility  and  agility  have  frequently  been  discussed  as  interchangeable  terms 
(e.g.  Aitken  et  al.,  2002),  yet  a  separation  between  these  concepts  has  been 
conceptualized  and  empirically  validated  only  quite  recently  (Swafford  et  al., 
2006). 

• Likewise,  in  various  other  parts  of  the  paper,  we  have  now  attempted  to  clearly 

bring out the new aspects investigated in this paper.

3. Methodology:  Is the paper's argument built on an appropriate base of theory, 
concepts or other ideas?  Has the research or equivalent intellectual work on which 
the paper is based been well designed?  Are the methods employed appropriate?:  
 

a.  The paper's argument was not built on theory (such as the transaction cost 

economics or resource-based).   

Actually,  we  did  base  our  study  on  the  theoretical  aspects  of  competence-
capability framework. In addition, we also based it on the dynamic capability 
theory  proposed  by  Teece  et  al.  (1997).  It  is  just  that  we  did  not  clearly 
highlight this in our earlier version of the manuscript. 

F

o

r
 

The  dynamic  capability  perspective  is  derived  from  and  is  an 
outgrowth  of  the  resourced  based  view  (RBV)  and  presents  the  sources  of 
firm-level  competitive  advantage  over  time  in  dynamic  situations.  We  have 
described  the  above  theoretical  aspects  right  at  the  beginning  of  Section  3: 
Model  Development.  In  that  section,  we  explained  the  dynamic  capabilities 
perspective (DCP) as the ability of a firm to achieve new forms of competitive 
advantage  by  renewing  competences  to  achieve  congruence  with  changing 
business environments (Teece et al. 1997; Teece 2007). Our model is build on 
the  dynamic  capability  theory  as  we  explain  how  companies  use  strategic 
sourcing and strategic flexibility to build supply chain agility, which can help 
them: (a) sense and shape opportunities and threats, (b) seize chances, and (c) 
maintain  competitiveness  through  enhancing,  combining,  protecting,  and 
reconfiguring  the  organization’s  intangible  and  tangible  assets.  Dynamic 
capabilities  theory  is  now  increasingly  applied  in  operations  management 
research.  Some  examples  of  this  emerging  literature  include  (Holcomb  and 
Hitt, 2007; Smart et al., 2007; Witcher et al., 2008).

b.  I have some serious concerns regarding the survey instrument, data collection, 

and statistical analysis used in this paper.  I could not understand why the 
survey instrument was designed and tested in the U.S. and Netherland when 
the population frame of the student was in the U.S.  What is the purpose of 
testing it in Netherland? 

It  so  happened  that  two  of  the  authors  involved  in  this  research  were 
interacting  actively  with  supply  chain  academics  &  purchasing  professionals 
in the Netherlands. The early part of the survey development took place while 
the two of us were in the Netherlands (one of us was a Visiting professor in a

Dutch  university).  Subsequently,  after  returning  to  US,  the  survey  was 
administered to professionals in the US. No other special reasons  existed for 
the choice of the two  countries, and we respectfully submit that this does not 
affect  the  research  results  in  any  way.  On  the  contrary,  we  have  benefitted 
much from the academics and practitioners with whom we had an opportunity 
to  interact  outside  of  the  US.  One  of  the  experts  we  interacted  with  during 
survey development was also the author of a widely-used text book in Europe 
and one who provided us access to many practitioners relevant to this study.  
 

c.  There are several fatal flaws in the survey instrument and data used to test the 
hypotheses. First of all, the survey instrument measured perception, not actual 
implementation of the measured items.  What was done to ensure that 
respondents’ perceptions are accurate representation of actual practices? Was 
data collected from a second respondent in the same firm to cross validate the 
responses?   

F

o

r
 

We  did  not  collect  data  from  a  second  respondent  in  the  same  firm  to  cross 
validate the responses. As in studies such as Frohlich and Westbrook (2002), 
it was felt that these were managers with enough seniority to know about their 
companies’  upstream  and  downstream  integration  and  performance.  High-
ranking respondents, with sufficient level of seniority tend to be more reliable 
sources  of  information  than  their  subordinate  rank,  in  accordance  with 
Phillips  (1981).  This  is  also  consistent  with  numerous  past  survey-based 
research  studies  in  supply  chain  management  (e.g.,  Swafford  et  al.,  2006a,b; 
Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009; Camison and Lopez, 2010). As a result, the 
single source employed in the study was deemed to be able to provide reliable 
and valid responses regarding the supply chain as a whole.

d.  To make matter worse, the sampling frame targeted ISM’s purchasing and 
supply managers when a large portion of the questions were operations and 
logistics oriented.   I am doubtful that purchasing and supply managers are 
knowledgeable about the firms’ strategic flexibility (supply flexibility, product 
design, and process flexibility) and agility (customer responsiveness, demand 
response, and joints planning). For example, some of the operations oriented

survey questions asked the respondents how long it takes to introduce new 
products, to accommodate design change, and to change product mix (these 
are items measuring the first-order product design flexibility construct).  There 
are similar concerns with all the other first-order constructs measuring supply 
chain flexibility and supply chain agility. 

In  addition  to  the  points  mentioned  above,  for  the  previous  comment,  we 
would  like  to  add  the  following.  High-level  Purchasing  and  supply  chain 
executives have been shown to be more conversant with external aspects and 
demands  on  manufacturing  situations  than  manufacturing  managers,  and 
manufacturing  executives  are  generally  aware  of  fewer  sourcing  issues 
(Narasimhan  and  Das,  1999).  Similarly,  in  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh  (2009) 
it  was  also  pointed  out  that  these  executives  with  sufficient  seniority  tend  to 
know  about  the  firms’  upstream  and  downstream  integration  aspects  and 
performance. The respondents employed in our study are also consistent with 
most  past  survey-based  research  works  in  the  supply  chain  management. 
Finally,  the  survey  instrument  was  not  overly  technical  and  did  not  require 
detailed  knowledge  of  manufacturing  process/equipment,  just  as  in  studies 
such  as  Narasimhan  and  Das  (1999).  This  is  certainly  a  point  for  future 
refinements  for  research  in  this  area.  Hence,  we  submit  that  the  responses 
from the purchasing executives and supply managers are valid and reliable.

e.  Another major concern of this study is how the research model was

e

operationalized.  The authors used 3 indicators to measure each first-order 
construct (Appendix).  For example, are (1) top management emphasizes 
purchasing function's strategic role, (2) purchasing is viewed as equal to other 
functions by the CEO, and (3) purchasing is involved in corporate-level 
strategic planning (Appendix) adequate measure of the strategic purchasing 
construct? In order to properly measure strategic purchasing of a firm, I would 
expect to enquire whether there is a strategic alliance relationship between the 
buyer and supplier, supplier certification program, and supplier performance 
evaluation system, among others.  Similar problem exists for all the other first-
order constructs.   

w

The scales for the research constructs and survey instrument employed in this 
study are mostly derived from existing studies.  For example, the construct of 
strategic  sourcing  and  the  questions  asked  in  the  questionnaire  are  adopted 
from  Kocabasoglu  and  Suresh  (2006).  We  do  agree  with  the  reviewer  that 
there may be other indicators which can be considered to present the concept 
of  the  corresponding  construct.  We  submit  that  this  might  be  true  for  most 
other  empirical  studies  in  the  past  in  this  research  stream.  We  will  keep  this 
factor in mind in our future research efforts.

f.  Using 3 indicators per construct also preclude the authors' ability to use the 

two-step modeling approach to assess the fit of the structural model 
independently of the measurement models because the degrees of freedom for 
each measurement model will be negative (see references below).

In PLS modeling, a universal fit measure, like model χ2 for covariance-based 
SEM using maximum likelihood estimation and other similar fit indices is not 
utilized (Chin, 1998; Tenenhaus et al., 2005) though one global goodness-of-
fit  criterion  which  mainly  serves  a  diagnostic  purpose,  has  been  proposed 
(Wetzels  et  al.,  2009).  As  mentioned  above  for  comment  #9,  using  PLS,  the 
evaluation  of  the  fit  of  a  structural  model  depends  merely  on  the  analysis  of 
the  predictability  of  the  endogenous  constructs  and  the  strength  of  the 
relationships  between  the  constructs  (Camison  and  Lopez,  2010).  The 
predictability  of  the  endogenous  constructs  is  evaluated  by  means  of  the  R2 
value for the endogenous variables. The strength of the relationships between 
the  constructs  is  assessed  through  the  path  coefficients  (β)  and  the 
corresponding significant level.

Unlike  traditional  SEM  approach  used  in  Lisrel,  the  degrees  of 
freedom  for  measure  model  is  measured  as  “the  number  of  bootstrapping 
size  –  1”  (Henseler  et  al.,  2009)  which  is  999  in  this  study  since  the 
boostrapping size considered in this study is 1000 subsamples, which is larger 
than the suggested 500 subsample size suggested by Chin (2001) and used by 
Camison and Lopez (2010).

a.  Results are well-presented, but I am doubtful of using PLS to analyze the 

research model.  I believe the model would not converge if the authors used 
Lisrel, MPlus or EQS due to the small sample size. 

As  explained  in  one  of  our  responses,  we  have  chosen  PLS  over  covariance-
based  SEM  because  it  has  been  suggested  as  a  methodology  appropriate  for 
smaller  samples  sizes  (Bagozzi  et  al.,  1991;  Hulland,  1999)  and  the  fact  that 
research  has  shown  it  to  be  capable  of  providing  unbiased  estimates  with 
small  sample  sizes  (Chin  and  Newsted,  1999;  Falk  and  Miller,  1992).  Our 
sample size does satisfy the rule of thumb for required sample sizes in PLS.

5. Implications for research, practice and/or society:  Does the paper identify clearly 
any implications for research, practice and/or society?  Does the paper bridge the 
gap between theory and practice? How can the research be used in practice 
(economic and commercial impact), in teaching, to influence public policy, in 
research (contributing to the body of knowledge)?  What is the impact upon society 
(influencing public attitudes, affecting quality of life)?  Are these implications 
consistent with the findings and conclusions of the paper?: I am doubtful of the 
research methodology and survey instrument; hence, I am reluctant to recommend 
whether the implications are consistent with the findings and conclusions of the 
paper.

Responses to Reviewer: 2 
 
Responses to Questions under “Comments”: 

1.      Define "agility" in the introduction - how is it different from flexibility? You'll 
also therefore need to explain your definition of "flexibility" 

We  thank  the  reviewer  for  this  suggestion,  since  the  distinction  between  these  two 
concepts is critical for this study. As a result, we added a section in the Introduction 
(at the bottom of the first page of Introduction) where flexibility is defined early as the 
ability “to change or react with little penalty in time, cost, or performance” (Upton, 
1994)  whereas  agility  is  defined  as  the  capability  of  the  ﬁrm,  internally,  and  in 
conjunction  with  its  key  suppliers  and  customers,  to  adapt  or  respond  in  a  speedy 
manner to a changing marketplace contributing to agility of the extended supply chain 
(Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009).

2.      Explicitly explain the difference between competence and capability

In  line  with  the  reviewer’s  request,  we  used  the  explanations  given  by  Teece  et  al. 
(1997) in their seminal article, where they discuss competencies vs. capabilities. They 
explain  competence  as:  “When  firm-specific  assets  are  assembled  in  integrated 
clusters  spanning  individuals  and  groups  so  that  they  enable  distinctive  activities  to 
be  performed,  these  activities  constitute  organizational  routines  and  processes”. 
Thus,  competence  is  “what  an  organization  can  do  particularly  well”  (Andrews, 
1987). But while this competence is unique, it provides that company profit potential 
only when it is linked to the needs of the market. Thus, Teece et al. (1997) suggested 
that  capabilities  are  about  “appropriately  adapting,  integrating,  and  reconfiguring 
internal and external organizational skills, resources, and functional competences to 
match the requirements of a changing environment.” In other words, capabilities are 
about matching the organization’s abilities with the market’s needs.

3.      The arguments for H1 and H2 are very similar; there needs to be a clearer 
distinction; 

We  thank  the  reviewer  for  this  comment.  We  have  strengthened  arguments  for 
hypotheses 1 and 2 (and also the other two hypotheses) and clarified their differences 
by taking the following steps: 

In line with one of the reviewer’s earlier comments,

a)  We  provide  definitions  for  all  three  constructs,  this  provides  a  clear 
delineation  of  the  flexibility  and  agility  constructs  also  helping  establish  a 
clear difference on how strategic sourcing relates to flexibility vs. agility 

b)  We  explain  the  difference  between  competence  and  capability  thereby  again 

separating the flexibility and agility constructs. 

c)  We  rearrange  the  hypotheses  section  to  bring  out  the  differences  in  the 
hypotheses  section  and  bringing  out  that  strategic  sourcing  relates  to  agility 
by  ensuring  that its  operations  is  aligned  to  the needs  of  the  market  whereas 
its  role  in  improving  flexibility  is  primarily  due  to  the  fact  that  suppliers 
provide  key  input  to  a  firm’s  operations  and  poor  supply  management  can 
seriously disrupt operations, etc. 

 

4.      For both H1 and H2, there should be more explanation of why the relationships 
are hypothesized in addition to providing references that support these 
relationships.  There is some explanation but not enough. 

F

o

We  have  rewritten  the  sections  related  to  Hypothesis  1  and  2,  and  provided  more 
explanations in response to this comment of the referee. . 
 
5.      Again, there is not a very clear distinction between agility and flexibility, so it is 
difficult to see the significance of the argument for H3.  

r
 

P

e

e

As stated before, the definitions of flexibility and agility are now in the Introduction, 
especially  relating  them  in  a  competence-capability  framework  helped  us  strengthen 
our  argument  for  H3.  It  should  be  stated  that  this  is  why  we  consider  this  study  be 
timely,  only  recently  have  these  concepts  been  clearly  separated,  and  the  constructs 
defined, measured and empirically validated. 
 
6.      The argument for H4 is not well developed.  Again, the authors need to explain 
why there should be a mediation effect. What would it mean for FSF to mediate the 
relationship between strategic sourcing and agility, and why would you expect there 
to be such an effect? 

r
 

e

R

To  respond  to  this  request,  we  considered  the  role  of  purchasing  in  physical 
distribution versus market mediation as defined by Fisher (1997), and introduced the 
following in the development of H4: 
 

w

Fisher (1997) argued that a supply chain has both a physical distribution and 
market mediation function. While the physical distribution function focuses on getting 
the  products  to  the  market  efficiently,  the  market  mediation  function  is  primarily 
related to scanning the market to make sure that a firm (or a set of firms in the supply 
chain)  seizes  opportunities  in  the  market  by  synchronizing  the  demand  with  their 
supply.  This  raises  the  following  question  about  the  exact  nature  of  the  relationship 
between  strategic  sourcing  and  FSCA.  If  one  considers  only  the  physical  function, 
strategic sourcing can be primarily seen as comprehending procurement needs of an 
organization  and  ensuring  the  arrival  of  supplies  consistent  with  these  needs.  If  one 
focuses  on  the  market  mediation  aspect,  the  question  becomes  whether  there  is 
additional information that purchasing can collect, given its boundary spanning role 
and  its  relationships  with  other  firms  regarding  the  market,  which  may  help  a  firm 
synchronize  the  supply  with  end-customer  demands  better.  If  the  former  scenario 
applies, one may expect flexibility to fully mediate the relationship between strategic 
sourcing and agility since the positive or negative contributions of strategic sourcing

will be fully absorbed by the internal operations. If on the other hand, if purchasing 
has a role in market mediation, one would not expect to see full mediation.

7.      One control variable that seems to be missing is industry.  The authors 
apparently have SIC codes for their respondents, so it would not seem to be difficult 
to control for industry.  Different industries have very different characteristics, and 
those characteristics would likely affect agility and flexibility.  

In  response  to  this  suggestion,  we  reanalyzed  the  relationships  among  the  proposed 
research constructs, adding industry as a control variable. The path coefficients and 
corresponding significance level among constructs are provided below.

The results shown above are pretty similar to the results presented in Table 6 (P.27 in 
original submission). The path coefficients between each control variable and FSCA 
are all insignificant and close to zero.  
 
8.      It seems that there should have been some direct measure of demand uncertainty 
instead of two variables that might be related to demand uncertainty.  
 
We  could  have  considered  one  of  the  two  following  options  with  regards  to  demand 
uncertainty: 

1.)  Taken  a  measure  of  demand  uncertainty  from  economics,  such  as  a  variable 
driven  by  changes  in  sales.  We  preferred  not  to,  since  this  variable  assumes 
that there was enough capacity to absorb the variability. 

2.)  Taken  a  well  established  construct  such  as  dynamism  or  munificence.  While 
this  was  seriously  considered,  we  had  to  abandon  the  idea  given  that  the 
survey was already quite long.  

F

 
We do believe that perishability and seasonality are to alternative measures, given the 
large body work on fast fashion (e.g. Fisher and Raman, 1996), where the product is 
both perishable and seasonal.

9.      A response rate of 7.3% is low, even if the authors have been able to find other 
published studies with comparably low response rates.  Also, the authors did not 
appear to have tested for non-response bias, which is important with such a low 
response rate.

One method for testing non-response bias is to test for significant differences between 
the responses of early and late waves of returned surveys via t-tests (Armstrong and 
Overton,  1977).  We  utilized  this  approach  comparing  early  and  late  respondents  in 
terms of demographic variables (e.g. annual sales, full time equivalent (FTE)). The t-
tests yielded no statistically significant differences among the demographic variables 
as can be seen in the table below.

10.     Another potential issue is the possibility of common method bias as a result of 
using a single respondent.  One possible check for this problem is Harman's one-
factor test.  

Yes,  indeed…  the  test  for  common  method  bias  is  needed  for  survey-based  research 
work. Liang et al. (2007) (Appendix E, page 85 – 87), based on Podsakoff et al. (2003) 
and Williams et al. (2003), suggested a method to test the common method bias under 
the PLS program as quoted below: 

“According  to  Williams  et  al.  (2003),  evidence  of  common  method  bias  can  be 
obtained by examining the statistical significance of factor loadings of the method 
factor  and  comparing  the  variances  of  each  observed  indicator  explained  by  its 
substantive  construct  and  the  method  factor.  The  squared  values  of  the  method 
factor  loadings  were  interpreted  as  the  percent  of  indicator  variance  caused  by 
method,  whereas  the  squared  loadings  of  substantive  constructs  were  interpreted 
as the percent of indicator variance caused by substantive constructs. If the method 
factor  loadings  are  insignificant  and  the  indicators’  substantive  variances  are 
substantially  greater  than  their  method  variances,  we  can  conclude  that  common 
method bias is unlikely to be a serious concern. “

results  show  that  average  variance  of  the  substantive  factor  loading  (0.627)  is  62 
times  more  than  that  of  the  method  factor  loading  (0.011).  Moreover,  most  method 
factor loadings are insignificant. Hence, we consider that the common method bias is 
less likely to be a concern.

11.     Why did the authors use PLS instead of structural equation modeling?  

e

The  primary  reason  for  using  the  partial  least  squares  (PLS)  rather  than  the 
covariance-based  of  technique  structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  was  the  small 
sample  size.  This  issue  and  some  other  aspects  of  PLS  that  made  it  the  preferred 
methodology is expanded upon in the subsequent paragraphs.

Similar  to  covariance-based  SEM,  the  structural  and  measurement  models 
under  PLS  (Wold,  1966;  Lohmohller,  1989;  Chin,  1998a,  b;  2001)  consist  of  three 
sets  of  relations:  The  inner  (structural)  model,  which  specifies  the  relationships 
between  latent  variables,  (b)  The  outer  (measurement)  model,  which  specifies  the 
relationships  between  the  latent  variables  and  their  associated  observed  variables, 
and (c) The weight relations upon which the case values for the latent variables can 
be estimated.

The PLS method is designed to maximize prediction rather than fit (Anderson 
and  Gerbing,  1988).  That  is,  PLS  differs  in  its  approach  from  other  structural 
equation  modeling  techniques  such  as  LISREL  in  that  it  tests  the  strength  of 
individual component relationships rather than the overall fit of a proposed model to 
observed  covariances  amongst  all  of  the  variables.  PLS  uses  a  series  of 
interdependent  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regressions  to  minimize  residual 
variances, placing minimal demands on data in terms of measurement scales, sample 
size,  and  distributional  assumptions  (Chin,  1998b;  Fornell  and  Bookstein,  1982; 
Wold,  1982).  PLS  is  also  a  conservative  modeling  approach  that  tends  to 
underestimate  rather  than  overestimate  path  coefficients  (Dijkstra,  1983),  reducing 
the  likelihood  of  Type  1  errors  in  hypothesis  testing  (Bagozzi  et  al.,  1991).  We  can 
infer the relative strength of relationships among variables by their path loadings. We 
can also judge the extent to which variation in one set of variables might help explain 
variance in a variable of interest, through the R2 calculated by the program. As with

multiple  regression,  the  predictive  powers  of  PLS  can  help  in  refining  theory  by 
showing which assumed predictors have substantive links to outcomes.  

Partial  least  squares  (PLS)  is  preferable  to  covariance-based  SEM  in  cases 
where  the  sample  size  is  relatively  small  (Bagozzi  et  al.,  1991;  Hulland,  1999). 
Earlier  work  has  demonstrated  that  PLS  capable  of  providing  provide  unbiased 
estimates with small sample sizes (Chin and Newsted, 1999; Falk and Miller, 1992). 
Of course, the larger the sample, the more stable the parameter estimates, yet there is 
no agreement as to the minimum required sample size. A standard rule of thumb for 
PLS suggests a sample size equivalent to the larger of the following: (a) ten times the 
number  of  indicators  for  the  scale  with  the  largest  number  of  formative  (causal) 
indicators;  or  (b)  ten  times  the  largest  number  of  structural  paths  directed  at  a 
particular construct in the structural model (Chin, 1998b). 

Due  to  these  characteristics  PLS  has  been  used  in  several  other  studies  in 
operations  and  supply  chain  management  (e.g.  Camison  and  Lopez,  2010;  Jeffers, 
2010;  Johnston  et  al.,  2004;  Morgan  et  al.,  2007;  Ordanini  and  Rubera,  2008; 
Raymond and St-Pierre, 2005; Rosenzweig, 2009)

12.     The test for mediation can include a partial mediation, where there can still be a 
significant relationship between the predictor variable (SS) and the outcome variable 
(FSCA) when the hypothesized mediator variable (FSF) is included in the 
model.  Partial mediation is indicated when the magnitude of the effect from the 
predictor to the outcome variable is reduced.  That appears to be the situation 
here.  The magnitude of the standardized coefficient for SS, while significant in both 
models, decreases from 0.428 to 0.347.  The literature is not clear on the extent to 
which the magnitude must be decreased to allow a conclusion of partial mediation, 
but the authors should investigate this possibility.  I would suggest that the authors 
consult the literature on mediation and partial mediation to guide them on this issue.

In addition to the full mediation effect described in Baron and Kenny (1986), Sosik et 
al. (2009) suggested the existence of partial mediation effect under PLS. One formal 
approach to test the existence of mediation effect is to examine whether the product of 
the two mediating paths is significantly different from zero (MacKinnon et al., 2002). 
Sobel  test  (Sobel  1982)  is  the  most  common  tool  used  for  such  a  test.  However,  this 
test  is  not  able  to  be  applied  in  this  study  because  the  path  coefficients  are  not 
independent  since  PLS  is  used.  Moreover,  under  PLS,  there  are  no  unstandardized 
path coefficients as required to run Sobel test. 

Sosik  et  al.  (2009)  considered  that  partial  mediation  exists  when  the  path 
coefficients  between  the  predictor  variable,  strategic  sourcing,  and  the  intervening 
variable, FSF, and between the intervening variable and outcome variable, FSCA, are 
significant.  In  other  words,  if  the  direct  path  and  the  two  mediating  paths  were 
significant,  a  partial  mediation  effect  should  be  concluded.  In  this  study,  the  path

coefficients are both significant (0.346 and 0.344) and the partial mediation effect is 
concluded.
