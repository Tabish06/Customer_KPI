Rapid industrial modernisation and economic reform have been features of the Korean economy since the
1990s, and have brought with it substantial environmental problems. In response to these problems, the
Korean government has been developing approaches to promote cleaner production technologies. Green
supply chain management (GSCM) is emerging to be an important approach for Korean enterprises to
improve performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of GSCM CSFs (critical success
factors) on the BSC (balanced scorecard) performance by the structural equation modelling, using empirical
results from 249 enterprise respondents involved in national GSCM business in Korea. Planning and
implementation was a dominant antecedent factor in this study, followed by collaboration with partners
and integration of infrastructure. However, activation of support was a negative impact to the finance
performance, raising the costs and burdens. It was found out that there were important implications in the
implementation of GSCM.

Keywords: critical success factors; green supply chain management; structural equation modelling; balanced
scorecard performance

1. Introduction

In accordance with the Korean President Lee’s Declaration of the Low Carbon and Green Growth Policy as a key
national administrative indication on the 15 August 2008, almost all Korean R&D policies have focused on low
carbon and green growth. Many countries have taken a growing interest in Korea’s green growth policies which are
related to climate change, cleaner production technologies and international environmental regulations. In this
paper, we want to introduce the impact of critical success factors of Korean enterprises which are driving the green
supply chain management (GSCM) strategically.

Logistics is an important part of the supply chain process that plans, implements and controls efficient and
effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of
origin and the point of consumption in order to meet customers’ requirements. Industrial logistics is even more
specialised and touches a wide range of topics related to production/warehousing site supervision, demand planning,
production control, environmental management issues and so forth. This paper belongs to a part of environmental
issues in logistics management, which is classified as a special issue of industrial logistics systems.

Social concern about the environmental issues in Korea began to emerge in the early 1990s. Economic growth
had been a high priority until that time. This high priority enabled the Korean economy to grow more than 500-fold
over three decades. However, significant environmental accidents and controversial events such as the phenol
leakage in 1991 have driven Korean society to turn its attention to the environment. Moreover, external pressures
resulting from regulations in the European Union, such as the RoHS, WEEE and REACH, have led both Korean
government and enterprises to consider the environmental impact brought by the entire supply chain. Currently,
Korean enterprises are striving to develop systematic and integrated approaches to environmental management such
as industrial ecology and green supply chain management (GSCM) in order to move towards a closed-loop or
cyclical industrial systems (Lee 2008).

For this reason, the Korean government established a new policy on expanding environmental management
throughout the entire supply chain. A national GSC initiative was started in 2003 based on this policy. This
programme was originally planned and supported by the Korean government to encourage small and medium size
enterprises (SME) suppliers to improve their environmental performance utilising relationships between the key-
players of large-sized buying firms and their suppliers. It is called the ‘Green Supply Chain Management Business’
programme because supply chain management is adopted as a core tool to disseminate and transfer environmental
management know-how of the large buying firms to the SME suppliers (see Figure 1). All the supports are provided
through co-operation of key buying enterprises with external expertise groups. This project has been implemented
with funds from the national budget and matching the responses from the participating enterprises.

In this paper an empirical study to determine the balanced scorecard performance of these GSCM critical
success factors was presented investigating the enterprises which participated in the GSCM project supported by the
government. However, no empirical studies for the balanced scorecard performance of these GSCM critical success
factors have been conducted so far. Some enterprises have recognised its importance and tried to put it into practice,
but most of these enterprises usually lacked experience as well as the necessary tools and management skills. This
study will help these organisations determine whether they need to adopt these measures in terms of BSC
performance.

To complete this investigation, this paper has introduced some background of general Korean GSCM business
characteristics in Section 1. In Section 2 the research framework and established hypotheses are presented. Section 3
describes the data collection methods and measures for this study. The methodology and results are presented in
Sections 4 and 5. In Section 6 discussion and conclusions summarise the issues and potentials for future research.

2. Research framework and hypotheses

2.1 Literature review

2.1.1 The concept of green supply chain management

Supply chain management is the co-ordination and management of a complex network of activities involved in
delivering a finished product to the end-user or customer. A company’s supply chain structure consists of external
suppliers, internal functions of the company, and external distributors, as well as customers. Firms may be members
of multiple supply chains simultaneously. The successful management of a supply chain is also influenced by
customer expectations, globalisation,
information technology, government regulation, competition and the
environment.

Several studies have considered the concept of ecological sustainability as a framework for studying management
practices in both operational and strategic contexts (King and Lenox 2001). As part of this effort, studies have
examined the greening of supply chains within various contexts including product design, process design,
manufacturing practices, purchasing (Handfield and Bechtel 2002) and a broad mixture of these elements
(Bowen et al. 2001).

The definition of GSCM can be easily found in supply chain management. The ‘green’ component added to the
supply chain management addresses the influence and relationships of supply chain management to the natural
environment. Motivated by an environmentally-conscious mindset, it can also stem from a competitiveness motive
within organisations.
In this paper GSCM is defined as green purchasingþ green manufacturing/materials management þ green
distribution/marketing þ reverse logistics. Figure 2 shows this GSCM equation graphically, where reverse logistics
‘closes the loop’ of a typical forward supply chain and includes reuse, remanufacturing, and/or recycling of materials
into new materials or other products with value in the marketplace. This idea is designed to eliminate or minimise
waste which involves energy, emissions, chemical/hazardous, solid wastes (Hervani et al. 2005).

2.1.2 Critical success factors of GSCM

Based on the precedent studies on the streams of green supply chain management and business environmental
management, the authors can articulate influencing factors for business characteristics as follows.

Lippman (1999) suggested that enterprises have developed a broad range of GSCM initiatives. The scope, scale
and type of these initiatives vary significantly. However, described below are some of the GSCM strategies used
by enterprises that have achieved notable environmental and economic gains by working with their supply chain
partners:

(1) Written policies and communication materials.
(2) Questionnaires and audits.
(3) Supplier meetings.
(4) Training and technical assistance.
(5) Collaborative research and development.
(6) Restructuring relationships with suppliers and customers.

Based on its benchmarking research and work with enterprises on GSCM initiatives, the Business for Social
Responsibility Education Fund (BSREF) has identified several common characteristics of successful GSCM
programmes. These four key elements are described as follows:

(1) Top level leadership.
(2) Cross functional integration.
(3) Effective communication within enterprises and with suppliers.
(4) Effective processes for targeting, evaluating, selecting and working with suppliers.

The National Environmental Education and Training Foundation (NEETF) described that GSCM CSFs can
be classified into two types. One is a countermeasure against trade barriers and related matters, and the other is
economic inducement. Tomato sauces were the success factors through the governmental direct supporting case.

Park (2004) suggested that the SCM CSFs are composed of:

(1) Collaboration of supply chain partners.
(2) Mutual trust.
(3) Business understanding.
(4) SCM planning and implementation.
(5) Standardisation and integration.
(6) Activation supporting of SCM.
(7) Use of the strategic information technology.

Chen et al. (2009) pointed out the supply chain process needs to be integrated through the theoretical
(2009) analysed supply chain collaborations and verified their effect on

framework and Zacharia et al.
performance outcomes.

Ngai et al. (2004) suggested the critical success factors of web-based supply-chain management systems through
the exploratory study. Arun et al. (2006) emphasised the impacts of performance generated by the firms that have
digitally enabled supply chain integration capabilities. Cullen and Taylor (2009) suggested the critical success factors
for B2B e-commerce use within the UK NHS pharmaceutical supply chain. Klein and Rai (2009) emphasised the
inter-firm strategic information flows in logistics supply chain relationships.

Hsu et al. (2009) emphasised the supply chain management practices as a mediator of the relationship between
operational capability and firm performance. Azar et al. (2010) proposed the relationship between supply chain
quality management practices and their effects on organisational performance and Pettit and Beresford (2009)
suggested the critical success factors in the context of humanitarian aid supply chains.

Table 1 shows the summarised SCM CSFs with researchers in the last 10 years.

2.1.3 Performance measurement of GSCM

The existing performance measurement tool set for environmental operations is growing, but may not yet be
adequate to fully assess GSCM. Tools, from the literature and practice, include such items as the analytical
hierarchy process, activity-based costing, design for environment analysis, balanced scorecard, and life cycle analysis
type tools. Some tools have seen, or could be, directly applied to aspects of GSCM and performance, and others
require adjustments and extensions. The ‘balanced scorecard’ is another popular tool within the literature of
corporate performance management.

It is a management/measurement system purporting to help organisations develop corporate visions, strategy
and cascading them into action. It provides feedback on internal business processes and external outcomes in order
to continuously improve strategic performance and results (Kaplan and Norton 1992). The balanced scorecard
suggests organisational performance can be viewed from four perspectives and develop metrics, collect data and
analyse the organisation relative to each of these perspectives:

(1) The customer perspective.
(2) The business process perspective.
(3) The learning and growth perspective.
(4) The financial perspective.

Extensions to the balanced scorecard to incorporate environmental performance measures have also been
significantly advanced (Epstein and Wisner 2001, Zingales et al. 2002). The US Environmental Protection Agency

identified the balanced scorecard approach as their chosen methodology for deploying strategic direction,
communicating expectations, and measuring progress towards agreed-to objectives (Kanji 2003). Brewer and Speh
(2001) extended the balanced scorecard approach and linked it to general (rather than green) supply chain
management. Thus,
this approach may prove promising if effectively implemented and agreed upon by
organisations and could fit within a GSCM performance measurement system design as related to ISO 14031
requirements.

2.2 Research model and hypotheses

In Korea many enterprises have implemented supply chain management for a long time. However, there are only a
few enterprises implementing the early stage of green supply chain management until comparatively lately.
Therefore, how the CSFs in the general SCM impact on the GSCM emphasising environmental aspects will be
intensively explored and discussed in Section 3 of this study. In the methodology of this study, the impact of GSCM
critical success factors about balanced scorecard performance was analysed through the structural equation
modelling (SEM) as stated below.

We suggest a research model as seen in Figure 3, in which the independent variables of interest are ‘the extent

of GSCM CSFs’ and the dependent variables are ‘the impact of BSC Performance’.

The seven elements of GSCM CSF constructs were condensed into five independent variables, and the four BSC
performance constructs were condensed into two dependent variables in order to fit the structural equation
modelling conducted by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) from Figure 4 in Section 3.

Furthermore, Kim (2001) reported that customer, process and learning and growth performance classified as
‘non-finance performance’ directly affects finance performance. Hence, the non-finance performance affects the
finance performance directly in this study.

We suggest three hypotheses in this paper, as follows. Zhu and Sarkis (2004) suggested that he defined benefits
gained through GSCM as positive improvements, including decrease of cost for materials purchasing, decrease of
cost for energy consumption, decrease of fees for waste treatment and waste discharge, and decrease of fines for
environmental accidents. This leads to our first and second hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1 (H1): The more the extent of GSCM CSFs is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.

H1a: The more the extent of Integration of infrastructure for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.
H1b: : The more the extent of Collaboration with partners for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.
H1c: The more the extent of Planning and implementation for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.
H1d: The more the extent of Mutual trust for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.
H1e: The more the extent of Activation of supporting for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Nonfinance performance will be.

Hypothesis 2 (H2): The more the extent of GSCM CSFs except Activation of supporting and Nonfinance
performance for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.

Figure 4. Overall research model.

H2a: The more the extent of Integration of infrastructure for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.
H2b: The more the extent of Collaboration with partners for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.
H2c: The more the extent of Planning & implementation for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.
H2d: The more the extent of Mutual trust for GSCM is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.
H2e: The more the extent of Nonfinance performance is, the higher the impact of Finance performance will be.

Also, Zhu (2004) defined related negative performance, as increase of investment, operational cost, training cost

and costs for purchasing environmentally friendly materials. This leads to our third hypothesis.

Hypothesis 3 (H3): The more the extent of Activation of supporting for GSCM is, the lower the impact of Finance
performance will be.

3. Operationalisation and the measures

3.1 Operationalisation items and measure scale

In this study, as you can see in Figure 4, the independent variables were operationalised with seven factors including
collaboration with partners, mutual trust, GSCM understanding, planning and implementation, standardisation
and integration, activation of supporting and strategic use of the information system. These factors were composed
of four or five measurable items with seven point scales respectively. The dependent variables were operationalised
with four factors including: customer, process, learning and growth and finance performance. They were also
composed of four measurable items with seven point scales respectively (see Table 2). Then, an exploratory factor
analysis was conducted in order to reduce the factors and to fit the SEM systematically.

Thirty-one measurable items were selected as the independent variables and the exploratory factor analysis was
conducted for these variables, resulting in five factors. Also, 16 items were selected as the dependent variables, and
the exploratory factor analysis was conducted, resulting in two factors, of which one was non-finance performance,
that was an integrated performance of customer, process, learning and growth, the other was finance performance
in itself as described in Figure 3.

3.2 Adopting the measures with SEM methodology

In this study, we used SPSS and SEM (structural equation modelling) methodology for main effect analysis. SEM is
a statistical technique that combines measurement models (confirmatory factor analysis) and structural models
(regression analysis) into a simultaneous statistical test (Byrne 2001).

SEM is a member of what is known as the general linear model. More standard statistical techniques such as
regression analysis, simultaneous equations, factor analysis, or ANOVA can be contemplated as special cases of
SEM. One must notice, nevertheless, that some flexible extensions of the basic SEM exist that allow the
incorporation of some nonlinear relations.

An increasing number of SCM researchers have recently employed SEM in their works. Some examples include
Autry and Daugherty (2003), Gimenez and Ventura (2003, 2005), Large (2003, 2005), Stank et al. (2001) and
Wisner (2003).

The SCM area involves abstract concepts such as integration, collaboration, coordination, competitive
advantage and many others, which might be related among them. Such concepts can be represented by
latent variables.

Since the latent variables (also called factors) are not directly observable or measurable, it is necessary to have a
set of measures (or indicators) to account for the abstract concepts of interest. The fact that SEM can analyse
structural and measurement models simultaneously makes it especially valuable to researchers in SCM
(Gimenez 2004).

SEM is extremely flexible and powerful. It is also easy to use once one gets acquainted with it. But it is very
important to be especially careful when addressing the specification of the model, the preparation of the data, the
analysis, and possible re-specification of the model and the final
interpretation of the estimation results
(Gimenez et al. 2006).

4. Methodology

4.1 Instrument development and data collection

Based on previous studies, a survey questionnaire was developed with appropriate modifications to measure the
impact of the GSCM CSFs about the BSC performance. The GSCM CSF constructs were developed by Park (2004)
in the doctoral dissertation as the independent variables. Also the BSC performance constructs were developed by
Brewer and Speh (2001) as dependent variables in the BSC prospect respectively. To empirically test our study, we
selected 525 ‘Green Supply Chain Management Business’ project participant enterprises, which were supported by
government from 2003 to 2009. The development of the instrument involved a series of pre-tests of the
environmental experts and consultants who have some relation with the Korea National Cleaner Production Center
(KNCPC), and faculty members, doctoral and master course students of Dongguk University over a period of
about 3 months.

The pre-tests resulted in changes to the wording of certain items and the rearrangement of the order in some
items to improve clarity and minimise ambiguity. We used a sending e-mail and confirmed the telephone call survey
method; then we received the response of the survey which reached 249 firms of 525 populations and produced
a response rate of 47.43%. We finished the survey by 31 October 2009.

A summary of the characteristics of respondents is shown in Table 3. They come from a wide range of industries
with a predominance of chemical and electrical/electronic firms. Their annual sales revenue was also widely
distributed, in the anticipated medium to high range. The number of employees in each firm varied. Respondent’s
hierarchical level was also widely distributed. Comparisons (using chi-square tests at p¼ 0.05) between respondents
and non-respondents were made in terms of industry representation, annual sales revenue, and the number of
employees. The results suggested the absence of non-response bias.

4.2 Statistical procedure and exploratory factor analysis

SPSS and LISREL software packages were used to carry out the analysis. SPSS 17.0 was used to compute
frequencies, means, standard deviations, reliability coefficients, and exploratory factor analysis. A confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) approach was taken with LISREL to validate the factor loadings identified in the principle
component analysis. This validation was conducted in the form of a measurement model consisting of the seven
factors that were identified by the research model. A structural model was then run testing the research model and
hypotheses. The structural equation modelling package LISREL 8.72 was used for conducting the CFA. Factor
loadings were checked with the guidelines provided by Comrey and Lee.

Reliability and validity of the measures were assessed by the following steps proposed by King and Flor.

(1) Factor analysis was performed on all items that measure the model constructs.
(2) Based on the initial factor analysis, constructs with eigenvalues greater than one were retained.
(3) Only items with loadings of at least 0.50 were retained. Items with loadings greater than 0.50 on seven

constructs were investigated thoroughly.

(4) The corrected item-total correlation was computed for each item using only the items belonging to the same

construct.

(5) Cronbach’s Alphas were computed for each construct, reliability coefficients of 0.70 or higher are considered

acceptable.

(6) A CFA using SEM was performed on the final measurement model, several goodness-of-fit indexes were

used to assess the validity of the constructs.

The results of the assessment of the reliability and validity of measures are reported in Tables 4 and 5. Twenty-
nine items were submitted to the process in steps 1 to 6 as described above. The overall measurement model
explained above 68% of the variance. All items demonstrated corrected item-total correlations above 0.50 level.
Cronbach’s Alphas for all constructs were above 0.86.

Five factors drawn out through the EFA from the independent constructs. First is the ‘integration of
infrastructure (IoI)’ which is composed of using the IT solution and information systems, using the external

5. Data analysis and results

5.1 Overall model evaluation

The factorial validity of the constructs was examined via CFA using LISREL 8.72 software and the maximum
likelihood method (Joreskog and Sorbom 2002). Table 6 lists the results. The fitness of the measurement and the
structural models in this study were assessed using four indices (Byrne 1998, Kelloway 1998). First, the chi-square
test is the traditional measure used for testing the closeness of fit between the observed covariance matrix and the
model representation of the covariance matrix. The proposed model was chi-square of 493.83 (p¼ 0.00), degree
of freedom was 342, and the chi-square/d.f. could be calculated as 1.444 (53). Anderson and Gerbing (1988)
contended that the magnitude of chi-square/df should be below 3 and that the proposed model is valid.

Besides the chi-square test, this study reports three other indices:

(1) Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).
(2) Expected cross-validation index (ECVI).
(3) Comparative fit index (CFI), and other related indices.

The RMSEA provides information regarding the model fit unknown but optimal parameter values used as the
population covariance matrix if available.
RMSEA values of below 0.05 indicate good fit, RMSEA¼ 0.042, standardised root mean residual
(SRMR)¼ 0.034 (the rule of thumb is SRMR values of below 0.08 indicate good fit) (Bentler and Bonett 1980).
The ECVI relates to the discrepancy between the fitted covariance matrix in the analysed sample and the expected
covariance matrix obtained in another sample. Only a comparison of more ECVIs provides information regarding
the model fit; the model with the smallest ECVI has the best fit, and the ECVI¼ 2.74. Moreover, The CFI, NFI, and
NNFI provide a measure of the complete co-variation of the data based on the independence model. The proposed
model has CFI of 0.99, normed fit index (NFI) of 0.98, and non-normed fix index (NNFI) of 0.99. CFI, NFI, and
NNFI values exceeding 0.90 indicate an acceptable fit to the data (Bollen 1989).

To summarise, the overall goodness of fit was achieved. The measurement model produced the following fit
statistics. These statistics suggest that the hypothesised measurement model of Table 6 fits the data reasonably
closely.

5.2 Measurement model evaluation

The quality of the measurement efforts was then assessed by studying the reliability, convergent validity,
discriminant validity, and construct validity. Good construct reliability requires composite reliability exceeding 0.70


International Journal of Production Research

2477

(Bagozzi and Yi 1988). The reliabilities of the internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient) of the measure
of the five dimensions as independent variables were 0.918, 0.903, 0.928, 0.867, and 0.880 respectively; moreover, the
two dimensions as dependent variables were 0.958 and 0.956 respectively. All scales demonstrate good reliability.
The reliability was jointly assessed for all construct items by calculating the composite reliability (CR). As for the
CR, which was calculated as (sum of standardised loadings)2/[(sum of standardised loadings)2þ (sum of
measurement error)], the CR of non-finance and finance performance composite reliability was calculated as 0.97
and 0.93 respectively. Additionally, the CR of the integration of infrastructure, collaboration with partners, mutual
trust, planning and implementation and activation of supporting composite reliability (CR) were listed as 0.80, 0.83,
0.86, 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. The CR value exceeds 0.60 indicating an acceptable fit to the data (Fornell and
Larcker 1981).

Furthermore, construct validity could be supported by examining the evidence for each construct,
including appropriate items with loadings of almost above 0.60 on their respective hypothesised components in
a CFA. Table 7 indicated significant and large loadings on hypothesised factors. Regarding the assessment
of convergent validity, it could be supported by applying a CFA model. Most loadings in Table 7 are significant
(p 5 0.05) and nearly almost R2 exceed 0.60 (Hildebrandt 1987). The convergent validity thus still holds.

Regarding the discriminant validity, this study first checked whether the correlations among the latent constructs
were significantly less than unity (see Table 8). A series of nested confirmatory models were then compared, in which
the correlation coefficient between similar attributes/constructs should exceed that between different attributes/
constructs. The intercorrelation among GSCM CSFs and the BSC performances ranges from 0.40 to 0.82.
Constraining this correlation to unity invariably significantly changed the goodness-of-fit statistic.

This study also employed the average variance extracted (AVE) to confirm the discriminant validity of the
proposed model, and calculated AVE as (sum of squared standardised loadings)/(sum of squared standardised
loadingsþ sum of measurement error). AVE of the GSCM CSFs were then compared and found to be above 0.50
respectively. Additionally, the AVE of the BSC performances were all 0.80 respectively. Notably, AVE exceeding
0.50 indicates an acceptable fit to the data (Fornell and Larcker 1981) and that the proposed model still holds.

5.3 Structural model evaluation

Figure 5 reveals that almost significant relationships between latent constructs are in the hypothesised direction,
providing initial evidence supporting the proposed conceptual model.
Planning and implementation was the dominant antecedent of non-finance performance (H1c : 
3¼ 0.29). As
summarised in Table 9, hypothesis 1 is supported except activation of supporting (H1e : 
5¼ 0.17) because t-value
is lower than 1.65. Again, non-finance performance was the dominant antecedent of finance performance
(H2e : 
10¼ 1.10). As can be seen in Table 9, hypothesis 2 is supported except collaboration with partners
(H2b : 
7¼ 0.12) and mutual trust (H2d : 
9¼ 0.094). Activation of supporting was a negative impact to the
finance performance (H3 : 
11¼ 0.43), therefore hypothesis 3 is supported.

Table 10 lists these effects. Planning and implementation was the most dominant antecedent of total effect,
followed by integration of infrastructure. Activation of supporting was negative to total effect. Consequently,
planning and implementation which is composed of periodically managing the demand and supply planning with
GSCM enterprises, establishing the common production and marketing planning with GSC partners and performing
the common inventory management with partners is the most important activities in the GSCM, followed by
integration of infrastructure which is composed of using the IT solutions for the GSCM systemically, using the
external expert for the GSCM and taking the GSCM partnership programme. On the other hand, activation of
supporting which is composed of practising the environment-related educations for the GSCM, establishing the long-
term strategy for the GSCM, providing various supporting programmes for the practitioner and holding the wholly
responsible department and staffs for the GSCM, had a negative effect on the finance performance in the GSCM.

6. Discussion and conclusions

6.1 Discussion of results

Industrial logistics has been playing a major role in providing a competitive advantage for the enterprises which
have combined the supply chain management and the environmental management to enhance the competitive
position of SME suppliers.

GSCM has emerged as an important new archetype for enterprises to achieve profit and market share objectives
by lowering their environmental risks and impacts while raising their ecological efficiency (Van Hock and Erasmus
2000). With the requirements of sustainable development and the economy globalisation, Korean enterprises have
begun to change their focus from single plant improvements to the whole supply chains.

Some Korean enterprises have recognised its importance and tried to put it into practice, but most of them lack
experience as well as the necessary tools and management skills. This study will help determine whether adopting
these measures is worth the effort of these organisations in terms of BSC performance. It will also help us identify
what relationships seem to be significant, providing guidance to organisations as to what practices may be
worthwhile adopting.

The findings in our work begin to use the Korean enterprises experience to explain various relationships on what
may and may not work, especially for early adopting enterprises of GSCM practices. The direct relationships
between GSCM CSFs overall and BSC performance expectations were very promising.

There seems to be significant win-win opportunities like the blue ocean strategies for Korean enterprises that
seek to implement GSCM CSFs. The GSCM CSFs seem to work as was expected of them in terms of positive
performance. The customer, process and learning and growth performance as the non-finance performance had
a plus and the strong relationship exists to the finance performance, but activation of supporting had a negative
effect on the finance performance, because of its cost for the company. Of course, for a specific and particular firm
this may not be the case.

Another issue is that we were only considering the expectations and beliefs of the relationships, actual financial
numbers were not used. Thus, we could not confirm whether positive or negative economic performance actually
occurred. Overall, expectations of management in these organisations that win-win opportunities do exist will play a
role in lessening the barrier to GSCM adoption. Thus, we can foresee that many organisations in Korea will identify
with these early findings.

The other issue that may arise in this situation is that most of these Korean enterprises are very early in the
adoption stages of these GSCM CSFs. Whether these results hold as the adoption of GSCM CSFs matures is an
issue that needs to be investigated. We found a number of relationships among the GSCM CSF and performance.

6.2 Managerial insights

These results in Korean enterprises are supported in the literature by a number of researchers who have looked
at other manufacturing enterprises. Park (2004) tested planning and implementation factors of top- and mid-
management support, mission statement, department goals, and training and evaluation for their respective impacts
on GSCM such as environmental purchasing.

Among all the factors, support from top and mid-level managers was a key to implementing GSCM successfully.
An enterprise’ top-level management is ultimately charged with the responsibility of maximising shareholder wealth
and, through their strategic leadership, determining the direction of the organisation including defining values,
vision and strategic intent (Hamel and Prahalad 1989).

Thus, commitment from top management is positively related to GSCM though such commitment is mainly due
to technological and commercial reasons rather than environmental reasons (Bowen et al. 2001). Our investigation
demonstrated that planning and implementation,
is
highlighted with the highest total effect (direct effect 0.33þ indirect effect 0.319¼ 0.649) among five GSCM CSFs
and can bring better finance performance.

including support from top- and middle management,

Planning and implementation is performing the planning, organisation, co-ordination and control of common

supply and demand, production, marketing and inventory with the supply chain partners.


International Journal of Production Research

2481
Integration of infrastructure (direct effect 0.30þ indirect effect 0.275¼ 0.575) has a positive direct and indirect
effect on finance performance also. Integration of infrastructure is establishing the IT-based infrastructure, using the
external experts, performing the partnership programme and organising the cross functional team with the supply
chain partners.
Collaboration with partners (direct effect  0.12þ indirect effect 0.297¼ 0.177) and mutual trust (direct effect
 0.094þ indirect effect 0.242¼ 0.148) have negative direct effect, but they have positive total effect, and can bring
better finance performance. Collaboration with partners is establishing the common goal, holding the regular
meeting and achieving the standardisation and integration of information with the supply chain partners. Mutual
trust is performing the mutual benefits-based contract, open-minded conversation with partner’s staffs and trusting
the capability of partners.
However, results show that activation of supporting is not highlighted yet with the lowest total effect (direct
effect  0.43þ indirect effect 0.187¼ 0.243) among five GSCM CSFs, and can bring negative finance performance
in the short term. Activation of supporting is practising the environment-related education and performing diverse
supporting programmes for environmental performance.

Most Korean enterprises are aware of the importance of GSCM but few have really implemented it due to lack

of knowledge and tools. However, globalisation for the Korean enterprises may result in better GSCM CSFs.

First, globalisation increases multinational enterprises (MNEs) investment in developing countries where their
subsidiaries can be expected to self-regulate their BSC performance involved in environmental performance more
than domestic firms do. Experiences or even lessons from these foreign enterprises to improve environmental
performance can be learned by domestic enterprises.

Second, MNEs have changed from foreign direct investor to multinational operators of global networks of
suppliers (Dunning 1993). By improving environmental performance of their products, more Korean enterprises
have become suppliers of foreign enterprises. These foreign enterprises in Korea might exert pressure on domestic
suppliers to self-regulate environmental performance.

Finally, globalisation may increase export from developing countries such as Korea to developed countries
where customers might use BSC performance involved in environmental performance as a supplier-selection
criterion, which also pressures domestic enterprises in Korea to self-regulate.

6.3 Conclusions and future research

We found a number of relationships between the critical success factors about the balanced scorecard performance
in Korean Green Supply Chain Management enterprises.

In summary the following practical issues and lessons arose:

(1) In the non-finance performance, planning and implementation was a dominant antecedent factor in the
causal relation between GSCM CSFs and BSC performance, followed by collaboration with partners and
integration of infrastructure. Mutual trust was also significant in the performance. But, activation of
supporting was not significant due to the increase of costs.

(2) In the finance performance, non-finance performance being integrated five factors of GSCM CSFs was
a dominant antecedent element to the finance performance, followed by planning and implementation to the
finance performance. But activation of supporting had a negative effect on the finance performance.

And so, increased costs and burdens acted as obstacles to the GSCM in Korea. However, the activation of
supporting should not be neglected to increase the value of the enterprise in the mid- to long-term from the socio-
economic and environmental viewpoints.

Since a major portion of the world’s manufacturing will be taking place in Southeast Asia in the coming decade,
GSCM practices will be even more critical (Rao 2002). Developing countries such as the China, Philippines,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore may have similar market and socio-cultural situations on GSCM
practices when compared to Korean enterprises, and thus, enterprises in these countries can also learn from lessons
and potential relationships identified in this study.

In arriving at these overall results, we must mention the limitations of this study. First, in this survey study, only
governmentally supported enterprises were investigated and analysed, so it is possible that the study results cannot
represent the GSCM characteristics on the whole. There is a need to study more enterprises again in the future.


2482

J. Kim and J. Rhee

Second, this study reviewed many SCM-oriented enterprises CSFs instead of GSCM itself because these GSCM
enterprises have only recently adopted many of these practices. It needs to study GSCM CSFs again when the
GSCM practices are established in the future.

Third, the samples were comprised of Korean GSCM enterprises, which only recently adopted many of these
practices and had very different characteristics compared with firms in other countries. It needs to investigate
whether more mature adopters show similar results internationally.

Finally, in order to concretely confirm the research results, qualitative case studies need to be conducted in the

future to complement this quantitative study.

Overall, this study provided additional insight into the growing field of the relationships between environmental
and operational practices and performance. Clearly, the field has ample space to grow in terms of research and
practice.
