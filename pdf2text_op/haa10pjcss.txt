Abstract 
This paper reports the initial finding on examination of the effect of product and service 
quality on ‘ethical brand’, which in turn may influence a company’s reputation among 
industrial buyers that use electronic office equipment. The current study is informed by 
50 experienced industrial buyers when buying electronic office equipment in Malaysia. 
The initial result does show that ethical brand has a full mediation impact on corporate 
reputation.  In  general,  this  study  adds  to  the  existing  literature  on  branding  and 
reputation by introducing the concept of the ‘ethical brand’ in order to understand the 
formation of a company reputation. 
Keywords: Ethical brand, company’s reputation, corporate reputation, industrial buyers 
1. Introduction  
The  Internet  revolution  took  place  in  the  early  1990s  and  has  brought  us  into  a  new 
era—the  digital  era.  Consequently,  business  practice  conditions  are  dramatically 
influenced by the adoption of digital technology, and strategies must change to remain 
innovative and competitive (Ainin, 2005).  
The  use  of  new  technology,  global  logistics,  and  information  systems  is  a  part  of 
industrial buyer’s process, and has been identified as source of firm’s market orientation 
(Kohli and Jaworski, 1990) and sustainable competitive advantage (Day, 1991). In this 
wake  of  globalization,  one  specific  issue  with  increasing  relevance  in  business  and 
theoretical studies is the role of ethics in business (see, e.g. Pearson, 1995; Halme, 1997; 
Dienhart and Curnutt, 1998; Sen, 1995, 1999). Reasons for the rise of ethical concerns 
in business are many-sided and complex. Social and environmental concerns have also 
materialized  as  a  consequence.  Ethical  aspects  have  already  been  noted  as  important 
factors  in  business  encounters.  One  can  also  cite  the  increasing  integration  of 
environmental  issues  within  the  industrial  buyer  is  office  equipment  products. 
According to regulation of Malaysia (E-waste.com, 2005), waste will affect the quality 
of  the  environment.  The  above  issues  clearly  affect every type of business, enterprise, 

 


Ethical Brand and Company Reputation 

organization  and  person,  which  then  becoming  the  question  of  ethics.  Zabid  and 
Alsagoff (1993) indicate that the ethical business climate in Malaysia was at a critical 
stage, and the companies compete on three issues: quality, price and ethical standard.  
In  the  past,  the  effects  of  product  and  service  quality  on  industrial  buyers’  responses 
have  been  commonly  researched  (e.g.  Bendixen  et  al.,  2004;  Mudambi  et  al.,  1997; 
Chaudhuri  and  Holbrook,  2001;  Bliemel  and  Leone,  1998;  Bozzo,  2001;  Reicheld, 
1996).  Price  is  also  viewed  as  the  most  important  purchasing  decision  criterion  (e.g. 
Mudambi et al., 1997; Alvarez and Galera, 2001; Neslin and Gedenk, 1999). However, 
Fan (2005) argues that customer buying behaviour is not necessarily based on product 
and  service  quality  or  price  perception  but  also  on  how  ethical  the  company  has 
performed  in  manufacturing  products  and  services  (i.e.  ethical  brand).  This  area  has 
however,  received  little  attention  previously.  Ethical  brands,  which  promise  social 
performance  as  well  as  economic  and  environment  performance,  clearly  indicate  that 
there  is  a  close  link  between  ethical  branding  and  company’s  reputation.  Moreover, 
corporate  ethics  is  important  in  globalization  as  it  has  positive  affect  on  company’s 
reputation (Singhapakdi et. al, 1999) and enhances a company’s reputation. (Fan, 2005 
& Paluszek, 2006). 
It is thus the present study intention to determine the importance of the role of ethical 
brands  on  the  behaviour  of  industrial  buyers.  The  specific  research  questions  are  as 
follows: 

1.  Does having a better quality of product and service will lead customers 

to perceive the brand as ethical? 

2.  Do ethical brands mediate the effect between predictors (product and 

service quality) and a company’s reputation? 

This  study  will  determine  whether  or  not  ethical  brands  and  the  already  existing 
independent  variables  (such  as  product  and  service  quality)  influence  company’s 
reputation of industrial buyers towards electronic office equipment in Malaysia. 
2. Literature review 
In  previous  studies,  quality  (Bendixen  et  al.,  2004),  or  more  specifically  performance 
components  (Mudambi  et  al.,  1997),  have  been  identified  as  the  main  drivers  of 
industrial brand equity. The positive and significant relationships between product and 
service quality and repeated buying behaviour of industrial buyer’s was also reported by 
Bliemel and Eggert (1998), Bozzo (2001), Reicheld (1996). 
A current study based on the model of branding that is useful in explaining the brand 
power  has  a  number  of  deficiencies.  According  to  Fan  (2005),  there  are  two  basic 
elements  missing:  legality  and  ethics. Consequently, a good brand contains a legal as 
well as an ethical standard. Thus brand value needs to be assessed by both financial and 
ethical measures. Second, the past model of branding (conventional brand model) truly 
emphasizes product brands rather than corporate brands. However, brands and branding 
have  a  considerable  impact  on  the  customers  who  buys them as well as on society as 
whole.  Brands  that  satisfy  one  group  may  also  possible  negatively  affect  another. 
Therefore,  stakeholders  as  a  whole,  who  are  impacted  by  branding,  should  be 
considerate.  It  means  that  brands  must  contribute  positively  to  society  by  inserting 
ethical  values,  especially  in  the  broader  social  context.  Thus,  responding  to  customer

Hoq et al. 

concerns  for  marketing  practices,  including  ethical  obligation  to  anticipate  the 
complaint are very crucial to be applied in order to maintain the reputation.  
While the company’s reputation is derived from perceptions of all stakeholders (Whetten 
& Mackey, 2002, p. 401), Wartick (2002, p. 377) suggests it is pragmatic to focus on 
just  the  immediate  customers,  as  they  usually  are  the  group  that  have  the  major 
influence. Greyser (1996) advocates that the core component of corporate reputation is a 
corporate  brand.  Moreover,  he  also  discovers  that  there  is  an  interesting  relationship 
between  corporate  reputation  and  corporate  performance,  especially  from  social 
performance. Thus, with regards to ethical brands, which promise social performance as 
well as economic and environmental performance, it appears that there may be a close 
link between ethical brand and corporate reputation. Furthermore, ethical brand can be a 
strategic  differentiation  to  provide  a  superior  value  to  customer  by  high  standards  of 
business integrity and social responsibility (Paluszek, 2006). ‘Ethical brand’ thus should 
be  incorporated  in  research  to  better  model  industrial  buyers’  responses  (Paluszek, 
2006). This additional construct may have a mediation impact between service, product 
quality and a company’s reputation. 
4. Theoretical framework and hypotheses development 
The link between product and service quality and company reputation: 
In  the  present  study,  twelve  elements  have  been  combined  to  conceptualize  product 
quality:  (1)  Good  performance,  (2)  Good  features,  (3)  Good  specification,  (4)  Good 
durability, (5) Aesthetics (Crosby, et al., 2003), (6) High quality product, (7) Dependable 
and  consistent,  (8)  Innovative  (Van  Riel,  et  al.,  2005),  (9)  Digitalizability,  (10) 
Tangibility, (11) Perishability, (12) Fulfillment ease (Yadav and Varadarajan, 2005).  
Service  quality  on  the  other  hands  is  about  the  ability  to  advise  the  customers  in 
technical and commercial questions in the business to business context (Aaker, 1997). In 
general,  with  the  increased  use  of the internet, this situation is changing, and service 
quality  is  conceptualized  by  (1)  Visually  appealing  of  physical  facilities,  (2)  The 
appearance of the physical facilities, (3) Promise to do by a certain time, (4) Sympathetic 
and  reassuring  staff,  (5)  Dependable,  (6)  Trust  employees,  (7)  Polite  employees,  (8) 
Personal  attention,  (9)  Know  what  our  needs  (Jayawardhena  et  al.,  2005),  (10)  Good 
information,  (11)  Good  online  information,  (12)  Good  documentation,  (13)  Quickly 
receive  supplementary  information  (Van  Riel,  et  al.,  2005).  A  leading  electronic 
company that offers high quality can enhance customer confident (Wall street Journal, 
2000), neglecting it would damage company reputation (Lancanster and Allen, 1992). 
Rationally,  company  reputation  is  influenced  by:  (1)  Product  Quality;  (2)  Service 
Quality; and (3) Ethical Brand. Thus, it could be posited that: 

H1 

H2 

Product quality will have a positive direct relationship with Corporate 
Reputation. 
Service quality will have a positive direct relationship with Corporate 
Reputation. 

The link between product quality and ethical brand: 
According to Fan (2005), brand value needs to be assessed by ethical measures. In this 
case, it needs to develop standards for marketing practice and standards for stakeholder 

 

102


Ethical Brand and Company Reputation 

as  whole  to  continue  the  business  relationship.  In  rational,  quality  of  product  that  is 
perceived  by  business  buyer,  may  effect  the  perception  on  ethical  value  of  the  brand. 
Thus, it could be hypothesized that: 

H3 

Product  quality  will  have  a  positive  direct  relationship  with  ethical 
brand. 

The link between service quality and ethical brand: 
Service after sales indicates commitment of the firm, how serious is the firm to care for 
its customers particularly for electronic product (e g. electronic office equipments, such 
as Computer Server, Notebook, Desktop, Printer, Photocopier and so on). If a company 
provides  better  quality  of  service  than  its  competitor,  the  company  will  be  seen  as 
concerns with the ethical value which in turn lead to a positive image for the company. 
The buyer believes that brand (or company) along with the truly quality of service has 
paid attention to social life by considering social responsibility. The hypothesis can then 
be stated as: 
H4 

Service  quality  will  have  a  positive  direct  relationship  with  ethical 
brand. 

The indirect relationship between products, service quality and company reputation (via 
Ethical Brand):  
Whetten & Mackey (2002) define company reputation as a particular type of feed-back 
received  by  an  organization  from  its  stakeholders,  concerning  the  credibility  of  the 
organization’s  identity  claims.  Wartick  (2002)  proposes  that  company’s  reputation  is 
derived  from  perceptions  of  all  stakeholders;  indicating  that  corporate  reputation  and 
corporate  performance  might  enjoy  close  relationship  particularly  from  the  aspect  of 
social performance. The previous paragraph has explained that quality of product and 
service are antecedent to ethical brand. Thus, there are indirect effects indicated between 
product and service quality and company reputation via ethical brand. The associations 
can be then hypothesised as follows: 

H5 

H6 

Product  quality  will  have  positive  relationship  with  company’s 
reputation via ethical brand (indirect effect). 
Service  quality  will  have  positive  relationship  with  company’s 
reputation via ethical brand (indirect effect). 

5. Methodology 
5.1 Data collection 
As  mentioned,  the  current  study  reports  on  the  initial  result  as  data  collection  is 
currently still in progress. Online and mail survey are used to assist data collection in 
Malaysia  for  three  areas  (Kuala  Lumpur,  Selangor,  and  Negeri  Sembilan)  from 
industrial buyers that use electronic office equipment. As the target group is sufficiently 
large  and  the people  in the sample frame are accessible and available, simple random 
sampling is constructed to get respondents using the electronic office equipment. All the 
respondents are the executives involved in buying decision-making.

5.2 Questionnaire development 
There are four main constructs identified in the present study: (1) Product Quality (PQ); 
(2) Service Quality (SQ); (3) Ethical Brand (EB); and (4) Company’s Reputation (CR). 
Measures for the variables were developed from Crosby, et al., (2003), Van Riel, et al., 
(2005), Enderle, G. and Tavis, L.A., (1998), Cretu and Brodie (2005) and Jayawardhena 
et al., (2005). Content and face validity were conducted through the reviews of experts 
in  scale  construction  and, by participants in this pre-test. Seven Point likert scale has 
been used (i.e. 1= strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree). A validity testing was also 
conducted. The questions were viewed as valid and understandable for the current study. 
6. Analysis and results 
6.1 Factor Analysis and Reliability 
Data  was  analysed  using  SPSS.  To  investigate  the  initial  result,  factor  analysis  and 
reliability test are commonly used. Malhotra (1996) suggested to indicate some variables 
correlating  each  other’s,  and  its  must  be  reduced  first  before  conducting  the  further 
analysis. According to Hair et al., (1998), minimum value of factor loading depended on 
number of respondent. Having 50 respondents, this study used .6 as minimum value of 
factor loading. Composition of measures and number of items for the resulting factors 
are presented in Appendix at Table 1. 
Reliability test shows that Cronbach's Alpha of constructs is between 0.953 and 0.976. 
The  result  of  Cronbach’s  Alpha  for  product  quality  (0.976),  service  quality  (0.972), 
ethical brand (0.968) and company reputation (0.953).  
In term of discriminant validity inspection, Pearson Correlation was used and the result 
indicates  that  there  is  no  collenearity  among  the  constructs  as  there  is  no  high 
correlation  (above  .90)  as  being  considered  by  Hair  et  al,  1998.  Correlation  for  the 
resulting factors is presented in Appendix at Table 2. Besides that, there is no indication 
of heterocedasticity from scatterplot graph and standardized residual and data appear to 
be normally distributed around the diagonal line as the predictive line. 
6.2 Regression Analysis 
Linear regression is used to test direct relationship of the conceptual model. Results are

7. Conclusion 
Finding  of  this  study  indicates  that  quality  of  product  and  service  can  also  play  an 
important role in the business markets and affect ethical brand and company reputation. 
Ethical  brand,  when  controlled,  appears  to  indicate  a  significant  role  in  the  business 
market.  This  study  discovers  that  ethical  brand  is  a  significant  component  as  a 
mediating variable in the model of industrial buyer. This current study appear consistent 
with previous research by Whetten & Mackey, 2002; Wartick, 2002; Greyser 1996 who 
argue  that  company’s  reputation  is  derived  from  perceptions  of  all  stakeholders, 
therefore,  spending  attention  for  social  responsibility  is  necessary  for  the  company. 
Therefore,  a  strong  brand  with  ethical  concerned  is  counted  as  a  valuable  asset  of  a 
company (Fan, 2005) to achieve good reputation.  
The  current  paper  has  its  managerial  contribution  for  practitioners  who  want  to 
understand  what  the  role  of  ethical  brand  of  the  electronic  equipment  in  industrial 
buyers’ context is. Incorporating ethical brand in the marketing programme is necessary 
to  enhance  the  reputation.  A  company  must  encourage  ethical  decision-making  in 
ethically  ideal  marketing  programmes  by  providing  a  commitment  to  ethical  analysis 
using moral philosophy. This is relevant with Bowen (2004) who addresses some factors 
encouraging ethical decision-making to achieve a good image of the organization. It is 
also in line with Caza, and Cameron (2004) who note that business ethics help create 
and  facilitate  self-reinforcing  positive  outcomes  and  can  help  protect  individuals  and 
corporations from attack. 
8. Limitations and suggestions for future research 
The current study is not without its limitations. As the current study is still in progress, 
50  sample  respondents  from  the  industrial  buyers  are  yet  to  be  sufficient  for 
generalisation  but  the current study will be increasing its sample sizes in near future. 
Although low in sample size as what is reported here is our initial finding, however, 50 
responses  from  industrial  buyers  may  not  be  comparable  with  individual  consumers. 
Moreover, the present study examines the industrial buyers’ responses of the electronic 
office  equipment.  Thus,  the  findings  of  this  study  could  not  be  generalized  in  other 
industries. Cross-validation to other industries could not be performed in this study as it 
is  out  with  scope.  Replicating  this  research  in  similar  or  other  industries  is  therefore 
essential  in  generalizing  the  findings  of  this  study.  Adding  new  construct  into  this 
constructed model is also requested in order to outcome the future model will be more 
sophisticated. 
This  current  study  has incorporated the ‘ethical brand’ construct and investigating its 
effect  on  company’s  reputation  among  industrial’s  buyers  toward  electronic  office 
equipment. Future studies could replicate this research in other product categories such 
as business to consumers market.
