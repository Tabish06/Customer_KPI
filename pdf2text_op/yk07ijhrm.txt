Average employee tenure, voluntary
turnover ratio, and labour productivity:
evidence from Japanese ﬁrms

Yoshio Yanadori and Takao Kato

Abstract Using Japanese ﬁrms’ data, this study shows that voluntary turnover ratio is
negatively related to ﬁrm labour productivity. While recent studies have reported the
negative inﬂuence of turnover on organizational performance (Kacmar et al., 2006; Shaw
et al., 2005a), they analysed only US samples. Our study contributes to researchers’ efforts
to generalize the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance.
Turnover is detrimental to labour productivity as it reduces the stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
human capital that a ﬁrm retains. Findings suggest that ﬁrm average employee tenure
mediates the relationship between voluntary turnover and labour productivity.

Introduction

Human resource management
researchers are increasingly interested in the
relationship between turnover ratio and organization performance (Glebbeek and Bax,
2004; Kacmar et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2005a, 2005b). This is primarily due to the
increased attention paid to the role of human resource management in improving
organizational effectiveness (e.g., Huselid, 1995; Ichniowski et al., 1997). Recently
researchers have devoted signiﬁcant effort to understanding the mechanisms through
which human resource practices improve organizational effectiveness. One suggested
mechanism involves voluntary turnover; that is, certain human resource management
practices are associated with a lower turnover ratio, subsequently leading to improved
organization effectiveness. While a few recent studies have reported the negative
relationship between turnover ratio and subsequent organizational performance (Kacmar
et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2005a, 2005b), empirical evidence is evolving and has yet to
generalize this relationship.

This study provides another piece of evidence that supports the claim that voluntary
turnover has a negative inﬂuence on organizational effectiveness. Using data from
Japanese ﬁrms in a variety of industries, we investigate the relationship between the
voluntary turnover ratio of a ﬁrm and its labour productivity. In essence, our results are

consistent with emerging turnover studies, for example, Kacmar et al. (2006) and Shaw
et al. (2005a), which report that voluntary turnover ratio is negatively related to
subsequent organization performance. Our study contributes to human resource
management researchers’ effort to generalize the relationship between turnover ratio and
organizational effectiveness in two ways. First, we use Japanese ﬁrms’ data, while
Kacmar et al. (2006) and Shaw et al. (2005a) both analyse US ﬁrms. The negative
relationship between turnover ratio and organization effectiveness holds in Japan, where
employment contexts are distinct from those in the US. Second, our sample consists of
ﬁrms from multiple industries, whereas Kacmar et al. (2006) and Shaw et al. (2005a)
study only one industry (i.e., fast food restaurants and transportation).

This study delineates one key mechanism through which turnover negatively
inﬂuences organization performance. The aforementioned turnover studies (e.g., Kacmar
et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2005a) draw primarily upon human capital theory (Becker,
1975) and claim that turnover negatively inﬂuences organization performance through
the loss of human capital, particularly ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. As employees’ ﬁrm-
speciﬁc human capital increases through the acquisition of experience in the ﬁrm, longer
employee tenure will be equated with greater ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. From a ﬁrm
perspective, a ﬁrm’s average employee tenure will represent the stock of the ﬁrm-speciﬁc
human capital its employees possess. Voluntary turnover ratio negatively inﬂuences
organizational effectiveness because it leads to the decrease in a ﬁrm’s average employee
tenure, and thus the decrease in its stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. This study
empirically tests and conﬁrms this argument by incorporating the turnover and average
employee tenure variables in the analytical model.

Although our empirical evidence is consistent with the claim that turnover negatively
inﬂuences organizational effectiveness, the results of this study must be interpreted with
a degree of caution. Our analysis shows that there is a negative and statistically
signiﬁcant relationship between turnover ratio and organization performance; however,
we are unable to establish a causal relationship in the sense that higher turnover leads to
lower organization performance. Our additional analysis suggests the possibility that
organization performance may also affect turnover ratio. These results call for further
theory and research on the nature of the causal relationship between employee turnover
and organizational performance.

Our study proceeds as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the relationship between the average
employee tenure of an organization and its organizational effectiveness. Then we
proceed to the discussion of
the relationship between employee turnover and
organizational effectiveness. The inﬂuence of voluntary turnover will be better
understood after an elaboration of the role of employee tenure and human capital in
improving organizational effectiveness. We then specify our analytical approach. In the
following sections, we discuss our results and their implications for theory.

Turnover and outﬂow of human capital

Human capital has long been recognized as one primary factor that accounts for the
difference in productivity among workers (Becker, 1975). This theory originally claims
that there are two types of human capital: general human capital and ﬁrm-speciﬁc human
capital. General human capital, acquired through formal education and general
vocational training, improves worker productivity irrespective of organization. Any
organization can exploit a workers’ general human capital upon hiring them. Firm-
speciﬁc human capital, on the other hand, which includes knowledge (e.g., know-how)
and skills speciﬁc to the ﬁrm, is acquired through accumulating experience in the focal

ﬁrm and ﬁrm-speciﬁc training. Unlike general human capital, ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital
improves worker productivity only for the focal ﬁrm. While some researchers recognized
its potential to contribute to organizational effectiveness (e.g. Pfeffer, 1994), human
capital was traditionally used for administrative purposes such as specifying job
requirements or setting employee pay levels (Milkovich and Newman, 2005).

Recently the resource-based view of the ﬁrm (Barney, 1991) caused human resource
management researchers to re-realize the role of human capital, particularly ﬁrm-speciﬁc
human capital, in enhancing organizational effectiveness. The resource-based view of
the ﬁrm essentially claims that a ﬁrm’s internal resources that are not easily transferred to
other ﬁrms will generate a source of sustained competitive advantages. Firm-speciﬁc
human capital is valuable only for the focal ﬁrms and thus its non-transferable nature
creates a barrier so that other ﬁrms cannot acquire this particular resource.

While original human capital theory was interested in the productivity of each worker,
this new perspective extends the contributions of human capital to organizational
effectiveness. The unit of analysis has shifted from individuals to organizations.
Consequently, researchers have begun to pay more attention to the human capital each
ﬁrm retains. Recent studies report that an organization’s aggregated level of employee
human capital is related to its organizational performance (Hitt et al., 2001) or even
organizational survival (Pennings et al., 1998). These studies focus on particular
components of human capital (e.g., tacit knowledge) rather than human capital as a
whole; however, they share the same underlying premise. That is, the greater the ﬁrm-
speciﬁc human capital an organization retains, the better its organizational effectiveness.
Because ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital is accumulated as the employee gains experience
in a ﬁrm, longer tenure will be associated with the increased ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital
each employee has acquired. At an organizational level, a ﬁrm’s average employee
tenure represents the stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital its employees have acquired.
Consequently, longer average employee tenure at a ﬁrm will be associated with greater
ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, which leads to better organizational effectiveness.

In Japan, even though there was a strong tendency among workers to stay in one
organization for their entire professional careers (e.g. Kato, 2001), it has been reported
recently that an increasing number of Japanese workers change their ﬁrms and
professions (Recruit, 2000). Hence, we ﬁrst submit that the variance in average employee
tenure will account for the variance in ﬁrm effectiveness among Japanese ﬁrms. We
expect that the positive inﬂuence of human capital on organizational effectiveness will be
the most apparent in labour productivity, a dimension that is particularly relevant to the
contributions human resources make (Datta et al., 2005).

Hypothesis 1: Average employee tenure is positively related to ﬁrm labour

productivity.

Granted that the level of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital a ﬁrm retains is associated with
its labour productivity, voluntary employee turnover will be detrimental to the ﬁrm as
it directly relates to a loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital (Shaw et al., 2005a).
A replacement employee may already have the equivalent general human capital as her
former employee. However, as long as the replacement is new to the ﬁrm, it takes her
some time to become as productive as her predecessor. This is because she does not have
comparable ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, which will be acquired only through receiving
training and accumulating experience in the ﬁrm. Therefore, voluntary turnover, which
causes a loss of human capital, will be negatively related to subsequent ﬁrm labour
productivity. While average employee tenure represents the stock of ﬁrm-level human

capital, turnover ratio represents the ﬂow, more particularly the negative ﬂow, of ﬁrm-
level human capital. The negative ﬂow of human capital will be associated with
decreased labour productivity.

theory. Their empirical analyses report

Two recent studies on voluntary employee turnover and organization effectiveness by
Kacmar et al. (2006) and Shaw et al. (2005a) draw more or less upon this notion.
Employee turnover means a loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital and ﬁrm investments in
it, and consequently voluntary turnover negatively inﬂuences organizational effective-
ness. In their study of a ﬁrst food restaurant chain, Kacmar et al. (2006) emphasize the
role of tacit knowledge among crew members (e.g., how many sandwiches should be
made to be enough to serve incoming customers, minimizing food wastes at the same
time), which can be gained through accumulating relevant experience in the focal
restaurants. Shaw et al. (2005a) articulate the relationship between employee turnover
and workforce performance in detail by comparing several alternatives derived from
human capital
the attenuated negative
relationship between voluntary employee turnover ratio and organizational effectiveness.
In addition to the loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, voluntary turnover damages a
ﬁrm’s activities in other ways such as the disruption of ﬁrm’s operations and the
demoralization of remaining employees (Staw, 1980). Most tasks in organizations are
accomplished through interactions among the members. Through the accumulation of
experience, employees learn how to interact more effectively with each other by learning
their counterparts’ behavioural patterns. As a result, one employee’s departure may force
other employees to revise their ways of interacting in order to accommodate the
the ﬁrm’s productivity may be
replacement’s behavioural patterns. Consequently,
disrupted until co-workers have completed their adjustment
to the replacement.
Moreover, turnover often causes the remaining employees to reassess their current
environment and to recognize alternatives outside their own ﬁrms. It may undermine
employee morale and thus their productivity.

We recognize that a different perspective, although not entirely contradictory to ours,
has been proposed to explain the relationship between employee turnover and
organizational effectiveness. This perspective argues that there is an optimal level of
turnover for organizations. Employee turnover may be regarded as a healthy human
resources metabolism that revitalizes the organization until the negative effect of
employee turnover surpasses its positive effect. Consequently, this perspective claims
that the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational effectiveness should
be inverted U-shaped: positive when voluntary turnover ratio is low, but negative once it
goes beyond the threshold point. The empirical evidence on this inverted U-shaped
relationship is limited, however. Glebbeek and Bax (2004) reported an inverted
U-shaped relationship between turnover and organization performance when analysing
the ofﬁces of a temporary job agency in the Netherlands. Empirical studies have yet to
conﬁrm this inverted U-shaped relationship when the voluntary turnover ratio and
performance have been examined across ﬁrms.

Arguably, whether a certain level of turnover is desirable to organizations or not may
depend on the quality of workers who leave the organizations. If organizations are
equipped with mechanisms that systematically induce unproductive workers to leave,
turnover may be beneﬁcial as it eventually improves the quality of human capital the
organizations retain. One such mechanism is pay for performance plans where payment
is tied to individual performance. Lower pay due to low productivity encourages
unproductive workers to leave the organization (Gerhart and Rynes, 2003). Nevertheless,
we have difﬁculty ﬁnding such mechanisms in Japanese organizations. Even though
recent research suggests that Japanese ﬁrms are increasingly more aware of the need for

making differentiation in pay (Shibata, 2000),
the degree to which recent pay
differentiation accurately reﬂects each worker’s performance (e.g. among employees
with the same length of tenure) appears to be still open to question (Japan Management
Association, 2005). Hence, existent empirical evidence and Japanese employment
contexts appear to be unfavourable to the inverted U-shaped relationship between
employee turnover and organizational effectiveness.

It is also important to refer to the Japanese employment context in terms of employee
retirement. Firms can legally set mandatory retirement age in Japan, typically between 60
and 63 years old. As this retirement is mandatory, it is not considered as voluntary
turnover in our study. While this retirement also represents the negative ﬂow of ﬁrm-
speciﬁc human capital, we submit that its negative effect is limited as Japanese ﬁrms can
accurately predict and prepare for it (e.g. succession planning). As a result, Japanese
ﬁrms’ human resources planning will be able to take employee withdrawal due to
mandatory retirement age into account so that they can minimize the negative impact due
to the loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. We also acknowledge that involuntary turnover
might be associated with a loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. However, terminating an
employment relationship is increasingly more difﬁcult in the Japanese employment
context

laws, court decisions, and government

(i.e. employment

Even after

taking the Japanese employment context

into account, a ﬁrm’s
voluntary turnover ratio represents the degree to which a ﬁrm loses its employees’
ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. The higher the voluntary turnover ratio, the greater the
loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital the ﬁrm incurs, and the lower the ﬁrm labour
productivity.

Hypothesis 2: Voluntary turnover

ratio is negatively related to ﬁrm labour

productivity.

When a ﬁrm experiences high employee turnover consistently over time, the ﬁrm’s
average employee tenure will eventually decline. As such,
the ﬁrst hypothesis
concerns the possible impact on organizational effectiveness of the current stock of
ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, which is a result of past employee turnover. In contrast,
the second hypothesis is of a more short-term nature, i.e. whether the current level
of employee turnover is signiﬁcantly related to the current level of organizational
effectiveness.

The central argument of our model is that employee turnover is detrimental to ﬁrm
effectiveness as it involves the depletion of the stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital.
Turnover leads to the outﬂow of human capital, which leads to a decrease in an
organization’s stock of human capital. More precisely, average employee tenure
mediates the relationship between turnover ratio and organizational effectiveness. As we
explained, there are two major reasons why the current level of employee turnover is
related to the current level of organizational effectiveness. First, the high level of current
turnover means the high level of outﬂow of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, which manifests
itself in lower labour productivity at the ﬁrm level. Second, the high level of current
turnover may result
in operational disruption and adverse morale in remaining
employees. Consequently, we expect average employee tenure to partially mediate the
negative relationship between turnover ratio and labour productivity. As the negative
inﬂuences of voluntary employee turnover are not limited to the loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
the negative effects of voluntary turnover ratio on ﬁrm labour
human capital,

productivity will still remain even after the average employee tenure of a ﬁrm is
controlled for.

Hypothesis 3: Average employee tenure partially mediates the relationship between

voluntary turnover ratio and ﬁrm labour productivity.

Method

Data

We selected and analysed two samples for this study. The two samples were drawn from
the same population; i.e., publicly traded ﬁrms in Japan but in different years: 2002 and
2003. The information on ﬁrm average tenure and voluntary turnover ratio was collected
from Toyo Keizai’s Shushoku Shikiho 2005 and 2006. Shushoku Shikiho is an annual
publication for college graduates that are entering the job market. It conducts surveys and
collects information on major ﬁrms in Japan, particularly information related to their
human resource practices (e.g., the number of new hires, wage level, available training
programmes, and organization culture). Although they do not describe how they selected
the ﬁrms they analysed, Shushoku Shikiho 2005 and 2006 include most major publicly
traded ﬁrms, as well as private ﬁrms, in Japan. Shushoku Shikiho 2005 contains
information on 890 public ﬁrms in Japan for the ﬁscal year 2002.1 Likewise, Shushoku
Shikiho 2006 contains the information on 890 public ﬁrms for the ﬁscal year 2003. Our
calculations indicate that the sales ﬁgures of the 891 public ﬁrms in Shushoku Shikiho
2005 and 891 public ﬁrms in Shushoku Shikiho 2006 account for about 70 per cent of all
sales of public ﬁrms in Japan for the ﬁscal years 2002 and 2003.

As participation in the survey was voluntary, ﬁrms could decline to provide some of
the information requested. 465 ﬁrms in Shushoku Shikiho 2005 (52.2 per cent) and 436
ﬁrms in Shushoku Shikiho 2006 (49.9 per cent) provided both turnover ratio and average
employee tenure information. These ﬁgures were higher than the response rates in recent
published studies on human resource management practices in US ﬁrms (e.g. Datta et al.,
2005) and Japanese ﬁrms (e.g. Kato and Morishima, 2003). Firm level information such
as ﬁrm size and ﬁrm performance was obtained from Toyo Keizai’s Japan Company
Handbook, supplemented by each ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial statement. Using ANOVA, we
examined if there were any differences between ﬁrms that reported both turnover ratio
and average employee tenure to Shushoku Shikiho and those that did not. We found that
there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in ﬁrm size measured by the number of
employees; i.e. smaller ﬁrms were more likely to provide turnover and employee tenure
information (p , 0.001 for both the 2002 data and 2003 data). Thus, the results of our
analyses must be interpreted with caution as they may suffer from the problem of range
restriction. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in labour productivity
between ﬁrms that reported both their turnover ratio and average employee tenure and
those that did not.

After removing ﬁrms with missing information necessary to our empirical analysis,
our ﬁnal sample consists of 330 ﬁrms in the 2002 data set and 301 ﬁrms in the 2003 data
set. Sample size was reduced primarily due to the missing wage level information, which
was one of the key control variables in our analyses. Similar to turnover information,
wage level information was drawn from Shushoku Shikiho and many ﬁrms did not
provide their wage level information.2 Firms in our sample belonged to various industries
in Japan such as agriculture, electrical machinery, communications, transportation
equipments, wholesale and services. Firms in the ﬁnancial industries (e.g. banks,
securities, insurance) were not included (although they appear in Shushoku Shikiho),

because the Japan Company Handbook did not report ﬁrm sales for these industries, and
thus we were unable to calculate key variables in our analyses (i.e. labour productivity
and sales growth).

Measures

Dependent variable Following prior strategic human resource management studies
(e.g. Datta et al., 2005; Huselid, 1995), ﬁrm labour productivity was calculated by
dividing ﬁrm sales by the number of employees. Natural logarithm was applied.

Independent variables Firm level average employee tenure was measured in terms of
years. Employee tenure information was taken from the end of the ﬁscal years 2002 and
2003. The ﬁrm level voluntary turnover ratio was reported by ﬁrms using the formula
provided by Shushoku Shikiho. This formula required ﬁrms to divide the number of
voluntary departures during each of the ﬁscal years by the number of employees at the
beginning of the ﬁscal year (i.e. April 2002 and April 2003, respectively). The number of
employees that retired due to mandatory retirement was not included in voluntary
turnover as we have already noted.

Control variables Drawing upon prior relevant studies, we included several control
variables. Firm size was controlled for as larger ﬁrms may have more resources enabling
them to be more competitive and productive (Collins and Clark, 2003). We used the
natural logarithm of a ﬁrm’s number of employees. We also controlled for capital –
labour ratio (Kato and Morishima, 2003). It represents the difference in the nature of
work (i.e. labour intensive or not). Capital – labour ratio was calculated by dividing ﬁrm
ﬁxed assets by the number of employees. Natural logarithm was applied to this variable.
Our model also included the ratio of female workers to male workers ( female ratio). In
Japan, male workers are more likely to have a college degree than female workers,
although this difference is getting narrower. The difference in the composition of male
and female workers may inﬂuence labour productivity through the difference in general
human capital. Whether a ﬁrm is unionized or not (unionized) was controlled for insofar
as a labour union may affect employee turnover and productivity through traditional
union representation and employee involvement mechanisms. We also controlled for
ﬁrm sales growth as it was found to be related to labour productivity by prior strategic
human resource management studies (e.g. Datta et al., 2005). Following the measure
used in these studies, sales growth in the past three years (i.e. from 1998 to 2001 and from
1999 to 2002, respectively) was calculated.

We also controlled for ﬁrm wage level. This study proposed that voluntary turnover
would negatively inﬂuence ﬁrm labour productivity. In order to better understand this
relationship, the possible inﬂuence of ﬁrm human resource management practices on
labour productivity needs to be controlled for. Research has reported that pay system
directly inﬂuence ﬁrm performance (e.g. Gomez-Mejia and Balkin, 1992), and thus we
added a wage variable to our equation. In Shushoku Shikiho, ﬁrms were requested to
provide the monthly wage level (expected level, labelled ‘model wage’ in Shushoku
Shikiho) at three different stages of employee career: 25 years old, 30 years old, and 35
years old. This study used the wage level for 30-year-old employees because employing
this variable yielded the largest sample size. The wage level for 30 year old employees
was highly correlated with those for 25 year old (r ¼ 0.63 in 2002 and 0.70 in 2003) and
35 year old (r ¼ 0.81 in 2002 and 0.82 in 2003). Natural logarithm was applied.3


1848 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

In order to address the Japanese contexts, we included a dummy variable that indicates
whether a ﬁrm had an early retirement programme. Some Japanese ﬁrms use early
retirement programmes when they experience labour surplus in order to reduce workers
to the optimal level. Theoretically, turnover based on early retirement programmes
counts as voluntary turnover; however, its inﬂuence on ﬁrm productivity may be less
detrimental insofar as it meets the ﬁrm’s human resources planning needs. For this
reason, we decided to control for an early retirement programme. Shushoku Shikiho
indicates whether a given ﬁrm had an early retirement programme. We created a dummy
variable; 1 if the ﬁrm had an early retirement programme and 0 if not. We also created an
interaction term between early retirement and turnover ratio as the expected negative
inﬂuence of turnover on labour productivity may be different between ﬁrms that adopted
an early retirement programme and those that did not.

Finally we controlled for industry in our analyses. The differences in the technology
and work structure employed across various industries inﬂuence labour productivity and
other organization performance measures. Industry membership was based on Toyo
Keizai’s Japan Company Handbook, which classiﬁed public ﬁrms in Japan into 33
industry segments. We created industry dummy variables.

Analytic approach

In order to test our hypotheses, we used ordinary least square models.4 We hypothesized
that average employee tenure partially mediates the relationship between voluntary
turnover ratio and ﬁrm performance. To test
this mediation effect, we followed
the procedure suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986). We ﬁrst checked to see if the
independent variable (i.e. voluntary turnover ratio) is related to the mediator (i.e. average
employee tenure). We then separately regressed these two variables on the dependent
variable (i.e. labour productivity). In order to verify the mediation effect, both the
independent and mediator variables should be related to the dependent variable in each
regression. Finally, we ran a regression in which both the independent variable and
mediator were included. If the effect of the independent variable is still signiﬁcant but its
effect size and signiﬁcance level decrease, the effect of the independent variable is
partially mediated by the mediator. In case the relationship between the independent
variable and the dependent variable becomes insigniﬁcant in the full model, their
relationship is fully mediated by the mediator. As we hypothesized that employee tenure
would partially mediate the relationship between turnover ratio and labour productivity,
we expected employee turnover ratio to remain still signiﬁcant even in the model that
included both average employee tenure and turnover ratio.

We regressed voluntary turnover ratio and average employee tenure in periodt
(i.e. ﬁscal years 2002 and 2002) on labour productivity in the same time periodt (i.e.,
ﬁscal years 2002 and 2003) rather than time periodt þ 1 (i.e. ﬁscal years 2003 and 2004).
This was based on the notion that voluntary turnover immediately inﬂuences the
performance of human resources, whereas it may take some time for the negative
inﬂuence to appear in the form of the deterioration of ﬁnancial performance (Kacmar
et al., 2006). We took a one-year lag for other ﬁrm level control variables.

One might want to control for prior ﬁrm labour productivity in order to address the
reverse causality problem (i.e. labour productivity level inﬂuences employee turnover
decisions). However, we decided not to do this as ﬁrm labour productivity was quite
stable. In our sample, the correlation between labour productivity in one year and that of
the prior year reached 0.99. We expect that our other independent variables will account
for the difference between ﬁrms with regard to this stable labour productivity, and thus


Yanadori and Kato: Average employee tenure, voluntary . . . productivity

1849

adding a prior ﬁrm productivity variable would overcontrol (Gerhart and Milkovich,
1990). Likewise, as labour productivity exhibits signiﬁcant stability, taking a lag to
examine temporal sequence (i.e. regressing turnover ratio in year t on productivity in year
t þ 1) would not make much difference.

Results

Table 1 contains a summary of descriptive statistics, along with their intercorrelations.
The lower left values are correlations of the variables in the 2002 data set (i.e. voluntary
turnover ratio and average employee tenure in 2002), and the upper right values are
correlations in the 2003 data set (i.e. voluntary turnover ratio and average employee
tenure in 2003). As we expected, voluntary turnover ratio was negatively related to
employee tenure in both data sets (r ¼ 2 0.53 and 2 0.48, p , 0.001 for both). This
satisﬁed one of the conditions of expected mediation effect.

Table 2 reports the results of the analyses of ﬁrm labour productivity in 2002 and
2003. We used stepwise regression analyses to examine the hypothesized mediation
effect. The ﬁrst columns, labelled Step 1, are the results of the regression using only
control variables. The second columns, labelled Step 2, are the results of the analyses that
regressed average employee tenure on ﬁrm labour productivity (i.e. mediator and
dependent variable). The columns in Step 3 are the results of the analyses that regressed
voluntary turnover ratio on ﬁrm labour productivity (i.e. independent variable and
dependent variable). The early retirement variable and the interaction between early
retirement and turnover ratio were included as well. The columns in Step 4 are the results
of the full models that regressed voluntary turnover ratio and average employee tenure on
ﬁrm labour productivity (i.e. independent variable, mediator, and independent variable)
with other control variables. The full models indicate that adding voluntary turnover and
average employee tenure variables signiﬁcantly improved the models, irrespective of
data years.

In the regression analyses of ﬁrm labour productivity, the results of the Step 2 columns
show that a ﬁrm’s average employee tenure was positively related to its labour
productivity (b ¼ 0.028, p , 0.01 in 2002 and b ¼ 0.039, p , 0.001 in 2003). These
coefﬁcients remained signiﬁcant even in the full models (Step 4). This supports
Hypothesis 1, which stated that average employee tenure is positively related to ﬁrm
labour productivity. As is shown in the Step 3 columns of Table 3, average employee
turnover was negatively related to ﬁrm labour productivity (b ¼ 2 0.028, p , 0.01 in
2002, b ¼ 2 0.021, p , 0.01 in 2003) and the negative relationships were highly
signiﬁcant. As such, our evidence supports Hypotheses 2, i.e. turnover ratio is negatively
related to ﬁrm labour productivity.

Then we turned to the proposed mediation effects of average employee tenure on the
relationship between turnover ratio and ﬁrm labour productivity. In the 2002 data set, the
coefﬁcient of the voluntary turnover ratio decreased from 2 0.028 to 2 0.020, with
the signiﬁcance level also decreasing (from p , 0.01 to p , 0.05). The fact that the
effect of the voluntary turnover ratio was still signiﬁcant in Step 4 indicates that average
employee tenure partially mediated the relationship between the voluntary turnover ratio
and ﬁrm labour productivity. In the analyses that used the 2003 data set, the effect of the
voluntary turnover ratio became insigniﬁcant in Step 4 (from p , 0.001 to p ¼ 0.15).
The insigniﬁcant effect of turnover ratio in the full model suggests that average employee

labour productivity. The analysis of the 2002 data support this hypothesis, whereas
the analysis of the 2003 data do not. While our results are inconclusive concerning the
degree of mediation, our analyses conﬁrm that average employee tenure did mediate
the relationship between turnover ratio and ﬁrm labour productivity.

As we did not control for prior ﬁrm labour productivity, the potential reverse causality
problem remains unresolved. To address this problem, we tested if the reverse causal
relationship exists in such a way that ﬁrm labour productivity inﬂuences subsequent ﬁrm
turnover ratio. Essentially, we ran a model in which turnover was the dependent variable
and labour productivity was the independent variable. We took a one-year lag for labour
productivity and average employee tenure as well as other ﬁrm-level variables except for
ﬁrm wage level. Similar to the previous analysis, we ran this analysis using two samples:
the 2002 sample and the 2003 sample. The 2002 sample consists of 284 ﬁrms and the
latter consists of 288 ﬁrms.

Discussion

This study provides evidence that turnover ratio is negatively related to organization
effectiveness. While this claim has already been supported by a few empirical studies,
virtually all of these studies analysed US ﬁrms. We believe it is important to study ﬁrms in
other countries with different employment contexts to broaden our knowledge in the
management ﬁeld (Kirkman and Law, 2005). Regardless of the differences in employment
the negative relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational
contexts,

effectiveness holds in Japan as well. In addition, the samples in our study consist of ﬁrms
from various industries. Our results indicate that the negative relationship may be
universal across industries.

In delineating the inﬂuence of voluntary turnover ratio on ﬁrm labour productivity, we
have drawn upon human capital theory (Becker, 1975). Particularly we have focused on
the role of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. Voluntary turnover involves reduction in the
stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, which can be acquired through the accumulation of
ﬁrm-speciﬁc training and experience in the focal ﬁrms. As a result, a higher voluntary
turnover ratio leads to a greater outﬂow of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. As ﬁrm-speciﬁc
human capital contributes to labour productivity, voluntary turnover is related to a
decrease in organizational effectiveness through the loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital.
Our analyses support this proposition. Average employee tenure, which represents the
ﬁrm’s stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, is positively related to labour productivity.
Average employee tenure mediates the negative relationship between voluntary turnover
ratio and ﬁrm labour productivity.

While our analyses showed that turnover ratio is negatively associated with labour
productivity, we were unable to establish a causal relationship in which turnover ratio
inﬂuences labour productivity. In order to avoid overcontrol, we did not include prior
labour productivity in the model. This analytical approach may undermine our argument
that turnover inﬂuences organization performance. Indeed, our additional analyses
indicated the possibility that labour productivity impacts turnover.

We do not believe, however, that the negative relationship between turnover ratio and
ﬁrm labour productivity is attributable entirely to the inﬂuence of labour productivity on
turnover ratio. Our ﬁndings are consistent with human capital
theory. Given the
increasing empirical evidence that supports the claims of human capital theory with
regard to the contributions of human resources on organizational effectiveness (e.g. Hitt
et al., 2001; Pennings et al., 1998), it is certainly plausible to interpret our ﬁndings as
evidence suggesting the negative impact of turnover on organizational effectiveness. The
potential effect of organization performance on turnover intention (e.g. Scheneider et al.,
2003; Shaw et al., 2005a) appears to be still in the stage of inference and has yet to be
shaped into a compelling theory.

We speculate that there may be a reciprocal relationship between turnover ratio and
organizational effectiveness (Shaw et al., 2005a). We may be able to understand better
the relationship between turnover ratio and organization performance by looking at its
longitudinal pattern. The problem of establishing a causal relationship is also true of
strategic human resource management research (Wall and Wood, 2005; Wright et al.,
2005). Beyond developing a rigorous research model (Shaw et al., 2005a), researchers
may need to explore a theory that explains how employees react to ﬁrm performance.
Granted that voluntary turnover is detrimental to ﬁrm performance, an important
implication of our ﬁndings is that if a ﬁrm’s human resource practices can successfully
reduce the voluntary turnover of its employees, the ﬁrm will be able to achieve higher
labour productivity. The linkage between human resource practices and employee
turnover is much closer than that between human resource practices and labour
productivity, and thus human resource managers are better able to demonstrate their
contributions to their organizations. Research shows that various human resource
practices have an inﬂuence on employee voluntary turnover decisions (e.g. Barber and
Bretz, 2000; Batt, 2002; Huselid, 1995). By offering the evidence that voluntary turnover
ratio is negatively related to organizational effectiveness, we provide some support for
the claim that human resource practices (and thus human resource management
functions) do matter in improving organizational effectiveness.


1854 The International Journal of Human Resource Management

In this context, the result we obtained that ﬁrm wage level had a limited inﬂuence on
voluntary turnover was somewhat intriguing. Although this might be simply due to the
crude nature of our wage variable (i.e. wage level for 30-year-old employees may not be
a good representation of the ﬁrm’s wage level), it might alternatively mean that an
employee’s turnover decisions are less likely to be affected by wage level relative to
other ﬁrms in Japan. In the Japanese context, where the long-term employment
relationship is assumed, once hired, employees may pay less attention to external equity
(i.e. how other ﬁrms pay their employees) than internal equity (how my ﬁrm pays my
colleagues). Admittedly this study’s effort
for ﬁrm human resource
management practices left room for improvement. Incorporating a measure that more
accurately captures Japanese ﬁrms’ human resource management practices would
reinforce our argument.

to control

At the outset, we stated that the negative relationship between voluntary turnover and
ﬁrm performance reported in the US also holds in Japan; however, this relationship may
be even more relevant to Japanese ﬁrms, which typically leverage ﬁrm-speciﬁc human
capital (Jacoby, 2005). With the assumption that their employees will stay in their
organizations, Japanese ﬁrms have offered a variety of programmes that are conductive
to increasing employees’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital (e.g. OJT, in-house training) as
well as general human capital (e.g. ﬁnancial support for the MBA programmes in US or
Europe). The greater the ﬁrms’ investment in their employees’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc human
capital, the greater the loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital involved with voluntary
turnover, and the more serious the negative impact of voluntary turnover on ﬁrm labour
productivity. Thus, although the negative relationship has been observed both in US and
Japan, where ﬁrms put different levels of emphasis on ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, it is
still possible that the degree to which voluntary turnover harms ﬁrm performance may
vary depending on the employment context or the ﬁrm’s human resource management.
Beyond the direct inﬂuence of human resource management practices, their moderating
role on the relationship between voluntary turnover and ﬁrm performance needs to be
further explored. In a similar vein, the relationship between turnover ratio and ﬁrm labour
productivity may later take inverted U-shaped in Japan, if ﬁrms move toward pay-for-
performance systems.

It is also important to note that this study focuses on ﬁrm labour productivity. It does
not examine the relationship between turnover ratio and ﬁnancial performance (e.g.
ROA, stock returns). The link between turnover and ﬁnancial performance is less
straightforward since ﬁnancial performance measures are inﬂuenced by many other
factors (notably the organization’s pay systems). Generally ﬁrms offer better pay to
employees with greater human capital and this is one of the reasons that employee tenure
is generally related to their pay level. Theoretically, ﬁrms are able to beneﬁt from their
employees’ ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital by paying their employees less than their actual
productivity but more than they would be able to receive at other ﬁrms. However, if ﬁrms
offer pay that is above the level of their employees’ actual productivity, the cost of
retaining even productive employees may surpass the beneﬁts, and hence ﬁrms with
higher stock of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital are more productive yet less proﬁtable. In
other words, a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance deteriorates when it retains employees with
great ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital if they are overrewarded. Efﬁciency wage theory
claims that wage levels higher than the market pay level improve the quality of
employees and motivate them to work hard (Lazear, 1998). While empirical evidence
supports this claim, evidence is mixed as to whether higher pay levels are associated with
better ﬁnancial performance. Evidently efﬁciency wages could cost more to ﬁrms and
balancing these costs and beneﬁts is not easy (Milkovich and Newman, 2005).


Yanadori and Kato: Average employee tenure, voluntary . . . productivity

1855

This study has several limitations. First, as we have already noted, the information on
mandatory retirement age has not been included in our analyses. Although we think that
the negative inﬂuence of mandatory retirement is far smaller than that of voluntary
turnover, its effect might not be negligible. Second, we looked at average employee
tenure but the distribution of employee tenure within ﬁrms may inﬂuence ﬁrm labour
productivity. More speciﬁcally, the diversity in terms of tenure may be related to
labour productivity. Third, this study focused on ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital but did not
sufﬁciently control for general human capital. To bolster the argument that human capital
theory is a primary theory that accounts for the negative inﬂuence of employee turnover
on organizational effectiveness, future researchers may want to incorporate the theory of
general human capital.

Regardless of these problems, our study makes a signiﬁcant contribution to human
resource management studies by providing evidence that a ﬁrm’s voluntary turnover
ratio is negatively related to a ﬁrm’s performance. Building on our results, strategic
human resource management studies must try to further understand the organizational
performance effects of a ﬁrm’s human resource management practices. Further theory
development, as well as more rigorous research settings, will be necessary to understand
the causal relationship between turnover ratio and organization performance.

Notes

1. In Japan, ﬁscal years start in April and end in March of the following years. For instance, the

ﬁscal year 2002 starts in April 2002 and ends in March 2003.
2. Dropping the wage variable from the analysis would substantially improve our sample size
(N ¼ 412 in 2002 and N ¼ 394 in 2003). We ran analyses using these larger samples (thus,
without the wage variable). The results were essentially the same as our original results.

3. We also ran analyses using ﬁrm wage level relative to industry mean (standardized value). The

results did not change.

4. We also ran random effects models that assumed the effects of average employee tenure and
voluntary turnover ratio on ﬁrm labour productivity would vary across industries (i.e., industry
as a random effect). Our preliminary analyses failed to support this assumption.

5. Unfortunately, like in the case of most empirical studies in the ﬁeld, we were unable to carry out
IV estimation to address this potential endogeneity problem of ﬁrm voluntary turnover due to the
lack of reliable instruments that account for voluntary turnover yet unrelated to ﬁrm labour
productivity.
