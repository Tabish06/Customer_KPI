Abstract
Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the
effects of a pro-environmental corporate message on pro-
spective applicants’ attitudes toward a ﬁctitious hiring
organization. Drawing from signaling theory, we hypoth-
esized that an environmental message on the organization’s
recruitment website would increase prospective applicants’
perceptions of organizational prestige, which would then
increase job pursuit
intentions. Personal environmental
attitudes were also examined as a possible moderator.
Design/Methodology/Approach Participants
(N = 183)
viewed a web site printout that either did or did not contain
a message indicating the organization’s environmental
support. Participants rated their attitudes toward the envi-
ronment, perceptions of the organization, and job pursuit
intentions.
Findings Findings demonstrated that the environmental
support message positively affected job pursuit intentions;
further, this effect was mediated by perceptions of the
organization’s reputation. Contrary to the person–organi-
zation ﬁt perspective, the message’s effects on job pursuit
intentions were not contingent upon the participant’s own
environmental stance.
Implications These ﬁndings highlight the importance of
corporate social performance as a source of information for
a variety of job seekers. Even relatively small amounts of
information regarding corporate social performance can

positively affect an organization’s reputation and recruit-
ment efforts.
Originality/Value
In general, this research contributes to
the growing body of literature on corporate social respon-
sibility. It is the ﬁrst study to test whether the effects of
pro-environmental
recruiting messages on job pursuit
intentions depend upon an applicant’s personal environ-
mental stance. In addition, this is the ﬁrst study to dem-
onstrate reputation’s meditational role in the effects of
corporate social responsibility on recruitment efforts.

Introduction

Over the years, recruitment research has focused on the
characteristics of traditional sources of recruitment infor-
mation (e.g., newspaper advertisements and recruiters) to
that affect prospective employees’
identify variables
impressions of recruitment materials,
their reactions to
organizations, and their willingness to pursue employment
with a hiring organization. Today, the Internet provides a
common medium for relaying information to potential
applicants, yet little is known about the manner in which
company web sites
inﬂuence prospective employees.
Compared with job advertisements and even recruitment
brochures, web sites often give companies more advertis-
ing space, particularly because layers or levels of infor-
mation can be offered to job seekers who want detail on a
particular topic of interest. When creating their organiza-
tional web sites, companies must give serious consideration
to how they want to portray themselves. Lately, it has

123

become increasingly common for organizations to incor-
porate messages concerning their company values. For
instance, organizations may communicate values such as
diversity, the environment, or work–life balance.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the
effects of a pro-environmental message embedded in the
recruitment section of an organizational web site. We
examined whether such a message increases the willing-
ness of an individual to pursue employment with a hiring
organization. Drawing from a person–organization (P–O)
ﬁt perspective, we then investigated whether prospective
applicants’ personal attitudes toward the environment
moderated this effect. Lastly, we tested a mediator sug-
gested by signaling theory. In particular, we examined
whether views of the prospective employer’s reputation
underlie the effects of a pro-environment message on job
pursuit intentions.

Corporate Social Performance

Closely tied to an organization’s image and reputation is its
corporate social performance. Corporate social perfor-
that addresses an organization’s
mance is a construct
responsibilities to multiple stakeholders,
including its
employees and the greater community. This type of per-
formance is in addition to an organization’s responsibilities
to its economic stakeholders (Clarkson 1995; Donaldson
and Preston 1995; Turban and Greening 1997). A com-
pany’s social policies and programs reﬂect its social per-
formance and can include policies pertaining to community
relations, treatment of women and minorities, employee
relations, and treatment of the environment. The social
performance of a company can inﬂuence prospective
applicants’ perceptions of an organization’s image and
their initial attraction to that organization by denoting
certain values and norms (Fombrun and Shanley 1990;
Greening and Turban 2000; Rynes 1991). Additionally,
perceptions of corporate social responsibility have been
shown to relate to workers’ organizational commitment
(Brammer et al. 2007).

During recent years, it has become commonplace for
large organizations to relay information concerning their
social performance (Aiman-Smith et al. 2001; Poe and
Courter 1995). Companies such as IBM, General Motors,
and Microsoft
include information in their recruitment
materials that emphasizes their philanthropic and envi-
ronmental initiatives. This information can be communi-
cated via the Internet. For example, by browsing the
corporate web sites of Fortune 500 organizations such as
GM, Coca-Cola, Dupont, and Lucent, one can obtain clear
statements about their environmental policies with links to
reports on their environmental activity (Aiman-Smith et al.
2001). With the growth of Internet recruiting, company

123

web sites are an important medium for advertising envi-
ronmental support and other social performance efforts to
customers, investors, and prospective employees.

Research has demonstrated the signiﬁcant effects of an
organization’s corporate social performance on applicant
attraction. Turban and Greening (1997) found that com-
panies with higher corporate social performance ratings
had more positive reputations. They examined corporate
social performance as a multidimensional construct. Cor-
porate social performance dimensions and their relation-
ships to organizational reputation included: community
relations (r = .16), employee relations (r = .20), envi-
ronment (r = .20), product quality (r = .21), and treatment
of women and minorities (r = .15). Treatment of women
and minorities was the only corporate social performance
variable that was not signiﬁcantly related to reputation.
Companies with higher corporate social performance rat-
ings were also more attractive for employers than those
with lower ratings. Community relations, employee rela-
tions, and product quality were signiﬁcantly related to
attractiveness with correlations ranging from .16 to .25.
Similarly, Brammer and Pavelin (2006) found in a survey
of large global ﬁrms that social performance was one of the
several factors that determined the ﬁrm’s reputation. Based
on these ﬁndings, it seems clear that an organization’s
positive corporate social performance can provide a com-
petitive advantage in attracting applicants.

A study by Aiman-Smith et al. (2001) compared two
types of corporate social performance, ecological ratings
and lay-off policy, along with pay and promotional oppor-
tunity in order to determine their relative importance in
predicting attractiveness. The strongest predictor of orga-
nizational attractiveness was ecological rating (b = .34,
p \ .001), thus indicating that an organization’s ecological
practices play a major role in how attractive applicants
deem the organization. Ecological rating was also a sig-
intentions (b = .19,
niﬁcant predictor of
p \ .001). This ﬁnding was supported by past research that
has shown that an organization’s stance on the environment
affects applicants’ job pursuit intentions (Bauer and Aiman-
Smith 1996). In general, corporate social performance
appears to be a valuable predictor of initial recruiting out-
comes, but deserves further examination in order to explain
the underlying mechanisms of these relationships.

job pursuit

P–O Fit: Personal Environmental Stance as a Moderator

One might reason that prospective applicants who per-
sonally value the environment will be particularly inﬂu-
enced by a pro-environment message posted by a hiring
organization. This rationale is consistent with the person–
organization (P–O) ﬁt perspective, which suggests that
individuals will be most attracted to organizations that have


J Bus Psychol (2009) 24:341–350

343

cultures congruent with their own set of values. Prospective
applicants interpret the characteristics of the organization
in light of their own needs and values, thus applicants’
perceived ﬁt is a result of their appraisal of the interaction
between their personal values and needs and the charac-
teristics of the organization (Chapman et al. 2005; Kristof
1996).

Prior research has provided support for the link between
P–O ﬁt and recruiting outcomes. A meta-analysis by
Chapman et al. (2005) found P–O ﬁt to be a signiﬁcant
predictor of job pursuit intentions (q = .62). This rela-
tionship outweighed a number of other predictors including
organization and recruiter characteristics. In addition to job
pursuit intentions, P–O ﬁt was correlated with organization
attraction (r = .40). Similar ﬁndings were reported in a
meta-analysis by Kristof-Brown et al. (2005), who found a
correlation of .46 between P–O ﬁt and organizational
attraction. Although informative,
these meta-analytic
ﬁndings do not address the reasons why P–O ﬁt affects
recruiting outcomes.

In an effort to further understand the inﬂuence of P–O ﬁt
on organizational recruitment, research regarding con-
sumer preferences can be explored. Such work has exam-
ined whether the success of environmental advertising is
dependent on a consumer’s personal environmental values.
A study by Follows and Jobber (2000) did not support the
proposition that environmental value congruence between
an individual and an organization advertising a product
necessarily increases the probability that the individual will
engage in environmentally responsible purchasing behav-
ior. In this case, the individual consequences of purchasing
a product, such as convenience, limited availability, and
product quality, outweighed the positive environmental
consequences. Even if an individual valued the environ-
ment, the individual consequences decreased the proba-
bility of environmentally responsible purchasing behavior
(b = -0.63, p \ .05).

Moving beyond consumer

research, studies in the
employment domain have looked at prospective applicants’
attitudes toward the environment. Bauer and Aiman-Smith
(1996) examined job seekers’ personal environmental
attitudes as well as the effect of a pro-environment message
on the willingness to pursue employment with an organi-
zation. Participants in this study were randomly assigned to
view the brochure of an environmentally friendly or neutral
organization. It was hypothesized that

attraction to the organization, their intentions to pursue
employment, and their willingness to accept a job offer
from the hiring organization. The ﬁndings indicated that
job applicants were more likely to pursue employment

(b = .31,
p \ .001) from pro-environment organizations. However,

Rather,

whether a pro-environment message attracted prospective
applicants regardless of
their personal environmental
stance, and second to investigate if a pro-environmental
personal stance would increase overall attraction to an
organization. It is of interest to examine these variables in a
different manner, by testing whether the effects of pro-
environmental recruiting messages on job pursuit inten-
tions are contingent upon an applicant’s personal envi-
ronmental stance.

In short, although the literature has laid a foundation for
our ﬁrst hypothesis, no prior research has looked at whether
a job seeker’s personal environmental stance moderates the
effect that a company’s pro-environmental web site may
have on job pursuit intentions.

Hypothesis 1 An organization’s pro-environment mes-
sage will affect the job pursuit intentions of prospective
employees who are relatively supportive of the environ-
ment more than it affects the preferences of those who are
relatively unsupportive of the environment.

Signaling Theory: Organizational Reputation
as a Mediator

In addition to understanding which types of people are
most likely to be inﬂuenced by environmental messages, it
is also important to consider the mechanisms underlying
the effect of pro-environment messages on prospective
applicants. Although the reasons for the linkage between
organizational concern for the environment and applicant
attraction remain untested,
the literature offers some
insights concerning the psychological processes mediating
this effect. Signaling theory provides a basis for under-
standing the phenomenon. Because selection procedures
are a critical source of information for applicants,
the
image created by a selection procedure is believed to affect
an organization’s ability to attract candidates (Mecan et al.
1994; Richman-Hirsch et al. 2000; Smither et al. 1993).
Signaling theory applies this logic to the recruitment
domain. It asserts that job seekers form perceptions of
prospective employers based on incomplete information
they encounter during the job search process, such as
recruiters and recruitment brochures (Rynes and Miller
1983). In effect, people sense that recruiters and other
information gleaned during the job search process provide
a signal of what it would be like to work for the organi-
zation under consideration. The signaling process is most
likely to occur when applicants must make employment
decisions based on little information about hiring organi-
zations (Rynes et al. 1991), which is frequently the case
when people are searching for jobs online. According to

123


344

J Bus Psychol (2009) 24:341–350

Turban and Greening (1997), ‘‘an organization’s social
policies and programs may attract potential applicants by
serving as a signal of working conditions in the organiza-
tion’’ (p. 659). In essence, an employee may form the belief
that because an organization cares for the environment, it
will care for its employees as well.

A prospective employer’s reputation also appears to be
involved in this process. Several authors have suggested
that a company’s willingness to support the environment
inﬂuences job seekers’ perceptions of the organization’s
reputation (Brammer and Millington 2005; Lewis 2003;
Turban and Greening 1997). Reputation, in turn, signals
important job attributes (Cable and Turban 2003).

Reputation can also affect the pride that individuals
expect from organizational membership. Social identity
theory states that individuals seek to identify themselves
through the groups in which they can claim membership
(Tajfel and Turner 1986). An individual working for an
organization perceived as prestigious can expect to feel
personal pride as a result. With regard to environmental
issues, workers can point to their organization’s environ-
mental policies as evidence that they are also environmen-
tally responsible. Therefore, job seekers’ perceptions of an
organization’s prestige and social responsibility can inﬂu-
ence their job pursuit intentions (Cable and Turban 2003).
In summary, the results of past research collectively
the following mediated model, which awaits

suggest
empirical investigation.

Hypothesis 2
Perceptions of an organization’s reputa-
tion will mediate the effect of a pro-environment message
on prospective applicants’ job pursuit intentions.

Method

Participants

universities in the southeastern United States. The research
assistants were given the opportunity to identify individu-
als interested in participating (e.g., friends, classmates, and
research volunteers fulﬁlling course research require-
ments). The research assistants administered the study
materials in person at various locations, based on room
availability and participant locale.

Design and Procedure

Participants were asked to imagine themselves as active job
seekers while completing a task that required them to
review a printout of a ﬁctitious organizational web site,
‘‘RLA, Inc.’’ Next, the participants answered survey ques-
tions about themselves and rated their attitudes concerning
employment with the organization featured on the web site
printout. Measured variables included: participants’ atti-
tudes toward the environment, perceptions of the organiza-
tion’s reputation, job pursuit intentions, and perceptions of
the organization’s support toward the environment.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
conditions corresponding to two different versions of the
fabricated web site printout. The content and format of
these single-page printouts were adapted from existing
employment web sites and created for the purpose of this
study. One printout included a pro-environment message in
the form of a recycling symbol (see Fig. 1), whereas the
second printout did not contain the symbol (see Fig. 2).
The pro-environment web site also prominently featured
the statement, ‘‘RLA Supports the Environment,’’ along
with a link which presumably led to additional information
about RLA’s environmental programs. Both printouts
alluded to a host of openings for management positions at
the ﬁctitious organization. With the exception of
the
experimental manipulation described above, the two web
sites contained identical layouts and text.

A total of 264 individuals participated in the study. Par-
ticipants who identiﬁed themselves as freshmen were
eliminated from the ﬁnal sample, based on the assumption
that freshmen were unlikely to be entering the job market
in the near future. This left 183 eligible participants. The
sample was comprised of 36.6% sophomores, 32.2%
juniors, 30.1% seniors, and 1.1% graduate students.
Approximately 58.5% of the participants were female, and
the mean age was 21.1 (SD = 2.56). The ethnicity of the
sample was as follows: 59.6% Caucasian; 26.2% African
American; 6.6% Asian; 4.4% Hispanic; 0.5% American
Indian; 2.2% Mixed with parents from two different
groups; and 0.5% who self-identiﬁed as ‘‘Other.’’

Participants were identiﬁed by undergraduate and
graduate research assistants attending two large public

Measures

Two questionnaires were presented after participants had
the opportunity to review the web site printout. The par-
ticipant questionnaire was administered ﬁrst and included
demographic measures and items assessing participants’
personal attitudes toward the environment. These were
questions from Dunlap and Van Liere (1978) New Envi-
ronmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale, published in 1978 and
revised by Dunlap et al. (2000). This 15-item measure
(alpha = .76) used a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree) scale to assess respondents’ views of items such as
‘‘When humans interfere with nature it often produces
disastrous consequences.’’ Half of the items were nega-
tively worded and reverse scored after data entry. Higher

toward the

The organizational questionnaire was developed by
Highhouse et al. (2003). This measure used a 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale to assess both job
pursuit intentions (5 items, alpha = .81) and participants’
views of the organization’s prestige (5 items, alpha = .76).
Responses to each subscale were averaged; therefore, both
job pursuit intentions and prestige could range between 1 and
5, with higher scores representing higher levels of the con-
structs under investigation. A sample job pursuit question
includes: ‘‘I would make RLA, Inc. one of my ﬁrst choices as
an employer.’’ Example prestige items are ‘‘Employees are

probably proud to say they work at RLA, Inc.,’’ ‘‘This is a
reputable company to work for,’’ and ‘‘RLA, Inc. probably
has a reputation as being an excellent employer.’’ Although
the authors of these items labeled this an ‘‘organizational
prestige’’ scale, the items appear to assess what is commonly
viewed as ‘‘reputation’’ in the literature pertaining to the
present study. We therefore used Highhouse et al.’s (2003)
prestige scale to operationalize reputation.

Finally, four items (alpha = .83) were included as a
manipulation check. These items asked participants to use
a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale to rate
their agreement with statements such as ‘‘Valuing the
environment is a top priority of RLA, Inc.’’ Responses to

the four items were averaged; therefore, perceptions of
RLA, Inc.’s environmental stance could range between
1 and 5, where high scores represented assured beliefs that
RLA, Inc. was indeed dedicated to supporting the envi-
ronment. Statistical analysis conﬁrmed that the manipula-
tion was successful (see Table 1).

and the prospective employee’s job pursuit intentions. To
test this hypothesis, linear regression was used. All vari-
ables of interest were ﬁrst centered, which reduced the
multicollinearity problem that is often encountered when
entering an interaction term into a regression analysis
(Aiken and West 1991). The results from the moderation
analysis are presented in Table 3.

As shown in Tables 1 and 3, the main effect of the pro-
environmental message was signiﬁcant, such that partici-
pants who saw the pro-environmental message were
especially inclined to indicate willingness to pursue
employment with the company. However, neither the main
effect of personal environmental stance was signiﬁcant, nor
was the interaction between personal environmental stance
and the pro-environmental message (see Table 3). Thus,
Hypothesis 1 was not supported.

Hypothesis 2 stated that the effect of the pro-environ-
mental message would be mediated by perceptions of the
organization’s reputation. Following the method presented
by Baron and Kenny (1986), a set of linear regression
equations was used to determine whether (a) the indepen-
dent variable (message) is related to the outcome (job
pursuit), (b) the mediator (reputation) is related to the
outcome variable (job pursuit), and (c), the independent
variable (message) is related to the mediator (reputation).
Finally, for mediation to be established, the effect of the
independent variable should be reduced or eliminated when
the mediator is introduced into the regression equation. The
result of this set of analyses supports a mediated model.
First, the pro-environmental message was found to predict
job pursuit
the

intentions (B = .18, p = .02). Second,

The ﬁndings of the present study provide insights into the
manner in which organizational web sites inﬂuence pro-
spective applicants’
job pursuit attitudes. Overall, an
environmental message posted on a recruitment web site
increased job pursuit intentions. However, contrary to our
ﬁrst hypothesis, the effect of the environmental message on
job pursuit intentions was not moderated by the applicant’s
personal environmental stance. This is consistent with
recent research regarding consumer preferences, which has
demonstrated that the success of environmental advertising
is not solely dependent on the consumer’s personal envi-
ronmental values (Follows and Jobber 2000). The person–
organization ﬁt model does not appear to explain the
effects of environmental advertising on job seekers. The
decision to pursue employment with an environmentally
responsible company may instead be inﬂuenced by the
tradeoff between multiple factors, such as pay, beneﬁts,
and the negative consequences of working for a non-
environmentally responsible company.

Our second hypothesis, regarding the mediational role of
an organization’s reputation, was supported. The analysis
demonstrates that an environmental message on a com-
pany’s web site has the effect of improving the perceived
reputation of the company, and in turn the enhanced rep-
utation of a company makes it more attractive to pro-
spective employees. The implications of this ﬁnding are
noteworthy. The identiﬁcation of reputation as a mediating
factor indicates that a company’s reputation plays a role in
determining the effect of a pro-environmental stance. The
underlying reasons for this, however, are still unclear. One
possible explanation for this relationship is that job-seekers
associate pro-environmental activities with successful and
lucrative companies. In essence, individuals may believe
that if an organization can spend money on the environ-
ment then it is reputable, prestigious, stable, and can afford
to pay its employees well. A second possible reason for the
mediational role of reputation is that job-seekers may view
an organization’s concern for the environment as a sign
that it is respectable, caring, trustworthy, and will therefore
show concern not
its
employees. This rationale is consistent with signaling

theory, which proposes that prospective employees inter-
pret information gained during the recruitment process as a
sign of how they will be treated by the hiring organization.
Thus, an organization’s reputation regarding the environ-
ment may be an indication of how well it cares for its
employees.

Limitations and Future Research

It is important to view these results in the context of several
limitations. First, the experimental stimulus used was not
an actual web site, but a printout of a web site. A web site
is a dynamic, interactive medium, while the printout pro-
vided no opportunity for interaction. This was an important
aspect of our study design because it allowed us to stan-
the information the participants
dardize and control
received. However,
it may have limited the external
validity of the ﬁndings.

Reliance on data from a student sample also raises
external validity concerns. However, it should be noted that
many large organizations invest heavily in recruitment on
college campuses (Rynes and Boudreau 1986). Moreover,
numerous organizational positions are ﬁlled using college
recruitment tactics, such as web sites targeted to younger
adults, or the placement of a recruiter on campus (Rynes
and Boudreau 1986). This suggests that the sample was
representative of individuals for whom organizations spend
signiﬁcant resources trying to recruit. In addition,
the
recent meta-analysis by Chapman et al. (2005) conﬁrmed
that
laboratory-based research can play a vital role in
recruiting research. They found that
the relationship
between individuals’ perceptions of organizational char-
acteristics and their job pursuit intentions did not vary
based on whether the sample consisted of real applicants
versus non-applicants. The effect sizes reported in lab
studies were not signiﬁcantly different from those found in
ﬁeld studies.

Lastly, it should be noted that the effect of the pro-
environment message was relatively small in this study,
increasing willingness to pursue employment by only .26
on a ﬁve-point scale. As such, the size of the effect of the
pro-environment message (b = .17, p \ .05) was some-
what weaker than the previous ﬁndings of Bauer and Ai-
man-Smith (1996) (b = .26, p \ .001). Nevertheless, the
statistical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings should not be
ignored; instead researchers and practitioners should hold
realistic expectations about the amount of inﬂuence pro-
environmental messages can have on job pursuit intentions.
Perhaps more effort, beyond a simple statement on a web
site, should be invested by an organization in order to see
larger effects. For example, an organization could provide
additional detail to the applicant about their investment in
the environment, such as partnerships with environmental

The preceding limitations notwithstanding, the present
study contributes to the growing research on employee
recruiting in several ways. First, we formally examined and
failed to ﬁnd support for the assertion that an individual’s
personal environmental stance moderates the effect of a pro-
environmental web site on job pursuit intentions. While
implied in the literature (e.g., Bauer and Aiman-Smith
1996),
this relationship remained untested prior to the
present study. Secondly, we examined and found support for
the role an organization’s reputation plays when prospective
applicants see a pro-environmental recruitment message on
an organization’s web site. This ﬁnding provides valuable
information regarding the decision process that takes place
when an individual considers pursuing a job.

Future research might expand upon the present ﬁndings
by investigating precisely why a pro-environmental mes-
sage enhances the perceived reputation of an organization.
Speciﬁcally, what attributions does a job-seeker make
when s/he sees such a message? Both signaling theory and
social
identity theory have been proposed as possible
vehicles for these attributions. Social identity theory sug-
gests that a job-seeker would expect to experience an
enhanced self-concept from being employed by a reputa-
ble, environmentally conscious organization. Meanwhile,
signaling theory purports that the company’s reputation
provides an indication of how much it would care about its
employees. Another explanation from signaling theory is
that organizational support for the environment may shape
applicant assumptions about the stability of the organiza-
tion and its ﬁnancial generosity toward employees. It is
necessary to examine which, if any, of these factors con-
tribute to the ﬁndings uncovered in this study.

Future research should also investigate the possibility of
a P–O ﬁt interaction. Although an interaction was not
found in this study, there may be contextual factors that
masked the true effect. For example, some other features of
the web site may have inﬂuenced prestige perceptions in
addition to the environmental message.

Another avenue for research is to investigate whether an
organization’s environmental stance affects more distal
outcomes, beyond job pursuit intentions (e.g., accepting a
job offer, job satisfaction, and/or retention). Longitudinal
studies, following individuals from the job-seeking stage to
actual employment and retention, would be informative.
Lastly, future research should examine if the ﬁndings from
the present study can generalize to other corporate social
performance variables. For example, does community
involvement enhance an organization’s reputation in the
same manner as environmental awareness? Other social
performance variables to consider are the treatment of
women and minorities and employee relations.

Practical Implications

The ﬁndings of this study may be of value to organizations
wishing to improve recruiting initiatives. Companies can
begin by advertising their environmental efforts in order to
attract more applicants. If an organization is not currently
proactive toward environmental issues, it might consider the
beneﬁts of becoming involved and publicizing their activi-
ties. Organizations that already support the environment
should be advised that providing information about their
ecological initiatives can be a low-cost practical recruitment
mechanism. A primary medium for communicating this type
of information is in the recruitment portion of an organiza-
tion’s web site. This placement will ensure that applicants do
not overlook ecological information and that they incorpo-
rate it into their decision-making process. Finally, advertis-
ing environmental support may be effective even in the
absence of extensive details regarding the organization’s
environmental track record. The ﬁndings from the present
study suggest that even a small amount of information about
an organization’s environmental efforts can have a signiﬁ-
cant effect on whether an individual wishes to pursue a job.
