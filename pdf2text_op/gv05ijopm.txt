Abstract 

Highly  competitive  environments  are  leading  companies  to  implement  Supply 
Chain  Management  (SCM)  to  improve  performance  and  gain  a  competitive 
advantage.  SCM  involves  integration,  co-ordination  and  collaboration  across 
organisations  and  throughout  the  supply  chain.  It  means  that  SCM  requires 
internal (intraorganisational) and external (interorganisational) integration.  
This  paper  examines  the  Logistics-Production and Logistics-Marketing interfaces 
and their relation with the external integration process. The study also investigates 
the  causal  impact  of  these  internal  and  external  relationships on the company’s 
logistical service performance. 
To  analyse  this,  an  empirical  study  was  conducted  in  the  Spanish  Fast  Moving 
Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector.

Introduction 

Interest  in  Supply  Chain  Management  (SCM)  has  steadily  increased  since  the  1980’s,  when 
firms saw the benefits that could be derived from its implementation. In the literature, we can 
find  many  authors who acknowledge that SCM can improve performance (See  Shapiro, 1984; 
Ellram & Cooper, 1990; Cooper, 1993;  Gustin, Stank & Daugherty, 1994; The Global Research 
Team  at  Michigan  State  University,  1995;  Clark  &  Hammond,  1997;  Christopher,  1998;  and 
more  recently  Stank, Keller & Daugherty, 2001;  and Gimenez & Ventura, 2002), but very few 
studies analyse it empirically (Stank, Keller & Daugherty, 2001; and Gimenez & Ventura, 2002).  

SCM is “the integration of key business processes from end user through original suppliers that 
provides  products,  services,  and  information  that  add  value  for  customers  and  other 
stakeholders”  (Lambert,  Cooper  &  Pagh,  1998).  It  follows  that  SCM  involves  integration,  co-
ordination  and  collaboration  across  organisations  and  throughout  the  supply  chain.  It  means 
that SCM requires internal (intraorganisational) and external (interorganisational) integration.  

Internal  integration  has  to  be  studied  within  the  firm’s  boundaries.  It  seeks  to  eliminate  the 
traditional  functional  “silo  approaches”  and  emphasize  better  coordination  among  functional 
areas. We follow Stock, Greis & Kasarda (1998) and measure the level of internal integration as 
the extent to which logistics activities interact with other functional areas. External integration, 
on the other hand, has to be studied along the supply chain: It is the integration of the logistics 
activities across firm boundaries (Stock, Greis & Kasarda, 1998).  

How  are  firms  approaching  these  integration  processes?  Stevens  (1989)  suggests  that  firms 
first integrate internally (coordinating Supply, Production and Distribution) and then, extend the 
integration  to  its  supply  chain  members.  We  can  find  companies  in  different  stages  of  this 
integration process: Some companies may have not initiated the integration process yet, others 
may  have  achieved  internal  integration  by  coordinating  their  logistics  function  with  other 
functional areas; and, finally, there might be others that have extended the integration process 
to their supply chain members. 

In this paper we analyse the integration process and the contribution of both levels of integration 
(internal  and  external)  to  improving  firms’  performance.  We  analyse  the  impact  of  internal 
integration  by  considering  the  interaction  among  three  distinct  but  related  areas:  Logistics, 
Production  and  Marketing.  We  consider  these  areas  for  two  reasons:  first,  the  coordination 
between them is vital to produce and serve what customers demand, how and when they want. 
And, second, Logistics is an organizational function which shares responsibilities with Marketing 
and  Production.  Companies  were  traditionally  organised  according  to  two  main  areas: 
Production  and  Marketing,  considering  the  rest  as  auxiliary  or  support  functions.  Before  the 
existence  of  the  integrated  logistics  concept  (Supply-Production-Distribution), some of today’s 
logistics  responsibilities  were  under  the  Production  or  Marketing  control.  But,  when  Logistics 

2 


appeared as an organizational function, some of the Marketing and Production’s responsibilities 
were transferred to, or co-managed with the Logistics department. Figure 1 shows the activities 
of the Production, Logistics and Marketing functions. This figure also shows that some activities 
are in the intersections of Production-Logistics or Logistics-Marketing.

Regarding  the  external  integration,  we  analyse  its  impact  on  performance  according  to  its 
degree  of  implementation.  For  that  purpose  we  examine  two  different  manufacturer-retailer 
relationships  for  each  company.  Each  of  these  two  relationships  attains  a  maximum  and  a 
minimum level of external integration respectively. 

In  the  literature,  the  impact  of  cross-functional  and  cross-organizational  integration  on 
performance  has  been  analysed  from  different  perspectives.  Ruekert  &  Walker  (1987)  and 
Parente,  Pegels  &  Suresh  (2002)  analysed  the  Marketing-Production interface  while Griffin & 
Hauser  (1992),  Céspedes  (1994),  Rho,  Hahm  &  Yu  (1994),  Kahn  (1996)  and  Liedtka  (1996) 
concentrated  on  the  Marketing  /  R&D  integration.  From  the  logistics  point  of  view,  we  can 
classify the existing studies in three groups: those that analyse the relationship between internal 
integration and performance, those others that study the external integration and performance 
link, and those that consider the impact of both levels of integration on performance.  

Among  the  ones  that  study  the  relationship between internal integration and performance we 
could  mention  the  articles  of  Stank,  Daugherty  &  Ellinger  (2000)  and  Ellinger,  Daugherty  & 
Keller  (2000),  who  analysed  the  impact  of  the  Marketing/Logistics  integration  on  distribution 
service performance.  

With respect to the studies that analyse the impact of external integration upon performance we 
have  to  mention  the  following:  Groves  &  Valsamakis  (1998),  Stank,  Crum  &  Arango  (1999), 
Stank,  Daugherty  &  Autry  (1999),  Ellinger,  Taylor  &  Daugherty  (2000) and Scannell, Vickery & 
Dröge (2000). Groves & Valsamakis (1998) analysed the effect of relationships’ management 
on  firms’  performance.    Stank,  Crum  &  Arango  (1999)  investigated  the  link  between  interfirm

supply  chain  coordination  and  performance  on  key  logistical  elements.  Stank,  Daugherty  & 
Autry  (1999)  analysed  the  association  between  Collaborative  Planning  Forecasting  and 
Replenishment  (CPFR)  programs  [1]  and  effectiveness  in  achieving  operational  performance 
goals.  Ellinger,  Taylor  &  Daugherty

Finally, regarding the studies which consider the effect of both levels of integration (internal and 
external) we have to mention: Vargas, Cardenas & Matarranz (2000), Stank, Keller & Daugherty 
(2001)  and  Gimenez  &  Ventura  (2002).  Stank,  Keller  &  Daugherty  (2001)  and  Gimenez  & 
Ventura  (2002)  explored  the  contribution  of  both  levels  of  integration  simultaneously,  while 
Vargas, Cardenas & Matarranz (2000) considered both levels of integration independently.

integration  are  analysed 
simultaneously. But, our paper differs from the existing studies in some aspects: first, while most 
of the existing studies consider single departments or a general internal integration level without 
considering  the  interaction  between  departments,  we  consider  such  interaction.  And  second, 
while the existing studies (except Gimenez & Ventura, 2002) assign a unique degree of external 
integration  to  each  company,  we  consider  that  companies  usually  strategically  segment  their 
relationships (Kraljic, 1983; Copacino, 1990; Anderson and Narus, 1991; Cooper and Gardner, 
1993,  Dyer,  Cho  and  Chu,  1998;  Tang,  1999,  Masella  and  Rangone, 2000) and establish high 
collaborating relationships with some supply chain members and arm’s length relationships with 
others.  

2  Methodology 

To  examine  the  linkage  between  integration  and  logistical  performance  we  designed  a 
questionnaire with three sections, each one of them related to one construct: internal integration 
(Logistics-Marketing and Logistics-Production), external integration and performance. 

In the internal integration part of the questionnaire we asked companies to measure the level of 
integration  in  two  internal  interfaces:  Logistics-Marketing  and  Logistics-Production.  The 
variables  used  to  measure  these  integration  levels  are  shown  in  table  1.  They  were  defined 
from  the  literature (Stank, Daugherty & Ellinger, 2000 and  Ellinger,  Daugherty  &  Keller,  2000) 
and  based  on  expert  opinion  to  provide  respondents  with  a  common  understanding  of  the 
questions. 

Part  two  of  the  questionnaire  was  designed  to  measure  the  level  of  external  integration.  As 
companies  usually  strategically  segment  their  relationships  (Kraljic,  1983;  Copacino,  1990;

relationships: 

Anderson and Narus, 1991; Cooper and Gardner, 1993, Dyer, Cho and Chu, 1998; Tang, 1999, 
Masella  and  Rangone,  2000),  we  decided  to  measure  the  level  of  integration  in  two 
manufacturer-retailer 
least 
collaborating  one.  The  variables  used  to  measure  these  external  integration  levels  are  also 
shown  in  table  1.  These  variables  were  designed  adapting  the  internal  integration  variables 
used by Stank, Daugherty & Ellinger (2000) and Ellinger, Daugherty & Keller (2000) to a supply 
chain relationship.

Performance variables are also shown in table 1. These variables were designed according to 
the literature and the results of an exploratory study (Gimenez, 2000), which showed that  the 
benefits associated to Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) [3] were service improvements and 
costs  and  stock-outs  reductions.  As  performance  data  was  difficult  to  obtain  because  of  the 
reticence of participants to give confidential data, performance in this study was operationalised 
by using senior management’s perceptions of performance improvements. In order to analyse 
the  integration-performance link, performance had to be related to the external integration level 
achieved in each relationship. 

5 


Questions were designed using a ten point Likert scale. The survey instrument was pre-tested 
at  meetings  with  several  experts,  and,  suggestions  for  rewording  and  repositioning  were 
incorporated into the final survey instrument. 

Potential  participants  were  identified  from  a  Spanish  companies’  database  (Fomento  de  la 
Producción  25.000  database).  Manufacturers  from  the  food  and  perfumery-detergent sectors 
with  a  sales  figure  higher  than  30  million  euros  were  selected  to  make  up  the  sample  (199 
companies).  

As  prenotification increases the response rate (Fox, Crask & Kim, 1988), all the companies in 
the  sample  were  telephoned  before  mailing  the  questionnaire.  We  informed  each  company’s 
Logistics or Supply Chain Director about the study, and only one company refused to participate 
in the survey. The 64 questionnaires received represent a 32,3% (64/198) response rate, which 
is  considered  very  satisfactory,  as  potential  participants  were  asked  to  provide  sensitive  and 
confidential  data  about  their  performance.  Other  similar  studies  have  worked  with  a  lower 
response  rate;  for  example,  Groves  &  Valsamakis  (1998)  achieved  a  response  rate  of  15%; 
Stank, Daugherty & Autry (1999) a 20,2%, and Stank, Keller & Daugherty (2001) a 11,5%. 

We  conducted  an  analysis  of  non-response  bias  based  on  the  procedure  described  by 
Armstrong  &  Overton  (1977)  and  Lambert  &  Harrington  (1990).  We  numbered  the  responses 
sequentially in the order they were received and compared late responses with early responses 
to all model variables using T-tests. We did not find any noticeable pattern among the variables 
that could indicate the existence of a non-response bias.

 Model specification 

The proposed structural model is shown in figure 2. There are four latent variables or factors: 
internal  integration  in  the  Logistics-Production  interface,  internal  integration  in  the 
Logistics-Marketing interface,  external  integration,  and  firm’s  performance. Both internal 
integration  and  external  integration  affect  firm’s  performance.  Also,  internal  integration  (in  the 
Logistics-Production and Logistics-Marketing interfaces) is thought to be correlated among each 
other and with external integration.  

These  factors  are  not  observed  directly.  Instead,  we  use  several  measurement  variables  as 
shown in Table 1. The complete model combines a construct part and a measurement part. It is 
a simple factor analysis model that can be easily estimated with a program such as EQS [4] 
(see Bentler, 1995).

The theoretical model illustrated in figure 2 was subjected to analysis using Structural Equation 
Modelling  (SEM),  which  is  a  powerful  statistical  technique  that  combines  the  measurement 
model (confirmatory factor analysis) and the structural model (regression or path analysis) into a 
simultaneous statistical test.  

4  Results  

Tables 2 and 3 show the estimation results of the model. Table 2 reports the measurement part 
of  the  model.  Table  3  displays  the  structural  coefficients  of  the  model,  both  the  regression 
coefficients  among  the  performance  and  the  integration  factors,  and  the  variance-covariance 
structure  of  the  integration  variables.  The  estimation  is  based  on  Maximum  Likelihood  and 
Normal theory. 

We  estimated  the  model  twice,  with  data  from  the  strongest  and  the  weakest  collaborating 
relationship between each firm and its retailers. The first two numeric columns of tables 2 and 3 
show  the  results  for  the  strongest  collaborating  relationship,  while  the  last  two  columns  are 
computed from the data of the least collaborating one.

4.1  Measurement part of the model 

In  the  logistics  discipline,  researchers  are  calling  for  future  research  to  have  a  stronger 
theoretical foundation and to focus on theory testing research (Mentzer & Kahn, 1995; Mentzer 
&  Flint,  1997  and  Garver  &  Mentzer,  1999).    To  increase  rigor  in  testing for construct validity, 
Garver & Mentzer (1999) pointed out that SEM is a very useful statistical instrument.  Garver & 
Mentzer (1999) also advised performing and reporting all kinds of construct validity tests “to give 
the  reader  a  greater  level  of  confidence  in  the  research  findings”.    Following  them,  we 
performed some exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis before attempting the estimation 
of the complete model. Such analysis advised discarding the first proposed measure of internal 
integration  in  the  Logistics-Production  interface,  since  we  detected  two  different  factors 
associated with it. The rest of the measures were judged appropriate in the light of the results of 
most  of  the  tests  suggested  by  Garver  and  Mentzer.  Those  are  reported  in  table A2, in the 
appendix.  

Table 2 shows the loading coefficients between the factors and their respective measurement 
variables. To fix the scale, the loading of the first measure for each factor is set to one. The rest 
of the loading coefficients are always close to unity, and all of them are highly significant. Their 
values are very similar regardless of the fact that they have been estimated with data from the 
strongest or the weakest collaborating relationship.

According to the CFI measure of fit, the model is accepted when estimated with data from the 
most  collaborating  relationship.  All  the  variance  and  covariance  figures  among  the  integration 
factors are statistically significant. If we use them to compute the correlation ratios, we find that 
the  correlation  between  the  two  internal  integration  factors  is  about  0.56,  the  correlation of 
external  integration  with  internal  integration  in  the  Logistics-Production interface is about 0.47, 
and  the  correlation  between  external  integration  and  internal  integration  in  the  Logistics-
Marketing area is 0.30. 

External  integration  has  a  positive  and  direct  effect  on  performance.  Internal  integration  does 
not. After taking into account the correlation among all the integration factors, we observe that 
internal  integration  (in  either  Logistics-Production  or  Logistics-Marketing)  does  not  have  any 
significant direct effect on performance when we consider the most collaborating relationship. 
External  integration  dominates  the  performance  of  the  firm  in  the  context  of  the  most 
collaborating relationship with its retailers.

4.3  Weakest relationship 

The results are different when we estimate the model with the data from the least collaborating 
relationship.  

The  fit  of  the  model  is  a  little  worse,  but  very  close  to  the  acceptance  boundary  of  0.9.  We 
observe  now  that  the  covariance  between  external  integration  and  internal  integration  in  the 
Logistics-Marketing  interface  is  not  statistically  significant.  The  correlation  among  the  two 
factors  is  0.248,  lower  than  before.  Also,  the  covariance  between  internal  integration  in  the 
Logistics-Production  area  and  external  integration  is  lower  than  in  the  case  of  the  strongest 
relationship  previously  discussed,  with  a  correlation  estimate  of  0.318.    The  variance  of  the 
external integration factor is also lower, indicating that all the companies in the data share a low 
and  similar  degree  of  external  integration  in  their  least  collaborating  relationships  with  their 
retailers.  We  also  observe  an  interesting  difference  in  the  estimated  structural  regression 
coefficients.  Now,  internal  integration  in  the  Logistics-Production  interface  has  a  positive  and 
significant effect on firm’s performance. External integration still has a direct positive effect on 
performance, but such effect is weaker than before. 

5  Conclusions 

There are some generic results that can be derived from this analysis: 

•  There is a positive relationship between the Logistics-Production integration and external 
integration, being higher in the “most collaborating relationship” model. There is also a 
positive relationship between the level of integration in the Logistics-Marketing interface 
and  the  level  of  external  integration,  but  it  is  marginally  significant  only  for  the  “most 
collaborating  relationship”  model  (it  is  not  statistically  significant  for  the  “least 
collaborating”  model).  Despite  the  existence  of  these  internal-external  integration 
relationships, we cannot establish a causal relationship. These relationships have to be 
understood in the following way: internal integration is necessary for external integration, 
but  internal  integration  does  not  imply  external integration. In other words, firms follow 
the integration process proposed by Stevens (1989): firms first integrate internally and, 
then,  extend  the  integration  process  to  their  supply  chain  members.  However,  this 
integration process is undertaken at different speeds: there are companies which are still 
not  integrated,  others  that  have  only  achieved  internal  integration,  and  some  that  have 
achieved internal and external integration. 

•  For 

the  most  collaborating  relationships  (in  other  words,  externally 

integrated 
relationships),  there  is  a  higher  correlation  between  Logistics-Production and external 
integration  than  between  Logistics-Marketing  and  external  integration.  Also,  a  cluster 
analysis showed that there was not any externally integrated relationship in a company 

11 


not  integrated  in  the  Logistics-Production  interface.  However,  this  cluster  analysis 
showed that there were externally integrated relationships in companies not integrated in 
the  Logistics-Marketing  interface.  This  shows  that  to  achieve  external  integration 
companies  need 
interface,  while, 
interestingly, the integration between Logistics and Marketing is not a prerequisite.

•  With respect to the impact of internal integration on performance, we have to distinguish 
between  the  Logistics-Marketing  and  Logistics-Production interfaces. When companies 
achieve a high level of internal integration in the Logistics-Marketing interface, this level 
of  internal  integration  does  not  lead  to  a  better  absolute  performance.  A  high  level  of 
collaboration among Logistics and Marketing processes does not contribute to achieving 
cost,  stock-outs  or  lead  time  reductions.  This  is  true  for  the  most  and  the  least 
collaborating models. However, when a firm achieves a high level of internal integration 
in  the  Logistics-Production  interface,  its  effect  on  performance  depends  on  whether 
there is, or is not, external integration. The level of Logistics-Production integration leads 
to a better absolute performance, in other words, it contributes to achieving cost, stock-
outs  and  lead  time  reductions,  when  there  is  not  external  integration.  However,  when 
firms  are  externally  integrated  (for  the  most  collaborating  relationships),  the  level  of 
external  integration  has  such  an  important  effect  on  performance  that  it  annuls  (or 
reduces) the effect of the Logistics-Production integration. 

•  External  collaboration  among  supply  chain  members  contributes  to  achieving  costs, 
stock-outs and lead-time reductions. This is true for both models, the most and the least 
collaborating. 

•  The greatest influence on firms’ logistical service performance is for external integration.  
However,  for  the  least  collaborating  relationships,  the  internal  Logistics-Production 
integration has also a high impact on distribution performance. 

SCM  is  not  easy  to  set-up: there can be internal barriers to change processes, and there can 
also  be  difficulties  to  shifting  from  traditional  arms-length  or  even  adversarial  attitudes  to  a 
partnership  perspective.  However,  support  has  been  found  for  a  relationship  between  firms’ 
logistical performance and SCM. 

With respect to the studies mentioned in the literature review, our results confirm that internal 
and  external  integration  are  correlated  and  that  external  integration  leads to a better logistical 
performance. We add some contributions: we have shown that the impact on performance of 
internal  integration  depends  on  the  functional  areas  that  are  being  integrated  and  the  level  of 
external integration. When companies are not externally integrated, we have demonstrated that 
the Logistics-Production integration leads to a better absolute performance, while the Logistics-
Marketing  integration,  interestingly,  does  not.  However,  when  companies  are  externally 

12 


integrated,  the  level  of  internal  integration  in  any  of  the  two  internal  interfaces  does  not  have 
any impact on performance.  

Our results differ from those obtained by Stank, Daugherty and Ellinger (2000), who found that 
companies with high levels of integration between Logistics and Marketing showed higher levels 
of  logistical  service  performance  (response  to  customer  needs,  response  to  special 
requirements  and  collaboration  in  new  product  launches).  Further  research  on  the  Logistics-
Marketing  impact  on  performance  should  be  carried out and other logistical service measures 
should  be  included  in  the  performance  construct.  It  would  also  be  interesting  to  compare  the 
impact  of  both  internal  integration  levels  (Logistics-Production  and  Logistics-Marketing)  on 
performance  in  other  industries,  as  the  Logistics-Marketing  interface  may  be  more  crucial  in 
other sectors.  

Finally,  we  have  to  mention  that  despite  our  findings,  our  study  has  some  limitations.  One  of 
them is that we have not considered other important members of the grocery supply chain such 
as grocery retailers, Third Party Logistics, manufacturers’ suppliers, etc. We have focused only 
on  the  manufacturer-retailer  relationship  from  the  manufacturer  point  of  view.  We  have  only 
considered  the  effect  of  inter-firm  co-ordination  from the perspective of the provider (as most 
studies  do),  while  satisfaction  with  service  performance  should  also  be  assessed  from  the 
customer perspective. To alleviate the concern about the biased performance assessment by 
providers, future research should collect data from both sides of the relationship.

Table  A.2  reports  some  of  the  results  of  a  preliminary  confirmatory  factor  analysis 
that  we  carried  out  separately  on  each  measurement  model.  The  measurement 
model  of  the  internal  integration  factors  is  common  to  the  two  collaboration 
relationships  that  we  considered.  External  integration  and performance are different 
in  each  type  of  relationship.  In  this  table  we  have  chosen  to  report  the  results  of  the 
tests  conducted  with  data  proceeding  from  the  most  collaborating  relationship.    The 
results are very similar when we consider the less collaborating relationships. 

Unidimensionality  of  the  measurement  model  is  assessed  by  examining  the  overall 
2c  
measurement  model  fit  and  the  fit  of  its  components.    Although  we  report  the 

statistic  fit  tests  and  observe  that  their  associated  probability  values  reveal  a  very 
good fit of each model, we know that such statistic is too dependent on sample size 
and it is better to report alternative measures of fit, such as the Comparative Fit Index 
(CFI).  The  CFI  reported  in  table  A2  measures  the  fit  of  each  latent  variable’s 
measurement model separately. All the values are greater than 0.9 and therefore we 
conclude  that  the  individual  measurement  models  fit  well.  When  testing  the  overall 
measurement  model,  that  is  a  model  with  the  two  internal integration latent variables 
and  one  external  integration  latent  variable  allowing  all  three  variables  to  be 
correlated,  the  global  CFI  is  0.923.  The  correlation  between  the  two  internal 
integration factors is 0.57. The correlation between internal integration in the logistics 
production 
internal 
integration  in  the  logistics  marketing  and  external  integration  is  0.315.  Modification 
indexes have been examined and significant correlations among measurement errors 
have been incorporated to the model. The standardised residuals for each model are 
all small. As seen in table A2, all the loadings have the right magnitude and direction 
and are all highly significant. Therefore validity is also confirmed.

As  for  scale  reliability,  we  report  three  measures  as  suggested  by  Garver  and 
Mentzer (1999). Table A2 shows the Cronbach’s  a  (which is always bigger than the 
benchmark  value  of  0.9),  the  Construct  Reliability  test  (which  is  always greater than 
the acceptance level of 0.7), and the Variance Extracted test (which is always bigger 
than 0.5 as it should).
