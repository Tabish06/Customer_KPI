 We examined the relationship between employee creativity and job performance. Further-
 more, we identified two learning-related personal and situational variables - employee
 learning orientation and transformational leadership - and examined their effects on
 employee creativity through employee creative self-efficacy. We found that employee
 creativity was positively related to employee sales and to supervisor-rated employee job
 performance. Employee learning orientation and transformational leadership were posi-
 tively related to employee creativity, and these relationships were mediated by employee
 creative self-efficacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for creativity theory
 and research, as well as for management practice.

 Researchers have suggested that creativity - the

 with confidence to perform beyond the expecta-
 1988, 1996) - is critical for organizations' survival
 and competitiveness (e.g., George & Zhou, 2002;

 eficial for work outcomes, researchers have de-

 tecedents, but they have shown much less interest
 in its effects (Mumford, 2003; Zhou & Shalley,
 2008). Creativity is of value to organizations, how-
 ever, to the extent that it impacts employee job
 performance (Gilson, 2008). Hence, it is important
 to determine both the antecedents and conse-
 quences of employee creativity (Zhou & Shalley,
 2008).

 Results linking transformational leadership and a
 learning orientation to creativity have been incon-
 clusive. Jaussi and Dionne (2003) found little em-
 pirical support for the notion that transformational
 leadership positively influences creativity in a lab-
 oratory study with student subjects. However, in
 the first field study of transformational leadership
 and employee creativity, Shin and Zhou (2003) re-
 ported that the two related positively. With respect
 to a learning orientation, Redmond et al. (1993)
 reported that when manipulated in their laboratory
 study, it did not relate to the originality of solutions
 generated for a specialized marketing task.

 Some researchers believe that employee creativ-

 ity will flourish when a supervisor provides trans-
 formational leadership (Jaussi & Dionne, 2003;
 Shin & Zhou, 2003) and when employees have a
 learning orientation (Redmond, Mumford, & Teach,
 1993). Transformational leadership has been de-

 One possible explanation for the nonsignificant
 relationships reported above lies in the shortness of
 the experiments conducted by Jaussi and Dionne
 (2003) and Redmond et al. (1993). Specifically, it
 simply takes time for individuals to acquire and
 harness new knowledge for coming up with cre-
 ative solutions (Weisberg, 1999). Perhaps a learning

 orientation influences performance only over the
 long term (Redmond et al., 1993). Similarly, it is
 likely to take time for the influence of transforma-
 tional leaders to take hold on their followers. A
 study involving actual practicing managers and
 their employees would be much more likely to
 reveal the positive influence of leadership on cre-
 ativity. Moreover, field studies with temporally
 lagged designs may be needed to uncover these
 effects. It is also possible that the effects of a learn-
 ing orientation are less robust for North Americans
 than for their East Asian counterparts, for whom
 motivation for self-improvement is especially
 strong (Gelfand, Erez, & Aycan, 2007; Heine et al.,
 2001; Li, 2002). Hence, we drew our sample from
 Taiwan.

 mance in a field setting; investigate the effects of
 transformational leadership and employee learning
 orientation on employee creativity using a im-
 proved design; elucidate employee creative self-effi-
 cacy as a mediator of the influence of transforma-
 tional leadership and employee learning orientation
 on employee creativity; and test for this mediation
 using a Taiwanese sample in which the motivation
 for self-improvement is likely to be particularly
 salient. Accordingly, our study goes above and be-
 yond past studies in several respects. First, we ex-
 amine transformational leadership on the part of
 actual leaders in the workplace (not experimental
 confederates) and the actual (versus manipulated)
 learning orientation of their employees. We also
 adopt a temporally lagged, design for measuring
 transformational leadership and employee creativ-
 ity rather than a cross-sectional design (e.g., Shin &
 Zhou, 2003). Finally, we test employee creative
 self-efficacy as a mediator of the influence of trans-
 formational leadership and employee learning ori-
 entation on employee creativity.

 To understand the discrepant findings of past
 studies, it is helpful to delve into the mechanism
 through which transformational leadership and a
 learning orientation affect individual creativity. It
 may be that the conditions needed for mediation to
 develop and exert an effect were present in Shin
 and Zhou (2003), but not in Jaussi and Dionne
 (2003) or in Redmond et al. (2003). For example,
 the subjects in Jaussi and Dionne's (2003) experi-
 ment had limited interactions with their leader,
 who was an experimental confederate. The media-
 tor through which transformational leadership ex-
 erts its influence may not have had time to develop.
 By examining potential mediators, we may better
 understand why expected influences on creativity
 have been observed in some studies but not in
 others. With the exception of Shin and Zhou
 (2003), prior research has not investigated the psy-
 chological mechanisms that bring forth creativity.
 Shin and Zhou (2003) found that intrinsic motiva-
 tion (i.e., interest and enjoyment; Ryan and Deci
 [2000]) partially mediated the influence of transfor-
 mational leadership on creativity, giving rise to the
 possibility of there being other mediators of this
 relationship (Shalley, Zhou, & Oldham, 2004). One
 particularly promising mediator is creative self-
 efficacy - the belief that one has the knowledge and
 skills to produce creative outcomes (Tierney &
 Farmer, 2002). Creative self-efficacy is based on a
 person's knowledge and skills enabling creativity.
 Because efficacy beliefs nourish intrinsic motiva-
 tion by enhancing perceptions of self-competence
 (Bandura, 1986; Deci & Ryan, 1985), creative self-
 efficacy may also reflect intrinsic motivation to en-
 gage in creative activities. As such, it should be a
 powerful precursor to creativity, mediating the in-
 fluence of transformational leadership and em-
 ployee learning orientation.

 Our study had four key goals: to test the relation-
 ship between employee creativity and job perfor-

 We chose transformational leadership and em-
 ployee learning orientation as predictors of em-
 ployee creativity because they are both related to
 actions intended to improve an individual's com-
 petence and hence to lead to learning (Benjamin &
 Flynn, 2006; Kruglanski et al., 2000), and learn-
 ing has been linked to creativity (Amabile &
 Gryskiewicz, 1987). Other potential predictors ex-
 ist; for example, Farmer, Tierney, and Kung-Mc-
 Intyre (2003) discussed creative role identity in this
 regard; George and Zhou (2002) were concerned
 with mood; Oldham and Cummings (1996) dis-
 cussed job complexity; and Shalley (1995) was con-
 cerned with a creativity goal. These potential pre-
 dictors are, however, unrelated to actions intended
 to promote learning. We examine antecedents to
 employee creativity with a learning perspective in
 mind. Moreover, we study creative self-efficacy as
 mediator for three reasons. First, self-efficacy has
 been found to be a vital "driver" of performance in
 a variety of task domains (Bandura, 1986, 1997).
 Given our interest in creativity and the domain-
 specific nature of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997), we
 examine employee creative self-efficacy as the psy-
 chological mechanism behind creativity. Second,
 studies have documented a positive relationship
 between creative self-efficacy and creativity (Tier-
 ney & Farmer, 2002, 2004); and finally, we believe
 that individuals' creative self-efficacy will be
 higher if they are high (versus low) in learning
 orientation and/or when they come under the in-
 fluence of transformational leaders.

 LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES

 Effects of Employee Creativity on Employee
 Job Performance

 Research on the link between creativity and per-
 formance is sparse and has been constrained to
 academic settings (for a review, see Gilson [2008]).
 For example, Chamorro-Premuzic (2006) found a
 positive relationship between creative thinking and
 final dissertation grades in a sample of students.
 Notwithstanding the lack of direct empirical evi-
 dence from the corporate world, we expect a posi-
 tive relationship between employee creativity and
 job performance. Specifically, when employees ex-
 hibit creativity at work, they generate novel re-
 sponses that are useful in dealing with the tasks at
 hand (Amabile, 1983, 1996). Creative responses
 may include devising new procedures or processes
 for carrying out tasks, or identifying products or
 services to better meet customer needs (Zhou, 1998;
 Zhou & Shalley, 2003). Creative responses may also
 take the form of refinements of existing procedures
 or processes to enhance efficiency (e.g., through
 reducing the resources needed to complete a task),
 or the discovery of alternative procedures or pro-
 cesses that are more effective. Both forms of re-
 sponse should enable employees to improve their
 personal job performance. In addition, other em-
 ployees may take up a novel, useful idea and apply
 and develop it in their own work (Shalley et al.,
 2004). As a result, the performance of an entire unit
 or organization may improve. Additionally, al-
 though such benefits of employees' own creativity
 may not contribute directly to their actual work
 effectiveness or efficiency, supervisors may factor
 in such contributions when rating their employees'
 job performance. Preliminary evidence suggests
 that employee creativity enhances job performance.
 For example, Oldham and Cummings (1996) re-
 ported a significant, positive correlation between
 employee creativity and supervisor-rated employee
 job performance. Therefore, we predict:

 Hypothesis 1. Employees who are more rather
 than less creative will generally have higher
 levels of job performance.

 Effects of Employee Learning Orientation and
 Transformational Leadership on Creativity

 Research has found learning to be essential for
 creativity (Weisberg, 1999). This finding begets a
 further question: Might learning-related actions,
 such as those associated with leaders' transforma-
 tional behaviors and with employees' learning ori-
 entation, be associated with higher levels of em-

 ployee creativity? According to social cognitive
 theory, individuals acquire knowledge and skills
 through "enactive mastery experience" (i.e., direct
 experience of attaining a task or skill) and "mastery
 modeling" (i.e., observational learning from profi-
 cient models such as leaders) (Bandura, 1986,
 1997). Both internal personal factors and external
 situational factors affect acquisition of knowledge
 and skills (Bandura, 1986). A learning orientation
 is an internal mind-set that motivates an individual
 to develop his or her competence (Dweck, 1986,
 2000; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; VandeWalle, Brown,
 Cron, & Slocum, 1999); therefore, it stands out as an
 important internal drive for enactive mastery. Indi-
 viduals with a learning orientation seek challenges
 that provide them with learning opportunities
 (Ames & Archer, 1988). Research suggests that a
 learning orientation is conducive to the acquisition
 of knowledge and skills (e.g., Brett & VandeWalle,
 1999; Kozlowski, Gully, Brown, Salas, Smith, &
 Nason, 2001). A learning orientation has also been
 shown to enhance cross-cultural adjustment,
 which involves the acquisition of culturally novel
 skills and behaviors (Gong & Fan, 2006). Empirical
 evidence suggests that acquisition of knowledge
 and skills enhances creativity (e.g., Amabile &
 Gryskiewicz, 1987; Gardner, 1993; Hayes, 1989).
 Therefore, we hypothesize:

 Hypothesis 2. Employee learning orientation is
 positively related to employee creativity.
 Leadership is an important aspect of the work
 environment for employees (e.g., Oldham & Cum-
 mings, 1996; Scott & Bruce, 1994). Transforma-
 tional leadership describes a class of behaviors en-
 acted by a leader composed of four dimensions:
 intellectual stimulation (i.e., challenging the status
 quo and taking novel approaches to problems), cha-
 risma or idealized influence, inspirational motiva-
 tion (i.e., energizing followers by articulating a
 compelling vision), and individualized consider-
 ation (i.e., supporting, mentoring, and developing
 followers) (Bass, 1985). From the perspective of
 social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, 1997),
 transformational leadership represents a critical ex-
 ternal factor in employee learning. Transforma-
 tional leaders, by engaging in intellectual stimula-
 tion, set the expectation for creativity and serve as
 creative role models for employees. Because trans-
 formational leaders are charismatic and inspiration-
 al employees are likely to attend to and learn from
 such leaders. Through the influence of behavioral
 modeling, transformational leaders enhance fol-
 lowers' ability to develop new ideas and question
 outmoded operating rules (Bass & Avolio, 1990).
 Through individualized consideration, transforma-

 tional leaders show empathy, consideration, and
 support for employees, which should help over-
 come the fear of challenging the status quo, leading
 to higher creativity. Finally, transformational lead-
 ers delegate and encourage follower autonomy and
 use their greater knowledge and experience to de-
 velop their protégés (Avolio & Gibbons, 1988; Bass,
 1985; Dvir et al., 2002). Such a developmental ori-
 entation should enhance employee learning, and
 thus creativity. As research has shown the four
 dimensions of transformational leadership to be
 highly correlated and to thereby reflect a higher-
 order construct of leadership (e.g., Avolio, Bass, &
 Jung, 1999), we expect all dimensions to work to-
 gether as whole to impact employee creativity
 (Shin & Zhou, 2003).

 Dweck & Leggett, 1988). As a result, they are less
 likely to experience aversive arousal and therefore
 are more likely to maintain their self-efficacy in
 creative endeavors. Finally, a focus on the improve-
 ment of self-competence characterizes employee
 learning orientation. Creative endeavors are neces-
 sarily challenging and risky (Bandura, 1997). A fo-
 cus on self-improvement rather than on external
 approval shields employees from others' negative
 reactions that may arise during the creative pro-
 cess. In other words, by focusing their attention on
 how to improve their competence, learning-ori-
 ented individuals are able to maintain efficacy be-
 liefs throughout the uncertainty of the creative
 journey. Thus,

 Hypothesis 3. Transformational leadership is
 positively related to employee creativity.

 Hypothesis 4. Employee creative self-efficacy
 mediates the positive relationship between em-
 ployee learning orientation and employee cre-
 ativity predicted by Hypothesis 2.
 We expect transformational leadership to have

 Employee Creative Self-Efficacy as a Mediator

 Employee learning orientation seems conducive

 Why might employee learning orientation and
 transformational leadership increase employee cre-
 ativity? Such a question suggests that a mediator
 must account for each of these relationships. As we
 explained briefly at this article's outset, we believe
 this mediating variable is employee creative self-
 efficacy. We base this view on research that has
 shown that employees tend to be more creative
 when they have higher levels of creative self-effi-
 cacy (Tierney & Farmer, 2002, 2004) and our belief
 that increased employee self-efficacy results from
 employee learning orientation and transforma-
 tional leadership.

 an effect on the four sources of efficacy judgments
 previously identified by Bandura (1986, 1997): ob-
 servational learning, verbal persuasion, enactive
 mastery, and physiological arousal. Transforma-
 tional leaders are proactive in thinking and gener-
 ating new ideas (Bass, 1985). They expect their
 employees to exhibit similar qualities rather than to
 simply follow established routines. Transforma-
 tional leaders therefore serve as role models in this
 respect. Employees may become more confident in
 their ability to develop new ideas through observa-
 tional learning from such leaders (Bass & Avolio,
 1990). Through a combination of intellectually stim-
 ulating (e.g., encouraging novel approaches) and
 charismatic leadership behaviors (e.g., contagious
 communication and compelling visions) (Bass, 1985),
 transformational leaders can powerfully persuade
 employees that they too can be creative. Through
 individualized consideration, transformational lead-
 ers show support and encouragement. Previous re-
 search supports the contention that supervisory sup-
 port can persuade employees that they are capable of
 producing creative outcomes (Tierney & Farmer,
 2002).

 to the formation and maintenance of employee cre-
 ative self-efficacy for several reasons. First, a learn-
 ing orientation is grounded in an incremental con-
 ception of ability - that is, the idea that ability is
 malleable (Dweck, 1986; Dweck & Leggett, 1988)-
 and such a conception builds efficacy beliefs (Ban-
 dura, 1997). Second, a learning orientation leads to
 a focus on competence development (e.g., Dweck,
 1986, 2000). Employees with a learning orientation
 are likely to accumulate experience of successful
 mastery over time. With this repertoire of skills and
 experiences, these employees should be more self-
 efficacious when it comes to producing creative
 outcomes. Third, the attribution pattern associated
 with maintaining a learning orientation in the face
 of setbacks helps to maintain creative self-efficacy.
 Employees with a learning orientation do not at-
 tribute setbacks in creative endeavors to ability fac-
 tors but instead attribute them to such factors as
 insufficient effort or ineffective strategies (e.g.,

 Through their mentorship, transformational
 leaders help employees to develop themselves
 (Bass, 1985) and make it more likely that the em-
 ployees will have successful enactive mastery ex-
 periences, which in turn increase their creative
 self-efficacy over time. Transformational leaders
 delegate responsibilities to followers, which can
 foster employees' capacity for independent and
 critical thinking (Bass, 1985; Bass & Avolio, 1990).
 Indeed, research has shown that transformational
 leadership enhances followers' independent and

 critical thinking (e.g., Dvir et al., 2002). Employees
 are therefore more likely to view themselves as
 being capable of producing creative outcomes. Fi-
 nally, transformational leaders show their empa-
 thy, appreciation, consideration, and support for
 employees' efforts to take the initiative in tackling
 tasks. With such support and encouragement, em-
 ployees are less likely to experience aversive phys-
 iological arousal, and this helps to sustain their
 creative self-efficacy. Therefore:

 identify the creative aspects of their jobs. We asked
 the interviewees to describe what would represent
 creativity in their job activities. Some examples of
 creativity in acquiring new clients and sales in-
 cluded: (1) holding parties for classmates or alum-
 ni; (2) delivering seminars addressing topics of con-
 cern to clients, their relatives, and friends (e.g.,
 changes in the retirement system and tax saving),
 and designing custom-made insurance products
 (e.g., insurance products for tax saving) as part of
 these seminars; and (3) deliberately choosing tour
 groups for sightseeing to maximize opportunities to
 meet potential new clients. Four items measuring
 employee creativity were developed on the basis of
 consensus among focus group participants; the
 "Measures" section and Table 1 present these
 items. These items were used to complement the
 employee creativity measure drawn from Oldham
 and Cummings (1996).

 METHODS

 Focus Group Interview

 Main Study Design

 The present study was conducted in an insur-
 ance company in Taiwan. To ensure that the nature
 of the jobs was comparable, only insurance agents
 were included. Although people typically associate
 creative work with scientists and artists, creative
 work is not defined or tied to a particular occupa-
 tion (Mumford, Whetzel, & Reiter-Palmon, 1997).
 Rather, creativity is important in a wide variety of
 jobs and organizations (Perry-Smith, 2006; Shalley,
 Gilson, & Blum, 2000). It is thus appropriate to
 study creativity among insurance agents because
 their marketing and sales function "provides a
 'real-world* illustration of creative performance"
 (Redmond et al., 1993: 125). We conducted a focus
 group interview with eight insurance agents to

 For the main study, we selected 277 insurance
 agents out of a total of 554 possible agents by ran-
 domly picking every other name from a list. Imme-
 diately before the start of the fourth quarter (time
 1), we administered to the selected agents a survey
 containing questions about their learning orienta-
 tion and their demographic profile. In the fourth
 week of the quarter (time 2), we administered an-
 other survey to the same agents to assess their cre-
 ative self-efficacy. Because a small number of new
 agents had joined the company in the fourth quar-
 ter, we measured transformational leadership at

 time 2 so that the new hires would have had
 enough time to observe their supervisors' transfor-
 mational leadership. Since the new hires were on
 board at the date of the time 1 data collection, their
 learning orientation was assessed at that time. At
 the end of the fourth quarter (time 3), we asked the
 agents' immediate supervisors to rate each agent's
 creativity and overall job performance. All of the
 survey instruments were administered in Chinese,
 which was the language spoken by the respon-
 dents. A total of 200 agents and 111 immediate
 supervisors responded to the three surveys (a 72
 percent response rate).

 To supplement the rating of the agents' job per-

 formance by the supervisors, we obtained data on
 the fourth-quarter sales of the agents from the com-
 pany archives after the main study had been com-
 pleted. We also obtained data on the third-quarter
 sales of the same agents from the company ar-
 chives. The number of agents with valid sales data
 was 178. The ranks of the respondents ranged from
 low-level agents to senior sales managers. The av-
 erage age was 36.94 years; the average company
 tenure and insurance business experience were
 46.40 and 52.65 months, respectively. Of the insur-
 ance agents, 41 percent were male and 59 percent
 were female. About 16 percent had middle school
 educations: 43 percent had high school educations;
 and 41 percent had university educations.

 performance {a = .93; Farh & Cheng, 1997). The
 measure was developed in the Taiwan context.
 Sample items included, "This person always com-
 pletes job assignments on time" and "This person is
 one of the best employees in our work unit" (1 =
 "strongly disagree," to 5 = "strongly agree"). Sec-
 ond, we measured objective employee job perfor-
 mance as the natural logarithm of the fourth-quar-
 ter sales of employees.

 To examine whether employee creativity and su-
 pervisor-rated employee job performance were dis-
 tinct from each other, we subjected the items from
 both constructs to a single exploratory factor anal-
 ysis. The results indicated a clear two-factor struc-
 ture and that the items loaded on their intended
 factors (see Table 1). All of the items for employee
 creativity and supervisor-rated employee job per-
 formance met Ford, MacCallum, and Tait's (1986)
 heuristic guideline: loadings of .40 or greater on the
 appropriate factor with no major cross loadings. To
 determine the fit of the two-factor model, we fur-
 ther conducted a confirmatory factor analysis. Re-
 sults indicated that the two-factor model fit the
 data well (#* = 236.68, df= 43, RMSR = .03, CFI =
 .96, IFI = .96, NFI = .95, TLI = .95).

 Measures

 Employee creativity. We adapted the three-item
 employee creativity measure of Oldham and Cum-
 mings (1996) for this study. Because the meaning of
 creativity varies in different cultures and domains
 (e.g., Niu & Sternberg, 2002), we conducted a focus
 group interview and developed four creativity
 items for insurance sales jobs in the company.
 These four items [a = .93) covered (1) custom-made
 product/service packages, (2) acquiring new cli-
 ents, (3) increasing the sales force, and (4) develop-
 ing methods for promotion and sales. A sample
 item was, "This person often uses creativity to de-
 velop new clients through different means and
 channels" (1 = "strongly disagree," to 5 = "strongly
 agree"). We used these items to complement the
 measure from Oldham and Cummings (1996). This
 adaptation approach is consistent with the recom-
 mendation by Farh, Cannella, and Lee (2006) on
 developing valid instruments for research in the
 Chinese context.

 Employee job performance. We measured em-
 ployee job performance in two ways. First, super-
 visors responded to the four-item employee job per-
 formance measure, supervisor-rated employee job

 Employee learning orientation. We adapted El-
 liot and Church's (1997) six-item learning orienta-
 tion scale to the work setting studied here (a = .87).
 Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a satisfac-
 tory fit (x2 = 21.86, df= 5, RMSR = .03, CFI = .98,
 IFI = .98, NFI = .97, TLI = .95). Sample items
 included, "I prefer tasks that really challenge me so
 I can learn new things" and "I desire to completely
 master my job" (1, "strongly disagree," to 7,
 "strongly agree").

 Transformational leadership. We adopted the

 Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) Form
 5X-Short (Bass & Avolio, 1995) to measure trans-
 formational leadership. We asked respondents to
 indicate the degree to which the statements accu-
 rately described their immediate supervisors (1,
 "strongly disagree," to 7, "strongly agree"). The
 scale had the following five subscales (20 items
 total; a = .98) and sample items: idealized influ-
 ence (attributed) (e.g., "My supervisor acts in ways
 that build my respect"); idealized influence (behav-
 ior) (e.g., "My supervisor talks to us about his/her
 most important values and beliefs"); inspirational
 motivation (e.g., "My supervisor expresses his/her
 confidence that we will achieve our goals"); indi-
 vidualized consideration (e.g., "My supervisor
 spends time teaching and coaching me"); and in-
 tellectual stimulation (e.g., "My supervisor seeks
 differing perspectives when solving problems").
 We dropped two items that had low loadings in the
 exploratory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor

 analysis on the remaining items indicated a satis-
 factory fit [x2 = 585.91, df = 130, RMSR = .05,
 CFI = .96, IFI = .96, NFI = .96, TLI = .96).

 Employee creative self-efficacy. We used Tier-
 ney and Farmer's (2002) four-item measure of cre-
 ative self-efficacy [a = .91). The insurance agents
 indicated the extent to which they felt that each
 statement described how they felt about their cre-
 ative ability. Sample items included, "I have con-
 fidence in my ability to solve problems creatively"
 and "I feel that I am good at generating novel ideas"
 (1, "strongly disagree," to 7, "strongly agree"). Con-
 firmatory factor analysis indicated a satisfactory fit
 (X2 = 6.92, df= 2, RMSR = .02, CFI = .99, IFI = .99,
 NFI = .99, TLI = .97).

 Control variables. In testing the hypotheses, we

 controlled for age (in years), gender, education
 level (1 = "middle school," 2 = "high school," and
 3 = "university"), rank (1 = "entry level sales
 agents," 5 = "senior sales managers"), company
 tenure (in months), and insurance business experi-
 ence (in months). Research suggests that rank is
 related to involvement in innovation activities and
 the generation of creative ideas (as rated by inde-
 pendent judges) (e.g., Ibarra, 1993; Tierney, Farmer,
 & Graen, 1999). We controlled for education level
 and insurance business experience for two reasons.
 First, education and experience may affect the do-
 main-relevant knowledge or expertise that is im-
 portant for creativity (Amabile, 1988; Tierney et al.,
 1999). Second, we wanted to conduct a more rigor-
 ous test of the impact of employee learning orien-
 tation at time 1 on employee creativity at time 3. To
 do this, it was helpful to control for knowledge and
 experience before time 1. We controlled for age and

 tenure because they were included in prior creativ-
 ity research (e.g., Scott & Bruce, 1994; Tierney &
 Farmer, 2002) and because they may affect job per-
 formance (e.g., Sturman, 2003). Finally, in examin-
 ing the relationship between employee creativity
 and job performance, we also controlled for the
 natural logarithm of the third-quarter sales of each
 agent because of its potential effect on agents' cur-
 rent job performance.

 RESULTS

 Table 2 displays the means, standard deviations,

 and correlations of the variables included in our
 study. Employee creativity was positively related
 to supervisor-rated employee job performance (r =
 .73, p < .01) and fourth-quarter sales (r = .17, p <
 .05). Both employee learning orientation and trans-
 formational leadership were positively related to
 employee creativity (r = .20, p < .01; r = .18, p <
 .01, respectively) and employee creative self-effi-
 cacy (r = .37, p < .01; r = .17, p < .05, respec-
 tively). Employee creative self-efficacy was posi-
 tively related to employee creativity (r = .24,
 p < .01).

 Hypothesis Testing

 Because insurance agents were partially nested
 within supervisors, we used hierarchical linear
 modeling (HLM) to account for potential noninde-
 pendence of the observations. Ordinary least
 square (OLS) regression may not take into account
 the nested nature of individual-level data (Bliese &
 Hanges, 2004). There were no group-level vari-

 ables, because transformational leadership was
 measured in terms of the perception of each indi-
 vidual agent. In this case, we accounted for the
 nesting effect by allowing a random intercept. We
 conducted the analyses using hierarchical linear
 and nonlinear modeling, version 6 (HLM6) (Rau-
 denbush, Bryk, & Congdon, 2004). Before we report
 the HLM results, we wish to note that in separate
 analyses using OLS regression, we obtained sub-
 stantially similar results for all the hypotheses.

 respectively). In step 2, both employee learning
 orientation and transformational leadership had
 a significant relationship with employee creativ-
 ity (7 = -I8» P < -01¡ y = -1°> P < 05> respectively).
 The results from step 2 thus supported Hypotheses
 2-3. When employee creative self-efficacy was
 added to the equation in step 3, employee learning
 orientation and transformational leadership were
 no longer significant at the conventional level, but
 employee creative self-efficacy remained signifi-
 cant (7 = .09, p < .05). The combined results from
 steps 1-3 supported Hypotheses 4-5.

 To test Hypothesis 1, we regressed supervisor-

 rated employee job performance and fourth-quarter
 sales separately on employee creativity, together
 with control variables. Table 3 summarizes the
 HLM results. As Hypothesis 1 predicted, employee
 creativity had a positive relationship with both su-
 pervisor-rated employee job performance (7 = .84,
 p < .01) and fourth-quarter sales (7 = .55, p < .01).
 To test Hypotheses 2-5, we followed Baron and
 Kenny's (1986) procedure in HLM analysis. In step
 1, we regressed employee creative self-efficacy on
 employee learning orientation and transforma-
 tional leadership. In step 2, we regressed employee
 creativity on employee learning orientation and
 transformational leadership. In step 3, we regressed
 employee creativity on employee learning orienta-
 tion, transformational leadership, and employee
 creative self-efficacy. In all of the above analyses,
 we controlled for age, gender, education level,
 rank, company tenure, and insurance business ex-
 perience. For ease of presentation, Table 4 summa-
 rizes the main results with coefficients for control
 variables omitted. In step 1, employee learning ori-
 entation and transformational leadership emerged
 as significant predictors of employee creative self-
 efficacy (7 = .45, p < .01; 7 = .13, p < .05,

 To further test Hypotheses 4-5 (the two media-
 tion hypotheses), we performed the Sobel test,
 which provides a direct test of the indirect effect of
 an independent variable on the dependent variable
 through the mediator (MacKinnon, Lockwood,
 Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002; Preacher & Hayes,
 2004; Sobel, 1982). To perform the test, we em-
 ployed the bootstrapping approach, thereby mak-
 ing no assumption about the distribution of indi-
 rect effect and provides confidence intervals for the
 estimate (Preacher & Hayes, 2004; Shrout & Bolger,
 2002). Results indicated that the indirect effect of
 transformational leadership on employee creativity
 was .03 (p < .05; 95% CI: .01-08), and that of
 employee learning orientation on employee cre-
 ativity was .08 [p < .01; 95% CI: .02-.15). The
 results again supported Hypotheses 4 and 5.

 leadership and employee learning orientation on
 employee creativity using a better design than past
 studies; assess creative self efficacy as a mediator of
 the influence of transformational leadership and
 employee learning orientation on employee cre-
 ativity; and assess these relationships using a sam-
 ple from Taiwan, where the motivation for self-
 improvement is stronger than in Western nations.
 The results we obtained lead to three conclusions.
 First, employees' creativity relates positively to su-
 pervisory ratings of their job performance and to
 their sales. Second, an employee learning orienta-
 tion and transformational leadership predict em-
 ployee creativity, at least in a field setting involving
 actual leaders and their followers. Third, an em-
 ployee learning orientation and transformational
 leadership relate to employee creativity through
 their influence on employee creative self-efficacy.
 We now discuss how these empirically guided con-
 clusions extend the findings of prior studies.

 Conclusion 1: Effects of Employee Creativity on
 Employee Job Performance

 Whereas prior work has shown a positive rela-
 tionship between creativity and performance in an
 academic setting (for a review, see Gilson [2008]),
 we demonstrated this relationship within a corpo-
 rate setting. We also go beyond Oldham and Cum-
 mings's (1996) corporation-based study in three
 ways. First, we empirically tested the a priori hy-
 pothesis of the relationship between employee cre-
 ativity and job performance, unlike Oldham and
 Cummings (1996). Second, we included an objec-
 tive measure of employee job performance (i.e.,
 fourth-quarter sales) in addition to the subjective

 Conclusion 2: Effects of Employee Learning
 Orientation and Transformational Leadership on
 Employee Creativity

 The second of our conclusions extends the find-

 ings of Redmond et al. (1993), Jaussi and Dionne
 (2003), and Shin and Zhou (2003). Redmond et al.
 (1993) found no significant effect for learning ori-
 entation in their short-term experiment. Our study
 was a temporally lagged field investigation in
 which we found a significant effect for employee
 learning orientation. As noted earlier, this finding
 suggests that employee learning orientation is more
 likely to enhance employee creativity over time,
 because time is needed for an employee to explore,
 learn, and create. It may also be that an individual's
 actual learning orientation has a stronger effect on
 creativity than does an artificially derived (manip-
 ulated) learning orientation.

 Jaussi and Dionne (2003) found that transforma-

 tional leadership had no effect on individual cre-
 ativity. Likewise, the limited amount of interaction
 between the student subjects and a confederate
 leader in Jaussi and Dionne (2003) may account for
 their null results, thereby limiting the generaliz-
 ability of their findings. Our results are consistent
 with those of Shin and Zhou (2003) in their cross-
 sectional study and extend their conclusion to a
 sample of Taiwanese employees. Moreover, we im-
 prove upon Shin and Zhou's work (2003) by adopt-
 ing a temporally lagged design for measuring trans-
 formational leadership and employee creativity. In
 short, we conclude that transformational leader-
 ship is likely to enhance individual creativity over
 time and within a field setting that allows for gen-
 uine and repeated leader-subordinate interactions.

 Conclusion 3: Employee Creative Self-Efficacy as
 a Mediator

 The third of our conclusions extends Redmond

 et al. 's work (1993) by examining employee cre-
 ative self-efficacy as a mediator of the influence of
 employee learning orientation on creativity. Red-
 mond et al. (1993) did not provide such an exami-
 nation. Conclusion three also extends the work of
 Jaussi and Dionne (2003) and Shin and Zhou (2003)
 by examining employee creative self-efficacy as a
 mediator between transformational leadership and
 creativity. Specifically, we are the first to examine

 the mediating role of employee creative self-effi-
 cacy, thereby shedding light on the mechanism by
 which employee learning orientation and transfor-
 mational leadership impact employee creativity.

 facilitating conditions for the learning orientation
 to take hold and bring forth creativity. Managers
 can be instrumental here in terms of providing an
 environment that stimulates and nourishes creative
 self-efficacy, through, for example, applying trans-
 formational leadership principles.

 Redmond et al. (1993) examined mediators, Shin
 and Zhou (2003) found employee intrinsic motiva-
 tion to be a partial mediator between transforma-
 tional leadership and employee creativity. Our re-
 sults indicate that employee creative self-efficacy is
 a mediator. One potential explanation for this me-
 diating effect is that creative self-efficacy reflects
 knowledge and skills as well as intrinsic motivation
 to be creative. Hence, our contribution goes beyond
 those of past studies by including a mediating vari-
 able that reflects all three elements in Amabile's
 (1988) componential model (i.e., domain-relevant
 knowledge, creativity-relevant skills, and intrinsic
 motivation). By doing so, we reinforce the veracity of
 the componential model. In addition to intrinsic
 motivation, goal-based motivation may be set in
 motion by employee creative self-efficacy, because
 those who are high in creative self-efficacy may set
 higher creativity goals for themselves. Goal setting
 for creativity relates positively to actual creativity
 (Shalley, 1991, 1995). Employee intrinsic motiva-
 tion, on the other hand, is more narrowly focused
 on motivation based on interest and enjoyment
 (Shin & Zhou, 2003). Parsimony would suggest that
 Amabile's (1988) componential model be extended
 by treating creative self-efficacy as an overarching
 variable that nourishes creativity.

 Managerial Implications

 We have shown that employee creativity is likely

 to benefit organizations, reinforcing the practical
 value of research examining the antecedents of em-
 ployee creativity. This implies that managers can
 reap the benefits of employee creativity by select-
 ing for, or developing, creative individuals. Of
 course, we do not yet know whether the relation-
 ship between creativity and performance holds up
 in more routine, lower-discretion jobs (e.g., assem-
 bly line jobs) than the one studied here (i.e., sales).

 Our findings also suggest that organizations se-
 lect for, and develop, a learning orientation, partic-
 ularly for jobs that place a premium on creativity.
 Although Redmond et al.'s (1993) experimental
 study alluded to this idea in the absence of empir-
 ical support, our study provides that support, par-
 ticularly given our corporate setting. Managers
 need to be mindful that selecting employees on the
 basis of their learning orientation alone will not
 guarantee creativity. It is building the creative self-
 efficacy of their employees that will provide the

 Several managerial behaviors are likely to foster

 favorable conditions for the development of cre-
 ative self-efficacy. First, managers should serve as
 creative role models and verbally persuade em-
 ployees that they too can be creative. Second, man-
 agers may personally demonstrate, and instruct
 their employees on, creativity-relevant skills. This
 activity should be accompanied by provision of
 hands-on opportunities to apply these skills. These
 strategies should enhance employees' observa-
 tional and enactive mastery, thereby building their
 creative self-efficacy and creativity. Third, by offer-
 ing support and encouragement managers can alle-
 viate employee fear and anxiety that may arise from
 the uncertainty of creative endeavors. This support
 also should boost employees' creative self-efficacy.
 Prior studies have not clearly offered these sugges-
 tions because they either did not include transfor-
 mational leadership (Tierney & Farmer, 2002, 2004)
 or did not examine creative self-efficacy as a medi-
 ator (Jaussi & Dionne, 2003; Shin & Zhou, 2003).

 Limitations and Directions for Future Research

 First, we measured transformational leadership
 and employee creative self-efficacy at the same
 time point (time 2). We did so because some new
 hires needed time to observe and react to their
 supervisors' transformational leadership, and be-
 cause the company did not make it possible to use
 a different time point for measuring employee cre-
 ative self-efficacy. This limitation precludes our
 making any causal interpretation of the relation-
 ship between transformational leadership and em-
 ployee creative self-efficacy. Ultimately, a field ex-
 periment is needed to establish causality.

 Second, our temporally lagged design for trans-

 formational leadership and employee creativity
 cannot rule out the possibility that creative em-
 ployees bring out more transformational leadership
 behavior among their supervisors. Employee cre-
 ativity may already have been present when trans-
 formational leadership was measured. Testing this
 hypothesis more rigorously would require measur-
 ing employee creativity at multiple (at least two)
 points in time and analyzing the effect of transfor-
 mational leadership on employee creativity at time
 f , with the control of employee creativity at time t -
 1. An interesting research question is whether the
 causal order between transformational leadership

 and employee creativity can be reversed. The same
 issue of possible reverse causality also applies to
 the relationship between learning orientation and
 creative self-efficacy.

 Third, we cannot conclude that employee cre-
 ative self-efficacy exceeds employee intrinsic mo-
 tivation in explaining unique variance because we
 did not measure employee intrinsic motivation. In-
 trinsic motivation may be a rival explanation for
 our findings that we cannot empirically rule out. It
 is also possible that the findings attributed to em-
 ployee creative self-efficacy may be due at least in
 part to unmeasured employee intrinsic motivation.
 An interesting empirical question is whether em-
 ployee creative self-efficacy would still serve as a
 mediator if employee intrinsic motivation were in-
 cluded in the model.

 agents in one organization. This approach has the
 advantage of holding organizational and job con-
 text factors constant, but researchers should repli-
 cate our findings in other organizations and job
 categories. Because the theoretical ideas in this
 study can be broadly applied to creativity, we ex-
 pect that similar results will be found in other
 organizational and job settings. Seventh, our study
 was conducted in Taiwan. Future research should
 replicate the findings in other cultures. Finally, the
 respondents in this study had relatively low levels
 of education. Accordingly, replication of our study
 should probably involve a more highly educated
 sample.

 Fourth, we did not measure transactional leader-
 ship. We did not have empirical evidence to draw
 on as a guide in deciding whether or not to include
 supervisor transactional leadership. Other studies
 examining transformational leadership and indi-
 vidual creativity (Jaussi & Dionne, 2003; Shin &
 Zhou, 2003) have not included transactional lead-
 ership. Conceptually, transactional leadership may
 have some bearing on employee creativity. For ex-
 ample, if transactional leaders set a creativity goal
 and reward employees for achieving it (a contin-
 gent reward), employee creative performance may
 increase (Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001; Shalley,
 1991). The opposite may occur if transactional
 leaders reward other aspects of performance, such
 as product quantity. Transactional leadership the-
 ory in its current form does not clearly specify the
 range of reward contingencies. Future research may
 clarify such contingencies and examine their ef-
 fects on employee creativity accordingly.

 Fifth, we did not include employee performance
 orientation in this study. Performance orientation
 focuses on the judgment of existing competence
 (Dweck, 2000), and thus is conceptually unrelated
 to the acquisition of competence - an important
 factor affecting creativity. Conceptually, perfor-
 mance orientation has no clear implications for
 creative self-efficacy. It may or may not affect cre-
 ative self-efficacy depending on whether creative
 competence is being assessed and whether the as-
 sessment is positive, negative, or neutral. Further-
 more, there is considerable ambiguity and disagree-
 ment regarding the dimensionality of performance
 orientation (e.g., Button, Mathieu, & Zajac, 1996;
 Elliot & Church, 1997; Grant & Dweck, 2003;
 VandeWalle, Cron, & Slocum, 2001). Empirical
 testing may follow once the conceptual ambiguity
 is resolved.
