Abstract Drawing on risk mitigation theory, this article
examines whether the improvement of ﬁrms’ social per-
formance reduces debt ﬁnancing costs (CDFs) in China, the
world’s largest emerging market. Employing both the
ordinary least square (OLS) and the two-stage instrumental
variable regression methods, we ﬁnd that improved cor-
porate social responsibility (CSR) reduces the CDF when
ﬁrms’ CSR investment is lower than an optimal level;
however,
the CSR
investment exceeds the optimal level. Firms with extre-
mely low or extremely high CSR are subject to a higher
CDF. The results also suggest that the optimal CSR level
for small ﬁrms is higher than that for large ﬁrms. This study
is the ﬁrst to document a U-shaped relationship between
CSR and CDF and also the ﬁrst to investigate this rela-
tionship within an emerging market context.

Introduction

An important yet unresolved debate regarding corporate
social responsibility (CSR) is whether CSR investments
enhance shareholder value, or whether they represent a
costly diversion of scarce ﬁrm resources (Goss and Roberts
2009). Friedman (1970) claims that ﬁrms’ actions in accord
with social responsibility may reduce returns to their
stockholders; however, the stakeholder theory argues that
CSR can improve ﬁnancial performance since the success
of a ﬁrm depends on the extent to which it satisﬁes the
key stakeholders’ expectations. The literature on the link
between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate
ﬁnancial performance (CFP) provides mixed results
(Margolis and Walsh 2003; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Ullmann
1985, Zhang and Rezaee 2009). Although the majority of
the studies surveyed in Beurden and Gossling (2008) and
Margolis and Walsh (2003) document a positive relation-
ship between CSP and CFP, the 13 studies reviewed by
Ullmann (1985) do not ﬁnd clear evidence of positive
CSP–CFP link. Boyle et al. (1997), Brammer et al. (2006),
and Wright and Ferris (1997) even suggest a negative link
between CSP and CFP.

This article enters the debate by examining the impacts
of CSR on a key determinant of ﬁnancial performance—
the debt ﬁnancing cost (CDF). Debt ﬁnancing plays an
important role in ﬁrms’ external ﬁnancing and growth.
From 1993 to 2002 debt ﬁnancing accounted for 72% of
the external ﬁnancing among US-listed ﬁrms (Fama and
French 2005). Debt ﬁnancing also accounted for 79% of
the total external ﬁnancing in the United Kingdom, 66% in
Japan, 49% in Germany, 78% in France, and 41% in
Canada from 1970 to 1985 (Tirole 2006). Goss and Roberts
(2009) cite a statistic from Thomson Financial indicating
that the size of syndicated loan markets is four and a half

is critical

We examine the relationship between CSR and CDF
within the context of a particular component of CSR:
corporate philanthropy. Corporate philanthropy is an
important dimension of CSR (Brammer and Millington
2008; Godfrey 2005; Porter and Kramer 2002), and
provides a more valid proxy for CSR than other single-
dimension measures (Smith 1994; Saiia et al. 2003;
Brammer and Millington 2008; Peloza 2006). The volun-
tary and discretionary nature of corporate philanthropy can
also generate imputations of exemplary values or character
to the ﬁrm from its stakeholders (Godfrey 2005). Godfrey
(2005) suggests that corporate philanthropy can generate
positive moral capital among communities and stakehold-
ers, mitigate the negative assessments by stakeholders
following ﬁrms’ misconducts, and hence reduce ﬁrms’
business risk. We therefore use corporate philanthropy as
our measure of CSR for consistency with the theory
employed.

Drawing on risk mitigation theory, we posit

that
improved social performance can reduce business opera-
tion risks by generating positive moral capital among
stakeholders and by making ﬁrms less vulnerable to neg-
ative events. As operating risk is a primary driver of debt
capital costs, a reduction in business risk will lead to a
lower CDF. Using ﬁrm-level data from Chinese listed
ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that CSR is negatively related to CDF when
ﬁrms’ CSR investment is lower than an ‘‘optimal’’ level;
however, this relationship is reversed after CSR investment
exceeds the optimal level. This suggests a U-shaped rela-
tionship between CSR and CDF; ﬁrms with extremely high
or extremely low CSR are subject to a higher CDFs com-
pared to ﬁrms with moderate CSR. Our ﬁndings are robust
when we employ the instrumental variable approach to
address the potential endogeneity of the CSR measure. We
further document that the optimal CSR level is higher for
small ﬁrms than for large ﬁrms.

This study contributes to the extant literature in several
aspects. First, we conduct the relationship between CSR
and CDF within the context of corporate philanthropy,
which to our knowledge is the ﬁrst article that explores the
relationship between CDF and corporate philanthropy.
Sharfman and Fernando (2008) examine the relationship
between cost of capital and environmental risk manage-
ment, and Goss and Roberts (2009) explore the relationship
between cost of bank loans and an aggregate measure of
CSR. To our knowledge, no study has examined the
impacts of corporate philanthropy on CDF yet.

Second, our results suggest that the relationship between
CSR and the CDF is more complex than the simple

123

monotonic relationship prior studies suggest (e.g., Rich-
ardson and Welker 2001; Sharfman and Fernando 2008).
Although improved CSR leads to a lower CDF when ﬁrms’
CSR investment is below an optimal level, overinvestment
in CSR may harm ﬁrm performance by increasing CDF.
Assuming a simple monotonic relationship between CSP
and CDF may therefore generate misleading results.

Our third contribution comes from the examination of
the impact of ﬁrm size on the optimal level of CSR. Our
results document that the optimal CSR level varies with
ﬁrm size, suggesting that the ‘‘ideal’’ level of CSR depends
on ﬁrm characteristics, and that the beneﬁts of CSR are
context dependent.

Fourth, we conduct our analysis in the context of China,
the world’s largest developing market. Prior studies in this
ﬁeld are primarily conducted in the context of developed
markets, where the pressure for ﬁrms to meet stakeholder
expectations is potentially stronger than emerging markets
(Goss and Roberts 2009; Sharfman and Fernando 2008). The
results from the extant literature may not hold for developing
markets such as China where CSR awareness is compara-
tively low (Gao 2009; Li and Zhang 2010; Sharfman and
Fernando 2008). By extending the extant research to the
context of developing markets, we provide new insights on
the link between CSR and CDF. As debt ﬁnancing plays an
important role in China’s external ﬁnancing market, this
study also adds to our understanding of why Chinese ﬁrms
choose whether or not to engage in CSR.

The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. The
second section provides literature review and develops our
hypotheses. Third section describes our research design
and the data. Fourth section reports the empirical results
and ﬁfth section concludes.

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

Literature Review

Few studies have examined the link between CSR and
CDF. The prior literature primarily focuses on the impacts
of CSR on equity ﬁnancing cost. Mackey et al. (2007)
suggest that when a large number of equity investors prefer
investing in ﬁrms with good CSR reputations (e.g., social
responsibility investment), those ﬁrms may enjoy a lower
equity capital cost due to the increased demand for their
stocks. Dhaliwal et al. (2009) provide empirical evidences
for this argument. Using a sample of 196 US ﬁrms which
release stand-alone CSR reports, Dhaliwal et al. (2009) ﬁnd
that ﬁrms with comparatively superior social responsibility
performance enjoy a reduction in equity capital costs.
Other studies explore the relationship between environ-
mental management and equity capital costs. Using a


Corporate Social Responsibility and Cost of Debt

199

sample of ﬁrms drawn from the pulp and paper industry,
Spicer (1978) ﬁnds that ﬁrms with better pollution-control
records tend to have higher price/earnings ratios, and
therefore a lower equity capital cost. Garber and Hammitt
(1998) and Sharfman and Fernando (2008) also document a
negative relationship between improvements in environ-
mental risk management and equity capital cost; however,
Richardson and Welker (2001) ﬁnd a positive relationship
between corporate social disclosure and equity capital cost.
They suggest
that social disclosure may beneﬁt ﬁrms
through its effect on stakeholders other
than equity
investors.

Surprisingly few studies have examined the link
between CSR and CDF. As debt markets perceive risks
differently than equity markets (Sharfman and Fernando
2008), it is worthwhile to examine the link between CSR
and CDF given the importance of debt ﬁnancing for ﬁrm
growth. Sharfman and Fernando (2008) and Goss and
Roberts (2009) are the two studies most relevant to this
article. Sharfman and Fernando (2008) document a
positive relationship between environmental risk man-
agement and CDF for their sample of 267 US ﬁrms.
Goss and Roberts (2009), however, do not ﬁnd that
improved CSR signiﬁcantly reduces loan spreads using a
sample of 1,534 US ﬁrms from 1991 to 2006. These
mixed results may arise from the different
research
designs and samples used in the extant literature, calling
for more in-depth research into this area to determine the
impacts of CSR on CDF.

Hypothesis Development

We examine the impacts of CSR on CDF from the risk
management perspective. Corporate philanthropy and other
discretionary corporate social initiatives can generate a
positive reputation and subsequent positive moral capital
among communities and stakeholders if these social ini-
tiatives are judged to be made due to a genuine regard for
social welfare (Godfrey 2005).1 The positive moral capital
mitigates the negative assessments and resulting sanctions
by stakeholders following ﬁrms’ misconducts, making
ﬁrms less vulnerable to negative events (Godfrey 2005;

1 Godfrey (2005) also suggests that corporate philanthropy may
generate negative moral evaluation if the philanthropy is viewed as an
ingratiating attempt to win favor. However, a rational manager will
eventually abandon those unwise philanthropic projects. Hence,
corporate philanthropy made by rational managers will generally lead
to positive moral capital among stakeholders, at least for most of
them.

Peloza 2006; Zhang et al. 2010b). Bhattacharya and Sen
(2004) also suggest that investing in CSR helps to build a
reservoir of goodwill which leads to stakeholders’ resil-
ience to negative information about a company perceived
to be socially responsible. In addition, higher levels of CSR
help build more stable relations with the government and
the community, hence mitigate the risk of litigation and
government sanctions that would otherwise harm ﬁrm
proﬁtability in the future (Dhaliwal et al. 2009; McGuire
et al. 1988; Peloza 2006; Sharfman and Fernando 2008).
Firms with positive CSR reputations will therefore have
lower business risk.

Vanhamme and Grobben (2009) provide empirical evi-
dence for this argument by documenting that ﬁrms with a
long CSR history can counter the negative impact of a
crisis more effectively than ﬁrms with a short CSR history.
Examining 42 utility ﬁrms from developed markets, Bassen
et al. (2006) also ﬁnd that a lack of corporate responsibility
engagement exposes a ﬁrm to unnecessarily high risk. Lee
and Faff (2009) document
that ﬁrms with strong CSP
exhibit signiﬁcantly lower idiosyncratic risk. As CDF is
based on investors’ assessment of a ﬁrm’s expected busi-
ness risk (Sharfman and Fernando 2008), we expect that
ﬁrms with strong CSP will enjoy a lower CDF due to their
lower business risk.

Godfrey (2005) also suggests that there exists an opti-
mal level of CSR from the risk mitigation perspective.
Speciﬁcally, a ﬁrm’s social investments should not exceed
the optimal level required to fully insure the ﬁrm’s risky
assets against loss. Beyond the optimal level, additional
social
investments impose additional costs on the ﬁrm
without generating any corresponding insurance value.
Bartkus et al. (2002) also suggest
that managers may
overinvest in philanthropy for managerial self-interests at
the expense of shareholders and extreme high levels of
giving will
therefore not be accepted by stockholders.
That is, overinvestment in CSR beyond the optimal level
will generate negative net present value for a ﬁrm. As
ﬁrms’ investments in activities with negative net present
value increase ﬁrms’ business risk (Goss and Roberts
2009), we expect CDF to increase when CSR investments
exceed an optimal level.

Brammer and Millington (2008) also suggest that ﬁrms
with extremely high CSP perform better in the long run by
achieving differentiation in the eyes of important stake-
holders. However, the lenders in China are primarily short-
term oriented as around 78% of the bank loans in our
sample have the maturity periods equal to or less than
1 year, and Brammer and Millington (2008) suggest that in
the short-run ﬁrms with extremely low CSP will have
higher ﬁnancial performance. Therefore,
the lenders in
China may not value the long-run differentiation beneﬁts of
extremely high CSR.

Taken together, we predict that CDF ﬁrst declines, then
rises as CSR investment increases; ﬁrms with extremely
high or extremely low CSR have higher CDFs compared to
ﬁrms with moderate CSR investments. This leads to our
ﬁrst hypothesis:

H1 There is a U-shaped relationship between CSR and
debt ﬁnancing cost. The debt ﬁnancing cost is inversely
related to CSR for ﬁrms below the optimal CSR level, and
increases with CSR for ﬁrms exceeding the optimal CSR
level.

Godfrey (2005) suggests that CSR’s risk reduction effect
and therefore optimal CSR level will be greater for ﬁrms
with higher business risk, because these types of ﬁrms are
more vulnerable to negative events and the insurance
provided by CSR against crises will be more valuable.
Smaller ﬁrms have greater difﬁculty gaining access to key
resources, and are therefore more vulnerable to adverse
business events. As a ﬁrm grows it develops ties with a
variety of resource providers who contribute to its success,
resulting in a lower business risk (Richardson and Welker
2001; Stinchcombe 1965). The insurance provided by CSR
against crises will therefore not be so prominent for large
ﬁrms as for small ﬁrms.

Furthermore, Barnett (2007) argues that the ﬁnancial
beneﬁts arising from CSR vary with stakeholder inﬂuence
capacity (SIC), a construct that captures ﬁrms’ ability to
use CSR to proﬁtably improve relationships with key
stakeholders. Speciﬁcally, Barnett (2007) suggests that as
societal expectations of a ﬁrm’s social obligations increase,
all else being equal, ﬁrm’s SIC will decrease. Increasing
societal expectations about CSR enlarge the ‘‘hole’’ in the
‘‘bathtub’’ that holds the stock of SIC, thereby ﬁrms with
higher societal expectations will have lower SIC. Large
ﬁrms generally face higher societal expectations about their
CSP; hence a certain level of investment in CSR will lead
to a lower SIC stock in large ﬁrms than in small ﬁrms. The
lower stock of SIC dampens the ﬁnancial reward on CSR
investment for large ﬁrms. Bhattacharya and Sen (2004)
also reveal that consumers are more likely to make positive
attributions and have positive attitudes when the company
engaging in CSR is small rather than big.

Larger ﬁrms are also more transparent (Francis et al.
2008; Bushman et al. 2004), and therefore provide alter-
native sources of information about business risks than
smaller (and less transparent) ﬁrms, which reduces the
usefulness of CSR information in the assessment of large
ﬁrms’ business risks.

Taken together, we expect that small ﬁrms will beneﬁt
more from the insurance provided by CSR compared to
large ﬁrms, and hence the optimal level of CSR will be
higher for small ﬁrms than for large ﬁrms. This leads to our
second hypothesis:

123

H2 The optimal level of CSR will be higher for small
ﬁrms than for large ﬁrms.

Prior literature also documents that in a socialist econ-
omy such as China, the government often provides ﬁnan-
cial assistances to ailing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to
help them avoid bankruptcy, a phenomenon referred to as a
soft budget constraint (Chen et al. 2010; Lin and Tan
1999). The state therefore provides guarantee on the debt
instruments issued by SOEs (Wang et al. 2008; Tian and
Estrin 2007). This suggests that SOEs generally have a
lower downside business risk, and the insurance provided
by corporate philanthropy against crises will be less valu-
able for SOEs (Zhang et al. 2010a). This leads to our third
hypothesis:

H3 The optimal level of CSR will be lower for state-
owned ﬁrms than for private-owned ﬁrms.

As heavily leveraged ﬁrms generally have higher busi-
ness risk (Gebhardt et al. 2001; Anderson et al. 2004), we
expect the insurance beneﬁts provided by CSR will be
more valuable for high leverage ﬁrms compared to low
leverage ﬁrms. This leads to our fourth hypothesis:

H4 The optimal level of CSR will be higher for high
leverage ﬁrms than for low leverage ﬁrms.

Research Methods

CDF and CSR after controlling for other factors that may
affect the cost of debt ﬁnancing:

identiﬁers,

where CDF is debt ﬁnancing cost, and i and t are ﬁrm and
year
respectively. Following Francis et al.
(2005), we use the ratio of a ﬁrm’s interest expense to
interest-bearing debt outstanding as our measure of CDF.
CSR is our measure of CSP: the ratio of corporate chari-
table donations to sales. Our ﬁrst hypothesis predicts a
U-shaped relationship between CDF and CSR. This sug-
gests that superior CSR will reduce CDF (i.e., a1 should be
negative), but the negative effect of CSR on CDF is subject
to diminishing, and eventually decreasing returns (i.e., a2
should be positive).

Regarding control variables, prior literature suggests
that ﬁrm size, ﬁnancial
leverage, state ownership, and
industry membership also affect CDF (Gebhardt et al.
2001; Sharfman and Fernando 2008; Wang et al. 2008;


Corporate Social Responsibility and Cost of Debt

201

Tian and Estrin 2007). We therefore include the natural
logarithm of ﬁrm market capitalization (SIZE), the ratio of
debt to book value of equity (LEV), the percentage of
shares held by the state (STATEOWN), and industry
dummy variables (IND) as controls. We expect the coef-
ﬁcients on SIZE and STATEOWN to be negative as larger
ﬁrms and state-owned ﬁrms have lower business risk, and
the coefﬁcient on LEV to be positive as heavy leverage
increases ﬁrms’ business risk. We construct
industry
dummies using 1-digit CSRC (China Securities Regulatory
Commission) codes. The sample ﬁrms are classiﬁed into 13
industries: Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing, Construc-
tion, Transportation, Utilities, Trade, Finance, Real Estate,
Travel, IT, Publishing and Media, and Conglomerates.

As group member ﬁrms are more likely to get prefer-
ential interest rates from banks, we also include group
afﬁliation (GROUP) as a control variable. GROUP is a
dummy variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm is a member of a
business group and 0 otherwise. We include return on
assets (ROA) as our measure of ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance.
We expect a negative coefﬁcient on ROA as strong ﬁnan-
cial performance reduces ﬁrms’ business risk. We include
year dummies to complete Eq. 1.

Our second through fourth hypotheses suggest that ﬁrm
size, state ownership, and leverage affect the optimal level of
CSR. We employ Eq. 2 to examine these three hypotheses:

where SMALL is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm
lies in the bottom 25% of the rankings based on ﬁrm size,
and 0 otherwise. LARGE is a dummy variable equal to 1 if
the ﬁrm lies in the top 25% of the rankings based on ﬁrm
size, and 0 otherwise. STATE is a dummy variable equal to
1 if the percentage of shares held by the state exceeds 50%
and 0 otherwise. NSTATE is a dummy variable equal to 1 if
the percentage of shares held by the state is \50% and 0
otherwise. LLEV is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm
lies in the bottom 25% of the rankings based on ﬁrm
leverage and 0 otherwise. HLEV is a dummy variable equal
to 1 if the ﬁrm lies in the top 25% of the rankings based on
ﬁrm leverage and 0 otherwise. SIZE is a dummy variable
equal to 1 if the ﬁrm size is above the median and 0
otherwise. Other variables are deﬁned as in Eq. 1.

The optimal CSR level for small ﬁrms (b1) will there-
fore be  a1=2a3; and the optimal CSR level for large ﬁrms
(b2) is  a2=2a4: Hypothesis 2 predicts that b1 [ b2. Sim-
ilarly, the optimal CSR level for state-owned ﬁrms (b3) is
 a5=2a7; and that for private-owned ﬁrms (b4) is  a6=2a8:
Hypothesis 3 predicts that b3 \ b4.  a9=2a11 determines
the optimal CSR level for low leverage ﬁrms (b5), whereas
the optimal CSR level for high leverage ﬁrms (b6) is
 a10=2a12: Hypothesis 4 predicts b5 \ b6.

Data

We use the ratio of charitable giving to sales as our mea-
sure of CSR. We hand-collect charitable giving data from
ﬁrms’ annual reports. Financial and stock market infor-
mation is obtained from the China Stock Market and
Accounting Research (CSMAR) database.2 Our
initial
sample consists of all Chinese ﬁrms listed on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from
2007 to 2008. There are 1,682 and 1,770 ﬁrms listed on
these two exchanges in 2007 and 2008, respectively. We
require that all ﬁrms have available information to calcu-
late our empirical variables, reducing the sample size to
2,833 observations with 1,387 observations in 2007 and
1,446 in 2008.

Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of our empirical
measures as well as the correlation matrix. The average
donation to sales ratio is 0.06%, which is comparable to the
0.04% in Brammer and Millington (2008). The mean of the
CDF is 6.74%. Average state ownership is 23%, average
ﬁrm size 14.96, average leverage 1.48, and average ROA
3%. About 85% of sample ﬁrms are afﬁliated to business
groups.

The correlation matrix indicates that corporate philan-
thropy is positively related to ﬁrm proﬁtability, and nega-
tively related to leverage, consistent with Brammer and
Millington (2008). We also ﬁnd that corporate philanthropy
is negatively related to ﬁrm size, inconsistent with Bram-
mer and Millington (2008). As anticipated, CDF is nega-
tively associated with ﬁrm size, state ownership and
proﬁtability, and positively associated with ﬁrm leverage.
The correlation matrix also shows that corporate phi-
lanthropy is negatively related to CDF but statistically
insigniﬁcantly. Prior literature indicates that the relation-
ship between social and ﬁnancial performance is contin-
gent on a variety of contextual factors including ﬁrm size
and industry membership (Brammer and Millington 2008),
hence we need to interpret the correlation matrix results

gesting that potential multicollinearity is not a major
concern.

Empirical Results

Table 2 reports the estimation results of Eq. 1. The coef-
ﬁcient on CSR is signiﬁcantly negative (a1 = -7.982,
t = -8.771), and that on CSR2 is signiﬁcantly positive
(a2 = 11.193, t = 2.645). This suggests a U-shaped rela-
tionship between CSR and CDF consistent with H1. Based
on the regression results, we can yield the optimal CSR*
minimizing the CDF3:
CSR ¼ 7:982=ð11:193  2Þ ¼ 0:357

This suggests that CDF is negatively related to CSR
when the CSR level is \0.357, and is positively related to
CSR when the CSR level exceeds 0.357. We further par-
tition our sample into two groups based on the results of
Regression (1): the CSR underinvestment group (ﬁrms with
CSR levels \0.357) and the CSR overinvestment group
(ﬁrms with CSR levels [0.357). The Regressions (2) and
(3) in Table 2 show that the negative relationship between
CSR and CDF only holds for the CSR underinvestment
group, and CSR is positively related to CDF for the CSR
overinvestment group. This suggests that although a good
CSR reputation may reduce CDF when CSR levels are
lower than an optimal level, improved CSR may instead
lead to a higher CDF if CSR investments exceed the
optimal level. This further corroborates H1.

The R2 of Eq. 1 is quite low—around 7%. This suggests
that we may omit some important determinants of CDF,
which may lead to potential endogeneity problem. To

second degree derivative is positive (11.193 9 2 [ 0).

address such a concern, we also employ the two-stage
instrumental variable regression method in Table 4. Our
results remain valid when using the instrumental variable
method to estimate Eq. 1, indicating that our results are
robust to the potential endogeneity problem.

Regression (2) in Table 2 also indicates that one stan-
dard deviation increase in CSR can reduce CDF by 0.83%
(-6.877 9 0.12 = -0.83%) for the CSR underinvestment
group, equivalent to 12% of the average CDF for our
sample (0.83%/6.74% = 12%). This
is economically
signiﬁcant.

Both ﬁrm size and ﬁnancial performance are negatively
related to CDF as predicted by prior literature (Richardson
and Welker 2001; Sharfman and Fernando 2008; Stinch-
combe 1965). We do not ﬁnd that group member ﬁrms are
more likely to get preferential interest rates from banks.

Equation 2 examines the impacts of ﬁrm size, state
ownership, and leverage on the optimal level of CSR.
Table 3 shows the regression results of Eq. 2. a1 is
-42.786 (p \ 0.01), and a3 is 69.943 (p \ 0.01), implying
a U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF for small

cantly higher than that for large ﬁrms, b2 ¼  a2=2a4 ¼
1:517=2  8:250 ¼ 0:092 (a2 and a4 are also insigniﬁcant).
The joint test of a1 ¼ a2 and a3 ¼ a4 is rejected at the 1%
level, supporting Hypothesis 2.

a6 is -6.135 (p \ 0.05), and a8 is 15.253 (p \ 0.01),
implying a U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF
for private-owned ﬁrms. The optimal CSR level for pri-
vate-owned ﬁrms, b4 ¼  a6=2a8 ¼ 6:135=2  15:253 ¼
0:201; which is higher than that for state-owned ﬁrms,
b3 ¼  a5=2a7 ¼ 11:815=2  38:325 ¼ 0:154; but the dif-
ference between b4 and b3 is not signiﬁcant (the joint test
of a5 ¼ a6 and a7 ¼ a8 is not rejected at the 10% level),
suggesting that the optimal CSR level does not vary with
state ownership,
inconsistent with Hypothesis 3. The
optimal CSR level for state-owned ﬁrms may be smaller

due to their lower business risk; on the ﬂip side, the banks
may also have higher expectations toward the social per-
formance of state-owned ﬁrms, and tend to punish those
state-owned ﬁrms failing to fulﬁll their social responsibil-
ity, which leads to a higher optimal CSR level for state-
owned ﬁrms. These two mechanisms have opposite effects
on the optimal CSR level of state-owned ﬁrms, which
explains to some extent why no signiﬁcant relationship
between state ownership and optimal CSR level
is
documented.

however, suggesting an inverse U-shaped relationship
between CSR and CDF in the case of low leverage ﬁrms.
Low leverage ﬁrms with both extremely low and high CSR
will have lower debt cost. Although the ‘‘risk mitigation
hypothesis’’ proposed by Godfrey (2005) suggests a
U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF, Brammer
and Millington (2008) also suggest that ﬁrms with both
unusually high and low CSR have higher ﬁnancial per-
formance compared to other ﬁrms, which predicts an

inverse U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF. We
term this effect as the ‘‘ﬁnancial performance hypothesis.’’
As low leverage ﬁrms beneﬁt little from CSR investment
due to their lower business risk, the ‘‘ﬁnancial performance
effect’’ may dominate the ‘‘risk mitigation effect’’ and
thereby generates the documented inverse U-shaped rela-
tionship between CSR and CDF for low leverage ﬁrms.

As both the CSR measure and CDF may be determined
by some omitted variables, the ordinary least square (OLS)
results above may suffer from the potential endogeneity of
the CSR measure. We address this problem by employing
the instrumental variable approach to re-estimate Eq. 1.
Our instrumental variables are R&D intensity (R&D) and
advertising intensity (AD). R&D is deﬁned as the ratio of
intangible assets to total assets; AD is deﬁned as the ratio of
selling expenses to sales.4 Prior literature suggests that
more highly R&D and advertising intensive ﬁrms are more
likely to make donations (Brammer and Millington, 2008).

4 In China, ﬁrms do not report advertising expense separately. Hence,
we use selling expense as a proxy for advertising expense. Selling
expense mainly includes advertising expenditures, sales salaries, and
commissions. All
these fees are related to activities aimed at
promoting sales. Thus, selling expense is an appropriate measure of
ﬁrms’ advertising intensity (Zhang et al. 2010b).

In the ﬁrst stage, we regress CSR on R&D and advertising
intensity, and other exogenous variables. The predicted
value of CSR is then used on the right-hand side of the
Eq. 1. As some observations lack R&D and advertising
intensity data our sample size is reduced to 2,829. Table 4
reports the two-stage regression results. The results from
the ﬁrst stage regression document positive relationship
between CSR and R&D and advertising intensity as pre-
dicted by prior literature (Brammer and Millington 2008),
suggesting that R&D and advertising intensity are appro-
priate instrumental variables for CSR. The results from the
second stage regression show that CDF is negatively
related to CSR and is positively related to CSR2. This is
consistent with the predictions of H1, suggesting that our
results are robust to the instrumental variable approach.

We also include the ratio of long-term loans over total
loans to control for the impacts of a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancing
strategy on CDF. Unreported results suggest our main
results keep valid.

Prior literature has examined the impacts of CSR on CFP
from such perspectives as sales growth (Lev et al. 2010),
organizational commitment (Turker 2009), and improved
production efﬁciency (Porter and Linde 1995). This article
approaches the link between CSR and CFP from the per-
spective of CDF. Using ﬁrm-level data from Chinese stock
exchanges from 2007 to 2008, we ﬁnd that improved CSR
reduces CDF for CSR below an optimal level; however, the
impact of CSR on CDF is reversed when CSR exceeds the
optimal level. Firms with extremely low or extremely high
CSR levels are subject to higher CDF. This suggests that
the relationship between CSR and CDF is more complex
than the simple linear relationship suggested by prior
studies (e.g., Sharfman and Fernando 2008). The U-shaped
relationship between CSR and CDF revealed by our ﬁnd-
ings also suggests the existence of an ‘‘optimal’’ CSR level.
The results further indicate that the optimal CSR level
varies with ﬁrm size.

for

implications

Our ﬁndings offer useful

future
research. The extant literature generally assumes a mono-
tonic link between CSP and cost of debt capital (e.g.,
Sharfman and Fernando 2008). The U-shaped relationship
documented by our article suggests that a linear assumption
may mask the true relation between CSP and cost of debt
capital, leading to mixed or even misleading results. Future
research in this ﬁeld should be more cautious in developing
research design.

Our study also provides new insights on the link
between CSR and CDF by extending the extant research to
the context of developing markets. Prior studies in this ﬁeld
are primarily conducted in the context of developed mar-
kets, where ﬁrms primarily rely on private-controlled banks
to ﬁnance their debt capital needs. The results from the
extant literature may not hold for developing markets such
as China where the corporate debt is primarily ﬁnanced by
state-controlled banks (Tian and Estrin 2007; Chen et al.
2010). State-controlled banks are less concerned about
economic proﬁts and usually follow the strategic direction
of the government, such as full employment, poverty relief,
and environmental protection (Tian and Estrin 2007; Chen
et al. 2010), which suggests that state-controlled banks may
assign a larger weight to CSR information when they make
loan decisions than private-controlled banks. This can
explain to some extent why we document a signiﬁcant
relationship between CSR and CDF in China whereas Goss
and Roberts (2009) do not in the US.

The U-shaped relationship between CSR and CDF
also raises an interesting question why some ﬁrms operate
at
super-optimal CSR levels. We provide
three explanations for the U-shaped relationship between
CSR and CDF. Our ﬁrst explanation is based on ﬁrms’

sub- or

departures from the optimal level of CSR. The U-shape
suggests that the ﬁrms operating at sub-optimal CSR levels
can reduce CDF by improving CSP. As ﬁrms with extre-
mely low CSR are generally small and ﬁnancially under-
performing (Brammer and Millington 2008), however, they
may lack sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources to increase their
CSR levels. The U-shape also implies that the ﬁrms oper-
ating at super-optimal CSR levels can reduce debt cost by
investing less on CSR. However, Bartkus et al. (2002)
suggest that managers tend to overinvest in philanthropy
for managerial self-interests and therefore are reluctant to
reduce ﬁrms’ CSR levels. With the existence of both
resource constraint and agency conﬂicts, we expect that
some ﬁrms may not operate at the optimal level of CSR.
Our second explanation argues that ﬁrms depart from the
optimal CSR level from the lenders’ viewpoint because
different types of stakeholders have different optimal CSR
levels. For example, we ﬁnd a positive relationship between
equity ﬁnancing cost and CSR for Chinese listed ﬁrms
(Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient = 0.054, p value =
0.028), suggesting that stockholders may prefer a lower
optimal CSR level and therefore ﬁrms operate at sub-
optimal CSR levels.

Our third explanation assumes that all ﬁrms operate at
the optimal CSR levels which happen to be different for
each ﬁrm. The ﬁrms with higher CDF tend to be: (i) small
or (ii) highly risky. For the ﬁrst case, as societal expecta-
tion of a ﬁrm’s social obligations is positively related to
ﬁrm size (Brammer and Millington 2008), small ﬁrms
therefore should have lower CSR level. For the second
case, as highly risky ﬁrms will beneﬁt more from the
insurance provided by CSR, the optimal level of CSR will
be higher for those risky ﬁrms. Hence, the ﬁrms with
higher CDF will have either lower (for the ﬁrst case) or
higher (for the second case) CSR levels compared to the
ﬁrms with lower CDF, which will exhibit a U-shaped
relationship between CDF and CSR. As ﬁrms may operate
at or depart from the optimal
level of CSR, a more
appropriate explanation for the U-shaped relationship will
be a combination of the above three arguments.

it has several

Although this study sheds new light on the link between
limitations that may be
CSP and CFP,
addressed in future research. First, our research focuses only
on CDF and ignores other dimensions of CFP. The U-shaped
relationship may not hold for other dimensions of ﬁnancial
performance. Second, our research is conducted in the
context of China. Although China is an important develop-
ing market and provides sufﬁcient variation in ﬁrm CSR to
test our hypotheses, our results may not generalize to other
markets due to the great institutional and organizational
differences between markets. Future research may examine
the relationship between CSP and other dimensions of CFP

and conduct the research in other markets to better under-
stand the CSP–CFP link.
