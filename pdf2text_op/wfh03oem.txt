Aims: To investigate the role played by employees’ perceptions of their supervisors’ interactional styles
as a possible source of workplace stress that may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality
rates from cardiovascular disorders in workers in the lower strata of organisational hierarchies.
Methods: A controlled, quasi-experimental, field study of female healthcare assistants. Allocation to
the experimental and control groups was based on participants’ responses to a supervisor interactional
style questionnaire. Experimental participants (n = 13) reported working under two divergently
perceived supervisors at the same workplace, on different days. The control group (n = 15) worked
either under one supervisor, or two similarly perceived supervisors. Ambulatory blood pressure was
recorded every 30 minutes, over a 12 hour period for three days.
Results: The control group showed a 3 mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a non-
significant difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP; mean difference 1 mm Hg) between the two
supervisor conditions. The experimental group showed significantly higher SBP (15 mm Hg) and DBP
(7 mm Hg) when working under a less favoured compared to a favoured supervisor. The degree of
divergence in perceptions of supervisors shows a significant positive relation with the difference in
blood pressure between the two workdays. Divergence in perceptions of interpersonal fairness is the
strongest predictor of difference in blood pressure.
Conclusion: An unfavourably perceived supervisor is a potent workplace stressor, which might have
a clinically significant impact on supervisees’ cardiovascular functioning.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of

premature death in England and Wales, affecting 40% of
men and 30% of women.1 Approximately 50% of all CVD
deaths are from coronary heart disease (CHD), for example,
myocardial infarction. One of the most signiﬁcant risk factors
for CVD is hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140
mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg),
which is proposed to contribute to 13% of the risk for CHD.

Evidence indicates that individuals occupying the lowest
positions in organisational hierarchies show a three- to
fourfold risk for developing CHD.2 3 However, increased risk is
not conﬁned to those occupying the lowest hierarchical posi-
tions. In their 25 year follow up of the Whitehall I participants,
Marmot and Shipley4 found a strong negative correlation
between position in the hierarchy and mortality risk.

One of the major competing explanations for this inverse
relation between health status and occupational gradient is
the “social causation hypothesis”. This asserts that factors
associated with occupational status play a causative role in
undermining health status.5 There are three potential path-
ways of causation: (1) the indirect effect on health related
behaviours; (2) the “exposure and resource” paradigm,6 which
is synonymous with Townsend and Davidson’s7 “material
deprivation” explanation; and (3) the direct effects of psycho-
social factors.8 The latter includes job control,9 10 psychological
demands,11–13 and social support.14

More recently, there has been a synthesis of the exposure-
resource and psychosocial paradigms. This fusion of concep-
tions equates with Weber’s15 social action theory, which posits
that the unit of analysis should be the patterns of social inter-
action between individuals, patterns which are determined by
both structural factors (economic and status) and individual
factors (motivations, cognitions, and emotions). Inevitably,
societies, and by extension, organisations, have, to a greater or

lesser extent, a hierarchical structure. Thereby, discrepancies
arise between individuals’ needs and aspirations, and the
opportunities available to them.16 Individuals occupying the
lower strata of a hierarchy will tend to be those who are the
most constrained.

Freund17 contends that low status individuals are afﬂicted
with a “structurally in-built handicap” in their ability to man-
age social and emotional information. This “handicap” refers
to conventions of civility and deference, which translate into
“display rules” for emotional expression. These tend to foster
the suppression of negative emotions, which subsequently
leads to the dissociation of outward bodily expression (and
possibly conscious awareness) and inner physiological
reactivity.18

Stress and employee perceptions of supervisors

leadership, often evident in highly delineated occupational
hierarchies, are the most damaging to interpersonal relation-
ships. Higher status individuals may show contempt for their
subordinates, whilst subordinates respond with feelings of
anger, hostility, fear, and insecurity. One of the physiological
consequences of such recurrent negative affect is pronounced
increases in blood pressure.

Gabriel’s25 ﬁndings from his study of insults in organisa-
tions offers an explanation as to how and why contempt
manifests in exchanges with subordinates. He deﬁnes as
insults interpersonal behaviours that are perceived by their
recipient as slighting, humiliating, and offensive. These
include behaviours such as ingratitude, scapegoating, exclud-
ing, ignoring, and the despoiling of personal beliefs and ideas.
Gabriel argues that these behaviours are a regular feature of
organisational life, and that they are routinely employed by
some superiors as a means of subordinating employees and
reafﬁrming power relations through their emphasis on subor-
dinates’ helplessness and vulnerability.

It appears that supervisor interactions need not be overtly
insulting for them to erode subordinates’ self-esteem and cul-
minate in a plethora of anticipatory, consequential, and rumi-
native emotions. Subordinates’ lower social status renders
them structurally dependent on their supervisors for re-
sources and rewards.26 27 Consequently, subordinates are more
likely to monitor and ruminate over their interactions with
superiors in order to make assessments of relational trust and
their own status value.26 Vonk28 analysed the perceptions of
moderately dislikeable interpersonal behaviours between
actors of disparate relational social statuses. This showed that
when such unhelpful behaviours are enacted towards a
subordinate they are judged more negatively than those
towards a superior. Additionally, low status participants are
more likely to ruminate over minor breaches of courtesy by
their supervisors than are supervisors when courtesy is
breached by a subordinate.26 Even innocuous exchanges with
someone of higher social status have been shown to inﬂate
blood pressure much more so than is evidenced when
conversing with someone of equal status.29

We thus propose that the interactional style of higher status
individuals can impact on the cardiovascular functioning of
lower status group members though a number of different
pathways: (1) by affecting perceptions of control and predict-
ability; (2) by mediating the arousal of either pleasant or
unpleasant emotions; and (3) by diminishing the repertoire of
coping responses. The effect on resultant emotions is
exacerbated by the constraints imposed by the social structure
on emotional expression.30 While high status members are
relatively free to express negative emotions, low status mem-
bers are inclined to suppress them.31

The detrimental

impact on wellbeing of suppressing
negative affect is twofold. Firstly, it inhibits the use of active,
or problem focused, coping which can assist in resolving the
problem. This permits the provoking events to continue
unchallenged which may develop into persistent chronic
stressors. For example, with regard to coping with perceived
insults from a superior, resigned tolerance, as opposed to more
assertive responses (for example, demanding an apology or
seeking to retaliate), is a typical response from subordinates.25
Leaving insults unchallenged confers permission to the agent
to continue to engage in these interactional patterns.

Such passive responding is associated with signiﬁcant
increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.32 Addi-
tionally, continued exposure may result in generalised anxiety,
which if unabated may deteriorate into a sense of powerless-
ness, hopelessness, and depression. Prospective studies show
that relatively high levels of anxiety and depression often pre-
cede, and may be a predisposing factor for, the development of
hypertension.33

Secondly, it is suggested that risk for, and severity of, heart
disease is related to the tendency to withhold anger and irri-

tation with others. The suppression of anger is associated with
prolonged34
psychophysiological
reactivity,35 36 and increased risk of developing coronary heart
disease.37 38

exaggerated

and

This study focuses on the link between employees’ psycho-
physiological responsivity and perceptions of their supervi-
sors. It is a development of the “synthesised” social causation
hypothesis, which emphasises the relational social position of
employees in the workplace. We have examined the impact of
subordinates’ perceptions of their ﬁrst line supervisors’ inter-
actional styles as a mediating factor inﬂuencing their workday
blood pressure. We deﬁne supervisor interactional style as: the
manner in which information, meanings, and feelings are
conveyed to the subordinate through the communication of
both verbal and non-verbal messages. The instrument utilised
addresses four factorial dimensions of interactional style: con-
sideration, interpersonal fairness, social maturity, and em-
powerment. We argue that the emotional environment at
work is not wholly event speciﬁc, but is also context depend-
ent. That is, perceptions of the supervisor under whom the
individual is working, whether or not they are actually engag-
ing with the person, may inﬂuence their emotional state and
associated physiological reactivity based on ruminations of
their prior relational history.

It is hypothesised that employees’ perceptions of their
supervisors’ interactional style will impact on cardiovascular
functioning, as measured by variations in ambulatory blood
pressure when working with favourably or less favourably
appraised supervisors on different days. Since sustained
increases in blood pressure are associated with, and are
suggested as being a causative factor in the development of
cardiovascular disorders, supervisors may have potential for
inﬂuencing employees’ health.

The validity of subordinates’ perceptions as an indicator of
actual supervisor interactional style is drawn from investiga-
tions of the congruence of their perceptions with those of dif-
ferent subordinates at different points in time, supervisors’
peers,39 and supervisors’ superiors.40 Proponents who uphold
the view that subordinate appraisals of their supervisors are a
valid reﬂection of reality argue that such judgements have
been made from an informed perspective.41 That is, since sub-
ordinates are dependent on their supervisors for aspects of
their working conditions and prospects, they tend to invest

Hypotheses
(1) Signiﬁcant increases in ambulatory systolic and diastolic
blood pressures will be evident in the experimental group
when working under the less favourably perceived supervisor
compared to working under the positively perceived supervi-
sor.
(2) The experimental group will show signiﬁcantly greater
differences in their mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures
between the supervisor conditions compared to the control
group.
(3) Blood pressure will be signiﬁcantly higher
in the
experimental group when working in the less favourable
supervisor condition compared with blood pressure measured
on a non-work day.
(4) The degree of divergence between the participants’
perceptions of their supervisors will be positively related to the
difference in blood pressure evidenced between the supervisor
conditions.

Design
This investigation was a quasi-experimental ﬁeld study,
employing a within subjects design. Thus, the effect of
individual differences was eliminated. A control group of par-
ticipants was also included in order
to calculate the

signiﬁcance levels of the results. The design is believed to
overcome some of the problems associated with cross sectional
research in terms of determining causality.

This was a single blind investigation where neither the par-
ticipants nor their supervisors were informed of the precise
aim of the study. Participants were informed of the general
aim of the study. However, the speciﬁc details of its objective
were not made available either prior to, or at the conclusion of,
their participation. The rationale for this is threefold. Firstly,
this was done so as not to antagonise relations between
participants and their supervisors, and secondly, out of respect
for
the supervisors, who remained anonymous to the
researcher and thus whose consent was not sought. Finally, to
have informed participants of the precise aim would have
necessitated gaining the supervisors’ informed consent which,
even if possible, would have inevitably led to behavioural
changes in both parties, potentially confounding the data. This
practice is in accordance with the British Psychological
Society’s (1998) guidelines regarding economy of disclosure.

METHODOLOGY
Participants
Initially, 43 female healthcare assistants, aged between 18 and
45 years, were drawn from hospitals, nursing homes, and resi-
dential homes. Our decision to focus on healthcare assistants
was because of their relatively low hierarchical status, high
levels of reported work stress, and poor health.43 In addition it
was a necessity of our study design to ﬁnd an occupational
group who routinely worked under a number of different
supervisors in the same workplace setting.

A 49% attrition rate was incurred. Comparative analyses
were conducted in order to ascertain whether there were any
signiﬁcant differences between those who completed and
those who did not with respect to their responses to the survey
questions.

Selection of participants
Participants were selected from the pool of suitable respond-
ents from a larger survey. The samples were purposefully
selected. The experimental group (n = 13) was chosen on the
basis of their indication that they worked under two different
supervisors, of equal status, on different days, in the same
work environment, and of whom they held divergent percep-
tions. The criteria for inclusion was set at a minimum of 27
score points difference between the two supervisor descrip-
tions. This is the equivalent to a difference of one standard
deviation of a validation study of the Supervisor Interactional
Style Questionnaire.44 Participants were allocated to the
control group (n = 15) if they indicated that they either
worked under one supervisor or two very similar supervisors,
in the same workplace on different days.

Measures
Supervisor interactional style
This was assessed by means of the 47 item, self administered,
ﬁve point Likert-scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
agree) questionnaire.44 The items included statements such as:
“My supervisor encourages discussion before making a
decision”, and “I am treated fairly by my supervisor”. Calcula-
tion of internal consistency produced a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.9817, thus indicating highly satisfactory internal consist-
ency. The perceptions of supervisor interactional style are
positively related to the total score, with a possible range of
scores between 47 and 235.

Ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure
This was monitored at 30 minute intervals for up to 12 hours
a day for a period of one day in each of the following
conditions: working with the favourably perceived supervisor,
working with the less favourably perceived supervisor, and a

non-work day. All participants began monitoring on a
non-work day to gain familiarity with the equipment and to
establish baseline readings. There was no systematic alloca-
tion to either of the two supervisor conditions, which were
taken as they occurred. This resulted in a fairly even distribu-
tion between those who were ﬁrst monitored in either the
favourable or less favourable supervisor conditions. The appa-
ratus employed was an A&D TM 2430 24-hour ambulatory
monitor. Readings excluded from this analysis were those
taken when travelling and before and after work.

Activities at time of blood pressure reading were recorded
by means of a “quick response diary”. Participants were also
asked to record signiﬁcant events (both in the work and non-
work environments) and their mood states. Individual factors
such as alcohol consumption and environmental variables
(that is, abnormal occurrences during the day) were recorded
and considered as exclusion criteria if anomalous.

Need for social approval
The scale employed was the Revised Short-Form Martin-
Larsen’s45 Approval Motivation Scale (MLAM). This is a self
report measure of an individual’s non-pathological depend-
ency on the approval of others, which manifests as a marked
sensitivity to interpersonal transactions and a strong gravita-
tion toward afﬁliative behaviour.46 47 It consists of a ﬁve item,
seven point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly
agree). Calculation of internal consistency in the present sam-
ple of healthcare workers (n = 202) produced an alpha of
0.80. Thus internal reliability is considered satisfactory. The
total score is positively related to the level of need for social
approval, with a possible range of scores from 5 to 35.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Supervisor interactional style
The observed scores for the combined groups ranged from 63
to 234, resulting in a mean supervisor score of 172. The mean
favoured supervisor scores for the experimental and control
groups were almost equivalent; 200 and 193 respectively. The
mean scores for the less favoured supervisors were signiﬁ-
cantly different from the experimental and control groups;
125 and 190 respectively. Computation of an unrelated t test
between the experimental group’s less favoured supervisors’
score and the control group, revealed the observed difference
to be signiﬁcant to p < 0.017.

Blood pressure recordings
The means and standard deviations of workplace blood pres-
sure were calculated for each group of participants (see table
1). Similarly the mean and standard deviations were

calculated for the difference in blood pressure between the
supervisor conditions for each group. For the control group,
the workday readings showing the highest average systolic
pressure were used as the equivalent of the experimental
group’s less favourable supervisor condition.

Related t tests were computed for each of the two groups
separately, in order to determine the signiﬁcance levels of the
observed differences in blood pressures in the two supervisor
conditions (see table 2). The experimental group showed sig-
niﬁcantly higher systolic (mean difference = 15 mm Hg, SD =
11.9, 95% CI = 6.5 to 22.9, t = - 3.894, p = 0.001) and diasto-
lic (mean difference = 7 mm Hg, SD = 5.4, 95% CI = 1.5 to 12,
t = - 2.781, p = 0.008) blood pressure when working under a
less favoured supervisor compared to a favoured supervisor. In
contrast, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the control
group’s diastolic blood pressure (mean difference = 1 mm Hg,
SD = 1.8, 95% CI = - 1.1 to 3.1, t = 1.01, p = 0.33, NS). How-
ever, their average systolic pressure was slightly higher on one
of the workdays (mean difference = 3 mm Hg, SD = 3.2, 95%
CI = 1.88 to 4.3, t = - 4.53, p = 0.001).

Additionally, a one way, unrelated ANOVA was performed to
ascertain whether the observed increases in blood pressures in
the less favoured supervisor condition of the experimental
group were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the control
group on their workday with the highest average blood pres-
sure recordings. This indicated that the increases in the
experimental group’s systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were signiﬁcantly higher, by 12 mm Hg (F1,26 = 15.767,
p = 0.001) and 6 mm Hg (F1,26 = 4.769, p = 0.038) respec-
tively, compared with those of the control group. To determine
the effect size of the observed differences in blood pressure
between the two groups, the h
2 statistic was computed using
the harmonic mean sample size, since the sample sizes in the
two groups differed slightly. This produced h
2 = 0.356 for
systolic blood pressure and h
2 = 0.158 for diastolic blood pres-
sure. Both values indicate a large effect size as their value
exceeds 0.138.

Two simple linear regressions were conducted to determine
the efﬁcacy of the supervisor interactional style questionnaire
in predicting workplace blood pressure (see ﬁgs 1 and 2). The
difference between each participant’s questionnaire scores of
their two supervisors’ interactional styles was entered as the
independent variable and their difference in blood pressure
between the two workdays as the dependent variable. This
showed that the degree of difference in supervisor scores has
a signiﬁcant positive relation with the magnitude of difference
in both systolic (b = 0.580, SE = 8.35; F = 13.212; df = 1,17;

SE = 3.43; F = 20.120; df = 1,17; p = 0.0005).

and

Finally, correlational analyses were conducted to ascertain
which of
the four dimensions of perceived supervisor
behaviour provided the strongest predictor of the observed
alterations in blood pressure. This showed that the strongest
associations with both measures of blood pressure are with
the items pertaining to interpersonal fairness (SBP: r = 0.724,
p = 0.0001; DBP: r = 0.784, p = 0.0001).

The practical constraints,

imposed by the single blind
nature of the design, precluded random allocation of the par-
ticipants to the two supervisor conditions. Although the
participants were fairly evenly distributed between the two
supervisor conditions on the ﬁrst work day of blood pressure
monitoring, it remains possible that the results obtained may
have arisen because of order effects. For example, blood pres-
sure might have been consistently higher on the ﬁrst work day
in comparison to the second work day because of self-
consciousness. Thus, Wilcoxon signed rank tests were
performed to ascertain whether this phenomenon is a possible
confounding variable. For both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure the results of these calculations were non-signiﬁcant
(Z = - 0.33, p = 0.741; Z = - 0.296, p = 0.768, respectively).
Thus, we can be fairly conﬁdent that the results have not been
contaminated by this unavoidable limitation in the design.

One way unrelated ANOVAs were computed for supervisor
scores, reported anxiety, depressive symptoms, and “need for

withdrew from the study showed signiﬁcant differences in
these variables compared to those who completed the study

participants who withdrew from the study reported signiﬁ-

14.6 to 22.4, SD = 7.85) than those who completed the study
(mean = 13, 95% CI = 10.8 to 15.2, SD = 5.27) (F1,41 = 7.579,
p = 0.009).

DISCUSSION
Within group analyses for the experimental group indicated
that working under a less favourably perceived supervisor was
associated with signiﬁcant
increases in blood pressure,
compared with working under a favourably perceived supervi-
sor or measurements taken on a non-work day. Both
favourably perceived and less favourably perceived supervisors
worked in the same workplace on different days, were of the
same sex and status, but were divergently perceived by the
study participants.

The increments in the experimental group’s blood pressure
associated with working under a less favourably perceived
supervisor were found to be 12 mm Hg (systolic) and 6 mm Hg
(diastolic) over and above the slight increments shown by the
control group. The implications of this ﬁnding are not merely
of statistical signiﬁcance but also of clinical importance, since
an increase of 10 mm Hg systolic and 5 mm Hg diastolic blood
pressure is associated with a 16% and 38% increased risk of
CHD and stroke.48

Although the Supervisor Interactional Style Questionnaire
was completed an average of three weeks before physiological
monitoring,
this “paper and pencil” instrument shows
substantial efﬁcacy in terms of predicting workplace blood
pressure. The dimension revealing the greatest predictive
power is “interpersonal fairness”. This is deﬁned as the giving
of timely feedback (that is, particularly offering praise for a job
well done), demonstration of trust and respect, consistency
and non-partiality in the treatment of various staff members,
and the adoption of a ﬂexible approach according to each
employee’s individual needs. The two latter characteristics
may appear somewhat contradictory but are compatible with
the practice of equitable treatment, whereby each individual is
treated according to their particular needs.

Moreover, the increases in blood pressure associated with
the less favoured supervisor resulted in ﬁve of the 13 (38%) in
the experimental group showing hypertension (isolated
systolic (n = 3), isolated diastolic (n = 1), or a combination of
both (n = 1)). Additionally,
the control group
participants consistently showed workplace hypertension
across both workdays, despite having blood pressure readings
within the normal range on their non-work days. These ﬁnd-
ings support recent suggestions that occult workplace hyper-
tension is quite a prevalent phenomenon,49 50 the implications

of which necessitate consideration in the calculation and
management of coronary risk factors.

In addition, experimental group participants, but not
control participants, showed a non-signiﬁcant decrease in
diastolic blood pressure when working under a favoured
supervisor, compared to that found in the home environment
on a non-work day. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, it
might be tentatively interpreted as indicating that working
under a favoured supervisor has a beneﬁcial
impact on
employees’ wellbeing. Increases in diastolic blood pressure
have been found to be associated with subjective experiences
of anxiety.51 Consequently, this ﬁnding may suggest that when
employees ﬁnd themselves with a favoured supervisor they
experience a reduction in anxiety, which serves to lower
diastolic blood pressure.

It is possible that the observed increment in employees’
blood pressure when working under a less favourably
perceived supervisor is an underestimation of the true magni-
tude of the effect. Similarly, the observed decrement in the
experimental participants’ diastolic blood pressure when
working under the favoured supervisors may also have been
underrepresented. These putative underestimations may be
attributed to three limitations with regard to representative-
ness of the samples utilised and to the nature of the question-
naire.

Firstly, in this sample the long term impact of perceived
supervisor interactional style on blood pressure is moderated
by the fact that the participants work under a number of dif-
ferent supervisors. The detrimental effect of the less positive
supervisor is possibly ameliorated by the advantageous effect
of working under a positive supervisor on alternate days. Indi-
viduals working constantly under a supervisor perceived as
adopting an extreme authoritarian leadership style may
experience a further exaggeration and prolongation in blood
pressure increases because of alteration of the homoeostatic
set points of the physiological systems involved.52

Secondly, the beneﬁcial effect of the positively perceived
supervisors on participants’ diastolic blood pressure may not
have been fully captured because of the variation in the
control group’s supervisor scores. Although their average
supervisor scores were equivalent to those of the experimental
group’s “positive” supervisor, their range of scores was much
greater than those of the experimental group (that is, 63–234,
compared to 191–234, respectively). Thus, the true effect of
working under a positive supervisor may have been diluted in
the analysis because some of the control group participants
were actually working under fairly negatively perceived
supervisors.

Lastly, the healthcare workers who completed the monitor-
ing trial were a subgroup of the total sample since they
showed signiﬁcantly lower scores on the self reported measure
of “need for social approval” compared with those who with-
drew. We propose that this fact has precluded gaining data
from the very group of individuals who are arguably the most
sensitive to, and who consequently may have shown the
greatest physiological reactivity to, the interpersonal style of
their supervisors.

To clarify the above proposition a number of issues need to
be addressed. Approval dependent individuals are character-
ised as showing an excessive concern with perceived
criticism45 and disapproval from signiﬁcant others.53 This pre-
disposes these individuals to experience increased levels of
“internally generated stress”54 and exaggerated psychophysi-
ological reactivity.

Kuiper and Olinger55 propose that approval dependent indi-
viduals’ assessments of self worth are dependent on their
anticipated and interpreted evaluations by others of their
“self ”. Thus they tend to be strongly motivated to project a
favourable, conformist self image. In accordance with these
tendencies, those who withdrew from the study reported rela-
tively favourable interactions with their supervisors and low

levels of symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety. How-
ever, in spite of reporting favourable interactions, previous
research has found that approval dependent individuals tend
to be disliked by others.53 This would suggest that their actual,
as opposed to reported, interactions may be less favourable
compared to individuals showing a lower need for social
approval.

Additional characteristics of approval dependent persons
thought to be of relevance to our ﬁndings are their lack of
assertiveness and use of avoidant coping strategies.53 This
indicates that they are more likely to suppress negative emo-
tions and to leave interpersonal insults unchallenged. Both
characteristics are associated with increased vulnerability to
aversive interactions with superiors.

Furthermore, an underestimation of the full magnitude of
effect is also possible in light of the relatively subtle nature of
the items on the questionnaire. The scale does not assess overt
bullying behaviours. Items pertaining to this dimension were
removed during the pilot/validation study44 because of their
lack of discriminatory power, and to facilitate acceptability to
the host organisations. We believed it to be inappropriate and
unrealistic to recruit participants to the study who were expe-
riencing systematic bullying at work.

However, the prevalence of bullying, particularly within
public service occupations, presents a substantial problem
with associated health risks. For example, a survey conducted
by UNISON on a random sample of its members in 1996
revealed that two thirds of respondents reported either expe-
riencing or witnessing bullying.56 Similarly, a survey of health-
care personnel employed by a community NHS Trust in South
East England, in 1996, found that 38% of the employees
reported being bullied in the preceding 12 month period.57 The
most common form of bullying involves the abuse of power by
superiors against subordinates.56–61 In the UNISON survey 83%
of the bullies were managers, and in Quine’s57 survey 54% of
the agents were senior management or ﬁrst line managers.
Furthermore, Quine57 reports that the most likely victims of
bullying are unqualiﬁed residential care staff—that is, those
with the lowest occupational status and the population from
which the present sample was drawn.

The results here indicate a signiﬁcant clinical risk associated
with perceptions of
relatively innocuous, and possibly
inadvertent, interpersonal behaviours. However, it is plausible
that the implications would be more deleterious if indices of
actual bullying were to be taken into consideration.

The objective of the study was to investigate one putative
causal factor for the inverse occupational gradient in risk for
cardiovascular disorders. The ﬁnding that subordinates’ mere
perceptions of their supervisor are associated with signiﬁcant
changes in the subordinates’ blood pressure may indicate that
we have identiﬁed one psychosocial ingredient inﬂuencing
occupational health.

CONCLUSION
The Department of Health’s “Healthy Workplace Initiative”
(1999), identiﬁes the workplace as a key player in their drive
to improve public health. The role of work as a contributor to
the status of the population’s health is clearly acknowledged.
However, there appears to be a disjuncture between this
initiative and the recommendations inherent in the “National
Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease” (2000)
regarding the identiﬁcation of “at risk” populations. The latter
focuses on physiological and lifestyle factors, to the exclusion
of risks associated with the workplace.

While lifestyle factors contribute to this disparity, it seems
unlikely that they are the sole determinants. In light of greater
risk posed by low occupational status, in addition to that asso-
ciated with low socioeconomic status, an alternative approach
would be to tackle prominent workplace stressors, such as
social relationships between subordinates and those of higher

status. Supervisors are in positions of relative power within
the working environment. Inadvertently, their interactional
style may have the potential to inﬂuence supervisees’ wellbe-
ing, either positively or negatively. Where their behaviour
gives rise to supervisees perceiving them as acting unfairly or
unreasonably, this is likely to result in a decrement in supervi-
sees’ general emotional and physiological wellbeing.

We conclude that the above ﬁndings provide substantive
support to the proposition that supervisor interactional style is
a potential workplace stressor and a possible contributory risk
factor for the development of CHD. The ﬁndings imply that
creating a social milieu in the workplace characterised by fair-
ness, empowerment, and consideration is likely to provide one
inexpensive strategy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular
disorders, particularly for employees in the lower strata of the
organisational hierarchy.
