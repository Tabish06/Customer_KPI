 Amortization Policy for

 Advertising and Research and

 Development Expenditures

 MARK HIRSCHEY* AND JERRY J. WEYGANDTt

 Several reasons exist for differences between the value of the firm
 reflected by stock market values and the historical value reported in
 accounting financial statements. One major one is that financial state-
 ments are limited to those items that meet the present-day recognition
 criteria employed by the accounting profession. Thus, potentially rele-
 vant items such as advertising and research and development (R&D) are
 not reported on balance sheets because they do not meet the qualitative
 criterion of reliability. To date, little empirical evidence exists to support
 an intangible capital treatment of advertising and R&D, much less
 provide any information as to how their capitalized values might be
 amortized (for a notable exception, see Peles [1970]). Indeed, in State-
 ment of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, the FASB took the
 position that practically all R&D should be expensed as incurred. Al-
 though no formal reporting standard exists on the proper accounting for
 advertising expenditures, its accounting treatment is similar to that
 employed for R&D.

 Nevertheless, the definition of assets developed in Statement of Finan-
 cial Accounting Concepts No. 3 suggests that, in some cases, advertising
 and R&D could be capitalized. In addition, recent work on recognition
 criteria as part of the conceptual framework project suggests there may
 be new ways of reporting these types of items.

 This paper considers the advertising and R&D expenditure treatment

 issue from a market value perspective. The approach consists of deter-
 mining whether advertising and R&D expenditures have a positive effect
 on the market value of the firm. If they do, evidence would be present to
 suggest their accounting treatment as intangible assets to be amortized
 over their useful lives.

 Our results suggest that both advertising and R&D expenditures have
 systematic influences on the market value of the firm that persist over
 time, and therefore can be thought of as forms of intangible capital
 investment. These findings also provide a basis for determining a relevant
 range for economic amortization rates.

 First, the relevant accounting literature is reviewed, and a description
 of the market value approach is provided. Then, econometric issues are
 explored and a method for dealing with estimation problems is developed.
 And finally, empirically derived amortization rate estimates for advertis-
 ing and R&D are provided, as is a discussion of the limitations of the
 analysis and directions for future research.

 Review of Literature

 Amortization policy for advertising and R&D is a controversial subject
 as indicated by research in the accounting, economics, and marketing
 literatures.' Still, acceptance of the view of advertising and R&D as
 intangible assets seems to be increasing. Unfortunately, no real consensus
 has emerged on the duration of these intangible assets.

 In the accounting literature, Peles [1970] and Abdel-khalik [1975]
 found different amortization rates for the promotional costs of firms in
 different industries, and Falk and Miller [1977] reported nonuniform
 patterns of advertising amortization for individual firms in the same
 industry. Perhaps it is not surprising that Picconi [1977, p. 317] remarks
 that, "Despite findings which clearly suggest that there may be long-
 lived advertising assets in some industries, it is troublesome that even
 among the most heavily advertised products, a systematic relationship
 between advertising/sales or market share cannot consistently be found."

 The difficulty may be due, in part, to the reliance on simple distributed

 lag models relating, for example, sales and advertising expenditures. As
 Clarke [1976] points out, distributed lag models are especially susceptible
 to data interval bias. Peles [1979] argues that simple distributed lag
 models between sales and a firm's own level of advertising are subject to
 important omitted variables problems. Both Clarke and Peles recommend
 that alternative approaches be sought.

 In this paper, we conduct a market-value-based investigation of adver-
 tising and R&D as intangible capital. In the economics literature,
 Thomadakis [1977], Lindenberg and Ross [1981], and Hirschey and
 Wichern [1984], among others, have argued that the market (economic)

 value of the firm will reflect both tangible and intangible factors which
 have systematic influences on future profitability. Ross [1983] recom-
 mends a market-value-based approach as an attractive means for deter-
 mining the assetlike characteristics of advertising, R&D, and other such
 expenditures.

 Accounting Versus Market Values

 The market value of the firm can be expressed as:

 MV(F) = MV(T) + MV(I), (1)

 where MV(F) is market value, and MV(T) and MV(I) are the capitalized
 values of profits attributable to tangible and intangible assets, respec-
 tively.2

 While the market value of the firm is observable, subcomponents
 MV(T) and MV(I) are not. However, accounting book values and
 replacement cost values can be viewed as useful, though imperfect,
 measures of the market value of tangible assets. Using these accounting
 data, one can in principal isolate the market value effects of tangible
 assets from any additional influences of intangible assets such as good-
 will, market power, brand loyalty, patents, etc.

 One approach involves using a measure commonly referred to as the

 "Q ratio" where:

 Q MV(F) 2

 RC(T)' (2)

 and RC(T) is the replacement cost of tangible assets (see Tobin
 [1978]). Ignoring measurement errors, a value of Q greater than one
 indicates valuable intangible assets not reflected in replacement cost
 data. Therefore, by considering the effects of advertising and R&D on Q.
 we can learn whether or not such expenditures give rise to intangible
 capital. Since MV(T) = RC(T) + e, for testing purposes:

 MV(I) + e,

 = f1(AD, R&D, X) + e,

 where AD is advertising, R&D is research and development, and X is a
 vector of additional factors which influence Q.

 Interestingly, Ross has argued that it is obvious from a casual obser-

 2 With respect to advertising and R&D, any intangible capital influence is due, in part,

 to what we call the tax effect. Being able to expense their intangible investments, firms
 which invest in advertising and R&D will gain an immediate tax deduction, and by virtue
 of that fact will gain a pecuniary advantage over firms which invest largely in tangible
 assets that must be capitalized. In the case of a constantly growing firm, the current
 expense treatment of advertising and R&D will lead to a permanent tax forgiveness.

 vation of recent data that there is a strong relation between Q and the
 level of firm advertising. Specifically,

 As a wholly unscientific illustration, the highest Q in the [Lindenberg and Ross] sample
 was attained by Avon Products with a Q of 8.5. In large part this must reflect the value of
 the public's recognition of the slogan "Avon calling!". As another example, Coca-Cola had
 a Q of over four. Clearly, not all of the past advertising of these firms has been forgotten.
 (Ross [1983, p. 378].)

 Of further interest is that among the five industry groups cited by
 Lindenberg and Ross as having the highest average Q ratios over the
 1960-77 period, a propensity for high levels of R&D can also be noted.
 For example, Measure and Photo Equipment (SIC code 30), Chemicals
 (28), Electrical Machinery (36) and Nonelectrical Machinery (35) all
 have high Q levels, and are also among the most R&D intensive of all
 industry groups. Thus, the Lindenberg and Ross data suggests that Q
 may be related to R&D as well as advertising.

 Econometric Model

 To isolate the marginal valuation influences of advertising and R&D
 one must control for other X important factors. One potential influence
 to be controlled for is market structure, as captured by the four firm
 concentration ratio data (see Lindenberg and Ross [1981]). These data
 reflect the market share held by the top four firms in an industry (see
 Appendix A for further discussion). To the extent that high levels of
 concentration indicate sustainable market power and an ability to restrict
 output, continued output restriction will lead to economic rates of return
 above competitively determined long-run equilibrium levels. If investors
 perceive lasting market power, the value of the firm will be bid up so
 that ex post investors receive only a risk-adjusted normal rate of return.
 Thus, higher market values will be observed where market power is
 sustainable. In addition, if future investments are expected to earn above
 normal rates of return, and if exogenous growth is an important deter-
 minant of these returns, then growth will have a positive effect on market
 values (see Miller and Modigliani [1961]). And finally, while growth
 affects the magnitude of anticipated excess returns, a valuation influence
 may be associated with the degree of stability such returns exhibit. One
 would expect that the risk of future excess returns would affect market
 value in that highly variable return streams will tend to be less valued,
 ceteris paribus (see Thomadakis [1977]).

 Thus, the simplest model relating the market value of the firm to

 normalized advertising and R&D expenditures can be written:

 Q = ao + alAD/S + a2R&D/S + a3CR+a4GR + a5B + e, (4)

 where Q is the ratio of market value to replacement costs, AD/S is
 advertising intensity, R&D/S is R&D intensity, CR is the four-firm

 concentration ratio measure of market structure, GR is growth, and B is
 the stock price beta measure of risk.

 While previous studies have estimated models similar to that given in
 (4), such estimation may be subject to both multicollinearity and simul-
 taneous equations bias problems (see Strickland and Weiss [1976]). Since
 the complete structure of the underlying simultaneous system, if any, is
 unknown, we control for possible correlations between advertising inten-
 sity and concentration, and/or R&D intensity and concentration using a
 two-step approach. First, we estimate the concentration effects of adver-
 tising and R&D intensity. This yields a predicted value for concentration,
 OR, where:

 CR = bo + biAD/S + b2R&D/S + e. (5)

 Then, residual concentration, CR = CR - CR, which is orthogonal with
 respect to both advertising and R&D intensity, is inserted in our model,
 yielding:

 Q = co + cADIS + c2R&D/S + c3CR + c4GR + c5B + e. (6)

 Estimation

 Ordinary least squares results for our model over a 390-firm sample

 taken from the 1977 Fortune 500 survey are provided in table 1. This
 sample, described more fully in Appendix A, is attractive in that it is
 representative of firms from a broad spectrum of U.S. industry. Estimates
 using three samples of firms are reported.

 AMORTIZATION POLICY FOR ADVERTISING 331

 Estimation results for the overall sample suggest an important effect

 of both advertising and R&D on the market value of the firm. Specifically,
 a one-unit increase in advertising and R&D intensity will lead to large,
 consistent, positive effects on Q. This implies that a portion of current
 period advertising and R&D carries over to subsequent periods and
 suggests that a capitalization and amortization rather than current
 expense treatment is appropriate in most situations.

 As found by Peles [1970] and Abdel-khalik [1975], important differ-
 ences in advertising effectiveness between nondurable (ND) versus du-
 rable (D) goods producers may be present. Indeed, we can reject the
 hypothesis of no subsample differences, Ho: C1ND = C1D, C2ND = C2D, * ..
 CkND = CkD, at the a = .05 level (F = 2.18 > F6 378 = 2.10). These subsample
 differences suggest that whereas the valuation effects of R&D are fairly
 regular and consistent, long-lived effects of advertising may be narrowly
 related to the promotion of nondurable goods.3

 Estimating Economic Amortization Rates

 Moving from an expense to a capitalization treatment of intangibles
 requires estimation of an appropriate rate of amortization. Hirschey
 [1982] shows that if the economic amortization of advertising and R&D
 is at a constant rate of, say, a% per period, then:

 ICt= A (1 - a)It-i,

 i=O

 = (1 - a)OIto + E (1 - a)It-i, (7)

 i=1

 =It + (1 - a)ICti1.

 Here It refers to the flow of advertising and R&D expenditures during
 period t, whereas ICt is the current stock of intangible capital created by
 such expenditures.

 If 0 < a < 1, then a portion of advertising and R&D expenditures
 carry over to subsequent periods and constitute investments in intangible
 capital. On the other hand, if a = 1, then advertising and R&D provide
 benefits in the current period only and should be expensed rather than
 capitalized.

 The effect of expenditure growth (net investment) over time can
 easily be incorporated into the analysis. Where advertising and R&D
 expenditures grow at a constant rate of y % per period, It = Io(l + ,y) t

 3 Similar results were also obtained when Thomadakis' relative excess valuation measure
 was used as an alternative to Q. Relative excess valuation is market value less the book
 value of tangible assets, all normalized by sales. This suggests that either method might be
 relied on to provide relevant information on the long-lived effects of advertising, R&D, and
 other expenditures with similar characteristics.

 Then from (7) we obtain:

 ICt= E (1 - a)Io(l + y)t-i,

 i=O

 - E (1 - a)It(l + y) (8)

 i=O

 =It E(1+o)
 - ~i=0 + '

 Since (1 - y)/(l + y) < 1, we can apply the power series rule and

 simplify to yield:

 ICt = It1

 1- -

 1 1+ 'J (9)

 = it( ) a + y

 Thus, given our assumptions, a constant and proportional relation ICt =
 cIt would exist between the stock of intangible capital and the flow
 of advertising and R&D expenditures, and the constant c = (1 + y)/
 (a + y). This proportionality is important because it allows us to consider
 the valuation effects of observable advertising and R&D expenditures as
 reflective of the effects of unobservable intangible capital. That is, dQ/
 SAD/S = Ci and dQ/IR&D/S = Cj, and i 1 j. An economic amortization
 rate estimate is provided by the expression:

 l+ Ay-y (10)

 C

 It is expected that estimated advertising amortization, ai, and R&D
 amortization, aj, rates will vary following differences in the economic
 characteristics of each type of expenditure. Given c's obtained through
 analysis of an underlying econometric model and iy's provided by histor-
 ical experience, at's become readily available. It is important to note that
 amortization is only appropriate to the extent that c> 1 and C& > 1, for
 only then will 0 ' & < 1 and 0 c &j < 1.

 Estimates of economic amortization rates for both advertising and

 R&D are provided in table 2. Given the ci's generally in excess of unity
 which were evident in table 1, a's of less than 100% are suggested. In
 particular, the large valuation effects of R&D expenditures suggest fairly
 low rates of economic amortization for R&D. As can be seen from table
 2, a's will vary depending upon a firm's sector and the relevant expen-
 diture growth rate. Thus, a 's should be taken as generally indicative of
 the economically relevant order of magnitude, rather than as narrowly

 indicative of individual firm values. R&D amortization rate estimates
 generally fall in the 10 to 20% range. More modest, and somewhat more
 variable, valuation effects of advertising expenditures suggest economic
 amortization for advertising in the 10 to 20% range in the nondurable
 goods sector, and 30 to 60% range in the durable goods sector.

 Concluding Remarks

 In this paper we provide a basis for determining the extent to which

 advertising and R&D have long-lived benefits. Given our estimate of the
 average size of market value effects, we then derive tentative estimates
 of economic amortization rates.

 Our results show a positive effect of advertising and R&D on the

 market value of the firm, thereby suggesting these expenditures should
 be capitalized and then amortized rather than treated as an expense as
 incurred. While our results suggest a one- to five-year "life" for advertis-
 ing and a five- to ten-year life for R&D, we believe further research on
 the factors affecting these estimates is necessary before sufficient infor-
 mation is available to develop an appropriate accounting policy. Further
 research considering the sensitivity of market value effects to industry
 and product characteristics, the expenditure patterns of rivals, and a
 more detailed treatment of simultaneous influences would increase the
 precision of economic life and amortization rate estimates.

 APPENDIX A

 The Fortune 500 for 1977 was adopted as a sample basis for this study.

 Complete data were obtained on a representative sample of 390 firms from 20
 product groups. Approximately $5.0 billion in national media advertising and
 $15.2 billion in R&D were undertaken by sample firms. A broader coverage of
 private sector R&D (87.3%) than of national media advertising (23.9%) is
 provided because the Fortune 500 excludes retailers, many of whom (Sears,
 McDonalds, etc.) are major advertisers. Nevertheless, coverage of both is high.
 The fact that the sample includes firms which both do and do not spend
 substantial sums on advertising and R&D is an attractive feature.

 The market value of the firm is measured by the sum of the market value of

 common stock and the book value of debt. Ideally, we would have included the
 market values of each. However, the market value of debt is difficult to obtain,
 and we believe our measure of market value is a good approximation. Components
 used to calculate the market value of common shares, number of shares, and
 closing prices (12/31/77) were obtained from Standard and Poor's Compustat
 tapes. The book value of debt was calculated using Fortune data. Q is calculated
 as the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of tangible
 assets. Replacement cost data were obtained from annual 10-K reports to the
 Securities and Exchange Commission, whereas sales and the (historical cost)
 book value of tangible assets data were obtained from Fortune.

 All advertising data have Leading National Advertisers as their source, while
 R&D expenditures were obtained from Business Week. Four-firm concentration
 ratios weighted to reflect firm sales in various four-digit and census industries
 were originally compiled by Economic Information Systems Inc. and generously
 made available to this study by Kenneth M. Harlan. See Hirschey [1982] for a
 detailed description. Growth is measured as the average annual rate of change in
 sales where GR = 51S1977/1972 - 1. And finally, risk is measured by stock price
 betas estimated using 60 observations of monthly data obtained from Value Line.
