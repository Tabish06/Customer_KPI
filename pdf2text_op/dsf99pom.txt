1.  Introduction 

Quality  management principles and techniques are now a well accepted part of almost 
every  manager’s “tool  kit.”  Most  large firms have  “adopted  total  quality  management 
in some form”  (Powell  1995, p.  15),  and official  quality  awards are a badge of 
(TQM) 
honor whether a company is operating in Japan (The  Deming Prize),  the United  States 
(The  Malcolm  Baldrige  Quality  Award),  Europe  (The  European Quality  Award),  or 
Australia  (The  Australian  Quality  Award). 

In parallel to this trend among practitioners, a plethora of prescriptive  quality  manage- 
ment literature  has also emerged (see Flynn,  Schroeder, and Sakakibara  1994; Powell 
1995 for summaries of this literature).  Each quality  management guru invariably  identifies 
a set of  “key  practices”  that they  claim are essential to achieving  superior quality  out- 
comes. The number of  critical  elements range from  Juran’s (1992,  p.  14)  “trilogy” 
of 
managerial processes to Deming’s (Walton  1989, p. 34)  “14  points.”  While  these claims 
are seldom accompanied by  rigorous supporting evidence, they  do have some degree of 
face validity.  Within  the Australian  context,  the leading practitioners  of  “quality  man-

These more rigorous  studies, though  few  in  number, indicate  a strong positive  rela- 
tionship between quality  management practices (when  measured as a single construct) 
and firm  performance.  However,  these findings  are not  without  some limitations.  The 
most obvious of  the limitations  is the small sample sizes employed. With  the exception 
of the AMC  survey, the useable sample sizes range from  20 companies in Saraph, Benson, 
and Schroeder’s (1989)  survey,  to 54 companies for  Powell (1995).  These small sample 
sizes essentially constrain the choice of analytic  techniques to procedures such as Pearson 
correlations and simple regression models. It  also raises the issue of how truly  represen- 
tative  these samples are of  the wider population  of firms. 

A  more subtle limitation  of both the empirical and prescriptive  literature is the choice 
of dimensions that best characterize the broad range of quality  management practices. A 
simple illustration  of  this  is the  implicit  debate over  the  number of  dimensions. Juran 
(1992,  p.  14)  prescribes his  trilogy  of  managerial processes. Krafcik  and MacDuffie 
( 1989) also divide  their  “management  index” 
into  three specific indices, but they  are 
very  different  in  content from  Juran’s. Price  and Chen (1993,  p.  97)  put  forward  their 
four key  elements of TQM,  while the Baldrige  Award  (Garvin  1991) divides quality  man- 
agement practices into  six categories. Segmenting the practices even more finely,  Flynn, 
Schroeder, and Sakakibara (1994,  p.  344)  identify  seven “core  dimensions,”  Saraph, 
Benson, and Schroeder (1989,  p. 816) cite eight  “critical 
factors,”  the AMC  (1994)  em- 
ploys nine “practice  indices,”  and Powell (1995,  p.  24)  settles on 12 variables “based 
literature.”  Not  to be forgotten,  two  of the doyens of 
on a exhaustive review  of the TQM 
quality  management, Deming  and  Crosby,  each  prescribe their  own  14  “steps”  or 
“points” 
(Crosby  1979, pp.  132-139;  Walton  1989, p. 34).  Obviously  there is a great 
deal of  overlap and similarity  among the content of  these prescriptions. But  the problem 
still remains, what is the best method for grouping and characterizing such a broad selec- 
tion  of quality  management practices? 

In their  empirical investigations of quality  management practices Saraph, Benson, and 
Schroeder ( 1989),  Krafcik  and MacDuffie  ( 1989),  Flynn,  Schroeder, and Sakakibara 
( 1994),  AMC  ( 1994),  and Powell  ( 1995)  all defined their  primary  dimensions on an a 
priori  basis. Employing  existing theory  to define the dimensions is an acceptable practice 
when the theorists are in general agreement, but that does not appear to be the case here. 
It  is this ambiguity  in  the existing  literature  that  has driven  us to  adopt an exploratory 
approach in our scale development, rather than relying  on an a priori  specification of the 
key  dimensions. 

Once the number and content of the dimensions that best describe quality  management 
practices have been resolved, another basic issue regarding the quality  practice-quality 
outcome relationship needs to be explored.  Powell  ( 1995) highlights  the problem with 
his hypotheses four  through  15. Do  all  of  the quality  management practice  dimensions 
truly  contribute  to  the observed relationship? A  fundamental assumption in virtually  all 
of  the  quality  management literature  is  the  interdependence of  the  practices.  Flynn, 
Schroeder, and Sakakibara (1994,  p. 342)  define quality  management as “an  integrated 
approach.”  Kano (1993)  uses the “House  of TQM"  analogy to illustrate  the idea that if 
any  of  the  ‘ ‘TQM 
tools”  are removed,  the  “roof  ”  (customer  satisfaction and quality 
assurance) is in danger of collapsing. Belohlav  (1993,  p. 66)  describes total quality  as a 
“unified  process.” 

This assumption of interdependence implies that it  is the joint  variance  of the quality 
practices that creates superior quality  outcomes. This attitude is reflected in the method- 
ologies of  Saraph, Benson, and Schroeder ( 1989),  Krafcik  and MacDuffie  ( 1989),  the 
AMC  ( 1994),  and Flynn,  Schroeder, and Sakakibara ( 1994).  After  defining  a variety  of 
quality  practice dimensions, each set of  authors combines the practices into  a single con-

struct.  That  single construct is then correlated  with  superior performance. Krafcik  and 
MacDuffie  (1989,  p. 9)  are quite explicit  about this:  “We  combine these three groups of 
variables into  a single Management Index  because we believe  they  capture three inter- 
dependent parts of the overall  production  system in a plant.” 

Powell  ( 1995) was the first researcher to seriously challenge this assertion. His empir- 
ical  results indicate that  the  “interdependence  assumption”  may  be erroneous. Powell 
found that only  three of  his 12 quality  practice  variables are significantly  related to total 
firm performance. He concludes by  suggesting that firms may be able to capture much of 
the benefit  without  subscribing to  the full  “TQM 
ideology.”  The  analyses presented in 
this paper pick up on that theme and begin to question in a more comprehensive manner 
whether all the quality  management practices do truly  contribute  to superior quality  out- 
comes. 

3.  Research Questions and Hypotheses 

Our review  of the literature  leads to two research questions regarding quality  manage- 
ment practices: what are the main dimensions of  quality  management practices and how 
do these practices interact  to produce superior quality  outcomes? The  first  of  these two 
questions is largely  exploratory  and, thus, is not amenable to developing a set of testable 
hypotheses. For  this reason, the  survey  data has been split  into  calibration  and cross- 
validation  subsamples. The calibration  subsample is used to empirically  identify  key  di- 
mensions. The cross-validation sample is then used to validate those findings. 

The second research question is confirmatory  in  nature and can be broken into  a se- 
quence of  specific hypotheses. The  first  hypothesis is a relatively  straightforward,  but 
necessary, precondition.  It  concerns whether  the various quality  management practices 
are implemented in unison, as prescribed by  the literature. 

HYPOTHESIS  1.  The main quality  management practice dimensions (as identified in the 
exploratory  phase) are usually implemented in combination, and, thus, the degree to which 
each is implemented is highly  correlated with  the implementation of the other practices. 
If  this first hypothesis is supported, then the subsequent hypotheses, which are of more 
substantive interest, can be investigated. These subsequent hypotheses concern the exis- 
tence and the nature of  any relationship between the quality  management practices and 
superior quality  outcomes. The  second hypothesis parallels Powell’s  hypotheses four 
through  15. 

HYPOTHESIS  2.  Each of the main quality  management practice dimensions (as identified 

in the exploratory  phase) is positively  related to superior product quality  outcomes. 

However,  even  if  all  of  the practice  dimensions are individually  related to  superior 
quality  outcomes, that does not necessarily support the interdependence assumption. Each 
practice may have a significant effect  on quality  outcomes, but the effects may be inde- 
pendent. The assumption of interdependence may be erroneous. 

To  explore the interdependence assumption more thoroughly,  we need a third  series of 
hypotheses. These hypotheses represent alternative  explanations of  the relationship be- 
tween quality  management practices and quality  outcomes. The  first of  these represents 
the assumption implicit  in  virtually  all  of  the existing  literature,  with  the exception  of 
Powell ( 1995). 

HYPOTHESIS  3a.  The  positive  relationship between quality  practices and quality  out- 

comes can be best represented by  a single higher-order quality  practice construct. 

This alternative  assumes that it is the common variance of all of the practices which is 
driving  the  quality  practice-outcome  relationship.  For  the remainder of  this paper, the 
single higher-order construct model will  be referred to as the “Best  Practice”  model.

PRACTICES  AID  QUALITY  PERFORMANCE?

A  second  and competing  subhypothesis  acknowledges 

that  the interdependence  among 
the practices  may  be important  but  more  complex.  Two  or  more  higher-order  constructs 
may  be required  to  adequately  highlight 
the differences,  as well  as the  interdependencies, 
among  the  practices.

HYPOTHESIS  3c.  The  positive 

relationship  between  quality  practices  and  quality  out- 
comes  can  be best  represented  by  a collection  of  separate  practice  constructs,  with  each 
having  an independent 

relationship  with  quality  outcomes. 

This  final  hypothesis  represents  Powell’s  suggestion  that  managers  may  select the qual- 
ity  practices  they  want to implement  without  any  fear of losing  any  “synergistic  effects.” 
This  scenario  will  be referred  to  as the  “Baseline”  model.

Australian  Manufacturing  Council 
(AMC)  with  the  assistance  of  the  Boston  Consulting 
Group,  the Australian  Bureau  of Statistics,  and the Manufacturing  Advisory  Group  (New

modeling  program  EQS  (version  4.02).  Details  of  the  methodology  are discussed  below.

A  total  of  approximately  4,000  manufacturing

in  Australia  and  327  in  New  Zealand;  yielding 
raw  response  rates  of  32%  and  33%, 
respectively.  A telephone  survey of  108 nonrespondents  was conducted  by the  AMC.  These

The  survey  instrument  was a  17 page  mail  survey  sent  to  site  managers 

in  January, 
1994.  All  responses  were returned  within  a  lo-week  period.  The  diverse  nature  of  the 
organizations 
this  survey  and  their  differing  objectives  means  that 
the questionnaire  covered  a broad  range of topics.  A total  of 246  questions  were eventually 
in  the  survey.  Seventy-nine  of those  questions  deal  with  what the manufacturing

the normality  of the data. Four of  the variables are based on continuous scales. For these 
four  variables,  no outliers  required deletion,  although  all  four  were transformed using 
natural logarithms to correct for  excessive skew and kurtosis. All  of  the remaining vari- 
ables utilize  interval  scales (predominantly  five  point Likert-type  scales). A  total of  five 
of  the interval  scale variables have  also been transformed  using natural  logarithms to 
correct for  excessive skew and kurtosis. 

The second stage of data preparation is the treatment of incomplete responses. Structural 
equation modeling requires all cells in the data set be complete. Only  352 of the original 
1289 responses were complete, yet  most of  the incomplete responses were only  missing 
one or two  items out of  the 79 required. Thus, the researchers were faced with  dropping 
almost three-quarters of the responses or using a technique such as imputing missing cells 
with  the variable mean. The latter of these two  options, substituting the variable mean, is 
only  advisable when the proportion  of blank cells is low  (Bentler  1993, pp. 46-47).  For 
the purposes of the analyses reported in  this paper, this second approach was adopted. 
The 48 variables of  interest were divided  into  13 constructs: the 12 groups of  quality 
practices discussed in the previous  section plus one group for  the quality  outcome mea- 
sures. If  for  any individual  respondent there were more than four  empty  cells across all 
48 variables for  that respondent or more than one-third  of  the variables assigned to any 
given construct were missing, then the entire response was deleted from the data set. This 
approach yielded 698 responses with  only  0.7% missing cells. Within  this sample of 698, 
the variable means were substituted for  missing cells. 

The 589 deleted cases were tested for response bias by comparing them with the retained 
data set using a multiple  analysis of  variance  (MANOVA). 
Twelve  key  variables were 
identified  using exploratory  factor  analysis, and these variables plus an indicator  of  firm 
size were used in an MANOVA.  A  significant difference  was detected (F(  12,1009) =  2.3, 
p  =  0.007)  between the retained and deleted data sets. For three of  the 12 key  variables, 
significantly  higher scores were detected for  the 698 useable responses than for  the 589 
deleted responses. For  each of  the  remaining  nine key  variables,  the retained data set 
scored higher than the deleted data set but the difference  did not reach the 0.05 level  of 
significance. The firms in the retained data set were also significantly  larger. This analysis 
shows that  the retained data set is biased toward  larger firms and firms that agree with 
and are utilizing  the management practices under investigation  to  a greater extent.  This 
bias needs to be kept in mind when interpreting  the results. 

4.4  Analysis Procedures 

Given  the exploratory  nature of the first research question and the availability  of a large 
sample, the useable data set has been split randomly  into  two  equal groups. This allows 
the first  data subset, the calibration  sample, to  be retained for  exploratory  analyses and 
refinement of the models. The second subset, the cross-validation sample, is then used to 
confirm the alternate models and select the best model. 

In  addition to the splitting  of the sample into  calibration  and cross-validation subsets, 
a two-step  approach to  structural  equation modeling  (Anderson  and Gerbing  1988)  is 
utilized  to  allow  adequate independent assessment of  the convergent  and discriminant 
validities  of the constructs being measured and then a separate assessment of  the nomo- 
logical  validity  of the structural models. 

STEP  ONE:  DEVELOPMENT 

AND  TESTING  OF  THE  MEASUREMENT  MODEL.  Exploratory 
factor  analyses ( EFA)  is used on the 44 manufacturing practice variables in the calibration 
sample to develop a range of  models that may best approximate the structure of the data. 
No attempt is made to use EFA  to determine a single best model because of the difficulties 
with  EFA  in making such a determination. The thorny  issues of the number of factors and

issue that  haunts  all  the empirical

As  argued  above,  the  controversial  and  contradictory 

results  of  this  research  demand 
further  investigation.  Some  aspects can only  be resolved  through 
the  acquisition  of more 
extensive  and  sophisticated  data  sets and,  thus,  are beyond  the scope of  this  paper.  How- 
ever,  two  aspects can be  explored  with  minor  modifications 

to  the  existing  models. 

One  issue  that  can  be  addressed  in  more  detail  concerns  the  collinearity 

the 
quality  practice  constructs  and their  relationships  with  the quality  outcome  construct.  The 
first  step in  this  exploratory  analysis  is to separately  model  each practice  construct  loading 
onto  the  quality  construct,  essentially  replicating 
in Table  4. The 
next  step is to model  each pair  of practice  constructs  and determine 
in  each case whether 
their  joint  variance  is  superior  to  a model  with  inde- 
a second-order  factor  representing 
pendent  factors.  This  process is  then  extended  to  progressively 
larger  groupings  of prac- 
tices.

results  begin  to contradict 

The  results  of testing  the second and third  hypotheses,  combined  with Powell’s 

findings, 
provide  a strong  case against  the interdependence  assumption.  Both  data sets indicate 
that 
only  a handful  of the soft aspects of the quality  management  practices  can claim  a positive 
relationship  with  quality  outcomes  that  is generalizable  across a broad  range  of industries. 
In  one  sense this  is controversial  since  it  challenges  some  widely  held  assumptions  about 
TQM  and  an integrated  approach  to  quality  management.  On  the  other  hand,  many  of the 
quality  practices  that  were found  nonessential,  or  at  least  nongeneralizable,  had  already 
been  identified 
in  our  literature  review  as being  contentious.  The  importance  of practices 
such as benchmarking,

whether  the  interaction  of those  practices  was critical,  or  not,  to  the  overall  relationship.

with  the  contingency  view  of  strategy,  particular  practices  may  only  be appropriate  under 
certain  conditions.  For example,  supplier  relations  may  only  be important 
in industries  where

explain  why  Krafcik  and  MacDuffie’s

tionship  between  automation  and product  quality;  whereas no  such relationship  was found 
for  the  multi-industry 
reported  in  this  paper.  To  test this  scenario,  the 
analysis  would  need  to be  repeated  with  more  narrowly  defined  populations  or  with  indi-
