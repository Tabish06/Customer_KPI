Abstract

This paper sets out to examine the relationship between training and (rm performance in middle-sized UK companies. It
recognises that there is evidence that “high performance work practices” appear to be associated with better performance in
large US companies, but argues that this relationship is less likely to be present in middle-sized companies. The paper’s key
contribution is to justify the wider concept of education, training and development (ETD) as applicable to such companies.
It then (nds that clusters of some ETD variables do appear to be associated with better middle-sized company performance.

1. Introduction

A massive descriptive literature currently exists on ed-
ucation,
training and development (ETD) policies, and
particularly on training. In recent years this literature has
focussed heavily on “best practice” or “high performance
work systems”. However, what was conspicuously lacking
until the mid-1990s was attempts to link these practices,

1 This paper stems from research undertaken jointly between the
author, The Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry (FM& I)
and PricewaterhouseCoopers. That research appeared as Amos et
al. (The middle market: how they perform: education, training and
development. Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry, London,
1997). Particular thanks go to Elizabeth Amos and Jane Spiller
at FM& I and to Richard Wade at PwC. I am also grateful for
comments received on an earlier version of this paper from John

either individually or collectively, to corporate performance
indicators. This changed as a result of contributions from,
amongst others, Huselid [1], Guest and Hoque [2], MacduLe
[3] and Ichniowski et al. [4].

Huselid [1], whose work may be considered to broadly

characterise this group of studies, concluded:

High Performance Work Practices : : : have an eco-
nomically and statistically signi(cant impact on : : :
long-term measures of corporate performance.

Whilst the above sentence might be interpreted as implying
a “universal” contribution of HR policies, in fact the evi-
dence points more towards con(gurations of policies which
“(tted” the individual (rm. Two key elements emerge in
discussing the “(t” of HR policies. The (rst is (rm size.
Huselid”s work was based on publicly owned (rms in the
United States. On average, these (rms had 4400 workers,
so they are extremely large by any standards. Yet (rm size
and HR policies and practices are strongly correlated. In
the Huselid study, the (log of) Employment size variable
is highly positively signi(cant in the key equations, imply-
ing that the relationship between HR and performance can
only be analysed by taking account of (rm size. Lynch and

Black [5] also (nd workplace size a major determinant of the
probability of training provision—even though small (rms
with less than 20 workers are not even included in their data
set. These (ndings are con(rmed by Black et al. [6] who
say:

regardless of the type of training measure implemented,
intensity, duration or mix, it appears that larger estab-
lishments and (rms do indeed provide more formal
training

Such (ndings cross international boundaries. In their study
of Canadian workplaces, Betcherman et al. [7] (nd estab-
lishment size a key in’uence on the likelihood of training
provision. Booth [8] and Cully et al. [9] (nd similar results
for the UK.

The second element is that the work linking HR and per-
formance identi(es “bundles” of HR policies that are pos-
itively associated with (rm performance. Such “bundles”
include not only training but also recruitment and remuner-
ation, both of which constitute important elements of “high
performance work systems”. Huselid, for example, shows
that individual elements—such as training—make a statis-
tically insigni(cant contribution to performance. It is only
when included as part of the “bundle” that they become
signi(cant.

This paper addresses whether training “works”, but for
(rms that diRer in two important respects from those ex-
amined in the current literature cited above. First, it will
examine medium-sized companies (MSCs), de(ned as
those with sales of between $6 million and $500 million,
but averaging around $20 million. Second, it will exam-
ine SMEs in the United Kingdom, rather than the United
States.

The (rst problem faced by researchers is that the vocab-
ulary used, and the meaning of that vocabulary, diRers be-
tween large (rms and MSCs, and amongst those who study
them. To address this problem this research began with a
series of focus groups comprising the Owners=Directors of
MSCs. These discussions con(rmed that MSCs were fun-
damentally diRerent from their larger (rm counterparts, and
that the human resource issues facing these Owner=Directors
bore scant similarity to those discussed in the, large (rm,
US-based, literature.

For example, the concept of training in MSCs needed both
narrowing and widening, in order to make methodologically
valid comparisons with larger (rms. It needed narrowing
because the focus of this research is on training, rather than
the full range of “high performance work systems factors”—
including recruitment, remuneration and teamwork. Yet the
focus group discussions emphasised that, in MSCs, it would
be seriously misleading to focus narrowly on, for exam-
ple, formal or even just informal training. To do so would
massively underestimate the extent to which new knowl-
edge and practice is accumulated because informal processes
are much more characteristic of middle-sized, than large,
(rms.

For this reason we develop the wider concept of ETD
to more accurately re’ect the knowledge accumulation pro-
cess in an MSC. Our focus groups also emphasised that, to
achieve real insight into HR practices, including training,
contact had to be made with the Owners=Directors, since it
is these individuals who strongly determine the culture and
practice of MSCs. The large (rm literature, where the key
respondent is the HR Director, was naSTve in the MSC con-
text, in part because such people frequently did not exist,
and partly because HR policies were much more strongly in-
’uenced by Owner=Directors, than by HR “professionals”.
Finally, the focus groups emphasised that many of the issues
which the Owner=Directors volunteered as key ETD in’u-
ences in their business seem to have received little coverage
in the large (rm literature. We therefore had to devise our
own questions, rather than having the luxury of drawing on
prior research.

MSCs are therefore not “scaled-down” versions of larger
(rms. Instead, they diRer from large (rms fundamentally in
terms of the aspirations and motivations of the owners and
the uncertainties that the business faces. This explains why
MSCs invest less in all forms of long-term (xed capital—
not simply training—than large (rms [Marshall et al. [10],
Cosh et al. [11], Storey [12]].

To test whether training “works” for MSCs we analyse a
purpose-built data set comprising medium-sized companies
in the United Kingdom. Our approach is to obtain data on
self-reported (rm performance and to seek to link this to
ETD practices and attitudes. However, since performance is
in’uenced not only by ETD, but also by a range of other
factors, account is taken of this by incorporating measures
of “strategy”, as well as a range of other “controls”.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows:
the next section justi(es, in detail, the reasons why ETD
policies and practices might be expected to diRer in their
impact on the bottom line between diRerent sizes of (rm.
Given these diRerences, and our concern for examining
these issues in medium-sized (rms, Section 4 justi(es the
research methodology. Section 5 sets out how the hy-
potheses will be tested and Section 6 describes the data
collection methods. The results are presented in Section
7 and their implications considered in the concluding
section.

2. The role of size

Smaller (rms are not “scaled-down” versions of large
(rms. In the famous Penrose analogy, the small (rm is no
more a scaled-down version of a large (rm than a caterpil-
lar is a scaled-down version of a butter’y [Penrose [13]].
Caterpillars look diRerent, move diRerently and respond
diRerently from butter’ies, despite being of the same genus.
Small and large (rms are equally distinctive. In general,
smaller (rms experience vastly greater market and cus-
tomer uncertainty. Those who own and manage the smaller

business exhibit a vastly greater range of aspirations than
owners=managers of large (rms. 2

Storey and Sykes [14] argue that this greater market,
customer and aspirational uncertainly is re’ected in the
clear negative relationship between (rm size and death
rate. The higher death rate of smaller (rms is recognised
by suppliers (of (nance and other inputs) and by the small
business owners themselves. The latter, rationally respond
by favouring short, over longer-term gains, and ’exible
over speci(c investment, even where there is some cost
penalty. 3 One illustration of the impact of this behaviour
is the structure of the Balance Sheets of smaller, compared
with larger companies. Smaller (rms generally have a much
lower proportion of (xed to current assets than large (rms, 4
even though productivity in smaller (rms is below that of
large.

Investment in Human Resources is subject to similar con-
siderations. Storey and Westhead [17] consider the market
for investment in HR as comprising both demand-side (on
the part of (rms) and supply-side in’uences. Demand-side
factors are most frequently discussed in the literature. Ace-
moglu and Pischke [18] argue that, for (rms to invest in
general training, some labour market imperfection must
exist, so enabling (rms to earn rents on trained workers.
They show that, where quit rates are high in an economy
(USA), general training is low. Conversely, where quit
rates are low in an economy (Germany), general training is
high.

Similar logic applies in comparing large and smaller (rms.
Because of their lower productivity, smaller (rms pay lower
wages and provide fewer non-wage bene(ts than large en-
terprises [Morisette [19]]. They are also less likely to have
internal labour markets and so are less able to provide career
progression to trained workers. Hence they are less likely
to obtain the stream of rents from trained workers, who are
more likely to quit for better paid jobs elsewhere [Holt-
man and Idson [20]]. But, as argued earlier, the smaller (rm
places a premium on immediate, rather than long term, re-
turns on the grounds that it may not be in business in the long
term. Incurring costs in, for example, training=developing

2 Small (rm owners report a wide variety of objectives for their
business, ranging from rapid growth to short-term disengagement.
These include “survival”, passing the business on to family, lifestyle
advancement, etc. This contrasts with larger publicly owned busi-
nesses which, disciplined by external shareholders, are required to
achieve shareholder value.

3 Chen and Hambrick [15] argue that successful competitive
behaviour of small, compared with non-manufacturing large (rms
(in the US airline industry) diRers markedly. For example, small
(rms were more likely to initiate competitive moves, but large
(rms were more responsive when attacked.

4 Cosh and Hughes [16], for example, compare the Balance Sheet
of large and small UK companies in 1987–89. They (nd 59.2%
of Total Current Assets of large companies are (xed, compared
with 30.9% of small. For manufacturing companies the respective
proportions are 44.4% and 31.5%.

staR in new procedures is more easily justi(ed if the mar-
ket for those procedures is certain. The smaller (rm, well
aware of customer and market uncertainty, is likely to view
such markets more cautiously than a large (rm with market
power, reputation and tradition.

High customer and market uncertainly, combined with
aspirational variability, then explains why the demand for
training=development is less in smaller, than in large (rms.
However, Storey and Westhead [17] argue that supply-side
in’uences are also important. The unit cost of providing
training for smaller (rms is higher than for large (rms for
two reasons. First, the opportunity cost of workers being
away for training is high in smaller (rms because of the ab-
sence of “cover”. Second, because of their heterogeneity, it
is more expensive for a comparable unit of training to be
provided for smaller, compared with large, (rms. To illus-
trate, take the case of training provided for a large num-
ber of middle managers within the same enterprise, each at
the same stage in their career. An external training provider
seeking to provide high-quality training needs to understand
the history, culture, markets, strategy and politics of the
company, as well as its HR policies. To obtain such an un-
derstanding requires a time input which, whilst substantial
in total, is comparatively modest when spread over many
trainees.

The same depth of understanding of corporate history, cul-
ture, markets and politics cannot be economically justi(ed
where there are only a few trainees—which is highly likely
where training is provided for smaller (rms. The smaller
(rm training provider therefore faces a dilemma—either to
seek the same level of corporate understanding as is ob-
tained with large corporate clients—or to lower costs by
providing “generic”, rather than company-speci(c, training.
Here “generic” means skills applying across a wide range of
contexts—examples of which might include business plan-
ning, strategy, raising external (nance, etc.

Given the learning cost schedule that the training provider
faces, the training of owners, managers and employees in
smaller (rms inevitably contains a substantial “generic”
component. The eRect is that the smaller (rm owner views
such training as overly abstract or “academic” and insuL-
ciently applied to the immediate concerns of the (rm and
therefore as lacking in value. Furthermore, because the train-
ing is “generic”, the skills learnt by the trainee can clearly
be applied outside the context of his=her (rm, so further
discouraging the smaller (rm from paying for the training
because it raises the likelihood of the trainee quitting. For
all these reasons smaller (rms are less likely to provide
training for their employees, and less likely to have the type
of ETD policies which characterise large enterprises.

3. Hypothesis derivation

Given that smaller enterprises “under-invest” in training
compared with larger (rms, is this re’ected in a weaker


252

relationship of the investment with the bottom line? If the
relationship with the “bottom line” was as strong for smaller
(rms as for large, then the former would be as likely to in-
vest in ETD=HR. Yet the evidence presented in the above
section implies that smaller (rms are likely to make a pro-
portionately smaller investment. The suggests the following
hypothesis:

H1. The economic performance of middle-sized companies
is only weakly in’uenced by ETD policies and prac-
tices.

The performance of enterprises, however, is in’uenced
by many factors, other than human resources. Such fac-
tors include in’uences external to the (rm such as the
macro-economy or external currency valuations. It will
also be in’uenced by company skills such as marketing,
strategy or (nancial control. The (ndings of Patterson et
al. [21] suggest that, even taking account of these factors,
HRM policies strongly in’uence performance. They say
HRM practices explain 18% of the variation in produc-
tivity and 19% of the variation in pro(tability of com-
panies : : : this compares with 2=3% for Strategy, 1%
for quality 1% for technology and 6=8% for research
and development.

To examine the impact of ETD policies and practices on
performance therefore requires some account to be taken
of corporate skills in other functional areas. We therefore
propose the following hypothesis:

H2. ETD policies and practices have a bigger impact upon
the economic performance of middle-sized company
than its business strategy.

4. Choosing the research method

The research method chosen to test these hypotheses is
a large-scale telephone interview study, with the results be-
ing analysed primarily by multivariate (ordered probit and
probit) techniques, although prior to the survey a series of
focus groups were held. This approach requires justi(cation
because, whilst it is becoming frequently used [Fey et al.
[22], Welbourne and Cyr [23]] many scholars in this area
remain uncomfortable with survey-based quantitative meth-
ods. Purcell [24], for example, asks (ve important questions
to which we add a sixth, designed to probe the value of an
approach of this type. The questions are: Who is answer-
ing the questions? What performance measures are used? Is
process excluded? Which employees are included? Another
Hawthorne eRect? Causality? This section of the paper pro-
vides a description of research methods using the Purcell
questions as a structure.

(i) Who is answering the questions?
Purcell argues that “single respondents answering spe-
ci(c questions” provide only a partial insight into the com-

plex and multi-faceted issue of the link between HR and
(rm performance. Furthermore, the HR specialist, who is
frequently the target of the questionnaire, has an incom-
plete knowledge of company operations in total. In making
these observations, Purcell may have postal questionnaires
to large (rms in mind where, in addition to the above issues,
the researcher has no idea who has actually completed the
questionnaire.

Large companies are likely to have a senior HR spe-
cialist. In medium-sized companies, however, such re-
sponsibilities could be exercised by a number of diRerent
individuals, none of whom have either a total HR picture
or a total company picture. The only individual with such
an overview is the most senior person in the company—the
Chief Executive=Chairman= Managing Director.

Our approach has been to contact that individual by tele-
phone. This has the advantage of knowing whom we spoke
to, and of obtaining the views of an individual capable of
being informed both about HR issues and also corporate
performance. Choosing this approach added markedly to
survey costs 5 in comparison with the traditional postal sur-
vey. Given our budget constraints, this considerably low-
ered the sample size. Our judgement, however, was that this
was more than compensated by enhanced data quality, so
addressing the (rst Purcell point.

(ii) What performance measures are used?
For large companies, Huselid [1] and Huselid et al. [25]
measured corporate performance (for two years) in terms
of Employee Productivity, Gross Rate of Return and To-
bin”s Q. Using three measures illustrates that no single
measure fully encapsulates the concept of economic per-
formance and that instead, multiple measures are more
appropriate. 6

Our approach uses four measures of economic perfor-
mance: rate of return on capital employed, compared with
the industry average; rate of return on sales, compared with
the industry average; the cash ’ow position of the com-
pany; whether or not the company was pro(table in the prior
year.

A key diRerence, compared with Huselid [1], is forced
upon us by the focus on medium-sized companies. Whilst
Huselid was able to obtain full performance data from Com-
pact Disclosure, this is not comprehensively available for
UK middle-sized companies 7 for a variety of reasons. These
include, for example, the combining of several “businesses”
within company accounts, the use of “modi(ed” accounts
which provide only partial information, the late delivery

5 It could take up to 10 calls to ensure that the “Top Person”
had suLcient uninterrupted time to conduct what was at least a
45 min interview.

6 This is re’ected in Huselid et al. [25] (nding that the Tobin”s
Q measure, in both years, is not signi(cantly correlated with the
Employee Productivity measure in either of the two years.

7 Appropriate data from public sources on (nancial performance

are available for only 154 of the 309 companies.

of accounts, and problems associated with recent owner-
ship changes. We therefore chose to rely instead upon the
opinions=statements on corporate performance oRered to us
by respondents. 8

(iii) Is process excluded?
No postal or telephone interview survey can ever achieve
the richness of a well-conducted,
real-time
case study. “Process” and “survey” are deemed by many
scholars almost to be mutually exclusive. On the other
hand, case studies lack the wider picture that surveys can
provide.

in-depth,

Our approach is to combine the desirable elements of both
approaches. Although conducting a substantial survey the
questions asked seek to probe both attitudes towards, and
practice of, ETD in the middle-sized company. We therefore
combine attitudinal questions with “tight” questions about
practice.

The attitudinal questions were derived from verba-
tim statements made by middle-sized business owners at
focus-group discussions held around the UK prior to the
survey presented in this paper. Discussions were held in
Leeds, London, Birmingham, CardiR and Manchester on
the topics to be included in the questionnaire, with about six
business owners in each location. The practice questions,
which were much tighter, drew partly on the issues raised
in the focus groups and partly on issues emerging from
prior research. We therefore seek to obtain an insight into
“process” by linking these dimensions together, drawing
upon our piloting experience.

(iv) Which employees are included?
Studies of HR practices in large enterprises have focussed
on either seeking responses from the workforce or, more
frequently, the individual with professional responsibili-
ties for HR within the business. Huselid [1], for example,
refers to “the senior human resource professional” in this
context. This is, of course, a classic big (rm term. Many
middle-sized-(rms would view the request for such a person
with some humour; the most likely unfortunate recipient
of such a questionnaire would be the Owners=Managing
Directors Secretary=PA. Wynarczyk et al. [27] for exam-
ple, found that HR matters were most frequently handled
by such a person until the business exceeded 100 em-
ployees. They also found that HR expertise was the last
functional area to be “professionalised” as the business
grew. 9

Our approach is to recognise the reality that ETD philos-
ophy and practice in middle-sized companies is set primar-
ily, even exclusively, by Owners=Board Directors. It is best

discovered by, not only seeking their opinions, but also by
examining the actions that these individuals take towards
their own ETD and that of others within the company. Con-
tact with the Owner=Director also has the added advantage
of being able to obtain enterprise performance information
from the same person.

Ideally, we would like to have sought a wider range of
views since it has been recognised that, perhaps particularly
in small (rms, there can be strong diRerences between the
stated views about workplace harmony between workers and
the boss [Goss [28], Curran [29]]. However, our purpose
is to make some comparisons with the large (rm studies
where often only the views of a single, senior HR profes-
sional were sought. In addition, facing a budget constraint
we concluded there was greater merit in having a larger sam-
ple of Owner=Directors than in contacting a wider range of
employees in fewer (rms.

(v) Hawthorn and causality
No single survey, even given the most favourable circum-
stances, could demonstrate that HRM causes bottom-line
improvement. At best an association could be identi(ed
yet, even if such an association were identi(ed a priori,
the direction of the association is not obvious. Thus it is
plausible to argue that good performance—possibly re’ect-
ing temporary or chance favourable market conditions—
provides funding which enables ETD to be undertaken.
Clearly, ETD and performance are correlated, but the di-
rection of causation is the reverse of that normally argued.
Only by time series analysis—observing changes in ETD
at a point in time being re’ected in performance changes
at a future time—can such conclusions become more
robust.

Surveys at a single point in time, however, can test
for simple associations. But, as noted earlier, any attempt
to link ETD to (rm performance also has to ensure that
other factors in’uencing (rm performance are held con-
stant. These include “internal” factors such as strategy
and pricing, marketing, research and development, acquisi-
tions. It also includes “external” factors including market
demand,
the macro-economy and
competition.

technological change,

Our approach has been to obtain information on the key
strategic policies of the (rm, as articulated by the respon-
dent. On “external” in’uences, our approach has been to
conduct questioning about performance in 1992–94 when
most (rms were experiencing diLcult trading conditions.
The macro-economy can therefore be viewed as being poor
for all (rms.

8 In this regard we are similar to Delaney and Huselid [26],
rather than Huselid [1] or Huselid et al. [25]. The approach is also
used by Fey et al. [22].

9 Purcell was concerned with a somewhat diRerent question. His
interest was whether the opinions of all, or merely “core” workers
were sought by researchers.

5. Testing the hypotheses

This paper tests Hypotheses 1 and 2 in the following
ways. It takes the self-assessed performance measures as the
dependent variable in a probit or ordered probit equation.
It then seeks to explain these performance diRerences in

terms of three groups of independent variables: “Controls”,
“Strategy and Managing Director characteristics” and “ETD
policies, strategies and objectives”. It begins by seeking to
explain performance diRerences purely by the use of “Con-
trol” variables. To this are then added the “Strategy” vari-
ables. Finally, to the three groups of independent variables,
are added the “ETD policies, strategies and objectives” vari-
ables. In this way we can test the additionality of the ETD
component (Hypothesis 1) and the extent to which its contri-

bution diRers from=is additional to the Strategy component
(Hypothesis 2).

Table 1 provides a brief description of the independent
variables in the three groups, with the detailed description of
both dependent and independent variables shown in Table 7
of the appendix. Each independent variable in Table 1 has a
hypothesised sign, indicating our expectation of its impact
upon (rm performance. Justi(cation for the expected signs
is now provided.

Table 1 shows the variables in the “Controls” group.
Two relate to location; the expected signs re’ect prosper-
ous (SE) and less prosperous (NISCOTWA) UK regions
[Danson [30]]. The (rm size variable (LOGSALES) is
expected to be positive, if only because larger (rms are
more likely to provide training (Lynch and Black [5]) and
training is assumed to positively in’uence (rm perfor-
mance. Sectoral composition is taken into account in the
NEWSERV variable which assumes those companies in the
fast growth sectors of Professional and Financial Services,
Telecommunications and Computers will perform better
than those in other sectors.

Following Storey [12] we group together under “Strat-
egy” all decisions made by the management of the busi-
ness, except those relating to ETD. We assume ownership
of the company in’uences performance, as re’ected in the
presence of two variables (LISTED and HOLD). We also
assume that the decision to be present in export markets
(EXPORT) is also likely to positively in’uence growth,
because of the greater opportunities these markets provide
[Coviello and McAuley [31]]. The bulk of the “Strategy”
variables, however, are derived from the company”s own
statements about their strategy in their marketplace and the
extent to which it has implemented that strategy in recent
times. The only exception is the STLOGDIR variable which
is the (log of) the number of Directors on the Board. Here it
is hypothesised that this is positively related to performance
on the grounds that more Directors will provide a wider pool
of managerial talent [Zahra et al. [32]].

The ETD variables are in two parts. Section IV shows 15
variables re’ecting company practice. Here factual answers
are sought, either in a Yes=No format, or as speci(c numer-
ical answers. The questions asked derive directly from prior
research in the area [Huselid [1]].

In contrast, the softer elements of ETD are examined
in the responses to 24 statements about company attitudes
to these matters. These, it will be recalled, were derived
from statements made at focus-group meetings, and so do
not derive directly from prior research. In this survey re-
spondents were read these statements and asked about the
extent to which it applied in their business. Five scoring
options were provided, where 1 was “does not apply at all”
and 5 was “completely applies”. Each of these answers be-
came a separate variable, so there are 24 attitudinal vari-
ables. The statements are shown in full in Table 8 of the
appendix.

6. Data collection methods

The companies included in this study are those in the
so-called UK “Middle Market”. They have Sales of between
$8m and $500 and are independently owned. Hence they are
not a subsidiary of another enterprise. There are no sectoral
restrictions, so participating companies can be in any “for
pro(t” activity.

Two data sources were used to make contact with these
(rms. The (rst was to approach those companies that had
previously participated in earlier studies of the UK Middle
Market [Coopers and Lybrand [33]]. Of the 501 (rms in
the original study, usable responses to this survey were ob-
tained from 109 (22% response rate). A second group of
respondents were derived from a random sample of com-
panies from the ICC One Source database, with appropri-
ate annual sales and satisfying the ownership criteria. Two
hundred and (ve companies from this source provided re-
sponses, but here it is more diLcult to provide valid response
rates since, whether or not the company was “valid”, only
became apparent once contact had been made. The respon-
dents from both sources were then combined since the two
samples did not diRer signi(cantly in terms of sector, age,
size or geography. This provides a total of 314 respondents
who generally were the most senior person in the business
and who were contacted by telephone.

7. Results

7.1. Means, standard deviations and simple correlation

The (rst two columns of Table 2 show the number of
observations and the arithmetic means for the four “Control”
variables, the Strategy=Managing Director variables, and the
remaining ETD practice variables.

Interpreting the mean values provides some insight into
the broad characteristics of sampled (rms. The arithmetic
mean (rm has sales of $20m; 22% are found in the Finance
and Professional Services, Telecommunications and Com-
puting sectors. 25% of companies are listed on the Stock
Exchange in some form and they obtain an average of 19%
of their sales from outside the UK.

Simple indicators of ETD practice in these (rms can also
be deduced from the table. The ETDPOL variable shows
that 69% of (rms claim to have an ETD policy and 34%
have the formal Investors in People (IIP) quali(cation. In
just over half the cases the Chief Executive has a degree
(MDDEGR).

Some of the other variables, however, indicate a more
mixed picture. The HRDEPT variable is a score constructed
from the (nding that 31% of (rms have no Personnel=HR
Department and only half have such a Department respon-
sible for all staR including Directors. The HRSENIORBD
variable indicates that only 29% of (rms have a Board
Director speci(cally responsible for training. Finally, the
HRTRAINBDC variable implies that in only 8.5% of com-
panies are Board Directors required to undertake some for-
mal training each year.

It is customary to also present simple correlations between
both the independent and dependent variables but, in this
case, such an approach would be extremely unwieldy be-
cause of the large numbers of variables involved. We have
therefore chosen to provide the reader with, in the (nal four

columns of Table 2, simple correlation between the four per-
formance indicators and the “Control”, Strategy and ETD
Practice variables. The key point which emerges is that,
whilst two of the four “Controls” are associated with perfor-
mance, only the BDDEVPL variable—whether Board Di-
rectors have a Personal development Plan—is signi(cantly
positively correlated—even at the 10% level—with even
three of the four measures of (rm performance. Indeed, four
of the Strategy=Managing Director, and six of the ETD Prac-
tice, variables are not signi(cantly correlated with any of
the four performance measures.

Some of the non-signi(cant correlations are particu-
larly noteworthy. The (rst is the IIP variable—which is
the UK government-backed HR kite-mark—implying no
simple correlation between (rm performance and par-

ticipation in IIP. The second is MDDEGR—implying
no association between performance and the educational
quali(cations of the Chief Executive. Finally, HRDEPT
is weakly (10%) associated with only one performance
measure—suggesting support for Welbourne and Cyr [23]
who show no simple correlation between whether the
company has a department responsible for training and its
performance.

Overall the strong impression from Table 2 is that of
only very weak relationships emerging between individual
Strategies, ETD practices and (rm performance. As shown
in Table 11 of the appendix, a similar but perhaps even
weaker pattern emerges when the 24 attitudinal variables
are correlated with the performance indicators. Perhaps most
striking of all is that none of the variables are correlated

at the 5% level with whether the (rm reported itself to be
pro(table in the last (nancial year (PROF).

Two explanations for this are possible. The (rst is that
simple correlations are inappropriate since performance is
in’uenced by a wide range of non-ETD factors and so a
multivariate approach is appropriate. The second is that, fol-
lowing Huselid [1], whilst the individual ETD policies may
exert only a weak in’uence on performance, a combina-
tion of policies is much more powerful. Generating Factors,
which are linear combinations of the original variable, and
using these to explain performance has been shown to yield
more powerful results. Both approaches are used in the re-
mainder of this paper.

7.2. Probit and ordered probit

Tables 3–6 present our results using a similar format. In
each case the same four performance indicators are used:
ROS, ROC, CASH, PROF. In the case of the (rst three
variables, (rms self-classify themselves on a scale from 1 to
5. It is therefore appropriate to use an ordered probit model
to explain performance. In the case of the variable PROF,
this only takes the values 0 and 1 depending on whether or
not the company was pro(table in the last (nancial year.
Hence a standard probit model is appropriate. The expected
sign of each independent variable is shown in the second
column of each table.

Table 3 seeks to explain each performance indicator, only
in terms of the group of variables referred to as “Con-
trols”. Table 4 explains the performance measures in terms
of the “Controls”, the Managing Director and “Strategy”
variables. Finally, in Tables 5 and 6 ETD variables are
added to determine the additional explanatory power they
provide. Individually signi(cant (at 5% levels) variables are
shown in bold.

7.2.1. Explaining performance using only “Control”
variables

Table 3 shows that, whilst all the “Control” variables were
signi(cant in at least one of the equations, none were present
in all equations. LOGSALES, however, has the expected
signi(cantly positive sign, so emphasising the importance
of taking account of (rm size in this context.

Amongst the other “Controls” which in’uence perfor-
mance are the location variables. Firms located in North-
ern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (NISCOTWA) have nega-
tive signs in all four equations, with these being signi(cant
in three. This corresponds with our expectations, whereas
the negative signs on SE (one signi(cant) contrast with our
priors. 10

The sectoral variable NEWSERVE, which attempts to
capture the in’uence of more “modern” sectors such as
(nancial and professional services,
telecommunications,
electronics and computing, exerts its expected positive
in’uence on performance. In all equations the sign is pos-
itive, and in two (ROS and PROF) it is signi(cantly so.
This may be surprising since, in calibrating ROS, respon-
dents were asked to compare their returns on sales with the
industry average. It is less surprising for the CASH and
the PROF variables, where no industry comparisons are
implied.

The “Controls” therefore make a modest contribution to
explaining variations in three out of the four performance
measures.

10 With the bene(t of hindsight, whilst it is the case that over a
longer timespan (rms in South East England have “outperformed”
those elsewhere in the UK, the recession of 1991–93 was particu-
larly severe in the South East. Given that our performance data are
heavily in’uenced by these years, this geographical variable may
be in’uenced by the recessionary conditions.

7.2.2. Explaining performance using “Controls”,
Strategy and Managing Director variables

We now examine the eRect of supplementing the “Con-
trols” with new variables re’ecting Strategy and Man-
aging Director characteristics. The only variables shown
in Table 4 are those making a signi(cant contribution
to at least one equation. The table however shows that
both groups of variables make only a very modest con-
tribution to explaining (rm performance. Only MDPOST
is signi(cant
implying
that
those companies with a long-serving MD perform
worse.

in more than a single equation,

7.2.3. Explaining performance using all variables
including ETD

Forty variables are used to “capture” attitudes to, and
practices in ETD. Twenty-four of these report the attitudes
of the “top person” to such issues, and 16 are the responses
of that person to the presence or absence of policies within
the company. We have already seen in Table 2 and Table

11 of the appendix that, in a univariate context, the corre-
lations between ETD and performance are weak. However,
since ETD is delivered in “bundles”, rather than in single
items, HR researchers have felt justi(ed in examining how
combinations of policies in’uence performance, rather than
examining individual policies in isolation. Statistically, such
bundling takes place by generating Factors that best linearly
reconstruct the original variables, but which are uncorrelated
with one another.

Our approach is to distinguish ETD Attitudes from
Practices on the grounds that
these might be expected
to diRer markedly if company practices lagged behind
their statements of “intent”, but with a strong stochastic
component. Table 8 of the appendix, shows the principal
factors generated for the 24 variables combining Atti-
tudes towards ETD. The (rst factor PF1 explains the vast
bulk (76%) of the variance, having an eigenvalue of 5.72,
whereas the second factor PF2 was insigni(cant. PF1 is
therefore used in this analysis to capture attitudes towards
ETD.

There may also be diRerences between company attitudes
towards ETD, with some companies paying more attention
to one, rather than the others. Table 8 of the appendix shows
that factors are then derived for each individually. Education
factors are calculated but the dominant factor is the (rst, the
components of which are starred. All other Factors are
insigni(cant and so the (rst factor (FED) is used in
the analysis. Similar procedures are used to generate
the training factors (FTR) and the development
fac-
tors (FDEV). Again,
is only
the (rst
factor which is signi(cant and subsequently
used.

in both these cases it

The same approach is used with the 16 Practice variables.
This is shown in Table 9 of the appendix where the variables
F1HR and F2HR are generated. Again, however, F1HR is
dominant, with F2HR having an eigenvalue of below unity
and so it is dropped.

Table 5 incorporates PF1, which we can regard as the
“ETD Attitude Factor”, into the performance equation. In
three out of the four equations PF1 exerts a positive and sig-
ni(cant in’uence on (rm performance. Only in the PROF
equation—whether the (rm made a pro(t in the last (nan-
cial year—does PF1 not appear as signi(cant and positive.
When the individual ETD factors (FED, FTR, FDEV) are
included, rather than PF1, the eRects are almost identical.
Rather than show this here, Table 10 of the appendix shows
this is because all four Attitude factors are very strongly
correlated with one another.

Table 6 then takes the “Practices” factor F1HR and in-
serts that into the equations. Unsurprisingly, it also is sig-
ni(cant in the same three equations as PF1. Only in the
PROF equation does F1HR have an insigni(cant sign. It
is also interesting that in two of the equations F1HR ex-
erts a markedly more powerful in’uence than PF1—perhaps


260

implying that it is practices, rather than attitudes, which in-
’uence performance. Examination of Table 10 of the ap-
pendix shows that F1HR is also very strongly correlated
with the attitudinal variables.

Our results therefore are mixed. Overall it is diLcult,
using individual ETD variables, to provide a powerful ex-
planation of the performance of medium-sized (rms. The
“Strategy” variables were also disappointing. Nevertheless,
whilst individual practices and reported attitudes to ETD
provide only weak explanations of performance, there is
evidence that, collectively, they are positively associated
with better performance. It
implies that, even amongst
medium-sized companies, a positive “ethos” towards ETD
is correlated with performance. What it does not show is the
direction of that causation, or the appropriate “levers” which
companies need to pull in order to enhance performance.

8. Interpretation and conclusions

The beguilingly simple question this paper addresses is:
do those MSCs with a stronger ethos of training perform
better than those where such an ethos is weak? Given that
for large (rms a literature exists illustrating that sub-sets of
HR practices positively in’uence (rm performance, could
the same conclusion be drawn for middle size companies
(MSCs)?

The “simple” question, in fact, constituted a major chal-
lenge because smaller (rms are not “scaled-down” versions
of large (rms. Their owners have a wide range of diRering
objectives. They are also perceived by customers, suppli-
ers and (nanciers as being more risky. This leads to shorter
investment horizons, etc. The paper responds to that chal-
lenge by using a vocabulary and concepts that are relevant
in the smaller (rm context, whilst seeking to relate them
to the existing large (rm literature. In practice, the paper
leans more towards “smaller (rm relevance” than “large (rm
comparisons”. This is because the focus-group discussions
with owners, Chief Executives and Managing Directors of
MSCs, that we organised prior to undertaking any survey
work, convinced us that the bulk of the HR issues that faced
those individuals were signi(cantly diRerent from those dis-
cussed in the large (rm literature. Clearly one size did not (t
all. Hence, if we were to make a genuine contribution to un-
derstanding the smaller (rm perspective, this required us to
conceptualise what these business owners were articulating.
The (rst contribution of the paper is then to recognise
that, in the context of smaller (rms, it is necessary to widen
the concept of training. Hence it formulates ETD which we
believe best encapsulates the concept of “training ethos” in
MSCs.

Second, the paper”s empirical work demonstrates that it
is diLcult to explain variations in the self-reported perfor-
mance of medium-sized companies, implying the latter is
strongly stochastic. Nevertheless, amongst MSCs, the larger
(rms perform better and location and sector are also in’u-
ential. A more surprising (nding is that the variables chosen

to re’ect strategy play a very weak role indeed in explaining
performance.

To examine the speci(c impact of ETD, a distinction
is made between “Practices” and “Attitudes”. Practice
variables are intended to re’ect
the actual practices of
ETD within the enterprise. The Attitudes were a series of
statements—all derived from the focus groups—designed
to capture the ETD culture=ethos of the enterprise. The
distinction was made because the focus groups suggested
that in many MSCs Practices would lag considerably, but
not necessarily consistently, behind stated Attitudes.

When individual variables re’ecting “Practices” and
“Attitudes” are included, their contribution to explaining
performance is very modest indeed. However, when factors
are created to re’ect linearly independent combinations of
“Attitudes” or “Practices”, these factors are positively cor-
related both with performance and with one another. We
also found that the correlation between Attitudes Factors
and Practices Factors was very strong, implying that either
was a satisfactory measure of ETD. We conclude there is
some association between ETD and performance, even in
medium-sized companies. We also conclude that, within
such companies, reporting positive Attitudes does translate
into Practice.

Even so, a number of issues remain unresolved for
medium-sized companies. As with larger (rms, the genera-
tion of factors provides little guidance to HR professionals
who are seeking to identify priority areas for action. Our
study had hoped to point to either education, training or
development as being powerful in in’uencing performance.
We are not able to make such a judgement since companies
which perform well in one of these areas are also broadly
positive in the other two. Within these broad areas we are
unable to isolate individual policy initiatives which are
particularly in’uential.

What is clear is that we have not been able to identify any
simplistic “cure alls”, with this perhaps being best illustrated
by the insigni(cance of IIP or the presence of a Training
Department variable in any of the performance equations.
In short, this analysis of MSCs highlights ETD policy has
to proceed on a wide range of fronts if it is to be eRec-
tive. There are no “silver bullets”. Nevertheless, it is able
to demonstrate a positive relationship between ETD factors
and (rm performance for MSCs. This implies that a posi-
tive “ethos” towards ETD appears to be broadly correlated
with action, and that both are correlated with enhanced per-
formance. We are, however, currently unable to determine
the direction of that causation.
