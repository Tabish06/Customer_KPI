1.  Introduction

Companies   have   reacted   to   the   opportunities   and  threats   of   globalization   through   numerous   production
practices   that  have   increased   supply   chain   complexity.   One   of   the   ways   companies   have   been   able   to
manage   this   increased   level   of   complexity   is   by   integrating   their   supply   chains.   Logistical   capabilities   at
the  company   level   play   a  key   role   in   integrating   global   supply   chains,   but   logistical   capabilities   need   not   be
company   speciﬁc.   In  this   study   we   explore   the   role   of   a  country’s   logistical   capabilities   in   external   supply
chain   integration.   Our   results   indicate   that  plants   situated   in   countries   with   superior   levels   of  logistical
capabilities   adopt   signiﬁcantly   lower   levels   of  external   supply   chain   integration.   Additionally,   plants
situated   in   countries   with   superior   logistical   capabilities   do   not   gain   the   same   performance   beneﬁts   from
external   integration   as   plants   situated   in  countries   with   relatively   low   levels   of  logistical   capabilities.

Increasing  levels  of  globalization  have  resulted  in  increased
complexity  in  supply  chains.  This  is  evidenced  by  high  levels  of
cross-border  trade  and  the  increasing  number  of  multinationals
operating  subsidiaries,  warehouses  or  production  plants  on  multi-
ple  continents  and  in  numerous  countries  (Rodrigues  et  al.,  2005).  It
is  suggested  that  to  successfully  manage  this  supply  chain  complex-
ity  companies  should  tightly  integrate  their  supply  chains  (Flynn
et  al.,  2010).

Previous  literature  has  suggested  that  companies  can  gain  sig-
niﬁcant  performance  beneﬁts  through  integrating  their  supply
chain  (Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001;  Lee  et  al.,  1997;  Narasimhan
and  Jayaram,  1998;  Sanders,  2007,  2008;  Shin  et  al.,  2000;  Vereecke
and  Muylle,  2006;  Vickery  et  al.,  2003).  It  has  been  established
that  integration  between  functions  and  organizations  can  lead  to
increased  performance  (e.g.  Pagell,  2004),  whereas  a  lack  of  inte-
gration  can  have  negative  effects  on  performance  (Forrester,  1961;
Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001;  Lee  and  Billington,  1992).

However,  many  studies  have  failed  to  link  integration  to  per-
formance  (see  Flynn  et  al.,  2010  and  Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012

for  recent  comprehensive  reviews)  and  the  more  is  better  view
of  integration  is  not  universally  accepted.  Since  the  early  work  of
Kraljic  (1983)  on  buyer–supplier  relationships,  a  contingent  view  of
supply  chain  integration  has  emerged  which  considers  the  moder-
ating  role  of  environmental  factors  on  the  supply  chain  integration
and  performance  relationship.  Researchers  have  considered  envi-
ronmental  uncertainty,  the  competitive  environment  and  other
business  conditions  as  important  contingencies  impacting  on  the
performance  beneﬁts  of  supply  chain  integration  (Fynes  et  al.,
2004;  Gimenez  et  al.,  2012;  van  Donk  and  van  der  Vaart,  2004).
Most  of  this  literature  has  focused  on  factors  internal  to  the  chain,
such  as  the  strategic  nature  of  the  goods  or  services  transacted,  or
factors  in  the  chain’s  business  environment  such  as  competitive
intensity  and  uncertainty.  We   extend  this  literature  by  considering
how  country-level  factors  can  affect  the  need  and  efﬁcacy  of  supply
chain  integration.  Speciﬁcally,  we   study  the  effect  of  country-level
logistical  capabilities  on  ﬁrm  level  supply  chain  integration  with
customers  and  suppliers  and  investigate  whether  this  country-level
factor  affects  how  ﬁrms  integrate  their  supply  chain.

Previous  research  has  applied  the  Resource  Based  View  (RBV)  to
justify  the  beneﬁts  of  integration.  RBV  based  arguments  have  been
extended  to  include  resources  and  capabilities  that  a  ﬁrm  may   not
own  but  has  access  to  whether  they  lie  in  another  ﬁrm  or  else-
where  (Dyer  and  Singh,  1998;  Madhok,  1996).  Firms  have  access  to
infrastructural  and  institutional  resources  of  their  host  countries;
resources  that  traditionally  have  not  been  studied  by  supply  chain
researchers.

We  add  to  the  existing  understanding  of  external  supply  chain
integration  and  logistics  by  focusing  on  country  wide  logistical

capabilities.  Kinra  and  Kotzab  (2008)  have  argued  that  in  the  age
of  global  supply  chains  and  international  trade,  infrastructural  dif-
ferences  between  countries  have  important  implications  and  that
these  differences  remain  under-studied  in  the  supply  chain  and
logistics  literature.  We   believe  that  globalization  and  the  inher-
ent  cross-border  trade  make  a  country’s  logistical  capabilities  even
more  important  for  successful  supply  chain  integration.  Subse-
quently,  this  research  sets  out  to  investigate  the  following  research
questions:

1.  Are  plants  choosing  their  degree  of  external  supply  chain  inte-

gration  based  on  their  country’s  logistical  capabilities?

2.  Does  a  country’s  logistical  capability  moderate  the  impact  of

external  supply  chain  integration  on  performance?

To  explore  the  role  of  a  country’s  logistical  capabilities  on  sup-
ply  chain  integration  and  its  efﬁcacy  we  utilized  multi-country  data
collected  by  the  International  Manufacturing  Strategy  Survey  (IMSS).
This  data  set  was  combined  with  data  on  countries’  logistical  capa-
bilities  based  on  the  “Logistical  Performance  Index”  (LPI)  developed
and  measured  by  the  International  Trade  Department  of  The  World
Bank  (Arvis  et  al.,  2010).  The  ﬁndings  of  this  study  are  discussed  in
terms  of  policy,  managerial  and  theoretical  implications.

2.  Theoretical  background  and  hypotheses  development

Recent  studies  show  that  researchers  sometimes  use  the  inte-
gration  construct  imprecisely  (e.g.  Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  van  Donk  and
van  der  Vaart,  2004;  van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk,  2008)  which
causes  confusion  since  integration  can  be  categorized  along  multi-
ple  dimensions  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001)
and  aspects  (van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk,  2008;  van  der  Vaart
et  al.,  2012).  First,  integration  has  been  subdivided  into  multiple
dimensions,  with  many  authors  delineating  between  internal  and
external  integration  (e.g.  Flynn  et  al.,  2010).  And  external  integra-
tion  can  be  further  divided  into  integration  with  customers  and
integration  with  suppliers  (e.g.  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001).
While  some  early  research  did  not  differentiate  between  internal
and  external  integration,  today  most  studies  do  (e.g.  Flynn  et  al.,
2010;  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001;  Pagell,  2004;  Schoenherr  and
Swink,  2012).

Integration  has  also  been  examined  in  terms  of  what  aspects,
practices  or  activities  are  engaged  in  (van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk,
2008;  van  der  Vaart  et  al.,  2012).  van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk’s
(2008)  review  of  the  integration  literature  notes  that  integration
research  has  covered  a  broad  array  of  practices  that  range  from
the  tactical  sharing  of  delivery  information  to  strategic  activities
such  as  new  product  development.  Ahmed  and  Pagell  (2012)  fur-
ther  reﬁne  these  ideas  by  noting  that  partners  in  a  supply  chain
can  engage  in  coordinative  and/or  collaborative  integration  activ-
ities.  Coordinative  integration  includes  synchronization,  planning,
and  alignment  of  activities  involving  the  production  and  ﬂow  of
goods  and  services  while  collaborative  integration  involves  shared
action  to  improve  processes  and  exploit  resource  complementari-
ties  allowing  partners  to  beneﬁt  from  each  other’s  knowledge  bases
by  jointly  creating  new  knowledge  and  innovations  (Ahmed  and
Pagell,  2012).

Vereecke  and  Muylle  (2006)  and  van  der  Vaart  et  al.  (2012)
are  two  of  the  few  empirical  papers  that  explicitly  divide  inte-
gration  into  speciﬁc  aspects.  Vereecke  and  Muylle  (2006)  examine
information  exchange  and  structural  collaboration  while  van  der
Vaart  et  al.  (2012)  examine  “planning  information”  and  “joint
improvement”.  The  information  exchange/planning  information
aspect  of  integration  involves  coordinating  the  ﬂow  of  materials,
money  and  information  along  the  supply  chain  while  the  structural

improvements 

collaboration/joint  improvement  aspect  is  much  more  about  col-
laborating  to  make 
in  products  and  processes.
Coordination  of  ﬂows  tends  to  be  what  most  previous  research
measured  (e.g.  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001)  with  Flynn  et  al.’s
(2010)  measure  of  internal  integration  being  one  of  the  few  that
captures  both  coordination  and  collaboration.

Not  only  is  integration  a  multi-dimensional  construct,  but
the  relationship  between  integration  and  performance  is  context
dependent  (Wong,  2011).  Previous  research  has  tended  to  look  at
business  factors  (van  der  Vaart  et  al.,  2012;  Welker  et  al.,  2008)
and  country-level  factors  have  been  neglected.  However,  a  close
analysis  of  the  results  of  different  papers  seems  to  show  that
country-level  factors  could  explain  previous  mixed  results.  Flynn
et  al.  (2010)  and  Robb  et  al.  (2008)  found  support  for  the  cus-
tomer  integration–performance  relationship  in  China  while  Swink
et  al.  (2007)  and  Devaraj  et  al.  (2007)  did  not  in  U.S.  samples.  Flynn
et  al.  (2010)  commented,  “although  their  research  provided  some
interesting  ﬁndings  about  the  relationship  between  supply  chain
integration  and  performance  in  China,  it  is  not  clear  whether  these
relationships  will  be  the  same  in  other  countries”  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010,
p.  67).

Operations  management  and  supply  chain  research  has  often
considered  the  impact  of  country  culture  on  global  operations
and  supply  chains  (Cai  et  al.,  2010;  Naor  et  al.,  2010;  Power
et  al.,  2010).  However  culture  is  not  the  only  important  differ-
ence  between  countries.  As  the  global  competitiveness  report  from
the  World  Economic  Forum  points  out,  different  countries’  invest-
ments  in  infrastructure  and  institutions  lead  to  differences  in  the
supporting  environment  for  ﬁrms  in  those  countries  (The  Global
Competitiveness  Report,  2011).

In  this  paper,  we  study  the  effect  of  country-level  logistical
capabilities  on  the  integration–performance  relationship.  Logisti-
cal  capability  is  generally  deﬁned  in  terms  of  managing  ﬂows  of
materials  and  information  (Mentzer  et  al.,  2004;  Stank  et  al.,  2005;
Zhao  et  al.,  2001)  and  does  not  include  activities  related  to  product,
process  or  supply  chain  design,  joint  innovation,  new  knowledge
creation,  or  the  creation  of  supply  chain  strategy.  Logistical  capa-
bility  is  then  concerned  with  coordinative  (planning  information)
not  collaborative  (joint  improvement)  integration  activities.

Our  study  then  only  covers  the  coordinative  aspects  of  inte-
gration  and  not  the  collaborative  aspects.  In  addition,  while  some
studies  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012)  suggest
that  it  may   be  the  interaction  of  internal  and  external  integration
that  explains  performance,  our  data  set  is  limited  to  only  measures
of  external  integration  which  is  a  limitation,  though  not  a  major
one  since  logistical  ﬂows  tend  to  be  between  chain  members.

In  this  study  supply  chain  integration  is  deﬁned  as  the  extent
to  which  a  company  interconnects  and  aligns  its  supply  chain  with
its  partners  (Jayaram  et  al.,  2010;  Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012)  to
manage  supply  chain  ﬂows  to  reduce  costs,  improve  on-time  deliv-
ery,  reduce  lead-times  and  improve  ﬂexibility.  Our  speciﬁc  interest
is  in  the  coordinative  aspect  of  external  integration,  interconnect-
ing  and  aligning  with  suppliers  and  customers  to  manage  ﬂows  of
materials  and  information.  To  be  clear  as  to  what  aspects  of  inte-
gration  this  study  does/does  not  cover,  for  the  remainder  of  the
paper  we   will  use  the  term  coordinative  external  integration  (CEI)
when  discussing  our  speciﬁc  area  of  study  and  the  more  generic
integration  when  discussing  general  results  from  other  papers.

2.1.  Supply  chain  integration  and  performance  –  the  traditional
view  of  integration  as  a  universal  best  practice

Integration  between  members  of  a  supply  chain  requires  the
adoption  of  practices  such  as 
joint  planning  and  forecasting
(Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001)  as  well  as  investments  in  the  rela-
tionship  (e.g.  Johnston  et  al.,  2004)  and  technology  (Das  et  al.,  2006).


F.  Wiengarten  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Operations  Management  32  (2014)  51–63 

53

And  maintaining  integration  will  also  require  resources.  To  build
and  then  beneﬁt  from  integration  will  require  investments  of  time
and  resources  so  that  members  of  the  chain  can  share  and  make  use
of  knowledge  coming  from  other  organizations  (Hult  et  al.,  2004).
Numerous  studies  have  empirically  linked  supply  chain  integra-
tion  to  signiﬁcant  improvements  in  both  operational  and  business
performance  (e.g.  Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Handﬁeld  et  al.,  2009;
Koufteros  et  al.,  2005;  Lee  et  al.,  1997;  Vereecke  and  Muylle,  2006).
And  a  lack  of  integration  can  harm  supply  chain  performance  as  has
been  comprehensively  explored  through  the  bullwhip  effect  (Lee
and  Billington,  1992).

to  explain 

The  RBV  has  been  used 

the  supply  chain
integration–performance  relationship  (e.g.  Chen  et  al.,  2009;
Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012;  Swink  et  al.,  2007;  Wang  and  Wei,
2007).  Previous  studies  that  have  applied  the  RBV  in  the  context
of  supply  chain  integration  have  argued  that  through  integrat-
ing  supply  chain  processes  companies  can  develop  relationships
that  translate  into  lasting  performance  beneﬁts  and  competitive
advantage  (Cao  and  Zhang,  2011;  Jap,  2001;  Schoenherr  and  Swink,
2012).  This  occurs  because  supply  chain  relationships  can  generate
relational  assets  that  are  valuable,  rare,  imperfectly  imitable,  and
non-substitutable  (Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012).  Jap  (2001)  argued
that  the  embeddedness  of  supply  chain  partnering  ﬁrms’  assets
makes  imitation  difﬁcult.  Subsequently,  this  may   result  in  rela-
tional  capabilities,  which  are  non-substitutable  (Dyer  and  Singh,
1998).  Supply  chain  integration  enhances  capabilities  and  leads  to
operational  cost  savings,  shorter  and  more  predictable  lead-times
and  increased  ﬂexibility  through  collaboration  (Cao  and  Zhang,
2011).

The  RBV  explains  the  impact  of  integration  through  the  value
of  relational  resources  created  in  buyer–supplier  relationships  and
improved  efﬁciencies  of  internal  resources  of  ﬁrms  through  inter-
nal  integration.  Though  never  explicated,  the  RBV  explanation
focuses  mainly  on  the  beneﬁts  of  collaborative  behaviours  as  part
of  the  development  of  unique  resources.  However,  many  tests  that
link  integration  to  performance  have  measured  the  coordinative
aspects  of  integration.  For  instance  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)
measured  activities  such  as  shared  production  plans,  common  con-
tainers,  joint  EDI  access  and  the  like,  not  collaborative  activities
such  as  new  product  development  or  process  improvements.  A  lack
of  coordination  will  clearly  harm  supply  chain  performance  (Lee
and  Billington,  1992)  but  increasing  coordination  will  not  directly
develop  inimitable  capabilities.  Rather,  better  coordination  likely
improves  performance  by  freeing  up  resources  to  work  on  other
tasks,  which  could  either  reduce  costs  and  or  allow  those  resources
to  focus  on  more  collaborative  behaviours.  Subsequently,  we  pro-
pose  the  following  hypothesis.

H1.  CEI  has  a  positive  impact  on  operational  performance.

For  all  hypotheses,  both  the  customer  and  supplier  aspects  of
CEI  will  be  tested.  Similarly,  operational  performance  is  not  one-
dimensional  and  hypotheses  testing  will  separately  examine  cost,
delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance.

included  mainly  for  the  purposes  of  replication.  As
Kerlinger  (1986)  notes  replication  need  not  only  mean  an  exact
duplication,  rather  replication  involves  further  reﬁnements  and
extensions  to  increase  (or  decrease)  the  certainty  of  a  result.
Retesting  theory  is  an  important  part  of  theory  development,
which  is  an  underdeveloped  practice  in  OM  research  (Melnyk
and  Handﬁeld,  1998).  This  study  uses  similar  data  and  measures
to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  and  hence  a  critical  issue  for
interpreting  the  results  will  be  understanding  how  the  results
from  this  sample  compare  to  previous  similar  research  on  the
integration–performance  linkage.

2.2.  Supply  chain  integration  and  country-level  logistical
capability  –  a  contingent  approach

This  study  takes  a  contingent  approach  by  examining  the  qual-
ity  of  the  logistical  capabilities  in  the  country  a  plant  is  located
in.  Logistical  capabilities  have  been  traditionally  and  continuously
linked  to  the  success  of  supply  chains  (Murphy  and  Daley,  1994;
Schoenherr,  2009;  Stock  et  al.,  2000).  Gentry  (1993)  highlighted
that  the  transportation  linkage  between  supply  chain  partners  is
critical  for  the  success  of  strategic  alliances.  Traditionally,  logisti-
cal  capability  has  been  deﬁned  at  the  ﬁrm  or  supply  chain  level
and  is  considered  to  be  that  part  of  supply  chain  management
that  is  concerned  with  the  forward  and  reverse  ﬂow  of  goods,
services  and  related  information  between  two  points  (Gligor  and
Holcomb,  2010).  Although  the  deﬁnition  varies,  in  the  logistics  liter-
ature  there  is  agreement  that  coordination,  customer  and  supplier
interface  management,  timeliness,  management  of  ﬂow,  and  infor-
mation  management  are  important  logistical  capabilities  (Mentzer
et  al.,  2004;  Stank  et  al.,  2005;  Zhao  et  al.,  2001).  At  the  ﬁrm  or
buyer–supplier  dyad  level,  logistical  capability  can  be  considered
to  be  a  part  of  the  overall  supply  chain  capability.

In  this  paper,  however,  we   study  the  logistical  capability  of
the  host  country  and  its  effect  on  the  organizations  in  that  coun-
try.  The  importance  of  macro-level  factors,  factors  at  levels  higher
than  the  ﬁrm  such  as  industry  and  country,  has  gained  importance
with  the  increase  of  international  trade,  and  the  global  spread  of
supply  chains  (Kinra  and  Kotzab,  2008).  Some  authors  argue  that
traditional  logistical  activities  of  warehousing,  transportation,  and
customs  clearance  are  no  longer  core  activities  for  many  ﬁrms
because  ﬁrms  are  able  to  access  macro-level  logistical  capabilities
from  their  logistics  environment  (Zacharia  et  al.,  2011).  The  pres-
ence  and  quality  of  such  macro-level  logistical  capabilities  can  have
a  signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  on  how  organizations  operate  their  supply
chains  and  how  they  coordinate  with  their  supply  chain  partners.
We  deﬁne  the  macro-level  logistical  capabilities  of  a  country
as  the  quality  and  breadth  of  logistics  services  and  infrastructure
available  to  plants  located  in  that  country  (Arvis  et  al.,  2010).  Logis-
tics  services  generally  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  transportation,
warehousing,  electronic  information  sharing,  supply  chain  visibil-
ity,  and  cross-docking.  Infrastructure  elements  include  supportive
customs  regulation  and  speed  of  customs  procedures,  and  quality
and  cost  of  physical  transportation  infrastructure  such  as  roads,
ports  and  airports.

Organizations  with  access  to  high  quality  cost-efﬁcient  logisti-
cal  capabilities  can  often  outsource  certain  logistics  tasks  and/or
devote  fewer  internal  resources  to  these  tasks.  For  instance,  in
countries  with  good  roads  and  predictable  customs  clearance,
delivery  times  will  be  both  shorter  and  more  certain.  Increased
certainty  has  been  linked  to  decreased  needs  for  coordinative  inte-
gration  (Gimenez  et  al.,  2012;  van  Donk  and  van  der  Vaart,  2004).
To  effectively  move  goods  requires  coordination  between  all
links  in  the  supply  chain.  When  the  logistical  capability  of  a  country
is  weak  or  poorly  developed  coordination  tasks  will  have  to  be  car-
ried  out  by  the  members  of  the  chain  themselves.  However,  when
the  logistical  capability  is  well  developed  the  need  for  coordination
may   be  reduced  and/or  other  entities  such  as  third  party  logistics
providers  can  start  taking  over  the  coordination  role  between  the
focal  ﬁrm  and  its  suppliers  and  customers  (Zacharia  et  al.,  2011).
The  existence  of  well-developed  logistics  infrastructure  and  ser-
vices;  a  well-developed  logistical  capability,  in  a  country  should
reduce  uncertainty,  provide  more  competitive  service  options,  and
generally,  make  coordination  between  members  of  a  supply  chain
easier.

When  the  logistical  capability  of  a  country  is  poor,  logistics  will
be  slow,  unpredictable  and/or  expensive  and  the  supply  chain  will
effectively  have  to  take  on  most  of  the  coordinative  role  itself  to

control  costs,  lead-times  and  ﬂexibility.  But  when  a  country’s  logis-
tical  capability  is  well-developed  logistics  will  be  fast,  predictable
and  inexpensive,  which  will  allow  supply  chain  members  to  expend
fewer  resources  on  the  coordinative  aspects  of  integration,  reduc-
ing  costs  and  or  allowing  the  chain  to  use  those  resources  to  engage
in  collaborative  activities.  Supply  chains  would  then  reduce  their
level  of  CEI  in  response  to  higher  logistical  capabilities  in  a  country.
However,  this  does  not  mean  that  all  types  of  integration  would
decrease,  rather  it  is  possible  that  collaborative  activities  could
increase.

In  hypothesis  1  we  proposed  that  CEI  in  general  has  a  positive
impact  on  performance,  a  ﬁnding  that  is  broadly  in  line  with  the
literature.  However,  the  literature  also  suggests  that  the  need  for
integration  is  contingent  on  numerous  factors  including  logistical
capabilities  (Gimenez  et  al.,  2012;  van  der  Vaart  and  van  Donk,
2006;  van  Donk  and  van  der  Vaart,  2004;  Welker  et  al.,  2008).
These  logistical  capabilities  can  be  present  in  a  supply  chain  and  a
country,  and  we  propose  that  plants  located  in  countries  with  supe-
rior  logistical  capabilities  will  adopt  lower  levels  of  CEI  relative  to
plants  in  countries  with  poor  logistical  capabilities.  Subsequently,
we  propose  the  following  hypothesis.

H2.  The  higher  the  logistical  capability  of  country  the  lower  the
average  level  of  CEI  for  plants  located  in  that  country.

Fig.  1  displays  the  relationships  of  interest.

2.3.  Does  LPI  moderate  the  CEI  performance  relationship?

LPI  is  an  understudied  environmental  contingency  that  could
impact  a  ﬁrm’s  supply-chain  relationships.  Contingency  theory
allows  for  two  types  of  effects:  (1)  the  environmental  contin-
gency’s  direct  impact  on  a  ﬁrm’s  structure  or  practices,  and  (2)  the
environmental  contingency’s  moderating  impact  on  the  relation-
ship  between  the  ﬁrm’s  structure  or  practices  and  performance
(Venkatraman,  1989;  Drazin  and  Van  de  Ven,  1985).  Firms  who
understand  the  role  of  the  contingency  would  choose  their  struc-
ture  or  practices  based  on  the  environmental  contingency;  in  this
case  LPI.  Hypothesis  2,  that  LPI  inﬂuences  the  level  of  CEI  adopted,
addresses  this  ﬁrst  effect.

For  managers  to  make  adjustments  to  CEI  based  on  the  cur-
rent 
level  of  LPI  they  would  need  to  be  fully  rational  and
have  complete 
information.  But  as  Autry  and  Golicic  (2010)
note  buyer  supplier  relationships  evolve  over-time  due  to  the
“bounded  rationality  of  human  actors  or  groups,  who  are  con-
stantly  forced  to  adjust  to  externalities  because  they  lack  adequate

inertia  and 

information  related  to  a  focal  situation,  or  are  unwilling  or  unable
to  alter  behaviour  in  spite  of  changing  conditions  (p.  89)”.  Addi-
tionally,  supply-chain  relationships  tend  to  be  sticky  due  to
institutional  norms.  Firms  develop
organizational 
social  capital  with  their  supply-chain  partners  and  ﬁnd  it  hard
to  adjust  the 
in  the  relationship  or  dis-
card  the  relationship  even  when  it  does  not  add  value  (Villena
et  al.,  2011).  Thus  we   also  expect  to  see  the  second,  moderating
effect  in  our  sample  with  LPI  moderating  the  CEI–performance
relationship.

integration 

level  of 

Speciﬁcally,  for  plants  located  in  countries  with  poorly  devel-
oped  or  low  logistical  capabilities,  increases  in  CEI  will  lead  to
signiﬁcant  increases  in  operational  performance.  However,  for
plants  located  in  countries  with  high  levels  of  logistical  capabilities
an  increase  in  coordinative  integration  will  have  a  lesser  impact
on  operational  performance.  Critically,  the  beneﬁts  to  increasing
coordinative  integration  will  be  larger  for  plants  in  countries  with
limited  logistical  capabilities.

Integration  is  not  costless  (Das  et  al.,  2006)  and  if  the  need
for  coordinative  integration  decreases  as  logistical  capabilities
improve,  then  the  return  from  integration  should  decrease  as
country-level  logistical  capabilities  increase.  This  reduction  in  the
return  from  integration  would  happen  because  a  supply  chain
located  in  a  country  with  high  logistical  capabilities  that  also  pur-
sues  high  levels  of  CEI  will  be  incurring  unnecessary  costs  and
creating  redundant  capabilities.  A  country  with  a  well-developed
logistical  capability  will  have  high  quality  third-party  logistics
providers  that  specialize  in  transportation  and  handling  of  mate-
rials  and  goods  at  competitive  prices.  These  specialized  logistics
providers  can  often  achieve  efﬁciencies  of  scale  and  beneﬁts  from
specialization  that  make  their  costs  far  less  than  companies  for
whom  transportation  is  just  one  element  of  manufacturing  and
operations  (Daugherty  et  al.,  1996;  Knemeyer  and  Murphy,  2004).
Firms  located  in  such  countries  could  reduce  their  costs  by  out-
sourcing  logistics  activities  to  such  low-cost  providers  in  addition
to  beneﬁting  from  the  advantages  of  a  high  quality  logistics  infra-
structure.  Subsequently,  we  propose  the  following  hypothesis.

H3a.  The  impact  of  CEI  on  cost  performance  is  moderated  by  a
country’s  logistical  capability  with  CEI  having  a  stronger  positive
impact  on  cost  performance  in  countries  with  low  logistical  capa-
bilities.

Countries  with  high  logistical  capabilities  will  have  fast  customs
clearance  and  quick  transportation  of  goods  leading  to  reduced
lead-times  from  suppliers,  and  reduced  lead-times  for  deliveries


F.  Wiengarten  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Operations  Management  32  (2014)  51–63 

55

to  customers.  Equally  important,  a  well-developed  logistical  capa-
bility  will  mean  greater  ease 
in  predicting  when  things  will
arrive.  Fast  predictable  delivery  time  is  an  important  element  of
supply  chain  and  operational  performance  as  it  impacts  coordi-
nation  needs,  inventory  levels  and  operational  planning  (Naylor
et  al.,  1999).  We   expect  plants  that  have  access  to  high  quality
country-level  logistical  capabilities  to  face  shorter  lead-times  and
have  less  coordination  needs,  therefore  the  value  of  coordinative
integration  for  these  plants  would  be  less  than  for  organiza-
tions  located  in  countries  where  transportation  times  are  longer
and/or  unpredictable.  High  country-level  logistical  capabilities  also
imply  greater  reliability  of  the  logistics  infrastructure  and  logistics
providers.  Thus,  it  would  be  easier  for  ﬁrms  to  access  reliable  logis-
tics  services  at  competitive  rates  and  hence  improve  their  delivery
performance.  Subsequently,  we  propose  the  following  hypothesis.
H3b.  The  impact  of  CEI  on  delivery  performance  is  moderated  by
a  country’s  logistical  capability  with  CEI  having  a  stronger  positive
impact  on  delivery  performance  in  countries  with  low  logistical
capabilities.

Well-developed  logistical  capabilities  mean  shorter  lead-times
to  move  both  goods  and  information,  thus  making  it  easier  to
change  order  composition  and/or  due  dates.  Short  predictable  tran-
sit  times  and  the  ease  of  getting  goods  through  customs  also  mean
that  less  safety  stock  is  present  in  the  system.  This  makes  it  easier  to
produce  to  customer  orders  or  to  schedule  production  close  to  the
delivery  date,  and  hence  allows  for  a  greater  ability  to  handle  chang-
ing  orders,  both  in  terms  of  speciﬁcations  and  quantities.  In  such
an  environment,  the  impact  of  CEI  on  ﬂexibility  will  be  reduced.
Therefore,  in  low  logistical  capability  environments  we  expect  that
CEI  will  have  a  higher  positive  impact  on  ﬂexibility  performance.
Subsequently,  we  propose  the  following  hypothesis.

H3c.  The  impact  of  CEI  on  ﬂexibility  performance  is  moderated  by
a  country’s  logistical  capability  with  CEI  having  a  stronger  positive
impact  on  ﬂexibility  performance  in  countries  with  low  logistical
capabilities.

Logistical  capabilities  are  hypothesized  to  have  a  relationship
with  coordination  needs  in  a  supply  chain.  As  logistical  capabilities
increase  a  supply  chain  may   need  less  CEI.

CEI  explicitly  excludes  collaborative  practices  such  as  early  sup-
ply  involvement  in  design.  And  while  quality  is  generally  seen
as  a  critical  dimension  of  operational  performance  (Ketokivi  and
Schroeder,  2004)  the  linkage  between  coordinative  practices  and
quality  is  relatively  weak.  Similarly,  the  impact  of  country-level
logistical  capabilities  on  a  ﬁrm’s  quality  outcomes  is  likely  indirect.
In  countries  with  poor  infrastructure  there  is  likely  more  breakage
due  to  poor  roads  and  antiquated  material  handling.  However,  this
impact  is  just  as  likely  to  show  up  in  a  plant’s  cost  performance  as
quality  performance.  And  in  countries  with  well-developed  infra-
structure  companies  may   either  chose  to  reduce  CEI  alone  to  save
resources,  or  they  may   invest  the  resources  not  expended  on  CEI  on
more  collaborative  behaviours.  Therefore,  the  study  does  not  pro-
pose  or  test  a  hypothesis  for  the  integration  quality  performance
linkage  even  though  the  data  set  did  measure  quality  performance.

3.  Research  method

3.1.  Sampling  and  data  collection

Data  collected  through  the  International  Manufacturing  Strategy
Survey  (IMSS)  was  used  to  explore  the  research  questions.  The  IMSS
is  a  global  network  of  business  schools  that  collaborate  with  each
other  and  manufacturing  companies  to  develop  a  common  survey
instrument  and  data  collection  protocol  for  the  global  study  of  man-
ufacturing  management.  The  network  was  originally  set  up  in  1992

by  a  group  of  20  business  schools  led  by  the  London  Business  School
(UK)  and  Chalmers  University  of  Technology  (Sweden).  Today  the
network  is  coordinated  by  Politecnico  di  Milano  (Italy)  (Laugen  and
Boer,  2011).  The  data  used  in  this  study  was  collected  in  2009  as
part  of  the  ﬁfth  iteration  of  the  survey.

This  research  uses  two  subsets  of  the  IMSS  data-set.  First,  we
use  all  responses  for  which  we   had  complete  data  for  measure
development.  The  initial  IMSS  sample  was  comprised  of  637  plants
located  in  19  countries  situated  in  Europe,  Asia  and  North  Amer-
ica.  This  research  uses  a  subset  of  the  IMSS  data  set  from  the  435
plants  with  complete  data  for  measure  development.  To  ensure  that
there  are  no  systematic  differences  between  the  subsample  of  435
used  for  measure  development  and  the  overall  IMSS  sample  we
conducted  independent  sample  t-tests  using  industry,  size,  mar-
ket  share,  ROS  and  ROI.  Results  indicate  that  mean  scores  between
−1.182),  size  (p  =  .803;  t  =  0.250),  market
for  industry  (p  =  .238;  t  = 
share  (p  =  .639;  t  =  0.469),  ROS  (p  =  .693;  t  =  0.395)  and  ROI  (p  =  .728;
t  =  0.395)  are  not  signiﬁcantly  different.  Furthermore,  results  from
the  Levene’s  test  for  equality  of  variance  also  indicate  that  the
variances  do  not  differ  between  industry  (p  =  .063;  F  =  3.761),  size
(p  =  .529;  F  =  0.369),  market  share  (p  =  .664;  F  =  0.189),  ROS  (p  =  .817;
F  =  0.054)  and  ROI  (p  =  .395;  F  =  0.724)  in  the  two  datasets.  The  sub-
sample  we   use  for  measure  development  does  not  systematically
differ  from  the  overall  IMSS  data  set  on  these  contextual  metrics.
Model  testing  was  done  using  348  plants  with  complete  data
located  in  16  of  the  19  countries.  Testing  H3  required  median  split-
ting  the  sample  based  on  LPI.  For  this  sample  the  median  LPI  value  is
3.64.  Italy,  Korea  and  Spain  lie  almost  precisely  on  the  median  and
we  are  unable  to  classify  them  as  low  or  high  LPI  for  this  sample,  so
we  removed  them.  To  be  consistent  we  tested  all  models  with  these
348  plants  located  in  16  countries.  This  gives  us  two   groups  that  do
not  overlap  with  respect  to  LPI.  For  robustness  we  ran  the  analysis
including  Italy,  Korea  and  Spain  as  well  and  found  that  removing
these  three  countries  that  lie  on  the  median  does  not  change  any
of  our  conclusions.

A  common  research  methodology  was  used  in  each  country  to
ensure  that  data  was   sampled  the  same  way   in  all  countries.  In  all
countries:
• A  common  questionnaire  (translated  as  needed)  was  given  to
respondents.
• The  production  manager  was  the  target  respondent  and  all  items
used  in  this  analysis  were  speciﬁcally  for  the  plant  where  the
production  manager  worked  –  not  the  business  unit  or  company.
• Respondent  plants  were  those  with  more  than  50  employees
involved  in  assembly  manufacturing  (ISIC  codes  28–35;  see
Table  2).

The  IMSS  sample  is  designed  to  generalize  to  the  population
of  assembly  manufacturing  plants  with  more  than  50  employees.
The  strength  of  the  IMSS  data  set  is  its  magnitude,  global  reach,  the
involvement  of  companies  in  the  development  of  the  survey  and  its
history.  The  sample  size  is  relatively  large  by  supply  chain  manage-
ment  standards  and  issues  surrounding  the  power  to  detect  effects
are  minimized.  Data  comes  from  19  countries  with  good  coverage  of
Europe,  The  Americas  and  Asia.  The  active  involvement  of  compa-
nies  means  that  instruments  have  high  levels  of  relevance  and  are
extensively  pre-tested  by  managers  so  content  validity  has  been
carefully  addressed.  Finally,  the  data  used  in  this  research  comes
from  the  ﬁfth  iteration  of  the  survey  which  means  that  the  instru-
ments  and  protocols  are  well  tested  and  familiar  to  researchers  as
evidenced  by  some  of  the  important  research  to  come  out  of  earlier
versions  of  the  survey  (e.g.  Cagliano  and  Spina,  2000;  da  Silveira,
2005;  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001;  Voss  and  Blackmon,  1998).

However,  sampling  is  not  random,  with  some  organizations  vol-
unteering  to  participate.  The  end  result  is  a  large  sample  of  plants

with  more  than  50  employees  in  a  limited  number  of  similar  man-
ufacturing  industries  that  was  not  randomly  selected.  The  IMSS
survey  provides  some  subjective  information  about  the  ﬁnancial
performance  of  the  respondents.  Respondents  rated  their  plant’s
performance  relative  to  their  main  competitor(s)  (on  a  scale  from
1  =  much  worse;  3  =  equal;  5  =  much  better)  in  terms  of  market
share,  return  on  sales  (ROS)  and  return  on  investments  (ROI).
Descriptive  statistics  indicate  that  on  average  respondents  view
their  ﬁnancial  performance  to  be  about  equal  in  comparison  to  their
main  competitor(s)  (mean  scores:  market  share  =  3.34;  ROS  =  3.26;
ROI  =  3.22).  While  the  sample  is  non-random  the  respondents  are
(in  their  own  estimation)  fairly  average  performers.

Given  the  sample’s  breadth,  reach  and  the  nearly  average  mean
performance  scores,  it  is  likely  that  the  sample  is  a  reasonable
reﬂection  of  larger  plants  in  these  industries.  So  while  the  non-
random  nature  of  the  sample  is  clearly  a  limitation,  the  data  should
provide  valid  insights  about  the  relationships  of  interest  on  average
for  the  target  population.

We   tested  our  sample  for  common  method  bias  or  vari-
ance.  We   assessed  common  method  bias  through  the  Harman’s
one  factor  test  (Sanchez  and  Brock,  1996).  Results  indicate  that
the  single  factor  model  produced  a  signiﬁcantly  worse  model
ﬁt  compared  to  our  proposed  and  conﬁrmed  ﬁve  factor  model
((cid:2)2/df  =  24.03;  RMSEA  =  0.191;  AGFI  =  0.52;  CFI  =  0.76;  GFI  =  0.61;
IFI  =  0.76;  NFI  =  0.75;  RFI  =  0.72).

In  order  to  measure  the  logistical  capability  of  countries  we   uti-
lized  data  collected  by  the  “International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and
Development/The  World  Bank”.  Speciﬁcally,  we  used  the  LPI  country
scores  assessed  through  the  “Connecting  to  Compete:  Trade  Logis-
tics  in  the  Global  Economy”  survey  (Arvis  et  al.,  2010).  This  survey
used  more  than  5000  individual  country  speciﬁc  scores  to  compare
the  trade  and  logistics  performance  of  155  countries.  Data  was  col-
lected  through  a  structured  online  survey  of  logistics  professionals
from  international  logistics  companies.  Nearly,  1000  logistics  pro-
fessionals  from  130  countries  participated.  Survey  respondents  had
positions  such  as  senior  executives  (35%),  area  or  country  managers
(25%),  and  department  managers  (24%)  (Arvis  et  al.,  2010).  The  LPI
data  was  collected  in  2009,  the  same  year  as  the  survey  data  making
the  LPI  data  a  good  indication  of  the  logistical  capabilities  in  each
country  at  the  time  of  the  IMSS  data  collection.

3.2.  Measures

This  study  focuses  on  collaborative 

integrative  behaviours
between  a  focal  ﬁrm  and  its  customers  and  suppliers.  The  scope
of  integration  examined  is  purposefully  limited  to  actions  to  coor-
dinate  supply  chain  ﬂows,  actions  that  could  become  less  necessary
when  operating  in  countries  with  strong  logistical  capabilities.  The
measures  for  the  customer  and  supplier  dimensions  of  external
integration  reﬂect  this  deﬁnition,  with  items  addressing  issues  such
as  planning,  forecasting,  and  coordination,  not  strategy  or  design.
Respondents  addressed  identical  questions  with  regards  to  how
they  coordinate  planning  decisions  and  the  ﬂow  of  goods  with  their
plant’s  key/strategic  suppliers  and  customers.  Based  on  previous
research  (e.g.  Kraljic,  1983)  these  are  the  customers  and  suppliers
who  a  focal  ﬁrm  would  most  need  to  be  integrated  with.  Customer
and  supplier  integration  were  each  measured  through  six  items
ranging  from  one  (none)  to  ﬁve  (high)  indicating  the  level  of  adop-
tion.  The  items  are  similar  to  those  used  in  previous  studies  (e.g.
Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001).  The  customer  and  supplier  items
are  listed  in  Table  3.

Operational  performance  was  measured  across  the  dimensions
of  cost,  ﬂexibility  and  delivery  (Rosenzweig  and  Roth,  2004;  Shin
et  al.,  2000).  Respondents  were  asked  to  address  multiple  items
for  each  dimension  indicating  their  performance  relative  to  their
main  competitors’  performance  on  a  5-point  Likert-scale  where  1
indicates  much  worse,  3  equal,  and  5  much  better.  The  performance
items  are  also  listed  in  Table  3.

Logistical  capability  was   assessed  using  LPI  data  collected  by  The
International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development/The  World

indicated  that  the  six  items  loaded  unidimensionally  on  LPI.  Hence,
LPI  is  a  one-dimensional  measure,  which  was  calculated  through
normalizing  the  weighted  average  of  the  scores  (Arvis  et  al.,  2010).
In  addition,  we  employed  four  control  variables  to  ensure  the
generalizability  of  our  results.  We   control  for  industry  because  the
importance  of  CEI  and  logistics  likely  varies  by  industry  (Sanchez
and  Perez,  2005).  The  industry  measure  was  based  on  ISIC  codes.
We  control  for  the  respondent  plant’s  position  in  the  supply  chain
because  assembly  manufacturers  who  create  modules  for  other
ﬁrms  likely  have  different  logistical  needs  than  assembly  man-
ufactures  who   deal  with  end  consumers.  Position  in  the  supply
chain  was  measured  as  the  percentage  of  sales  to  end-users.  Finally,
the  LPI  measure  is  limited  to  the  respondent  plant’s  country,  yet
the  logistical  capabilities  in  supplier  and  customer  countries  could
mater.  To  determine  if  this  is  an  issue  we  control  for  the  amount
of  global  sourcing  and  sales  a  plant  is  engaged  in.  Global  sourc-
ing/sales  were  measured  as  the  percentage  of  suppliers/customers
located  outside  the  respondent  plant’s  country.

3.3.  Reliability  and  validity

We   conducted  conﬁrmatory  factor  analysis  (CFA)  using  all
plants  with  complete  data,  to  validate  our  measures  and  to
conﬁrm  our  proposed  factor  structure. 
In  the  following,  we
analyze  and  discuss  validity  in  terms  of  content  validity,  con-
vergent  validity,  discriminant  validity  and  reliability  (Anderson

and  Gerbing,  1988;  Nunnally,  1978).  First,  content  validity  is
addressed  through  the  several  development  and  design  stages
of  the  IMSS  survey  that  include  key  contributions  from  man-
agers  as  well  as  academics.  Second,  we  used  our  CFA  results  to
test  for  convergent  validity  as  suggested  by  O’Leary-Kelly  and
Vokurka  (1998).  Our  proposed  structure  of  the  items  measuring
the  two  dimensions  of  supply  chain  integration  and  three  dimen-
sions  of  operational  performance  resulted  in  a  reasonably  good
ﬁtting  model  ((cid:2)2/df  =  2.52;  RMSEA  =  0.049;  AGFI  =  0.92;  CFI  =  0.98;
GFI  =  0.94;  IFI  =  0.98;  NFI  =  0.97;  RFI  =  0.96)  indicating  convergent
validity  (Bollen,  1989).  Furthermore,  all  factor  loadings  exceeded
the  value  of  .50  and  the  t-values  were  all  greater  than  2.0  (see
Table  3)  (Vickery  et  al.,  2003).  Finally,  the  factor  loadings  all
exceeded  twice  the  value  of  their  associated  standard  error,  which
further  indicates  convergent  validity  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010).

To  test  for  discriminant  validity  we   conducted  CFA  using  a  con-
strained  model  with  every  possible  pair  of  latent  constructs  and
set  the  correlations  between  the  paired  constructs  to  1.0  (Flynn
et  al.,  2010).  We   compared  the  obtained  results  with  the  original
(cid:2)2 differences  indicate  dis-
unconstrained  model.  Results  regarding 
criminant  validity  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  O’Leary-Kelly  and  Vokurka,
1998).

Finally,  Cronbach’s  alpha  (˛)  has  been  used  to  test  for  reliabil-
ity.  The  Cronbach’s  alpha  values  listed  in  Table  3  are  all  above  the
commonly  accepted  level  of  .70,  which  indicates  that  reliability
is  relatively  high.  Based  on  the  above  analyses,  the  validity  and

reliability  of  our  scales  were  established.  Subsequently,  we  contin-
ued  with  our  analysis  by  computing  the  mean  composite  scores  of
the  scales  (based  on  the  CFA  results)  measuring  customer  integra-
tion,  supplier  integration,  cost  performance,  delivery  performance
and  ﬂexibility  performance  to  be  used  in  the  following  modelling
approach  (Table  4).

4.  Results

The  model  in  Fig.  1  was  tested  using  Structural  Equation  Mod-
elling  (SEM)  because  SEM  allows  for  simultaneous  testing  of  the
hypotheses  using  latent  variables.  Because  we  propose  both  direct
and  moderation  effects  we   followed  the  approach  of  Byrne  (2006).
We  ﬁrst  test  for  the  direct  effect  using  the  entire  sample  and  then
test  for  moderation  by  splitting  the  sample  into  high  and  low  LPI
groups.  This  approach  has  previously  been  used  in  operations  man-
agement  research  as  well  (e.g.  Nyaga  et  al.,  2010).

The  model  in  ﬁgure  one  was  ﬁrst  tested  for  the  entire  sample
containing  high  and  low  LPI  countries  (16  countries  in  total)  to
address  hypotheses  1  and  2.  The  results  of  this  analysis  for  all  three
dependent  variables  are  shown  in  Table  5.  The  result  support  H1;
CEI  has  a  positive  impact  on  operational  performance  and  H2;  LPI
has  a  negative  impact  on  CEI.

H1  and  H2  are  supported.  The  model  ﬁt  is  adequate  with  CFI
around  0.92  and  RMSEA  always  less  than  0.064  (Hair  et  al.,  2007;
Byrne,  2006).  The  path  coefﬁcients  are  signiﬁcant  at  the  .05  or  .01
level  with  the  exception  of  supplier  integration’s  effect  on  delivery
performance.  Furthermore,  H2  is  supported  at  the  .01  level  for  all
models.  In  this  sample,  plants  are  choosing  their  level  of  customer
and  supplier  integration  based  partially  on  the  level  of  LPI  in  their
home  country.

Table  5
SEM  path  analysis:  results  for  hypotheses  1  and  2.

In  H3(a,b,c) we   proposed  that  the  operational  performance
impact  of  external  supply  chain  integration  is  moderated  by  a  coun-
try’s  logistical  capability.  To  test  this  hypothesis  we  use  the  median
level  of  LPI  to  split  the  sample  into  two  groups:  high  LPI  countries
and  the  associated  plants  and  low  LPI  countries  and  the  associated
plants.

Following  Byrne  (2006)  we   ﬁrst  establish  measurement  invari-
ance.  Second,  we   test  whether  we   have  structural  invariance  or
not.  A  lack  of  structural  invariance  would  suggest  that  the  path
coefﬁcients  differ  for  the  high  and  low  LPI  groups.  Third,  we  apply
equality  constraints  to  test  which  path  coefﬁcients  differ  between
the  high  and  low  LPI  groups.  The  path  coefﬁcients  that  are  signiﬁ-
cantly  different  for  the  two  groups  are  moderated  by  LPI.

To  test  for  measurement  invariance  we  ran  a  baseline  model
with  all  parameters  freely  estimated  for  the  two  groups.  Then  we
restricted  the  two   groups  to  have  equal  factor  loadings  to  test  for
measurement  invariance  (Byrne,  2006;  Nyaga  et  al.,  2010).  Chi-
square  difference  test  show  that  there  is  no  drop  in  model  ﬁt  by
forcing  factor  loadings  to  be  equal,  thus  establishing  measurement
(cid:2)2 =  9.99,
invariance  for  all  3  models  (Cost  performance  model: 
(cid:2)2 =  8.835,
df  =  12,  p-value  =  .62;  Flexibility  performance  model: 
(cid:2)2 =  8.49,
df  =  12,  p-value  =  .72;  Delivery  performance  model: 
df  =  11,  p-value  =  .67).

After  establishing  measurement  invariance  we  tested  for  struc-
tural  invariance.  We   forced  factor  loadings  and  path  coefﬁcients
to  be  equal  across  the  two   groups.  Results  indicated  signiﬁcant
p-values  for  cost  and  delivery  performance  at  the  .05  level  and
barely  signiﬁcant  p-value  of  .1  for  ﬂexibility  performance  (Cost  per-

df   =  18,  p-value  =  .044).  These

high  LPI  and  low  LPI  groups  for  cost,  ﬂexibility  and  delivery  perfor-
mance.  These  results  provide  initial  evidence  for  the  moderating
role  of  LPI  in  our  path  model.

Therefore,  we  continued  with  testing  which  paths  speciﬁ-
cally  are  being  moderated  by  LPI.  We   ﬁxed  the  factor  loadings
and  path  coefﬁcients  to  be  equal  across  the  two  groups  except
the  paths  leading  from  CEI  to  performance.  Results  show  sig-
niﬁcant  p-values  for  cost,  ﬂexibility  and  delivery  performance
indicating  that  the  CEI  to  performance  path  coefﬁcients  are  sig-
niﬁcantly  different  for  high  vs.  low  LPI  groups  (Cost  performance

model: 
df  =  2,  p-value  =  .0020;  Delivery

df  =  2,  p-value  =  .0275).  To  fur-
performance  model: 
ther  establish  that  LPI  is  not  moderating  the  other  paths  we  re-ran
the  same  analysis  but  allowed  the  paths  from  LPI  to  CEI  to  vary
across  the  groups.  These,  results  indicate  non-signiﬁcant  p-values
for  cost,  ﬂexibility  and  delivery,  showing  that  other  paths  do  not
vary  between  the  high  and  low  LPI  groups.

(cid:2)2 =  12.411, 

(cid:2)2 =  11.624, 

(cid:2)2 =  7.18, 

The  ﬁnal  step  in  the  analysis  examined  each  individual  CEI
to  performance  path.  Table  6  shows  the  differences  in  the  path
coefﬁcients  for  the  high  vs.  low  LPI  groups,  as  well  as  the  p-values
for  whether  the  differences  are  statistically  signiﬁcant.  The  results
indicate  that  the  path  coefﬁcients  between  coordinative  customer
integration  and  all  three  operational  performance  measures  are  sig-
niﬁcantly  greater  for  the  low  LPI  group  versus  the  high  LPI  group.
However,  the  results  show  no  differences  between  the  low  and
high  LPI  groups  in  the  path  coefﬁcients  for  coordinative  supplier
integration.  H3  posited  that  LPI  would  moderate  all  CEI  to  perfor-
mance  linkages;  the  results  show  strong  support  for  LPI  moderating

the  customer  integration  to  performance  relationship  but  no  sup-
port  for  LPI  moderating  the  supplier  integration  to  performance
relationship.

The  results  for  H2  showed  that  plants  were  basing  their  level  of
integration  partially  on  LPI.  The  results  for  H3  highlight  that  such
choices  are  rational.  The  beneﬁts  of  the  customer  integration  com-
ponent  of  CEI  drop  with  increases  in  LPI;  the  effect  of  customer
integration  on  performance  was  signiﬁcantly  less  in  the  high  LPI
settings  across  all  three  dimensions  of  operational  performance.
The  results  for  supplier  integration  do  not  indicate  moderation,  but
they  also  show  no  decrease  in  performance  for  the  ﬁrms  in  high  LPI
settings  who   have  lower  on  average  levels  of  supplier  integration
(Table  7).

In  conclusion,  our  results  provide  strong  support  for  H1  and  H2.
The  results  for  H3  are  not  unequivocal  but  they  do  support  the
moderation  hypotheses  with  ample  evidence  for  LPI  moderating
customer  integration.  In  this  sample  CEI  generally  improves  per-
formance,  levels  of  CEI  are  related  to  levels  of  LPI  and  LPI  likely
moderates  the  relationship  between  CEI  and  performance.

5.  Discussion

Previous  research  on  integration  has,  in  general,  concluded
that  integration  improves  performance.  However,  these  results  are
far  from  universal  because  integration  is  context  dependent  and
complex.  The  present  research  makes  a  contribution  to  our  under-
standing  of  integration  by  examining  a  novel  element  of  context
while  carefully  dealing  with  some  of  integration’s  complexity.

We   addressed  context  by  examining  a  speciﬁc  country  level  fac-
tor,  LPI,  because  it  has  been  posited  that  country-level  logistical
capabilities  have  important  implications  for  supply  chain  man-
agement  and  managers  (Kinra  and  Kotzab,  2008).  We   addressed
the  complexity  of  integration  by  focusing  on  the  dimensions  and
aspects  of  integration  most  related  to  LPI.  Logistical  capabilities
have  more  to  do  with  the  ﬂow  of  goods  and  information  between
plants  than  the  same  ﬂows  within  a  plant,  so  the  research  is  limited
to  external  integration.

More  importantly,  improved  logistical  capacities  in  a  country
could  allow  for  easier  coordination  of  a  supply  chain,  but  there  is
no  reason  to  assume  a  direct  relationship  between  LPI  and  col-
laboration.  Therefore  this  research  clearly  limits  its  scope  to  the
coordinative  aspects  of  external  integration.

Within  this  clearly  delineated  scope  we  address  the  questions
of  are  plants  choosing  their  degree  of  external  supply  chain  inte-
gration  based  on  their  country’s  logistical  capabilities,  and  does  a
country’s  logistical  capability  moderate  the  impact  of  external  sup-
ply  chain  integration  on  performance?  To  answer  these  questions
the  analysis  focused  on  three  hypotheses.

Hypothesis  1  posited  that  CEI  had  a  positive  impact  on  the  cost,
quality  and  ﬂexibility  dimensions  of  performance.  This  hypothesis
was  included  to  situate  the  results  of  the  present  research  with  pre-
vious  tests  of  the  integration/performance  relationship,  especially
studies  such  as  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  which  is  highly  cited
and  used  a  previous  version  of  the  IMSS  data  set  and  very  simi-
lar  measures  of  integration  and  performance.  Our  results  for  H1
are  broadly  in  line  with  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),  with  both
the  customer  and  supplier  aspects  of  CEI  generally  being  positively
related  to  performance.  However,  the  impact  of  supplier  integra-
tion  on  delivery  performance  was  not  signiﬁcant.  This  pattern  of
signiﬁcant  and  insigniﬁcant  results  mirror  Vereecke  and  Muylle’s
(2006)  results  for  the  information  exchange  aspect  of  integration
as  it  related  to  performance  from  an  earlier  version  of  the  IMSS
survey,  suggesting  that  this  relationship  is  stable  at  least  for  this
population.

In  addition,  while  we  acknowledge  that  suppliers  can  and
do  inﬂuence  the  ability  to  deliver  quickly  and  reliably  to  end-
customers  (the  focus  of  the  delivery  performance  metrics),  these
inﬂuences  are  fairly  stable  over  the  long  term  in  the  sense  that  if  a
supplier  that  cannot  be  replaced  or  improved  is  slow  or  unreliable
then  buffers  will  be  used  to  allow  at  a  minimum  order  qualiﬁer  lev-
els  of  delivery  reliability  and  speed.  Therefore,  the  impact  of  slow
or  unreliable  suppliers  in  these  performance  metrics  would  show
up  in  costs,  not  in  delivery  to  end-customers.  The  results  for  H1
then  are  generally  in  line  with  previous  research  that  concluded
that  integration  improves  performance  and  with  previous  research
from  earlier  rounds  of  the  IMSS  data  collection.

Hypothesis  2  addressed  the  ﬁrst  research  question  by  positing
that  the  higher  the  logistical  capability  of  a  country  the  lower  the
average  level  of  CEI  for  plants  located  in  that  country.  The  results
provide  strong  support  for  H2.  In  this  sample  CEI  decreases  as  LPI
increases.  This  is  true  for  both  the  supplier  and  customer  dimen-
sions  of  external  coordinative  integration  even  when  controlling
for  the  role  the  plant  plays  in  the  supply  chain  and  the  locations  of
customers  and  suppliers.

However,  the  results  say  nothing  about  the  collaborative  aspects
of  integration.  Improved  logistical  capabilities  in  a  country  would
likely  have  minimum  direct  impact  on  collaboration  between
ﬁrms.  But  there  is  likely  an  indirect  effect  that  is  not  captured
in  this  research.  Plants  in  countries  with  well-developed  logisti-
cal  capabilities  may   shift  resources  from  coordinative  activities
to  collaboration.  Increased  LPI  may   then  lead  to  decreases  in  CEI
but  increases  in  collaborative  external  integration.  Future  research
should  explore  this  possibility  since  it  has  signiﬁcant  managerial
and  policy  implications.

Hypothesis  3  addressed  the  second  research  question  by  posit-
ing  that  the  impact  of  CEI  on  performance  was  moderated  by  a
country’s  logistical  capability  with  CEI  having  a  stronger  positive
impact  on  performance  in  countries  with  low  logistical  capabili-
ties.  The  results  are  not  unequivocal,  but  the  results  suggest  that
plants  do  set  their  level  of  CEI  relative  to  the  level  of  LPI  in  their
home  country,  and  that  doing  so  is  rational,  with  the  returns  from
CEI  generally  decreasing  as  LPI  increases.

However,  the  moderation  effect  is  only  evident  for  the  customer
integration  aspect  of  CEI.  We   posit  that  this  is  due  to  measuring  LPI
based  on  the  location  of  the  focal  ﬁrm  in  the  supply  chain.  Customer
integration  is  the  link  going  out  from  the  focal  ﬁrm.  And  hence
it  is  likely  sensitive  to  the  level  of  LPI  in  the  focal  ﬁrm’s  country.
Following  the  same  logic  for  the  upstream  link,  supplier  integration
is  likely  more  dependent  on  the  level  of  LPI  in  supplier,  rather  than
buyer,  countries.  In  other  words  the  role  of  LPI  as  a  moderator  is
likely  stronger  from  the  perspective  of  the  organization  sending
goods  and  information  to  the  next  link  in  the  chain.  This  supposition
needs  to  be  tested  in  future  research.

In  addition,  one  of  the  novel  aspects  of  the  research,  the  inclusion
of  context  in  the  form  of  LPI  is  also  a  limitation.  Like  all  country-
level  variables,  the  value  of  LPI  is  the  same  for  all  plants  within
a  country.  Future  research  on  country-level  factors  in  general  or
LPI  speciﬁcally  will  be  well  served  by  expanding  the  coverage  to  a
larger  number  of  countries  to  reduce  this  effect.

Our  results  are  in  line  with  previous  work  that  examined  the
performance  beneﬁts  of  CEI  (e.g.  Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001;
Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012),  especially  when  dealing  with  key
or  strategic  suppliers  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010).  And  our  results  may  help
explain  why  Flynn  et  al.  (2010)  and  Robb  et  al.  (2008)  found  support
for  the  customer  integration–performance  linkage  with  samples
from  China  (with  a  relatively  low  LPI)  while  Swink  et  al.  (2007)  and
Devaraj  et  al.  (2007)  did  not  with  samples  from  the  United  States
(with  a  relatively  high  LPI).

We   ﬁnd  strong  support  for  two   of  our  hypotheses  and  moderate
support  for  the  third.  Still  the  study  is  limited  by  the  data,  research
design  and  methods.

There  is  tight  alignment  between  the  scope  of  integrative
activities  the  research  is  addressing  and  the  items  used  to  mea-
sure  integration.  The  measures  speciﬁcally  addressed  the  plant’s
key/strategic  customer  and  suppliers,  where  external  integration  is
most  likely  to  be  of  value  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010).  However,  the  meas-
ures  of  performance  could  be  more  precise.  In  addition,  all  items
are  self  reports  from  a  single  respondent  so  future  research  would
be  well  served  to  have  multiple  respondents.  Given  external  inte-
gration’s  inter-organizational  focus  these  respondents  should  be
from  focal  ﬁrms  and  their  suppliers  and  customers  (e.g.  Boyer  and
Verma,  2000).

The  research  is  also  limited  by  what  was  not  measured.  Future
research  should  include  both  the  collaborative  and  coordinative
aspects  of  integration,  in  a  manner  that  builds  on  the  work  of
Flynn  et  al.  (2010)  whose  integration  measures  do  include  both
aspects.  However,  we  would  suggest  that  further  reﬁnement  is
needed  both  to  develop  a  balance  of  collaborative  and  coordina-
tive  items  and  critically  that  this  development  needs  to  be  done
in  multiple  contexts.  Flynn  et  al.’s  ﬁnding  that  coordinative  and
collaborative  practices  load  on  a  single  factor  could  easily  be  an
artefact  of  their  setting,  a  low  LPI  country  where  companies  would
not  be  able  to  depend  on  the  local  infrastructure  and  or  third
party  providers  for  coordinative  tasks.  Future  research  should  also
include  internal  integration  because  while  there  may   be  no  direct
link  between  LPI  and  internal  integration,  internal  integration  has
been  linked  to  external  integration  and  performance  (Flynn  et  al.,
2010;  Schoenherr  and  Swink,  2012).

The  sample  is  large  and  represents  a  sizable  number  of  countries
providing  some  conﬁdence  that  the  results  would  generalize  to

61

other  large  organizations  in  these  industries  and  countries.  How-
ever,  random  sampling  is  critical  in  future  studies  to  increase
conﬁdence  in  these  results.  And  future  research  designs  need  to
increase  the  variance  in  country-level  factors  such  as  LPI.  This
should  be  done  in  conjunction  with  expanding  the  scope  to  include
less  developed  countries.  Based  on  these  results  one  would  pre-
dict  that  in  less  developed  countries  that  will  generally  have  poor
logistical  capabilities,  external  integration  will  be  critical.  But  that
assumption  needs  to  be  tested  since  it  is  possible  that  no  amount
of  integration  can  fully  make  up  for  a  lack  of  logistical  capabilities.
And  of  course  the  results  need  to  be  tested  in  other  industries  as
well.

the 

Finally, 

tests  are 

cross-sectional 

in  nature,  when
buyer/supplier  relationships  evolve  over  time  (Autry  and  Golicic,
2010).  Finding  support  for  H2  and  H3  simultaneously  may   be
a  result  of  the  cross-sectional  data.  Based  on  the  support  for
H2,  we  would  expect  that  managers  would  set  their  level  of  CEI
based  on  LPI.  Over  time  the  relationship  would  evolve  and  LPI
would  change,  decreasing  the  congruence  between  LPI  and  CEI.
Eventually  managers  would  recognize  that  the  environment  had
changed  and  adjust  their  level  of  CEI.  But  between  these  periods
of  adjustment  some  plants  would  have  the  wrong  level  of  CEI,
suggesting  that  the  effect  captured  in  H3  may   be  transitory  for  any
one  plant?  Hence  future  longitudinal  research  that  captured  the
constant  adjustment  of  CEI  based  on  contingencies  such  as  LPI,
might  only  show  support  for  H2?

Noting  the  limitations,  the  results  have  implications  for  pol-
icy,  practice  and  research.  From  a  policy  perspective  the  results
reinforce  the  need  for  countries  to  invest  in  the  development  of
logistical  capabilities;  a  ﬁnding  that  is  in  line  with  numerous  stud-
ies  that  try  to  calculate  loses  from,  for  example,  poor  infrastructure
(see  for  instance  ASCE,  2009).  Therefore,  the  obvious  recommen-
dation  is  that  governments  should  invest  in  logistics  to  improve
efﬁciency  and  industry  groups,  such  as  chambers  of  commerce,
should  support  such  investments  (Porter,  1990).

But  there  are  also  policy  implications  for  creating  and  main-
taining  innovation,  which  is  a  critical  goal  of  numerous  countries,
regions  and  even  universities  (e.g.  Innovation  Alliance,  2012;  OCED,
2009).  Having  high  logistical  capabilities  reduces  the  resources
needed  for  supply  chain  partners  to  coordinate  ﬂows,  freeing  those
resources  for  other  activities.  By  freeing  up  supply  chain  resources
a  country-level  logistical  capability  allows  supply  chain  partners  to
work  on  the  more  idiosyncratic  elements  of  their  relationship  such
as  product  and  process  design  and  hence  will  increase  the  odds  of
creating  truly  innovative  products  and  processes.

From  a  practice  standpoint  the  results  have  three  primary  impli-
cations.  First,  they  show  that  integration  is  indeed  contingent  on
many  factors,  including  macro-factors  that  most  individual  compa-
nies  will  only  be  able  to  respond  to.  So  while  we   ﬁnd  no  evidence
to  suggest  that  increased  coordinative  external  integration  is  bad
for  operational  performance,  previous  research  on  the  costs  of  inte-
grating  and  the  present  results  both  suggest  that  in  countries  with
well  developed  logistical  capabilities  companies  will  need  less  CEI
than  they  would  in  countries  with  less  developed  logistical  capa-
bilities.  The  ﬁrst  implication  for  practice  is  that  CEI  is  important,
but  contingent  on  country  conditions.

Similarly,  managers  need  to  be  aware  that  while  “extra”  CEI  may
not  directly  harm  operational  performance,  integration  has  costs
(Das  et  al.,  2006)  and  hence,  more  or  extra  CEI  means  resources
that  could  be  better  applied  elsewhere.  The  research  suggest  that
when  logistical  capabilities  exist  in  a  country  a  company  would
be  best  served  to  leverage  these  capabilities,  which  could  free  up
resources  for  more  collaborative  efforts  aimed  at  (re)  designing
the  supply  chain,  crafting  strategy  or  building  partnerships.  When
working  with  key  or  strategic  suppliers  in  a  high  LPI  setting,  orga-
nizations  should  spend  more  time  developing  the  partnership  and

creating  truly  inimitable  resources  and  less  time  on  coordinative
tasks.

Finally,  these  results  create  a  dilemma  for  companies  with  oper-
ations  in  multiple  locations,  since  they  suggest  that  attempts  to
centralize  supply  chain  policy  and  practice  will  lead  to  subopti-
mal   outcomes.  Centralization  is  usually  linked  to  efﬁciency  (Arnold,
1999;  Choi  and  Hong,  2002;  Kraljic,  1983),  but  the  results  make  it
clear  that  some  coordinative  practices  developed  in  response  to
poor  logistical  capabilities  will  be  unnecessary  in  countries  with
better  developed  capabilities.  Even  when  looking  at  the  same  buyer
and  supplier,  the  level  of  coordinative  integration  needed  to  man-
age  supply  chain  ﬂows  will  vary  with  location.

This  paper  also  has  numerous  research  implications.  Research  in
international  operations/supply  chain  management  has  expanded
greatly.  But  many  studies  control  for  country  without  really  explor-
ing  why   differences  other  than  those  related  to  culture  might
matter  (see  for  example  Rungtusanatham  et  al.,  2005  and  Power
et  al.,  2010  for  a  discussion).  By  introducing  other  country-level
factors  into  the  discussion  this  research  makes  a  vital  contribution
to  operations  and  supply  chain  management  research  in  general.

The  research  also  makes  contributions  to  the  literature  on  sup-
ply  chain  integration.  While  others  have  noted  the  multiple  aspects
of  integration,  there  is  little  previous  research  that  explicitly  sepa-
rates  the  coordinative  and  collaborative  aspects  of  integration  both
theoretically  and  in  measurement.  Our  results  show  that  external
integration  for  coordinative  purposes  is  generally  valuable,  but  its
value  is  greatest  when  a  country  has  limited  logistical  capabilities.
More  generally  this  research  provides  additional  nuanced  support
for  the  supposition  that  integration  will  be  contingent  on  numer-
ous  factors  (Fynes  et  al.,  2004;  Gimenez  et  al.,  2012;  van  der  Vaart
and  van  Donk,  2006;  van  Donk  and  van  der  Vaart,  2004;  Welker
et  al.,  2008).

6.  Conclusion

In  sum,  this  research  shows  that  CEI  matters  and  that  the  largest
performance  improvements  from  increased  coordinative  integra-
tion  will  accrue  to  organizations  located  in  countries  with  low  levels
of  logistical  capabilities.  The  research  makes  valuable  contributions
by  exploring  a  contingency  that  has  previously  not  been  addressed
in  the  operations  management  literature  and  which  is  out  of  the
control  of  most  organizations.

For  researchers,  the  results  provide  critical  contributions  to  two
discourses.  The  results  contribute  to  discussions  of  international
supply  chain  management  by  showing  that  exploring  country-level
differences  using  indicators  other  than  culture  will  enhance  knowl-
edge.  And  the  research  contributes  to  discussions  of  integration
by  furthering  the  understanding  of  the  contingent  nature  of  this
critical  construct.

For  managers  and  policy  makers,  the  results  show  not  only
how  country-level  investments  can  beneﬁt  individual  organiza-
tions,  but  that  managers  can  really  leverage  country-level  resources
in  a  manner  that  optimizes  operational  performance  and  may   free
up  internal  resources  to  create  new  products  and/or  processes.
Improving  a  port  is  then  not  just  an  investment  to  speed  transport
times,  it  may   be  a  way  to  increase  innovation  by  the  organizations
using  the  port.

Previous  research  had  concluded  that  the  complexity  of  supply
chains  was  increasing  due  to  intense  global  competition  and  hence
organizations  needed  to  integrate  their  supply  chains  (Flynn  et  al.,
2010).  Our  results  suggest  that  due  to  intense  global  competition,
investments 
in
improved  operational  performance,  but  by  allowing  supply  chains
to  focus  their  integrative  efforts  on  collaborative  tasks  such  as
building  relationships  and  creating  innovative  product  and  process

logistical  capabilities  will  pay-off  not  only

designs,  and  not  on  coordinative  tasks  such  as  trying  to  ensure
on-time  delivery.
