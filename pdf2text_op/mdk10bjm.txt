Our study draws on institutional and signalling theories to postulate relationships
between board characteristics and corporate reputation. Based on a sample of 324 ﬁrms
featured in Fortune’s list of most admired corporations in the USA, our ﬁndings
indicate that board characteristics signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the assessment of ﬁrm
reputation by the business community. Speciﬁcally, we found that ﬁrms with a greater
proportion of outside directors and those with larger boards exhibited better reputation
than those with smaller boards and a higher proportion of insiders. In addition, we
observed an inverted-U relationship between the average tenure of outside directors and
corporate reputation. However, contrary to expectations, our ﬁndings indicate a
negative association between independent leadership structure (i.e. absence of duality)
and corporate reputation.

Introduction

Lose money for the ﬁrm and I will be understanding;
lose a shred of reputation for the ﬁrm and I will be
ruthless. (Warren Buﬀet to Salomon Brothers’ emp-
loyees after he took over as Chairman in the aftermath
of the 1991 scandal)

Corporate reputation has been deﬁned as ‘a per-
ceptual representation of a company’s past actions
and future prospects that describe the ﬁrm’s
overall appeal to all
its key constituents when
compared to other leading rivals’ (Fombrun, 1996,
p. 72). It is a social construction that reﬂects
emotions held by stakeholders, representing what
they think and feel about the ﬁrm (Hall, 1992;
Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Corporate reputation
is also widely recognized as a valuable intangible
asset which can be one of the most important

sources of competitive advantage. The importance
of corporate reputation is also apparent from the
considerable attention that the topic has received
in the popular business press. There have also
been a number of reputation rankings published in
recent years. Perhaps the best known, and the
most widely used (by practitioners and academics
alike), is Fortune’s ‘Global Reputation Survey’,
which has been published yearly since its inception
in 1983. Other reputation rankings include the
Financial Times’s ‘World’s Most Respected Com-
panies’, Asian Business’s ‘Asia’s Most Admired
Companies’ and Manager Magazine’s ‘Reputation
Survey’.

Interest in corporate reputation research has
also grown dramatically over the past decade, with
several studies examining the antecedents and
outcomes of corporate reputation. Studies (e.g.
Basdeo et al., 2006; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990;
McGuire, Schneeweis and Branch, 1990; Rindova
et al., 2005) have uncovered several antecedents of
corporate reputation, including ﬁrm performance,
competitive actions, perceived product quality,

size, age and ﬁrm risk. However, research on the
role of board characteristics
in determining
corporate reputation has been conspicuous by its
absence. This is particularly surprising given the
prominent role that such characteristics have
played in corporate governance research
(e.g.
Dalton et al., 1998, 1999; Datta, Musteen and
Herrmann, 2009; Johnson, Daily and Ellstrand,
1996; Sanders and Carpenter, 1998) and the
increased scrutiny they have received from the
business community, regulators and corporate
governance watchdogs (Hymowitz, 2003). There
has also been considerable pressure on ﬁrms to
comply with good governance practices, with
companies often seeking the help of specialized
consultants in achieving such compliance (Engar-
dio and Arndt, 2007; Sonnenfeld, 2004).

prescriptions associated with observable board
characteristics translates into superior corporate

Following prior research (e.g. Basdeo et al., 2006;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; McGuire, Sundgren
and Schneeweis, 1988; Roberts and Dowling, 2002;
Staw and Epstein, 2000) our study was based on

respondents in the Fortune survey are likely to be

The remainder of our paper is organized as

theoretical perspectives that we draw on (namely,
signalling and institutional theory) in explaining
the relationships between board attributes and
corporate reputation. This section also brieﬂy

ﬁndings of our analyses. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our ﬁndings for theory, practice
and future research.

Theoretical perspectives and empirical
evidence

According to Clark and Montgomery (1998),
corporate reputation is a reﬂection of the impres-
sions of key stakeholders of a ﬁrm, one that
incorporates information on how a ﬁrm com-
pares with its competitors. Several theoretical
perspectives have been used to explain the deter-
minants of such reputation. Economists have
viewed reputation as an attribute that helps
stabilize interactions between ﬁrms and their re-
source providers by enabling market participants
make better predictions of ﬁrms’ future beha-
viours (Cornell and Shapiro, 1987; Fombrun,
2001). Superior reputation has also been asso-
ciated with lower transaction costs and a reduced
need for
contracts between parties
(Dollinger, Golden and Saxton, 1997). From an
industrial organization perspective, corporate
reputation is visualized as an important diﬀer-
entiating factor, contributing to increased entry
and mobility barriers (Wilson, 1985), reduced
bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and
lower price-based rivalry (Ferguson, Deephouse
and Ferguson, 2000; Porter, 1980). Resourced-
based theorists (e.g. Barney, 1986), on the other
hand, see corporate reputation as a key intangi-
ble resource that represents an important source
of sustainable competitive advantage.

explicit

Two theoretical perspectives, namely signalling
and institutional
theory, provide particularly
useful guidance in understanding the implications
of board characteristics from the standpoint of
corporate reputation. Signalling theory, which
emanated from the study of the economics of
information, suggests that signals representing
ﬁrm actions and announcements convey impor-
tant information about ﬁrm intentions and abili-
ties (Porter, 1980; Spence, 1973). While Spence
(1973)
initially used signalling theory in the
context of labour markets, the theory can be
meaningfully applied to the study of corporate
reputation. The central tenet of signalling theory
in the context of ﬁrm reputation is that informa-
tion asymmetry results in external constituents
having to rely on various signals in forming


500

judgements about reputation (Certo, Daily and
Dalton, 2001; Fombrun, 2001; Spence, 1973). As
such, reputation can be visualized as an outcome
of a signalling process, wherein signals in the
form of ﬁrm attributes are used by constituents to
make reputational judgements related to the ﬁrm
(Basdeo et al., 2006). In the context of Fortune
measures, such constituents are primarily senior
executives, directors and corporate analysts, who
make ‘reputational’ assessments based on infor-
mation they perceive as being relevant.

Fombrun and Shanley (1990) argue that,

in
addition to ﬁrm performance, constituents rely on
signals related to other organizational attributes to
form judgements about ﬁrms’ relative reputational
merits. However, in order to have a meaningful
impact, such signals must be observable and be
perceived as reasonable proxies of ﬁrms’
true
attributes (Deutsch and Ross, 2003). Since infor-
mation on board characteristics is readily available
to the business community, it can be argued that
they represent valid signals that communicate
important information related to the assessment
of ﬁrm reputation. Such signals pertain to a ﬁrm’s
decision making quality, managerial accountability
to shareholders, and connectedness to vital re-
sources. As such, they are likely to assist evaluators
in their construction of judgements related to ﬁrm
reputation (Certo, 2003; Deutsch and Ross, 2003).
Indeed, as the study of Italian ﬁrms by Gabbione-
ta, Ravasi and Mazzola (2007) suggests,
the
conﬁguration of governance structures (including
board of directors) is likely to be one of the key
drivers of corporate reputation.

Institutional theory (e.g. Meyer and Rowan,
1977) too provides important insights into the
potential
impact of board characteristics on
corporate reputation. While some institutional
theorists (e.g. Rao, 1994) have conceptualized
reputation as an outcome of the legitimization
process, others have viewed reputation and legi-
timacy as two conceptually distinct constructs.
For example, Deephouse and Carter (2005) see
legitimacy as a result of compliance with iso-
morphic pressures and reputation as an outcome
of social comparison. However, there is general
consensus that both legitimacy and reputation
are socially derived judgements based on ﬁrms’
past behaviours, have similar antecedents and
consequences, and involve similar social pro-
cesses (Deephouse and Carter, 2005). In the
context of board composition, institutional the-

ory arguments suggest that ﬁrms are likely to
adopt certain practices given their desire to
conform to institutional norms (DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983). In doing so, ﬁrms that are unsure
of what constitutes good practice are likely to
seek legitimacy by imitating the board character-
istics of ﬁrms they perceive as being successful.
Doing so conveys to constituents the notion of
responsible management, pleases external obser-
vers, and avoids claims of negligence if anything
goes wrong (Meyer and Rowan, 1977). As argued
by King and Whetten (2008), when ﬁrms app-
roach what the institutional ﬁeld considers ‘ideal
standards of behaviour’ it not only enhances their
legitimacy but also their reputation. Recently,
there has been some debate about what consti-
tutes good governance practices and what attri-
butes of corporate boards are seen as being
desirable (Sonnenfeld, 2004). However, the general
consensus among corporate watchdog groups is
that characteristics representing board composi-
tion, size, the tenure of directors and leadership
structure are particularly important. We posit that
ﬁrms with boards that exhibit desirable attributes
be viewed more positively from a corporate
reputation standpoint.

In sum, both signalling and institutional theories
suggest that ﬁrms which adopt governance prac-
tices that are perceived as being desirable are more
likely to be favourably viewed by the members of
the business community. In the following section,
we draw on these two theoretical perspectives
to develop speciﬁc hypotheses on the relation-
ships between board characteristics and corporate
reputation.

Research hypotheses

Board characteristics have featured prominently
in extant governance research. Characteristics
that have been widely examined include board
composition (the proportion of outsiders), board
size, leadership structure (i.e. separation of the
positions of the CEO and board chair), and the
tenure of outside directors (e.g. Johnson, Daily
and Ellstrand, 1996; Kosnik, 1990; Zahra and
Pearce, 1989). Given the high visibility and broad
public acceptance of these four attributes, they
should represent important signals impacting the
assessment of ﬁrm reputation by the business
community. These
characteristics have also

ﬁgured prominently in the popular business press
in the ongoing debate on what constitutes good
governance (e.g. Cadbury, 2002; Canavan, Jones
and Potter, 2004; Cascio, 2004). As such, they
form the basis of hypothesized relationships
identiﬁed in the following paragraphs.

Board composition

The role of corporate boards
management behaviour has been extensively inves-
tigated in extant corporate governance research
(Johnson, Daily and Ellstrand, 1996). Studies (e.g.
Dalton et al., 1998; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997)
indicate that boards
suﬃciently
independent are less willing to enquire, dissent and
resist the power of the CEO and top management.
Board composition, generally assessed as
the
proportion of outside directors on the board, is
widely used as measure of board eﬀectiveness. Daily
and Dalton (1994), for example, have argued that
organizations with outsider-dominated boards are
more likely to be aligned with the wealth max-
imization goals of shareholders. In other words, a
higher proportion of outsiders on the board signals
board independence and good governance. In
contrast, given that insiders are more likely to be
beholden to the CEO for their own jobs, insider-
dominated boards are often seen as being more
sympathetic to management preferences and there-
fore less eﬀective in protecting shareholder interests
from possible managerial opportunism. Since the
quality of a board’s oversight ability is not readily
visible to external constituents, greater representa-
tion of outside directors on the board can represent
an important, visible and well-understood signal of
eﬀective governance. That, in turn, should positively
inﬂuence perceptions related to ﬁrm reputation.

represent beneﬁcial

In addition to superior monitoring, outside
directors
to key
resource providers and an indication of a ﬁrm’s
ability to access scarce resources (Boeker and
Goodstein, 1991). As argued by Rindova (1999),
outside directors can contribute signiﬁcantly to
strategic decision making by bringing in valuable
insights from other industries on a broad range of
issues and helping managers broaden their con-
ceptual
frameworks (Carpenter and Westphal,
2001; Certo, 2003). Thus, while the business
community involved in making reputational assess-
ments may not be fully aware of the quality of top
management decision making, the perception that

top managers are assisted by, or can draw on the
expertise of, several outside directors should result
in a more favourable assessment of the ﬁrm.
Indeed, as O’Donoghue (2004) observes, board
composition represents an important signal to the
business community, especially under conditions of
uncertainty. Moreover, as the ﬁndings of Gabbio-
neta, Ravasi and Mazzola (2007) indicate, board
independence also signals the credibility of a ﬁrm’s
ﬁnancial reporting and thereby inﬂuences the
extent to which it is trusted, liked, admired and
respected by ﬁnancial analysts.

Further justiﬁcation on why greater outsider
representation should enhance corporate reputa-
tion comes from institutional theory. One of the
important tenets of institutional theory is that
organizations adopt certain procedures to gain
social legitimacy (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).
Organizations are constantly being advised to
include a greater proportion of non-executive
directors on their boards, thereby ensuring that
boards are truly independent of ﬁrm management
and therefore socially legitimate (Hymowitz,
2003). This trend has been salient since the
1990s (termed the ‘decade of board empower-
ment’) when stakeholder activism often involved
the promotion of board vigilance via the inclu-
sion of more outsiders in insider-dominated
boards. This sentiment has been echoed in the
popular business press with governance rating
agencies (e.g. Institutional Shareholder Services
and Governance Metrics International) including
metrics on the proportion of outside directors in
their assessments of board quality. As ﬁrms
appoint more outsiders on their board, they
come closer to the ideal standard of governance
which enhances their legitimacy and also their
reputation (King and Whetten, 2008). In other
words, even if a greater proportion of outsiders
on the board does not lead to objective improve-
ments in ﬁrm governance, the fact that it is
viewed as being institutionally desirable should
help enhance corporate reputation. Thus,

H1: The proportion of outsiders on the board
will be positively associated with corporate
reputation.

Board size

Along with board composition, board size has
ﬁgured prominently in corporate governance


502

research (Dalton et al., 1999). Members of
corporate boards have been viewed as important
links to critical resource providers, playing a
key role in reducing environmental uncertainty
through co-optation (Pfeﬀer and Salancik, 1978).
As one former CEO who had been a member on
several boards put it, ‘more CEOs are viewing
their boards as resources. They are not only
comfortable but anxious to bring questions to the
boards for which they don’t have the answers’
(Byrne and Melcher, 1996, p. 83). Not surpris-
ingly, board size is viewed as an important signal
of ﬁrm quality. Investors see them not only as
cues signalling better oversight of management
but also an indication of the access that top
management have to external knowledge and
networks (Rhee and Lee, 2008). In other words,
larger boards are viewed as being more desirable
because they provide ﬁrms with more ways of
connecting with external constituencies.

Extant research also equates larger boards with
superior organizational decisions. Directors re-
present critical channels of communication and
their exposure to multiple industries can help ﬁrms
address organizational challenges more eﬀectively
(Sullivan, 1990). In addition, the experiences of
directors in multiple settings should help eliminate
competitive ‘blind spots’ and,
in the process,
improve ﬁrm competitiveness. By bringing together
a broader set of experiences, larger boards are in a
position to generate meaningful dialogue and
debate. That, in turn, should result in superior
strategic decision making, especially in situations
where managers are required to consider, contest
and evaluate a broader set of alternatives (Forbes
and Milliken, 1999). From an institutional theory
standpoint, it can be argued that ﬁrms with larger
boards are likely to be viewed positively by the
business community because they meet the criteria
of institutional legitimacy imposed by the environ-
ment
(King and Whetten, 2008). Like board
composition, board size has been widely used as
a metric by governance rating agencies in evaluat-
ing corporate boards (Sonnenfeld, 2004), with
ﬁrms that have relatively smaller boards often be-
ing viewed unfavourably by such agencies. Business
Week, for example, has been critical of Sprint
because its board comprised just eight members
(Lavelle and Crockett, 2003). In other words, by
having more, rather than fewer, directors, ﬁrms
ensure that they are in compliance with institu-
tional expectations and are deemed closer to the

institutionally established standard of an ‘ideal’
board. That, in turn, should be reﬂected in superior
reputation rankings. Thus:

H2: Board size will be positively associated
with corporate reputation.

Outside director tenure

Another visible aspect of corporate boards is the
tenure of outside directors. As previously noted,
the business community often interprets the pre-
sence of outsiders on a board as a sign of board
vigilance. However, over the past decade, corpo-
rate governance watchdogs have voiced concerns
related to the tenure of such directors. Some have
argued that long tenured outside directors often
befriend rather than monitor management, mak-
ing boards relatively ineﬀective in protecting
shareholder interests (Canavan, Jones and Potter,
2004; Lipton and Lorsch, 1992). This has led to
calls for putting limits on the tenure of outside
directors. Indeed, most governance rating agen-
cies view director tenure as an important criterion
in their assessment of board eﬀectiveness, with
longer tenures typically being associated with
lower scores (Canavan, Jones and Potter, 2004).
In addition, with long board tenures being viewed
as detrimental from a governance perspective, it
can be argued from an institutional
theory
standpoint that longer tenures represent a diver-
gence from socially accepted norms resulting in
lower corporate reputation.

While excessively long tenures can result in
reduced monitoring eﬀectiveness,
it can also be
argued that boards composed of directors with very
limited experience are likely to be equally chal-
lenged in carrying out their monitoring roles. As
Kosnik (1990) observes, newly appointed directors
typically do not make the best monitors given their
reluctance to ‘rock the boat’ while seeking recogni-
tion and looking for a social ﬁt within the group.
Further support comes from the work of Mallette
and Fowler (1992), who found that new directors,
lacking familiarity with their new responsibilities
and their colleagues, are more susceptible to top
management pressures. With limited ﬁrm-speciﬁc
knowledge, they are often not in a position to
provide meaningful guidance to ﬁrm management
or play an important role in inﬂuencing key
strategic decisions (Bacon, Cornett and Davidson,

r 2009 British Academy of Management.


Corporate Reputation: Do Board Characteristics Matter?

503

1997). Taking into consideration both viewpoints,
we argue that the most ‘desirable’ boards are those
where outside directors have tenures that are
neither too long nor too short. Ideally, directors
should have served long enough to learn enough
about the ﬁrm to enable them to be eﬀective in
their monitoring and counselling roles but not so
long as to compromise their independence. In other
words, an ideal board is one where the tenure of
directors allows them to balance ﬁrm-speciﬁc
knowledge with the ability to be vigilant in their
monitoring role.

Based on the above arguments, we posit a
curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship between the
tenure of outside directors and corporate reputa-
tion, leading to the following hypothesis:

H3: There will be an inverted-U shaped relation-
ship between the average tenure of outside
directors and corporate reputation.

Leadership structure

In the corporate governance literature, the separa-
tion of the chairman and the CEO positions is an
often-used indicator of
the relative balance of
power in the upper echelons of an organization.
From a signalling theory perspective, this separa-
tion (or lack thereof) is likely to be an important
factor in the assessment of ﬁrms by external
observers. Agency theorists have long viewed
duality (situations where the ﬁrm CEO is also the
board chair) negatively, seeing it as a hindrance to
the ability of boards to perform their oversight and
governance functions (Mallette and Fowler, 1992).
Moreover, since duality implies that the individual
responsible for organizational performance (namely
the CEO) also heads the team that is charged with
evaluating his or her own performance, it is seen as
a sign of potentially undesirable CEO entrench-
ment. Indeed, Mazzola, Ravasi and Gabbioneta
(2006) found that ﬁnancial analysts and investors
view ﬁrms with a clear separation between internal
control and managerial responsibilities as more
reputable. In sum, it is reasonable to suggest that
duality generally represents a negative signal that
should result in diminished reputation.

Institutional theory arguments also suggest a
negative relationship between duality and corpo-
rate reputation. Duality is often equated with
weak governance and has been widely criticized

r 2009 British Academy of Management.

by institutional investors and corporate govern-
ance watchdogs (Boyd, 1995). In its 2003 report,
the Conference Board’s Commission on Public
Trust and Private Enterprise identiﬁed the ‘separa-
tion of the oﬃces of chairman and the CEO’ to be
central
from an
institutional theory standpoint, an independent
leadership structure is viewed as being normatively
desirable with complying ﬁrms being viewed
favourably by the business community. The out-
come should be enhanced ﬁrm reputation.

to good governance. Thus,

In sum, while the actual power distribution
within the board is usually unknown to external
observers, the separation of the CEO and board
chair positions signals that the ﬁrm may be less
vulnerable to agency problems. In addition, split-
ting the two positions is likely to enhance external
perception of a ﬁrm as being structurally legitimate
and worthy of support (Suchman, 1995). The
above arguments lead to our ﬁnal hypothesis:

H4: Independent leadership structure will be
positively associated with corporate reputation.

Methods

Sample

The study sample involved ﬁrms in the 2000
Fortune list of America’s Most Admired Cor-
porations for which data on board characteristics
and control variables were available. The Fortune
America’s Most Admired Corporations list has
been compiled annually since 1983 and is based
on a survey of senior executives, directors and
corporate analysts. Data availability on control
and independent variables resulted in a usable
sample of 324 ﬁrms covering both the manufac-
turing and the service sector.

Measures

Corporate reputation. As previously mentioned,
prior studies have extensively used Fortune’s
reputational rankings as both a predictor and
an outcome variable (e.g. Basdeo et al., 2006;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; McGuire, Sundgren
and Schneeweis, 1988; Roberts and Dowling,
2002; Staw and Epstein, 2000). Over 12,000
senior executives, directors and corporate ana-
lysts participated in the compilation of the Year
2000 rankings. Since respondents only rate ﬁrms


504

M. Musteen, D. K. Datta and B. Kemmerer

with which they are familiar, the quality of the
data is widely regarded as being high. As Brown
and Perry (1994, p. 1348) put it, ‘with a response
rate of about 50 percent, Fortune’s survey sample
is probably larger than most samples obtained by
academic researchers and its members are prob-
ably more qualiﬁed and better informed’. While
the Fortune measure of reputation is not without
its drawbacks, it exhibits a reasonable level of
discriminant and convergent validity and high
reliability (Szwajkowski and Figlewicz, 1999;
Wartick, 2002). Moreover, it is particularly well
suited for the questions addressed in our study,
given that respondents in the Fortune survey
(senior executives, directors and corporate ana-
lysts) are more likely to be familiar with the
board characteristics of the ﬁrms they assess.
Also, consistent with prior studies on corporate
reputation using Fortune measures (e.g. Basdeo et
al., 2006; Brown and Perry, 1994; Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; Roberts and Dowling, 2002), we
used the composite score (on a 0–10 scale based
on the average score along eight dimensions)
provided by Fortune as the measure of corporate
reputation.1

Board characteristics. Consistent with past re-
search on the antecedents of corporate reputation
(e.g. Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), independent
variables were lagged by a year. Also, as is
common in the literature (e.g. Datta, Musteen
and Herrmann, 2009; Kesner, Victor and Lamont,
1986; Kosnik, 1987), board composition was
computed as the proportion of outsiders (non-
management members) on the board. Board size
was measured as the total number of directors on
the board. Following Kosnik (1990) and Bacon,
Cornett and Davidson (1997), outsider director
tenure was deﬁned as the average number of years
that outside directors had served on the board.
Again, consistent with past research (e.g. Boyd,
1995; Rechner and Dalton, 1991), board leadership

1To assess the convergent validity of this measure of
reputation, we computed the correlation between the
Fortune’s reputational scores and reputation quotient
(RQ), an alternative measure developed by the Reputa-
tion Institute. RQ measures reputation by capturing
perceptions of a company held by consumers, investors,
employees and key inﬂuentials. For the 20 ﬁrms where
RQ scores were publicly available for the year 2000, the
correlation was 0.565 (po0.05), indicating a high level
of convergence between these two measures.

structure (i.e. the separation of the CEO and
chairman positions) was measured as a binary
variable which was coded 1 when the CEO was not
the board chair and 0 when both positions were
held by the same individual. Data on all the board
characteristics variables were obtained from cor-
porate proxy statements.

Control variables. Prior research on corporate
reputation indicates a strong positive relationship
between ﬁrm performance and corporate reputa-
tion (Deephouse and Carter, 2005; Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; McGuire, Schneeweis and Branch,
1990; McGuire, Sundgren and Schneeweis, 1988).
As such, we controlled for ﬁrm performance,
with performance being measured as average
the years 1997–1999.2
return on assets
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) found a strong
association between ﬁrm size and corporate
reputation. Size can indicate ﬁrm’s access to
resources and enhances visibility which could have
an impact on ﬁrm reputation. Thus, following
previous research (Datta and Rajagopalan, 1998;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), we controlled for
ﬁrm size with size measured as
the natural
logarithm of the number of employees in the ﬁrm.
In addition, we controlled for ﬁrm growth, which
can be viewed as a measure of the opportunities
available to the ﬁrm and the quality of
its
management. As is common, ﬁrm growth was
computed as the average percentage change in total
sales in the three year period 1997–1999. Our study
also controlled for ﬁrm risk. Firms associated with
greater risk can be perceived as having uncertain
future prospects and inﬂuence the business com-
munity’s perceptions about ﬁrms. Indeed, Fom-
brun and Shanley (1990)
found a negative
relationship between ﬁrm risk and corporate
reputation. Risk, in our study, was operationalized
as beta, a measure of systematic risk (Aaker and
Jacobson, 1987). Data on all the above variables
were obtained from the Compustat database.

In addition to ﬁrm proﬁtability, size and risk, we
also controlled for ﬁrm age. Younger ﬁrms are
subject to the ‘liability of newness’, having to learn
their roles as successful social actors (Singh, Tucker
and House, 1986). As such, ﬁrm age can be

equity as the measure of performance. The results were
similar to those obtained using return on assets.

expected to be positively associated with reputa-
tion. Following Ferguson, Deephouse and Fergu-
son (2000), we measured ﬁrm age by subtracting
the year of incorporation from 2000 (the year of
corporate reputation data). Data on the year of
incorporation were collected from S&P’s Corporate
Descriptions and Hoover’s Company and Industry
Reports. Finally, we controlled for potential
industry eﬀects using a dummy variable (Industry)
which assumes the value of 1 for ﬁrms in the
manufacturing industry and 0 for service ﬁrms.

Data analysis and results

Table 1 provides the means, standard deviations
and zero-order correlations among study vari-

ables. As Table 1 indicates, the mean reputation
score for ﬁrms in the study was 6.27 (on a 0–10
scale). The average board size was 11, the mean
proportion of outsiders on the board was 78%
and the average tenure of outside directors on the
board was 9.5 years. Twenty-six per cent of the
ﬁrms in the sample were characterized by an
independent leadership structure. This ﬁgure is
consistent with those reported in prior studies
(e.g. Finkelstein and D’Aveni, 1994).

Results of ordinary least squares regression
analyses used to test Hypotheses 1–4 are pre-
sented in Table 2. Model 1 shows the eﬀects of
control variables. Model 2 tests for the direct
eﬀects of board composition (the proportion of
outsiders on the board) on corporate reputation.

outsiders is positively associated with corporate
reputation (po0.05), providing support for Hypo-
thesis 1. Model 3 incorporates board size. As
predicted (Hypothesis 2), board size was positively
associated with ﬁrm reputation (po0.05). In addi-
tion, our results provide support for the hypothe-
sized relationship between outside director tenure
and ﬁrm reputation. The squared term of average
outsider tenure was signiﬁcant (po0.05) and the
signs associated with the regular and squared term
for outsider tenure suggest an inverted-U relation-
ship (Hypothesis 3). However, contrary to our
expectations (Hypothesis 4), independent leader-
ship structure was negatively associated with the
level of corporate reputation (po0.05). In other
words, our results indicate that duality (i.e. the lack
of an independent leadership structure) is positively
associated with corporate reputation. The full
model (Model 6) incorporates all the independent
variables simultaneously. The results are similar in
that all hypothesized relationships between board
attributes and corporate reputation are signiﬁcant
(at po0.05) and in the expected direction with the
exception of leadership structure. In sum, while our
analysis provides support for Hypotheses 1–3,
Hypothesis 4 was not supported.

Discussion

from the
Fombrun (1996) had argued that,
standpoint of organizations, reputation matters
because it creates value by attracting more and
better resources. While corporate reputation mea-
sures do not appear in company balance sheets,
ﬁrms often expend signiﬁcant resources towards
improving and maintaining their
reputations.
However, the study by Hutton et al. (2001) sug-
gests that, while reputation management is gaining
ground as a driving philosophy behind corporate
public relations, it is not always properly managed.
Our study ﬁndings indicate that, along with other
factors, ﬁrms need to pay close attention to the
characteristics of the board in their reputation
building process.

Our study drew on signalling and institutional
theories to predict how variations in board chara-
cteristics impact ﬁrm reputation. As expected, we
found a signiﬁcant relationship between board
composition and reputation with ﬁrms character-
ized by a higher proportion of outside directors
on their board enjoying greater
reputation.

Findings also indicate that board size has an
important inﬂuence on the perception of compa-
nies’ worth by the business community.
In
addition, we found a signiﬁcant
inverted-U
relationship between the average tenure of out-
side directors and reputation. In other words,
based on our ﬁndings, we can reasonably conclude
that board characteristics do play an important
role in the assessment of ﬁrm reputation. The
argument that the business community will view
ﬁrms with greater representation of outside direc-
tors more favourably is consistent with stakeholder
theory which posits
that understanding and
addressing the claims of stakeholders is central to
maintaining their support (Luoma and Goodstein,
1999). The ﬁnding related to board size also
underscores the importance of directors as im-
portant links to critical resource providers and a
source of assistance to top management engaged in
strategic decision making. Not surprisingly, a
larger board, which is in a position to oﬀer a
wider variety of experiences, is viewed positively by
members of the business community involved in
the assessment of ﬁrm reputation.

(1994),

The negative relationship between independent
leadership structure (i.e. the CEO and the chair
positions held by separate individuals) and corpo-
rate reputation, while unexpected, is not totally
surprising. Although the separation of the CEO
and chair positions has been advocated by govern-
ance scholars and the business community, several
studies (e.g. Boyd, 1995; Finkelstein and D’Aveni,
1994) have indicated that
the implications of
duality are not necessarily negative, as is often
assumed. Finkelstein and D’Aveni
for
example, have argued that duality can be viewed
as a positive in that it contributes to unity of
command and unambiguous leadership at the top
of the organization. Duality also avoids potential
problems arising out of possible rivalry between
the CEO and the board chair. As Sonnenfeld
(2004) points out, while splitting the CEO and
board chair roles has been advocated by govern-
ance rating services,
there is no compelling
anecdotal or research evidence that justiﬁes such
a split. The positive relationship between duality
and corporate reputation may also be a function of
the charisma and the celebrity status of ﬁrm CEOs.
Celebrity CEOs often occupy both the CEO and
the board chair positions in their organizations and
their celebrity or ‘star’ status is often reﬂected in
the form of enhanced ﬁrm reputation (Wade et al.,

r 2009 British Academy of Management.


Corporate Reputation: Do Board Characteristics Matter?

507

2008). According to Hayward, Rindova and
Pollock (2004) and Ketchen, Adams and Shook
(2008), key stakeholders
typically embrace a
charismatic CEO’s celebrity status and view it as
a valuable intangible asset that enhances ﬁrm
reputation. Such CEOs typically enjoy greater
discretion and are able to assert greater control
over their ﬁrms which often results in them also
occupying the board chairperson position. Given
our ﬁndings, the eﬀects of CEO duality along with
eﬀects of CEO celebrity status on ﬁrm reputation
deserve additional investigation.

While our study provides interesting insights
on the relationships between board attributes and
corporate reputation, ﬁndings should be inter-
preted with caution in light of the study limitations.
For example, our sample consisted of relatively
well-known, large ﬁrms featured in the Fortune’s
list of America’s Most Admired Corporations.
Consequently, the generalizability of our ﬁndings
may be somewhat limited and may not extend to
ﬁrms with very diﬀerent characteristics or in
diﬀerent contexts. For example, it is quite likely
that board attributes including board size and
composition,
tenure of outside directors and
leadership structure have a diﬀerent impact on
corporate reputation in the context of smaller ﬁrms
or ﬁrms in other countries with diﬀerent corporate
governance systems in place. Another limitation
relates to our measure of corporate reputation. As
Wartick (2002) and Szwajkowski and Figlewicz
(1999) point out, aggregating Fortune’s reputa-
tional rankings into a single composite measure of
reputation is problematic with past performance
unduly inﬂuencing reputation ratings. Moreover,
given that individuals responding to the Fortune
America’s Most Admired Corporations survey are
corporate executives, ﬁnancial analysts and direc-
tors, our ﬁndings may not hold in the context of
other audiences. Future research may also consider
investigating the eﬀect of other governance me-
chanisms (e.g. ownership structures, compensation
structures and the extent of compliance with SEC
requirements) on corporate reputation.

Conclusions

Through an examination of
the relationship
between board characteristics and corporate
reputation our study sought to make meaningful
contributions to both the governance and corpo-

rate reputation literatures. From a theoretical
perspective, this study ﬁlls an important void by
highlighting the importance of governance struc-
tures as inﬂuencing mechanisms in determining
the corporate reputation of ﬁrms in a broad range
of manufacturing and service industries. Our study
also adds to research on the role of corporate
boards as signalling mechanisms (e.g. Certo, 2003,
Certo, Daily and Dalton, 2001). While Certo and
his colleagues studied the relationship between
board attributes and initial public oﬀering under-
pricing, our study indicates that the composition
and characteristics of boards represent important
signals inﬂuencing the reputation of ﬁrms in the
broader business community. In addition, our
study provides support for the institutional view
of ﬁrm legitimacy and reputation. Consistent with
the arguments of King and Whetten (2008),
our ﬁndings indicate that as ﬁrms approach the
‘ideal’ standard of governance established by the
institutional ﬁeld they do gain both legitimacy and
reputational status.

From a managerial perspective, our study
points to the fact that board attributes play a
critical role in establishing and maintaining ﬁrm
reputation. While corporate governance research-
ers have been debating the impact of board
characteristics on ﬁrm performance, we provide
evidence that executives, analysts and directors
view board characteristics as important signals of
ﬁrm reputation. Our study demonstrates that
ﬁrms can enhance their reputation by paying
attention to the composition of their boards;
ensuring that their boards are not too small, are
composed of a greater proportion of outsiders
and that directors have tenures that are neither
too short nor too long. Moreover, our study
suggests that, contrary to popular belief, the
business community does not necessarily view
duality as a negative signal of ﬁrm quality.

In conclusion, we see our study as representing
an important step towards a better understanding
of factors that inﬂuence corporate reputation. With
research indicating that signiﬁcant rewards accrue
to ﬁrms that are able to develop and sustain better
reputations than their rivals (Frank and Cook,
1996),
‘reputation management’ has become an
important aspect of the operations of many ﬁrms
(Engardio and Arndt, 2007). While board char-
acteristics are widely viewed as being a visible reﬂe-
ction of company quality and standards, research
on how such mechanisms inﬂuence reputation had

been conspicuous by its absence. By ﬁlling that
void we hope this study informs and stimulates
further work in this regard.
