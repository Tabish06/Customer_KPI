Des  échantillons  de  chefs  d’entreprise  aux  USA  et  en  Iran  ont  été  comparés
quant aux pressions au travail (contrainte, orientation du rôle du responsable/
tâche, travail/maison et le support à ne pas travailler), cinq agents tenseurs (la
dissatisfaction  au  travail,  la  tension  mentale,  la  tension  physique,  l’intention
de  quitter  le  travail  et  l’absentéisme)  et  le  sentiment  de  contrôle  (LOC)  au
travail.  Comme  attendu,  les  chefs  d’entreprise  iraniens  étaient  davantage
externes et davantage sous pression sur les cinq types d’agents stressants. Les
américains  ont  montré  de  plus  fortes  corrélations  entre  les  agents  stressants.
Les relations entre pression et tension au travail étaient similaires dans chacun
des échantillons et dans les deux échantillons le LOC interne était associé à un
niveau  de  stress  plus  bas.  Bien  que  la  statut  marital  n’ait  pas  été  associé  au
stress au travail et aux agents stressant chez les américains, de fortes relations
existent chez les iraniens.

Samples  of  Iranian  and  US  managers  were  compared  on  four  sources  of
job  pressure  (constraints,  managerial  role/tasks,  home/work,  and  nonwork
support), ﬁve strains (job dissatisfaction, mental strain, physical strain, inten-
tion of quitting the job, and absence), and work locus of control. As expected
Iranian managers were more external and were higher on pressure and on all
ﬁve  job  strains.  Americans  showed  higher  intercorrelations  among  strains
except  for  absence,  whereas  Iranians  had  higher  correlations  among  sources
of  pressure.  Relations  between  pressure  and  job  strains  were  similar  across

both  samples,  and  in  both  samples  internal  locus  of  control  was  associated
with lower strain. Although marital status was not associated with job stres-
sors and strains among Americans, it showed strong relations among Iranians.

INTRODUCTION

Stress in general and workplace stress in particular has been recognised as
a major health problem in Western society, with estimated costs to society
of  hundreds  of  $billions  per  year  (Cartwright  &  Cooper,  1997).  Many
reviews  can  be  found  relating  a  variety  of  stressful  job  conditions  or  job
stressors  to  a  variety  of  employee  health-related  outcomes  or  job  strains,
both physical and psychological (e.g. Beehr, 1995; Jackson & Schuler, 1985;
Jex, 1998; Jex & Beehr, 1991). However, almost all of this research has been
conducted  in  the  Western,  English-speaking  world,  predominantly  the  US
and UK, and to a lesser extent Australia and Canada. Relatively few studies
have  investigated  job  stress  in  other  cultures.  Most  cross-national  studies
available have been done in Confucian Asian countries, such as China and
Japan (e.g. Lu, Tseng, & Cooper, 1999; Shanfa, Sparks, & Cooper, 1998; Sin
& Cheng, 1995; Siu & Cooper, 1998). Almost totally neglected are Moslem
countries in the Middle East.

Our  purpose  was  to  contrast  the  experience  of  job  stress  of  a  typical
American sample with their counterparts in the Middle Eastern country of
the Islamic Republic of Iran (IR Iran). Compared to the US, IR Iran is char-
acterised  as  being  collectivistic  and  high  in  power  distance  (Bierbrauer,
Meyer, & Wolfradt, 1994; Ronen & Shenkar, 1985). Iranians can be quite
external  in  their  locus  of  control,  attributing  control  of  events  to  forces
outside  of  themselves  (Boyacigiller  &  Adler,  1991;  House,  Hanges,  Ruiz-
Quintanilla, Dorfman, Javidan, Dickson, & Gupta, 1999). Control itself has
been linked to perceptions of both job stressors and job strains (Ganster
&  Fusilier,  1989).  Spector,  Cooper  et  al.  (2001)  in  their  comparison  of  24
countries found that at the country mean level, collectivism was associated
with externality in locus of control. Furthermore, countries in which people
were external tended to score high in job strains. Combining these ﬁndings
with  the  general  control  literature,  we  would  expect  that  Iranians  would
perceive less control, leading to the ﬁrst hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Iranians will be more external in their work locus of control
than  Americans.  Because  Iranians  are  more  external  than  Americans,  we
would expect their perceptions of the workplace and their strains to differ,
leading to the second hypothesis:

Hypothesis  2:  Iranians  will  perceive  more  stressors  and  experience  more

job strain than Americans.

In the US it has been well established that perception of job stressors
is  associated  with  reports  of  both  attitudinal  variables  (job  dissatisfaction

and  intention  of  quitting  the  job)  and  health  strains  (physical  symptoms
and psychological discomfort such as work anxiety) (e.g. see Cartwright &
Cooper,  1997;  Jex  &  Beehr,  1991).  Western  models  of  job  stress  suggest  a
causal process whereby exposure to job stressors induces strains (Jex, 1998).
The  extent  to  which  these  Western  models  ﬁt  other  cultures  is  open  to
question.  In  addition  to  the  testing  of  the  two  hypotheses,  we  compared
correlations  between  job  stressors  and  strains  to  see  if  they  were  similar
across our two samples. Our study provides a comparison of a US sample of
managers with their counterparts in the Middle Eastern country of IR Iran.

METHOD

Participants
Participants in this study were 207 Iranian and 120 US managers. It was decided
to study managers because we felt it was important to keep the nature of the
jobs as equivalent as possible, and the manager job seemed to be universal
across countries in which people work for organisations. Furthermore, it is
expected that managers experience a reasonable level of job stress, as their
job involves both contact with others and responsibility. The IR Iran sample
was 67 per cent male, had a mean age of 39.6 (SD = 6.1), 74 per cent were
married, and 72 per cent had at least a BA degree. The US sample was 55
per cent male, had a mean age of 43.9 (SD = 10.9), 72 per cent were married,
and  42  per  cent  had  BA  degrees  or  beyond.  Thus  the  Iranian  sample  was
more male, slightly younger, and more educated than the US.

Measures
In  both  nations  the  same  questionnaire  was  used,  including  the  Occupa-
tional  Stress  Indicator-2  (OSI2),  a  90-item  scale  that  assesses  job  strains,
sources of stress, personality, and coping (Cooper & Williams, 1996), the Work
Locus  of  Control  Scale,  WLCS  (Spector,  1988),  and  additional  questions,
including demographics.

The WLCS has 16 items intended to assess employee beliefs about control
at  work  in  general,  as  opposed  to  their  particular  job.  Half  the  items  are
written  in  each  direction,  external  vs  internal.  Six  response  choices  range
from strongly disagree to strongly agree. High scores represent externality and
low scores internality. Spector (1988) reports internal consistency (coefﬁcient
alpha) of 0.75 to 0.85 across six US samples, with all but one in the 0.80s.
The OSI2 is a 90-item short form of the OSI (Cooper, Sloan, & Williams,
1988). Each subscale contains a subset of the items from the correspond-
ing  full  OSI.  Most  available  reliability  and  validity  data  concern  the
longer version (e.g. Robertson, Cooper, & Williams, 1990). Subscales of job

satisfaction,  physical  strain,  and  psychological  strain  were  of  interest  here
as strains. Job satisfaction was assessed with 12 items concerning the organ-
isation and the work itself. Respondents were asked to indicate their satis-
faction  with  each  item,  with  six  response  choices  ranging  from  very  much
dissatisfaction  to  very  much  satisfaction.  Psychological  strain  was  assessed
with 12 items asking about psychological reactions at work. All items had
six response choices, but the choices varied across items. For example, item
4 “Are there times at work when you feel so exasperated that you sit back
and  think  to  yourself  that  ‘life  is  all  really  just  too  much  effort?’ ”  had
choices  ranging  from  Never  to  Often.  Physical  strain  was  assessed  with  6
items concerning physical or somatic symptoms, such as shortness of breath
or muscle trembling. There were six response choices ranging from Never to
Very frequently. For all three scales, high scores represented high levels of
well-being, that is, high satisfaction, low psychological strain, or low phys-
ical strain. Robertson et al. (1990) reported coefﬁcient alpha reliabilities for
the original OSI of 0.85, 0.88, and 0.78, respectively.

Forty  items  assessed  perceived  sources  of  job  pressure  ( job  stressors).
The  original  OSI  collapsed  the  pressure  items  into  8  subscales.  However,
Sparks, Cooper, Spector et al. (1999) found that with the short form, several
of these subscales had poor reliabilities. Based on a factor analysis they devised
four  new  scales  of  constraints  on  the  job  (pressure  from  things  that  make
doing a job difﬁcult), managerial role and tasks (e.g. taking risks or having
to do something distasteful), work/home conﬂict (e.g. having to take work
home), and nonwork support (e.g. spouse’s attitude toward the participant’s
career). Sparks et al. (1999) reported internal consistency reliabilities for the
four scales across 22 nations as 0.80 to 0.92, 0.71 to 0.88, 0.68 to 0.85, and
0.70 to 0.83, for constraints, managerial role, home/work, and nonwork sup-
port, respectively. The lower reliabilities were for non-English language samples.
Additional  questions  asked  demographics  (age,  education,  gender,  and
marital  status),  absence  (days  in  the  past  three  months),  and  intention  of
quitting the job (high scores represented strong intentions).

Measurement Equivalence
For  the  eight  multi-item  scales  ( job  satisfaction,  mental  strain,  physical
strain, sources of pressure, and work locus of control) we compared within-
scale  factor  structures.  Variance/covariance  matrices  among  items  from
each  scale  for  each  country  were  computed.  Corresponding  matrices  were
compared  for  equivalence  using  LISREL  8  (Jöreskog  &  Sörbom,  1992).
Across the eight comparisons, ﬁt was only fair. For example, the Goodness
of  Fit  Index  ranged  from  0.72  to  0.88,  with  a  median  of  0.82.  The  Incre-
mental  Fit  Index  was  better,  ranging  from  0.79  to  0.92,  with  a  median  of
0.86. One should take these results with caution, however, considering the

rather small sample sizes for this sort of analysis. In a similar comparison
of 8 diverse countries with New Zealand, using larger samples and 4 of the
same measures, Spector, Cooper et al. (in press) found much better ﬁt, even
between countries/languages as different from English as Chinese, Japanese,
Polish, and Slovenian.

Procedure
The original questionnaire was written in English. The OSI was developed
in  England  and  the  WLCS  in  the  US.  It  was  translated  into  Farsi  for  the
Iranian  sample.  The  back  translation  technique  was  used  of  going  from
English to Farsi and then independently back to English to assure equival-
ence. Data collection procedures were designed to assure a wide variety of
managers, with questionnaires distributed both by mail and in person, and
with the US sample, employed university students were asked to have their
managers complete the questionnaire and return them to the researchers by
mail. All surveys were completed anonymously. With the US sample, ques-
tionnaires were returned via mail using postage paid return envelopes.

RESULTS

Descriptive statistics for the 10 variables in the study (four sources of pres-
sure, ﬁve strains, and work locus of control) are in Table 1. Included for each
sample were means, standard deviations, ranges, and coefﬁcient alphas as an
indicator of internal consistency. In addition, one-way ANOVAs were con-
ducted  using  PROC  GLM  in  SAS,  as  tests  of  the  two  hypotheses.  Shown

are both F tests to compare corresponding means for both samples, as well
as an R 2 as an indicator of magnitude of effect.

Hypothesis  1  was  supported  in  that  Iranians  would  be  more  external  in
their work locus of control than Americans. As can be seen in the table, the
Iranian  mean  was  over  10  points  higher  in  the  external  direction  than  the
US, accounting for 19 per cent of the variance. Support was also found with
all  but  one  variable  (job  satisfaction)  for  Hypothesis  2.  Iranians  were  sig-
niﬁcantly higher on job stressors (sources of pressure) and on strains, as indi-
cated by lower mental strain and physical strain scores, and higher absence,
and intention of quitting the job.

Correlations among all 10 variables for each sample are in Table 2. The
Iranian sample is below the main diagonal, and the US sample is above the
main diagonal. Comparisons of corresponding correlations were conducted
with a z-test for independent correlations. The table is organised so the ﬁrst
ﬁve variables are strains, the next four are sources of pressure, and the last
is work locus of control.

Most of the correlations were statistically signiﬁcant, with the US having
somewhat  more  signiﬁcance  than  the  Iranian  sample,  despite  the  smaller
sample  size.  In  general,  the  job  strains  tended  to  intercorrelate,  as  did  the
sources of pressure. About half of the correlations between pressure sources
and strains were signiﬁcant (10/20 for IR Iran and 11/20 for the US). Locus
of control tended to correlate more with strains than sources of pressure for
both samples.

Of the 45 correlations, 18 showed signiﬁcant differences between samples.
Correlations among the job strains tended to be higher in the US sample for
all  but  absence,  which  was  higher  for  Iranians.  For  example,  mental  and
physical strain correlated 0.60 in the US, but only a nonsigniﬁcant 0.11 for
IR Iran. Conversely, absence correlated −0.51 with physical strain in the IR
Iran sample, but was a nonsigniﬁcant −0.14 in the US sample.

Correlations among the sources of pressure were considerably higher for
the  IR  Iran  sample,  ranging  from  0.53  to  0.76  raising  concerns  of  poor
discriminant validity. In the US the range was from 0.41 to 0.49, and in all
but one case the Iranian correlations were signiﬁcantly higher.

Relations  of  pressure  to  strains  showed  only  three  differences  out  of  20
between the two samples, with the Iranian sample higher in one case. With
absence overall, the Iranian sample tended to have higher correlations than
the US, with four of nine signiﬁcantly so. The US sample had two of nine
absence correlations signiﬁcant with the largest −0.22. The Iranian sample
had seven of nine signiﬁcant, with the largest −0.52.

Finally,  locus  of  control  showed  no  consistent  differences  between  the
two nations. In the four of nine cases where correlations were signiﬁcantly
different, IR Iran was higher on two, absence and home support, and lower
on two, mental strain and constraints.

Correlations were also computed between each of four demographic vari-
ables  (gender,  age,  college  degree,  and  marital  status)  for  both  countries.
Table 3 shows that for the US there was almost no relation of demographics
with  the  four  stressors  and  six  strains  in  the  study.  There  were  two  of  40
exceptions,  which  could  be  attributable  to  Type  1  error.  For  the  Iranian
sample,  gender  was  signiﬁcantly  related  to  ﬁve  and  marital  status  to  eight
of 10 variables. Female Iranians reported more physical strain and absence,
and less mental strain than males. Females had higher scores on home/work
and  nonwork  support  stressors.  Married  Iranians  reported  less  physical
strain,  intention  of  quitting,  and  absence,  as  well  as  lower  stressors  across
all four scales.

DISCUSSION

The questions addressed in this paper concerned whether Iranian managers
would differ from their US counterparts in levels of perceived job stressors
and strain, as well as work locus of control. Furthermore, would relations
among these variables differ. Literature discussed in our introduction sug-
gested that Iranians tend to be collectivistic, which would be expected to be
associated with externality in locus of control. This externality was expected
to  be  associated  with  higher  perceived  stressors  and  higher  job  strains.
We  found  support  for  both  of  these  hypotheses.  Iranians  tended  to  be
more  external  than  Americans  (Hypothesis  1),  and  they  scored  higher  in
job  stressors  (sources  of  pressure)  and  showed  more  strain  (except  for  job
satisfaction).

A  second  purpose  was  to  compare  correlations  among  job  stressors
and strains to see if Western ﬁndings from the US would generalise to the
Middle East. To some extent we found generalisability, but 40 per cent of
corresponding correlations were signiﬁcantly different between the samples.
With the exception of absence, the US sample demonstrated stronger rela-
tions among strains. In particular, job satisfaction vs quitting intention, and
mental vs physical strain are highly correlated for Americans. For Iranians,
these strains are more independent, as the relation between the physical and
psychological strains was a nonsigniﬁcant 0.11. However, absence showed a
different pattern. It was related to physical strain and quitting intention for
Iranians, but not for Americans. Conversely, absence related to job satisfac-
tion and mental strain for Americans, but not for Iranians, although these
corresponding correlations did not differ signiﬁcantly.

The  Iranians  showed  poor  discriminant  validities  among  the  pressure
scales,  compared  to  the  Americans.  In  addition  there  were  a  great  deal  of
missing  data  for  the  IR  Iran  sample  on  these  scales,  e.g.  about  a  third  of
respondents failed to complete the constraints and managerial role items. A
larger  number  completed  the  other  two  pressure  scales.  Reliabilities  for
three of the four scales (all but constraints) were also considerably lower for
the Iranian sample. Clearly, additional investigation is needed to determine
the  reason  for  these  differences.  It  is  possible  that  these  items  tend  to  be
more threatening to Iranians, and they either adopt a halo or fail to com-
plete them at all. Alternatively, the nature of job stressors might be different
in  IR  Iran,  underscoring  the  need  to  develop  new  scales  in  other  cultures,
rather than exporting our American and British scales.

Relations  between  sources  of  pressure  and  strains  tended  to  be  similar
across  the  two  nations.  In  half  the  cases,  individuals  who  perceived  more
pressure  tended  to  experience  more  strains.  Of  course,  with  the  cross-
sectional nature of our design, it is not possible to draw conclusions about
underlying causal processes. However, our results are suggestive that the job
stressor–strain  connection  might  generalise,  although  the  precise  nature  of
the stressors and strains might tend to differ.

Work  locus  of  control  tended  to  relate  well  to  job  strains.  Internals  in
both  countries  tended  to  report  less  strain,  more  job  satisfaction,  and  less
intent  to  quit.  Only  for  the  Iranians,  however,  did  externals  report  more
absence. For both nations there again is consistency in that belief in control
was associated with better well-being.

This  study  illustrates  that  there  are  both  similarities  and  differences  in
results when managerial job stress was compared between IR Iran and the
US.  Americans  reported  themselves  to  be  higher  in  well-being  and  lower
in  sources  of  pressure.  This  may  reﬂect  better  health  in  the  US,  perhaps
due  to  a  combination  of  economic  and  social  factors.  It  also  might  reﬂect
that  perceptions  differ  due  to  differences  in  beliefs  about  collectivism  and

control, i.e. Iranians who perceive lower control perceive more stressors and
experience more strain. Of course, there is a methodological possibility that
cultural interpretation of items, and possible tendencies to distort or embel-
lish might have produced these results. Triandis (1995) noted that people in
Middle Eastern countries have a tendency to embellish responses and make
extreme responses. However, an inspection of the scale means for both coun-
tries in relation to the possible range of scores did not show that Iranians
were more extreme. For example, with work locus of control, the possible
range was from 16 to 96, with the middle of the scale at 56. The US sample
was further from the middle at 37.7 than the Iranian at 48.

One  further  caution  should  be  noted  with  these  data  because  they  were
all from a cross-sectional self-report questionnaire design. Certainly we can-
not  draw  causal  conclusions  from  observed  relations  in  this  study,  so  one
cannot  conclude  that  job  stressors  lead  to  strains  in  both  countries.  How-
ever, since the major variable of country was not assessed via questionnaire,
we  can  draw  inferences  that  there  were  country  differences,  although  as
noted,  the  underlying  mechanisms  are  not  clear.  Another  concern  is  with
mono-method bias, but an inspection of the correlations in Table 2 shows
that  a  third  of  the  correlations  from  both  samples  were  nonsigniﬁcant,
suggesting  that  there  was  not  an  underlying  bias  inﬂating  all  correlations
for either Americans or Iranians, although it is certainly possible that there
were some variable-speciﬁc biases across certain combinations of variables,
such as social desirability.

Overall,  our  results  suggest  that  the  underlying  processes  of  job  stress
might be similar across both English-speaking Western culture and at least
one Middle Eastern culture. Although intercorrelations among job stressors
and  among  job  strains  differed,  both  samples  showed  similar  job  stressor
(pressure) to strain relations, and work locus of control to strain relations.
However,  it  seems  likely  that  the  precise  nature  of  the  job  stressors  and
strain reactions are culture speciﬁc, at least to some extent. Certainly more
studies  are  needed  comparing  a  variety  of  nations  with  the  US  and  other
English-speaking, Western countries to provide a more complete picture of
how culture affects the job stress process.
