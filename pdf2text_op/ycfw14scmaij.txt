Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to extend previous green supply chain management (GSCM) research by developing and empirically testing
a conceptual framework that investigates the relationships between three dimensions of integrated green supply chain management (iGSCM) and
multiple dimensions of operational performance.
Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on survey data collected from 126 automotive manufacturers in China. The relationships
between theoretical constructs are analysed using structural equation modelling.
Findings – This study generates important ﬁndings of the signiﬁcant and positive relationships between iGSCM (internal GSCM, GSCM with
customers and GSCM with suppliers) and operational performance in terms of ﬂexibility, delivery, quality and cost.
Practical implications – It is important for managers to simultaneously consider internal GSCM and GSCM with customers and suppliers when
implementing environmental sustainability in the supply chains. Overlooking either internal GSCM or external GSCM may hinder their efforts to
improve operational performance.
Originality/value – This study contributes to the literature by deﬁning iGSCM that combines three main dimensions, namely, internal GSCM, GSCM
with customers and GSCM with suppliers, and empirically testing its impact on multiple operational performance dimensions.

1. Introduction
In recent years, green supply chain management (GSCM) has
been evolved as the intra and inter-ﬁrm management of the
upstream and downstream supply chain, which has the
capability to minimise the overall environmental impact of
both the forward and reverse ﬂows (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;
Klassen and Johnson, 2004; Zhu et al., 2008a; Green et al.,
2012). It has been argued that to contribute to the efﬁcient
integration of the entire supply chain process, supply chain
management (SCM) activities cannot be applied independently
but rather simultaneously (Kim, 2006). Accordingly, suppliers,
manufacturers, customers and disposal companies must be

integrated in implementing GSCM practices (Thun and Müller,
2010). Despite this argument, previous research exploring
environmental
initiatives have focused predominantly on
selected functional areas (Sarkis, 1999; Rao and Holt, 2005).
Furthermore,
incomplete and evolving conceptualizations
have generated inconclusive results about the relationship
between GSCM and ﬁrm performance (Rao and Holt, 2005;
Vachon and Klassen, 2006; Green et al., 2012; Zhu et al.,
2007; Lai and Wong, 2012; Zailani et al., 2012). To explore
the
impact on
performance, there is a need to investigate how individual
dimensions of GSCM are related to selected dimensions of
operational performance (Vachon and Klassen, 2008).
