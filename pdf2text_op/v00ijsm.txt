Negative Emotion in the Workplace:
Employee Jealousy and Envy

Robert P. Vecchio1,2

Nine hypotheses were developed from the emerging literature on negative emo-
tion in the workplace. In order to test these hypotheses, the responses of 167
employed master’s students to measures of individual differences (self-esteem
and Machiavellianism), work unit attributes (autonomy, competitive reward,
and supervisory considerateness) and personal response variables (sense of
control, organization-based self-esteem, and propensity to quit) were analyzed
with bivariate and hierarchical regression analyses. Results of these analyses
were generally supportive of the predicted relationships. Findings are inter-
preted as indicating the utility of the constructs of employee jealousy and envy
for understanding individual experiences of interpersonal stress.

KEY WORDS: worksite stress; stress management; jealousy; envy.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, social scientists have begun to examine the constructs of
interpersonal jealousy and envy. Typically, the focus of this research has been
on romantically based jealousy and envy (Harris & Christenfeld, 1996). Also,
there is a growing interest in how these negative emotions may underlie domes-
tic violence (Salovey, 1991; White & Mullen, 1989; Delgado & Bond, 1993).
The notions of jealousy and envy, however, have unique relevance for the work-
place. For example, it is commonly observed that violence and aggression in
the workplace, which may be increasing in recent years (Baron & Neuman,
1996; Elliott & Jarrett, 1994; Lusk, 1992; Neuman & Baron, 1998; Regdon,

1994; Stuart, 1992), are sometimes a consequence of such negative emotions as
coworker jealousy and envy (CDC, 1993; National Victim Center, 1994;
O’Boyle, 1992). Practitioners who work in the area of stress management are
particularly interested in understanding the nature and dynamics of workplace
stress in order to create programs for effectively managing dysfunctional re-
sponses (Cooper & Cartwright, 1997; Crandall & Perrewe´, 1995; Lindquist &
Cooper, 1999; Ivancevich, Matteson, Freedman, & Phillips, 1990). In one re-
view, Vecchio (1995) cited prior evidence that a majority of employees report
experiencing jealousy and/or envy at work, and that most employees believe
that superiors are not effectively managing these situations. This reported inef-
fectiveness may partially stem from the embarrassment that is associated with
dealing with these specific, often denigrated, emotions (i.e., their existence is
commonly thought to reflect individual immaturity and a lack of self-confi-
dence).

Defining Employee Jealousy and Envy

Following on earlier theoretical work by White and Mullen (1989) and
Vecchio (1995), we can define employee jealousy as a pattern of thoughts, emo-
tions, and behaviors that results from an employee’s loss of self-esteem and/or
the loss of outcomes associated with a working relationship. The loss, or merely
the perceived threat of loss, involves the perception of a rival’s intrusion. This
rival has the potential to reduce one’s self-esteem or undermine a valued rela-
tionship. In essence, workplace jealousy is triadic in that it involves three princi-
pals: the focal employee, the rival, and the valued target person. A key, critical
feature of employee jealousy is the threat aspect—real or imagined. This threat
aspect identifies workplace jealousy as a type of stress reaction (i.e., a strong
emotional response, inducing a desire to react defensively or to withdraw).

In contrast, employee envy, although also a stress response, is defined in
essentially dyadic terms (Parrott & Smith, 1993). Envy can be defined formally
as a pattern of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that results from an employ-
ee’s loss of self-esteem in response to a referent other’s obtainment of outcomes
that one strongly desires. In comparison to jealousy, envy does not involve
competition with a rival for control of a relationship. Also, jealousy involves a
win/lose contest with a rival, while envy does not require that another individu-
al’s gain be at one’s own expense. Additionally, feelings of anger that character-
ize employee jealousy may be more socially accepted than feelings of hostility
that arise from employee envy (i.e., coworkers are perhaps more likely to be
understanding of resentment due to a rival’s intrusion than due to comparative
loss that reflects differences in reward allocation). A common feature of both
employee jealousy and envy, however, is the diminution of self-worth that oc-

curs as a result of social comparison (Mumford, 1983; Ambrose, Harland, &
Kulik, 1991). Also, both emotions can produce feelings of inferiority (negative
self-appraisal) as both emotions imply the loss of social standing (Parrott, 1991).
Although there is an understandable tendency to view employee jealousy
and envy as dysfunctional, it is important to note that they can be quite func-
tional; these emotions can energize behavior and focus attention on protecting
valued relationships and resources. Of course, in the extreme, both emotions
have the potential to activate pathological responses as well.

Linking Negative Emotions in the Workplace

with Stress

It is critical to note that both jealousy and envy are, at core, emotional
states that are aroused by an employee’s self-perceived inability to control
events. In essence, they are reactions to social threats. The inability of a person
to deal with or manage a social threat creates feelings of powerlessness or help-
lessness (i.e., the consequences of stress). Further, the perception of a social
threat can be either real or imagined. That is, it is the mere perception of a
threat, or even a mere preliminary suspicion that a threat may exist, is sufficient
to evoke a stress reaction. As noted by Selye (1976) and Matteson and Ivancev-
ich (1987), stress is best viewed as a type of physiological and emotional arousal
in response to a situation that constitutes a perceived threat to one’s well-being.
Work situations represent a significant arena for most of an adult’s activities.
Within these settings, competition for status and resources is an ongoing dy-
namic. It should prove fruitful, therefore, to study the occurrence of employee
negative emotions in response to social threats at work.

Understanding Employee Jealousy and Envy

In order to establish the validity of the constructs of employee jealousy and
envy, the present study was designed and conducted with attention to the guid-
ance provided by previous findings reported in the areas of stress and negative
emotion (Edwards, 1992; Kahn & Byosiere, 1992; Lazarus, 1994; Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984; Vecchio, 1995; White & Mullen, 1989). Particular attention
was given to a model proposed by Vecchio (1995, p. 228), wherein jealousy
and envy can be understood as being associated with two major sets of vari-
ables: individual differences attributes and contextual attributes. The negative
emotions of jealousy and envy may also be understood as influences on a set of
personal response variables. Relying on Vecchio’s model for categorizing vari-
ables within the broader sets of individual differences, work unit, and personal


164

Vecchio

responses, specific independent variables were selected for study. Within the
category of employee individual differences variables, two variables can be
identified as likely antecedents of jealousy and envy: self-esteem and Machia-
vellianism. Also, Vecchio’s model indicates that three work unit attributes of
suspected relevance are: competitiveness of rewards, worker autonomy, and su-
pervisor considerateness. Finally, a set of three likely personal response vari-
ables was identified from the model: organization-based self-esteem, sense of
control, and propensity to quit.

Negative Emotion and Employee Individual Differences Attributes

Threat is experienced as a type of stress (Locke & Taylor, 1990). Logically,
employees who are low in self-esteem should be more susceptible to threats as
they feel more vulnerable to assaults on their sense of self-worth. High self-
esteem individuals should be more resistant to perceived social threats as gen-
eral self-esteem reflects an individual’s feeling of being able to influence events
(Locke, McClear, & Knight, 1996). Increases in self-esteem should, therefore,
be correlated inversely with reports of jealousy and envy. However, there is also
evidence that people who are high in self-esteem may be more sensitive to
threats to esteem (Tetlock & Manstead, 1985). Hence, the prior evidence and
theoretical rationale for this hypothesis are not totally without question. Yet, the
vast majority of findings in the area of self-esteem and suspectibility to threat
suggests that high self-esteem is associated with an ability to resist potentially
negative or threatening events (Locke et al., 1996).

H1: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be negatively correlated

with employee self-esteem.

Highly competitive individuals who are attuned to issues of social control
would experience stronger negative emotions, particularly concerning envy,
when they identify threats to competitive standing. Of course, it can be alterna-
tively argued that highly Machiavellian individuals are inclined to hide their
resentful feelings, thereby making it difficult to identify any association. With
no particular reason or incentive to hide their feelings, however, a positive corre-
lation should be observed between individual Machiavellianism and feelings of
jealousy and envy, such that more politically sensitive individuals will report
greater sensitivity to social threats.

H2: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be positively correlated

with individual Machiavellianism.

Negative Emotion and Work Unit Attributes

Reward systems that emphasize win/lose, zero-sum outcomes should pro-
mote higher levels of negative emotion as a consequence of competitiveness.
Competition, therefore, should enhance the perception of threat and the magni-
tude of felt stress. Because competition among coworkers for rewards can gener-
ate strong, and sometimes dysfunctional, emotion, we can reasonably expect
that descriptions of a competitive work setting will be associated with greater
negative emotions.

H3: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be positively correlated

with the existence of competitive reward systems.

Employees who operate independently of coworkers and who are less de-
pendent on others to perform their tasks have less involvement in competitive
circumstances. A reduction in exposure to social competition should lead to a
reduction in the experience of negative socially based emotion. Therefore, em-
ployees who operate autonomously in the conduct of their jobs should report
less jealousy and envy. That is to say, the absence of dependence should make
the notions of jealousy and envy less relevant for an individual.

H4: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be negatively correlated

with worker autonomy.

Based on research related to family dynamics that suggests that warm,
nurturing mothers have higher levels of sibling rivalry (Stearns, 1989), Vecchio
(1995) initially argued that highly considerate supervisors will have subordi-
nates who report higher levels of jealousy and envy. His preliminary evidence,
however, revealed significant inverse correlations between supervisor consider-
ateness and negative emotion, thereby suggesting that considerateness is of im-
portance, but that it may operate so as to reduce negative emotion—rather than
to increase it—in work settings. Leader considerateness, as assessed within the
Ohio State University framework, may tap sensitivity to fairness and equal treat-
ment. Therefore, highly considerate supervisors should arouse less jealousy and
envy from subordinates.

H5: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be inversely correlated

with supervisor considerateness.

Negative Emotion and Personal Response Variables

Job-related sense of self-worth (Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, & Dunham,
1989), as distinct from general self-esteem, should be associated with lower
negative emotion in the workplace. General self-esteem refers to an individual’s


166

Vecchio

chronic trans-situational sense of self-worth, whereas organization-based self-
esteem refers to a setting-specific sense of being valued. Although general self-
esteem should be correlated with organization-based self-esteem, experiences at
work that convey information on social standing should modify organization-
based self-esteem. Reductions in job-related self-esteem (e.g., reductions in feel-
ings of being valued at work) should result from jealousy and envy. This pre-
dicted association of jealousy and envy with organization-based self-esteem
should be manifested beyond the influence of general self-esteem (i.e., after
controlling for general self-esteem).

H6: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be negatively correlated

with organization-based self-esteem.

Along with reductions in job-related self-esteem, employee sense of control
should be reduced as well by the experience of negative emotion. At base,
feelings of jealousy and envy at work convey information that one is not able
to control environmental forces that pose threats to one’s social standing. There-
fore, feelings of work-related efficacy should be diminished as a result of experi-
encing jealousy or envy.

H7: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be positively correlated

with employee sense of lack of control.

As sources of workplace stress, jealousy and envy should prompt an open-
ness to considering alternative employment. Preliminary evidence indicates that
employee propensity to quit increases with levels of reported jealousy and envy
(Vecchio, 1995; 1999). This is not unreasonable as a search for alternative em-
ployment represents a form of coping response. While many factors contribute
to the initiation of a job search, jealousy and envy may provide unique powerful
sources of influence on an employee’s openness to quitting.

H8: Feelings of employee jealousy and envy will be positively correlated

with propensity to quit.

The unique association of each set of variables (individual, work unit, and
personal outcome) with each of the negative emotions of jealousy and envy can
be assessed by entering each set of variables into a regression equation follow-
ing the initial inclusion of alternative sets of variables. The unique contribution
of each set of variables in predicting each negative emotion can then be tested.
Evidence of a significant increment in predictable criterion variance would sub-
stantiate the present suggestion that these sets of variables are important, unique
sources of explanatory variance. Evidence of unique incremental
influence
would suggest also that the constructs of employee jealousy and envy possess
predictive utility within the domain of stress-related concepts.

H9: The sets of variables will be related to employee jealousy and envy

after alternative sources of influence are controlled.

Finally, it should be noted that the present predictions for both jealousy
and envy are essentially the same. This is because both constructs are based on
the dynamics of responding to threats related to social standing. At this stage,
the independent existence of each construct remains to be demonstrated, plus
the relative strength of the relationships predicted for each construct is unknown.

METHOD

One hundred and sixty-nine master’s level students at a Midwestern univer-
sity, all of whom were employed in a variety of full-time jobs, were contacted
via a mailed survey. Following this initial contact, each targeted person received
a follow-up postcard reminder, and a second mailing of the survey. Certified
mail was used to reach individuals who did not respond to these earlier contacts
(Dillman, 1978; Fowler, 1993). As a result of these efforts, assurances of confi-
dentiality, and an offer to provide summarized feedback of the survey’s find-
ings, a response rate of 98.2% was achieved (n = 167). Respondents had com-
pleted an average of 17.9 years of education (SD = 1.72), and were an average
of 38.9 years old (SD = 8.97). They averaged 59.8 months of experience in
their present position (SD = 62.4) and 39.2 months of work experience with
their present supervisor (SD = 48.5). The majority of the respondents were
female (114 females, 53 males).

Respondents completed the following instruments.

Measures of Individual Differences Attributes

A ten-item measure of general self-esteem, one of the most widely used
measures of total self-esteem (Blascovich & Tomaka 1991; Rosenberg, 1979;
1965) was employed. (Sample item: On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.)
A twenty-item measure of Machiavellianism (Christie & Geis, 1976) was also
administered. (Sample item: Never tell anyone the real reason you did some-
thing unless it is useful to do so.)

Measures of Work Unit Attributes

A three-item measure of autonomy was employed. (Sample item: How
much autonomy is there in your job; that is, to what extent does your job permit
you to decide on your own how to go about doing the job?)

An index of competitiveness surrounding rewards was created exclusively
for this study. (Item: In order for me to gain rewards at work, someone else
must be denied these rewards, very inaccurate = 1, very accurate = 7.)

The five-item consideration scale of the LBDQ-XII (Stogdill & Coons,
1957) was given. (Sample item: My supervisor’s relation with me can be de-
scribed as friendly and approachable, 1 = never, 5 = always.)

Measures of Negative Emotion

A six-item measure of employee jealousy was used. (Sample item: I feel

depressed when my supervisor speaks favorably about another employee.)

A five-item measure of employee envy was administered (Sample item:
Most of my coworkers have it better than I do.) These measures were derived
from earlier discussions with employed graduate students and prior work by
Mathes (1992) and Hupka and Bachelor (1979), and had been subject to an
initial factor analytic refinement (described in Vecchio, 1995).

Measures of Personal Outcomes

A ten-item measure of organizationally based self-esteem was employed
(Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, & Dunham, 1989). (Sample item: I make a differ-
ence around here).

A seven-item measure of sense of lack of control was included (Pearlin,
Lieberman, Menaghan, & Mullan, 1981). (Sample item: I have little control
over the things that happen to me.)

A single-item measure of propensity to quit was also administered. (Item:

Sometimes I get so irritated, I think about changing jobs.)

Unless otherwise indicated, the scaling of survey items incorporated a five-
point, strongly agree-strongly disagree format. Following completion of the sur-
vey, respondents mailed the material to a university address. Several months
later, each participant received a written summary of the findings of the survey.

RESULTS

Psychometric Issues

In order to understand the underlying factorial structure of the measures of
jealousy and envy, principal axis factoring (i.e., using estimates of commonali-
ties on the positive diagonal of the correlation matrix) with varimax rotation
was performed for the sample’s responses to the eleven items that comprised
the two measures. The pattern of obtained eigenvalues (4.82, 1.24, .87, .79 . . . )

suggested a break after two factors (Cattell, 1966). The two factors that were
extracted, accounting for 55% of the total variance of the 11 items, corroborated
the expected jealousy factor (43.8% of the variance) and the expected envy
factor (11.2% of the variance). Table 1 presents the factor loadings following
orthogonal rotation. Loadings are ordered by size within each factor to facilitate
interpretation. These results indicate that the item responses manifested an ap-
propriate factor structure in light of initial expectations and prior factorial analy-
ses (Vecchio, 1995). Because it can be reasonably argued that feelings of jeal-
ousy may influence one’s sense of envy, an oblique rotation was also conducted.
The resulting loadings reaffirmed the suggested two-factor interpretation. The
loadings for the oblique rotation were (in the same order as the items in Table
1): Factor I, .81, .84, .80, .51, .58, .52, .16, .06, .09, −.05, and −.03; Factor II,
−.03, −.06, −.01, .17, −.01, .08, .71, .69, .55, .52, and .47.

Given that most of the variables under study are inherently attitudinal, con-
firmatory factor analysis was performed to determine whether a multi-factor
representation of the data was superior to a single-factor representation (Jo¨re-
skog & So¨rbom, 1993; Hinkin, 1998). Because the data set contained a large

number of items, there is the expectation that a good-fitting model would not
be estimable (Bentler & Chou, 1987). As a result, the total number of survey
items was reduced by randomly sampling three items from each of the eight
multi-item scales (Brooke, Russell, & Price, 1988). These relatively short, equal
length scales had necessarily modest internal consistency values (median alpha
= .70; range: .33 to .91) relative to the full-length scales (median alpha = .84;
range: .75 to .93). An eight-factor model was then estimated, along with a sin-
gle-factor model. The CFI (comparative fit index) was examined to determine
the fit of each model (as recommended by Bentler, 1990). A CFI of .98 was
obtained for the eight-factor model (χ2 = 95.23 p > .05 df = 76; GFI = .94;
RMSR = .035), versus a CFI of .46 for the single-factor model (χ2 = 622.39, p
< .05, df = 104; GFI = .69; RMSR = .087). Further, a decrease in chi-square
(Bollen, 1989) from the one-to eight-factor model of 527.16 (622.39 − 95.23)
with 28 degrees of freedom was significant (p < .05). These values suggest that
the survey responses are reflective of separate constructs, rather than a single
global affect construct.

The means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations among the variables
of interest are given in Table 2. The directions and magnitudes of correlations
among variables that did not comprise the hypotheses (e.g., the inverse correla-
tions of leader considerateness and autonomy with propensity to quit, and the
inverse correlation of reported autonomy with reduced sense of control) were
reasonable. This evidence of a pattern of relationships that is consistent with
prior findings is of importance as it suggests that the critical analyses will be
based on arguably valid responses. Further, all of the internal reliability esti-
mates (Cronbach alphas) were in an acceptable range (i.e., greater than .70;
Nunnally, 1978).

Correlates of Negative Emotion

The relationships between employee jealousy and envy with the variables
comprising the sets of individual differences attributes, work unit attributes, and
outcome variables are given in the first two columns of the correlation matrix
contained in Table 2. In general, these relationships were supportive of the hy-
pothesized predictions.

Among the individual differences variables, jealousy and envy were signifi-
cantly correlated with self-esteem (r = −.49; r = −.64) and Machiavellianism (r
= .40; r = .42). The individual differences results were, therefore, supportive of
Hypotheses 1 and 2.

For the work unit attributes, employee jealousy and envy were significantly
associated with competitive basis for rewarding employees (r = .23; r = .27) and
autonomy (r = −.16; r = −.39). The correlations for jealousy and envy were also

in the predicted direction for supervisor considerateness (r = −.30; r = −.43).
These results, therefore, supported Hypotheses 3, 4, and 5.

All of the outcome variables provided evidence in support of their relevant
predictions (Hypotheses 6, 7, and 8): organizationally based self-esteem (r =
−.27; r = −.50), sense of reduced control (r = .34; r = .58), and propensity to quit
(r = .24; r = .27).

Hierarchical Regression Analyses

Hypothesis 9 predicted that the sets of independent variables (i.e., individ-
ual differences, work unit attributes, and personal outcomes) would be related
to employee jealousy and envy after alternative sources of influence were con-
trolled. To test this hypothesis, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted
for each negative emotion wherein alternative sources of suspected influence
were entered in a first equation, and the held-out source of interest was entered
in a second equation. The increase in variance accounted for (comparing the R2
of the second equation to the R2 of the first equation) provides an indication of
the unique contribution of the predicter source that is of interest. Formal tests
of the “increase in criterion variance accounted for” were accomplished by con-
trasting a series of regression equations (models) for each criterion (Cohen &
Cohen, 1983; Pedhauzer, 1982). Because jealousy and envy are themselves cor-
related (and, therefore, each is an alternative source of influence for the other),
jealousy or envy were each entered in the first equation in each model test to
provide a result that excluded the possible influence of the alternative emotion.
The results of these analyses are presented in Table 3. The increment in R2
for the dependent measure of envy was statistically significant in all three tests
(∆R2s = .04, .06, .04), while the increment in R2 for the dependent measure of
jealousy was significant in only one test (∆R2 = .06). This indicates that the sets
of variables were more uniquely and strongly associated with the measure of
envy than the measure of jealousy.

DISCUSSION

Despite their acknowledged existence in work settings, employee jealousy
and envy have been neglected topics within the organizational sciences. The
present findings support the contention that employee jealousy and envy are
meaningful constructs within the domain of employee emotion. The pattern of
generally coherent results suggests that individual differences and work unit
attributes are associated with reports of negative emotion, and that the emotions
of jealousy and envy are associated with personal outcome variables even after

removing the potentially extraneous influence of alternative sets of variables.
Additionally, the sets of variables were more strongly associated with envy than
jealousy. It is debatable as to whether envy, relative to jealousy, may be a more
easily operationalized construct, versus the alternative explanations that envy
may simply be a more prevalent phenomenon or a more powerful emotional
influence on employees. Envy, as defined and measured in this study, is cer-
tainly broader in scope than jealousy (in that jealousy focuses on only a single
valued relationship). Moreover, feelings of jealousy can have implications for
feelings of envy, while the converse is not true.

In the present study, the analysis of jealousy focused on relations with
each respondent’s supervisor. This approach offers the advantage that a specific


174

relationship, which exists for all employees, can be studied in terms of the
degree of emotional attachment. Focusing on leader-subordinate relations is also
relatively advantageous as a starting point for studying employee jealousy in
that feelings toward supervisors are likely to be generally more intense (for the
good or bad) than feelings toward coworkers in general, as supervisors often
control rewards that impact on financial well-being, work assignments, and self-
concept. However, this same approach leaves open the question as to whether
the present findings will replicate if jealousy that pertains to protecting valued
relations with coworkers were the subject of study. By contrast, the examination
of jealousy among coworkers (i.e., threats posed to highly valued existing rela-
tions with peers) would require a more in-depth study of workgroup social rela-
tions. For example, it would likely be necessary to interview employees, thereby
threatening confidentiality, on the quality of the many interpersonal relations
that exist within a group. Alternatively, the examination of jealousy among
peers may be amenable to study via third-party reports (as has been used in the
study of the sensitive topic of workplace deviance [Robinson & Bennett, 1995]).
A further issue centers on the observed correlation between the measures
of jealousy and envy (r = .57). The overlap of these measures is reminiscent of
efforts by Ohio State University researchers to determine whether leader consid-
eration and initiating structure are independent constructs (Bass, 1990). Despite
theoretical arguments, measures of these leadership dimensions have been gen-
erally reported to overlap to a degree that is comparable to that of the present
constructs. However, there is good reason to believe that employee jealousy and
envy are not independent in that the experience of jealousy has implications for
social standing (i.e., causing one to feel envious of others), while the experience
of envy does not have any necessary implications for feeling jealous (i.e., to
feel possessive of a social relation). Therefore, envy can exist without feelings
of jealousy, while jealousy may frequently be accompanied by feelings of envy
(Smith, Kim, & Parrott, 1988; Vecchio, 1995).

Two additional measurement issues that should be acknowledged in the
present study are (1) limitations of the use of a common method and a common
source for obtaining the data and (2) the problems inherent in the use of self-
report in general. While the possibility of common-method/-source variance
contributing to the supportive results remains, the results of the CFA and the
use of statistical controls with the regression analyses do reduce this concern to
some degree. As noted by Locke et al. (1996), the possibility always exists that
respondents may invoke self-defense mechanisms when responding to questions
that pertain to sense of self-worth. While Locke et al. were discussing the possi-
bility of faking in the context of measuring self-esteem, the issue of faking is
also a possibility in the realm of measuring feelings of jealousy and envy. That
is to say, respondents may feel inclined to react in a self-defensive manner.
Without any data on this score (or even any clear avenue for how researchers


Employee Jealousy and Envy

175

might assess self-defensive responding in this domain), the best one can do at
this stage is to try to minimize incentives for defensive responding by emphasiz-
ing confidentiality to respondents.

The experience of reduced job-related esteem and reduced control that fol-
lows from the emotions of jealousy and envy typically activates a set of re-
sponses that are intended to rectify the threatening circumstances (Latack &
Havlovic, 1992; Havlovic & Keenan, 1995). These responses can range from
leaving the situation (quitting one’s job or seeking a transfer), to demanding
commitment from others or a greater share of outcomes, to aggressing against
or derogating others. Further, individuals who do not act directly to remove the
perceived threat, and who experience prolonged exposure to such stress, may
be more likely to report symptoms of burnout, irritability, heart disease, and
extreme general dissatisfaction (Adler & Matthews, 1994; Coyne & Downey,
1991; Ivancevich, Matteson, Freedman, & Phillips, 1990; Kinicki, McKee, &
Wade, 1996). Precisely which coping responses an individual will select is pre-
sumed to be influenced by many of the same factors that influence the initial
assessment of threat or loss. That is to say, employee individual differences and
contextual attributes are likely to influence the preference for specific coping
responses. Thus, a further dynamic aspect of the experience of negative emotion
is a feedback process that relates coping response to a subsequent assessment
of perceived loss or threat. If feedback suggests that the response was effective,
the level of negative affect should be reduced. Alternatively, feedback that sug-
gests that the coping response was ineffective should leave negative affect un-
changed and lead to further efforts to identify more effective responses.

The topic of emotion in the workplace is an emerging area of research
interest. Although theoretical and empirical efforts have been made to explain
how employees manage the stress associated with controlling emotional expres-
sion (Hochschild, 1979; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989; 1991; Van Maanen & Kunda,
1989), as well as the consequences of positive emotion for employees (Staw,
Sutton, & Pelled, 1994), there has been a notable neglect of the role of negative
emotion in the workplace. Furthermore, as observed in prior work (Diener &
Emmons, 1985; Myers & Diener, 1995), the constructs of positive affect and
negative affect should be treated independently. The results of findings concern-
ing positive affect, therefore, may not be easily extrapolated to explaining nega-
tive affective processes.

While the present study opens the topics of jealousy and envy to study by
offering specific measures and suggesting sets of variables that are related to
these emotions, there remain a number of items that form an agenda for future
research. Specifically, longitudinal evidence of workplace negative emotion is
important for substantiating possible causal links. Additionally, it would be use-
ful to have evidence from multiple sources (e.g., peer, subordinate, supervisor
reports) that corroborates self-reports of jealousy or envy-based behavior. Also,


176

there is the question of whether it is possible to detect accurately when another
individual is experiencing negative emotion, despite efforts by that individual
to hide such emotions via impression management (Russell, 1991). It may be
possible to identify individuals who are, in the collective opinion of colleagues,
more readily inclined to experience jealousy and envy at work. The study of
coping responses in reaction to jealousy and envy also constitutes an important
avenue for further research.

The practical implications of understanding the dynamics of workplace
negative emotion remain to be explored in terms of how best to facilitate stress
reduction for employees who are experiencing negative emotion that results
from interpersonal relations. There is much more to be learned, for example,
about effective means for managing negative emotion in the workplace. Tech-
niques for coping with jealousy and envy include confrontation, denial/avoid-
ance, deliberate cognitive reappraisal, derogation of others, and seeking support
from others (Vecchio, 1995; White & Mullen, 1989). It is not yet possible to
offer a precise prediction as to which coping technique is likely to occur or to
be maximally effective for given settings. If left unmanaged, individuals may
opt for responses that can be characterized as relatively deviant in nature (i.e.,
oriented toward personal aggression, political activity, production impairment,
and property damage [Robinson & Bennett, 1995]). Some principles that proba-
bly govern the individual choice of coping responses include (a) selecting a
response with the anticipated greatest benefits for the least cost, and (b) acting
more aggressively when there is little justification for circumspect reactions or
when the precipitating events are strongly provocative (Sheppard, Lewicki, &
Minton, 1992).

Two additional directions for future research include negative emotions as
defining elements of organizational culture and the consequences of being per-
ceived as a rival. It is conceivable that some work units and/or organizations
can be reasonably characterized as highly jealousy/envy-ridden. That is to say,
in some units it may be an established social norm that resentment of others is
accepted and actively encouraged. Such units would likely be described as filled
with pettiness, conflict, and “back-stabbing.” Rumor transmission may be rela-
tively prevalent because it is seen as being a valued form of communication in
such settings. Organizational consultants who assist in remedying such dysfunc-
tional settings may be able to offer insights as to the dynamics of these cultures,
and to suggest techniques for reducing envy and jealousy. The consequence(s)
of being perceived as a rival is also a promising research avenue. Resentment
by coworkers can easily undercut one’s desire to perform at high levels, as
well as be highly distracting. Individuals who frequently display “organizational
citizenship behaviors” (Organ & Konovsky, 1989) or who are judged to be
displaying job-focused political tactics (Ferris, Judge, Rowland, & Fitzgibbons,
1994) may be especially likely to be targets of such resentment. Resentment-

prone coworkers may also actively work to construct a norm of underachieve-
ment within a work unit. These arguments, therefore, suggest that there may be
unanticipated negative consequences for individuals who typify the model of
the “good soldier,” as a result of the envy/jealousy-based reactions of coworkers.
