The aim of this paper is to identify the critical enablers to high performance
environmental management (EM). Using empirical data, we explore green
operational practices associated with both self-regulatory and voluntary
environmental standards and their impacts on ﬁrms’ performances in China
under diﬀerent operating conditions (i.e. with Internal EM Programmes or
Supply-Chain-Wide EM Programmes). Our data show that both self-regulatory
(e.g. adopting environmentally conscious operations) and voluntary environ-
mental standard (e.g. adopting ISO 14001 guidelines) approaches positively
related to the overall performance of
the ﬁrm. Voluntary environmental
standards seem to be more highly associated with the overall performance of
the ﬁrm. A major reason for this is the awareness and understanding of
environmental sustainability. Applications of voluntary environmental standards,
such as ISO 14001, thus oﬀer and open up continuous improvement opportunities
to impose greener standards for organisations in China. By focusing on the
critical enablers, ﬁrms in China could become more environmentally responsible
while improving their economic and operational performance.

Introduction

Sustainability is development that meets present needs without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs (United Nations 1987). It is the
current trend to optimise the Earth’s limited resources (Lane and McDonald 2005,
Tsoulfas and Pappis 2006, Muro and Jeﬀrey 2008, Epstein 2009, Kuei and Madu
2009, Hamdouch and Depret 2010, Hamdouch and Zuindeau 2010, Young 2010,
Chang 2012, Madu and Kuei 2012, Zhu et al. 2012). A key issue that is raised here is
how to identify the critical enablers to achieve sustained environmental, economic
and operational performance. Rowland-Jones et al.
(2005, p. 213) deﬁned
environmental management (EM) as ‘‘a methodology by which organisations acting
in a structured manner assess their operations to ensure that they are functioning in

an environmentally legitimate way’’. Deﬁned as such, green operational practices
have long been recognised to be one of the key components of EM (Madu 2004,
Hugo and Pistikopoulos 2005, Rowland-Jones et al. 2005, Tsoulfas and Pappis 2006,
King and Toﬀel 2007, Huang and Shih 2009, Lee 2008, Mori and Welch 2008, Studer
et al. 2008, Feng and Ma, 2009, Ilgin and Gupta 2010, Lin and Ho 2011, Sarkis et al.
2011, Sarkis 2012, Zhu et al. 2012). Mori and Welch (2008), Studer et al. (2008), Wu
et al. (2008), and King and Toﬀel (2007) further note that ﬁrms of all sizes should
adopt either of two approaches to go green: (1) self-regulatory or (2) voluntary
environmental standards (see Appendix 1).

The applications and use of green operational practices are not new in China.
From Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) to Beijing, state-of-the-art solar
powered street lights have long been installed to shine on towns. Promoting and
implementing executable plans regarding energy conservation, renewable energy
purchasing, water usage and conservation, and sustainable construction and
operations have been of paramount importance in the rapid growth of the Chinese
economy for the past decade. Zhu et al. (2011, p. 808) reported that green policies
and regulations in China are focusing on ‘‘enhancing energy savings and pollution
reduction (ESPR)’’. Thus, there is a high level of green-awareness in China. Other
than moving toward a low carbon society (Yu et al. 2011), enterprises in China have
also embarked on green a movement (Zeng et al. 2003, Feng and Ma 2009, Lin and
Ho 2011, Zhu et al. 2011, Zhu et al. 2012). For example, Lin and Ho (2011, p. 69)
explored ‘‘the inﬂuences of technological, organizational, and environmental factors
on the adoption of green operational practices in Chinese logistics industry’’. Their
data showed that
relative advantage and compatibility of green practices,
organisational
regulatory pressures and
governmental supports are associated with green operational practices. The China
cleaner production promotion law was also adopted by the Standing Committee of
the National People’s Congress (NPC) of the People’s Republic of China on June 29,
2002 (http://www.chinacp.com/EN/PolicyDetail.aspx?id¼39). The goal here is to
reduce pollution at its source and optimise the utilisation of production resources.
To transform traditional operational systems to sustainable and environmen-
tally-friendly systems, policy makers need to understand the essentials of internal, as
well as external, EM programmes (Lee 2008, Lee and Klassen 2008, Mori and Welch
2008, Studer et al. 2008, and Zhu et al. 2008a, 2008b). A key challenge for ﬁrms is to
understand critical green operational practices and their impacts on ﬁrms under
diﬀerent operating conditions (i.e. with Internal EM Programmes or Supply-Chain-
Wide EM Programmes). The high impact green operational practices are called
critical enablers of EM.

supports, quality human resources,

In this study, we thus consider the following:

. Which enablers are important with the presence of Internal Environmental
Management (EM) Programmes? How do we measure the impact of such
enablers?

. Which enablers are important with the presence of Supply-Chain-Wide
Environmental Management Programmes? How do we measure the impact of
such enablers?

To address these questions, we explore critical green operational practices in China
under diﬀerent operating conditions (i.e. with Internal EM Programmes or Supply-

Chain-Wide EM Programmes) and test for the association of these variables to
relevant performance outcomes. Such relationships are examined through the use of
the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. Results of the SEM approach,
derived from data based on these two EM programmes, are presented and discussed.
Figure 1 is a graphic depiction of the research framework.

In summary, the primary aim of this research is to understand the eﬀects of green
operational practices in China. The reasons for focusing on China are outlined below:

. China is one of the world’s major generators of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The
United States Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports that China and the
US are responsible for emitting 35% of global GHGs (Congressional Research
Service, 2008, p. 2). Olivier et al. (2012, p. 6) also noted that Global emissions of
carbon dioxide (CO2) reached ‘‘an all-time high of 34 billion tonnes in 2011. . . the
top 5 emitters are China (29%), the United States (16%), the European Union
(EU27 (11%), India (6%) and Russian Federation (5%)’’.

. China is the world’s largest manufacturer of consumer products, such as
colour televisions, washing machines, DVD players, cameras, notebook
computers, motorcycles and cell phones (Brown and O’Rourke 2007), and it
is now the largest trading partner for the US, Japan and India.

. China has experienced rapid economic growth, posting an average of 9.32%
from 1989 to 2011 (http://
the reason

growth in gross domestic product
www.tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual). Part of
for this growth is that the Chinese economy is driven by the supply side.

(GDP)

. IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM Institute for Business Value 2008, p. 1)
recommends that companies in China ‘‘must build up the following areas of
core competencies:
leveraging global assets for peak performance and
eﬀectiveness; diﬀerentiating capabilities for local markets; synchronising
supply and demand; incorporating sustainability in strategies and processes;
managing risk with global partners and enabling collaboration and supply
chain visibility’’. It is thus important to understand the green operational
practices and operational performance in China, since these practices may
inﬂuence local, as well as global, organisational eﬀectiveness.

. Understanding the current states of green operational practices in diﬀerent
organisational contexts in China would help multinational ﬁrms understand
how supply chain operations may be aﬀected in similar Asian countries.

The next section will focus on earlier research on critical dimensions of green
operational practices. In section 3 we present the research procedure for identifying
the key constructs used in this study. In section 4 we present the structural equation
models derived from the data analyses. In section 5 we explore the implications of
EM for operational excellence and also discuss areas for future research. Our
research ﬁndings are helpful to global enterprises to understand the key aspects of
green operational practices and performance outcomes in China. This study also
provides an original contribution to the current knowledge base in EM literature (see
Appendix 1), since we consider both self-regulatory (e.g. adopting environmentally
conscious operations) and voluntary environmental standard (e.g. adopting ISO
14001 guidelines) approaches.

2. Theoretical development

2.1. Green operational practices

The two factors that are often identiﬁed in the literature for green operational
practices are environmentally conscious operations and environmental standards.
The former is an example of a self-regulatory approach (King and Toﬀel 2007),
whereas the latter is a voluntary initiative (Studer et al. 2008). We will examine these
two in more detail.

2.1.1. Environmentally conscious operations

Environmentally conscious operations are associated with gains in competitiveness
and growth in market share (Madu and Kuei 1995, Madu 1996, Madu 2004,
Kleindorfer et al. 2005, Zhu and Sarkis 2006, Lee and Klassen 2008, Molina-Azorı´ n
et al. 2009, Ilgin and Gupta, 2010, Tarı´ and Molina-Azorı´ n 2010, Azevedo et al.
2011, Chiou et al. 2011, Sarkis 2012, Zhu et al. 2012). These have motivated
businesses to adopt self-regulatory approaches that focus on green planning and
design, environmentally-friendly procurement and sourcing, making products and
parts greener, tracking inventory results for waste, emissions and energy consump-
tion, and strengthening the value chain sustainable practices (Ilgin and Gupta 2010).
There are four main areas that are impacted by initiatives such as environmentally
conscious manufacturing and product recovery: environmentally conscious product
design; reverse and closed-loop supply chains; remanufacturing; and disassembly. To
deliver expected outcomes, Molina-Azorı´ n et al. (2009) identiﬁed eight content
variables as leadership, people management, planning, information and analysis,
process management,
focus and
product design. These variables need to be periodically reviewed to achieve better
operational and environmental performances and to develop EM competence. This
is a portfolio of green capabilities and skills developed by enterprises over time (Lee
and Klassen 2008). This involves organisational, managerial, technical and strategic
intents and eﬀorts (Lin and Ho 2011).

supplier management, customer/stakeholder

Conversely, Linton et al. (2007) and Srivastava (2008) focused on green supply
chain management (GSCM) which Srivastava (2008, p. 536) deﬁned as ‘‘integrating

C.-h. Kuei et al.

environmental thinking into supply chain management including product design,
material sourcing and selection, manufacturing processes, delivery of the ﬁnal
product to the consumers, as well as end-of-life management of the product after its
life’’. Linton et al. (2007) noted that a green supply chain could be
useful
implemented through environmentally conscious practices. The emphasis is on
product design, manufacturing by-products, by-products produced during product
use, product life extension, product end-of-life and recovery processes at end-of-life.
Young and Kielkiewicz-Young (2001), Kleindorfer et al. (2005), Linton et al. (2007),
Svensson (2007) and Lee (2008) further suggested that green supply chain strategy,
design and planning and structuring are interlinked. The core of environmentally
conscious operations, from this perspective, is made up of a wide range of practices:
forming cross-functional teams, training and mentoring, supplier management and
eco-design in supply networks. Several studies have reported green supply chain
management practices in China (Zhu and Sarkis 2004, 2006, Zhu et al. 2007a, 2007b,
2008a, 2008b, 2012). Zhu et al. (2008a) described a model that includes ﬁve elements:
inputs, external drivers, enablers, management support and outputs and outcomes.
Vermeulen (2008) noted that there are three dominant green governance modes: a
single ﬁrm, a joint product sector and cross-sectorial. In the ﬁrst mode, ﬁrms aim to
improve both social and environmental conditions along all steps of the supply chain
(Vermeulen 2008, p. 4). Companies such as McDonald’s, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and
Wal-Mart have beneﬁted from their emphasis on green operational practices. The
second mode involves the eco-label organisations and third party independent
auditors. The third governance mode, normally on a voluntary basis, goes beyond
speciﬁc products and sectors. Global partnership on renewable energy, for example,
can greatly accelerate the pace at which initiatives can be incorporated into the
global supply chain. Feng and Ma (2009), employing the cross-sectorial approach,
reported the eﬀorts made in the colour TV industry in China in materials purchasing,
ﬂeet operations, environmentally conscious manufacturing, energy use, ﬁeld use and
product end-of-life management programmes. The report focuses on performance
targets for energy consumption, emissions and wastes from production, transporta-
tion and waste disposal. Another study on the Chinese automobile industry identiﬁes
two major factors aﬀecting environmental sustainability as resource shortages and
environmental burden (Zhu et al. 2007a).

Azevedo et al. (2011) created a taxonomy that categorised green operational
practices into three parts: upstream (green purchasing, collaboration with suppliers,
and green design), focal ﬁrm (green-related programmes), and downstream (colla-
boration with customers, green packaging, green product portfolio, reverse logistics).
It is expected that performance outcomes (economic, operational and environ-
mental) are inﬂuenced by these classiﬁcations of green operational practices. Yilmaz
and Flouris (2010)
identiﬁed four clusters of risks in managing corporate
sustainability: risk of supply chain reputational damage, governance (compliance
and transparency), environmental risk and focal ﬁrm’s reputational risks. Kovacs
(2008) proposed four stages of EM maturity: no assessment, awareness of environ-
mental impact, setting standards and requiring improvement, and collaboration.

2.1.2. Voluntary environmental standards

Voluntary environmental standard initiatives require adherence and compliance to
established environmental standards and also to industry-speciﬁc regulations

1157

(Matias et al. 2002, Zeng et al. 2003, Madu 2004, Elefsiniotis and Wareham 2005,
Casadesus et al. 2008, Castka and Balzarova 2008, Santos et al. 2011, Simon et al. 2011).
One of the most notable environmental sustainability standards is the ISO 14001
guideline (Pan 2003, Zeng et al. 2003, Madu 2004, Kovacs 2008, Wu et al. 2008). The aim
of ISO 14001 is to systematise the implementation of environmental management
systems. This includes environmental policy, planning, implementation, operations,
checking and correction action, and management review. Beneﬁts of such an initiative, as
noted by Pan (2003), include improving corporate image, environmental improvement,
gaining marketing advantage and improving relations with communities. Even though
these are voluntary guidelines, they are becoming increasingly necessary to conduct
business in certain regions of the world. Zeng et al. (2003) indicated that the rapid growth
of the Chinese economy has produced environmental destruction. Roadblocks to
environmental quality include funding to adopt measures for environment protection,
funding to purchase environmentally-friendly equipment, the burden of paperwork, the
awareness of environmental protection, and the complexity of construction activities. The
Chinese government, as suggested by Zeng et al. (2003, p. 107), needs to ‘‘take the lead in
encouraging training, providing ﬁnancial support, and improving the legal framework to
promote ISO 14000 standards for the Chinese construction industry’’. Even though the
study is on the construction industry, the ﬁndings are not unusual and could apply to
other industries.

The prominence of voluntary standards is also evident in Macau, one of the two
special administrative regions of China. From 2001 to 2011, 86 organisations in Macau
were awarded ISO 9001 (quality guidelines) and 34 ﬁrms were awarded ISO 14001 (http://
www.cpttm.org.mo/quality/Info/org_iso_e.htm). As of March 2012, there are 835 ISO
14001 certiﬁcates in Hong Kong (http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/how_help/tools_
ems/ﬁles/iso14k_eac_29.pdf). This trend is also present in mainland China (http://
www.bpir.com/component/Itemid,190/option,com_mojo/p,94/). Applications of these
voluntary standards are opening up new opportunities for organisations to (1) reposition
themselves for sustainable development and (2) turn the capability of sustainable
operational systems to their advantage. Casadesus et al. (2008, p. 1745) also reported that,
in the year 2005, 12,683 new ISO 14001 certiﬁcates were issued in China, an increase of
3821, beating the year 2004’s increase of 3798. A major reason for this surge is the
perceived competitive advantage and enhanced public image from being ISO 14001
certiﬁed. Another salient reason is to make employees and suppliers conscious of the
importance of environmental protection. For many organisations, ISO 9000 systems
seem to be the stepping stone to ﬁnal environmental sustainability (Matias et al. 2002,
Madu 2004, Casadesus et al. 2008, Huang and Shih 2009, Simon et al. 2011). A smooth
transition is possible when an organisation, using the ISO 9000 as the basis, takes on the
ISO 14001 certiﬁcations. Castka and Balzarova (2008) and Elefsiniotis and Wareham
(2005) documented the relationship between sustainable development and ISO 14000
series of standards.

2.2. Overall performance

To achieve overall performance, organisations need to deal with both hard (e.g.
adopting cleaner production equipment) and soft components (e.g.
forming
partnerships between manufacturers and suppliers with respect to eco-design) of
green supply chain management (Zhu et al. 2012). Zhu et al. (2007a, 2007b), for
example, identiﬁed the following performance measures:

(2007b) also found,

that
environmental, economic and operational performance outcomes are consistent
with respondents’ green supply chain management implementation.

through empirical

studies

Using a large dataset on the environmental performance of European ﬁrms in
ﬁve industrial sectors, Hertin et al. (2008, p. 259) reported that there is currently no
evidence that EM systems ‘‘have a consistent and signiﬁcant positive impact on
environmental performance’’. However, they suggested that EM ‘‘may have beneﬁts
other than environmental performance’’ (p. 275).

Madu and Kuei (2004), Lin et al. (2005), Vachon and Klassen (2006), Kuei et al.
(2008) and Aras and Crowther (2009) noted that business performance measures
should include economic and ﬁnancial, as well as social, variables. The economic/
ﬁnancial component includes:

. productivity
. quality
. cost performance
. proﬁtability
. sales growth
. earning growth
. market share.

The social component includes:

. integrity
. social cost
. environmental quality
. social responsibility
. other relevant sustainability indicators.

(2008) use the following three indicators

Wu et al.
their operational
performance construct: product quality, lead time and overall costs. Their data
show that EM is a strategic asset. Operational performance outcomes
are associated with higher levels of green operational practices:
formal EM
structures; environmental performance tracking processes; cross-functional co-
operation mechanisms;
strategic perceptions; and

environmentally responsible suppliers. EM awareness, however, was found to be
not signiﬁcant.

Further, according to Madu and Kuei (2004), Lin et al. (2005) and Chow et al.
(2008), companies normally use a range of measures to determine their successes.
Organisational performance consists of two categories: intangible satisfaction and
tangible business results. Intangible satisfaction includes employee satisfaction,
customer satisfaction and community satisfaction; while tangible business results
consist of productivity, cost performance, proﬁtability, sales growth, earning growth
and market share. Environmentally conscious organisations would normally
emphasise operations competence, environmental performance and ﬁnancial results
(Azevedo et al. 2011). Lee and Klassen (2008) identiﬁed two diﬀerent types of
environmental management capabilities (EMC): internal capabilities (e.g. product,
process and organisation EMC) and external capabilities (e.g. supply chain and
external relationship EMC). Aras and Crowther (2009) discussed the need to have
corporate sustainability report cards incorporating the triple bottom line (i.e.
environmental protection, economic development and social development). Madu
and Kuei (2004) contended that that such a report should include planning,
execution, business results and social impact assessment.

2.3. Organisational conditions and inﬂuences

To ﬁnd answers to our research questions, we need to examine the inﬂuence of
extraneous variables on overall performance. The two organisational conditions we
investigate are (1) Internal Environmental Management Programmes and (2)
Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes.

2.3.1.

Internal Environmental Management Programmes

(2008b)

Zhu et al.
identiﬁed the critical attributes of Internal Environmental
Management as top management commitment, mid-level management support, cross-
functional co-operation, total quality environmental management, and environmental
compliance and auditing programmes. Studer et al. (2008) reported that Hong Kong
government agencies have initiatives to improve small and medium-sized enterprises’
awareness on environmental and social issues. Studer et al. (2008) noted that eﬀective
drivers for going green are: (1) competitiveness and (2) ﬁnances. The former consists of
consumer preferences and stakeholders’ requirements, while the latter includes ﬁscal
incentives and direct ﬁnancial assistance from the government. Further, larger ﬁrms
could provide leadership on responsible change. Enterprise reporting on sustainability
also helps to assess an organisation’s environmental, social and economic performance,
and impacts of their Internal Environmental Management Programmes. Aras and
Crowther (2009) and Kuei and Madu (2009) supported this notion.

2.3.2. Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes

Zhu et al. (2008b) reported that green enterprises must emphasise ﬁve content
variables:

. providing design speciﬁcations to suppliers,

that

include environmental

requirements for purchasing items;

C.-h. Kuei et al.

. co-operation with suppliers for environmental objectives;
. environmental audits regarding suppliers’ internal management;
. suppliers’ ISO 14000 certiﬁcation;
. second-tier supplier environmentally-friendly practice evaluation.

To remain competitive, an enterprise may go beyond internal foci. Cross-sectorial
teams should work together to share appropriate data and green operational
practices across organisational boundaries. This strategy oﬀers opportunities to
reduce logistics costs and wastes, cultivate distinctive (internal and external)
capabilities for environmental sustainability, increase eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness,
and improve communication and co-operation with partners (Tsoulfas and Pappis
2006). Tsoulfas and Pappis (2006, p.1599) outlined four major principles of Supply-
Chain-Wide environmental policy:

. imposing higher (and greener) standards on suppliers and having close

cooperation with them;

. indicating the return, reuse and recovery possibilities, making available the
necessary information regarding recycling, and providing adequate safety
instructions;

. motivating customers and keeping records of where they deliver used products

or packages;

. introducing the eco-objectives to the personnel.

2.4. Conceptual models and hypotheses

Based on an extensive literature review, we develop the following hypotheses:

H1(a): The level of environmentally conscious operations engaged in by ﬁrms in China
with Internal Environmental Management Programmes positively inﬂuences the degree
of overall performance.

H2(a): The extent of a voluntary environmental standard approach engaged in by ﬁrms
in China with Internal Environmental Management Programmes positively inﬂuences
the degree of overall performance.

H1(b): The level of environmentally conscious operations engaged in by ﬁrms in China
with Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes positively inﬂu-
ences the degree of overall performance.

H2(b): The extent of a voluntary environmental standard approach engaged in by ﬁrms
in China with Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes positively
inﬂuences the degree of overall performance.

The conceptual framework for these hypotheses is presented as Figure 2; it is drawn
from the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. One of the most popular
SEM software packages is Lisrel, which is used in this study to ﬁt structural equation
models to our data.

3. Methods

3.1. Sample

The sample is made up of middle-line managers. The focus here is on middle-line
managers because they are the primary executors of the policies of the organisation

from both self-regulatory and voluntary environmental standard perspectives. King
and Toﬀel (2007, p. 2) noted that middle-line managers know ‘‘ways to proﬁtably
protect the environment’’. They were therefore able to answer research questions in
our questionnaire. Although it is highly desirable to collect objective data, we try to
focus on our respondents’ perceptions in this study. In the case of Chinese ﬁrms, Zhu
et al. (2012, p. 183) also acknowledged that ‘‘objective data on performance
improvement are diﬃcult to obtain, or are not existent’’. Non middle-line managers
were removed from the initial data collection stage to ensure that only middle-line
managers participated in the study. A total of 113 managers met the criteria to be
included in this project. A mail survey was used for collecting the data. The study
instrument was also examined by middle-line managers and environmental
sustainability professionals, for content validity. General demographic character-
istics of the respondents are shown in Table 1a, which shows that most participants
were from ﬁnal product manufacturing industries (28.5%), closely followed by
service organisations (26.7%). More than half of the participants were drawn from
larger companies with 2000 or more employees (55.7%). Most also reported that the
business had been operating for more than 10 years (67.3%). As shown in Table 1b,

3.2. Research constructs

The survey instrument developed in this study consists of four main sections. The
ﬁrst section identiﬁes environmentally conscious operations. This part of the
questionnaire was developed based on the relevant literature (Linton et al. 2007,
Ilgin and Gupta 2010). The second section evaluates the general perception on
the adoption of environmental standards such as ISO 14001. This part of the
questionnaire was drawn from studies on voluntary environmental standards
(Zeng et al. 2003, Madu 2004, Casadesus et al. 2008). The third section captures
middle-line managers’ perceptions on corporate performances. This part of the

4. Empirical assessment

As shown in Figure 2, environmentally conscious operations and voluntary
environmental standards are used as unobserved (latent) variables in this study.

C.-h. Kuei et al.

Each unobserved (latent) variable consists of a number of constructs. The
construct is made up of a set of survey items. Two examples are shown in
Appendix 2 (i.e. ﬁrms with Internal EM Programmes or Supply-Chain-Wide EM
Programmes). Organisational performance is used as latent dependent (endogen-
ous) variables. As described in section 2, a number of hypotheses are developed
from our conceptual models. It is important to test these hypotheses empirically
in order to conﬁrm our claims. The general approach of SEM described by Tan
(2001), Lin et al. (2005), Chien and Shih (2007), Chow et al (2008) and Wu et al.
(2008) is adopted and followed here.

4.1. Model for ﬁrms with Internal Environmental Management Programmes

As noted by Tan (2001) and Chien and Shih (2007), to ensure that the empirical results
were acceptable and consistent with the underlying conceptual model, the measurement
and structural models need to be established. The measurement model refers to the
reliability and validity of the constructs in measuring the latent variables. Conversely,
the structural model assesses the direct and indirect relationship between the latent
variables. Table 3a shows the summary results of the measurement model for ﬁrms with
Internal Environmental Management Programmes. Given constructs’ parameter
estimates and their statistical signiﬁcance, it can be seen from Table 3a that three
variables, namely, environmentally conscious operations, voluntary environmental
standards and performance, were all valid measures. Table 4a presents the results of
hypothesis testing of the structural relationships among latent variables for ﬁrms with
Internal Environmental Management Programmes in this study. The ﬁnal results
shown in Figure 3a capture both measurement and structural models of our ﬁrst SEM
analysis. As shown in Figure 3a, the key components of environmentally conscious
operations are: top-down and end-to-end green operations, supplier’s green image and
environmental quality controlling. The green image of the supplier, in this context, is
composed of selecting suppliers based on their records on environmental eﬃciency and
eﬀectiveness (see Appendix 2a). Two focal points of voluntary environmental standards
are ‘awareness and understanding of environmental sustainability’ and ‘standardisation

for green image’. Further, performance outcomes include environmental quality/
improved operations and ﬁnancial results.

As noted by Chien and Shih (2007), the overall model ﬁt is required to pass at least
three ﬁt tests: absolute ﬁt, incremental ﬁt and parsimonious ﬁt. Three sets of ﬁt indices
reported in the Lisrel programme are thus adopted and shown in Figure 3a. The
absolute ﬁt measure GFI (Goodness-of-Fit) determines how well the model in question
ﬁts the sample data. As suggested by Chien and Shih (2007, p. 389), ‘‘a good ﬁt requires
the GFI to be larger than 0.90’’. The incremental ﬁt measure CFI (Comparative Fit
Index) assesses the ﬁt of the model relative to an independent model (i.e. a model with
no observed co-variances). A good ﬁt requires the CFI to also be larger than 0.9 (Chien
and Shih 2007). Parsimonious ﬁt indices such as PNFI (Parsimony Normed Fit Index)
penalise models that are more complex. To study the relative ﬁt, Chien and Shih (2007,
p. 390) suggested the following: ‘‘a PNFI larger than 0.5 is generally considered as a
good model’’. According to the guidelines of ‘test for overall model ﬁt’ prepared by
Chien and Shih (2007) and a thorough examination of alternative goodness-of-ﬁt
indices, at the lower right hand corner of Figure 3a, the data seem to ﬁt the model quite

well from these three reference points. Figure 3a shows that, for example, the overall ﬁt
measure of our data has GFI equalling 0.95, the incremental ﬁt measure has CFI
equalling 0.98, and the parsimonious ﬁt measure has PNFI equalling 0.92. All values
exceed the acceptable thresholds suggested by Chien and Shih (2007). The results
therefore support our proposed structural equation model. In other words, both
hypotheses H1(a) and H2(a) are accepted.

4.2. Model for ﬁrms with Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management (SCEM)
Programmes

Our results show that both H1(b) and H2(b) should also be accepted. Table 3b shows
that the measurement model is valid, because its indicators’ parameter estimates are
statistically signiﬁcant. The direct relationships between the latent variables are
presented in Table 4b. According to the results shown in Figure 3b and the
acceptable thresholds suggested by Chien and Shih (2007), the data ﬁt the model
quite well. The results therefore support the structural equation model. In other
words, there is also a link between the latent variable (i.e. environmentally conscious
operations, voluntary environmental standards) and the overall performance of the
ﬁrm. With the case of environmentally conscious operations, for example, one of
the focal points is now on green training and operations. This construct consists
of
training in the use of environmental quality
improvement tools, green product/process realisation and green purchasing (see
Appendix 2b). In the case of voluntary environmental standards, the attention is
now on the possibility of integrating both quality (e.g. ISO 9000) and environmental
management systems (e.g. ISO 14000). Two performance outcomes also emerged
here: operations competence/environmental quality and business results.

organisations that respond proactively to environmental sustainability and take a
cradle-to-grave approach to their products and services have the opportunity to
achieve operations and/or supply chain excellence in emerging economies. In the
present study, we ﬁrst propose a conceptual framework (see Figure 1) and then

adopt the SEM approach to achieve two goals. The ﬁrst goal is to identify critical
green operational practices along two paths of EM (i.e. environmentally conscious
operations and voluntary environmental standards) adopted by ﬁrms in China. The
second goal
is to investigate the association between critical green operational
practices and organisational performance under diﬀerent operating conditions. Two
such conditions are
Internal Environmental Management
Programmes and Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes.

the presence of

Some of the results of the study, as well as observations, are suggested in the

following paragraphs.

First, green operational practices are part of the strategic initiative of ﬁrms in
China. It is trendy in China. In this context, designing strategy for business success
should begin with a thorough review of critical green operational practices, with a
special focus on the institutionalising of self-regulatory and voluntary environmental
standard processes. Such a review enables the development of an environmentally
sensitive, sustainability-driven, policy aligned, process co-ordinated and society-
based infrastructure and structure. The conceptual framework proposed in the
present study (see Figure 1) and our empirical models may to help identify critical
performance drivers. Policy/decision makers who refer to our empirical model
presented in Figures 3a and 3b may shape a vision and recognise the key enablers of
process change and vital contributors to future business success.

Second, our SEM models (see Figure 2) were conﬁrmed under diﬀerent operating
conditions (i.e. the presence of Internal Environmental Management Programmes
and Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management Programmes). Our data
support the proposed direct eﬀects of hypotheses H1(a), H2(a), H1(b), and H2(b)
on organisational performance (see Tables 4a, 4b). With the presence of the Internal
Environmental Management Programmes, for example, we hypothesised that

Y ¼ aX1 þ bX2ðsee Figure 2Þ;

where:
Y ¼ Overall performance outcome
X1 ¼ Environmentally conscious operations
X2 ¼ Voluntary environmental standards

The result in Table 4a shows Y ¼ 0:54X1 þ 0:57X2: Voluntary environmental
standards thus seem to have more contribution than environmentally conscious
operations in overall performance for organisations. This result shows that
participants in the study have strong motivation to be certiﬁed in environmental
standards such as ISO 14001. This practice of certiﬁcation may be associated with
China’s style of business engagement. In China, both local government and central
government have great inﬂuences on enterprises’ business routes (Zeng et al. 2003).
As a result, Chinese ﬁrms tend to wait for government support and comply with
regulations (Montinola et al. 1985, Studer et al. 2008, Zhu et al. 2011). Designing an
incentive framework for environmental compliance and enforcement thus seems to
be essential for attaining environmental sustainability in China. Therefore, adopting
incentive programmes suggested by Zeng et al. (2003) and Studer et al. (2008) is of
importance here. Zeng et al. (2003) further suggested that the government needs to

Journal of Environmental Planning and Management

1169

keep oﬀering soft-loan and short-term subsidies. This ﬁnding is consistent with that
of Zhu et al. (2007a).

Third, the importance of voluntary environmental compliance and enforcement
programmes such as ISO 14001 standards to a ﬁrm’s long-term success is well known
(Casadesus et al. 2008, Castka and Balzarova 2008). This is also conﬁrmed in this
study. This is probably good and adequate for the time being, but on the whole this
is not encouraging since a voluntary approach in the Chinese manufacturing context
is a reactive one (Zeng et al. 2003). Standing on the global stage, it is our belief that
ﬁrms in China should assume a more proactive and responsible role on green issues,
including the implementation of green supply chain management (GSCM). In other
words, although the promotion of environmental standards requires immediate
attention, the inability to implement other green initiatives based on the principles of
GSCM and follow through on their goals will be one of the major blocks to
environmental quality in the long run. Alternatively, researchers, managers and
policy makers in the domain of EM should pay early attention to the organisational
theoretical view of GSCM reported by Sarkis et al. (2011). Nine organisational
theories and future research directions are reported in the review (Sarkis et al. 2011).
The adoption of proactive green operational practices and the establishment of
enabling green operations/SC systems based on proper organisational theories
should be considered at the present time.

Fourth, the various factors that contribute to the overall performance of a ﬁrm
can be found in Tables 3a and 3b. Our empirical results show that ﬁrms under
diﬀerent operating conditions may have diﬀerent perceptions. Diﬀerences in
perceptions should therefore be taken into account to mobilise commitment and
subsequently build a reliable green operations system. Chinese executives and design
teams need to think through the evolving management paradigm and explore ways
to enhance internal and external environmental management capabilities, as
suggested by Lee and Klassen (2008).

Fifth, over the past few years, the demands on the operational system in China
have shifted into the improvement of processes with the capability to enhance energy
saving and pollution reduction (ESPR). This requires the presence of Internal
Environmental Management Programmes. The relative importance of each enabler
along two paths toward high performance EM, presented in Figure 3a, can therefore
guide studies in the region. Policy makers can refer to our empirical model presented
in Figure 3a, clearly deﬁne the wide range of Internal Environmental Management
Programmes and services, create a shared need and their interpretations, and
propose the steps for implementation. For example, one major practice in this regard
is to consider a supplier’s green image when making strategic sourcing decisions (see
Figure 3a). A supplier’s green image can be judged from their supplier’s operations
in the areas of energy use, ﬂeet operations, pollution prevention eﬀorts, compliance
programmes, and procurement and materials management. This recognition and
change can lead to the development of high performance green operational systems.
Sixth, the summary report shown in Figure 3b is intended to help ﬁrms with
Supply-Chain-Wide Environmental Management (SCEM) Programmes to develop
actions that are both operational and green performance driven. Upon reviewing
those enablers presented in Figure 3b, we suggest that ﬁrms adopting the cross
sectorial approach suggested by Vermeulen (2008) should be aware that there may
also be multiple enablers with the presence of SCEM programmes. Since enablers are
not all equally important, the relative importance of each enabler must be identiﬁed

1170

C.-h. Kuei et al.

ﬁrst before mobilising commitment and devoting any resource to any Supply-Chain-
Wide initiatives. For example, according to participants in the study, ﬁrms in China
that are interested in SCEM programmes should pay early attention to ‘green
training and operations’ (standardised estimate ¼ 0.84). This dimension can be
further disaggregated into sub-factors (see Appendix 2b). The charge here is to
ensure that training and operational procedures are institutionalised to implement
and sustain change.

5.2. Future studies

In this preliminary investigation, we have found some interesting results. However,
as noted by Hertin et al. (2008, p. 275), ‘‘any conclusion about the link between EM
systems and environmental performance is necessarily preliminary, because more
comprehensive data are needed and long-term eﬀects have not yet been studied’’.
This view was shared by Karagozoglu and Lindell (2000). This study, of course, is
not without its limitations. First, the respondents are from diﬀerent types of
enterprises and some unbalanced distribution occurs. In future studies, we need to
test our proposed model (see Figure 2) with larger and more balanced datasets.
Second,
the maturity level of EM suggested by Kovacs (2008), namely, no
assessment, awareness of environmental impact, setting standards and requiring
improvement, and collaboration, is not considered in this study. In future studies, we
need to identify four clusters of EM adopters among Far Eastern countries, or other
regions, and test our proposed model in a more robust manner. Third, we need to
examine the interaction eﬀect between the following two factors in our future
studies: self-regulatory and voluntary environmental standard. We need to ﬁnd a
way to show ‘environmentally conscious operations’ and ‘voluntary environmental
standards’ as mutually reinforcing approaches towards environmental sustainability.
Fourth, we also need to conduct content analyses in follow-up studies to investigate
the following: determinants of soft and hard green operational practices (Zhu et al.
2012), roadblocks to environmental quality, and resource allocation in realising high
performance EM. In addition, some segments of supply chains may be dealing with
diﬀerent types of challenges (Tsoulfas and Pappis 2006, Azevedo et al. 2011) or some
industrial sectors may be facing diﬀerent types of pressures (Zeng et al. 2003, Zhu
et al. 2012) in diﬀerent environmental management (EM) programme contexts. To
understand long-term eﬀects of critical enablers of EM, we need to collect more
comprehensive data. The role of EM is central to achieve various environmental,
economic and operational outcomes. We need to explore the implications of EM
further in multiple contexts that are relevant to modern enterprises and supply
chains in the short and long term.

6. Conclusions

Since the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development
(United Nations 1987) was presented, the world community has made environment
protection a priority. In China, the general public and local governments have also
begun to widely recognise the importance of sustainable development. Chinese
ﬁrms have started feeling the pressure to go green. In this study, we explore the
actions of Chinese corporations with regards
to environmentally conscious
operations and voluntary environmental standards. Our results show that green

important

operational practices would result in improved environmental, economic and
operational performance. Our participants in China considered environmental
standards as the most
factor. Using the voluntary environmental
standards as a stepping stone, organisations in China should continue to develop
organisational, procedural and technical capabilities and capacity to respond to
today’s operational and global supply chain challenges. These challenges are
primarily on responsible change and green supply chain management concepts.
Eﬀorts should therefore be made in future studies to identify green supply chain
competencies in China.

Our results also show that Internal, as well as Supply-Chain-Wide, Environment
Management Programmes should be considered as major change vehicles. The
eﬀectiveness of such interventions should therefore be recognised as key contributors
to the success of green initiatives, and to the continuous improvement of green
operational and supply chain systems. Organisations need to make expert use of such
EM programmes to improve a wide variety of business processes and performance
outcomes.
