Development ofthe  Work Locus of Control

Scale

Paul E. Spector

Department of Psychology,  University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620,  USA

The development of the Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS), a 16-item measure of
generalized control beliefs in work settings, is described.  Included is a discussion of
item  selection, norms,  reliability  and  initial  validation.  Criterion-related  validity is
provided  by  correlations  with  other  theoretically  meaningful  variables  from  six
samples.  The  WLCS  was  found  to  correlate  significantly  with  job  satisfaction,
intention  of  quitting,  perceived  influence  at  work,  role  stress  and  perceptions  of
supervisory style.

Locus of control is a personality variable that has been studied extensively in a wide
variety of settings, including organizations. Despite wide interest, the organizational
studies have been dominated by the use of Rotter's (1966) I-E scale of general locus of
control. Relations between  I-E  and work-related variables have been rather modest.
Phares  (1976) noted  that this scale is a rough measure, and that  researchers  should
develop domain-specific  measures. Described  here is the development of the Work
Locus of Control  Scale (WLCS), specifically  concerned  with the work domain. Re-
lations of work variables with a more specific scale were expected to be larger.

Locus  of  control  is  defined  as  a  generalized  expectancy  that  rewards,  rein-
forcements or outcomes in life are controlled either by one's own actions (internality)
or  by  other  forces  (externality).  In  organizational  settings,  rewards  or  outcomes
include  promotions,  favourable  circumstances,  salary  increases  and  general  career
advancement.

As summarized  in O'Brien's  (1983) and Spector's (1982) reviews, locus of con-
trol  has  been  shown  to  relate  to  a  number  of  organizationally  relevant  variables.
Internals tend to be more satisfied with their jobs than externals, see their supervisors
as higher  on consideration  and  initiating  structure,  report  less role stress, perceive
more autonomy and control, and enjoy longer job tenure. Each of these variables was
explored in the study described here.

Subjects  and  procedure

Method

Subjects  for this study comprised  six independent  samples. Table  1 shows for each
sample the particular variables assessed. In sample 1,151 business administration and


336 
industrial  psychology  undergraduate  students  at  tbe  University  of  Soutb  Florida
were  given  questionnaires  in  class.  Tbey  received  tbe  original  49-item  pool.
Eigbty-six of tbese subjects were employed  at tbe time of tbe study and were given
work-related scales.

P. E. Spector

Questionnaires  were  administered  at  work  to  41  department  store  sales  and
support employees in sample 2. Assistants of tbe researcber banded out tbe question-
naires to employees as tbey picked up tbeir cbeques on payday. Subjects filled tbem
out during tbe work day and deposited them in a box set aside for this purpose in a rest
room.

Questionnaires  were  administered  to  101 mental  health  agency  employees  by
their supervisors in sample 3. Job titles included both direct service (e.g. counsellors
and nurses) and support personnel. They completed them at work in their spare time
and returned them to a box set aside for this purpose in the post room.

Sample 4 data were from  292 national convenience store clerks, store managers
and  district  managers,  collected  by  Michaels  & Boatwright  (1984).  Subjects  were
surveyed at work and posted completed questionnaires to a location  specified.

Questionnaires  for  sample  5  were  distributed  to  160  mental  health  facility
employees  through  department  secretaries  who  handed  them  out  to  employees  in
their  areas  (Storms  & Spector,  1987).  They  were  returned  to  the  researchers  by
internal office mail.

Sample 6 comprised  496 municipal  managers from  Florida  (White & Spector,
1987). Questionnaires  were posted  to a random  sample  who  returned  them  to  the
researchers through the US mail.

Instruments

Work locus of control. Locus of control in work settings was measured with the 16-item
summated rating Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS) provided in the Appendix.
An initial item pool for this scale consisted of 49 items, administered to the subjects in
sample  1. Items were generated  from  a conceptual  analysis of the  locus of  control
construct  and  how  it  relates  to  work  behaviour.  Three  criteria  were  used  in  item
selection—acceptable  item-total  correlations,  lack  of  correlation  with  social  desir-
ability, and that the scale should be balanced with an equal number of internally and
externally  worded  items. Item-totals  ranged  from  0.24 to 0.67, with  a mean  inter-
item correlation of 0.25. Coefficient  alphas for all six samples can be seen in Table 1.
To  be  consistent  witb  Rotter's  I—E Scale, low  scores  represent  internality  on  this
scale.

General locus of control. Rotter's (1966) I-E  Scale was used as the measure of general
locus of control in sample  1. Coefficient  alpha in the current  sample was 0.79. Low
scores on this scale represent  internality.  For samples  5 and 6, Valecha & Ostrom's
(1974) abbreviated version of Rotter's scale was used, with coefficient  alphas 0.72 and
0.71, respectively.

Social desirability. Social desirabilty was assessed with the Crowne & Marlowe (1964)
SD Scale. Coefficient  alpha was found to be 0.80 in sample 1.

Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured with the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS),
a  36-item  summated  rating  scale  of  employee  attitudes  about  their  job  (Spector,
1985). Response choices are the same as for the WLCS. High scores represent  high
levels of job  satisfaction.  Coefficient  alphas  from  the current  samples  ranged  from
0.91 to 0.94.

Organizational commitment. Organizational  commitment  was  measured  with  two
items of the Mowday, Steers & Porter (1979) Organizational Commitment Question-
naire. These two items concerned exceptional effort  for the organization and lack of
loyalty. Response choices were the same as in the WLCS. High scores represent high
levels of commitment.

Autonomy. Autonomy was measured  in sample  1  with one item from  the Autonomy
subscale of the Job Diagnostic Survey (Hackman & Oldham,  1975). Autonomy was
measured in sample 7 with a single item concerning how much autonomy there was on
the job. High scores represented high levels of perceived autonomy.

Perceived influence. Perceived influence was measured with two five-point items. The
first  asked respondents how much say or infiuence they had at work. The second asked
respondents how much  input they had into decisions. The scale ranged from  ' little
or  no '  to  ' a great  deal'.  The  two  items  correlated  with  each  other  0.77  and  were
combined  into a single measure of infiuence.  High scores represented  high levels of
perceived  infiuence.

Leadership. The  Consideration  and  Initiating  Structure  subscales  of  the  Leader
Behavior  Description  Questionnaire  (LBDQ)  were  used  in  this  study  (Stogdill,
1963).  High  scores  represent  high  levels  of  supervisor  consideration  or  initiating
structure. Coefficient  alphas for consideration were 0.90 and 0.89 for samples 2 and 3,
respectively. Coefficient  alphas for initiating structure were 0.88 and 0.83 for samples
2 and 3, respectively. The Consideration scale alone was used in sample 4.

Role  stress. Role  stress  was  measured  with  six  items  from  the  Rizzo,  House  &
Lirtzman (1970) Role Confiict  and Ambiguity scales. Since the independence of the
two  subscales.  Role  Ambiguity  and  Role  Confiict,  have  been  questioned  recently
(Tracy  & Johnson,  1983), it was decided  to combine  items from  both  scales into a
single measure of  role stress.  Scale points  for  these items were the same as for  the
WLCS. High scores on this scale represent high levels of stress. Coefficient  alpha was
0.75 in sample 4.

Additional  items. Two  additional  items were  assessed.  The first, job  tenure,  asked
respondents  how  long  they  had  been  working  at  the  current  job  in  months.  The
second  asked  respondents  how  often  they  had  seriously  considered  leaving  their
current jobs (Michaels & Spector, 1982). Six response choices ranged from'  never ' to
' extremely  often'.

Results and discussion

Table 1 summarizes tbe results for all six samples. Means and standard deviations are
provided  as norms.  Despite  considerable  difTerences  in  the  nature  of  samples  and
data collection procedures, means were quite consistent across samples. In line witb
Rotter's  I-E  Scale,  scores  were  skewed  toward  internality.  Restriction  of  range
produced  by tbe  skewness may  very  well  bave attenuated  relationsbips  witb  otber
variables. Tbe  overall  mean  for  all  1165 subjects  represented  in tbese  samples was
38.1 witb a standard  deviation  of  9.6.  Internal  consistencies  (coefficient  alpba)  are
sbown for all samples.

Sbown  in  tbe  table  is tbe  lack  of  relationsbip  between  tbe  WLCS  and  social
desirability,  expected  since  it was a criterion  for  item  selection.  Sbown  as well are


339
correlations  between  work and general  locus of control. As would be expected the
more specific measure correlates with the more general.

Work Locus of Control 

Validation evidence is provided by the relationships between locus of control and
organizational variables. These results are summarized for six samples in Table 1. As
can be seen, the WLCS did correlate significantly with all variables expected (except
tenure) in most samples. The sign of correlations for each variable (except tenure) was
consistent across samples. For sample 2, non-significance  can be attributed  to small
sample size and consequent low power. For autonomy and commitment in particular,
small correlations may have been due in part  to the use of weak (one or two-item)
scales.

Although the WLCS does correlate with general locus of control measures, many
of the relationships described above are considerably stronger than those found with
the more general locus of control scales. Thus it seems that the WLCS may predict
work behaviour more precisely than the general scales.

Overall, the results of this study suggest that the WLCS is a viable scale. Internal
consistency is adequate, and early work, based on a limited  number of samples and
subjects,  provided  solid validation  evidence.  Further  work  needs to be done using
both the WLCS and I-E scale in parallel, testing further  hypotheses in various work
settings.

This  research  was supported  in part  by a Creative  Scholarship  Grant  from  the University  of  South
Florida.

A job is what you make of it.
On most jobs, people can pretty much accomplish whatever they set out to accomplish.
If you know what you want out of a job,  you can find a job that gives it to you.
If  employees are  unhappy  with  a decision  made by  their  boss, they  should  do  something
about it.
Getting thejob you want is mostly a matter of luck.
Making money is primarily a matter of good  fortune.
Most people are capable of doing their jobs well if they make the  effort.
In order to get a really good job you need to have family members or friends in high places.
Promotions are usually a matter of good  fortune.
When it comes to landing a really good job,  who you know is more important than what you
know.
Promotions are given to employees who perform well on the job.
To make a lot of money you have to know the right people.
It takes a lot of luck to be an outstanding employee on most jobs.
People who perform  their jobs well generally get rewarded for it.
Most employees have more influence on their supervisors than they think they do.
The main difference  between people who make a lot of money and people who make a little
money is luck.

"These items should be reverse scored.
