 THE IMPACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
 OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR
 ON THE MARKET

 AHMED BELKAOUI

 Dr. Belkaoui is Associate Professor of Accounting at the University of Ottawa
 (Ottawa, Ontario). He holds a PhD from Syracuse University and is the author
 of numerous articles in financial, managerial and behavioral accounting, and
 security market research.

 Corporations interact with their environment. Guiding
 their behavior is the goal of maximizing shareholder
 wealth, an objective which is not obviously affected by
 social costs associated with pollution and other ex-
 ternalities [2]. These social costs should be identified,
 measured and reported if corporations are to fulfill their
 social as well as their shareholder responsibilities [1].

 that these expenditures provide material information to
 investors. The information is essential if investors are
 going to properly consider the negative effects of pollu-
 tion abatement expenditures on earnings per share along
 with any compensating, positive effects that reduce risk
 or create greater interest from a particular investment
 clientele.

 The accounting profession has taken few positive steps
 to report social costs and the expenditures made by cor-
 porations to reduce them. However, the 1970-71 annual
 reports of companies in industries as diverse as chemical,
 food, petroleum, and pulp and paper do include informa-
 tion on pollution control either in the president's letter or
 in the review of operations. This disclosure suggests that
 the managers of some corporations see an advantage in
 making these expenditures and see some reason for dis-
 closing that information to investors.

 The pollution abatement expenditures are not trivial.
 For some large firms they may reach to 4% of sales and
 10% of capital investment [10]. In the steel industry, the
 abatement costs are reported to be as high as 25% of
 capital investment [4]. Their size supports the conclusion

 Some argue that risk reducing effects will more than
 compensate for expenditures on pollution control: "Be-
 tween firms competing in the capital markets those per-
 ceived to have the highest expected future earnings in
 combination with the lowest expected risk from environ-
 mental and other factors will be most successful at at-
 tracting long-term funds" [9]. Others believe that "ethical
 investors" form a clientele that responds to demonstra-
 tions of corporate social concern [11]. Investors of this
 type would like to avoid particular investments entirely
 for ethical reasons as the 1966-68 Committee on External
 Reporting of the American Accounting Association points
 out [10], and would prefer to favor socially responsible
 corporations in their portfolios. The United Church of
 Christ, for example, has issued a 61 page booklet, In-

 vesting Church Fundsfor Maximum Social Impact, which
 advises investment in socially responsible firms. A dif-
 ferent view is summed up in the Beams-Fertig theory
 [3] which holds corporations that report the least activity
 in avoiding social cost will appear more successful to
 investors and will be favored by the market.

 These conflicting views on the effect of pollution con-
 trol expenditures and their disclosure provide two hypoth-
 eses about stock price behavior:

 1. During the months following the disclosure date of
 pollution control expenditures (annual report date), the
 common stock prices of disclosing corporations will be
 favorably affected.
 2. Corporations identical in asset size and industry classi-
 fication that do not disclose such expenditures will not be
 as favorably affected.

 Acceptance of both hypotheses is equivalent to refuting
 the view that corporations demonstrating and reporting
 the least concern for social costs are rewarded by the
 capital market.

 Theoretical Justification

 There are two competing theories which explain the
 impact of pollution control expenditures on the stock
 market.

 The first is an efficient markets view. Pollution con-

 trol expenditures affect earnings per share directly by
 increasing cost of goods sold and indirectly by affecting
 the expected risk from environmental factors. The net
 result could be a decrease in earnings per share and a
 reduced risk. In short, the disclosure of such expenditure
 might be followed by both change in expected earnings
 and a change in risk class and discount rate. The market
 would react to the information content of disclosure. Such
 a reaction is consistent with the proposition that the market
 for securities is a semi-strong efficient market in the sense
 that market prices "fully reflect" all publicly available
 information, and, by implication, that market prices react
 instantaneously and unbiasedly to new information. In the
 semi-strong hypothesis of an efficient market, pollution
 control expenditures would constitute "inside informa-
 tion" and there should be no market reaction until they
 become public information in the financial statements.
 If reactions occur after disclosure, then it can be con-
 cluded that disclosure of abatement costs reflect events
 that affect the value of a corporation.

 The second view, often referred to as the "naive in-

 vestor hypothesis," assumes that the majority of investors
 are relatively unsophisticated with respect to accounting
 techniques. These investors regard changes in earnings

 per share more important and consequently do not react
 to specific information such as pollution control expendi-
 tures. They are conditioned to react to accounting data
 only in terms of earnings per share. As stated by Sterling:
 "Accounting reports have been issued for a long time,
 and their issuance has been accompanied by a rather
 impressive ceremony performed by the managers and ac-
 countants who issue them. The receivers are likely to have
 gained the impression that they ought to react, and have
 noted that others react, and thereby have become con-
 ditioned to react" [14].

 With these opposing theories and the objectives of the
 study in mind, two groups of 50 American firms from dif-
 ferent industries were chosen. The first, an experimental
 group, included those firms which disclosed pollution
 control information in their 1970 annual reports. An at-
 tempt was made to choose firms with material pollution
 control expenses equivalent to at least one percent of
 their sales. The second, a control group, included firms of
 a similar industrial classification and asset size.

 Experimental Variable

 The market model was used. First suggested by Marko-
 witz [7] and later extended by Sharpe [13], it defines
 the stochastic process generating security price changes.
 In a manner which follows the work of Fama, Fisher,
 Jensen, and Roll [6]:

 rit = ai + q3rmt + Uit

 where

 rit = continuously compounded rate of return of

 security i in period t

 = Ln(1 + R,t) = Ln [(Pt + D) / Pt-

 Rit = non-compounded single-period return of se-

 curity i in period t,

 ai, 38i = intercept and slope of the linear relationship

 between rit and rmt,

 rmt = market factor in period t

 = Ln(spSOOt / sp500t_), and

 Uit = stochastic portion of individualistic compo-

 nent of rit.

 In this model, rit is used instead of Rit because it has
 fewer outliers in its relative frequency distribution and
 will therefore yield more efficient risk statistics than Rit.
 Also, it is distributed more symmetrically than the posi-
 tively skewed Rit variable [6]. This substitution does not
 alter the results of the Markowitz and Sharpe models [5].
 This model basically shows the existing linear relation-
 ship between the expected return on security i and the

 expected return of the market factor represented here by
 the Standard and Poor 500. The rationale for such a model
 is the ability to discriminate between two types of events
 which affect a security's return: the market events which
 cause a response reflected in /3i and the events particular
 to security i, which are reflected by the residual Uit. The
 error term Uit is the portion of security return not attribu-
 table to general economic effects. In this study, the isola-
 tion of these two types of events is essential for testing
 the informational effect of pollution control expenditures.

 Data Collection, Regression Estimates and
 Error Terms

 market model ai and fi were determined for each com-
 pany by a least square regression over the 24 observa-
 tions. On the basis of the above results, the error term
 Uit for each company and for each of the 24 months was
 computed as follows:

 Uit = rit - ai - firmt.

 These errors, as stated earlier, impound all the factors
 influencing the company that are independent of market
 events. To abstract the general trend due to the disclosure
 impact from the individual company fluctuations an aver-
 age residual across companies for each period and for both
 the experimental and control groups was computed as
 follows:

 The precise month T in which the pollution control
 information reached the market was determined from the
 annual report disclosing the pollution control information.
 Then, monthly closing common stock prices were ob-
 tained for each of the 100 companies for the 12 months
 before and 12 months after the annual report announce-
 ment. The Standard and Poor 500 for the same months
 was used as the general market index of performance.
 Both stock price and Standard and Poor relatives were
 recorded each month from T- 12 to T+ 12, a total of 24
 observations, for each company. The parameters of the

 Data Analysis and Interpretation

 The error terms, Ut, for each group are plotted in Ex-
 hibit 2. For the experimental group, Exhibit 2 shows that
 most of the error terms prior to disclosure date are located
 in the lower left quadrant while four of the error terms sub-
 sequent to the disclosure date are positive and located in
 the upper right quadrant, and the rest of the errors are
 negative and in the lower right quadrant. The same exhibit
 shows a behavior of the error terms for the control group
 completely different from that of the experimental group.
 The Mann-Whitney test was applied to the error data.
 Like other non-parametric tests, it does not require rigid
 assumptions about the population from which samples are
 taken [12]. The first null hypothesis was that both the
 experimental group and the control group had the same

 distribution. The second null hypothesis was that the error
 terms for the experimental group had the same distribution
 before and after the disclosure date. Both hypotheses were
 rejected in a two tail test at a = 0.002.

 The results can be interpreted considering both the

 efficient market hypothesis and the naive investor hypoth-
 esis. During the period prior to disclosure of pollution
 control expenditures, the disclosing companies were per-
 forming more poorly than the market. For a period of
 four months after disclosure the performance of the stocks
 was better than the market, indicating a sharp reaction to
 disclosure. The advantage over the market decreased
 from T+2 to T+4 and then became a disadvantage for
 the rest of the period, implying that the additional in-
 formation had an immediate but temporary effect on the
 market. The first explanation would be that the market

 made a temporary conversion of the positive effect of
 pollution control expenditures in higher share valuation.
 This raised the price of the group to a level where the
 efficient market found them to be fully valued and started
 selling the shares. This led prices to go down to a level
 where the market appraised them on fundamentals. The
 results, accordingly, follow the "efficient market hypoth-
 esis" over a wide period of time. The second explanation
 would be that the increase in the market price takes place
 when "ethical" investors buy shares on the strength of
 better social image conveyed by the disclosure. However,
 such predisposition was only temporary, as conveyed by
 the decrease from T+2. In this respect the results follow
 the "naive investor hypothesis" over a short period of
 time.

 Conclusion

 It is evidently quite difficult to isolate the specific

 effects of pollution control expenditures on the price be-

 havior of the stock market because of the presence of a
 myriad of other influencing factors. This investigation of
 50 companies which disclosed their pollution control ex-
 penditures showed a significant change centered on the
 date of disclosure, and the resulting expectations had
 apparently a substantial and temporary effect on the stock
 market performance. This result follows the efficient
 market hypothesis in its semi-strong form. Under the
 naive investor hypothesis it verifies the existence of an
 "ethical investor." In general, this study refutes the sug-
 gestion that the worst offenders in the reporting of social
 costs will be rewarded more in the capital market. In fact,
 on the basis of these results, managers may be advised
 to allocate a proportion of their resources to pollution con-
 trol and to report these expenditures to the stockholders.
 One might even assume that in the long run, the firm
 which installs pollution control devices now may have
 better income and less risk of plant closings by the En-
 vironmental Protection Agency in the next decade than a
 competing firm which postpones such expenditures until
 it is forced to make them later.
