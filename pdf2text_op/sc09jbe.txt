ABSTRACT. In this article, we examine the effect of
corporate social responsibility (CSR) on firms’ financial
performance (CSR-effect). Two competing hypotheses,
social
focus hypothesis, are
proposed to investigate this
issue, where the former
suggests that CSR has a positive relation with perfor-
mance and the latter are opposite. In order to ensure the
CSR-effect
is not contaminated by other factors or
samples are randomly drawn, we employ four matching
methods, Nearest, Caliper, Mahala and Mahala Caliper to
match the samples of CSR (CSR-ﬁrms) and without
CSR (NonCSR-ﬁrms) with similar
characteristics.
Although four methods yield slightly different results,
ﬁrms engaging in CSR activities tend to obtain signiﬁ-
cantly higher values on pretax income to net sales and
proﬁt margin, and adopting CSR at the very least not
deteriorate the performance of ﬁrms, making our con-
clusion favors the social impact hypothesis and against shift of
focus hypothesis in Taiwan. Thus, ambition and conscience
are not conﬂicting with each other.

Introduction

A corporation is not only beholden to the wealth
maximization of stockholders, but also take care of
interests of employee and consumers, maintaining
working opportunity of underprivileged minority,
protecting environment of community and ecology,
etc. This is the concept of corporate social respon-
sibility (CSR),1 which advocates taking care of the
interest of all stakeholders in addition to the stock-
holders, becomes
an alternative framework of

measuring ﬁrm achievement around the globe in
recent years.

evidence

Corporations around the world are realizing they
have a responsibility to be good citizens2 and
Taiwanese companies are taking heed because of
vital links in the global supply chain and faced with
scrutiny from overseas customers and market regu-
lators. Anecdotal
that many
Taiwanese ﬁrms are putting the following words
into practice, ‘‘if you take from society, put back
into society.’’ For example, Lite-On Technology
Co. forms Lite-On Cultural Foundation with more
than 1,000 volunteers to help schoolchildren who
have slight or moderate behavioral problems as a
result of dysfunctional family lives at 39 primary
schools across northern Taiwan. Gigabyte, a manu-
facturer of motherboards and mobile phones, has
been using an internet platform to get fruit farmers
together with corporate purchasers, creating a new
public service model. Thousand of cases are bought
by over 2,000 employees and help farmers to rebuild
their homes after the 1999 earthquake. The late vice
president of Inventec Co., Sayling Wen, he helped
the local vocational school in a poor rural town in
China named Huangyangchuan to set up a website
and an e-commerce system, and by selling local farm
products over the web, the residents lifted them-
selves out of poverty.3

Even so the popularity of CSR with some ﬁrms
responded to these concerns by devoting more
resources, others have resisted by arguing that
additional investments in CSR is inconsistent with
proﬁt maximization.

the shareholders, and invested the money instead
into production of low price car, purportedly to

the populace and
improve local employment. This may have served
Henry Ford’s
in keeping the minority
shareholders, the Dodge brothers, from using their
investments. The court ruled against Ford and said
that: ‘‘A business corporation is organized and car-
ried on primarily for the proﬁt of the stockholders.
The powers of the directors are to be employed for
that end. The discretion of directors is to be exer-
cised in the choice of means to attain that end, and
does not extend to a change in the end itself, to the
reduction of proﬁts, or to the nondistribution of
proﬁts among stockholders in order to devote them
to other purposes.’’ Thus, the clincher to be con-
cerned is that sustainable CSR activities should lead
to improvement, at least not deteriorate the ﬁnancial
performance.

Academically, there are two prominent conﬂicting
theoretical views regarding the ﬁnancial impacts of
CSR. The social impact hypothesis, proposed by Cornell
and Shapiro (1987) and Preston and O’Bannon
(1997), claims positive association between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance. Several channels could explain
this positive effects, such as providing better working
place improves employee productivity (Turban and
Greening, 1997); donation to the public beneﬁts
increases social reputation, trust (Bowman and Haire,
1975; Alexander and Buchholtz, 1978) and brand
image and product competitiveness (Porter and van
der Linde, 1995; Fombrun et al., 2000). Studies by
Moskowitz (1972), Parket and Eilbirt (1975) and
Soloman and Hansen (1985) also claim that CSR leads
to more beneﬁts than the cost incurred, suggesting
that there is positive correlation between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance. As for Taiwanese companies,
there are more and more manufacture products sold
by major European, U.S, and Japanese brands. The
major brands are held to account by the media,
stockholders and customers, and the responsibility
ﬂows downstream. CSR improves company’s image
and the customers prefer to do business with good
companies and, thus, gain beneﬁts.

The shift of focus hypothesis, the competing view,
suggested by Becchetti, Ciciretti and Hasan (2007),
argue that most of the CSR activities such as building
employee and community relationship, providing
environmental protection and improving corporate

governance causes a shift of focus from the maxi-
mization of stockholders’ value to the interests of a
wider set of stakeholders and thereby increasing the
ﬁrm’s costs. Previous studies also argue that corpo-
rations engaged in CSR activities are found to have
lower market competitiveness and worse perfor-
mance through using resources inefﬁciently (Friedman,
1970), limiting product developments (Bragdon and
Marlin, 1972) and pushing nonproﬁtable social
activities
(Aupperle et al., 1985; Vance, 1975;
Ullmann, 1985). Particularly noteworthy is the lack
of public responsiveness to philanthropic behavior as
well as the insigniﬁcant feedback effect on ﬁnancial
performance (Henderson, 2002; Walley and White-
head, 1994). Therefore, ﬁrms having higher social
awareness result
in worse ﬁnancial performance.
Some Taiwanese companies may take longer to get
involved with CSR because most are small and
medium-sized enterprises with limited resources.
Many companies are also reluctant to invest because
they are not sure how long they will get back the
money and how long they will be in business.

Empirical studies regarding the relation between
CSR and performance are mixed.4 Supporters of
social impact hypothesis, such as Cochran and Wood
(1984), adopted Moskowitz’s (1972) reputation in-
dex, which rates ﬁrms into outstanding, honorable
mention and worst companies, as the proxy of CSR
measurement. They ﬁnd that CSR ratings positively
affect ﬁrms’ accounting returns. Waddock and
Graves
(1997) employ similar reputation ratings
developed by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini
(KLD) as the proxy of CSR5 and also found ﬁnd that
past and current KLD ratings are positively related to
subsequent ﬁrm performance. Tsoutsourz (2004)
also employ KLD rating and conﬁrm these results.

Alternatively, the shift of focus hypothesis also
receives substantial supports. Vance (1975) employs
Moskowitz’s (1972) ratings and ﬁnd that ﬁrms with
better ratings have lower stock returns. Newgren
et al. (1985) ﬁnd that those ﬁrms with environ-
mental assessment have inferior stock market returns.
Brammer et al. (2005a) examine the relationship
between stock returns and CSR score, proxied by
the composite indicator constructed from environ-
ment protection,
relationship and
ﬁnancial transparency. They ﬁnd that CSR scores on
composite indicator
are signiﬁcantly negatively
related to stock returns.

While the above conﬂicting empirical results may
be a result of using different proxies of CSR or
different sample periods and ﬁrms used, one of their
common features is that the adoption of CSR may
be endogenously determined. That is, ﬁrms with
better performance tend to adopt CSR because they
have excess proﬁt to engage CSR but not vice versa.
That is, when comparing ﬁrms taking on social
causes (CSR-ﬁrms hereafter) with those that do not
(NonCSR-ﬁrms hereafter), we expect that the only
difference between the two groups is the engage-
ment of CSR in the former but not in the latter,

suggests using a two-stage
method to eliminate sample selection bias. The ﬁrst
step is to estimate a probability model. The resulting
inverse Mill’s ratio serves as the explanatory variable
in the performance function. Hoﬂer et al. (2004)
point out two difﬁculties for this approach. First, this
approach needs to satisfy an identiﬁcation require-
ment. That is, we must have at least one variable in
the probability model that is not included in the

The second approach, i.e., to eliminate sample
selection bias is the adoption of the matching theory
which is developed mainly in the medical and bio-
logical research ﬁelds and has been widely used in
economics and ﬁnance. In standard medical or bio-
logical
studies, observations participating in an

samples.
Nonparticipants of experiment
that have similar
characteristics with participants are called the con-
trolled samples. The changes owing to the experi-
ment between treatment sample and control sample
is referred to as experimental or treatment effect.
The basic concept of matching theory is that, when
examining treatment effect, the treatment sample
(e.g., CSR-ﬁrm) should have similar characteristics
as those of the controlled sample (e.g., NonCSR-
ﬁrm). If they have similar characteristics, then the

resulting difference between two matched observations
is theoretically the treatment effect (e.g., the effect of
CSR activities on ﬁnancial performance). In other
words, other characteristics of ﬁrms in two groups
should be roughly the same to ensure the sample is
random determined or is exogenously given. See
Rubin (1973) for details.

While the original concept of matching theory is
simple, its implementation is not because matching
two or more ﬁrms with the same multi-dimensional
characteristics is difﬁcult, especially when the dimen-
sions are large. The matching, once successful, often
reduces the available sample substantially. Rosen-
baum and Rubin (1983, 1985a, b) proposed Pro-
pensity Score Matching (PSM)
to resolve this
problem as it reduces multi-dimension matching to
only one-dimension matching. PSM contains two
steps: The ﬁrst step is to estimate the probability of
including in the experiment by all samples using
characteristic variables as the explanatory variables.
Then for each ﬁrm in the treatment sample, ﬁrms in
the control samples are selected as matched samples
according to the closeness of the above estimated
probability. Therefore, the multi-dimensional char-
acteristics are projected into one-dimensional prob-
ability and still fulﬁll the requirement of other things
being equal. Rubin and Thomas
further
prove that
the use of PSM can overcome the
selection bias problem.

(1992)

and ﬁnances

The applications of PSM to investigate the
treatment effect as well as removing the selection
bias problem in economics
are
increasing. Persson (2001) applied this methodology
to investigate the effect of joining currency unions
on trade growth of countries. Hutchison (2004)
examined the effect of IMF program participation
on output growth. Hoﬂer et al. (2004) investigated
the relationship between institutional ownership and
dividend payout behavior of the ﬁrm while using
PSM to control for selection bias problem. Glick
et al. (2006) applied PSM in currency crisis and
liberalization, Vega and Winkelried (2005) in inﬂa-
tion targeting, Ham et al. (2004) in migration and
wage growth of young men.

One caveat is worth noting. In order to investi-
gate the CSR effect, it is often suggested to compare
the performances of a ﬁrm before and after adopting
CSR. We do not conduct this comparison for three
reasons. First, the macro environments may not be

the same for two periods, making other things not to
be the same. Second, engaging in philanthropic
activities by a ﬁrm is usually a gradual process and we
can hardly identify the exact starting date of this
behavior. Third, the ﬁrms’ characteristics may not be
the same in the two periods.

Measures of corporate social responsibility

The estimation of effect of CSR activities on
ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms often confronts with
the problem of classifying CSR- from NonCSR-
ﬁrms. In early stage of research, the CSR-ﬁrms are
often deﬁned by those which spend the amount of
polluting control investment, expenditure on envi-
ronmental
recuperation and protection, prestige
investigation from business
students, and
social reputation ratings by leading business maga-
zines, such as the Fortune, Times, and Business Ethics.7

school

Recently, some research and ﬁnancial institutions,
like the above-mentioned KLD and FTSE, develop
some widely acknowledged social responsible criteria
which gradually became an international standard.
For example, KLD rates company as a CSR-ﬁrm on
the basis of the eight criteria, i.e., community, cor-
porate governance, diversity, employee relations,
environment, human rights, product quality and
controversial business issues. Also, the ﬁrms included
in FTSE4GOOD indices must meet
criteria
requirements in three areas, environmental, social
and stakeholders, and human rights. Also,
those
companies whose business interests are involved in
tobacco, nuclear weapons and power station, and
uranium are also excluded from the index. These
indices have been widely employed.8

In order to understand the status of CSR aware-
ness and fulﬁllment among Taiwanese corporations,
and to help bring Taiwan in line with global trends
in this area, the GVM conducted its ﬁrst ‘‘Survey of
Corporate Social Responsibility’’ of around 700
publicly listed companies in 2005. The magazine also
established the annual ‘‘Corporate Social Responsi-
bility Award’’ to commend domestic companies for
CSR excellence and encourage speciﬁc action and
attention to this area.

The framework of evaluating performance of
social responsibility is following three dimensions,
which are social participation, environmental pro-
tection and ﬁnancial
transparency. To be more
speciﬁc, they refer to OEKOM, an independent
research and rating agency of CSR in Germany, to
design a questionnaire about engagement
and
effectuation of the above three aspects for ﬁrms listed
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. They then compute
scores on each three dimensions of CSR activities
based on respondents’ reply. Finally, they ranked
companies according to their total scores upon three
aspects. Firms with the following infamies are also
eliminated from rating: negative events challenged
by government agencies like Environmental Pro-
tection Administration or Council of Labor Affairs;
major controversy between the labor and capital,
agro with consumers,
litigation and departure
restriction of CEO; and losses for years.

institutions, making our CSR samples be 20. Other
TSE-listing companies are deﬁned as the control
samples, with a total of 640 NonCSR-ﬁrms. The
ﬁrst announcement of these ranking is on May 2005,
which determines our sample period from 2005Q2
to 2006Q1.

Estimating the effect of adopting CSR

Our goal is to use matching methods to estimate the
effects of CSR on the ﬁnancial performance of a
ﬁrm. Following Dehejia and Wahba (2002), we
deﬁne Yi1 and Yi0 as the ﬁnancial performance of
ﬁrm i with and without adopting CSR, respectively.
The difference of the performance between these

is,

¼ EðY1

D ¼ 1Þ   EðY0






D ¼ 1Þ;

ð1Þ

where D is a dummy variable and is equal to one
if ﬁrms adopt CSR and zero otherwise. The esti-
mation of equation (1) is nonfeasible because the
second term, E(Y0|D = 1) is not observed, that is,
we are not able to observe the performance of
ﬁrm without engaging in CSR when it is actually
a CSR-ﬁrm. Conventional wisdom suggests using
E(Y0|D = 0) to substitute it. However,
for this
substitution to be valid, the following conditional
independence
(Rosenbaum and
Rubin, 1983; Rubin, 1973) needs to hold:

assumption (CIA)

Y1; Y0?DjX

where ? denotes independence and X is a vector of
characteristic variables that are unaffected by the
treatment. This assumption states that, conditional
on a set of observable X, the treated and control
groups are regarded as being drawn from the same
population. Firms are randomly selected to be in
the treated group, therefore, the only difference
between the two groups are the treatment effect.
Then, E(Y0 |D = 0) is an unbiased estimator for

E(Y0|D = 1). Alternatively,
if the treatment and
control group differ systematically, we have to con-
sider them to be nonrandom sampling of the same
population or drawn from different populations,
and thus, E(Y0|D = 0) is no longer an appropri-
ate substitute for E(Y0|D = 1). The difference
between these two measures is the selection bias.

The CIA could fail by two reasons (Heckman
et al. 1998). One is that when the characteristic
variables of CSR-ﬁrms are not comparable with
those of NonCSR-ﬁrms (noncomparability bias).
The other is the different distributions of X between
the treated and the control groups (distribution bias),
which suggests that ﬁrms are not picked via ran-
domized process.

Matching
the
aforementioned bias by pairing CSR-ﬁrms with
NonCSR-ﬁrms that have similar observed char-
acteristics. The paired NonCSR-ﬁrms
are the
counterfactuals
for CSR-ﬁrms, and hence we can
attribute the difference of outcome between them
to the treatment effect. Through this matched
counterfactuals, we can reestablish the conditions
of a randomized experiment when actually no such
data are available.

The propensity score
Matching all variables in X becomes nonfeasible as
the dimension of number of variables increases. In
order to overcome this problem of dimensionality,
Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) propose propensity
score matching (PSM), which reduces a multidi-
mensional matching problem to a one-dimensional
problem. Speciﬁcally,
instead of matching on a
vector X, we can match on an index function P(X).
This index, the propensity score, is the probability of
treatment conditional upon observable characteris-
tics (the probability of being a CSR-ﬁrm),
PðXÞ ¼ EðDjXÞ ¼ PðD ¼ 1 XÞj

which states that observations with the same pro-
pensity score must have the same distribution of X
independent of the treatment status.9

The noncomparability bias can be eliminated by only
considering ﬁrms within the common support, the
intersection on the real line of the supports of the
distribution [P(X)| D = 1] and [P(X)| D = 0]. The
bias from different distributions of X is eliminated by
reweighing the NonCSR-ﬁrms observations.

The estimation of the propensity score proceeded
with the following steps. Starting with a parsimo-
nious Logit or Probit speciﬁcation to obtain the
estimated propensity score Pr(Di = 1|Xi)
for all
and NonCSR-ﬁrms,10 which are
CSR-ﬁrms
denoted as Pi and Pj, respectively. Since it is rare to
ﬁnd two groups with exactly the same propensity
score, the objective is to ﬁnd the NonCSR-ﬁrms
whose propensity scores that are ‘‘sufﬁciently’’ close
to those of the CSR-ﬁrms.

Two criteria are often suggested in the literature
to ﬁnd the approximation. The ﬁrst criterion is the
Nearest-Neighbor Matching (Nearest hereafter),
which matches each treatment
sample with the
control sample such that the difference of the two is
minimized. That is,

CðPiÞ ¼ min

j

jPi   Pjj;

where C(Pi) is a set of control units matched with
the treated unit i, i.e., samples that has the nearest
propensity score with CSR ﬁrm i.

The second criterion is

the caliper matching
(Caliper hereafter), which requires the two groups to
be not too distant. That is, it requires the propensity
score of the CSR-ﬁrm and NonCSR-ﬁrm to fall
within a prespeciﬁed caliper. That is,
CðPiÞ ¼ jPi   Pjj< g

where g is a very small number and is speciﬁed as
quarter of standard error of estimated propensity
scores for all CSR-ﬁrms and NonCSR-ﬁrms. Note
that under this criterion, the number of control
samples contained in C(Pi) is arbitrary, from zero
to all control samples.

Conventional matching methods
Besides minimizing the differences of
the two
propensity scores, we also directly compare the char-
acteristic variables between CSR-ﬁrm and Non-
CSR-ﬁrm. Thus, the third criterion is Mahalanobis
Metric Matching (Mahala hereafter), which is
 1ðXi   XjÞ

dði; jÞ ¼ ðXi   XjÞ0

V

where d(i, j) is the Mahalanobis distance between
treated ﬁrm i and control ﬁrm j, and Xi and Xj
respective k 1 vectors of observed
are their
characteristic variables, where k is the number of
characteristic variables and V is k  k variance–
covariance matrix of observed characteristics. For
any given treated ﬁrm i, we choose the control ﬁrm j
which gives the smallest d.11

The fourth criterion is Mahalanobis Metric
Matching with Caliper (Mahala Caliper hereafter), it
matches each treated sample to the control samples
with Mahalanobis distance smaller than a prespeci-
is, when d(i,j) < g, where g is
ﬁed caliper,
deﬁned above.

Veriﬁcation of matching results

Once the matching NonCSR-ﬁrms are selected, we
could verify the matching by performing the follow-
ing two tests: The ﬁrst one examines
the null
hypothesis of H0 : ð X i   X jÞ ¼ 0; where X i and X j
are average of characteristic variables of treated ﬁrm i
and control ﬁrm j, respectively. The two groups have
the same characteristics if the null is not rejected,

The second veriﬁcation is to calculate

ð X iB   X jBÞ   ð X iA   X jAÞ

ð X iB   X jBÞ

 100

where X iB and X jB are average of characteristic vari-
ables of treated and control sample before matching,
respectively and X iA and X jA are average of charac-
teristic variables of treated and control sample after
matching, respectively. This measure calculates the
percentage change from before-matching to after-
matching for a given characteristic variable. For each
matching criteria, the larger the average percentage
changes, the better the matching.12

Econometric model

Propensity scoring matching

As we have mentioned, the ﬁrst step in adopting
PSM is to estimate the propensity scores by using
Probit model, which is

PrðDCSR ¼ 1Þ ¼ Fðb0

XÞ

ð2Þ

where DCSR is a dummy variable which is equal
to 1 if it is a CSR-ﬁrm, and 0 otherwise, F(Æ) is
the cumulative probability density function of nor-
mal distribution, b is a vector of marginal impact
coefﬁcients and X is the vector of characteristic
variables.

Our characteristic variables can be categorized
into three groups. The ﬁrst group is related to the
scale factor, containing ASSET (the total asset) and
SALES (the net sales);
the second group is the
income factor, containing EBIT (the earnings before
interest and tax) and OPERAINC (the operation
income) and the last group is the management factor,
containing TURNOVER (the asset turnover) and
CURRENT (current ratio). Note that Dehejia and
Wahba (2002) have stressed that the role of pro-
pensity score is only to reduce the dimensions of the
conditioning; as such, it has no behavioral assump-
tions attached to it. Thus, while these variables are
close to the determinant of being selected as CSR-
ﬁrms, the main focus is that they serve as the basic
characteristic of two groups of ﬁrms. The reason of
choosing these variables and their expected signs are
explained as follows.

Scale: Dierkes and Coppock (1978), Trotman and
Bradley (1981), Fombrun and Shanley (1990)
pointed out that the larger the scale, the more the
attention that a company attracts from the public.
Thus, the response from its philanthropic activities is
noticeable. Thus, scale is often considered as a cru-
cial characteristic variable and its effect on the
probability of adopting CSR is positive.

Income: McGuire et al. (1988) and Moore (2001)
proposed the available funds theory to argue that
ﬁrms with abundant resources have more ability to
engage in CSR activities. Posner and Schmidt
(1992) and Alkhafaji (1989), on the contrary, prove
that ﬁrms with earn sufﬁcient proﬁts could have
egocentric behaviors without fear of being challenged

for not noticing the interests of the public. Income
is also the important characteristic variable and its
effect is uncertain.

Management: Pava and Krausz (1996), Preston
and O’Bannon (1997), Stanwick and Stanwick
(1998) argued that the ﬁrms with well-functioning
administration system and management ability are
prone to take more care of the beneﬁts of their
stakeholders in order to maintain their competitive
advantage. Thus, management ability is also an
observed characteristic of a ﬁrm in its decision to
become a CSR- or NonCSR-ﬁrm. The effect is
expected to be positive.

Once we obtain the estimated propensity score
Pr(Di = 1|Xi) for all CSR-ﬁrms and NonCSR-
ﬁrms,13 which are denoted as Pi and Pj, respectively,
our objective to ﬁnd the NonCSR-ﬁrms whose
propensity scores are ‘‘sufﬁciently’’ close to those of
the CSR-ﬁrms.

Two approaches to estimate the treatment effects

Two approaches are implemented to determinate
whether adopting CSR activities affect the perfor-
mance of ﬁrms. The ﬁrst one is the basic statistical
method, which computes the mean differences of
ﬁnancial performances between two pairs of groups,
i.e., the pair of the treatment and controlled samples
before- and after- matching, respectively. Boot-
strapping methods (1000 times) are used to establish
conﬁdence intervals to determine signiﬁcance for
the above differences.

The second approach employs

the regression
analysis with a CSR dummy variable to examine the
differences of ﬁnancial performances between two
groups of ﬁrms. The regression model is
PERFORMANCE ¼ a þ bASSET þ kDCSR þ e
ð3Þ

where PERFORMANCE is the ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, ASSET is the total asset of a ﬁrm in order to
remove the third factor inﬂuence, a, k and b are
coefﬁcients to be estimated, and e is error term. Esti-
mated k captures the effect on ﬁrm performance of
being philanthropic. A signiﬁcant positive k suggests
that CSR-ﬁrms have better ﬁnancial performance
than NonCSR-ﬁrms, supporting the social
impact

hypothesis, whereas a signiﬁcant negative k supports
theshift of focus hypothesis.

Our performance measures are: return on assets
(ROA), return on equity (ROE), pretax income to
net sales (RPTI), gross proﬁt to net sales (RGM) and
earnings per share (EPS).14 Table I presents
the
deﬁnitions and source of six characteristic and ﬁve
ﬁnancial performance variables.

reports basic statistics of
the characteristic and
performance variables. Based on samples before the
matching, CSR-ﬁrms tend to have larger ASSET
and SALE, higher EBIT, OPERAINC and
TURNOVER but
For
instance, the average ASSET and EBIT of CSR- and
before-matching NonCSR-ﬁrms are (97.696, 6.477)
and (16.109, 0.728) billion NTD,
respectively;
but they are 182.01 and 209.96 for the CURRENT,
respectively. With respect
to the performance
variables,
the average ROA of CSR-ﬁrms and
before-matching NonCSR-ﬁrms are 6.6848% and
4.5026%, respectively and the average EPS for the
two groups are 1.61 and 0.9014, respectively. The
results from basic statistics suggest that CSR-ﬁrms
perform better
than before-matching NonCSR-
ﬁrms.

Table III reports correlation matrix of character-
istic and performance variables and dummy variable
of being CSR-ﬁrms, which equal to one if given
sample is belong to CSR-ﬁrm and equal to zero if
otherwise. From the ﬁrst column we observe that,
ﬁrst, the correlation coefﬁcient between CSR and
ASSET and EBIT are 0.2877 and 0.2052, respec-
tively; for CURRENT, coefﬁcient is relatively low,
)0.0227. Thus, CSR-ﬁrms tend to have larger scale
and higher level of income than NonCSR-ﬁrms.
Second, the correlation coefﬁcients between CSR
and each performance variable are all slightly posi-
tive,
the correlation coefﬁcients
between CSR and ROA, between CSR and ROE
are 0.0467 and 0.0206, respectively.

characteristic

Although one tends to conclude that CSR-ﬁrms
slightly outperform NonCSR-ﬁrms using before
matching data, we observe that there is also sys-
tematic
variables
between two groups of ﬁrms, at least on average. We
cannot attribute performance difference purely to
ﬁrms’ engaging to philanthropic activities and have
to ﬁx the differences in characteristics and get purer
identiﬁable effect on performance of being CSR-
ﬁrms,
that’s the performance difference between
CSR- and NonCSR-ﬁrms at least not duo to dif-
ference in characteristics between them.

Basic statistics after matching

Table IV presents the estimated results of propensity
score function (PSF) by Probit model.15 We employ
two speciﬁcations to examine the robustness. For
Model I, contemporary characteristic variables are
used to estimate PSF, and we observe that coefﬁ-
cients for ASSET, SALES, and TURNOVER are
signiﬁcantly positive, suggesting that ﬁrms with large
asset, sales and high asset turnover tend to engage in
more CSR. The coefﬁcients for EBIT, OPERAINC,
and CURRENT are negative but insigniﬁcantly
negative. Although the high correlation coefﬁcient
between each two characteristic variables, as we
discussed earlier,
the model of
choosing determinants of CSR, but is to reduce the
dimensions.

the PSM is not

We use model I as our benchmark model to
estimate propensity score function, that’s the timing
of explanatory variables are all contemporaneous.

One may concern that whether lagged characteristics
affect the probability of being classiﬁed as CSR-ﬁrm,
for example, a ﬁrms with large earnings this period
could engage more in CSR activities in the next
period because they have more available funds,
suggested by McGuire et al.
(1988) and Moore
(2001). Thus, we also consider lagged income factor,
EBITt)1, and OPERAINCt)1 as explanatory vari-
ables to replace contemporary EBIT and OPERA-
INC to establish model II. Since the estimated results
of PSF as roughly the same with results of model I,
we leave it in latter part of the article.

Based on estimation results of PSF by model I, we
obtain propensity score for each sample of ﬁrm.
Thus, we can select the samples based on the four
matching methods, Nearest, Caliper, Mahala and
Mahala Caliper.

the averages of

Table V compares

the means of characteristic
variables between two groups based on before- and
after-matching samples. Unlike those in Table II
where the whole sample of CSR-ﬁrms and Non-
CSR-ﬁrms are used in Table II, we only employ
matched samples here. It is not surprising that, after
matching,
two pairs become
approximately equal. The Caliper and Mahala Cal-
iper, are the most successful in matching our sample.
In order to illustrate this, six characteristic variables
between CSR- and after-matching NonCSR-ﬁrms
become approximately equal because the differences
in their means are insigniﬁcant. Using Nearest
matching method, signiﬁcant differences exist
in
CURRENT, but not in the remaining ﬁve vari-
ables. When Mahala matching is employed, similar
results are obtained. As mentioned earlier,
the
comparison of performance is meaningful only when
the characteristic variables are close to each other.
Accordingly, the Caliper and the Mahala Caliper
methods provide a more reliable matching than
those of the Nearest and Mahala methods.

Table VI presents percentage changes of the gaps
of the characteristic variables between CSR-ﬁrms
and NonCSR-ﬁrms before and after matching. The
deviation of whole NonCSR-ﬁrms from matched
NonCSR-ﬁrms helps us to evaluate the outcome of
the matching methods. The large percentage change
suggests the success of the matching, and therefore,
the use of the whole sample is biased. Two inter-
esting results can be highlighted as follows. First, the
Mahala and Mahala Caliper are expected to be better

two matching algorithms because the average per-
centage changes of the two groups are the largest,
70.4 % and 97.5%, respectively. The conclusion is
slightly differs from the results obtained in Table V,
where the Caliper and Mahala Caliper methods
provide more successful matching.

freedom is

It is worth noting that the superior matching
results are not without costs. For example,
the
degree of
substantially reduced from
2,480 to 7 when Mahala Caliper method is adopted.
Next, the Nearest and Caliper methods are slightly
less reliable because of their lower average percent-
age changes, which are 54.3% and 65.1% respec-
tively. Although their percentage changes
are
smaller, they do not lose as many observations as
Mahala Caliper method and still retain 80 and 78,
respectively. Therefore, there might be a trade-off
between the closeness in matching and the losses in
the degrees of freedom. Mahala Caliper produces a
better selection of the NonCSR-ﬁrms but it loses a
lot of observations; by contrast, Nearest, Caliper and
Mahala produces a slightly worse selection but
maintain a lots more observations. Since no method
is overwhelmingly superior to the others, we report
the regression results using all four methods.

Performance comparisons

the differences

Table VII presents
in means of
ﬁnancial performances between CSR- and Non-
CSR-ﬁrms, based on before- and after-matching
samples. Before matching, the signiﬁcantly differ-
ences are exist in ROA and EPS, where the average
ROA and EPS of CSR-ﬁrms are higher
than
NonCSR-ﬁrms by 2.16% and 0.7, respectively.

The after matching comparisons are reported
from the third to sixth columns in Table VII. First,
original signiﬁcantly superiority of ROA and EPS
for CSR-ﬁrms disappear. Second, under
the
matching methods of Nearest, RGM of CSR-ﬁrms
are signiﬁcantly higher
than NonCSR-ﬁrms by
8.653% and others performance variables are insig-
niﬁcantly different from them. Similar results are
obtained under Mahala and Mahala Caliper match-
ing. Third, when Caliper is used, the performance of
CSR- and NonCSR-ﬁrms is regardless of which
performance variable is used.

regression analysis (3) by adding the control variable,

DCSR are all positive but insigniﬁcantly regardless of

variable. Thus, before matching, one may conclude
that adopting CSR at least not worsen the ﬁnancial
performance of a ﬁrm.

The results changed when the after matching
samples are used (reported in Panels B to E). First,
when Nearest is used and when performance vari-
ables are RPTI and RGM, the estimated coefﬁcient

of DCSR are signiﬁcantly positive with 4.813 and
8.325, respectively. It implies that CSR-ﬁrms have
higher pretax income to net sales and gross margin.
Similar results are obtained when the method of

achieved through kindly conscious. The preach of
CSR advocates that companies cannot count only
on ﬁnancial performance to survive in this ever-
changing scenario of global competition, but also
need to take responsibilities to the various stake-
holders
in which and where they exist. These
established practices are prevalent in modern busi-
ness environment, and based on our empirical
results, taking CSR and maximizing proﬁts are not
conﬂicting goals.

With the extension of business operations in the
international realm, multinational businesses – orig-
inally perceived as merely face intense economic
competition – recognize that they have to view
CSR as a signiﬁcant issue. Taiwan is a country that
relies on trade and its companies are investing

exporting overseas. As companies in Taiwan become
more international, the impressions and inﬂuence of
the ﬁrms abroad on foreign employment opportu-
nities, employers, and suppliers is growing steadily.
Therefore, as a member of
the global village,
Taiwanese ﬁrms need an international outlook and
CSR should become a part of its corporate ideals.
This business model will help to build the business
reputational capitals that Taiwanese ﬁrms are good
corporate citizens. Many Taiwanese ﬁrms in China,
which exist huge gap between the rich and the poor
in recent year, has led to violent incidents and a
backlash against capitalism. Taiwanese ﬁrms also
have rooms to give something back to society to
lessen the sense of relative deprivation of
their
workers and local residents. Our CSR-ﬁrms are

in CSR activities, and the positive
rewards to these companies conﬁrms the words,
‘‘doing well by doing good,’’ and it pays to take
social responsibility for corporate sustainability.

Our empirical results are consistent with Cochran
and Wood (1984), McGuire et al. (1988), Waddock
and Graves (1997) and Tsoutsourz (2004) etc. All of
them ﬁnd positive association between the degree of
taking CSR and accounting performance measures
of ﬁrms. Our results are not in accordance with
Vance (1975), Newgren et al. (1985), Brooks and
Pavelin (2005a) and Anginer et al. (2008), which
present outcomes of negative relationship between
CSR and market performance measures. This article
contribute to the introduction of matching methods
in standard medical and biological research and
consideration of ‘‘other things being equal’’ in ana-
lyzing performance difference between CSR- and
NonCSR-ﬁrms, and thus reduce selection bias from
nonrandom sampling in the existing literature. This
research is also parallel
to more scientiﬁc causal
inference in program evaluation and policy impact
analysis, such as Heckman et al. (1998).

Conclusion

and NonCSR-ﬁrms

This article examines the effect of corporate social
responsibility on ﬁnancial performance by using
CSR-
in Taiwan. Two
hypotheses, social
impact hypothesis and shift of
focus hypothesis, are raised, where the former sug-
gests that CSR has positive relation with the ﬁrms’
performance and the latter are opposite. We adopt
matching theory to ﬁx the characteristics of ﬁrms in
two groups so as to remove the selection bias due to
nonrandom assignment of samples. Four matching
methods, Nearest, Caliper, Mahala and Mahala
Caliper are used.

Before matching, the simple t-statistics show that
CSR-ﬁrms outperform NonCSR-ﬁrms in return on
asset and earnings per share, but are equally same for
return on equity, pretax income to net sales, and
gross proﬁt to net sales.

As for our regression analysis results on samples
before matching, using Nearest and Caliper, RPTI
and RGM are signiﬁcantly higher for CSR-ﬁrms.
Under Mahala matching, CSR-ﬁrms signiﬁcantly

outperform NonCSR-ﬁrms in RGM. Most of the
estimated coefﬁcients for CSR dummy are positive
regardless of which matching methods are used. This
trend of outperformance of CSR-ﬁrms is unchanged
as we consider alternative model speciﬁcation of
estimating PSF for
checks. Thus,
although the estimated results are slightly mixed, at
the very least, adopting CSR not deteriorate the
performance of ﬁrms, making our conclusion favors
the social
focus
hypothesis in Taiwan. Thus, corporate ambition and
conscience are not conﬂicting with each other,
taking CSR gets more gains than pains.

impact hypothesis and against shift of

robustness

Future research could proceed in following
directions. First, our study ﬁnds that some methods
provide more close matching but lose the sample size
(the efﬁciency), such as Mahala Caliper; in contrast,
some methods are just the opposite, they provide less
satisfactory matching but retain larger sample size,
such as Nearest, Caliper and Mahala. Thus, using the
matching theory often reduces the samples, making
the estimation less efﬁciency. Further study using
matching theory should take longer period of data or
larger samples if possible. Second, CSR topics are
also important for ﬁnancial industry, it is of interest
to know whether CSR bank produce better results
in Islamic banking (Iqbal and Molyneux, 2005;
Lewis and Algaud, 2001).

Notes

1 According to World Business Council for Sustain-
able Development (WBCSD), CSR is deﬁned as ‘‘the
continuing commitment by business to contribute to
economic development while improving the quality of
life of the workforce and their families as well as of the
community and society at
large.’’ While there exist
other deﬁnitions of CSR,
such as
they are similar,
Frooman (1997), Carroll (1999) and McWilliams and
Siegel (2001).

2 For example,

IBM mobilizes 40,000 employees
willing to do volunteer work to bring technology into
communities. In Los Angeles, Dreamworks jointly orga-
nizes classes with local community colleges and high
schools to provide low-income kids with knowledge
that may help them get into the entertainment industry.
3 Other example such as Chang Yung-fa, chairman
of the Evergreen Group, pledged 2 billion NTD to buy
the KMT building for a foundation that will devote to

international charity work. The Shin Kong Group has
contributed money to support abused children, and
Taiwan Mobile has provided aid to the victims of natu-
ral disasters, while UMC and the Hon Hai Group have
provided a ‘‘children’s aid plan’’ to beneﬁt disadvan-
taged children.

4 Three types of ﬁnancial performance are found in
the empirical studies between CSR and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. The performance measures of ﬁrst kind of study
is accounting-based,
like ROA, ROE (Aigner, 2006;
Dam, 2006; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Guenster et al.,
2005; Nelling and Webb, 2006; Orlitzky et al., 2003).
The second is market-based, using measures like stock
returns
(Anderson and Smith, 2006; Brammer et al.,
2005a, b; Guerard, 1997a, b; Hamilton et al., 1993).
The third method relates to event studies about
the
impact on short-run stock returns
from emersion of
engagement or contravention of CSR activities (Bram-
mer et al., 2005b; Becchetti et al., 2007; Posnikoff,
1997; Teoh et al., 1999; Wright and Ferris, 1997).

5 KLD assessed the performance of multi-dimension

stakeholders’ concerns among S&P 500 companies.

6 While there are numerous data of corporate social
performance of ﬁrms around the world,
like KLD,
FTSE4Good indices, Dow Jones Sustainability Group
Index etc., their evaluation do not consider full TSE-
listing companies in Taiwan.

7 For example, Fortune magazine has been publishing
the results of an annual survey of company reputations
since 1983 by asking thousands of senior executives,
directors and securities analysts who responded to the
survey to rate the ten largest companies in their indus-
tries on eight attributes of reputation, using a scale of
zero (poor) to ten (excellent). The attributes were qual-
ity of management; quality of products or
services;
innovativeness;
long-term investment value; ﬁnancial
soundness; ability to attract, develop, and keep talented
people; responsibility to the community and the envi-
ronment; and wise use of corporate assets. The score
of a company is the mean of the ratings on the right
attributes. Surveys were published in January during
1983–1990, February during 1991–1994 and March
during 1995–2006. Anderson and Smith (2006) and
Antunovich et al. (2000) found that stocks of companies
ranked high by Fortune had higher subsequent returns
than stocks that ranked low. But Shefrin and Statman
(2003) found conﬂicting results.

8 Chih et al. (2007) apply FTSE4GOOD index to
study the relationship between the earnings management
and CSR and get positive association. Waddock and
Graves (1997), Tsoutsoura (2004) use KLD to study the
performance between CSR and ﬁnancial performance.

(strong ignorability of the treatment) are sufﬁcient to
identify the treatment effect.
10 Vega and Winkelried (2005) have pointed out that
the estimation requires choosing a set of conditioning
variable X that are not inﬂuenced by the adoption of
the CSR regime. For this reason, the X is the measure
of ﬁrm attributes before the treatment.
11 For example, if there are 10 treated ﬁrms and 20
control ﬁrms, we have to compute 200 Mahalanobis
distance.
12

If the numbers of after-matching control samples
are very few, then there are trade-off between perfor-
mance of matching and degree of freedom of samples.
However, it is arrearage for the existing literature.
13 Vega and Winkelried (2005) have pointed out that
the estimation requires choosing a set of conditioning
variableX that are not inﬂuenced by the adoption of the
CSR regime. For this reason, the X is the measure of
ﬁrm attributes before the treatment.
14 Literature using accounting ﬁnancial ratios can be
found in Grifﬁn and Mahon (1997), Orlitzky et al.
(2003), Guenster et al. (2005), Aigner (2006), Nelling
and Webb (2006), Dam (2006). Alternatively, literature
using stock market performance includes Hamilton et
al. (1993), Guerard (1997a, b), Brammer et al. (2005a,
b), Anderson and Smith (2006).
15 We get similar results when PSF is estimated by
Logit model.
16 We use pooled estimation without considering
ﬁxed and random effect.
