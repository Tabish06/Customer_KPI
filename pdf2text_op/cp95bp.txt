Participation and Productiviy: 
A Comparison of Worker 
Cooperatives and Conventional 
Firms in the Plywood Industry 

A PERENNIAL ISSUE in the study of organizational behavior is the impact 
on productivity of participation by workers in a firm's decisionmaking. 
The question has returned to the foreground in the recent debate over 
policies  to  increase U.S.  productivity growth.' A  large literature is 
aimed at quantifying the impact of worker participation on productivity 
though the results from this research fall somewhat short of being fully 
persuasive.2 There are several difficulties in this research, not least that 
worker participation can mean various things in different contexts. 

At one extreme, workers may be consulted on a narrow range of 
issues, and the consultations may be designed more to give the appear- 

1.  The  1994 Economic  Report of the President  states that "the  Administration  aims 
to increase the productivity of the work force by helping employers make better use of 
their workers through increased worker participation. Numerous studies have now dem- 
onstrated that cooperative techniques increase productivity substantially in a wide range 
of  enterprises. By  helping to disseminate information on what successful firms have 
been able to accomplish, the Administration hopes to speed the adoption of these prac- 
tices throughout the economy" (p.  128). 

2.  Levine and Tyson (1990, p. 203) provide a comprehensive review of the literature. 
Even with a sympathetic reading of the evidence in favor of the hypothesis that partici- 
pation enhances productivity, the authors conclude merely that, "Our overall assessment 
of the empirical literature from economics, industrial relations, organizational behavior, 
and other social sciences is that participation usually leads to small, short-run improve- 
ments in performance and sometimes leads to significant, long-lasting improvements in 
performance" (emphasis in original).

ance of  involving workers in decisionmaking than to  grant workers 
effective influence. The other extreme occurs when workers have full 
discretionary powers and both own and manage the enterprise they work 
in. If productivity impacts of participation are not visible when workers 
are the firm's owners, they are less likely when workers participate to 
a much smaller extent. Therefore, this paper addresses the question of 
whether productivity differences are evident between conventional 
firms and worker cooperatives, which are firms owned and managed by 
their workers. 

This is by no means the first investigation of productivity differences 
between conventional firms and worker co-ops though ours is unusual 
in  a  number of  respects. Most research lacks observations on  both 
conventional firms and co-ops in the same product market environment. 
As Bonin, Jones, and Putterman observe, "To examine productivity 
differences between PCs [producer cooperatives] and CFs [conventional 
firms], the comparison should be made between firms that are 'twins' 
in  all  nonorganizational respects, e.g.,  in  terms of  technology, the 
product generated,  and market conditions.  However,  identifying 
'twins'  (isolation) is  often  impossible because the existing data on 
product type and technology are not sufficiently disaggregated. Firm- 
level data that applies consistent accounting conventions to both PCs 
and CFs in the same industry are rare."3 Nevertheless, the observations 
we have collected satisfy these stringent requirements. 

They are longitudinal data on plywood mills in Washington state. 
The observations (collected by the authors) are at the level of the pro- 
ducing unit, the measurement of inputs and outputs is on a consistent 
basis, and the technology mapping inputs into outputs is virtually iden- 
tical across the firms. It is not the case that all the co-ops are the same, 
and we shall mention below some differences among them. However, 
they share the important characteristic that virtually all the firm's own- 
ers are workers in the firm, and most workers are owners. By contrast, 
the workers in the conventional firms in our sample are employees. 

The conventional mills are individual proprietorships or partnerships 
or parts of a corporation. The workers at some of these mills are union- 
ized, while those at other mills, which we label "classical,"  are not. 
Most of the plywood produced in the Pacific Northwest comes from the

unionized mills.  In our work, we  not only  distinguish co-ops  from 
conventional firms, but also discriminate between unionized mills and 
classical mills and thereby contribute to the literature on union-nonu- 
nion differences in productivity. 

The principal goal of the research reported in this paper is to deter- 
mine whether, for given levels of observed inputs, the worker-owned 
plywood mills as a group produce more or less output than do conven- 
tional firms. We take it as a truism that, if every input were observed 
and observed without error, then at specified levels of these inputs each 
firm should produce the same level of output as every other. However, 
whenever economists estimate production functions, every input is not 
observed. Not merely are the conscientiousness, vigor, initiative, and 
other attributes of workers (including managers) not measured, but the 
information normally available on physical capital and raw materials 
omits details regarding the great variety of the plant and equipment and 
the frequently varying quality of  the raw material. Therefore, after 
accounting for observed differences in worker-hours, the quantities of 
raw materials, and indicators of  physical capital, we shall be asking 
whether there is a distinct difference in the amount of output produced 
by mills owned and managed by their workers. 

There is a long-standing interest in knowing whether worker-owned 
and worker-managed enterprises are more productive organizations than 
conventional firms. The belief that they are lies behind some sugges- 
tions that worker-owned firms serve as the vehicles for divestiture of 
state-owned properties in East Europe. But many of these suggestions 
rest more on speculation about the operation of  worker-owned firms 
than on familiar knowledge of  their functioning. Using  information 
from the U.S.  manufacturing industry where cooperative enterprises 
are the most common, we examine the comparative behavior of co-ops 
and conventional firms to inform the discussion on the relative produc- 
tivity of worker-management. 

Productivity, Capital Markets, and Worker-Owned Enterprises 

Before investigating productivity in the plywood industry, we con- 
sider the principal reasons why worker-owned and worker-managed 


124 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

firms might operate more efficiently and why other factors might frus- 
trate the exploitation of this advantage. 

Productivity  and  Worker-Owned Enterprises 

A study of worker cooperatives cannot distinguish between two types 
of argument regarding productivity and features of industrial relations 
systems. One class of argument concerns the relationship between pro- 
ductivity and the mechanism by which workers are compensated. The 
hypothesis here is that there are productivity gains from relating work- 
ers' pay to their output or to a firm's sales or to profits instead of to the 
workers' input of  time.  The second class  of  argument concerns the 
locus of decisionmaking and contends that a firm's productivity would 
be higher if workers participated more in various enterprise decisions.4 
Analytically, the difference between the productivity effects from 
instituting incentive-type compensation schemes and the productivity 
effects  from increased involvement by workers in decisionmaking is 
quite distinct. In practice, group pay incentive schemes tend more often 
to be found where workers have a role in decisionmaking or where 
some consultative mechanisms are in place to garner workers' sugges- 
tions. For instance, the frequently lauded Japanese industrial relations 
system is  characterized (at least in  the larger firms) by both profit- 
related bonus payments and greater use of consultation and consensus 
building. Similarly, in the worker cooperatives studied here, the work- 
ers both share net revenues and are intimately involved in the manage- 
ment of their enterprises, so there is no opportunity to distinguish the 
effects on productivity of group pay compensation schemes from those 
of worker participation in decisionmaking. 

There are several reasons why  worker co-ops  may operate more 
productively than corporate firms. First, a co-op mitigates the agency 
costs associated with a corporation's division between ownership and 
control. Worker-owners are likely to be much better informed about 

4.  A clear statement of this notion is provided by Slichter (1968, p. 575): "The very 
fact that the workers have had an opportunity to participate in determining their working 
conditions is in itself favorable to efficiency. .  .  .  [E]fficiency depends upon consent. 
Even though the specific rules and policies adopted in particular instances may not be 
ideal, the process of joint determination of working conditions at least offers the possi- 
bility of achieving greater efficiency than could be obtained under rules and conditions 
dictated by one side."

actions taken by managers than are nonworker-owners. Indeed, in the 
plywood co-ops studied below, managers have sometimes complained 
of what they regard as excessive involvement by the workers in day- 
to-day managerial decisions.5 The workers view their behavior more 
constructively. 

Second, worker ownership eliminates the separation of interests be- 
tween workers and owners. There are occasions in which a conventional 
firm is presented with a choice of actions that can enhance the welfare 
of owners only at the expense of workers. This naturally pits one party 
against the other and may result in bargaining costs.  Or a worker in a 
conventional firm may have better information about work effort or the 
organization of production at the shop floor level, but he may be hesitant 
to reveal that information because management might use it to further 
their interests or the owners' interests at the expense of the worker. In 
the presence of such asymmetrical information, a worker co-op offers 
the opportunity of productivity gains from eliminating the division of 
interests between owners and workers.6 

Third, workers may be  able to  monitor each other's effort more 
effectively than in firms where the monitor is the owner's agent.7 In 

5.  Greenberg (1986) quotes the general manager of a mill that had been converted 
from a worker co-op to a privately owned firm as remarking, "It sure as hell is easier 
now. Before I had 250 bosses .  .  . everyone wanted to put his two cents in. Now I just 
answer to one  man.  .  .  . I like  it better that way"  (p.  44). 

6.  Greenberg's (1986)  survey of  production practices at conventional and co-op 
plywood mills is consistent with this argument: "worker-shareholders are much more 
likely to cooperate on production problems than are workers in a conventional plant. 
Indeed, there is a very strong tendency among the latter to stick to one's assigned job 
and not to meddle in what is considered the business of other workers or the responsibility 
of some other production unit in the plant. The boundaries of work responsibility are 
clearly drawn; workers in conventional plants are willing to put in a hard day's work on 
their assigned tasks, but they are not likely to move beyond those boundaries and act in 
ways that will enhance the productivity of the entire process. In the cooperatives, the 
job boundaries are less rigid and more fluid when, in the opinion of the people involved 
in production, the situation demands it" (p. 41). 

7.  Whenever there are opportunities and incentives for workers to shirk, efficient 
production requires their work behavior to be monitored. Alchian and Demsetz (1972) 
argued that such moral hazard problems are larger when profits are shared among many 
individuals. In their view, cooperatives are more likely to be found in situations where 
these shirking problems are offset by inherent difficulties of  measuring work effort. 
"While it is relatively easy to manage or direct the loading of trucks by a team of dock 
workers where input activity is so highly related in an obvious way to output, it is more 
difficult to manage and direct a lawyer in the preparation and presentation of a case" 


126

fact, there is direct evidence of this in the plywood mills where co-ops 
usually operate with  many fewer  supervisors than in conventional 
firms .8 

Fourth, firms applying some method of incentive pay such as profit- 
sharing may attract workers whose ability or work effort is unusually 
high. These incentives may appear small insofar as a single worker 
contributes little to the firm's net revenues. On the other hand, a co- 
operative outcome in which all workers are motivated to work hard 
results in every member of the firm being better off. This self-selection 
argument applies, of course, in an economy consisting of a mixture of 
co-ops and conventional firms. No selectivity process can operate when 
all firms are co-ops. 

Finance  and  Worker-Owned Enterprises 

These productivity arguments may not be correct or of little conse- 
quence, and it is the goal of this paper to quantify their overall relevance 
in the largest and most durable sector of  worker ownership in U. S. 
manufacturing. But if these arguments are correct, why are worker co- 
ops unusual in market economies? There are two primary explanations. 
The first is that they are inherently risky institutions: workers have 
tied to the fortunes of the enterprise not only their labor incomes but 
also their capital. The purchase of a share in a plywood co-op involves 
the investment of  much, if  not all,  of  a worker's wealth.9 Far from 
diversifying his wealth, the worker concentrates his wealth into one 
form, the performance of his company. When the same worker is em- 
ployed in a conventional mill, he has the option of investing his capital 
in an asset whose returns are uncorrelated with movements in his labor 
income. The desire of workers to spread their risks is testified by the 

(p. 786). The argument is attractive, though the plywood co-ops do not conform to it: 
work performance in a plywood mill is relatively straightforward to monitor. In the case 
of the plywood co-ops, the answer to Alchian and Demsetz's question of  "who will 
monitor the monitor?" is the workers; the workers monitor each other. 

8.  Greenberg's (1986) survey of  plywood mills suggested that conventional mills 
tended to use six or seven supervisors per shift, while co-ops operated with one or two. 
In one instance, upon conversion from a co-op to a conventional mill, the number of 
supervisors was increased fourfold (pp. 43-44). 

9.  In the 1980s, the shares of several mills were advertised at prices of over $80,000. 
Naturally, these were the most profitable mills, and at others the prices were very much 
lower. See Craig and Pencavel (1992) for an analysis of these share prices.

fact that, when they were permitted to do so, labor unions chose not to 
concentrate their pension funds in investments in the companies where 
the union members worked. 

The second reason is associated with the costs of supplying capital. 
The wealth limitations of workers constrain the amount of capital that 
can be raised from workers themselves, so they are obliged to turn to 
banks and other credit institutions for loans. These organizations- 
regardless of whether the borrower is a co-op or a conventional firm- 
are sensitive to the risks of opportunistic behavior when their loans are 
used to purchase specific capital assets. To mitigate the risk of being 
"held-up,"  the lending institutions will  demand some collateral or 
insist that their agents be a party to the firm's critical decisions. 

For a worker co-op, the former presents the workers with the same 
credit problems that induced them to turn to banks in the first place, 
while the latter compromises the principle of  workers being the sole 
owners of their enterprise. Conventional firms, by contrast, when per- 
mitted by law, often admit to their Board of Directors the representa- 
tives of their principal creditors. In some cases, of course, the financial 
institutions end up as owners of the firms to whom they have extended 
loans, a classical vertical integration response to the potential problems 
of postcontractual opportunism. 10 

The Plywood  Co-ops'  Sources  of Capital 

The experiences of  the plywood co-ops  in the Pacific Northwest 
testify to the relevance of these capital market problems. The workers 
have constituted the major source of capital both through the sale of 
shares at the founding of the company and through subsequent loans 
(in  the form,  for example, of  the  sale  of  further stock or deferred 
earnings). Often a co-op was constrained in its attempt to raise capital 
by two factors: first, it attempted to restrict the number of shares to the 
number of workers expected to be employed in the mill; and, second, 
it tried to keep the price of the shares to a level within range of a typical 
working household's wealth. Given these constraints, it is not surpris- 

10.  See,  for instance, Klein, Crawford, and Alchian (1978).  A similar argument 
attributing the infrequency of worker co-ops to their distinctive capital market difficulties 
appears in Bowles and Gintis (1993). 


128 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

ing that, soon after the founding of a co-op venture, it was common for 
the mill to return to its worker-owners for more funds. 

Many of the co-ops have borrowed money from sources other than 
their workers. Short-term borrowing to build up inventories or meet 
transitory contingencies has not been difficult to obtain, but long-term 
financing seems to have been more problematic. Borrowing from banks 
has usually required mills to mortgage their equipment, plant, or in- 
ventory or to impose ceilings on their member-workers' pay. 1I The most 
common source of outside borrowing, however, has been the Federal 
Government's Small Business Administration, such loans being con- 
ditional on the borrower's demonstrated inability to secure capital from 
private sources. 

Co-ops have operated at something of a disadvantage in capital mar- 
kets. The share prices of co-ops have shown a persistent tendency to 
be undervalued. In earlier research, we  found that the prices of  the 
shares of three plywood co-ops tended to be far below the level that 
would have made membership and working in these cooperatives of 
equal monetary return to working in a conventional mill.'2 There are 
several possible explanations for this finding, but we found most plau- 
sible the proposition that the co-ops' activities are impaired by capital 
market considerations. 

11.  Gintis (1990) argues that credit institutions prefer to make loans to enterprises 
effectively controlled by a small number of people whose behavior can be monitored 
and directed easily rather than to an enterprise whose ownership is diffused among the 
entire work force. The plywood co-ops supply evidence of this. In a detailed study of 
the finances of  some co-ops,  Dahl (1957) writes, "The banker must recognize that, 
while  he  may discuss the  [co-op] company's financial problems with the company 
manager, he frequently does not have the final say on what the company is going to do. 
Instead, the Board of Directors [elected by the worker-members] is much more active 
in handling ordinary day-to-day problems of the company, including bank financing, 
than is common with ordinary corporations. This will require that the banker not only 
discuss affairs of the company in the bank with the manager but it is very likely that he 
will have to attend Board meetings to explain the bank's method of financing before the 
company will  give  its  approval. He may even be  requested to  attend stockholders' 
meetings to explain to the entire group of  stockholders the bank's position. . 
.  The 
banker will  recognize a great difference between the Board of  Directors of his bank 
composed of a few bankers and successful businessmen in other lines of business, and 
the board of the plywood company" (pp. 65-66).

The Plywood Industry and Co-ops in the Pacific Northwest 

Plywood is produced by a simple process that did not alter over the 
period of our data. Logs are first soaked in a tank of hot water, then 
placed on a lathe where the veneer is peeled off in long strips, patched, 
and cut  into manageable lengths. The strips are then sorted onto a 
"layup"  machine that glues the veneer together into plywood, often 
using heat. Some mills have no veneer lathe and purchase the veneer 
from other mills for their own layup presses. Other mills have no layup 
capacity and sell veneer. 

Unlike sawmills, where great technical advances have changed the 
production process by computerizing the pattern of cuts and where labor 
spans a wide spectrum of different skills, plywood production remained 
technologically simple throughout our sample period. The only skilled 
workers used by the mill are the electricians, the machine maintenance 
workers, and the wright who designs the layout of the plant. Virtually 
all other workers have skills that are rapidly acquired on the job. How- 
ever, there are opportunities for workers to exhibit superior productivity 
such as in determining the width of  veneer to be cut,  in minimizing 
wastage from the raw material, and in working quickly and accurately. 

The Plywood  Cooperatives 

In 1960, 99 percent of U.S.  production of plywood came from the 
Pacific Northwest (table 1, column 2).  The depletion of  first-growth 
timber lands and environmental restrictions on logging  have since 
moved the locus of production to the South. The plywood cooperatives 
have remained an important part of the industry within the Northwest, 
however. Thus, in 1990, in the state of Washington alone, seven of the 
thirteen plywood mills were cooperatives. Each mill produces a very 
small fraction of total U.S.  production, and it is customary to treat each 
mill as a price-taker in its markets for output and for log inputs. 

Plywood and timber prices are volatile  and have displayed some 
remarkable movements over the past thirty years. 13 Columns 4 and 5 of 
table 1 record the real price of Western plywood and the real price of 

13.  This flatly contradicts Meade's (1972) assertion that a necessary condition for 
cooperative enterprises to thrive is  an industry where "the risk of fluctuations in the 
demand for the product must not be too great" (p. 427).

raw timber, respectively, from 1960. While the real price of plywood 
was lower in the late 1980s than its level 25 years earlier, real log prices 
were very much higher. The declining profitability of the industry in 
the Northwest is evident. 14 

The co-ops are different from one another in many details, so a brief 
description of them masks this heterogeneity. 15 Each member of the co- 
op must own one (and often no more than one) share. Regardless of the 
number of  shares held,  each member has a single vote to select the

(1957); and Gunn (1984).

board of directors who themselves are worker-members of the co-op. 
Turnover of board members is usually high. The by-laws of the com- 
panies specify  annual meetings of  all  stockholders, though special 
stockholder meetings are frequently convened. The general manager is 
hired by the board of directors, and often he is not an owner. 

All the co-ops employ workers who are not members, though these 
have normally constituted a minority of  the workers. Some of  these 
nonmembers are planning to purchase a share when they have accu- 
mulated some wealth and when a share becomes available. Others are

machine maintenance workers or electricians or glue spreaders-all  of 
whom undertake distinctly different work.'6 

The perennial concern of the champions of worker-ownership is that 
co-ops "degenerate" from a pure form in which all workers are owners 
and all owners are workers to a conventional firm in which ownership 
is  concentrated in the hands of  a few  people and most workers are 
employees. Indeed, by purchasing the shares of  departing members, 
the first plywood co-op (established in 1921), Olympia Veneer, steadily 
shed its cooperative character over time so that when the mill was sold 
in the early 1950s only a few of the workers were shareholders. Our 
irregular data on membership-employment ratios suggest a tendency 
toward "degeneration" in the plywood co-ops  since the late  1950s 
although, given the shortcomings of  the data, the inference is  not a 
confident one. 17 

Upon leaving the firm, a co-op member's sale of  stock has to be 
ratified by the board of directors. Usually, to sustain a work force with 
desirable qualities, a new buyer has to work in the co-op for a proba- 
tionary period before the sale is approved (unless the buyer has already 
been working in the mill).  A  shareholder is given preference in em- 
ployment over a nonmember, and worksharing is a common response 
to adversity before layoffs are contemplated. In surveys, members state 
that their principal concern is with their weekly earnings where these 
earnings are related to their input of time, not to their stock ownership. 

The Conventional  Mills 

The unionized mills operate under a contract that embraces most of 
the unionized lumber workers in the Pacific Northwest. Plywood mill 
employees constitute less than 5 percent of the total union membership 
covered by the collective bargaining agreement, which is usually ne- 
gotiated for a two-year period (though one-, three-, and four-year con- 
tracts were also negotiated during our sample period). Once negotiated 
at the regional level, the collective bargaining contract is often modified 

16.  From his survey of the co-op mills, Greenberg (1986) argues that nonmember 
workers are typically well treated: "hired workers are a minority in the cooperatives, 
.  .  . they are a highly diverse group many of whom exercise considerable influence and 
receive considerable benefits, and .  .  . their presence does not substantially damage the 
standing of cooperatives as democratic workplaces" (p. 62).

to fit the circumstances of each mill. Frequently, this amounts to main- 
taining existing wage differentials among mills. Within each mill, wage 
differentials range by a factor of about 2.5 from the lowest to the highest 
paid workers. Though such differentials are narrow by the standards of 
many manufacturing contracts, they are wide by comparison with the 
co-ops where all workers (with only a few exceptions) are paid the same 
hourly wages. 

The few complete contracts available to us from the classical mills 
were written by human resource consultants. The pay differentials by 
job category were broadly based on the union contracts, though with 
fewer categories in the classical mills. 

Births  and Deaths  of  Cooperative  Mills 

As argued at the beginning of this paper, there are necessarily omit- 
ted variables in the production functions we (and others) estimate, and 
this raises questions about the meaning of any unobserved differences 
among the enterprises. The primary concern is whether, in their spatial 
distribution in the Pacific Northwest, the co-op plywood mills are a 
random selection of all firms. The argument against randomness of this 
sort would run as follows: those mills expecting to gain most from 
worker ownership and management are those that are more likely to 
organize in that form, in which case the observed productivity-partici- 
pation relationship tells us more about the explanations for the pattern 
of worker ownership than about the impact of cooperative organization 
on productivity. 

This is potentially a profound problem in interpreting any observed 
correlation between productivity and participation. It suggests not that 
participation has an impact upon productivity, but that those firms of- 
fering superior returns to participation become cooperatives. 18 The sort 
of experiment we would like to conduct is to select randomly a subset 
of all firms, to convert these to cooperative ventures, and then to ob- 
serve the subsequent change in output per input. Because we cannot 
conduct this experiment, we may ask whether the choice of organiza- 

18.  The same type of problem arises in studies restricted to worker cooperatives that 
draw inferences from indicators of the nature of worker participation (such as amount 
of capital loaned per worker). This is recognized in Estrin, Jones, and Svejnar's (1987) 
study of French, British, and Italian cooperatives.

tional form between conventional plywood mills and co-op plywood 
mills in the Pacific Northwest is independent of productivity. 

The record of the formation and demise of particular plywood mills 
suggests a number of factors relevant in accounting for the pattern of 
co-op and conventional organizational form. It is difficult, however, to 
find solid evidence suggesting that an idiosyncratic productivity element 
is an important component of the explanation for the incidence of co- 
operatives. Though the Pacific Northwest has long had a tradition sym- 
pathetic to worker cooperative enterprises, the extension of the co-op 
organization in the plywood industry has much to do with the example 
provided by the Olympia Veneer Company. After some initial adver- 
sity, the mill became extraordinarily profitable and served as the pro- 
totype for subsequent co-ops. 

Most of the co-op mills were set up in the decade after the Second 
World War. Some built their own mills  from scratch, while others 
acquired existing mills from owners who wanted to cease their involve- 
ment in the industry. The organizers were usually groups of individuals 
who planned to work in the mills they established, but there have also 
been a number of  instances in  which individual entrepreneurs have 
provided the organizational impetus for the formation of these mills. 
Typically these entrepreneurs have had little interest in actually working 
in the mills and have sought short-term returns from their ventures. 

When existing plants have been converted to  co-ops,  the private 
owner has sold out because of  low  or negative profits. In these in- 
stances, the co-op often started out with the liability of an old plant or 
depleted raw material supplies. Some of these ventures failed, and the 
mill ultimately ceased production or was sold to private investors. But 
in a number of cases, after years of uncertainty, the worker-owners put 
the mills on new and successful footings. Though some of the co-ops 
converted to conventional firms because of financial difficulties, others 
converted because of  the opportunity of  great financial returns: the 
classic example is provided by the Olympia Veneer Company, which 
sold out to the United States Plywood Corporation in 1954. The evi- 
dence we have garnered does not suggest any material difference be- 
tween the failure rates of conventional and co-op mills. We estimate 
the co-ops'  share of production in the region in the 1968-86  period 
remained between 40 and 50 percent. 

There is  nothing in this account to  suggest that the incidence of 


Ben Craig and John Pencavel 

135 

cooperative plywood mills within the region is influenced by productiv- 
ity factors specific to that type of  organization. The pattern of co-op 
mills  has more to  do  with the initiative and attitudes of  groups of 
working people when presented with opportunities that were not specific 
to one organizational form or the other. None of the co-ops examined 
in this paper was established during the period under study. Therefore, 
even if there were specific advantages to co-op organization at the time 
the co-ops were formed, the advantages are likely to have expired many 
years ago. 

Data Description 

The data we collected derive from a variety of sources. One source, 
the Department of Natural Resources of the state of Washington, col- 
lected information on all plywood mills in the state biennially, so our 
data are available every other year from 1968 to  1986.19 Information 
on the cooperatives was taken from those annual reports to which we 
were granted access.  A  large amount of  material was compiled, but 
much of  it  could not be used because our work required a data set 
consisting of the intersection of the sets of input and output quantities 
and input and output prices.20 The result is  170 observations on  34 
mills: 7 mills are cooperatives, 19 are unionized mills, and 8 are clas- 
sical mills.  For only three mills (one co-op,  one unionized, and one 

19.  The Department of  Natural Resources provided data on output, the inputs of 
logs, species of tree used, and types of machinery. In addition, individual establishments 
submitted employment and compensation information to the Employment Security De- 
partment of  the state. Unions collected records for their individual pension funds on 
hours and earnings, and the national union headquarters made some data available. 
Finally, individual mills and published industry sources filled in some gaps in the data. 
For an analysis of  the accuracy of  our data, see the appendix to Craig and Pencavel 
(1992). 

20.  The data set  used in this paper differs from that used in our article for the 
American Economic Review (Craig and Pencavel, 1992). For the research reported here 
we  required information on  the input of  log  raw materials that was lacking for 27 
observations. This reduces the number of observations from 200 to  173. The data set 
here is smaller than that used in our Journal of Political Economy article (Pencavel and 
Craig, 1994) because we ejected three observations where the values of the raw material 
inputs were distinct outliers. This reduces the number of observations from 173 to 170. 
(The inclusion of these three outliers never had any effect on the point estimates of the 
equations reported below.)

classical) are there observations in each (even-numbered) year, so the 
data set is unbalanced. We calculate that our sample constitutes 49.7 
percent of  all active mills over these years, 37.5  percent of  co-ops, 
67.8  percent of  unionized mills,  and 34.0  percent of classical mills. 
Hence, our inferences below about the population of plywood mills rest 
upon a relatively large sample of firms. 

The decomposition of our observations by type of firm and by pro- 
duction is  provided in  table 2.  Most of  the 36  observations on  the 
cooperatives are on mills that produce only plywood. None of the co- 
ops  specializes in veneer production. By  contrast, two-thirds of  the 
classical mills specialize in the production of  veneer. Evidently, the 
three organizational forms (cooperatives, classical mills, and unionized 
mills) are not equally distributed across the three types of production, 
so care must be taken to ensure that any productivity differences among 
the organizations are not attributable to variations in their production 
type. 

Average values of inputs and output are given in table 3. Output is 
an annual aggregate in square feet of softwood plywood and veneer.2' 
Worker-hours are measured per year and calculated by  forming the 
product of the number of workers and annual hours per worker.22 The 
input of  logs is also measured annually in terms of thousands of feet 
consumed. We collected information on a number of types of machines, 
but we report results in this paper using as a measure of capital input 
the length in feet of the mill's largest lathe. The lathe is the mill's most 
critical machine, and measures of  other machinery inputs are highly 
correlated with lathe size. 

The mills vary little in their production methods, and certainly there 
is no meaningful difference between the co-ops and the conventional 
firms in  the vintage of  machines and technology of  production. As 
Greenberg remarks, "the technical production processes, the compo- 
sition of the machinery, the optimal level of operation of that machin- 
ery, and the division of labor are virtually identical in all the plywood 
plants. Unless one is especially knowledgeable and blessed with a dis-

cerning eye,  one cannot easily tell the difference in the actual produc- 
tion process between cooperative and conventional firms."23 This is 
interesting in view of the argument sometimes voiced that employers 
at conventional firms foist on their employees working conditions that 
the employees resent. In particular, some sociological literature as- 
sumes that worker ownership would reduce, if not eliminate, the alien- 
ation of workers from their production activities. There is absolutely 
no evidence of  this from the plywood cooperatives where "worker- 
shareholders in the cooperatives go about producing plywood in almost 
exactly the same mind- and body-numbing ways as workers in conven- 
tional mills. "24 Indeed, on one measure of worker welfare-the  inci- 
dence of accidents-the  cooperatives are more alienating workplaces: 
"the plywood cooperatives are by far the most dangerous places to 
work in the entire plywood industry.' "25 

According to table 3,  the average output and employment of  the 
cooperatives are similar to those of the unionized mills. The classical 
mills are between one-third and one-half the size of  the other mills. 
The industry has used two primary methods to measure productivity, 
and the values of both of these are listed in table 3. One is output per 
worker-hour, and the other is output per input of logs, the latter some- 
times called  the log  recovery ratio.26 Both of  these  measures have 

23.  Greenberg (1986, p. 40). Greenberg later notes that "the production process in 

cooperative and conventional mills is indistinguishable" (p. 81). 

24.  Ibid., pp. 83-84. 
25.  Ibid., pp. 84-85.  In Greenberg's survey, the mill with the greatest concern for 
safety was a conventional mill. He conjectures that the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) spends less time monitoring the cooperatives under the mistaken 
belief that worker-owned mills will be especially alert to their own safety and, therefore, 
require less regulation. In his own study, Grunberg (1991) suggested that part of the 
"staggering" difference in injuries between cooperatives and conventional mills was 
attributable to the co-ops' greater readiness to report accidents. The state's system for 
compensating workers for their injuries provides incentives for reporting such accidents, 
and the relative absence of supervisors in the co-op mills made it easier for co-op workers 
to claim work-related injuries. However, Grunberg believed that the difference between 
co-op and conventional mills was not entirely a reporting difference and that "safety 
has been a matter of very low priority in the co-operatives" (p.  117). 

26.  It was primarily on the basis of output per worker-hour that in the  1950s the 
cooperatives in the plywood industry were said to be more productive than the conven- 
tional firms. In Grunberg's (1991) more recent survey, output per worker-hour was 
higher among the conventional mills.  Berman and Berman (1989,  p.  290)  compute 
output per worker for the plywood mills in the years 1963, 1967, 1972, 1976, and 1977. 
In each year, there is no statistically significant difference (even at the 10 percent level)

shortcomings as productivity indicators. If output is measured in phys- 
ical terms (conventionally 3/8 inch equivalent basis), the quality of the 
finished product is being neglected, and there are corresponding con- 
cerns with respect to the quality of log inputs. The effective input of 
labor may well differ from labor time when there are opportunities for 
people to work more or less effectively and conscientiously. These are 
familiar difficulties in research on productivity measurement, though 
they are less severe in this instance insofar as the variance of unmea- 
sured components is smaller within an industry and region than across 
industries and regions. 

In table 3,  average values of output per worker-hour (labor produc- 
tivity) are consistently higher for the classical firms, but there is little 
difference between the co-ops and the unionized mills.  By contrast, 
average values of output per log input (material productivity) are usu- 
ally higher for the co-ops and the unionized mills and lowest for the 
classical mills. This implies quite different labor-log ratios as shown in 
the last line: computed over all production types, the average ratio of 
worker-hours to log inputs in cooperative and unionized mills is more 
than double its value in classical mills. These differences in input ratios 
are less marked in mills specializing in plywood and in veneer produc- 
tion. Output per size of largest lathe (XIK) is consistently highest among 
the unionized mills and usually lowest among the classical mills. 

One difficulty with the values of productivity in table 3 arises from 
the fact that the data are not a balanced panel, so differences in the 
mixture of  observations across firm types by year may influence the 
mean values. Table 4 reports proportionate differences in productivity, 
first, between co-ops and classical firms and, second, between union- 
ized firms and classical firms after adjusting for variations in the distri- 
bution of observations over time. The entries in table 4 are least-squares 
estimates of the parameters a, and a2 in the following equation: 

(1) 

ln(X/Zj)i,  =  ao;  +  a,jCi  + 

a2jU; 

+  Eta3tY, 

+  Uitj 

where X denotes output, Zj represents the use of input j,  Ci is an indi- 
cator for a co-op mill, Ui is an indicator for a unionized mill, and Y, is 
an indicator for year t. The Uj are stochastic disturbance terms. 

between the co-ops and the conventional firms except in 1977, when the conventional 
firms are reported as being 20 percent more productive.

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

The adjusted differences in labor productivity in table 4 still suggest 
that classical firms are the most efficient.27 However, the differences 
are now smaller than those implied by the raw means in table 3. Among 
the largest production group, mills specializing in plywood, the co-op 
mills are 16 percent less productive than classical mills, whereas un- 
ionized mills are 13 percent less productive. Even this difference would 
not be judged as  significantly less  than zero by the usual statistical 
criteria. 

The superior raw material productivity of the co-ops and unionized 
mills also falls in table 4 compared with the values in table 3. The raw 
material productivity of the co-ops is 36 percent greater (in logarithmic 
units) than the classical  mills,  and the material productivity of  the 
unionized mills is  19 percent greater than the classical mills. The im- 
plied labor-log input ratios are correspondingly smaller though they 
remain sizable: averaged over all production types, the ratio of worker- 
hours to raw material inputs is  74  percent greater in co-ops and 59 
percent greater in unionized mills than in classical mills. 

Table 4  also presents some average ratios of  output per machine. 
The ratio of output to the size of the mill's largest lathe is XIK. These 
output-machine ratios are very much higher in co-op mills and in un- 
ionized mills than in classical mills. There is no meaningful difference 
between co-ops and unionized mills, however. Indeed, this seems to be 
a general finding: whereas the classical mills' output-input ratios are 
different from the other mills, there is little difference between the co- 
ops and the unionized mills. 

In discussing table 4,  we have concentrated on those estimates cor- 
responding to the columns "all mills"  because, for each measure of 
productivity, standard F-tests indicate no significant differences (apply- 
ing conventional statistical criteria) among the productivity estimates 
according to the degree of product specialization. Indeed, throughout 
our research, it was a common finding that differences among the three 
types of mills according to their product specialization (that is,  mills 
producing plywood only, mills producing veneer only, and mills pro- 
ducing both plywood and veneer) were not statistically significant by 
customary standards. Hence, in what follows,  we concentrate on dif- 

27.  The numbers in parentheses in table 4 are the least-squares estimated standard 
errors. For the estimates of a, and a2 in the column "all mills" in table 4, dichotomous 
variables identifying veneer only and plywood only mills are added to equation 1.

ferences among co-ops,  unionized mills,  and classical mills  for the 
entire sample of  170 observations. 

Input-Output Ratios,  Production Functions, and 
Supply Functions 

The previous section concluded by presenting information on input- 

output ratios, so it is useful to start our analysis there. 

Input-Output Ratios 

A natural concern with the productivity differences reported in table 
4 is that no account is taken of differences in input and output prices 
facing these mills.  Though these prices are predetermined to  these 
mills, there are systematic price differences at a given time attributable 
primarily to variations in the quality of the output sold and log inputs 
purchased. Most of  the sample variation in prices is  over time,  and 
relatively little is across firms,28 but there remains some variation across 
firm types as  indicated in the last lines  of  table 4.  There are small 
differences in the price of output and of log inputs across the firm types, 
but unionized wages are about 14 percent higher than wages in classical 
mills. 

This concern with the role of prices arises, of course, out of rudi- 
mentary notions that firms do  not randomly select  their inputs and 
outputs, but do so with regard to some objectives. To determine whether 
the inferences from table 4 are affected by controlling for prices, con- 
sider augmenting equation 1 so that productivity equations of the fol- 
lowing form are estimated: 

(2) 

ln(X/Zj)i, =  aoj +  aljCi +  a2jU;  +  a3j(PONLY)i, +  a4j(VONLY)i, 

+  a5jln(pj/p,)i,  +  a6jlnZ>j, +  a7jT,  +  Ei,j. 

Again, X stands for output, and Zj for the use of input j.  The price 
of (plywood or veneer) output is po, and the price of input j  is pj. C is 
a dichotomous variable taking the value of unity for co-op mills,  and 

28.  Eighty-eight  percent  and 90  percent,  respectively,  of  the  variation  in the  loga- 
rithm of  output  prices  and  in  the  logarithm  of  log  input prices  are removed  by  yearly 
dummy variables  alone. 


144 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

U is  a dichotomous variable taking the value of  unity for unionized 
mills.  The omitted firm type is,  therefore, the classical mill. PONLY 
and VONLY are also dichotomous variables, the former identifying mills 
producing only plywood and the latter identifying mills producing only 
veneer. The integrated firm producing both veneer and plywood thus 
constitutes the omitted category.29 A linear time trend is indicated by 
T,.30 The E  are stochastic error terms. 

The purpose of these equations is to measure productivity differences 
by type of  firm, holding constant three classes of variables: first, the 
degree to  which the mills  specialize in  their production (hence the 
presence of PONLY and VONLY); second, relative prices; and, third, 
the general scale of production in recognition of any nonconstant returns 
to scale (which explains the presence of Zj on the right-hand side of 
these equations).3' 

The instrumental variable estimates of equation 2 are presented in 

29.  Note that there is a time subscript on PONLY and VONLY. In most cases, a mill 
remained in one of the three stages of production throughout the time period. In a few 
cases, there are instances of a mill that usually specializes in veneer (plywood) producing 
a little plywood (veneer). 

30.  All these equations were estimated with dummy variables for each year replacing 
the linear time trend. The differences in inferences between the two specifications are 
very small. 

31.  These equations may be rationalized as first-order conditions from a production 

function of the following form: 

X  =  A(e,j"j) 

where A?0  is usually designated a neutral efficiency parameter and, once the normali- 
zation Y_  --  1 is imposed, the  ,?0  may be interpreted as distributional parameters. 
The delta and Oj should be of the same sign. The values of the 4 parameters depend upon 
the units in which the inputs are measured. This function does not impose homotheticity, 
it is compatible with increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale, and the partial 
elasticities of substitution among the inputs need not be constant. The ratios of the partial 
elasticities of substitution are independent of the levels of inputs and output. If inputs 
are selected such that the values of  marginal products are equal to input prices, the 
following output-input equations are implied: 

ln(XIZ,) =  (1  -  6)'ln(80y-"lq1)  +  (1  -  8)-'ln(pj1pO) 

+  (6  -  Oj) (1  - 

and vj = 

)-'lnZ  ?+ vj 
(1 -  6) -'  Xj . These equations are equivalent to equation 
where Nq =  A 
2 provided the ln-qj terms are linear functions of C;, Ui, PONLYi,, VONLYi,, and time 
and provided the vj are treated as stochastic disturbance terms that vary across mills and 
over time. According to this interpretation of equation 2, the technical efficiency param- 
eter (A) or the distributional parameters (4j) of the production function vary by type of 
firm (C; and Uj), but the other parameters (0,,  XA, and 6) do not.

table 5.32  The labor productivity of co-ops and unionized mills remains 
lower than that of  the classical mills,  though the differences are not 
significantly different from zero.  Measured in  terms of  logarithmic 
differences, the output to  log-input ratio of  the co-ops  is  about 58 
percent higher and of the unionized mills 46 percent higher than that of 
the classical mills. The two equations describing variations in output 
per machine suggest very much higher productivity in the unionized 
and cooperative mills.  In other words, these equations suggest that, 
with the exception of output per worker-hour, productivity is higher in 
both the co-op and unionized mills than in the classical mills. In all of

tivity between the cooperative mills and the unionized mills cannot be 
rejected. The mills specializing in the production of veneer have lower 
productivity, but there is little difference between the integrated mills 
and those specializing in the manufacture of plywood.33 

Hence the estimates in table 5 indicate higher levels of average output 
per materials and of average output per machine in the co-op mills and 
the unionized mills, holding constant scale effects, relative prices, and 
type of production. This suggests differences in the production func- 
tions by type of firm, and it is to this issue that we now turn. 

Production  Functions 
A simple reparameterization of equation 2 yields a production func- 
tion. That is, if relative prices in equation 2 are replaced with all input 
quantities, a familiar Cobb-Douglas production function results: 

(3) 

ln(X/Zj)i, =  bo +  b1Cj +  b3Ui +  b3(PONLY)i, +  b4(VONLY)i, 

+  1k 

b5klnZ4'kit  +  b6T,  +  ui, 

where ui, is a stochastic error term. Provided all inputs are included on 
the right-hand side  of  equation 3,  at least  with least squares, it  is 
immaterial which input, Zj, is used to normalize output on the left-hand 
side of the equation.34 

The first two columns of  table 6  contain least-squares (OLS) and 

33.  If the estimates in table 5 are interpreted in terms of  the production function 
specified in footnote 31,  the statistical significance of the coefficients on C; and Ui in 
the output per materials and the output per lathe equations together with the apparent 
lack of significance of these coefficients in the output per worker-hours equation must 
imply that the distributional parameters attached to materials and to machines, the 4, 
vary across type of firms. 

34.  A considerable amount of effort was devoted to the estimation of other forms of 
the production function such as the translog and quadratic. (By quadratic, we  mean 
specifying output to be a second-order Taylor series expansion in the inputs, not in the 
logarithm of inputs.) To be interpreted as meaningful production functions, our estimates 
must satisfy two criteria: first, the law of diminishing returns should apply to each input, 
holding constant other inputs at their mean values; and, second, marginal products 
should be positive at input levels actually observed. Our estimates of the translog and 
quadratic production functions did not always satisfy these two requirements. For at 
least one type of firm (not the same type), these specifications did not deliver an eco- 
nomically meaningful technology. For this reason, we concentrate on the estimates of 
the Cobb-Douglas function that we interpret as simply a log-linear approximation to the 
technology.

instrumental variable (INV) estimates of  equation 3.  In the case of 
instrumental variables, all inputs are treated as endogenous, and input 
and output prices serve as  instruments in  addition to year and firm 
dummy variables. The Zj used to normalize output is worker-hours, and 
the inputs consist of worker-hours, logs,  and maximum lathe length. 
The coefficient on worker-hours implies an elasticity of  output with 
respect to  worker-hours of  about 0.4.  The elasticity of  output with 
respect to log inputs is 0.53,  and a negative elasticity is computed for 
machines .35 

These estimates suggest that the co-ops are 13 to  15 percent more 
productive than are the classical mills.  However, the coefficients on 
neither the co-op dummy nor the union dummy variables, Ci and Ui, 
respectively, would be regarded as significantly different from zero by 
conventional criteria. 

These estimates impose the same input-output elasticities on the three 
types of  firms. This is relaxed in the estimates reported in the other 
columns,  where equation 3  is  fitted to  the observations on  co-ops, 
unionized mills,  and classical mills separately.36 According to these 
estimates, the coefficient on worker-hours is  similar across the three 
types of firms. However, the coefficients on raw materials and machines 
appear different. With respect to the coefficients attached to the input 
of logs, the elasticity is lowest for the co-ops and highest for the clas- 
sical mills. These estimated elasticities are negatively correlated with 
the average values of  output per log  input reported in the previous 

35.  Berman and Berman (1989) also estimate Cobb-Douglas production functions 
to pooled cross-section time-series observations of the plywood industry in the Pacific 
Northwest. They derive their data from the Census of Manufactures for the years 1958, 
1963,  1967,  1972,  1976, and 1977. Their inputs are employment, the book value of 
gross depreciable assets divided by the GNP implicit price deflator, and the ratio of 
output to maximum feasible output, which they label as a capacity utilization measure. 
The input of log raw materials is omitted. They introduce fixed-year effects, which in 
their results for the combined sample are not individually significantly different from 
zero.  Not  surprisingly, the ratio of  output to  maximum feasible output is  strongly 
correlated with output (the left-hand-side variable). In their combined sample, other 
things equal, a cooperative mill is estimated to produce about 19 percent less than a 
conventional mill, and this estimate is significantly less than zero at the 1 percent level 
(p.  292).  No  distinction is  made between unionized and nonunionized conventional 
mills. 

36.  We estimated all equations using different techniques such as adjusting standard 
errors to recognize the unbalanced nature of the panel and also allowing each mill to 
have its specific random effect. Our results were very similar to those reported.

sections. According to the X!G ratios in table 4 and also according to 
the estimates attached to Ci and Ui in the second column of table 5, 
average values of output per log  input are highest among the co-ops 
and lowest among the classical firms. Using 0  to denote classical mills, 
C the co-op mills,  and U the unionized mills, the ordering of average 
values of output per log input is 

(X/G)C  >  (XIG)U >  (XIG)?. 

By contrast, letting y be the estimated coefficient on the logarithm of 
the input of logs in table 6, the ordering of the values of y by firm type 
is 

y 0> 

yu  > 

.yc 

This pattern of values of X/G and of  y is exactly that implied by a 
log-linear production function if the three types of firms face approxi- 
mately the same output and log input prices and if log inputs are selected 
such that the value of the marginal product of logs equals the price of 
logs. In this situation, because the marginal product of logs in the Cobb- 
Douglas production function is -yX/G, equality of input prices implies 
that relatively high values of -y are offset by relatively low values of 
XIG. 

This argument suggests, therefore, that the observed differences in 
output per log input across the three types of firms are the consequence 
of differences in the elasticity of output with respect to log inputs in 
the production functions of the three types of firms. The elasticity is 
lowest for the co-op mills,  and accordingly they economize on their 
input of  logs  relative to their output; the elasticity is  largest for the 
classical mills,  and accordingly they make relatively extensive use of 
log inputs given their output.37 

This reasoning is  based on the point estimates of  the production 
functions reported in table 6.  Let us consider whether the differences 
in the point estimates reported in table 6 would be judged as statistically 

37.  An  argument  along  these  lines  applies  also  to  the  output-machine  elasticities 
reported in table 6.  These  elasticities  are highest  for the classical  mills  and least  for the 
unionized  mills.  Inspection  of  tables  3  and 4  indicates  that the  average  values  of  XIK 
are least  for the classical  mills  and highest  for  the unionized  mills.  Again,  when  faced 
with  similar  machine  prices,  the  classical  mills'  production  function  inclines  them  to 
make extensive  use  of  machinery given  their output,  while  the unionized  mills'  produc- 
tion function  induces  them to conserve  on  machinery  given  their output.

duction functions, ui,, are normally distributed and applying standard 
F-tests of  differences among the firm types in their production func- 
tions, we find the percentage p-values (or marginal significance levels) 
given in table 7.38 

The percentage p-values in table 7 suggest that the null hypothesis 
of  no difference in the worker-hours elasticities and in the machine 
elasticities across firm types cannot be rejected (lines 1 and 3 respec- 
tively). However, the null hypothesis of no differences in the material 
input elasticities among firm types (line 2) can be rejected by customary 
criteria. According to both the least-squares and instrumental variable 
estimates, the entire production function differs significantly among the 

38.  The form of the production function on which the tests are based is given in 
table 7: the coefficient ox is the intercept in the production function, the coefficient i  is 
that attached to the logarithm of worker-hours, the coefficient y  is that attached to the

three firm types (line 4).  In general, the classical mills'  production 
function appears more distinctive than that of  the co-ops  or of  the 
unionized mills.39 

What do the estimated production functions in table 6 imply about 
overall production efficiency? Denote the vector of inputs and output 
by Z and X,  respectively, and let 0 be the vector of estimated input- 
output elasticities. Zi denotes the inputs actually used by mill i,  and O0 
represents the input-output elasticities estimated with the data for firm 
type j  (where j  =  0  for classical mills,  U for unionized mills,  and C 
for co-ops).  Then lnXj. represents the logarithm of  output that mill i 
would have produced given its inputs Zi and given the estimated param- 
eters O: lnXi =  lInZi.0'. Hence InX? (=  lInZi.0) is the logarithm of the 
output of mill i when the input-output elasticities estimated to the ob- 
servations on the classical mills, 00, are applied to mill i's actual inputs, 
Z .40  These levels of output were predicted for all the mills using both 
the least-squares estimates and the instrumental variable estimates of 
the production functions.4' 

Table 8 presents the average values of these predictions for each type 
of firm for the year 1980 and for a mill producing both plywood and 
veneer. Thus when the co-op mills are examined, the logarithm of their 
observed inputs multiplied by the production function parameters esti- 
mated from the classical mills' observations, 00, yields an average of 
log  output of  4.820.  When the logarithm of  each co-op's  observed 
inputs is  multiplied by the production function parameters estimated 
from the unionized  mills'  observations,  Ou, the average of the logarithm 

39.  In other words, according to line 5,  the null hypothesis of no difference in the 
input-output elasticities of the co-ops' and unionized mills' production functions cannot 
be rejected by customary criteria. The corresponding null hypotheses regarding classical 
mills and co-op mills (line 6) and regarding classical mills and unionized mills (line 7) 
can be rejected. 

40.  Correspondingly, lnXc (=  lnZ; * OC) is the logarithm of output of mill i when 
the input-output elasticities estimated to the co-op mills, Oc, are applied to the actual 
inputs used by this mill. The logarithm of output of mill i is lnXu' (=  lnZ .0u) when the 
input-output elasticities estimated from the data on the unionized mills, Ou, are applied 
to the actual inputs used by this mill. 

41.  The form of the production function is that presented in table 7. It allows each 
firm type to have its own intercept and its own input-output elasticity. The effects of the 
time trend and the (PONLY) and (VONLY) variables were constrained to be the same 
across the firm types. For the predictions summarized in table 8,  the coefficients on 
(PONLY) and (VONLY) are set to zero, and the time trend is assigned its value in the 
year 1980.

of output is 4.815.  Finally, when the co-ops' production function pa- 
rameters, Oc, are applied to each co-op's  inputs, the average of  the 
logarithm of  output is 4.928.  In other words, according to the least- 
squares estimates of the production functions, the co-op estimated pa- 
rameters imply about a 10 percent higher output than do the estimated 
parameters for a classical mill (4.928  -  4.820  =  0.108) when applied 
to the levels  of  inputs actually used by the co-ops.  Indeed, in each 
instance, the elasticities computed with the observations on the co-op 
mills  generate higher output than the elasticities estimated from the 
observations on the conventional firms.42 

A  different way of  assessing whether the production functions of 
these mills are materially different is to consider whether behavioral 
equations that are derivative of  the production function also suggest 
differences among firm types. For instance, if these mills face approx- 
imately the same prices of output and inputs, then (assuming similar 
concern with net revenue maximization) differences in their production 
functions should imply differences in the output supply responses to 
changes of prices. We now turn to consider this implication. 

42.  This is consistent with (though not necessarily implied by) the estimated coef- 
ficients on C,  in the first two columns of table 6,  which suggested higher productive 
efficiency for the co-op mills of  13 to 15 percent.

Output Supply Functions 
The equations reported in the previous section related a quantity, 
namely output, to other quantities, the inputs. In this section we inquire 
into differences among firms in the relationship between output and 
prices and ask whether the supply functions of the co-ops are different 
from the conventional firms'. There has been a large theoretical litera- 
ture speculating on the shape of the co-ops' output supply function, but 
remarkably little persuasive empirical research on the matter.43 

Following the general log-linear form of equations 2 and 3, we start 

with the following supply equation: 

(4) 

lnXit =  c0  +  CiC +  c2UA +  c3(PONLY)i, +  c4(VONLY)i, 

+ 

c61nri, 

c51npi,  + 

c71nwi,  +  c8lnst  +  cgTt +  vit 
where p is the real price of output, r is the real price of log inputs, w 
is the real hourly wage, and s is an index of the real price of machin- 
ery.44 T is a linear time trend, and vi, is a stochastic disturbance term. 
This equation would result if the mills have a cost function of the form 

+ 

eBXY  IrY2WY3SY4 

and if  they select an output at which their marginal cost is  equal to 
price.  If B is a linear function  of  C,,  Ui,  (PONLY)i,, (VONLY)it, a time 
trend, and a stochastic disturbance, then equation 4 is implied. 

Because most labor is not a hired input for the co-ops, a cost function 
of this form has a different interpretation from that for the conventional 
firms. For the co-ops, the cost function is the outcome of the problem 
of  producing an output such that (1)  the cost  of  raw materials and 
machines plus (2) the disutility of labor is minimized. The relevant w 

43.  The seminal statement was,  of  course, Ward (1958) who showed that under 
some restrictive assumptions a co-op's output supply function would slope negatively 
with respect to its price. Although Ward demonstrated this was not a robust result, it 
remained a preoccupation in the theoretical literature for a long time. 

44.  The variable s is defined as P,,(8  +  p)ICPI, where p is Moody's AAA domestic 
corporate bond rate, P,,, is a price index for machinery and equipment used in manufac- 
turing industry, 8  is  an assumed depreciation rate of  0. 10, and CPI is  the all items 
consumer price index. Data on p, P,Z, and CPI are found in the Economic Report of the 
President, January 1993, on pages 411, 418,  and 428. The variable s varies over time 
but not across firms.

in  the co-ops'  marginal cost  equation is  the marginal disutility (or 
opportunity cost)  of  labor. We use  three different estimates of  this 
marginal disutility: first, the observed hourly real earnings of  co-op 
workers; second,  the hourly real wage averaged each year over the 
unionized firms; and third, the hourly real wage averaged each year 
over the classical firms. 

Columns 1, 2,  and 3 of table 9 report least-squares estimates of the 
supply equation 4.  In column 1, w for the co-op mills is taken to be 
their actual real hourly earnings; in column 2,  the co-ops'  w is  that

155 

predicted from the wage data for the union mills; in column 3, the co- 
ops'  w is  that predicted from the wage observations of  the classical 
mills. The coefficient estimates in columns 1, 2, and 3 resemble those 
we would expect of firms in a competitive industry: supply rises with 
respect to output price with an elasticity of about unity; and supply falls 
with respect to the price of raw materials, labor, and machinery.45 

The estimates reported in columns 4,  5,  and 6 of table 9 are those 
that result when equation 4 is modified to allow the output price elas- 
ticity,  c5, to differ among the three types of  firms. According to the 
estimates in column 4  of  table 9,  the output price elasticity among 
classical firms is  1.86,  while that attached to the interaction between 
lnpi, and Ci is  almost exactly equal to the negative of  1.86.  In other 
words, the output price elasticity among the co-op mills is considerably 
lower than that' for the classical firms. The unionized mills' output price 
elasticity is about 0.7  and lies between the classical mills' and the co- 
ops'.  These coefficients are not measured with much precision, so the 
confidence intervals around the price elasticities are regrettably high.46 
Nevertheless,  here is  evidence that the co-ops'  supply response to 
changes in  output prices is  considerably lower than that among the 
classical firms, just as some of the theoretical literature has surmised. 
Indeed, some of the conventional firms in the plywood industry have 
complained of the co-ops' price-insensitive behavior.47 

45.  The coefficient of approximately unity on C, implies that, at the same prices, 
the co-ops' supply is about twice in logarithmic units that of the classical firms. This 
large difference is the consequence of the omission of factors in equation 4 accounting 
for plant size, the co-ops and the unionized mills having considerably larger plants than 
the classical mills. The difference between the estimated coefficients on C, and on Ui 
imply that, at the same prices, the co-ops supply between 4 and 7 percent more output 
than do the unionized firms. This difference between the co-ops and the union mills 
would not be judged as significantly different from zero by the customary criteria. 

46.  A test of the hypothesis that the coefficients on the interactions terms (that is, 
the coefficients on Cilnpi, and Uilnpi,) are jointly zero yields a p-value of 4.75  percent 
for the estimates in column 4. The test statistics for the other columns are very similar. 
Note the larger coefficients estimated for the dummy variables Ci and Ui in columns 4, 
5, and 6. This is to be expected: if the co-ops' output-price elasticity is very low, then 
naturally the supply curve will rotate clockwise around the central tendency of its output- 
price observations and generate a higher intercept. The same argument applies to the 
unionized mills though the output-price elasticity is not as small as it is for the co-ops 
so the union mills' estimated intercept is not as large. 

47.  Writing in  1967, Berman observes, "The worker-owned companies are noto- 
rious in the industry for maintaining high-level output regardless of market conditions,

The equations whose estimates are reported in columns 4,  5,  and 6 
of table 9 permit the output price coefficients to vary by firm type, but 
restrict the other price coefficients to be the same. The estimates in 
table  10 relax this constraint by  presenting estimates of  equation 4 
separately by firm type.48 Naturally, the estimates are very much less 
precise. The point estimates suggest that, in their output responses, the 
classical mills are very sensitive to the price of output, raw material 
inputs, and machinery. By contrast, the co-ops'  supply is much less 
responsive to changes in input and output prices.49 The estimates for 
unionized firms seem to fall between those of the classical firms and 
those of the co-ops. 

These differences in the output supply equations are consistent with 
the differences in the point estimates of  the production functions in 
table 6. In particular, where the input-output elasticities of the produc- 
tion function are higher, the output-price responses of the supply equa- 
tion should also be greater. The classical firms tend to have higher 
output-input elasticities for raw materials and machines than do the co- 
op  mills,  and correspondingly the classical  mills'  output-price re- 
sponses tend to be larger in absolute value. 

Of course, an alternative explanation for the differences between the 
output-price responses in table 10 of conventional firms and those of 
the co-ops is that they have different objectives. For instance, a co-op 
may maximize an objective function that has as arguments not merely 
net revenues, but also the employment of its members. In this circum- 
stance, even if the production functions of the co-op mills were identical 
to those of the conventional firms, their output-price responses would 
be different. These responses would depend upon the relative weight 
of employment and net revenues in their objective function. Therefore, 

as their tendency to continue five- and even six-day operations has been widely blamed 
for aggravating price depression" (p. 199). Dahl (1957, p. 59) wrote that "the privately- 
owned mills .  .  . are particularly bitter because the worker-owned plants operate contin- 
uously regardless of market conditions." 

48.  As before, the estimates in column 1 of table 10 measure the co-ops' opportunity 
cost of labor as the observed hourly real wage paid in these mills. In columns 2 and 3, 
the co-ops'  opportunity cost of  labor is  measured by the average real wage paid to 
workers in the unionized mills and in the classical mills, respectively. 

49.  The null hypothesis that the co-ops' estimated output elasticities with respect to 
input and output prices are the same as those of the classical mills yields a p-value of 
3.32  percent for the estimates reported in column 1 of table 10. The p-values for the 
estimates in columns 2 and 3 are almost the same.

the differences in the output-price responses between the co-op mills 
and those of the classical mills do not necessarily imply differences in 
the underlying production functions. However, the differences across 
the firm types in the point estimates of the output supply equations are 
consistent with the point estimates of the production function reported 
in table 6. 

Conclusions 

The evidence we have assembled here suggests three classes of find- 
ings.  First, input-output ratios among the three types of  mills in the 
plywood industry of the Pacific Northwest are different. The differences 
are related to differences in their production functions: higher input- 
output ratios tend to be found where production function input-output 
elasticities are lower. 


158 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

The second class of findings relates to these production functions. 
Though the production functions of the mills may not be identical, there 
is  not much to  distinguish these types of  firms in  terms of  overall 
production efficiency. What differences we have found imply that co- 
ops are more efficient than the principal conventional firms by between 
6  and 14 percent (as suggested by the results reported in table 8).50 
There is little difference between the efficiency of the unionized and 
classical mills (again as suggested by table 8). 

The third class of findings relates to the output supply functions of 
these firms. If these firms face the same product and input prices and if 
these firms share a concern with net revenues, then differences in pro- 
duction functions should imply differences in output supply functions; 
indeed, this is what we find. The classical mills with the highest input- 
output elasticities in their production function have the highest output- 
price responses in the estimated supply function; the co-ops tend to 
have the smallest input-output elasticities in their production function 
and also the smallest output-price responses in their supply function. 
Our research on this important case study suggests that worker par- 
ticipation has neither major efficiency gains nor efficiency losses.  If 
these beneficial or deleterious effects are present, they are of secondary 
importance. This does not mean that there are no important differences 
among these types of mills. On the contrary, we have argued in other 
research that the co-op mills behave in quite different ways from the 
conventional firms. When faced with adversity, the co-ops adjust pay 
and avoid changes in their labor inputs and output; by contrast, when 
confronted with drops in output price, conventional firms adjust em- 
ployment and work hours (and consequently output), and wages do not 
change. These are important differences, but they do not relate to the 
50.  This is the range of differences between the predicted outputs across the columns 
of  table 8  for the lines  corresponding to  "co-op  mills'  inputs" and "union mills' 
inputs." The differences for the "classical mills'  inputs" are much larger, and this 
might suggest an alternative explanation for these production patterns. The co-ops and 
unionized firms are similar in size, while the classical firms are much smaller. It could 
be that all three types of firms operate at different points on the same nonhomothetic 
production function. We estimated the first-order conditions from the nonhomothetic 
production function defined in footnote 31,  and we simulated the resulting parameters 
(that were not estimated precisely) to determine whether there was evidence of changes 
in returns to scale by size.  Our estimates of decreasing returns to scale changed very 
little with the level of inputs and outputs.

technical conditions of production that this paper suggests are similar 
across the three types of firms. 

The small differences across these mills in the technical conditions 
of production explain why over a period of 70 years conventional firms 
and cooperatives have co-existed in the same industry and the same 
location. If the co-ops have been slightly more efficient producers, then 
their dominance has been offset  by  their capital market difficulties 
mentioned above. If their superiority in production were greater, it is 
likely their capital market obstacles would have been overcome, and 
cooperatives would have dominated the industry. 

Interestingly, as plywood production has moved to the South, the 
cooperative organization has not moved with it.  Why? We speculate 
that a conjunction of several factors accounts for the durability of the 
plywood co-ops in the Pacific Northwest and have obstructed its trans- 
plantation to the South. The establishment and success of the first co- 
op in the plywood industry in Washington state were the product of the 
foresight of some shrewd men who, prior to its formation, were already 
skilled in the work relevant to plywood production and who shared a 
common Scandinavian heritage. This co-op served as the model for 
many imitators in the area. 

These factors seem to be present in other sectors where cooperatives 
have been important. In many instances, a group of workers with train- 
ing in a given line of work and who share cultural ties form a collective 
organization that enjoys remarkable success. It serves as a prototype, 
and other firms are established along the same lines so that the coop- 
erative form of organization constitutes a substantial component of the 
industry. For example, this pattern applies to Boston's Independent 
Taxi Operators Association, which involved many Jewish immigrants 
from Eastern Europe, and it applies to the scavenger companies in the 
San Francisco Bay Area whose owner-workers were predominantly of 
northern Italian origin. At the same time, the dilution of the common 
ties of  ethnicity has contributed to the decline of the cooperatives in 
these two sectors: in the case of the taxi cabs, new immigrants from the 
Soviet Union brought different attitudes to the cooperative, attitudes 
that emphasized short-term monetary gain over long-term investments, 
while in the case of the scavenger companies, the core Italian members 
resisted the growing presence of Hispanic and Black workers and as a

result found themselves presented with a class action discrimination 
suit. 

When workers share similar values, disputes within the producing 
unit are less  likely to occur, monitoring costs tend to be lower, and 
social sanctions are probably more effective in deterring malfeasance. 
If such "cultural" factors are important in understanding the pattern 
and success of worker co-ops in the United States, then the value of the 
international comparisons of organizations that are so common today is 
questionable. Thus it has become routine to contrast the internal struc- 
ture of Japanese firms with that of U.S.  firms, and the common sug- 
gestion is  that the performance of  U.S.  firms would improve if only 
they emulated the Japanese. If one of  the factors contributing to the 
success of firms is closely tied to nonreproducible cultural factors, as 
the study of cooperatives in the United States would suggest, then U.S. 
firms may experience no more success by copying the internal structure 
of Japanese firms than plywood companies in the South would enjoy 
by imitating the worker-owned companies of the Pacific Northwest. 


Comments and 
Discussion 

Comment by Henry Farber: This paper is the third in a series by Craig 
and Pencavel comparing the economic behavior of cooperative firms in 
the Pacific Northwest plywood industry with the behavior of nonunion 
(or classical) and union firms in the same industry. The first paper, 
published  in  the  American  Economic  Review,  examined  differential 
responses of employment and wages to changes in output and concluded 
that cooperatives adjust wages more and employment less in response 
to  output changes than do other types of  firms. The second paper, 
published  in  the  Journal  of  Political  Economy,  corroborates  and ex- 
pands on these findings from a somewhat different theoretical perspec- 
tive.  Their new paper addresses the question of  the productivity of 
cooperative firms relative both to nonunion and union firms. As such, 
it fills an important niche left unexplored by the earlier papers. I 

This paper is carefully done, and the central conclusion is that co- 
operative firms are somewhat more productive (about 6 to 14 percent) 
than are other types of firms in the sense that output is predicted to be 
that much higher when a fixed set of  inputs is used in a cooperative 
firm rather than in a classical or union firm. Not surprisingly, I have a 
few quibbles with choices made and roads not taken, but my overall 
assessment is that the analysis is sound and informative. 

The efficiency of  cooperative firms can be compared with that of 
other types of organizations in at least two ways. The first is the effi- 
ciency with which the enterprise chooses its inputs. The earlier work 
by Craig and Pencavel provides clear evidence that cooperatives choose

their inputs differently, particularly in how they adjust to changes in 
demand. The fact that labor inputs in cooperative firms exhibit less 
fluctuation over time than do labor inputs in union and classical firms 
is clear evidence that the efficiencies are different. 

The second sense of efficiency, the efficiency with which a fixed set 
of inputs is converted into output through the production process, is the 
focus of the current paper. My remarks focus on this analysis. But it 
should be  kept in  mind that a  full  evaluation of  the economics of 
cooperative ventures needs to consider input choice as well  as input 
usage. 

The paper starts with a discussion of reasons why cooperatives might 
be more productive than other types of firms. Virtually all of this dis- 
cussion focuses on agency explanations regarding monitoring by fellow 
worker-owners, less  need for monitoring by managers, and so forth. 
The authors also note that cooperative firms might be able to attract 
more productive workers. 

Next is  an interesting discussion of  why cooperative firms are so 
scarce generally if there is any substantial productive advantage. Much 
of  this discussion focuses on capital market problems. For example, 
workers might have trouble collateralizing loans used to buy shares in 
their firm. Or investing in the firm in which a worker is employed does 
not diversify the worker's overall portfolio. One potential explanation 
for the scarcity of cooperatives that is unrelated to capital market prob- 
lems and that Craig and Pencavel do not examine is related to a point 
made in the conclusion to the paper: an important factor in the formation 
of cooperatives is a social or ethnic commonality among the potential 
worker-owners. It may be that such commonality of background com- 
bined with an interest in working together is relatively rare. 

After a detailed description of the plywood industry and of the struc- 
ture of  the cooperatives, the central question of  productivity is  dis- 
cussed. The necessary discussion of potential endogeneity of ownership 
structure is clear, but, absent a real experiment, we must simply stip- 
ulate that the analysis proceeds conditional on ownership structure. 

Now comes the data description and empirical analysis. The plywood 
mills are classified two ways: by ownership structure (classical, union, 
cooperative), and by type of output (plywood only, veneer only, ply- 
wood and veneer). It may be more important than the authors admit 
that the ownership structure is  not distributed randomly among the

output types.2 The cooperative mills are disproportionately plywood- 
only mills. The classical mills are disproportionately veneer-only mills. 
The union mills represent both types more equally, but virtually all of 
the combined mills are union mills. 

A related point is that the authors (to their advantage) are using a 
physical measure of output (3/8 inch equivalent square feet or sheets). 
But it is  hard to see  how this measure is  strictly comparable across 
output types. Producing veneer (soaking the logs,  stripping the veneer 
from the log) and producing plywood (layup of the veneer, sorting, and 
gluing) are simply different processes. 

My intuition is that the production processes (and, hence, production 
functions) likely  differ across output types. The fact that ownership 
type is not distributed randomly suggests some systematic selection of 
ownership type by production process. After some preliminary testing 
that finds no significant differences by output type, the empirical anal- 
ysis  that follows  generally allows only for intercept shifts by output 
type,  while allowing for more complete interactions with ownership 
type. It may be the case that part of what is measured as differences by 
ownership type may be differences by output type that cannot make 
themselves heard any other way. 

A puzzle, evident in the simple statistics in table 1, is noted but not 
really discussed in the paper. The real price of logs rose by a factor of 
about 4 between 1960 and 1992, while the real price of plywood was 
relatively stable over this period. Thus, this is an industry where there 
has not been much technological change and where the price of the raw 
material, which makes up  a  significant fraction of  costs,  increased 
dramatically, while the product price was roughly fixed. One would 
expect the product price to  increase as  well.  A  first approximation 
would be to multiply the proportional change in the raw material price 
(four times) by the share of log costs in total costs (about 0.5 based on 
the  Cobb-Douglas production function estimates).  Thus,  plywood 
prices would have been expected to  double.  I  do  not have a  good 
explanation for the relative stability of  plywood prices. Perhaps tre- 
mendous quasi rents were being earned in this industry 30 years ago 
that no longer exist. This remains a puzzle.

The central empirical results are presented in table 4,  which contains 
estimates  of output per unit input for three inputs: labor,  logs  (timber), 
and capital.  I am somewhat  concerned  by  the  capital  measure,  which 
is  the  size  of  the  largest  lathe  in  the  mill.  Surely  what  is  needed  is  a 
measure of  total capital  input,  and the implication  of  the discussion  is 
that mills  can  have  more  than one  lathe.  Using  the  size  of  the  largest 
lathe seems  (to my technically  uninformed eye)  to be akin to measuring 
labor input by  the height  or weight  of  the largest  worker.  Perhaps the 
total length  of  all lathes  would  be  a better measure.  At the least,  some 
discussion  of  how  closely  the  size  of  the  largest  lathe  correlates  with 
scale  of  production  is  needed. 

Some  very  interesting  contrasts are apparent in table 4.  Cooperative 
mills  and union  mills  produce less  output per labor input than do clas- 
sical  mills.  Offsetting  this,  cooperative  mills  produce more output per 
log  input and per capital  input than do classical  mills.  On balance,  the 
cooperative  mills  and union mills  look fairly similar on output-per-unit- 
input grounds,  and both types  differ  fairly  substantially  from classical 
mills .3 

Next  is  an analysis,  in table 5,  of  output per unit input as a function 
of  the  ratio  of  the  input price  to  the  output price,  including  intercept 
shifts  for ownership  type  and output type.  I would  like  to see  the price 
ratio  unconstrained  to  allow  independent  estimates  of  the  input  and 
output  price  effects.  I  would  also  like  to  see  more  discussion  of  the 
instruments (particularly the wage  measures)  and tests  of the overiden- 
tifying  restrictions.  Finally,  it would be useful to see the OLS estimates 
as well  as the first-stage  regressions. 

In the  end,  I would  skip  these  estimates  and jump  right to  the  pro- 
duction  function  estimates  in table  6  where  log  output is regressed  on 
the  log  of  all  inputs  and dummy  variables  for  ownership  and  output 
types.  Both  OLS  and IV  estimates  are presented,  and the  results  are 
similar.  Unconstrained  specifications  with  separate equations  for each 
ownership type are also presented.  The results of this exercise  are fairly 
clear.  Cooperative  mills  have  higher  output conditional  on  inputs  and 
output type.  The  evidence  is  also  fairly  clear  that the capital  measure

earlier work.

(maximum  lathe  size)  is  not significantly  related to  output controlling 
for  other  inputs.  Finally,  the  input  of  logs  (timber)  is  only  weakly 
related to output in cooperative  mills. 

I  have  only  a  couple  of  comments  on  these  estimates.  First,  the 
overidentifying  restrictions  in the IV  estimates  should  be  tested.  Sec- 
ond,  and perhaps more important, it might be that the right way to break 
down  the sample  is  not by ownership  type  but by output type. 

Table  8  contains  the  final product of  the  analysis.  Taking,  in  turn, 
the  estimates  from  table  6  of  the  production  functions  by  ownership 
type,  Craig  and Pencavel  predict  output using,  in  turn,  the  inputs  by 
ownership type.  The results are two sets of nine predicted outputs (three 
sets  of  parameters by  three  sets  of  input types  by  two  estimation  pro- 
cedures,  OLS and IV).  These  estimates  show  a productivity  advantage 
to  cooperative  mills  of  8  to  10  percent.  Unfortunately,  no  standard 
errors are provided  for these  predicted values  or for key  differences. 

The  last  part of  the  paper examines  output  supply  as  a function  of 
input  and output  prices.  The  interesting  result  of  this  analysis  is  that 
output is  strongly  related  to  output price  only  for classical  firms.  The 
point estimate  of  the elasticity  of  output with respect  to output price is 
zero for cooperatives  and (probably) insignificantly  different from zero 
for  union  firms.  The  result  for cooperatives  is  not terribly surprising. 
Craig and Pencavel's  earlier  work  demonstrated that cooperatives  ab- 
sorb demand fluctuations  more in earnings than in employment,  which 
implies  relatively  little  output fluctuation.  The surprising result here is 
that output of  union  firms is  relatively  insensitive  to  price.  The  usual 
view  of  union  firms is  that wages  are rigid  so  that all  adjustment must 
take place  in  quantities.  That does  not  seem  to  be  what  is  happening 
here,  and this  is  a puzzle. 

In summary,  there  is  a clear  result  from  the  analysis.  Cooperative 
firms do  seem  to  produce  moderately  more output with  a given  set  of 
inputs.  We  remain  in  the  dark,  however,  about  exactly  (or  even  ap- 
proximately)  why  that  might  be  the  case.  Some  hints  (empirical  and 
theoretical)  are contained  in the paper. One is that the output per log  is 
highest in cooperative  mills.  Another is the view  that cooperatives  have 
different objectives  (employment  stabilization?)  than do other types  of 
mills.  Both of these  suggest  that the production process  has a different 
focus  in cooperative  mills.  One  is  left  with  the puzzle  of  whether  the 


166 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

(seeming)  focus  on employment  stabilization  in cooperative  mills  has 
productivity  advantages  that are at the  core  of  the  central  findings  in 
this  interesting  paper. 

Comment  by  Alan  Krueger:  This  paper is  well  written  and topical. 
Indeed,  for  reasons  I'll  detail  shortly,  the  paper  may  even  be  more 
topical  now than the authors realized  when they wrote it. The empirical 
work is thorough and straightforward. I especially  commend  Craig and 
Pencavel's  efforts  collecting  and analyzing  a new  data set.  I also  com- 
mend their strong knowledge  of the institutions of the plywood  industry. 
I said the paper may be more topical  than the authors realized  when 
they  wrote  it  because,  since  then,  Richard  Freeman  and Joel  Rogers 
released  results  of  a  large  survey  of  workers  that found,  "The  vast 
majority of employees  want more involvement  and greater say in com- 
pany decisions  affecting  the workplace. "'  The New  York Times,  Wash- 
ington Post,  and Wall St.  Journal  recently  ran stories  on  the  "partici- 
pation  gap."  Freeman  and  Rogers  also  find  that  more  than  three- 
quarters of workers feel  that giving  workers more say in decisions  about 
improve  quality,  and im- 
production  would  increase  competitiveness, 
prove worker satisfaction.  Perhaps most  interesting,  workers-by  a 3- 
to-I  margin-would  prefer a powerless  organization  that management 
cooperates  with  to  a powerful  organization  that management  does  not 
cooperate  with.  Freeman and Rogers  conclude  that workers want more 
cooperative  and participatory arrangements. 

Craig and Pencavel  pose  cooperatives  as an extreme  form of  partici- 
pation.  If cooperatives  do  not increase  productivity,  then lesser  forms 
of employee  participation will  not either. They then investigate  whether 
productivity  is higher among plywood  firms organized  as cooperatives 
than  among  traditional  (union  or  nonunion)  management-owned  ply- 
wood companies.  This is a sensible  hypothesis,  although one may ques- 
tion  whether the plywood  industry is the right place  to investigate  this 
hypothesis. 

I  suspect  employee  participation  helps  productivity  the  most  in  in- 
dustries  in which  technology  is  subject  to change,  and workers play  a 
role  in  developing  new  technology.  My  guess  is  that employee  coop- 
erative  or participatory  arrangements have  their greatest  payoff  when

workers are less inhibited about developing innovations because they 
don't fear losing their jobs from labor-saving innovations. The authors 
point out that technology in the plywood industry has been stable. In 
addition, the time trends in their production functions are usually insig- 
nificant, which suggests that technology has been stable. This makes 
me question the generality of testing their hypothesis in this industry. 
Nevertheless, Craig and Pencavel's work represents the most so- 
phisticated quantitative analysis of cooperative arrangements to date. 
And cooperatives in the plywood industry are the oldest and most du- 
rable cooperatives in all of U.S.  manufacturing. I liked their previous 
paper in the American Economic Review on this topic, and I like the 
current paper.2 

Many of  the questions I thought of  while reading this paper were 
answered later in the text. The authors free up coefficients; try different 
production functions; control for different combinations of inputs. In- 
deed, the best way to read this paper is from the back forward. Skip to 
the production functions (table 8). 

Craig and Pencavel's bottom line on productivity is that cooperatives 
may raise productivity by 6 to 14 percent over conventional firms. (They 
don't mention the much greater implied productivity effects when the 
classical mills' inputs are used as weights.) In addition, unionized mills 
are about as productive as classical mills. 

They provide several caveats in interpreting these results. I would 

add the following to the list: 

First, the sample sizes  are small, and thus the standard errors are 

big. There are only 34 plants and just 7 cooperatives in the sample. 

Second, the instrumental variables (IV) estimates are open to ques- 
tion. The instruments include prices and establishment dummies. But 
the establishment dummies may be correlated with the error components 
that the IV estimate is meant to overcome. Furthermore, the instrument 
list includes 34 establishment dummies and prices, with only  170 ob- 
servations. The first stage equation may overfit, since there are only 3 
or 4 degrees of freedom per moment estimated. I'm concerned about 
finite sample bias toward OLS in these estimates. (Indeed, the IV coef- 
ficients almost look "too"  much like the OLS coefficients.) 

Third, there is  the perennial problem of  whether the cooperatives 

2.  See Craig and Pencavel (1992). 


168 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

differ in unobserved ways,  on average,  from the noncooperatives.  Craig 
and Pencavel  discuss  this  issue,  and they try to control  for differences 
in capital,  and so  on.  But the type  of  capital  may differ.  For example, 
cooperatives  may work existing  capital longer  because  they take better 
care of  it.  The fact that the capital measure (lathe length)  has no effect 
on output makes  me  wonder  if  capital  is  adequately  controlled. 

Fourth,  quality  of  output may differ.  Since  cooperatives  may affect 

quality,  this issue  is  of  even  more importance. 

Lastly,  I  thought  it  would  be  useful  to  explore  the  union-classical 
mill  distinction  further.  There  have  been  many  establishment-level 
studies  of  the  effect  of  unions  on  productivity  in  other industries  (ce- 
ment,  construction,  and paper mills).  How  do the present results relate 
to  this  literature? How  can union  mills  stay  in business  if  they  pay  14 
percent  more than the  cooperatives  and classical  mills  but are only  as 
productive  as  the  classical  mills?  The  union  mills  look  like  the  coop- 
eratives  in many respects  (for example,  factor shares and size),  but why 
are they less  productive? Why do they have similar production functions 
and factor  shares? 

Craig and Pencavel  conclude,  "Worker participation has neither ma- 
I  found  this  conclusion 
jor  efficiency  gains  nor  efficiency  losses." 
rather bold  given  the  imprecision  of  the  estimates.  Moreover,  a  14 
percent  increase  in productivity  could  be considered  a major gain.  To 
achieve  this  large  a gain,  one  would  have  to increase  logs  by  some  30 
percent. 

One useful  standard of comparison  for the productivity  effect  would 
be  the estimated  productivity  effect  in the literature on profit sharing. 
Marty Weitzman  and Doug  Kruse  survey  this  literature and conclude 
that on average profit sharing raises productivity by about 4.5  percent.3 
This  is  a  small  but  significant  productivity  boost.  But  the  costs  are 
probably  not  very  big  either.  Craig  and Pencavel  find a  productivity 
effect  that is  substantially  larger. 

Another point they  make in the conclusion  that I found  provocative 
is the suggestion  that "nonreproducible  cultural factors"  are responsi- 
ble for the existence  of cooperatives  in plywood.  I call this provocative 
because  I couldn't  find the coefficient  that relates  to culture anywhere 
in  the  paper.  Nevertheless,  they  draw  a  caution  between  comparing

Japanese and American organizational  structures due to cultural differ- 
ences.  This  caution  is  probably  warranted, but it is  difficult  to  distin- 
guish  between  the  cultural  interpretation  and  multiple  equilibrium- 
alternative forms  of  organization  are possible  if everyone  is  doing  it. 
There  may  be  something  to  the  cultural  interpretation in  plywood, 
however.  If  this  is  the  case,  then  the  productivity  figure  of  6  to  14 
percent may be  an overstatement.

stable  over  this  period. 

Authors'  Response:  Henry Farber claims  our paper contains two  "puz- 
zles."  The  first puzzle  arises  from the fact that "the  real price of  logs 
rose by a factor of about 4 between  1960 and 1992,  while  the real price 
.  .  One  would  ex- 
of  plywood  was  relatively 
pect  the  product  price  to  increase  as  well."  There  is  no  puzzle  here. 
The depletion  of  first-growth timber forests  and the restrictions  on log- 
ging  due  to  environmental  concerns  caused  log  prices  in  the  Pacific 
Northwest  to  rise.  By  comparison,  the  price  of  plywood  output  was 
kept  down  by  the  entry of  new  mills  located  principally  in the  South. 
So  costs  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  have  risen,  output  prices  have  not 
changed  materially because  of the almost costless  entry of new mills  in 
other parts of the country,  and the industry in the Northwest  has shrunk 
drastically. 

Farber's second  "puzzle"  arises from the fact that, according to the 
estimates  of the output supply function  in table 9,  the estimated  output- 
price  elasticity  of  union  firms is  about 0.7.  Farber writes,  "The  sur- 
prising result here is that output of  union  firms is relatively  insensitive 
to price.  The  usual  view  of  union  firms is  that wages  are rigid  so  that 
all  adjustment must take place  in quantities.  That does  not seem  to be 
happening  here,  and this  is  a puzzle."  Why  is  an elasticity  of  output 
with  respect  to  output price  of  0.7  not compatible  with  adjustment of 
quantities? What supply  elasticity  would  be compatible? 

General  Discussion:  Several participants argued that the paper showed 
clear and striking differences  among  the cooperative,  union,  and clas- 
sical plywood  mill  types  that warrant additional analysis.  Henry Aaron 
pointed  out that classical  mills  differ  from  the other two  types  in that 
they are much smaller on average  and have  dramatically higher output 
per labor hour.  These  differences  suggest  enormous  heterogeneity  in 
the  industry,  he  said,  adding  that  the  classical  mills  might  really  be 


170 

Brookings Papers: Microeconomics 1995 

involved  in  a different  line  of  business.  Noting  that the three types  of 
firms appeared to use vastly  different production mixes,  Sam Peltzman 
wondered  whether  the  authors could  be  confident  in  drawing  conclu- 
sions  about level  differences  in their production functions. 

In  response,  Pencavel  agreed  that  average  ratios  of  labor  to  raw 
materials  were,  indeed,  quite  different  across  the three types  of  firms. 
The paper had gone  to  some  length  to  account  for these  differences  in 
the mean values,  he said.  In addition,  there are considerable  variations 
around these  means.  For example,  many of the observations  on the co- 
ops'  input  mixes  are  similar  to  the  average  values  of  the  unionized 
firms' input mixes  and,  similarly,  observations  on the unionized  firms' 
input  combinations  resemble  the  average  values  of  the  co-ops'  input 
combinations.  In general,  the observations  on the ratio of  labor to raw 
material inputs reveals  considerable  overlap  in these  input proportions 
across  firm types. 

After Frank Lichtenberg  noted that the returns to scale  differed  rad- 
ically  among  the three firm types,  Peter Reiss  argued that the produc- 
tivity  differences  among  them  might  be  largely  driven  by  this  factor, 
as  well  as  by  the  differences  in  their  input  mixes.  He  said  that  the 
authors could  separate out these effects  relatively  easily  with their pro- 
duction  functions. 

Considerable  discussion  surrounded the  possible  special  character- 
istics  of  cooperative  mills  that allow  them to be  more productive  than 
both union and classical  firms. F.M.  Scherer speculated  that the ethnic 
communities  from which the cooperatives  were formed might have been 
located  in remote  areas close  to virgin  forest  and,  as a result,  nearer to 
larger logs  than the  other  mills,  which  would  provide  an explanation 
for their higher output yields  per log.  Ben Craig disagreed,  arguing'that 
many  of  the  co-ops  are actually  in highly  settled  areas,  including  one 
each  in Tacoma  and Seattle;  conversely,  it is the classical  mills  which 
tend to be  in the most  remote  areas. 

Karl Scholz  suggested  that other factors  in  addition to  nonreprodu- 
cible  cultural factors  are a key  to the success  of  the cooperative  mills. 
He noted that studies have demonstrated that companies  with employee 
stock  ownership  plans  (ESOPs)  are slightly  (2 to  3 percent)  more pro- 
ductive  than traditional  firms.  The  paper's  results  showing  that coop- 
erative  mills  are on  average  6  to  14 percent  more  productive  than the 


Ben Craig and John Pencavel 

171 

other two types  are consistent  with such studies  because  co-op  workers 
usually  do not hold  all of  their firm's  equity  through ESOPs. 

Kathryn Shaw  wondered whether the  workers at cooperative plywood 
mills have adopted special management practices-such  as problem-solving 
teams or a high degree of  worker interaction-that  enable them to be  so 
productive and that might be transferable to noncooperative firms. Soci- 
ological  literature on  the  plywood  cooperatives,  Ben  Craig responded, 
generally shows  that their workers behave like  those in other companies 
and,  in  addition, that co-op  members and nonmembers at the same mill 
behave similarly. The literature does,  however,  argue that productivity in 
cooperatives  may  be  enhanced by  less  shirking and monitoring than in 
traditional firms. John Pencavel added that the cooperative mills are gen- 
erally dirtier and more dangerous than the others, possibly  because their 
workers regard themselves  as private entrepreneurs and are, as a conse- 
quence,  willing  to  take  greater risks  than those  in  conventional  firms. 
Hans Gersbach asked about the control mechanisms that the co-ops use to 
overcome  the  free-rider problem  and  reduce  shirking.  Craig  said  that 
workers can  easily  pick  out  shirkers and that disciplinary methods  for 
habitual shirkers can  ultimately  include  being  stripped of  the  right  to 
work-which 

forces the shirker to sell his share in the cooperative. 

Noting that the plywood  industry in the Northwest was  shrinking dra- 
matically  during the  period of  the  paper's  analysis,  Ariel  Pakes  asked 
about the role of cooperatives and unions in industry restructuring, partic- 
ularly with regard to firm mergers. Pencavel answered that, although the 
industry was moving to the South, little restructuring was actually occur- 
ring in the Northwest.  Craig added that, when co-ops  went under, it was 
typically because they had logged  out all of  their timber or because their 
land had become  so  valuable that they  decided  to  sell  it and divide  the 
proceeds  among  their  members.  Pencavel  noted  that most  logs  in  the 
Northwest are currently harvested from government-owned land. Paul Jos- 
kow asked whether any cooperatives had formed in the South. Craig said 
that,  although no  co-ops  had  sprung up  there,  three existing  mills  had 
gone co-op  in the Northwest in recent years,  despite the overall decline 
of the industry in that region. 

Questioning whether the output of the three types of mills is identical, 
Zvi Griliches asked if plywood is a genuinely homogenous product. Craig
