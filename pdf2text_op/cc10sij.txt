This research investigates the relationship between customer involvement, supplier
involvement, cross-functional department integration, and new product development
(NDP) in the ﬁnancial services industry. A survey tool was constructed and pre-
tested. A total of 125 effective questionnaires distributed to ﬁnancial services ﬁrms
in Taiwan were returned. We found that customer involvement has a signiﬁcant
positive effect on the NPD process and on cross-functional integration, whereas
cross-functional integration has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the NPD process.

Keywords: customer involvement; supplier involvement; cross-functional integration;

Introduction

The rapidly evolving environment of ﬁnancial services has forced ﬁrms to re-evaluate
their new product development (NPD) activities. NPD has thus become a signiﬁcant
strategic issue (Storey & Easingwood, 1993). Johne and Harborne (2003) have argued
that NPD is an important activity in ﬁnancial services. Both the NPD and the new
service development (NSD) literature identify a very wide range of factors for the effective
and efﬁcient management of projects.

To reach successful goals of NPD, customer co-production warrants much attention
(Vargo & Lusch, 2004). Firms cannot think and act unilaterally, and in the new paradigm
of marketing, the customer and the ﬁrm co-create value at various points of interaction
(Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004; Ramani & Kumar, 2008). Customers expect ﬁnancial ser-
vices institutions to increasingly customise their products and meet customers’ demands.
Therefore, the customer concept is the starting point for NPD marketing activities.

On the other hand, with the rapid development of technology, short product life cycles,
and the increase in management service outsourcing, a company should consider suppliers
as a key component of its NPD activities. In addition to developing new products by
cooperating with external organisations, it is beneﬁcial for cross-functional integration
of the process and performance of NPD (Perks & Riihela, 2004; Vermeulen & Dankbaar,
2002). Based on the research objective described earlier, this study further investigates
the impact of a key factor on NPD. The purpose of this study is to examine if factors
such as the degree of customer involvement, supplier involvement, and cross-functional
integration have an effect on the performance of ﬁnancial services. Therefore, this
study will examine the following:

Literature review

New product development

Developing new services in the ﬁnancial industry is organised in a sequential manner
(Liang & Wang, 2006; Vermeulen & Dankbaar, 2002). Such development processes
require long periods of time, and may lead to communication problems and increased
costs. To meet the ever-changing needs of customers, ﬁnancial services entrepreneurs
must be able to understand and analyse the current and future needs of customers in
order to continuously develop new products and services. Successful ﬁnancial services
and products provide income and proﬁts, and also beneﬁt the company’s reputation as
well as improve customer loyalty. They also impact market exploration positively
(Edgett, 1996). Many studies have examined factors that affect NPD success. Research
has also been performed on impact factors that affect the efﬁciency of management from
the NPD procedural point of view, including marketing knowledge, development tech-
nology, and display technology. Cross-department teamwork and effective leadership
have also been explored (Johne & Harborne, 2003; Storey & Easingwood, 1993).

Khurana and Rosenthal (1998) found that the central factor in NPD success is perform-
ance in the opening stages. Managers and researchers said that proﬁt brought by the
improvement of the early stage in NPD surpasses that derived from the planning and
design process (Chase & Tansik, 1983; Cooper & Kleinschmidt, 1994; Rosenau, 1988).
Planning in the early stages of NPD may affect decision making by the NPD team
during product design and production. Correct predictions made in the early stages of
NPD may also enable reductions in time and cost, as well as development of products
aimed more closely at consumer needs.

In summary, the main goal of NPD activity is to reduce uncertainty (Craig & Hart,
1992). Uncertainty and indeterminacy stem from the following causes: the external
environment, continuous development of new technology, changes in customer demand,
and the involvement of external entities, such as including customers, suppliers, and
strategic partners, in the NPD process (Gupta, Ray, & Wilemon, 1990). Khurana and
Rosenthal (1998) argued that the crucial factor for NPD success is the performance in
the early stages of NPD. Thus, in the NPD process, interactions with external entities
become more and more important.

The relationship between customer involvement and NPD success

A successful business strategy is likely to be one that empowers customers allowing them
to develop experiences with the company on their terms (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004;
Ramani & Kumar, 2008). From the perspective of the ﬁrm, customer involvement offers
information valuable in achieving ideal costs and time in production (Rothwell, 1994), and
in reducing the uncertainty during the innovation process (Gales & Mansour-Cole, 1995;
Leonard-Barton, 1995). Customer involvement reduces many kinds of uncertainties,
including those regarding the environment and user demand (Gales & Mansour-Cole,
1995).

Lengnick-Hall, Claycomb, and Inks (2000) pointed out that co-production provides
customers with the opportunity to experience service patterns, and indicated that customer
involvement changes the service experience that customers receive, which can be pre-
dicted as ‘delighted and satisfactory’. With effective co-production, customers have a
greater understanding of the company and its services. Vargo and Lusch (2004) also
proposed that the customer becomes primarily an operant resource (co-producer) rather
than an operand resource (target) and can be involved in the entire value and service
chain in acting on operand resources. Consequently, customer conceptions and partnership
with the company contribute to the NPD success.

Lengnick-Hall (1996) also observed that customers can invest resources such as
capital, natural resources, innovations, and other visible or invisible resources during
the production process. Valuable resources provide opportunity for the company, enabling
it to avoid risks, whereas rare resources facilitate the development of particular strategies.
Complicated resources create a product that is hard to imitate. If the company regards
customers solely as users, it will not be able to compete against ﬁrms that have more
robust views of customer roles (Schneider & Bowen, 1995).

Through the system input-transfer-output, Lengnick-Hall (1996) found that customers
play two roles in the input (upstream): customer’s resources and co-producer. Similarly,
customers play three roles in the output (downstream): buyer, user, and product consumer.
In other words, customers do not passively accept products made by producers. Instead, in
the early stages of the NPD process, customers directly or indirectly help shape events
by acting as both resource and co-producer. Thus, the customer is proved to make an
effective contribution to NPD and should be regarded as a potential and vital co-designer
and co-producer (Chase & Tansik, 1983; Lengnick-Hall, 1996).

Customers can make an effective contribution to NPD, as they are the key persons who
purchase the product. Accordingly, customer involvement in the NPD process can reduce
the uncertainty caused by customers. This yields the ﬁrst hypothesis:

H1: ‘Customer involvement’ has a positive effect on ‘NPD success’.

Relationship between supplier involvement and NPD success

Many ﬁrms have realised that supplier involvement in the NPD process may be beneﬁcial
to the quality and cost of the new service, and reduce development cost and time. Supplier
involvement may be seen in all the stages of the NPD process, from comments on design to
overall service development and design and detailed process (Wynstra & Pierick, 2000).
One issue of supplier involvement is determining the degree of supplier involvement
given several different suppliers. Such cooperation requires investment of time, effort, and
capital in negotiation. This problem is faced by both the supplier and the service ﬁrm.
Generally speaking, cooperation between supplier and customer results in superior
beneﬁts (Wynstra & Pierick 2000).

With the growth of environmental uncertainty, supplier involvement in the early stages
of the NPD process tends to become more common. With the wide variety of products, short
life cycle of services, severe competition, and ease of product imitation, the importance of
speed and innovation resources for NSD should be emphasised. The company should ﬁnd
ways to shorten the concept of development process, improve quality, reduce cost (Petersen,
Handﬁeld, & Ragatz, 2003), and further enhance the proﬁciency and success of NPD.
Handﬁeld, Ragatz, Peterson, and Monczka (1999) suggested that suppliers can be involved
in the NPD process at every stage, while Walter (2003) also argued that suppliers may be
involved in the innovation stage or even the product model stage.

S.-H. Chien and J.j. Chen

According to Walter (2003), suppliers usually have the ability to provide creative ideas
and to make new products (Liker, Sobek, Ward, & Cristiano, 1996). Further, supplier invol-
vement helps to avoid discrepancies between the product development plan and supplier
technology. Long before the new product is marketed, supplier involvement in the early
stages of NPD saves the waste of resources used in follow-up investments in manpower
and material resources, through the technology and cost information provided by suppliers.
In their study, Petersen et al. (2003) found that the more knowledge the supplier has, the
greater the beneﬁts derived from supplier involvement in NPD. Beneﬁts to NPD also
accrue when buyers have a greater understanding of suppliers. At the same time, it helps
with the sharing of technology and cost information. It is crucial to effectively integrate
business requirements with supplier capability.

Based on the above discussion, this study presents three sub-constructs of supplier
involvement: technology and cost information sharing, customer knowledge of suppliers,
and early supplier involvement. These three factors affect NPD success. Thus, the
following second hypothesis is established:

H2: ‘Supplier involvement’ has a positive effect on ‘NPD success’.

Relationship between cross-functional integration and NPD success

Severe competition drives industry NPD. Liker et al. (1996) observed that ﬁerce compe-
tition has driven the ﬁnancial industry to develop new services that are faster, better, and
less expensive. One strategy used in the NPD process was to enable the manufacturing,
marketing, and R&D departments to communicate directly through the operation of a
cross-functional team. The integration of R&D and marketing will determine NPD
success (Grifﬁn & Hauser, 1996).

Hong, Nahm, and Doll (2004) observed that NPD requires intensive cooperation
between the members of the cross-functional team. In order to create a successful new
service, it is necessary to tightly bind the upstream NPD departments, such as R&D, mar-
keting, and design engineering, with the downstream departments, such as manufacturing,
operations, and quality control. Thus, to reduce uncertainties in the internal and external
environments, departments with different functions should be effectively integrated.

The methods of cross-functional

integration affect NPD success. Accordingly,
Moenaert and Souder (1990) proposed the concept of role ﬂexibility. They contended
that NPD team members work on the tasks surpassing their own during the NPD
process. There are two kinds of role ﬂexibility: R&D role ﬂexibility, meaning R&D
members work on marketing activities; and marketing role ﬂexibility, meaning that
marketing members participate in R&D activities (Moenaert, Souder, De Mayer, &
Deschoolmeester, 1994).

Based on the foregoing research,

Relationships between customer involvement, supplier involvement, and
cross-functional integration

Product development managers typically assume that the uncertainties of NPD come
from the uncertain demand of customers, the nature of competition, and changeable

technology (Zhang & Doll, 2001). However, Gupta et al. (1990) held that such uncertainty
stemmed from increased global competition, the speed of NPD that results in accelerated
elimination of current products, changes in customer demand leading to shorter product
life cycles, and increased demand for involvement in NPD from internal and external
entities, such as customers, suppliers, and strategic alliances. With the rapid speed of
NPD and short development process, product design and testing often appear to
proceed concurrently, to cut development time so that management can focus on cross-
functional strategy (Khurana & Rosenthal, 1997). Finally, in order to lower uncertainty
and reduce time spent in the NPD process, involvement from external entities such as
customers and suppliers is necessary.

Customer involvement

Thomke and von Hippel (2002) identiﬁed certain difﬁculties in the NPD process, because
the information on demand comes from customers, while the resolution of the problem of
how to satisfy demand relies on manufactures. Therefore, customer involvement during
the NPD process is one common solution to the problem reducing uncertainty. Magnusson
(2003) also pointed out that users involved in the NPD process may be able to craft a
creative and valuable plan better than professionals. Through cross-functional integration,
R&D members have the opportunity to communicate directly with customers. Customer
ideas can then be a factor in the improvement of product design and commercialisation.
Lengnick-Hall (1996) also argued that there should be a method to handle customer
resources and to apply it in practical use.

Supplier involvement

According to Liker et al. (1996), ﬁerce competition is driving NPD. Since suppliers will be
involved in any new product manufacturing, many industries have determined that sup-
plier involvement in NPD is beneﬁcial to the quality and costs of the new product, as
well as to development costs and times.

Based on the above discussion, this study deﬁnes two sub-constructs in customer
involvement, customer resources and customer co-production. During the NPD process,
these two factors affect cross-functional integration. Three sub-constructs are deﬁned
in supplier involvement: timing of supplier involvement, sharing of cost and technology,
and customer knowledge. During the NPD process, these three factors affect cross-
functional integration. The following hypotheses are formed:

Measurement of NPD success

Zhang and Doll (2001) observed that previous studies on NPD had focused on different
subjects, but had mainly used the three variables to measure NPD success: process per-
formance, product effectiveness, and ﬁnancial performance.

(1) Process performance includes the formation of innovative ideas, along with the
examination and development of the ideas. The criteria that previous scholars
have used in measuring performance include (1) time to market, (2) engineering

change time, (3) product development cost, (4) team work, (5) opportunistic learn-
ing, and (6) supplier performance.

(2) Product effectiveness includes value, image, and ease of manufacture. The concept
of value intensiﬁes the goal for the company to develop high-quality products to
meet the expectation of customers. In the past, scholars used the following criteria
as a measurement: (1) product performance, (2) product cost, (3) value to custo-
mer, (4) design integrity, (5) product speciﬁcation ﬂexibility, and (6) product
manufacturability.

(3) Financial performance is broadly used because proﬁt, market share, return on
investment, and money ﬂow are the criteria most investors use. These criteria
include: (1) market share, (2) return on investment, and (3) proﬁt.

Generally speaking, three kinds of performance comparisons are used: comparison of
competitors with each other, comparison with previous organisations, and comparisons of
actual achievements with project goals. This study takes two dependent variables as the
measurement, process performance and ﬁnancial performance, of the success of a new
product.

The evaluation of new product performance lies in the proﬁt obtained from products
and services provided by the industry itself. Considering that customer demand changes
rapidly, providing a constant ﬂow of innovative products is crucial to industry growth.
Thus, NPD success is a key factor in the proﬁt-making ability of an industry.

Methodology

This study takes ﬁnancial services as its target and investigates the effect of supplier invol-
vement, customer involvement, and cross-functional integration in the NPD process on
NPD success.

Based on the foregoing literature review, we examine the following topics: (1) custo-
mer involvement on NPD success; (2) supplier involvement on NPD success; (3) cross-
functional integration on NPD success; (4) customer involvement on cross-functional inte-
gration; and (5) supplier involvement on cross-functional integration. The research frame-
work is shown in Figure 1.

Research design

The questionnaire was based on theories derived from the literature, as well as the research
purpose and hypotheses. The draft questionnaire was reviewed by a ﬁnancial expert and a
marketing scholar because we are examining the cross-functional items. After a pre-test of
34 clerks of a commercial bank investment and trust department, the 134 questionnaires
were revised.

Based on the literature review, this research provides a deﬁnition for each construct
(Table 1). All responses in this questionnaire were measured using a 7-point Likert
scale, 1 signifying total disagreement and 7 signifying complete agreement.

Participants in this research were corporations that emphasise marketing capabilities.
The research matrix is the number of ﬁnancial institutions announced on the website of the
Taiwan Central Bank in September of 2005, a total of 466, consisting of 430 local banks
and 36 foreign banks then operating in Taiwan. We then removed 280 ﬁnancial institutions
that dealt with special purpose ﬁnance, farmers associations, or deposit insurance, leaving
186 ﬁnancial institutions. Every ﬁnancial company almost owns three to six different NPD
projects, in this study we examined every company’s website to make sure they have had
NPD projects in the past year. Then we contacted the Public Relationship Department of
every ﬁnancial institution to distribute questionnaires to their own NPD project teams.

We sent out 638 questionnaires to be ﬁlled out by middle- or high-ranking company
managers responsible for NPD projects, including general managers, special assistants,
marketing managers, or assistant directors that they really join the NPD process. Each
NPD project team only received one questionnaire. We contacted the questionnaire reci-
pients by phone, and followed up with a conﬁrmation enquiry about 1 week after distri-
bution. To further enhance the return rate, we sent out the questionnaires again when
necessary.

The sampling process took place from October to November 2005. We received 134
team questionnaires, 9 of which were ineffective, leaving 125 effective team question-
naires for an effective return rate of 19.59% (Table 2). The results show the commercial

banks at 66.4% and foreign banks at 8%. Our sampling method was successful in returning
respondents with varied ﬁnancial service industry experience in Taiwan.

SPSS 15.0 was then used to perform factor analysis. The data were submitted to
factor analysis using principal components extraction and varimax rotation. An eigenvalue
greater than 1 was used. Table 3 shows the results of the factor analysis. Based on the
principal method, the research has found the most persuasive factor construct (Table 4).

Results
Structural equation modelling was used to perform the data analysis. The results yielded a
chi-square value of 19.073 (calculated by SPSS AMOS 5.0). As degrees of freedom ¼ 10,
the p-value ¼ 0.039, goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI) ¼ 0.968, root mean square residual
(RMR) ¼ 0.054, comparative ﬁt
index (CFI) ¼ 0.959, and adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt
index (AGFI) ¼ 0.857. Such results show that the structural model has good ﬁt (Table 5).

Effect of customer involvement on NPD success

In examining the relationship between customer involvement and NPD success, the hypoth-
eses proposed by this study were all veriﬁed. This is consistent with the results of many
similar studies. Customer involvement provides clues that enable the realisation of ideal
product development costs and time (Rothwell, 1994) and at the same time lower uncer-
tainty during NPD (Gales & Mansour-Cole, 1995; Leonard-Barton, 1995). Furthermore,
customer involvement can inspire the innovation process of the ﬁrm (Magnusson, 2003).
From the above discussion, it is clear that customer involvement has a signiﬁcant effect

on NPD success during the NPD process.

success, is supported in process performance. The other hypotheses were not conﬁrmed.
However, in some analyses, the sub-hypotheses are supported, with the exceptions that
the timing of supplier involvement has a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnancial performance and
the sharing of technology and cost information has a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnancial
performance. Such ﬁndings are also consistent with previous research results. Liker
et al. (1996) pointed out that offering the supplier appropriate responsibility to contribute
technological knowledge and innovation capability during the NPD process can enhance
NPD success. Furthermore, Kessler and Chakrabarti (1996) also stated that integrating
suppliers with a team can improve the provision of information, creation, and new
technology. When potential problems are identiﬁed and corrected, the time spent in the
NPD process will be shortened, improving the chances for NPD success. In general, the
advantages of supplier involvement in NPD have been recognised. Nevertheless, every
new product has differing degrees of innovation, so consideration of timing for supplier
involvement varies. Variations in timing also reﬂect the many kinds of professional
knowledge and cost information provided by suppliers. If suppliers understand more
about services implemented by customers, they are generally able to provide satisfactory
products and services.

The two hypotheses, timing of supplier involvement signiﬁcantly affects ﬁnancial per-
formance, and sharing of technology and cost information signiﬁcantly affects ﬁnancial
performance, were not conﬁrmed. NPD personnel focus on process performance from sup-
plier involvement, a point supported by the results of our analysis. However, NPD expec-
tations and best rewards rely on good ﬁnancial performance, which is also the motivation

for a company to proceed with NPD. As long as new products meet customer demand,
good ﬁnancial performance would be shown. Thus, in order to obtain good ﬁnancial per-
formance, the roles of NPD personnel as conceived by their managers should be taken into
consideration when deciding on making a new product. It is clear that supplier involve-
ment is vital to NPD success during the NPD process, especially to process performance.

Effect of cross-functional integration on NPD success

The hypotheses on the relationships between cross-functional integration and NPD success
proposed by this study were all veriﬁed and supported. The results were consistent with the
results of previous research. Grifﬁn and Hauser (1992, 1996) contended that integration of
R&D and marketing is essential to NPD success. Gupta, Ray, and Wilemon (1986) also
suggested that new product performance can be enhanced by the integration of cross-
functional departments. Accordingly, a ﬁrm should pay close attention to the integration
of different functional departments and rationalise the distribution of resources, so that
conﬂicts can be avoided. The departments within the company should have identical
goals, maintain a good working atmosphere, and eliminate self-centred ‘departmentalism’
so as to make the best contribution to the company. Cross-functional integration is
important to NPD success during the NPD process.

In examining the relationship between customer involvement and cross-functional inte-

integration. According to Figure 2, both the timing of
supplier involvement has a signiﬁcant effect on teamwork, and that the sharing of technol-
ogy and cost information has a signiﬁcant effect on teamwork are supported. It means that
during the NPD process, supplier involvement is helpful for cross-functional integration
and is especially advantageous in improving cooperation within the team. In other
words, searching for resources from external entities is helpful to cross-functional inte-
gration. For example, when there are different viewpoints occurring among identical func-
tional departments, an uninvolved third person can help to integrate a common view that is
not controversial.

All the hypotheses related to the relationship between customer involvement and
cross-functional integration were supported by the veriﬁcation. This indicates that custo-
mer involvement is beneﬁcial to cross-functional integration during the NPD process.
Analysis of the relationship between supplier involvement and cross-functional integration
shows that the timing of supplier involvement has a signiﬁcant effect on teamwork, and
that the sharing of technology and cost information has a signiﬁcant effect on teamwork,
are supported by the veriﬁcation. This shows that supplier involvement is beneﬁcial to
cross-functional integration during the NPD process, especially to the enhancement of
teamwork. In other words, seeking resource support from external entities generally has
a positive effect on cross-functional integration. The effect of supplier involvement on
role ﬂexibility is not signiﬁcant. This is probably because supplier contact persons are
largely from R&D, and they usually discuss professional and technological problems.
The content of

own ﬁelds. This is a problem R&D work must overcome. Clearly customer involvement
and supplier involvement are effective in promoting cross-functional integration.

This study investigates the effect of relevant member involvement, both inside and
outside, on NPD success during the NPD process. Outside involvement refers to customers
and suppliers, regarded as signiﬁcant external resources in NPD. Both supplier resources
such as product services and technology services, and resources provided by customers,
should be treated seriously by ﬁrms performing NPD. Customer resources are always criti-
cal in any industry, especially in service businesses. To customers, an intangible product
such as a service is a created demand. Such a demand can only be maintained through a
profound understanding of customers. Inside involvement refers to team members drawn
from within the ﬁrm, where good teamwork and role ﬂexibility are essential. In order to
improve NPD performance, the company should break the boundaries of different depart-
ments, and at the same time, search out external resources. If the industry is aware of the
changes and opportunities of the environment, and tries to integrate internal and external
resources, it will be able to create proﬁts for itself.

Discussion and conclusions

suppliers, and internal ﬁrm members, inside the cross-functional department, on NPD
success. Consequently,

intermediary, suggesting that the effect of customer involvement and supplier involvement
is signiﬁcant for NPD performance. With ﬁerce competition in the market, the rapid
changes in customer demand, and shortened product life cycles, NPD needs to be accel-
erated. One of the key factors in improving efﬁciency is the integration of personnel to
create a cross-functional team that is able to bring together different departments and
work with external entities such as customers and suppliers. For example, customer invol-
vement may be valuable when their departments have differing viewpoints. Successful
integration of the differing entities involved in the NPD process effectively enhances
NPD success.

Our study shows that there is considerable variation in the level of ‘customer involve-
ment’ or ‘customer co-production’ in the NPD process. Customer involvement exerts a
positive effect on NPD performance. Among the most common methods of customer inter-
action are opinion boxes or customer interviews. However, these only address part of the
problem. Customers do not have professional knowledge; they can simply express general
and personal feelings that provide references for future service improvement. Likewise,
responses collected by marketing members may give customers’ workable suggestions
and generally relate to marketing opinions. Such viewpoints are rather immature from
the professional perspective, and they are also the sources of conﬂict between different
departments. For instance, marketing may think a new product is not easy to promote.
To avoid such conﬂicts, the ﬁnancial service industry should intensify and broaden its
methodological approaches to customer surveys. Precise, detailed, and unique information
on customer needs and preferences may be particularly useful in the opening stages of the
NPD process.

The direction for future research, which has emerged from our ﬁnding, is to improve
our understanding of the NPD process in an organisation. For example, each successful
case of NPD will provide a good knowledge perspective on value creation in the ﬁnancial
services industry. A very promising research approach is the development of a model that
explains NPD inﬂuences variables such as knowledge management (Eriksson, Fjeldstad,
& Sasson, 2007), customer relationship management process (Eid, 2007), or interaction
orientation and ﬁrm performance (Ramani & Kumar, 2008).
