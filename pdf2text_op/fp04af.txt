Abstract

Unlike previous US environmental regulations, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), passed into law
in 1986, focused on using information as a tool for reducing pollution. As noted by Konar and Cohen
[Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 32 (1997) 109], if investors cared enough
about the pollution performance information required under the enactment to punish bad performers,
ﬁrms would have a market-based incentive to reduce toxic emissions. However, legitimacy theorists
suggest that corporations may use largely voluntary ﬁnancial report environmental disclosures to
offset or mitigate the negative aspects of other information or actions. Accordingly, these disclosures
could reduce the market effect of the TRI program. This study examines the market reaction to the
unexpected proposal by President George Bush in June of 1989 for revisions in the Clean Air Act to
identify whether TRI information and 10-K report environmental disclosures had an impact. Based
on a sample of 112 ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that companies with worse pollution performance (higher levels
of size-adjusted toxic releases into the air) suffered more negative market reactions than companies
with better performance. However, companies with less extensive environmental disclosures in their
10-K reports suffered more negative market reactions than companies with more extensive disclosure.
These results suggest that, while the TRI information may be inducing market effects that could in
turn work as a quasi-regulatory device, ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure reduces its impact. If
concern about the environment is important, therefore, it appears that environmental disclosure under
a largely voluntary regime is inadequate.

1. Introduction

The disclosure and dissemination of meaningful data to enable the populace to make
informed decisions has long been considered a cornerstone of democracy (see, e.g., Cohen,
1971, pp. 156–161). However, two major problems often arise in the provision of this infor-
mation. On the one hand, those that should be providing critical information may choose not
to make it available. To remedy this problem, regulators may require disclosure. In the United
States, for example, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
both have requirements with regard to ﬁnancial information disclosure by corporations (see,
Skousen, 1991, pp. 22–28). On the other hand, it is often necessary for users to sift through
masses of information to discover some semblance of meaningful data. Indeed, some infor-
mation disclosures may be made in an attempt to offset or mitigate the potentially negative
impact of required disclosures. In a sense, the interaction of these problems can be viewed
as an abundance of bad data overwhelming the good. Unfortunately, the disclosure, and
thus the potential use, of environmental information appears to suffer from these problems.
As noted by Gray and Bebbington (2000, p. 16), corporate environmental reporting takes
place under a largely voluntary regime.2 A number of studies over the past two decades
indicate that the emphasis of ﬁnancial report environmental disclosures is on providing
information that portrays the ﬁrms in a positive environmental light. Other research (e.g.,
Freedman & Wasley, 1990; Ingram & Frazier, 1980; Wiseman, 1982) further indicates that
the extent of environmental disclosure is not associated with actual environmental perfor-
mance. And even though recent studies (e.g., Blacconiere & Northcut, 1997; Blacconiere
& Patten, 1994; Patten & Nance, 1998) provide evidence that the market appears to reward
companies for higher environmental disclosure, at least in periods of regulatory threat, there
has been little or no concern expressed in the mainstream accounting research journals with
the apparent use of ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure to manipulate public (or at
least market) perceptions. Perhaps this is due to a belief that such manipulation does not
create any real harm. This study suggests otherwise.

This investigation examines the extent to which pollution performance information avail-
able through the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)
program inﬂuenced market reactions to President George Bush’s 1989 proposal for sub-
stantial changes in the Clean Air Act.3 The results, based on a sample of 112 ﬁrms, indicate
that companies with worse pollution performance suffered more negative market reactions
than ﬁrms with lower releases. However, results also indicate voluntary ﬁnancial report
environmental disclosure appears to mitigate the negative impacts of actual performance
information. This suggests that if concern about environmental degradation is important
(see, e.g., Gray & Bebbington, 2000), environmental reporting under a largely voluntary
regime is not adequate. This study begins with more detailed information on the TRI pro-
gram.

2 For example, in the US, publicly traded companies are required to present only limited environmental infor-
mation in their ﬁnancial reports. For an overview of these requirements see Surma and Vondra (1992) or Zuber
and Berry (1992).

3 Blacconiere and Northcut (1997) provide evidence that at least some proposed environmental regulations

appear to inﬂuence market valuations for potentially affected ﬁrms.

2. Background and hypothesis development

2.1. The impact of TRI information

In 1986 the US Congress passed legislation that signiﬁcantly changed the focus of pollu-
tion prevention. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA),
a subset of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, contained provisions for
a new program of pollution reporting. The TRI program, for the ﬁrst time, required “large
manufacturing facilities to ﬁle annual reports on routine releases and transfers of several
hundred toxic chemicals found in wastes” (Wolf, 1996, p. 229). The initial TRI reports
were required for year 1987 releases, and the ﬁrst compilation of the data was made pub-
licly available in April of 1989. As noted by the EPA (1994, p. 14), “this information can
allow the public to identify potential concerns . . . and work with industry and government
to reduce toxic chemical releases.”

Konar and Cohen (1997, p. 109) refer to this new approach to pollution prevention as
“information as regulation.” They note (p. 110) that such an approach “will only work,
however, if the “public” cares enough about the information being released to “punish”
ﬁrms that are bad actors” (Konar and Cohen’s emphasis). While it is possible that some
investors might choose to “punish” highly polluting ﬁrms on ethical grounds, a more likely
explanation for the TRI information having a negative market impact centers on cash ﬂow
effects. Firm speciﬁc emissions data would appear to have value for revising the likelihood
that worse performing companies will have to incur future cash ﬂows related to improving
pollution technologies or paying ﬁnes or penalties for non-compliance. Thus, the TRI in-
formation can lead to market effects, which, in turn, could serve as incentives for ﬁrms to
improve their pollution performance.

The ﬁrst aspect of this study is to identify whether the market does indeed use TRI
information for investment decisions. Both Hamilton (1995) and Khanna et al. (1998) al-
ready provide evidence that the release of TRI data appeared to impact market values
for at least some ﬁrms. It is posited here, however, that TRI pollution performance in-
formation could also be relevant to market decisions in response to the threat of new
environmental regulations. If this information does work as a quasi-regulatory mecha-
nism, it is expected that investors would “punish” companies with worse performance
as measured by TRI releases, and accordingly these ﬁrms would suffer more negative
market value adjustments in response to the regulatory threats than ﬁrms with better per-
formance.

In order to examine the role of TRI data in an investment setting, this study examines
the market reaction to President Bush’s unexpected June 1989 proposal for amendments
to the 1970 Clean Air Act. Although some discussion of environmental policy was cited
in the business press prior to the formal Bush proposal,4 the plan itself was ﬁrst revealed
on 12 June 1989 and reported in the business press on the13th and 14th. Importantly, the

4 A review of The Wall Street Journal Index for 1988 and 1989 revealed that environmental policy-related
articles ran on 14 March, 12 May and 3 June of 1989. A review of these articles indicated that none addressed the
forthcoming Bush proposal.

plan represented a signiﬁcant departure from then-existing air pollution policy and it was
expected to have major impacts on industry in the United States.5

Because companies with worse pollution performance would presumably suffer greater
regulatory costs as a result of the Amendments, it is assumed market participants would
value actual performance data at this time. If so, and if the TRI information works as a
quasi-regulatory mechanism, it is hypothesized that companies with worse pollution perfor-
mance would suffer more negative market impacts than companies with better performance
at the time of Bush’s announcement. Formally, this hypothesis (in alternative form) is stated
as follows.

H1. Ceteris paribus, companies with worse air pollution performance, as measured by TRI
release data, will suffer more negative market reactions to the announcement of President
Bush’s proposal for changes to the Clean Air Act than companies with better air pollution
performance.

2.2. The impact of ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure

Of course, TRI data is not the only environmental information that was available in the
market at the time of the Bush proposal for changes in the Clean Air Act. This study is partic-
ularly concerned with the environmental information voluntarily provided by corporations
in their ﬁnancial reports. As noted in numerous studies (e.g., Freedman & Stagliano, 1991;
Gamble et al., 1995; Walden & Schwartz, 1997) the extent of this environmental disclosure
varies substantially across ﬁrms. Legitimacy theorists (e.g., Lindblom, 1994; O’Donovan,
1999; Patten, 1991, 1992; Walden & Schwartz, 1997) argue that companies use ﬁnancial
report environmental disclosure as a tool to address their exposure to social and political
pressures. As argued by Neu et al. (1998, p. 268), environmental disclosure offers “orga-
nizations a way to sustain organizational legitimacy without necessarily (their emphasis)
changing organizational modes of operation.”

There is at least some support for this view of disclosure as a manipulative device. To
illustrate, Deegan and Rankin (1996) examined the environmental disclosures for a sample
of 20 Australian companies that had been successfully prosecuted for environmental viola-
tions. They report that only two of the ﬁrms disclosed the existence of the offence, and more
interestingly, that for all companies in the sample, the amount of positive environmental
disclosure was signiﬁcantly greater than the amount of negative disclosure. These results
are consistent with the ﬁndings of Patten (2000), a study of US companies that shows that
ﬁrm-speciﬁc increases in disclosure pertaining to Superfund exposures from the mid-1980s

5 According to articles in The Wall Street Journal (Gutfeld, 1989; Rosewicz, 1989) and The New York Times
(Stevenson, 1989), the Bush proposal would force manufacturing companies to reduce toxic industrial pollutants
released into the air from their plants from 75 to 90% by requiring state-of-the-art technology to control releases
of certain carcinogens and other toxic fumes. About 190 toxic substances were targeted for control under the plan,
a substantial increase from the seven that were being governed at that time. Estimates of the cost of the increased
standards ranged from US$ 14 billion to 18 billion per year, approximately a 50% increase in pollution control
spending. The Bush proposal apparently signaled a major change in the probability that environmental policy
would be toughened. To illustrate, Cahan et al. (1989, p. 60) in 26 June Business Week story noted that “the Bush
proposal . . . could break the logjam that has paralyzed clean air legislation for more than a decade.”

to the mid-1990s were signiﬁcantly correlated with ﬁrm-speciﬁc increases in the provi-
sion of non-negative environmental information over the same time period. Finally, Patten
(2002) documents a signiﬁcant correlation between company speciﬁc levels of pollution as
identiﬁed in early TRI reports and increases in the extent of ﬁnancial report environmental
disclosure for those ﬁrms.

Deegan and Rankin (1996) and Patten (2000, 2002) all suggest companies use envi-
ronmental disclosure as a manipulative device rather than as a tool for full disclosure of
actual performance. Indeed, numerous studies (e.g., Freedman & Jaggi, 1982; Freedman
& Wasley, 1990; Ingram & Frazier, 1980; Wiseman, 1982) have examined the relation
between environmental performance and environmental disclosure, and none reports a sig-
niﬁcant association. In spite of the lack of correlation between performance and disclosure,
there is at least some evidence that the market rewards companies including higher levels
of environmental information in their ﬁnancial reports, particularly at times of increased
regulatory threat.

Previous studies (e.g., Bowen et al., 1983; Dowdell et al., 1992) suggest that events that
increase potential regulatory costs have a negative impact on the market value of affected
ﬁrms. Within this body of literature, three recent studies, Blacconiere and Northcut (1997),
Blacconiere and Patten (1994), and Patten and Nance (1998), examine the role ﬁnancial
report environmental information plays in the market reaction to increased regulatory costs
arising from environmentally related events.

Blacconiere and Patten (1994) examine the market reaction for a sample of 47 US chem-
ical ﬁrms following the 1984 Bhopal chemical leak. Using a ﬁve-point content analysis
scheme, Blacconiere and Patten show that ﬁrms with more extensive environmental dis-
closure in their 10-K reports prior to the accident suffered less negative market reactions
than companies with less extensive ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure.6 In a similar
study, Patten and Nance (1998) examine the market returns for a sample of US petroleum
companies following the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989. Although
the overall market reaction for the portfolio of sample ﬁrms was positive, cross-sectional
analysis showed that ﬁrms with less extensive ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure
prior to the spill suffered more negative market reactions than ﬁrms with more extensive
disclosure.7 Both Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Patten and Nance (1998, p. 417)
suggest that the market value of the environmental information may be a function of
investor interpretation of a lack of disclosure as a signal of exposure to environmental
risk.

While the results presented by Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Patten and Nance
(1998) suggest that the market does value ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure at times
of potentially increased regulatory costs, it seems logical that information related to actual
environmental performance would be more valuable. Unfortunately, neither study included

6 They also found that ﬁrms with greater concentration in the chemical industry, as measured by the ratio of

chemical segment sales to total sales, suffered more negative market reactions to the Bhopal chemical leak.

7 Patten and Nance attribute the positive reaction to substantially increased gasoline prices immediately fol-
lowing the oil spill. They argue their ﬁndings of less negative returns for companies with higher environmental
disclosure and more negative returns for companies with operations in Alaska and for larger ﬁrms are evidence
that regulatory cost effects did inﬂuence the market reaction.


32

any measure of actual environmental performance, and neither examined any other type of
environmental information. Thus, it is not clear to what extent ﬁnancial report environmental
disclosures might have market value in the presence of other, potentially more meaningful,
environmental information.

In contrast to Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Patten and Nance (1998), Blacconiere
and Northcut (1997) do include other, non-ﬁnancial report, environmental information
in their analysis of the market reaction to a series of events leading up to and includ-
ing the passage of SARA in 1986. More speciﬁcally, Blacconiere and Northcut use EPA
data regarding Superfund investigations as surrogates for the ﬁrm speciﬁc liability aris-
ing from Superfund-related hazardous waste remediation requirements.8 Blacconiere and
Northcut also examine the impact of ﬁnancial
report environmental disclosure
using the same ﬁve-point content analysis scheme used in Blacconiere and Patten
(1994).

While Blacconiere and Northcut (1997) provide evidence that the EPA data regarding Su-
perfund exposures is signiﬁcantly, and negatively, related to market reactions to the SARA
events, their results regarding the value relevance of ﬁnancial report environmental disclo-
sure are, at best, inconclusive. Although, consistent with the mitigating impact reported in
Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Patten and Nance (1998), the analysis indicates a signif-
icant positive relation between the extent of disclosure and market reactions where the full
ﬁve-point scale is used, the variable is not signiﬁcant when environmental litigation-related
disclosures are excluded (Blacconiere & Northcut, p. 169). This suggests that it may be the
litigation-related information that is driving the overall result. This would be consistent with
the arguments of Campbell et al. (1996) who suggest that higher levels of disclosure about
environmental liabilities offset the negative valuation effects related to liability estimates
based on EPA data (see Blacconiere & Northcut, 1997, p. 173). As such, rather than the
ﬁnancial report non-litigation environmental disclosures serving as a “positive signal con-
cerning the ﬁrm’s exposure to environmental risk” (Blacconiere & Northcut, p. 150), the
ﬁndings reported in Blacconiere and Northcut may be due to the lessened uncertainty with
regard to Superfund liability due to litigation-related disclosures. This would then suggest
that in the presence of other, more relevant environmental information, non-negative ﬁnan-
cial report environmental disclosures do not appear to reduce regulatory cost concerns in the
marketplace.

The issue of whether ﬁnancial report environmental disclosures serve to mitigate nega-
tive market reactions to regulatory threats is particularly important where an information
as regulation pollution prevention strategy is being employed. Under this approach the
public exposure of poorer environmental performance is supposed to lead to market pres-
sures (negative market adjustments) that will serve as an incentive to change pollution
performance. But if companies can manipulate market perceptions through the provision
of ﬁnancial report environmental disclosures, the negative impacts of the performance data
will be weakened. To the extent that market reaction pressures do impact subsequent ef-
forts at pollution prevention (see Konar & Cohen, 1997 for evidence that they do), such a
manipulation can be viewed as bad for the environment.

8 This was consistent with the measures used by Barth and McNichols (1994).

The unexpected proposal for the changes in the Clean Air Act would appear to have
signaled an increase in potential regulatory costs for affected ﬁrms. As such, in addition
to studying the impact of the TRI pollution performance information, the examination also
represents an opportunity to identify whether non-negative ﬁnancial report environmental
disclosures continue to have information content when more speciﬁc environmental per-
formance data is available. Given the ﬁndings of previous studies in conjunction with the
discussion outlined above, it is not clear what impact these disclosures may have in the
presence of other, presumably more relevant, environmental information. Accordingly, this
hypothesis is stated in null form as follows.

H2. Ceteris paribus, the level of ﬁrm speciﬁc ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure
will not be signiﬁcantly associated with market reactions to the announcement of President
Bush’s proposal for changes to the Clean Air Act.

3. Research method and results

3.1. Sample

In order to be included in the sample, companies had to:

1. be included on the EPA’s listing of the top 500 toxics releasing companies for 1987;
2. have return data available on the daily CRSP tape;
3. not have a potentially confounding news release surrounding the test period; and
4. have a 1988 10-K report available for review.

Of the 494 companies included on the EPA’s listing of top toxics releasing ﬁrms (six
companies were listed in two different places9), only182 had CRSP data available for the
entire estimation and test period. A review of The Wall Street Journal Index indicated that
31 of these companies had potentially confounding news releases in the interval from 2
days before through 2 days after the test period. These ﬁrms were eliminated from the
analysis. The remaining 151 companies were contacted with a request for their 1988 10-K
report. Thirty-nine companies did not provide the 10-K report. Accordingly, the ﬁnal sample
consisted of 112 ﬁrms.10 The sample companies ranged in size (based on 1988 revenues)
from US$ 279 million to 84,116 million with a mean (median) of US$ 3382 million (US$
3375 million). The companies were spread across 22 two-digit SIC codes. The largest
concentration of ﬁrms from a single industry was 19 companies from the 26xx (pulp and
paper) industry.

9 Two of these ﬁrms were sample ﬁrms. For these two companies the TRI releases were calculated by adding
together the two amounts listed. In order to assure that the results were not driven by this information two additional
tests were performed. First, the TRI measures were recalculated using only the larger of the two release amounts.
Second, all tests were repeated deleting these two companies. Results, not presented here, were qualitatively
comparable to those reported in the paper.

10 To test for potential bias effects, the mean market reaction for the 39 companies not providing 10K reports was
compared to the reaction for the 112 sample ﬁrms. The difference in mean CARs was not statistically signiﬁcant.

3.2. Test period

President Bush’s proposal for changes in the Clean Air Act was ﬁrst revealed through a
press conference on 12 June 1989, and reported in the business press in stories the following
2 days (13 and 14 June).11 As such, this study examines the change in market value for the
sample ﬁrms over the 3-day period centered on the press release date (designated as day 0).

3.3. Cross-sectional analysis

The ﬁrst goal of this study was to identify whether ﬁrm speciﬁc differences in the change
in market value surrounding the announcement of changes in the Clean Air Act were
inﬂuenced by the TRI pollution performance information. The change in market value was
measured using daily market model methods (see, e.g., Blacconiere & Patten, 1994; Brown
& Warner, 1985).
The individual ﬁrm 3-day CARs12 ranged from −5.79 to 15.28% with a mean of 0.172%.
This indicates that, on average, the market impact on the sample ﬁrms was not negative.
There are two potential explanations for this result. First, it is possible the market anticipated
that any changes to the Clean Air Act would be more stringent and costly than what Bush
proposed. As such, the announcement of Bush’s plan could have been seen as relatively good
news in general, although still negative for ﬁrms that were worse performers. Second, and
perhaps related, the sample for this study, while drawn from the EPA’s list of top releasing
ﬁrms, includes companies that were relatively better performers than other sample ﬁrms.
Because the Clean Air Act amendments would impose presumably greater proprietary costs
on the worse performers, the market could have interpreted the announcement as good news
for the better performing companies. Indeed, the results presented below are consistent with
such an interpretation. Of course, it must also be noted that the intent of this study is not on
identifying whether the Clean Air Act announcement had an overall negative impact, but
rather, on the role available information played in cross-sectional differences in the market
reaction.

Individual ﬁrm pollution performance was based on the pounds of toxic chemicals re-
leased into the air during 1987 as reported in the 1987 Toxics Release Inventory. This
information ﬁrst became available in April of 1989. However, because, ceteris paribus,
larger ﬁrms would be expected to have higher release levels than smaller ﬁrms, the release
ﬁgures were divided by 1987 revenue levels for each ﬁrm to yield a size-adjusted measure.
The size adjusted release levels ranged from 0.59 to 995.9 with a mean (median) of 29.15
(12.73). These ﬁgures are stated at 104 for ease of presentation.

11 A review of The Wall Street Journal Index for 1988 and 1989 revealed that pollution policy-related articles
also ran on 14 March, 12 May, and 3 June of 1989. However, a review of these articles indicated that none of
them contained any information related to Bush’s ultimate proposal. Thus, it appears that the announcement and
its contents were unanticipated in the business press.
12 To assure that the results were not merely a function of the event period chosen, all tests were repeated using
CARs from day 0 only, from days −1 and 0, and from days 0 and +1. In general, all relations were in the correct
direction using the day 0 CARs but were not statistically signiﬁcant. When the CARs from the 2-day observation
periods were used all relations were in the correct directions and were statistically signiﬁcant although at lower
conﬁdence levels than for the results presented in the paper.

Results from Patten (1998) suggest that the impact of the TRI data as a measure of
pollution performance may be relative rather than absolute. Accordingly, rather than using
the raw size adjusted TRI measures, the natural log of the size-adjusted measures is used
instead.13 Because companies with higher releases are assumed to be more negatively
impacted by the announcement of the proposed changes in the Clean Air Act, a negative
relation to the CARs is predicted.

First, and similar to Blacconiere and Patten (1994), correlation coefﬁcients were com-
puted to identify the relation between the ﬁrm speciﬁc CARs and the ﬁrm speciﬁc TRI
release measures. Both parametric (Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁcients) and
non-parametric (Spearman’s rho rank correlation coefﬁcients) results are presented in panel
A of Table 1. As noted in the table, both parametric and non-parametric correlation coef-
ﬁcients were negative and statistically signiﬁcant (at P < 0.01, one-tailed). Second, and
again consistent with Blacconiere and Patten (1994), the mean CAR for companies at the
high end of the variable spectrum (companies with the highest levels of size adjusted TRI
releases) was compared to the mean CAR for companies at the low end of the spectrum.
Results, again presented in panel A of Table 1, show that the mean CAR for the 20 sam-
ple ﬁrms with the highest size adjusted TRI releases was −0.50% in comparison to a
mean CAR of +1.28% for the 20 ﬁrms with lowest size adjusted TRI release levels. This
difference in means is statistically signiﬁcant (at P = 0.001, one-tailed, using the para-
metric t-test, and at P = 0.002, one-tailed using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test).

13 Tests were repeated using the ranking based on the size-adjusted releases (similar to Patten, 1998). Results
were qualitatively unchanged from those presented in the paper. Tests were also repeated using the raw size
adjusted TRI ﬁgures. While the TRI information continued to be negatively associated with market reactions, it
was not signiﬁcant at conventional levels.

Overall, these tests suggest that the TRI release information appears to have inﬂuenced
the market reaction to the announcement for changes in the Clean Air Act. As hypothe-
sized, companies with worse pollution performance, on average, suffered more negative
unexpected market returns surrounding the announcement than ﬁrms with better pollution
performance.

The second aspect of this study focuses on whether non-negative ﬁnancial report en-
vironmental disclosure continues to serve a mitigating impact in the presence of other
ﬁrm speciﬁc environmental performance information. Similar to Blacconiere and Northcut
(1997), Blacconiere and Patten (1994), and Patten and Nance (1998), content analysis was
used to identify the extent of disclosure. More speciﬁcally, the 1988 10-K report for each
of the sample ﬁrms was reviewed for the presence or absence of statements related to eight
different areas of environmental information. The areas chosen were based on a review of
other studies using content analysis (e.g., Freedman & Wasley, 1990; Gamble et al., 1995;
Wiseman, 1982), and are identiﬁed in Table 2. The emphasis was on identifying disclo-
sures that could be interpreted as presenting the company in a positive environmental light
(e.g., “the company is in compliance with environmental regulations”) or that could de-
ﬂect attention away from negative environmental aspects of ﬁrm behavior (e.g., disclosures
regarding capital expenditures or operating costs for pollution control or abatement). As
such, disclosures relating to environmental litigation or liability were not included in this
measure.14

Each of the sample companies’ 1988 10-K report was independently reviewed by one of
the project co-authors and a trained assistant. One point was awarded for each disclosure
area included in the 10-K report. As such, disclosure scores could range from 0 to 8. All
differences in coding across the two reviewers were discussed and reconciled. Actual content
analysis scores ranged from 0 to 7 with a mean (median) of 2.39 (2).

The relation of the ﬁrm speciﬁc environmental disclosure scores to the ﬁrm speciﬁc
changes in market value surrounding the Clean Air Act announcement was ﬁrst examined
at the univariate level. These results are presented in panel B of Table 1. Both parametric
and non-parametric correlation coefﬁcients measuring the relation between the ﬁrm-speciﬁc
CARs and the content analysis scores were positive and statistically signiﬁcant. Further,

14 As noted below, a litigation disclosure variable identifying those sample companies with litigation disclosures

in their 1988 10-K reports was included in the multivariate tests.

the mean CAR for the 22 sample companies with disclosure scores of ﬁve or higher was
0.64% in contrast to the mean CAR of −1.18% for the 17 ﬁrms with disclosure scores
of zero. This difference in means is also statistically signiﬁcant (at the P = 0.001 level,
two-tailed, using a parametric t-test, and at the P = 0.002 level, two-tailed, using the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney test). The ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant positive relation between
ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure and market reactions is consistent with the results
of Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Patten and Nance (1998) where no ﬁrm speciﬁc
measures of environmental performance were available, and suggests that the ﬁnancial
report environmental disclosures served to mitigate the negative impact of the regulatory
threat.

In addition to the univariate tests, ordinary least squares regression analysis was used
to test the relation between the environmental information variables and the ﬁrm speciﬁc
market reactions in a multivariate setting. Also included in this model is a variable identify-
ing companies including litigation-related environmental disclosures in their 10-K reports.
These disclosures also represent publicly available information and might have been used
in the market as a measure of potential cost resulting from the Clean Air Act proposal.
Two different aspects of litigation disclosure are considered for this measure. They are ﬁrst,
disclosures relating to the ﬁrm being subject to hazardous waste remediation investigations
(Superfund disclosures), and second, disclosures of actions related to operating activities.
Companies with no litigation disclosures were coded zero, ﬁrms with only hazardous waste
remediation disclosures were coded one, companies with only operating investigation dis-
closures were coded two, and ﬁnally, ﬁrms with both hazardous waste remediation and
operating investigation disclosures were coded three.15 If the market associates these dis-
closures with higher future costs due to the proposed legislation, a negative relation with
CAR would be expected.

Results of the regression analysis are presented in Table 3. As noted in the table, the overall
model is highly signiﬁcant (as based on model F-statistic), and the adjusted R2 is 0.110.
Consistent with the univariate results, the log TRI variable is negatively associated with
the dependent variable and is statistically signiﬁcant at the P = 0.001 level, one-tailed.
Further, and again consistent with the univariate results, the DISC variable continues to
be positively and signiﬁcantly (at P = 0.014, two-tailed) related to CAR.16 Finally, the
litigation disclosure variable is not statistically signiﬁcant.

15 In essence, the interpretation here is that investors might view the presence of negative environmental infor-
mation as an indicator of worse overall environmental performance. It should be noted that the regulatory cost
effect in this study is not Superfund or hazardous waste remediation related. As such, in contrast to the ﬁndings
reported in Blacconiere and Northcut (1997) disclosures about Superfund investigations would not be expected
to have valuation effects resulting from reduced uncertainties. They might, however, signal a general level of
environmental performance. Because operating investigations relate to the types of operational activities that are
the subject of the Clean Air Act Amendments, these disclosures are scored as a higher level of poor environmental
performance. Alternative scoring schemes, as well as separate analyses using separate measures for the litigation
areas were also tested. Results, in all cases, were qualitatively similar to the results reported in the paper.
16 To test for potential interactive effects, a regression model including an interactive term (DISC× log TRI) was
also estimated. The interactive variable was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.420, two-tailed). Further, models controlling
for potential heteroscedasticity across the independent variables (see Judge et al., 1982, pp. 414–415) were also
estimated. Results were consistent with those presented in the paper.

3.4. Further tests

While the results above suggest that the environmental information variables were sig-
niﬁcantly associated with the change in market value for the sample ﬁrms, it is possible
that the relations were actually due to an association with some omitted, but correlated
variable. In an attempt to address this concern a regression model with several additional
control variables was also estimated. These control variables included ﬁrm size (the log of
1988 revenues), industry classiﬁcation (1/0 variable where 1 indicates the ﬁrm operates in
an environmentally sensitive industry), and a 1/0 variable (designated PrvNeg) indicating
ﬁrms that had experienced negative market reactions to the initial release of the TRI data
in April of 1989.17

The results for the analysis controlling for other potential impact variables are presented in
Table 4.18 While none of the additional variables are statistically signiﬁcant, both the log TRI
variable and the DISC variable remain highly signiﬁcant when these other potential factors

17 Prior to the release of the TRI data there were no wide-scale measures of pollution performance publicly
available. The ﬁrst compilation of the TRI information (for 1987 releases) was made publicly available on 12
April 1989. Because the overall releases were higher than expected (see, e.g., Wolf, 1996), it is possible that the
market could have anticipated at that point that ﬁrms with worse performance would be facing higher regulatory
costs in the future. If so, the market values for these ﬁrms would have been negatively impacted surrounding the
release of the TRI information. This in turn may have mitigated some of the negative impact of the announcement
for changes in the Clean Air Act.

18 In addition to the model including all three of the additional control variables, models were also estimated
using each control variable separately as well as all combinations of two of the variables. In no cases were any
of the control variables signiﬁcant at conventional levels. Further, in all cases the log TRI and DISC variables
remained statistically signiﬁcant and the LIT variable remained insigniﬁcant.

These results provide further support for the interpretation that the market impounded both
types of ﬁrm speciﬁc environmental information into the reaction to the announcement of
proposed changes to the Clean Air Act.

4. Discussion

The primary focus of this study was to examine the role environmental information plays
in market decisions at times of increases in potential regulatory costs. The ﬁrst goal was to
identify whether TRI pollution performance information, as planned, induces market effects
that may ultimately work as a quasi-regulatory mechanism. Based on a sample of 112 US
ﬁrms, the study ﬁnds that companies with higher levels of toxic air releases (adjusted for
ﬁrm size) as reported in the 1987 TRI report tended to suffer more negative market reactions
to President George Bush’s unanticipated June 1989 proposal for changes in the Clean Air
Act than ﬁrms with better performance records. These results indicate that, at least with
respect to this announcement, the TRI information did appear to inﬂuence market reactions.
However, this study also examines whether, consistent with the results of other recent
investigations, ﬁnancial report environmental disclosures appear to mitigate negative market

reactions to increased regulatory costs. Using an eight-point content analysis scheme the
study documents that ﬁrms with lower levels of environmental disclosure in their 1988
10-K reports suffered more negative market reactions to Bush’s proposal than ﬁrms with
higher levels of disclosure. As such, this study provides additional evidence that the market
does reward higher ﬁnancial report environmental disclosure at times of regulatory threat.
This ﬁnding further suggests that corporations may be using ﬁnancial report environmental
disclosure as a tool to manipulate market perceptions and reduce the negative impacts of
actual pollution performance.19 Market-based incentives to reduce pollution will be most
effective if the downward revision in market value is sufﬁcient to outweigh the costs of
implementing changes in performance. This study shows that, at least in the case of the
proposal for changes in the Clean Air Act, companies’ use of disclosure may have reduced
that market impact. To the extent that this, in turn, may have lowered incentives for changing
actual performance, the disclosure must be seen as bad for the environment. Accordingly, it
may be time to reconsider the largely voluntary regime under which environmental reporting
currently exists.

19 An alternative explanation for the less negative market reactions for ﬁrms with higher disclosure scores is
that the disclosures are signals of ﬁrms’ valid attempts to control pollution. Of course, as noted previously, prior
studies (e.g., Ingram & Frazier, 1980; Wiseman, 1982) failed to document any relation between disclosure and
performance. Further, a comparison of the change in air emissions from 1987 to 1995 (using data from the TRI)
for sample ﬁrms with high (greater than or equal to 4) and low (0 or 1) disclosure scores indicates no signiﬁcant
difference in future performance.
