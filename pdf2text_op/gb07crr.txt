  ABSTRACT 
 Prior  studies  of  corporate  reputation  have 
looked broadly at the relationship between cor-
porate  reputation  and  corporate  performance. 
In  this  paper,  we  take  a  more  fine-grained 
approach. In particular, we investigate consum-
ers ’   willingness  to  pay  for  organizational  at-
tributes that have historically predicted corporate 
reputation,  in  this  case,  for  airlines.  Using  a 
policy-capturing  or  scenario-based  design,  we 
determine how airline customers choose between 
a series of ticket options. The findings provide 
two  important  insights  into  corporate  reputa-
tion.  First,  they  demonstrate  that  consumers 
are  willing  to  pay  more  for  a  better  corporate 
reputation.  Secondly,  they  demonstrate  that 
consumers base their willingness to pay on or-
ganizational  attributes,  but  that  they  do  so 
primarily  through  corporate  reputation.  These 
findings  suggest  that  corporate  reputation  re-
search  has  an  important  place  within  our  un-
derstanding of corporate strategy.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Corporate reputation studies have tradition-
ally  reﬂ ected  the  perspectives  of  investors, 

analysts and competitors. These studies con-
sistently ﬁ nd reputation to be strongly cor-
related 
to  organizational  performance 
( Roberts and Dowling, 2002 ). Most of these 
studies  have  been  conducted  on  macro-
ﬁ rm-level data. We do not, however, have a 
good  understanding  of  how  reputation 
inﬂ uences micro decisions, in particular con-
sumers ’  decisions and their willingness to pay. 
This is a key link in understanding why and 
how corporation reputation matters. 

 In  the  study  presented  in  this  paper,  we 
examined  the  determinants  of  consumers ’  
reputation  perceptions  of  airlines  and  the 
prices  they  were  willing  to  pay  for  airline 
tickets. Using a policy-capturing data collec-
tion  design,  we  manipulated  ﬁ ve  organiza-
tional  predictors  of  airlines ’   reputations: 
return  on  equity  (ROE),  the  endorsement 
of  the  US  Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA),  and  airline  size,  age  and  crash  his-
tory. We selected these predictors based upon 
their  relevance  to  the  airline  industry,  and 
their use in previous research on the deter-
minants  of  corporate  reputation  and  legiti-
macy. We validate these ﬁ ndings with survey 
data on actual airlines. 

 To  determine  if  consumers ’   perceptions 
of  corporate  reputation  might  affect  subse-
quent  airline  revenues,  we  also  investigated 
the  inﬂ uence  of  corporate  reputation  on

 Consumers ’  Willingness to Pay for Corporate Reputation 

consumers ’   willingness  to  pay  for  airline 
tickets. In what follows, we posit that airline 
characteristics  affect  consumers ’   willingness 
to pay through their perceptions of the air-
lines ’  reputations, with reputation serving as 
a mediating variable ( Baron and Kenny, 1986 ). 
 Our ﬁ ndings make two key contributions. 
First, they quite pointedly demonstrate that 
consumers  value  good  reputations  among 
airline companies. This adds further support 
to the relationship argued and supported in 
previous  research  between  reputation  and 
performance at the organization level, but it 
does  so  by  offering  insight  into  how  indi-
vidual  customers ’   perceptions  of  reputation 
translate into better ﬁ rm performance. Sec-
ondly, the ﬁ ndings show that while consum-
ers  are  willing  to  pay  more  for  positive 
organizational  attributes  such  as  ﬁ nancial 
performance, they do this primarily by form-
ing reputation perceptions. We describe the 
theory,  methods  and  results  that  ground 
these ﬁ ndings below.   

 LITERATURE REVIEW AND 
HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT  

 Organizational Characteristics 
 To assess consumer perceptions of ﬁ rm rep-
utation, we rely upon deﬁ nitions of reputa-
tion  and  legitimacy.  Corporate  reputation 
refers  to  the  overall  assessment  of  a  ﬁ rm ’ s 
relative  standing  among  other  ﬁ rms,  in  the 
eyes  of  key  stakeholders  ( Fombrun,  1996 ). 
 Suchman  (1995:  574)   deﬁ nes  legitimacy  as 
a  ‘ generalized perception or assumption that 
the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, 
or  appropriate  within  some  socially  con-
structed system of norms, values, beliefs, and 
deﬁ nitions ’ .  Both  are  elements  of  the  or-
ganizational image construed by ﬁ rm stake-
holders ( Fombrun, 1996 ;  Dowling, 2001 ). In 
this paper, we consider the role of ﬁ ve key 
organizational  characteristics  in  inﬂ uencing 
consumers ’  perceptions of the reputations of 
airline  companies  and  their  willingness 
to  pay. The  airline  company  attributes  on 

which  we  have  focused  our  attention  are 
ﬁ nancial performance, endorsements, organ-
izational  age,  organizational  size  and  recent 
crash history. We argue that these organiza-
tional attributes affect consumers ’  reputation 
perceptions, and it is this aggregate percep-
tion  of  reputation,  as  opposed  to  the  indi-
vidual  attributes,  that  affects  consumers ’  
willingness to pay for airline tickets.  

 Financial performance 
 The relationship between ﬁ rm performance 
and corporate reputation has been well doc-
umented  ( Roberts  and  Dowling,  2002 ).  In 
most  cases,  the  relationship  is,  however, 
framed in the terms of  ‘ does a good reputa-
tion  pay? ’ .  In  other  words,  does  a  good 
reputation  predict  good  ﬁ nancial  perform-
ance? Previous research has argued that there 
is a strong halo effect between a good ﬁ nan-
cial  performance  and  a  good  reputation 
( Fombrun and Shanley, 1990 ;  McGuire  et al ., 
1990 ).  Strong  ﬁ nancial  performance  may 
signal  to  consumers  that  the  ﬁ rm  is  well 
managed and is selling a valuable product.   

 Endorsements by legitimate outsiders 
 Awards and prizes, certiﬁ cation and accred-
itation, and endorsements legitimate organ-
izations because the overt association with a 
seemingly legitimate body confers legitimacy 
to the agent ﬁ rm ( Meyer and Rowan, 1991 ; 
 Scott,  1991 ).   Rao  (1994)   found  that  auto 
manufacturers that had won multiple speed 
and  reliability  contests,  which  acted  as 
endorsements of their engineering capabili-
ties,  improved  the  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation  and 
chances  of  survival.  Endorsements  are  seen 
as objective evaluations of the ﬁ rm ’ s actions 
and, therefore, serve to rationalize the myths 
associated with the organization. We test this 
relationship in the present research.   

 Organizational age 
 Stakeholder  inferences  about  the  age  or 
longevity of ﬁ rms can also determine repu-

 Recent airline crashes 
 In the airline industry, a single fatal crash can 
be harmful to an airline ’ s reputation, even if 
the  affected  airline ’ s  overall  safety  record  is 
better  than  its  competitors. A  crash  that  is 
viewed as a crisis situation has the potential 
to  severely  damage  a  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation  and 
legitimacy,  and  the  extent  of  the  damage 
depends  in  part  upon  the  attributed  causes 
of the crisis and how the ﬁ rm manages the 
problem ( Dutton  et al ., 1994 ;  Greening and 
Gray,  1994 ).  While  recent  crash  history  is 
arguably  less  of  an  organizational  attribute 
than the other four determinants, it has the 
advantage of permitting us to assess the rel-
ative  magnitude  of  other  more  generic 
attributes  to  one  that  is  speciﬁ c  to  this  in-
dustry. A crash raises questions in the minds 
of constituents about the acceptability of an 
airline ’ s  business  and  aviation  practices,  as 
well as the ﬁ tness of the airline as a corpo-
ration. 

 In  summary,  the  attributes  above  suggest 
the  following  relationship  with  corporate 
reputation: 

  H1 :  

  Consumers will attribute a more positive 
reputation to ﬁ rms that have better ﬁ nan-
cial  performance,  stronger  endorsements, 
larger organizational size, greater longev-
ity and fewer recent airline crashes, than 
to  ﬁ rms  that  have  worse  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance,  weaker  endorsements,  smaller 
size, less longevity and more recent crashes .  

 Reputation and Consumers ’  
Willingness to Pay 
 A good corporate reputation should provide 
valuable  returns  to  the  ﬁ rm,  including  the 
attraction  and  retention  of  higher-quality 
employees,  higher  mobility  barriers  among 
ﬁ rms  and  more  reputable  suppliers  because 
of 
costs 
( Antunovich   et  al .,  2000 ;   Dowling,  2001 ; 
 Fombrun, 1996 ;  Roberts and Dowling, 2002 ; 
 Rynes,  1991 ).  In  the  case  of  consumers, 

lower  monitoring 

assumed 

tation. Although there has been considerable 
research into the liability of newness, many 
of  these  arguments  are  developed  at  the 
population level ( Freeman  et al ., 1983 ;  Singh 
 et  al .,  1986 ;   Stinchcombe,  1965 ).  There  is 
relatively  little  known  about  consumers ’  
responses 
to  organizational  age.  Older 
organizations may have more favorable rep-
utations than newer ﬁ rms for several reasons. 
First, older organizations may be more vis-
ible than other ﬁ rms, and relatedly, have had 
more  time  to  implant  and  reinforce  their 
corporate  images  ( Gatewood   et  al .,  1993 ). 
Secondly, an organization ’ s age may signal to 
outsiders that the ﬁ rm ’ s operations must be 
legitimate  and  well  run,  by  virtue  of  their 
prolonged  existence.  In  addition,  older 
organizations  are  more  deeply  embedded 
within  their  organizational  ﬁ eld  ( Stinch-
combe,  1965 ;   Hannan  and  Freeman,  1984 ), 
which  may  insulate  the  ﬁ rm  from  failure 
( Baum 
 Perrow, 
1979 ;  Zucker, 1988 ), and connect the ﬁ rm ’ s 
reputation  with 
reputable 
partners.

 Organizational size 
 Corporate  reputations  are  at  risk  not  only 
from  newness  but  also 
from  smallness 
( Freeman   et  al .,  1983 ;  Wholey  and  Brittain, 
1986 ). Small ﬁ rms may be at a disadvantage 
because  constituents  assume  that  ﬁ rms  can 
become large only if they are legitimate and 
successful. In other words, a ﬁ rm ’ s large size 
signals  to  constituents  that  they  ‘ must  have 
been doing something right ’ . Also, much like 
the argument with organizational age, larger 
ﬁ rms tend to be more visible, and hence ﬁ nd 
it  easier  to  solidify  corporate  image  in 
potential consumers ’  minds. Larger ﬁ rms are 
more  likely  to  be  embedded  in  networked 
relationships  because  of 
the  diversiﬁ ed 
nature  of  their  business,  so  constituents 
assume  that  larger  ﬁ rms  are  legitimate  and 
reputable by virtue of their trading partners 
and alliances.

 Consumers ’  Willingness to Pay for Corporate Reputation 

however,  they  are  also  willing  to  pay  more 
for products associated with a strong corpo-
rate  reputation.  In  particular,  a  strong 
corporate reputation suggests that the prod-
ucts and services being offered by the ﬁ rm 
are  of  higher  quality  ( Carmeli  and Tishler, 
2005 )  and  that  the  ﬁ rm  is  responsible 
and  will  treat  its  customers  well  ( Brammer 
and  Millington,  2005 ).  As  a  result,  we 
predict:

  There will be a positive relationship be-
tween

the product . 

reputation  and 

 An important question is whether reputa-
tion  acts  as  the  conduit  for  the  valued 
organizational  attributes,  or  whether  the 
organizational attributes directly inﬂ uence a 
consumer ’ s willingness to pay. Answering this 
question  informs  managerial  decision  and 
reputational research. 

 If consumers ﬁ rst form reputation percep-
tions, then organizations interested in charg-
ing  premium  prices  might  want  to  devote 
resources to enhancing their overall reputa-
tions. On the other hand, if consumers price 
ﬁ rm characteristics directly, it might be more 
efﬁ cient  for  organizations  to  identify  the 
ﬁ rm characteristics for which consumers are 
willing  to  pay,  and  then  work  on  attaining 
and  communicating  information  on  those 
characteristics.  It  becomes  more  important, 
then,  for  ﬁ rms  to  address  the  base  line 
attributes,  rather  than  the  formative  con-
struct of corporate reputation. 

 How  consumers  incorporate  ﬁ rm-level 
information  into  their  willingness  to  pay 
judgments also offers insights into the repu-
tation  literature. To  date,  the  importance  of 
reputation as a unique and useful construct 
has  rested  on  arguments  about  the  returns 
to reputation (eg stock market performance) 
and  its  potential  as  a  source  of  competitive 
advantage  ( Fombrun,  1996 ;   Roberts  and 

Dowling,  2002 ).  If  reputation  also  acts  as  a 
mediating variable, this is additional support 
for reputation as a separate and unique con-
struct. Moreover, consideration of reputation 
as  an  intervening  variable  has  the  potential 
to  illuminate  the  process  by  which  ﬁ rm 
characteristics and actions are translated into 
tangible  economic  beneﬁ ts.  Based  on 
Hypotheses  1  and  2 , we deduce that assess-
ments of reputation should mediate the ﬁ ve 
organizational characteristics and consumers ’  
willingness to pay. Our ﬁ nal hypothesis is the 
following: 

  H3 :  

  Consumers ’  reputation perceptions of the 
organization will mediate the relationship 
between organizational characteristics and 
consumers ’  willingness to pay for the or-
ganization ’ s products . 

 METHODS  

 Overview 
 We  examined  the  effects  of  airline  charac-
teristics on consumers ’  reputation judgments 
and  consumers ’   willingness  to  pay 
for 
airline  tickets. We  used  a  policy-capturing 
design  to  present  hypothetical  descriptions 
of  airlines  in  which  we  manipulated  ﬁ ve 
predictors of corporate reputation: ﬁ nancial 
performance, endorsement of the FAA, air-
line  size  and  age,  and  whether  the  airline 
recently  experienced  a  crash. After  reading 
each  scenario  describing  a  hypothetical 
company, 
indicated 
their  perceptions  of  the  reputation  of  the 
airline company, and how much they would 
be  willing  to  pay  for  a  ticket  to  visit  a 
friend.

urban university in the southeastern United 
States. The vast majority of the students had 
worked full-time. We received 71 usable sur-
veys  of  the  90  surveys  that  were  randomly 
distributed to students in ﬁ ve graduate class-
es, for a response rate of 79 per cent. Each 
individual  read  and  responded  to  eight 
descriptions  of  hypothetical  airlines  as  part 
of the survey process, for a total number of 
observations  of  568  (71  individuals   ×   8 
descriptions). 

 The  survey  process  was  as  follows.  Sub-
jects  were  told  that  they  were  to  receive  a 
survey  on  consumers ’   choices  of  airlines. 
Prior to reading the scenarios, they received 
a deﬁ nition of the FAA and its responsibil-
ity for airline safety in the US (we refer to 
the FAA in the endorsement manipulation), 
as  well  as  a  deﬁ nition  of  ROE  (we  refer 
to  ROE  in  the  ﬁ nancial  performance  ma-
nipulation).  Subjects  were  told  that  they 
were  to  pretend  that  they  wanted  to 
purchase an airline ticket to visit a very close 
friend,  and  that  they  should  read  and  con-
sider  each  airline  description  as  a  separate 
airline.   

 Measures and Scenario Factors 
 We  created  the  corporate  reputation  de-
pendent variable from subjects ’  responses to 
four items ( ‘ This airline has a good reputa-
tion ’ ,  ‘ This  airline  performs  well  compared 
to  other  airlines ’ ,  ‘ This  airline  is  legitimate ’  
and  ‘ This  airline  operates  in  an  acceptable 
manner ’ ) using a seven-point graphic rating 
scale  anchored  by  1    =     strongly  disagree   to 
7    =     strongly  agree . This  measure  is  consistent 
with both recent and original conceptualiza-
tions of corporate reputation ( Barnett  et al ., 
2006 ;   Fombrun,  1996 ).  The  reliability  be-
tween these items was high (0.89 coefﬁ cient 
alpha), and the items were combined to form 
the  dependent  variable. The  willingness  to 
pay dependent variable was based upon sub-
jects ’  responses to a question following each 
scenario,  ‘ How much would you be willing 
to pay to purchase a round trip ticket from 

Atlanta  to  Philadelphia  on  this  airline? 
[A  competitive  round  trip  fare,  with  two-
week advance purchase is   $ 200 ] ’ . 

 The  ﬁ ve  independent  variables  were 
dichotomous ( Hoffman, 1960 ), with one value 
representing  a  base  case  scenario  and  the 
other a worst case scenario. The worst case 
values were modeled on ValuJet (now known 
as AirTran) after it experienced a tragic crash 
in May 1996. At the time of data collection 
for  this  study  in  1997, ValuJet Airlines  had 
severe  reputation  and  legitimacy  problems 
( Schiavo, 1997 ). The base case values reﬂ ect 
the average of ValuJet ’ s primary competitors, 
namely,  the  largest  four  airlines  ﬂ ying  into 
the major US city in which our study par-
ticipants  were 
located.  Policy-capturing 
studies are more effective when manipulations 
are realistic ( Graham and Cable, 2001 ). 

 The ﬁ rst independent variable, the ﬁ nan-
cial  performance  of  the  airline,  was  indi-
cated by ROE. In half of the scenarios, we 
described  an  average  ROE  of  32  per  cent 
(average ROE of ValuJet ’ s primary competi-
tors). The  other  level  of  ROE  described  in 
the scenarios was     −     47 per cent, the ROE 
of ValuJet Airlines  one  year  after  their  May 
1996 crash. 

 The  second  independent  variable  was 
endorsement. We expect that airlines in vio-
lation  of  FAA  rules  would  experience  less 
favorable reputations, while those in compli-
ance would have enhanced reputations. The 
FAA is charged with monitoring the opera-
tions  of  the  airlines,  and  most  Americans 
trust  that  the  airlines  are  safe  to  ﬂ y  if  the 
FAA says that they are ( Schiavo, 1997 ). Half 
of the scenarios describe how FAA inspec-
tors  found  no  serious  safety  problems  with 
the airline. In the other half of the scenarios, 
we describe how FAA inspectors found seri-
ous problems with the airline ’ s operations in 
the previous year. We based the wording of 
this  level  of  the  endorsement  manipulation 
on FAA communications to ValuJet Airlines 
following  their  May  1996  crash  ( FAA,  17 
June, 1996 ).

 Consumers ’  Willingness to Pay for Corporate Reputation 

 The third manipulated independent vari-
able was airline size, which was indicated by 
the  number  of  passengers  served  in  a  year. 
Again, two levels of this variable were con-
structed.  In  half  of  the  scenarios,  we  de-
scribed  airlines  that  served  48  million 
passengers in the last year (average of ValuJet ’ s 
primary  competitors).  In  the  other  half  of 
the scenarios, the airline described served six 
million  passengers  per  year  (ValuJet ’ s  pro-
jected 1996 passengers served). 

 We  also  manipulated  organizational  age. 
In a similar fashion to airline size, we aver-
aged  the  ages  of  the  largest  four  carriers 
at  the  international  airport  in  the  city  in 
which the data were collected (52 years old), 
which we gathered by calling the public re-
lations ofﬁ ces of these ﬁ rms. For the below-
average  size  ﬁ gure,  we  took  the  age  of 
ValuJet airlines at the time of its May 1996 
crash (3 years old). 

 Finally, to indicate an organizational crisis, 
we used an airline crash. In half of our sce-
narios we stated in the last year, one of the 
airline ’ s jets had crashed and there were no 
survivors. In the other half of the scenarios, 
we  stated  that  there  had  been  no  crash  in 
the last year.   

 Survey Design 
 All  respondents  were  given  the  following 
general  instructions:  ‘ You  want  to  purchase 
a  round  trip  airline  ticket  from Atlanta  to 
Philadelphia to visit a very close friend. You 
are considering purchasing a ticket on sev-
eral different airlines. You will be presented 
with  descriptions  of  these  airlines.  Please 
respond to the questions with the scales pro-
vided ’ . 

 Every  possible  combination  of  the  ﬁ ve 
organizational characteristics was used, per-
mitting  assessments  of  the  relative  impor-
tance placed on each factor by respondents 
( Hoffman,  1960 ).  This  created  32  discrete 
scenarios  (2 5   design).  The  scenarios  and 
organizational characteristics within scenar-
ios  were  presented  in  random  order.  Each 

study participant read and responded to eight 
of  the  32  total  scenarios,  or  one  block  of 
eight scenarios. The study design is described 
in more detail in  Table 1 .   

 Data Analyses 
 Because each of our 71 respondents report-
ed eight reputation evaluations, it was neces-
sary  to  use  a  ﬁ xed  effects,  or  repeated 
measures  analysis  for  our  data  ( Pedhazur, 
1982 ). As such, we created dummy variables 
representing  each  of  our  study  participants, 
and  included  the  dummy  variables  as  con-
trols in our regression analyses. 

 To  test  our  hypotheses,  we  performed 
three  sets  of  regression  analyses.  First,  we 
regressed reputation perceptions on the ﬁ ve 
predictors  of  reputation,  and  the  dummy 
variables  for  each  individual  respondent,  in

increase in  R  2  and changes in the ﬁ rm char-
acteristics ’   coefﬁ cients 
from 
adding reputation as an independent variable 
to a model of the ﬁ ve characteristics predict-
ing  willingness  to  pay  ( Baron  and  Kenny, 
1986 ;  Cohen  et al ., 2002 ). With this last step 
we complete the recommended steps to test 
for  mediation  ( Baron  and  Kenny,  1986 ), 
which requires demonstration of the follow-
ing:  (a)  ﬁ rm  characteristics  are  related  to 
reputation, (b) ﬁ rm characteristics are related 
to willingness to pay and (c) when reputation 
is  added  as  an  independent  variable  to   ‘ b ’ , 
then the ﬁ rm characteristics no longer predict 
willingness to pay. 

 To  cross-validate  our  ﬁ ndings  on  hypo-
thetical  airlines,  we  asked  respondents  to 
indicate their perceptions of the characteris-
tics of eight  real  airlines, evaluate the reputa-
tions  of  these  airlines  and  to  indicate  their 
willingness to pay for tickets on these airlines. 
Data on the real airlines were analyzed with 
repeated  measures  analysis,  similar  to  the 

hypothetical  data.  One-half  of  our  subjects 
read  the  hypothetical  airline  scenarios  ﬁ rst, 
and one-half evaluated the real airlines ﬁ rst.    

 RESULTS 
  Table 2  reports correlations among our de-
pendent  and  independent  variables,  as  well 
as  their  means  and  standard  deviations.  By 
design, correlations among each of the ﬁ ve 
predictors  are  0  (not  reported  in  Table  2 ) 
and  had  a  mean  and  standard  deviation  of 
0.5. We  do  not  report  correlations  for  the 
individual dummy variables; these are avail-
able  from  the  authors.  As  expected,  our 
reputation  and  willingness  to  pay  variables 
are  highly  correlated  (0.57;   p     <    0.001),  but 
are not identical. 

  Table  3   reports  regression  results  for  the 
dependent variable of reputation on the ﬁ ve 
reputation  predictors.  The  70  individual 
dummy  variables  are  not  provided  in  the 
table in order to conserve space. In support 
of Hypothesis  1 , the ﬁ ve predictors signiﬁ -
cantly  explained  reputation  judgments  (all 
 p     <    0.001). The endorsement of the FAA had 
the largest impact on reputation perceptions, 
followed  by  crash  status  and  ﬁ nancial  per-
formance.

Hypothesis   2   received  strong  support  in 
that individuals ’  reputation perceptions were 
highly  related  to  their  willingness  to  pay 
for airline tickets (  ♢      =    0.46;  p     <    0.001) (Mod-
el B). 

 Finally, analysis of reputation as a mediator 
generally  supported  Hypothesis   3   ( Baron 
and Kenny, 1986 ). Since the addition of the 
reputation  variable  reduced  the  coefﬁ cients 
for ﬁ nancial performance and airline age to 
nonsigniﬁ cant  ﬁ gures,  we  conclude  that 
reputation  fully  mediated  the  relationship 
between  these  variables  and  willingness  to 
pay,  in  support  of  Hypothesis   3   ( Table  4 , 
Model  B). That  is,  consumers  incorporate 
information on airline ﬁ nancial performance 
and  airline  age  into  a  reputation  indicator 
prior to deciding how much they are willing 
to pay for tickets. Reputation partially medi-
ated  the  relationship  between  the  endorse-
ment  of  the  FAA,  airline  size  and  crash 
status,  and  the  dependent  variable  willing-
ness to pay in that coefﬁ cients for these three 
variables  were  substantially  reduced  but

reputation 

 In this study, we examined organizational 
characteristics that may affect the reputation 
perceptions  of  airline  consumers.  As  pre-
dicted, all ﬁ ve variables examined were found 
to be strong determinants of corporate rep-
utation. The  endorsement  of  the  FAA  had 
the  largest  inﬂ uence  on  reputation  percep-
tions, which suggests that the FAA provided 
independent  conﬁ rmation  of  an  airline ’ s 
worthiness. This  ﬁ nding  is  consistent  with 
the  organizational 
literature, 
which  emphasizes  the  value  to  ﬁ rms  of 
independent, 
endorsement 
( Elsbach,  1994 ). The  effect  of  endorsement 
on reputation was substantial, with consum-
ers  willing  to  pay   $ 36  more  for  a  plane 
ticket if the FAA endorsed it for operational 
safety.  3   Consistent with previous research on 
corporate reputation, the ﬁ nancial perform-
ance  of  the  ﬁ rm  was  a  strong  predictor  of 
reputation  perceptions,  this  time  among 
consumers. 

third-party 

legitimacy 

  Fombrun  and  Shanley  (1990)   highlight 
the difﬁ culties of demonstrating the ﬁ nancial 
gains from an enhanced reputation. They ask 
of reputations  ‘  …  how sound an investment, 
how much of an asset? ’ . In this study, indi-
vidual-level  perceptions  and  willingness  to 
pay data permit us to estimate the tangible 
effects  of  reputation  .  Results  suggest  that 
consumers are willing to pay more for tick-
ets  on  airlines  with  more  favorable  reputa-
tions.  More 
speciﬁ cally,  unstandardized 
coefﬁ cients  for  Model  B  indicate  that  for 
each one-point increase in airline reputation, 
consumers are willing to pay  $ 18 more for 
a plane ticket. This is a consequential effect 
that  will  be  magniﬁ ed  to  the  extent  that 
ﬁ rms  can  increase  their  reputational  lead 
over their competitors. 

 Moreover,  our  results  indicate  that  con-
sumers summarize information about ﬁ rms 
in the form of a reputation judgment, which 

remained signiﬁ cant, in the presence of the 
reputation variable. In other words, endorse-
ment,  size  and  crash  status  have  both  an 
indirect and direct effect on consumers ’  will-
ingness  to  pay  for  tickets.  1    Examination  of 
our  hypotheses  with  structural  equations 
modeling  supported  all  of  the  hypotheses, 
and  provided  even  stronger  support  for 
reputation  as  a  mediator,  with  reputation 
fully mediating all ﬁ ve organizational char-
acteristics.  2   

 Results  on  the  actual  airlines  validated 
most of the hypothetical scenario results. All 
ﬁ ve  reputation  predictors  signiﬁ cantly  pre-
dicted consumer reputation perceptions (all 
 p     <    0.001). The predictors, however, differed 
in magnitude from the hypothetical airlines 
in  that  ﬁ nancial  performance,  the  endorse-
ment of the FAA and airline size all had the 
largest impact on reputation. Airline age and 
crash  status  affected  reputation  to  a  lesser 
degree.  Actual  airline  results  also  provided 
support for reputation perceptions as a sig-
niﬁ cant  predictor  of  consumer  willingness 
to pay for tickets. Support for reputation as 
a  mediator  was  consistent  with  the  hypo-
thetical  airline  results  in  that  the  effects  of 
ﬁ nancial  performance  and  age  on  ticket 
prices  were  fully  mediated  by  reputation, 
and  the  effects  of  the  endorsement  of 
the  FAA  and  airline  size  were  partially 
mediated  by  reputation.  In  contrast  to  the 
hypothetical  results,  crash  status  was  not 
mediated by reputation, a result that may be 
due  to  the  rarity  of  crashes  among  actual 
airlines.   

 DISCUSSION 
 Firms  are  increasingly  seeking  to  establish 
and  maintain  favorable  corporate  reputa-
tions, with the goal of leveraging reputation 
for  competitive  advantage.  The  paucity  of 
information  available  on  consumers ’   assess-
ments  of  corporate  reputations,  however, 
constrains  ﬁ rms ’   abilities  to  manage  their 
reputation.  From  a  theoretical  perspective, 
we are still in the early stages of understand-

 Consumers ’  Willingness to Pay for Corporate Reputation 

then inﬂ uences their purchase decisions. The 
effects of ﬁ nancial performance and ﬁ rm size 
on  ticket  prices  are  indirect:  their  impact 
occurs only through the reputation variable. 
The other three predictors appear to operate 
primarily  through  the  reputation  construct 
but also operate directly on ticket prices. For 
example, a comparison of the effect sizes for 
endorsement  in  Model  A  and  Model  B 
( Table 4 ) indicates that approximately two-
thirds  of  the  endorsement  effect  on  ticket 
prices occurs through the intervening vari-
able of reputation, and one-third of the effect 
operates  directly  on  consumer  price  deci-
sions. 

 The fact that corporate reputation medi-
ates  the  relationship  between  ﬁ rm  charac-
teristics and consumer willingness to pay has 
managerial  implications.  At  the  most  basic 
level,  there  will  be  no  positive  reputational 
or revenue returns to ﬁ rms whose potential 
consumers  are  unaware  of  their  positive 
characteristics  such  as  the  endorsement  of 
the FAA. Marketing managers can heighten 
the  reputation,  and  thereby  the  economic 
returns,  by  emphasizing  the  characteristics 
that are associated with their ﬁ rms ’  reputa-
tion  and  on  which  their  airline  compares 
favorably relative to their competitors. Man-
agers should be aware that most ticket rev-
enue  attributed  to  their  ﬁ rm ’ s  reputation 
occurs through consumer perceptions. Firms 
may be able to improve these returns through 
a  focused  reputation  management  plan. Al-
though some of these variables, such as ﬁ rm 
age,  cannot  be  manipulated,  others  can  be. 
Ideally, managers would strategically manage 
these valuable ﬁ rm characteristics, as well as 
create  a  consistent  corporate  reputation 
( Fombrun, 1996 ).   

 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
 We recommend that future research examine 
reputation predictors in other industries and 
types of ﬁ rms, to build on our initial ﬁ ndings 
in the airline context. As such, our ﬁ ndings 

should only be generalized primarily to pas-
senger  airlines,  since  the  policy-capturing 
manipulations  and  research  context  per-
tained  to  the  airline  industry.  Further,  the 
airline industry may be particularly sensitive 
to speciﬁ c elements of corporate reputation, 
such  as  organizational  crises  and  endorse-
ments of safety. 

 In this study, there was a trade-off between 
the  experimental  nature  of  our  policy-
capturing  design,  which  permitted  strong 
inferences about the inﬂ uence of our inde-
pendent  variables,  and  the  setting  for  our 
study.  Results  should  be  interpreted  with 
some caution since we manipulated realistic, 
yet  hypothetical  ﬁ rm  characteristics,  and 
because  we  were  unable  to  examine  actual 
ticket  purchases.  Conﬁ rmation  of  many  of 
our  ﬁ ndings  with  our  data  on  real  airlines 
helps  mitigate  this  concern;  but  ideally, 
future  research  would  examine  reputation 
perceptions  prior  to   actual   ticket  purchases 
on real airlines. Another issue is that results 
from our sample of MBA students may not 
generalize to the typical airline consumer, or 
to  other  groups  (eg  retirees).  We  suggest 
that future studies on this topic be conduct-
ed  in  ﬁ eld  settings  and  with  diverse  sam-
ples. 

 There may also be some concern with the 
causal  inferences  we  make  about  the  rela-
tionship between reputation and willingness 
to pay, because of a risk of common meth-
od bias, and relatedly, because we collect data 
at  one  point  of  time  only. While  a  causal 
interpretation  is  consistent  with  relevant 
theory,  the  relationship  between  these  two 
variables may be weaker than what we found. 
In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  consumers 
make  reputation  and  willingness-to-pay 
decisions simultaneously or in reverse order 
to what we have hypothesized.  4   That is, con-
sumers may decide how much they are will-
ing  to  pay  for  a  ticket  (eg  premium  price) 
and then justify it in terms of the reputation 
of  the  airline  on  which  they  will  be  ﬂ ying 
(eg excellent reputation). A ﬁ nal suggestion

  NOTES 
  1       The analyses reported in  Tables 3 and 4  were also 
performed  on  a  subset  of  observations  ( n     =    539), 
which  excluded  scenarios  for  which  consumers 
indicated they would pay  $ 0 for an airline ticket. 
Results were substantially the same to the results 
reported in this paper.   

  2       We rely upon the regression analysis in the tables 
because our repeated measures design violates the 
assumption  of  structural  equations  modeling  that 
observations are independent. We report these ad-
ditional results as evidence of the robustness of our 
results.

  4       Our structural equation results that tested an alter-
native  model  of  willingness  to  pay  as  a  mediator 
of  reputation  perceptions  did  not,  however,  ﬁ nd 
full  mediation,  nor  was  the  relationship  between 
these  two  variables  as  strong  as  when  reputation 
predicted willingness to pay.
