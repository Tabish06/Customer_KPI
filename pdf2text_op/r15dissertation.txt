ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION 

WORK CREATIVITY AS A DIMENSION OF JOB PERFORMANCE 

by 

Angela C. Reaves

Professor Chockalingam Viswesvaran, Major Professor 

To stay competitive, many employers are looking for creative and innovative 

employees to add value to their organization. However, current models of job 

performance overlook creative performance as an important criterion to measure in the 

workplace. The purpose of this dissertation is to conduct two separate but related studies 

on creative performance that aim to provide support that creative performance should be 

included in models of job performance, and ultimately included in performance 

evaluations in organizations. Study 1 is a meta-analysis on the relationship between 

creative performance and task performance, and the relationship between creative 

performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Overall, I found support for 

a medium to large corrected correlation for both the creative performance-task 

performance ((cid:545) = .51) and creative performance-OCB ((cid:545) = .49) relationships. Further, I 

also found that both rating-source and study location were significant moderators. Study 

2 is a process model that includes creative performance alongside task performance and 

OCB as the outcome variables. I test a model in which both individual differences 

(specifically: conscientiousness, extraversion, proactive personality, and self-efficacy) 

and job characteristics (autonomy, feedback, and supervisor support) predict creative 

iv 


performance, task performance, and OCB through engagement as a mediator. In a sample 

of 299 employed individuals, I found that all the individual differences and job 

characteristics were positively correlated with all three performance criteria. I also looked 

at these relationships in a multiple regression framework and most of the individual 

differences and job characteristics still predicted the performance criteria. In the 

mediation analyses, I found support for engagement as a significant mediator of the 

individual differences-performance and job characteristics-performance relationships. 

Taken together, Study 1 and Study 2 support the notion that creative performance should 

be included in models of job performance. Implications for both researchers and 

practitioners alike are discussed.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION 

The study of job performance criteria is a central theme in 

industrial/organizational psychology. Because of the importance of job performance 

criteria, continuous examination of the dimensionality and causal models of job 

performance is essential (Austin & Villanova, 1992). As external and internal changes in 

organizations occur, the conceptualization of job performance must also change. Current 

models of job performance (e.g., Campbell, 1990; Murphy, 1990; Viswesvaran, 1993) 

lack an important performance dimension â creative performance. However, creative 

performance fits into existing frameworks of job performance (i.e., a stand-alone 

dimension of performance, Viswesvaran & Ones, 2000). The goal of this dissertation is to 

address a gap in the literature in expanding dimensionality of job performance by 

examining the criterion of creative performance and investigating how it correlates with 

other criterion dimensions. As I address this aforementioned gap, I will also be updating 

causal models of job performance. 

Dimensionality of Job Performance 

Existing frameworks on the dimensionality of job performance fall into two 

categories: stand-alone dimensions and dimensions developed as part of a set of 

dimensions. Stand-alone dimensions include criteria such as task performance and 

organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that are applicable to many, if not all, jobs and 

occupations. Dimensions developed as part of a set of dimensions include several 

different dimensions (i.e. written and oral communication, job specific task proficiency; 

Campbell, 1990) that together make up overall job performance. Several sets of 

dimensions have been proposed in the literature (cf. Campbell, 1990) but none includes 

1 


explicitly the creative performance dimension. Even though these existing taxonomies do 

not include creative performance, some scholars (e.g., Jex & Britt, 2008) include creative 

performance in discussions of job performance criteria. Further, research has included 

creative performance as a criterion of interest alongside other stand-alone performance 

dimensions (e.g., Binnewewies, Sonnentag, & Majza, 2009; Gorgievski, Bakker, & 

Schaufeli, 2010; Ng & Feldman, 2009). Therefore, this dissertation proposes that creative 

performance should be considered as a stand-alone dimension of performance as well. 

Antecedents of Performance. An abundance of literature in 

industrial/organizational psychology has been devoted to uncovering which antecedents 

predict job performance. Findings have concluded that many individual differences (i.e. 

cognitive ability, Schmidt & Hunter, 1998; personality, Barrick & Mount, 1991, Hurtz & 

Donovan, 2000), job characteristics (i.e. feedback; Fried, 1991), and job attitudes (i.e. job 

satisfaction; Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, 2001) are just a sampling of antecedents 

that predict different performance criteria to varying strengths. Some of these individual 

differences predict several types of criteria. For instance, conscientiousness has been 

found to be a predictor of stand-alone dimensions of performance such as OCB 

(Chiaburu, Oh, Berry, Li, & Gardner, 2011) and also a predictor of overall performance 

(Barrick & Mount, 1991). Cognitive ability, however, is a strong predictor of job 

performance (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998), but not a particularly strong predictor of OCB. 

So an antecedent may predict overall performance, or a stand-alone performance 

dimension, but it may not necessarily predict all performance criteria. One relevant 

question that the dissertation intends to answer is whether the same antecedents that 

2 


predict other dimensions of performance (i.e. task performance and OCB) also predict 

creative performance. 

Why do Antecedents Predict Performance? As previously discussed, research 

has identified several predictors of job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Chiaburu, 

et al., 2011; Fried, 1991; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; Schmidt & Hunter, 1998), so the 

question then shifts to ask why do these antecedents predict performance? This is where 

causal models have been instrumental in uncovering how, why, and under what 

conditions do certain antecedents predict performance. 

Several models have been identified to explain why performance occurs. For 

example, we know that personality explains some of the variance in job performance 

(e.g., Barrick & Mount, 1991), and research has expanded on this finding to uncover 

proximal mechanisms that explain why this relationship occurs. For instance, research 

has found motivation is a mediator between extraversion/conscientiousness and sales 

performance (Barrick, Stewart, & Piotrowski, 2002). Goal-setting has been found to 

mediate the relationship between conscientiousness and performance, where, in essence, 

individuals high on conscientiousness are more likely to set goals, which then results in 

higher performance (Barrick, Mount, & Strauss, 1993). Another example that explains 

why cognitive ability is a predictor of job performance is the work of Schmidt, Hunter, 

and Outerbridge (1986) who found that general mental ability leads to job knowledge, 

which leads to higher performance ratings. Higher general mental ability leads to more 

acquisition of job knowledge, which then leads to better performance.  

The above highlights some of the causal models that uncover how and why 

certain predictors lead to performance by way of more proximal predictors such as 

3 


motivation (Barrick et al., 2002), goals (Barrick et al., 1993), or job knowledge (Schmidt 

et al., 1986). Several other models have been proposed and tested in the existing 

literature, and research should continue to uncover these mediating mechanisms to help 

understand the processes by which these antecedents facilitate performance. This 

dissertation proposes and tests a causal model of performance where the relationship 

between some of the traditional predictors of performance (i.e. individual differences and 

job characteristics) and performance criteria (creative performance, task performance, 

and OCB) is mediated by engagement. For example, receiving feedback about 

performance would lead to an employee being more engaged in their work, which in turn 

leads to higher job performance. The relationship between feedback and performance as 

well as other hypotheses are tested in Study 2. 

Creative Performance as a Separate Stand-alone Dimension. This dissertation 

proposes that creative performance is a separate stand-alone dimension of job 

performance. I test this hypothesis by conducting a meta-analysis of creative performance 

and two other commonly used stand-alone dimensions of performance found in the 

literature (task performance and OCB). This is the goal of Study 1. After examining that 

creative performance is a stand-alone dimension of performance, I test whether or not 

traditional predictors of performance criteria also predict creative performance, or if these 

antecedents have differential predictions concerning creative performance (Study 2). 

Further, I also aim to uncover how these predictors lead to performance, so I will test a 

causal model in which engagement mediates the relationship between these predictors 

and performance (creative performance, task performance, and OCB). Testing the model 

will help to supplement the existing causal models of job performance by extending them 

4 


to a new dimension of job performance (creative performance at work) as well as testing 

engagement as a mediator. 

The remainder of this chapter will elaborate on the above points. First, however, I 

explain what creative performance is, and why creative performance is an important 

criterion to examine in the workplace. I will also discuss how creative performance is 

related to other performance criteria (i.e., task performance and OCB) by examining 

common antecedents and causal models. I conclude this chapter with some implications 

of this research and a brief overview of the dissertation. 

Creative Performance 

Creativity is often defined as something that is novel-original and useful-adaptive 

(Feist, 1998). Scholars in many different fields have taken several different approaches to 

examine what creativity is and how to best measure creativity. For instance, some have 

focused on creativity in a person by examining individual differences that creative 

individuals possess, such as intrinsic motivation (Amabile, 1985). Others have looked at 

creativity as a process and examine the underlying thinking behind creative pursuits. 

Another approach is looking at the creative press, in other words, environments that bring 

out the most creativity. Finally, many researchers examine creativity as a product, 

something that others can see and judge. These four approaches have been termed the 

four Pâs (Runco, 2007). Creative performance in organizations can be thought of as a 

product, something that can be seen and judged by others (supervisors or coworkers) via 

performance evaluations. 

Why Study Creative Performance? In order to stay competitive, organizations 

must be increasingly more creative and innovative, which is why it is important to study 

5 


creative performance in organizations. Employee creative performance can contribute to 

organizational effectiveness in several ways. Employee creative performance can 

improve operations, procedures, products, and services. Studies have found value in 

creative performance in employees as creativity has been linked to bottom-line financial 

performance (Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995) and profitability (Geroski, Machin, & Van 

Reenen, 1993). Beyond these tangible outcomes, Amabile, Schatzel, Moneta, and Kramer 

(2004) found that opportunities for creative work might lead to more satisfied and 

intrinsically motivated employees, leading to overall well-being in employees.  Research 

supports the notion that creative performance can enhance the financial performance of 

organizations as well as improving the well-being of employees.  Thus, examining 

creative performance in organizations can prove to be a fruitful effort for both researchers 

and practitioners. 

Traditionally, creative performance has been studied in jobs where it is most 

relevant (i.e., scientists, artists, engineers), but researchers now argue that creativity is 

desirable in all employees in a wide array of jobs (Zhou, 2008), as it can help contribute 

to organizational effectiveness. There are some jobs that require creative performance 

(i.e. creating and developing a new and innovative product), but there is room for creative 

performance in most occupations. For example, in most jobs, employees can find creative 

solutions to problems or develop new procedures for getting work done. The level of 

creativity required can differ depending on the job and task, and some jobs require more 

creativity than others, but there is the potential in all jobs for individuals to be creative 

(Shalley, 2008).

How is Creative Performance Related to Other Dimensions of Performance? 

Some studies have examined creative performance alongside other critical criteria 

in organizations such as task performance, OCB, and counterproductive work behavior 

(e.g., Binnewies, Sonnentag, & Mojza, 2009; Ng & Feldman, 2009), and most of these 

studies propose similar antecedents for all job performance criteria. Beyond this, some 

theoretical process models of performance, such as those of Bakker and Lieter (2010) 

suggest a model that includes mediating mechanisms as more proximal predictors of job 

performance (including creative performance, task performance, and OCB). This 

suggests that creative performance can share antecedents with other performance criteria 

and may also be included in causal models of performance alongside other types of 

performance. In the following sections I will discuss these points in further detail. 

Antecedents. Several antecedents of creative performance have been identified in 

existing literature. Most of these have also been identified as predictors of other types of 

performance as well. For example, separate studies conclude that self-efficacy is a 

predictor of creative performance (Dilchert, 2008), task performance (Judge & Bono, 

2001), and OCB (Chiu & Chen, 2005). Another antecedent where this parallel is evident 

is with feedback. Feedback has again been separately found as a predictor of creative 

performance (Coelho & Augusto, 2010; Noefer, Stegmaier, Molter, & Sonntag, 2009), 

task performance (Fried, 1991; Vigoda-Gadot & Angert, 2007), and OCB (Chiu & Chen, 

2005; Vigoda-Gadot & Angert, 2007). Overall, past findings suggest that similar 

antecedents can predict creative performance as they do other types of stand-alone 

performance criteria. Further, if creative performance is related to other dimensions of 

performance, then each of their accompanying literatures can help to inform each other; 

7 


so new antecedents and streams of research can be developed from existing literature on 

job performance. 

Process Mechanism. As stated above, several antecedents have been identified as 

predictors of creative performance, task performance, and OCB. Beyond this, a model of 

employee engagement proposed by Bakker and Lieter, (2010) includes creative 

performance as a criterion, alongside task performance, OCB, and financial turnover as 

outcomes. Similar to this model (Bakker & Lieter, 2010), this dissertation tests the 

hypothesis that engagement mediates the relationship between the shared antecedents and 

performance. 

Overall, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that creative performance shares 

antecedents with other stand-alone dimensions of performance, suggesting that 

researchers can use the existing literature on antecedents of job performance to form 

hypotheses about predictors of creative performance. Further, researchers can also look 

beyond the validity of antecedents and explore how these antecedents predict creative 

performance by examining causal models of job performance that include creative 

performance as a criterion. 

Implications of Dissertation 

Now I will discuss the importance of the proposed analyses in this dissertation in 

regards to how they can be used to inform both researchers and practitioners of 

industrial/organizational psychology in several ways. First of all, the findings can inform 

performance management practices. If creative performance is indeed a separate 

dimension of performance, and it is suggested to be relevant to most, if not all jobs 

(Zhou, 2008) to some degree, then it should be included in performance evaluations. By 

8 


including creative performance in performance evaluations, organizations can understand 

how creative performance relates to organizational effectiveness. Including creative 

performance in evaluations can also serve as a motivator for employees to be creative, 

which can result in value for the organization. Secondly, practitioners should be able to 

use the information gleaned on creative performance to inform selection procedures. If 

creative performance is an important criterion and used in performance evaluations, then 

practitioners can select individuals that may be more creative at work. Further, this can 

help to establish the criterion-related validity of certain predictors of performance, as 

predictors of this stand-alone dimension of performance (creative performance). Finally, 

organizations can also use this information to help inform training and development 

related activities as well, such as training individuals to be more creative at work.  

Beyond the applied implications listed above, this dissertation can help inform 

researchers of organizational creativity. First and foremost, this research will establish 

that creative performance is a separate stand-alone dimension of job performance that is 

related to other critical criteria such as task performance and OCB. Secondly, I will test 

whether or not there are similar antecedents between creative performance, task 

performance, and OCB. Beyond this, I will also look at a process (engagement) by which 

these antecedents lead to performance, which will inform causal models of performance. 

Purpose of Dissertation 

The first purpose of this dissertation is to understand the relationship between 

creative performance and existing stand-alone dimensions of performance (specifically, 

task performance and OCB). I will use meta-analytic methods in order to assess the 

relationship between creative performance and other dimensions of performance. The 

9 


second purpose of the present dissertation is to explicate and test a causal model of job 

performance that includes creative performance as criteria.  

Study 1. Study 1 of this dissertation will use meta-analytic methods to assess the 

relationship between creativity and other job performance dimensions. Specifically, I will 

meta-analyze the relationship between creative performance and task performance, and 

the relationship between creative performance and OCB. Task performance and OCB are 

both distinct stand-alone performance dimensions that organizations value (Borman & 

Motowidlo, 1997). The purpose of this study is to establish how creative performance 

correlates with task performance and OCB. 

Study 2. Study 2 builds off Study 1 by testing a causal model of performance, in 

which the dependent variables are creative performance, task performance, and OCB. 

Research findings suggest that both individual differences and job characteristics are 

related to job performance. Several models have suggested that engagement mediates the 

relationship between individual differences/job characteristics and performance. 

However, while some of these models suggest that creative performance is an outcome of 

this process, no one has explicitly tested this model. The goal of Study 2 is to add creative 

performance to existing causal models of performance, specifically, I will test that 

engagement mediates the individual difference/job characteristic and performance 

(creative performance, task performance, and OCB) relationship. 

Summary 

 

The main criterion of interest in this dissertation is creative performance. 

However, in order to provide evidence that creative performance should be valued in 

organizations, I look at how creative performance correlates with other types of 

10 


performance and add creative performance to a causal model of job performance. By 

doing so, creative performance can be established as a distinct job performance criterion 

that also shares similar antecedents with other performance dimensions. The ultimate 

goal of this work is to help inform others of the value of creative performance as a 

dimension of job performance and suggest that it may be included in performance 

evaluations, used in selection, considered for training and development activities, and 

influence future research on creative performance in organizations.

CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

Traditional models of job performance leave out an important criterion for 

consideration: creative performance. The main purpose of this dissertation is to establish 

that creative performance should be considered by organizations as a distinct stand-alone 

performance criterion. In order to accomplish the intended purpose of this dissertation, I 

focus on three criteria (creative performance, task performance, and organizational 

citizenship behavior) by examining their interrelationships and testing a causal model that 

leads to the three criteria. The review of the literature begins with introducing the current 

taxonomy of job performance and a discussion of where creativity fits into these models. 

Next, I will introduce the three criteria that I examine in this paper â creative 

performance, task performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). I then 

explain the rationale behind the two studies conducted in the present dissertation. Finally, 

I review relevant literature on the antecedents of job performance and explain the 

hypothesized model that leads to the three criteria. 

Job Performance 

 

Viswesvaran and Ones (2000, p. 216) define job performance as âscalable actions, 

behavior, and outcomes that employees engage in or bring about that are linked with and 

contribute to organizational goals.â Many different criteria can be used as indicators of 

job performance ranging from objective indicators (i.e. sales output) to subjective ratings 

of performance by supervisors. There are also many different dimensions of job 

performance (i.e. task performance, OCB, etc.) and I will review literature in this area in 

the following section. 

12 


Models of Job Performance. Viswesvaran and Ones (2000) provide a 

framework for reviewing models of job performance. There are stand-alone dimensions 

and dimensions developed as part of a set of dimensions. Below, I provide an overview 

of past models of job performance and then explain where creative performance fits in to 

this existing framework. 

 

Stand-alone Dimensions. Task performance, OCB, and counterproductive work 

behavior (CWB) are stand-alone dimensions of job performance. These dimensions 

describe specific behaviors that can be classified as job performance. Task performance 

refers to proficiency in formal job tasks described in a job description (Motowidlo, 2000). 

Organizational citizenship behavior is discretionary and not explicitly recognized by the 

formal organizational reward system (Organ, 1988). Organizational citizenship behavior 

includes behaviors that positively influence organizational effectiveness, such as helping, 

courtesy, and compliance (Organ, 1997). In contrast, counterproductive work behavior 

negatively influence organizational effectiveness and includes behaviors such as abuse 

against others, sabotage, production deviance, withdrawal, and theft (Spector, Fox, 

Penney, Bruursema, Goh, & Kessler, 2006).  

 

Set of Performance Dimensions. There are also several models in the literature 

that describe a set of performance dimensions. These different sets are each postulated to 

describe the construct domain of overall job performance. Campbellâs (1990) model of 

job performance includes eight performance dimensions: job-specific task proficiency, 

non-job-specific task proficiency, written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, 

maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision, and 

management or administration. Campbell states that the correlations between the 

13 


dimensions are small enough to consider them as distinct, however, they make up the 

general latent structure of job performance (Viswesvaran, Schmidt, & Ones, 2005). 

Viswesvaran (1993) also proposed a model of job performance. Using the lexical 

approach, as used in the development of personality taxonomy, Viswesvaran found ten 

dimensions of performance: overall job performance, job performance or productivity, 

effort, job knowledge, interpersonal competence, quality, communication, competence, 

leadership, and compliance with rules. Murphy (1990) also developed a model of job 

performance and concluded that there were four dimensions: downtime behaviors, task 

performance, interpersonal behaviors, and destructive behaviors.  

 

Where Creative Performance Fits In. Creative performance, like task 

performance, OCB, and CWB, is a stand-alone dimension. Stand-alone dimensions of 

performance have generally been developed through theory and the same also applies to 

creative performance. Modern organizations rely on creative employees and the novel 

ideas they generate to stay competitive in changing markets. Although early work implies 

that creative performance is limited to specific occupations and industries, researchers 

now argue that there is room for creativity across all occupations. That is, recently, some 

have argued that creativity is a part of job performance across occupations (Mumford, 

Hester, & Robledo, 2012; Jex & Britt, 2008). Further, creative performance has been 

linked to organizational success as well (e.g., Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995; Geroski, 

Machin, & Van Reenen, 1993). The current dissertation considers creative performance 

as job performance alongside task performance and OCB as important criteria to study in 

organizations. 

 

14 


Criteria 

Both Study 1 and Study 2 examine three different criteria â creative performance, 

task performance, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Despite being three 

different types of behavior employees may exhibit, they are all desirable performance 

dimensions in organizations. Below, I define creative performance, task performance, and 

OCB.  

Creative Performance. Although creativity can be applied to many things, 

researchers seem to agree to define creativity as âsomethingâ that is novel-original and 

useful-adaptive (Feist, 1998). This dissertation takes the organizational perspective on 

creativity, which stresses the useful component in the definition as much as the novel 

component. The useful component is important because useful ideas have the potential to 

add value to the organization (Shalley & Zhou, 2008), which is of upmost importance in 

industry. 

 

As defined above, creativity is âsomethingâ that is novel-original and useful-

adaptive (Feist, 1998). What this âsomethingâ is, however, is mostly thought of as âthe 

four Pâsâ â person, process, press, and product (Runco, 2007). Creativity as a person 

focuses on the disposition of creative individuals. Process is the mechanisms that 

underlie creative thinking or activity. The press refers to environments that interact with 

the creative person to best bring out creativity. Products are creative outcomes â which 

can range from an art piece to an individualâs creative performance on a job. Products are 

the most objective approach to measuring creativity because others can view and judge 

products and therefore inter-rater reliability can be measured (Runco, 2007). For the 

purpose of organizational outcomes, creativity is best thought of as a behavior, or 

15 


outcome. Therefore creative performance is a product. It is something that others (i.e., 

coworkers, supervisors, etc.) can observe and rate. While research has looked at creativity 

a number of ways (i.e. the four Pâs), ultimately, in organizations, creativity is a form of 

performance. Creativity is an outcome and tied to a measure of performance because 

creativity is something that a person does, and should not be confused with dispositions 

or expertise that influences this performance (i.e., motivation or personality) (Mumford, 

Hester, & Robledo, 2012). 

Task Performance and Organizational Citizenship Behavior. Organizational 

psychologists have made a distinction between formal job requirements (task 

performance) and extra-role behavior (OCB). Task performance refers to proficiency in 

formal job tasks described in a job description (Motowidlo, 2000). Organizational 

citizenship behavior includes behaviors that positively influence organizational 

effectiveness. Organ (1997) defined OCB as âperformance that supports the social and 

psychological environment in which task performance takes place.â The contribution of 

OCB extends to the broader organizational environment. Organizational citizenship 

behavior can be either directed at another individual (OCB-I) or at the organization 

(OCB-O). The types of behavior that classify as OCB are helping, courtesy, and 

conscientiousness. Helping describes assisting others. Courtesy is behaviors that are done 

to prevent problems that would otherwise occur for specifiable individuals. 

Conscientiousness refers to behaviors directed toward the organization such as attendance 

and punctuality. 

 

16 


Study 1: A Meta-analytic Approach to Assessing Overlap between Creative 

Performance, Task Performance, and OCB 

Several studies have consistently found a positive relationship between creative 

performance and both task performance and OCB. These relationships have only been 

reported incidentally and the hypotheses of interest in these studies are concerned with 

other variables. Mostly, in all studies that include creative performance and either task 

performance or OCB, both creative performance and another type of performance (task 

or OCB) are the outcome variables. 

 

Past meta-analyses have shown value in meta-analyzing the relationship between 

job performance criteria (e.g., Dalal, 2005; Viswesvaran, 2002). There are several 

reasons why examining the relationship between criteria is important. First, connecting 

creative performance to other types of performance that organizations value is essential 

for demonstrating the value of creative performance. Second, there are several insights 

that we can glean by examining this relationship, such as common antecedents of 

performance (e.g., cognitive ability, Kuncel, Hezlett, & Ones, 2004). It is to be expected 

that predictors of task performance and OCB (e.g., Barrick & Mount, 1991; Chiaburu, et 

al., 2011; Fried, 1991) should also predict creative performance, if they are all 

dimensions of overall job performance and share common variance due to a general 

factor of job performance. The literature does suggest that creative performance often 

shares similar antecedents with task performance and OCB. However, there are still some 

antecedents that have not been applied to all three criteria. If we establish that there is a 

relationship, then the independent streams of literature can help to inform each other. 

Next, different dimensions of job performance also relate with each other, so we should 

17 


understand what the correlation between creative performance and other types of 

performance is. If we understand the strength of the relationship between the different 

dimensions, we can evaluate the extent to which creative performance is a distinct 

dimension of performance. Finally, some scholars have indicated that creative 

performance is part of job performance (e.g., Jex & Britt, 2008). However, the main 

models of job performance in industrial/organizational psychology literature do not 

include creative performance. If creative performance is a dimension of job performance, 

then it should be included in theory and models of job performance, causal models of 

performance, and ultimately be included in performance evaluations. For these previous 

reasons, establishing a relationship between creativity and other types of job performance 

is essential. Therefore, I hypothesize: 

 

 

 

Hypothesis 1: Creative performance will be positively related to (a) task  

performance and (b) OCB 

As mentioned above, in order for creative performance to be established as a 

separate dimension of performance, I look at its relationship with two other criteria. 

Creative performance should share a relationship with task performance and OCB, but 

the mean correlation should not be approaching 1.00. If the mean correlation is close to 

1.00, it means that creative performance is not different than task performance or OCB, 

and therefore measuring creative performance would just provide redundant information. 

Instead, creative performance should have a correlation that is significantly different from 

1.00. Therefore, I hypothesize: 

18 


Hypothesis 2: Creative performance will be a distinct dimension of job 

performance, that is, its corrected correlation will task performance and OCB 

and be different from 1.0. 

Potential Moderators. Beyond the aforementioned hypotheses listed above, 

Study 1 also attempts to look at potential moderators of the creative performance-task 

performance and creative performance-OCB relationships. For instance, source of rating 

may influence the strength of the relationships. Demographics may also influence the 

relationships. Also, the relationship may differ depending on criteria used (i.e., OCB-I or 

OCB-O). Study 1 will test such moderators where the data is available. 

Rater Source. The first moderator variable of interest is rater source. Job 

performance can be rated by oneâs self, coworkers, or supervisors and each of these raters 

can capture a unique perspective (e.g., coworkers being more aware of their OCB than 

supervisors). Past meta-analysis on criteria (e.g., OCB and CWB; Dalal, 2005) has found 

that the strength of the relationship between OCB and CWB differs as a function of the 

source of ratings. Specifically, supervisor ratings of OCB or CWB have a stronger 

relationship than self-ratings of OCB or CWB. Thus, it stands to reason that rater source 

may moderate the relationship between performance dimensions. 

Research Question 1: Does the rater source (self vs. other-rater) moderate the 

relationship between (a) creative performance and task performance (b) creative 

performance and OCB, such that when the rater source is other-rater, the 

relationship between criteria is stronger than if the rater source is self-rater? 

Study Location. Creative performance is a popular criterion in several different 

countries. However, the importance placed on being creative may differ depending on 

19 


where the study is located. Not much research has explored this question; however, some 

cultural theories can help to explain why such differences may occur. For instance, the 

amount of power distance in the country can influence how likely someone is to be 

creative at work or engage in OCB. Power distance is the extent to which a less powerful 

person in society accepts inequality and considers it normal (Hofstede, 1984). In cultures 

where there is high power distance, employees may be less likely to propose radical 

creative ideas to their supervisors, which can influence how much creative performance 

they will have at work when the time comes for evaluations. Another cultural difference 

that may have an influence is whether the society is collectivist or individualist. 

Collectivist societies place an emphasis on the group, and individualistic societies place 

emphasis on the self (Hofstede, 1984). Because collectivist societies focus more on 

others, there can be higher instances of OCB in collectivist countries, such as those of 

Asia, in contrast to individualistic societies such as the USA and Western Europe. Thus, I 

suggest that location may influence the relationship between criteria. 

Research Question 2: Does location (US, Europe, and Asia) moderate the 

relationship between creative performance and task performance/OCB? 

Age. There are a few theories that suggest that age can be a potential moderator in 

this study. Fluid intelligence, which involves being able to think more abstractly and 

solve problems can decline with age, so younger individuals are more likely to have 

better fluid intelligence. Research has found that fluid intelligence is related to creativity 

(Nusbaum & Silvia, 2011), so younger individuals may have higher creative 

performance. Impulsivity can also affect how creative someone may be at work. Younger 

individuals tend to be more impulsive, and therefore have higher creative performance 

20 


than those who are older. Beyond these theories, several meta-analyses have examined 

the relationship between age and performance with mixed findings. For instance, 

Waldman and Avolio (1986) found that age was positively related to productivity 

measures (.27) but weakly negatively related to supervisor ratings of performance (-.14), 

suggesting that the relationship differs depending on the job performance criteria used. 

Further, McEvoy and Cascio (1989) found only a small mean correlation between age 

and performance (.06) and did not find that the relationship differed depending on the 

performance criteria (i.e. supervisor vs. productivity rating). More recently and perhaps 

most relevant to the current meta-analysis is Ng and Feldmanâs (2008) meta-analysis on 

age and dimensions of job performance. Specifically, Ng and Feldman found that age is 

unrelated to core task performance or creative performance. However, they did find that 

age had a significant and positive relationship with OCB (.08 when corrected for 

interrater reliability). Therefore, I expect that age will influence the creative performance-

OCB relationship more than the creative performance-task performance relationship. 

Research Question 3: Does age moderate the relationship between creative 

performance and task performance/OCB? 

Tenure. There are a few variables that may influence the effect of tenure on 

performance criteria, which could result in tenure moderating the relationship between 

performance criteria. Idiosyncrasy credit, which is an individualâs credit and status 

gained in a group that gives said individual more legitimacy to deviate from in-group 

norms (Hollander, 1958) can be gained with more tenure in the organization. This 

idiosyncrasy credit may result in more tenured individuals being more creative, as their 

novel ideas may be more accepted by others. Previous meta-analysis has examined the 

21 


relationship between tenure and dimensions of job performance. Ng and Feldman (2010) 

found a relationship between tenure and in-role performance at .10, however the 

credibility interval contained zero. The relationship between tenure and creative 

performance was .06, but this credibility interval also contained zero. For OCB, the 

credibility interval also contained zero. These relationships however were moderated by 

rater source; the relationship between tenure and creative performance/OCB was stronger 

when the ratings were self-ratings. 

Research Question 4: Does tenure moderate the relationship between creative 

performance and task performance/OCB? 

Gender. Another potential moderator I will explore is gender. Meta-analyses have 

indicated that females on average have been rated as performing somewhat better than 

males in operational field settings (Roth, Purvis, & Bobko, 2012), however there is 

substantial variation in this finding. Sometimes males perform better, but in a greater 

proportion of cases, females perform better. I propose that gender may influence the 

relationship between the performance dimensions. 

Research Question 5: Does gender moderate the relationship between creative 

performance and task performance/OCB? 

Direction of OCB. Finally, recall that OCB can be either directed at another 

individual (OCB-I) or at the organization (OCB-O). Creative performance may have a 

stronger relationship with either OCB-I or OCB-O. I will also explore this as a potential 

moderator. 

22 


Research Question 6: Does the creative performance-OCB relationship differ  

depending on whether the OCB is directed at the individual or at the  

organization? 

Summary. The above discussion describes the theory, research, and subsequent 

 

 

 

hypotheses behind Study 1. Thus, the purpose of Study 1 is to meta-analytically estimate 

the relationship of creative performance with both task performance and OCB. I aim to 

find the correlation between creative performance and these other criteria that 

organizations value. Uncovering this relationship provides a necessary step in order to 

demonstrate that creative performance is a distinct dimension of job performance that 

should be valued and included in theoretical and causal models of performance. 

Empirical evidence shows that there are correlations across different dimensions of 

previously described models of job performance. The goal of the current meta-analysis is 

to provide empirical evidence that creative performance also correlates with other 

dimensions of job performance (task and OCB). 

Study 2: A Process Model 

 

Study 2 attempts to build off the findings of Study 1. Once a relationship between 

the criteria is established, causal models can be developed to include creative 

performance as a stand-alone dimension of job performance. Several studies and models 

suggest that creative performance, task performance, and OCB have similar antecedents. 

Below I briefly discuss models that indicate similar antecedents and processes leads to all 

three types of performance. These models aid in the development of the causal model 

tested in Study 2. 

23 


Previous models of engagement provide the framework from which the causal 

model in Study 2 was developed. The Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R model; 

Bakker & Demerouti, 2007, 2008) proposes that job resources and personal resources 

lead to work engagement, which leads to job performance. Some of the suggested 

performance criteria in the JD-R model include in-role performance (task) and extra-role 

performance (OCB), but it also includes creative performance (Bakker & Leiter, 2010). 

Similarly, Macey and Schneider (2008) propose that both job characteristics and 

personality traits should be directly related to engagement and thus indirectly related to 

performance. Finally, Christian et al. (2011) meta-analytically examined some of the 

antecedents and consequences of work engagement. Job characteristics, leadership, and 

dispositional characteristics were the antecedents of engagement and job performance 

criteria (both task and contextual performance), and were the proposed outcome of 

engagement. However, creative performance is not included in the model. In Study 2, 

based on theoretical models (i.e. Christian et al., 2011; JD-R model) as well as expected 

findings from Study 1, creativity is included as a performance outcome in the 

hypothesized model. 

One the basis of the previously mentioned models, I developed a model that 

indicates individual differences (specifically: extraversion, conscientiousness, proactive 

personality, and self-efficacy) and job characteristics (autonomy, feedback, and 

supervisor support) lead to engagement, and engagement leads to performance (creative 

performance, task performance, and OCB). In the following sections, I review the 

relevant research on these distal antecedents of creative performance, task performance, 

and OCB. Past findings suggest these criteria share common antecedents. Further, a 

24 


detailed discussion of engagement as a mediating mechanism that comes between the 

antecedents and performance is presented. Finally, the hypothesized model is presented 

and discussed in further detail. 

Individual Difference Predictors of Performance at Work 

Substantial evidence suggests that individual differences matter in organizations. 

Conscientiousness consistently seems to be the most robust predictor of performance 

across jobs (e.g, Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000), but some evidence 

suggests that other dispositions also influence performance. Despite the fact that research 

on some individual differences (i.e. Big Five personality) is abundant, this area still 

deserves further research. Although research on individual differences and task 

performance/ OCB is well established, less is known about creative performance in 

employees. If creative performance is a dimension of job performance, then the 

independent literatures should help to develop hypotheses concerning dispositions and 

creativity at work. A relatively small amount of research on the Big Five and creativity 

has been done on employees, and instead, most of the work done in this area has been 

done on non-organizational samples (e.g., King, Walker, & Broyles, 1996; Wolfradt & 

Pretz, 2001). Further, the Big Five is a commonly used measure in organizational 

selection procedures; so understanding mechanisms that come in between these variables 

and creative performance is a very important next step in the literature. Beyond the Big 

Five, less is known about other individual differences such as proactive personality and 

self-efficacy. These variables have been found to be valuable in organizations in 

predicting job performance, (e.g., Crant, 1995; Judge & Bono, 2001) so they may also be 

useful in predicting creative performance. These other individual differences may have 

25 


incremental validity in predicting creativity over the Big Five, much like it has been 

found in the task performance literature (e.g., Crant, 1995; Crant & Batemen, 2000). 

Big Five and Creative Performance. One of the most well researched areas of 

creativity has been on Big Five personality traits. However, most of this research has 

focused on creativity in a more general sense, (i.e., creative personality or performance 

on a task that requires creativity) or creativity in more artistic terms (i.e., story writing or 

painting). Much less is known as to how this relationship translates to individuals being 

creative in organizations. Meta-analysis has also looked at personality and creativity. For 

instance, Feist (1998) conducted the first meta-analysis on personality and creativity, 

which looked at both artistic and scientific creativity. The general finding was that 

individuals who are more creative are also more open to experience and are less 

conscientious, with the largest effect size findings on these two personality traits. 

However, there were differences between artists and scientists on the directions of the 

relationships between the Big Five and creativity, which may indicate that there are some 

differences that may occur when creative job performance is the criterion rather than non-

job creativity.  

Extraversion. Extraverts have been described as energetic, bold, assertive, and 

adventurous (Goldberg, 1991). Individuals who score low on extraversion are considered 

to be over-controlled and emotionally bland, and those scoring high are active, 

passionate, and willing to take risks. These last descriptors describe creative individuals 

(King et al., 1996). Early on, researchers hypothesized that introversion should be 

positively related to creativity because of the idea that artists have been consistently 

found to be introverted due to isolation being a prerequisite for their creativity. Further, 

26 


introverts can focus more on thinking and creating because they have the ability to work 

independently and away from others (Feist, 1999). However, as creativity research 

evolved beyond just looking at artistic creativity, the finding of creativity sharing a 

positive relationship with extraversion emerged instead (e.g., King et al., 1996; Wolfadt 

& Pretz, 2001). The relationship between extraversion and creative performance has also 

been found meta-analytically. In Dilchertâs (2008) meta-analysis, the relationship 

between extraversion and creative performance was .09, however, this increased to .14 

when the criterion was creative performance at work.  

In Feistâs (1998) meta-analysis, scientists that were found to be more creative 

were also found to be more extraverted. Further, the relationship between extraversion 

and creative performance is clearer when extraversion is further broken down into the 

facet level. Feist (1998) explained that the reason creative scientists were more 

extraverted was mainly due to the confidence component rather than the social 

component of extraversion. Individuals who are confident may have better performance. 

In addition to Feistâs (1998) findings, some theorize that the social component may also 

be relevant. For instance, extraverted individuals are better at expressing their ideas, 

which may result in better creative performance at work. Further, the more socializing an 

individual does, the more ideas they may come up with, which is echoed in findings 

regarding teams. Teamwork, which includes the need to socialize, may actually enhance 

creativity because many diverse ideas may be expressed in these situations (Perry-Smith, 

2008). Past theory and findings suggest that extraversion should be a positive predictor of 

creativity at work. 

 

27 


Hypothesis 3: Extraversion will be positively related to creative performance 

Conscientiousness. Research on conscientiousness and creativity has yielded 

mixed findings. Some scholars insist that there is no relationship, as demonstrated by a 

few studies that find non-significant relationships between the two constructs. Other 

researchers have hypothesized that conscientious work habits may actually inhibit 

creative production. Further, when the definition of conscientiousness is examined, 

individual differences such as capacity for fantasy are indicative of an individual low in 

conscientiousness, but are actually relevant to creativity (King et al., 1996), further 

supporting the reasoning behind why conscientiousness should be negatively related to 

creativity. A few studies have found support for this hypothesis. For instance, Furnham et 

al. (2006) found that conscientiousness was negatively related to creativity. Wolfradt and 

Pretz (2001) found that low conscientiousness predicted story writing creativity, and 

Batey et al. (2010) found a negative relationship between conscientiousness and ideation 

behavior. 

In contrast, some research has actually found a positive link between 

conscientiousness and creativity. For instance, conscientiousness was positively related to 

self-reported creative accomplishments from the past two years in individuals low in 

creative talent in King et al. (1996), which suggests that even if someone lacks creative 

ability, they can still produce creatively through high conscientiousness. Feistâs (1998) 

meta-analysis on personality and creativity helps to give insight on the nature of the 

relationship between conscientiousness and creativity. Feistâs meta-analysis, which 

includes scientists and artists, found that the conscientiousness-creativity relationship 

differs between the groups. When comparing scientists and nonscientists, scientists were 

28 


around half a standard deviation higher on conscientiousness and controlling of impulses. 

A modest effect size differentiated creative scientists as more conscientious than less 

creative scientists. However, artists were less conscientious than non-artists. The findings 

are dramatically different when you contrast artistic creativity versus scientific creativity. 

Dilchert (2008) found meta-analytically that the relationship between the global measure 

of conscientiousness and creativity has a small, negative relationship. However the 

achievement facet of conscientiousness had a positive relationship with creative 

performance at work at .27.  

Some more research has been helpful in disentangling the relationship between 

conscientiousness and creativity. Most of this research has looked at the facet levels of 

conscientiousness. For instance, Reiter-Palmon, Illies, and Kobe-Cross (2009) 

hypothesized that the achievement and dependability components of conscientiousness 

may have different relationships with creativity and may suppress each other. They found 

that the achievement component was positively related to creativity, and dependability 

was negatively related to creativity. Because of the cooperative suppression, the overall 

factor of conscientiousness was not related to creativity, which can help to explain why 

some scholars believe there is no relationship between conscientiousness and creativity. 

Further, Batey et al. (2010) found that conscientiousness was significantly and negatively 

related to ideation behavior (r  = -.18), but the relationship was not the same for all the 

facets of conscientiousness. The competence and achievement-striving facets had 

significant positive relationships with ideation behavior ((cid:533) = .32, and .18, respectively) 

but the negative relationships with order, self-discipline, and deliberation made the 

overall relationship between conscientiousness and ideation behavior negative. Finally, 

29 


Furnham, Crump, and Swami (2009) also found a positive and significant relationship 

between divergent thinking and the competence and achievement striving facets of 

conscientiousness, yet the relationship between divergent thinking and conscientiousness 

at the factor level was non-significant. Although conflicting evidence exists about 

conscientiousness and creativity, because the criterion in this dissertation is creativity at 

work, it is likely that conscientiousness will have a positive relationship with creative 

performance, mostly through the achievement-striving and competence components of 

conscientiousness. 

Hypothesis 4: Conscientiousness will be positively related to creative  

 

performance 

Big Five and Task Performance. A few meta-analyses have established a 

relationship between Big Five and task performance. Although the mean corrected 

correlations are not very large, some of the Big Five do share positive relationships with 

performance. In Barrick and Mount (1991), conscientiousness, extraversion, and 

openness to experience were related to certain criteria (job proficiency, training 

proficiency, and personnel data). Hurtz and Donovan (2000) also found similar results in 

their meta-analysis. Specific findings and theoretical approaches about extraversion and 

conscientiousness are discussed below. 

Extraversion. Most of the findings about extraversion and task performance have 

been centered on jobs that require skills that extraverts have â social skills. However, 

being extraverted at work also has more advantages as well, such as asserting oneself and 

being confident. Barrick and Mount (1991) found a .13 corrected correlation across 

occupations.  

30 


Hypothesis 5: Extraversion will be positively related to task performance 

Conscientiousness. Meta-analyses have indicated that conscientiousness is 

consistently related to task performance across different fields (e.g., Barrick & Mount, 

1991, Hurtz & Donovan, 2000). In Barrick and Mount (1991), the corrected correlation 

was .22, and conscientiousness is the most robust personality predictor of the Big Five. 

Similarly, Hurtz and Donovan (2000) found the true-score correlation between 

conscientiousness and job performance to be .16, and again the strongest predictor of the 

Big Five. 

Hypothesis 6: Conscientiousness will be positively related to task performance 

Big Five and OCB. Several studies have found modest relationships between the 

Big Five and OCB (e.g., Chiaburu, et al., 2011; Kiffen-Petersen, Jordan, & Soutar, 2011; 

Taylor, Kluemper, & Mossholder, 2010). Meta-analysis on the Big Five and OCB has 

found corrected correlations of .22 for conscientiousness, .17 for agreeableness, .15 for 

emotional stability, .11 for extraversion, and .17 for openness to experience. Further, the 

Big Five predict OCB over and above job satisfaction (Chiaburu et al., 2011). Of 

particular interest for Study 2 are the relationships between extraversion and OCB and the 

relationship between conscientiousness and OCB. 

Extraversion. Although the mean corrected correlation between extraversion and 

contextual performance is only .11 (Chiaburu et al., 2011), hypotheses suggest that 

extraverts are often fixed on âgetting aheadâ (Hogan & Holland, 2003). This desire to 

gain power and status may drive individuals to engage in more OCB. Further, the social 

nature of extraverts may make these helping behaviors easier to engage in, as it may 

come naturally for extraverts. There is evidence to suggest that both the confidence and 

31 


the social aspects of extraversion help to drive OCB. Further, the corrected correlation 

between extraversion and interpersonal facilitation in Hurtz and Donovan (2000) was .10. 

Hypothesis 7: Extraversion will be positively related to OCB 

Conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is a socially desired trait and conscientious 

individuals tend to behave in ways that individuals value at work. The achievement-

striving facet of conscientiousness drives individuals to succeed at work by offering to do 

extra-role jobs. Conscientious individuals also tend to spend more time on tasks, which 

can result in engaging in more OCB. Further, being competent is also likely to make an 

individual more willing to help out a colleague, because they think they are capable and 

actually able to provide help. Meta-analytically, conscientiousness is the strongest Big 

Five predictor of OCB (Chiaburu, et al., 2011) and in Hurtz and Donovan (2000) 

conscientiousness and interpersonal facilitation had a corrected correlation of .18. 

Hypothesis 8: Conscientiousness will be positively related to OCB. 

Proactive Personality and Creative Performance. Proactive personality is a 

stable disposition that an individual has to take personal initiative in a broad range of 

activities and situations (Siebert et al., 2001). Proactive individuals are unconstrained by 

situational forces and they also effect environmental change (Bateman & Crant, 1993). 

Bateman and Crant (1993) state that the propensity that proactive individuals have to 

identify opportunities for improvement can lead to innovative behavior. Proactive 

personality should lead to creativity because proactive individuals seek opportunities to 

identify new ways of doing things, which can result in creativity (Seibert et al., 2001). 

Proactive individuals also may have more confidence to see their ideas through, resulting 

in higher creative performance at work. 

32 


Although there have not been many studies that look at the relationship between 

proactive personality and creative performance, the studies that have looked at the 

relationship have found a positive relationship. Seibert et al. (2001) found that proactive 

personality was related to innovative behavior in their sample of university alumni 

comprised of many different occupations ranging from engineering to finance. Kim et al. 

(2009) longitudinally examined the relationship between proactive personality and 

employee creativity. The sample of employees from Hong Kong revealed that proactive 

personality positively predicted creativity, and that creativity fully mediated the 

relationship between proactive personality and career satisfaction and perceived insider 

status. Kim et al. (2010) also found a relationship between proactive personality and 

creativity in a South Korean sample. The relationship was stronger when the job 

requirement for creativity and supervisory support for creativity were both high. 

Hypothesis 9: Proactive personality will be positively related to creative 

performance 

Proactive Personality and Task Performance. Proactive individuals may have 

higher job performance because they are actively selecting environments that lead to 

effective job performance (Crant, 1995). Research has established that proactive 

personality is related to task performance (e.g.; Chan, 2006; Crant, 1995; Thomas, 

Whitman, & Viswesvaran, 2010). Further, proactive personality also has been shown to 

have incremental validity over traditionally studied personality variables such as the Big 

Five (e.g., Crant, 1995; Crant & Batemen, 2000). Siebert et al.âs (2001) model found that 

a proactive personality is related to both extrinsic and intrinsic career success (salary 

33 


progression, promotion, and career satisfaction) through voice, innovation, career 

initiative, and political knowledge. 

Hypothesis 10: Proactive personality will be positively related to task  

 

performance 

Proactive Personality and OCB. Both proactive personality and OCB focus on 

going beyond regular job requirements and positively contributing to the organization 

(Frese, Kring, Soose, & Zempel, 1996). However, very little research has empirically 

examined this relationship despite theories that suggest the two should have a strong 

relationship. Li, Liang, and Crant (2010) did not find a direct significant relationship 

between proactive personality and OCB, although they did find that the relationship was 

moderated by the procedural justice climate in the sample of Chinese employees. 

However, drawing from task performance literature, which shows there is a positive 

relationship between proactive personality and task performance, and the shared focuses 

of both proactivity and OCB, proactive personality should be positively related to OCB. 

Hypothesis 11: Proactive personality will be positively related to OCB. 

Self-efficacy and Creative Performance.  Self-efficacy is an individualâs beliefs 

in their capabilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action 

needed to exercise control over events in their lives (Wood & Bandura, 1989). Bandura 

(1997) suggests that self-efficacy is an essential part of creative performance, although 

unlike other researchers in the area, Bandura does not consider self-efficacy to be a 

disposition. 

Feist (1998) found self-confidence to be a key characteristic of creative 

individuals because of the confidence one must have in their talent to be creative. Prabhu, 

34 


Sutton, and Sauser (2008) found support for a positive relationship between self-efficacy 

and creativity, although intrinsic motivation completely mediated this relationship in the 

sample of undergraduates. The relationship between self-efficacy and creativity 

performance has also been found in organizational settings. In Liao, Liu, and Loi (2010), 

self-efficacy positively predicted creativity (operationalized as creativity bonuses the 

employees received) in a sample of Chinese technicians. Dilchertâs (2008) meta-analysis 

on creativity at work found that the relationship between work-specific self-efficacy and 

creative performance (rated by others) was .27. 

Hypothesis 12: Self-efficacy will be positively related to creative performance 

Self-efficacy and Task Performance. Essentially, self-efficacy is the perceived 

capability for performing a specific task (Bandura, 1997). Past research is supportive of 

the importance of self-efficacy for performance (e.g., Judge & Bono, 2001). Several 

studies have found a positive relationship between self-efficacy and task performance. 

For instance, Hu and Liden (2013) found that self-efficacy partially mediated the 

relationship between relative leader-member-exchange (LMX) and in role-performance 

in their sample of teams. 

Hypothesis 13: Self-efficacy will be positively related to task performance 

Self-efficacy and OCB. Self-efficacy has also been postulated as a predictor of 

OCB. Chiu and Chen (2005) found a positive relationship between self-efficacy and OCB 

in electronic company employees, which included administrative and engineering roles, 

showing that self-efficacy can be a valuable trait in an assortment of jobs. Research also 

found that self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship between relative LMX and OCB 

in Hu and Liden (2013). If an individual believes they are competent at their job they are 

35 


more likely to share their knowledge with coworkers and offer to help them even if it is 

not a formal job requirement. 

Hypothesis 14: Self-efficacy will be positively related to OCB 

Job Characteristic Predictors of Performance at Work 

 

Aside from individual difference predictors, there are a number of contextual 

factors that also influence performance at work. The prediction of job characteristics on 

performance a pertinent area of research because managers can have a real influence on 

designing jobs so they can influence performance, rather than relying on pre-existing 

individual differences discussed above. Below three different job characteristics â 

autonomy, feedback, and supervisor support are discussed as predictors of job 

performance. 

Autonomy and Creative Performance. Autonomy has been postulated as an 

important feature for fostering creativity in the work environment. For instance, Shalley 

(2008) states if an organization provides a context that is conducive to creativity then 

creative activity is more likely to occur. When employees have ownership and control 

over their work, they are intrinsically motivated and engage more in problem solving 

(Hennessey & Amabile, 2010). Autonomy motivates individuals to try new ideas and to 

learn from their consequences, which expands their skill-set (Coelho & Augusto, 2010). 

Research on autonomy as a situational characteristic has found that it is related to 

employees undertaking creative action (e.g., Unsworth & Clegg, 2010). 

Self-determination theory posits that extrinsically motivated behavior is a form of 

nonautonomous or controlled behavior and intrinsic motivation is a form of autonomous 

behavior. Research in self-determination theory has demonstrated that controlling 

36 


environmental factors (such as rewards or harsh deadlines) can negatively influence the 

quality of functioning in many ways (Deci & Ryan, 1985). In contrast, self-determination 

theory promotes autonomy as a better route to creative performance. Autonomy is critical 

for creative productivity because when employees feel a degree of ownership in, or 

control over their work, they will be intrinsically motivated and will be more likely to 

fully engage their cognitive processes in problem solving (Hennessy & Amabile, 2010).  

Several studies have found autonomy at work to be positively related to employee 

creativity. For instance, Coelho and Augusto (2010) found autonomy to have a positive 

influence on creativity in their sample of frontline service employees. Unsworth and 

Clegg (2010) interviewed engineers and found that autonomy is a cue employees use to 

decide whether or not taking creative action is worthwhile. Further, in Dilchertâs (2008) 

meta-analysis, employee perceptions of autonomy were related to both supervisor and 

self-ratings of creativity (.42 and .45, respectively). 

Hypothesis 15: Autonomy will be positively related to creative performance 

Autonomy and Task Performance. Hackman and Oldham (1976) have long 

postulated that autonomy is one of the key factors in job design that influences job 

performance. When individuals perceive that they can directly affect their work 

environment, they have higher task performance. When individuals are allowed 

autonomy at work, they can determine how and when they do many of the aspects of 

their job. Employees also can increase the scope of their job to enhance their 

performance. Autonomy enhances intrinsic motivation in employees, and the more 

motivation employees have, the better they perform. Meta-analysis has shown that indeed 

autonomy is associated with several organizational outcomes, including performance and 

37 


well-being. The mean correlation between autonomy and performance is .18 (Spector, 

1986).  

Hypothesis 16: Autonomy will be positively related to task performance 

Autonomy and OCB. When individuals are given more autonomy on their job 

they are allowed more freedom and control. Freedom and control allows individuals to 

engage in extra behaviors that benefit the organization such as taking the time to help out 

others. Further, as discussed above in relation to self-determination theory, autonomy 

increases motivation, which should allow individuals to put more effort into their work, 

and thus leads to more OCB. Indeed, studies have found a positive relationship between 

autonomy and OCB such as Runhaar, Konermann, and Sanders (2013) who found that 

autonomy was positively related to both OCB directed at the organization and to OCB 

directed at individuals in a sample of teachers.  

Hypothesis 17: Autonomy will be positively related to OCB 

Feedback and Creative Performance. Another job characteristic that has 

resulted in increased creative performance is feedback. Feedback provides employees 

with information that is focused on learning, development, and improving performance 

(Zhou, 2003). This feedback should be clear and direct information about oneâs own job 

performance (Hackman & Oldham, 1980). Feedback can also provide information about 

an employeeâs current effort on a creative project and can stimulate them to explore 

alternate courses, which can result in a more creative product (Coelho & Augusto, 2010). 

Further, feedback instills a learning orientation into employees that aids in creativity. 

When feedback is given to employees, they can channel their thinking into improvement 

and this expanded thinking can help employees come up with new ideas (George & 

38 


Zhou, 2007). However, when employees do not receive feedback they do not know how 

to feel about their performance, which reduces their motivation and adversely affect 

creativity (Coelho & Augusto, 2010).  

Zhou (2008) suggested four reasons why feedback should increase creativity in 

employees. First of all, feedback should increase intrinsic motivation, which has been 

widely found to increase creativity (e.g., Prabhu et al., 2008). Secondly, feedback can 

also have an effect on mood states, and affect has been found be related to creativity (e.g., 

George & Zhou, 2007). Thirdly, feedback can help to clarify the standards of creative 

output. Individuals are better able to understand what is expected of them and adjust 

accordingly. Finally, feedback also helps to facilitate creativity-relevant skills and 

strategies. 

Noefer, Stegmaier, Molter, and Sonntag (2009) found that feedback was 

positively correlated with idea generation. Further, feedback also moderated the 

relationship between time pressure and skill variety with idea generation and 

implementation. Feedback was positively related to creativity in frontline service 

employees in Coelho and Augusto (2010). Giving higher feedback to employees has also 

been positively correlated with team creativity (Joo, Song, Lim, & Yoon, 2012). Finally, 

In Slijkhuis, Rietzschel, and Van Yperen (2013), informational evaluations were related 

to higher performance, however only in individuals who were low in personal need for 

structure.  

Hypothesis 18: Feedback will be positively related to creative performance 

Feedback and Task Performance. Feedback is another job design dimension 

that Hackman and Oldham (1976) have long emphasized to increase performance in 

39 


employees. Feedback gives employees information about their performance, which can 

help them to adjust their performance to do better. Feedback is also essential in 

motivating employees, which should increase job performance. Studies have found this 

job characteristic to be related to task performance (e.g., Vigoda-Gadot & Angert, 2007). 

Friedâs (1991) meta-analysis found that the corrected correlation between feedback (as 

measured by the Job Diagnostics Survey) and performance was .22. 

Hypothesis 19: Feedback will be positively related to task performance 

Feedback and OCB. Feedback has an influence on motivating employees, which 

again should increase OCB as it increases task and creative performance. Feedback 

positively influences employees by giving them information about how they perform. 

This information that employees are given can be integrated into helping others and the 

organization through OCB. Receiving feedback can also increase positive affect. This 

increase in employeeâs positive affect should lead to individuals engaging in OCB. Job 

feedback was positively related to OCB in Chiu and Chen (2005), Vigoda-Gadot and 

Angert (2007), as well as OCB intentions in Sommer and Kulkarni (2012). 

Hypothesis 20: Feedback will be positively related to OCB 

Supervisor Support and Creative Performance. Having support from 

supervisors is an important variable to consider in predicting whether or not employees 

will be creative. For instance, if an individual feels they will be punished for a failed 

attempt at being creative they are more likely to continue performing the way they always 

have rather than attempt a new and creative approach to doing their work (Shalley, 2008). 

If you encourage creative thinking styles, then you allow for more creative output. 

Supervisors should reward employees for their creative attempts, even if the attempts are 

40 


unsuccessful (Williams & Yang, 1999). Oldham and Cummings (1996) found that one of 

the factors most important for employee creativity was supportive supervision. Amabile 

et al. (2004) found that leader support predicted peer-rated creativity in seven companies. 

Meta-analytically, Dilchert (2008) found that general support from work sources was 

related to supervisor ratings of creative performance (.21) and LMX predicted supervisor 

ratings of creative performance (.41) and self-ratings of creative performance (.22). 

Hypothesis 21: Supervisor support will be positively related to creative  

 

performance 

Supervisor Support and Task Performance. When an individual feels 

supported by their supervisor, this is likely to result in better performance. Chan (2006) 

found a positive relationship between perceived supervisor support and job performance 

in a sample of employees at a rehabilitation agency. Supervisor support even moderated 

the relationship between job insecurity and task performance in Schreurs, Hetty van 

Emmerick, Gunter, and Germeys (2012). 

Hypothesis 22: Supervisor support will be positively related to task performance 

Supervisor Support and OCB. When supervisors show support, mutual trust 

and obligations are established, which can motivate employees to go beyond their formal 

job requirements and engage in OCB (Podsakoff, McKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000). 

Supervisor support was positively related to both OCB-I and OCB-O in Chen and Chiu 

(2008) through job satisfaction. When employees feel support from their supervisor they 

are likely satisfied, and satisfaction is a large predictor of employeesâ OCB (Organ & 

Ryan, 1995). Kuvaas and Dysvik (2010) found a positive correlation between perceived 

supervisor support and OCB. Although not much research has been done in this area, the 

41 


studies that have looked at the relationship between supervisor support and OCB show 

promise that there is a positive relationship between the two constructs. 

H23: Supervisor support will be positively related to OCB 

Engagement  

 

I have discussed the antecedents of creative performance, task performance, and 

OCB. Next I will discuss a variable that predicts performance that is often conceptualized 

as a mediator between individual differences/job characteristics and performance: 

engagement. Engagement has intuitive appeal to both researchers and practitioners. 

Research mostly supports that engagement is a positive attribute of employees, as 

engagement consistently predicts creative performance (e.g., Bakker et al., 2007), task 

performance, and OCB (e.g., Christian et al., 2011). Beyond performance, engaged 

workers have higher organizational commitment, better health, and are less likely to 

turnover (Halbesleben, 2010). Below, relevant theory on engagement is reviewed, and its 

influence on performance at work is discussed, as well as how it operates as a mediator in 

this dissertationâs proposed model. 

Definition and Theory. Khan (1990, p. 694) was the first to introduce the 

construct of engagement as âharnessing of organization membersâ selves to their work 

roles; in engagement people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, 

emotionally, and mentally during their role performances.â Basically, engagement refers 

to high levels of personal investment in the work tasks performed on a job (Christian et 

al., 2011). Cognitive engagement occurs when individuals think about their work and the 

work environment, and represents intellectual commitment to the organization. 

Emotional engagement concerns emotional involvement with work. Behavior 

42 


engagement is a physical manifestation of cognitive and emotional engagement and is 

often associated with job performance (Shuck & Reio, 2011). 

Research on engagement as a construct stemmed out of burnout research in order 

to look at the more positive, and hence, opposite side of burnout (Schaufeli et al., 2002). 

Conceptualization used in this dissertation is engagement as a motivational variable as 

described and used in Bakker and Leiter (2010). As a mediator in Study 2, engagement is 

defined as âa positive, fulfilling, affective-motivational state of work-related well-being 

that can be seen as the antipode of job burnoutâ (Leiter & Bakker, 2010). Engagement 

explains what traditional studies of work motivation have overlooked. Engagement 

researchers believe that employees have differing degrees and dimensions of themselves 

that act in accord to something internal (Khan & Fellows, 2013). Employees who are 

engaged have high levels of energy, are enthusiastically involved in their work (Bakker, 

Schaufeli, Leiter, & Taris, 2008), and are able to deal completely with their job demands 

(Schaufeli et al., 2002). This differs from the traditional thought that motivation in 

employees is either on or off; instead, engagement implies that employees are more 

complicated than that (Khan & Fellows, 2013). 

Engagement includes three factors (1) vigor, (2) dedication, and (3) absorption. 

Vigor is âhigh levels of energy and mental resilience while working, willingness to invest 

effort in oneâs work, and persistence in the face of difficulties.â Dedication is âa sense of 

significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.â Absorption is âbeing fully 

concentrated and deeply engrossed in oneâs work, whereby time passes quickly and one 

has difficulties with detaching oneself from workâ (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Absorption is 

similar to âflow,â a state of optimal experience that includes focused attention, clear 

43 


mind, mind and body unison, effortless concentration, complete control, loss of self-

consciousness, distortion of time, and intrinsic enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). 

However, absorption differs from flow in that flow is more complex, and consists of 

short-tem âpeaksâ rather than the more pervasive and persistent state of engagement 

(Schaufeli et al., 2002). 

Job Demands-Resources Model. The model that best describes the prediction of 

engagement is the job demands-resources model (JD-R model; Demerouti, Bakker, 

Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001). It is the theoretical framework that is commonly applied 

to engagement research (e.g., Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, Xanthopoulou, 2007). In the 

job demands-resources model (JD-R Model), demands refer to any âphysical, social, or 

organizational aspect of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort and are 

therefore associated with certain physiological and psychological costsâ, such as 

exhaustion. Resources refer to âphysical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects 

of the job that may be a function in achieving goals at work, reducing job demands at the 

associated physiological and psychological costs, and stimulate personal growth and 

developmentâ (Demerouti et al., 2001). The theory posits that these resources help to 

keep individuals physically and psychologically healthy even when job demands are 

high. Job demands and resources are negatively correlated because job demands may 

prevent the mobilization of job resources (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007). 

There are four levels of job resources â organization, interpersonal and social 

relations, organization of work, and task. At the organization level, these resources can 

include salary or career opportunities. Support from others at work (coworker or 

supervisor) is an example of interpersonal and social relationship resources. 

44 


Organization of work includes role clarity or participation in any decision-making. 

Finally, task resources are variables such as feedback or autonomy (Bakker, Demerouti, 

& Verbeke, 2004).  

 

The JD-R model is a dual process model; there are two sets of working conditions 

that evoke two different processes (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Schaufeli & Bakker, 

2004). The demands exhaust employees and lead to burnout and the resources lead to 

employee engagement. This dissertation focuses on the part of the JD-R model where 

resources lead to employee engagement, which then leads to positive outcomes, such as 

job performance. 

Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions.  Although not frequently 

used as a theory of engagement in comparison to the JD-R model, Fredericksonâs (2001) 

broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions is also relevant in explaining engagement. 

Broaden-and-Build theory posits that positive emotions (joy, interest, contentment) share 

the ability to broaden momentary thought-action repertoires. They also help build 

employeesâ personal resources through the thoughts and actions that come to mind. In 

this vein, the positive emotion of joy, for instance, broadens resources by creating the 

urge to play and therefore be creative. These emotions produce broad and flexible 

cognitive organization and the ability to integrate diverse material. Broaden-and-Build 

theory can help explain how engagement may lead to individuals being more creative at 

work. Further, some research has found support for increased job performance (via 

asking more questions in business meetings) when the ratio of positive to negative 

emotions in managers is relatively high (Fredrickson & Losada, 2005). 

 

45 


Engagement and Performance 

 

Research has found that engagement is a strong predictor of employee 

performance. Some researchers appreciate that engagement is related to overall well-

being, however, organizations are focused mostly on more tangible outcomes, and 

therefore, job performance. Below I discuss some of the literature that has found positive 

relationships between engagement and job performance. 

Engagement and Creative Performance. Several studies have found a positive 

and significant relationship between engagement and creative performance. Most of these 

studies hypothesize that because engagement leads to performance, and the same 

relationship should hold true for creative performance as well. The findings from Study 1 

should help clarify whether or not the independent literatures should inform each other 

about the processes that influence different types of job performance. Other studies (i.e., 

Agarwal, Datta, Blake-Beard, & Bhargava, 2012) rely on theories about engagement and 

positive emotions (i.e., Broaden-and-Build; Fredrickson, 2001). Bakker et al. (2007) 

found a positive and significant relationship between all three facets of engagement and 

innovativeness in a sample of Finnish teachers. In a sample of research and design 

employees in India, work engagement was positively related to innovativeness, measured 

by the quest for new products or improvements in management, effective implementation 

of innovations, the application in project management, and degree of novelty within the 

firm and market (Bhatnagar, 2012). Chughtai and Buckley (2011) also found that 

engagement predicted innovative work behavior in Irish research scientists; but this 

relationship was partially mediated by learning goal orientation. Gorgieviski et al. (2010) 

also found positive correlations between engagement and self-reported innovativeness in 

46 


both a Dutch employee sample and a self-employed sample. Agarwal et al. (2012) found 

that engagement lead to innovative work behavior, and that engagement mediated the 

relationship between Leader-Member-Exchange (LMX) and innovative work behavior in 

Indian managers. 

Hypothesis 24: Engagement will be positively related to creative performance 

 

Engagement and Task Performance. Several studies have linked engagement to 

higher performance in employees. Because engagement is a motivational variable, the 

amount of intensity and persistence individuals have toward their work is increased, and 

therefore employees are likely to have higher task performance when they are engaged. 

Employees are also more focused, which helps to increase task performance (Christian et 

al., 2011). In Habeslebenâs (2010) meta-analysis, the estimated population correlation 

between engagement and performance, corrected for artifacts was .36. Further, vigor and 

performance had an estimated population correlation of .29 and dedication and 

performance had an estimated population correlation of .27. In Christian et al. (2011) the 

mean corrected correlation (corrected for unreliability in the predictor and criterion) was 

.45 for the relationship between UWES and task performance, and .30 for other measures 

of engagement and task performance. However, it should be noted that the number of 

unique studies in both of the meta-analysis was not ideal; all included less than 10 studies 

in their calculations. This necessitates further study in organizations on the relationship 

between engagement and performance.  

 

Hypothesis 25: Engagement will be positively related to task performance 

Engagement and OCB. A relationship between engagement and OCB has also 

been established. When individuals are invested at work, as they are when they are 

47 


engaged, they should engage in more extra-role behavior (Christian et al., 2011). 

Organizational citizenship behaviors are discretionary behaviors that are not a part of the 

formal job requirement, and engagement itself is often thought of as going beyond the 

role of the job, so the finding that there is a relationship between engagement and OCB is 

not surprising. Christian et al. (2011) found a mean corrected correlation of .34 between 

engagement and contextual performance (.31 for the UWES, and .48 for other measures 

of engagement); again, the amount of studies included in the meta-analysis was not ideal, 

necessitating more studies in this area. 

Hypothesis 26: Engagement will be positively related to OCB 

Engagement as a Mediator 

Although studies have identified the individual differences and job characteristics 

discussed above as predictors of creative performance, task performance, and OCB, it is 

possible that there is a mediating mechanism that links them to performance, by way of a 

process â engagement. Khan (1990) proposed that both individual and organizational 

factors influence the psychological experience of work, and then in turn, the experience 

drives behavior at work. Most of the conceptual framework on engagement has 

postulated engagement as a mediating variable (Bakker and Leiterâs (2010) model, based 

on Bakker and Demerouti, 2007, 2008; Christian et al., 2011, Macey & Schneider, 2008), 

and this is how engagement is conceptualized in Study 2. Below I discuss the relationship 

between the previously reviewed individual differences and job characteristics with 

engagement and explain engagementâs role as a mediator. 

Extraversion and Engagement. A few studies have found that extraversion can 

predict engagement. For instance, Kim, Shin, and Swanger (2009) hypothesized that 

48 


extraversion should be related to engagement because of vigor. Both extraversion and 

vigor share the characteristic of high energy, suggesting that the two should possibly be 

related. Extraversion was also positively related to engagement in Wefald, Reichard, and 

Serrano (2011) and Langelaan, Bakker, van Doornen, and Schaufeli (2007). Extraversion 

was significantly correlated with the UWES as well as all three facets of engagement in 

Muilenburg-Trevinoâs (2009) sample of non-profit employees in the US. Extraverts will 

find more energy from the social aspects of their job, which should lead to being more 

engaged, which then leads to better performance. Further, the confidence component of 

extraversion would lead individuals to be more confident in their work, and from this 

confidence they will be more engaged, and therefore have better performance. 

Hypothesis 27: Engagement will mediate the relationship between extraversion  

 

and (a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Conscientiousness and Engagement. Christian et al. (2011) explain that 

conscientiousness should predict engagement because conscientious individuals have a 

strong sense of responsibility, which is likely to result in employees being more involved 

in their job tasks. Achievement-striving, a facet of conscientiousness, has been positively 

related to engagement as well (e.g., Hallberg, Johansson, & Schaufeli, 2007). The 

achievement-striving facet should be related to engagement because these individuals 

have goals and motivation. The competence facet of conscientiousness also explains why 

there should be a relationship with engagement because individuals who feel like they 

know their job well are likely to be more engaged in their work. As per the definition of 

vigor, individuals should persist because of their competence even when there are 

difficulties. Kim et al. (2009) found a positive correlation between conscientiousness and 

49 


engagement in a sample of US employees. Conscientiousness was positively correlated 

with engagement in Wefald et al. (2011). Conscientiousness was also positively 

correlated with the UWES and its three facets in a sample of non-profit US employees 

(Muilenburg-Trevino, 2009). The mean correlation between conscientiousness and 

engagement in Christian et al. (2001) was .42.  

Hypothesis 28: Engagement will mediate the relationship between  

 

conscientiousness and (a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c)  

OCB 

Proactive Personality and Engagement. Proactive personality has been 

hypothesized to be a predictor of engagement. Proactive personality comprises more than 

just taking initiatives, but it also includes searching for learning opportunities and 

engaging in learning activities (Frese et al., 1996). Christian et al. (2011) suggest that 

proactive personality should be linked to engagement because of the involvement aspect 

of proactive individualsâ initiative and perseverance. The individuals who are more 

involved in their work environment are also likely to immerse themselves in their work, 

thus leading to more engagement. Dikkers, Jansen, Lange, Vinkenburg, & Kooij (2009) 

were the first to look at proactive personality as a predictor of engagement. Their two-

wave study of Dutch government employees found that proactive personality predicted 

engagement 18 months later. In Christian et al. (2011)âs meta-analysis on engagement, 

the mean corrected correlation between proactive personality and engagement was .44, 

however, only six studies were included in the analysis. Proactive personality leads to 

performance because proactive individuals find new and better ways of doing things as 

part of their behavior, which leads to better performance. By doing so, they also become 

50 


involved in their work, leading to engagement. Therefore, engagement should mediate 

the relationship between proactive personality and performance.  

Hypothesis 29: Engagement will mediate the relationship between proactive  

 

personality and (a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Self-efficacy and Engagement. Self-efficacy is a part of a personâs psychological 

capital and is a personal resource that facilitates engagement (Bakker & Leiter, 2010). 

Engagement is also a motivational variable. Prahbu et al. (2008) theorize that because 

self-efficacy has a motivational component as well, an individual who has confidence in 

their work (i.e. high self-efficacy) has more motivation to do their job and will find it 

much more interesting (i.e., they should be engaged). Self-efficacy can be a motivator 

and can have a positive influence on engagement. Several studies have demonstrated that 

as a personal resource, self-efficacy, does in fact have a positive influence on engagement 

(e.g., Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2007; Xanthopoulou, Bakker, 

Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2009).  

Hypothesis 30: Engagement will mediate the relationship between self-efficacy  

 

 and (a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Autonomy and Engagement. Job resources are working conditions that provide 

resources for individual employees (Hakanen & Roodt, 2010). These resources can be 

physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects. These resources can be on four 

levels â organization, interpersonal, organization of work, and task. Autonomy is an 

example of the task level of these resources that can intrinsically motivate individuals and 

enhance their potential for both growth and learning (Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, & 

Xanthopoulou, 2007). In Halbeslebenâs (2010) meta-analysis, job resources had a mean 

51 


corrected correlation of .35 with engagement, .30 with vigor, .34 with dedication, and .25 

with absorption. Further, in Christian et al.âs (2011) meta-analysis, the mean corrected 

correlation between autonomy and engagement was .39. Self-determination posits that 

autonomy fulfills the basic human need for control (Salanova, Schaufeli, Xanthopoulou, 

& Bakker, 2010). Self-determination theory research also indicates that when employees 

are motivated at work, their attention and effort is focused on their job, leading to better 

performance. Attention may also lead employees to be more persistent and more likely to 

consider alternative approaches, which should result in more creativity (Shalley, 2008), 

which describes the mediating role of engagement in the relationship between autonomy 

and performance. 

Hypothesis 31: Engagement will mediate the relationship between autonomy and  

 

(a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Feedback and Engagement. Feedback, which is a component of Hackman and 

Oldhamâs (1976) job characteristics theory, is a feature of the work environment that 

should facilitate motivation. Motivation affects the extent to which a person is willing to 

invest energy into job tasks. Feedback falls under the task level of job resources because 

it motivates individuals to grow and learn from the feedback they receive (Bakker et al., 

2007). Further, self-determination theory also posits that feedback fulfills basic human 

needs such as competence (Salanova, Schaufeli,, Xanthopoulou, & Bakker, 2010). In 

Christian et al. (2011) the mean corrected correlation between feedback and engagement 

was .33.  

 

52 


Hypothesis 32: Engagement will mediate the relationship between feedback and  

 

(a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Supervisor Support and Engagement. Supervisor support falls under the 

interpersonal level of job resources (Bakker et al., 2007). Again, these job resources have 

a positive influence on engagement. Chughtai and Buckley (2011) found that trust in 

supervisor was positively related to engagement. In Christian et al. (2011)âs meta-

analysis, the mean corrected correlation between social support and engagement was .32. 

Supervisor support influences employee engagement, which should then lead to higher 

performance. 

Hypothesis 33: Engagement will mediate the relationship between supervisor 

 

support and (a) creative performance, (b) task performance, and (c) OCB 

Hypothesized Model for Study 2 

 

The model to be tested in Study 2 is primarily drawn from suggested models of 

engagement (Bakker & Lieter, 2010, based off Bakker & Demerouti, 2007, 2008; 

Christian et al., 2010) and is presented below (Figures 1 and 2). Overall, Study 2âs model 

specifies that both individual differences and job characteristics should have an impact on 

employee engagement, which in turn, should have a positive influence on performance at 

work. 

 

While early meta-analysis (Christian et al., 2011) looked at a similar model, it did 

not include creative performance. There is strong evidence to suggest that creative 

performance should be included, based both on theory (Bakker & Lieter, 2010), and past 

findings. Further, the results from Study 1 should also support this idea that creativity is a

CHAPTER III: METHODS 

 

This dissertation is comprised of two related studies. Study 1 uses meta-analysis 

to estimate the relationships between creative performance and task performance/OCB. 

Study 2 tests a process model that includes creative performance, task performance, and 

OCB as the dependent variables. Below I describe the methods and analytic procedures 

used in these studies. 

Overview 

Study 1 

Study 1 is a meta-analytic synthesis of the relationships between creative 

performance and other performance dimensions. Specifically, I look at the correlation 

between creative performance and task performance and the correlation between creative 

performance and OCB. Further, I also explore the influence of the following moderators 

on these relationships as research questions: rating source, study location, age, tenure, 

gender, and direction of OCB (OCB-I vs. OCB-O). 

Database 

To identify studies to be included in the meta-analysis, I searched PsycInfo, 

ABI/Inform, and Google Scholar electronic databases.  To identify creative performance-

task performance relationships, I used the following search terms: ("creativ*" OR 

"innovat*") AND ("job performance" OR "task performance" OR  âin-role 

performanceâ).  To identify creative performance-OCB relationships, I used the 

following search terms: ("creativ*" OR "innovat*") AND ("organizational citizenship 

behavior" OR "organizational citizenship behaviour" OR "contextual performance" OR 

"contextual behavior" OR "contextual behaviour" OR "extrarole behavior" OR "extra-

56 


role behavior" OR "extra role behavior" OR "extrarole behaviour" OR "extra-role 

behaviour" OR "extra role behaviour").  These searches yielded a total of 509 studies for 

creative performance-task performance and 38 studies for creative performance- OCB.  

Inclusion Criteria. Selection for inclusion was based on the following criteria. 

First, the study has to report zero-order correlations between a measure of 

creativity/innovation performance and a measure of Task Performance/OCB, or statistics 

that could be converted to zero-order correlations. Second, the study had to be conducted 

on a working sample. Third, creativity or innovation scales had to be measure of behavior 

(i.e. not performance on creativity test or use of a creative sample of work such as an art 

piece), namely creative performance at work. Of the 509 initial task performance studies, 

27 met these criteria, and of the 38 OCB studies, 15 met these criteria.  

Among the studies that met these initial criteria, two of the studies in the creative 

performance-task performance meta-analysis had mixed raters. Specifically, one study 

used self-ratings of creative performance and supervisory ratings of task performance 

(Janssen & Giebels, 2013), and the other study used supervisory ratings of creative 

performance and self-ratings of task performance (Laurence, 2010). Because there were 

only two studies like this, they were excluded from analyses because there was only one 

study of each and it is not possible to meta-analyze one study. Thus, for all studies 

included, the same rater rated both creative performance and task performance/OCB. 

This brought the final amount of studies included in the creative performance-task 

performance meta-analysis to 25 (while the number of creative performance-OCB studies 

remained 15). 

 

57 


Procedure 

Both myself and another Doctoral candidate coded each study for the following 

information: correlation, reliability (i.e., coefficient alpha), sample size, and moderators. 

Inter-coder agreement was initially 96% and all disagreements were resolved between us, 

resulting in 100% agreement. 

Meta-analytic calculations were conducted according to the procedures outlined 

by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). I computed the sample size-weighted uncorrected 

correlation, its standard deviation, the sample size-weighted corrected correlation ((cid:545)), its 

standard deviation, 80% credibility interval, and 95% confidence interval. The 80% 

credibility interval is an index of the variability among effect sizes included in the 

analyses. The 95% confidence interval describes the likely amount of error in the 

estimate of (cid:545) due to sampling error. Corrections for unreliability were made using an 

artifact distribution of the coefficient alpha reliability estimates reported in the studies.  

Although the use of interrater reliability is more appropriate for correcting performance 

ratings (cf. Schmidt, Viswesvaran, & Ones, 2000; Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 2008), 

I did not find much interrater reliability in the database compiled here.  

Where studies included multiple measures of the same construct, I formed 

composites using the methods outlined by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). I estimated the 

reliability of composites using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. Mostly this 

applied to studies that had two measures of OCB â one would be OCB-I and one would 

be OCB-O (i.e. Alge et al., 2006; Kahya, 2009; Raja & Johns, 2010; Tse & Chui, 2013) 

so I created a composite that included both as OCB. One study reported creative 

58 


performance-task performance/OCB correlations at two points (i.e., Binnewies et al., 

2009), and I considered them two separate samples.  

I also had research questions concerning both categorical (rater source, study 

location, OCB-I vs. OCB-O) and continuous moderators (average age, average tenure, 

gender). To assess the presence of categorical moderators, I repeated the meta-analysis 

procedures including only studies at each level of each moderator.  Moderation was 

present when the 95% confidence intervals around each estimate of (cid:545) for each level of a 

given moderator did not overlap. In order to assess the continuous moderators, I 

conducted two sets of analyses.  First, I correlated the continuous moderators (average 

age, average tenure, and % female in each study) with the creative performance-task 

performance/OCB correlations. Second, I specified two multiple regression models. For 

this first model, I regressed the creative performance-task performance correlations onto 

the continuous moderators. For the second, I regressed the creative performance-OCB 

correlations onto the continuous moderators. A significant relationship (i.e., correlation or 

regression coefficient) between a continuous moderator and the creative performance-

task performance/OCB relationships would indicate the presence of moderation.

Participants 

Study 2 

 Participants in this study were working adults in the United States. The 

participants were recruited using Amazonâs Mechanical Turk. Mechanical Turk is a 

platform that researchers can use to gather anonymous data via online surveys by paying 

participants a nominal fee. For this study, participants were compensated $1.00 for their 

responses. Mechanical Turk allows for sampling from a wide range of jobs and 

industries. Reviews of Mechanical Turk have concluded that there are only slight 

differences if any between Mechanical Turk and other samples used in research and that 

the data from the Mechanical Turk platform is valid when data quality enhancement 

techniques are applied (Barger, Behrend, Sharek, & Sinar, 2011). Accordingly, I applied 

such techniques by removing participants with questionable responses (i.e., random 

responding, answering validity questions incorrectly) from the analyses. In order to 

participate in this study, participants had to be US Citizens and currently employed for at 

least 20 hours per week in an organization with coworkers and a supervisor. 

After cleaning the data I had 299 useable and complete surveys. The sample was 

53% male. The average age of the participants was about 35 (M = 35.10, SD = 11.44). 

The average job tenure was 6.54 years (SD = 6.18). Sixty-nine percent of the participants 

worked full time and the remaining 31% worked part time. The majority of the 

participants reported their race/ethnicity as Caucasian (82%), 6% were Black/African 

American, 6% were Hispanic//Latino, 5% were Asian, and the remainder reported their 

race as âother.â 

 

60 


Measures 

 

Below I describe the measures used in Study 2. These measures can be found in  

the Appendix. 

 

Big Five. Although Study 2 is mainly concerned with extraversion and 

conscientiousness, I measured all the Big Five traits in order to be comprehensive. Big 

Five traits was measured by the IPIP Neo. Each of the Big Five traits were assessed with 

ten items. Participants rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) how much 

they agree with each item. Each of the Big Five had five positively worded items and five 

negatively worded items. Cronbachâs alpha for this study was .94 for extraversion, .91 for 

conscientiousness, .92 for emotional stability, .84 for agreeableness, and .79 for openness 

to experience. 

 

Proactive Personality. To measure proactive personality, Siebert et al.âs (2001) 

scale was used. It is the 10-item version of Bateman and Crantâs (1993) measure. An 

example item is âIf I see something I donât like, I fix it.â Participants rated from 1 

(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) how much they agree with each item. Proactive 

personality had a Cronbachâs alpha of .92 for this study. 

 

Self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was measured using the Generalized Self-efficacy 

scale (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995). It contains ten items which participants indicate to 

what extent each statement is 1 (not at all true) to 4 (exactly true). An example item is âI 

can usually handle whatever comes my way.â The Generalized Self-efficacy scale had a 

Cronbachâs alpha of .92 for this study. 

 

Autonomy. Autonomy was measured by using Breaughâs (1985) scale. The scale 

contains nine items about work method autonomy, work scheduling autonomy, and work 

61 


criteria autonomy. A sample item is âI have control over the scheduling of my work.â 

Participants rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) how much they agree 

with each item. Autonomy in the current study had a Cronbachâs alpha of .92. 

 

Feedback. Feedback was measured using Zhouâs (2003) 3-item measure. A 

sample item is âMy supervisor provides me with useful information on how to improve 

my job performance.â Participants rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) 

how much they agree with each item. Feedback contained both positive and negatively 

worded items and had a Cronbachâs alpha of .81 in the current study. 

 

Supervisor Support. Supervisor support was measured using Oldham and 

Cummings (1995). The measure contains eight items. A sample item is âmy supervisor 

encourages me to develop new skills.â Participants rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 

(strongly agree) how much they agree with each item. Supervisor support contained both 

positively and negatively worded items. Supervisor support in the current study had a 

Cronbachâs alpha of .90. 

Engagement. To measure engagement I used the UWES-employee version by 

Schaufeli et al. (2002). It is the most popular measure of engagement used in academic 

research. This measure includes the subscales of vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor 

contains six items, dedication contains five items, and absorption contains six items. An 

example item (vigor) is âAt my work I feel bursting with energy.â Participants rated from 

1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) how much they agree with each item. The 

UWES had a Cronbachâs alpha of .93 in this study. 

Creative Performance. Creative Performance was measured using Zhou and 

Georgeâs (2001) 13-item scale where statements are measured on a 5-point Likert-type 

62 


scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where participants indicated how 

much they agree the items correspond with how they perform at work. An example item 

is âoften has new and innovative ideas.â Cronbachâs alpha for creative performance in the 

current study was .95. 

Task Performance. Task performance was measured using an adapted to self-

rating from Van Dyne and LePine (1998). It contains four items. Participants rated from 1 

(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) how much they agree with each item. An 

example item is âI fulfill the responsibilities specified in my job description.â Cronbachâs 

alpha was .94 in the current study. 

OCB. To measure OCB, the OCB-checklist by Fox and Spector (2011) was used. 

It includes 20 items. Participants rate from 1 (never) to 5 (everyday) how often they do 

the statements at work. An example item is âvolunteer for extra work assignmentsâ 

Cronbachâs alpha for the OCB-checklist was .92 in this study. 

Procedure 

Participants completed Study 2 online via Amazonâs Mechanical Turk and it took 

approximately twenty minutes complete. They were first presented with questions 

collecting demographic information and then the above-described scales in random order. 

The items within each scale were also randomized.  I included six validity check items 

(example item: âselect strongly agree for this itemâ). Participants who failed more than 2 

of the validity check items were not included in this sample. Participants were 

compensated $1.00 for their responses. 

 

 

63 


Analyses 

I cleaned the data by checking for random responses. I included six validity check 

items and deleted any participant who incorrectly answered more than two of these items. 

These participants were not included in the final sample or any analyses. The final 

sample of 299 participants had a score for each measure and therefore I had no missing 

data. The data for Study 2 was evaluated for multivariate outliers by examining leverage 

indices for each individual and defining an outlier as a leverage score four times greater 

than the mean leverage. I also computed the df Beta for each regression and defined an 

outlier as larger than the absolute value of one. No outliers were detected. 

Prior to analyzing the proposed hypotheses I also ran a series of confirmatory 

factor analyses (CFA) to test that the measures represented independent constructs. In 

order to test Hypotheses 3-26 in Study 2, I first calculated the correlations between the 

study variables. Hypotheses 27-33 concern the mediating role of engagement so I partial 

model tested using regression. In order to assess if there was mediation I used Baron and 

Kennyâs (1986) approach. In Baron and Kennyâs approach three regression analyses are 

conducted. First (Model 1), you regress the mediator onto the independent variable. Next, 

(Model 2), the dependent variable is regressed onto the independent variable. In the third 

regression (Model 3), the dependent variable is regressed onto the independent variable 

and mediator. In order to provide support for mediation the mediator needs to be 

significantly affected by the independent variable (Model 1), the dependent variable 

needs to be affected by the independent variable (Model 2), and the dependent variable 

needs to be affected by the mediator while controlling for the independent variable 

64 


(Model 3). The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable needs to be 

less in Model 3 than in Model 2 in order to establish that mediation occurred.

CHAPTER IV: RESULTS 

Study 1 

 

Study 1 is a meta-analysis of the relationship between creative performance and 

task performance and between creative performance and OCB. Below I present the 

results concerning the relationship between these variables and potential moderators of 

the relationship. 

 Reliability Distributions. Before I present the results of the meta-analysis, I 

review the reliability estimates for the three types of criteria examined in the present 

meta-analysis.  Table 1 reports the results of a meta-analysis of the coefficient alphas 

reported in the studies included in the meta-analysis by criteria and rater source. These 

results were calculated using sample size-weighting and frequency-weighting. I also 

repeated these analyses using the square root of the reliabilities. Specifically, column 1 

included the source of the performance rating, column 2 is the total sample size (total 

number of individuals rated across studies included in that meta-analysis), and column 3 

is the number of estimates included in the analyses. Columns 4 and 5 are the sample size-

weighed mean and standard deviation of the values that were meta-analyzed. Columns 6 

and 7 included the unweighted (or frequency-weighted) mean and standard deviations. 

Columns 8 and 9 report the sample size-weighted mean and standard deviations of the 

square roots. Lastly, columns 10 and 11 report the unweighted (or frequency-weighed) 

mean and standard deviation of the square root of the reliabilities. 

Concerning these tables, one study (Alge et al., 2006) included information on 

rater source as âpeer, subordinate, and supervisor.â I included this paper in analyses as 

âother raterâ but not as peer or supervisor. 

66 


As seen in Table 1, the creative performance sample size-weighed mean alpha 

reliability ranged from .89 (peer rater) to .93 (supervisor rater), with an overall sample 

size-weighed mean alpha reliability across sources of .91. Task performance ranged from 

.80 (peer rater) to .88 (supervisor rater), with an overall sample size-weighed mean alpha 

reliability across sources of .85. Organizational citizenship behavior ranged from .66 

(peer rater) to .85 (supervisor rater). The sample size-weighed mean alpha reliability 

across sources was .76. It is interesting to note that for all three criteria the highest sample 

size-weighed mean alpha reliability were for the supervisor raters and the lowest sample 

size-weighed mean reliability were for the peer raters. 

Creative performance displayed the highest sample size-weighed mean alpha 

reliability in Table 1, ranging from .89-.93, followed by task performance (.80-.88), and 

then OCB (.66-.85). This can be partly due to creative performance scales containing 

more items than task performance or OCB scales. For example, the average length of 

creative performance scales was 8.24 items, while the average length of task performance 

and OCB scales were 5.10 items and 5.71 items, respectively. Because of this variability 

in scale length, I also used the Spearman-Brown formula to estimate the reliabilities if all 

the scales were the same length (10 items). These adjusted estimates are presented in 

Table 2. 

Creative performance again displayed sample size-weighed mean alpha 

reliabilities in the .90-range. This time, however, peer raters had the highest sample size-

weighed mean alpha reliability at .96, and self-rater displayed the lowest at .92. The 

sample size-weighed mean reliability for creative performance across all sources was .93. 

Task performance ranged from .85 (peer rater) to .93 (supervisor rater), with a sample 

67 


size-weighed mean reliability across sources at .92. The largest increase in sample size-

weighed mean reliability after adjusting for scale length was for OCB. Peer ratings still 

had the lowest sample size-weighed mean reliability at .87, however it was a large 

increase from .66. Again, supervisor ratings had the highest sample size-weighed mean 

reliability (.93). The sample size-weighed mean reliability across sources was .90. 

Although the results varied slightly by sources, creative performance still had the highest 

sample size-weighed mean reliability of .93, followed by task performance at .92, and 

OCB at .90.

Hypothesis Testing. Table 3 presents the results of the creative performance-task 

performance and creative performance-OCB meta-analyses. First I review the findings in 

the creative performance-task performance meta-analysis. Then I review the findings 

from the creative performance-OCB meta-analysis. I computed the sample size-weighted 

uncorrected correlation, its standard deviation, the sample size-weighted corrected 

correlation ((cid:545)), its standard deviation, 80% credibility interval and 95% confidence 

interval.  I made corrections for unreliability using an artifact distribution of the 

coefficient alpha reliability estimates reported in the studies. I also had some research 

questions pertaining to potential moderators. In terms of rating source, I conducted 

analyses across all rating sources (i.e., self, supervisor, peer), other raters (which included 

both supervisors and peers), only supervisor-raters, and only self-raters.  Only two studies 

(Ng & Feldman, 2009; Raja & Johns, 2010) used peer raters and therefore I did not 

include peer raters in the rating source moderator analyses. 

Creative Performance and Task Performance. The meta-analysis revealed that 

creative performance-task performance relationship was (cid:545) = .51 (corrected for alpha 

unreliability in both criterion), which would be considered medium-to-large according to 

Cohenâs (1992) rules of thumb. Only 15.32% of the variance was accounted for by 

statistical artifacts, suggesting the presence of moderators, which is tested and discussed 

in a later section. The 80% credibility interval ranged from .35 to .67, implying that 

multiple population correlations underlie this effect. These results show support for 

Hypothesis 1a. Further, this correlation was largest for other-rated and supervisor-rated 

performance ((cid:545) = .51 for both) and slightly lower for self-rated performance ((cid:545) = .46). I 

discuss the role of rating source as a moderator in a later section.

It is important to note that the corrected correlations reported above are corrected 

using coefficient alphas. Coefficient alpha accounts for item specific error and random 

noise (cf. Schmidt et al 2000). To generalize across raters, we need to correct the 

observed correlation with inter-rater reliability. Given that most of the studies did not 

report inter-rater reliability of ratings, I did not correct for rater idiosyncratic error.  

Viswesvaran et al. (1996) report that interrater reliability is lower than alphas for many 

dimensions of performance.  To the extent this is true, the correlations reported here are 

underestimates. 

Creative Performance and OCB. The creative performance-OCB relationship 

was also medium-to-large in magnitude according to Cohenâs (1992) rules of thumb, as 

the corrected correlation was (cid:545) = .49. Once again, only a small amount of variance 

(11.85%) was accounted for by statistical artifacts, suggesting the presence of 

moderators. The 80% credibility interval also had a large range (.27 to .71), which again 

suggested that multiple population correlations might be underlying this effect. Overall, 

these findings support Hypothesis 1b. Further, the corrected correlation was larger for 

other-rated ((cid:545) = .69) and supervisor-rated ((cid:545) = .59), and slightly lower for self-rated 

performance ((cid:545) = .43).  

Creative Performance as a Separate Dimension. Hypotheses 2 predicted that 

while creative performance should have a relationship with both task performance and 

OCB, the correlation should not be approaching 1.00. Creative performance displayed 

medium to large correlations with the other performance dimensions, however, the 

correlations were significantly different from 1.00. The upper bound 95% CIs for creative 

performance-task performance ranged from .52 to .64, and .47 to .80 for the creative 

72 


performance-OCB relationship, providing some initial supporting Hypothesis 2. 

However, because these correlations were not corrected for inter-rater reliability, they are 

actually underestimates. If I had the data to correct for inter-rater reliability, the 

relationship may be higher and approaching 1.0.

Moderators. I suggested and explored research questions concerning different 

moderators. These findings are presented in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

Rater Source as Moderator. The first research question concerns rater source as a 

potential moderator of the creative performance-task performance/OCB relationships. I 

found that the creative performance-task performance relationship differs when 

comparing self-rater ((cid:545) = .46) to other-rater ((cid:545) = .58); note that in Table 3, the upper limit 

of self-rater 95% confidence intervals is .52 and the lower limit of other-rater 95% 

confidence intervals is .52, however when not rounded to two decimal places, they do not 

overlap). Further, this is also echoed in the results for the creative performance-OCB 

relationship where again the confidence intervals for self-rater ((cid:545) = .43) and other-rater ((cid:545) 

= .69) do not overlap. These results suggest that rater (self vs. other) moderates the 

relationship between creative performance and task performance and between creative 

performance and OCB, such that relationship between creative performance and task 

performance and creative performance and OCB is stronger when the rater for both 

criteria is other-rater. 

Location as Moderator. Research question 2 asked whether study location 

moderated the relationships between the criteria. These results can be found in Table 4. I 

grouped the samples into three locations â Asia, Europe, and US. For task performance, 

the Asian countries included were China, Taiwan, and Singapore. The European 

countries were Germany, Ireland, and The Netherlands. For OCB, the Asia results only 

included China. The European counties were Germany and The Netherlands. I did not 

group Turkey, Pakistan, or Australia (which only appeared in the task performance meta) 

into any of these locations and therefore studies in these counties, along with studies who 

75 


did not report the country their sample was located in, were excluded from this moderator 

analysis. 

The corrected correlation between creative performance and task performance 

was .55 in Asia, .42 in Europe, and .68 in the US.  Furthermore, I observed evidence of 

moderation, as the creative performance-task performance relationship in samples from 

Europe (95% CI = .37, .47) was significantly different from the relationship observed in 

samples from Asia (95% CI = .48, .62) and the United States (95% CI = .64, .72). 

The corrected correlation between creative performance and OCB was .42 in 

Asia, .42 in Europe, and .75 in the US. The 95% confidence intervals for Europe did not 

overlap with the US. These findings suggest that country moderated the creative 

performance-OCB relationship, such that the relationship is significantly larger in the US 

as compared to Europe.

Continuous Moderators. Research questions 3-5 asked whether age (average age 

in each study), tenure (average job tenure in each study), and gender (measured as 

%female in each study) were moderators of the creative performance-task performance 

relationship. The results of these analyses are found in Tables 5 and 6. As shown on these 

tables, none of these variables were significant moderators. However, this could be due to 

sampling error because we only have a subset of the population or lack of power because 

there was only a small amount of data available. It is important to note some of the 

correlations (i.e. gender and creative performance-task performance, age and creative 

performance-OCB, and gender and creative performance OCB) display a medium effect 

size (Cohen, 1992).

OCB-I and OCB-O. The final research question (research question 6) asked 

whether or not the creative performance-OCB relationship differed depending on whether 

the OCB criteria was individually directed behaviors or organizationally directed 

behavior. As displayed on Table 3, I tested this question by meta-analyzing OCB-I and 

OCB-O separately. The corrected correlations between creative performance and both 

OCB-I and OCB-O were both .52, suggesting no difference between the relationship with 

creative performance for OCB-I and OCB-O. 

Conclusion. In summary, I found support for Hypotheses 1 and 2. That is, 

creative performance shares a positive relationship with both task performance and OCB. 

Although there was a medium to large effect size, this relationship is not approaching 1.0. 

However, the correlation was not corrected for inter-rater reliability and therefore is an 

underestimate. In Study 2, I examine a single sample that includes the criteria and 

therefore able to get a finer grained look at the correlations between the criteria. Further, I 

also found that rater source and rater location were moderators, however, age, tenure, 

gender, and direction of OCB were not significant moderators, although this could be due 

to sampling error or lack of power. Table 7 summaries the findings in Study 1.

Table 7. Study 1 Hypotheses 

Hypothesis/Research Question 
Hypothesis 1: Creative performance will be 
positively related to (a) task performance and (b) 
OCB 
Hypothesis 2: Creative performance will be a 
distinct dimension of job performance, that is, its 
corrected correlation will task performance and 
OCB and be different from 1.0 
Research Question 1: Does the rater source (self 
vs. other-rater) moderate the relationship between 
(a) creative performance and task performance (b) 
creative performance and OCB, such that when 
the rater source is other-rater, the relationship 
between criteria is stronger than if the rater source 
is self-rater? 
Research Question 2: Does location (US, Europe, 
and Asia) moderate the relationship between 
creative performance and task performance/OCB? 
Research Question 3: Does age moderate the 
relationship between creative performance and 
task performance/OCB? 
Research Question 4: Does tenure moderate the 
relationship between creative performance and 
task performance/OCB? 
Research Question 5: Does gender moderate the 
relationship between creative performance and 
task performance/OCB? 
Research Question 6: Does the creative 
performance-OCB relationship differ depending 
on whether the OCB is directed at the individual 
or at the organization?

Study 2 

Below I present the results of Study 2. Prior to analyses I cleaned the data by 

checking for random responses and incorrect responses to the validity check items. The 

results presented here are on the final sample of 299 complete surveys. I checked the 

completed surveys for outliers by examining leverage indices for each individual and 

computing the df Beta for each regression. No outliers were detected. 

Common Method Variance. To estimate if common method variance influenced 

the relationships in this study I used the method described by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, 

Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) that involves estimating the effect of an unmeasured latent 

method factor across items. I incorporated the method factor into two CFA models: (1) 

individual differences (extraversion, conscientiousness, proactive personality, and self-

efficacy) and (2) job characteristics (autonomy, feedback, and supervisor support). For 

the individual differences model the method factor accounted for 18% of the variance, 

and in the job characteristics model the method factor accounted for 6% of the variance. 

Common method variance may have somewhat inflated the correlation among variables 

in Study 2, however, the effect was not too great. 

 

Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Before I tested the proposed hypotheses I also 

tested the factor structure of the measures in the study. Specifically, I tested whether or 

not each group of variables (i.e., individual differences, job characteristics, and 

performance measures) represented distinct constructs rather than one factor. Because the 

models were nested I was able to test whether or not the proposed factor structure (i.e. 

each measure as a distinct construct) or a one-factor model fit the data better. Results of 

81 


(cid:548)2 difference tests indicated that the proposed factor structure fit the data better than a 

one-factor model. These results are presented in Table 8.

I also tested the proposed factor structure of engagement. Results of the CFA 

indicated adequate model fit: (cid:548)2(df)=374.1 (116), p < .01, CFI = .91, TLI = .88, RMSEA 

= .09, p-close < .01. 

Hypothesis Testing. Table 9 presents the means, standard deviations, and 

correlations between the variables in this study. Hypotheses 3-26 concern the 

relationships between individual differences and performance (Hypotheses 3-14), job 

characteristics and performance (Hypotheses 15-23), and engagement and performance 

(Hypotheses 24-26). I tested these hypotheses by using correlations and multiple 

regressions. For hypotheses 27-33, in which I predicted that engagement is a mediator 

between individual differences/job characteristics and performance I tested the 

hypotheses using Baron and Kenny (1986) procedures.

Individual Differences and Performance. Hypotheses 3-14 predicted that each 

individual differences (extraversion, conscientiousness, proactive personality, and self 

efficacy) would be positively related to creative performance, task performance, and 

OCB. Extraversion was positively and significantly related to creative performance (r = 

.38, p < .01), task performance (r = .19, p < .01), and OCB (r = .24, p < .01), supporting 

Hypotheses 3, 5, and 7. Conscientiousness was also positively and significantly related to 

performance (creative performance: r = .48, p < .01; task performance: r = .43, p < .01; 

OCB: .32, p < .01), which supports Hypotheses 4, 6, and 8. I also found support for 

proactive personality being positively related to performance (Hypotheses 9-11). 

Proactive personality was related to creative performance (r =.68, p < .01), task 

performance (r =.28, p < .01), and OCB (r =.42, p < .01). Finally, I also found support for 

a relationship between self-efficacy and performance (Hypotheses 12-14). The 

correlation between self-efficacy performance were as follows: creative performance r 

=.60, p < .01, task performance r =.42, p < .01, and OCB r =.39, p < .01. 

I also performed multiple regression analyses where I regressed the performance 

dimensions onto the individual differences. These results are displayed in Table 10. 

When creative performance was regressed onto the individual differences, extraversion ((cid:533) 

= .12, p < .01), proactive personality ((cid:533) = .46, p < .01), and self-efficacy ((cid:533) = .20, p < 

.01) were all significant predictors of creative performance, providing support for 

Hypotheses 3, 9, and 12.

I also used multiple regression analyses to examine the effect of the individual 

differences on task performance. The results of this analysis are displayed in Table 11. 

Conscientiousness ((cid:533) = .34, p < .01), proactive personality ((cid:533) = -.17, p < .01), and self-

efficacy ((cid:533) = .34, p < .01) were all significant predictors of task performance, supporting 

Hypotheses 6, 10, and 13. However, extraversion was not a significant predictor of task 

performance (Hypothesis 5).

Next I regressed OCB onto the individual difference predictors. Only proactive 

personality ((cid:533) = .23, p < .01) and self-efficacy ((cid:533) = .16, p < .05) were significant 

predictors of OCB, providing support for hypotheses 11 and 14. These results are 

displayed below in Table 12.

Job Characteristics and Performance. I also predicted that job characteristics 

(autonomy, feedback, and supervisor support) would be positively related to performance 

(Hypotheses 15-23). I tested these results using correlations and multiple regressions. 

Autonomy was positively and significantly related to creative performance (r = .41, p < 

.01), task performance (r = .16, p < .01), and OCB (r = .20, p < .01), supporting 

Hypotheses 15-17. Next, I predicted that feedback would positively predict performance 

(Hypotheses 18-20). I found support for a positive and significant relationship between 

feedback and creative performance (r = .24, p < .01), task performance (r = .32, p < .01), 

and OCB (r = .14, p < .05). The last job characteristic I predicted to be positively and 

significantly related to performance is supervisor support. Supervisor support was 

86 


positively and significantly related to creative performance (r = .38, p < .01), task 

performance (r = .34, p < .01), and OCB (r = .18, p < .01). 

I also regressed the performance criteria onto the job characteristics to test 

Hyptheses15-23. First I regressed creative performance onto autonomy, supervisor 

support, and feedback. I fount that autonomy ((cid:533) = .20, p < .01) and supervisor support ((cid:533) 

= .28, p < .01) significantly predicted creative performance, providing support for 

Hypotheses 15 and 21, but feedback was not a significant predictor of creative 

performance, failing to provide support for Hypothesis18. These results are displayed in 

Table 13.

In order to test the effect of job characteristics on task performance, I also 

regressed task performance onto autonomy, supervisor support, and feedback. The results 

of this analysis is displayed in Table 14. I found that only supervisor support was a 

significant predictor of task performance ((cid:533) = .21, p < .05), providing support for 

Hypothesis 22.

Finally, in order to test the effects of job characteristics on OCB, I also performed 

a multiple regression where I regressed OCB onto autonomy, supervisor support, and 

feedback. In this analysis, displayed below in Table 15, only autonomy ((cid:533) = .17, p < .01) 

was a significant predictor of OCB, providing support for Hypothesis 17. However, 

neither feedback nor supervisor support were significant predictors of OCB.

Engagement and Performance. Next, I hypothesized that engagement would be a 

positive predictor of creative performance (Hypothesis 24), task performance (Hypothesis 

25), and OCB (Hypothesis 26). Engagement was positively and significantly related to all 

three types of performance. Engagement was most strongly related to creative 

88 


performance (r = .59, p < .01), but was also significantly related to task performance, (r = 

.40, p < .01) and OCB (r = .40, p < .01). 

I also tested these relationship using multiple regressions. I regressed each of the 

performance criteria onto all the predictors (engagement, individual differences, and job 

characteristics). In each of these regressions, I found that engagement was a significant 

predictor of creative performance ((cid:533) = .22, p < .01), task performance ((cid:533) = .18, p < .01) 

and OCB ((cid:533) = .23, p < .01), providing more support for Hypotheses 24-26.

Engagement as a Mediator. Up until this point I have found support that 

individual differences, job characteristics, and engagement are all positively correlated 

with creative performance, task performance, and OCB. When I moved analyses into a 

multiple regression framework, I found that most of the individual differences and job 

90 


characteristics still predicted creative performance, task performance, and OCB. I also 

found that engagement was a significant predictor of creative performance, task 

performance, and OCB. For Hypotheses 27-33 I predicted that engagement is a mediator 

between individual differences/job characteristics and performance. Below I test and 

explain these findings. 

In order to test for mediation using the guidelines outlined in Baron and Kenny 

(1986), three regression analyses were run. First (Model 1), I regressed the mediator 

(engagement) onto the independent variable (individual difference or job characteristic). 

Next, (Model 2), the dependent variable (performance â creative performance, task 

performance, or OCB) was regressed onto the independent variable (individual difference 

or job characteristic). In the third regression (Model 3), the dependent variable 

(performance) was regressed onto the independent variable (individual difference or job 

characteristic) and mediator (engagement). To support mediation the mediator needs to 

be significantly affected by the independent variable (Model 1), the dependent variable 

needs to be affected by the independent variable (Model 2), and the dependent variable 

needs to be affected by the mediator while controlling for the independent variable 

(Model 3). The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable needs to be 

less in Model 3 than in Model 2 in order to establish that mediation occurred.  

Engagement as a Mediator between Individual Differences and Performance. 

Hypotheses 27-30 predicted that engagement would mediate the relationship between 

individual differences and a) creative performance, b) task performance, c) OCB. 

Hypothesis 27 predicted that engagement mediated the relationship between extraversion 

and performance. As seen in Table 19 the beta weight of extraversion dropped when 

91 


engagement was added to the models, providing support for the hypotheses that 

engagement mediates the relationship between extraversion and a) creative performance, 

b) task performance, and c) OCB.

Hypothesis 28 predicted that engagement would mediate the relationship between 

conscientiousness and performance. As shown in Table 20 when engagement was added 

to the model the effect of conscientiousness on performance dropped providing support 

for mediation.

I also found support for engagement mediating the relationship between proactive 

personality and performance. Theses results are displayed in Table 21. Again, the beta 

weight for proactive personality was lowered when engagement was controlled for in the 

model, providing support for Hypothesis 29.

I also predicted that engagement would mediate the relationship between self-

efficacy and the three types of performance. Hypothesis 30 was supported as seen in the

Engagement as a Mediator between Job Characteristics and Performance. The 

last Hypotheses (31-33) predicted that the relationship between situational characteristics 

and performance (creative performance, task performance, and OCB) would be mediated 

by engagement. The results of these hypotheses are displayed in Tables 13-15. 

 

Hypothesis 31 predicted that the relationship between autonomy and performance 

would be mediated by engagement. As seen in Table 23 the beta weight of autonomy 

dropped when engagement was added to the model providing support for Hypothesis 31.

relationship between feedback and performance. Again, I found support for Hypothesis

Conclusion. Overall, the results support the hypotheses in Study 2. When I 

correlated the variables, I found support that individual differences and job characteristics 

predict creative performance, task performance, and OCB. However, when I looked at the 

multiple regressions, I did not find support for every hypothesis. Specifically, for the 

individual difference variables, conscientiousness was not a significant predictor of 

creative performance, extraversion was not a significant predictor of task performance, 

and extraversion and conscientiousness were not significant predictors of OCB.  For the 

job characteristics, I found that feedback did not significantly predict creative 

performance, autonomy and feedback did not significantly predict task performance, and 

neither supervisor support not feedback significantly predicted OCB. Beyond these direct 

relationships, I did found that engagement mediates the relationship between all the 

individual differences and performance, and between all the job characteristics and 

performance. I summarize the findings in Study 2 in the tables below.

CHAPTER V: DISCUSSION 

 

Overall, the findings in this dissertation support the proposition that creative 

performance is a separate stand-alone dimension of job performance. Through two 

separate but related studies on creative performance in organizations, I found that 

creative performance is positively related to other performance criteria (i.e. task 

performance and OCB) and that creative performance shares common antecedents and 

process mechanisms with other performance criteria. The main finding in this dissertation 

is that creative performance should no longer be neglected in organizations and instead 

should be included in current models of job performance. 

 

Each of the studies in this dissertation has their own unique contributions to the 

overall proposition of this dissertation. Below I discuss the overall findings of each study, 

the limitations of each study, the overall implications of this dissertation, and finally 

suggest future research directions 

Study 1 

 

Study 1 was a meta-analytic cumulation of the research that includes creative 

performance and task performance and also includes creative performance and OCB. The 

purpose of the study was to examine if creative performance shares a positive 

relationship with other important job performance criteria and to determine whether or 

not creative performance was a separate stand-alone dimension of job performance 

criteria. This study also had several research questions pertaining to potential moderators, 

which included: rater source, study location, sample age, sample tenure, sample gender, 

and direction of the OCB (at the individual or organization).  

102 


 

Concerning the reliability piece of Study 1, I found that for all three criteria 

(creative performance, task performance, and OCB), supervisor raters had the highest 

mean weighted alpha reliabilities. I also found that for all three criteria, the mean 

weighted alpha reliabilities were lowest for peer raters. Creative performance displayed 

the highest mean weighted alpha reliabilities of the three criteria. Task performance had 

the second highest mean weighted alpha reliabilities, and OCB had the lowest mean 

weighted alpha reliabilities. 

In order to account for scale length in the reliability estimates, I used the 

Spearman-Brown formula to estimate the reliabilities as if all scales were on the same 

length (10 items) as the scales varied in their average number of items (creative 

performance = 8.24, task performance = 5.10, and OCB = 5.71). When I applied the 

Spearman-Brown formula, creative performance again displayed the highest alpha 

reliabilities of the three criteria. It is important to note that alpha captures dimensionality. 

It could be that creative performance has the highest alpha reliabilities because it is the 

most one-dimensional of the three criteria. Task performance and OCB are more multi-

dimensional constructs that are more diverse. 

Overall, Study 1âs hypotheses and research questions had interesting findings. 

First of all, creative performance shared a positive relationship with task performance 

(when corrected for unreliability in both criterion, (cid:545) = .51). The relationship is a medium-

to-large effect size according to Cohenâs rules of thumb (1992). The 80% credibility 

interval ranged from .35 to .67, implying that multiple population correlations underlie 

this effect. I also found that only 15.32% of the variance was accounted for by statistical 

103 


artifacts, suggesting the presence of moderators. I discuss the moderator findings in a 

later section. 

Creative performance and OCB also had a medium-to-large effect size of (cid:545) = .49. 

The 80% credibility interval also had a large range (.27 to .71), which suggests that 

multiple population correlations might be underlying this effect. Similar to the findings in 

the creative performance-task performance meta-analysis, only a small amount of 

variance (11.85%) was accounted for by statistical artifacts, which suggests the presence 

of moderators. Overall, in Study 1, I found support for Hypothesis 1a and 1b, as creative 

performance has a medium-to-large correlation with both task performance and OCB. 

These findings suggest that creative performance is positively related to both task 

performance and creative performance. 

Hypothesis 2 predicted that creative performance would be a separate stand-alone 

dimension of job performance, that is, the correlation between creative performance and 

task performance and the correlation between creative performance and OCB should not 

be approaching 1.00. This finding can determine that creative performance is in fact 

distinct and is not just providing us with redundant information. It is important to 

establish that creative performance is a separate stand-alone dimension of performance 

because if it is a distinct dimension then it effects so many different areas of 

industrial/organizational psychology including models of performance, selection, and 

performance appraisal. As described above, while creative performance had a medium-

to-large correlation with the other performance criteria, the effect size was not 

approaching 1.00, therefore providing support for Hypothesis 2. However, because I was 

unable to correct for inter-rater reliability due to a lack of data, the actual correlation may 

104 


be higher if it were corrected for inter-rater reliability. If I were able to correct for inter-

rater reliability, the correlations may be larger and possibly not different significantly 

different from 1.0.  

 

As mentioned above, in both the creative performance-task performance and 

creative performance-OCB meta-analyses, only a small amount of variance in each meta-

analysis was accounted for by statistical artifacts. I had some research questions 

pertaining to potential moderators that may influence the creative performance-task 

performance and creative performance-OCB relationships. Accompanying moderator 

analyses were performed which yielded some interesting findings pertaining to these 

moderators. 

Study 1 found that rater source was a moderator, such that in the creative 

performance-task performance relationship and in the creative performance-OCB 

relationship, the relationship differed when comparing self-ratings to other-ratings. For 

both relationships, the correlation was larger for other-ratings than for self-ratings. I also 

found that study location was a moderator. The correlation between creative performance 

and task performance was significantly lower in Europe than in the United States. For the 

creative performance-OCB relationship, the correlation was significantly larger in the US 

as compared to Europe. The reason for this could be that the US and its culture places a 

larger emphasis on creative performance, which explains why creative performance has a 

stronger relationship with the other performance dimensions in the US. Creative 

performance could be seen as a part of performance if it is emphasized more, resulting in 

a stronger correlation between dimensions. However, I did not find evidence of 

moderation for age, tenure, or gender, and that the relationship between creative 

105 


performance and OCB did not differ whether the OCB was directed at the individual or 

the organization (OCB-I and OCB-O). 

 

Although no specific research questions surround this topic, I also had an 

interesting finding concerning scales used in the organizational creative performance 

literature. As this is a newer area of research in organizations, these finding may help 

inform future researchers. Mostly, a few of the same scales for creative performance were 

used in the studies, including Janssen (2000), Scott and Bruce (1994), and Oldham and 

Cummings (1996). However, the most popular scale was Zhou and George (2001) as it 

was used in the most studies in the meta-analyses as the creative performance criterion 

measure. This is interesting because it seems as if the literature is at least somewhat in 

agreement over how they conceptualize creative performance and what measures they 

believe capture this conceptualization best. As stated before, creative performance also 

exhibited the largest reliabilities, even after I used the Spearman-Brown formula to 

account for scale length.   

Study 2 

 

Study 2 also yielded positive findings. I found that extraversion, 

conscientiousness, proactive personality, and self-efficacy were all positively related to 

creative performance, as they were positively related to task performance and OCB when 

I examined the correlations between the study variables. The job characteristics 

(autonomy, feedback, and supervisor support) were also positively related to the three job 

performance dimensions when I examined the correlations. 

I did however find some differences in the findings when I analyzed the data 

using multiple regression. Specifically, conscientiousness and feedback were not 

106 


significant predictors of creative performance. I also found that extraversion, autonomy, 

and feedback did not significantly predict task performance. For OCB, I found that 

extraversion, conscientiousness, supervisor support, and feedback were not significant 

predictors. However, proactive personality and self-efficacy were significant predictors 

of all three performance criteria in both the correlation and regression analyses. Below I 

expand on these findings by exploring past research on each of the criteria. 

The relationship between conscientiousness and creative performance has had 

mixed findings in the past; however, the correlation in Study 2 was still positive, rather 

than negative as other studies have found. This finding provides some support for the 

idea that the relationship between conscientiousness and creative performance at work is 

positive. Future research should explore this relationship. 

It was surprising that in the regression analysis, feedback did predict creative 

performance, as much theory suggests that there should be a positive relationship. 

However, some studies have found that this relationship can vary, as Slijkhuis et al. 

(2013) found that informational evaluations were related to creative performance, but 

only in individuals who were low in personal need for structure. 

Extraversion, autonomy, and feedback were all not significant predictors in the 

multiple regression analyses. Most research on extraversion and task performance has 

posited a significant relationship between extraversion and jobs that require social skills 

(i.e. managers or sales). It is possible that there was not a significant relationship between 

extraversion and task performance because the sample included individuals in an 

assortment of careers, and not just managerial or sales positions. Autonomy and feedback 

are usually job characteristics that predict task performance, however, most theory on this 

107 


emphasizes that these job characteristics result in better performance through motivation. 

This is evident in Study 2 in the mediation analyses where engagement, a motivating 

variable, mediated the relationship between these job characteristics and task 

performance. 

Finally, conscientiousness, extraversion, feedback, and supervisor support were 

not significant predictors of OCB in the multiple regression analyses. Past meta-analyses 

have not found a large correlation between extraversion and OCB (.11). However, 

conscientiousness is the strongest Big Five predictor of OCB, so it was surprising that in 

the multiple regression analyses conscientiousness was not a significant predictor of 

OCB. Feedback was also not a significant predictor of OCB, contrary to theory that 

suggests that feedback increases positive affect which leads to employees engaging in 

OCB. Little research has been done on supervisor support and OCB, however, research 

suggests that support leads to satisfaction, which leads to OCB (Chen & Chiu, 2008). 

Again in the mediation analyses, there was support for engagement mediating the 

relationships between job characteristics and OCB. This is logical, as past theory and 

findings suggest that there is a mediating variable (positive affect or satisfaction) that 

influences how these job characteristics lead to OCB. 

These findings are important because they show that creative performance shares 

some of the same antecedents that predict both task performance and OCB. These results 

support including creative performance in other models of job performance as 

antecedents can predict the performance criteria similarly. Another point to consider here 

is that I found support for all the mediation hypotheses, which suggests that although the 

108 


individual differences and job characteristics may not always lead to better performance, 

they can lead to better performance through engagement. 

 

Engagement was a significant predictor of all the performance criteria in both the 

correlation and regression analyses. Engagement was hypothesized to be the process 

through which these antecedents can predict performance. I found support for hypotheses 

surrounding engagement as a mediator between these individual differences/job 

characteristics and the three performance criteria, as hypothesized in the models depicted 

in Figures 1 and 2. Research on mediators gives us important insight into why or how our 

predictors of performance lead to performance. It gives us a process through which the 

prediction occurs. A positive finding in Study 2 is that engagement served as a mediator 

between the individual difference and job characteristic predictors and all three of the 

performance criteria. This finding helps to expand our current knowledge of process 

models of job performance. 

Limitations 

 

Study 1. Although the findings in Study 1 yielded very interesting findings, some 

limitations should be noted. There were a low number of studies in the creative 

performance-OCB meta-analysis. While overall I found a fairly strong correlation, I was 

unfortunately limited by the small amount of research (14 samples) that included both 

creative performance and OCB as criteria. Hopefully in the future, more studies will 

include both criteria (such as Study 2), as creative performance becomes a more relevant 

criterion in organizations, as it is demonstrated to be in this dissertation. Another point to 

consider is related to Hypothesis 2, which predicted that creative performance would be a 

distinct performance dimension. The meta-analysis provided support for this finding; 

109 


however, the observed relationship may actually be an underestimation because the same 

rater rated both performance criteria. The true relationships may actually be inflated due 

to halo error. 

 

Study 2. Study 2 is also not without limitations. The data was cross-sectional and 

based on self-reports. Because of this, there may be some issues with common method 

variance. Spector (1987) explains that method variance is an artifact of measurement that 

may bias results if all the ratings are collected in the same way. In Study 2, response bias 

or another factor in the participants can partially account for shared variance among the 

study variables. 

To minimize concerns about common method variance I performed some 

additional analyses to make sure that common method variance was not greatly 

influencing Study 2âs results. To estimate the extent to which common method variance 

may have influenced the relationships in this study, I used the method described by 

Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) that involves estimating the effect of 

an unmeasured latent method factor across items. Specifically, I returned to the CFA 

models described in the beginning of Study 2âs results section and added to them a 

method factor that accounted for the covariance among all indicators included in the 

model that was uncorrelated with the substantive factors. Note that for my model, 

involving engagement facets and performance dimensions, in these cases a theoretical 

general factor exists (e.g., Viswesvaran, Schmidt, & Ones, 2005) that could account for 

covariance among the indicators and this method was not appropriate for these CFA 

models (Hoffman, Lance, Bynum, & Gentry, 2010; Scullen, Mount, & Goff, 2000). 

Therefore, I incorporated the method factor into the following two CFA models: (1) 

110 


individual differences and (2) job characteristics. For the individual differences model the 

method factor accounted for 18% of the variance, and in the job characteristics model the 

method factor accounted for 6% of the variance. Thus, while common method variance 

may have somewhat inflated the correlation among variables in my study, the effect was 

small. 

Implications 

As researchers have stated, there is room for creativity in most, if not all, jobs 

(Shalley, 2008). For practitioners, creative performance can be a part of performance 

evaluations, used for selection, and can be a part of training and development initiatives. 

Further, the findings of this dissertation can also aid in many research efforts on creative 

performance. First of all, this dissertation found that creative performance is a stand-

alone dimension of performance, and is positively related to other favorable performance 

criteria, so researchers have support that creative performance is worthy of further 

investigation. Beyond this, the results of Study 2 suggest that creative performance shares 

similar antecedents to other performance criteria and therefore we can use this 

information to apply models of performance (task or OCB) to creative performance as 

well. In this vein, parallel research can help to inform each other on antecedents and 

models of job performance. 

Future Directions 

 

This dissertation has several findings that can influence future research projects. 

Overall, the findings in this dissertation help creativity researchers in establishing the 

value in studying creative performance in organizations. However, some specific 

directions of future research are listed below. 

111 


 

Study 1 meta-analyzed the relationship between creative performance and task 

performance/OCB. There are several different criteria that future research should look at 

with creative performance. Counterproductive work behavior is another stand-alone 

dimension of job performance that may have an interesting relationship with creative 

performance and according to theory this relationship could be positive or negative. 

Creative performance is a positive contribution to organizations, and its relationship with 

task performance and OCB established in the current dissertation affirms that it is a 

positive job performance criterion. It is likely that creative performance and 

counterproductive work behavior (CWB) are negatively related due to the positive 

relationship that creative performance has with task performance and OCB. However, 

some research on the dark side of creativity suggests that creative individuals are more 

likely to lie (Gino & Ariely, 2011), which may result in more CWB. Creative individuals 

may also be more âcreativeâ in their approaches to sabotage and theft, and therefore less 

likely to get caught than other individuals. Because of this, creative performance may 

also be positively related to CWB. Only future research on the subject can uncover what 

the true relationship may be. Beyond CWB, there are also several different job 

performance criteria that creative performance should be linked with such as adaptability, 

leadership, and turnover. Because creative performance conceptualized as a criterion in 

organizations is still in its early stages as far as research is concerned, it may be some 

time before enough studies are available in this topic area to be included in a meta-

analysis. 

 

The model tested in Study 2 was based off Bakker and Lieterâs (2010) model of 

engagement; however it did not include the entire proposed model. Bakker and Leiterâs 

112 


(2010) model was comprised of some of the same but some different antecedents divided 

into job resources (i.e. autonomy, performance feedback, social support, and supervisory 

coaching) and personal resources (i.e. optimism, self-efficacy, resilience, and hope). The 

model also included job demands (work pressure, emotional demands, mental demands, 

and physical demands) a moderator between job resources/personal resources and 

engagement. Further, their model also included financial turnover as an outcome 

alongside task performance, OCB, and creative performance. Even though Study 2âs 

model differed somewhat from Bakker and Lieter, the findings in the current study found 

some initial support for their proposed model. Future research should test Bakker and 

Lieterâs model in its entirety. Another model that future research can test is the same 

model included in Study 2 but with burnout as the mediator, instead of engagement, as 

these two constructs are opposites (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Testing Study 2âs model as a 

model of burnout can prove to be a fruitful endeavor as researchers uncover more about 

both engagement and burnout. 

 

Next, there are other antecedents of creative performance in organizations that 

should be looked at in future research. Although there was not a specific hypothesis on 

openness to experience in this dissertation, there was a positive relationship between the 

variable and creative performance, which was not surprising as a lot of past research has 

also found a positive relationship between openness to experience and creativity (Batey et 

al., 2010; Wolfradt & Pretz, 2001). Future research can look at the facets of openness to 

experience as predictors of creative performance. Further, although research indicates 

that the Big Five account for a range of behaviors in organizations (Harari, Rudolph, & 

Laginess, in press; Ones, Dilchert, Viswesvaran, & Judge, 2007), there are also several 

113 


different personality variables that can be examined beyond the Big Five, such as 

curiosity or sensation seeking. Beyond individual differences, there are more job 

characteristics that can influence creative performance as work such as task identity or 

leadership variables. Engagement, as measured by the U-WES positively predicted 

creative performance, but there are also different models and measures of engagement 

that can be looked at (e.g., Shuck & Herd, 2012; Shuck & Reio, 2011). If engagement 

really is related to performance in organizations, then all measures of engagement should 

lead to better performance.  

 

Although the literature suggests that creative performance is possible in all jobs, 

some industries require more creative performance, so the emphasis of creative 

performance in those industries can differ. There are also jobs where creativity must be 

changed some. For instance, nurses sometimes need to veer off the protocol or think 

outside the box to save someoneâs life, however, this creativity cannot compromise the 

safety of the patient. More research can look at creative performance in specific 

industries. 

Finally, although creative performance has been established as theoretically 

distinct from other dimensions of job performance, it has not been determined to be 

empirically distinct. It makes sense as to why it is theoretically distinct from other 

performance dimensions, as it is performance that is defined as novel-original and useful-

adaptive (Feist, 1998). So while it sounds theoretically distinct, there are many reasons 

why it may not be empirically distinct (i.e. general factor or job performance, or halo). 

More future research should try to address how creative performance can be empirically 

distinct.
