Summary

The psychological contract has been viewed as an explanatory framework for understanding
the employment relationship, and is regarded by some researchers as central in understanding
employee attitudes and behavior. Despite the importance ascribed to the psychological con-
tract, it remains theoretically underdeveloped and has received limited empirical attention.
This study takes a new approach to researching the psychological contract, through the use
of daily diaries, and addresses a number of fundamental questions regarding its nature. Results
show that both broken and exceeded promises occur regularly and in relation to virtually any
aspect of work, that the importance of the promise contributes signiﬁcantly to emotional reac-
tions following broken and exceeded promises, and that the psychological contract is an
important concept for understanding everyday ﬂuctuations in emotion and daily mood.

Introduction

The psychological contract has been viewed as an explanatory framework for understanding the
employment relationship and how that relationship is affected by structural organizational changes
such as downsizing (Parks & Kidder, 1994). It has been deﬁned as an individual’s beliefs, shaped
by the organization, regarding terms of an exchange agreement between the individual and the orga-
nization (Rousseau, 1995).

Despite the importance ascribed to the psychological contract, it remains theoretically underdeve-
loped and has received limited empirical attention (Guest, 1998). The main objectives of this study are
to take a new approach to researching psychological contracts using a daily diary method, and to
address a number of fundamental questions pertinent to a better understanding of the psychological
contract. It is the ﬁrst study to investigate psychological contract breach as events and the associated
outcomes of daily mood and emotion close to when they actually happen. It examines the assumptions

concerned with reactions to psychological contract breach and key properties associated with the
intensity of affective reactions. It is also one of the ﬁrst studies to consider events where employees
perceive that organizations exceed their psychological contract in a positive sense.

Review and Hypotheses

Perhaps the most important construct in psychological contract theory is that of ‘breach’. Breach,
deﬁned as occasions where an employee believes that their organization has failed to fulﬁl its promises
(Robinson & Rousseau, 1994), are seen as one of the main ways by which the psychological contract
affects the employment relationship and employee behavior. Breach has, for example, been found to be
associated with lower levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and withdrawal beha-
viors (e.g., Coyle-Shapiro & Kessler, 2000; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley & Feldman, 1999a,
2000). Given the importance of breach, it has received limited empirical attention, where all extant
studies take the form of questionnaire surveys. This knowledge gap has been noted by researchers
who have called for new methods of investigating the psychological contract and breach, such as
in-depth interviews (Morrison & Robinson, 1997) and diaries (Robinson, 1999).

Existing empirical research has also been limited by a number of common weaknesses, which occur
largely as a consequence of a mismatch between assumptions about the nature of the phenomena under
investigation and the methods and designs used to examine these phenomena. These weaknesses are
noted here, along with how a daily diary study can address these limitations. First, while the psycho-
logical contract is more broadly an exchange process, breaches of an employee’s psychological con-
tract are events that happen at work or in relation to work. For accurate measurement they therefore
need to be assessed soon after they occur, as do the immediate causes and consequences. The design of
existing studies precludes this detailed level of analysis as they do not capture breach incidents as they
happen but only ask employees to reﬂect and consider whether the organization has met its promises.
A daily diary study can capture events close to when they happen, and certainly within the same day.
A second limitation is that previous empirical studies have failed to look at within-person processes,
and have instead focused exclusively on between-person relationships or conﬂate between- and within-
person processes. However, the psychological contract is theorized to exist at the within-person or
intra-individual level: exchanges and breach are relative to an individual’s exchange history and
expectations. Therefore, analysis at the within-person level is of fundamental importance. The present
research, in its analysis of daily mood, isolates the within-person effects of psychological contract
breach and thus presents a more unbiased estimate of its inﬂuences on affective outcomes.

Third—and related to the previous limitation—is that the psychological contract is widely assumed
to reﬂect an exchange process; however, previous empirical studies investigating the relationships
between breach and outcomes (e.g., Robinson, 1996; Robinson & Morrison, 1995; Robinson & Rous-
seau, 1994; Turnley & Feldman, 1999a) have not, in fact, examined any kind of process but have
focused on relatively static and simple cause–effect models in which psychological contract breach
has deleterious effects on various work attitudes and behaviors. While a few studies of breach have
collected longitudinal data, they have done so in a limited way. These limitations include only making
assessments at two time points (e.g., Robinson, 1996), measuring breach at one time point only,
thereby making it impossible to track variation over time or reciprocity, and using long time lags
(e.g., 12 months) between survey waves and thus making questionable assumptions about the speed
and duration of breach effects. Clearly, theories that attempt to explain processes, such as the psycho-
logical contract, require a method that can capture this process over time. The present study, while not

addressing all these limitations, does make more reasonable assumptions about the time lag between
psychological contract breach and affective outcomes through examining daily mood and emotion
using an appropriate methodology.

Daily diaries are seen as being ideally suited to investigating phenomena that take the form of
events happening over time at the within-person level (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, & Schilling, 1989;
DeLongis, Hemphill, & Lehman, 1992; Reis & Wheeler, 1991) and are therefore arguably more
appropriate to studying the psychological contract as they permit access to ongoing everyday behavior
in a relatively unobtrusive manner by gathering reports of events, experiences and feelings close to
when they happen.

Affective reactions to broken and exceeded promises

Short-term affective responses are believed to be critical to the experience of violation that follows
psychological contract breach under certain conditions (Morrison & Robinson, 1997). Violations
are referred to as strong affective reactions to breaches, such as feelings of injustice and betrayal
and consequent deleterious effects on satisfaction with the job and the organization (Robinson &
Rousseau, 1994). A number of studies have found support for the relationship between breach and
job satisfaction (Coyle-Shapiro & Kessler, 2000; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley & Feldman,
2000). However, short-term affective responses have been overlooked in previous empirical research.
A recent exception to this is Robinson and Morrison (2000) who found a correlation between breach
and violation of 0.7 in a cross-sectional survey; however, this study also has the limitations outlined
earlier. We also argue that breach and exceeded promises can be regarded as examples of goal frustra-
tion and goal attainment, and that these concepts have well-documented relationships with affect
(Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996). This is the ﬁrst study to look at short-term affective reactions, opera-
tionalized here in the form of daily mood and immediate emotional reactions. Daily mood is likely
to have stronger relationships with behaviors (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996), such as organizational
citizenship behaviors, than other constructs such as job satisfaction which are typically measured in
psychological contract research.

A breach of the psychological contract is deﬁned here as occasions when the organization breaks a
promise to the employee. In addition, occasions when the organization goes beyond what it has
promised to deliver in a positive sense will also be considered. Previous research has largely neglected
the effects of ‘over-fulﬁlled’ psychological contracts; where it has been addressed (see Turnley &
Feldman, 2000) breach and over-fulﬁllment have been considered as opposite ends of a single
continuum. Here they are explored as independent events where we expect exceeded promises to be
construed as a positive event and thus have a positive effect on emotion and daily mood.

Hypothesis 1(a): Broken promises will be negatively related to daily mood.

Hypothesis 1(b): Exceeded promises will be positively related to daily mood.

Hypothesis 2(a): Broken promises will be associated with negative emotional reactions.

Hypothesis 2(b): Exceeded promises will be associated with positive emotional reactions.

Properties of promise contributing to affective reactions

Recent research has noted that it is vital to better understand the circumstances leading to feelings of
violation in order to identify ways of minimizing destructive responses (Robinson & Morrison, 2000;

Turnley & Feldman, 2000). Morrison and Robinson (1997) and others (see Rousseau, 1995; Turnley &
Feldman, 1999a) have proposed that the intensity of affective reactions to perceived broken promises
depend on the interpretation process following the breach and a number of properties of the promise
itself. We have selected four speciﬁc properties that are likely to vary on a day-to-day basis.

The ﬁrst is the explicitness, versus the implicitness, of the promise. While the explicit/implicit pro-
missory distinction is considered to be theoretically important—it is believed that explicit statements
guide attitudes and behavior more than implicit ones (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978)—the distinction has
rarely been investigated. It is expected that the reactions to broken or exceeded explicit promises will
be greater than for implicit promises. If an employee believes that an explicit promise has been
breached then she or he is more able to judge whether or not injustice was involved. When implicit
promises on the other hand go unfulﬁlled, individuals may conclude that they misunderstood what was
being offered (Turnley & Feldman, 1999b). To the extent that there is uncertainty, this may result in
sensemaking processes that delay affective reactions.

Second, it is expected that employees will experience greater affective reactions to broken/exceeded
promises when the other party is seen as being personally responsible, as the assignment of responsi-
bility following unfavorable outcomes affects the intensity of individual’s emotional reactions such as
anger (Ortony, Core, & Collins, 1988). Attributions regarding the other party’s intentions are
fundamental to the experience of violation. If failure to deliver is seen as being under the control of
the perpetrator, victims are much more likely to perceive violation (Rousseau, 1995).

Third, it is hypothesized that employees will experience greater reactions to broken/exceeded pro-
mises when the event has happened infrequently in the past as the more unexpected the event then the
more likely it will be to cause uncertainty and arouse anxiety (Morrison & Robinson, 1997). The ﬁrst
time a promise is broken is likely to ‘shock’ an employee, particularly in contrast to a previous history
of met obligations.

Fourth, it is hypothesized that employees will experience greater reactions to broken/exceeded
promises that are perceived as important with respect to the relationship with the other party. The
importance of the underlying promise has not been considered in previous operationalizations of
the psychological contract, with the one exception of Turnley and Feldman (1999a); however, the
separate effects of importance were not explored. Breach can be traumatic to a relationship and
undermine trust (Rousseau, 1995). Promises of greater importance to the relationship, when breached,
are likely to result in stronger affective reactions. In addition, to the extent that the broken/exceeded
promise impedes or facilitates movement towards a goal, the importance of that goal is directly
correlated with the intensity of the emotional reactions (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996). Examining
the role of importance also provides an opportunity to investigate the possible difference in effects
of discrepancies that ‘run the gamut from subtle misperceptions to stark breaches of good faith’
(Rousseau, 1995, pp. 111–112). The psychological contract captured in this study is possibly close
to what Schein (1980) had in mind when he referred to the psychological contract as being constantly
renegotiated, implying that the psychological contract operates and thus can be broken and exceeded
on a day-to-day basis.

Therefore, we hypothesize that affective reactions to broken or exceeded promises will be more

intense to the extent that:

Hypothesis 3: The promise underlying the psychological contract is explicit rather than implicit.

Hypothesis 4: The other party is held personally responsible for breaking the promise.

Hypothesis 5: The event has not happened, or happened infrequently, to the employee in the past in
their current organization.

Hypothesis 6: The promise is seen as important to the relationship.

Organizational Context

DIARY STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH

291

The participating organization from the ﬁnance sector is a major banking retail institution in the
UK. Participants from the bank were managers selected by the Head of Training and Development.
The remainder of the sample was part-time students recruited from the MSc Organizational
Behaviour/Psychology at Birkbeck College. Students on the program are mainly at early to
mid-stage careers, combining full-time work with a demanding academic course. It should be noted
that the average tenure of the sample is relatively high compared to other psychological contract
studies, in part due to the long-term tenure pertaining to jobs in the banking institution.

Method

Sample

Several organizations were approached for participation and the one that agreed was in the ﬁnance
sector and offered a sample of 21 employees drawn from its Head Ofﬁce. Participants were also
obtained through recruiting part-time students from the researchers’ institution who were in full-time
or part-time employment. Twenty-four additional participants were obtained from a variety of mainly
professional occupations. In essence a convenience sample was obtained, as is common with diary
studies. For many of the analyses, due to the ability to control at the individual level of analysis,
the convenience nature of the sample does not necessarily present a serious problem. However, as with
any convenience sample, descriptive results based on between-person analyses should be regarded
with some caution.

Relative to other diary studies the achieved sample of 45 can be considered to be of average size
(Briner & Parkinson, 1993). It should also be noted that for many of the later analyses the number of
cases equals ‘person-days’ rather than ‘persons’ giving an effective sample size of 450 (45
participants 10 daily diary entries).

The ﬁnal sample consisted of 11 part-time employees (24 per cent), 21 women (47 per cent) and 21
managers (47 per cent). The modal age category was between 30 and 39 (24 participants, 53 per cent of
the sample), and participants had an average tenure of 14.22 years (SD of 10.34 years). For the part-
time sample, the average number of scheduled contracted hours was 20.25 (SD of 5.77 hours).

Daily diary

The diary was completed over ten consecutive working days. Participants were posted their diary
booklets and asked to complete their daily diary schedules immediately at the end of each working
day. The ﬁrst three pages of the daily diary booklet provided instructions on how to complete the diary.
Attempts were made by the researcher to deﬁne the key terms to be used in the diary (such as ‘broken
promise’ followed by examples) to ensure that any confusion regarding such terms were minimized.
The diary procedure was as follows. First, participants were required to complete daily mood scales.
Second, participants were asked whether the organization had broken any promises to them on that

particular day. Third, they were asked whether the organization had exceeded, in a positive sense, any
promises during the day. If a promise had been broken or exceeded they were asked to provide written
details of the event and complete emotion checklists. Copies of the diary booklet are available from the
authors.

The measures used in the diary will now be described and presented in the order that they appeared
to the participant, section by section, on any given day. The reliability of scales was assessed using
Cronbach’s alpha. As the measures of emotional reactions to broken and exceeded promises were
designed especially for this study, factor analyses using principle components with varimax rotation
will be reported following the description of the measures. Items are reported in the Appendix.

Daily mood
The ﬁrst section in the diary began with an adaptation of Warr’s (1990) measure of affective well-
being, which is similar to other adjective measures of mood (e.g., PANAS), and asked participants
the extent they had experienced the feeling described by each adjective during the day. The measure
has two dimensions, anxiety–comfort and depression–enthusiasm. High scores reﬂect positive affect.

Broken promises
Participants were provided with an open-ended response format and asked to describe each and every
explicit and implicit promise the organization had broken on that day and had the opportunity to
describe the broken promise in detail. Broken promises will be treated as dichotomous variables where
0 represents no occurrence, and 1 represents one or more occurrence on any given day.

The representative of the organization
To ascertain who represented the organization as the other party to the psychological contract,
participants were asked, if they had reported a broken promise, the two following questions: ‘Where
did the promise originate from?’ and ‘Who broke the promise?’ and provided with an open-ended
response format.

Properties inﬂuencing affective reactions to broken promises
The explicitness of the promise was assessed at the point when participants described the broken pro-
mise, where they were asked to rate the broken promise as either explicit or implicit. The properties of
‘Responsibility’ and ‘Importance of promise’ were measured using single items. ‘Frequency of occur-
rence’ was measured using two items (
¼ 0.72). All items were to be rated on a 5-point scale where
high scores represented greater responsibility, importance or occurrence.

Emotional reactions to broken promises
Participants were then asked to report their emotional reactions following the broken promise and were
presented with a list of nine adjectives describing emotions. Several different categories of emotions
were considered (see Mikula, Scherer, & Athenstaedt, 1998; Parkinson, 1995), and the items ﬁnally
selected were chosen on the basis that they were plausible reactions to broken promises.

These items were entered into a factor analysis and two factors emerged with eigenvalues greater
than 1. The ﬁrst factor accounted for 49.5 per cent of the total variance and consisted of fairly extreme
emotions that may accompany betrayal by another party and was labelled ‘Feelings of betrayal’. The
second factor accounted for a further 14.3 per cent of the total variance and reﬂected feelings surround-
ing the shock of being hurt and was labelled ‘Feeling hurt’. All factor loadings exceeded 0.65. Alpha
coefﬁcients were 0.88 and 0.69 respectively. These factors have similarities with Morrison and
Robinson’s (1997) distinction where violation is seen as occurring at a basic level involving dis-
appointment and frustration and also at a more visceral level involving feelings of anger, resentment,
bitterness and outrage.

DIARY STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH

293

The third section of the diary adopted exactly the same format as described for broken promises with
two differences: ﬁrst, employees were asked whether the organization had exceeded any promises
made in a positive sense and second, participants were presented with a list of emotion adjectives
describing plausible reactions to exceeded promises.

Emotional reactions to exceeded promises
Participants were presented with a list of 10 items representing plausible responses to exceeded pro-
mises. Three factors emerged from a factor analysis with eigenvalues greater than 1. The ﬁrst
accounted for 50.9 per cent of the total variance and consisted of emotions surrounding feeling good
about one’s self and shall be labelled ‘Self-worth’; the second accounted for a further 14.6 per cent of
the total variance and reﬂected feelings of being cared for and shall be labelled ‘Cared for’; the third
consisted of the single item of ‘surprise’ and accounted for a further 11.5 per cent of the total variance.
All factor loadings exceeded 0.65. Alpha coefﬁcients for the factors with multiple items were 0.91 for
‘Self-worth’ and 0.83 for ‘Cared for’.

Analytical strategy

Data analyses will be based on pooling the data in the manner suggested by Michela (1990). In order to
isolate on within-person variation, it is necessary to control for, and thus remove, between-person var-
iation. This is achieved by subtracting the within-person mean from each observed score for each
dependent variable thus converting the analysis into a study of pooled within-person variation (Kessler,
1987). This residual score is then used in place of the observed score in later analyses. Controlling for
variation across individuals allows the researcher to rule out temporally stable personality and envir-
onmental factors as third variable explanations. Pooled within-person diary data provide more com-
pelling results than cross-sectional or uncontrolled pooled diary data (Bolger et al., 1989; Kessler,
1987) and observed changes in mood reﬂect within-person variation only.

This adjustment could not be carried out for the emotional reactions to broken or exceeded promises
for two reasons. First, because most participants recorded very few incidents over the diary period,
participants reporting, say, only one incident over the two-week period would have a residual score
of zero for any emotional and behavioral reaction, and this would be represented as no reaction at
all in the analysis, which is clearly not the case. Second, participants were explicitly asked their emo-
tional reaction to the incident. In other words, for these measures there is no initial between-subject
variation. All participants are assumed to have an initial baseline of zero emotional reaction: it is not
possible to have an emotional reaction to an event that has not occurred.

Results

Descriptive statistics, scale reliabilities and correlational analyses

The descriptive summary statistics, alpha reliabilities (where appropriate) and zero order correlations
are presented in Table 1. Given the novelty of a daily diary method some attention will now be given to
a descriptive summary of the diary data relating to how often broken/exceeded promises occurred on a
daily basis, who was the other party to the contract, and what are the content of broken/exceeded pro-
mises. These three questions are of a rather general and descriptive nature but are fundamental to our
understanding of psychological contract breach and the subsequent analyses.

DIARY STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH

295

It appears that employees perceive that organizations break promises to employees fairly frequently,
with 69 per cent of participants reporting at least one broken promise over the 10 day period. On
average, at least one (1.17) broken promise was reported per week. Fifty-nine per cent of broken
promises were explicit, 41 per cent implicit. Sixty-two per cent of participants reported at least one
exceeded promise over the 10 days. On average less than one (0.71) exceeded promise was reported
per week. Forty-seven per cent of exceeded promises were explicit, 53 per cent implicit.

The results suggest that the line manager is perceived as the key ‘other party’ to the psychological
contract as they were identiﬁed as being responsible for generating 38 per cent of promises that
are later broken and 53 per cent of the promises that are later exceeded. The line manager is also
seen as being responsible for 28 per cent of all broken promises and for 50 per cent of all exceeded
promises.

Participants’ descriptions of broken and exceeded promises were content analysed, and clustered
into 12 categories. This analysis will not be reported in detail (more information is available from
the authors); however, it is worth noting that broken and exceeded promises seem to occur in relation
to any aspect of work and can range from the major (such as being under covert surveillance) to what
might be thought of as relatively trivial events (such as receiving another employee’s mail). The latter
example is indicative of broken promises that occur as everyday events. The sensitivity of the diary as
an instrument may explain the high incidence found of broken and exceeded promises. Overall, broken
and exceeded promises occur most often around issues of social and technical support, with 16 per cent
occurring in this area.

Affective reactions to broken and exceeded promises

It is worth re-emphasizing that any results found here are more compelling than results based on cross-
sectional data (between-person analyses), or unrestricted analysis of pooled diary data, because the
confounding inﬂuence of individual difference variation has been removed (Bolger et al., 1989).

Hypotheses 1(a) and (b) were tested by regressing the two measures of daily mood on broken and
exceeded promises. Broken and exceeded promises explained a signiﬁcant amount of the variance in
enthusiasm (R2¼ 0.04, F¼ 8.21, p < 0.001, n¼ 425) and comfort (R2¼ 0.04, F¼ 9.26, p < 0.001,
n¼ 425). In support of H1A broken promises have a signiﬁcant negative relationship with depres-
sion–enthusiasm (
 ¼   0.17, p < 0.001) and anxiety–comfort (
 ¼   0.20, p < 0.001). In partial
support of hypothesis 1(b) exceeded promises are positively related to depression–enthusiasm
(
 ¼ 0.09, p < 0.05), but are not related to anxiety–comfort (
 ¼ 0.02, non-signiﬁcant). Further, effect
sizes of exceeded promises on daily mood are considerably smaller compared with broken promises.
The statistical analysis for emotional reactions to broken and exceeded promises (hypotheses 2(a)
and (b)) will be different to that of the analysis of mood. For daily mood, it was possible to compare
days when there had been a broken or exceeded promise against days when there had not. However,
participants were only required to complete measures of emotional reactions when a broken or
exceeded promise had actually occurred (n¼ 91 for broken promises, n¼ 60 for exceeded promises).
Instead, a one-sample t-test was performed where emotional reactions were tested against the null
hypothesis that there would be no reaction at all to the broken/exceeded promise (i.e., 1¼ ‘not at all’
on the 6-point scale). Support was found for hypotheses 2(a) and (b) with all the emotional reactions to
both broken and exceeded promises being highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001 in all cases).
Further, paired sample t-tests revealed that a broken promise is more likely to be accompanied by
feelings of betrayal, compared to feeling hurt (t¼ 6.13, p < 0.001). Exceeded promises are more likely
to be accompanied by feelings of self-worth, rather than cared for (t¼ 3.27, p < 0.01), and self-worth
rather than surprise (t¼ 2.03, p < 0.05).

Properties of promise contributing to affective reactions

Table 2 presents the results of regression analyses for broken and exceeded promises. The independent
variables explained a signiﬁcant amount of the variance for betrayal (R2¼ 0.25, F¼ 7.03, p < 0.001),
feeling hurt (R2¼ 0.14, F¼ 3.43, p < 0.05), self-worth (R2¼ 0.36, F¼ 7.71, p < 0.001), feeling cared
for (R2¼ 0.37, F¼ 8.07, p < 0.001), and surprise (R2¼ 0.20, F¼ 3.05, p < 0.05). Hypotheses 3, 4 and
5 predicted respectively that the explicitness of the promise, the extent to which the other party was
held responsible, and the infrequency of the broken/exceeded promise would all increase the intensity
of the affective reaction. There was no support for hypothesis 3 and only minimal support for
hypotheses 4 and 5, with the perceived responsibility of the other party for a broken resulting in
stronger feelings of betrayal and frequency of occurrence in the past of an exceeded promise being
less likely to result in surprise. Hypothesis 6 received reasonable support, with the importance of
the promise being associated with the greater likelihood of depression, betrayal and hurt following
a broken promise, and self-worth and feeling cared-for following an exceeded promise.

Discussion

There is relatively little information as to how often psychological contract breach occurs. In a survey
of recent MBA graduates, Robinson and Rousseau (1994) found that 55 per cent believed some aspect
of their psychological contract had been broken during their ﬁrst two years of employment, implying
that 45 per cent report no breach. This contrasts sharply with the results presented here which suggest a
far greater incidence of broken promises, with broken promises experienced on a weekly rather than
annual basis. One explanation for the different results is the level of analysis employed in the method
used, suggesting that the broken promises investigated in this study are conceptually different to
breach captured in other studies. Here broken and exceeded promises were assessed on a day-to-
day basis and it is likely that particularly minor events would not have been picked up using other
methods. The diary study required participants to report experiences at the end of each working

day, where examples were provided in the diary booklet of broken promises that could plausibly
happen on a day-to-day basis.

Breach of an employee’s psychological contract (i.e., the breaking of promises made to the
employee by the organization) were found to have a signiﬁcant negative relationship with both mood
dimensions. Occasions when employees perceive the organization to go above and beyond their
psychological contract (i.e., exceeding promises) were found only to have a signiﬁcant positive
relationship with one dimension of mood, that of depression–enthusiasm.

The effect sizes of broken promises on daily mood were large compared to other studies that have
investigated the effects of daily stressors on mood using daily diaries. In a study by Bolger et al.
(1989), mood was regressed on to ten daily stressors (e.g., overload at home; overload at work; argu-
ment with single other); a class of predictors labelled as interpersonal conﬂicts (e.g., argument with
spouse) was found to be the most signiﬁcant in explaining daily mood. Standardized regression coefﬁ-
cients for the interpersonal predictor variables ranged from 0.13 to 0.28. Bolger et al. (1989) concluded
that their results showed that ‘interpersonal conﬂicts are overwhelmingly the most important kind of
daily stress inﬂuencing psychological distress among the stress categories considered in this analysis’
(p. 811). On the basis of the results in the present study it would appear that psychological contract
breach, evidenced through comparable beta weights, must also be considered as one of the most
distressing of daily experiences, ranking alongside arguments with one’s spouse and arguments with
others in terms of inﬂuencing an individual’s daily mood. It also suggests that the psychological
contract may be a useful framework for understanding affective responses to work events.

Broken promises had a greater effect on daily mood than exceeded promises, supporting other
studies that have found negative events to be signiﬁcantly more important than positive events in
predicting affect (e.g., Stone, 1987). A possible explanation is that broken promises are a different
experience to exceeded promises with only certain breaches leading to the affective states Morrison
and Robinson (1997) reserve for the term ‘violation’. These types of broken promises involve extreme
emotional states such as betrayal, and may also serve to undermine the relationship between the two
parties (Rousseau, 1995), in a way that is asymmetric to the experience of exceeded promises. This has
theoretical implications for research on contract fulﬁllment. It implies that the relationship between the
continuum of contract fulﬁllment (ranging from broken to met to exceeded promises) and outcomes
may be curvilinear: contract fulﬁllment has a linear relationship with outcomes as it varies from broken
to kept promises but then reaches a plateau as contract fulﬁllment goes beyond ‘metness’ (i.e., when
the organization exceeds it’s promises in a positive sense) which does not lead to any signiﬁcant
changes in the outcome. Alternatively, contract fulﬁllment could be considered as multidimensional,
with broken promises and exceeded promises being independent dimensions.

Broken promises were found to be signiﬁcantly related to emotions of betrayal and hurt; exceeded
promises were found to be signiﬁcantly related to emotions of self-worth, cared for, and surprise.
Further, broken promises were more likely to be accompanied by feelings of betrayal, compared to
feeling hurt. The ﬁndings are broadly in line with theoretical predictions by Robinson and Rousseau
(1994) that psychological contract violation ‘goes beyond disappointment and produces feelings of
betrayal’ (p. 247). Exceeded promises were more likely to be accompanied by feelings of self-worth,
rather than cared for or surprise.

Of the four properties of promise included in the analysis (explicitness; other party’s responsibility;
occurrence in past; importance), the importance of the promise to the relationship with the other party
consistently emerged as the most signiﬁcant predictor of emotional reactions, where a broken or
exceeded promise had occurred. The effects of the remaining properties appear to act differentially
across relatively few of the outcomes.

There is tentative evidence that the relationships between broken promises and emotional reactions
are affected by a greater number of properties than exceeded promises. Both of the emotional

reactions to broken promises were signiﬁcantly predicted by two of the properties whereas emotional
reactions to exceeded promises were signiﬁcantly predicted by only one of the properties. A possible
interpretation is that broken promises result in increased sense-making. Previous research has found
that employees try to reduce anxieties surrounding uncertainty by engaging in increased monitoring
for information, or environmental scanning (Berger, 1979). The protracted sense-making period for
broken promises may also explain the lower mean ratings of emotional reactions to broken, compared
to exceeded, promises in that employees perhaps ‘suspend’ reactions and judgments until they believe
they have fully understood the incident.

These results broadly support Morrison and Robinson’s (1997) re-conceptualization of the deﬁnition
of violation where they make a distinction between violation and perceived breach. From the present
study it seems that feelings of violation do not automatically follow perceptions of breach, evidenced
by the low to moderate overall average reactions to broken promises. Instead feelings of violation only
follow the perception of breach under certain conditions. According to the data here, one of the most
signiﬁcant conditions appears to be the perceived importance of the promise to the relationship
between the employee and the organization.

The results, however, also challenge some of Morrison and Robinson’s (1997) theoretical asser-
tions. They present a complex model with a large number of variables, in excess of 20, proposed as
moderating the relationship between initial perceptions of an unmet promise and the experience of
violation. Considering the results for the four studied here, and the mixed ﬁndings by Robinson and
Morrison (2000) for a subset of the moderators, the model may be inaccurately speciﬁed and lack
parsimony by presenting numerous putative moderators. Clearly, the model requires extensive
empirical examination, and possibly revision, before establishing its utility. One approach to
modifying the model would be to consider more speciﬁc reactions to broken and exceeded promises.
For instance, the perceived responsibility of the other party may result in attributions of blame and
feelings of resentment following breach, but may be less likely to affect negative emotions such as
frustration.

Limitations and future research

This study deployed a new method for examining psychological contract breach that had some advan-
tages but also a number of limitations which in turn suggest interesting possible avenues for future
research. First, participants completed records at the end of each working day, which may have
resulted in perceptual distortions. However, such retrospection may still be more accurate than more
global retrospection (Hedges et al., 1985). Second, operationalizations of some of the variables may
appear rather weak. However, if more complete scales with multiple items had been used, the neces-
sary time for completing diary records may have had detrimental effects on respondents’ participation
in the study. Third, the nature of the sample, consisting of volunteers that were drawn from a limited
range of organizations, may affect the extent to which the results can be generalized to the wider popu-
lation even after the rigorous control at the individual level. Fourth, due to insufﬁcient sample size both
the organization and representatives of the organization (e.g., line manager) were treated as belonging
to the same category in the analyses. Turnley and Feldman (1999b) have argued that the type of con-
tract maker will affect reactions to contract breach, with violations more likely to follow from a breach
made by their direct supervisors rather than organizational systems, such as communications from
human resource departments. Future research should reﬁne on the categories used in the present study
by exploring the inﬂuence of the source of expectation on reactions to contract breach. Fifth, between-
person variation was not controlled for in the analysis of emotional reactions, with the implication that
these results conﬂate between and within-person differences. Future research could address this issue

299

by collecting baseline emotions on occasions when no breach has occurred in order to control for
between-person differences.

The present study followed what is considered to be good practice in diary design and provided
detailed instruction for diary completion and examples; however, this may have served to guide the
respondent in such a way as to elicit reports of broken/exceeded promises that may not have been
recorded if no instructions and examples were given, or led to the reporting of minor broken/exceeded
promises that may not usually be considered by researchers as part of an employee’s psychological
contract. Given the acknowledged subjectivity of employees’ psychological contracts, it is a matter
of debate as to what can be considered as lying inside or outside a psychological contract. Future
research should explore boundary condition issues relating to the content of psychological contracts.
It may also be beneﬁcial to adopt a more ethnographic approach by letting diary participants report
instances of breach/exceeded promises without any guidance from the researcher.

Finally, future research could use additional techniques to explore within-person longitudinal data
for researching psychological contracts. Emotional reactions to a breach are likely to ﬂuctuate over the
course of one day, so it would be desirable to measure such changes at the rate at which the emotions
unfold. Through taking several ratings of emotion each day and applying a technique such as event
history analysis (Taris, 2000) it may be possible to track emotional reactions to breach from a point
of greatest impact to a return to how the individual was feeling prior to the incident.

Conclusion

This study suggests that the psychological contract can be used to understand everyday ﬂuctuations in
daily mood, emotion and, by implication, behavior and cognition. Despite the study’s limitations, the
results lend support to the claim that research on the psychological contract can beneﬁt from methods
other than the questionnaire survey (Morrison & Robinson, 1997). Indeed, the idea that the psycholo-
gical contract is an exchange process, is ongoing, unfolds over time, and is an intra-individual phenom-
enon, implies that some of the key features of the psychological contract can only be studied
effectively by using the kind of intensive and detailed method adopted here. We hope this study serves
as a stimulus for further empirical work that attempts to reduce the mismatch between our theoretical
understanding of the psychological contract and the methodologies with which it is usually investigated.
